Abstract

Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have brought heightened awareness of military related
PTSD, as well as the intimate relationship problems that accompany the disorder and can influence
the course of veterans’ trauma recovery. In this paper, we review recent research that documents the
association between PTSD and intimate relationship problems in the most recent cohort of returning
veterans and also synthesize research on prior eras of veterans and their intimate relationships in
order to inform future research and treatment efforts with recently returned veterans and their
families. We highlight the need for more theoretically-driven research that can account for the likely
reciprocally causal association between PTSD and intimate relationship problems to advance
understanding and inform prevention and treatment efforts for veterans and their families. Future
research directions are offered to advance this field of study.

Our military involvements in Iraq and Afghanistan, Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi
Freedom (OEF/OIF), have raised awareness about the individual mental health consequences,
such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), that can arise from traumatic stress exposure
during the course of military deployment. At the same time, the scientific and lay communities
have become more attuned to the family issues that surround a veteran when s/he returns with
PTSD, as well as the individual and familial effects that are likely reciprocally related to the
veteran’s trauma recovery. This paper reviews recent research documenting the intimate

relationship problems related to PTSD in OEF/OIF veterans and their intimate partners. We
also synthesize research on prior eras of veterans and their intimate relationships and briefly
review intervention efforts that have involved veterans’ intimate partners. A next crucial step
in advancing the study of veterans’ PTSD and intimate relationship functioning is to develop
and test theoretical models that can account for the well-established association between this
individual psychopathology and relationship problems. We conclude the paper by reviewing
these efforts and offering suggestions to improve the understanding and treatment of problems
in both areas.

Military-related PTSD and Intimate Relationship Problems

Research with combat veterans and their families from different countries and prior eras has
long documented the strong association between PTSD and family relationship problems (see
Galovski & Lyons, 2004 for review). These studies consistently reveal that veterans diagnosed
with chronic PTSD, compared with those exposed to military-related trauma but not diagnosed
with the disorder, and their romantic partners report more numerous and severe relationship
problems and generally poorer family adjustment. Veterans with PTSD also divorce at higher
rates than do their trauma-exposed counterparts without PTSD (e.g., Cook, Riggs, Thompson,
Coyne, & Sheikh, 2004; Jordan et al., 1992). Male veterans with chronic PTSD have also been
found to be less self-disclosing and emotionally expressive with their partners (Carroll, Rueger,
Foy, & Donahoe, 1985) and to have greater anxiety related to intimacy (Riggs, Byrne,
Weathers, & Litz, 1998), as compared with veterans without PTSD.

Role of Trauma Exposure versus Posttraumatic Psychopathology

The extant research from veterans and their family members indicates that individual
posttraumatic stress symptomatology largely accounts for the harmful effects of war-zone
stress exposure on family functioning, at least in male veterans (Gimbel & Booth, 1994; Orcutt,
King, & King, 2003). A recent longitudinal study that included both male and female Gulf War
I veterans contributed important methodological advancements and findings regarding possible
gender differences in the role of PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure in family adjustment
problems. Taft, Schumm, Panuzio, and Proctor (2008) used structural equation modeling with
prospective data and found that combat exposure led to family adjustment difficulties in the
overall sample (male and female veterans combined) through its relationship with specific
PTSD symptom groupings (i.e., withdrawal/numbing and arousal/lack of control symptoms).
However, there was also evidence of a direct negative effect of combat exposure on family
adjustment in addition to PTSD symptoms for women, suggesting that PTSD symptoms may
not fully explain the deleterious aspects of war-zone stressor exposure on family adjustment
problems for female veterans. These findings, if replicated, may prove important in
understanding potentially differential impacts of warzone stressor variables on family
outcomes between male and female service members.

Several studies of combat veterans with chronic PTSD have found that, of the PTSD symptom
clusters, avoidance/numbing symptoms are relatively more strongly associated with intimate
relationship dissatisfaction and impaired intimacy (e.g., Evans, McHugh, Hopwood, & Watt,
2003; Solomon, Dekel, & Mikulincer, 2008). Solomon and colleagues (2008) recently
examined the mediating role of self-disclosure and verbal aggression in the association between
PTSD symptoms and impairments in marital intimacy in a sample of Israeli ex-prisoners of
war (POWs) and a control group of combat veterans who had not been POWs. They found that
self-disclosure partially mediated the association between the avoidance symptoms of PTSD
and marital intimacy. Consistent with other research (Koenen, Stellman, Sommer, & Steelman,
2008), this study suggests that diminished self-disclosure is one mechanism accounting for the
connection between avoidance symptoms and intimate relationship problems.

Avoidance/numbing symptom severity has similarly been negatively associated with Vietnam
veterans’ parenting satisfaction (Berz, Taft, Watkins, & Monson, 2008; Glenn et al., 2002;
Samper, Taft, King, & King, 2004). Moreover, among samples of male veterans, these
symptoms exhibit the strongest relative associations with parenting satisfaction when
considered alongside other PTSD symptom clusters (Samper et al., 2004), and when controlling
for other covariates such as combat exposure and other forms of trauma, childhood adversity
variables, and other psychopathology (Ruscio, Weathers, King, & King, 2002). Taken together,
these findings suggest that veterans’ inability to experience and express emotions and to engage
with others takes its toll on all family relationships and is not limited to romantic relationship
difficulties.

Intimate Aggression and PTSD

Findings across settings and study methodology indicate that male veterans diagnosed with
PTSD are more likely to perpetrate psychological and physical aggression against their partners
and children than are veterans without PTSD (Carroll et al., 1985; Glenn et al., 2002; Jordan
et al., 1992; Sherman, Sautter, Jackson, Lyons, & Xiaotong, 2006; Verbosky & Ryan, 1988),
with rates as high as 63% for some act of physical aggression in the past year (Byrne & Riggs,
1996). It is noteworthy that the occurrence and frequency of aggression in combat-exposed
veterans without PTSD parallels rates found in the general population (e.g., Straus & Gelles,
1990). The severity of aggressive behavior has been shown to be positively correlated with
PTSD symptom severity (Byrne & Riggs, 1996; Glenn et al., 2002; Taft, Kaloupek et al.,
2007; Taft, Street, Marshall, Dowdall, & Riggs, 2007).

PTSD symptoms have been associated with intimate aggression perpetration, even when
considering a range of other factors such as early life stressors, personality disorders, and war-
zone stressor exposure variables (e.g., Orcutt et al., 2003). Evidence suggests that the PTSD
hyperarousal symptom cluster is salient with respect to aggressive behavior; hyperarousal
symptoms are an especially strong relative predictor of intimate partner (Savarese, Suvak,
King, & King, 2001) and general aggression (Taft, Kaloupek et al., 2007) perpetration among
samples of Vietnam veterans. Taft, Street, and colleagues (2007) recently demonstrated that
trait anger mediates the effects of PTSD symptoms on physical and psychological aggression
perpetration in a sample of Vietnam veterans. Thus, it appears that difficulties in regulating
anger may represent a particularly important component of hyperarousal with respect to the
perpetration of aggression.

Several studies have examined the role of comorbid conditions in the association between
PTSD and intimate partner aggression. Savarese, Suvak, King, and King (2001) found
interactions between alcohol use dimensions and PTSD hyperarousal symptoms on intimate
partner physical aggression perpetration such that more frequent, but smaller, quantities of
alcohol use diminished the association between hyperarousal and aggression. Larger quantities
of alcohol paired with more frequent use strengthened the association between hyperarousal
and physical aggression. Taft and colleagues (2005) found that PTSD-positive male veterans
who were physically aggressive toward relationship partners were higher on major depression,
drug abuse/dependence, and war-zone atrocity exposure, and lower on marital adjustment than
nonviolent veterans with PTSD. These findings suggest that conditions and problems that
commonly co-occur with PTSD also play an important role in the association between PTSD
and intimate aggression perpetration against partners.

Emerging Research with OEF/OIF Veterans

The published research on OEF/OIF veterans and their intimate relationships has been mostly
descriptive in nature. Using data collected as part of the large longitudinal Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research Land Combat Study (Hoge, Auchterlonie, & Milliken, 2006; Hoge,

Castro, & Messer, 2004), Milliken and colleagues (2007) documented a four-fold increase in
reported interpersonal problems from the first to second waves of assessment (median of six
months) in their longitudinal study of over 88,000 Soldiers who served in Iraq. The authors
comment on the cumulative burden of mental health problems on family relationships, call for
greater mental health resources for family members, and suggest that family members can serve
as an important conduit to treatment to overcome the documented stigma associated with
military service members and veterans accessing mental health care.

Consistent with this study, Sayers and colleagues (2009) found high rates of family difficulties
among recently returned veterans who screened positive for mental health problems in a VA
outpatient treatment clinic. More than three-quarters of the married/partnered service members
in their sample reported difficulties with partners or children. PTSD and major depression were
especially associated with difficulties in family role adjustment.

Other studies of OEF/OIF veterans have found that PTSD symptoms are associated with more
intimate relationship discord. For instance, in a study of recently returned male Soldiers
(Nelson Goff, Crow, Reisbig, & Hamilton, 2007), self-reported PTSD symptom severity was
inversely related to the Soldiers’ intimate relationship satisfaction. The Soldiers’ dissociation
and anxiety were inversely related to satisfaction for both members of the couple. A recent
study of male National Guard members deployed to Iraq and their wives has extended our
understanding of the association between PTSD and intimate relationship problems by
examining the role of cognitive variables in these associations. The association between the
wives’ relationship satisfaction and their husbands’ PTSD symptoms depended on the wives’
perceptions of the husbands’ combat experiences (Renshaw, Rodrigues, & Jones, 2008). Wives
reported higher levels of marital distress when they perceived that their husbands had
experienced low levels of combat exposure and their husbands reported high levels of PTSD
symptoms. When wives perceived their husbands to have experienced high levels of combat,
however, husbands’ self-reported PTSD symptoms had no association with their wives’
relationship satisfaction. This suggests that wives’ attributions and perceptions of husbands’
combat experiences, and particularly differences between the partners in this regard, serve as
an important contributor to post-deployment intimate relationship difficulties.

In sum, available evidence from studies of veterans from prior eras, as well as the most recent
cohort of veterans, indicates that PTSD is strongly associated with intimate relationship
problems and a number of other indices of family adjustment difficulties. It appears that, at
least for men, it is not combat exposure per se that directly leads to intimate relationship
problems, but rather the post-traumatic psychopathology that can ensue following combat
exposure that is the primary determinant of post-combat relationship difficulties. Spouse/
partner attributions regarding military trauma experiences may also play a role with respect to
the couples’ relationship satisfaction. When examining different PTSD symptom clusters,
avoidance/numbing symptoms appear to have a particularly strong association with overall
relationship satisfaction, and hyperarousal symptoms are especially related to aggressive
behavior and abuse in relationships. Other problems that often co-occur with PTSD, such as
substance use and depression, may further increase risk for intimate relationship problems.

Brief Review of Treatment Outcome Efforts Involving Intimate Partners

Based on research with veterans from prior eras, the type of couple therapy with the most
evidence supporting its efficacy for individual psychopathology and the relationship problems
associated with these problems is behavioral/cognitive-behavioral therapy, hereafter
collectively referred to as Behavioral Conjoint Therapies (BCT) because of their historical
behavioral roots. There have been two completed controlled trials of conjoint therapy for PTSD
in general, and both of them involved a generic form of BCT with a focus on improving the

overall relationship milieu in which the veteran resides. In the larger of these trials, Glynn and
colleagues (1999) used a serial trial design in which they randomly assigned 42 Vietnam
veterans to directed therapeutic exposure (DTE; Carroll & Foy, 1992) only, DTE followed by
BCT, or wait list. The vast majority of the significant others who participated in the study
(approximately 90%) were the veterans’ romantic partners. Both treatment conditions
improved more than wait list on what the authors refer to as “positive” PTSD symptoms (i.e.,
reexperiencing, hyperarousal) but not the “negative” symptoms of PTSD (i.e., avoidance,
numbing) or social adjustment. There were no statistically significant differences between DTE
and DTE + BCT in PTSD symptom improvement, likely due to sample size and the high
dropout rate of participants by the time they received the BCT intervention. However, there
was a moderate effect size advantage (d = .46) for improvements in positive symptoms for the
group who received DTE+BCT compared with the group who received DTE alone. Participants
who completed BCT also showed significantly more improvements in interpersonal problem-
solving than did participants who did not receive BCT.

Sweany (1987) randomly assigned 14 couples in which the male partner suffered from combat-
related PTSD to generic group BCT or a wait list condition. Those in the BCT group received
eight, two-hour weekly sessions focused on increasing positive interactions, improving
communication and problem-solving skills, and enhancing intimacy. Post-treatment, those
receiving BCT self-reported significant improvements in relationship satisfaction, depression,
and PTSD symptoms compared with those in the control group.

There have been three uncontrolled trials of BCT for veterans with PTSD. One consisted of
generic BCT delivered in a group, and the others were disorder-specific BCTs specifically
designed to treat PTSD symptoms and concurrent relationship problems. Cahoon (1984)
reported the results of a seven-week group BCT focused on communication and problem-
solving training for combat veterans and their female partners. Group leaders reported
statistically significant improvements in veterans’ PTSD symptoms and coping abilities (d = .
47 and. 72, respectively) and female partners reported significant improvements in intimate
relationship satisfaction and problem-solving communication (d = .34 and.56, respectively).
However, the veterans did not report improvements in problem-solving or emotional
communication skills (d = .41 and.18, respectively).

Sautter and colleagues (2009) have developed Strategic Approach Therapy (SAT), a 10-session
manualized BCT specifically designed to target the avoidance/numbing symptoms of PTSD.
Findings from six veteran couples who completed the intervention indicate significant
improvements in these symptoms according to patient, partner, and clinician ratings. There
were also significant improvements in the veterans’ self-reported total PTSD symptoms but
not re-experiencing or hyperarousal symptoms. The authors did not assess relationship
adjustment in this pilot study; thus, the potential effects of the intervention on dyadic
functioning or the utility of the intervention for couples with different levels of distress is not
yet known.

Cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy (CBCT) for PTSD (Monson & Fredman, in press) is the
only disorder-specific BCT designed to ameliorate all of the symptoms of PTSD and to enhance
relationship functioning concurrently. The 15-session, manualized treatment has three stages
involving psychoeducation about the dynamic interplay between PTSD and relationship
difficulties. The specific treatment components consist of conflict management strategies to
enhance safety, behavioral interventions to decrease avoidance and improve dyadic
communication, and dyadic cognitive interventions to address maladaptive thinking patterns
that maintain both PTSD symptoms and relationship distress. Monson and colleagues (2004)
reported the results of an uncontrolled pilot study of Vietnam veterans with combat-related
PTSD and their wives. There were statistically significant and large effect size improvements

in clinicians’ (d = 1.60) and partners’ (d = 1.18) ratings of veterans’ PTSD symptoms from
pre- to post-treatment. By comparison, the veterans reported moderate improvements in PTSD
(d = 0.64) and statistically significant and large effect size improvements in depression (d =
1.55), anxiety (d = 1.01), and social functioning (d = 1.0 across domains). For their part, wives
reported large effect size improvements in relationship satisfaction (d = − 0.92), general anxiety
(d = 1.29), and social functioning (d ~ 1.0 for all domains of social functioning) (Monson,
Stevens, & Schnurr, 2005). More recent application of the therapy to both veterans and non-
veterans with PTSD has revealed statistically significant and large effect size improvements
in clinicians’ (d = 1.47), patients’ (d = 1.35), and partners’ (d = 1.56) ratings of patients’ PTSD
symptoms from pre- to post-treatment. Partners also reported large effect size improvements
(d = 1.41) in relationship satisfaction in both partners (Monson et al., 2009).

Other efforts to include family members in veterans’ treatment have been described in the
literature, but minimal outcome data have yet been published to support their efficacy. For
example, Johnson (2002)’s Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy (EFT) for trauma survivors
has been described in a book that includes case examples of its application to combat trauma.
Similarly, Erbes, Polusny, MacDermid, and Compton (2008) have described the application
of integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT; Jacobson & Christensen, 1996), a form of
BCT, for combat veterans with PTSD. As described by the authors and illustrated with a case
example, IBCT may be well-suited to the conjoint treatment of PTSD given the combination
of acceptance strategies and traditional BCT techniques to decrease both relationship conflict
and experiential avoidance. Sherman’s (2003) Support and Family Education (S.A.F.E.)
Program, a multi-session educational program for families dealing with a wide range of mental
illnesses, has been used in cases in which at least one member of the family suffers from PTSD.
Program evaluation data indicate high satisfaction with the program by family members, but
no outcome data for patients with PTSD or other psychological problems were reported. Two
different intensive residential programs for veterans with PTSD have included significant
others in treatment, and the authors reported some positive effects for individual or relationship
functioning (Devilly, 2002; Rabin & Nardi, 1991).

There have been increasing efforts to incorporate significant others into the prevention and
treatment of military service members’ and veterans’ mental health and intimate relationship
problems specifically in the OEF/OIF cohort. With regard to relationship distress prevention
efforts for current military personnel, the Army has invested in the Strong Bonds program for
families (www.strongbonds.org), which includes a program specifically for couples (Strong
Bonds for Couples). Strong Bonds for Couples is delivered in a weekend retreat format by
Army chaplains and focuses on relationship enrichment through enhanced communication and
intimacy. The original developers of the Premarital Enhancement Program (PREP; Markman,
Stanley, Blumberg, Jenkins, & Whiteley, 2004) have also adapted and tested their program for
Army couples as delivered by Army chaplains with promising results (Building Strong and
Ready Families; Stanley et al., 2005). In addition, we are currently developing and testing a
multi-couple group prevention intervention funded by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention aimed at decreasing the likelihood of intimate partner perpetration in OEF/OIF
veterans diagnosed with PTSD (Taft, Monson, Feldner, Murphy, & Resick, 2007–2012).

In summary, a growing body of research suggests that involving partners and close family
members in treatment for PTSD is beneficial. Research suggests that generic conjoint/family
therapies can lead to improvements in PTSD symptoms, most likely by decreasing ambient
interpersonal stress that can exacerbate individual symptoms. Some BCTs tested to date have
led to improvements in certain PTSD symptom clusters, which we attribute to the explicit
targets of these interventions (e.g., SAT specifically focuses on avoidance symptoms).
Disorder-specific conjoint treatments for PTSD that aim to simultaneously improve both PTSD
symptoms and relationship impairments appear to hold particular promise by improving the

overall affective climate that the patient resides in, while also targeting the mechanisms that
account for problems in both areas (e.g., addressing cognitions that maintain PTSD and are
related to relationship discord). As additional basic research is conducted on the association
of PTSD and relationship difficulties, it is expected that new, increasingly targeted and efficient
conjoint treatments for PTSD will be developed to assist veterans and their loved ones.

Advancing Theory Accounting for PTSD and Intimate Relationship Problems

There have been a few constructs and fewer theories put forth to account for the well-
documented association between PTSD and intimate relationship problems. We believe that
study of the connection between PTSD and intimate relationship functioning is sorely in need
of theory development and testing to further understanding of these associations and ultimately
advance prevention and treatments efforts aimed at both areas. These constructs/theories can
be broadly classified based on their assumptions about the direction of causality between PTSD
and intimate relationship problems. Only a few theories have been put forth postulating a
reciprocally-determined association between individual PTSD and couple/family problems

PTSD as a Cause of Intimate Relationship Problems

Most of the constructs and theories put forth to date have presumed a causal pathway from
traumatization or PTSD to intimate relationship problems. Secondary or vicarious
traumatization in close loved ones is one such construct (Figley, 1989; McCann & Pearlman,
1990; Solomon et al., 1992). Buttressing this construct, several studies have documented an
association between veterans’ PTSD symptoms and symptoms of PTSD or more general
psychological distress in intimate partners (Jordan et al., 1992; Waysman, Mikulincer,
Solomon, & Weisenberg, 1993; Westerink & Giarratano, 1999) However, studies with children
of veterans with PTSD have not consistently documented an association between veterans’
PTSD symptoms and child PTSD and/or behavioral problems (Ahmadzadeh & Malekian,
2004; Beckham et al., 1997; Davidson & Mellor, 2001; Davidson, Smith, & Kudler, 1989;
Souzzia & Motta, 2004; Westerink & Giarratano, 1999).

This construct has suffered inconsistency in the operationalization of it when studied. For
example, partners have not generally anchored their reported PTSD symptoms to the veterans’
traumatic experience when completing self-report measures of PTSD symptomatology, which
raises questions about whether the symptoms are related to partners’ general distress/
psychopathology or their own trauma experiences, or the veterans’ specific trauma experiences.
Moreover, partners’ distress may or may not be related to the trauma experience itself versus
living with the related psychopathology in their loved one.

Caregiver burden, or caregivers’ perception that their emotional or physical health, social life,
or financial status is affected by their caring for an impaired relative (Zarit, Todd, & Zarit,
1986), is another construct that has been put forth to account for veterans’ couple/family
relationship problems. Several studies have documented an association between the severity
of veterans’ PTSD symptoms and degree of caregiver burden in intimate partners. In turn,
caregiver burden has been associated with intimate partners’ psychological distress both cross-
sectionally and longitudinally (e.g., Calhoun, Beckham, & Bosworth, 2002; Dekel, Solomon,
& Bleich, 2005; Manguno-Mire et al., 2007). Similarly, ambiguous loss, which is defined as
the experience of psychological absence with physical presence of a loved one (Boss, 1999,
2007), has been applied to intimate relationships and PTSD and shown to be associated with
psychological difficulties in intimate others (Dekel, Goldblatt, Keidar, Solomon, & Polliack,
2005). According to this theory, the uncertainty or lack of information about the whereabouts
or status of a loved one as absent or present negatively affects individuals, couples, and families
(Boss, 1999). A qualitative study of wives of Israeli veterans with PTSD provides some support
for ambiguous loss associated with PTSD in that ambiguity in wives’ perceptions of whether

the spouse is a husband or another child, and whether he is an independent adult or a dependent
person who needs constant care, was associated with psychological distress in the women
(Dekel, Solomon et al., 2005).

All of these constructs presume that traumatization or PTSD cause intimate relationship
problems or individual distress in significant others in relation to those with PTSD. We argue
that intimate relationship problems are just as likely to serve as impediments to recovery. For
example, traumatized individuals who exist in a critical, hostile interpersonal environment that
may not only be unsupportive but also characterized by victim blame or other negative beliefs
or behaviors on the part of significant others may be particularly susceptible to PTSD.

Couple/Family Functioning as Contributor to the Onset or Exacerbation of PTSD

An exception to the tendency to presume that PTSD causes interpersonal relationship problems
is the literature on social support. Meta-analysis reveals that social support is one of the factors
most robustly and negatively associated with PTSD symptoms (Brewin, Andrews, &
Valentine, 2000). Social support in the acute aftermath of trauma has been found to be related
to less PTSD symptomatology, but has also been documented to diminish over time in the
presence of chronic PTSD (e.g., Kaniasty & Norris, 2008; King, Taft, King, Hammond, &
Stone, 2006). The longitudinal course of social support is perhaps one of the most important
facets to understanding the PTSD-intimate relationship problem connection.

An additional future direction in the study of social support in trauma recovery is determining
the specific aspects of social support that account for the association between social support
and PTSD. For example, some have argued that social support promotes recovery by supportive
others correcting problematic trauma appraisals (Joseph, Williams, & Yule, 1997). Other
possible mechanisms may exist, including less avoidance of trauma-related cues because of
increased social activity, practical/logistic supports provide by others that can be diminished
post-traumatization, or modeling of tolerance of negative emotional states on the part of
supportive others. The developmental course of social support in trauma recovery and
elucidation of the specific factors involved in the social-support and PTSD connection are
important areas in need of further investigation.

Theories Presuming a Bidirectional Association

We are aware of only two more fully elaborated models that account for the likely reciprocally
causal association between intimate relationship problems and PTSD. Nelson Goff and Smith
(2005) put forth the Couple Adaptation to Traumatic Stress (CATS) model. The CATS model
provides a systemic description of how individuals and couples are affected when trauma
occurs. The model proposes that adaptation to traumatic stress in the couple is dependent on
the systemic interaction of three different levels of factors: individual level of functioning of
each of the partners, predisposing factors and resources, and couple functioning.

The model assumes that a survivor’s level of functioning or trauma symptoms will set in motion
a systemic response with the potential to result in secondary traumatic stress symptoms in the
partner. However, because the model is bi-directional, partners’ reactions and symptoms may
intensify trauma-related symptoms in the survivor. Individual and couple functioning are
determined by predisposing factors and resources (McClubbin & Patterson, 1982), which refer
to individual characteristics or unresolved stress experienced by either partner prior to the
trauma. Lastly, in between the individual and predisposition layers, there is a “couple
functioning” system, which relates to the level and quality of variables such as, relationship
satisfaction, support/nurturance, intimacy, communication, and conflict, which are described
as mutually influential components of the dyad system. They postulate that there are several
mechanisms that may underlie the systemic response to traumatic stress in couples, including

chronic stress, attachment, identification and empathy, projective identification, and conflict
and physiological response models.

Monson, Fredman and Dekel (in press) have put forth a cognitive-behavioral interpersonal
theory of PTSD that encompasses the associations between PTSD and romantic and non-
romantic adult close relationship functioning. They postulate that there are behavioral,
cognitive, and emotional variables that dynamically interact within each individual. In turn,
these factors in each individual interact at the dyadic level to influence the relationship milieu
shared by the dyad, as well as the components acting within each individual. In other words,
there are within and between individual cognitive, behavioral, and affective interactions that
influence the individuals involved and the relationship that they co-create.

An additional important assumption to Monson and colleagues’ theory is that PTSD is a
disorder characterized by disturbances in a range of emotions in addition to anxiety (e.g., guilt,
shame, anger, grief). They also expand the notion of avoidance to include the avoidance of
emotional experience and expression. Emotional process disturbances such as alexithymia and
difficulties with identifying and expressing emotions have been associated with PTSD (e.g.,
Monson, Price, Rodriguez, Ripley, & Warner, 2004). These emotional content and process
disturbances are suspected to contribute to emotional communication deficits and their related
relationship impairments.

Their theory draws on intrapersonal behavioral conceptualizations of PTSD such as the role
of learning processes that account for the development and maintenance of emotional
responding (e.g., Mowrer, 1960). Consistent with these theories, avoidance of trauma-related
stimuli and emotions is key to maintenance of the disorder. Interpersonally, significant others’
well-intended caretaking behaviors can serve to promote or maintain avoidant behavior. In this
way, the significant others’ behavior “accommodates” the disorder. Examples of behavioral
accommodation include a significant other managing their loved ones’ interactions with others,
facilitating “work arounds” in the PTSD-identified partner’s activities of daily living (e.g.,
driving them everywhere in the case of a combat transportation accident, accompanying them
to “protect their safety”). Some loved ones consider these behaviors expressions of their
affection for their distressed loved one; others feel angry or resentful about taking on extra,
burdensome responsibilities. Irrespective of intentionality, these behaviors inadvertently
reinforce the traumatized individual’s avoidance and interfere with his or her recovery from
PTSD. Behavioral accommodation can also diminish close relationship satisfaction through
less engagement in mutually reinforcing activities, constriction of affective expression, and
limited self-disclosure, including trauma-related disclosure.

An additional behavioral mechanism in their theory accounting for the association between
relationship problems and PTSD is poor communication. There is long-standing evidence of
communication deficits in those with PTSD (e.g., Frueh, Turner, Beidel, & Cahill, 2001). These
communication deficits are theorized to maintain the disorder and contribute to relationship
problems because of difficulties with effective trauma disclosure and poor conflict resolution
and management. Trauma disclosure in an encouraging and supportive environment can lead
to the development of a more cogent trauma narrative and emotional processing of traumatic
memories. Limited conflict management and problem-solving skills are also theorized to
mediate the relationship between the hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD and aggressive
relationship behavior.

Monson and colleagues postulate that there are also inter-related cognitive processes and
thematic content that account for the association between PTSD and close relationship
problems. Individual and dyadic dysfunction is theorized to arise from reliance on enduring,
rigid, and maladaptive schemas in making meaning of experiences. Borrowing from earlier

work by McCann and Pearlman (1990), also found in cognitive processing therapy (Resick,
Monson, & Chard, 2007), schemas related to safety, trust, power, esteem, and intimacy are
disrupted as a result of the trauma and are pertinent to close relationship functioning. With
regard to cognitive process variables, filtered attention and memory biases toward negative
and threatening behavior has been found in both PTSD and intimate relationship distress
(Baucom & Epstein, 1995; Ehlers & Clark, 2000).

Future Directions

There are a number of questions that remain unanswered about PTSD and the myriad of
intimate relationship maladies that co-occur with it. We believe that one of the foremost
challenges in this field is the refinement of theories that can account for the likely interacting
and recursive effects of these individual and couple-level problems. Well-articulated theories
will also need to take into account the developmental course of PTSD and intimate relationship
functioning. Prospective research designs, paired with advanced statistical modeling
techniques, can then begin to test these theories. Some of the most pressing issues to be
answered in these models include discerning the role of relationship variables in trauma
recovery in the acute period of recovery, or development of PTSD, versus their role in the
persistence of the disorder, and vice versa. Longitudinal, laboratory-based paradigms and daily
diary methods may be particularly well-suited to examining such questions in this work. Also,
much more investigation needs to be done to isolate the unique relationship between PTSD
and family functioning measures when accounting for other forms of psychopathology, and
we have much to learn about how PTSD may interact with physical trauma (e.g., traumatic
brain injury) to lead to family difficulties.

A relatively unchartered but exciting area for future research is investigation of the interacting
cognitive variables underlying the PTSD-intimate relationship connection. Renshaw and
colleagues’ (2008) work previously described on the moderating effect of partners’ perceptions
of Soldiers’ trauma exposure and Monson and colleagues’ (2009) research on couples’
interacting trauma-relevant beliefs in individual post-disaster adjustment are illustrative of
these efforts. In addition, continued work on the role of disclosure following a traumatic event
is also warranted, and especially in light of concerns about possible secondary or vicarious
traumatization in veterans’ loved ones. For example, is disclosure of all types and forms of
trauma beneficial for the traumatized individual? What are the potentially positive and negative
effects on intimate relationship functioning and the person bearing witness to the disclosure?
In this vein, more fine-grained research that carefully operationalizes vicarious or secondary
traumatization is needed. We postulate that the untoward effects of traumatization on loved
ones are much more likely to arise as a consequence of living with someone with the symptoms
of PTSD than the traumatized person sharing about his/her specific trauma. That said, careful
empirical research is needed to test these assertions.

Nearly all research heretofore on the association between PTSD and intimate relationship
problems has been done with samples of heterosexual male veterans who have had chronic
PTSD for years. In these times of a growing number of women who are serving in a range of
positions in frontless wars, we need to better understand the potentially different associations
between PTSD and intimate relationship functioning by gender. In addition, we need to conduct
research on these associations in same sex couples. We are aware of no empirical research on
this topic, in spite of high rates of victimization in sexual minorities (e.g., Balsam, Rothblum,
& Beauchaine, 2005) and some unique relationship characteristics of these couples (Kurdek,
2005).

Although this review was focused on intimate adult relationships, it is important to point out
that there are a range of close others that can affect and be affected by a veteran’s PTSD. As

reviewed above, there is an association between poorer parenting satisfaction and PTSD, and
there is some evidence of greater behavior problems in the children of parents with PTSD (e.g.,
Ahmadzadeh & Malekian, 2004). More research is needed on broader family functioning and
the effects of parental PTSD on children in order to better intervene at the family and parent-
child dyad level. Moreover, a significant proportion of veterans are not in a longer-term
romantic relationship. Parents, siblings, close friends, and/or fellow veterans may be the
veteran’s family.

There is exciting work on the horizon as it relates to including veterans’ family members in
prevention and treatment efforts. We look forward to reviewing the research that continues to
unfold documenting the value of couple-based prevention strategies in warding off future
relationship problems and improving individual functioning in service members’ and their
partners and children. With regard to treatment of PTSD and intimate relationship problems
after they have developed, we believe that one of the pressing questions to be more
systematically addressed is how family members can be used to facilitate engagement in mental
health treatment in this cohort of veterans. Anecdotally, we have treated several OEF/OIF
veterans who have commented that, if not for their wives’ urging they would not have sought
treatment for their PTSD and other mental health and substance use problems. There has been
discussion about the role of family members in overcoming stigma and facilitating engagement,
but this discussion has been met with minimal empirical research (see Manguno-Mire et al.,
2007, for exception).

Another important question to be answered in this arena is how conjoint/family therapies for
PTSD will stack up against existing evidence-based therapies designed to improve PTSD and
intimate relationship functioning. A trial comparing our CBCT for PTSD to Prolonged
Exposure in a sample of active duty service members and their intimate partners has been
funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. We also need to determine whether generic couple/
family therapies will reduce PTSD symptoms and improve relationship functioning as well as
the emerging PTSD-specific couple/family interventions. This research has important health
services implications in terms of developing staff capacity to deliver more or less complicated
interventions. Down the road, there are interesting dismantling study designs that will help
elucidate the active ingredients of these interventions and increase the efficiency in delivering
them (e.g., trauma-focused interventions may not be necessary to achieve equivalent treatment
gains).

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have brought greater attention to the consequences of military
trauma exposure on the individual, but also on the intimate relationships and loved ones of
those who serve. There has been significant progress in explicating the role of intimate
relationship functioning on PTSD and vice versa, but the work is not yet complete. As
increasing numbers of veterans return from war, it is imperative that we continue to conduct
basic research on the interpersonal processes that affect their adjustment and innovate
prevention and treatment interventions for them and their loved ones. We remain hopeful that
these efforts will result in improvements in healthcare and ultimately the well-being of our
newest generation of veterans and their families.
