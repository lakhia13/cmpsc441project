Abstract: Mental illness, deemed globally to account for 32% of years lived with a disability, generates
significant impacts on workplaces. In particular, healthcare workers experience high rates of mental
ill health such as burnout, stress, and depression due to workplace conditions including excessive
workloads, workplace violence and bullying, which also produces negative effects on patients as well as
on the happiness and wellbeing of those who remain at work. This review was undertaken to synthesize
the evidence on workplace-based interventions at the organizational level promoting mental health and
wellbeing among healthcare workers, to identify what has been receiving attention in this area and why,
especially considering how such positive effects are produced. A search of three premier health-related
databases identified 1290 articles that discussed healthcare workers, workplace interventions, and
mental health. Following further examination, 46 articles were ultimately selected as meeting the
criteria specifying interventions at the organizational level and combined with similar studies included
in a relevant Cochrane review. The 60 chosen articles were then analyzed following a realist framework
analyzing context, mechanism, and outcome. Most of the studies included in the realist review
were conducted in high-income countries, and the types of organizational-level interventions studied
included skills and knowledge development, leadership development, communication and team
building, stress management as well as workload and time management. Common themes from the
realist review highlight the importance of employee engagement in the intervention development and
implementation process. The literature review also supports the recognized need for more research on
mental health and happiness in low- and middle-income countries, and for studies evaluating the
longer-term effects of workplace mental health promotion.

Keywords: mental health; occupational mental health; healthcare workers; mental health promotion

1. Introduction

Mental illness is estimated to globally account for 32.4% of years lived with a disability [1] and to
generate signiﬁcant impacts on workplaces with depression and anxiety disorders costing US$1 trillion
dollars in lost productivity in 2017 [2]. As evidence of the growing recognition of mental ill health in

the workplace, in May 2019, the World Health Organization for the ﬁrst time classiﬁed burnout as an
“occupational phenomenon” in the eleventh revision of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases [3].
There is also an expanding awareness of not only absence and the direct costs due to mental ill health,
but also the eﬀects on workers who remain on the job. Employers are increasingly paying attention to
presenteeism—decreased productivity due to health problems—by employees who remain present at
work [4]. Indeed, presenteeism has been shown to contribute a larger economic cost than absenteeism
and employer health costs [5]. With the economic burden so high, the relative returns from investing in
mental health are favorable: every dollar invested in scaling up treatment for common mental illnesses
such as depression and anxiety leads to a four-fold return in better health and ability to work [6].

In the workplace, there are multiple factors recognized to be determinants of workers’ mental
health [7]. These include high job demand, low job control, low workplace social support, eﬀort-reward
imbalance, low organizational procedural justice, low organizational relational justice, organizational
change, job insecurity, temporary employment status, atypical working hours, bullying, and role
stress [8]. In addition, non-work determinants such as family status and social support networks
are also important predictors of workers’ mental health [9]. The healthcare workplace, in particular,
experiences high rates of mental illness such as burnout, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety,
and depression [10–14] due to workplace conditions such as excessive workloads [15–20], working in
emotionally-charged situations [21], stigma against seeking care [22], and workplace violence [23,24],
among other factors. Mental ill health of healthcare workers has additionally been associated with
an increased risk of patient safety incidents, poorer quality of care due to low professionalism, and
reduced patient satisfaction [25]; medical errors [26,27]; quality of care, patient falls, medication errors,
and infections [28]; lower patient satisfaction [29]; and patient safety outcomes [30]. Poor mental
health of healthcare workers further aﬀects healthcare systems by intensifying shortages among the
workforce as a result of a reduction in work eﬀort or those leaving the practice [16,31] as well as the
signiﬁcant economic costs this generates [32].

Over and above the substantial burden of mental illness and ill health, the value of positive
mental health and wellness has been increasingly recognized and captured through constructs such
as happiness, an approach receiving growing international attention such as by the United Nations’
High-Level Meeting on Wellbeing and Happiness in 2012. This orientation conforms well with the
World Health Organization’s deﬁnition of health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social
wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or inﬁrmity” [33]. For the purposes of this review, the
term “mental health” herein encompasses both positive and negative conceptions of mental wellbeing.
Although there has been an increase in mental health promotion and prevention programs globally,
only 7% of such initiatives are workplace-based [34]. Indeed, the Global Happiness Policy Report
(2018) calls for more research to expand the causal evidence base on work and wellbeing, and to
evaluate workplace interventions promoting worker wellbeing [35]. In 2015, a Cochrane systematic
review evaluated evidence on the eﬀectiveness of interventions to prevent occupational stress in
healthcare workers [36], but was restricted to studies measuring work-related stress and/or burnout by
using validated tools. As such, application of a more holistic deﬁnition of mental health including a
broader scope of mental health outcomes such as the psychosocial work environment and satisfaction
is warranted to appreciate the potential beneﬁts of improving work environments. Furthermore,
the Cochrane review included only quantitative studies meeting stringent conditions: randomized
controlled trials for individual-level interventions, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted
time series for organizational-level interventions excluding cross-sectional and qualitative studies that
could contribute to better understanding the eﬀectiveness of interventions in various situations.

To explore the practical challenges of understanding how workplace-based organizational
interventions work eﬀectively in multidimensional and unavoidably diverse healthcare contexts,
the realist review method provides a more nuanced approach for ascertaining what works for whom,
in what circumstances, in what respects and how [37], rather than deﬁnitively assessing the eﬃcacy of a
relatively standard intervention producing a discrete outcome. This orientation is well suited to address

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4396

3 of 22

the recognized need for greater focus on the process of organizational interventions including the why
and how of successful (and unsuccessful) interventions [38]. While we note that a realist review is
currently being undertaken to address mental illness in physicians [39], there is a need to equally take
stock of the impacts of interventions on nurses, midwives, and other healthcare professionals as well
as other healthcare support staﬀ. Accordingly, in examining the question of how can workplace-based
organizational interventions improve the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare workers, we
elected to conduct a realist review that takes into consideration (a) a wider deﬁnition of outcomes of
interest; (b) diverse study designs worthy for inclusion in realist analyses; and (c) a comprehensive
range of healthcare workers.

2. Methods

2.1. Search Strategy

In our exploratory review of literature relevant to our question of interest, we surveyed research
in the areas of global mental health, mental health and the workplace, mental health and the healthcare
workplace, mental wellbeing and happiness, happiness and the workplace, workplace-based mental
health interventions, and workplace-based mental health interventions for healthcare workers. A search
of MEDLINE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and PsycINFO was
conducted in November 2018 (see Appendix A: Search Terms). MEDLINE was selected based on
its extensive and premier coverage of health and biomedical research. CINAHL was selected to
additionally capture studies related to nursing and allied health professionals. PsycINFO was selected
for its command of psychology, which is particularly relevant for the subject area of the review: mental
health. All three databases were searched for journal articles published since the inception of the
respective databases (i.e., there were no restrictions placed on the dates of coverage).

2.2. Selection and Appraisal of Documents

The database search (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) initially yielded 1496 articles.
After duplicates were removed, 1290 articles remained. The titles and abstracts of the 1290 articles
were then screened, primarily looking at the target population (healthcare workers), intervention
(workplace-based), and outcome (mental health including positive concepts of mental health). A broad
scope of “mental health” was intentionally adopted including positive constructs such as psychological
resilience, quality of life, life satisfaction, and happiness as well as negative constructs such as
stress, burnout, and mental disorders (more speciﬁc inclusion and exclusion criteria for the full
selection and appraisal process is listed below in Table 1). Based on the title and abstract review,
1012 articles were excluded, leaving 278 articles for full-text assessment. Following the full-text
review, 177 articles were excluded (see Figure 1). The remaining 101 articles were then classiﬁed
by the category of workplace-based intervention by using the three categories from the Cochrane
review: cognitive-behavioral, relaxation, and organizational, which were developed by the authors
of the Cochrane review as there is no major framework available for categorizing preventive stress
interventions [36]. As this realist review is focused on organizational-level interventions, the articles
categorized as cognitive-behavioral and relaxation were excluded (n = 55). Then, the studies on
organizational interventions included in the Cochrane review were added (n = 21), which included all
of the articles included in the organizational category even if they were not included in the Cochrane
review’s meta-analysis. Then, duplicates (n = 4) and studies on students and trainees (n = 2) were
removed. In addition, an article that did not cover the implementation of an intervention was removed.
This left the ﬁnal set of articles to include for the synthesis (n = 60). Five of the 60 were articles on
the same study(ies) as other article(s), and therefore their analysis was combined to represent one
study/intervention. Thus, this review comprises 55 unique studies represented in 60 research articles
(listed in Table 2; a full summary of the included articles is available in Table S1). The speciﬁc inclusion
and exclusion criteria used for the selection of articles is as follows.

2.3. Data Extraction

General demographic and characteristic information extracted from the selected studies were
country where the study took place; type of healthcare worker (nurse, physician, etc.); type of healthcare
workplace (hospital, residential care facility, etc.); and type of specialized care, if applicable (e.g.,
intensive care unit, emergency medicine, etc.). These characteristics were selected to provide a summary
of the locations and participants who have been included in studies to date as well as to provide an
overview of the contexts for the studies.

Each study was summarized using a realist framework comprising a brief description of the
context including why and how the intervention occurred; a brief description of the underlying
mechanism for how the intervention was intended to work; and, a brief description of the outcome.
These were selected to facilitate the analysis and synthesis of the studies using the realist framework
of context–mechanism–outcome.

Methods of each study were also summarized comprising a brief description of the intervention
itself; the type of study design; length of the follow-up period, if applicable; the construct/measure(s)
of mental health used in the study; and, whether or not there was an improvement in the
construct/measure(s) of mental health. These were selected to provide a summary of the research
methods used and to compare the types of interventions studied and methods used. The wide range
of mental health outcome constructs/measures used in the selected studies—intentionally included to
encompass a broad deﬁnition of mental health and wellness—precluded the extraction of quantitative
measures of outcomes.

Finally, any other ﬁndings and/or relevant notes that the reviewer thought were signiﬁcant for the
purposes of this realist review were noted, in particular ﬁndings and observations related to the realist
framework of context–mechanism–outcome.

2.4. Analysis and Synthesis Processes

The analysis and synthesis followed an iterative process. The selected articles were read and
reviewed by the primary reviewer, during which time the general demographics and characteristics of
each study (as listed above; location of study, type of healthcare workers, type of work environments,
etc.) were documented and summarized across the selection of studies (see Document Characteristics
below). The three elements of the realist framework (context, mechanism, outcome) as well as a brief
description of the intervention were extracted from each of the articles by the primary reviewer in note
form. For the context, the impetus for the intervention and/or a brief description of the initial state
of the workplace was noted if available in the article (e.g., hospital restructuring, high absenteeism,
promising initial evidence, etc.). Contextual factors that were mentioned to have aided, hindered, or
otherwise inﬂuenced the intervention were also noted. For the mechanism, the underlying strategy,
theory and/or functionality of the intervention was noted (e.g., reducing work hours, enhancing
work-related skills, etc.).

In order to facilitate summaries and comparisons across studies, the mechanisms were then also
categorized into the following types, based on the common themes found in the collection of studies:
skills and knowledge development, leadership development, communication and team building, stress
management, or workload and time management. If the intervention comprised more than one type of
mechanism, it was categorized as “mixed”. This was done to facilitate synthesis across the variety of
interventions in the selected studies.

A second review of the articles was then done to extract the following information from each study:
study design, length of follow-up period (if applicable), and measure(s) of mental health. During the
second review, the reviewer also reviewed the information and notes from the ﬁrst review.

The elements of the realist framework from the articles were then analyzed thematically, with
a focus on process-related factors across the studies. The diversity of both mental health constructs
and types of interventions precluded the direct comparison or evaluation of interventions amongst
one another, therefore, the focus was placed on a thematic analysis related to patterns of mechanisms
for developing and implementing workplace-based interventions to promote mental health among
healthcare workers.

Most of the studies (n = 51) were from high-income country contexts with the remaining four
studies from upper middle-income countries, as categorized by the World Bank [100]. The continent
most represented in the studies was Europe (n = 22), followed by North America (n = 21), Asia (n = 6),
and Oceania (n = 5). Only one study was from Africa. Half of the studies (n = 32) were published from
2010 onward. The earliest study was published in 1993.

Most of the studies targeted one type of healthcare worker, with the most common being nursing
staﬀ. Of the studies targeting one particular type of healthcare worker, nurses and nursing staﬀ was
the most common type of healthcare worker (n = 25), followed by physicians (n = 5). Twenty-one

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4396

9 of 22

studies included more than one type of healthcare worker such as nurses, midwives, physicians,
administrative staﬀ, and/or managerial staﬀ.

More than half of the studies (n = 32) emphasized the unique characteristics of certain healthcare
work environments such as residential care facilities and intensive care units, for example, noting
the particular demands and emotionally-charged nature of the work environments. Of the studies
explicitly focusing on a particular type of healthcare service, the most common was elder and/or adult
residential care (n = 11), followed by intensive care (n = 6), mental health/psychiatric care (n = 5),
oncology (n = 4), and emergency medicine (n = 2).

A variety of designs were used in the included studies. The most common study design was
quasi-experimental (n = 17), followed by a randomized trial, either a cluster randomized trial or an
individual randomized trial (n = 15). Other methods used were longitudinal surveys (n = 11), mixed
methods (n = 4), cross-sectional surveys (n = 4), and qualitative methods (n = 4). Of the four mixed
methods studies, two comprised longitudinal surveys and focus groups, one used a retrospective
pre/post survey and interviews, and one used longitudinal and qualitative surveys. The four qualitative
studies all used interviews, with one of the four also using a collective case study method in addition
to interviews.

Among the quasi-experimental studies, randomized trials, longitudinal studies, and the three
mixed method studies with a longitudinal component (n = 46), the duration of follow-up time ranged
from 20 days to 10 years. Eight studies had a follow-up time of less than six months, fourteen studies
had between 6–10 months, and nineteen studies had between 12–24 months. There was one study
each with the follow-up times of three years, four years, seven years, and 10 years. One study did not
indicate the duration of its follow-up time.

There were a variety of constructs of mental health and happiness used in the studies, with most
studies (n = 41) using more than one construct. The most common construct was burnout (n = 27),
followed by stress (n = 19), and job or work satisfaction (n = 14). Other constructs used in the studies
include distress (n = 6), depression (n = 4), psychosocial work environment (n = 3), psychological
wellbeing (n = 2), anxiety (n = 2), psychosomatic symptoms (n = 2), aﬀect (n = 1), and resilience (n = 1),
among others.

The types of interventions most commonly used were skills and knowledge development (n = 13),
followed by communication and team building (n = 10), workload and time management (n = 9),
stress management (n = 7), and leadership development (n = 3). Thirteen studies used mixed types of
interventions (according to this categorization of mechanisms).

Twenty-ﬁve studies found an improvement in their measure of mental health. Seventeen found
an insigniﬁcant or partial improvement including an improvement on only one dimension of a scale,
for example. Three studies found an improvement in the short term, but it was not sustained in the
long term. Ten studies found no improvement or a decline in their measure of mental health.

3.2. Main Findings

Several themes and patterns of mechanisms for developing and implementing interventions

relevant to a realist framework emerged from the analysis.

3.2.1. Stakeholder Engagement and Support

The importance of and necessity for stakeholder engagement has been highlighted repeatedly
in multiple studies. For example, in their process evaluation, Uchiyama et al. [95] found that
continuously engaging with key people such as unit leads was necessary for the intervention’s
successful implementation. Another study highlighted potential issues arising from conﬂicting levels
of support from diﬀerent levels of the organization. In this case, the study was supported by the
hospital administration who compensated the nurses for participation; however, it was not supported
by all of the unit-level managers, who eﬀectively barred participation through how they scheduled
their staﬀ [53]. This includes engagement and support across all levels of the organization, from

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4396

10 of 22

management to frontline workers. In the introduction of a new telemedicine service, Romig et al.
recognized that positive staﬀ perceptions to the new technology would be key to its successful
implementation so they showed the staﬀ the beneﬁts at the outset to help ensure uptake and usage of
the technology [88]. Several studies noted the participatory nature of the interventions—involving
frontline staﬀ in the development and/or implementation of the interventions—as a key success
factor [41,43,44,46,49,54,55,57]. The beneﬁts of a participatory process were even further emphasized
by studies that found the participation process itself as having a positive impact on employees [62,75].

3.2.2. Approaches to Developing Interventions

Common approaches to identify which workplace factors to target in the interventions included
initial engagement with the healthcare workers (e.g., initial baseline study to ﬁnd context-speciﬁc
factors aﬀecting mental health), building on promising earlier research (e.g., following a pilot study),
and/or based on a theory of mental health in the workplace. Some of the studies explicitly included
the theoretical foundation of their intervention, either in combination with local needs or as the sole
basis for a particular intervention target. This, for example, [43,44] targeted four theory-grounded
psychosocial job factors: psychological demands, decision latitude, social support, and eﬀort-reward
imbalance, while Canadian research on improving civility in the work environment was based on the
theoretical model of interpersonal relationships at work [65–67].

3.2.3. Managing Expectations

A few studies noted the challenges and implications related to managing expectations around
workplace mental health promotion activities. For example, Uchiyama et al. noted the lack of
improvement in measures of the psychosocial work environment could be due to the higher expectations
that some employees had based on the issues they were facing in the workplace, for instance, employees
facing issues of workload and compensation may not have felt that interventions addressing team
meeting scheduling and communication met their expectations for workplace improvements [41].
Ultimately, managing expectations could make the diﬀerence between successful and unsuccessful
implementation. For example, Aust et al. identiﬁed the mismatch between employees’ expectations
and program delivery as one of the reasons why the intervention “failed” (the psychosocial work
environment at the hospital worsened by their measurement after the intervention) [42]. Conversely,
elevated expectations for the interventions could have the opposite eﬀect, inﬂating the true beneﬁts of
the mental health promotion activities based on employees’ positive expectations and hope for the
change. For example, Bryan et al. found that the nurses’ “excitement for change” likely contributed to
the observed short-term increase followed by a subsequent decrease in job satisfaction [45].

3.2.4. Complexity of Evaluating Organizational-Level Interventions

A theme that emerged from the studies was the complexity of evaluating organizational-level
interventions, in particular due to factors external to the study that can impact the outcome. For example,
Proctor et al. [82] found no change in psychological distress among the intervention group, however,
there were organizational and managerial changes that happened to occur at the same time as the study.
The control group increased in psychological distress during that time, suggesting that the intervention
was successfully able to mitigate the distress caused by the organizational changes, although purely
from the results of the study, this would not necessarily have been apparent.

3.2.5. Process vs. Mechanism

Several studies have addressed the challenge of distinguishing between the process of developing,
introducing, and/or implementing an intervention and its impact on the mental wellbeing of employees,
as opposed to the impact of the actual intervention on mental wellbeing. For instance, Bunce et al.
also measured process variables and concluded that the process did in fact aﬀect the outcome; indeed,
the improvements in occupational stress following an interactive training program regressed to their

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4396

11 of 22

initial levels one year later, also suggesting the immediate improvements were based on the process of
engaging in the training program rather than the skill and knowledge garnered from the program [46].
Two considerations for future intervention development could be derived from this matter of process
and mechanism. First, process matters. If the process itself could impact and inﬂuence the outcome,
then it is important to be intentional and selective with the process. Second, if the process impacts the
outcome, this could aﬀect the longevity and subsequent measures of the success of an intervention
among a workforce.

3.2.6. Sustainability and Longevity of Interventions

Only two studies evaluated the longer-term eﬀects of policy changes: one from California
found that new legislation on minimum staﬃng levels for licensed nurses in hospitals increased job
satisfaction [92], and one from Germany found that a policy limiting hospital physicians’ weekly
working time led to no improvement in physicians’ mental health after ten years [86]. Most studies
evaluated the eﬀect of a discrete initiative, which begs the question of the sustainability and longevity
of the eﬀects following the completion of the study. As an exception, [58] noted that a facilitator was
employed by the organization to continue the program following the close of the study. Three studies
in particular found a short-term improvement following the intervention, which was not sustained in
the long term [45,46,53].

3.2.7. Broad Deﬁnition of Mental Health

Although the most commonly-used measure of mental health was burnout (see Document
Characteristics above), there was a variety of constructs used in the studies including stress, work
satisfaction, distress, depression, psychosocial work environment, psychological wellbeing, anxiety,
psychosomatic symptoms, aﬀect, and resilience. Even among the studies using burnout, many
discussed diﬀerences in the three dimensions of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal
accomplishment [101]. The multitude of constructs both reinforces the multifaceted nature of mental
health in the workplace as well as advances the conceptualization of mental health beyond merely
the presence or absence of mental disorders to also include more holistic measures of wellbeing
and happiness.

4. Discussion

In line with the realist synthesis approach, the focus of this discussion is on contextual factors
and processes of conducting interventions that inﬂuenced how certain mechanisms generated positive
outcome [102]. Due to the complexity of factors inﬂuencing healthcare workers’ mental health, the
broad deﬁnition of mental health including positive mental wellbeing such as happiness as well as the
complexity of implementing and evaluating workplace-based interventions, a realist review method is
well-suited to explore why and how interventions in this area work. In considering this here, we also
reﬂect on areas where additional attention is needed.

The ﬁrst theme that emerged was the importance of aligning the underlying reason, strategy,
and/or theory with the structure and content of the intervention itself as well as with the mental health
constructs that deﬁne success; this requires careful consideration of the speciﬁc needs of each population
and the context and nuances of the design of the intervention. LaMontagne et al. have presented a
framework for an integrated approach to workplace mental health interventions. This brings together
“harm prevention” addressing workplace organization primary prevention initiatives, “positive mental
health promotion” addressing individuals’ resilience in mitigating eﬀects, and illness management
through diagnosis, treatment, and reintegration [103]. These three approaches correspond with
the traditional domains of public/occupational health, organizational development/psychology, and
psychiatry. Although seemingly intuitive, it is important that consideration is given to how the targeted
upstream organizational-level factors could aﬀect change in individuals’ mental health and wellbeing,
and the inﬂuences on the optional approaches being considered for implementation [103]. This also

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4396

12 of 22

directly calls into question the positionality of those engaged in making these judgments, to ensure
that the scope of possible interventions is not unduly restricted by the preferences of one particular
stakeholder group.

The second theme was the importance of the engagement of employees across the organization;
lack of engagement from employees or a certain group of employees was often cited as a reason why
an intervention did not succeed or did not achieve the outcome anticipated. This theme has been
strongly recognized to be of critical importance in workplace health promotion interventions [104,105].
Furthermore, the psychosocial safety climate (PSC)—a construct encompassing policies, practices, and
procedures protecting the psychological health and safety of workers [106]—is positively correlated
with employees’ engagement and job satisfaction, and negatively correlated with mental ill health [107],
reinforcing the positive eﬀects of participation and engagement across all levels of an organization.
Similarly, workplace culture can impact the outcomes and success of work-based health promotion
activities, particularly in the context of implementation. Beyond the speciﬁc programs and activities,
an organization’s “culture of health”—fully integrating health into the organizational culture of how
people think and act—is crucial for workplace-based health promotion, with elements that contribute
to a culture of health including a physically-supportive environment, socially-supportive environment,
leadership support, supportive middle management, peer encouragement and team building, and
employee involvement and engagement [108]. Several studies have used participatory approaches
in the development and/or implementation of the intervention. The theme of engagement also
highlights the importance of providing employees with the time and capacity to participate, which may
involve ensuring management support to allow employees to participate. Meaningful and repeated
engagement can also help to manage expectations for the project so as to avoid the potential negative
eﬀects of unmet or mismatched expectations.

A third theme relates to managing complexity. There are the many factors at the individual,
organizational, and societal levels that aﬀect mental health in the workplace, and make it diﬃcult to
select a particular target on which to act as well as the diﬃculty in evaluating the eﬀect of a speciﬁc
change. Indeed, several studies have mentioned unrelated organizational changes that occurred at the
same time as the intervention such as restructuring or layoﬀs that subsequently diminished or negated
the eﬀects of the intervention. The consideration of complexity also includes diversity within groups
of workers with diﬀerent needs, challenges, and factors that are contributing to their mental health
at any given time, and therefore the diﬃculty in identifying and implementing an intervention that
will work for a group of employees. The heterogeneity of most employee populations also presents
challenges with consistent evaluation; for instance, a meta-analysis of workplace health promotion
programs found larger eﬀect sizes in younger populations [109]. This also highlights the importance
of process considerations as inextricably linked to the mechanism for change. The complexity of
occupational health interventions in healthcare is reﬂected in the recognition of particular challenges
and considerations involved in the evaluation of such interventions such as the importance of context
and suitability of research methods [110,111].

The fourth theme is the sustainability and longevity of both the intervention and the eﬀect
on employees’ mental health. For example, the three studies that speciﬁcally found a short-term
improvement in workers’ mental health, but no long-term improvement, reﬂect the idea that a
short-term initiative can improve mental health in the short term through an “excitement of change”
eﬀect while resources and attention are focused on the initiative in the short term [45].
In this
regard, the same type of bias noted in the Hawthorne eﬀect may be at play, reﬂecting an eﬀect of
attention being given more than the eﬃcacy of the action put into eﬀect [112]. On the other hand,
the implementation of the intervention during a discrete time interval may underestimate potential
eﬀects if it does not provide suﬃcient exposure for the employees to the intervention. In addition,
what is of particular importance is that the improvement may not be sustainable once the intervention
ends. Within the often complex environment of healthcare, making incremental changes within a
comprehensive transformation strategy has been identiﬁed as a guiding principle for ways to engage

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4396

13 of 22

in the process of culture change [113], underscoring the importance of continuous improvement rather
than discrete and singular eﬀorts. Finally, another related consideration is who is responsible for the
continued implementation of the intervention. For example, is it the workers’ continued responsibility
to enact what had been introduced through group-based training and support intervention oﬀered by
the organization?

Occupational mental health is most commonly conceptualized from a pathological standpoint,
characterized by the presence or absence of mental illness or disorders, rather than the presence
of positive mental health and wellbeing. Indeed, in a qualitative study on job-related wellbeing,
stress and burnout among healthcare workers in rural Ethiopia, most participants expressed a view
of wellbeing as absence of stress rather than as a positive state [114]. Although there is increasing
attention toward concepts of positive mental wellbeing including happiness in other disciplines such
as economics [115–118], there remains an opportunity to integrate more positive dimensions and
conceptualization of mental health in workplace-based interventions. The term “happiness” as an
indicator of positive mental health can refer both to moods and emotions as well as to more long-term
wellbeing and life satisfaction. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development deﬁnes
subjective wellbeing as encompassing three elements: life evaluation (“a reﬂective assessment on a
person’s life or some speciﬁc aspect of it”), aﬀect (feelings or emotions, usually at a point in time), and
eudaimonia (sense of meaning and purpose, or “psychological ﬂourishing”) [118]. As for measuring
happiness and mental wellbeing, life satisfaction is seen as a more reliable measure of overall wellbeing
as it depends more on the continuing circumstances of people’s lives [115,119]. Therefore, measures of
happiness based on life satisfaction are deemed better suited to capture longer-term and international
diﬀerences in policies and institutions [116]. For instance, the World Happiness Report—an annual
report published by the United Nations since 2012 on global happiness including a ranking of countries’
happiness levels—uses life satisfaction as its measure of happiness [120].

It is of critical importance to note that the large burden of mental illness is often exacerbated by
stigma and discrimination. The negative impacts of stigma occur, for example, through victimization,
mistreatment, loss of support networks, and diﬃculties accessing housing [121].
In addition,
stigma has been found to deter or delay help-seeking among individuals with mental illness, with
a disproportionate eﬀect among ethnic minorities, youth, men, military personnel, and health
professionals [122]. Stigma and discrimination can in turn worsen the social and economic costs of
mental illness. Individuals who experience discrimination against mental illness in a healthcare setting
have almost double the costs of health service usage [123]. In addition to the impact of stigma against
mental illness, the stigma against infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis can in turn
negatively impact people’s mental health [124]. Furthermore, in Low and Middle Income Countries
(LMICs) experiencing the burden of both infectious and chronic non-infectious diseases including
mental illness, the resulting intersection of stigmas can result in a syndemic [125].

As the themes discussed above all call into question the importance of attention to the mechanisms
and processes for carrying out interventions to improve mental health and wellbeing, it is worth
reﬂecting on the limited attention to the existence of “health and safety management” processes that
have been introduced to promote the involvement and participation of workers representatives along
with management and health professionals [126]. Perhaps this is a mechanism that should receive
additional attention and be subject to evaluation itself.

Finally, the value of applying a realist-informed approach to the question of what works
in promoting mental health and wellbeing in the workplace merits consideration. For example,
while the 2015 Cochrane systematic review on preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers
concluded that there was low-quality evidence that changing work schedules reduced stress, and
other organizational-level interventions led to minimal to no changes in stress, [36], our review also
found mixed evidence of workload and time management-related interventions aﬀecting mental
health. A strength of our review was the broad inclusion criteria for healthcare workers including
nurses, midwives, physicians, social workers, aged care staﬀ, and support staﬀ. With the increasing

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4396

14 of 22

move toward interdisciplinary and team-based healthcare, studying the impact on a diverse set of
healthcare workers is essential, acknowledging the unique challenges and opportunities presented in
each discipline.

This review furthermore highlights the need for research in this area from LMICs, particularly
from African countries. With increasing demand for health human resources in LMICs, there is a need
for evidence on how best to support the mental health of healthcare workers in these countries.

This review also highlights the need for robust deﬁnitions and approaches to mental health in
the workplace, extending beyond the traditional focus on the absence of negative mental health to
more broadly encompass constructs of mental wellbeing and happiness including long-term subjective
wellbeing and life satisfaction.

Limitations

A major limitation of the review is the lack of generalizability due to the variety of mental health
constructs included. The variety of mental health constructs intentionally included in this review
encompassed a “mental health” that was not solely the absence or presence of a mental illness or
condition; while expanding on previous reviews in so doing, the range of outcomes and measures
make direct comparisons across studies diﬃcult. Second, the focus on only organizational-level
interventions meant the exclusion of cognitive-behavioral and relaxation interventions. Although
this selection criterion was intentional, this categorization of interventions may implicitly or explicitly
impose a mutual exclusivity among types of interventions, when a holistic approach to mental health
promotion in the workplace may be warranted. Third, the exclusion of grey literature from the literature
search strategy may have precluded consideration of additional relevant research [89] conducted by
organizations such as occupational health and safety agencies in the analysis. Fourth, there was only
one reviewer who conducted the literature search, analysis, and synthesis process, which may have led
to bias in both the selection and synthesis processes.

5. Conclusions

While the healthcare workforce experiences high rates of mental ill health, generating signiﬁcant
eﬀects not only for the workers themselves but also on patients, there is limited evidence on how to
promote mental health and wellbeing in the healthcare workforce. The collection of studies included
in this review highlights the complexity of factors at the organizational level that inﬂuence mental
health and the work environment.

There is strong rationale for approaching mental health promotion in the workplace from a
continuous improvement perspective. This is due to the variety of factors inﬂuencing mental health in
the workplace at any given time, regardless of the complexity of evaluating and measuring progress in
this area. Moreover, attention to this challenge have been quite uneven globally. Recommendations for
research on organizational-level interventions to promote mental health particularly include the need
for more research in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, there exists great opportunity for
better integration of positive mental health and wellbeing constructs such as happiness in the context
of workers’ mental health in intervention studies, so that eﬀorts to improve this can be more strongly
considered in future knowledge synthesis reviews.
