Working dogs are prevalent throughout our societies, assisting people in diverse
contexts, from explosives detection and livestock herding, to therapy partners. Our
scientiﬁc exploration and understanding of animal welfare have grown dramatically over
the last decade. As community attitudes toward the use of animals continue to change,
applying this new knowledge of welfare to improve the everyday lives of working dogs
will underpin the sustainability of working with dogs in these roles. The aim of this report
was to consider the scientiﬁc studies of working dogs from the last decade (2011–2021)
in relation to modern ethics, human interaction, and the ﬁve domains of animal welfare:
nutrition, environment, behavioral interaction, physical health, and mental state. Using
this framework, we were able to analyze the concept and contribution of working dog
welfare science. Noting some key advances across the full working dog life cycle, we
identify future directions and opportunities for interdisciplinary research to optimize dog
welfare. Prioritizing animal welfare in research and practice will be critical to assure the
ongoing relationship between dogs and people as co-workers.

INTRODUCTION

Conﬁdence in good animal welfare practices has been identiﬁed as critical to maintaining public
support and the sustainability of industries dependent on animals (1, 2). Working dogs are
prevalent around the world and fulﬁll many roles, adding social, cultural, and economic value
to human lifestyles. They are valuable co-workers, providing labor that would be more costly
for humans to do (3, 4), or performing specialized tasks that people are unable to accomplish,
such as scent detection or as the focus of animal-assisted therapy (5, 6). Despite their value, many
working dog providers only graduate around half of the dogs bred or recruited to their programs
to operational working service, indicating inherent wastage (7).

Over the last 10 years, there has been growing scientiﬁc investment to better understand
all aspects of working dog genetics, rearing, training, and functional performance in areas
as diverse as scent detection, therapy, mobility, and safety with a view to improving canine
performance, welfare, and program eﬃciencies [(7–11)]. Animal welfare science has also
developed in the last decade, with the most recent update to the Five Domains Model adapted

is feeling,
animal welfare can be recognized as the lived experience of an
animal. An animal’s welfare is informed by positive or negative
experiences across the domains of nutrition, environment,
physical health, behavioral interactions; animal welfare scientists
measure indicators of these experiences and the animal’s mental
state to assess animal welfare [(12–15)].

Hampton et al. (16) suggest that industries with strong
scientiﬁc investment are more likely to retain community
approval for their animal use, also referred to as social license
to operate. The role of scientiﬁc research to inform modern
animal management practices has also been identiﬁed as critical
to industries reliant on animal use, including working dogs
(7). Across private, government, assistance and service, racing,
livestock herding and guarding working dog sectors, risk
assessment may identify a generalized lack of transparency,
stakeholder engagement and sharing of evidence-based best
practices or standards to ensure the wellbeing of working dogs
at the operational level (7). Where industry practices do not
meet community expectations, the social license to operate may
be revoked, resulting in industry disruption, or cessation or
that type of animal use (16)). Examples from the last decade
include interruption to greyhound racing and the phasing
out of exotic animal circus performances in many locations
globally (17, 18). Animal-reliant sectors that have transparency
of animal care and management practices, demonstrate genuine
engagement that leads to trust with their stakeholders (including
the general public). Sectors which are science-informed appear
more resilient to media exposés and loss of social
license
resulting in industry disruption (16). The ongoing use of working
dogs is therefore more likely to be sustainable when operators
have a strong record of independent scientiﬁc research and
consequently function using evidence-based best practices that
demonstrate how animal welfare is monitored transparently
[(7), Hampton et al. (16)]. In the case of working dogs
today, animal welfare largely reﬂects the interplay between
three key components: the individual dogs, human attitudes
and behaviors, and the physical environment, including facility
management practices.

Recognition that dogs are sentient animals, possessing
intrinsic value beyond their consideration as possessions,
equipment or working contribution is being reﬂected in
changes to legislation and politics globally (e.g., Australia,
European Union, New Zealand, Canada, United States, and
United Kingdom) (19–22). This shift is representative of a change
in our relationship with these animals and the importance
we place on their wellbeing and feelings (23). Although
the scientiﬁc understanding of sentience and animal welfare
science are interlinked concepts, the relative importance of
species’ characteristics is still being explored. For example,
research to better understand cognitive abilities, evolution and
selection, biological functioning, aﬀective states, natural living,
measurement of experiences, observation of behavior and social
relationships, or other elements to reﬂect the lived experience
of animals to inform animal management practices [(23–25)].
Concern has been expressed that animal welfare science has

focused on optimizing performance and productivity of animals
for the beneﬁt of humans, rather than understanding the lived
experience, needs and interests of animals [(26, 27)]. This
may reﬂect the economic motivations tied to the sources of
research funding [(27–29)]. For some industries, it could be
perceived that scientiﬁc input is engaged with an exploitative
motivation, rather than protective, with little focus to increase
understanding, empathy and compassion toward animals
[(25, 27, 30)].

Among the concerns in relation to the welfare of working dogs
shared by media in recent years, the issues of animal consent
and vulnerability appear to be gaining momentum. These issues
have not only been observed in relation to working dogs in the
last decade. For example, arguments have been made with regard
to chimpanzees as vulnerable subjects in research on the basis
of conﬁnement, dependency and communication barriers [e.g.,
(31)]. This has extended into legal discussions, where animal
protection by law has historically existed only to the degree
that animal and human interests coincide (32). However, the
last decade has given rise to cases where non-human animals
have been identiﬁed as “sentient and vulnerable beings in
need of a legal voice” and attributed rights, challenging law
previously considered an anthropocentric institution [e.g., (33,
34)]. These trends across diﬀerent disciplines reﬂect the attitude
shift of concern for animals present among citizens. Identifying
vulnerability leads to moral obligations and duties of justice (35).
Industries reliant upon animals, including working dogs, will
need to be pro-active and transparent in assuring their animal
production and care practices do not disappoint community
expectations if they wish to have sustainable participation of
animals in these roles (1, 7, 36).

The contributions of research to working dog welfare over the
past 10 years can be found in scientiﬁc publications across all the
domains of animal welfare. Researchers engaged with, or based
within working dog providers, are generating scientiﬁc evidence
across ﬁelds as diverse as animal behavior, stress physiology,
genetics, and technology to learn more about what working dogs
need and want, and to optimize performance in the specialized
tasks we require of them. Determining whether an animal use is
acceptable is often complex, involving consideration of elements
such as sociocultural, economic, environmental, both human and
animal health, and other factors (37). Science provides a way
to help us understand the mental and physical eﬀects of animal
use on the animal, informing practices, legislation and decisions
relating to animal lives (15).

The aim of

this report was to capture key scientiﬁc
advances relating to the animal welfare science of working
dogs discussed by the authors and colleagues at the Wallis
Annenberg PetSpace Leadership Institute workshop in 2020.
In this paper, we have identiﬁed and reviewed these scientiﬁc
studies of working dogs from last decade (2011–2021), with
a particular focus on their relation to modern ethics, human
interaction and the ﬁve domains of animal welfare. Using
this framework, we were able to consider the recent advances
in understanding across the full working dog life cycle. This
analysis has identiﬁed future directions and opportunities
for interdisciplinary research to optimize the welfare and

assure a sustainable co-worker relationship for people and
working dogs.

A FRAMEWORK TO INVESTIGATE RECENT
WORKING DOG WELFARE ADVANCES:
AREAS OF FOCUS

Modern Ethics
For decades, the major impetus in investigating and evaluating
the roles of animals working with people has focused on the
human portion of the equation. Although the past couple of
decades have seen great progress in assessing the welfare of
working dogs (7, 12), there continues to be a disparity in how
these services are valued and evaluated from both the human
and animal perspectives. It is evident that in the early years, even
with good intentions, most of our expectations emphasized the
value of these services for humans, overshadowing the impact of
the work on the animals themselves (29). Today, we are seeing
a stronger trend to assure reciprocal assessments on both sides
of the service partnership. Animals that work with people should
have the ability to form meaningful relationships in their lives
and an ability to live their lives fully, irrespective of their work
activities. In an optimal scenario, the animals’ work activities
should be enhancing their quality-of-life experiences.

It behooves those involved in training and providing services
alongside working dogs to prioritize both ends of the leash to
ensure welfare and the value of the experience is more reciprocal.
Although some assume that working dogs enjoy their work,
the animals are typically not asked if they want to participate
in the work that they do. They are just engaged, with consent
assumed. Although, it seems today that more attention is given
to ascertain if the animal seems comfortable in their position,
there continues to be a lag in objectively assessing the welfare of
working dogs (29).

Numerous researchers and scholars of ethics and animal
welfare have stressed many ethical concerns that professionals
need to consider in working with service/assisted therapy animals
[(38–43)]. It is important to appreciate that if these working
experiences cause an animal to have little control over their daily
life and bring discomfort, this can induce unhealthy stress. For
example, Burrows (44) reports that, early on, some dogs that
were used as service dogs for persons with autism were tethered
next to the child for an unrealistic amount of time. Due to the
lack of awareness by some of the families, Burrows (44) reported
that the dogs within this study experienced undue stress from
their interactions.

When addressing the welfare of working dogs, we must
consider the ethical parameters of how to judge the process
to make ethical decisions that are in the best interest of all
those involved. A starting place is integration of a plan into
the decision-making process so that we will act with a sense
of integrity (45). Making appropriate decisions that consider
the multi-dimensional aspects of these interactions for both
humans and animals should be the cornerstone of initiating and
guiding the process. Within the literature there are numerous
ethical models that could be applied to one’s decision making to

eﬀectively reﬂect on the work of service or therapy animals. Each
of the models considers dilemmas from a distinct prism. The
“ethics of care” approach strives to respect all parties involved by
placing emphasis on sustaining relationships and the bond that
is established (46). The primary focus of this model highlights
the working relationship and the trust that is forged between the
animal and all parties, as well as the animal’s vulnerability. Within
this model, whether the animal is provided with enriching quality
of life experiences should be considered.

The “rights approach” primarily focuses on protecting and
respecting the rights of all parties involved. This ethical
approach assesses not only the human beneﬁts derived from
the relationship but also the pros and cons from the animal’s
perspective (47). Finally, the “utilitarian approach” uses a cost-
beneﬁt analysis that determines what we should act upon next,
based on all the morally relevant consequences (usually harms
and beneﬁts for sentient individuals) of the actions available to
us (48, 49). Within this model, it is simple to begin to address
what are the costs that the animals might experience due to
their work and daily experiences. The utilitarian approach does
encourage evaluating the beneﬁts that could also occur as a
result of the actions. In following this approach, we must ensure
that the costs and beneﬁts are assessed objectively, for both the
humans and working dogs alike. Such assessment should be
robust, using multiple validated measures (physical, behavioral,
and physiological) to ensure objective assessment of animal
welfare (50).

The ﬁve domains (nutrition, environment, physical health,
behavioral interactions, and their impact on the animal’s mental
state) of animal welfare (12) can provide a useful template to
determine how the interactions and the working experience
impact overall well-being. While not an ethical model, the “Five
Domains Model” for animal welfare (12) oﬀers an excellent
perspective to assess the well-being of an animal by evaluating
how the animal’s physical and functional experiences impacts
their emotional state. According to Peralta and Fine (46) the
Five Domains model can be particularly useful in assessing
the possible negative and the positive eﬀects that the working
relationship has on an animal’s well-being (51). The model
promotes the need to emphasize opportunities within each
domain that lead to positive aﬀective states (12). One needs
to assess each of
the
environmental, social, and physical
interactions of working

the domains to ascertain if any of

These ethical decision-making frameworks can be applied to
assess what should be considered to ensure that all parties’ well-
being is taken into consideration. As noted earlier, animals truly
do not have a voice regarding their engagement. However, we
believe that priority attention must be given to their welfare
to assure quality of life. It is incumbent upon all practitioners
who work with dogs, as well as researchers, to constantly ask
questions about the human-animal relationships (established or
being established) to ensure that the engagement is not one-
sided, and that everyone’s well-being is taken into consideration.
This paradigm shift to recognize dogs as our co-workers and

Working Dog Welfare Science Perspectives

settings (e.g., healthcare) to oﬀer greater protection to working
animals, reﬂects a change in moral understanding that has ethical
implications for working with animals (52).

Human Interaction
Attachment
While links between human attitudes, their relationship to
behavior toward animals and the impact of human behavior on
animal welfare has been studied in other animal-use contexts,
such as farmed livestock (53, 54), there has been less focus on
these relationships in relation to working dog and handler teams.
However, beliefs and perception of people working alongside
working dogs have been shown to be valuable in identifying
animal welfare issues (55) and can be critical in shaping the
success of some working dog partnerships, such as those between
guide dogs and people who are blind or vision impaired (56).

Working dogs have been shown to perform diﬀerently for
various handlers (57, 58), with implications for operational
decision-making, such as working dogs having one or multiple
handlers. This performance diﬀerence is likely underpinned by
the interplay of canine and human personalities, as well as
strength and style of attachment between the dog and handler
(59, 60). Handler beliefs can impact canine work performance,
as demonstrated by Lit et al. (61); when handler expectations
were manipulated in an applied environment, alerts by scent
detection dogs were impacted. Interestingly, another scent
detection study that manipulated handler stress levels showed
that working dogs showed improved performance when their
handlers’ anxiety levels were elevated (62). Such dog-human
dyad studies often lack generalizability due to small sample sizes
and are regularly taken from one workplace or population of
dogs. An opportunity for future collaboration between multiple
working dog providers, following the collaborative replication
model established by programs such as Many Babies, Many
Primates and newly established, Many Dogs (63, 64)), would
allow for more robust testing of importance phenomena relating
to the human-dog working team’s performance and its relation to
working dog welfare.

Training Methods and Equipment
Using only reward-based (positive reinforcement)
training
methods has been found to be more eﬀective than use of
aversive, compulsive, punishment-based (e.g., shock collars) or
mixed methods. The use of only positive reinforcement results in
more optimistic dogs with faster learning and more consistent
behavioral responses who experience less pain and suﬀering,
as well as reported lower incidence of aggression, problematic
behaviors (e.g., unwanted barking), and symptoms of negative
aﬀect (65–69). Many people persist in using aversive methods
when training their dogs, despite the known risks to canine
welfare (66). A comprehensive review of modern working dog
training has been provided by Hall et al. (70) within this
special issue.

In many instances, the equipment used while working with
dogs, such as collars, leads and harnesses, have not undergone
much change in the past decade. The increasing use of pressure
sensors, accelerometers and kinematics can oﬀer new insights

into how existing equipment impacts dogs when interacting
with people [e.g., (71, 72)]. Given the emergence of new
textiles and materials that may be stronger and lighter than
traditional equipment, as well as nanotechnology, and smart
textiles incorporating wearable electronics (73), we identify this
as a future area for review and development.

Human Expertise
Humans are often ﬂawed in accurately assessing our own skills
and abilities. For example, the better-than-average-eﬀect is a form
of illusory bias exhibited across a wide range of competencies,
such as driving, environmentalism, and even parenting (74). The
eﬀect is seen when people self-assess their capabilities upward,
rating themselves better than reality and how others would rate
them. Emerging evidence suggests a similar eﬀect may be present
in relation to how we perceive ourselves as providers of canine
welfare (75). This highlights the importance for evidence-based
education programs for all people involved with working dogs
and role that external auditing should perform in quality control.
The Dunning–Kruger eﬀect (76) is described in social
psychology as the ignorance of ignorance. That is, people lack
the knowledge and awareness to recognize what they don’t
know about a topic. The eﬀect means that those with very little
knowledge about something will often believe themselves to have
high expertise in that area, preventing them from recognizing
mistakes. Understanding how these aspects of social psychology
relate to attitudes and behaviors toward dogs, as well-developing
best practice, evidence-based professional knowledge transfer for
people involved with working dogs is identiﬁed as an opportunity
for future research.

Nutrition
Provision of Food and Hydration
One of the basic tenets of animal welfare is the freedom from
hunger and thirst (51, 77). The provision of adequate food
and water is necessary for sustenance, but when considering
the welfare of working dogs, this requirement must be viewed
through a diﬀerent lens. Rather than avoiding the negative
welfare eﬀects of inadequate nutrition, or settling for merely
adequate nutrition (51), the focus should be on enhancing the
positive impact of optimal nutrition. In addition, the knowledge
base continues to expand and new information to support the
working dog must be considered. Working dogs have increased
nutritional demands due to the nature of their work. Detection
and protection dogs often work in adverse environments and
are engaged in physical activity that can lead to dehydration
(78–80). Even 15 min of retrieving a ball can lead to ﬂuid loss and
detectable dehydration (81). The research over the last decade
has particularly contributed to improving our understanding of
optimizing hydration in working dogs.

Working dogs are selected for high motivation to engage
in their trained task (e.g., searching for a trained odor or
apprehending a ﬂeeing suspect). When engaged in tasks that are
rewarding or stimulating, these dogs will override the physiologic
signals that drive thirst and are critical in preventing dehydration.
Even mild to moderate dehydration impairs cognition, decreases
alertness, and increases fatigue in humans (82). The eﬀects of

Working Dog Welfare Science Perspectives

dehydration on cognition and fatigue have not been studied in
the dog. Adequate hydration is also essential for control of body
temperature. Unlike humans and horses, dogs do not regulate
body temperature through sweating. Dogs rely on panting for
heat exchange (83) and therefore can be at increased risk of heat-
related injury when dehydrated (84). In working dogs, heat injury
is recognized as a major and preventable cause of morbidity and
mortality (85, 86). Hydration research represents an area of focus,
due to the impact of inadequate hydration on performance and
welfare and the ability to positively impact hydration in active
working dogs.

The human partner of the working dog must be the advocate
for the welfare of the dog, which translates to developing
strategies to maintain and enhance hydration. One of the simplest
approaches is to interrupt the dog during work to provide a
hydration break. The dog may still be more focused on work
than its physiology, therefore strategies to encourage drinking
may be necessary. Although traditionally electrolyte replacement
solutions were not recommended for dogs since they do not lose
electrolytes through sweat (87), recent studies have suggested
that electrolyte replacement solutions can be safe, palatable and
may enhance heat tolerance in working dogs (79, 80). The
beneﬁt of electrolyte solutions does not appear to be a result of
increased palatability and ﬂuid consumption, because ﬂavored
water did not show the beneﬁt and may lead to adverse eﬀects
(i.e., increased muscle damage) (80). The beneﬁts of electrolyte
solutions may be replacement of electrolytes lost in saliva during
panting and in urine during exercise (79, 80, 88). On the other
end of the scale, excessive water consumption can result in “water
intoxication” and the associated dangerously low blood sodium
and even death (89). Typically, physiological responses prevent
continued water intake, but highly motivated dogs may override
the signals, or may consume excessive water during swimming or
playing with water (e.g., chasing a hose). This is another setting
in which the welfare of the working dog will be directly impacted
by the handler’s awareness.

Like the requirement for hydration at a level commensurate
with the work expected of a working dog, nutrition for optimal
welfare extends beyond providing calories. In its simplest form
nutrition should be a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrate,
ﬁber, and essential vitamins and minerals to sustain life. For an
active working dog, the physical demands alter the nutritional
requirements (87). Protein requirements are increased to help
build and support muscle that is being used in the work tasks
(87, 90). For dogs that require endurance activities, higher
fat content in the diet is required (87, 90). In addition to
the type of food provided, the recommended frequency of
feeding is based on the type of work. Dogs that compete in
sprinting or intermediate distance activities may beneﬁt from
a 20 to 30% reduction in calories 24 h prior to activity. It is
recommended that dogs undergoing vigorous activity are not
fed in the 8 h prior to or immediately following the activity.
Endurance athletes may require twice daily feeding (87). The
understanding of working dog nutrition is a continually evolving
ﬁeld, and a comprehensive review is beyond the scope of
this paper; for a recent review of working dog nutrition, see
Zoran (90).

Quality of Food
Animal nutrition is a ﬁeld prone to the application of current
human dietary trends to animals. The motivation behind these
feeding practices may be to appeal to human purchasers, but
can also lie in an attempt to increase the nutritional beneﬁts
to the dog (91), conversely, the use of non-traditional diets
may put both humans and animals at risk of disease. Two
common feeding practices that have been associated with
adverse health eﬀects are the use of grain-free diets and raw
meat diets. Although still controversial (92), studies suggest
that some dogs fed a non-traditional diet (grain-free with
non-traditional legume-based protein sources) have an increased
risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (93, 94). Diets based on raw
meat are popular among animal companion owners (91),

dogs should be based on nutritionally sound formulations
that are demonstrated to be safe for the dog and the canine
handler/owner. One strategy to avoid unrecognized nutritional
deﬁciencies and address the welfare beneﬁt of providing a varied
diet (12) may be to rotate diet formulations.

all

In addition to the basic nutrients, functional foods (those
that provide beneﬁts beyond nutritional value) and dietary
supplements may have a role in supporting health and wellbeing
of the working dog. Dietary supplements represent a rapidly
growing industry and topic of great interest, with limited clinical
trials. Most supplements are designed to reduce inﬂammation
and improve joint health, a relevant impact for working dogs
where osteoarthritis is a common occurrence (95). Currently,
the supplements with the most scientiﬁc evidence of eﬃcacy
are the omega-3 fatty acids (96). The balance of omega-3 fatty
acids is important for cognition and as an anti-inﬂammatory,
particularly for management of osteoarthritis. Other functional
foods may also have a role in supporting the wellbeing of working
dogs (97) but more research is necessary. Beyond foods and
dietary supplements, one of the most eﬃcacious approaches to
minimize inﬂammation and pain associated with osteoarthritis is
weight control.

A greater problem in modern working dogs is not inadequate
calories, rather, an excess of calories. Obesity is a frequent
problem in pet dogs (98, 99) and is surprisingly common in
working dogs. The optimal body condition score of pet dogs
is between a 4 and 5 out of 9 (100). Working dogs’ body
condition score should be between a 3.5 and 4.5 out of 9. The
impact of carrying excess weight is multi-fold. The added mass

increases the eﬀort and energy required for activity. Fat is an
insulator that can reduce surface heat loss and increase the risk
of heat injury. Additionally, adipose tissue is metabolically active
and is responsible for the release of inﬂammatory cytokines
that contribute to the progression of osteoarthritis and other
inﬂammatory conditions. In a longitudinal study of Labrador
retrievers, a diﬀerence in a body condition score of 5 out of 9 vs.
7 out of 9 translated to a lifespan of almost 2 years longer (101).

Physical Health
The physical health of a working dog must be considered from
the time of birth or recruitment, throughout the dog’s working
life and into retirement. Some breeds of dogs as well as individual
dogs do not have the physical structure to safely participate
in the required tasks of some working roles. For example, a
brachycephalic dog that is unable to eﬀectively pant will be
at high risk for heat injury during exercise (102). Likewise, a
dog with hip dysplasia will not have the structural stability to
serve pain-free as a guide, mobility assistance, police, or search
dog (103).

Preventive care is critical to maintain working dog health
and an example of minimum requirements are described in the
AAHA recommendations (104). The environment in which the
dog works will dictate the speciﬁcs of care; however, all working
dogs should have veterinary examinations at least annually.
Disease prevention includes vaccination with the core vaccines
as recommended by AAHA (105) and inclusion of vaccines
for infectious diseases like leptospirosis, canine kennel cough
complex and canine inﬂuenza based on individual, geographic
and environmental risk factors (106). All working dogs should
have a comprehensive parasite control program to address both
internal and external parasites. Based on the mortality associated
with gastric dilatation and volvulus documented in the US
military working dog program (85), prophylactic gastropexy
should be considered in large breed, deep chested working
dogs. Current minimally invasive techniques (107), and limited
complications
the welfare recommendation
to perform this elective procedure in dogs at risk. Other
management decisions, such as spay or neutering working
dogs, may also be associated with impacts to health and
longevity in breeds such as Labrador and Golden Retrievers
[e.g., (109–111)]. The role of the veterinarian in maintaining
a low-stress environment during delivery of preventive care
cannot be over emphasized. Despite the beneﬁts of the medical
care, aversive experiences associated with veterinary visits can
negatively impact the welfare and subsequent performance of
the working dog. Many of these dogs are highly arousable
and minimal physical restraint or early implementation of
chemical restraint or anxiolytics is now recognized as standard
of care (112).

support

(108)

Physical ﬁtness is an important welfare consideration (12).
The implementation of a ﬁtness program requires that the dog
is physically capable of the exercises, the environment is safe for
performance of the exercises and the training protocol creates a
positive experience for the dog. A foundational ﬁtness program
has been described for working dogs (10). Any canine ﬁtness
program should include ﬂexibility, body awareness, endurance

(both cardiovascular and muscular), strength, and mobility.
The intensity of the program should be gradually increased in
response to objective assessments of the dog’s performance, with
safety for the dog and the handler paramount. A balanced ﬁtness
program will also include mental ﬁtness as the dog learns new
behaviors, develops resilience to environmental distractions and
increases focus during the exercises (113). The beneﬁts of ﬁtness
extend beyond the mental and physical stimulation associated
with the training; a ﬁtness program can aid in injury prevention,
speed recovery from injury/illness and provide an opportunity
for positive human-dog interactions.

Environment
Working dogs can be deployed across a wide range of diﬀerent
environments, from therapy room, to snowy forest or hot
desert. The welfare of the dog is dependent on the human
partner, which translates to providing a safe location when not
working (i.e., in a home environment, during transportation
facility), recognizing early signs of overexertion,
or kennel
disease, dehydration and thermal stress. In the US, kennel
facilities, whether in a home or in agency housing are
required to meet accepted current USDA Animal Welfare
Act guidelines. See Animal Code of Federal Regulations:
Title 9, Volume 1 January 1, 2016 (https://ecfr.io/Title-9).
Additional kenneling and care standards are under development
(https://www.nist.gov/osac/dogs-sensors-subcommittee; http://
www.asbstandardsboard.org/published-documents/dogs-and-
sensors-published-documents/).
In addition, environmental
enrichment, access to exercise and play (with people and with
other dogs) all enhance the welfare of the working dog (114).

Systemic hyperthermia can lead to various degrees of systemic

to heat exhaustion (mild to moderate dysfunction with

(elevated body temperature with organ injury) to heat stroke
(115, 116). Traditionally, heat stroke is deﬁned as an elevated
body temperature (>40.6

of neurologic dysfunction and the risk of multiple organ
dysfunction (115). During activity, working dogs have been
reported to maintain and recover from body temperatures
above 41.1
F) without evidence of heat injury (80, 117).
Prevention of heat injury needs to focus on a safe temperature-
controlled environment for the dog, control of heat generating
activity, and eﬀective heat exchange. A common breach in welfare
occurs when a dog is left in a closed vehicle in a hot environment,
whether inadvertently or through a failure of cooling systems
(118). Some dogs are highly motivated by the mental stimulation
of their work and this may override normal physiologic triggers
that drive thirst (80) resulting in exertional heat stroke. The
environmental temperature and humidity should be considered
when planning dog training sessions or determining work cycles
to decrease the risk of heat injury (119). Finally, diseases or

Working Dog Welfare Science Perspectives

dog training equipment that obstruct the ﬂow of breath (e.g.,
laryngeal paralysis, tight muzzles), inadequate hydration and
lack of physical conditioning will all predispose dogs to heat
injury (117).

Transportation
Transportation is a common occurrence for many working dogs
and has been shown to be stressful and resistant to habituation if
familiarization does not occur via positive early exposure in life
(120). Of particular importance to note is the regular occurrence
of working dogs being forgotten and left in unattended vehicles
for extended periods,
leading to their death when heat and
dehydration impact without suﬃcient ventilation, hydration or
cooling in place. In response to the climate crises and global
warming, vehicle transportation has been identiﬁed as a risk for
dogs, even in areas not traditionally considered hot, such as the
United Kingdom (121).

Behavior
Behavioral issues are a major contributing factor to the high
failure rates in working dog programs (8). Reducing behavioral
wastage (the proportion of dogs bred or recruited to train that do
not reach operational status due to their behavior) by improved
assessment and tailored support for dogs will bring welfare
beneﬁts (122). Research considering the behavior of working
dogs over the past decade has largely focused on tests to improve
the selection and performance of working dogs, with the aim
of increasing program success rates, currently reported to be
∼50% across diﬀerent working dog sectors (3, 7). This focus on
behavior has included assessment of behavioral characteristics
considered predictive of suitability to work (122, 123); the
genetics of working dog behavior (124); maternal care in working
dog breeding programs (125); and development and testing of
cognitive skills [(126, 127)]. The use of technologies to capture
and support behavioral observations such as activity monitoring
and bio-metric sensors, in conjunction with algorithms (e.g.,
machine learning) to process large data sets are also being
deployed with the goal of enhanced screening of working
dogs (128).

Although some behavioral assessments report good predictive
validity (42), aspects of research-driven behavioral assessment
that may obfuscate their translation to industry practice include
inter-rater reliability, and the reliability and construct validity
of behavioral measures (129). Terminology used to describe
behavior can also vary widely between and across industry
sectors, potentially creating confusion for researchers, working
dog trainers and handlers alike (7, 130). Some dogs that fail out
of one program may be suitable for other careers, prompting
programs to consider developing a co-operative approach (8).
Not all dogs that fail to reach operational status are considered
to exhibit behavior suitable for rehoming to non-working
placements. Community attitudes and media attention have
prompted changes in some sectors that historically euthanized
or abandoned working dogs as an end point to their training or
working life [e.g., Royal Australian Air Force Wilson: (131); US
Military: Alger and Alger (132, 133)]. This indicates the inﬂuence
of community attitudes and the media in driving industry change

to retain social license to operate. However, without research
reporting on the behavior and welfare of working dogs that have
career-transitioned, it is unclear how well they adjust to rehoming
away from training or work. This is an important future direction
for investigation to extend our understanding of dogs bred or
recruited to work to full-life cycle consideration.

Further work to identify and understand behavioral indicators
of working dog welfare is needed. While many studies have
sought to advance the “production of better dogs” (127), it
is time to focus on extending our identiﬁcation of behavioral
indicators of aﬀective state and welfare speciﬁc to working dog
operational environments, kennel facility and home settings
(134). The importance of drastic social and physical environment
change inherent in many working dog programs has been
identiﬁed as a welfare concern [e.g., (135)]. New ﬁndings in this
area, particularly with consideration for the inﬂuence of dog
personality and coping styles, would be useful to practitioners
and regulators in guiding the development and implementation
of best practice and standards. For example, identiﬁcation of
the behavioral cues of detection dogs that require rest breaks in
airports or understanding how best to transition a young dog
from puppy raising home to training kennel, would help guide
regulations for optimal welfare during work. The roles of early
socialization, provision of agency, and lifetime opportunities to
play (with dogs and people) for the wellbeing of working dogs are
also important area to investigate that are currently unexplored.
Emerging technologies, such as those utilized in bioacoustics and
precision livestock farming, may be useful tools in the remote
monitoring of behavior and welfare in settings such as kennel
facilities and private home environments [(136–138)].

Mental State
Optimal rest and sleep are critical for working dogs. Sleep
is associated with emotional state in sentient animals and
is necessary for consolidation of learning, immune function,
optimal performance and recovery to ensure longevity in
working dog roles (139–142). Remote monitoring of canine
sleep can be used to alert staﬀ to disruption or change from
normal sleep patterns that might impact animal welfare (143).
For example, sleep deprivation has been shown to be detrimental
to learning, decision making, and promoting negative aﬀective
states in rats and humans (144) and can also interfere with canine
physiological stress responses such as cortisol (145). In addition
to getting enough good quality sleep, it is critical for working
dogs’ social and mental needs to be met (51, 146).

The term enrichment has been widely used to describe
animal care or management practices that help overcome
deﬁcits inherent in an animal’s environment or social
life.
For example, Gfrerer et al. (147) report on the beneﬁts of
conspeciﬁc interaction for Swiss adult military dogs usually
housed in isolation. Rather than interpreting this activity from
the human perspective as a training or enrichment exercise,
this compensatory social exposure might be reframed to reﬂect
that its function is enabling the dogs to meet their psycho-
physiological and behavioral needs for interaction with other
dogs for mental wellbeing. It may be useful to reframe our
thinking of social, environmental and mental enrichment as

Working Dog Welfare Science Perspectives

“meeting critical needs,” rather than perceiving such programs as
non-essential extra, if resources allow.

The capacity for animals

to engage freely with their
environment under their own motivation is referred to as agency
(148). Promoting agency in animals can improve behavioral
diversity and have a positive eﬀect on their welfare (149), but can
prove challenging in some working dog settings. For example, it
may not be appropriate for a working seeing-eye dog to explore
dropped food or approach another dog to play. Nonetheless,
identifying and supporting regular opportunities for working
dogs to exercise agency and increase behavioral diversity in both
environmental and social contexts is an opportunity for future
studies. One activity that has been shown to induce positive
judgement bias in dogs, is nosework (150). Letting dogs engage
in olfactory-based sniﬃng activities resulted in them exercising
autonomy and agency, resulting in increased optimism (150).

Working dogs have demonstrated long-term behavioral
resilience after deployment in acutely stressful situations, such
as the search and rescue dogs deployed at the site of the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (151). Other studies, such
as that by Wojta´s et al. (152), suggest that rescue searches are
stressful events to working dogs, demonstrated by elevation in
salivary cortisol. The use of salivary cortisol in canine studies is
widespread, yet it is a measure that can be inﬂuenced by a wide
range of factors, making direct comparison between individual
dogs and studies very hard (145). Our ability to diﬀerentiate dogs’
acute and chronic cortisol responses as excitement or distress
relies on interpretation oﬀered by additional measures including
behavioral observations and additional physiological indicators
such as heart rate variability and immune function (135). This
highlights the need for further investigation and assessment
toward routine inclusion of multiple reliable and robust measures
when assessing the welfare of working dogs.

DISCUSSION

Full Life Cycle Consideration
Assessment of working dog welfare should occur routinely
throughout working life (153–155), with regular reviews of
exit data (when dogs are discontinued from training or retired
from work) to look for patterns across time to identify other
animal welfare concerns, relating to both physical and mental
states [(156–158)]. These initiatives should include consideration
for all environments and activities, including those outside of
operational working sessions and with transparent surveillance
and reporting across the full
life cycle. This continuous
improvement ethos should include adequate resourcing to be
inclusive of breeding, rearing and/or recruitment; housing,
transportation and husbandry practices; training techniques and
dog training equipment; trainer and handler education; career
change and retirement of working dogs.

Scientiﬁc Research and Sustainability
Scientiﬁc information needs to be readily accessible to compete
information reaching working dog industry
with other
stakeholders
(29). Meaningful engagement and improved
community outreach by researchers are needed to improve
into evidence-based best
the uptake of research ﬁndings

practice. The knowledge deﬁcit model of science communication
traditionally used by scientists, centers on the assumption that
ignorance is the basis for non-scientists in the community not
adopting evidence-based best practice (159). Scientists following
this model of science communication believe that one-way
dissemination of their scientiﬁc knowledge to individuals and
groups should be suﬃcient to prompt changes in their attitudes
and behavior (160). The deﬁcit model has been shown to be
less eﬀective than alternative bi-directional communication
approaches that draw on the social sciences, such as participatory
and community-based dialogue approaches (159, 161). This is
particularly true in morally contentious areas such as the care
and welfare of working dogs (29). When consulted, working
dog industry workers have told the authors that scientists were
not asking the questions they believed to be most important to
industry (135). This is critical as research can be impacted by
restricted access to working dog populations, and failure to win
the trust of the industry through the way we communicate about
our science may compound this.

Researcher access to working dog populations is limited and
study cohorts are often statistically small (6). Analyses often
draw on group averages, rather than group-based trajectory or
latent class analyses widely used in human health research (e.g.,
Nagin et al. (162)). These techniques allow analysis of subgroups
following similar response trajectories within a larger population,
which might oﬀer a more meaningful indication of individual
preferences, responses and welfare [e.g., (163)]. There are limited
opportunities for experimental manipulation with working dogs:
kennel and animal management practices and training programs
are generally well-established and successful dogs are required to
meet operational and business requirements. This reluctance to
change practices or participate in research, is seen in other areas
where investment takes place over an extended time and the end
product has high value (164, 165). Langston (164) notes that “the
role of industries in generating, shaping, and reinforcing norms, in
addition to producing products, is often overlooked.” In the non-
proﬁt sector particularly, where resources are limited, this results
in experimental change being viewed as a risk to the success of
the program.

The tendency for risk-averse industry groups to favor inaction
highlights the need for more eﬀective communication strategies
between all working dog industry stakeholders if a sustainable
outcome is to be achieved. A participatory, community-
based research approach where industry representatives and
researchers come together to formulate and answer questions
of mutual
interest is most likely to result in collaboration
that fosters a shared purpose, improving uptake of research
ﬁndings into evidence-based best practice (165, 166). Similar
found the participatory
strategies
tools they needed to
process gave farmers the analytical
think critically and make informed decisions,
improving
their conﬁdence when explaining the function of innovations
to others and the desire to engage in sustainable change
(165). This could be achieved by means of workshops to
develop a schedule of research initiatives that are publicly, or
government funded to better engage scientiﬁc researchers with
the working dog industry to demonstrate the mutual beneﬁts
of collaboration.

Working Dog Welfare Science Perspectives

Actively contributing to the development of this evidence base
is possible by organizations and practitioners collaborating with
scientiﬁc researchers. When this occurs, funders and researchers
should insist that the animal experience is robustly assessed by
multiple behavioral and validated physiological measures (29).
This change would serve to help balance our understanding of
the animal experience in working settings, where historically we
have emphasized the human outcomes. Greater interdisciplinary
collaboration between researchers (i.e., including animal welfare
scientists in working dog research design and teams) will enable
this, and result in greater uptake of research ﬁndings into
practice. Ideally, all granting bodies who fund exploration of
the possible beneﬁts to people from working dogs should also
fund and require that the working dogs’ physical and mental
experiences be reliably and robustly monitored and reported.

CONCLUSION

Assuring all stakeholders, including the general community, that
the welfare of working dogs is positive will be fundamental to
retaining social license to operate across the varied working
dog sectors. Good, transparent animal management practices
informed by independent science to assure positive animal
wellbeing will be needed to underpin a sustainable partnership
working with animals in this way. Our understanding of animal
welfare science and working dog performance have grown
rapidly in the last decade. However, many aspects of working dog
welfare have not been studied robustly and are ripe for research,
innovation, and improvement.

Opportunities to make valuable contributions to improving
the welfare of working dogs through further research have
been identiﬁed across ﬁve domains of animal welfare in this
analysis. Scientists working in this ﬁeld can collaborate, within
and between disciplines, to improve the validity of their work by
studying composite dog populations and exchanging experiences
between working dog sectors. In addition, researchers who
to familiarize themselves with updated science communication
strategies will have greater success in seeing their work translate
to improved industry practices. Psychological studies show us
that people tend to assume we are better at things than we
actually are. Knowing this, there exists a responsibility to assure
