Developing a cyberchondria 
severity scale to promote self-care 
among university students during 
COVID-19

Wan-Chen Hsu

Cyberchondria is a hybrid term signifying a state in which individuals compulsively search for 
health-related information online because of health distress or anxiety, further aggravating their 
worries. This study develops a Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS) to assess the current situation of 
university students. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using 145 valid questionnaires. 
Subsequently, a nationwide survey was conducted at various universities in Taiwan, and 802 
questionnaires were used for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The EFA led to the development of 
a CSS for college students with four constructs: increased anxiety (α = 0.91), obsessive-compulsive 
hypochondria (α = 0.87), perceived controllability (α = 0.88), and online physician-patient interaction 
(α = 0.86), with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92 and variance of 66.81%. The CFA indicated that item 
reliability ranged from 0.50 to 0.86, factor loadings ranged from 0.71 to 0.93, and the composite 
reliability for latent variables ranged from 0.83 to 0.90 (p < .001). The extracted average variance 
ranged from 0.46 to 0.60. There were significant differences in various dimensions: perceived 
controllability had the highest score and obsessive-compulsive hypochondria had the lowest 
(F3,2403=256.26, p < .001). Therefore, CSS has emerged as a reliable and valid measure. Future studies 
should explore the factors that influence cyberchondria, promote online health information searches, 
and enhance reading comprehension skills.

The  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic,  caused  primarily  by  novel  strains  of  severe  acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus, began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread globally1. 
The World Health Organization declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 
30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The pandemic’s progression has shown fluctuating trends with 
periods of decline and resurgence. Although there  has been  a reported decline in the number of cases since 
March 2022, there was a notable increase in weekly cases from early June to mid-July 2022. By August 2022, 
the number of confirmed cases exceeded 600 million globally, with over 6.4 million deaths. Despite widespread 
vaccinations and precautions, the pandemic’s future impact remains uncertain, with significant socio-economic 
and psychological repercussions, including stress and mental health burdens exacerbated by misinformation, 
vaccine  inequity,  and  disease-associated  stigma2.  Although  the  psychological  impact  of  COVID-19  has  been 
evaluated in the literature, further research is needed, particularly on the Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS) 
and related psychological outcomes.

Electronic  health  information  has  emerged  as  an  essential  tool  in  public  health  management.  Various 
health-based  websites  have  been  developed  to  address  the  increasing  demand  for  self-testing.  However,  the 
accuracy and quality of the information available on some of these websites is questionable, and facts can be 
misrepresented because the content is based on readers’ personal experiences. Although reputable organizations 
also provide information on their websites, it may not be edited or validated, which may directly or indirectly 
influence  readers’  understanding,  sense  of  judgment,  and  decision-making  abilities.  Furthermore,  some  self-
diagnosis websites exploit people economically by marketing drugs or other treatments2. Readers are exposed 
to a large amount of easily accessible online information; however, the close association between technological 
risks and individual lifestyles is often overlooked. People with electronic health literacy can gather high-quality

health information through online searches with fewer technological risks3. By contrast, individuals with fewer 
technology  skills  may  develop  cyberchondria  because  they  are  unable  to  evaluate  the  veracity  of  the  online 
health information available to them.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  significantly  impacted  the  behaviors  of  individuals,  social  groups,  and 
organizations, affecting emotions, cognition, behavior, overall mental health, and related psychosocial factors4–6. 
Quarantine and lockdown measures have triggered various psychological and behavioral responses, including 
depression, anxiety, stress, sleep disorders, increased healthcare demand, and suicidal ideation, resulting in a 
notable increase in the monthly suicide rate. These widespread effects have dramatically influenced the public’s 
general mental well-being. Aljaberi et al.4 examined COVID-19’s role in escalating anxiety and its disruptive 
impact  on  daily  life  due  to  quarantine  measures.  The  strong  associations  between  the  pandemic  and  the 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia highlight the urgent need for comprehensive psychological and 
public health interventions to mitigate these effects.

Cyberchondria is a neologism that combines cyber and hypochondriasis. It is a state in which an individual 
engages  in  compulsive  and  excessive  online  searches  for  health-related  information  because  of  distress  or 
anxiety, resulting in the onset of related symptoms7. During the pandemic, people’s daily lives were disrupted 
because they were restricted from leaving home. Consequently, patients’ physical activity decreased. On May 19, 
2021, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education announced the suspension of classes at all levels. This, along with other 
significant  social  changes,  resulted  in  many  challenges  for  higher  education  institutions,  bringing  a  renewed 
focus on student health, a topic that has already elicited concern8.

Taiwan’s internet penetration rate is higher than the global average. In recent years, the number of people using 
the Internet in Taiwan has increased. According to the 2022 Taiwan Broadband Internet Usage Survey Report, 
81.47% of the total population used mobile broadband, and 84.3% used mobile broadband9. The popularity of 
the Internet has contributed to the phenomenon of individuals using it for longer periods. Taiwanese people use 
the Internet for up to eight hours and seven minutes every day, higher than the global average of six hours and 
58 min. The primary purpose of Internet browsing is to find information and follow current events10. College 
students are among the main users of the Internet as a primary channel for obtaining information9.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected students’ Internet use. Abiddine et al.11 highlighted the fact that 
problematic  social  media  use  is  significantly  associated  with  increased  insomnia  and  decreased  overall  well-
being among university students. Social media addiction has also been linked to poor sleep quality, short sleep 
duration, and increased fatigue. These issues worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic because of increased 
online activity and the fear of missing out. Individuals usually search the Internet for health-related information 
to  ensure  peace  of  mind.  However,  search  results  may  make  one  feel  more  uncertain,  stressed,  and  anxious 
because online health information is not always accurate or reliable. This can lead to incorrect self-diagnosis12. 
Chen  and  Lee13  noted  that  people  often  use  their  limited  skills  to  search  for  and  evaluate  information  from 
various online sources of varying quality. Although readers may benefit from self-diagnosis and gain a better 
understanding  of  their  conditions  through  information  gathered  from  health  websites,  they  may  experience 
excessive worries about their physical health, which can lead to anxiety and life-threatening situations14. The 
risks associated with exposure to Internet technology and excessive online information highlight the importance 
of using health information judiciously. Kim et al.15 indicated that the existing research has explored variables 
such as technology use, perceptions, and intentions in relation to discomfort with technology. However, further 
investigations are warranted to identify the factors that predict technology-related discomfort. This is essential 
for  identifying  effective  strategies  to  alleviate  the  anxiety  and  hesitation  associated  with  technology  among 
adults. The  use  of  CSSs  has  also  been  analyzed  in  the  literature.  As  university  students  frequently  search  for 
health information online, the aim of this study was to create a CSS for surveying Taiwanese university students. 
The survey results may inspire further studies and help to formulate public health information communication 
strategies.  Previous  studies  have  shown  the  relationship  between  problematic  social  media  use  and  negative 
psychological  outcomes,  like  depression,  anxiety4,5,  and  poor  sleep  quality11.  However,  the  impact  of  self-
diagnosis through Internet use on university students must be further explored. The aim of this study was to 
develop  a  highly  valid  self-reporting  CSS  and  understand  the  current  status  of  university  students.  The  goal 
was  to  foster  self-care  behaviors  among  university  students  and  address  the  unique  challenges  posed  by  the 
pandemic. Cyberchondria is a new concept that has emerged with the rise of Internet use and is characterized 
by excessive online health information-seeking, which leads to increased health anxiety. Although the existing 
CSSs have provided some evidence of reliability  and  validity,  a  significant  gap remains in understanding the 
multi-dimensional nature of this phenomenon, especially in varying cultural contexts. Early studies primarily 
used single-item measures16, which did not capture the full complexity of cyberchondria.

Furthermore,  localized  scales  specifically  designed  for  Asian  populations  are  lacking.  Cultural  differences 
can significantly influence the manifestation and perception of cyberchondria, making it crucial to develop a 
scale that accurately reflects individuals’ experiences in Asian contexts. The aim of this study was to construct a 
multi-dimensional and multi-item CSS tailored to the Asian context, thereby enriching our understanding and 
providing a more comprehensive tool for future research and clinical assessments.

Literature review
Online health information-seeking behavior and cyberchondria
Online  information  seeking  can  be  unintentional,  passive,  or  active17.  It  typically  targets  individuals  seeking 
information  to  satisfy  their  personal  needs  or  objectives.  A  review  was  conducted  on  human  information 
behavior  (HIB)  in  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  health  crisis,  assuming  that  HIB  and  information  practices 
serve  as  tools  for  human  adaptation  to  evolving  life  circumstances.  Montesi18  found  it  imperative  to  further 
investigate  information-seeking  behaviors  within  particular  contexts,  focusing  on  the  needs  of  vulnerable 
and  marginalized  groups.  Additional  areas  for  exploration  include  the  intricate  dynamics  among  emotions,

knowledge,  and  behaviors  in  the  information-seeking  process,  a  more  nuanced  comprehension  of  local  and 
experiential  knowledge,  and  recognition  of  the  limitations  associated  with  information  and  communication 
technologies (ICTs). Health information-seeking is a behavioral pattern of accessing online resources to facilitate 
decision-making regarding one’s health19. Browsing the Internet for health information is termed online health 
information-seeking behavior and is widely prevalent today. The positive effects of online health information-
seeking behaviors, which include cost savings and improvements in health literacy, are mostly determined by 
readers’ ability to critically evaluate online information. This indicates that online health information may have 
either a positive or negative impact on individuals’ health20.

Diagnoses obtained from online searches can only provide temporary answers to health problems and are 
usually the reason for unease and anxiety. Readers often self-diagnose based on their symptoms by browsing the 
Internet. However, search results often increase anxiety because it is difficult to determine the authenticity of 
online health information21. Most people searching for health-related online content have not received medical 
training. Thus, their inability to critically examine online health information and understand technical jargon 
may have negative results, leading to anxiety and distress, which may develop into severe cyberchondria20.

CSSs  are  still  in  the  developmental  phase,  with  initial  studies  employing  a  single  question  to  gauge  the 
extent  of  cyberchondriasis.  Subsequent  research  has  progressively  formulated  multi-dimensional  and  multi-
question  severity  scales.  Within  these  scales,  “compulsion”  denotes  the  excessive  pursuit  of  online  health 
information,  “distress”  pertains  to  the  negative  emotions  and  physiological  responses  stemming  from  health 
information searches, “reassurance” involves seeking confirmation from medical professionals, and “mistrust 
of medical professionals” entails trust, or lack thereof, in online health information search results, as well as the 
trustworthiness of doctors, leading to contradictions and conflicts arising from diverse information sources16. 
Along with the development of reliable assessment tools, it is essential to include inquiries tailored to different 
populations  and  sample  characteristics  when  investigating  cyberchondria,  a  psychological  phenomenon 
described by Starcevic22.

Despite the increasing trend in health-related online browsing, post-search health behaviors have not been 
comprehensively examined. Myrick23 conducted a naturalistic experiment on the post-search emotions of 380 
Americans  who  searched  for  influenza  and  examined  how  to  construct  cognitive  and  behavioral  theoretical 
models.  She  found  that  the  participants  had  difficulty  searching  for  additional  information  related  to  the 
verification  of  dubious  or  questionable  sources.  Researchers  have  further  examined  ways  to  improve  search 
techniques  and  found  that  individuals  experience  many  emotions  (fear,  hope,  contentment,  interest,  and 
inspiration)  after  searching  for  information  and  that  social  cognitive  factors  mediate  and  affect  subsequent 
attitudes and behaviors. Emotions such as enthusiasm, interest, and hope during online searches positively affect 
confidence and behavioral intentions.

Online health information-seeking behavior outcomes
Social cognitive theory can be used to explain post-search results. For example, individuals’ confidence in finding 
quality health information, known as self-efficacy for searching, along with post-search outcome experiences, 
referred to as self-efficacy and outcome experiences, is a strong predictor of online health information-seeking 
behavior23.

In  Bandura’s24  social  cognitive  theory,  self-awareness  pertains  to  examining  one’s  ability  to  determine 
competency, which is the central focus of self-efficacy theory. Bandura24 considers self-efficacy to be the belief 
that individuals can organize and execute a series of actions to achieve certain results. This signifies their ability 
to participate in certain tasks or present certain behaviors and provides a subjective assessment of their work 
or behavior. This assessment may differ from actual competency but molds an individual’s internal thoughts, 
thereby affecting their effort to seek success or their level of perseverance when faced with difficulties. In other 
words, self-efficacy is an important factor driving behavioral motivation. Bandura25 proposes that efficacy and 
outcome experience are the two major axes of self-efficacy. Efficacy experience refers to an individual’s ability 
to determine whether they can successfully complete certain tasks. Outcome experience refers to one’s focus on 
evaluating the results arising from certain behaviors; that is, an individual believes that certain behaviors lead to 
certain outcomes. A positive self-evaluation results in contentment, confidence, and self-validation, whereas a 
negative self-evaluation leads to self-deprecation and blame.

One may believe that certain behaviors lead to certain outcomes (high-outcome experiences) but that an 
action may not be performed if there are doubts about one’s ability to perform certain behaviors (low-outcome 
experiences).  For  example,  most  people  believe  that  a  mix  of  true  and  false  information  is  available  online; 
however, they still browse the internet to find solutions or dispel doubts about their health problems. Therefore, 
an  individual’s  knowledge  may  not  be  equivalent  to  their  behavior,  and  the  efficacy  experience  may  not  be 
consistent with the outcome experiences.

Bandura26 found that different self-efficacy scales yielded varying psychological results when used to evaluate 
behavioral outcomes. When efficacy and outcome experiences are high, an individual will have the confidence 
to  act.  When  efficacy  experience  is  low,  a  person  tends  to  become  stuck  when  facing  challenges,  ultimately 
leading to failure. However, when efficacy experience is high and outcome experience is low, people exert more 
effort to overcome adversity, leading them to not give up easily. Thus, a person’s behaviors in any given situation 
are affected by efficacy and outcome experiences. Furthermore, the interaction between these two factors has 
a significant impact on self-efficacy. In addition, individuals may encounter two types of futility: efficacy- and 
outcome-based. Individuals must enhance their capabilities and self-efficacy to manage efficacy-based futility. 
Regarding  outcome-based  futility,  individuals  must  change  their  environments  and  identify  suitable  tasks. 
Overcoming both forms of futility empowers them to take more affirmative action.

Starcevic and Berle’s7 findings are consistent with the theoretical explanation of self-efficacy. According to 
these studies, when individuals with high anxiety search for health information online, they feel relieved after

receiving assurance, particularly from their physicians. This reinforces their online search behaviors. In contrast, 
people who search for online information to handle their negative emotions are more likely to continue to rely 
on the internet for health information, which may lead them to experience repeated disappointments, thereby 
aggravating their emotional burdens and exacerbating the severity of their cyberchondria. Consequently, they 
might refrain from conducting online searches.

When self-efficacy theory is applied to university students’ online health information-seeking behavior, the 
axis of efficacy experience indicates that  such  behavior  is  a  form of  evaluation, whereas outcome experience 
indicates  that  the  outcome  influences  their  online  information-seeking  behavior.  When  university  students’ 
efficacy and outcome experience were high, they had the confidence to overcome the limitations of their online 
behavior. They rated themselves highly in post-search assessments, which resulted in a positive application of 
online health information. When their efficacy experience was low, they tended to become stuck and unable 
to solve their problems. This ultimately led to failure or lack of results from online health information-seeking 
behaviors. However, when their efficacy experience was high and outcome experience was low, they were likely 
to  increase  their  online  presence  or  employ  other  methods  to  overcome  challenges,  reflecting  the  fact  that 
difficult challenges cause greater concern and result in excessive critical thinking and resistance27.

Methods
Research design
This study adopted a survey research method using stratified cluster sampling. The samples were drawn based 
on the proportion of university students in the northern, central, southern, and eastern regions, with classes as 
the sampling units. The quality of the CSS was tested, and the current status of university students was analyzed.

Participants and sample size
An  official  cyberchondria  severity  questionnaire  was  constructed  using  convenience  sampling  to  recruit 
participants from four universities, one each representing northern, central, southern, and eastern Taiwan. The 
class formed a unit for block sampling in these four universities, with one class each from general education 
centers recruited as a pilot sample. Gorsuch28 recommends that the sample size should be at least five times 
the  number  of  questions.  With  more  than  100  questionnaires  for  factor  analysis,  a  total  of  145  valid  pilot 
questionnaires  were  administered.  Furthermore,  data  from  the  Department  of  Statistics  of  the  Ministry  of 
Education29  indicate  that  the  four  universities  had  1,035,218  students  in  2017.  Stratified  block  sampling  was 
used to obtain more representative samples, in which the region was used for stratification. The proportion of 
university students from Taiwan’s four regions was used as the basis for the sample size. Of the 802 final samples, 
367 (46%) were from female participants and 435 (54%) were from male participants. Hair et al.30 suggested that 
for covariance based on structural equation modeling (SEM; e.g., AMOS), the analysis requires a sample size 
greater than 10030,31. In this study, a sample size of 802 was considered adequate for employing SEM to address 
the research objectives.

Ethical approval and consent to participate
Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Research Committee of National Cheng Kung University (No. 110-
573-2), and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants had the right to withdraw from 
the  study  at  any  time.  Principles  of  anonymity  and  confidentiality  were  strictly  followed.  All  methods  were 
carried out in accordance with relevant ethical standards, guidelines, and regulations.

Instruments
The CSSs used in this study were modified from those proposed by White and Horvitz32 and Batigün et al.33. 
The items were rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 2 (rarely), 3 (sometimes), 4 (often), 
and 5 (always). After completing the initial scale, the researchers invited two experts in the field of psychological 
counseling and two university students to review the items. After reviewing and revising the questionnaire, a 
preliminary scale was developed.

Procedures and data analysis
Two experts reviewed the content validity of the CSS. Next, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed 
on the preliminary test samples, followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the final samples using SEM. 
AMOS 7.0 was used for statistical processing and testing of the composite reliability of this univariate model. 
EFA was conducted using 145 valid questionnaires. Subsequently, a nationwide survey was conducted at various 
universities in Taiwan; 802 questionnaires were used for CFA, and the current status of cyberchondria among 
university students was analyzed. SPSS 20 was used to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Repeated-
measures analysis of variance was used to compare the differences in the current status and various aspects of 
cyberchondria severity among the participants. The scale construction process in this study included two main 
steps: EFA and CFA.

Exploratory factor analysis
Using  the  orthogonal  rotation  method,  EFA  was  conducted  to  determine  the  number  of  underlying  factors. 
The extracted factors needed to meet several  criteria,  including  a  theoretical justification, scree plot, Kaiser’s 
eigenvalue ≥ 1, and total variance explained ≥ 0.6034. In addition, the direction and proportion of factor loading 
needed to be ≥ 0.55, and the corrected item-total correlation needed to be at least 0.30 and positive30.

Confirmatory factor analysis
CFA was conducted to confirm the hypothesized measurement model. CFA is meant for measurement models 
within  SEM  analysis,  whereas  full-fledged  SEM  comprises  a  measurement  and  a  structural  model.  In  other 
words, CFA deals with the relationships between observed measures or indicators (e.g., test items, test scores, 
and behavioral observation ratings) and latent variables or factors but not the relationship between exogenous 
latent variables and endogenous latent variables31. This study evaluates the quality of the CSS measurement tool 
based on Preliminary Fit Criteria, Overall Model Fit Criteria, and a Fit of Internal Structural Model35,36, which 
are presented in the findings.

Results
Construction of the CSS
This study aimed to construct questions for the CSS and test its reliability and validity. Data from 145 university 
students were used for item analysis. Four constructs accounting for 66.81% of the total variation were obtained 
from the factor analysis: increased anxiety (six items), obsessive-compulsive hypochondria (six items), perceived 
controllability (five items), and online physician-patient interaction (six items). Increased anxiety refers to the 
anxiety experienced by an individual due to apprehensions about online content seeking to understand a disease 
or its symptoms. Obsessive-compulsive hypochondria refers to excessive worry or excessive Internet surfing to 
understand a disease or its symptoms. Perceived controllability refers to the decreased doubts or psychological 
burdens caused by an online search for health information. Online physician-patient interaction refers to an 
individual’s online information search, which affects their judgment of their symptoms.

This  study  used  802  final  scales  for  the  CFA.  Additionally,  we  followed  the  recommendations  of  Bagozzi 
and  Yi35  and  Yu36.  Compatibility  between  the  model  and  the  actual  observational  data  was  tested  using  the 
Preliminary  Fit  Criteria,  Overall  Model  Fit  Criteria,  and  Fit  of  Internal  Structural  Model.  Additionally,  each 
factor  needed  to  have  at  least  one  indicator  with  a  standardized  factor  load  above  0.70,  and  the  construct 
reliability of each factor needed to be above 0.50. The results of the initial model analysis satisfied these criteria 
(Table 1). The official scale (Table 2) and model used in this study (Fig. 1) are shown below.

Analysis of the current status of university students’ cyberchondria severity
The mean individual item score of the cyberchondria severity constructs was between 2.19 and 2.75 (2 = rarely 
and  3 = sometimes),  and  the  mean  scores  of  the  individual  items  were  all  below  the  median.  This  finding 
indicated that college students do not often experience anxiety or hypochondria during their online searches 
for health-related information. They do not feel that anxiety is controllable, nor do they adopt online physician-
patient interaction behavior (Table 3). As the students’ item scores for the four constructs differed, the mean 
individual scores were used for the univariate variance analysis. The results showed significant differences in the 
cyberchondria severity constructs (F [3, 2403]= 256.26, p < .001, η2 = 0.16).

The least significant difference test was used as a post hoc test. The results showed that perceived controllability 
had the highest score, with item 14, “Searching for health-related information online lets me find information 
regarding my medical condition from reputable sources (e.g., hospital websites), which decreases my anxiety,” 
obtaining the highest score (M = 2.79). The obsessive-compulsive hypochondria construct had the highest score, 
in which item 11, “I feel that I am someone who worries excessively about health,” had the highest score (2.29). 
This finding indicates that university students do not worry excessively about their health.

university students.

The various constructs showed a significant positive correlation between perceived controllability and online 
physician-patient interaction and increased anxiety and obsessive-compulsive hypochondria. This indicates that 
students with controlled anxiety and frequent online physician-patient interactions during their Internet searches 
also have increased anxiety and obsessive-compulsive hypochondria. Furthermore, perceived controllability was 
significantly positively correlated with online physician-patient interactions.

Discussion
This study demonstrated that the CSS developed for university students has good validity and reliability. The scale 
was divided into four constructs: increased anxiety (α = 0.908), obsessive-compulsive hypochondria (α = 0.865), 
perceived controllability (α = 0.884), and online physician-patient interaction (α = 0.858). The Cronbach’s alpha 
ranged from 0.858 to 0.908. A CFA of 802 questionnaires showed that item reliability ranged from 0.50 to 0.86, 
factor loadings ranged from 0.71 to 0.93, and the composite reliability for latent variables ranged from 0.83 to 
0.90 (p < .001). The extracted average variance ranged from 0.46 to 0.60. Cyberchondria severity differed among 
university students and showed stratification. Significant differences were found in various dimensions of the 
CSS, of which perceived controllability had the highest score and obsessive-compulsive hypochondria had the 
lowest.  This  study  contributes  to  the  theoretical  understanding  of  cyberchondria  among  university  students, 
particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The development and validation of the CSS provides a robust tool 
for future research in this area. Practically, the CSS can be used by university health services to identify students 
at  risk  of  cyberchondria  and  develop  targeted  interventions  to  foster  self-care  behaviors.  This  is  particularly 
relevant given the increased reliance on online health information during the pandemic.

The  various  constructs  were  significantly  correlated  with  each  other;  increased  anxiety  and  obsessive-
compulsive hypochondria showed a significant moderate positive correlation with perceived controllability and 
online physician-patient interaction. When individuals with high health anxiety search for health information 
online,  their  anxiety  is  alleviated  after  receiving  assurance  from  others  (particularly  doctors).  This,  in  turn, 
reinforces online health information search behaviors7. By contrast, if individuals experience more uneasiness 
or  fear,  they  may  continue  to  search  for  health  information  online  to  cope  with  their  negative  emotions. 
However,  they  may  experience  repeated  disappointment,  which  may  aggravate  their  emotional  burden  and

increase cyberchondria severity20. These findings are consistent with Bandura’s 1982 study26, which stated that 
individuals with higher self-efficacy have more confidence or determination to perform corresponding actions. 
Uncertainty and doubt may increase when interpreting online information.

The  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  confined  people  to  their  homes  and  upended  routines,  has  intensified 
digital  scouring.  Although  readers  may  benefit  from  self-diagnosis  and  gain  a  better  understanding  of  their 
condition  through  information  gathered  from  health  websites,  self-diagnosis  may  cause  excessive  worries 
about  physical  health,  which  can  lead  to  anxiety  and  life-threatening  situations37.  The  risks  associated  with 
exposure  to  Internet  technology  and  excessive  online  information  highlight  the  importance  of  using  health 
information judiciously38. Regarding online search techniques affecting cyberchondria among students, Hsu37 
found that 59% of the participants used jargon as a keyword, and only 27% used Boolean logic in their search 
strategy.  Of  the  participants,  81%  were  concerned  about  the  date  on  which  the  information  was  obtained, 
whereas 85% did not consider the author’s profession. This indicates that there is scope for improvement in the 
students’ functional and critical literacy. Moreover, the motivation from self-awareness to action is driven by 
critical awareness, and improving critical skills teaching is key to guiding students in acquiring health literacy. 
In  particular,  the  information  available  on  the  Internet  is  not  fully  reliable,  and  attention  should  be  paid  to 
students’ ability to search for and evaluate it. Lee et al.39 indicated that older adults’ acquisition and utilization 
of ICT skills contributed to enhancements in their overall eHealth literacy and the perceived usefulness of the 
Internet. Individuals who initially harbored technophobia experienced a reduction in anxiety and boosted their

confidence when using computer technology over the course of the study. Thus, the desirability and feasibility of 
developing targeted educational programs for university students with limited access to ICT and minimal digital 
literacy are important.

Conclusions and recommendations
The CSS for university students showed that various markers had a good fit and that the scale had good validity 
and reliability. However, this scale is still in the initial stages of development. Various constructs were significantly 
correlated with each other; increased anxiety and obsessive-compulsive hypochondria showed a significantly 
moderate  positive  correlation  with  perceived  controllability  and  online  physician-patient  interaction.  As  this 
study included only healthy university students, subsequent studies should recruit different adult populations for 
a more holistic health perspective. Additionally, the participants’ innermost thoughts on specific questions could 
not be obtained as the study employed a self-rated scale. Therefore, we recommend broad-based qualitative and 
quantitative  designs  for  future  studies  to  obtain  a  deeper  understanding  of  online  information  searches  and 
cyberchondria. As studies on CSSs are in their infancy, further research should focus on examining the factors 
affecting cyberchondria, promoting online health information searches, and enhancing reading comprehension. 
This study constructed a CSS scale, but the single-measurement model has limitations in its application. One 
limitation  was  its  cross-sectional  design,  which  prevented  the  establishment  of  causality.  Future  longitudinal 
studies are needed to examine the causal relationships among Internet use, cyberchondria, and psychological 
outcomes. Scale development was limited to the scale itself and lacked concurrent validity testing. It is suggested 
that future research should investigate related variables such as anxiety and stress5 to further validate the cross-
validation of the scale. In addition, the cross-sectional design prevented us from establishing causality. Future 
longitudinal  studies  are  needed  to  examine  the  causal  relationships  among  Internet  use,  cyberchondria,  and 
psychological outcomes.
