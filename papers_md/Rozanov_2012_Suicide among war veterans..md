Abstract: Studies aiming to identify if war veterans are at higher risk of suicide have often 
produced  inconsistent  results;  this  could  be  due  to  the  complexity  of  comparisons  and 
different methodological approaches. It should be noted that this contingent has many risk 
factors, such as stressful exposures, wounds, brain trauma and pain syndrome. Most recent 
observations confirm that veterans are really more likely to die of suicide as compared to 
the general population; they are also more likely to experience suicidal ideation and suffer 
from  mental  health  problems.  Suicides  are  more  frequent  in  those  who  develop  PTSD, 
depression and comorbid states due to war exposure. Combat stress and its’ frequency may 
be an important factor leading to suicide within the frame of the stress-vulnerability model. 
According to this model, the effects of stress may interact with social factors, interpersonal 
relations  and  psychological  variables  producing  suicidal  tendencies.  Modern  understanding 
of stress-vulnerability mechanisms based on genetic predispositions, early life development, 
level of exposure to stress and stress-reactivity together with interpersonal aspects may help 
to build more effective suicide prevention programs based on universal/selective/indicated 
prevention principles.

1. Introduction 

When discussing suicides in specific occupational or social groups, several main questions usually 
arise:  (1)  are  representatives  of  the  specific  group  at  higher  risk  of  suicide  compared  to  the  rest  of 
population?;  (2)  are  there  any  specific  features  of  environmental  or  social  processes  within  these 
groups, which may impact suicide rates?; (3) can targeted prevention programs be implemented within 
this framework and is it possible to improve its potential efficacy?  

In this review, we are aiming to better understand the potential risk factors and pathways leading to 
suicides among war veterans. This does not mean all military. Systematic analyses regarding suicide in 
various  national  militaries  show  (i.e.,  with  very  rare  exceptions)  that  suicide  rates  are  lower  in  the 
military when compared to corresponding age and gender groups from the general population [1–3]. 
Thus, being in the armed forces does not necessarily mean higher risk of suicide. Today, the military 
setting  is  quite  different  from  what  was  observed  and  extensively  discussed  (i.e.,  while  describing 
altruistic  suicide)  by  Durkheim  in  his  classical  work.  Focus  has  shifted  to  specific  military  persons 
who have experienced stressful events in certain hostile environments, e.g., modern war zones. Thus, 
former  military  that  are  discharged  after  being  at  war  (referred  to  as  war  veterans)  is  an  important 
topic, not only concerning suicide, but regarding psychological and emotional consequences of war as 
well.  To  put  in  a  broader  context,  the  military  is  the  subject  of  discussion  concerning  mental  health 
consequences of war exposures, wherein suicide is one of the most striking [4–6]. It must be noted that 
war  veterans  constitute  only  a  part  of  the  general  heterogeneous  veterans’  population.  This  more 
general contingent may be at higher risk too, and after persons are discharged from the military, it is 
important to access the psychosocial implications upon returning to civilian status. On the other hand 
combat  stress  and  being  directly  in  a  war  zone,  as  can  be  seen  further,  seems  to  play  the  most 
important role.  

There is no consensus in the expert community regarding suicide rates among veterans of military 
services. Different studies have produced conflicting results; this is potentially due to the different time 
periods,  methodology  and  socio-cultural  contexts  implemented.  On  the  other  hand,  mental  health 
problems  among  those  who  have  been  involved  in  war  conflicts  attract  more  attention;  efforts  are 
taken  by  governments,  public  organizations  and  veterans’  associations  to  prevent  suicides  in  this 
contingent. This is especially true for USA where alarming news of growing suicide rates in the Army 
are being disseminated. Despite prevention measures in the military, the number of suicides continues 
to  increase  [7–10].  Quite  recent  analyses  from  USA  definitely  answered  “no”  to  the  question  
“Is there an epidemic of suicides among current and former US military personnel?” [11,12]. We can 
confirm this conclusion, especially in regards to inappropriate formulations used by mass media. But, 
the  same  authors,  who  are  monitoring  the  situation  in  USA  for  many  years,  consider  that  the  most 
recent increased risk of suicide among war veterans warrants attention [11]. Suicides in war veterans 
are a sensitive topic and emerging knowledge from current and previous research should be reviewed 
occasionally to provide a more objective basis for prevention measures and this may be important for 
different countries. 

It  is  suggested  (confirmed  in  many  studies)  that  there  are  multiple  risk  factors  among  military 
persons when faced with civilian life after retirement and combat exposures. These individuals (mostly 
males,  though  this  trend  appears  to  be  shifting)  often  enter  into  middle  age  carrying  the  burden  of 

 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 

2506 

stressful war experiences; being very familiar with firearms, with growing alcohol problem, higher risk 
for  physical  health  problems  due  to  previous  trauma,  pain  syndrome,  often  facing  family  conflicts, 
social isolation etc. [13,14]. On the other hand the majority of military suicides  occur among young 
males,  shortly  after  being  discharged  from  military  service.  Thus,  this  raises  the  question  of  why 
suicides  are  becoming  more  common  among  younger  veterans.  We  consider  that  this,  as  well  as  many 
other specific features of veteran suicides, can be understood within the “stress-vulnerability model” [15]. 

This model is based on bio-psychosocial synthesis encountering complex relations between genetic 
predispositions,  personality  dimensions  and  deteriorating  (or  protective)  influences  of  the  social 
environment. From this  point of view, environmental stressful exposures throughout life play a very 
important role. There is an extensive body of evidence showing that childhood abuse and adult adverse 
exposures  may  provoke  psychopathology  such  as  mood  disorders,  PTSD  or  alcohol  and  drug  abuse 
and dependence, thereby, leading to suicide [16–18]. At every stage of developmental trajectory, i.e., 
from  prenatal  state  and  early  childhood  to  middle  and  older  age,  stressful  life  events  interact  with 
genetic  predispositions  and  produce  adaptive  or  maladaptive  behavioural,  emotional  and  cognitive 
responses, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms that establish higher reactivity of stress-systems of 
the  organism  [19–21].  This  concept  also  complies  with  recently  published  explanations  of  growing 
suicides among war veterans, such as Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which gives valuable insight in 
deeper psychological mechanisms [22].  

2. Methodology 

An electronic literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE database. Papers published in 
English  were  selected.  There  were  no  restrictions  on  publication  date  or  publication  status.  The 
identifiers  used  were  “suicides  in  war  veterans”,  “suicides  in  the  military”  and  “military  mental 
health”, combined with the identifiers “suicide*”, or “suicidal behavior” or “self-injurious behavior”. 
Papers  were  included  in  the  review  if  they  met  the  following  inclusion  criteria:  discussed  issues  as 
suicidal behaviour or suicide prevention among war veterans, former peacekeepers or representatives 
of  any  other  militarized  occupations.  Papers  were  independently  and  systematically  reviewed  by 
experienced  researchers.  According  to  the  inclusion  criteria,  97  relevant  publications  were  identified 
on  the  basis  of  the  title  and  the  abstract.  The  full-text  of  57  papers  was  available  and  retrieved  for 
further  analysis.  Studies  were  assessed  regarding  study  type,  study  population,  methodology  and 
outcome  measures.  The  heterogeneity  of  study  populations,  and  the  methodology,  ruled  out  formal 
meta-analysis, therefore a narrative synthesis is presented. 

3. Results and Discussion 

Though  suicides  in  the  military  have  been  depicted  for  centuries,  suicide  among  retired  war 
veterans  started  to  attract  more  attention  in  the  USA  shortly  after  the  Vietnam  War  [23,24].  Initial 
studies in this field have not confirmed higher suicide rates in this group; however, it has been noted 
that males, who have been at war, tend to commit suicide at a younger age compared to the general 
population.  Research  indicates  that  the  presence  of  mental  illness  leads  to  a  nine-fold  increase  in 
suicide rates [24]. After the inclusion of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as a new diagnosis in 
the DSM-III, the awareness of this problem substantially increased [25]; this perhaps was the result of 

 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 

2507 

intense investigations concerning the  mental state of those  who have undergone war. Studies among 
veterans from the Vietnam War have shown that there is a direct causal link between traumatic stress 
exposure and subsequent PTSD [26]. Moreover, those Vietnam veterans who had a diagnosis of PTSD 
were  shown  to  have  a  significantly  (~4-fold)  increased  standardised  mortality  rate  of  suicide  [27]; 
those who had been wounded were also at higher suicide risk [28]. In other studies, Vietnam veterans 
were  shown  to  have  increased  levels  of  suicidal  ideation  and  a  history  of  suicide  attempts;  this  was 
also highly correlated with a PTSD diagnosis. With additional diagnoses, particularly depression, there 
was an even stronger association [29,30]. However, after the Vietnam studies, research began to focus 
on  the  Gulf  War  veterans.  The  risk  of  suicide  in  this  cohort  did  not  increase  in  comparison  to  other 
veterans, who did not take part in the war, nor the general population [31,32].  

In a new era, conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have involved bigger contingents of military from 
different countries (mostly from USA) and for longer period of time. Suicides in veterans, tracked by 
different official and public structures and agencies, have become an important public health concern, 
and  it  continuously  attracts  the  attention  of  mass  media,  politicians  and  civil  society.  In  the  USA, 
“record high” suicide rates have been recently reported in both the armed forces (i.e., higher than the 
general population for the first time in history) and in military personnel returning from war [10,33]. 
An  important  landmark  comprised  a  publication  indicating  that  veterans  returning  from  Iraq  and 
Afghanistan  war  zones  had  significantly  higher  standardized  mortality  ratio  (SMR)  compared  to  the 
general  population  [34].  In  another  important  study,  about  104,000  of  veterans  comprising  different 
ages from Vietnam and post-Vietnam conflicts were compared with more than 200,000 non-veterans 
Results  confirmed  that  the  risk  of  suicide  among  war  veterans  was  higher  than  non-veterans  [13]. 
However,  other  research  (using  different  access  methods)  that  analysed  mortality  rates  among  some 
500,000 participants in the Cancer Prevention Study concluded that the risk of death by suicide among 
middle-aged and older US males was independent of veteran status [14]. Several other studies found 
that  suicide  mortality  in  war  veterans’  cohorts  are  not  higher  in  males  compared  to  the  general 
population; however, all-cause mortality, vehicle-related and drug-related mortality (often suspected as 
hidden  suicides)  were  higher  among  the  non-veteran  group  [35,36].  Strong  evidence  coming  from 
most cited studies [13,34] leaves the impression of a growing problem, especially in USA. It may also 
reflect  the  special  situation  found  in  USA.  Among  Australian  veterans  of  the  Vietnam  War,  suicide 
mortality rates did not significantly differ compared to the general population and non-veterans [37]. 
Similar findings were reported regarding UK veterans who took part in the Gulf War [38]. However, 
the majority of publications regarding suicide among war veterans derives from USA; studies performed 
by American authors often aim to evaluate explicit risk factors and suggest more preventive strategies.  
In Table 1, relevant studies are summarized, which provide the possibility for an evaluation with a 

historical perspective.  

Although  there  are  conflicting  results  in  this  field,  the  studies  included  in  this  systematic  review 
suggest  that  war  veterans  are  at  higher  risk  of  suicide  compared  to  the  general  population.  Recent 
evidence  has  also  underscored  the  importance  of  PTSD  as  an  underlying  risk  factor  of  suicide. This 
raises the question on what may be the reasons behind the recent reports on the association between 
PTSD diagnoses and suicide rates. Do young military personnel have higher risks and vulnerabilities 
which  are  further  exacerbated  by  military  service  or  is  it  specifically  connected  with  the  changing 
military situation? Is it due to the fact that in recent mission persons are faced with longer stays in the

2508 

war  zone,  growing  number  of  service  tours  (i.e.,  6-month  periods  of  war  conditions),  increasing 
stressful exposures in war zones? Are we facing growing feelings of guilt, existential crises or other 
complex problems of transition to civilian life due to changing socio-economic situation?

without PTSD). 
In comparison with the US male 
general population, veterans 
hospitalized due to combat wound 
or wounded more than once had a 
significantly increased risk of 
suicide (SMR 1.22 and  
1.58 respectively).

Main results 
There was a small but significant 
excess of deaths in the Gulf War 
veterans mainly caused by 
accidents. No difference in 
suicides was found (RR = 0.94). 
Mortality from “external” causes 
was higher in the Gulf cohort 
(mortality rate ratio 1.18) however, 
no excess of deaths were recorded 
as suicide. 
The crude RRs for suicides and 
homicides were somewhat 
elevated in the first 5 years (1.72) 
but not in the next 5 years of 
follow-up (0.93). 
Veterans diagnosed with PTSD 
had an increased risk of death from 
multiple causes, especially from 
external, which included suicide, 
hazard ratio 2.3. 
0.21% of veterans completed 
suicide during the follow-up, 
younger and older veterans were at 
higher risk than middle-aged ones, 
those with PTSD had overall lower 
risk of suicide. 
Over time veterans were twice as 
likely (adjusted hazard ratio 2.13) 
to die of suicide compared  
with male nonveterans in the 
general population. 
The overall risk for suicide was 
not significantly elevated  
(SMR 1.15) but was increased for 
former active duty veterans 
(SMR1.33) and for veterans 
diagnosed with a selected mental 
disorder (SMR 1.77). The most 
common methods of suicide were 
by firearm (73%) and  
by hanging (21%).

Individuals who received care at 
US Veterans Administration 
between fiscal years 2001 to 
2006, all patients with a history 
of traumatic brain injury  
(n = 49,626). 

From post-traumatic patients  
6 (27.3%) has made a total of  
14 suicide attempts. 

Veterans with PTSD were more 
than 4 times as likely to endorse 
suicidal ideation. Risk for suicidal 
ideation was 5.7 times greater in 
veterans who screened positive for 
two or more comorbid disorders. 
In age-adjusted analyses the  
risk of suicide did not differ by 
veteran status. 
Odds of completed suicide were 
significantly increased for patients 
with panic disorder (OR 1.26) and 
who received any antianxiety 
medication (OR 1.71). Odds of 
completed suicide were decreased 
among patients with comorbid 
posttraumatic stress disorder  
(OR 0.87). 
The male and female veteran 
suicide decedents were, 
respectively, 1.3 and 1.6 times 
more likely to use firearms relative 
to nonveterans. 
Veterans with severe pain were 
more likely (hazards ratio 1.33) to 
die by suicide than patients 
experiencing none, mild or 
moderate pain. 
Veterans with a history of TBI 
were 1.55 times more likely to die 
by suicide, those with 
concussion/cranial fracture were 
1.98 times, and those with 
contusion/ /traumatic intracranial 
hemorrhage were 1.34 times more 
likely to die by suicide. 

It must be taken into consideration that long-term psychological consequences of war and traumatic 
stress, in general, can be seen across war veterans’ globally. Mental health among war veterans is very 

 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 

2511 

similar  across  cultures,  notwithstanding  socioeconomic  differences.  Suicide  rates  are  usually  not 
calculated  and  compared  to  the  general  population;  however,  some  research  has  been  performed  on 
Russian  veterans  (i.e.,  Afghanistan  and  Chechnya),  British  Falkland  conflict  veterans,  and  Croatian 
local  war  veterans  [39,40].  Deahl  and  co-authors  [6]  suggest  that  mental  health  problems  of  
ex-military  are  diverse,  polymorphic  and  have  psychosocial  consequences  like  social  exclusion, 
homelessness, self-harm and substance abuse. In the longitudinal study of male veterans with a history 
of  drug  abuse,  it  was  found  that  PTSD,  drug-dependence,  non-fatal  attempted  suicides  and  suicidal 
ideation had a strong continuity over time [41], with suicidal ideation some 4-times more frequent in 
PTSD-sufferers  [42].  Veterans  diagnosed  with  PTSD  have  an  increased  risk  of  death,  not  only  from 
suicide, but from other causes as well [43]. Evidence shows that suicide rates are higher among older 
and  younger  depressed  veterans  with  PTSD  compared  to  middle-aged  veterans  [44].  Moreover, 
younger males were shown to have the highest suicide risk [23].  

Among former military personnel, there are many publications that focus on the role of underlying 
disorders  in  the  genesis  of  suicidality,  especially  PTSD.  PTSD  is  a  highly  comorbid  disorder  with  a 
growing prevalence among war veterans. PTSD is commonly present in those veterans with a previous 
history  of  suicide  attempts,  psychopathology  and  severe  substance  abuse  characteristics  [45,46]. 
Aggressive and self-aggressive behaviour in veterans occurs more often in PTSD cases [47]; veterans 
diagnosed  with  PTSD  have  4-times  as  many  firearms  as  non-veterans  [48].  These  data  provide  an 
explanation  for  many  veteran  suicides;  however,  suicide  cannot  be  explicated  as  the  result  of  one 
particular mental disorder. Moreover, as can be seen from Table 1 some studies do not confirm that 
those war veterans who suffer PTSD are more likely to commit suicide. Notwithstanding, depression is 
considered  the  leading  underlying  disorder  for  suicide  and  recent  studies  suggest  that  PTSD  has  a 
pronounced effect on risk mostly if comorbid with depression. This issue was addressed by L. Sher, 
who  indicated  a  significant  comorbidity  between  PTSD  and  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD)  [49]. 
Recently, the same author proposed that  the majority of individuals diagnosed with comorbid PTSD 
and  MDD  have  a  psychobiological  condition  that  can  be  termed  as  “posttraumatic  mood  disorder” 
(PTMD).  The  author  described  studies  suggesting  that  patients  suffering  from  comorbid  PTSD  and 
MDD differ clinically and biologically from individuals with PTSD alone or MDD alone. Individuals 
with  comorbid  PTSD  and  MDD  are  characterized  by  a  greater  severity  of  symptoms,  increased 
suicidality, and a higher level of impairment in social and occupational functioning [50]. Taking into 
account  the  “many  faces”  of  male  depression  (aggression,  alcohol  abuse,  poor  social  functioning) 
leading  to  male  vulnerability  and  gender  related  public  health  paradoxes  [51],  this  idea  looks  very 
attractive. Logically the model of suicidal behavior in war veterans with PTMD has been proposed by 
L.  Sher  which  consists  of  the  following  components:  (1)  genetic  factors;  (2)  prenatal  development;  
(3)  biological  and  psychosocial  influences  from  birth  to  mobilization/deployment;  (4)  mobilization/ 
pre-deployment stress; (5) combat stress, traumatic brain injury, and physical injury; (6) post-deployment 
stress;  (7)  biological  and  psychosocial  influences  after  the  deployment;  (8)  trigger  (precipitant)  of  a 
suicidal  act;  and  (9)  suicidal  act.  The  first  four  components,  according  to  the  proposed  model, 
determine  the  vulnerability  to  combat  stress;  whereas,  the  first  seven  components  ascertain  a 
predisposition  to  suicidal  behavior,  which  is  a  key  element  that  differentiates  PTMD  patients  with 
high- and low-risks of suicide [49,50]. Concerning  the  three key components of the suicidal  process 
(i.e.,  biological,  personality/psychological  and  social/environmental),  the  model  proposed  by  Sher  is

congruent with the more general stress-vulnerability model [9] and takes into account specific social 
interactions and stressors of the military. 

Modern challenges of growing war conflicts, and its potential for comorbid psychopathologies [4–6,52], 
should  be  taken  into  consideration  as  a  warning  for  exacerbating  suicides,  suicide  attempts  and 
psychopathology  among  newly  released  military  personnel.  This  has  been  underscored  in  recent 
studies. Janet Wiener and colleagues have followed more than 10,000 veterans, who were hospitalized 
at  the  Veterans  Affairs  medical  centre  between  1993  and  1998  following  a  suicide  attempt.  Results 
showed  that  suicide  accounted  for  13%  of  all  deaths  in  the  study  cohort,  while  in  the  general 
population, it accounted for only 1.8% of all deaths [53]. There was a high prevalence of diagnosed 
alcohol disorder or abuse (31.8%), drug dependence or abuse (21.8%), psychoses (21.2%), depression 
(18.5%)  and  hypertension  (14.2%)  in  this  cohort.  Moreover,  veterans  who  attempted  suicide  had  a 
substantially  higher  mortality  rate  compared  with  the  non-suicide,  e.g.,  heart  diseases,  cancer  and 
traffic  accidents.  Thus,  mental  health  problems  appeared  to  be  significantly  correlated  with  general 
health  and  mortality.  The  above  mentioned  study  also  reported  on  women  suicides  among  veterans. 
Among female suicide attempters, completed suicide appeared to be the leading cause of death, while 
in  males,  it  was  second  leading  cause.  This  is  confirmed  in  another  study,  which  examined  some  
6,000 female suicides; results revealed that women aged from 18 to 35 years, who served in the US 
military, committed suicide nearly three times more frequent than nonveteran females of the same age 
group  [54].  Veterans  were  more  likely  to  use  firearms  for  suicide  compared  to  nonveterans,  even  
after  adjusting  for  age,  marital  status,  race  and  region  of  residence;  this  applied  to  both  males  and 
females [55], which changes our general view on the violent death as a typical male phenomenon. 

Thus,  not  PTSD  alone  as  an  important  underlying  disorder  but  also  its  comorbidity  with  other 
psychopathologies  and  physical  health  problems  serve  as  factors  leading  for  suicide.  Besides  the 
proposed  MDD  condition,  there  is  evidence  indicating  that  the  odds  of  completed  suicide  are 
significantly increased in depressed patients with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder [56]. 
Veterans  may  also  have  additional  risk  factors  for  suicide,  mainly  due  to  brain  trauma  and  pain 
syndrome.  Several  publications  testify  that  cognitive,  psychiatric  and  emotional  facets  of  traumatic 
brain  injury  are  risk  factors  of  attempted  and  completed  suicide  [57,58].  Severe  pain  also  predicts 
higher suicide risks, and in those veterans who are living in institutions, pain and physical illness were 
the  most  severe  triggers  [59,60].  It  must  be  also  noted  that  general  health  problems  add  to  previous 
stressful exposures and constitute additional risk factors. 

That  the  level  of  stressful  exposures  determines,  in  many  ways,  future  mental  problems  and 
suicidality among veterans can be seen from data regarding peacekeepers. Recently, with the wide role of 
peacekeeping duties worldwide, several researchers have studied suicide in former peacekeepers [61–64]. 
The peacekeeping soldier is not expected to be engaged in regular war activities, rather acts as a buffer 
between hostile parties. This task is completely different from soldiers who are traditionally trained for 
combat  [3].  This  specific  group  may  suffer  from  serious  tension  and  psycho-emotional  problems  in 
regions  with  different  ethnicity  and  conflicts,  but  they  are  usually  less  exposed  to  combat  stress. 
Although  an  increase  in  suicide  by  firearms  was  reported  in  Norwegian  peacekeepers  [61,62],  a 
Canadian study was unable to confirm a higher risk of suicides in this group [63]. In a Swedish study 
performed on 39,768 former peacekeepers, even a lower number of suicides were found compared to 

 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 

2513 

the general population [64]. Thus, there is no definite conclusion with more evidence of now rise of 
suicides. It is possible to speculate that absence of direct combat exposure makes this group different.  
Discussion regarding mechanisms of suicide among war veterans is not limited to psychobiological 
aspects. It should be noted that a valuable insight into more subtle psychological mechanisms of the 
problem was presented within the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide [22], which is based 
on  an  earlier  Suicidal  Mode  discourse  [65].  This  concept  is  putting  forward  three  important  factors, 
which  may  lead  to  suicide:  (1)  feelings  that  one  does  not  belong  with  other  people  (thwarted 
belongingness); (2) feelings that one is a burden on others or society (perceived burdensomeness); and 
(3) an acquired capability to overcome the fear and pain associated with suicide (acquired capability of 
lethal  self-injury)  [22].  Within  the  frame  of  this  theory  many  psycho-social  aspects  concerning 
discharge from the armed forces (i.e., loosing relations with comrades, problems during the transition 
period, and feeling excluded from civilian life) are relevant. Stressful experiences of being in the war 
zone,  together  with  elements  of  extensive  training  are  also  important  underpinnings  of  suicide  risks. 
During  military  missions,  solders  may  develop  certain  aggressive  and  impulsive  behavioural 
automatisms in order to deal with the stressful environments. Combat training and military exposures 
may cause habituation to fear of painful experiences, including suicide [22]. This evidence adds to the 
better  understanding  of  veterans’  suicide.  Veterans  who  commit  suicide  are  a  heterogeneous  group, 
wherein they are differentially exposed  to social, psychological or psychopathological risks. Combat 
stress and direct experiences of war may be the unifying factor though this factor is valid only for the 
part of the released military. On the other hand this particular exposure may be the main contributing 
risk factor that influences suicide rates in a more general contingent. This again emphasises that stress 
is  potentially  the  main  mechanism  exacerbating  existing  vulnerabilities  and  may  serve  as  the  main 
component for inducing suicide.  

Discussion  on  suicide  prevention  measures  among  veterans,  its  implementation  and  effectiveness 
may be a theme for a specific review. Quite recently, such systematic reviews have covered practically 
all aspects of this subject, which makes our task much easier [66]. Suicide prevention measures in war 
veterans  vary  from  systemic  policy  on  the  governmental  level  [8,67]  to  more  local  initiatives  [68]. 
Recently, several publications have discussed priorities and main strategies within this field [67,69]. In 
many cases, the so-called “gatekeepers’ training” strategy is promoted [69,70]. This same strategy was 
utilized in the management of suicidal crisis in a large military unit in the Ukraine, during the period of 
severe  economic  problems  and  downsizing  [71];  results  revealed  promising  outcomes.  In  USA,  the 
system  of  prevention  is  mostly  developed  within  veterans’  health  facilities;  the  main  strategies  are 
based  on  screening  for  mental  health  problems,  identifying  appropriate  treatment,  and  hotlines  and 
awareness training for staff and families [67–71]. The above mentioned systematic review on suicide 
prevention  programs  both  for  military  and  veterans  reports  that  there  are  insufficient  data,  thus, 
concrete conclusions regarding the effectiveness of these programs are ambiguous [66]. Of course, this 
should not discourage those who are involved in these activities, as the effectiveness of these programs 
cannot be definitively measured. Thus, each saved life is a valuable achievement.

4. Conclusions 

This review attempts to understand why suicide is becoming more noticeable among war veterans. 
Returning back to the questions formulated in the beginning of this paper, we can conclude that war 
veterans  definitely  have  specific  social  and  environmental  factors  that  may  increase  their  risks  for 
suicidality. On the other hand, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion regarding higher suicide 
rates among veterans when compared with the general population. This group is very heterogeneous. 
Veterans of different age groups and involved in different conflicts may vary in risk, thus, appropriate 
comparisons  is  essential.  It  is  not  always  feasible  so  far  as  studies  on  veterans’  suicides  are  using 
different access methods, cover different time periods and the level of war exposure cannot be easily 
identified within studied cohorts. On the other hand those who were involved in latter conflicts, as in 
Iraq, are definitely at higher risk [11,34,72]. Even with the “healthy soldier effect”, good mental and 
physical health is not always protective from adverse effects of war exposures and subsequent deaths 
from  suicides  [73].  This  may  be  well  understood  within  the  stress-vulnerability  model,  which 
integrates  biological  and  psychosocial  factors.  It  also  explicates  the  interaction  of  different  kinds  of 
stress as a pathway to suicidal behavior. On the other hand, many aspects of this phenomenon may lie 
in deep psychological and existential problems of those who were involved in the wars that USA and 
other countries are leading abroad. The problem of the wish to die cannot be understood only in terms 
of  traditional  risk  factors.  Those  returning  from  war  may  also  experience  changes  in  identity  and 
alienation from civilian life [74]. Complex interpersonal problems and acquired capability to overcome 
fear of extreme pain may contribute to suicidal tendencies in war veterans as well [22,75].  

In spite of discrepancies between different studies, the general conclusion is very likely to confirm 
that  war  veterans  have  many  mental  health  problems  [5,6,52,72,76]  and  suicide  is  the  clearest  one 
among them. Many studies concentrate on PTSD as an underlying disorder, nevertheless some authors 
point that PTSD has a pronounced effect on suicide risk especially in comorbidity with depression. On 
the  other  hand  psychiatric  disorders  (though  being  important  predictors  of  suicide)  are  not  able  to 
explain  all  suicides  in  veterans.  It  should  be  taken  into  consideration  suicide  is  often  a  pathway  for 
alleviating pain and suffering which may be independent from diagnoses. It is not even so important if 
suicide  rates  in  veterans  are  slightly  higher  or  lower  than  in  the  general  population.  It  is  more 
important  to  consider  the  moral  responsibility  of  society  towards  those  who  are  facing  numerous 
psychological  and  health  problems  after  serving  the  military  [77].  It  is  also  a  very  vivid  example  of 
how stressful environmental exposures can reveal hidden vulnerabilities, thus, producing mental health 
problems. Moreover, aggressive and impulsive components of the training usually applied to modern 
combatants may lead to negative consequences in civilian life after discharge. There is no doubt that 
many interdisciplinary studies are needed to better understand stress vulnerability and resilience in war 
veterans, including genetic/epigenetic, psychological, cognitive, social and spiritual factors.  

For development of preventive measures, we rely on known approaches in suicide prevention. The 
universal/selective/indicated model [78] seems to be the most relevant. In general terms, the universal 
prevention  is  aimed  at  the  general  population  (i.e.,  those  enrolled  in  the  armed  forces  in  our  case), 
selective is aimed at those who have an elevated risk (e.g., combat veterans) and indicated, which is 
aimed  at  addressing  the  symptoms  (i.e.,  those  who  have  developed  PTSD  or  mood  disorders, 
experienced  brain  trauma,  have  been  wounded  causing  residual  pain  syndrome,  or  appeared  in  a 

 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 

2515 

situation  of  crisis,  alienation  and/or  exclusion).  From  this  point  of  view,  suicide  prevention  in  war 
veterans should focus on (1) better screening at admission to the Army (e.g., early life events should 
be  addressed  more  seriously,  and  possibly  in  future  genetic  variables  should  also  be  taken  into 
consideration); (2) development of better strategies of psychological training (e.g., stress-inoculation) 
and  support;  (3)  implementation  of  veterans’  status  strategies  that  are  based  on  improvement  in 
recognition  of  mental  health  problems  and  better  treatment  of  comorbid  psychiatric  conditions;  
(4)  better  control  of  physical  health,  rehabilitation  from  trauma  and  pain  management;  (5)  better 
identification  of  suicidal tendencies; and (6) social and family support, social inclusion,  measures to 
overcome thwarted belongingness and to decrease one's sense of burdensomeness, as well as possible 
counterbalancing  acquired  capability.  Many  parts  of  these  strategies  are  already  being  implemented, 
however, have not been thoroughly evaluated. A combination of state-of-the-art research concerning 
developmental trajectory and stress-vulnerability acquirement via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms 
are also needed.
