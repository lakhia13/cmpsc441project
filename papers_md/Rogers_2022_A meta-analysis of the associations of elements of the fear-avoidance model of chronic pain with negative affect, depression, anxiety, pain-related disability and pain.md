Abstract
Background and objective: Biopsychosocial conceptualizations of clinical pain 
conditions  recognize  the  multi- faceted  nature  of  pain  experience  and  its  inter-

section  with  mental  health.  A  primary  cognitive- behavioural  framework  is  the 

Fear- Avoidance Model, which posits that pain catastrophizing and fear of pain 

(including  avoidance,  cognitions  and  physiological  reactivity)  are  key  anteced-

ents to, and drivers of, pain intensity and disability, in addition to pain- related 

psychological  distress.  This  study  aimed  to  provide  a  comprehensive  analysis 

of  the  magnitude  of  the  cross- sectional  association  between  the  primary  com-

ponents  of  the  Fear- Avoidance  Model  (pain  catastrophizing,  fear  of  pain,  pain 

vigilance) with negative affect, anxiety, depression, pain intensity and disabilities 

in studies of clinical pain.
Databases and data treatment: A search of MEDLINE and PubMed databases 
resulted in 335 studies that were evaluated in this meta- analytic review, which 

represented 65,340 participants.
Results: Results from the random effect models indicated a positive, medium-  to 
large- sized association between fear of pain, pain catastrophizing, and pain vigi-

lance measures and outcomes (pain- related negative affect, anxiety, depression 

and pain- related disability) and medium- sized associations with pain intensity. 

Fear of pain measurement type was a significant moderator of effects across all 

outcomes.
Conclusions: These findings provide empirical support, aligned with the com-
ponents of the fear- avoidance (FA) model, for the relevance of both pain catastro-

phizing and fear of pain to the pain experience and its intersection with mental 

health.  Implications  for  the  conceptualization  of  the  pain  catastrophizing  and 

fear of pain construct and its measurement are discussed.
Significance:  This  meta- analysis  reveals  that,  among  individuals  with  vari-
ous pain conditions, pain catastrophizing, fear of pain, and pain vigilance have

pression, pain intensity and disability. Differences in the strength of the associa-

tions depend on the type of self- report tool used to assess fear of pain.

|  INTRODU CT ION

Pain  is  a  clinically  significant  problem  that  affects  ap-
proximately  20%  of  the  world's  population  (Goldberg  & 
McGee,  2011;  Mills  et  al.,  2019;  Yong  et  al.,  2022),  and 
chronic  pain,  or  experiencing  pain  for  at  least  3 months, 
affects approximately half of those with pain (upwards of 
10% of people across the world; Jackson et al., 2014), Pain 
experience is associated with significant medical expendi-
tures, physical and mental health problems and disability. 
Additionally, pain, in general, has been linked to the onset 
and  maintenance  of  the  opioid  epidemic  (Ballantyne 
&  Shin,  2008;  Manchikanti  et  al.,  2012),  suggesting  that 
the  deleterious  outcomes  associated  with  chronic  pain 
are  far- reaching.  Both  pharmacological  and  psychologi-
cal treatment strategies are used to manage pain, but all 
with mixed long- term efficacy (Vlaeyen & Morley, 2005). 
It  is  well- documented  that  psychological  processes  con-
tribute to the maintenance of pain, its intensity and dis-
ability,  thus  may  undermine  treatment  efficacy  (Darnall 
et al., 2017; Goesling et al., 2018; Uebelacker et al., 2015; 
Vinall et al., 2016).

The  most  prominent  psychological  model  of  pain 
experience  is  the  fear- avoidance  (FA)  model  of  pain 
(Asmundson et al., 1999; Vlaeyen & Linton, 2000; Vlaeyen 
&  Linton,  2012),  with  a  revision  of  the  model  positing 
that, in the context of pain, pain catastrophizing, fear of 
pain, comprised of avoidance, negative cognitions, physi-
ological arousal, pain vigilance/hypervigilance (attention 
toward pain) contribute to emotional distress and subse-
quently amplify the subjective intensity of the pain expe-
rience (Norton & Asmundson, 2003). The components of 
pain- related  fear  can  in  turn  lead  to  disability,  and  sub-
sequently, perpetuate the cycle of pain. Pain- related fear 
has  been  studied  extensively  in  terms  of  various  func-
tional  outcomes,  primarily  pain- related  disability  and 
pain  intensity.  Indeed,  in  a  meta- analysis  of  41  studies, 
Zale et al. (2013) found a moderate to large- sized positive 
correlation between fear of pain and pain- related disabil-
ity,  and  this  association  was  stable  across  demographic 
characteristics,  including  gender,  age  and  variations  in 
pain  intensity.  In  another  meta- analysis  of  253  studies, 
Markfelder  and  Pauli  (2020)  found  a  small  to  moderate 
positive correlation between fear of pain and pain inten-
sity;  here,  the  patterning  of  association  remained  con-
sistent  across  measures  of  fear  of  pain,  but  differed  as  a 
function of several demographic characteristics, including 

age,  location  of  pain,  first- time  pain  episode,  treatment 
status for pain and anxiety sensitivity.

Less work has taken a meta- analytic approach to exam-
ine pain catastrophizing as it relates to functional outcomes 
amongst pain patients. Of the existing work, one combin-
ing both pain catastrophizing and pain anxiety found that 
both  constructs  are  associated  with  a  higher  likelihood  of 
post- operative  pain  in  adult  surgery  patients  (Theunissen 
et al., 2012). Another meta- analytic study found that reduc-
tions  in  pain  catastrophizing  across  treatment  modalities 
resulted  in  clinical  improvements  for  adults  with  chronic 
non- cancer pain (Schütze et al., 2018). Further meta- analytic 
work  amongst  adults  with  chronic  pelvic  pain  found  ele-
vated rates of pain catastrophizing (Huang et al., 2020), and 
a  meta- analysis  of  paediatric  chronic  pain  patients  found 
that  pain  catastrophizing  was  moderately  associated  with 
pain outcomes, but strongly associated with mental health 
and functional outcomes (Miller et al., 2018). Yet, there re-
mains a lack of literature specifically focused on these rela-
tions amongst adults with chronic pain, as well as across the 
range of pain and clinical outcomes.

Further,  no  meta- analytic  work  has  examined  the  re-
lationship  between  pain  vigilance/hypervigilance  with 
negative affect, anxiety, depression, pain severity or pain- 
related disability. This limitation is important, as there is 
a  growing  body  of  literature  that  highlights  the  impor-
tance  of  pain  vigilance  in  terms  of  functional  outcomes 
(Crombez  et  al.,  2005;  Roelofs  et  al.,  2003).  Specifically, 
attention  to  pain,  or  pain  vigilance,  has  been  associated 
with pain- related disability (McCracken, 1997), and more 
recent  mechanistic  research  suggests  that  pain  vigilance 
may, in fact, depend on pain- related fear and catastrophic 
thinking  (Goubert  et  al.,  2004).  Yet,  it  remains  to  be  ex-
amined if pain vigilance represents a unique construction 
with unique associations with negative affect, anxiety, de-
pression, pain severity and pain- related disability.

Despite the abovementioned meta- analytic evidence, 
there are several areas to bolster and extend this work. 
First,  the  emotional  sequelae  of  pain  catastrophizing, 
pain- related  fear  and  pain  vigilance  have  not  been  ex-
plored in the existing meta- analytic studies. Emotional 
distress  (e.g.  stress,  anxiety,  depression)  is  often  ob-
served amongst people with pain generally, and chronic 
pain specifically (Tsang et al., 2008; Woo,  2010), and is 
implicated  in  various  aspects  of  pain  recovery  (Tripp 
et al., 2011). Heightened emotional distress is associated 
with  more  severe  pain  intensity  (Gaskin  et  al.,  1992; 
Wiech & Tracey, 2009; Wong et al., 2015) and can lead to 

ROGERS and FARRIS 
 
more severe and debilitating pain (Linton & Shaw, 2011; 
Lumley et al., 2011). Additionally, mental health symp-
toms,  focusing  on  anxiety  and  depression,  have  been 
strongly  associated  with  opioid  misuse  and  use  disor-
der  amongst  individuals  with  chronic  pain  (Fischer 
et  al.,  2012;  Gatchel,  2004),  and  given  that  the  rates  of 
opioid- related  problems  and  functional  impairment 
are  elevated  amongst  those  with  pain,  it  is  critical  to 
understand  the  anxiety  and  depression  as  clinical  out-
comes.  Moreover,  pain- related  negative  affect,  a  core 
cognitive/emotional  process  of  pain- related  fear  in  the 
Fear- Avoidance  Model,  may  be  bi- directionally  related 
to  fear  of  pain:  that  is,  it  may  be  a  precipitant  to  pain- 
related  fear  (Crombez  et  al.,  1999;  Wong  et  al.,  2015) 
and  it  is  also  possible  that  pain- related  negative  affect 
responses (e.g. anger, shame, helplessness) may be sec-
ondary  emotions  to  the  experience  of  fear  (Rodríguez- 
Torres  et  al.,  2005).  Despite  its  relevance,  there  have 
been no estimates of the effect size across studies on the 
association between pain catastrophizing, as well as fear 
of pain and these mental health outcomes. Second, re-
search on both pain catastrophizing and “fear of pain” 
has been limited by significant heterogeneity in its con-
ceptualization, definition, and in turn, its measurement 
(see  comprehensive  review  by  Lundberg  et  al.,  2011). 
The variability introduced by the use of various different 
assessment tools has not yet been systematically exam-
ined as a moderating variable in meta- analytic studies. 
Third,  limited  research  suggests  differential  associated 
with  fear  of  pain  across  treatment  settings  (Esteve  & 
Ramírez- Maestre, 2013), and, given the differences that 
were  found  replicating  and  extending  these  results  to 
pain  catastrophizing  is  clinically  important.  Finally, 
pain  symptom  presents  across  various  conditions,  and 
thus may be a primary medical complaint, or may be the 
consequence  of  another  condition,  including  cancer. 
Therefore,  considering  the  report  of  pain  as  a  primary 
or  secondary  concern  may  then  affect  the  relationship 
between fear of pain and pain outcomes.

Thus, the current study aims to provide an updated 
meta- analysis  that  both  replicates  and  extends  past 
work  by  examining  the  associations  between  pain  cat-
astrophizing,  fear  of  pain,  and  pain  vigilance  with  key 
theoretically- relevant  outcomes  based  on  past  work 
(Ocañez  et  al.,  2010),  including:  pain  intensity,  pain- 
related  disability,  pain- related  negative  affect,  anxiety 
and  depression.  The  considerable  variability  observed 
across studies suggests the presence of moderating fac-
tors,  including  the  type  of  pain  and  measurement  tool 
used,  but  little  is  known  about  how  these  factors  may 
influence  observed  relations.  Therefore,  the  main  goal 
of the current study is to estimate the magnitude of as-
sociation  between  pain  catastrophizing,  fear  of  pain,

pain vigilance and pain- related negative affect, anxiety, 
depression,  pain  intensity  and  pain- related  disability, 
across  samples  with  pain  after  correcting  for  sampling 
error  and  examining  potential  moderating  factors  of 
these associations.

studies conducted with human participants and published 
in the English language.

Studies were included if they met the following crite-
ria: (a) a sample of adults (18+), (b) a clinical sample of 
patients  experiencing  pain,  (c)  inclusion  of  at  least  one 
pain  catastrophizing  or  fear  of  pain  measure  (described 
below;  including  fear,  avoidance,  or  negative  alterations 
in  cognition)  and  (d)  report  a  direct  correlation  of  pain 
catastrophizing  or  fear  of  pain  with  at  least  one  clinical 
outcome measure.

2.1.1 
pain vigilance/hypervigilance measures

Pain  catastrophizing,  fear  of  pain  and  pain  vigilance/
hypervigilance  are  typically  measured  via  self- report 
instruments  assessing  a  range  of  constructs,  including 
fear of pain, fear of movement, pain- related anxiety and 
fear  of  activities,  amongst  others  (Zale  et  al.,  2013).  A 
previous  review  of  fear  of  pain  measures  (Lundberg 
et  al.,  2011)  suggested  including  at  least  the  follow-
ing  measures:  Fear- Avoidance  Beliefs  Questionnaire

(FABQ),  Fear- Avoidance  of  Pain  Scale  (FAPS),  Fear 
of  Pain  Questionnaire  (FPQ),  Pain  Anxiety  Symptoms 
Scale  (PASS)  and  the  Tampa  Scale  for  Kinesiophobia 
(TSK).  Similarly,  pain  catastrophizing  is  most  com-
monly  assessed  using  the  Pain  Catastrophizing  Scale 
(Sullivan  et  al.,  1995)  and  pain  vigilance  is  most  com-
monly  assessed  using  the  Pain  Vigilance  Awareness 
Questionnaire (Roelofs et al., 2003). However, based on 
the lack of clear evidence for the psychometric properties 
or  construct  validity  of  each  of  these  measures  as  well 
as  potential  additional  measures  that  assess  these  con-
structs, the current meta- analysis included several addi-
tional measures, identified a priori by the authors, that 
tap both pain catastrophizing and fear of pain (detailed 
in results below). Additional measures were considered 
during the article screening process and decisions for in-
clusion were determined by author consensus.

2.1.2 

|  Outcome variables

Our key outcomes of interest were modelled on previous 
meta- analytic  reviews  that  have  examined  the  relation-
ship  between  psychological  determinates  of  pain  (fear 
of  pain,  anxiety  sensitivity)  (Markfelder  &  Pauli,  2020; 
Ocañez et al., 2010; Zale et al., 2013). Outcome measures 
were organized as follows: pain- related negative affect (e.g. 
Multidimensional  Pain  Inventory  [MPI]:  Negative  affect 
subscale),  anxiety  symptom  severity  (e.g.  Beck  Anxiety 
Inventory  [BAI],  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder- 7  [GAD- 
7]),  depressive  symptom  severity  (e.g.  Patient  Health 
Questionnaire  [PHQ- 9],  Beck  Depression  Inventory 
[BDI]), pain severity (e.g. MPI: pain severity subscale), and 
pain- related disability (e.g. MPI: interference subscale).

2.1.3 

|  Study selection

See Figure 1 for the number of studies identified and ex-
cluded at each stage of screening. A total of 3576 unique 
articles were extracted from the search criteria. An initial 
screening of article titles and abstracts was conducted by 
two independent reviewers. A third independent reviewer 
screened any article abstracts in which the initial screen-
ing  determination  was  unclear  or  in  conflict  (19.3%  of 
screened  articles).  A  total  of  912  studies  were  identified 
as possibly relevant, and a subsequent review of the full 
text of each article was completed by two independent re-
viewers to determine eligibility. When the two reviewers 
did not agree on study inclusion (n = 58 articles, 6.3%), a 
third independent reviewer coded the study and resolved 
the discrepancy. A total of 335 studies were identified that 
met all inclusion criteria.

2.1.4 

|  Data extraction and synthesis

Data abstraction was conducted by a single coder and then 
double- checked  for  accuracy  by  a  second  coder.  For  each 
study,  sample  size,  sample  type,  study  setting  (pain/reha-
bilitation clinic, primary care clinic or other clinic/research 
setting)  and  correlations  (r)  between  pain  catastrophizing 
or fear of pain and outcomes were recorded. For studies that 
reported multiple samples (control and pain), the study was 
included if the correlation for the pain- only group was spe-
cifically reported. When studies reported total scores as well 
as subscale scores, only the total score was used, as the sub-
scale scores are related to the broader construct. When the 
measure included only one subscale of interest (i.e. CSQ— 
Catastrophizing  Subscale),  this  specific  effect  size  was  ex-
tracted, and the total score was not used.

Analyses were conducted in R using the metacor pack-
age  (Laliberté,  2019)  to  calculate  the  pooled  effect  size 
estimates  for  each  of  the  relationship  between  the  pain 
catastrophizing  or  fear  of  pain  measure  and  outcomes 
(pain  intensity,  pain- related  disability,  pain- related  neg-
ative affect, anxiety and depression). To address assump-
tions  of  independence  of  each  study,  one  correlation 
between pain catastrophizing or fear of pain and the out-
come was included in each study for the pooled analyses. 
When  the  study  reported  multiple  correlations  between 
measures (e.g. one study with correlations between PASS 
and anxiety and TSK and anxiety), the average study cor-
relation was calculated (Zale et al., 2013). For moderator 
analyses by measure (outlines below) the effect sizes were 
disaggregated to compare effect sizes across instruments. 
Additionally,  to  eliminate  duplicate  study  effects  from 
multiple papers published from the same dataset, studies 
were  screened  according  to  published  recommendations 
(‘Andy’ Wood, 2008), including examining the same first 
author and corresponding author, sample size, study year, 
fear of pain measure and others. Studies that were identi-
fied as being from the same sample were averaged together 
to provide one effect size estimate per sample.

For the meta- analysis, first, a random- effects model, using 
the  Sidik- Johnkman  estimator  for  between- study  heteroge-
neity, was used to estimate the pooled effect size for the rela-
tionship between fear of pain and each outcome. To test the 
homogeneity  assumption  for  meta- analyses,  I2  and  τ2  were 
examined.  Based  on  past  research  I2  can  be  quantified  as 
low (25%), moderate (50%) and high (75%) levels of hetero-
geneity (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). To examine the effect 
of  potential  moderators  on  study  heterogeneity,  two  types 
of moderator analyses were conducted. First, for categorical 
moderators, sub- group analyses allowed for individual pooled 
random- effects  correlations  for  each  group  studied,  as  well 
as a statistical test of between- study variability (Borenstein & 
Higgins, 2013). For continuous moderators, a meta- regression

analysis was conducted (Higgins & Thompson, 2004). Given 
the  significant  variability  in  the  number  of  studies  that  in-
cluded each moderator variable, not all studies were included 
in  each  moderator  analysis.  Past  research  indicates  that  at 
least two studies must be present to conduct a meta- analysis 
(Valentine et al., 2010), but given the random- effects nature 
of the analysis as well as the significance observed within and 
between- study  heterogeneity,  we  used  the  threshold  of  five 
studies (Jackson & Turner, 2017).

To investigate the presence of small study publication 
bias,  we  used  the  funnel  plot  and  contoured  funnel  plot 
for a visual inspection of study bias (Peters et al., 2008), 
and  Egger's  regression  test  for  a  statistical  test  of  small 
study  bias  (Egger  et  al.,  1997).  When  Egger's  test  is  sig-
nificant,  suggesting  the  presence  of  small  study  publi-
cation  bias,  we  employed  Duval  and Tweedie's  trim  and 
fill procedure (Duval & Tweedie, 2000), which calculates 
how  many  studies  are  missing,  and  imputes  effect  sizes 
from the missing studies and estimates what the effect size 
would have been if the missing studies had been included.

not statistically powered. Differences by measure type were 
not examined due to the lack of heterogeneity.

3.1.2 

|  Anxiety

A total of 74 studies (50 aggregated effect sizes) were included, 
accounting for n = 9470 participants. Random- effects meta- 
analyses  estimated  the  pooled  correlation  of  0.50  (95%  CI 
[0.46, 0.54]) for the relationship between pain catastrophizing 
and  anxiety,  with  high  heterogeneity  estimates  (I2  = 80.3%, 
2 = 0.03, p < 0.001). Egger's test for funnel plot asymmetry as 
τ
well as an examination of the contoured funnel plot indicate 
no small study bias (z = −0.24, p = 0.76).

3.1.3 

|  Depression

A  total  of  139  studies  (87  aggregated  effect  sizes)  exam-
ined  the  relationship  between  pain  catastrophizing  and 
depression,  totalling  n  =  17,623  participants.  Random- 
effect  meta- analyses  estimated  the  pooled  correlation  to 
be 0.51 (95% CI [0.48, 0.54]), with high heterogeneity es-
timates (I2 = 79.4%, τ
2 = 0.03, p < 0.001). Egger's test for 
funnel plot asymmetry as well as examination of the con-
toured funnel plot indicate no small study bias (z = −0.55, 
p = 0.32).

3.1.4 

|  Pain intensity

A  total  of  308  studies  (152  aggregated  effect  sizes)  were 
included,  totalling  a  sample  size  of  n  =  28,875  individu-
als.  Random- effects  meta- analysis  indicated  a  pooled 
correlation  of  0.38  (95%  CI  [0.35,  0.31]).  Heterogeneity 
estimates  for  the  study  were  high  (I2  = 83.7%, τ
2  = 0.03), 
with  significance  tests  suggesting  significant  heterogene-
ity (p < 0.001). Examination of the contoured funnel plot 
and  Egger's  test  for  funnel  plot  asymmetry  revealed  evi-
dence for small study bias (z = 1.82, p < 0.001). The trim 
and  fill  procedure  indicated  that  49  studies  would  need 
to be imputed to the left of the mean, corresponding to a 
weaker correlation between pain catastrophizing and pain 
intensity, to eliminate small study bias. Following the im-
putation  procedure,  the  corrected  pooled  random  effects 
correlation for pain catastrophizing and pain intensity is 
0.29 (95% CI [0.25, 0.32]).

3.1.5

A  total  of  114  studies  (62  aggregated  effect  sizes)  exam-
ined  the  relationship  between  fear  of  pain  and  depres-
sion,  totalling  n  =  12,124  participants.  Random- effect 
meta- analyses estimated the pooled correlation to be 0.41 
(95%  CI  [0.37,  0.44]),  with  high  heterogeneity  estimates 
(I2 = 67.1%, τ
2 = 0.02, p < 0.001). Egger's test for funnel plot 
asymmetry as well as examination of the contoured fun-
nel plot indicate no small study bias (z = 0.97, p = 0.05).

3.2.4 

|  Pain intensity

A  total  of  245  studies  (113  aggregated  effect  sizes)  were 
included, totalling a sample size of n = 20,028 individuals. 
Random- effects meta- analysis indicated a pooled correla-
tion of 0.27 (95% CI [0.24, 0.30]). Heterogeneity estimates 
for  the  study  were  high  (I2  = 78.1%,  τ
2  = 0.02),  with  sig-
nificance 
tests  suggesting  significant  heterogeneity 
(p < 0.001). Examination of the contoured funnel plot and 
Egger's test for funnel plot asymmetry revealed evidence 
for small study bias (z = 1.03, p = 0.03), and the trim and 
fill procedure suggests the addition of 37 studies to reduce 
bias, with an updated effect size of 0.19.

3.2.5 

|  Pain- related disability

A  total  of  185  studies  (88  aggregated  effect  sizes)  were 
included in the meta- analysis, accounting for n = 18,787 
individuals.  Random- effects  meta- analyses  indicated  a 
pooled correlation of 0.39 (95% CI [0.35, 0.42]), with high 
heterogeneity estimates (I2 = 76.5%, τ
2 = 0.02, p < 0.001). 
Egger's  test  for  funnel  plot  asymmetry  (z  = −0.28, 
p = 0.59), as well as examination of the contoured funnel 
plot suggests no small study bias, and thus no studies need 
to be imputed to calculate the effect size.

|  Pain vigilance/hypervigilance

3.3.1 

|  Pain- related negative affect

No studies examined the relationship between pain vigi-
lance/hypervigilance and pain- related negative affect.

tween pain vigilance and anxiety, with low heterogeneity 
estimates  (I2  = 0.0%,  τ
2  = 0.0002,  p  =  0.78).  However, 
given  the  small  number  of  studies  (k < 10)  included  in 
this analysis, small study bias tests were not statistically 
powered.

3.3.3 

|  Depression

A  total  of  nine  studies  (4  aggregated  effect  sizes)  exam-
ined  the  relationship  between  pain  vigilance  and  de-
pression,  totaling  n  =  930  participants.  Random- effect 
meta- analyses estimated the pooled correlation to be 0.28 
(95%  CI  [0.08,  0.47]),  with  high  heterogeneity  estimates 
(I2 = 89.9%, τ
2 = 0.05, p < 0.001). However, given the small 
number of studies (k < 10) included in this analysis, small 
study bias tests were not statistically powered.

3.3.4 

|  Pain intensity

A total of 21 studies (15 aggregated effect sizes) were in-

Random- effects  meta- analysis  indicated  a  pooled  cor-
relation  of  0.29  (95%  CI  [0.18,  0.38).  Heterogeneity  esti-
mates for the study were high (I2 = 85.5%, τ
2 = 0.04), with 
significance  tests  suggesting  significant  heterogeneity 
(p < 0.001). Examination of the contoured funnel plot and 
Egger's test for funnel plot asymmetry did not reveal evi-
dence of small study bias (z = 0.77, p = 0.78).

3.3.5 

|  Pain- related disability

A  total  of  13  studies  (9  aggregated  effect  sizes)  were  in-
cluded  in  the  meta- analysis,  accounting  for  n  =  1524 
individuals.  Random- effects  meta- analyses  indicated  a 
pooled correlation of 0.34 (95% CI [0.24, 0.42]), with high 
heterogeneity estimates (I2 = 63.3%, τ
2 = 0.02, p = 0.005). 
However, given the small number of studies (k < 10) in-

3.4.2 

|  Anxiety

Between  measure  differences  existed  in  the  relationship 
between fear of pain and anxiety (Q = 49.00, p < 0.001), 
such  that  the  Fear  of  Pain  questionnaire  showed  the 
weakest  z- corrected  correlation  (r  =  0.15),  and  the  Pain 
Catastrophizing  Scale  showed  the  strongest  z- corrected 
correlation (r = 0.54).

3.4.3 

|  Depression

Significant differences existed in the relationship between 
fear of pain and depression (Q = 49.72, p < 0.001), where 
the Coping Strategies for Pain Questionnaire showed the 
strongest z- corrected correlation (r = 0.62), and the Fear 
of  Pain  Questionnaire  showed  the  weakest  correlation 
(r = 0.22).

3.4.4 

|  Pain intensity

For  pain  intensity,  subgroup  analyses  suggest  signifi-
cant  differences  in  the  effect  size  of  the  relationship  be-
tween fear of pain and pain severity by the measure used 
(Q  =  41.30,  p  < 0.001).  Specifically,  the  Tampa  Scale  for 
Kinesiophobia showed the weakest z- corrected correlation 
with pain severity (r = 0.23), and the Coping Strategies for 
Pain  Questionnaire— Catastrophizing  Subscale  showed 
the  strongest  z- corrected  correlation  with  pain  severity 
(r = 0.40).

3.4.5 

|  Pain- related disability

Group differences were found for pain- related disability 
(Q = 20.99, p < 0.001), such that the Coping Strategies 
for  Pain  Questionnaire  –   Catastrophizing  Subscale 
showed the strongest z- corrected correlation with pain- 
related disability (r = 0.56), and the Pain Vigilance and 
Awareness Questionnaire showed  the weakest correla-
tion (r = 0.35).

3.5.2 

|  Anxiety

There  were  significant  differences  in  the  effect  size  esti-
mates by study setting (Q = 4.95, p < 0.03), such that the 
correlation between fear of pain and anxiety was strong-
est  in  pain  clinics  (r  =  0.57),  and  weakest  for  research 
conducted  in  research- specific  settings  (r  =  0.45).  There 
were no differences in the effect size estimates by country 
where the study was conducted (Q = 5.60, p = 0.06), or by 
study year (b = 0.002, se = 0.004, p = 0.57).).

3.5.3 

|  Depression

There were significant differences in effect size for the re-
lationship  between  fear  of  pain  and  depression  by  study 
setting (research: r = 0.44; primary care: r = 0.42; pain/re-
habilitation: r = 0.53; Q = 11.90, p = 0.003). There were no 
differences in the effect size estimates by country where 
the study was conducted (Q = 1.18, p = 0.76) or by study 
year (b = −0.001, se = 0.003, p = 0.88).

3.5.4 

|  Pain intensity

There  were  no  significant  differences  in  effect  size  by 
country  where  the  study  was  conducted  (Q  =  12.79, 
p  =  0.08),  study  setting  (Q  =  5.45,  p  =  0.07),  nor  study 
year (b = 0.005, se = 0.003, p = 0.07).

3.5.5 

|  Pain- related disability

There were significant differences in effect size by coun-
try where the study was conducted (Q = 17.13, p = 0.02), 
such that the largest effect sizes were found in Australia 
(r = 0.59) and the smallest in Spain (r = 0.37). There were 
no significant differences in effect size by study setting for 
pain- related disability (Q = 5.74, p = 0.07), nor study year 
on the relationship between fear of pain and pain- related 
disability (b = 0.001, se = 0.003, p = 0.79).

|  Additional effect moderators

3.5.1 

|  Pain- related negative affect

There was no significant effect on study year (b = 0.001, 
se = 0.007, p = 0.78), study country, nor study setting were 
examined for pain- related negative affect due to the lack 
of heterogeneity.

|   DISCUSSIO N

The  current  meta- analysis  examined  the  magnitude  of 
the association between pain catastrophizing, fear of pain 
and pain vigilance with pain- related negative affect, anxi-
ety, depression, pain intensity, and pain- related disability. 
Findings from random- effects analyses suggest moderate-
   to  large- pooled  associations  between  pain  catastrophiz-
ing,  fear  of  pain  and  pain  vigilance  with  all  outcomes 

ROGERS and FARRIS 
 
(except pain intensity— small association), with minimal 
small study publication bias observed. Further inspection 
of effect size differences suggests that broadly, pain cata-
strophizing is more strongly associated with all outcomes 
than either fear of pain or pain vigilance. Findings for the 
relationship between fear of pain with pain- related nega-
tive affect, anxiety and depression are novel to the current 
investigation and results from the current study between 
fear  of  pain  and  intensity  and  disability  show  associa-
tion  magnitudes  similar  to  past  research  (Markfelder  & 
Pauli,  2020;  Zale  et  al.,  2013).  Further,  the  findings  that 
the  relationships  between  pain  vigilance  and  outcomes 
suggest  that  either  pain  vigilance  is  not  a  unique  con-
struct, or the relationship regarding pain vigilance is more 
complex, involving potential mediation pathways as sug-
gested  in  the  Fear- Avoidance  Model.  Findings  from  the 
current meta- analysis are in line with the Fear- Avoidance 
Model  of  Chronic  Pain,  suggesting  that  both  pain  cata-
strophizing and fear of pain may be antecedents for pain- 
related  mental  health  complaints  and  disability  and  less 
so for pain intensity, yet the cross- sectional nature of the 
included  studies  temper  the  temporal  precedence  of  the 
findings.  Additionally,  the  findings  also  provide  further 
support  for  the  biopsychosocial  model  of  chronic  pain 
(Covic et al., 2003), by providing additional evidence for 
the  multi- faceted  nature  of  pain  experience  and  its  in-
tersection  with  mental  health.  These  perspectives  are  in 
line  with  intervention  work  suggesting  that  cognitive- 
behavioural  and  acceptance- based  interventions  reduce 
fear of pain and functional impairment, with less of an im-
pact on actual pain intensity (Lynch- Jordan et al., 2014), 
providing  further  evidence  for  the  importance  of  both 
pain catastrophizing and fear of pain (Burns et al., 2015; 
Craner et al., 2016; Riddle et al., 2010).

Whilst  the  current  study  found  effect  size  differences 
between pain catastrophizing, fear of pain  and pain vig-
ilance  with  outcomes,  such  that,  generally,  pain  cata-
strophizing  was  more  strongly  associated  with  clinical 
outcomes,  this  is  an  area  of  study  that  warrants  further 
exploration. A review of the literature suggests that pain 
catastrophizing, fear of pain and pain vigilance are import-
ant to understanding pain and functional outcomes, with 
some research suggesting that fear of pain may, in fact, be 
more important (Andersen et al., 2016; George et al., 2006; 
Hirsh  et  al.,  2008;  Niederstrasser  et  al.,  2015;  Swinkels- 
Meewisse et al., 2006). There is also literature to support 
that the relationship between pain vigilance and pain out-
comes may not be direct, but rather may be mediated by 
pain catastrophizing and fear (Crombez et al., 2004). This 
may be partially explained by the myriad of studies across 
domains  (i.e.  yoga,  CBT,  physical  activity)  that  show  re-
ductions in pain catastrophizing, providing evidence that 
this construct may, in fact, be a non- specific change factor

associated  with  pain  and  function  outcomes  (Ljótsson 
et  al.,  2013).  Yet,  consistently,  pain  catastrophizing,  fear 
of pain and pain vigilance are equally (and not strongly) 
associated  with  pain  severity,  highlighting  the  relative 
importance of functional and mental health outcomes in 
understanding pain experience. Further research to high-
light effect size and thus clinical differences in pain cata-
strophizing vs. fear of pain is warranted.

Measure moderator analyses suggest differences in the 
magnitude  of  the  association  between  pain  catastroph-
izing and fear of pain with the outcome by the measure 
used. Across all outcomes, pain catastrophizing outcomes 
showed stronger associations than fear of pain outcomes. 
Within  the  pain  catastrophizing  construct,  there  were 
slight  differences  in  magnitude  between  the  Coping 
Strategies  Questionnaire— Catastrophizing  Subscale  and 
the  Pain  Catastrophizing  Scale  (PCS),  but  overall,  these 
measures  were  most  strongly  associated  with  all  out-
comes.  Additionally,  an  inspection  of  the  effect  sizes  of 
both of these measures shows similar magnitude suggest-
ing they may tap into the same construct. In terms of fear 
of  pain,  however,  even  greater  differences  in  magnitude 
existed  between  measures  and  outcomes.  For  instance, 
for  anxiety  and  depression  outcomes,  the  Fear  of  Pain 
Questionnaire (FPQ) showed the smallest association. For 
pain intensity, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia showed 
the  smallest  association,  and  for  pain- related  disability, 
the  Pain  Vigilance  and  Awareness  Questionnaire.  These 
results are important to highlight because it suggests that 
for pain catastrophizing, there may be greater consistency 
in  the  definition  and  measure  of  the  construct  than  for 
fear of pain, where there may not be strong construct va-
lidity across the measures included in this meta- analysis. 
Given this, there are a number of plausible explanations 
that require future research. First, it is possible that fear 
of  pain  may  be,  in  fact,  a  multi- faceted  construct  that  is 
comprised of fear, anxiety, and worry in response to pain 
as well as difficulty coping with these experiences. Future 
factor- analytic  work,  incorporating  all  fear  of  pain  mea-
sures,  may  help  answer  this  question.  Second,  it  is  also 
possible that some of the measures included in the meta- 
analysis measure the latent fear of pain construct whilst 
other measures are similar, yet distinct constructs. Future 
research  examining  the  validity  of  these  measures  (and 
their  correlations  with  one  another)  will  be  important, 
and interpreting findings with these measures with cau-
tion is important.

Additionally,  whilst  pain  catastrophizing  and  fear  of 
pain are similar constructs it appears there are some fun-
damental differences in the types of questions included in 
each measure which translates to differential associations 
with outcomes. For instance, the FPQ asks individuals to 
rate how fearful they are of experiencing pain related to a

number of different circumstances (McNeil et al., 2018), 
whilst the PCS assesses fear and anxiety responses to the 
existing  experience  of  pain  (McWilliams  et  al.,  2015). 
Whilst both of these questionnaires assess fear constructs 
as  they  relate  to  pain,  there  may  be  fundamental  differ-
ences in the actually measured latent construct. Given the 
lack of consistency observed across studies in the measures 
used, it will be important to conduct future factor analytic 
and measurement invariance work on a wide range of fear 
of pain measures. The findings from the current study also 
provide evidence for the correlation between fear of pain 
and  outcomes,  and  clinically  and  in  research  settings,  it 
may be important to utilize a measure that appears to cap-
ture associations as close to the correlation as possible to 
eliminate bias. However, this is purely speculative and fu-
ture research is needed.

Additional differences emerged as a function of other 
moderators,  including  study  setting  and  study  country. 
Interestingly,  across  the  board,  the  relationship  between 
fear of pain and outcomes was largest in pain clinics and 
smallest  in  primary  care  clinics.  First,  this  potentially 
speaks to the types of patients that present to each clinic 
and  subsequent study,  suggesting that those that go to a 
pain clinic are generally more severe in their presentations 
of pain and associated conditions. Because of the more se-
vere pain presentations, fear of pain may be a more salient 
vulnerability factor for the onset, maintenance, and exac-
erbation of pain. However, further research is needed to 
understand the extent to which fear of pain is a ubiquitous 
vulnerability factor, or specific to certain populations.

In general, the results from the current study confirm 
and extend past findings, and have important clinical impli-
cations. Previous research examining cognitive- behaviour 
therapy, graded pain exposure, and acceptance and com-
mitment therapy for the treatment of chronic pain found 
that reductions in pain catastrophizing, fear of pain and 
fear  of  movement  drove  treatment  and  quality  of  life 
improvements  (Bailey  et  al.,  2010;  Darnall  et  al.,  2014; 
Schemer et al., 2019) and decreased pain- related disability. 
Further  work  suggests  that  reductions  in  pain  vigilance 
following reductions in pain- related fear and catastroph-
izing,  and  was  associated  with  increased  physical  activ-
ity at 1- year follow- up (Vlaeyen et al., 2002). The current 
study suggests that pain catastrophizing, fear of pain and 
pain  vigilance  may  also  be  driving  pain- related  negative 
affect and associated mental health concerns and that re-
ductions in fear of pain may also improve mental health in 
pain patients. Whilst this is currently speculative, focusing 
and  improving  our  interventions  that  target  fear  of  pain 
constructs may be increasingly efficacious and effective.

The  current  study  is  not  without  limitations.  First, 
our  meta- analysis  focused  on  cross- sectional  relations 

between  pain  catastrophizing,  fear  of  pain  and  pain 
vigilance with negative affect, anxiety, depression, pain 
severity and pain- related disability, limiting conclusions 
that can be made regarding both constructs as a target 
for  change  to  improve  pain  outcomes.  This  limitation 
is  also  in  line  with  the  observed  effect  size  differences 
for pain catastrophizing, fear of pain and pain vigilance 
with outcomes, as it would be important to further un-
derstand if and how these differences may be clinically 
important for treatment and other functional outcomes. 
Second, given the heterogeneity of studies included due 
to  outcomes  selected,  pain  characteristics  were  not  in-
cluded as moderators of associations. Whilst past work 
suggests that these characteristics did not moderate fear 
of pain- disability associations (Zale et al., 2013), it would 
have  been  important  to  replicate  and  extend  past  find-
ings. Third,  given  the  small  number  of  studies  looking 
at fear of pain- pain- related negative affect relations, we 
were not able to examine moderator analyses of these re-
lations. Relatedly, there was significant heterogeneity in 
the moderator variables (i.e. country) for the other out-
comes, but given that studies were largely concentrated 
in a few categories, not all moderator categories could be 
examined to determine if relations between fear of pain 
and  outcomes  differed.  Future  research  should  seek  to 
replicate  and  extend  the  current  findings  as  research 
regarding  fear  of  pain  continues  to  evolve.  Finally,  the 
current  study  focused  on  self- report  measures  of  the 
Fear- Avoidance  Model  components.  Whilst  these  are 
the most widely used measures of fear of pain, there is 
emerging evidence that suggests behavioural paradigms 
may capture different aspects of fear of pain, including 
pain- specific  attention  bias  (Boselie  et  al.,  2019),  that 
may be relevant to its relation to pain outcomes. Future 
research is needed.

Overall,  the  current  meta- analysis  replicates  and  ex-
tends past work to suggest that pain catastrophizing, fear 
of pain and pain vigilance are positively, and moderately 
associated with psychological outcomes (i.e. pain- related 
negative  affect,  anxiety,  depression)  and  pain  outcomes 
(pain  intensity  and  pain- related  disability).  Differences 
in the strengths of the associations appear to depend on 
the type of self- report tool used to assess fear of pain, as 
well as where the data were collected. The results of this 
study continue to highlight the importance of fear of pain 
in pain- related outcomes and suggest that improving in-
terventions targeting fear of pain may improve both psy-
chological and pain- related function and quality of life for 
those with pain conditions.
