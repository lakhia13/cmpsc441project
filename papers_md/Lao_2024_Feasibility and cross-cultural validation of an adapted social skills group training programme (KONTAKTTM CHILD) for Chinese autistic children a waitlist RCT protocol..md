ABSTRACT
Introduction  School- age autistic children commonly 
experience social communication and interaction 
challenges in their everyday lives. While international 
evidence suggests that social skills group training (SSGT) 
programmes can support autistic children, improving their 
psychosocial functioning, to date there is no standardised 
evidence- based SSGT tailored towards the needs of 
autistic children aged 8–12 years living in the Chinese 
Mainland. Therefore, the primary objective of this study 
will be to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of 
a culturally adapted 16- session version of the social 
skills programme KONTAKT in Chinese autistic children. 
Additionally, preliminary efficacy and cost- effectiveness 
will be assessed to inform a future definitive trial.
Methods and analysis  This study will employ a 
randomised, single- blinded, waitlist- controlled feasibility 
design with 36 Chinese autistic children aged 8–12 years 
with IQ over 70 referred to the Child Development and 
Behavior Center in Guangzhou, China. Participants will be 
randomly assigned to either the immediate training group 
or the delayed training group stratified by sex. Feasibility 
will be assessed using quantitative and qualitative data 
obtained from the KONTAKT CHILD participants, their 
parents and facilitators of the programme. Preliminary 
efficacy and cost- effectiveness are assessed via 
quantitative data obtained at five time points. The primary 
efficacy outcome is participants’ improvement in social 
skills as measured by the Contextual Assessment of Social 
Skills. Other outcomes include parents and teachers’ 
reports of participants’ autistic traits and adaptive 
functioning, participants’ self- report and projective tests 
for self- assertiveness and psychosocial functioning, 
and parent reports on parental reflective functioning 
and perceived school support. Common process factors 
and their effects on outcomes will also be explored. 
Cost- effectiveness will consider from both societal and 
healthcare perspectives.
Ethics and dissemination  The current study protocol 
has been reviewed and ethics approval has been obtained 
from the Ethical Board Committee at the Third Affiliated 
Hospital of Sun Yat- sen University (II2023- 119- 01). 
The trial was pre- registered in Chinese Clinical Trials 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ Comprehensive  assessment  of  diverse  outcomes 

via multiple informants.

 ⇒ Systematic cultural adaptation using the integrative 
cultural adaptation framework ensuring the appro-
priateness of the Chinese version of KONTAKT.
 ⇒ Collection of data on readiness for change, providing 

insights into ‘help- seeker’ effects.

 ⇒ Limited  generalisability  due  to  a  single  study  site, 
location- specific inclusion and absence of an active 
comparator.

 ⇒ Given  the  absence  of  previous  research  exam-
ining  the  efficacy  of  social  skills  group  training 
programmes  in  autistic  children  in  the  Chinese 
Mainland,  this  study  is  appropriately  a  feasibil-
ity  study. As  such,  only  the  preliminary  efficacy  of 
KONTAKT with this population in a small sample will 
be  examined. The  small  sample  size  will  limit  the 
power of the study in examining the effect of mod-
erators on the study outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Background and rationale
Autism  is  a  neurodevelopmental  condition 
characterised  by  persistent  challenges  in 
reciprocal  social  interaction  and  communi-
cation.1  Autistic  children  often  struggle  to 
comply with social expectations and norms of 
communication  and  interaction,  impacting 
their functioning in everyday contexts.2 The 
estimated  prevalence  of  autism  among  chil-
dren  aged  6–12  in  the  Chinese  Mainland  is 

1

0.7% (~1 in 143 children), and nearly half of all autistic 
children  attend  mainstream  schools.3  While  there  is 
limited  research  investigating  the  experiences  of  these 
children, their families and teachers, there is a clear and 
urgent  need  for  evidence- based  interventions  aiming  to 
support the social competence and well- being of Chinese 
autistic children in their everyday lives.

Internationally,  social  skills  group  training  (SSGT) 
programmes  are  demonstrating  efficacy  in  supporting 
verbal and cognitively able school- age autistic children in 
developing their social skills.4–6 SSGTs facilitate socioemo-
tional  development  and  promote  well- being  in  autistic 
children  by  explicitly  and  implicitly  supporting  autistic 
children  in  interacting  with  peers  and  participating  in 
society more broadly.7 SSGTs also leverage the benefits of 
learning in a group, with opportunities for peer learning 
and  support.  Multiple  meta- analyses  of  randomised 
controlled  trials  (RCTs)  evaluating  the  efficacy  of  these 
programmes  in  autistic  youth  report  moderate  to  large 
effect sizes (ES) in achieving personally meaningful social 
goals,  enhancing  social  skills,  social  skills  knowledge, 
social participation and social functioning.4 8–10

While there has been considerable investigation on the 
proximal intervention outcomes of SSGT programmes in 
autistic children and adolescents and post- test and short- 
term follow- up periods, there has been limited focus on 
longer  term  outcomes  and  the  generalisation  of  learnt 
skills to everyday contexts such as schools. Further, with few 
exceptions, the outcomes of these programmes have been 
largely assessed by parents. This is of particular concern 
given that most study designs have not employed single- 
blinded observation of outcome measures.4 8 Results from 
previous  meta- analyses4  8  11  12  infer  that  improvements 
observed  in  parent  and  clinical  ratings  were  primarily 
related  to  increased  social  skills  knowledge  or  specific 
task- related skills, rather than assessments of the general-
isation of skills to everyday contexts.8

SSGT programmes have also been criticised for failing 
to  consider  the  view  of  autistic  youth  themselves  in  the 
design and delivery of the programmes.13 While capturing 
and accounting for the views of autistic young people may 
require  effort,  given  their  communication  challenges,14 
increasingly  autistic  advocates  and  the  autistic  commu-
nity are calling for researchers and clinicians to consider 
and  incorporate  their  views  in  clinical  interventions.15 
It  is  also  likely  that  coproducing  SSGT  with  individuals 
with  lived  experience  will  enhance  the  efficacy  of  these 
programmes  in  relation  to  the  intended  target  group.16 
Further,  given  the  inherent  challenges  experienced  by 
autistic children in understanding social interactions and 
emotional content, questions have been raised regarding 
the  validity  and  accuracy  of  self- report  questionnaires 
aiming  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  SSGT  programmes  on 
these  children.17  Despite  these  cautions,  findings  from 
a  recent  meta- analysis  suggest  that  the  emotional  self- 
awareness  of  school- age  autistic  children  is  comparable 
to  their  non- autistic  peers.18  It  seems  plausible  that 
approaches  tailored  to  the  communication  needs  and 

2

preferences  of  autistic  children  will  be  more  successful 
in gathering their perspectives.19 Further, while unusual 
in SSGT or autism research context, validated non- verbal 
psychometric  assessments,  such  as  the  Draw- A- Person 
Test,20 21 may be a worthwhile tool for understanding chil-
dren’s psychosocial functioning.22–24

Methodological  limitations  of  previous  SSGT  efficacy 
studies  include  a  failure  to  consider  common  process 
factors.25 Process factors are elements that are inherently 
present in receiving and delivering a health intervention, 
that  unfold  progressively  throughout  its  delivery  and 
include  participants’  expectations,  willingness  to  partic-
ipate  and  the  alliance  between  participants  and  facilita-
tors. While a significant proportion of SSGT studies have 
reported  programme  adherence  and  satisfaction,8  the 
data  obtained  by  these  studies  were  largely  descriptive 
and failed to systematically examine the impact of process 
factors in relation to intervention outcomes.25

The  KONTAKT  programme 

is  a  well- established 
SSGT  designed  for  autistic  children  and  adolescents 
with  and  without  co- occurring  conditions.26  Origi-
nating  in  Germany,27  it  has  now  been  further  devel-
oped,  standardised,  culturally  adapted  and  evaluated  in 
Sweden28 29 and Australia.30 Three session- length variants 
(24, 16 and 12 sessions) have been standardised and eval-
uated  through  RCTs,  demonstrating  efficacy  and  effec-
tiveness  in  improving  participants’  social  functioning, 
adaptive  functioning,  emotional  well- being,  emotion 
recognition  and  regulation,  as  well  as  accomplishment 
of personally meaningful social goals.28–30 Findings across 
these studies suggest that KONTAKT may be particularly 
beneficial to autistic teenagers and girls. Moreover, both 
quantitative and qualitative data support the conclusion 
that  KONTAKT  is  effective,  safe  and  well  received  by 
autistic youth.28–32

To  our  knowledge,  while  a  standardised  SSGT 
programme  PEERS  has  been  tailored  for  use  with 
Chinese autistic adolescents,33 there is no culturally stan-
dardised SSGT programme specifically tailored towards 
the needs of autistic children years in the Chinese Main-
land (See online supplemental file 1 for a comparison 
between  the  KONTAKT  CHILD  and  the  Mandarin 
PEERS; see also Afsharnejad et al,6 pp 1286–1287, and 
Table  4).6  With  its  diverse,  individualised  and  natural-
istic  session  design,26  it  is  anticipated  that  KONTAKT 
will effectively support the social functioning and well- 
being of Chinese autistic children, provided the context 
of  Chinese  culture  and  its  associated  social  norms  are 
incorporated.34

Cultural  adaptation  involves  systematically  modifying 
an  evidence- based  intervention  to  align  with  the  target 
population’s  needs,  values,  languages,  conditions  and 
customs.35–37  However,  only  a  few  cultural  adaptation 
studies on SSGT have well- documented and theoretically 
based  methodologies.  Moreover,  previous  SSGT  efficacy 
studies generally lacked input from the target population, 
despite language translation and the inclusion of cultur-
ally relevant content.6

Lao U, et al. BMJ Open 2024;14:e081827. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-081827Ignoring cultural differences can significantly hamper 
the effectiveness of evidence- based SSGTs for autistic indi-
viduals.34 Given the core characteristics of autism involve 
social  interaction  and  communication,  social- ecological 
differences  across  cultures  will  undoubtedly  influence 
interpretations of ‘functioning’ and ‘disorder’ in autism.38 
Cultural factors also impact established expectations and 
interactions between families and service providers, and 
between  service  providers  in  various  sectors  including 
healthcare, education and the broader community.39–41

For  example,  Chinese  parents  are  unlikely  to  disclose 
their  child’s  autism  diagnosis  to  school,  reflecting 
the  limited  collaboration  between  family  and  school, 
prevailing autism stereotypes and fears regarding stigma.42 
Moreover,  Chinese  autistic  children  are  commonly  not 
informed of their autism diagnosis, with the majority of 
parents choosing not to disclose the diagnosis to them.43 
There are also clear differences in the prevailing service 
delivery paradigms relevant to supporting autistic children 
in  the  Chinese  Mainland  compared  with  many  Western 
countries.  Service  delivery  in  the  Chinese  Mainland  is 
significantly impacted by a large population and limited 
health professionals and public health services.44 45 Unlike 
many Western countries, where funding and child health 
services  for  autistic  children  are  commonly  provided  by 
governmental departments, the Chinese Mainland relies 
primarily on parents to cover these costs.46

While there are various cultural adaptation frameworks 
guiding  the  alignment  of  health  interventions  with  the 
needs of a target population,35 36 47 48 despite some meth-
odological  distinctions,  they  share  many  similarities.  In 
aligning the KONTAKT SSGT programme with the needs 
of  autistic  children  living  in  the  Chinese  Mainland,  this 
study  adopts  the  integrative  cultural  adaptation  frame-
work  (ICAF).35  The  ICAF  involves  five  stages:  informa-
tion  gathering,  preliminary  design,  preliminary  efficacy 
testing, refinement and final trial. This study focuses on 
the first four stages of the ICAF in preparing for final eval-
uation trial (the last stage).

Objectives and hypotheses
The overarching purpose of the present study is to assess 
the  feasibility  and  cross- cultural  validity  of  the  adapted 
16- session version of the KONTAKT CHILD programme 
for Chinese autistic children in preparation for a larger 
RCT trial. The specific objectives are:
1.  Evaluate  the  integration  of  KONTAKT  CHILD  pro-

gramme into a tertiary hospital’s routine activity.

2.  Assess the acceptability and feasibility of the data col-

lection framework.

3.  Examine the preliminary efficacy and quantitative and 
qualitative effects of KONTAKT to inform a future, de-
finitive RCT.

4.  Explore the impact of common process factors on in-

tervention outcomes.

5.  Examine  the  cost- effectiveness  of  KONTAKT  CHILD 

compared with standard care.

Open access

Our primary hypothesis is that the Chinese 16- session 
KONTAKT  CHILD  programme  will  be  feasible  and 
culturally appropriate for Chinese autistic children with 
minor revisions and can be successfully implemented in 
a tertiary clinic. We also hypothesise that participants in 
the  immediate  training  group  (ITG),  in  comparison  to 
the delayed training group (DTG) (waitlist), will experi-
ence greater improvements in outcomes from time 1 to 
time 3 (waiting period of DTG). We expect that partici-
pants and their parents with higher readiness for change 
and  a  stronger  alliance  in  the  ITG  will  benefit  more 
from  KONTAKT  CHILD.  Moreover,  we  anticipate  that 
the  training  effects  in  the  ITG  will  persist  at  follow- up, 
and  significant  improvements  in  children’s  outcomes 
will  occur  in  the  DTG  from  time  3  to  time  5  (training 
endpoint  of  the  DTG).  For  cost- effective  analysis,  we 
hypothesise that the additional costs for KONTAKT will 
be offset by participants’ improvement in health- related 
quality of life and out- of- pocket savings in the use of other 
mental health and psychiatric services.

TRIAL DESIGN
This study was approved by the Ethical Board Committee 
at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat- sen University 
(II2023- 119- 01)  and  pre- registered  in  Chinese  Clinical 
Trials (ChiCTR2300072136).

Any  modification  to  this  protocol  will  be  reported  to 
the ethical board and updated in Chinese Clinical Trials. 
Following Thabane and Lancaster’s guidelines in 2019,49 
this Chinese KONTAKT CHILD protocol is planned and 
reported following the Standard Protocol Items: Recom-
mendations  for  Interventional  Trials.50  The  findings  of 
this study will be reported adherent to the Consolidated 
Standards  of  Reporting  Trials  for  Social  and  Psycholog-
ical Interventions (CONSORT- SPI).51

The  Chinese  KONTAKT  CHILD  feasibility  study 
has  a  prospective,  waitlist- controlled,  single- site,  strati-
fied  randomised  design.  Blinding  will  apply  to  the  data 
collected,  outcome  adjudicators  and  data  analysis.  All 
electronic  files,  including  coding  videos  and  scanned 
drawings,  will  be  named  without  identifying  personal 
information  and  group  allocation  or  time  point  infor-
mation.  Three  major  assessment  time  points  (ITG: 
pretraining  (T1),  post- training  (T3),  follow- up  (T5); 
DTG:  pretraining  (T1),  pretraining  (T3),  post- training 
(T5)),  with  additional  midpoint  cost  and  processing 
factors data collection for each group, are included. Addi-
tional midpoint cost data collection follows the 2- month 
follow- up  intervals  recommended  by  the  Treatment 
Inventory of Costs in Patients with Psychiatric Disorders- 
Child version (TiC- PC) manual.52 Measurements will be 
taken  during  face- to- face  meetings,  with  the  exception 
of  data  from  teachers  and  the  prescreening  process. 
Further, this study will employ a mixed- methods design, 
with both between- group and within- participant compar-
isons,  to  explore  the  feasibility,  acceptability  of  imple-
menting a large- scale RCT and the preliminary efficacy of

the Chinese KONTAKT CHILD programme. Randomis-
ation is performed at a 1:1 allocation ratio, with variable 
block length and stratification by sex. Participant recruit-
ment and training are ongoing between 5 June 2023 and 
1 March 2025.

METHODS: PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES
Study setting
All  in- person  assessments  and  interventions,  except  for 
the  excursion  session,  will  take  place  at  the  outpatient 
department  of  the  Child  Development  and  Behavior 
Center  (CDBC)  of  the  tertiary  academic  hospital,  the 
Third  Affiliated  Hospital  of  Sun  Yat- sen  University  in 
Guangzhou,  China.  The  CDBC  is  one  of  China’s  first 
leading  developmental  behavioural 
established  and 
paediatric units, with over 20 years of experience in diag-
nosing and promoting the well- being of autistic individ-
uals  and  their  families.  The  CDBC  provides  over  10 000 
clinic appointments annually to neurodivergent children 
and  their  families  across  China  seeking  diagnostic  and 
intervention services.

Online assessments will be designed using the Survey-
Star  online  survey  platform  (https://wjx.cn/).  The 
SurveyStar  is  one  of  the  most  popular  electronic  survey 
platforms in Chinese contexts, with its services covering 
more than 3 million enterprises and 90% of universities 
in China.

Due  to  limited  email  use  in  the  Chinese  Mainland, 
WeChat, the dominant instant messaging and media app, 
will be the primary channel for participant recruitment, 
communication with families and online survey distribu-
tion. Additionally, the SurveyStar conveniently integrates 
with WeChat through a Mini Program,53 allowing WeChat 
users  to  seamlessly  complete  questionnaires  directly  on 
the platform.

The certified KONTAKT(TM) trainers are experienced 
CDBC  clinicians  (clinical  psychologists,  developmental 
behavioural  paediatricians  and  therapists)  working  with 
Chinese  autistic  children  (with  3–10  years  of  working 
experience).  They  have  completed  standardised  online 
KONTAKT methodological training provided by experi-
enced trainers from the Center of Neurodevelopmental 
Disorders  at  Karolinska  Institutet  (KIND),  including 
self- directed  training  and  videoconference  seminars, 
followed  by  a  13- session  enhanced  in- person  training. 
The  enhanced  training  course  mainly  included  trainers 
role- playing the child sessions and more in- depth discus-
sion on the principles of KONTAKT.

All  KONTAKT  CHILD  sessions,  except  for  the  excur-
sion session, will be delivered in a spacious, well- lit room 
at CDBC, with participants and trainers sitting in a circle. 
As  suggested  in  the  KONTAKT  manual,  delivery  of  the 
programme  content  will  be  supported  by  a  flip  chart, 
used  to  record  notes  during  each  session,  and  a  board 
displaying  the  group  rules,  session  agenda  and  points 
assigned to participants in recognition of their participa-
tion in the sessions. The excursion session (session 9) will 

4

be  in  a  café,  a  bubble  tea  shop  or  a  convenience  store, 
accessible from CDBC. Parent sessions will take place in 
a separate room, with parents sitting together in a circle 
without  their  children  present.  A  projector  will  be  used 
to present information on the principles and the content 
of KONTAKT, and information pertaining to their role, 
such as completing assignments and providing construc-
tive  feedback,  in  supporting  their  children  during  the 
intervention period.

Recruitment
Figure  1  displays  the  flow  of  participants  throughout 
the  study.  Thirty- six  autistic  children  will  be  recruited 
through the outpatient department of the CDBC in two 
rounds of recruitment. Multiple recruitment avenues will 
be  used  including  word  of  mouth,  referrals  from  clini-
cians,  posters  displaying  information  about  the  study 
at the CDBC clinic and flyers published on the WeChat 
account of CDBC (https://www.wechat.com/).

Parents  will  express  their  interest  in  the  study  by 
completing  a  brief  online  registration  form  (taking 
approximately  10–15 min  to  complete)  obtaining  their 
contact information, their children’s demographic infor-
mation,  diagnostic  statuses,  previous  evaluations  on  the 
Wechsler  Intelligence  Scale  for  Children- IV  Chinese 
version  (WISC- IV),54  the  Autism  Diagnostic  Observa-
tion  Schedule- Generic  (ADOS- G)55  and  screening  for 
problem behaviours which may impact on their ability to 
engage positively in a group setting using the Childhood 
Behavior  Checklist- Parent  version  (CBCL).56  Obtaining 
parents’ expression of interest in this way enables estima-
tion of the demand for KONTAKT from families engaging 
with CDBC.

Following the submission of their expression of interest, 
a research coordinator will assess candidates’ eligibility to 
participate in the study. Parents of children meeting the 
inclusion  criteria  for  the  study  will  subsequently  partic-
ipate  in  a  10  to  20 min  prescreening  phone  interview, 
discussing with the research team their child’s school lives 
(eg, how their child is getting along with their classmates 
and teachers), academic performances and special needs, 
and  addressing  any  study- related  questions.  This  brief 
interview with parents will also ascertain potential partic-
ipants’  suitability  to  cope  with  the  cognitive  and  verbal 
demands of KONTAKT.

If fulfilling the prescreening criteria, candidate partic-
ipants and their parents will attend CDBC for a 50 min. 
face- to- face  intake  interview  with  the  research  coordi-
nator.  During  the  intake  interview,  both  children  and 
parents  will  participate  in  a  20  min.  individual  inter-
view  with  the  research  coordinator.  Families  meeting 
the inclusion criteria of the study will be provided with 
detailed oral and written information about their partic-
ipation in the study, including the requirements. Written 
informed  consent  will  be  obtained  from  parents  and 
children.

Intervention
KONTAKT CHILD intervention
Prior to the development of this study protocol, a prelim-
inary  adaptation  of  KONTAKT  (the  first  step  of  the 
ICAF—information gathering) has been completed. The 
KONTAKT programme includes workbooks for trainers, 
children  and  parents,  supporting  intervention  fidelity. 
In  adapting  the  16- session  variant  of  KONTAKT  from 
the  Australian  English  version  to  Mandarin  Chinese, 
a  rigorous  process  was  employed.  First,  an  initial  trans-
lation  was  made  and  verified  for  accuracy  by  bilingual 
authors  (UL,  HZ  and  WB).  Then,  a  working  group  of 
KONTAKT  Chinese  trainers,  who  are  also  CDBC  clini-
cians, provided feedback on the initial programme mate-
rials. This step resulted in significant modifications to the 
discussion topics, particularly regarding those addressing 
autism diagnosis, making them more general and implicit 
(most  notably  in  session  3).  In  addition,  to  encourage 
parents  to  discuss  the  autism  diagnosis  with  their  child, 
information relating to ‘how to talk about the diagnosis 
with your child’ was added to the first parent session. This 
adaptation was made given that research has highlighted 
that  over  60%  of  Chinese  autistic  children  are  unaware 
of their autism diagnosis, with 40% of parents of Chinese 
autistic children preferring not to disclose an autism diag-
nosis to their children.43

The current adaptation of the KONTAKT programme 
also emphasises enhanced parent education and support. 
Parents will receive information and resources to support 
their  children  with  the  KONTAKT  homework  activities. 
This  includes  parents  role- playing  parent–child  interac-
tions during homework completion contexts and demon-
stration videos. Throughout the programme, KONTAKT 
trainers  will  also  provide  session- by- session  feedback, 
interim  and  final  report  to  parents  on  their  child’s 
progress.  Additionally,  they  will  offer  ongoing  coaching 
and  encouragement  to  parents.  This  enhanced  parent 
support  directly  addresses  a  need  identified  in  previous 
research33—Chinese parents expressed a desire for addi-
tional coaching skills education to facilitate their autistic 
children’s participation in SSGTs.

Moreover,  members  of  the  Chinese  research  team 
further  modified  and  added  questions,  games,  activities 
and  scenarios  aligned  with  Chinese  cultural  norms.  A 
Chinese  name  was  also  created  for  KONTAKT,  empha-
sising  the  training’s  focus  on  meaningful  socialisation 
(交得益TM).  Finally,  a  family  with  an  autistic  adoles-
cent  proofread  the  manual  and  made  edits  to  enhance 
language  fluency  and  readability,  and  the  inclusion  of 
culturally  appropriate  terminology.  Additionally,  a  logo 
for the Chinese version of KONTAKT was designed and 
used  on  customised  stationary  and  course  materials  to 
foster a sense of group cohesion among participants.

KONTAKT  integrates  cognitive–behavioural  therapy 
principles  and  learning  principles  tailored  towards  the 
needs  of  autistic  youth  (see  figure  2).26  These  include 
principles  of  psychoeducation,  observational  learning, 
modelling,  behavioural  activation,  homework,  comput-
erised  cognitive  training,  opportunities  for  rehearsal,  a 
structured agenda and parental involvement. KONTAKT 
employs  mandatory,  recurring  and  variable  activities 
to  support  participants  in  achieving  their  personally 
meaningful social goals. Sessions aim to enhance under-
standing  of  social  norms,  develop  adaptive  socioemo-
tional skills and promote practical applications. The first 
11  sessions  of  KONTAKT  consistently  present  weekly 
themes  and  assignments,  while  later  sessions  are  led  by 
the participants and tailored towards topics of interest to 
each  group.  In  this  way,  KONTAKT  accommodates  for 
cultural context and for the subtle differences and pref-
erences of each KONTAKT group.

A group of four to six participants will attend 16 consec-
utive sessions of KONTAKT led by two to three trainers 
on weekends, with each session lasting approximately 60 
min.  Three  parent  sessions  will  take  place  at  the  begin-
ning,  middle  and  end  of  the  training,  offering  parents 
individual feedback on their child’s progress, presenting 
educational  information  on  autism  and  approaches 
to  discussing  an  autism  diagnosis  with  their  child  and 
encouraging parents in socially coaching their children. 
During the parent sessions, opportunities will be provided 
encouraging  parents  to  ask  questions,  provide  feed-
back and engage with other parents of autistic children. 
Parents  will  be  encouraged  to  assist  their  children  with 
homework,  with  trainers  providing  feedback  to  parents 
after  each  session.  Refer  to  online  supplementary  file  1 
- supplementary Table 2 for the structure and content of 
the Chinese KONTAKT CHILD version.

To ensure fidelity to the KONTAKT training protocol, 
trainers  will  complete  session- by- session  fidelity  check-
lists  and  receive  supervision  from  certified  KONTAKT 
trainers.

Description of the rationale for adopting the Chinese 
16-session KONTAKT
While  KONTAKT  has  been  previously  standardised  and 
published  in  12  and  24- session  variants,  the  reasons 
underpinning the choice to tailor the 16- session variant 
to  the  Chinese  Mainland  were  threefold.  First,  previous 
research found that the 12- session variant did not signifi-
cantly  outperform  standard  care  in  Sweden  in  chil-
dren,28 and the 24- session variant had a higher attrition 
rate  than  the  16- session  variant  and  12- session  variant 
(26%  vs  11%/14%).28–30  Moreover,  aligning  with  the 
Chinese  academic  year  structure,  which  consists  of  two 
terms  with  approximately  5 months  each,  the  16- session 
version is more practical. Lastly, evaluating the 16- session 
variant  will  result  in  the  DTG  waiting  for  a  period  of  4 
to 5 months, which would be extended by evaluating the 
24- session  variant  and  negatively  impact  on  adherence 
and the timelines of access to the intervention.57

Figure 2  Elements, structures and goals of KONTAKT.7 26

Explanation for the choice of comparators
The  waiting  period  of  the  DTG  is  limited  to  4  to  5 
months, roughly equivalent to one round of KONTAKT 
training.  While  an  active  comparator  in  an  RCT  is  typi-
cally the most robust, due to limited clinical resources in 
the Chinese Mainland, a waitlist control group is consid-
ered  more  practical.  Moreover,  given  that  ‘nonspecific’ 
care  is  common  in  the  Chinese  Mainland,  a  waitlist 
control group allows for assessing the additional impact 
of KONTAKT CHILD in addition to standard care.

Intervention adherence
We  will  use  a  participant  attendance  sheet  to  track 
compliance, aiming for at least 80% attendance (13 out 
of 16 sessions) as acceptable. Homework completion will 
also  be  recorded,  with  a  target  of  over  60%  considered 
tolerable.

We  will  further  adopt  several  approaches  as  recom-
mended  by  Robiner  to  enhance  the  waitlist  group’s 
adherence58:
1.  Provide detailed study information to families during 

intake interviews.

2.  Emphasise to families the importance of adherence.
3.  Establish  a  collaborative  working  relationship  with 
families during intake interviews to develop trust and 
rapport.

4.  Offer face- to- face assessments for regular clinical visits 

during the waiting periods.

5.  Limit the waiting time for the DTG to 4 to 5 months 

with a single- round intervention.

6.  Schedule  appointments  at  times  convenient  to  fami-

lies, for example, on weekends.

Randomisation
After  the  initial  visit  to  the  clinic,  participants  will  be 
randomised  to  either  ITG  or  DTG.  Randomisation  will 
be conducted by a third party not involved in the Chinese 
KONTAKT  CHILD 
trial  using  computer- generated 
sequentially  random  numbers.  The  permuted  block 
numbers  4  to  6  will  be  used  to  restrict  randomisation 
within  the  strata  (birth- assigned  sex).  Each  participant 
will be assigned a unique code.

Assessments/measures
Outcomes will be assessed from the perspective of multiple 
informants (children, parents, teachers, clinical ratings) 
via  multiple  data  collection  methods  (questionnaires, 
interviews, observations, projective tests). The data collec-
tion timeline is presented in online supplemental file 2.

All online questionnaire fields are mandatory, requiring 
completion  to  progress,  eliminating  the  expectation 
of  missing  data.  QR  codes  will  be  used  for  distributing 
the  registration  and  teacher  questionnaires,  completed 
via  the  WeChat  app.  All  teacher  questionnaires  will  be 
assigned a unique participant identification number.

Primary  outcome  measures  will  inform  the  feasibility  of 
conducting  a  full  RCT.  Feasibility  outcomes  include

Table 2  Feasibility parameters and criteria for success

Parameter

Collection methods

Criteria for success

Recruitment rate

The number of families being approached within the 
recruitment period versus the actual recruited number of 
families (consented).

Dropout rate

Retention rate

The number of families discontinued from the study versus 
the total number of recruited families.

The number of families, school teachers and service providers 
who complete all assessment time points versus those who 
do not complete all assessment time points (reasons for non- 
compliance will be recorded).

Attendance rate

The mean and median number of all sessions attended.

Homework completion 
rate

The number of completed assignments versus incomplete 
assignments.

Training fidelity score

Trainers self- rated adherence to the sessions protocol using 
KONTAKT fidelity checklist (KFC). Each item will be scored ‘0’ 
for no adherence and ‘1’ for adherence. The fidelity score for 
each session will be calculated by summing up all items and 
divided by the total items.

During each round of recruitment within 
a period of one- and- a- half months (two 
rounds in total), a 50% of recruitment 
rate is considered acceptable.
Less than 15% of dropout (at least 31 
families retained).

At least 80% of retention rate.

At least 80% of attendance (13 out of 
16 sessions).

At least 60% of homework completion 
(of the 15 assignments, at least 9 are 
completed or partially completed).
At least an average fidelity score of 0.8 
for all sessions.

criteria for success.

Secondary outcomes will focus on the preliminary efficacy 
of  the  Chinese  16- session  KONTAKT,  which  will  inform 
the future full- scale RCT. Outcomes include the following 
measures.

The  primary  efficacy  outcome  of  the  KONTAKT 
CHILD  study  is  improvement  in  social  communication 
and interaction skills. This is assessed using the Contex-
tual  Assessment  of  Social  Skills  (CASS),  an  ecologically 
valid  observational  measure.63  The  CASS  involves  two 
videotaped  role- play  assessments  where  participants 
engage in reciprocal conversation and interaction. These 
assessments take place in contexts that are manipulated 
to  be  either  interesting  or  boring.  This  manipulation 
is  achieved  by  changing  how  the  confederate  responds 
and interacts with the participant. During each role- play, 
participants  and  an  unknown  adult  confederate  of  an 
opposite  birth- assigned  sex  pretend  that  they  have  just 
joined a new club and are waiting for the first session to 
begin. During this 3 min waiting period, participants and 
the adult confederate can talk to each other.

Secondary  efficacy  outcomes  include  autistic  char-
acteristics  (Social  Responsiveness  Scale- 2  (SRS- 2)),64 
generalised social skills (Snack Time Assessment of Rela-
tionships  and  Social  Skills),63  65  adaptive  functioning 
(Adaptive Behavior Assessment System- II),66 67 self- esteem 
and  self- concept  (Self- Concept  Scale  Draw- A- Person 
(SCS- DAP)68  and  Child  Rosenberg  Self- Esteem  Scale 
(CRSES)),69  cognitive  development  and  psychosocial 
well- being  (Koppitz  Draw- A- Person  Test70  71  and  Child 
Outcome  Rating  Scale),72  73  perceived  school  support 
school  level33  and  parental  reflective  functioning.74 
Common process factor measurements include alliance (Ther-
apeutic  Alliance  Scales  for  Children)75  76  and  readiness 
for change (Preparedness for Participating in KONTAKT 
Scale).77  Cost- effectiveness  outcomes 
include  healthcare 
consumption  and  productivity  loss  (the  tailored  version 
of the TiC- PC)78 79 and health- related quality of life (Child 
Health Utility 9D (CHU9D)80 and EQ- 5D- Y).81

For details of these measures, see online supplemental 

file 2.

Retention
Families  will  be  requested  to  attend  data  collection 
appointments at a time convenient to them with reminders 
from research assistants. Paper- pencil questionnaires will 
be  mailed  to  families  unable  to  attend  appointments  in 
person  and  provided  with  a  prepaid  envelope  to  return 
these  via  post.  The  reasons  for  participant  withdrawal, 
adverse events and other unintended effects will be docu-
mented and reported, and dropouts will not be replaced.

Data management
In  the  Chinese  KONTAKT  CHILD  feasibility  study,  all 
paper data will be converted to electronic format. Trained 
research assistants will input the data within 2 weeks after 
each assessment. Both paper and electronic data will be 

Open access

stored  in  EpiData82  with  double- entry  for  data  integrity. 
Checks  for  referenced  range  values,  valid  values  and 
regular  data  consistency  will  be  applied.  Non- numerical 
data, including open- ended questions and notes, will be 
entered as originally written.

Video  and  audio  recordings  will  be  labelled  with 
unique  identifiers,  with  details  recorded  in  the  EpiData 
repository.  Paper  documents  will  be  securely  stored  in 
locked  filing  cabinets  at  CDBC.  Electronic  textual  data 
will be password protected. Video and audio files will have 
dual backups on encrypted hard disks. Only the principal 
investigator will have full data access.

Incremental data and recording files will be backed up 

daily.

Sample size
The primary efficacy outcome of this present study is the 
CASS. Previous SSGT studies applying the CASS suggested 
a medium ES of 0.42.83 Additionally, a rough average ES of 
0.40, as measured by the SRS- 2, is derived from the three 
prior RCT studies evaluating KONTAKT,28–30 and informs 
the  expected  ES  for  the  future  Chinese  KONTAKT 
CHILD main trial. According to Whitehead et al,84 a feasi-
bility  study  with  a  sample  size  of  15  per  treatment  arm 
allows  for  detecting  a  medium  ES  (0.30  to  0.70)  with 
90%  power  and  two- sided  5%  significance  in  the  main 
trial.  Accounting  for  a  15%  attrition  rate  from  previous 
KONTAKT evaluation studies, we require a sample size of 
n=18 per arm (n=36 in total).

Statistical analysis
Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes
Feasibility measures will be reported descriptively. Addi-
tionally,  qualitative  data  will  be  transcribed  verbatim, 
deidentified  and  then  imported  into  NVivo  V.12  for 
theme- based  analysis.  If  all  or  some  feasibility  parame-
ters for success are not met (tables 1 and 2), or if salient 
themes of unacceptability or unfeasibility emerged within 
the qualitative analysis, investigators will further examine 
the  potential  contributing  factors,  including  participant 
baseline  characteristics  and  session- composition  charac-
teristics. This analysis will inform necessary modifications 
to the KONTAKT CHILD training and its delivery in the 
Chinese Mainland.

For  preliminary  efficacy  analysis,  the  primary  effi-
cacy  outcome  for  this  study  is  social  communication 
skills  improvement  as  measured  by  the  CASS,  with  the 
follow- up  being  the  primary  endpoint.  The  analysis  will 
follow  the  intention- to- treat  (ITT)  principles,85  and  all 
data from every participant will be analysed. Missing data 
will be handled based on established guidelines for each 
measure or CONSORT- SPI statement. No interim analysis 
will occur.

Data  will  be  checked  for  normality  and  variance 
heterogeneity. Baseline demographics will be compared 
between ITG and DTG using t- tests or Wilcoxon rank test 
(continuous variables) and χ2 tests (categorical variables) 
to  verify  group  comparability.  Random  mixed- effects

Lao U, et al. BMJ Open 2024;14:e081827. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-081827Open access 

regression models, which have the advantage of handling 
missing data, will compare ITG and DTG for primary and 
secondary analyses, considering time (baseline, endpoint, 
follow- up), group (ITG, DTG) and their interaction vari-
able  (time×group).  Participants’  ID  will  be  regarded  as 
a  random  effect  accounting  for  intraindividual  correla-
tions.  Intervention  effects  will  be  reported  as  least 
squares mean differences. ES will be reported by dividing 
the  groups’  mean  difference  (baseline  to  endpoint  and 
baseline  to  follow- up)  by  the  pooled  SDs,  with  positive 
values favouring the intervention. Potential moderators, 
including  age,  sex,  IQ,  co- occurring  conditions  and  the 
common process factors at baseline between participants 
with high training responses (defined as ≥30% improve-
ment  on  CASS  scores  at  follow- up),  medium  training 
responses (defined as 10 to 30% improvement) and low 
training  responses  (defined  as  ≤10%  improvement  or 
worsened),  will  be  compared  using  either  one- way  anal-
ysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  (continuous  variables)  or  χ2 
tests (categorical variables).31–33 Post hoc Dunn test or χ2 
test will be conducted if the ANOVA tests or multiple χ2 
tests demonstrate significant group differences. ES will be 
presented as either Hedge’s g or Cramer’s V.

Health economic analyses
Cost- effectiveness analysis (CEA) will follow an ITT basis, 
considering  societal  and  healthcare  perspectives.  Cost 
differences will be statistically tested, while resource usage 
differences will not be compared to prevent false positives. 
Quality- adjusted life- years (QALY) will be calculated from 
EQ- 5D- Y  and  CHU9D  scores  using  validated  algorithms 
for  Chinese  children  and  adolescents.86  87  Given  poten-
tial non- normality in cost data, a non- parametric random 
forest permutation model will handle missing data. The 
incremental  cost- effectiveness  ratio  will  be  calculated  as 
Δcost/ΔQALYs. Cost differences between ITG and DTG 
at different time points will be analysed via linear regres-
sion with bootstrapping for 5000 repetitions to generate 
non- parametric  CIs  (see  online  supplemental  file  3  for 
CEA details).

Community and public involvement
The first author, UL, is self- identified as autistic. During 
the adaptation stage, the training manual for KONTAKT 
was  proofread  by  a  family  with  an  autistic  adolescent. 
To assess training burden and programme acceptability, 
participants  will  provide  feedback  through  a  combina-
tion of questionnaires and focus group interviews (mixed 
methods). Advocating for outcomes focused on well- being 
and mental health, autistic people continue to emphasise 
the  importance  of  listening  to  their  voices.  Thus,  this 
trial  will  also  capture  both  quantitative  and  qualitative 
data  examining  participants’  experiences  of  receiving 
KONTAKT  CHILD  and  the  impact  of  the  programme 
on  children’s  well- being.  We  will  further  engage  the 
autism  community,  involving  both  parents  with  autistic 
children  and  clinicians,  in  recruiting  potential  partici-
pants.  Finally,  participants  will  be  invited  to  share  their 

10

lived experiences of participating in KONTAKT with the 
autism community through community events and social 
media in China when the trial has ended.

DISCUSSION
The study commenced recruitment on 5 June 2023. This 
article  presents  the  design  of  the  Chinese  KONTAKT 
CHILD  trial,  a  feasibility  waitlist  RCT  featuring  the 
Chinese  16- session  KONTAKT  variant  for  autistic  chil-
dren.  This  design  incorporates  multiple  data  sources 
and  diverse  outcome  assessment  methods,  facilitating 
a  comprehensive  exploration  of  the  feasibility  of  this 
programme  from  different  perspectives.  Furthermore, 
a  systematic  cultural  adaptation  process  ensures  the 
suitability,  acceptability  and  comprehensiveness  of  the 
Chinese  KONTAKT  version.  Adhering  to  the  ICAF,  this 
study will guide the refinement of the Chinese KONTAKT 
version  and  future  larger  scale  evaluations,  addressing 
the  question  of  whether  SSGT  can  be  effectively  imple-
mented for Chinese school- age autistic children.

While  there  are  several  strengths  in  the  study  design 
mentioned  earlier,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge 
some  limitations.  First,  conducted  in  Guangzhou,  one 
of  China’s  most  advanced  cities,  the  study’s  single- site 
nature  may  limit  the  generalisability  of  the  findings  to 
other  clinical  settings  in  the  Chinese  Mainland,  espe-
cially  to  regions  with  more  limited  resources.  Addition-
ally, certain measures planned for use in the study, such 
as  the  CRSES  and  the  SCS- DAP,  may  have  uncertain 
psychometric properties due to the lack of Chinese popu-
lation data. However, this feasibility study aims to provide 
empirical  data  on  the  psychometrics  of  these  measures 
with Chinese autistic children. Another limitation is the 
absence  of  an  active  comparator,  as  the  waitlist  control 
could potentially overestimate treatment effects.88 Never-
theless, this aligns with the prevailing situation in China. 
Furthermore,  the  study  will  collect  data  on  parents  and 
children’s readiness for change, allowing for an explora-
tion of the ‘help- seeker’ effects, following the recommen-
dation by Cunningham and colleagues in 2013.88

As mentioned above, the final stage of the ICAF involves 
running  a  full- scale  RCT  trial  to  evaluate  the  efficacy 
of  the  Chinese  version  of  KONTAKT.  Therefore,  upon 
completing  this  feasibility  study,  the  investigators  will 
integrate all quantitative and qualitative results to decide 
whether a full- scale RCT trial will progress or redesigning 
another KONTAKT feasibility study will be needed. The 
following aspects will be considered: (1) participants and 
parents’  acceptability  and  adherence  rates,  (2)  partic-
ipants  and  parents’  feedback  on  demand  and  training 
burden for KONTAKT, (3) trainers’ feedback on imple-
menting  KONTAKT  in  Chinese  clinical  setting,  (4) 
trainers’  fidelity  on  implementing  KONTAKT,  (5)  the 
feasibility results of the processes for data collecting and 
(6) considering the potential capacity of the intervention 
setting (human resources, materials and equipment) on 

Lao U, et al. BMJ Open 2024;14:e081827. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-081827implementing a full- scale RCT regarding the sample size 
calculation for the primary outcome.

PLANS FOR DISSEMINATION OF FINDING
The findings of the Chinese KONTAKT CHILD trial will 
be submitted to peer- reviewed journals for consideration. 
Abstracts  will  also  be  submitted  to  both  local  and  inter-
national conferences, and community- based lay abstracts 
will be written and disseminated to provide feedback to 
autism stakeholders in China.
