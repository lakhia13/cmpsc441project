Abstract

IMPORTANCE—Sleep disturbances are most prevalent among older adults and often go 
untreated. Treatment options for sleep disturbances remain limited, and there is a need for 
community-accessible programs that can improve sleep.

OBJECTIVE—To determine the efficacy of a mind-body medicine intervention, called 
mindfulness meditation, to promote sleep quality in older adults with moderate sleep disturbances.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups 
conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2012, at a medical research center among an older 
adult sample (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [7.4] years) with moderate sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index [PSQI] >5).

INTERVENTIONS—A standardized mindful awareness practices (MAPs) intervention (n = 24) 
or a sleep hygiene education (SHE) intervention (n = 25) was randomized to participants, who 
received a 6-week intervention (2 hours per week) with assigned homework.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The study was powered to detect between-group 
differences in moderate sleep disturbance measured via the PSQI at postintervention. Secondary

outcomes pertained to sleep-related daytime impairment and included validated measures of 
insomnia symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and fatigue, as well as inflammatory signaling via 
nuclear factor (NF)–κB.

RESULTS—Using an intent-to-treat analysis, participants in the MAPs group showed significant 
improvement relative to those in the SHE group on the PSQI. With the MAPs intervention, the 
mean (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.7) at baseline and 7.4 (1.9) at postintervention. With the SHE 
intervention, the mean (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.8) at baseline and 9.1 (2.0) at postintervention. 
The between-group mean difference was 1.8 (95%CI, 0.6–2.9), with an effect size of 0.89. The 
MAPs group showed significant improvement relative to the SHE group on secondary health 
outcomes of insomnia symptoms, depression symptoms, fatigue interference, and fatigue severity 
(P < .05 for all). Between-group differences were not observed for anxiety, stress, or NF-κB, 
although NF-κB concentrations significantly declined over time in both groups (P < .05).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—The use of a community-accessible MAPs intervention 
resulted in improvements in sleep quality at immediate postintervention, which was superior to a 
highly structured SHE intervention. Formalized mindfulness-based interventions have clinical 
importance by possibly serving to remediate sleep problems among older adults in the short term, 
and this effect appears to carry over into reducing sleep-related daytime impairment that has 
implications for quality of life.

TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01534338

Sleep disturbances pose a significant medical and public health concern for our nation’s 
aging population. An estimated 50% of persons 55 years and older have some form of sleep 
problem, including initiating and maintaining sleep.1–5 Older adults report the highest 
prevalence of sleep problems compared with younger age groups when quantified by self-
report and by biological assessment.1,6,7 Moderate sleep disturbances in older adults are 
often associated with deficits in daytime functioning including elevated levels of fatigue; 
disturbed mood, such as depressive symptoms; and reduced quality of life and lead to the 
onset of clinical insomnia.1,4,8 Addressing moderate sleep disturbances and sleep-related 
daytime dysfunction using community-accessible programs is a promising public health 
approach.9

Despite the medical consequences of sleep problems, they often go untreated in older adults, 
especially among those with moderate sleep disturbances.10 However, when clinical 
insomnia is present, several treatment options are available. In-somniais often treated with 
pharmacotherapy.11 Although such treatments provide only temporary remediation of sleep 
disturbance for some persons, the benefits often diminish after drug discontinuation, and 
there is risk for residual daytime effects and dependency syndrome.12–14 Psychobehavioral 
therapies are also recognized nonpharmacological treatments for insomnia.15 One universal 
behavioral program is sleep hygiene education (SHE), which targets the modification of 
day-to-day behavioral and environmental factors that contribute to poor sleep.16 Of the 
standard clinical treatments, cognitive behavior therapy focuses on modulating sleep needs 
and correcting expectations, attitudes, and beliefs about sleep.14 These nonpharmacological 
treatments have advantages over pharmacotherapy in that they are somewhat effective at 
improving sleep for both short-term and long-term periods and have no serious

contraindications.12 However, clinical interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, are 
intensive, require administration by highly trained therapists, and are intended for patients 
with insomnia.17 Little is known about the efficacy of alternative behavioral treatments that 
might target moderate sleep disturbances in older adults, which have the potential to prevent 
insomnia and related consequences.

Limitations of current treatments for sleep problems highlight the need for scalable 
community-accessible treatments that can improve sleep in older adults with moderate sleep 
disturbances. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) hold the potential to possibly meet 
these needs. The MBIs consist of evidence-based programs for stress-related ailments18 that 
train one in the systematic practice of attending to moment-by-moment experiences, 
thoughts, and emotions from a nonjudgmental perspective.19 Evidence from previous 
studies20,21 provides preliminary yet mixed support for the use of MBIs for sleep 
disturbances in adults, and a review of research on MBIs for sleep problems highlighted a 
spectrum of research gaps.22 Mainly, sleep has been tested as a secondary outcome to a 
primary disease state that can affect sleep,23,24 so the findings are confounded by changes in 
the primary ailment. Other MBI experimental studies20,25 have focused on mixed-age 
populations diagnosed as having insomnia.

Previous research has shown that a movement-based meditation, called tai chi, can improve 
sleep quality in older adults.26,27 However, to our knowledge, there are no reports of the use 
of a nonmovement form of meditation for sleep problems in older adults to examine the 
effects of mental practice alone on improvements in sleep quality. Therefore, we conducted 
a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to examine the effect of a low-cost community-accessible 
MBI known as mindful awareness practices (MAPs) for daily living compared with a 
structured SHE program on moderate sleep disturbances in older adults. We hypothesized 
that MAPs relative to SHE would confer superior improvements in sleep quality. Sleep-
related daytime impairment and the peripheral blood inflammatory transcription factor 
nuclear factor (NF)–κB concentration were secondary outcomes. The NF-κB concentration 
was assessed given that sleep disturbance can induce an inflammatory response, which has 
implications for chronic disease risk in older adults.28–32 It has previously been shown that 
mind-body interventions in older adults can reduce or attenuate activation of NF-κB,33,34 
but the association of these changes with improvements in sleep is unknown.33

Methods

Trial Design and Randomization

This was a single-site, parallel-group RCT. The trial protocol appears in the Supplement. 
The randomization sequence was obtained via computerized random number generation 
before the start of the trial in blocks of 2 conditions (1:1 MAPs to SHE). The statistician 
(R.O.) who directed the randomization was provided with random identification numbers to 
assign to a condition, and he never interacted with participants before or after assignment to 
a condition. The project manager informed participants of start dates. Blocks of 12 
participants stratified by age, sex, and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) 
were used to ensure that randomized treatment groups were filled within 1½ months of 
screening. Individuals were the unit of randomization. The University of California,

Setting and Participants

Procedures

The study was conducted in LosAngeles from January 1 toDecember31, 2012. Older adults 
(≥55years)were recruited through an advertisement in the local newspaper and flyers posted 
at the UCLA medical research center, as well as at community centers located in 
LosAngeles. Inclusion criteria were age of at least 55 years, agreement to the randomization, 
and active sleep disturbance as indicated by a PSQI exceeding 5 at screening.35 Exclusion 
criteria were current smoking, substance dependence, inability to speak English, depression 
(Patient Health Questionnaire 9 score >14),36 cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State 
Examination score <23),37 significant current practice of any form of meditation 
(>15minutes per day), and obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared] >34.9). Also excluded were those who reported a 
current inflammatory disorder, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, illness, or infection (eg, 
autoimmune disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C, cancer, or acute infection in the 
past 2 weeks).

Participants who responded to the advertisement underwent 2 assessment phases before 
enrollment. The first phase was a 15-minute telephone interview by a trained data collector 
who evaluated eligibility. The second phase included an in-person visit. Trained data 
collectors then administered the Mini-Mental State Examination to rule out cognitive 
impairment. Participants were blinded to the randomization until the start of the 
intervention. Data collectors were unaware of group assignment at baseline assessment and 
were instructed to treat all participants in the same manner. Participants completed self-
report questionnaires by themselves in a private room to negate assessor effects on 
outcomes. Eight visits to the study site were requested, including 1pretreatment assessment 
visit, 6 intervention sessions, and 1 posttreatment assessment visit. Pretreatment and 
posttreatment visits included height and weight assessment, administration of 
questionnaires, and blood draw. Assessments were completed at the UCLA medical research 
center within 10 days before and after the intervention. Participants were compensated up to 
$50 (allocated as gift cards) and received parking vouchers for each visit.

Interventions

MAPs for Daily Living—The MAPs for daily living is a weekly 2-hour, 6-session group-
based course in mindfulness meditation that is available for residents to take in person 
within the Los Angeles area or to anyone online (http://marc.ucla.edu).Acertified teacher 
with more than 20 years of mindfulness practice delivered the formalized program 
curriculum to participants. Mindfulness exercises included mindful sitting meditation, 
mindful eating, appreciation meditation, friendly or loving-kindness meditation, mindful 
walking, and mindful movement. Participants engage in a mean of 10 to 30 minutes of 
mindful experiential practice in each class in addition to the teacher-delivered didactic 
material and group discussion. Participants are also provided with a book on mindfulness

accompanied by a guided meditation compact disc.38 Mindfulness practice homework began 
with 5minutes daily and then progressively advanced to 20 minutes daily by session 6.

SHE Program—The SHE program is a weekly 2-hour, 6-session group-based course in 
sleep hygiene and education developed by the lead author (D.S.B.) that matched the MAPs 
condition for time, attention, group interaction, and expectancy of benefit effects. The SHE 
program was selected as a highly active control group to account for nonspecific effects (eg, 
time, attention, teacher, and group support) and participant or staff expectancy of a benefit 
on sleep. A trained health educator who held an MPH degree in health education delivered 
the program curriculum to participants. Active components included knowledge of sleep 
biology, characteristics of healthy and unhealthy sleep, sleep problems, stress biology and 
stress reduction, self-monitoring of sleep behavior, relaxation methods for improving sleep, 
and weekly behavioral sleep hygiene strategies. The SHE educational and behavioral 
content is based on National Institutes of Health39 and National Sleep Foundation40 tips for 
better sleep (eg, changing poor sleep habits and establishing a bedtime routine). Homework 
included practicing sleep hygiene and weekly reading, with in class group discussion to 
match the homework assigned in the MAPs group.

Outcome and Assessments

Self-assessments were administered before and after the intervention, which comprised a 10-
week interval. The primary outcome measure was the PSQI,35 a widely used and validated 
19-item self-report questionnaire of sleep disturbances experienced over the past month. 
Cronbach α = .83 for the PSQI,35 and test-retest reliability41 is 0.87, with high sensitivity 
(99%) and specificity (84%)to identify sleep disturbances.42 Planned a priori, secondary 
outcomes were daytime impairment commonly related to sleep disruption and included the 
validated Athens Insomnia Scale,43 Beck Depression Inventory II,44 Beck Anxiety 
Inventory,45 Perceived Stress Scale,46 and Fatigue Symptom Inventory.47 A summed score 
of 9 items for the Fatigue Symptom Inventory–Interference (ie, the degree to which fatigue 
interfered with daily life in the past week, such as normal work activity and ability to 
concentrate) and 4 items for the Fatigue Symptom Inventory–Severity (ie, the severity of 
fatigue in the past week) was calculated, with lower scores indicating less fatigue. The Five 
Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire short form48 is a validated 24-item self-report of the 
tendency to be mindful in daily life, with a reference to the past 2 weeks. A mean score is 
calculated, with lower scores indicating less mindfulness. In the MAPs group, participants 
recorded time spent meditating in a daily log. Logs captured the total number of practice 
minutes and the number of unique meditation sessions during the intervention period.

Inflammatory Signaling

Inflammatory signaling via activated NF-κBin peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 
quantified after venipuncture between 8:30 and 11:30 AM.34 The mean NF-κB 
concentrations from triplicate determinations were expressed as nanograms of p65 per 
microgram of total protein using recombinant p65 (ActiveMotif) as the reference standard. 
The detectable range of the assay was 0.08 to 5.00 ng of NF-κB p65 per microgram of total 
protein. The NF-κB activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is a precursor to

increased concentrations of inflammatory markers in plasma, and sleep disruption increases 
NF-κB activation.49,50

Calculation

An a priori power analysis was conducted in G*Power (http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html). 
An estimated final total sample size of 42 was needed to detect a PSQI between-group effect 
(f = 0.2, or of medium size) of difference across time based on previous MBI trials at 
postintervention with 80% power,20 two-sided P < .05, two assessment points, and 0.60test-
retest reliability for the PSQI.41 A 10% attrition rate was anticipated, making our target 
enrollment 24 per group.

Statistical Analysis

Between-group change in the mean PSQI at postintervention was the primary outcome in the 
intent-to-treat population. Analyses were performed in SPSS, version 21 (IBM Corporation). 
Between-group contrasts in outcomes across the intervention period were tested using 
generalized linear mixed modeling (MIXED command with full information maximum 
likelihood estimation to allow for analysis of participants with missing data) with pairwise 
comparisons, adjusted for preintervention levels of the outcome. Estimated mean differences 
and effect sizes (Cohen d with Hedges bias correction for small sample size)with their 
95%CIs are provided. We assessed whether data provided evidence of a benefit of MAPs vs 
SHE on the PSQI and secondary daytime impairment and NF-κB signaling outcomes. 
Baseline PSQIs between those with vs without missing data at postintervention were 
compared using t tests.

Results

Participant Flow and Characteristics

Participant flow through enrollment, randomization, follow-up, and analysis phases of the 
trial is shown in Figure 1. After being screened for eligibility, 49 older adults were 
randomized to treatment (a 6-week intervention [2 hours per week]), and 43 of them 
attended treatment visits in the interval between March and December 2012. The mean 
(SD)session attendance was similar across the MAPs(4.2 [1.9]) and SHE(4.7 [1.5]) groups(t 
= 0.79, P = .31). In the MAPs group, the median meditation practice time across the 
intervention period was 17.2 hours (range, 3.7–65.3 hours),and the median number of 
unique practice sessions was 111 (range, 37–179).No adverse events related to participation 
in the study were reported.

Table 1 lists summary descriptive statistics for the study groups at baseline. None of the 
baseline variables differed across treatment groups by chance (P < .05 for all). At baseline, 
the mean(SD) age of participants was 66.3 (7.4 years), and 67% (33 of 49) were female. The 
mean (SD) PSQI of 10.2 (3.2) indicated a sample with moderate or greater sleep 
disturbances. The mean (SD) scores of 11.0 (9.1) on the BeckDepression Inventory II and 
13.7 (9.3) on the Beck Anxiety Inventory were consistent with a nonclinical sample based 
on mental health status.

As assessed with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, the mean (SD) level of 
mindfulness significantly increased in the MAPs group (3.4 [0.2] at baseline and 3.6 [0.2] at 
postintervention) but did not change in the SHE group (3.3 [0.3] at baseline and 3.4 [0.3] at 
postintervention) across the intervention period. The between-group mean difference was 
0.2 (95%CI, 0.1–0.3), with an effect size of 0.76 (P = .008), indicating that mindfulness 
levels changed only in the MAPs group, as intended. Forty-three participants (88%) 
completed the postintervention assessment. Those lost to follow- up showed PSQI baseline 
scores statistically equivalent to those of the retained sample, indicating that the level of 
sleep disruption was independent of dropout.

Primary Outcome

Primary and secondary outcome intent-to-treat analyses included all participants (N = 49) 
according to original group assignment regardless of program attendance or missing data. 
The PSQI of the MAPs group improved by a mean of 2.8 and of the SHE group by a mean 
of 1.1, indicating greater improvement in the MAPs group (between-group mean difference, 
1.8; 95%CI, 0.6–2.9) (Table 2 and Figure 2). The PSQI changes were correlated with Five 
Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire nonreactivity change scores in the MAPs group (r = −0.46, 
P = .04) but not in the SHE group (r = −0.03, P = .91). The same correlation pattern was 
replicated for Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire nonreactivity and the secondary sleep 
measure (Athens Insomnia Scale) (r = −0.53, P = .02 for the MAPs group and r = −0.23, P 
= .35 for the SHE group).

Secondary Outcomes

Daytime Impairment—Table 2 lists the summary results for the sleep-related daytime 
impairment outcomes. The Athens Insomnia Scale (P = .03), Fatigue Symptom Inventory–
Interference (P = .001 in Figure 3A), Fatigue Symptom Inventory–Severity (P < .001), and 
Beck Depression Inventory II (P = .02 in Figure 3B) scores in the MAPs group showed 
improvement relative to the SHE group at immediate posttreatment. Reductions in Beck 
Anxiety Inventory scores over time were significant (P < .05), but changes were equivalent 
between groups (P = .85).

Inflammatory Signaling—Significant mean reductions over time were statistically 
equivalent across treatment groups for NF-κB (P = .26). Although the reduction was slightly 
greater in the MAPs group, this difference was not significant (Table 2).

Discussion

This RCT examined the effect of a structured mindfulness meditation program on moderate 
sleep disturbances in older adults. Our main findings indicate that the program, which is 
available to the general community, resulted in improvement in sleep quality at 
postintervention relative to a highly active and standardized SHE program. The effect size of 
0.89 for improvement in sleep quality was large and of clinical relevance considering that 
effect sizes obtained from all types of behavioral interventions on self-reported sleep quality 
outcomes averaged 0.76 among older adults.51 Meta-analyses13,52 comparing treatment 
modalities indicate that the mean effect sizes for self-reported sleep improvements resulting

from pharmacotherapy (effect size, 0.87) (ie, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor 
agonists) and cognitive behavior therapy (effect size, 0.96) are of medium to large 
magnitude in mixed-age adult samples with primary insomnia. Therefore, our observed 
changes are consistent with previous findings and are at the level of a minimally important 
difference for insomnia severity.53 The MAPs for daily living also yielded relative 
improvements in sleep-related daytime impairment of depression and fatigue that were of 
medium to large effect size. According to our findings, mindfulness meditation appears to 
have a role in addressing the prevalent burden of sleep problems among older adults1–5 by 
remediating their moderate sleep disturbances and deficits in daytime functioning, with 
short-term effect sizes commensurate with the status quo of clinical treatment approaches 
for sleep problems.13,52

Mindfulness meditation is believed to function on arousal and neurocognitive processes that 
mediate the relationship between perception of stimuli and appraisal. Structural and 
functional brain changes support the role of mindfulness meditation in modulating these two 
processes.54,55 Froma cognitive behavior perspective, sleep problems stem from automatic 
arousal, dysfunctional cognitions, and consequential distress.56 Previous studies indicate that 
mindfulness meditation can attenuate such automatic responses and increase the relaxation 
response through its function of increasing attentional factors that impart control over the 
autonomic nervous system,57 reduce worry and rumination,58,59 and alleviate mood 
disturbances.18,60 The potential mechanisms of our MBI based mindfulness meditation 
include cognitive behavior and intrapsychic processes that influence arousal and reactivity in 
a manner that improves sleep, daytime functioning, or perceptions of sleep and wakefulness.

A previous RCT20 showed that a MBI outperformed a Food and Drug Administration–
approved sleep aid on the PSQI in persons with primary insomnia at postintervention (mean 
difference, 1.69).We extend this work by using a larger RCT with a nonpharmacological 
comparison condition adequately controlled for time, attention, social support, and other 
nonspecific effects. In our older adult sample with moderate sleep disturbances, we observed 
a similar effect size on PSQIs at postintervention in a population with subsyndromal 
insomnia. Our study also differed because we found relative improvements in depression 
score with the Beck Depression Inventory II in older adults, while previous work found no 
changes in depression score.20 We further extend the literature by showing relative 
improvements in daytime fatigue.

Strengths of our study include that it is the first RCT to date to examine the effect of an MBI 
on sleep disturbances and solely among older adults. Enrollment of older adults has a large 
potential health impact because this population reports among the highest prevalence of 
sleep problems. The validated measures used are reproducible in future work and are 
correlated with sleep diary reports, insomnia diagnosis, and actigraphy readings.61,62 MAPs 
is a fully developed community-offered program, and our SHE program can be viewed as a 
highly active psychoeducational program. Evaluation of NF-κB concentration was a novel 
method to explore an immune signal that is responsive to sleep disruption. Reductions in 
NF-κB concentrations after meditation corroborate the results from previous studies with 
older adults.33,34 The SHE program also reduced NF-κB concentrations over time,

suggesting that this approach to addressing moderate sleep disturbances might also confer 
some anti-inflammatory benefit, but future trials are needed to elucidate this potential.

Our study has some potential limitations. Despite rigorous efforts to obtain data from all 
enrollees, 12% (6 of 49) did not complete the postintervention assessment. An intent-to-treat 
approach was used to obtain pragmatic estimates for the groups as originally randomized to 
conditions. The preponderance of female participants (67%[33 of 49]) and those with a 
higher educational level might constrain the external validity of our findings; however, the 
prevalence of sleep disturbances is highest among women,63 and the findings herein need to 
be replicated for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity. The results are limited to older 
adults with normal cognitive abilities. Our focus on adults with moderate sleep disturbances 
does not lend itself to primary and tertiary levels of care. Studies need to examine whether 
MBIs are effective for preventing future sleep problems in older adult healthy sleepers and 
for treating older adults diagnosed as having insomnia. Objective measures (eg, actigraphy) 
were omitted because of funding constraints, and future studies should add objective 
protocols.

Conclusions

The findings from our study suggest that mindfulness meditation may be introduced to older 
adults as a short-term solution to remediate their moderate sleep disturbances, although 
research is needed to determine possible longer-term effects on sleep. Given that 
standardized mindfulness programs are readily delivered in many communities, 
dissemination efforts do not serve as a barrier in this instance. Therefore, older adults often 
have immediate access to these programs, which are offered at low cost. Pending future 
replication of these findings, structured mindfulness meditation training appears to have at 
least some clinical usefulness to remediate moderate sleep problems and sleep-related 
daytime impairment in older adults
