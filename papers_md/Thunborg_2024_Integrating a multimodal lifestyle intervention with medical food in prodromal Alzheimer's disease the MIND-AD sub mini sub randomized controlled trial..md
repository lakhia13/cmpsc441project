Abstract 
Background  The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) 
showed cognitive benefits from a multidomain lifestyle intervention in at‑risk older people. The LipiDiDiet trial high‑
lighted benefits of medical food in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the feasibility and impact of multi‑
modal interventions combining lifestyle with medical food in prodromal AD is unclear.
Methods  MIND‑ADmini was a 6‑month multinational (Sweden, Finland, Germany, France) proof‑of‑concept rand‑
omized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were 60–85 years old, had prodromal AD (International Working Group‑1 
criteria), and vascular/lifestyle risk factors. The parallel‑group RCT had three arms: multimodal lifestyle intervention 
(nutritional guidance, exercise, cognitive training, vascular/metabolic risk management and social stimulation); multi‑
modal lifestyle intervention + medical food (Fortasyn Connect); and regular health advice/care (control). Participants 
were randomized 1:1:1 (computer‑generated allocation at each site). Outcome evaluators were blinded to randomiza‑
tion. Primary outcome was feasibility of the multimodal intervention, evaluated by recruitment rate during a 6‑month 
recruitment phase, overall adherence in each intervention arm, and 6‑month retention rate. Successful adherence 
was pre‑specified as attending ≥ 40% of sessions/domain in ≥ 2/4 domains (lifestyle intervention), and consum‑
ing ≥ 60% of the medical food (lifestyle intervention + medical food). The secondary outcomes included adherence/
participation to each intervention component and overall adherence to healthy lifestyle changes, measured using 
a composite score for healthy lifestyle. Cognitive assessments were included as exploratory outcomes, e.g. Clinical 
Dementia Rating scale.

Results  During September 2017‑May 2019, 93 individuals were randomized (32 lifestyle intervention, 31 life‑
style + medical food, and 30 control group). Overall recruitment rate was 76.2% (64.8% during the first 6 months). 
Overall 6‑month retention rate was 91.4% (lifestyle intervention 87.5%; lifestyle + medical food 90.3%; control 96.7%). 
Domain‑specific adherence in the lifestyle intervention group was 71.9% to cognitive training, 78.1% exercise, 68.8% 
nutritional guidance, and 81.3% vascular risk management; and in the lifestyle + medical food group, 90.3% to cogni‑
tive training, 87.1% exercise, 80.7% nutritional guidance, 87.1% vascular risk management, and 87.1% medical food. 
Compared with control, both intervention arms showed healthy diet improvements (βLifestyle×Time = 1.11, P = 0.038; 
βLifestyle+medical food×Time = 1.43, P = 0.007); the lifestyle + medical food group also showed vascular risk reduction 
(P = 0.043) and less cognitive‑functional decline (P < 0.05, exploratory analysis). There were 5 serious adverse events 
(control group: 1; lifestyle intervention: 3; lifestyle + medical food: 1) unrelated to interventions.

Conclusions  The multidomain lifestyle intervention, alone or combined with medical food, had good feasibility 
and adherence in prodromal AD. Longer‑term cognitive and other health benefits should be further investigated 
in a larger‑scale trial.

Background
Preventive  interventions  for  dementia  and  Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) are a key priority [1]. AD includes preclini-
cal, prodromal, and dementia stages [2, 3]. Preclinical AD 
is largely asymptomatic, while prodromal AD comprises 
mild  cognitive  impairment  and  amyloidopathy-related 
biomarkers  [3].  To  ensure  optimal  effects,  clinical  trials 
are increasingly focusing on prodromal AD [4–6], includ-
ing  multimodal  non-pharmacological  intervention  trials 
targeting  multiple  risk  factors  and  disease  mechanisms 
simultaneously  [7,  8].  Nutritional  approaches  have  been 
highlighted  in  this  stage,  e.g.  the  medical  food  Fortasyn 
Connect  in  the  LipiDiDiet  trial  [9].  LipiDiDiet  findings 
indicated  that  medical  food  can  benefit  patients  with 
prodromal AD by slowing down cognitive and functional 
decline,  brain  atrophy,  and  disease  progression  [9,  10]. 
Earlier-stage  interventions  in  at-risk  older  adults  have 
also reported cognitive and other health-related benefits, 
e.g.  a  2-year  multidomain  lifestyle  intervention  (diet, 
exercise, cognitive training, social activities, and vascular 
risk monitoring) tested in the Finnish Geriatric Interven-
tion  Study  to  Prevent  Cognitive  Impairment  and  Dis-
ability (FINGER) [11–14]. As prodromal AD is a critical 
stage for intervention, a multimodal approach combining 
multidomain lifestyle intervention and medical food may 
have joint effects and further improve benefits. Neverthe-
less, the feasibility and impact of complex lifestyle inter-
ventions,  alone  or  in  combination  with  medical  food,  is 
unclear among patients with prodromal AD.

The  MIND-ADmini  trial  was  designed  with  the  pri-
mary  objective  of  testing  the  feasibility  of  a  multimodal 
intervention  (adapted  FINGER-based  lifestyle  interven-
tion,  with  or  without  medical  food)  in  prodromal  AD 
[15]. Secondary outcomes included adherence to specific 

intervention domains (in the 2 intervention groups) and 
adherence to healthy lifestyle changes. Additional analy-
ses were performed to investigate intervention effects on 
cognitive-functional measures.

Methods
Study design and participants
The MIND-ADmini trial was a 6-month proof-of-concept 
multicentre,  randomized  controlled  parallel-group  trial 
(three arms). A detailed trial protocol has been published 
previously  [15].  Participants  were  recruited  from  mem-
ory clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, and Toulouse, France, 
via  advertisement  in  Frankfurt  Germany,  and  from  the 
university hospital neurology clinic and previous research 
cohorts in Kuopio, Finland. Pre-screening was performed 
for  some  of  the  inclusion  criteria  where  information 
was  available.  Inclusion  criteria  were:  age  60–85  years; 
Mini-Mental  State  Examination  (MMSE) ≥ 24  points; 
availability  of  a  study  partner;  prodromal  AD  accord-
ing  to  International  Working  Group-1  (IWG-1)  criteria 
including  episodic  memory  impairment  and  underlying 
AD  pathology  [2,  16];  and  an  index  indicating  potential 
for  lifestyle  improvement.  We  defined  episodic  memory 
impairment as -1 SD on at least 2 out of 8 tests, at least 
1 being a memory test: Free and Cued Selective Remind-
ing  Test  (FCSRT)  delayed  free  recall ≤ 8,  FCSRT  free 
recall-learning ≤ 22,  Wechsler  Memory  Scale-revised 
(WMS-R)  story  delayed  recall ≤ 75%,  WMS-R  delayed 
recall  figures ≤ 75%,  Trail  Making  Test  (TMT)  A ≥ 60  s, 
TMT-B ≥ 60 s, symbol digit substitution test ≥ 35 (120 s), 
category  fluency ≤ 16  (60  s).  AD  pathology  was  defined 
as  having ≥ 1  abnormal  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF,  CSF 
β-amyloid  (1–42/1–40) × 10  ratio < 1  and/or  total-tau 
and/or phospho-tau and/or β-amyloid 42 based on local

cut-offs)  or  neuroimaging  biomarker  (Scheltens  medial 
temporal  lobe  atrophy  score  of  at  least  1and/or  abnor-
mal  FDG-PET  and/or  PiB-PET  compatible  with  AD 
type  changes)  [15].  A  score  of  2  or  above  was  addition-
ally required on a lifestyle index based on physical inac-
tivity,  unhealthy  dietary  habits,  hypertension,  diabetes, 
sleep  disturbances,  depressive  symptoms  or  psychologi-
cal stress symptoms [15].

Exclusion  criteria  were:  dementia  diagnosis;  condi-
tions  affecting  safe  intervention  engagement  (e.g.,  exer-
cise);  concomitant  severe  diseases  (e.g.,  recent  history 
of  myocardial  infarction  or  cancer);  major  depressive 
disorder;  MRI/CT  scan  indicating  stroke,  intracranial 
bleeding, mass lesion or normal pressure hydrocephalus; 
intake of vitamin B6, B12, folic acid, vitamin C and/or E 
supplements > 200%  recommended  daily  intake  unless 
prescribed  by  a  physician;  use  of  omega-3  preparations 
(> 500  mg  EPA + DHA  per  day);  alcohol  or  drug  abuse; 
severe loss of vision or communicative ability; conditions 
preventing cooperation as judged by the study physician; 
and concomitant participation in any intervention trial.

Randomization and masking

Participants  were  randomized  to  lifestyle  intervention, 
lifestyle  intervention + medical  food,  or  control  group 
receiving regular health advice in 1:1:1 ratio in blocks of 
six  (computer  generated  allocation,  two  individuals  ran-
domly  allocated  to  each  group)  at  each  of  the  four  sites 
after  screening  by  the  study  nurse.  Outcome  evaluators 
were  blinded  to  the  randomization  group  and  were  not 
involved in intervention activities. Similar to the FINGER 
trial,  group  allocation  was  not  actively  disclosed  to  par-
ticipants, and participants were instructed not to discuss 
the intervention with outcome evaluators.

Intervention

The control group received regular health advice. All par-
ticipants met the study nurse at screening, baseline, and 
6  months  after  randomisation  for  health  measurements 
(e.g., blood pressure, weight and BMI, and hip and waist 
circumference).  All  participants  met  the  study  physi-
cian  at  screening  and  6-month  visits  for  detailed  medi-
cal  history  and  physical  examination.  At  baseline,  the 
study  nurse  gave  all  participants  (control  and  interven-
tion groups) oral and written information and advice on 
healthy  diet  and  physical,  cognitive,  and  social  activities 
that  are  beneficial  for  management  of  vascular  risk  fac-
tors and disability prevention. In the case of clinically rel-
evant abnormal blood tests (samples collected at baseline 
and 6-months), participants were provided with informa-
tion and advice to contact primary health care or a refer-
ral to primary health care. All participants had a chance 

to  contact  the  study  nurse  by  telephone  or  e-mail  when 
needed.

The  multimodal  lifestyle  intervention  group  received 
a  FINGER-based  intervention  program  adapted  for 
individuals  with  prodromal  AD  [15].  Intervention  dura-
tion  was  6  months.  Stepwise  introduction  of  interven-
tion  domains  was  used  to  promote  adherence.  Diet  and 
physical activity started during the first month, cognitive 
training started during the second month following ran-
domization.  Given  that  intervention  domains  had  both 
individual  and  group  sessions,  there  could  be  a  delay  of 
up  to  1–2  months  before  all  domains  were  introduced. 
Intervention  sessions  and  schedule  were  aligned  among 
study centers to ensure similar intervention content and 
intensity for all participants, while leaving room for some 
local  adaptations  and  flexibility  [15].  Interventions  were 
delivered  in  university  facilities  (Germany),  and  univer-
sity hospital and private commercial gym facilities (Swe-
den, Finland, and France).

The  FINGER-based  lifestyle  intervention  combined 
five domains. Nutritional guidance, following the Nordic 
Nutrition  Recommendations  (NNR)  2012  or  adapted  to 
the  country’s  nutritional  recommendations  (France  and 
Germany)  [17],  was  provided  by  a  registered  dietitian/
nutritionist  through  3  individual  counselling  sessions 
and  3–4  group  sessions.  The  physical  exercise  training 
program,  supervised  by  a  physiotherapist  or  personal 
trainer,  was  tailored  to  each  participant’s  fitness  level 
and  included  cardiovascular  endurance  and  progressive 
strength  training  [15,  18–20],  Training  sessions  were 
conducted  twice/week  (60  min/session)  with  groups  of 
4–5  participants.  Cognitive  training  included  group  and 
individual sessions. The 2–3 group sessions (60–75 min/
session), led by psychologists or occupational therapists, 
included  general  information  about  neurocognitive  dis-
orders,  coping  and  reasoning  strategies,  introducing  the 
cognitive training program and instructing its use. Indi-
vidual  training  sessions  consisted  of  computer-based 
training  at  home  or  study  site  (twice/week,  15–30  min/
session).  The  cognitive  training  program  was  a  web-
based,  in-house  developed  computer  program  including 
several  tasks  adapted  from  protocols  previously  used  in 
the  FINGER  trial  [11,  15].  Social  activities  were  stimu-
lated  through  group  sessions  within  the  intervention 
domains  (exercise,  nutrition,  and  cognitive  training), 
designed  to  facilitate  open  discussions  and  interactions 
among  participants.  Monitoring  and  management  of 
vascular/metabolic  risk  factors,  following  national  evi-
dence-based  guidelines,  comprised  one  additional  study 
nurse  visit  at  3  months,  for  blood  pressure,  weight  and 
BMI,  hip  and  waist  circumference  measurements,  and 
further  recommendations  for 
lifestyle  management, 
including  smoking  cessation.  If  medication  initiation

or  adjustments  were  needed,  the  study  physician  either 
wrote a prescription or referred the participant to regular 
healthcare, as per local procedures.

The  multimodal  lifestyle + medical  food  intervention 
group  received  all  lifestyle  intervention  domains  men-
tioned  above,  plus  the  study  product  Fortasyn  Connect 
(Souvenaid™),  a  125  ml  once-a-day  milk-based  drink 
including  a  complex  nutrient  combination  (long-chain 
omega-3  fatty  acids  docosahexaenoic  acid  (DHA)  and 
eicosapentaenoic  acid  (EPA),  uridine  monophosphate, 
choline, vitamins B12, B6, C, E, and folic acid, phospho-
lipids,  and  selenium)  designed  to  enhance  efficacy  over 
what  can  be  achieved  by  individual  nutrients.  Danone 
Nutricia  Research  provided  this  study  product  for  the 
MIND-ADmini trial.

Outcome measures

The  primary  outcome  was  feasibility  of  the  multimodal 
intervention  measured  by  recruitment  rate,  reten-
tion  rate,  and  overall  intervention  adherence  (in  the  2 
intervention  arms).  Recruitment  rate  was  calculated  by 
dividing  the  number  of  randomised  participants  by  the 
number  of  potentially  eligible  participants  who  were 
invited  to  participate  during  a  6-month  recruitment 
phase.  Due  to  study  sites  having  different  start  dates, 
recruitment  rate  was  calculated  considering  the  initial 
6-month period at each site. A recruitment rate of ≥ 50% 
was  pre-specified  as  successful  [15].  Retention  rate  was 
calculated  as  the  proportions  of  participants  who  com-
pleted  the  6-month  trial  period.  A  successful  retention 
rate  was  pre-specified  as ≤ 35%  of  participants  dropping 
out.  Overall  intervention  adherence  was  calculated  in 
the  2  intervention  arms  (multimodal  lifestyle ± medical 
food)  as  a  composite  measure  of  participation  in  differ-
ent  intervention  domains.  The  number  of  attended  ses-
sions was divided by the total number of sessions offered 
to  the  participants.  Successful  adherence  to  the  lifestyle 
intervention was pre-specified as attending ≥ 40% of ses-
sions/domain in at least 2/4 domains (exercise, nutrition, 
cognitive  training  and  monitoring  and  management  of 
vascular/metabolic  risk  factors);  for  the  lifestyle + medi-
cal food arm, consuming ≥ 60% of the medical food study 
product was additionally required.

The  secondary  outcomes  included  adherence  to  spe-
cific intervention domains (in the 2 intervention groups), 
and  adherence  to  healthy  lifestyle  changes  (all  partici-
pants).  Adherence  to  specific  intervention  domains  was 
computed as follows: Nutrition adherence was defined as 
attending at least 2 out of 3 of the group sessions, and 2 
out  of  3  of  the  face-to-face  dietary  counselling  sessions. 
Exercise adherence was defined as  attendance  in at least 
40% of the twice per week offered group-based gym ses-
sions.  Cognitive  training  adherence  was  determined 

by  attendance  in  at  least  2  out  of  the  3  group  sessions, 
and  automatic  recordings  of  computer  program  use, 
i.e.,  number  of  completed  training  blocks  divided  by  48 
(maximum  offered  number).  Adherence  to  monitoring 
and  management  of  vascular/metabolic  risk  factors  was 
defined  as  attending  3-  and  6-month  meetings  with  the 
study  nurse  for  cardiovascular  health  measurements. 
Medical food adherence was defined as consuming ≥ 60% 
of the medical food product based on diary information, 
i.e.,  bottles  consumed  divided  by  bottles  delivered  for 
each participant.

Adherence to Specific healthy lifestyle changes was cal-
culated  in  all  trial  participants  based  on  four  domains: 
healthy  dietary  intake,  physical  activity,  cognitive  and 
social  activities  (considered  as  a  single  domain),  and 
cardiovascular  risk  burden,  measured  at  baseline  and 
month  6.  Healthy  dietary  intake  was  based  on  a  modi-
fied  Mediterranean  Diet  Adherence  Screener  (MEDAS) 
score  calculated  from  the  food  frequency  questionnaire, 
with  a  higher  score  indicating  a  healthier  dietary  intake 
[21]. Physical activity was measured actigraph-measured 
percentage  of  daily  time  spent  on  moderate  to  vigorous 
physical activity (ActiGraph GT3X, Pensacola, FL, USA); 
for 28 participants with missing actigraph data, the Swed-
ish  National  Board  of  Health  and  Welfare  self-reported 
physical  activity  questionnaire  was  used  instead.  Cogni-
tive and social activities were quantified as self-reported 
engagement in different types of cognitive (i.e. studying, 
writing, crossword puzzles, hand crafts, course participa-
tion)  and  social  activities  (i.e.  volunteering,  engagement 
in a club/association, taking care of children, playing card 
and board games) [12]. Engagement in each activity was 
rated using a 7-point Likert scale of frequencies ranging 
from a daily to never, with higher score indicating more 
engagement.  Overall  cardiovascular  risk  burden  was 
measured  using  the  FINRISK  score  including  age,  sex, 
serum total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, HDL-C, 
smoking  status,  and  diabetes,  with  a  higher  score  indi-
cating higher cardiovascular risk [22]. Each participant’s 
overall cardiovascular risk score was divided by the over-
all cardiovascular risk score calculated for a sex and age-
matched person without any cardiovascular risk factors, 
as  previously  defined  [22].  Overall  adherence  to  healthy 
lifestyle  changes  was  calculated  as  a  composite  healthy 
lifestyle  score,  based  on  the  specific  healthy  lifestyle 
changes,  in  all  trial  participants  at  baseline  and  month 
6, by adapting a method previously used in the FINGER 
trial [23]. A score from 0 to 2 (with higher score indicat-
ing healthier lifestyle) was assigned to each tertile of the 
healthy  dietary  intake  score,  physical  activity  level,  cog-
nitive  and  social  activities  (lowest  tertile = 0,  middle = 1, 
highest = 2),  and  cardiovascular  risk  burden  (lowest  ter-
tile = 2,  middle = 1,  highest = 0).  The  composite  healthy 

Thunborg et al. Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy          (2024) 16:118 

Page 5 of 12

lifestyle score was calculated as the sum of tertile scores 
in all four domains (ranges from 0 to 8).

Exploratory assessments

The  Clinical  Dementia  Rating  Scale  (CDR)  was  used 
to  evaluate  cognitive-functional  level  at  baseline  and 
6  months  [24,  25].  The  CDR-Sum  of  Boxes  (SOB)  score 
was calculated by summing the scores from each domain. 
An increased score on the CDR-SOB or global CDR score 
indicates more severe cognitive impairment. The range of 
the CRD score is 0–3 points, and the range of the CDR-
SOB score is 0–18 points.

Statistical analysis

Because primary outcome measures focused on feasibil-
ity, formal sample size calculations were not performed. 
Analyses  included  all  randomized  participants,  except 
for adherence to intervention measures which were lim-
ited to all participants randomized to the 2 intervention 
arms.  Baseline  characteristics  were  compared  between 
trial arms using chi-square test (categorical variables) or 
one-way analysis of variance/Kruskal–Wallis test (contin-
uous variables). Recruitment, retention and intervention 
adherence rates are reported using descriptive statistics. 
Differences from baseline to month 6 between trial arms 
regarding  adherence  to  healthy  lifestyle  changes  (overall 
and  per  domain)  were  investigated  using  linear  mixed-
effects  models.  This  analysis  adjusted  for  the  cluster 
effect  by  capturing  the  correlation  among  participants 
within each site and accounting for individual variations 

within  clusters  and  groups.  We  report  estimates  and 
95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  for  two-way  interactions 
between randomization arms (control, lifestyle, and life-
style + medical  food)  and  time  (baseline  vs.  month  6)  in 
the linear mixed-effect models.

To  evaluate  differences  between  intervention  arms 
(lifestyle or lifestyle + medical food) and the control arm 
in  changes  in  the  CDR-SOB  and  global  CDR  scores,  we 
applied  the  generalized  estimating  equations  with  an 
ordinal  logit  model,  with  a  robust  variance  estimator 
(cluster  by  each  participant).  We  considered  the  CDR-
SOB and global CDR scores as “ordinal” outcome meas-
ures  because  their  mutually  exclusive  categories  can  be 
ordered  by  severity  of  cognitive-functional  symptoms 
[26]. We estimated odds ratio (ORs) and 95% CI of two-
way  interactions  between  randomization  arms  (control, 
lifestyle,  and  lifestyle + medical  food)  and  time  (baseline 
v.s. 6 month) in the models.

All  statistical  analyses  were  performed  in  STATA  17.0 
software by an independent statistician who was blinded 
to randomization.

Results
The  trial  CONSORT  flowchart  is  shown  in  Fig.  1. 
Recruitment  occurred  during  different  time  periods  at 
the  four  sites:  October  2017  to  April  2018  in  Sweden, 
November 2017 to May 2018 in Finland, March 2018 to 
July  2018  in  Germany,  and  March  2018  to  May  2019  in 
France.  One-hundred  thirty-four  potential  participants 
were  pre-screened  and  122  were  assessed  for  eligibility

and 93 of them were assigned to different group (lifestyle 
intervention,  lifestyle  intervention + medical  food,  and 
control). Overall recruitment rate was 76.2% (64.8% dur-
ing  the  initial  6-month  recruitment  phase).  Eight  (8.6%) 
participants dropped out (Fig. 1). Eighty-five participants 
(lifestyle intervention n = 28; lifestyle intervention + med-
ical food; n = 28, or control; n = 29) completed the inter-
ventions. Overall retention rate was 91.4% (87.5% in the 
lifestyle intervention arm, 90.3% in the lifestyle + medical 
food intervention arm, and 96.7% in the control arm).

The  3  randomization  arms  were  similar  at  baseline 
(Table 1). Population mean age (SD) was 72.9 (6.2) years, 

50  participants  (53.7%)  were  women,  mean  education 
(SD)  was  12.8  (3.6)  years,  and  mean  MMSE  (SD)  27.7 
(1.6) points.

Overall  adherence  to  the  intervention  and  adherence 
to  each  intervention  domain  are  shown  in  Table  2.  In 
the  lifestyle  intervention  arm,  78.1%  adhered  to  at  least 
2  out  of  4  intervention  domains,  with  domain-specific

The different intervention domains were introduced gradually to avoid over-burdening participants. To stimulate the social component, the group sessions did not 
start until enough participants (4–5) were randomized to form a small group, i.e. there could be a delay of up to 1–2 months from baseline until the start of group 
sessions
a Calculated based on the number of sessions offered to each participant. During the 6-month trial, the amount of offered sessions could differ slightly due to public 
holidays and vacations
b In total 5 participants had missing data (automatic recordings)

87.1% for physical exercise, 90.3% for cognitive training, 
87.1% for vascular care, and 87.1% for medical food.

Adherence  to  healthy  lifestyle  changes  from  baseline 
to  month  6  in  all  randomized  participants  is  shown  in 
Fig.  2.  Healthy  dietary  intake  increased  significantly  in 
both the lifestyle intervention and the lifestyle + medical 
food  arms  compared  with  control.  The  estimated  mean 
difference  (95%  CI)  in  MEDAS  score  change  was  1.11 
(0.06–2.15)  for  the  lifestyle  intervention  versus  control 
arm, and 1.43 (0.39–2.48) for the lifestyle + medical food 
versus  control  arm.  The  overall  cardiovascular  risk  bur-
den decreased significantly in the lifestyle + medical food 
intervention  arm  compared  with  control,  with  an  esti-
mated mean difference (95% CI) of -0.24 (-0.48 to -0.01) 
in  FINRISK  score  change.  The  FINRISK  score  changes 
was not significantly different between the lifestyle inter-
vention and control arms. There were no statistically sig-
nificant differences between either intervention arm and 
control concerning change in time spent daily on moder-
ate-to-vigorous physical activity, engagement in cognitive 
and  social  activities,  or  the  composite  healthy  lifestyle 
score (Fig. 2).

The  likelihood  of  cognitive-functional  decline  (change 
in  global  CDR  score  and  CDR-SOB)  from  baseline  to 
month  6  are  shown  in  Table  3.  Overall,  cognitive-func-
tional  level  decreased  during  6  months  across  all  arms, 
with  OR  (95%  CI)  3.19  (1.94–5.26)  for  an  increase  in 
CDR-SOB score. The lifestyle + medical food intervention 

arm  had  a  significantly  lower  likelihood  for  decreas-
ing  cognitive-functional  level  (i.e.  increasing  CDR-SOB) 
compared with control, with OR (95%) 0.44 (0.21–0.92). 
The  change  in  CDR-SOB  was  not  significantly  differ-
ent  between  the  lifestyle  intervention  and  control  arms. 
There were no statistically significant differences between 
either intervention arm or control concerning change in 
global CDR score.

A  summary  of  adverse  events  in  all  randomized  par-
ticipants  is  shown  in  Table  4.  The  incidence  of  adverse 
events was highest in the control arm (81.3%), and low-
est  in  the  lifestyle  intervention  arm  (45.2%).  The  most 
common  adverse  events  (reported  by  at  least  5  partici-
pants) were musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and respira-
tory symptoms. Only 5 participants experienced serious 
adverse  events:  3  in  the  lifestyle  intervention  arm,  lead-
ing to discontinuation (one with spinal stenosis, one with 
stroke, and one with nasal polyps surgery); 1 in the life-
style + medical  food  arm  (stroke);  and  1  in  the  control 
arm (urinary tract infection). None of the serious adverse 
events were regarded as related to any of the intervention 
components.  No  participants  died  during  the  6-month 
trial period.

Discussion
This study tested the feasibility of a 6-month multimodal 
intervention  (adapted  FINGER-based 
inter-
vention,  with  or  without  medical  food)  in  older  adults

Data show number of participants / number of events. Some participants reported more than one event. (Serious) adverse events are presented by Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities preferred term. Adverse events were recorded at the 6-month visit in all participants, and also the 3-month visit in the two intervention arms. 
Participants were also asked if they had experienced any harm related to the study, such as stress or musculoskeletal pain

burden,  and  lower  likelihood  of  cognitive-functional 
decline.  The  lifestyle  intervention  arm  had  significantly 
more improvement in healthy dietary intake, but was not 
different from the control arm regarding change in other 
lifestyle or cognitive-functional measures.

Finding  effective  and  feasible  interventions  for  indi-
viduals  with  prodromal  AD  is  crucial  as  effective  dis-
ease-modifying  drugs  are  not  yet  widely  available  [2, 
27].  In  addition,  many  memory  clinic  patients  with 
mild  cognitive  impairment  will  likely  not  be  eligible 
for  new  anti-amyloid  drugs  [28].  Complex  multimodal 
lifestyle  interventions  have  shown  benefit  in  older  at-
risk  individuals  without  substantial  impairment  [7, 

11].  This  study  shows  that  complex  multimodal  inter-
ventions  are  feasible,  and  may  have  lifestyle-related 
and possibly cognitive-functional benefits also in older 
adults who already have cognitive impairment. Adding 
a medical food component to the multidomain lifestyle 
intervention  can  be  particularly  important  in  prodro-
mal  AD  [15].  While  nutritional  status  is  important  for 
healthy  brain  aging  and  dementia  risk  reduction  [29], 
dietary guidance may not be sufficient for patients with 
prodromal  AD,  who  are  frequently  deficient  in  essen-
tial  nutrients  [30].  The  lifestyle + medical  food  combi-
nation  is  also  highly  relevant  as  a  step  towards  future 
intervention  trials  combining  pharmacological  and 

 Thunborg et al. Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy          (2024) 16:118

non-pharmacological  interventions  in  prodromal  AD 
[15].

The  6-month  dropout  rates  were  13%  in  the  life-
style  arm  and < 4%  in  the  lifestyle + medical  food  arm  in 
patients  with  prodromal  AD.  In  comparison,  drop-out 
rates  were  21%  in  the  LipiDiDiet  trial  (2-year  medical 
food intervention, prodromal AD) [10], 12% in the FIN-
GER  trial  (2-year  multidomain  lifestyle  intervention,  at-
risk  older  adults  without  substantial  impairment)  [13], 
and  22.5%  in  the  MAPT  trial  (3-year  multidomain  life-
style intervention, frail older general population) [31].

Previously  reported  domain-specific  adherence  rates 
for  multidomain  lifestyle  interventions  ranged  from 
47.2%  to  92.9%  in  the  FINGER  trial,  and  from  53.5%  to 
71.5% in the MAPT trial [31]. In the MIND-ADmini trial, 
overall intervention adherence was 78.1% for the lifestyle 
arm, and 87.1% for the lifestyle + medical food arm, with 
domain-specific  intervention  adherence  rates  ranging 
from  68.8%  to  90.3%.  The  adherence  rate  to  the  medi-
cal food intervention component was 87%, similar to the 
93.4%  adherence  reported  in  the  LipiDiDiet  trial  [10]. 
Although  the  analytical  sample  was  small  in  this  pilot 
study,  our  findings  suggest  potentially  increased  adher-
ence  in  interventions  combining  lifestyle  with  other 
medical  treatment-like  components.  Possible  reasons 
underlying this finding need to be investigated in future 
studies.

Outside  Europe,  reported  domain-specific  adherence 
rates  for  FINGER-based  multidomain  lifestyle  interven-
tions  ranged  from  33  to  100%  in  the  6-month  SINGER 
trial (Singapore) [32] and from 94 to 100% in the 8-week 
SUPERBRAIN  trial  (South  Korea)  [33].  The  adher-
ence  rate  to  the  nutritional  supplement  in  the  Korean 
study  (multinutrient  drink)  was  99.1%  in  the  group  also 
receiving  lifestyle  intervention  and  83.7%  in  the  group 
only  receiving  the  supplement.  Another  pilot  feasibil-
ity  6-month  RCT  in  China  with  lifestyle  intervention 
comprising  cognitive  training,  mind–body  exercise, 
and  nurse-led  risk  factor  modification  reported  a  much 
lower  recruitment  rate  (76%  vs.  19%),  a  similar  dropout 
rate  (10%  vs.  11%),  and  a  comparable  overall  adherence 
rate  in  the  multidomain  lifestyle  arm  (78.1%  vs.  89%) 
[34].  Differences  in  findings  may  be  attributable  to  dif-
ferent  inclusion  criteria,  study  design,  and  definitions 
of  successful  feasibility  and  adherence  in  the  Chinese 
study [35]. We observed a significant improvement in the 
dietary pattern compared to other lifestyle changes. The 
diet component was introduced as the first intervention 
domain, potentially allowing more time to detect efficient 
changes in dietary patterns compared to other interven-
tion  domains.  Future  studies  are  encouraged  to  validate 
significant  lifestyle  changes  by  engaging  more  partici-
pants and implementing longer follow-up periods. Also, 

the  cognitive  and  social  activities  questionnaire  did  not 
cover  activities  that  were  part  of  the  intervention.  Since 
both intervention arms had frequent activities offered by 
the study, they may have had less time for other kinds of 
activities.

This  study  has  several  strengths,  including  multi-coun-
try setting, and comprehensive measurements of multiple 
lifestyle  domains.  Additionally,  the  use  of  device-based 
physical  activity  measurements  by  actigraphy  captured 
objectively  measured  exercise  data  across  multiple  inten-
sity  levels  at  baseline  and  6  months.  The  use  of  on-site 
cognitive training adapted for people with prodromal AD 
facilitated  adherence  to  the  training  program.  However, 
there are some limitations. The relatively small sample size 
and  6-month  duration  of  this  trial  limit  statistical  power 
and the possibility to assess longer-term adherence, reten-
tion and effects on cognition and dementia incidence. The 
multi-national  trial  presented  some  challenges  in  achiev-
ing balanced recruitment rates across all sites, with some 
sites  experiencing  lower  recruitment  due  to  competi-
tive  inclusions  between  multiple  ongoing  clinical  trials. 
This also resulted in a recruitment phase longer than the 
initially  planned  6  months.  The  trial  included  a  demo-
graphically  limited  population,  largely  comprising  white 
participants from Sweden, Finland, Germany, and France. 
Recruitment, retention, and adherence may be different in 
other  European  or  non-European  populations,  especially 
populations commonly under-represented in clinical trials.

Conclusions
Our  study  shows  that  a  complex  multimodal  lifestyle 
intervention  with  or  without  medical  food  is  feasible  in 
prodromal AD. Combining the lifestyle intervention with 
medical food may offer additional benefits on healthy die-
tary  patterns,  vascular  risk  burden,  and  cognitive-func-
tional  level.  Larger,  longer-term  ongoing  and  planned 
multimodal  intervention  RCTs  will  provide  more  infor-
mation  on  the  feasibility,  acceptability  and  effective-
ness of personalized lifestyle intervention programs that 
target  various  factors  related  to  brain  health  (e.g.  the 
FINGER-NL  trial  testing  a  lifestyle + medical  food  com-
bination,  and  other  multimodal  RTCs  conducted  within 
the  World-Wide  FINGERS  network)  [36].  Our  findings 
also  support  future  large-scale,  multi-site  RCTs  inves-
tigating  the  effectiveness  of  multimodal  lifestyle  inter-
ventions,  potentially  combined  with  disease-modifying 
drugs in older adults with cognitive impairment.
