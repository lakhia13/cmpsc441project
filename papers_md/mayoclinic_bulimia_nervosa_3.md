To diagnose bulimia, your healthcare professional will:

- Talk to you about your eating habits, ways to lose weight and physical symptoms.

- Do a physical exam.

- Request blood and urine tests.

- Request anECGor other tests to look for problems with your heart.

- Do a mental health evaluation, including talking about how you feel about your body and weight.

Your healthcare professional also may request more tests to pinpoint a diagnosis, rule out medical causes for weight changes and check for any related complications.

A diagnosis of bulimia usually includes episodes of binging and purging at least once a week for three months. But any binge and purge behaviors, even when done less often, can be dangerous and need treatment. The more often the episodes occur, the more severe the bulimia is.

When you have bulimia, you may need one or more types of treatment. Treatment includes proven therapies and medicines that may help you get better.

Treatment generally involves a team approach that includes you, your family, your primary healthcare professional, a mental health professional and sometimes a dietitian who knows how to treat eating problems.

Here's a look at bulimia treatment options.

Talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, involves talking to a mental health professional about your bulimia and related issues.

Studies show that these types of talk therapy can reduce symptoms of bulimia:

- Enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy, also known as CBT-E,to help teenagers and adults with bulimia create healthy-eating patterns and replace unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors with healthy, positive beliefs and behaviors.

- Family-based treatment, also known as FBT,to help the parents of children and teenagers with bulimia learn what to do about unhealthy-eating behaviors and help their child regain control over what is eaten.

- Dialectical behavioral therapy,to help people better tolerate distress, become more emotionally balanced, be more mindful and get along better with others.

Ask your mental health professional which type of therapy will be used and how that therapy helps treat bulimia.

Specific antidepressants may reduce the symptoms of bulimia. The only antidepressant that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved specifically to treat bulimia is fluoxetine (Prozac). This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, also known as an SSRI. It may help with symptoms of bulimia, even if you're not depressed. This medicine works better when it's used with talk therapy.

### Nutrition education

Dietitians with special training in treating eating disorders can help. They can design an eating plan to help you eat healthier, manage feelings of being overly hungry or having too many cravings, and provide good nutrition. Eating regularly and not limiting the amounts or types of food you eat is important in overcoming bulimia.

### Hospitalization

Usually, bulimia can be treated outside of the hospital. But if symptoms are severe and you have serious health complications, you may need to be treated in a hospital. Some programs for eating disorders may offer day treatment rather than a hospital stay.

### Treatment challenges in bulimia

Although most people with bulimia get better, some find that symptoms don't go away entirely. Periods of binge eating and purging may come and go through the years. For example, some people may binge eat and purge when they're under a lot of stress.

If you find yourself back in the binge eating-purge cycle, get help. Follow-up sessions with your primary healthcare professional, dietitian or mental health professional may help you before your eating disorder gets out of control again. Learning positive ways to cope, finding healthy ways to get along with others and managing stress can help keep an eating problem from returning.

If you've had an eating disorder in the past and you notice your symptoms returning, seek help from your medical team right away.

## Lifestyle and home remedies

In addition to professional treatment, use these self-care tips:

- Follow your treatment plan.Don't skip therapy sessions. Also, try to follow what you and your therapist plan for the time between sessions, even if those plans make you uncomfortable.

- Learn about bulimia.Knowing more about your condition can help you stay with your treatment plan.

- Get the right nutrition.If you aren't eating well or you're purging a lot, your body likely isn't getting all the nutrients it needs. Talk to your primary healthcare professional or dietitian about what vitamin and mineral supplements you need. But you should try to get most of your vitamins and minerals from food.

- Stay in touch.Don't stay away from caring family members and friends who want to see you get healthy. Know that they have your best interests at heart. And having people who care about you in your life is healthy for you.

- Be kind to yourself.Try not to weigh yourself or check yourself in the mirror a lot. These actions may fuel your drive to keep unhealthy habits.

- Be cautious with exercise.Talk to your primary healthcare professional about what kind of physical activity is right for you, especially if you exercise a lot to burn off calories after binge eating.

## Alternative medicine

People with eating disorders are at risk of misusing dietary supplements and herbal products designed to make them less hungry or help them lose weight. Weight-loss supplements or herbs can have serious side effects and be even more dangerous when taken with other medicines.

TheFDAdoes not need to approve weight-loss and other dietary supplements to go on the market. And "natural" doesn't always mean safe. If you use dietary supplements or herbs, talk to your primary healthcare professional about the risks.

## Coping and support

You may find it hard to cope with bulimia when the media, coaches, family, and maybe your own friends or peers are giving you mixed messages. How do you cope with a disease that can be deadly when you're also getting messages that being thin is a sign of success?

- Remind yourself what a healthy weight is for your body.

- Try not to diet or skip meals, which can cause binge eating.

- Don't skip therapy sessions.

- Don't visit websites that support or praise eating disorders.

- Work with your treatment team to figure out which situations cause thoughts or behaviors that may play a part in your bulimia. Create a plan to deal with those situations.

- Make a plan to cope with the hardships of setbacks.

- Look for positive role models who can make you feel better about yourself.

- Find activities and hobbies that you enjoy to distract you from thoughts of binge eating and purging.

- Feel better about yourself by forgiving yourself, focusing on the positive, and crediting and accepting yourself.

If you have bulimia, you and your family may find support groups to be a source of encouragement, hope and advice on coping. Group members can understand what you're going through because they've been there. Ask your healthcare professional if a group is in your area.

### Coping advice for parents

If you're the parent of a child with bulimia, you may blame yourself for your child's eating disorder. But eating disorders have many causes, and it's known that parents do not cause eating disorders. Parents play a very important role in helping their children recover from these illnesses.

Here are some suggestions:

- Be sure your child gets treatment.Take part in the treatment plan so that you know how you can best support your child.

- Listen.Be an active listener. Give your child a safe space to talk and share feelings without judgment.

- Schedule regular family mealtimes.Eating at routine times is important to reduce binge eating.

- Let your teenager know your concerns.Do not place blame. An eating disorder is not a choice or something your child does. It's a complex illness that affects your child's brain and how your child makes decisions.

Remember that eating disorders affect the whole family. You need to take care of yourself too. If you feel that you aren't coping well with your child's bulimia, professional counseling could help you. Or ask your child's primary healthcare professional about support groups for parents of children with eating disorders.
