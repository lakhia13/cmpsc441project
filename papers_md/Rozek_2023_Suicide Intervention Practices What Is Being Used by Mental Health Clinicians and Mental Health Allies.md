Abstract

Objective:  Implementation of evidence-based suicide prevention is critical to prevent death 
by suicide. Contrary to previously held beliefs, interventions including contracting for safety, no-
harm contracts, and no-suicide contracts are not best practices and are considered contraindicated. 
Little is known about the current use of best practices and contraindicated interventions for suicide 
prevention in community settings.

Methods:  Data were collected from 771 individuals enrolled in a suicide prevention training. 
Both mental health clinicians (n=613) and mental health allies (e.g., teachers, first responders) 
(n=158) reported which best practices (i.e., safety plan, crisis response plan) and contraindicated 
interventions (i.e., contracting for safety, no-harm contract, no-suicide contract) they use with 
individuals who presents with risk for suicide.

Results:  The majority of both mental health clinicians (89.7%) and mental health allies (67.1%) 
endorsed using at least one evidence-based practice. However, of those who endorsed using 
evidence-based interventions, ~40% of both mental health clinicians and allies endorsed using 
contraindicated interventions as well.

Conclusion:  Contraindicated interventions are being used at high rates and suicide prevention 
trainings for evidence-based interventions should include a focus on de-implementation of 
contraindicated interventions. This study examined only a snapshot of what clinicians and allies 
endorsed using. Additional in depth information about each intervention and when it is used would

to ensure only evidence-based interventions are being used to help prevent death by suicide.

As suicide rates continue to rise, suicide prevention interventions are needed to help address 
this public health crisis and should not be limited to just licensed mental health providers. 
With over 800,000 people dying by suicide each year, suicide is the 17th leading cause of 
death worldwide (WHO, 2018). In United States, suicide consistently falls within the top 10 
leading causes of death with over 47,000 deaths in 2019 (AFSP, 2019; Stone et al., 2018). 
While frontline evidence-based suicide interventions have evolved in the years since first 
studied, effective implementation of evidence-based interventions is equally as important as 
the interventions themselves. Understanding current suicide intervention practice utilization 
of mental health clinicians and allies is critical to the translational goal of evidence-informed 
care for suicide risk.

Historically, no-suicide contracts, (also known as “no-harm contracts” and/or “contracting 
for safety”, regularly used interchangeably), were once the primary method of suicide 
prevention (Drew, 2001). A no-suicide contract entails clinicians requesting or requiring a 
written or verbal agreement from the patient stating that they will not kill themselves. This 
intervention has been practiced for decades (e.g., Drye et al., 1973) and has often been 
widely integrated into healthcare systems. No-suicide contracts were originally thought to 
reduce harm, especially from a clinician’s liability standpoint (Edwards & Sachmann, 2010). 
More recent research suggests this is not the case (Garvey et al., 2009). In fact, no-suicide 
contracts have been shown to be neutral at best and harmful at worst (Edwards & Sachmann, 
2010; McMyler & Pryjmachuk, 2008; Rudd et al., 2006). There is evidence to suggest that 
these interventions do not decrease liability and may do the opposite including increasing 
risk for suicidal behavior (Garvey et el., 2009). Training on using no-suicide contracts 
and similar interventions is a low burden but they do not appear to deliver the protective 
outcomes they were initially thought to provide.

More recently, suicide-related interventions have focused on providing the patient with a 
plan and skills that help them manage suicide risk (Rudd et al., 2009) that the patient can 
follow to reduce the risk of death by suicide. During an acute suicidal crisis, individuals 
often lose their ability to problem solve, regulate their emotions, and think flexibly – all 
of which increase suicidality (Bryan & Rozek, 2018). Two brief and effective approaches 
for reducing suicidality are the Crisis Response Plan (CRP; Bryan et al., 2017) and the 
Safety Planning Intervention (SPI; Stanley & Brown, 2012). The CRP is a multi-component 
intervention that begins with a narrative assessment (e.g., telling of the story of the crisis 
while assessing for additional risk factors in a conversational way) and develops a plan 
that includes five components – 1) suicide warning signs, 2) self-coping skills, 3) reasons 
for living, 4) social supports, and 5) professional crisis resources. The overall plan is 
very personalized based on the strengths of the individual. The CRP has been shown to 
reduce suicidal behavior by 76%, immediately reduce emotional distress, decrease days

on inpatient psychiatric care, increase optimism, and can be integrated into longer-term 
treatments (Bryan et al., 2017, Bryan et al., 2018, Rozek et al., 2019; Rozek & Bryan, 2020).

Similarly, the SPI is a brief intervention and tool that utilizes a hierarchical structure to aid 
individuals in the management of suicidal crises (Stanley & Brown, 2012). The step-by-step 
components include 1) identify warning signs indicative of a suicidal crisis, 2) implement 
internal coping strategies (e.g., relaxation, physical activity), 3) identify social contacts 
and social settings that can provide distractions, 4) reach out to sources of support for 
help, 5) reach out to professional (e.g., therapist) or emergency sources of support (e.g., 
911), and 6) reduce access to means for suicide (Stanley & Brown, 2012). Research has 
shown that within a sample of Veterans Affairs (VA) Emergency Department patients, those 
who received the SPI had 45% fewer suicidal behaviors during the following 6 months 
compared to patients who received the usual care of evaluation and referral (Stanley et al., 
2018). The CRP and SPI have several overlapping components in terms of content and 
procedures and can be used for individuals at risk for suicide regardless of the diagnosis 
or treatment modality. Additionally, both of these interventions (i.e., CRP and SPI) have 
been supported in clinical guidelines (e.g., VA/DOD, 2013, 2019) and focus on developing 
a concrete skills based plan for individuals at risk for suicide, and can be conducted in 
one encounter. Still, there is limited research to support understanding of what kind of 
suicide practice interventions or approaches mental health clinicians actually utilize, when 
individuals present with suicide risk.

Mental healthcare at large, and specifically suicide prevention, has been increasingly 
adopted by non-mental health care clinicians in the form of peer support. This is particularly 
true within certain populations including military personnel and veterans (e.g., Baker et 
al., 2021). Formal or structured peer-support programs have been developed in various 
settings with the goals of reducing deaths by suicide and addressing other mental health 
challenges (Greden et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2009). Less structured training programs for 
community members, including professionals and laypersons of various fields who engage 
in peer support for suicide prevention (e.g., teachers, victim advocates, first responders) are 
in place in a variety of settings (Cross et al., 2010). These training often act as “gatekeeper” 
trainings, a public health approach to suicide prevention at the community level (Burnette et 
al., 2015). Given the brevity and overall simplicity of the SPI and the CRP it is reasonable 
that, with proper training, non-mental health care clinicians, or mental health allies (e.g., 
teachers, first responders, peer support specialists), can feasibly and effectively incorporate 
these interventions into peer support programming. Studies aimed at integrating current best 
practices into peer support programs are forthcoming (Bryan et al. 2020). However, training 
courses for evidence-based interventions typically target mental health professionals, which 
may leave mental health allies without substantial access to training in evidence-based 
practices for suicide prevention. Despite the array and growing popularity of peer support 
programs, little is known about whether mental health allies are using evidence-based 
practices (e.g., SPI or CRP) or contraindicated interventions.

The goal of the current study is to describe what specific suicide prevention interventions 
are being used by both mental health clinicians and mental health allies. Specifically, 
we examined the use of two evidence-based interventions (i.e., CRP and SPI) and

contraindicated interventions (i.e., safety contract, no-harm contract, and no-suicide 
contract). Although the study is descriptive in nature, we predicted that the majority of 
mental health clinicians, given their professional training, would endorse evidence-based 
practices in suicide prevention interventions. However, given the history and continued 
training which often champions contracting for safety and other now contraindicated 
interventions, we predicted that mental health clinicians would likely still report using these 
outdated interventions as well. We also predicted that mental health clinicians would be 
more likely endorse implementing evidence-based suicide prevention interventions more 
frequently and less likely to endorse using contraindicated practices than non-mental 
health clinicians. Additionally, descriptive analyses were used to explore differences in 
self-reported use of hospitalization as a suicide prevention intervention.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective evaluation of specific suicide interventions among mental health 
clinicians and mental health allies enrolled in training programs for Crisis Response Plan 
(CRP) for suicide prevention. The Revised Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting 
Excellence (SQUIRE 2.0) guidelines provided the framework for this article (Ogrinc et al., 
2016).

Context

The Suicide and Trauma Reduction Initiative for Veterans (STRIVE, formerly the National 
Center for Veteran Studies at the University of Utah) and the STRONG STAR Training 
Initiative (SSTI) at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio have 
established grant-funded training programs in CRP for both mental health clinicians 
and mental health allies. The STRIVE program received grant-funding from the Boeing 
Corporation to train veteran-serving, community-based licensed mental health clinicians 
and mental health allies in CRP. The SSTI received grant-funding from the Texas Health 
and Human Services Texas Veteran + Family Alliance Grant Program to train veteran-
serving, community-based licensed mental health clinicians in CRP. In this sample, mental 
health allies were inclusive of lay community members who registered for training in 
suicide prevention and who were employed in various professions including teachers, first 
responders, bachelors level rape crisis counselors, and certified peer support specialists. 
Both programs recruited training participants through advertising on professional listservs 
and social media posts. Trainers from both programs worked closely to develop standardize 
training and evaluation procedures (DCR, BAF, KAD).

This study reports on descriptive information of enrolled mental health clinicians and mental 
health allies as well as the pre-training methods of suicide prevention methods which 
were collected through the CRP training application. The STRIVE training cohorts were 
conducted during a 2-year period between January 2018–March 2020. The SSTI training 
cohorts were conducted from August 2018 to September 2019.

The Implementation Intervention

Participants in this sample enrolled in a Crisis Response Plan (CRP) Training Cohort. 
For these programs, the CRP training model was developed by the teams to support skill 
and competency development (Hepner et al., 2019). The training model consisted of a 
1-day in-person training workshop which included didactics, demonstration videos, and role 
plays where attendees practiced skills in one-on-one settings with expert trainers observing 
and providing feedback. Role plays were designed to allow attendees to develop skills 
in narrative assessment and the collaborative development of a CRP. Following the 1-day 
training, trainees were offered support through 4-6 months of clinical case consultation 
conducted on a video teleconferencing platform with groups of up to 8 attendees. CRP 
expert consultants facilitated the consultation groups focused on the implementation of 
CRP. Each attendee presented de-identified client details and specific information about the 
narrative assessment and CRP. Consultants provided feedback on CRP fidelity, direction 
for upcoming sessions (if applicable), and conceptualization support. The goal of weekly 
consultation was to enhance each attendees’ technical skills in order to improve delivery of 
CRP. The current study utilizes data from trainees’ baseline application survey.

Trainees completed online applications in order to be considered for acceptance 
into a training cohort. Training applications included applicants’ contact information, 
demographics, and an assessment of current suicide prevention intervention practices.

Suicide Prevention Practice—Data on the trainees’ current suicide prevention practices 
was collected during the application process prior to the CRP training. Applicants were 
asked to indicate all current suicide prevention practices. Applicants were asked, “When 
a client presents with suicidal ideation and/or behaviors do you use any of the following 
(check all that apply).” Response options for immediate interventions included: Contract 
for safety, No-harm Contract, No-Suicide Contract, Safety Plan, Crisis Response Plan, and 
Hospitalization.

Measures

Statistical Analyses

Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 26.0. Descriptive statistics of individuals 
receiving training were run to identify demographic characteristics including self-reported 
gender, age, race, ethnicity, and self-identified peer support/non-mental health clinicians. 
Descriptive statistics were run to identify frequencies of use of evidence-based practices for 
suicide prevention (i.e., CRP and SPI), contraindicated interventions (i.e., contracting for 
safety, no-suicide contracts, and no-harm contracts), and hospitalization. Chi-squared tests 
were conducted to determine if there were significant differences in endorsed interventions 
between mental health clinicians and non-mental health clinicians.

Ethics Statement

The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Institutional Review Board 
reviewed the project program evaluation plan and made a non-research determination.

de-identified program evaluation data. Both training programs designed the original project 
and surveys for internal program evaluation purposes and the findings are to be used in 
developing targeted trainings, improve dissemination and implementation, and supporting 
the overall mission of the training programs. As such, trainee consent to participate was 
given by virtue of participation in the Training Program, which included program evaluation.

Results

Baseline Demographic and Characteristics of Training Participants

A total of 771 individuals who completed baseline surveys prior to attending trainings on 
suicide prevention were included in the current study. A total of 613 mental health clinicians 
(n=232 from the Strong Star Training Initiative and n=381 from STRIVE) and 158 mental 
health allies completed surveys from 2018-2021. The sample was predominately female 
(78.4%), White (74.3%), non-Hispanic/Latinx (76.4%) See Table 1 for detailed demographic 
information.

Use of Evidence-based Practices for Suicide Interventions

Descriptive statistics were run to examine the self-reported frequency of use of evidence-
based interventions (i.e., SPI and CRP) for mental health clinicians and mental health allies 
(see Table 2). Mental health clinicians endorsed using the SPI at 84.8% and CRP at 47.6% 
with a combined rate of 89.7% of participants using at least one evidence-based practice 
suicide prevention intervention. Mental health allies reported using the SPI at 57.0% and 
CRP at 40.5% with a combined rate of 67.1% using at least one evidence-based practice 
suicide prevention intervention. For mental health clinicians who endorsed using at least one 
evidence-based practice, 41.8% also reported using at least one contraindicated intervention. 
Similarly, for mental health allies who endorsed at least one evidence-based practice, 41.5% 
also reported using at least one contraindicated intervention.

Use of Contraindicated Practices for Suicide Interventions

Parallel descriptive statistics were run to examine the self-reported frequency of 
contraindicated interventions for suicide prevention (i.e., contract for safety, no-harm 
contract, and no-suicide contract) (see Table 2). Over one third of mental health clinicians 
(35.6%) endorsed using the contract for safety, while 15.0% reported using no-harm 
contracts, and 13.7% reported using no-suicide contracts. Overall, 39.5% of mental health 
clinicians using at least one contraindicated intervention. Nearly a quarter (24%) of mental 
health allies reported contracting for safety, while 12.7% reported using no-harm contracts, 
and 8.2% reported using no-suicide contracts, with a combined rate of 28.5% of mental 
health allies using at least one contraindicated intervention. Of note, ~2% of mental health 
clinicians and <1% of mental health allies reported using only contraindicated interventions.

Comparing Mental Health Clinicians to Mental Health Allies

Chi-square tests were conducted to examine differences in suicide intervention use between 
mental health clinicians and mental health allies. Mental health clinicians were more likely 
to report using evidence-based interventions compared to mental health allies (X2 (1, N = 
771) = 50.71, p <.001). However, mental health clinicians were also more likely to report

using contraindicated interventions compared to mental health allies (X2 (1, N = 771) = 
6.50, p =.01).

Hospitalization

Descriptive statistics were run to examine the self-reported frequency of use of 
hospitalization as a means of suicide prevention among both mental health clinicians 
and mental health allies. Mental health clinicians were more likely to endorse using 
hospitalization as for suicide prevention than mental health allies (70.1% compared to 
31.6%). Chi-square tests were conducted to examine differences in self-reported use 
of hospitalization as an intervention for individuals expressing suicidal ideation and/or 
behavior. Mental health clinicians endorsed higher rates of hospitalization compared to 
mental health allies (X2 (1, N = 771) = 79.25, p <.001).

Discussion

This study provides useful data concerning the current utilization of first line evidence-based 
practices and contraindicated suicide prevention practices among community-based mental 
health clinicians and mental health allies. An overwhelming 89.7% of the community-
based mental health clinicians endorsed using at least one evidence-based practice of SPI 
and/or CRP. The majority of community-based mental health clinicians indicated that they 
used evidence-based practices including SPI (84.8%) and almost half of the respondents 
used CRP (47.6%). The majority of mental health allies (67.1%) also endorsed using 
evidence-based practices for suicide prevention, but at lower rates compared to mental 
health clinicians. Over half of mental health allies reported using SPI (57.0%) and many 
reported using the CRP (40.5%). Although these results demonstrate the promising reach 
and implementation of evidence-based practice to prevent suicide, over 40% of the same 
mental health clinicians (41.8%) and mental health allies (41.5%) who use SPI and CRP also 
engaged in contraindicated interventions. These endorsement rates are somewhat offset by 
the results that show only ~2% of mental health clinicians exclusively used contraindicated 
interventions. Interestingly, mental health clinicians were more likely to endorse the use 
contraindicated suicide prevention interventions than mental health allies.

In the field of suicide prevention, there is a unique responsibility to ensure clinicians are 
aware of contraindicated practices as well as trained in evidence-based practices. With 
this study’s finding of such high percentages of clinicians and allies using outdated and 
contraindicated approaches, additional training in the evidence-based practices to reduce 
and prevent suicide seems necessary. Based on these findings, a specific emphasis on 
de-implementation of contraindicated prevention methods, rather than just education on 
the evidence-based practices, is warranted. De-implementation is a complex strategy aimed 
to halt the practice of interventions that have shown to be either ineffective or harmful 
(Prasad & Ioannidis, 2014) and is recommended when an alternative approach, like CRP 
and SPI, have been identified as evidence-based alternatives. For example, at the clinician 
level it is recommended that trainers of evidence-based suicide prevention practices be 
explicit about not combining or incorporating contraindicated practices with SPI or CRP. 
De-implementation at the organizational and environmental levels may be more difficult

to achieve, given that change in practice depends on the level of connection with system 
leaders (Pinto & Park, 2019). Although contracting for safety and engaging in no-harm or 
no-suicide contracts are likely a vestige of prior training and/or even organizational practice, 
specific efforts to de-implement these practices are imperative in comprehensive suicide 
prevention policy and programs.

Mental health allies represent a substantial subset of individuals who work to prevent 
suicides in the population at large. It is promising that non-mental health care providers 
in our sample use evidence-based interventions at over 50%, compared to the 28.5% use 
of contraindicated practices, though even these numbers can and should be improved. 
Providing mental health allies with additional skills and training for implementing evidence-
based practices is an important avenue for the improvement of care for suicidal individuals 
and, ultimately, for the reduction of suicides. While mental health allies are already using 
these brief and relatively simple evidence-based tools (i.e., SPI and CRP), we should seek 
to expand their abilities to support high-risk individuals by increasing access to trainings 
in evidence-based intervention and prevention programs. Additional research should focus 
on how to best adapt trainings for mental health allies in order to provide support for 
implementation of these interventions with high fidelity.

Overall, many individuals endorsed hospitalization as an option (i.e., 62.3% of total sample). 
Mental health clinicians endorsed hospitalization as an option at higher rates (70.1%) 
compared to mental health allies (31.6%). Although data suggests that hospitalization may 
increase risk of suicidal behavior in the months following the stay, it is still an option that 
many use and may be clinically indicated (Chung et al., 2017). Although hospitalization 
is an option, it is important to follow clinical guidelines and determine the risk level 
of an individual through assessing suicide risk (e.g., access to means, recent behavior, 
suicidal thoughts, plan, intent). Additionally, spending the time assessing and providing an 
intervention like the CRP or SPI allows for the individual in crisis to manage with the 
support of a mental health provider or mental health ally prior to the decision to hospitalize 
or not. More research is needed on understanding the decision process of determining 
when and how hospitalization is used when working with individuals who present with 
risk for suicide to see if alternative models can be used to prevent the potential overuse 
of hospitalization. The differing rates of endorsement should be investigated further as for 
some mental health providers, protocols, policies, and laws may require hospitalization 
for certain patients. These limitations or training in hospitalization utilization for suicide 
risk may not be in place for many mental health allies. Although hospitalization may be 
a life-saving intervention, data may not support its use, especially as frequently as many 
use it (Ward-Ciesielski & Rizvi, 2020). Mental health allies may have additional reasons 
for not endorsing the use of this intervention that may help understand suicide prevention 
(e.g., lived experience). Future research should examine this closer with a lens towards 
understanding when and why both mental health clinicians and mental health allies use 
hospitalization as an intervention.

This study had a number of strengths as well as limitations. The strengths include that 
the data collected were across two training institutes and from trainings in many different 
states with various backgrounds. Additionally, all of the data was collected at baseline,

which shows mental health clinicians and mental health ally data at baseline prior to a 
suicide specific intervention training (i.e., CRP). In terms of limitations, the current study 
did not provide specific definitions for each category of interventions. This left respondents 
to choose what they believed was accurate. Additionally, the frequency of each intervention 
was not measured and was dichotomized to used or not used. This does not give a clear 
picture of when each intervention was used or how often. Because the original data was 
for program improvement, the survey was not set up as a specific research question nor 
were standardized measures used. Last, it is worth noting that our training programs did 
not specifically target mental health allies and therefore those allies who attended may 
have already been familiar with and/or using evidence-based practices and were potentially 
drawn to our training due to having prior knowledge of the CRP and SPI. This study also 
included many military-serving mental health clinicians and allies, which might not be 
generalizable to those not serving military personnel. Future research should examine this 
topic longitudinally to see how trainings on evidence-based suicide interventions impact 
behavior and reported interventions as well as in a wider sample of both mental health 
clinicians and mental health allies.

Overall, both mental health clinicians and mental health allies endorsed using evidence-
based practices for suicide prevention at high rates. Unfortunately, contraindicated suicide 
interventions are also still being endorsed at high rates as well. This likely indicates that 
these interventions are being used in some combination, suggesting a larger problem in 
suicide prevention efforts. Evidence-based suicide prevention training should focus not just 
on teaching the evidence-based practices, but also on de-implementation of contraindicated 
interventions. This focus on reducing the use of contraindicated interventions will likely 
improve the impact of evidence-based suicide prevention and potentially improve suicide 
prevention efforts.

Highlights:

•

•

•

The majority of both mental health clinicians and mental health allies 
use evidence-based practices for suicide prevention. This indicates good 
implementation rates of evidence-based interventions for suicide prevention.

Approximately 40% of both mental health clinicians and mental health allies 
who endorsed using evidence-based practices for suicide preventions also 
endorsed using contraindicated interventions.

A focus on de-implementation of contraindicated suicide interventions is 
warranted and should be part of the focus on suicide prevention efforts.
