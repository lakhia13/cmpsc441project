Abstract

Introduction: The China American Psychoanalytic Alliance (CAPA) has been offering

psychoanalytic psychotherapy training and treatment to Chinese mental health pro-

fessionals entirely over the Internet since 2006. When the COVID-19 pandemic

began, most practitioners worldwide had to turn to teletherapy. US psychoanalytic

practitioners were more negative towards teletherapy than those from other theoret-

ical orientations. We predicted that CAPA practitioners as compared to US psycho-

analytic practitioners would be more prepared for teletherapy services during the

pandemic, since they their training and treatment had been on-line.

Method: We compared survey results from 164 CAPA practitioners with 165 US

psychoanalytic practitioners (matched for age) who had recently psychoanalytically

treated a patient on-line. CAPA participants were recruited from CAPA email lists

and the US sample were recruited from the Society for Psychoanalysis and Psychoan-

alytic Psychology of the American Psychological Association, the American Psycho-

analytic Association and International Psychotherapy Institute.

Results: CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners had

more positive opinions about teletherapy before the pandemic; had more positive

opinions about teletherapy during the pandemic; and had more positive opinions

about the effectiveness of teletherapy in working with transference, relational issues

and resistance. The CAPA practitioners were more prepared to do psychoanalytic

psychotherapy during the pandemic than the US psychoanalytic practitioners.

Discussion: Xiubing Wang discusses these findings in terms of her own experience as a

CAPA graduate and treater before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic in China.

Patients are not guests in your office when conducting online therapy

(Campbell, 2020). When you are the invited guest into the personal

space of your patient, you are now viewing the patients' furnishings, art-

work, children and pets that may intrude. Your face would be on the lap-

top of your patient's computer, and they can see their own face. All this

should be considered as a different experience than in-office work. All

these reactions are valuable for analysis and exploration.

I still remember how lost I felt the first time I visited my supervisor's

office in Chicago. His face was not 20 in. close to mine like during the last

few years. The distance I felt when I finally met him in person made me

feel destabilized. This experience helped me understand why some
patients prefer meeting online. As one patient said, “on-line I feel closer

and I feel that I get full attention since there is nothing but the therapist's
caring eyes in my field of vision.”

could explore how our reaction to the pandemic was being affected by

past traumas, our personality dynamics and how our parents made us feel

secure.

We could peer into each other's homes, and that created an inclu-

siveness that is not available with in-office treatment. For example, and

intruding pet or the noise from a child, all stimulate the patient's fantasy

life. It was a comforting experience for me when my analyst introduced

his dog to me. My patients might have a different reaction of jealousy or

disruption. Either way it is a great chance to work with transference and

relationships. Continuing to be available by telepsychotherapy during

social distancing was essential to the emotional well-being of my patients.

| After the pandemic

After 2 months of quarantine, my office opened again. After the pan-

demic, 60% of my patients chose therapy over videoconference compared

to 35% before pandemic. Some patients needed to see the embodied

therapist to have a sense of my reality and emotional availability. They

might have more dependency or object constancy issues that made them

feel that an embodied presence is better. There are some patients that

reported that they like online therapy better. The distance created by the

internet helped some patients feel less anxious, so they can have more

space to feel and express themselves as well as save time from commut-

ing. The reactions to distance treatment are based on the patients'

dynamics, all of which is analyzable.
