Background

A B S T R A C T

The diagnosis of dementia relies on the presence of new-onset cognitive impairment affecting an individual's functioning and activities
of daily living. The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) is a questionnaire instrument, completed by a
suitable 'informant' who knows the patient well, designed to assess change in functional performance secondary to cognitive change; it
is used as a tool for identifying those who may have dementia.

In secondary care there are two specific instances where patients may be assessed for the presence of dementia. These are in the general
acute hospital setting, where opportunistic screening may be undertaken, or in specialist memory services where individuals have been
referred due to perceived cognitive problems. To ensure an instrument is suitable for diagnostic use in these settings, its test accuracy
must be established.

Objectives

To determine the accuracy of the informant-based questionnaire IQCODE for detection of dementia in a secondary care setting.

Search methods

We searched the following sources on the 28th of January 2013: ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), MEDLINE
(Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection
(includes Conference Proceedings Citation Index) (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME). We also
searched sources specific to diagnostic test accuracy: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven); DARE (Database of Abstracts of
Reviews  of  Effects  -  via  the  Cochrane  Library);  HTA  Database  (Health  Technology  Assessment  Database  via  the  Cochrane  Library)  and
ARIF (Birmingham University). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, used searches of known relevant studies
in  PubMed  to  track  related  articles,  and  contacted  research  groups  conducting  work  on  IQCODE  for  dementia  diagnosis  to  try  to  find
additional studies. We developed a sensitive search strategy; search terms were designed to cover key concepts using several different
approaches  run  in  parallel  and  included  terms  relating  to  cognitive  tests,  cognitive  screening  and  dementia.  We  used  standardised
database subject headings such as MeSH terms (in MEDLINE) and other standardised headings (controlled vocabulary) in other databases,
as appropriate.

Selection criteria

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We selected those studies performed in secondary-care settings, which included (not necessarily exclusively) IQCODE to assess for the
presence of dementia and where dementia diagnosis was confirmed with clinical assessment. For the 'secondary care' setting we included
all studies which assessed patients in hospital (e.g. acute unscheduled admissions, referrals to specialist geriatric assessment services etc.)
and those referred for specialist 'memory' assessment, typically in psychogeriatric services.

Data collection and analysis

We  screened  all  titles  generated  by  electronic  database  searches,  and  reviewed  abstracts  of  all  potentially  relevant  studies.  Two
independent  assessors  checked  full  papers  for  eligibility  and  extracted  data.  We  determined  quality  assessment  (risk  of  bias  and
applicability) using the QUADAS-2 tool, and reporting quality using the STARD tool.

Main results

From 72 papers describing IQCODE test accuracy, we included 13 papers, representing data from 2745 individuals (n = 1413 (51%) with
dementia). Pooled analysis of all studies using data presented closest to a cut-off of 3.3 indicated that sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to
0.94); specificity 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.75); the positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.6) and the negative likelihood ratio was
0.14 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.22).

There was a statistically significant difference in test accuracy between the general hospital setting and the specialist memory setting (P
= 0.019), suggesting that IQCODE performs better in a 'general' setting.

We  found  no  significant  differences  in  the  test  accuracy  of  the  short  (16-item)  versus  the  26-item  IQCODE,  or  in  the  language  of
administration.

There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including a highly varied prevalence of dementia (10.5% to 87.4%). Across
the included papers there was substantial potential for bias, particularly around sampling of included participants and selection criteria,
which  may  limit  generalisability.  There  was  also  evidence  of  suboptimal  reporting,  particularly  around  disease  severity  and  handling
indeterminate results, which are important if considering use in clinical practice.

Authors' conclusions

The  IQCODE  can  be  used  to  identify  older  adults  in  the  general  hospital  setting  who  are  at  risk  of  dementia  and  require  specialist
assessment; it is useful specifically for ruling out those without evidence of cognitive decline. The language of administration did not affect
test accuracy, which supports the cross-cultural use of the tool. These findings are qualified by the significant heterogeneity, the potential
for bias and suboptimal reporting found in the included studies.

Assessment of changes in memory and everyday function in older people using a structured questionnaire, the IQCODE

Improving  how  we  assess  people  who  may  have  dementia  is  a  health  and  social  care  priority,  recent  initiatives  to  increase  dementia
diagnosis rates have attracted considerable attention. At present we do not have an agreed approach to dementia testing. There are many
tests which can help us identify people with the memory and thinking problems suggestive of dementia, but there is no agreement on
which tests are best. It is possible that some tests may be better suited to certain healthcare settings than others.

Our review was interested in the accuracy of a questionnaire-based assessment for dementia, called the IQCODE (Informant Questionnaire
for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly). We describe how useful the IQCODE is when used in a hospital setting. Under the umbrella term
'hospital' we include specialist memory clinics and old-age psychiatry units as well as general hospital clinics and wards and the older
people's services within them.

We searched electronic databases of published research studies, looking for all studies of IQCODE in a hospital setting. We searched from
the first available papers in scientific databases up to and including January 2013.

We  found  13  relevant  studies  which  had  results  suitable  to  be  combined  in  a  single  analysis.  Of  these  papers,  six  (1352  participants)
described studies conducted in “specialist” services such as memory clinics or wards. Three papers (566 participants) described studies
conducted in general older adult services and four studies (827 participants) included both specialist and general services.

Summarising the available papers, we found that IQCODE was useful for 'ruling out' possible dementia in the general hospital setting. This
means if a person has a low score on IQCODE testing they probably do not have dementia. IQCODE was less useful in specialist memory
clinics and psychiatry wards. We also found that a short version of the IQCODE gave similar results to the traditional longer version.

As part of our assessment we looked at whether the design of the available studies was suitable for the study question. We found several
instances where the design of the study could be improved. For example, seven of the thirteen studies only included a selection of all the
people attending the service who could have been assessed with IQCODE. We also looked at how well researchers reported the conduct

and results of their studies. Again, there were many instances where the reporting could be improved. A common issue was not describing
the severity of memory and thinking problems in those thought to have dementia, only reported in three of the included studies.

In summary, IQCODE may be a useful tool for assessing adults for possible dementia. There are still a number of unanswered questions
around how useful IQCODE may be in hospital settings. For example, before we start using IQCODE routinely we need to describe if it is
practical and acceptable to hospital staff, to patients and to their carers.

The review was performed by a team based in research centres in the UK (Glasgow, Leicester, Oxford). We had no external funding specific
to this study and we have no conflicts of interest that may have influenced our assessment of the research data.

Within the range of commonly used cut-offs for defining IQ-

secondary care settings.

The sensitivity falls as the diagnostic threshold increases
from 3.3-3.6, with a relative increase in the specificity.

The preferred balance between sensitivity and specificity is
debatable.

Summary of findings 3.   New Summary of findings table

What is the accuracy of the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) test for detection of dementia using dif-
ferent versions of IQCODE and using different languages of administration

Population

Adults attending secondary care services, with no restrictions on the case-mix of recruited participants

Setting

Our primary setting of interest was secondary care, within this rubric we included inpatient wards and hospital outpatient
clinics.

Secondary care settings can be considered as two groups:

(1) Studies conducted in a specialist memory/psychogeriatrics setting where participants were referred due to cognitive
symptoms

(2) Non-memory focused hospital services. These included unselected admissions of older adults, those referred to specialist
older people's assessment teams, outpatient attenders and inpatients under the care of geriatricians

Index test

Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) administered to a relevant informant. We restricted
analyses to the traditional 26-item IQCODE and the commonly used short form IQCODE with 16 items

16 item n = 899 (51%)

Relative sensitivity of 26-item versus 16-
item IQCODE: 0.98 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.07)

There was no difference in accuracy between IQCODE
versions so it may be justifiable to advocate use of the
short form to minimise responses required

The lower level of specificity in the specialist memory
services is of limited clinical concern as other tests will
be used in this setting and incorrectly diagnosing some-
one with dementia based on IQCODE alone would be
unlikely.

In the non-memory setting it is likely a positive IQCODE
would prompt referral to specialist services, and this
may be associated with psychological harm and unnec-
essary expense.

Applying our non-memory findings to the UK; there are
around 2 million unscheduled admissions annually in
over-65s (Imison 2012) and a dementia prevalence of
42.4% in this group (Sampson 2009).

Using the IQCODE alone to screen for dementia would
result in 42,400 people with dementia not being identi-
fied and 218,880 dementia-free people being referred
inappropriately for specialist assessment.

CAUTION: The results in this table should not be interpreted in isolation from the results of the individual included studies contributing to each summary test accuracy mea-
sure. These are reported in the main body of the text of the review.

*: Four studies included participants recruited in both specialist memory and non-memory settings, without reporting outcome data stratified by recruitment setting and
are thus not included in the quantitative synthesis

B A C K G R O U N D

 Dementia is a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative syndrome
that  is  a  substantial  and  growing  public  health  concern  (Hebert
2003; Hebert 2013; Prince 2013).  Depending on the case definition
employed,  contemporary  estimates  of  dementia  prevalence  in
the  United  States  are  in  the  range  2.5  to  4.5  million  individuals.
Dementia  is  predominantly  a  disease  of  older  adults,  with  a
10%  prevalence  in  adults  aged  over  65,  increasing  to  around
30%  in  adults  aged  over  85  (Ferri  2005).  Changes  in  population
demographics  will  be  accompanied  by  increases  in  dementia
incidence  and  prevalence.  Consensus  opinion  based  on  current
epidemiological  trends  is  of  a  doubling  in  dementia  prevalence
every  20  years,  with  a  global  prevalence  of  around  81  million
cases  by  2040.  Dementia  is  not  limited  to  'Western'  nations
and  an  increasing  prevalence  is  particularly  marked  in  countries
such  as  China  and  India  (Ferri  2005).  Recent  population  follow-
up  studies  have  cast  doubt  upon  earlier  estimates  of  increasing
dementia  incidence  (Matthews  2013);  however  even  with  these
lower predictions of incidence, the absolute number of individuals
with dementia in society will be substantial, and accurate diagnosis
remains a public health priority.

A  key  element  of  effective  management  in  dementia  is  a  firm
diagnosis. Recent guidelines place emphasis on early diagnosis to
facilitate improved management and to allow informed discussions
and planning with patients and carers. Given the projected global
increase  in  dementia  prevalence,  there  is  a  potential  tension
between  the  clinical  requirements  for  robust  diagnosis  at  the
individual  patient  level  and  the  need  for  equitable,  easy  access
to  diagnosis  at  a  population  level.  The  ideal  would  be  expert,
multidisciplinary assessment informed by various supplementary
investigations. Such an approach may be possible for assessment
of challenging cases in 'specialist' settings, but is not practical or
feasible for all people with possible cognitive decline.

In  practice  a  two-stage  process  is  often  employed,  with  initial
screening  or  'triage'  assessments,  suitable  for  use  by  non-
specialists, used to select those people who require further detailed
assessment  (Boustani  2003).  Various  tools  for  initial  cognitive
screening  have  been  described  (Brodaty  2002;  Folstein  1975;
Galvin 2005). Regardless of the methods employed, there is scope
for  improvement,  with  observational  work  suggesting  that  many
people with dementia are not diagnosed (Chodosh 2004; Valcour
2000). UK national dementia strategies have focused on secondary
(hospital) care, particularly unscheduled admissions, as a setting
where  there  may  be  scope  for  opportunistic  dementia  screening
(Shenkin 2014).

Screening assessment often takes the form of brief, direct cognitive
testing. Such an approach will only provide a 'snapshot' of cognitive
function.  However,  a  defining  feature  of  dementia  is  cognitive  or
neuropsychological  change  over  time.  Patients  themselves  may
struggle to make an objective assessment of personal change, and
so  an  attractive  approach  is  to  question  collateral  sources  with
sufficient  knowledge  of  the  patient.  Informant-based  interviews
have been described that aim to retrospectively assess change in
function. An instrument prevalent in research and clinical practice
is the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly
(IQCODE) (Jorm 1988) and this is the focus of our review.

A number of properties can be described for a clinical assessment
(reliability,  responsiveness,  feasibility);  for  our  purposes  the  test

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

property  of  greatest  interest  is  diagnostic  test  accuracy  (DTA)
(Cordell 2013).

Target condition being diagnosed

The target condition for this diagnostic test accuracy review is all-
cause dementia (clinical diagnosis).

Dementia 
is  a  syndrome  characterised  by  cognitive  or
neuropsychological  decline  sufficient  to  interfere  with  usual
functioning.  The  neurodegeneration  and  clinical  manifestations
of  dementia  are  progressive  and  at  present  there  is  no  'cure',
although  numerous  interventions  to  slow  or  arrest  cognitive
decline  have  been  described,  for  example,  pharmacotherapy
such  as  acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors;  memantine;  or  cognitive
rehabilitation  therapies  (Bahar-Fuchs  2013;  Birks  2006;  McShane
2006).

Dementia remains a clinical diagnosis, based on history from the
patient  and  suitable  collateral  sources,  and  direct  examination
including  cognitive  assessment.  We  have  chosen  expert  clinical
diagnosis as our 'gold standard' (reference standard) for describing
IQCODE  properties,  as  we  believe  this  is  most  in  keeping  with
current  diagnostic  criteria  and  best  practice.  We  recognise  that
there  is  no  universally  accepted,  ante-mortem,  gold  standard
diagnostic strategy. Although some would argue that the true gold
standard  would  be  neuropathological  data,  for  the  purposes  of
testing  diagnostic  accuracy  in  secondary  care,  limiting  analysis
to  those  studies  with  neuropathologically  confirmed  diagnosis
is  likely  to  yield  limited  and  highly  selected  data.  Furthermore,
recent studies have suggested only a modest correlation between
neuropathological  changes  and  clinical  cognitive  phenotype  in
older age. There are several studies that have described cognitive
impairment in 'normal brains' and multiple pathological changes
with  preserved  cognition  (Matthews  2009;  Wharton  2015).  We
also recognise that clinical-neuropathological correlations are less
apparent  in  mixed  dementia  and  older  people,  who  form  the
majority with dementia in the hospital setting (Savva 2009).

in 

Criteria 
line
for  diagnosis  of  dementia  are  evolving 
with  improvements  in  our  understanding  of  the  underlying
pathophysiological  processes.  Various  biomarkers  based  on
biological  fluid  assays  or  functional/quantitative  neuroimaging
have shown promise but to date are not accepted or validated as
independent  diagnostic  tests  (McKhann  2011).  Here  a  distinction
must be made between dementia diagnosis in clinical practice and
dementia  diagnosis  for  clinical  research.  These  novel  biomarker
and  imaging  techniques  may  be  increasingly  used  in  secondary-
care settings and may be stipulated in research diagnostic criteria
but are not absolutely required for clinical diagnosis.

The label of dementia encompasses varying pathologies, of which
Alzheimer’s  disease  is  the  most  common  (Savva  2009).  For  our
reference standard of clinical diagnosis, we accepted a dementia
diagnosis  made  according  to  any  of  the  internationally  accepted
diagnostic  criteria,  with  exemplars  being  the  various  iterations
of  the  World  Health  Organization,  International  Classification  of
Diseases  (ICD)  and  American  Psychiatric  Association  Diagnostic
and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM)  for  all-cause
dementia  and  subtypes  (Appendix  1)  and  the  various  diagnostic
criteria  available  for  specific  dementia  subtypes,  i.e.  NINCDS-
ADRDA  (National  Institute  of  Neurological  and  Communicative
Disorders  and  Stroke  and  the  Alzheimer's  Disease  and  Related

Disorders Association) criteria for Alzheimer’s dementia (McKhann
1984);  McKeith  criteria  for  Lewy  Body  dementia  (McKeith  2005);
Lund  criteria  for  frontotemporal  dementias  (McKhann  2001);  and
the NINDS-AIREN (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke  and  the  Association  Internationale  pour  la  Recherche  et
l'Enseignement  en  Neurosciences)  criteria  for  vascular  dementia
(Erkinjuntti 2000; Roman 1993). We considered all-cause dementia
as the target condition for our primary analysis of diagnostic test
accuracy, recognising that in a selected cohort referred to hospital
services  there  may  be  a  greater  spectrum  of  differing  dementia
pathologies  than  is  seen  in  unselected  community  cohorts.  We
have  not  defined  preferred  diagnostic  criteria  for  rarer  forms  of
dementia (e.g. alcohol-related; HIV-related; prion disease-related),
which were considered under our rubric of 'all-cause dementia' and
were not considered separately.

The  label  'dementia'  can  also  span  a  range  of  disease  severities,
from mild to end-stage disease. We recognise that the diagnostic
properties  of  a  tool  such  as  IQCODE  vary  depending  on  disease
stage; for example, a patient is more likely to screen positive when
disease is advanced and diagnosis is clear. For our primary analysis
we  included  any  dementia  diagnosis  at  any  stage  of  disease.
Definitions pertinent to various stages of the dementia 'journey' are
also  described:  a  preclinical  stage  occurring  years  before  disease
is  manifest,  which  may  be  characterised  by  changes  in  one  or
more disease biomarkers (Sperling 2011); a stage of mild cognitive
impairment  (MCI)  where  problems  with  cognition  are  noticed  by
the patient or others but the disease is not sufficiently advanced
to warrant a diagnostic label of dementia (Albert 2011); and finally
established dementia as defined above (McKhann 2011). We have
not included diagnoses of preclinical and MCI states in this review.

Index test(s)

Our  index  test  was  the  Informant  Questionnaire  on  Cognitive
Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE).

The  IQCODE  was  originally  described  as  a  26-item  informant
questionnaire  that  seeks  to  retrospectively  ascertain  change  in
cognitive and functional performance over a 10-year time period
(Jorm  1988).  IQCODE  is  designed  as  a  brief  screen  for  potential
dementia,  usually  administered  as  a  questionnaire  given  to  the
relevant proxy. For each item the chosen proxy scores change on a
five-point ordinal hierarchical scale, with responses ranging from 1:
'has become much better' to 5: 'has become much worse'. This gives
a sum-score of 26 to 130 that can be averaged by the total number
of completed items to give a final score of 1.0 to 5.0, where higher
scores indicate greater decline.

First described in 1989, use of IQCODE is prevalent in both clinical
practice and research (Holsinger 2007). A literature describing the
properties of IQCODE is available including studies of non-English
IQCODE  translations;  studies  in  specific  patient  populations;  and
modifications  to  the  original  26-item  direct  informant  interview
(Isella  2002;  Jorm  1989;  Jorm  2004).  Versions  of  the  IQCODE
have been produced in other languages, including Chinese, Dutch,
Finnish,  French,  Canadian  French,  German,  Italian,  Japanese,
Korean,  Norwegian,  Polish,  Spanish  and  Thai  (www.anu.edu.au/
iqcode/). A shortened 16-item version is also available (Jorm 1994);
this modified IQCODE is common in clinical practice and has been
recommended as the preferred IQCODE format (Jorm 2004).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

For  this  review  the  term  'IQCODE'  refers  to  the  original  26-
item  questionnaire  as  described  by  Jorm  1988.  Other  versions
of  IQCODE  were  described  according  to  the  number  of  items
and  administration  language  (e.g.  a  16-item  IQCODE  for  Spanish
speakers is described as 'IQCODE-16 Spanish'). Other authors have
also  shortened  the  timeframe  for  assessment  with  a  two-year
version of the IQCODE having been described (Ehrensperger 2010).

Although we describe the utility of IQCODE for dementia diagnosis,
IQCODE used in isolation is not suitable for establishing a clinical
diagnosis.  The  value  of  IQCODE  is  in  selecting  people  who
require  more  definitive  assessment.  Use  of  IQCODE  in  hospital
settings  is  valid,  as  new  diagnostic  criteria  for  dementia  make
explicit reference to documenting decline and involving collateral
informants,  emphasising  the  potential  utility  of  an  informant
interview tool such as IQCODE.

The full 26- and 16-item versions of ICQODE with scoring rules are
available in Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 .

The  purpose  of  this  review  is  to  describe  the  diagnostic  test
accuracy of IQCODE. Other important psychometric properties for
a  tool  that  is  to  be  used  in  clinical  practice  include  reliability,
responsiveness and acceptability. Contemporary reviews of the 26-
and 16-item IQCODE suggest good inter-rater reliability with retest
kappa  0.96  at  three  days  and  0.75  at  one  year  (Jorm  2004;  Tang
2003). Internal consistency is uniformly high with Cronbach’s alpha
in the range 0.93 to 0.97 (Jorm 2004). Validation work has included
validation against measures of cognitive change, neuropathology,
neuroimaging,  and  neuropsychological  assessment  (Cordoliani-
Mackowiak  2003;  Jorm  2000;  Jorm  2004;  Rockwood  1998).
Factor  analysis  suggests  that  the  scale  measures  a  common
factor  of  cognitive  decline 
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010079/full#CD010079-
bbs2-0025#CD010079-bbs2-0025). There are fewer published data
on the psychometric properties of other 'short' forms of IQCODE.

IQCODE cut-off scores suggestive of a potential dementia diagnosis
will  vary  with  the  demographics  of  the  population  tested.  In
the  original  development  and  validation  work,  normative  data
were  described,  with  a  total  score  above  93  or  an  average  score
above 3.31 indicative of cognitive impairment (Jorm 2004). These
data were based on community samples and the thresholds with
greatest  utility  in  a  selected  secondary-care  cohort  may  differ.
There  is  no  consensus  on  the  optimal  threshold  and  various
authors have described improved diagnostic accuracy with other
cut-offs. In setting thresholds for any diagnostic test there is a trade-
off  between  sensitivity  and  specificity,  with  the  preferred  values
partly determined by the purpose of the test. For specialist memory
services,  a  more  sensitive  test  may  be  preferred  as  a  degree  of
filtering  of  non-dementia  diagnoses  will  have  already  occurred.
For general hospital services, where there may be confounders of
delirium or disability, a more specific test may be preferred.

IQCODE has a number of features that make it attractive for clinical
and  research  use,  particularly  in  a  secondary-care  setting.  The
questions have an immediacy and relevance that is likely to appeal
to  users.  Assessment  and  (informant)  scoring  take  around  five
to  seven  minutes  and  as  the  scale  is  not  typically  interviewer-
administered it requires minimal training in application and scoring
(Holsinger  2007).  There  are  data  to  suggest  that,  compared  to
standard  direct  assessments,  IQCODE  may  be  less  prone  to  bias
from cultural norms and previous level of education (Jorm 2004).

Clinical pathway

Dementia develops over a trajectory of several years and screening
tests  may  be  performed  at  different  stages  in  the  dementia
pathway. This review focuses on the secondary-care setting. This is
effectively two related patient populations.

In 'general' secondary-care settings, people will have been referred
for  expert  input  but  not  exclusively  due  to  memory  complaints;
there  may  have  already  been  a  degree  of  cognitive  screening
by  the  referrer.  Opportunistic  screening  of  adults  presenting  as
unscheduled admissions to hospitals would be another secondary-
care pathway.

The  rubric  of  secondary  care  also  includes  those  people  referred
to  dementia/memory-specific  services.  This  population  will  have
a  high  prevalence  of  cognitive  disorders  and  other  physical  and
psychological  health  conditions;  patients  would  be  expected  to
have  had  a  degree  of  cognitive  assessment  prior  to  referral.
However, we recognise there will be no standardised approach to
this pre-referral assessment and real-world studies have indicated
a low level of pre-referral cognitive testing (Fisher 2007).

Alternative test(s)

Several  other  dementia  screening  and  assessment  tools  have
been  described.  Instruments  commonly  used  in  secondary-care
settings include Folstein’s mini-mental state examination (MMSE)
(Folstein 1975); Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine
2005);  and  the  MiniCog  (Borson  2000).  These  performance-based
measures  for  cognitive  screening  all  rely  on  comparing  single
or  multi-domain  cognitive  testing  against  population-specific
normative data. Copyright issues may preclude widespread use of
certain tools.

Other  informant  interviews  are  also  available.  For  example,  the
AD-8  is  an  eight-question  tool,  requiring  dichotomous  responses
(yes or no) and testing for perceived change in memory, problem-
solving, orientation and daily activities (Galvin 2005).

For  this  review  we  focused  on  papers  that  describe  IQCODE
diagnostic  properties,  and  did  not  consider  other  cognitive
screening/assessment  tools.  Where  a  paper  describes  IQCODE
with  an  in-study  comparison  against  another  screening  tool,
we  included  the  IQCODE  data  only.  Where  IQCODE  is  used  in
combination  with  another  cognitive  screening  tool,  we  included
the IQCODE data only.

Rationale

There is no consensus on the optimal screening test for dementia
and the choice is currently dictated by experience with a particular
instrument, time constraints and training. A better understanding
of  the  diagnostic  properties  of  various  strategies  would  allow  for
an informed approach to testing. Critical evaluation of the evidence
base  for  screening  tests  or  other  diagnostic  markers  is  of  major
importance. Without a robust synthesis of the available information
there is the risk that future research, clinical practice and policy will
be built on erroneous assumptions about diagnostic validity. This
is  particularly  pertinent  to  secondary  care  as  healthcare  systems
increasingly see hospital admission as a window for opportunistic
cognitive screening.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

IQCODE  is  commonly  used  in  practice  and  research;  it  is  used
internationally and is one of only a few validated informant-based
screening/diagnostic tools. A literature describing the test accuracy
of IQCODE in different settings is available, although some of these
studies  have  been  modest  in  size. Thus  systematic  review  and,  if
possible, meta-analysis of the diagnostic properties of IQCODE is
warranted.

Although we use the term 'diagnosis' in this review, we recognise
that in practice IQCODE alone is not sufficient to make a diagnosis.
Rather,  IQCODE  can  be  used  to  'triage'  people  presenting  with
memory problems for further assessment or to inform a diagnosis
in conjunction with direct patient assessment and investigations.

This review forms part of a body of work describing the diagnostic
properties  of  commonly-used  dementia  tools.  The  Cochrane
Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group have reviews planned
or underway for other commonly-employed dementia assessment
scales  (Appendix  4)  and  other  IQCODE  reviews  are  completed
(Harrison 2014; Quinn 2014). At present we are conducting single-
test review and meta-analysis. The intention, however, is then to
collate these data, performing an overview allowing comparison of
various test strategies.

O B J E C T I V E S

To  determine  the  accuracy  of  the  informant-based  questionnaire
IQCODE, for detection of dementia in a secondary care setting.

Secondary objectives

Where data were available we planned to describe the following:

1. The  diagnostic  accuracy  of  IQCODE  at  various  prespecified
thresholds.  We  recognise  that  various  thresholds  or  cut-off
scores  have  been  used  to  define  IQCODE  screen-positive
states. We described the properties of IQCODE for the following
cut-off scores (rounded where necessary): 3.6; 3.5; 3.4; 3.3. These
thresholds have been chosen to represent the range of cut-offs
that are commonly used in practice and research; we have been
inclusive in our choice of cut-off to maximise available data for
review.

2. Accuracy  of  IQCODE  for  diagnosis  of  the  commonest  specific

dementia subtype - Alzheimer’s dementia.

3. Effects  of  heterogeneity  on  the  reported  diagnostic  accuracy
of  IQCODE.  Potential  sources  of  heterogeneity  that  we  aimed
to  explore  included:  age  of  cohort;  case  mix  of  cohort;  reason
for  hospital  consultation  (dichotomised  as  'memory'  or  'non-
memory'  services);  technical  features  of  IQCODE;  method  of
dementia diagnosis.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

This  review  forms  part  of  a  suite  of  reviews  describing  IQCODE
accuracy  in  various  healthcare  settings.  We  created  a  generic
strategy for searching; selection; data extraction and analysis that
would  be  applicable  to  all  the  proposed  IQCODE  reviews.  For
consistency  with  the  other  reviews  we  have  used  the  same  text
descriptor in each, except where the methodology is specific to the
setting of interest.

included all such versions of IQCODE, but present separate analysis
limited  to  the  commonest  26-  and  16-item  versions.  A  modified
IQCODE for self assessment has been described (Cullen 2007). As
our interest was informant interviews, we have not included self-
assessment IQCODE in the review.

An  alternative  approach  is  to  perform  the  index  test  and  then
prospectively  follow  people  for  development  of  the  condition
of  interest  defined  using  a  reference  standard.  This  'delayed
verification'  of  dementia  methodology  is  best  suited  to  studies
describing  progression  of  mild  cognitive  impairment  (MCI)  to
dementia and was not considered in this review.

Case-control  studies  are  known  to  potentially  overestimate
properties of a test and we did not include such studies. Similarly
we excluded case studies and samples with small numbers (for the
purposes of this review, we defined 'small numbers' as fewer than
10 participants). Small samples were excluded due to the potential
for bias in selection and lack of representativeness.

Where  settings  were  mixed,  for  example,  a  population  study
'enriched'  with  additional  non-secondary-care  cases,  we  did  not
consider  such  studies  unless  separate  data  were  presented  for
participants from each setting. This design can suffer from similar
biases to a case-control design.

Participants

All adults (aged over 18 years) presenting to secondary care were
eligible.

Our  definition  of  a  secondary-care-based  study  setting  was  one
where  participants  were  referred  to  a  hospital  or  outpatient
specialist  service,  either  due  to  perceived  memory  problems  or
due  to  another  medical  complaint;  they  may  have  had  previous
cognitive  testing.  There  were  no  predefined  exclusion  criteria
relating  to  the  case  mix  of  the  population  studied,  but  this
aspect  of  the  study  was  considered  as  part  of  our  assessment  of
heterogeneity.  Where  there  were  concerns  that  the  participants
were not representative of a secondary-care sample we explored
this at study level using our 'Risk of bias' assessment framework.
Where studies focused on a specific population, for example, stroke
survivors, we described these separately. Recognising that people
referred  to  hospital  for  specific  memory  assessment  may  differ
from those referred to hospital for other complaints, we presented
these two settings separately.

Index tests

Studies had to include (not necessarily exclusively) IQCODE used as
an informant questionnaire.

IQCODE  has  been  translated  into  various  languages  to  allow
international  administration  (Isella  2002).  The  properties  of  a
translated IQCODE in a cohort of non-English speakers may differ
from properties of the original English-language questionnaire. We
collected  data  on  the  principal  language  used  for  IQCODE
assessment in studies to allow for assessment of heterogeneity in
relation to language.

Since its original description, modifications to the administration
of  IQCODE  have  been  described  (Jorm  2004).  Shorter  forms  of
informant questionnaires that test fewer domains are available and
properties  may  differ  from  the  original  26-item  IQCODE  tool.  We

Target conditions

Papers  reporting  any  clinical  diagnosis  of  all-cause  (unspecified)
dementia  were  potentially  eligible  for  inclusion.  Defining  a
particular  dementia  subtype  was  not  required,  although  where
available these data were recorded.

Reference standards

Our  reference  standard  was  clinical  diagnosis  of  dementia.  We
recognise  that  clinical  diagnosis  itself  has  a  degree  of  variability
but this is not unique to dementia studies and does not invalidate
the  basic  diagnostic  test  accuracy  approach.  Clinical  diagnosis
included  all-cause  (unspecified)  dementia,  using  any  recognised
diagnostic  criteria  (for  example,  International  Classification  of
Diseases  Edition  10  (ICD-10);  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual
of  Mental  Disorders  Edition  4  (DSM-IV)).  Dementia  diagnosis  may
specify  a  pathological  subtype  and  all  dementia  subtypes  were
included.  Clinicians  may  use  imaging,  pathology,  or  other  data
to  aid  diagnosis;  however,  we  did  not  include  diagnosis  based
only  on  these  data  without  corresponding  clinical  assessment.
We  recognise  that  different  iterations  of  diagnostic  criteria
may  not  be  directly  comparable  and  that  diagnosis  may  vary
with  the  degree  or  manner  in  which  the  criteria  have  been
operationalised  (e.g.  individual  clinician  versus  algorithm  versus
consensus  determination).  We  set  no  criteria  relating  to  severity
or  stage  of  dementia  diagnosis;  instead  we  classified  any  clinical
diagnosis  of  dementia  (not  mild  cognitive  impairment  or  its
equivalents). We planned to explore stage/severity of dementia as
a potential source of heterogeneity.

Search methods for identification of studies

We used a variety of information sources to ensure that we included
all  relevant  studies.  We  devised  terms  for  electronic  database
searching  in  conjunction  with  the  Trials  Search  Co-ordinator  at
the  Cochrane  Dementia  and  Cognitive  Improvement  Group.  As
part of a body of work looking at cognitive assessment tools, we
created a sensitive search strategy designed to capture dementia
test accuracy papers. We then assessed the output of the searches
to  select  those  papers  that  could  be  pertinent  to  IQCODE,  with
further selection for directly relevant papers and those papers with
a secondary-care focus.

Electronic searches

We  searched  ALOIS,  the  specialised  register  of  the  Cochrane
Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (which includes both
intervention and diagnostic accuracy studies), MEDLINE (Ovid SP),
EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson
Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection (includes
Conference Proceedings Citation Index) (Thomson Reuters Web of
Science), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (Bireme). See Appendix
5 and Appendix 6 for the search strategies run. The final search date
was 28 January 2013.

We  also  searched  sources  specific  to  diagnostic  accuracy  and
healthcare research assessment:

We  applied  no  language  or  date  restrictions  to  the  electronic
searches, and used translation services as necessary.

A single researcher (ANS), with extensive experience of systematic
reviews  from  the  Cochrane  Dementia  and  Cognitive  Impairment
Group,  performed  the  initial  screening  of  the  search  results.  All
subsequent searches of titles/abstracts/papers were performed by
independent paired assessors (TJQ, PF).

Searching other resources

Grey  literature:  We  identified  'grey'  literature  through  searching
of  conference  proceedings,  theses  or  PhD  abstracts  in  EMBASE,
the  Web  of  Science  Core  Collection  and  other  databases  already
specified.

Handsearching: We did not perform handsearching. The evidence
for the benefits of handsearching are not well defined, and we note
that a study specific to diagnostic accuracy studies suggested little
additional benefit of handsearching above a robust initial search
strategy (Glanville 2010).

Reference lists: We checked the reference lists of all relevant studies
and reviews in the field for further possible titles and repeated the
process until we found no new titles (Greenhalgh 2005).

Correspondence:  We  contacted  research  groups  who  have
published  or  are  conducting  work  on  IQCODE  for  dementia
diagnosis, informed by the results of the initial search.

We  searched  for  relevant  studies  in  PubMed,  using  the  'related
article' feature. We examined key studies in the citation databases
of  Science  Citation  Index  and  Scopus  to  ascertain  any  further
relevant studies.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

One  review  author  (ANS)  screened  all  titles  generated  by
initial  electronic  database  searches  for  relevance.  The  initial
search  was  a  sensitive,  generic  search,  designed  to  include  all
potential  dementia  screening  tools.  Two  review  authors  (ANS,
TJQ)  selected  titles  potentially  relevant  to  IQCODE.  Two  review
authors (TJQ, PF) independently conducted all further review and
selection. We reviewed potential IQCODE-related titles, assessing
all  eligible  studies  as  abstracts,  and  potentially  relevant  studies
as  full  manuscripts  against  the  inclusion  criteria.  We  resolved
disagreement  by  discussion,  with  the  potential  to  involve  a  third
review author (DJS) as arbiter if necessary.

We  adopted  a  hierarchical  approach  to  exclusion,  first  excluding
on the basis of index test and reference standard, and then on the
basis of sample size and study data. Finally we assessed all IQCODE
papers with regard to setting.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Where a study may have included useable data but these were not
presented in the published manuscript, or the data presented could
not be extracted to a standard two-by-two table, we contacted the
authors  directly  to  request  further  information  or  source  data.  If
authors did not respond or if the data were not available we did not
include the study (labelled as 'data not suitable for analysis' on the
study flowchart). If the same dataset was presented in more than
one paper we included the primary paper.

We detailed the study selection process in a PRISMA flow diagram.

Data extraction and management

We  extracted  data  to  a  study-specific  pro  forma  that  included
clinical/demographic details of the participants (including details
of reason for hospital referral – 'memory' or 'non-memory'), details
of  IQCODE  administration,  and  details  of  the  dementia  diagnosis
process. We extracted data for all IQCODE studies, before dividing
them by setting (community, primary or secondary). We piloted the
pro forma against two of the included papers before use.

Where IQCODE data were given for a number of cut-off points, we
extracted data for each IQCODE threshold. Where thresholds were
described to two decimal places, we chose the cutpoint closest to
the point of interest (i.e. all scores less than 3.35 would be scored as
3.3, all scores 3.35 or greater would be scored as 3.4). We extracted
data to a standard two-by-two table.

Two  review  authors  (TJQ,  PF)  extracted  data  independently.  The
review authors were based in different centres and were blinded to
each other's data until extraction was complete. We then compared
and  discussed  data  pro  formas  with  reference  to  the  original
papers, resolving disagreements in data extraction by discussion,
with the potential to involve a third review author (DJS) as arbiter
if necessary.

For  each  included  paper,  we  detailed  the  flow  of  participants
(numbers recruited, included, assessed) in a flow diagram.

Assessment of methodological quality

As  well  as  describing  test  accuracy,  an  important  goal  of  the
DTA (diagnostic test accuracy) process is to improve study design
and reporting in dementia diagnostic studies. For this reason, we
assessed both methodological and reporting quality.

We  assessed  the  quality  of  study  reporting  using  the  Standards
for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy studies (STARD) checklist
(Bossuyt  2003)  (Appendix  7).  We  followed  the  guidance  and
principles outlined in the dementia-specific STARDdem extension
to  STARD  grading.  We  present  our  results  under  the  descriptor
STARD,  as  at  time  of  writing  STARDdem  guidance  is  not  yet
published and in the public domain. We advocate use of STARDdem
(Noel-Storr 2014) for the assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies
in dementia henceforth.

We  assessed  the  methodological  quality  of  each  study  using
the  Quality  Assessment  tool  for  Diagnostic  Accuracy  Studies
(QUADAS-2)  tool  (www.bris.ac.uk/quadas/quadas-2).  This  tool
incorporates  domains  specific  to  patient  selection;  index  test;
reference standard; and participant flow. Each domain is assessed
for  risk  of  bias  and  the  first  three  domains  are  also  assessed
for  applicability.  Operational  definitions  describing  the  use  of
QUADAS-2  are  detailed  in  Appendix  8.  To  create  QUADAS-2

anchoring statements specific to studies of dementia test accuracy,
we  convened  a  multidisciplinary  review  of  various  test  accuracy
studies with a dementia reference standard (Davis 2013) (Appendix
9).

The properties of a tool describe behaviour of the instrument under
particular  circumstances.  Thus,  for  our  assessment  of  potential
sources of heterogeneity (where data allowed) we collected data to
inform our prespecified areas of interest:

Paired, independent raters (TJQ and PF or TJQ and JKH), blinded
to each other’s scores, performed both assessments. We resolved
disagreements by further review and discussion, with the potential
to involve a third review author (DJS) as arbiter if necessary.

a) clinical criteria used to reach dementia diagnosis (for example,
ICD-10;  DSM-IV)  and  the  methodology  used  to  reach  dementia
diagnosis (for example, individual assessment; group (consensus)
assessment);

We did not use QUADAS-2 data to form a summary quality score,
but  rather  we  chose  to  present  a  narrative  summary  describing
studies that found high/low/unclear risk of bias/concerns regarding
applicability with corresponding graphical displays.

Statistical analysis and data synthesis

We were principally interested in the test accuracy of IQCODE for the
dichotomous  variable  'dementia/no  dementia'.  Thus,  we  applied
the current DTA framework for analysis of a single test and fitted the
data extracted to a standard two-by-two data table showing binary
test  results  cross-classified  with  a  binary  reference  standard.  We
repeated this process for each IQCODE threshold score described.

We used Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014) to calculate sensitivity,
specificity  and  their  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  from  the
two-by-two  tables  abstracted  from  the  included  studies.  We
present these data graphically in forest plots to allow basic visual
inspection  of  individual  studies  only.  Standard  forest  plots  with
graphical  representation  of  summary  estimates  are  not  suited
to  quantitative  synthesis  of  DTA  data.  Using  software  additional
to  Review  Manager  5  (SAS  release  9.1)  we  used  the  bivariate
method to calculate summary values within each prespecified cut-
off. The bivariate methods (Reitsma 2005) enabled us to calculate
summary  estimates  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  while  correctly
dealing with the different sources of variation: (1) imprecision, by
which sensitivity and specificity have been measured within each
study;  (2)  variation  beyond  chance  in  sensitivity  and  specificity
between  studies;  (3)  any  correlation  that  might  exist  between
sensitivity and specificity. We describe the results for each chosen
threshold as sensitivity and specificity and we estimate all accuracy
measures  with  their  95%  CI.  Where  data  allowed,  we  chose  to
present individual study results graphically by plotting estimates of
sensitivities and specificities in the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC)  space.  We  present  the  summary  sensitivity  and  specificity
points with a 95% confidence region. We have not fitted a ROC curve
as  we  chose  the  bivariate  model  for  the  analysis  rather  than  the
hierarchical  summary  receiver-operator  curve  (HSROC)  method.
We also describe metrics of pooled positive and negative likelihood
ratios. To allow an overview of IQCODE test accuracy, we performed
a  further  analysis:  pooling  data  at  a  common  threshold  (3.3  or
closest), chosen to maximise the data available for inclusion.

Investigations of heterogeneity

Heterogeneity is to be expected in diagnostic test accuracy reviews
and we did not perform formal analysis to quantify it.

b)  technical  features  of  the  testing  strategy.  (version  of  IQCODE
(language); number of items, for example traditional IQCODE; 16-
item 'short' form etc).

c)  reason  for  secondary-care  consultation.  We  dichotomised  this
as attending for 'memory problem' or attending for 'other medical
problem'.

Where  data  allowed  we  performed  pooled  analysis  with  these
factors  as  covariates,  and  compared  results  of  subgroups.  We
prespecified  that  we  would  present  data  from  the  specialised
memory  setting  (memory)  and  general  secondary-care  setting
(non-memory)  separately,  that  we  would  present  data  from
the  traditional  (26  questions)  and  short-form  (16  questions)
IQCODE separately, and that we would present data from studies
using  English  language  IQCODE  against  those  using  non-English-
language versions.

Sensitivity analyses

Where  appropriate  (i.e.  if  not  already  explored  in  our  analyses  of
heterogeneity)  and  as  data  allowed,  we  planned  to  explore  the
sensitivity of any summary accuracy estimates to aspects of study
quality,  guided  by  the  anchoring  statements  developed  in  our
QUADAS-2 exercise. We prespecified sensitivity analysis planned to
exclude studies of low quality (high likelihood of bias) to determine
if  the  results  are  influenced  by  inclusion  of  the  lower-quality
studies;  and  sensitivity  analysis  excluding  studies  that  may  have
unrepresentative populations.

Results of the search

Our search resulted in 16,144 citations, from which we identified 73
full-text papers for eligibility.

We  excluded  60  papers  (Figure  1).  Reasons  for  exclusion  were:
population  not  from  a  secondary-care  setting;  no  IQCODE  data
or  unsuitable  IQCODE  data;  small  numbers  (<  10)  of  included
participants;  no  clinical  diagnosis  of  dementia;  repeat  datasets;
data not suitable for analysis (described in more detail in Selection
of studies) and case-control design (see Characteristics of excluded
studies).

findings 1).

Methodological quality of included studies

We  described  the  risk  of  bias  using  the  QUADAS-2  methodology
(Appendix  8);  our  anchoring  statements  for  the  IQCODE  are
summarised  in  Appendix  9.  We  did  not  rate  any  study  at  low
risk  of  bias  for  all  the  categories  of  QUADAS-2  (Figure  2).  Areas

of  particular  concern  for  bias  were  around:  participant  sampling
procedures (five papers graded low risk, with high rates of unclear
or  inappropriate  sampling  frames  and  inappropriate  exclusions)
and  application  of  index  test  (two  papers  graded  low  risk  of
bias,  with  most  papers  failing  to  prespecify  their  cut-off  for
test  positivity).  There  were  also  concerns  around  applicability,
particularly  concerning  patient  selection  and  index  test.  Only
six  papers  recruited  a  sample  of  representative  secondary-care
attenders,  either  to  a  memory  or  a  non-memory  setting,  and
only five studies provided sufficient detail for their procedure for
conducting the IQCODE for it to be considered consistent with the
original methodology for use in clinical practice.

We  described  reporting  quality  using  the  STARD  guidance
(Appendix 7). There were limitations in reporting across all papers
(Appendix  10).  No  paper  included  all  the  details  recommended
in  the  STARD  statement;  particular  areas  of  study  reporting  that
could be improved were: distribution of severity of disease (three
papers  reported  on  severity  of  dementia);  handling  of  missing
results  (four  papers  explained,  for  example,  how  incomplete
IQCODE questionnaires were scored) and estimates of variability of
diagnostic accuracy (three papers considered variability between
assessors or subgroups of participants).

included  studies 

The  total  number  of  participants  across  the  studies  was
2882  (range:  69  to  576),  of  whom  1413  (49%)  had  a  clinical
dementia  diagnosis.  We  performed  quantitative  synthesis  for
2745  participants,  of  whom  1413  (51%)  had  a  clinical  dementia
diagnosis.  This  excludes  59  participants  with  mild  cognitive
impairment  included  by  Sikkes  2010,  who  was  assessing  the
ability  of  IQCODE  to  diagnose  mild  cognitive  impairment  and
presents data depending on diagnostic group. It also excludes 78
participants from the study by Flicker 1997 who were not assessed
in  the  specialist  memory  clinic  setting,  as  this  paper  presented
differing test accuracy data with respect to assessment location.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

The  included  studies  are  international,  including  datasets  from
eight  countries  (Australia,  China,  Singapore,  Spain,  Switzerland,
Thailand, The Netherlands and the UK).

Nine different versions of IQCODE were used in the included studies
and  10  different  diagnostic  thresholds  (3.3,  3.4,  3.5,  3.6,  3.7,  3.8.
3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2) were used to define a positive IQCODE. We limited
our analysis to the validated forms of IQCODE that are in common
clinical use, i.e. the 26- and 16-item questionnaires. Although Siri
2006 only reported data relating to their 32-item modified IQCODE
at an optimal cut-off of 3.4, the authors supplied data for use of the
26-item IQCODE to facilitate inclusion in the quantitative synthesis.

Within  the  prespecified  thresholds  chosen  for  analysis  there  was
a  spread  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  (sensitivity  range:  71%  to
100%; specificity range: 39% to 88%). Additional Table 1 provides
a summary of test accuracy for each study, using the value closest
to 3.3.

Overview analysis - IQCODE using a 3.3 threshold or closest

From the 13 studies, 2745 participants are included in quantitative
synthesis.  Sensitivity  was  0.91  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  0.86
to 0.94); specificity 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.75). The overall positive
likelihood  ratio  was  2.7  (95%  CI  2.0  to  3.6)  and  the  negative
likelihood ratio was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.22).

The  summary  receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  curve
describing test accuracy across the included studies is presented in

IQCODE 3.3 threshold or closest - comparing 26- and 16-item
IQCODE

We  used  the  overview  dataset  to  examine  the  effect  of
heterogeneity  relating  to  IQCODE  format  (traditional  26-item  or
short-form 16-item).

Analysis of the studies using the 26-item IQCODE (six datasets) gave
sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.94); specificity 0.66 (95% CI 0.49
to 0.80). The overall positive likelihood ratio was 2.6 (95% CI 1.6 to
4.3) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.3).

Analysis of the studies using the 16-item IQCODE (seven datasets)
gave sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.96); specificity 0.66 (95% CI
0.54 to 0.77). The overall positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 (95% CI 1.9
to 3.8) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.1. (95% CI 0.1 to 0.2).

Comparing the two, there were no differences in accuracy with a
relative sensitivity of the 26-item versus 16-item of 0.98 (95% CI 0.89
to 1.07) and relative specificity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.33). (Figure

IQCODE  3.3  threshold:  there  were  four  datasets*  (n  =  722)  that
contained  relevant  data.  The  sensitivity  was  0.96  (95%  CI  0.94  to
0.98);  specificity  0.66  (95%  CI  0.41  to  0.84).  The  overall  positive
likelihood  ratio  was  2.8  (95%  CI  1.5  to  5.5)  and  the  negative
likelihood ratio was 0.1 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.1).

IQCODE 3.4 threshold: there were four datasets* (n = 1211) that
contained  relevant  data.  The  sensitivity  was  0.94  (95%  CI  0.84  to

IQCODE 3.5 threshold: there was only one dataset (n = 269) that
contained  relevant  data.  The  sensitivity  was  0.92  and  specificity
was 0.63; we did not perform quantitative synthesis.

IQCODE 3.6 threshold: there were nine datasets* (n = 1576) that
contained  relevant  data.  The  sensitivity  was  0.89  (95%  CI  0.85  to
0.92);  specificity  0.68  (95%  CI  0.56  to  0.79).  The  overall  positive
likelihood  ratio  was  2.8  (95%  CI  1.9  to  4.0)  and  the  negative
likelihood ratio was 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.2).

Heterogeneity relating to setting

Specialist  memory  setting:  there  were  six  datasets  (n  =  1352)
that  contained  relevant  data.  The  sensitivity  was  0.90  (95%  CI
0.83  to  0.94);  specificity  0.54  (95%  CI  0.44  to  0.64).  The  overall
positive likelihood ratio was 1.9 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.4) and the negative
likelihood ratio was 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.3). The dementia prevalence
ranged from 55% to 87%.

Non-memory  setting:  there  were  three  datasets  (n  =  566)  that
contained  relevant  data.  The  sensitivity  was  0.95  (95%  CI  0.88  to
0.98);  specificity  0.81  (95%  CI  0.71  to  0.88).  The  overall  positive
likelihood  ratio  was  4.9  (95%  CI  3.3  to  7.4)  and  the  negative
likelihood  ratio  was  0.06  (95%  CI  0.02  to  0.2).  The  dementia
prevalence ranged from 11% to 50%.

Comparing  the  two,  there  is  a  significant  difference  in  accuracy
in  the  non-memory  versus  memory  settings  (  P  =  0.019)  which  is
attributable  to  the  higher  specificity  of  the  IQCODE  in  the  non-
memory  setting.  The  relative  sensitivity  of  non-memory  versus
memory  setting  is  1.06  (95%  CI  0.99  to  1.15)  and  the  relative
specificity is 1.49 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.83). (Figure 6)

In  four  studies  (Jorm  1991;  Mackinnon  1998;  Mulligan  1996;
Narasimhalu  2008)  participants  were  recruited  both  in  specialist
memory  and  in  non-memory  secondary-care  settings  and  data
were  not  available  stratified  by  setting,  so  we  could  not  include
them in the quantitative synthesis.

Other sources of heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses

Our  objective  was  to  assess  the  diagnostic  accuracy  of  IQCODE
across the cut-off points commonly used in practice (3.3, 3.4, 3.5,

3.6). However, one study (Goncalves 2011) only reported data at an
IQCODE cut-off of 4.1. We conducted a sensitivity analysis removing
this study, which demonstrated a similar test accuracy (sensitivity
was 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94; specificity 0.66, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.76).

We performed a sensitivity analysis removing those studies which
included participants with a low mean or median age (< 70 years)
(Hancock 2009; Narasimhalu 2008; Sikkes 2010). Test accuracy was
similar  after  exclusion  of  these  studies,  with  an  improvement  in

the specificity of IQCODE (sensitivity was 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.95;
specificity 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.78 at a threshold of 3.3 or closest).

A quantitative analysis of the effect of dementia diagnosis criteria
(reference  standard)  was  not  possible.  Twelve  studies  used  the
American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM), one used the World Health Organization
International  Statistical  Classification  of  Diseases  and  Related
Health  Problems  (ICD)  for  diagnosis,  and  one  used  the  National
Institute  of  Neurological  and  Communicative  Disorders  and
Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association
(NINCDS-ADRDA)  criteria.  Only  one  study  (Jorm  1991)  used  two
diagnostic  criteria.  Jorm  1991  reported  that  using  DSM-III-R  at
an  IQCODE  cut-off  of  3.6,  they  obtained  sensitivity  of  69%  and
specificity  of  80%,  compared  with  using  ICD-10  criteria  which
resulted  in  a  sensitivity  of  80%  and  specificity  of  82%.  As  the
DSM criteria were those most commonly used in other studies, we
included these data for reporting of Jorm 1991.

A further original aim was to describe the accuracy of the IQCODE
for  diagnosis  of  Alzheimer's  disease  dementia.  Although  three
studies reported assessing the IQCODE specifically in people with
Alzheimer's  disease  (Goncalves  2011;  Narasimhalu  2008;  Sikkes
2010), suitable data were only available for two of the three studies
(Narasimhalu 2008; Sikkes 2010) and thus we felt that quantitative
synthesis would be inappropriate.

Two studies specifically assessed the IQCODE in a stroke population
(Narasimhalu  2008;  Tang  2003).  Tang  2003  only  recruited  people
who had experienced a stroke, while in Narasimhalu 2008 they were
a  subgroup  of  the  total  study  population.  However,  data  are  not
presented on IQCODE properties specific to the stroke population
(Narasimhalu 2008) and the small number of studies would make
quantitative synthesis inappropriate.

We  considered  an  investigation  of  heterogeneity  assessing  the
impact of a prespecified IQCODE threshold on test accuracy, from
our QUADAS-2 assessment. However, only two studies (Garcia 2002;
Goncalves  2011)  were  eligible  for  inclusion,  and  so  quantitative
synthesis was not appropriate.

Summary of main results

We  present  a  review  of  the  available  evidence  around  test
accuracy  of  the  Informant  Questionnaire  on  Cognitive  Decline
in  the  Elderly  (IQCODE)  for  dementia  diagnosis  in  hospital/
secondary-care settings. Our quantitative synthesis demonstrates
summary  sensitivity  of  0.91  and  specificity  of  0.66  when  IQCODE
is used across all (undifferentiated) secondary-care settings for the
diagnosis of dementia. The positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 and the
negative likelihood ratio was 0.14; indicating that the IQCODE can
be used as a 'rule-out' test of dementia in a secondary-care setting.
These  results  represent  a  large  dataset,  comprising  data  from  13
international  studies  with  over  2745  participants.  We  limited  our
review  to  studies  concerning  hospital-based  healthcare  systems;
however  even  within  this  focused  setting  there  was  substantial
heterogeneity  and  we  must  be  cautious  in  our  interpretation  of
the pooled data. Across the included papers there was substantial
potential  for  bias  and  issues  with  limited  generalisabilty  and
suboptimal reporting.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

The  prevalence  of  dementia  in  the  included  settings  was  highly
varied,  ranging  from  10.5%  to  87.4%.  This  marked  difference  in
patient  populations  reflects  in  part  the  differing  case  mix  that
potentially can be included under the 'hospital' setting label. We
explored this aspect of heterogeneity with prespecified subgroup
and sensitivity analyses and found a significant difference in test
accuracy  depending  on  whether  the  hospital  setting  described
was a specialist memory service (for example, old-age psychiatry
ward; memory clinic) or a non-memory-specific hospital setting (for
example, an acute admissions ward or general outpatient clinic).
The clinical interpretation of such comparisons is challenging. One
interpretation of these data is that IQCODE as a diagnostic tool may
be  more  suited  to  general  hospital  settings  rather  than  services
with  a  cognitive  focus.  The  pictorial  summary  analysis  (Figure  6)
illustrates that memory and non-memory groups seem to behave
differently and perhaps should be treated as such in future analyses
of  cognitive  test  accuracy.  These  data  come  with  several  caveats
(a  modest  number  of  included  studies;  heterogeneity  within  the
memory/non-memory  groups;  issues  with  potential  for  bias)  but
our  interpretation  has  a  clinical  validity  as  the  case  mix  in  a
specialist  service  designed  for  those  with  suspected  dementias
is  likely  to  be  very  different  to  the  population  presenting  for
assessment  in  an  unscheduled  acute  admissions  or  medicine  for
the  older  adult  ward.  The  difference  between  the  groups  was
most  apparent  in  specificity,  with  the  data  suggesting  better
specificity when IQCODE is used in non-memory settings. We can
speculate on potential reasons for this difference: in the specialist
memory service setting, the high prevalence of depression, either
solely  or  co-existing  with  dementia  (Knapskog  2014)  may  be
an  important  consideration,  as  many  of  the  IQCODE  parameters
are  task-orientated  and  thus  may  be  impacted  by  depressive
symptoms  giving  false  positive  IQCODE  results.  In  separating  the
study  settings  of  memory  and  non-memory  we  recognise  that
differences  between  these  populations  operate  at  many  levels
including potential availability of an informant to complete IQCODE
scoring.

There  is  no  universal  value  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  that  is
considered  'good'  or  'poor';  the  values  that  clinicians  will  accept
as  suitable  for  clinical  use  will  vary  with  the  implications  of  a
false  positive  or  false  negative  result.  In  the  non-memory  (often
acute  hospital)  setting,  delirium  is  prevalent  (Ryan  2013),  either
alone  or  in  association  with  cognitive  impairment  or  dementia,
but opportunities for in-depth patient-dependent cognitive testing
may be limited and the more favourable test accuracy metrics of
IQCODE in this setting are reassuring. It could be argued that the
lower specificity for the instrument in a specialist memory service
is  less  problematic  than  in  other  healthcare  settings,  as  patients
will receive additional assessments as determined by the specialist
clinician  and  are  unlikely  to  be  misdiagnosed  on  the  basis  of  an
IQCODE result alone.

Applying  summary  test  accuracy  data  to  real-world  settings  can
be  illustrative  of  the  potential  strengths  and  limitations  of  a  test
in practice. Applying our non-memory summary data to the acute
hospital admission setting, current UK data estimate around two
million unscheduled admissions annually in the over-65s (Imison
2012) and a dementia prevalence of 42.4% in this group (Sampson
2009).  Using  the  IQCODE  alone  to  screen  for  dementia  would
result  in  42,400  people  with  dementia  not  being  identified  and
218,880  people  without  dementia  being  referred  inappropriately
for  specialist  assessment.  Both  false  positive  and  false  negative

results  have  potential  for  harm.  It  is  not  certain  that  those
whose  dementia  is  missed  with  IQCODE  will  eventually  receive
a  diagnosis  and  opportunities  for  early  intervention  may  be
lost,  while  inappropriately  labelling  a  person  as  having  cognitive
decline  based  on  IQCODE  will  also  be  associated  with  potential
psychological harm and economic implications of need for further
investigation. We acknowledge that the UK NHS-based figures we
quote  may  not  be  applicable  to  other  countries  or  healthcare
systems.  We  have  presented  UK  data  in  this  review  as  we
have  access  to  reasonably  robust  input  data  and  their  inclusion
illustrates  important  points  about  the  real-world  implications  of
our summary test accuracy data

Our  results  do  not  indicate  an  optimal  cut-off  for  the  IQCODE  in
a hospital setting. A range of diagnostic thresholds were reported
with  significant  overlap  between  the  included  studies,  with  the
commonest diagnostic threshold being 3.6; this is higher than the
IQCODE  cut-offs  employed  when  the  tool  is  used  in  community
settings. Only one study reported data using a cut-off outside our
prespecified  range  of  3.3  to  3.6  (Goncalves  2011;  cut-off  4.1)  To
allow us to use the maximum available data we included these data
in our summary analysis, with a sensitivity analysis demonstrating
no significant effect of excluding them.

We recognise that IQCODE can be applied using various methods
and we prespecified analyses to try and describe the effects on test
accuracy.  Our  finding  of  no  difference  in  the  diagnostic  accuracy
between assessments conducted in the English language and those
conducted in six other languages (grouped together as 'non-English
language' to allow analysis) is reassuring, and supports the cross-
cultural use of IQCODE. Similarly, the length of instrument (26-item
versus 16-item) had no significant effect on test accuracy, a result
in  keeping  with  previous  narrative  review  findings  in  Jorm  2004
and  with  previous  review  of  IQCODE  properties  when  used  in  a
community setting (Quinn 2014).

Since  IQCODE  was  originally  designed  for  use  in  the  older  adult
population, we felt it was important to ensure that a tool used to
aid  the  diagnosis  of  dementia  would  be  robust  to  the  difficulties
of  assessment  in  younger  age  groups  with  potential  early-onset
dementia  (Vieira  2013).To  explore  age  effects,  we  performed  a
sensitivity  analysis  removing  studies  with  a  low  average  age  of
included  participants,  and  found  test  accuracy  to  be  broadly
similar.

We prespecified two other analyses based on diagnostic features.
We  accepted  any  validated  clinical  assessment  system  for
our  reference  standard  of  dementia  diagnosis  but  recognised
that  differing  classifications  operationalise  dementia  in  slightly
different ways. One included study used two diagnostic criteria in
direct comparison (Jorm 1991). Using the same cut-off of 3.6, the
DSM III-R resulted in a sensitivity of 0.69 and a specificity of 0.80
compared  with  ICD-10  which  produced  a  sensitivity  of  0.80  and
specificity  of  0.82.  As  the  majority  of  the  other  included  studies
used  DSM  criteria  only,  it  was  not  possible  to  further  describe
any potential effect of diagnostic criteria on IQCODE accuracy. As
a  recognition  of  the  different  effects  that  subtypes  of  dementia
have  on  the  individual  (Gure  2010),  we  felt  it  was  reasonable  to
analyse the diagnostic properties of IQCODE with respect to specific
subtypes  of  dementia.  It  had  previously  been  demonstrated  that
the IQCODE performs differently in people with Alzheimer's disease
dementia and those with frontotemporal dementia (Larner 2010).
However, there was a lack of data available on dementia pathology

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

in the included studies in our review and we were unable to offer
subgroup analysis by dementia subtype.

Our 'Risk of bias' assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool identified
significant potential for bias in the included studies as described
below. Given the modest number of included studies, we did not
perform subgroup or sensitivity analyses to quantitatively explore
these effects for each QUADAS-2 domain.

Strengths and weaknesses of the review

Strengths and weaknesses of included studies

Our  QUADAS-2  and  STARD  assessments  suggested  potential
problems  of  bias,  poor  generalisability  and  suboptimal  reporting
across  the  included  studies.  Areas  of  particular  concern  are
highlighted  in  the  text  of  the  Characteristics  of  included  studies
table and summarised in Figure 2.

A  key  aspect  of  our  QUADAS-2  assessments  was  establishing
whether  authors  prespecified  the  cut-off  used  to  define  IQCODE
positivity. Where authors calculate test accuracy across the range
of  potential  IQCODE  thresholds,  they  are  not  reflecting  clinical
practice,  and  test  accuracy  may  be  inflated  if  only  the  best-
performing cutpoints are reported. Thus, where cutpoints were not
prespecified, we classified the paper as being at high risk of bias
for the conduct of the index test. Only two of our included studies
(Garcia 2002; Goncalves 2011) were deemed to be at low risk of bias
for this domain.

In  order  that  the  findings  of  our  analysis  are  applicable  in
practice  it  is  essential  that  the  recruited  participants  to  the
included  studies  are  representative.  Details  about  sampling
procedures, particularly non-consecutive or non-random samples
being  recruited  and  studies  inappropriately  excluding  those  with
relevant  co-morbidities,  were  an  area  of  concern  in  our  'Risk
of  bias'  assessment.  A  further  concern  about  using  the  IQCODE
is  that  it  relies  on  the  assessment  of  an  informant,  and  not
all  patients  have  someone  who  can  fulfil  this  role.  Four  of  the
included  studies  only  recruited  participants  where  an  informant
was  present  at  the  consultation  (Garcia  2002;  Goncalves  2011;
Hancock  2009;  Sikkes  2010).  The  significance  of  attending  the
memory clinic unaccompanied has previously been demonstrated
to  be  a  specific  predictor  of  the  individual  not  having  a  clinical
diagnosis of dementia (Larner 2009). Nonetheless, reliance on an
informant  is  a  relevant  factor  when  considering  test  accuracy  as
a screening tool, as those studies did not recruit participants who
attended unaccompanied. One author adopted a broader approach
and permitted the completion of the IQCODE by post or telephone
(Harwood 1997).

We  wanted  to  ensure  that  case-control  methodologies  were  not
included in this review, given the propensity to falsely estimate test
accuracy, as the prevalence has been artificially fixed. One of the
included studies (Siri 2006) reported exactly equivalent numbers of
those with dementia and those without (n = 100). The methodology
described  does  not  suggest  that  a  case-control  design  was  used,
but there is a lack of detail as to how the final sample was obtained.

Reporting  quality  impacts  on  the  'Risk  of  bias'  assessment  as,
where procedures are not fully described, this limits the potential
for judging the rigor of the methodology. The STARD assessments
revealed  a  lack  of  reporting  around  disease  severity  and  the
handling of indeterminate results. Both of these have implications

for  the  use  of  the  tool  in  clinical  practice.  None  of  the  included
studies  reported  properties  of  IQCODE  in  relation  to  disease
severity  or  stage.  Intuitively  test  properties  will  differ  comparing
subtle,  early  dementia  with  later  stage  advanced  disease;  the
optimal cut-off may also change as the disease progresses.

Strengths and weaknesses of review process

In common with the other reviews in the suite (Harrison 2014; Quinn
2014), the review benefits from a structured and thorough search
strategy  created  and  conducted  by  an  experienced  Trials  Search
Co-ordinator.  We  adopted  an  inclusive  approach  and  identified
relevant studies in a formal and standardised manner. We recognise
that our search was performed in January 2013 and this may have
led to the potential exclusion of relevant studies published more
recently. Quality assessment was guided by our dementia-specific
QUADAS-2  anchoring  statements  which  were  devised  for  use  in
diagnostic  test  accuracy  studies  that  compare  a  cognitive  index
test and clinical reference standard (Davis 2013). In addition, our
quality  assessment  was  complemented  by  formal  assessment  of
reporting quality using the STARD methodology (Appendix 7), an
approach  which  has  been  shown  to  add  rigor  in  test  accuracy
evaluation  (Oliveira  2011).  Had  it  been  available  at  the  time  of
analysis, the dementia-specific STARDdem guidance on reporting
may  have  better  described  the  challenges  inherent  in  reporting
research around dementia tests (Noel-Storr 2014).

We were inclusive in our initial search of the literature and assessed
study  reports  which  were  not  available  in  English,  making  use  of
translation services to facilitate study selection and data extraction.
Although only one paper written in Spanish met the final inclusion
criteria,  this  approach  meant  studies  were  not  inappropriately
excluded due to their language of presentation.

Contacting  study  authors  was  highly  productive,  allowing  for
clarification of methodology, for example, to ensure case-control
designs  were  not  included;  updating  citations  identified  as
abstracts  to  allow  for  the  subsequent  full-text  publications  to  be
cited; and provision of data in a format suitable for inclusion in the
quantitative synthesis.

Our  review  question  was  focused  to  facilitate  the  assessment  of
the test properties of IQCODE in a secondary-care setting. Where
a  study  included  a  non-secondary-care  setting,  we  excluded  the
data from this review but considered them for reviews of IQCODE
in other healthcare settings. We excluded studies concerned with
the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment from our quantitative
synthesis, as our objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy
of IQCODE for the diagnosis of dementia. We prespecified a series
of  subgroup  and  sensitivity  analyses  to  look  at  hospital  settings,
IQCODE  application  and  dementia  diagnosis.  Not  all  of  these
analyses were possible due to limited data; we were mindful of not
over-analysing  what  was  a  modest  dataset  and  did  not  perform
post hoc analyses or analyses relating to QUADAS-2 domains.

Comparisons with previous research

Our findings are in keeping with reviews assessing the test accuracy
of the IQCODE in other healthcare settings. In the review describing
IQCODE as used in the community setting, summary sensitivity was
0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.85) and specificity was
0.84  (95%  CI  0.78  to  0.90).  In  the  community  review,  the  form  of
IQCODE (26 versus 16 items) similarly had no effect on accuracy and
there was no obvious optimal cut-off for IQCODE across the range

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

3.3 to 3.6 (Quinn 2014). The third in the suite of IQCODE reviews,
assessing accuracy in primary care, had no quantitative synthesis
as we found only one relevant study (Harrison 2014). The IQCODE
has  been  assessed  in  comparison  to  other  informant  or  self-
completed instruments, although without presenting quantitative
synthesis  (Cherbuin  2008).  Other  authors  have  concluded  that  a
combined approach of tools, often with direct patient assessment
and informant assessment, is required in view of the complexity of
diagnosis and disease subtypes (Stephan 2010; Cullen 2007).

Applicability of findings to the review question

Our  focused  review  question  concerned  the  accuracy  of  IQCODE
for  dementia  diagnosis  in  a  secondary-care/hospital  setting.  We
believe  our  robust  search  and  clear  operationalisation  of  the
hospital  setting  have  allowed  us  to  comprehensively  collate  all
available  evidence  on  this  question.  Although  the  number  of
included  studies  was  modest  with  substantial  heterogeneity,  we
were still able to offer quantitative summary analyses of IQCODE
test accuracy.

Implications for practice

From  its  inception,  the  IQCODE  was  intended  as  a  screening  test
designed  to  detect  deterioration  in  cognition  with  less  potential
bias from educational attainment (Jorm 1988). As such, it has never
purported to be able to diagnose dementia per se; instead its value
was in indicating those who have features suggestive of new-onset
cognitive decline who merit further specialist assessment. With this
in mind and based on our summary data, the use of IQCODE as an
initial assessment of older adults in general hospital settings seems
reasonable. Our data offer less support for the utility of IQCODE as a
diagnostic tool in hospital settings that have a cognition/dementia
focus, albeit it seems unlikely that IQCODE would be used as the
sole diagnostic instrument in such settings.

Although  the  focus  of  our  review  was  specific  to  test  accuracy,  it
is  worth  emphasising  that  IQCODE  has  other  features  that  make
it  attractive  for  clinical  use.  IQCODE  offers  a  practical  insight
into  the  impacts  of  cognitive  impairment  on  the  individual  from
the  perspective  of  an  informant.  Although  people  may  complain
of  subjective  memory  loss,  many  do  not  notice  their  cognitive
deficits  and,  crucially,  the  impacts  on  their  daily  life  (Derouesné
1999).  IQCODE  may  allow  a  greater  degree  of  perspective  on  the
functional impairments arising from cognitive decline, and this in
turn may help guide therapy and intervention. These advantages
could  equally  apply  to  other  multi-item  informant  assessment
tools, and it is important to recognise that the IQCODE is not the
only informant tool for dementia screening. Other such tools are
increasingly  used,  particularly  in  North  America,  for  example  the
AD-8 (Galvin 2005), with reviews of these tools planned or underway
(Hendry 2014).

The simplest approach to cognitive screening is the use of single-
question  tools  which  ask  the  patient  or  informant  if  they  have
noticed  any  memory-related  problems.  In  the  UK  NHS  a  single-
question  screening  assessment  is  recommended  for  all  older
adults admitted to hospital (Hendry 2015). Informant reports have
been  described  as  superior  (Carr  2000).  This  has  led  to  some
recommending  the  use  of  a  single-informant  response  ahead  of
structured  tools  such  as  the  IQCODE  as  a  means  of  screening,

due to the lesser burden of a single question (Ayalon 2011) These
approaches, however, have largely been tested for the detection of
mild  dementia  or  cognitive  impairment,  whereas  the  secondary-
care population includes the spectrum of disease severity.

memory setting, it is essential that future diagnostic test accuracy
studies  present  results  stratified  by  the  recruitment  setting  of
included  participants,  and  consider  these  two  populations  as
discrete entities.

Although our review considers the test accuracy of the IQCODE, we
are  not  able  to  present  data  on  the  acceptability  or  feasibility  of
using the tool in this setting. Of particular relevance to secondary
care  is  the  means  of  IQCODE  completion  and  how  obtaining  an
appropriate  informant  account  can  be  operationalised  in  busy
acute hospital environments. It has been previously noted that the
relationship of the informant to the patient is important in ensuring
responses  are  reliable  over  the  10-year  time  course  (Jorm  2004).
Other means of completion include by telephone or by post. Postal
completion  methods  are  associated  with  missing  data  (Smeeth
2001)  and  may  lead  to  delays  in  obtaining  data.  In  small-scale
studies  with  dedicated  research  assistants  IQCODE  completion
rates  have  been  around  80%  (Lees  2013),  but  numbers  may  be
considerably less where the IQCODE assessment is part of routine
care.

Implications for research

In  view  of  the  significant  difference  in  diagnostic  accuracy  using
the  IQCODE  in  a  specialist  memory  setting  compared  to  a  non-

Research into the feasibility and acceptability of the instrument is
also needed to allow us to define the potential role of IQCODE in the
clinical  pathway  for  assessing  individuals  for  dementia.  Patients'
and  carers'  experiences  of  cognitive  screening  and  the  impact  of
test results have not been well described and more research in this
field would help inform test strategy.

Study characteristics

Patient Sampling

Patient characteristics and setting

Participants were recruited as part of a study investigating the reliability and
validity of the Canberra Interview for the Elderly (CIE); recruited as a consec-
utive series. An additional non-consecutive group were recruited elsewhere
(principally psychogeriatricians)

Patients were a series of those assessed by geriatricians as inpatients, day-
hospital attenders or outpatient clinic attenders (n = 64). As the authors were
interested in assessing the score in depression, they also recruited a subgroup
of patients, principally via psychogeriatricians (n = 12). Study conducted in
Canberra Australia

Index tests

IQCODE 26 item, English language

Target condition and reference standard(s)

Clinical dementia diagnosis using DSM-III-R and ICD-10

Flow and timing

Of 72 potential participants from the geriatric settings 64 agreed to partici-
pate. 12 patients were recruited from other sources. Of the 76 potential partic-
ipants, 7 were excluded due to missing data (index test or MMSE) so total sam-
ple was 69.

Reference standard determined by the treating clinician. Index test adminis-
tered by lay interviewers at an interval afterwards. Unclear if this was blinded
to clinical diagnosis. Further index test assessment performed to assess test-
retest reliability

Appendix 1. WHO International Classification of Disease - Dementia

World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases 10

F00 - F09 ORGANIC, INCLUDING SYMPTOMATIC, MENTAL DISORDERS

DEMENTIA

G1. Evidence of each of the following:

(1) A decline in memory, which is most evident in the learning of new information, although in more severe cases, the recall of previously
learned  information  may  be  also  affected.  The  impairment  applies  to  both  verbal  and  non-verbal  material.  The  decline  should  be
objectively verified by obtaining a reliable history from an informant, supplemented, if possible, by neuropsychological tests or quantified
cognitive assessments. The severity of the decline, with mild impairment as the threshold for diagnosis, should be assessed as follows:

Mild: a degree of memory loss sufficient to interfere with everyday activities, though not so severe as to be incompatible with independent
living. The main function affected is the learning of new material. For example, the individual has difficulty in registering, storing and
recalling elements in daily living, such as where belongings have been put, social arrangements, or information recently imparted by family
members.

Moderate: A degree of memory loss which represents a serious handicap to independent living. Only highly learned or very familiar material
is retained. New information is retained only occasionally and very briefly. The individual is unable to recall basic information about where
he lives, what he has recently been doing, or the names of familiar persons.

Severe: a degree of memory loss characterized by the complete inability to retain new information. Only fragments of previously learned
information remain. The subject fails to recognise even close relatives.

(2) A decline in other cognitive abilities characterized by deterioration in judgement and thinking, such as planning and organizing, and in
the general processing of information. Evidence for this should be obtained when possible from interviewing an informant, supplemented,
if possible, by neuropsychological tests or quantified objective assessments. Deterioration from a previously higher level of performance
should be established. The severity of the decline, with mild impairment as the threshold for diagnosis, should be assessed as follows:

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Mild. The decline in cognitive abilities causes impaired performance in daily living, but not to a degree making the individual dependent
on others. More complicated daily tasks or recreational activities cannot be undertaken.

Moderate.  The  decline  in  cognitive  abilities  makes  the  individual  unable  to  function  without  the  assistance  of  another  in  daily  living,
including shopping and handling money. Within the home, only simple chores are preserved. Activities are increasingly restricted and
poorly sustained.

Severe. The decline is characterized by an absence, or virtual absence, of intelligible ideation. The overall severity of the dementia is best
expressed as the level of decline in memory or other cognitive abilities, whichever is the more severe (e.g. mild decline in memory and
moderate decline in cognitive abilities indicate a dementia of moderate severity).

G2. Preserved awareness of the environment during a period of time long enough to enable the unequivocal demonstration of G1. When
there are superimposed episodes of delirium the diagnosis of dementia should be deferred.

G3. A decline in emotional control or motivation, or a change in social behaviour, manifest as at least one of the following:

(1) emotional lability;

(2) irritability;

(3) apathy;

(4) coarsening of social behaviour.

G4. For a confident clinical diagnosis, G1 should have been present for at least six months; if the period since the manifest onset is shorter,
the diagnosis can only be tentative.

Comments: The diagnosis is further supported by evidence of damage to other higher cortical functions, such as aphasia, agnosia, apraxia.

Judgment about independent living or the development of dependence (upon others) need to take account of the cultural expectation
and context.

Dementia is specified here as having a minimum duration of six months to avoid confusion with reversible states with identical behavioural
syndromes, such as traumatic subdural haemorrhage (S06.5), normal pressure hydrocephalus (G91.2) and diffuse or focal brain injury
(S06.2 and S06.3).

A fifth character may be used to indicate the presence of additional symptoms, in the categories F00-F03

(F00 Dementia in Alzheimer's disease; F01 Vascular dementia; F02 Dementia in diseases classified elsewhere; and

F03 Unspecified dementia), as follows:

.x0 without additional symptoms

.x1 with other symptoms, predominantly delusional

.x2 with other symptoms, predominantly hallucinatory

.x3 with other symptoms, predominantly depressive

.x4 with other mixed symptoms

A sixth character may be used to indicate the severity of the dementia:

.xx0 mild

.xx1 moderate

.xx2 severe

As mentioned above the overall severity of the dementia depends on the level of memory or intellectual impairment, whichever is the
more severe.

F00 DEMENTIA IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

A. The general criteria for dementia (G1 to G4) must be met.

B.  There  is  no  evidence  from  the  history,  physical  examination  or  special  investigations  for  any  other  possible  cause  of  dementia
(e.g.  cerebrovascular  disease,  Parkinson's  disease,  Huntington's  disease,  normal  pressure  hydrocephalus),  a  systemic  disorder  (e.g.
hypothyroidism, vit. B12 or folic acid deficiency, hypercalcaemia), or alcohol- or drug-abuse.

Comments: The diagnosis is confirmed by post mortem evidence of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in excess of those found
in normal ageing of the brain.

The following features support the diagnosis, but are not necessary elements: Involvement of cortical functions as evidenced by aphasia,
agnosia or apraxia; decrease of motivation and drive, leading to apathy and lack of spontaneity; irritability and disinhibition of social
behaviour; evidence from special investigations that there is cerebral atrophy, particularly if this can be shown to be increasing over time.
In severe cases there may be Parkinson-like extrapyramidal changes, logoclonia, and epileptic fits.

Specification  of  features  for  possible  subtypes.  Because  of  the  possibility  that  subtypes  exist,  it  is  recommended  that  the  following
characteristics  be  ascertained  as  a  basis  for  a  further  classification:  age  at  onset;  rate  of  progression;  the  configuration  of  the  clinical
features, particularly the relative prominence (or lack) of temporal, parietal or frontal lobe signs; any neuropathological or neurochemical
abnormalities, and their pattern.

The division of AD into subtypes can at present be accomplished in two ways: first by taking only the age of onset and labelling AD as either
early or late, with an approximate cut-off point at 65 years; or secondly, by assessing how well the individual conforms to one of the two
putative syndromes, early or late onset type. It should be noted that it is unlikely that a sharp distinction exists between early and late
onset type. Early onset type may occur in late life, just as late onset type may occasionally have an onset under the age of 65. The following
criteria may be used to differentiate F00.0 from F00.1, but it should be remembered that the status of this subdivision is still controversial.

F00.0 Dementia in Alzheimer's disease with early onset

1. The criteria for dementia in Alzheimer's disease (F00) must be met, and the age at onset being under 65 years.

2. In addition, at least one of the following requirements must be met:

(a) evidence of a relatively rapid onset and progression;

(b) in addition to memory impairment, there is aphasia (amnesic or sensory), agraphia, alexia, acalculia, or apraxia (indicating the presence
of temporal, parietal and/or frontal lobe involvement).

F00.1 Dementia in Alzheimer's disease with late onset

1. The criteria for dementia in Alzheimer's disease (F00) must be met and the age at onset must be 65 or more.

2. In addition, at least one of the following requirements must be met:

(a) evidence of a very slow, gradual onset and progression (the rate of the latter may be known only retrospectively after a course of 3
years or more);

(b) predominance of memory impairment G1.1, over intellectual impairment G1.2 (see general criteria for dementia).

F00.2 Dementia in Alzheimer's disease, atypical or mixed type

Use this term and code for dementias that have important atypical features or that fulfil criteria for both early and late onset type of
Alzheimer's disease. Mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia is also included here.

F00.9 Dementia in Alzheimer's disease, unspecified

F01 VASCULAR DEMENTIA

G1. The general criteria for dementia (G1 to G4) must be met.

G2. Unequal distribution of deficits in higher cognitive functions, with some affected and others relatively spared. Thus memory may be
quite markedly affected while thinking, reasoning and information processing may show only mild decline.

G3. There is clinical evidence of focal brain damage, manifest as at least one of the following:

(1) unilateral spastic weakness of the limbs;

(2) unilaterally increased tendon reflexes;

(3) an extensor plantar response;

(4) pseudobulbar palsy.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

G4. There is evidence from the history, examination, or tests, of a significant cerebrovascular disease, which may reasonably be judged to
be etiologically related to the dementia (e.g. a history of stroke; evidence of cerebral infarction).

The following criteria may be used to differentiate subtypes of vascular dementia, but it should be remembered that the usefulness of this
subdivision may not be generally accepted.

F01.0 Vascular dementia of acute onset

A. The general criteria for vascular dementia (F01) must be met.

B. The dementia develops rapidly (i.e. usually within one month, but within no longer than three months) after a succession of strokes,
or (rarely) after a single large infarction.

F01.1 Multi-infarct dementia

A. The general criteria for vascular dementia (F01) must be met.

B. The onset of the dementia is gradual (i.e. within three to six months), following a number of minor ischaemic episodes.

Comments: It is presumed that there is an accumulation of infarcts in the cerebral parenchyma. Between the ischaemic episodes there
may be periods of actual clinical improvement.

F01.2 Subcortical vascular dementia

A. The general criteria for vascular dementia (F01) must be met.

B. A history of hypertension.

C.  Evidence  from  clinical  examination  and  special  investigations  of  vascular  disease  located  in  the  deep  white  matter  of  the  cerebral
hemispheres, with preservation of the cerebral cortex.

F01.3 Mixed cortical and subcortical vascular dementia

Mixed  cortical  and  subcortical  components  of  the  vascular  dementia  may  be  suspected  from  the  clinical  features,  the  results  of
investigations (including autopsy), or both.

F01.8 Other vascular dementia

F01.9 Vascular dementia, unspecified

F02 DEMENTIA IN OTHER DISEASES CLASSIFIED ELSEWHERE

F02.0 Dementia in Pick's disease

A. The general criteria for dementia (G1 to G4) must be met.

B. Slow onset with steady deterioration.

C. Predominance of frontal lobe involvement evidenced by two or more of the following:

(1) emotional blunting;

(2) coarsening of social behaviour;

(3) disinhibition;

(4) apathy or restlessness;

(5) aphasia.

D. Relative preservation, in the early stages, of memory and parietal lobe functions.

F02.1 Dementia in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

A. The general criteria for dementia (G1 to G4) must be met.

B. Very rapid progression of the dementia, with disintegration of virtually all higher cerebral functions.

C. The emergence, usually after or simultaneously with the dementia, of one or more of the following types of neurological symptoms and
signs:

(1) pyramidal symptoms;

(2) extrapyramidal symptoms;

(3) cerebellar symptoms;

(4) aphasia;

(5) visual impairment.

Comments: An akinetic and mute state is the typical terminal stage. An amyotrophic variant may be seen, where the neurological signs
precede the onset of the dementia. A characteristic electroencephalogram (periodic spikes against a slow and low voltage background), if
present in association with the above clinical signs, will increase the probability of the diagnosis. However, the diagnosis can be confirmed
only by neuropathological examination (neuronal loss, astrocytosis, and spongiform changes). Because of the risk of infection, this should
be carried out only under special protective conditions.

F02.2 Dementia in Huntington's disease

A. The general criteria for dementia (G1 to G4) must be met.

B. Subcortical functions are affected first and dominate the picture of dementia throughout; manifest as slowness of thinking or movement
and personality alteration with apathy or depression.

C. Presence of involuntary choreiform movements, typically of the face, hands or shoulders, or in the gait. The patient may attempt to
conceal them by converting them into a voluntary action.

D. A history of Huntington's disease in one parent or a sibling; or a family history which suggests the disorder.

E. The absence of clinical features otherwise accounting for the abnormal movements.

Comments:  In  addition  to  involuntary  choreiform  movements  there  may  be  development  of  extrapyramidal  rigidity  or  spasticity  with
pyramidal signs.

F02.3 Dementia in Parkinson's disease

A. The general criteria for dementia (G1 to G4) must be met.

B. Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

C. Absence of cognitive impairment attributable to anti-parkinsonian medication.

D. There is no evidence from the history, physical examination or special investigations for any other possible cause of dementia, including
other forms of brain disease, damage or dysfunction (e.g. cerebrovascular disease, HIV disease, Huntington's disease, normal pressure
hydrocephalus), a systemic disorder (e.g. hypothyroidism, vit. B12 or folic acid deficiency, hypercalcaemia), or alcohol or drug abuse.

If criteria are also fulfilled for dementia in Alzheimer's disease with late onset (F00.1), this category F00.1 should be used in combination
with Parkinson's disease G20.

F02.4 Dementia in human immunodeficiency (HIV) disease

A. The general criteria for dementia (G1 to G4) must be met.

B. Diagnosis of HIV infection.

C. There is no evidence from the history, physical examination or special investigations for any other possible cause of dementia, including
other forms of brain disease, damage or dysfunction (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's
disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus), a systemic disorder (e.g. hypothyroidism, vit. B12 or folic acid deficiency, hypercalcaemia), or
alcohol or drug abuse.

Dementia can occur as a manifestation or consequence of a variety of cerebral and somatic conditions. To specify the etiology, the ICD-10
code for the underlying condition should be added.

F03 UNSPECIFIED DEMENTIA

This category should be used when the general criteria for dementia are met, but when it is not possible to identify one of the specific
types (F00.0-F02.9).

Instructions: Now we want you to remember what your friend or relative was like 10 years ago and to compare it with what he/she is like
now. 10 years ago was 19__. On the next page are situations where this person has to use his/her memory or intelligence and we want you
to indicate whether this has improved, stayed the same or got worse than in that situation over the past 10 years. Note the importance of
comparing his/her present performance with 10 years ago. So if 10 years ago this person always forgot where he/she had left things and
he/she still does this, then this would be considered ‘Not much change’. Please indicate the changes you have observed by circling the
appropriate answer.

Appendix 3. Sixteen-item IQCODE

Instructions: Now we want you to remember what your friend or relative was like 10 years ago and to compare it with what he/she is like
now. 10 years ago was 19__. On the next page are situations where this person has to use his/her memory or intelligence and we want you
to indicate whether this has improved, stayed the same or got worse than in that situation over the past 10 years. Note the importance of
comparing his/her present performance with 10 years ago. So if 10 years ago this person always forgot where he/she had left things and
he/she still does this, then this would be considered ‘Not much change’. Please indicate the changes you have observed by circling the
appropriate answer.

Search strategy (MEDLINE Ovid SP) run for specialised register (ALOIS)

Search narrative: The searches detailed above are very simple, single concept strategies based on the index test (IQCODE). This is a sensitive
approach to take. More complex and developed searches are run each month for the dementia group.
Every month the following strategy is run inMedline (via Ovid SP), with similar strategies run in Embase (via Ovid SP) and PsycINFO (via
Ovid SP). The results are screened based on a reading of title and abstract. The full texts (where there is one) are then obtained and a few
key details about each study are extracted including Index test/s and details of population and setting. For this review it was
expected that most studies would be identified through a search of multiple sources based on one concept (the index test in question).
However, we felt it was worth also searching ALOIS for any studies which had evaluated the accuracy of IQCODE but had not referred to
it in the title or abstract of the reference.

The study population: The inclusion and exclusion criteria, setting and loca-
tions where data were collected.

Participant recruitment: Was recruitment based on presenting symptoms, re-
sults from previous tests, or the fact that the participants had received the in-
dex tests or the reference standard?

Participant sampling: Was the study population a consecutive series of partic-
ipants defined by the selection criteria in item 3 and 4? If not, specify how par-
ticipants were further selected.

Data collection: Was data collection planned before the index test and ref-
erence standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective
study)?

The reference standard and its rationale.

Technical specifications of material and methods involved including how and
when measurements were taken, and/or cite references for index tests and ref-
erence standard.

Definition of and rationale for the units, cut-offs and/or categories of the re-
sults of the index tests and the reference standard.

The number, training and expertise of the persons executing and reading the
index tests and the reference standard.

Whether or not the readers of the index tests and reference standard were
blind (masked) to the results of the other test and describe any other clinical
information available to the readers.

Methods for calculating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy, and
the statistical methods used to quantify uncertainty (e.g. 95% confidence in-
tervals).

Methods for calculating test reproducibility, if done.

When study was performed, including beginning and end dates of recruitment.

Clinical and demographic characteristics of the study population (at least in-
formation on age, gender, spectrum of presenting symptoms).

The number of participants satisfying the criteria for inclusion who did or did
not undergo the index tests and/or the reference standard; describe why par-
ticipants failed to undergo either test (a flow diagram is strongly recommend-
ed).

Time-interval between the index tests and the reference standard, and any
treatment administered in between.

Distribution of severity of disease (define criteria) in those with the target con-

Appendix 9. Anchoring statements for quality assessment of IQCODE diagnostic studies

We provide some core anchoring statements for quality assessment of diagnostic test accuracy reviews of IQCODE in dementia. These
statements are designed for use with the QUADAS-2 tool and were derived during a two-day, multidisciplinary focus group.

During the focus group and the piloting/validation of this guidance, it was clear that certain issues were key to assessing quality, while other
issues were important to record but less important for assessing overall quality. To assist, we describe a system wherein certain items can
dominate. For these dominant items, if scored “high risk” then that section of the QUADAS-2 results table is likely to be scored as high risk
of bias regardless of other scores. For example, in dementia diagnostic test accuracy studies, ensuring that clinicians performing dementia
assessment are blinded to results of index test is fundamental. If this blinding was not present then the item on reference standard should
be scored “high risk of bias”, regardless of the other contributory elements.

We have detailed how QUADAS-2 has been operationalised for use with dementia reference standard studies below. In these descriptors
dominant items are labelled as "high risk of bias for total section regardless of other items".

In assessing individual items, the score of unclear should only be given if there is genuine uncertainty. In these situations review authors
will contact the relevant study teams for additional information.

Selection

Was a case-control or similar design avoided?

Designs similar to case-control that may introduce bias are those designs where the study team deliberately increase or decrease the
proportion with the target condition. For example, a population study may be enriched with extra dementia patients from a secondary
care setting. Such studies will be automatically labelled high risk of bias and this will be assessed as a potential source of heterogeneity.

If case-control used then grading will be high risk of bias for total section regardless of other items (in fact case-control studies will not
be included in this review)

Was the sampling method appropriate?

Where sampling is used, the designs least likely to cause bias are consecutive sampling or random sampling. Sampling that is based on
volunteers or selecting participants from a clinic or research resource is prone to bias.

Are exclusion criteria described and appropriate?

The study will be automatically graded as unclear if exclusions are not detailed (pending contact with study authors). Where exclusions
are detailed, the study will be graded as low risk of bias if exclusions are felt to be appropriate by the review authors. Certain exclusions
common  to  many  studies  of  dementia  are:  medical  instability;  terminal  disease;  alcohol/substance  misuse;  concomitant  psychiatric
diagnosis; other neurodegenerative condition.

Post hoc exclusions will be labelled high risk of bias for total section regardless of other items.

Index Test

Was IQCODE assessment performed without knowledge of clinical dementia diagnosis?

Terms such as “blinded” or “independently and without knowledge of” are sufficient and full details of the blinding procedure are not
required. This item may be scored as low risk of bias if explicitly described or if there is a clear temporal pattern to order of testing that
precludes the need for formal blinding i.e. all IQCODE assessments performed before dementia assessment.

If there is no attempt at blinding grading will be high risk of bias for total section regardless of other items.

Were IQCODE thresholds prespecified?

For scales there is often a reference point (in units or categories) above which participants are classified as “test positive”; this may be
referred to as threshold; clinical cut-off or dichotomisation point. A study is classified high risk of bias if the authors define the optimal cut-

off post-hoc based on their own study data. Certain papers may use an alternative methodology for analysis that does not use thresholds
and these papers should be classified as low risk of bias.

Were sufficient data on IQCODE application given for the test to be repeated in an independent study?

Particular  points  of  interest  for  IQCODE  include  method  of  administration  (for  example,  self-completed  questionnaire  versus  direct
questioning interview); nature of informant; language of assessment. If a novel form of IQCODE is used, details of the scale should be
included  or  a  reference  given  to  an  appropriate  descriptive  text.  Where  IQCODE  is  used  in  a  novel  manner,  for  example,  a  translated
questionnaire, there should be evidence of validation work.

Reference Standard

Is the assessment used for clinical diagnosis of dementia acceptable?

Commonly used international criteria to assist with clinical diagnosis of dementia include those detailed in DSM-IV and ICD-10. Criteria
specific to dementia subtypes include but are not limited to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer’s dementia; McKeith criteria for Lewy
Body dementia; Lund criteria for frontotemporal dementias; and the NINDS-AIREN criteria for vascular dementia. Where the criteria used
for assessment are not familiar to the review authors or the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group this item should be
classified as high risk of bias.

Was clinical assessment for dementia performed without knowledge of IQCODE?

Terms such as “blinded” or “independent” are sufficient and full details of the blinding procedure are not required. This may be scored
as low risk of bias if explicitly described or if there is a clear temporal pattern to order of testing, i.e. all dementia assessments performed
before IQCODE testing.

Informant rating scales and direct cognitive tests present certain problems. It is accepted that informant interview and cognitive testing is a
usual component of clinical assessment for dementia, however, specific use of the scale under review in the clinical dementia assessment
should be scored as high risk of bias. We have prespecified that dementia diagnosis that explicitly uses IQCODE will be classified as high
risk of bias for total section regardless of other items.

Were sufficient data on dementia assessment method given for the assessment to be repeated in an independent study?

The  criteria  used  for  clinical  assessment  are  discussed  in  another  item.  Particular  points  of  interest  for  dementia  assessment  include
the background of the assessor, training/expertise of the assessor; additional information available to inform diagnosis (neuroimaging;
neuropsychological testing).

Flow

Was there an appropriate interval between IQCODE and clinical dementia assessment?

For a cross-sectional study design, there is potential for change between assessments. The ideal would be same day assessment but this
is not always feasible. We have set an arbitrary maximum interval of one month between tests, although this may be revised depending
on the test and the stability of the condition of interest.

Did all get the same assessment for dementia regardless of IQCODE result?

There  may  be  scenarios  where  only  those  who  score  “test  positive”  on  IQCODE  have  a  more  detailed  assessment.  Where  dementia
assessment (or other reference standard) differs depending on the IQCODE result this should be classified as high risk of bias.

Were all who received IQCODE assessment included in the final analysis?

If the study has drop outs these should be accounted for; a maximum proportion of drop outs to remain low risk of bias has been specified
as 20%.

Were missing IQCODE results or un-interpretable IQCODE results reported?

Where missing results are reported if there is substantial attrition (we have set an arbitrary value of 50% missing data) this should be scored
as high risk of bias for total section regardless of other items.

Applicability

Were those included representative of the general population of interest?

Those included should match the intended population as described in the review question. If not already specified in the review inclusion
criteria, setting will be particularly important – the review authors should consider population in terms of symptoms; pre-testing; potential
disease prevalence. Studies that use very selected groups or subgroups will be classified as poor applicability.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Was IQCODE performed consistently and in a manner similar to its use in clinical practice?

IQCODE studies will be judged against the original description of its use.

Was clinical diagnosis of dementia (or other reference standard) made in a manner similar to current clinical practice?

For  many  reviews,  inclusion  criteria  and  assessment  for  risk  of  bias  will  already  have  assessed  the  dementia  diagnosis.  For  certain
reviews an applicability statement relating to reference standard may not be applicable. There is the possibility that a form of dementia
assessment, although valid, may diagnose a far larger proportion with disease than would be seen in usual clinical practice. In this instance
the item should be rated poor applicability.

Dementia and Cognitive Improvement in conjunction with the
Cochrane Mental Health and Neuroscience Network and the re-
view authors, following feedback from a group of dementia re-

short screening tests could make a diagnosis of a dementia sub-
type like Alzheimer’s disease. This interpretation was not in-

The review title was changed from IQCODE for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias within a secondary care
setting to Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) for the diagnosis of dementia within a secondary care setting
for consistency with the other reviews in the suite.

Following discussions with DTA statisticians and in common with the analysis performed and reported in the IQCODE Community Review,
we used the bivariate method for meta-analysis, rather than the HSROC, as stated in the original protocol.

Analysis looking at diagnostic accuracy stratified by dementia subtype and the effect of diagnostic criteria were not possible due to the
lack of data in included studies.

We amended the methodology adopted for conducting sensitivity analysis by age due to the availability of data. The protocol had stated
that where studies had more than 20% of included participants younger than 65 we would consider them potentially unrepresentative and
would analyse them separately. In the event, the included studies reported median or mean age, and we decided that where this was 70
years or less, we would consider them potentially unrepresentative and would analyse them separately.
