Summary

What accounts for variation across racial and ethnic groups in drug use and harms related to 
substance use? While explanatory mechanisms for racial and ethnic disparities include differential 
access to and use of health services, a myriad of other factors, including racism and historical 
trauma, contribute to drug-related disparities. Furthermore, the addiction scientific workforce, 
like the full biomedical research enterprise, lacks diversity. This deficit undercuts U.S. scientific 
leadership and is a major challenge for the field. To address these entrenched problems, the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is prioritizing research on health disparities and 
supporting multiple efforts to enhance scientific workforce diversity. Studies on substance use 
trends and emerging threats must measure disparities and track progress in reducing disparities, 
but also acknowledge the limitations of race and ethnicity-based data. Researchers must take 
the bold step of proposing studies that elucidate causal mechanisms which have the potential to 
be ameliorated by novel policies and practices. Critically, the impact of racism on all aspects 
of the substance use trajectory must be assessed to better tailor prevention, harm reduction, 
treatment, and recovery-support interventions to the specific circumstances of those who need 
them. Particular attention should be given to people who are incarcerated, who are experiencing 
homelessness, and who have a history of adverse childhood experiences. Training the next 
generation of the addiction science workforce needs to address structural barriers to participation 
with partnerships between funders, such as NIDA, and grantee organizations.

Introduction

Page 2

Variation in rates of substance use and outcomes such as overdose, infectious diseases, 
and justice system involvement, are notable across race and ethnic groups (e.g., see Figure 
1). While these differences are frequently described in the research literature, the likely 
origins and meaning of group differences are rarely discussed and sometimes interpreted 
deterministically when, in fact, “race” and “ethnicity” are inherently social constructs. 
Furthermore, in the United States, definitions of race and ethnic groups, which are typically 
based on definitions from the White House Office of Management and Budget (2022), vary 
over time in ways that impact interpretation of findings.

Tracking data on rates according to race and ethnicity remains critical because inequities are 
a threat to overall population health (Cogburn, 2019) and point to areas of high need for 
treatment and prevention services. Yet, as these data are collected and shared, a challenging 
question remains: What are effective prevention and treatment interventions to reduce 
disparities? Answering this question requires an understanding of underlying causes and 
malleable factors that drive or sustain disparities.

Multiple explanatory mechanisms have been proposed, including differential access to 
and use of health services. Racism, historical trauma, and other stress theories (including 
the impact of social determinants of health such as poverty, unemployment, and unstable 
housing) have all been examined as mechanisms to account for the disparities in substance-
related morbidity and mortality (Yearby et al, 2022). Prominent factors addressed in research 
studies include multi-generational impacts of trauma, unfair housing and lending practices, 
ongoing experiences of racism and discrimination, as well as traumatic exposure to racially 
motivated violence either personally or in the media or online.

In particular, communities of color have been disproportionately harmed by decades of 
inequitable application of punitive and carceral responses to drug possession and use 
(Mitchell & Caudy, 2015), and the effects of these disparities in criminal policy responses 
to drug use are significant (National Academies of Sciences, 2019). The disruption and 
trauma inflicted on historically marginalized communities and families by inequitable drug 
enforcement also contributes to the social conditions that can lead to increased drug use 
and other unfavorable outcomes. For instance, disproportionate felony convictions and 
incarceration can increase difficulties for historically marginalized people in finding housing 
and employment, separation of children from their parents, and prohibition of people in 
some places from voting. Thus, disparities in justice systems may exacerbate substance-
related harms both directly and indirectly. Responding to these major social and health 
concerns is a scientific imperative.

Scientific Responses

In June of 2020, NIDA Director Nora Volkow established the NIDA Racial Equity Initiative 
to broadly address racial inequity in addiction science, including the workplace at NIDA 
itself, the scientific workforce supported by NIDA funding, and NIDA’s research portfolio 
(Volkow, 2021). This work is consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) goal

of improving “the NIH culture and structure for equity, inclusion, and excellence” (National 
Institutes of Health, 2022a), and is consistent with the NIH UNITE initiative, which was 
developed to explore “understanding barriers; developing robust health disparities/equity 
research; improving its [NIH] internal culture; being transparent and accountable; and 
changing the extramural ecosystem so that diversity, equity, and inclusion are reflected in 
funded research and the biomedical workforce” (Collins et al., 2021).

Enhancing Racial Equity in the Scientific Workforce

Training the next generation of researchers presents both challenges and opportunities. As 
highlighted in recent examination of trends in training across biomedical fields, the number 
of persons entering academic careers in biomedicine may be declining (National Institutes 
of Health, 2023a). A key concern is the relatively low pay for training positions, particularly 
post-doctoral positions. Relatively low salaries for highly educated and trained persons has 
been identified as a major contributor to declining participation in post-doctoral positions. 
These salary concerns may be particularly acute for underrepresented groups in science 
where family incomes may not support the extended low-salary training that is typical in 
biomedical science (National Institutes of Health, 2023a).

NIH training grants set the standard for trainee salaries, but they have not kept up with 
inflation and may not be sufficient to allow persons who lack other sources of income or 
support to pursue careers in biomedical science. While the need for increased support from 
NIH continues to be emphasized, such increases to individuals may result in a decrease 
in the overall number who can be supported if overall funding is not also increased. We 
also note that grants, such as individual and institutional training grants (i.e., “F” and “T” 
grants) are assistance mechanisms and can be supplemented with non-federal funds. In 
fact, multiple institutions have increased their support for pre- and post-doctoral trainees 
well beyond the NIH stipends (Langin, 2023; Castiglione, 2023). Such additional support 
would be welcomed by all but may be particularly important to persons from disadvantaged 
backgrounds.

Specific programs to support workforce development extend well beyond the broad T and 
F grant programs. For example, programs specifically supported by NIDA include NIDA’s 
Diversity Scholars Network, the NIDA Summer Research Internship Program, the Loan 
Repayment Program, Diversity Supplement Awards, and a funding opportunity published 
in 2022 called “Research Opportunities for New and ‘At-Risk’ Investigators to Promote 
Workforce Diversity” (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2023b; Avila et al., 2022; National 
Institutes of Health, 2022b). In addition, multiple broad NIH efforts are designed to enhance 
workforce diversity (National Institutes of Health, 2023b).

Continued focus on researcher demographics is crucial for NIH to determine the impact of 
efforts to enhance racial and ethnic diversity in the scientific workforce. Earlier this year, 
the NIH Office of Extramural Research published an analysis examining trends in funding 
for Research Project Grants by demographic characteristics from 2010– 2022 (Lauer & 
Bernard, 2023). While progress is demonstrated, absolute numbers of Black and Hispanic 
applicants remain very low, and the narrowing White-Black gap in funding from 2010 
to 2021 backslid between 2021 and 2022 (see Figure 2). Such analyses will be regularly

required to assess if novel, more concentrated approaches to improving racial equity in 
the workforce result in more meaningful change. Monitoring similar data for the addiction 
workforce supported by NIDA grants is an important goal to help identify areas that may be 
improving or may need additional attention.

Enhancing Racial Equity in NIDA-supported Science

New areas of research on racial and ethnic health disparities continue to be promoted and 
supported by NIDA. Toward the goal of enhancing NIDA research in this area, the Racial 
Equity Initiative conducted iterative listening sessions and held a scientific meeting in 2021 
entitled “Enhancing Health Disparities Research Related to Substance Use and Addiction: 
Research Gaps and Opportunities” (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2021). A coordinated 
suite of funding opportunities was subsequently released to encourage research addressing 
the gaps identified, including community-engaged research, neurocognitive mechanisms of 
structural racism, reducing disparities at the intersection of HIV and substance use, and 
enhancement of addiction research at minority-serving institutions (National Institute on 
Drug Abuse, 2023a).

As in many areas of health research, addiction research often collects information about 
participant race and ethnicity, but outcomes for the identified subgroups are not always 
analyzed. Nor are participant race and ethnicity typically assessed within the full context of 
social determinants of health or with a strong consideration of race as a social construct. 
Addressing these gaps may be enhanced with community-engaged research, which is a 
critical tool to ensure that the perspectives of communities are integrated at the stage 
of research design and to ensure researchers are addressing the most pressing research 
questions with the greatest capacity to meaningfully improve health outcomes (Webb 
Hooper et al., 2022).

Integration of community perspectives is also critical for leveraging resiliency factors to 
tailor interventions to communities of color. For example, neurodevelopmental impacts of 
poverty can be mitigated through targeted prevention programs aimed at disadvantaged 
youth and their families, such as the Strong African American Families prevention 
intervention studied in Georgia (Brody et al., 2017). Further, while rates of drug use and 
overdose may be particularly high among American Indian individuals, a growing body 
of research focuses on the unique strengths of American Indian communities to enhance 
connection to salutary traditions that are protective against substance use disorders (Barlow 
et al., 2013; Barlow et al., 2015; Walls et al., 2016). Building on resiliency factors also 
helps to avoid the discouragement of focusing solely on a nearly endless parade of negative 
associations.

As previously described, criminalizing drug use has profoundly impacted communities of 
color. Research on best interventions for substance use disorders in carceral settings that 
takes into account race and ethnicity may help ameliorate health disparities around drug use 
and addiction. NIDA has long supported research in justice settings, including landmark 
studies such as Inciardi and colleagues’ treatment outcome work (1998) and work to 
enhance integration of public health and public safety actions (Chandler et al., 2009). More 
recently, the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network, has launched a coordinated set

of research projects aiming to improve evidence-based care across justice settings including 
prison, jail, drug court, probation, parole, and community re-entry (Ducharme et al., 2021).

Conclusions and Call to Action

Scientific research must provide opportunities both to continue to track emerging shifts in 
rates of drug use and drug-related harms across multiple racial and ethnic subgroups and to 
elucidate causal mechanisms. Critically, the impact of racism on all aspects of the substance 
use trajectory must be assessed to better tailor the prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and 
recovery-support interventions to the specific circumstances of those who need them.

Research on the social, historical, and contextual factors that influence health is a growing 
focus for the entire National Institutes of Health (Tabak & Collins, 2011; Bernard et al., 
2021). Widening the lens beyond biology and health care access reveals just how impactful 
these factors can be and is illuminating potential new ways to improve health and reduce 
health disparities. For example, a longitudinal study capturing the beginning of income 
supports for American Indian families documented improved mental health outcomes for the 
children of those families that continued to manifest even 20 years later, along with reduced 
risky or illegal behaviors, increased physical health, and improved financial functioning 
(Copeland et al., 2022). Income supports during the COVID-19 pandemic may offer another 
natural experiment to measure the health effects of reduced financial insecurity (Weissman 
et al., 2023).

In addition to the new research solicited by the NIDA Racial Equity Initiative, large, 
ongoing research projects are poised to address questions around experiences of racism and 
its impact on health outcomes, along with other insights, to guide development of policies 
and interventions to reduce health disparities. The ABCD Study and the new HEALthy 
Brain and Child Development Study, which together are assembling large-scale datasets on 
brain development spanning the prenatal period through age twenty, are expected to enable 
researchers to study the complex web of influences that leads to disparities in substance use 
and addiction outcomes (Volkow et al., 2018; Volkow et al., 2020).

Additional research is needed to maintain an accurate understanding of the landscapes 
of drug use and addiction outcomes and their intersections with race and ethnicity. 
Epidemiological data on people who are incarcerated, who are experiencing homelessness, 
and who are absent from school (i.e., excluded from school-based surveys) are urgently 
needed to fill gaps in our surveillance systems. Collection of data on contextual factors 
must also inform these and other clinical studies to best account for variable outcomes, 
elucidate the multifactorial pathways that lead to health disparities, and ultimately inform 
the implementation of effective solutions (Jordan et al., 2020).

Multiple approaches to addressing workforce diversity are underway at NIDA and NIH. 
Partnerships and extension of these programs in academic centers is essential for their 
success. For instance, as described above, NIH support for trainees may not be adequate 
to allow persons of limited means to engage in a research career. With NIH grants as a

foundation, grantee organizations could offer additional support to assure equitable access to 
scientific training.

Communities of color in the United States have experienced iterative harms, from the 
assaults on health and safety associated with colonization, slavery, and genocide, through 
lynching, segregation, redlining, and mass incarceration (Comas-Diaz et al., 2019; Gameon 
& Skewes, 2021; Gone et al., 2019; Skewes & Blume, 2019). These profound influences 
cannot be ignored in the consideration of how to best address the clear health disparities that 
accompany the current U.S. drug crisis, as well as the entrenched lack of diversity in the 
biomedical research workforce.

Highlights

What accounts for variation across racial and ethnic groups in drug use and harms related 
to substance use? While explanatory mechanisms for racial and ethnic disparities include 
differential access to and use of health services, a myriad of other factors, including 
racism and historical trauma, contribute to drug-related disparities. Furthermore, the 
addiction scientific workforce, like the full biomedical research enterprise, lacks 
diversity. This deficit undercuts U.S. scientific leadership and is a major challenge for 
the field. To address these entrenched problems, the National Institute on Drug Abuse 
(NIDA) is prioritizing research on health disparities and supporting multiple efforts to 
enhance scientific workforce diversity. Studies on substance use trends and emerging 
threats must measure disparities and track progress in reducing disparities, but also 
acknowledge the limitations of race and ethnicity-based data. Researchers must take 
the bold step of proposing studies that elucidate causal mechanisms which have the 
potential to be ameliorated by novel policies and practices. Critically, the impact of 
racism on all aspects of the substance use trajectory must be assessed to better tailor 
prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery-support interventions to the specific 
circumstances of those who need them. Particular attention should be given to people 
who are incarcerated, who are experiencing homelessness, and who have a history of 
adverse childhood experiences. Training the next generation of the addiction science 
workforce needs to address structural barriers to participation with partnerships between 
funders, such as NIDA, and grantee organizations.
