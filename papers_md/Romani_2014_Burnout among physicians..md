Burnout is a common syndrome seen in healthcare workers, particularly physicians who are exposed to a high
level of stress at work; it includes emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment.
Burnout among physicians has garnered significant attention because of the negative impact it renders on
patient care and medical personnel. Physicians who had high burnout levels reportedly committed more
medical errors. Stress management programs that range from relaxation to cognitive-behavioral and patient-
centered therapy have been found to be of utmost significance when it comes to preventing and treating
burnout. However, evidence is insufficient to support that stress management programs can help reducing job-
related stress beyond the intervention period, and similarly mindfulness-based stress reduction interven-
tions efficiently reduce psychological distress and negative vibes, and encourage empathy while significantly
enhancing physicians’ quality of life. On the other hand, a few small studies have suggested that Balint sessions
can have a promising positive effect in preventing burnout; moreover exercises can reduce anxiety levels and
exhaustion symptoms while improving the mental and physical well-being of healthcare workers. Occupational
interventions in the work settings can also improve the emotional and work-induced exhaustion. Combining
both individual and organizational interventions can have a good impact in reducing burnout scores among
physicians; therefore, multidisciplinary actions that include changes in the work environmental factors along
with stress management programs that teach people how to cope better with stressful events showed promising
solutions to manage burnout. However, until now there have been no rigorous studies to prove this. More
interventional research targeting medical students, residents, and practicing physicians are needed in order to
improve psychological well-being, professional careers, as well as the quality of care provided to patients.

Burnout is a syndrome seen in demanding jobs

and in people who care for others such as social
workers, teachers, and healthcare professionals (1).
Healthcare workers, particularly physicians, are ex-
posed to high levels of distress at work. Persistent tension
can lead to exhaustion, psychological, and/or physical
distress. Moreover, burnout syndrome may increase the
risk of medical errors and decrease job satisfaction, which
incites early retirement (2(cid:2)4).

According to Maslach et al., burnout has three inter-
related dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonal-
ization, and low personal accomplishment. Prolonged
exposure to stress is usually the main cause of emotional
exhaustion and it manifests through the loss of enthu-
siasm for work, feeling helpless, trapped, and defeated.
Depersonalization occurs when physicians treat patients
indifferently, objectify them, and develop a negative atti-
tude toward their colleagues and profession. Inefficiency,

or the lack of a sense of personal achievement,
is
characterized by the individual’s withdrawal from re-
sponsibilities and detachment from the job (5, 6).

quently used questionnaire,

the golden standard for identifying burnout in medical
research literature (6).

Multiple studies have indicated a high prevalence of
burnout among practicing physicians and have shown
that one-third of physicians have experienced burnout at
certain points throughout their careers (7). Burnout
begins to cultivate its seeds during the medical school
days, continues throughout the residency period, and
finally matures in the daily life of practicing physicians.
Studies suggest that the prevalence of burnout among
medical students ranges between 31 and 49.6% (8).
Among residents, 50 and 76% of surgical and internal

medicine residents are affected, respectively (9). Cohen
et al. found that at least one-third of Canadian medical
residents from different specialties experience a stressful
life (10). On the contrary, Legassie et al. report that
12.5% of medical residents scored positively on the three
dimensions altogether (11). Even higher rates were re-
corded in a study done among Lebanese residents (12).
The burnout rate seems to be even more pronounced
among practicing physicians. In a recent study from the
United States, 45.8% of physicians reported having at least
one symptom of burnout (7). Similarly, the study by the
European General Practice Research Network Burnout
Study Group, which included 1,400 family physicians in
12 European countries, revealed the following: 43% of
respondents scored high for emotional exhaustion, 35%
for depersonalization, and 32% for low personal accom-
plishment, while 12% of participants suffered from burn-
out in all three dimensions (13). Another study that
included more than 500 physicians in the United Kingdom
demonstrated that at least one third of the physicians
revealed features of burnout (14). These results are com-
parable to those of similar studies conducted in some Arab
countries like Yemen, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia (15(cid:2)17).

The different outcomes of the aforementioned studies
were not affected by the specialty of the practicing
physicians, despite the fact that rates were noticeably
high among family physicians (13, 18, 16) and general
surgeons (3, 14).

Shanafelt concluded that burnout is more likely to
occur with trauma surgeons, urologists, otolaryngolo-
gists, vascular and general surgeons, and younger health-
care professionals having children in addition to working
more than 60 hours per week, having more calls per week
than the regular ((cid:2)2 nights/week), and having compen-
sation determined entirely based on billing (19).

Intervention methods
Numerous studies suggest that the difficulty that physi-
cians face with balancing their personal and professional
lives is a major contributor to distress. To reduce stress at
work, one should consider interventions on two levels:
the individual and the environment.

Stress management courses
Stress management ranges from relaxation to cognitive-
behavioral and patient-centered therapy. The latter inter-
vention targets organizational and job-related designs
(20). Evidence has shown that healthcare providers who
seek help or resort to coping and productive strategies
tend to experience lower levels of emotional exhaustion
than those who do not (21).

Stress reduction programs, focusing on cognitive beha-
vioral techniques, were found to be of utmost significance
when it comes to preventing and treating burnout in
healthcare professionals.

They can be divided into programs focusing on primary,
secondary, and tertiary prevention, where secondary and
tertiary interventions focus on specific needs for each
target group. Long-term effectiveness of these programs
in preventing burnout depends on providing a combi-
nation of psychoeducational treatment combined with
follow-up booster sessions and on the duration of the
program, the focus on the problem, and the sustainability
of the supply (22).

Results of systematic reviews that evaluated stress
management strategies among general medicine practi-
tioners (GPs) reported that relaxation and cognitive-
behavioral skills proved helpful. Moreover, group methods
are both more cost-effective and more beneficial than
individual counseling (23).

Gardiner and colleagues evaluated the effect of 15 h of
stress management training programs on 85 Australian
GPs. The programs focused on areas of stress reaction,
psychoeducation, relaxation techniques, and cognitive
interventions. The work-related stress levels of partici-
pants significantly decreased, while their general well-
being and quality of life improved over a period of 12
weeks following the course’s administration (24).

Two non-randomized controlled trial (non-RCT) inter-
vention studies that included a lecture, research informa-
tion, and a group discussion with medical students yielded
no significant effects on depression, alcoholism, or stress
level (25, 26). However, another non-RCT of a 10-session
mindfulness-based meditation course improved the over-
all mood of medical students in the intervention group
(27). Skodova showed that sociopsychological training
could lessen the level of burnout and positively influence
the personality factors that are susceptible to burnout
among healthcare students (28).

With residents, Feld et al. found that an intervention
program in professional development improved residents’
self-awareness and willingness to explore their feelings.
This program consisted of 11 sessions of open discussions
and problem solving within a flexible, group-determined
set of agenda items (29).

On the contrary, McCue et al. concluded that a single,
all-day stress management workshop given to medicine
and pediatric residents alleviated their emotional exhaus-
tion for as long as 6 weeks after the intervention (30).
Furthermore, a study conducted among family medicine
residents showed that their emotional exhaustion had
eased as a result of mediation and breathing exercises (31).
Mindfulness is defined as a self-directed practice for
relaxing the body and calming the mind through focusing
on present-moment awareness. The emphasis of mind-
fulness is staying in the present moment, with a non-
judging, non-striving attitude of acceptance. Mindful
meditation represents a complementary therapy that has
shown promise in the reduction of negative stress and the
extraneous factors that lead to burnout. Many studies

evaluated these ‘mindfulness-based’ intervention techni-
ques and showed that they potentially play a role in
decreasing stress and burnout.

Krasner and colleagues evaluated the effects of an
intensive educational program that included mindful med-
itation, self-awareness exercises, narratives about clinical
experiences, appreciative interviews, didactic material,
and discussions on primary care physicians. Participants
demonstrated improvements in mindfulness, which was
correlated with an improvement in their overall mood,
empathy (emotional exhaustion), personal accomplish-
ment, and personality over the course period with sus-
tained effects of up to 15 months (32).

Goodman et al. evaluated the training in four types of
formal mindfulness practices: body scans, mindful move-
ment, walking, and sitting meditation, as well as discus-
sions focusing on the application of mindfulness in the
workplace. MBI scores significantly improved after the
course for both physicians and other healthcare providers
in the areas of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,
and personal accomplishment. Mental well-being was
also enhanced, but there were no significant changes in
the physical health scores (33).

Moreover, a group of nurses who were unable to per-
sonally join the traditional mindfulness program attended
a telephonic session. There was a significant improvement
in their general health, while their stress and burnout levels
decreased. These developments were sustained for 4
months after the study period (34).

Similarly, Shapiro et al. and Martı´n-Asuero and
colleagues found that mindfulness-based stress reduction
interventions efficiently reduce psychological distress and
‘negative vibes’ and encourage empathy while signifi-
cantly enhancing physicians’ quality of life (35, 36).

Shanafelt concluded that training physicians in the art
of mindful practice has the potential to promote physi-
cian’s health through work (9). Isaksson and colleagues
observed that even short-term counseling sessions, either
on an individual basis for 1 day or a group basis lasting
1 week, significantly reduces emotional exhaustion among
Norwegian doctors (37).

Mindful meditative practice can be a cost-efficient
method of improving physicians’ well-being and enhan-
cing their approach to patient-centered care.

In addition to that, a qualitative study showed that
music therapy helps physicians relax, rejuvenate, and re-
focus, thus enabling them to energetically pull through
their shifts. However, no difference in self-reported burn-
out, sense of coherence, and job satisfaction was noticed
(38).

However, two Cochrane reviews concluded that evi-
dence is insufficient to support that stress management
programs can help in reducing job-related stress beyond
the intervention period in healthcare professionals and

Burnout among physicians

little evidence exists in long-term interventions with
booster or refresher courses (39).

Balint sessions
Balint sessions are group sessions that train doctors on
how to apply a patient-centered approach with a special
focus on doctor(cid:2)patient relationships. They are known as
a common therapeutic strategy that reduces stress and
burnout symptoms. Surprisingly, however, interventional
studies evaluating the function of Balint groups are scarce
(Table 1). Two small studies suggested that Balint sessions
may help to prevent stress and burnout, especially among
residents (40). A study on general practitioners over 3(cid:2)15
years found them to have increased job satisfaction after
attending Balint therapeutic sessions (41).

A study evaluated the effect of (‘didactic’) problem-
based reading assignments, lectures and discussions in
one arm and (‘interactive’) program consisted of reading
assignments, lectures and discussions, in addition to role-
playing exercises, Balint groups, and one-to-one counsel-
ing by a facilitator in the other arm. It found measurable
improvement in patient-centered care and self-esteem
among general practitioners in both arms and this was
more pronounced in the interactive classes; however, both
arms failed to decrease burnout scores (42).

Exercise
A 10-min stretching exercise in the work place has proven
to reduce anxiety levels and exhaustion symptoms while
improving the mental and physical well-being of health-
care workers (43).

Aerobic exercise is negatively associated with depres-
sion (44). It assists in reducing overwhelming stress (45)
and improves the biological markers that may intervene
between burnout and cardiovascular disease (46).

In a study on 12 physicians, 12 one-hour aerobic sessions
were administered for 2 or 3 days weekly to reach the
required level of weekly energy expenditure of 17.5 kcal/kg
measured by a calories counter. This was found to sig-
nificantly reduce the participants’ emotional exhaustion
and their degree of depersonalization to a lesser extent.
However, no significant change was observed with regard
to their sense of personal accomplishment (47). This low-
cost intervention method is a promising candidate for
future studies about the effect of exercise on the well-being
of healthcare workers.

Shanafelt also studied the personal health habits
and wellness practices among US surgeons and found
that physicians who participated in aerobic and muscle-
strengthening exercises according to CDC guidelines
had high quality of life scores. Surgeons who placed an
emphasis on finding meaning in work, focusing on what
is important in life, maintained a positive outlook, and
embraced a balanced work/life were less likely to get
burned out (3).

Occupational interventions
Few studies focused on organizational interventions as
interventions. One study took
opposed to individual
place in a primary care center where clinic leaders
prioritized physician well-being as much as the quality
of care. Physicians identified factors that
influenced
followed by plans for improvement with
well-being,

accountability, and measured their well-being regularly
using validated instruments. The results showed a sig-
nificant improvement in the emotional and work-induced
exhaustion over the study period (48).

Another study lead by an insurance company targeting
hospital employees focused on an organizational control
of factors that produced stress, found a reduction in

medication errors over the study period. A recent review
showed that individual-intervention programs are bene-
ficial in reducing burnout in a short term (6 months or
less), while a combination of both personal and organi-
zational interventions have longer lasting positive effects
(12 months and more) (49).

Melamed et al. argued that treating burnout is a
challenging endeavor (46). The success of many interven-
tions may be limited by the fact that later stages of
burnout entail physiological changes that are not easily
reversed (50).

Consequently, more long-term studies are needed to
highlight intervention plans in order to maintain the
positive effects mentioned above and to prevent or treat
burnout.

Conclusions
Burnout among physicians is a common serious entity
with devastating personal and professional consequences.
Multidisciplinary actions that include changes in the
work environmental factors along with stress manage-
ment programs that teach people how to cope better with
stressful events showed promising solutions to manage
burnout. However, up until now, there have been no
rigorous studies that prove this.

More interventional research targeting medical stu-
dents, residents and practicing physicians are needed in
order to improve psychological well-being, professional
career enjoyment as well as the quality of care provided to
patients.
