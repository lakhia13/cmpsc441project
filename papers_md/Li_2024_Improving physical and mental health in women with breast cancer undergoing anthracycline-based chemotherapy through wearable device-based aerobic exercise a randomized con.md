Purpose: Aimed to assess the impact of wearable device-based aerobic exercise 
on  the  physical  and  mental  well-being  of  women  with  breast  cancer  (BC) 
undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods:  Forty  adult  women  with  BC  who  underwent  anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy  were  randomly  allocated  to  the  exercise  group  (n  =  21)  or 
the  control  group  (n  =  19).  Both  groups  received  standard  health  education 
and  oncology  care.  In  addition,  the  exercise  group  wore  wearable  devices  to 
engage in moderate to high-intensity (50–90% HRmax) aerobic exercise during 
chemotherapy, while the control group did not carry out exercise intervention. 
Health-related physical fitness level, physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), 
anxiety and depression scores, sleep quality, cancer-related fatigue, and overall 
quality of life (QoL), were assessed both before (prior to the first chemotherapy 
session)  and  after  (prior  to  the  fifth  chemotherapy  session)  the  exercise 
intervention.  Exercise-related  adverse  events,  exercise  compliance,  number 
and severity of gastrointestinal reactions and myelosuppression occurred were 
recorded during the exercise intervention.

Results:  After  the  intervention,  compared  to  the  control  group,  the  exercise 
group  (1)  had  significantly  higher  relative  VO2peak  (p  =  0.003)  and  handgrip 
strength  (p  <  0.001);  (2)  had  significantly  higher  PAEE  (p  <  0.001);  (3)  had  a 
significantly  lower  scores  in  anxiety  (p  =  0.007),  depression  (p  =  0.028),  sleep 
quality  in  domains  of  subjective  sleep  quality  (p  =  0.010),  sleep  disturbances 
(p =  0.004), daytime dysfunction (p =  0.007), cancer-related fatigue in domains 
of physical (p <  0.001) and affective (p <  0.001); and (4) had a significantly lower 
scores in QoL in domains of physical well-being (p <  0.001) and emotional well-
being  (p  =  0.019),  while  a  significantly  higher  scores  in  functional  well-being 
(p <  0.001). Patients in the exercise group experienced less severe gastrointestinal

reactions (p =  0.028) and myelosuppressive symptoms (p <  0.001) than that in 
the control group. Patients in the exercise group had no serious exercise-related 
adverse events, with a mean exercise adherence of 81.8%.

Conclusion: Wearable device-based aerobic exercise during chemotherapy can 
be an effective adjunctive therapy to improve physical and mental health in BC 
patients.

1 Introduction

In 2022, breast cancer ranked the most common cancer among 
women (1). In China, the estimated number of new cases and deaths 
from  female  breast  cancer  in  2020  were  420,000  and  117,000, 
respectively, ranking first in the world (2). Chemotherapy, commonly 
used as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, frequently leads to side 
effects such as reduced physical activity and deterioration in health-
related physical fitness (3, 4). Additionally, it can result in adverse 
consequences such as anxiety, depression, cancer-related fatigue, sleep 
disturbances, gastrointestinal reactions, and myelosuppression (3, 4).
Studies have shown that breast cancer patients typically experience 
weight gain (1.4 ~ 6.2 kg) and negative changes in body composition 
during chemotherapy (5–7), often as a result of the patient’s lack of 
physical  activity  (8).  Weight  gain  during  chemotherapy  for  breast 
cancer may negatively impact quality of life (QoL), health, and self-
esteem and, in severe cases, increase the risk of disease recurrence and 
worsen  prognosis  (6).  Chemotherapy  also  leads  to  a  significant 
decrease  in  peak  oxygen  uptake  (VO2peak)  (9–11),  one  of  the 
indicators  of  cardiorespiratory  fitness  (CRF),  with  a  relative 
VO2peak ≤ 18.0 mL/kg/min indicating increased risk of heart failure 
and  functional  disability  (10,  12,  13).  For  newly  diagnosed  breast 
cancer patients, there is a correlation between health-related physical 
fitness and QoL. In particular, the lean body mass, VO2peak, and grip 
strength are positively associated with QoL, while body weight, BMI, 
body fat mass, and body fat percentage are negatively correlated (14).
Cancer-related fatigue associated with chemotherapy exacerbates 
both grip strength loss and weight gain (15), with grip strength being 
correlated with emotional issues such as anxiety and depression (16). 
Studies have demonstrated that cancer-related fatigue, anxiety and 
depression,  lower  levels  of  physical  activity,  and  poorer  physical 
function have been shown to be associated with sleep disturbances in 
breast cancer patients (17–19). Additionally, gastrointestinal reactions 
and myelosuppression, common side effects of chemotherapy, may 
lead to cancer treatment interruption. In conclusion, the above side 
effects from chemotherapy can seriously affect the patient’s QoL and 
anti-tumor confidence.

Wearable  devices,  such  as  smart  bracelet,  have  emerged  as 
valuable  tools  to  enhance  physical  activity  levels  and  overcome 
barriers  to  intervention,  particularly  in  addressing  cancer-related 
fatigue, by enabling individuals to self-supervise their activity in real 
time  during  exercise  (20,  21).  Supervised  or  partially  supervised 

exercise  training  is  more  effective  than  unsupervised  training  in 
improving  anxiety,  QoL,  and  physical  function  (4).  The  study  by 
Foulkes et al. (22) showed that wearable devices appear to improve 
patient  exercise  compliance,  which  is  crucial  for  ensuring  the 
effectiveness of exercise interventions. Previous research by our team 
has  demonstrated  that  wearable  devices-based  moderate  to  high-
intensity  aerobic  exercise  could  improve  exercise  compliance  and 
mitigate  cardiotoxicity  in  breast  cancer  patients  undergoing 
chemotherapy (23).

Exercise is widely recognized as an effective strategy for managing 
breast cancer patients throughout the chemotherapy. Aerobic exercise 
has been shown to improve CRF (24). However, the effects of exercise 
on depression in cancer survivors are varied across studies (25, 26), 
and  there  is  insufficient  evidence  regarding  its  influence  on  sleep 
quality, gastrointestinal response, myelosuppression, and the QoL in 
domains  other  than  physical  functioning  in  oncology  patients 
undergoing  chemotherapy  (4).  Therefore,  this  study  aimed  to 
investigate the efficacy of moderate to high-intensity aerobic exercise, 
facilitated by wearable devices, in improving the physical and mental 
well-being of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. 
Additionally,  the  safety  and  adherence  of  aerobic  exercise  during 
chemotherapy was assessed.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Study design

This study was a randomized controlled trial in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki, approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Sanhuan  Cancer  Hospital  (SH-2022007),  and  written  informed 
consent was obtained from all patients.

2.2 Subjects

Female patients diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer, aged 
30–65 years,  who  were  receiving  treatment  at  Sanhuan  Cancer 
Hospital between March 2022 and January 2023, and scheduled for 
anthracycline-based chemotherapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients 
with  absolute  contraindications  to  exercise,  as  well  as  those  with 
known  severe  structural  heart  disease,  or  pulmonary,  neurologic,

respiratory, or renal defects, were excluded. Participants in our studies 
received chemotherapy every 2 to 3 weeks with either (1) anthracycline 
combined  with  cyclophosphamide  for  4 cycles  and/or  sequential 
paclitaxel for 4 cycles, or (2) anthracycline combined with paclitaxel 
for 6 cycles. Exclusion criteria included absolute contraindications to 
exercise,  severe  structural  heart  disease,  cognitive  impairment,  or 
pulmonary disease. VO2peak is an important indicator of CRF, which 
is the fifth clinical vital sign (10, 27). The sample size calculation was 
based on an effect size for VO2peak of a previous study with power of 
0.80 and alpha of 0.05 (11), a total of 34 patients was needed. Allowing 
for  attrition  of  17%  based  on  our  preliminary  trail,  ≥41  patients 
were considered.

2.3 Randomization and blinding

Following baseline measurements, participants were randomly 
allocated to either the exercise or control group in a 1:1 ratio using 
block  randomization  with  a  block  size  of  4.  This  allocation  was 
performed  by  an  independent  researcher  utilizing  a  computer-
generated,  random  number  sequence.  Although  the  exercise 
intervention instructors were not blinded to group assignment due to 
their role in supervising the exercise intervention, the medical staff, 
outcome assessors, and participants in both groups remained unaware 
of the grouping throughout the study.

2.4 Intervention

Patients in both groups received standard health education and 
oncology care, encompassing health education on self-care, diet, 
psychological adjustment, and movement of the upper limb on the 
operated side. During each chemotherapy cycle, a health education 
lecture is given while in the hospital, and when the patient is at 

home,  it  is  given  via  live  streaming,  guided  by  a  rehabilitation 
therapist. Additionally, the exercise group underwent an exercise 
intervention,  while  the  control  group  was  informed  of  the 
availability  of  individualized  exercise  instruction  until  the 
completion  of  chemotherapy.  The  exercise  programs  were 
developed based on systematic reviews and clinical trials focused 
on exercise for the prevention and treatment of cardiotoxicity, the 
outcomes of cardiotoxicity that we reported in other article (23, 28).
Exercise  commenced  concurrently  with  the  first  cycle  of 
chemotherapy,  and  participants  followed  an  individualized  and 
progressive  training  regimen  throughout  the  chemotherapy  period, 
exercising  on  3  days  per  week  for  12 weeks  during  4 cycles  of 
interventions  were 
anthracycline-based  chemotherapy.  Exercise 
described in previous study (23). Each exercise session consisted of a 
warm-up, aerobic exercise, and flexibility training (Figure 1). Prior to 
aerobic training, participants engaged in a 5-min warm-up at an intensity 
targeting 50–60% of their maximal heart rate (HRmax) through walking 
or cycling. Aerobic exercise encompassed both continuous and interval 
training. Continuous training involved treadmill, stationary bike, or 
stepping  exercises  performed  at  an  intensity  of  50–75%  HRmax  for 
20–40 min  per  session,  on  2  days  per  week.  Interval  training  was 
conducted on a treadmill or stationary bike, comprising 4–5 sets of 
1–2 min at 60–90% HRmax, interspersed with 3–4 sets of 3 min of slow 
walking or cycling, totaling 15–22 min per session, once a week. The 
exercise  intensity  increased  by  5–10%  HRmax  and/or  the  exercise 
duration increased by 2–5 min every 3 weeks depending on the patient’s 
subjective physical status. Given limitations in accurately determining 
HRmax, the formula “HRmax = 207–0.7 × age” was utilized to establish 
exercise intensity for participants of all ages and fitness (29). Flexibility 
training  was  performed  at  the  end  of  each  aerobic  exercise  session, 
involving static stretching of major muscle groups such as the upper 
limbs, trunk, and lower limbs, with each stretch held for 30 s.

During  hospitalization,  patients  in  the  exercise  group  were 
supervised  by  a  rehabilitation  therapist,  while  at  home,  they  were

instructed  to  self-supervise  their  exercise  sessions,  with  remote 
supervision  provided  by  researchers.  All  exercise  sessions  were 
prescribed  and  documented  using  a  mobile  WeChat  app  called 
“MicroMotion Manager,” developed by the Chinese team of “Exercise is 
Medicine,” along with a smart bracelet (Huawei 6, China). Patients were 
instructed to supervise exercise intensity using objective measures, such 
as heart rate, as well as subjective measures including the talk-test and 
rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Heart rate was maintained between 
50 and 90% HRmax, while the talk-test ensured patients exercised at a 
level where they could speak with some breathlessness but could not 
sing. RPE was rated on a Borg scale of 6–20, with a target range between 
13 and 16, representing “some exertion” to “a lot of exertion.” Mean 
exercise adherence was calculated as the average adherence across all 
participants,  while  exercise  participation  adherence  and  intensity 
adherence were calculated based on the actual attended sessions and the 
proportion of sessions achieving the target intensity, respectively.

2.5 Outcome assessments

All indicators were assessed before (prior to the first chemotherapy 
session) and after (prior to the fifth chemotherapy session) 4 cycles of 
chemotherapy (see Figure 1). Patients filled out questionnaires and 
scales, and underwent CRF tests and handgrip strength on the first 
day of hospitalization before (prior to the first chemotherapy session) 
and  after  (prior  to  the  fifth  chemotherapy  session)  the  exercise 
intervention. Body composition was assessed in the morning of the 
second  day  of  hospitalization,  while  patient  was  in  a  fasted  state. 
Exercise  adherence,  the  number  and  severity  of  exercise-related 
adverse events, gastrointestinal reactions, and myelosuppression, were 
recorded throughout the exercise intervention. The same tests were 
performed by the same physician before and after the intervention.

2.5.1 Body composition

Height was measured using a height meter (Sidi RGZ-160, China) 
with an accuracy of 0.01 m. Waist circumference (0.5–1 cm above the 
navel) and hip circumference (from the pubic symphysis to the most 
convex part of the gluteus maximus muscle) were measured with a 
tape measure (Jimei T1541, China) in the morning, while fasting and 
wearing  light  clothing,  with  an  accuracy  of  0.1  centimeter.  These 
measurements  were  performed  twice,  and  the  mean  values  were 
recorded. Body composition was analyzed using a body composition 
analyzer  (InBody  770,  Korea),  including  measurements  of  body 
weight (accurate to 0.1 kg), body mass index (BMI), muscle mass, 
body fat mass, body fat percentage, and visceral fat area.

2.5.2 VO2peak and handgrip strength

The relative and absolute VO2peak were obtained by a physician 
using  a  standardized  protocol  and  performed  with  a  cycle 
ergometer (COSMED, Italy). The test protocol involved a 3-min 
rest  period  followed  by  cycling  at  a  speed  of  approximately 
55–65 rpm at 0 watts for 3 min. Subsequently, the workload was 
increased by 30 watts per minute until any three of the following 
four  criteria  were  met:  (1)  oxygen  consumption  plateaued  or 
exhibited  a  tendency  to  decline  as  power  increased;  (2)  the 
respiratory  exchange  ratio  reached  approximately  1.05;  (3)  the 
heart rate approached ±10% HRmax; (4) the patient was unable to 
maintain the cycling rhythm for 10 consecutive seconds. Blood 
pressure was supervised every 2 min throughout the test, and the 

patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG) was continuously supervised 
using a 12-lead electrocardiogram.

Handgrip  strength  of  habitual  hand  was  assessed  using  an 
electronic grip strength meter (CAMRY EH101, China) with force 
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg. These measurements were performed 
twice, and the mean values were recorded.

2.5.3 Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE)

The  Chinese  version  of  the  International  Physical  Activity 
Questionnaire  Short  Form  (IPAQ-SF)  was  used  to  measure  the 
patients’ physical activity over the past 7 days (30). IPAQ-SF consists 
of  seven  questions  on  the  duration  and  frequency  of  walking, 
moderate-intensity and higher-intensity exercise, and sedentary time. 
The  energy  expenditure  of  walking,  moderate  and  high  intensity 
activity were 3.3, 4.0 and 8.0 MET, respectively (31). PAEE for 1 week, 
excluding  the  METs  generated  by  the  exercise  intervention,  was 
calculated  as  follows:  3.3 × time  spent  walking + 4 × time  spent  in 
moderate-intensity activity + 8 × time spent in higher-intensity activity.

2.5.4 Anxiety and depression

The  Self-rating  Anxiety  Scale  (SAS)  (32)  and  Self-rating 
Depression  Scale  (SDS)  (33)  were  used  to  measure  anxiety  and 
depression, respectively, and both scales demonstrated good internal 
consistency (34). Each scale contains 20 items, rated on a 4-point 
Likert scale, where responses range from “1” (None or A little of the 
time) to “4” (Most or All of the time). The raw total scores for both the 
SAS and SDS range from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating more 
severe anxiety and depressive symptoms (32–34).

2.5.5 Cancer-related fatigue

Cancer-related fatigue was assessed using the Chinese version of 
the  Cancer  Fatigue  Scale  (CFS),  which  has  demonstrated  good 
reliability and validity in clinical cancer populations, with a Cronbach’s 
alpha coefficient of 0.86 for the total scale (35). The CFS comprises15 
items, divided into three subscales: physical, affective, and cognitive. 
Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 
1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“a lot”) indicating the level of fatigue. The scores 
for each subscale are obtained by summing the scores of the items 
within that subscale. The physical fatigue subscale scores range from 
0 to 28, while both the affective and cognitive subscales range from 0 
to 16. The total fatigue score is the sum of the subscale scores, with a 
range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate more severe fatigue.

2.5.6 Sleep quality

The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 
scale, with a test–retest correlation coefficient of 0.809, was used as a 
self-report assessment tool to evaluate sleep quality over a one-month 
period (36). The 18 self-assessment items of the PSQI compose seven 
components, including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep 
duration,  sleep  efficiency,  sleep  disturbances,  use  of  sleeping 
medications, and daytime dysfunction, with each component scored 
on a scale of 0–3. The total scores of the PSQI range from 0 to 21, with 
higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality (36).

2.5.7 QoL

The QoL was assessed by the Chinese version of the Functional 
Assessment  of  Cancer Therapy-Breast  (FACT-B,  V4.0),  which  has 
demonstrated  good  reliability  with  re-test  correlation  coefficients 
ranging  from  0.82  to  0.89  for  each  component  (37).  The  FACT-B 

Frontiers in Public Health

comprises 36 items, organized into four subscales (physical, social/
family, emotional, and functional) along with an additional breast 
cancer-specific subscale. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, 
ranging from 0 to 4, and the total score ranges from 0 to 144.

2.5.8 Gastrointestinal reactions and 
myelosuppression

interviewing 

The  frequency  and  severity  of  gastrointestinal  reactions  and 
myelosuppression were assessed by reviewing the patient’s electronic 
medical  record  and 
the  attending  physician. 
Gastrointestinal reactions included decreased appetite, nausea and 
vomiting,  difficulty  eating,  diarrhea,  and  mouth  ulcers. 
Myelosuppression was characterized by varying degrees of reduction 
in  white  blood  cells,  platelets,  hemoglobin,  and  neutrophils.  Both 
myelosuppression  and  gastrointestinal  reactions  were  graded 
according  to  the  classification  standards  set  by  the  World  Health 
Organization, utilizing a scale ranging from 0 to IV degree (38).

2.5.9 Exercise-related adverse events

Exercise-related adverse events were recorded during the exercise 
intervention. These events were categorized as serious adverse events 
if they resulted in death, posed a life-threatening situation, necessitated 
hospitalization (or prolonged hospitalization), or caused sustained 
severe disability or incapacity.

2.6 Statistical analysis

Outcome  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  basis  of  modified 
intention-to-treat analyses (39). Continuous variables are expressed 
as  mean ± standard  error  (X ± se),  and  categorical  variables  are 
expressed as n (%). Shapiro–Wilk’s and Levene’s tests were used to 
assess normality and homogeneity of variance, respectively. Baseline 
values  were  compared  using  independent  t  tests  for  continuous 
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables (χ2). Missing 
data were filled in using the median value of multiple imputations (five 
imputations).  Differences  in  outcome  indicators  between  the  two 
groups after the intervention were compared by repeated measures 
ANOVA using a general linear model when baseline values were not 
significantly different, and by analysis of covariance when baseline 
values were significantly different. Bonferroni correction was used for 
post hoc comparisons. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 25 
(IBM, United States), with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

3 Results

3.1 Patient’s basic information

The flow of participants in the study is in Figure 2. A total of 44 
patients  were  recruited  (23  patients  in  the  exercise  group  and  21 
patients in the control group), and a total of four patients were lost, of 
which two were lost because of changing hospitals for treatment (two 
in  the  control  group),  one  changed  chemotherapy  regimen  in  the 
middle  of  the  day  (one  in  the  exercise  group),  and  one  had  poor 

adherence to chemotherapy for personal reasons (one patient in the 
exercise group), and finally, 40 patients were left (21 in the exercise 
group and 19 in the control group). There was no difference in the 
basic information of the lost patients in the two groups. In addition, 
there was no significant difference in the basic information between 
the control group and the exercise group (p > 0.05) (Table 1).

3.2 Changes in patients’ physical and 
mental health

3.2.1 The health-related physical fitness

As  shown  in  Table  2,  before  the  intervention,  there  were  no 
significant differences in the indicators between the two groups. After 
the intervention, a significantly higher relative VO2peak (+2.425 mL/
kg/min, p = 0.003) and handgrip strength (+7.100 kg, p < 0.001) in the 
exercise group compared with the control group. The body fat mass 
(+1.016 kg, p = 0.013), body fat percentage (+1.426%, p = 0.009), and 
visceral fat area (+7.174 cm2, p = 0.011) were significantly higher, while 
handgrip strength (−1.247 kg, p = 0.017) was significantly lower after 
the intervention than before the intervention in the control group. The 
waist  circumference  (−3.024 cm, p  = 0.011)  and  waist-to-hip  ratio 
(−0.031, p = 0.003) were significantly lower, while handgrip strength 
(+3.062 kg, p < 0.001) was significantly higher after the intervention 
than before the intervention in the exercise group.

A  post  hoc  sensitivity  analysis  for  missing  data  with  multiple 
imputations was performed by comparing the results of general linear 
model repeated measure ANOVA before and after multiple imputation 
(Table 3).

3.2.2 PAEE

As shown in Table 4, there was no significant difference in PAEE 
between the two groups before the intervention. After the intervention, a 
significantly higher PAEE in the exercise group compared with the control 
group (+736.553 MET/min/w, p = 0.001). The PAEE was significantly 
lower in the control group (−122.026 MET/min/w, p = 0.039), while 
significantly  higher  in  the  exercise  group  (+517.738  MET/min/w, 
p = 0.001) after the intervention than before the intervention.

3.2.3 Anxiety and depression

As  shown  in  Table  5,  there  were  no  significant  differences  in 
anxiety  and  depression  between  the  two  groups  before  the 
intervention. After the intervention, a significantly lower scores both 
in anxiety (−5.737, p = 0.007) and depression (−7.000, p = 0.028) in 
the exercise group compared with the control group. Both anxiety 
(+4.368, p = 0.004) and depression (+4.474, p = 0.025) scores were 
higher  in  the  control  group  after  the  intervention  than  before 
the intervention.

3.2.4 Cancer-related fatigue

As shown in Table 6, there were no significant differences in the 
score  of  the  three  subscales  between  the  two  groups  before  the 
intervention. After the intervention, a significantly lower scores both 
in physical fatigue (−6.105, p < 0.001) and affective fatigue (−3.579, 
p < 0.001) in the exercise group compared with the control group. The 
scores of physical fatigue (+4.158, p = 0.002), affective fatigue (+1.474, 
p = 0.007), and cognitive fatigue (+2.632, p = 0.018) were higher in the 
control group after the intervention than before the intervention.

3.2.5 Sleep quality

As shown in Table 7, there were significant between group 
differences in sleep latency, sleep efficiency and total score before 
intervention.  Analysis  of  covariance  showed  that  there  was  no 
significant  difference  between  the  two  groups  after  the 
intervention  (p  > 0.05).  After  the  intervention,  a  significantly 
lower scores in subjective sleep quality (−0.632, p = 0.010), sleep 
disturbances  (−0.632,  p  = 0.004),  and  daytime  dysfunction 
(−0.842,  p  = 0.007)  in  the  exercise  group  compared  with  the 
control group.

The score of sleep disturbances was significantly higher in the 
control  group  after  the  intervention  than  before  the  intervention 
(+0.597, p = 0.004).

3.2.6 QoL

As shown in Table 8, there were no significant differences in the 
score  of  the  five  subscales  between  the  two  groups  before  the 
intervention. After the intervention, a significantly lower scores in 
physical  well-being  (−6.747,  p  < 0.001)  and  emotional  well-being 
(−2.263, p = 0.019), while a significantly higher scores in functional 
well-being (+8.474, p < 0.001) in the exercise group compared with the 
control  group.  Physical  health  score  in  the  control  group  were 
significantly higher after the intervention than before the intervention 
(+5.158, p < 0.001). Functional health score in the exercise group were 

significantly higher after the intervention than before the intervention 
(+2.667, p = 0.017).

3.2.7 Gastrointestinal reactions and 
myelosuppression

During the exercise intervention, patients in the control group 
received a total of 76 anthracycline-based chemotherapy treatments, 
while  patients  in  the  exercise  group  received  a  total  of  84 
anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  treatments.  The  occurrence  of 
gastrointestinal  reactions  and  myelosuppression  in  the  patients  is 
shown in Table 9.

3.2.8 Exercise-related adverse events and 
exercise adherence

No serious exercise-related adverse events were observed during 
the exercise intervention. However, patients in the exercise group did 
experience non-serious events during exercise, including toe pain, 
knee pain, and weakness, as detailed in Table 10.

Out of the 720 planned sessions (18 carried out 36 sessions and 3 
carried out 24 sessions) for the exercise group, patients participated in 
589 sessions, resulting in an average adherence rate of 81.8% (range 
61.1% ~ 100%), Additionally, the average adherence to exercise cycle 
duration was 91.9% (range 70.0% ~ 100%), and the average adherence 
to exercise intensity was 92.5% (range 78.6% ~ 100%).

4 Discussion

The main finding of this study was that the body fat mass, body 
fat percentage, and visceral fat area were significantly higher after the 
intervention than before the intervention in the control group, while 
the waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio were significantly lower 
after  the  intervention  than  before  the  intervention  in  the  exercise 
group. Additionally, relative VO2peak and handgrip strength were 

significantly  increased,  and  overall  sleep  quality  and  QOL  were 
significantly improved, while anxiety, depression and cancer-related 
fatigue level significantly reduced in the exercise group compared to 
the  control  group.  Notably  the  exercise  intervention  was  well-
tolerated,  with  no  reports  of  serious  adverse  events  among 
participants.  Furthermore,  individuals  in  the  exercise  group 
experienced fewer gastrointestinal reactions and myelosuppression 
symptoms, with overall less severe symptoms compared to the control 
group. These findings underscore the safety and potential benefits of 
wearable  device-based  aerobic  exercise  during  chemotherapy  for 
breast  cancer  patients.  Moreover,  the  observed  improvements  in 
fitness levels suggest broader implications for enhancing overall health 
and well-being in this population.

Studies  have  demonstrated 

that  patients  undergoing 
chemotherapy  for  breast  cancer  often  experience  weight  gain  and 
adverse alterations in body composition, characterized primarily by 
an increase in fat mass without concurrent loss of muscle mass (7). 
This heightened adiposity elevates the risk of tumor recurrence and 
diminishes treatment response (7, 8). Notably, the accumulation of fat 
in the abdomen, particularly excessive visceral fat, is strongly linked 
to the onset of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (42), thereby 
influencing  the  trajectory  and  efficacy  of  cancer  treatment  and 
heightening  the  risk  of  cancer-related  mortality  (43).  Waist 
circumference and waist-to-hip ratio serve as standard indicators for 
diagnosing abdominal obesity and exhibit positive correlations with 
total visceral fat quantified through abdominal CT scans (42, 44). A 
key  finding  of  this  study  was  the  significant  reduction  in  waist 
circumference and waist-to-hip ratio observed in the exercise group, 
while the control group had a significant increase in body fat mass, 
body fat percentage, and visceral fat area following the intervention. 
This suggests that aerobic exercise may effectively prevent fat gain and 
improve fat distribution among breast cancer patients, thereby holding 
meaningful clinical significance in reducing the risk of cardiovascular 
disease and cancer recurrence. There were no differences in weight 
loss,  BMI,  and  several  indicators  of  body  fat  accumulation  and 
distribution between the two groups, it may take more time to observe 
significant changes, and exercise could prevent or at least slow down 
the rate of growth in the negative direction.

Another  important  finding  from  our  study  was  that  relative 
VO2peak  and  handgrip  strength  were  significantly  increased.  It  is 
worth  noting  that  for  every  additional  1 mL/kg/min  increase  in 
oxygen uptake in women, the risk of all-cause mortality decreases by 
11.3% (45). Although the relative VO2peak in the exercise group of 
our study increased by 0.71 mL/kg/min, which was lower than the 
expected increase reported in previous research (46), the increase of 
2.425 mL/kg/min in the exercise group compared with the decrease in 
VO2peak  in  the  control  group  suggests  that  aerobic  exercise  was 
effective in preventing the decrease in VO2peak. Furthermore, the 
percentage of functional disability was lower in the exercise group 
compared to the control group after the intervention (35% vs. 75%). 
Enhanced CRF enables patients to experience reduced fatigue and 
dyspnea during daily and recreational activities (46). Additionally, the 
increased  grip  strength  observed  in  the  exercise  group  might 
contribute to an improved functional domain of QoL and aid in their 
return to routine activities (47). Patients with cancer who have higher 
grip  strength  may  have  better  performance  in  daily  activities  and 
recreational tasks requiring upper extremity strength, such as towel 
wringing,  vacuuming,  gardening,  shopping,  and  exercising  (14).

Moreover,  greater  grip  strength  may  correlate  with 
fewer 
co-morbidities and reduced surgical complications (e.g., lymphedema, 
muscle adhesions, and decreased mobility) (14). Finally, higher grip 
strength has been associated with a reduced risk of mortality. The 
cut-off of low handgrip strength less than 16.1 kg was associated with 
cancer mortality in women with breast cancer, with a hazard ratio of 
1.593 (15, 48). The relative increase of 4.32 kg in the exercise group 
compared  to  the  control  group’s  decrease  in  handgrip  strength 
effectively prevented a decline in handgrip strength.

Consistent with the results of the present study, Chen et al. (49) 
found that a home-based exercise regimen of 3 days per week, with 
each  session  lasting  40 min,  significantly  reduced  anxiety  and 
depression  compared  to  usual  care  treatments.  The  mechanisms 
through which exercise improves anxiety and depression encompass 
both biological and psychosocial factors, including the production of 
“pleasure” chemicals in the brain (e.g., endorphins, dopamine), neural 
signaling  repair,  reduction  of  inflammation,  exposure  to  pleasant 
outdoor  environments,  social  interaction,  distraction  from  stress, 
enhanced self-efficacy, and increased self-esteem (50). Additionally, a 
review by Singh et al. (51) revealed that exercise interventions lasting 
≤12 weeks were more effective in alleviating anxiety and depression 
compared to that lasting ≥12 weeks. This difference may be attributed 
to exercise adherence, so how to help patients maintain training is a 
challenge,  highlighting  the  importance  of  selecting  appropriate 
approaches to optimize adherence to the long-term exercise regimen.
A novel finding of this study was the observation that the exercise 
group 
and 
fewer  gastrointestinal 
myelosuppression and exhibited less severe symptoms compared to 
the control group, implying that aerobic exercise might relieve the 
gastrointestinal  reactions  and  myelosuppression  commonly 
associated with chemotherapy. Myelosuppression, characterized by 
a  decrease  in  leukocyte  count,  is  a  frequent  side  effect  of 
immune  system  and 
chemotherapy,  weakening  the  body’s 
predisposing individuals to serious infections and bleeding. Good 
sleep  quality  is  crucial  for  immune  function,  as  it  enhances 
sympathetic excitability to adrenergic receptor-mediated actions in 
bone marrow cells and regulates the migration efficiency of bone 
marrow stem cells, thereby stimulating leukocyte proliferation (52). 
Following  the  intervention,  the  exercise  group  demonstrated 
improved sleep duration and experienced fewer sleep disturbances 
and less daytime dysfunction compared to the control group. Sleep 
quality is influenced by various factors, including physical activity 
level,  physical 
spirituality,  and 
improvements in these aspects may contribute to enhanced sleep

6 Conclusion

Chemotherapeutic drug-induced vagal reflexes, leading to the 
gag reflex, have been associated with pentraxin receptor-3 (5-HT3) 
inhibition  (53).  However,  studies  have  indicated  that  exercise 
functions as a 5-HT3 agonist, thus potentially alleviating depression 
(54).  Therefore,  aerobic  exercise  may  alleviate  gastrointestinal 
reactions through alternative pathways. Cao et al. (52) proposed that 
an optimistic perception gives patients a sense of control over their 
disease  and  enables  effective  coping  with  adverse  effects  of 
and 
chemotherapy, 
myelosuppression. Aerobic exercise could potentially reduce patients’ 
perceptual stress, thereby fostering a greater sense of control over 
adverse  effects.  This  may  also  be  one  of  the  reasons  why  aerobic

intervention (55, 56). In this study, smart wearable devices were used 
in this study for supervision and management to improve patients’ 
exercise  adherence  (20–22).  The  notable  improvement  in  exercise 
adherence  contributed  significantly  to  the  substantial  increase  in 
PAEE and the enhancement of physical and mental health among 
patients  in  the  exercise  group.  However,  it  is  unclear  if  it  would 
generate additional benefits compared to aerobic exercise without 
wearable devices.

5 Limitations and suggestion

The study has several limitations, first, comparisons of the 
effects of exercise without and with wearable devices were not 
made due to the challenge of recruiting large number of patients 
in the clinical setting. Second, although exercise workouts were 
scheduled for patients three times a week, the increase in PAEE 

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that engaging in moderate 
to  high-intensity  wearable  device-based  aerobic  exercise  for  three 
times a week over a period of 12 weeks yields numerous benefits for 
breast  cancer  patients  undergoing  chemotherapy.  The  observed 
improvements in physical and mental health may empower patients, 
fostering a more energetic and positive mindset to combat cancer. 
Importantly, exercise serves as a non-side-effective, non-resistant, and 
cost-effective intervention compared to pharmacological treatments.
