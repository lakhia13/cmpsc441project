Abstract
Dementia Day Care Centres (DDCCs) are defined as services providing care and rehabilitation to people with dementia 
associated with behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) in a semi-residential setting. According to available 
evidence, DDCCs may decrease BPSD, depressive symptoms and caregiver burden. The present position paper reports a 
consensus of Italian experts of different disciplines regarding DDCCs and includes recommendations about architectural 
features, requirements of personnel, psychosocial interventions, management of psychoactive drug treatment, prevention 
and care of geriatric syndromes, and support to family caregivers. DDCCs architectural features should follow specific cri-
teria and address specific needs of people with dementia, supporting independence, safety, and comfort. Staffing should be 
adequate in size and competence and should be able to implement psychosocial interventions, especially focused on BPSD. 
Individualized care plan should include prevention and treatment of geriatric syndromes, a targeted vaccination plan for 
infectious diseases including COVID-19, and adjustment of psychotropic drug treatment, all in cooperation with the general 
practitioner. Informal caregivers should be involved in the focus of intervention, with the aim of reducing assistance burden 
and promoting the adaptation to the ever-changing relationship with the patient.

Introduction

The establishment of Dementia Day Care Centres (DDCCs) 
dates back to 1979 in the UK [1]. Across the years, several 
scientific data have supported the use of semi-residential 
care for people with dementia, despite some limitations 
such as heterogeneous care models, diverse outcome meas-
ures and lack of randomized intervention studies. The large 
majority of studies showed efficacy in reducing depressive 
symptoms [2, 3] and behavioural and psychological symp-
toms in dementia (BPSD) [2–6] as well as in stimulating 
preserved cognitive abilities [4], although a few less recent 
studies reported no significant effects [7, 8]. Several stud-
ies found that semi-residential care may also represent a

valuable support of family caregivers, reducing caregiver 
burden [2, 3, 9–11], although a systematic review on this 
topic concluded that, taken as a whole, literature data are 
ambiguous [12].

Several factors may explain the conflicting data, includ-
ing the number of days/hours the participants attended the 
DDCC (is some cases only 1–2 days per week). Some patient 
and caregiver-related factors can limit the frequency of utili-
zation of this service, including perceived loss of autonomy, 
denial, guilt or economic constraints [13]. Context factors, 
such as poor availability, social system complexity or lack of 
adequate information may further decrease the access [13]. 
The quality and types of psychosocial interventions deliv-
ered (the less recent of the cited articles generally used 'low-
tech' interventions) also could impact on the results, as well 
as methodological constraints. Indeed, with these patients, 
equivalence between the comparison groups is difficult to 
achieve, and randomization is also often impossible [14].

Moreover, in some studies participants of the control group 
received some amount of treatment. For example, control 
caregivers in the study of Zank and Schacke [4] received 
respite care at home, so they did not meaningfully differ 
from caregivers using adult day care for their relative.

Semi-residential care can decrease the risk of hospitaliza-
tion [8], possibly through the prevention of BPSD exacerba-
tions and the monitoring of chronic pathologies and geriat-
ric syndromes. Whether it would also help to postpone the 
dementia patient's admission to a nursing home is still a 
matter of debate. Wimo et al. showed that attending a DDCC 
could avoid or delay permanent institutionalization [7], but 
other studies did not replicate or even reverse this finding [8, 
15, 16]. However, admission to a nursing home may be inde-
pendent of the patient's condition and the caregiver's stress 
and may be due to contingencies (e.g. caregiver illness) or 
to caregiver age (13). Other unmeasured factors such as an 
increased propensity to institutionalization when the patient 
starts spending a lot of time away from home might also play 
a role (15,16). In this respect, the effect might also depend 
on when the patient enters the DDCC, i.e. whether in the 
advanced stages of the disease, when the patient is severely 
impaired or at an earlier stage. In the first case, caregivers 
may be so burdened that the relief provided by DDCC might 
actually hasten institutionalization [17].

In Italy, the first experiences of semi-residential care 
for older subjects date back to the 1980s, with social ser-
vices dedicated to older subjects with preserved functional 
autonomy, while the first day care centres for disabled older 
subjects affected by dementia date back to the 1990s, in the 
Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna and Toscana regions [18]. The 
presence of DDCCs has been subsequently included among 
“Essential levels of assistance” guaranteed by the Italian 
National Health Service for people with dementia in need of 
“rehabilitation, reorientation and safeguarding” [19]. With 
regard to funding, the Italian National Health Service cov-
ers the healthcare costs of the service (e.g. nursing, physi-
otherapy), which represents 50% of the total fee, while social 
costs (including basic daily care and accommodation) are 
charged to the person with dementia and his/her family, in 
proportion to the income, and the remaining share is covered 
by the municipality [20, 21].

In the present document, DDCCs are defined as semi-
residential structures aimed at providing social and health 
care for a specific target of people with dementia, namely 
those suffering from clinically significant BPSD who require 
assistance and rehabilitation approach for a definite period 
of time. People who attend DDCCs should preferably be able 
to walk, independently or with assistance.

Since 2011, the “Italian Group on Dementia Day Care 
Centres”, a multidisciplinary group of professionals involved 
in geriatric medicine, has been working on drafting an expert 
consensus on day care for older subjects with dementia [22]. 

This article presents the recommendations developed by the 
experts’ panel.

The following chapters include a summary of the guid-
ance  regarding  different  areas  of  care  analysed  by  the 
authors, namely care pathway, care environment, require-
ment of personnel, main psychosocial interventions, use of 
psychoactive treatment, management of geriatric syndromes, 
infection prevention, and support to family and caregivers.

Methods

The guidance presented in this article has been developed 
by a multidisciplinary panel of experts including geriatri-
cians, psychiatrists, psychologists, architects, nurses, physi-
otherapists, occupational therapists, social health educators 
and music therapists. All panellists were professionals with 
many years of experience in long-term care for dementia 
and/or experts in research methodology. Multiprofessional 
subgroups were set up with the aim of searching the litera-
ture and developing guidance on specific issues:

–  DDCC definition, norms, and care pathway
–  Physical environment
–  Personnel
–  Psychosocial interventions
–  Drug treatment
–  Geriatric syndromes
–  Caregiver support

The experts were not asked to compulsorily conduct a 
systematic literature review with specific keywords, because 
the purpose of the work was not to develop a formal guide-
line. The proposals from each subgroup were discussed by 
the entire panel at subsequent meetings on the sidelines of 
the Italian conference on Alzheimer's day care centres. The 
work started in 2011 and since then the text has undergone 
numerous revisions and updates, which were also necessi-
tated by advances in scientific research in this area.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic slowed the 
panel's work and also prompted the addition of specific 
recommendations on the prevention of infections. Follow-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic, several DDCCs have also 
adopted instruments of telecare, including tele-monitoring 
with information–communication technology techniques 
and the use of technology to foster social inclusion and pro-
vide remote psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions. 
Although the authors acknowledge the importance of this 
promising field, they also believe that the available litera-
ture is not sufficient yet to provide a guidance on telecare 
in DDCCs.

Care pathway for dementia day care 
recipients

The admission to DDCCs should follow an assessment 
of the patient by a memory clinic [23, 24] and a compre-
hensive assessment by the healthcare district commission 
about the appropriateness of admission, which usually 
decides for a limited (3–6 months), renewable period of 
attendance. Once the admission is confirmed, an individu-
alized care plan (ICP) is drawn up by the DDCC staff, 
in agreement with family members and the general prac-
titioner (GP). The ICP includes clinical, social, psycho-
affective and functional problems identified during the 
comprehensive geriatric assessment; identifies the care 
needs  and  the  strategies  to  pursue  assistance  targets; 
establishes regular checks, aimed at evaluating the results 
achieved and/or to update objectives or strategies [23, 24].
We recommend that the admission to DDCCs be grad-
ual and preceded by a contact with family members. The 
ICP must guarantee social inclusion, psychosocial inter-
ventions, physical activity and nursing and rehabilitative 
interventions as needed, to be performed individually or 
in small groups. If necessary, the discharge from the ser-
vice can be followed by a home care assistance aimed at 
facilitating the return at home or the possible transfer to a 
different long-term care service.

Environment as a therapeutic intervention

DDCCs architectural features should be based on the pecu-
liar needs of people with dementia with the purpose of pro-
viding adequate conditions of safety and comfort, supporting 
their independence, and creating a meaningful and stimulat-
ing environment. Scientific evidence supports the signifi-
cant impact of environment on both health and well-being of 
people with dementia [25]. Particularly, an adequate living 
arrangement seems able to reduce the occurrence of behav-
ioural disorders, to maintain preserved functional capacities 
and to support spatial and temporal orientation. Therefore, 
the environment could become an important pillar of assis-
tance together with pharmacological and psychosocial treat-
ments [26, 27]. Conversely, unsuitable environmental char-
acteristics can trigger or increase behavioural disorders [28, 
29]. An environmental element with a specific psychosocial 
purpose is represented by therapeutic garden that may help 
to decrease BPSD [30–32]. Moreover, the facility must be 
provided with an infirmary, in order to enable an adequate 
first aid in case of sudden injury or illness.

Building design must also take into account the needs 
of care team to facilitate their work and to reduce physical 

and emotional burden. The DDCCs should be fully acces-
sible,  possibly  located  within  the  city  centre,  next  to 
community meeting places, to foster integration in social 
context.

Minimal  structural  requirements  of  semi-residential 
services for older subjects with disability include: locali-
zation in places easy to reach, to support social inclusion, 
availability of spaces devoted to socialization and com-
mon activities, availability of at least one accessible bath-
room for every 10 care recipients and a maximum capacity 
of 30 care recipients [33]. In keeping with the minimal 
requirement of 40–45 sq m per resident in residential care 
services  for  disabled  older  adults  [34]  and  subtracting 
the minimum surface of overnight spaces, we advise a 
minimum surface area of 25–30 sq m for each day care 
recipient.

Table 1 summarizes the main design features that should 
be respected for the realization of the DDCCs, in parallel 
with specific impairments and needs of people with demen-
tia that should be addressed.

Personnel of DDCCs and their roles

The working group in DDCCs includes social and health-
care personnel, with specific skills in caring for older people 
with dementia and BPSD, capable of working together as 
a team. Aims of staff activity include taking care of day 
care recipients, promoting their interaction with each other, 
supporting caregivers, maintaining contacts with the socio-
cultural entities outside DDCCs and cooperating with local 
services and GPs.

Minimal organization requirements of semi-residential 
services for disabled older subjects [33] include the presence 
of a service coordinator and the predisposition of an ICP for 
each care recipient. Specific qualifying standards for DDCC 
include a minimum of 80 min of total assistance per care 
recipient per day and the availability of nurse, nursing assis-
tant and psychologist [19]. A more recently approved official 
document [41] includes a list of different professional roles 
involved in dementia care, whose presence we recommend 
in a DDCC (Table 2).

The coordinator is responsible for interaction with health-
care district, GPs, local services and family members. The 
coordinator is also in charge of service organization, admin-
istration, monitoring of performance and of quality assur-
ance. The care team as a whole is responsible for drafting 
and executing the ICP, including the identification of a case 
coordinator (case manager), who coordinates interventions 
included in the plan. Personnel included in the care with 
specific roles and expected workload for a standard (15 care 
recipients) DDCC are summarized in Table 2 [18, 41, 42].

tion and identification of spaces and objects [36]

Worsening social interaction associated with impersonal environment 

Design spaces with domestic appearance and size [36–38]

and furnishings [36–38]

Environmental well-being, sensory aspects

Orientation, autonomy and mood affected by environmental character-

istics (lighting, noise, temperature and odour) [28, 36, 39]

Provide suitable lighting levels for the type of activity carried out, allow 
for the regulation of temperature, the dispensation of aromas and the 
presence of environmental stimuli, such as music, images and colours. 
Reduce noise level [28, 36, 39]

Flexibility

Time-dependent variations of needs of people with dementia and 

Flexibility and adaptability of spaces, according to the degree of disabil-

caregivers [40]

Occupational well-being

Increasing work and psychological burden of care team due to envi-

ronmental characteristics [40]

Outdoor spaces (therapeutic garden)

Psychological and behavioural well-being associated with the contact 

of natural elements and physical activity [31–33]

Emergency and health care services

First aid for acute injuries and illnesses

ity, type of activities carried out and daily organization [40]

Provide spaces for the exclusive use of staff that allow visual control of 
care recipients’ spaces. The configuration of the space and the type of 
furnishings must facilitate care and therapeutic activities, indoor and 
outdoor [26, 40]

Provide safe spaces, which facilitate physical activity, orientation and 
control by the staff. Seed native plants to facilitate recognition of the 
seasons and sensory stimulation (sight, smell, hearing, touch, aromas 
and fountain with running water) [31–33]

An infirmary must be provided, with adequate equipment (examination 
bed; sphygmomanometer; stethoscope; thermometer; pulse oximeter; 
glucometer; bladder catheter kit; portable oxygen tanks; BLS-D kit; 
AED; EKG unit)

DDCCs dementia day care centres, BLS-D  basic life support defibrillation; AED automated external defibrillator, EKG electrocardiogram

Psychosocial interventions

Scientific evidence is available supporting the efficacy of 
psychosocial  interventions  (PSIs)  in  reducing  cognitive 
decline and BPSD and in promoting well-being and quality 
of life of people with dementia and their carers [46–48]. 
PSIs include activities aimed at enhancing preserved abili-
ties and capacities of each patient, reducing social isolation 
and preserving self-esteem and personal identity [49].

PSIs can be grouped into four categories, according to 
their focus: cognition and function oriented, behaviour ori-
ented, emotion oriented and sensory stimulation oriented 
(summarized in Tables 3a, b). Cognition- and function-
oriented interventions (Table 3a) are aimed at maintaining 
cognitive and daily functioning as long as possible [46]. 
The group of behaviour-, emotion- and sensory stimulation-
oriented interventions (Table 3b) has a crucial role for the 

treatment of BPSDs [50, 51] and should be considered as a 
first-line treatment in this setting [51], due to limited effi-
cacy and increased risk of adverse events associated with 
antipsychotics. The evidence currently available on each 
intervention is summarized in the last column of the tables. 
All the listed interventions have been shown to have some 
positive effects, although, for some of them, the results are 
more uncertain than for others. Thus, all interventions could 
be delivered to dementia day care recipients, but the choice 
to apply one of them rather than another also depends on 
local factors (e.g. centre resources, space, available profes-
sionals) and on the preferences and specific requirements of 
the care recipients.

The proposed activities should be simple and of limited 
duration, to avoid tiredness or stress; activities should also 
be person-centred according to stage of illness, needs and 
wishes of recipients. Therefore, a careful clinical, functional

and  cognitive  assessment  is  required,  coupled  with  the 
knowledge of personal history. The effectiveness over time 
of PSIs should be assessed through validated scales, such as 
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory [52] and the Cohen–Mans-
field Agitation Inventory for behavioural assessment [53]. 
Moreover, the effects of PSIs on quality of life should be 
regularly evaluated through a scale validated for the spe-
cific level of dementia [54]. Examples of tailored, person-
centred interventions are presented in a video recorded at the 
Monteoliveto Centre in Pistoia (https:// www. youtu be. com/ 
watch?v= oGeP8 nGCMRg).

Drug treatment of BPSD

While PSIs must be considered as the first-line treatment of 
BPSD, the association of pharmacological interventions has 
a synergistic effect in improving neuropsychiatric symptoms, 
especially in long-term care [91]. Pharmacological interven-
tion may be considered in case of severe BPSD unresponsive 
to non-pharmacological measures and when BPSD entail 
great suffering or risk [92].

Antipsychotics (APs) are still the therapy with more con-
sistent documentation of efficacy in the short term, but with 
a risk of serious adverse events, including higher risk of 
mortality and stroke. Atypical APs are prescribed at least in 
25% of patients with dementia [93]; since 2000 their use has 
been the object of warning about their safety in patients with 
dementia. In 2008, the warning was extended to typical APs 
too. The warning issued by the national and international 
regulatory authorities reports about an increased mortality 
rate in people with dementia treated with APs, with the risk 
being even higher with typical in comparison with atypi-
cal ones [94]. Therefore, when required, the use of atypical 
APs is still preferred over typical ones for the treatment of 
psychosis and aggressive behaviour in DDCCs [92]. Lim-
ited evidence is available regarding long-term use of APs. 
A prolonged treatment may be appropriate for cases with 
persistent and severe symptoms which show a good clinical 
response, although an attempt to reduce and eventually dis-
continue the therapy should be periodically considered [95].
Drug  treatments  of  BPSD  alternative  to  APs  include 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and trazodone, with 
citalopram having the strongest evidence for agitation, but 
with an increased risk of QT prolongation [96]. Other drugs 
with possible efficacy on BPSD include memantine [97], 
antiepileptics [98] and ginkgo biloba extract [99]. The use 
of analgesic drugs has been reported to reduce BPSD in 
nursing home residents [100].

According to available recommendations [92, 101, 102], 
psychopharmacological  management  in  DDCCs  should 
include  the  thorough  appraisal  of  previous  drug  treat-
ments,  the  assessment  of  type,  frequency,  severity  and 

possible triggers of BPSD using standardized scales (e.g. 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory) and the possibility of drug de-
prescription at admission and of a gradual dose tapering. 
Monotherapy should be preferred, starting treatment using 
the minimum effective dose, discontinuing after 2 weeks in 
the absence of an evident clinical response and attempting 
the interruption after 4 months in case of efficacy. A care-
ful monitoring of possible adverse events should include 
the evaluation of new-onset or worsening of parkinsonism, 
immobilization and fall risk, presence of cardiovascular dis-
ease, QTc interval, serum potassium levels and co-occurring 
prescriptions. Exchange of information with the GP and 
the memory clinic on this issue is recommended.

Prevention and treatment of geriatric 
syndromes

Geriatric syndromes are typical conditions of old age, result-
ing from physiological and pathological changes, with com-
mon risk factors, often coexisting in the same person and 
carrying the risk of worse prognosis [103].

The main geriatric syndromes that can be observed in 

DDCCs are listed below.

–  Falls are frequent in people with dementia in long-term 
care and may lead to severe consequences, including 
fractures, head trauma, hospitalization, institutionaliza-
tion, worsening disability and depression. Main risk fac-
tors for falls include sensory impairments, imbalance, 
specific drugs and polypharmacy, hypotension and envi-
ronmental obstacles [104].

–  Delirium is a dysfunction of awareness and attention, 
with fluctuating course during the day, that develops 
over a short period of time (hours to days), represents 
an acute change that cannot be explained by a coexisting 
neuropsychiatric condition, and is related to an underly-
ing potentially reversible cause (acute medical condition 
drugs), although being often multifactorial. Delirium is 
frequent in dementia and should be recognized and dif-
ferentiated from BPSD in DDCCs [105, 106].

–  Immobilization syndrome is the consequence of inter-
ruption or reduction of physical activity [107], due to 
ageing-associated mobility disability and vulnerability 
of the organism. In dementia, even minor pathological 
conditions may limit physical activity.

–  Pressure  sores  are  ischaemic  skin  lesions  caused  by 
immobilization and worsened by malnutrition, urinary/
faecal incontinence and peripheral hypoperfusion [108, 
109].

–  Urinary incontinence is highly prevalent in dementia and 
is associated with both psychological (reduction in self-
esteem, depression and sleep disturbance), medical con-

sequences (pressure sore risk), and increased care burden 
and risk of nursing home admission [110, 111].

–  Malnutrition in dementia is typically represented by pro-
tein–calorie undernutrition due to low intake of nutrients, 
potentially leading to loss of muscle mass and strength 
(sarcopenia) [112] with consequent increased risk of 
falls and worsening disability, reduced wounds’ healing 
capacity, weakening of immune response and higher risk 
of mortality [113].

–  Dysphagia is often associated with neuromotor signs 
(e.g. parkinsonism) and behavioural symptoms [114] 
and is typically present in severe stages of dementia. It 
increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia, dehydration, 
malnutrition and death [115].

–  Chronic and recurrent pain is an unpleasant sensory and 
emotional experience and in people with dementia may 
be the cause of BPSD, such as agitation and aggression 
[116], and is also associated with the decline of cognitive 
function and functional status [117].

Table 4 itemizes the assessment tools and types of inter-
ventions (treatment and prevention) proposed for each geri-
atric syndrome.

Vaccinations

Influenza and pneumococcal infections are recognized to 
be a significant health problem and cause of death, espe-
cially in fragile persons such as dementia people in DDCCs 
[136]. Vaccination is an effective measure to prevent the 
impact of these infections. Long-Term-Care Committee of 
the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America recom-
mends in long-term care facilities (LTCF) residents should 
receive vaccination at the beginning of the influenza season 
unless a contraindication exists or the patient refuses [137, 
138]. Moreover, the Society strongly supports influenza 
and pneumococcal vaccination of all healthcare personnel 
(HCP), including those who do not provide direct care [139]. 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [140] and herpes zoster 
[141] vaccinations are also recommended.

Infection prevention: the lesson 
from the COVID‑19 pandemic

In addition to the devastating effects on people's lives, 
with hundreds of deaths per day in the first phase of the 
pandemic, since 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has deeply 
impacted on the  care of older adults  with  Alzheimer’s 
disease. A recent review investigated the effects of the 
COVID-19 lockdown on neuropsychiatric symptoms, in 
people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment [142]. 

Data from 21 studies all around the world showed that 
symptoms such as depression, anxiety, agitation, irrita-
bility and apathy increased in this population during the 
lockdown, likely due to isolation and loss of services. The 
COVID-19 confinement also increased caregivers’ stress, 
independently of the dementia severity [143].

The serious effects of COVID-19 pandemic on both 
DDCCs  users  and  services  clearly  emerged  in  a  spe-
cific survey conducted in Italy, promoted by the Italian 
Group on Dementia Day Care Centres (unpublished data). 
Eighty-one out of 470 centres (private centres, n = 45; pub-
lic centres, n = 36), mostly in Northern (N = 44) or Central 
(N = 30) Italy, filled the questionnaire. On the date of the 
survey (April 2021), 28 centres were still closed due to the 
pandemic, and 53 had resumed activity after a period of 
suspension. Among the active centres, only 10% retained 
the number of care recipients admitted as in the pre-pan-
demic period, whereas the number was reduced by more 
than 50%, or less than 50%, in 21 and 24 centres, respec-
tively. Overall, there was a 60% reduction in the number of 
care recipients. Moreover, several centres had changed the 
number of days they were open and/or the opening hours.
As well as continuing to provide assistance in situa-
tions that require reduced physical contact, day care health 
workers must maintain their own safety and that of the 
users. To this purpose, guidelines have been drawn up by 
scientific societies and health authorities in individual 
countries [144] that will probably be modified according 
to the evolution of the pandemic. Specific procedures of 
containment are recommended, including:

(a) the periodic sanitization of environments;
(b) the identification of a “COVID-manager” for the 
prevention and control of healthcare-related infections; he/
she must be a person, specifically trained for COVID-19, 
who knows the place of care and its problems according to 
the type of patients in the facility to observe, prevent and 
manage critical issues in real time;

(c)  the  monitoring  of  own  body  temperature  by  all 
healthcare workers before the start of the work shift, with a 
ban on entering the facility and starting the shift if a body 
temperature above 37.5 °C or other symptoms relevant to 
COVID-19 are detected;

(d) the obligation for caregivers to report the onset of 
symptoms (fever, cough, respiratory difficulties, anosmia, 
ageusia, etc.) of both the subject and the other cohabitants 
before accessing the day care centres;

(e) depending on the characteristics of the care recipi-
ents, the possibility of rotating attendance to encourage 
more people to take part in the activities by extending 
the opening hours; users can therefore also be organized 
in two daily shifts (morning and afternoon) according to 
the preferences expressed by caregivers; social distancing 
must be guaranteed in the same environment;

(f) the need to follow up remotely care recipients who 
cannot access the centre, to maintain contact and monitor 
clinical conditions;

(g) the rescheduling of many internal activities to ensure 
security; for example, occupational therapy, cognitive stimu-
lation and physiotherapy activities should be carried out in 
small groups, in large, airy spaces or outdoors, trying to 
encourage the maintenance of social distance.

Support and training for informal caregivers

Family and caregivers represent the main assistance resource 
for people with dementia. Over time, care needs gradually 
intensify,  and  therefore  care  modalities  should  undergo 
continuous and dynamic changes [145]. Formal caregiv-
ers provide professional and paid assistance, while infor-
mal caregivers, usually a family member (the spouse and/or 
children), give assistance voluntarily and for free. The latter 
experience an emotional and social, as well as physical, bur-
den that can be alleviated by psychosocial and educational 
interventions [146, 147]. Unfortunately, though widely avail-
able in European countries, services of counselling, support 
and education for informal caregivers of people with demen-
tia are rarely utilized [148].

Gradual personality changes in people with dementia, often 
resulting in alteration of the relationship with their caregivers, 
can represent the beginning of a process of atypical or antici-
patory mourning for carers [149]. For these reasons, caregiv-
ers’ well-being should be cared for, with social support being 
an important protective factor [150] and specific interventions 
such as cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), including grief-
specific strategies, should be taken into account [151].

Caregiver education is usually organized as a group activ-
ity, aimed at improving the adaptation of carers to assistance 
needs, establishing a healthy relationship, teaching coping 
strategies and promoting the interpretation of verbal and 
non-verbal language [152].

In DDCCs, it is possible to modify the level of caregiv-
ers’ stress [2], not only by the relief from daily assistance, 
but also with the treatment of BPSD and through support, 
information and training of family members. The working 
group within DDCCs should take care of family members 
since the admission to the service. A caregiver assessment 
should be coupled with patient assessment and includes 
schooling, work activity, degree of kinship and cohabita-
tion with the patient, other relatives to assist, availability 
of other formal or informal caregivers, presence of inter-
personal conflicts, and the level of physical, emotional and 
social burden. Care burden should be assessed at admission 
and reassessed periodically with specific scales, such as the 
Caregiver Burden Inventory [153]. The interventions offered 
by DDCCs to families include active listening, individuals 

or group interventions, education on the characteristics of 
the disease, including legal issues, support to relational 
approach at home, management of pharmacological therapy, 
and adaptation of home environment. During the COVID-
19 pandemic, regular telephone contacts and videoconfer-
encing have become common forms of care support, which 
have been appreciated by caregivers [154], and their use 
should be maintained by DDCCs, especially for subjects 
who attend the service only few days per week. Psycho-
therapy for caregivers may be indicated in selected cases. 
Moreover, DDCCs can be an appropriate setting to discuss 
advance care planning for severe stages of the disease [155].

Conclusions

DDCCs should be considered an integral part of the treat-
ment of dementia with behavioural and psychological symp-
toms, as they provide both psychosocial interventions for 
affected subjects and support for caregivers. The availabil-
ity of an adequate physical environment, trained personnel 
and appropriate care approaches are crucial to attaining the 
therapeutic goals. The many existing centres in Italy are het-
erogeneous in terms of architectural features, organization, 
available professionals and interventions provided. Even 
most worrying are the inhomogeneous distribution and the 
overall shortage of such services. This paper is intended as 
a guide and a support for the organization of DDCCs and 
possibly for monitoring the quality of care delivered.
