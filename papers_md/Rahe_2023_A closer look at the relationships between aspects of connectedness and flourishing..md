connectedness and flourishing

Everyone  strives  for  personal  happiness  or  well-being.  Flourishing  is  a  broader 
concept  of  well-being.  To  better  understand  which  factors  are  associated  to 
people’s flourishing, we took a closer look at the relationships of flourishing with 
three  aspects  of  connectedness:  Connectedness  with  oneself  (self-love),  with 
others (pro-socialness), and with the surrounding nature (nature connectedness). 
Participants  were  138  adults  between  18  and  71 years  (M = 23.21,  SD = 7.90,  98 
women, 40 men). Significant positive correlations were found between flourishing 
and  self-love  and  between  flourishing  and  pro-socialness.  Furthermore,  nature 
connectedness  correlated  positively  with  self-love  and  with  pro-socialness.  A 
regression analysis revealed that all predictors explained 57.5% of the variance of 
the criterion flourishing. Self-love and pro-socialness were significant predictors 
of flourishing while nature connectedness was not. One explanation for the large 
correlations  between  self-love  and  flourishing  could  be  overlapping  aspects  in 
both  questionnaires.  The  fact  that  pro-socialness  is  a  stronger  predictor  than 
nature connectedness could be due to a more reciprocal reinforcement of pro-
social behavior. If a person treats another well, s/he is more likely treated well by 
that person which could reflect flourishing. Such a direct reciprocal relationship 
does not exist with nature.

1. Introduction

Everyone strives for personal happiness and well-being; however, the definition of those 
concepts is manifold. Seligman (2002) suggested that important elements of happiness were 
positive emotion, engagement, and meaning in life. Later, he described elements of well-being 
as  positive  emotion,  engagement,  relationships,  meaning,  and  accomplishment  (Seligman, 
2010). Diener (1984) defined well-being by external criteria such as virtue or holiness, the 
evaluation of one’s life in positive terms, and as a predominance of positive affect over negative 
affect. Next to happiness and well-being, the concept of flourishing exists. VanderWeele (2017) 
suggests looking more closely at flourishing as a broader concept of well-being. He argues that 
flourishing includes happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical health, meaning and 
purpose,  character  and  virtue,  and  close  social  relationships.  Diener  et  al.  (2010)  define 
flourishing as social-psychological prosperity and include human psychological needs, e.g., the 
need for competence, relatedness, and self-acceptance in their model of flourishing (see also 
Ryan and Deci, 2000).

Other authors define flourishing as one end of the mental health continuum on which the 
other end is languishing (Keyes, 2002) or consider flourishing “synonymous with a high level of

mental  well-being”  (Huppert  and  So,  2013,  p.  838).  Moreover, 
flourishing means the presence of both hedonic (“feeling good”) and 
eudaimonic (“functioning well”) well-being (Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 
2016). According to this, it is evident that flourishing is a complex 
concept with many aspects (Hone et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2022) 
demonstrated that the six domains of flourishing, emotional health, 
physical  health,  meaning  and  purpose,  character  strengths,  social 
connectedness, and financial security are independently associated 
with a greater composite flourishing score.

To measure flourishing, people are, for example, asked about their 
success in relationships, self-esteem, purpose, and optimism (Diener 
et al., 2010). However, there are also more complex measurements that 
measure  the  broader  components  of  composite  flourishing,  for 
example, the 40-item flourishing index, which consists of items of 
former questionnaires to each of the dimensions mentioned above 
(Lee et al., 2020). Many studies have investigated factors that influence 
flourishing (Yildirim, 2019; Goldstein et al., 2021). They have found 
that  flourishing  is  associated,  among  some  socio-demographic 
characteristics, with high levels of extraversion and conscientiousness 
and low levels of neuroticism (Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 2016). Being 
male, older, more educated, and married was connected to flourishing 
as well as superior profiles of psychosocial functioning (Keyes, 2002). 
Moreover, flourishing is correlated with essential need satisfaction 
(competency, relatedness, and autonomy) and with the factors of the 
Ryff  scales  (Ryff  and  Keyes,  1995,  autonomy,  mastery,  growth, 
relationships,  purpose,  and  self-acceptance)  (Diener  et  al.,  2010). 
Those studies provide evidence that connectedness is a relevant factor 
for flourishing. Wamsler and colleagues integrated the elements of 
compassion, empathy, kindness, and generosity into the concept of 
connectedness  which  are  all  related  to  pro-socialness  and  nature 
connectedness (Wamsler et al., 2021). According to this, it is important 
to  investigate  which  aspect  of  connectedness  is  associated  with 
people’s flourishing. For this, it is the main goal of this study to take a 
closer look at the relationships of flourishing with three aspects of 
connectedness: Connectedness with oneself (self-love), with others 
(pro-socialness), 
nature 
(nature connectedness).

the 

1.1. Self-love

Self-love is often falsely understood as narcissism (Brown and 
Bosson, 2001), selfishness (Fromm, 1939) or labeled as self-love but 
measured with a questionnaire about self-compassion or self-esteem. 
For  example,  self-compassion  integrates  the  components  of  self-
kindness,  common  humanity,  and  mindfulness  (Neff,  2003).  It  is 
related to compassion, which develops from love when an individual 
suffers. Self-love develops from love without suffering. In a qualitative 
interview study with Spanish-speaking adults from the US, self-love 
was associated with well-being (Hernandez et al., 2016). Henschke 
and Sedlmeier (2021) define self-love as an attitude of self-kindness, 
including self-contact, self-acceptance, and self-care. Self-contact is 
defined as giving attention to and awareness of oneself whereas self-
acceptance is being at peace with oneself and self-care being protective 
of and caring for oneself (Henschke and Sedlmeier, 2021). Regarding 
the  relationship  between  self-love  and  the  other  aspects  of 
connectedness 
investigated  here,  pro-socialness  and  nature 
connectedness,  one  study  found  positive  associations  between 

self-care and altruistic and pro-ecological behavior (Corral-Verdugo 
et al., 2021). The constructs in this study differ from the constructs in 
the present study: We used the broader concept of self-love whereas 
Corral-Verdugo et al. (2021) used self-care which is one component 
of  self-love  (Henschke  and  Sedlmeier,  2021).  Moreover,  altruistic 
behavior is only one aspect of prosocial behavior and in our study, 
nature connectedness was used instead of pro-ecological behavior. 
Nevertheless, positive relationships between the investigated variables 
of Corral-Verdugo et al. (2021) provide an indication that the three 
aspects of connectedness should be related as well. In another study 
using a structural model, it was shown that the factor sustainable 
behavior  contains  the  constructs  of  self-care,  altruism,  and 
pro-ecological behavior, and sustainable behavior is related to human 
well-being (Torres-Soto et al., 2022).

1.2. Pro-socialness and nature 
connectedness

Prosocial  behavior  describes  the  behavior  that  results  in  the 
benefit for others (Eisenberg, 1982). Martela and Ryan (2016) found 
in an experimental study where half of the participants were told that 
their participation in a computer game had a prosocial effect that this 
induction leads to different aspects of their own well-being (vitality, 
meaningfulness, positive affect). Altruism, as one specific form of 
pro-socialness, is also associated with nature connectedness (Otto 
et  al.,  2021)  and  life  satisfaction  (Becchetti  et  al.,  2017).  Nature 
connectedness  is  associated  with  different  aspects  of  well-being 
(vitality, autonomy, positive affect, personal growth), pro-socialness 
(altruistic  concerns),  and  self-love  (self-acceptance)  (Nisbet  and 
Zelenski, 2013). Moreover, a meta-analysis showed significant but 
small relationships between nature connectedness and eudaimonic 
and  hedonic  well-being  (Pritchard  et  al.,  2020).  There  was  no 
difference  between  the  effect  sizes  of  the  relationship  between 
eudaimonic  and  hedonic  well-being  and  nature  connectedness. 
Especially, people who are connected to nature have higher levels of 
self-reported personal growth, which gives a hint for the relationship 
between nature connectedness and self-love. Another recent meta-
analysis  investigated  the  relationship  between  connectedness  to 
nature and well-being (Wu and Jones, 2022). In that meta-analysis, 
sub-categories  of  well-being  were  emotional,  psychological,  and 
social well-being and flourishing was considered psychological well-
being.  Results  showed  a  significantly  large  relationship  between 
psychological well-being and nature connectedness (Wu and Jones, 
2022).  Other  studies  showed  positive  correlations  between  social 
connectedness and flourishing (Eraslan-Capan, 2016) and between 
nature-related  schemas  and  flourishing  (Diržytė  and  Perminas, 
2020). Nelson et al. (2016) investigated the positive effects of a 6-week 
intervention  of  prosocial  (other  kindness)  or  self-oriented  (self-
kindness) behavior on flourishing and positive and negative emotions 
in  US  adults.  Results  showed  that  pro-social  behavior  improves 
flourishing over and above self-oriented behavior. Comparable results 
for positive and negative emotions could illustrate that pro-social 
behavior had stronger effects than self-oriented kindness. The present 
study  aims  to  investigate  the  influence  of  three  aspects  of 
connectedness,  to  oneself-to  others,  and  to  nature,  on  peoples’ 
flourishing. This could help to decide which aspect of connectedness 
should  be  strengthened  to  enhance  someone’s  psychological

well-being. An intervention could then be implemented to investigate 
its effect on adults’ flourishing.

alpha = 0.92)  (Jansen  et  al.,  2022).  Internal  consistency  was  also 
excellent  in  our  sample  (Cronbach’s  alpha = 0.92,  McDonald’s 
omega = 0.92).

1.3. The goal of the study

2.2.3. Pro-socialness

The study’s main goal is to investigate relationships between the 
three aspects of connectedness and flourishing. We choose flourishing 
over well-being or life satisfaction because flourishing is considered a 
broader concept (VanderWeele, 2017). The following hypotheses will 
be investigated in detail: 1. The three aspects of connectedness, self-
love, pro-socialness, and nature connectedness are correlated to each 
other (Corral-Verdugo et al., 2021) and to flourishing (Eraslan-Capan, 
2016; Nelson et al., 2016; Diržytė and Perminas, 2020; Torres-Soto 
et al., 2022; Wu and Jones, 2022), 2. The three aspects of connectedness 
predict flourishing (Eraslan-Capan, 2016; Nelson et al., 2016; Diržytė 
and Perminas, 2020; Torres-Soto et al., 2022; Wu and Jones, 2022), and 
3.  The  relationship  between  self-love  and  flourishing  is  mediated 
through pro-socialness and nature connectedness.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

Participants were 138 adults between 18 and 71 years (M = 23.21, 
SD = 7.90,  98  women,  40  men).  Two  participants  had  completed 
apprenticeships, 131 had a high school leaving diploma, and 5 persons 
had other education degrees. To determine the sample size, G*Power 
(Faul  et  al.,  2007)  analyses  were  conducted  a  priori:  For  the  first 
hypothesis,  medium  effect  sizes  between  the  three  aspects  of 
connectedness  and  flourishing  are  assumed.  Due  to  the  multiple 
testing of six correlations, p was set to 0.0083 (Bonferroni corrected). 
The G*Power analysis resulted in 126 participants (1 – β = 0.80). For 
the second hypothesis, a medium effect size of f2 = 0.15 is assumed for 
the multiple regression analysis (1 – β = 0.80, α = 0.05). Therefore, 77 
participants were required for the second hypothesis.

2.2. Material

2.2.1. Flourishing

To measure flourishing, the Flourishing Scale (FS; Diener et al., 
2010, German version: Esch et al., 2013) was used. The questionnaire 
consisted  of  eight  items  (example  item:  I  lead  a  purposeful  and 
meaningful  life).  Participants  rated  each  item  on  a  7-point  Likert 
Scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. Esch et al. 
(2013) supported the reliability and validity of the German scale, with 
Cronbach’s  alphas  ranging  between  0.79  and  0.85.  In  our  sample, 
internal consistency was good (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84, McDonald’s 
omega = 0.85).

2.2.2. Self-love

Self-love  was  measured  with  the  Self-love  questionnaire 
(Henschke and Sedlmeier, n.d.). It consisted of 27 items (example 
item: I feel fine the way I am) and must be answered on a 5-point 
Likert scale ranging from 1 = not true at all to 5 = completely true. In a 
recent  study,  internal  consistency  was  excellent  (Cronbach’s 

Prosocial behavior was investigated with the Prosocialness Scale 
for Adults (Caprara et al., 2005). The questionnaire contains 16 items 
that  must  be  answered  on  a  5-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from 
1 = never/almost never true to 5 = almost always/always true (example 
item: I try to console those who are sad.). The questionnaire is based 
on  item  response  theory  (IRT).  Reliability  (α = 0.91),  difficulty 
parameter, and discrimination parameter were good, and the results 
of IRT analyses support effectiveness and sensitivity (Caprara et al., 
2005). For the German version, the questionnaire was forward and 
backward  translated.  Internal  consistency  was  good  (Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.87, McDonald’s omega = 0.87).

2.2.4. Nature connectedness

Nature connectedness was measured with the Connectedness to 
Nature Scale (CNS, Pasca et al., 2017). It consists of 13 items, which 
are  answered  on  a  5-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  1 = strongly 
disagree to 5 = strongly agree (example item: Like a tree can be part of 
a forest, I feel embedded within the broader natural world.). In this 
study, three items had to be excluded because of low corrected item-
total  correlations  (<  0.3).  For  the  remaining  10  items,  internal 
consistency  was  good  (Cronbach’s  alpha = 0.87,  McDonald’s 
omega = 0.87).

2.3. Procedure

The  survey  was  conducted  using  SoSciSurvey  (Leiner,  2019). 
Participants received an email with the link to the study. First, all 
participants  gave  their  informed  consent.  Then,  they  fill  out  a 
questionnaire regarding socio-demographics (sex, age, education), 
self-love, pro-socialness, nature connectedness, and flourishing. They 
were then thanked for their participation. The study was preregistered 
at osf,1 conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki 
declaration,  and  approved  by  the  Ethic  Research  Board  of  the 
University (no. 22-3,059-101).

2.4. Statistical analyses

First,  correlations  between  the  means  of  the  three  aspects  of 
connectedness, self-love, pro-socialness, and nature connectedness, 
and flourishing are calculated. A multiple regression analysis (enter 
method) with the criterion flourishing and the predictors self-love, 
pro-socialness, and nature connectedness has been calculated for the 
second  hypothesis.  For  the  third  hypothesis,  we  ran  a  mediation 
analysis using Process macro (Model 4, Hayes, 2018) with the criterion 
flourishing, the predictor self-love, and nature connectedness and 
pro-socialness as possible mediators. The analysis uses ordinary least 
squares regression, yielding unstandardized path coefficients for total,

direct, and indirect effects. Bootstrapping with 5,000 samples together 
with  heteroscedasticity  consistent  standard  errors  (Davidson  and 
MacKinnon, 1993) were employed. Effects were regarded as significant 
when zero was not included in the confidence interval. For the analysis 
of all data, SPSS 29 was used.

3. Results

Correlations between all study variables are shown in Table 1. 
Significant positive correlations were found between flourishing and 
self-love,  r = 0.734,  and  between  flourishing  and  pro-socialness, 
r = 0.227.  Furthermore,  nature  connectedness  correlated  positively 
with self-love, r = 0.279, and with pro-socialness, r = 0.352. Contrary 
to  hypothesis  1,  no  significant  correlations  were  found  between 
flourishing  and  nature  connectedness  and  between  self-love  and 
pro-socialness.

For hypothesis 2, a regression analysis with enter method was 
calculated with the criterion flourishing and the predictors self-love, 
pro-socialness,  and  nature  connectedness.  Overall,  the  analysis 
revealed that the model was significant and all predictors explained 
57.5% of the variance of the criterion, F(3, 134) = 60.53, p < 0.001. Self-
love, β = 0.742, p < 0.001, and pro-socialness, β = 0.206, p < 0.001, were 
significant  predictors  of  flourishing  while  nature  connectedness, 
β = −0.075, p = 0.232, was not (Table 2).

Hypothesis 3 was analyzed using Process (Model 4, Hayes, 2018). 
Indirect  effects  with  nature  connectedness  or  pro-socialness  as 
mediators of the relationship between self-love and flourishing were 
not significant (see Supplementary Figure S1). The total, c = 0.734, 
95%CI [0.859, 1.179], and the direct, c’ = 0.742, 95%CI [0.869, 1.191], 
effects of self-love on flourishing, were significant. Overall, the model 
was significant and all variables explained 57.5% of the variance of 
flourishing, R = 0.759, F(3, 134) = 60.534, p < 0.001.

Results  of  the  present  study  showed  significant  associations 
between flourishing and two aspects of connectedness, namely self-
love and pro-socialness. In line with hypothesis 1, we found strong 
correlations  between  self-love  and  flourishing  as  well  as  small 
correlations between pro-socialness and flourishing. Contrary to our 
assumptions, the third aspect of connectedness, nature connectedness, 
was  not  significantly  correlated  to  self-love  (after  Bonferroni 
correction).  Regarding  correlations  between  the  aspects  of 
connectedness, nature connectedness was significantly correlated with 
self-love  and  pro-socialness,  but  self-love  was  not  associated  with 
pro-socialness. Hence, hypothesis 1 was only partly confirmed by the 
results.  Regarding  hypothesis  2,  self-love  and  pro-socialness 
significantly predicted flourishing whereas nature connectedness was 
no significant predictor.

The correlations between self-love and flourishing are in line with 
results  showing  associations  between  self-love  and  well-being 
(Hernandez et al., 2016). Because the correlations in the present study 
were rather strong, it could be assumed that the questionnaires on 
self-love (Henschke and Sedlmeier, n.d.) and flourishing (Diener et al., 
2010) have overlapping aspects. Especially, two items of the flourishing 
scale are “I am engaged and interested in my daily activities” and “I 
am competent and capable in the activities that are important to me” 
which are related to the two items of the self-love questionnaire: “I 
consciously decide with whom I spend my free time,” “I know which 
people and activities are good for me,” and “I do physical activities that 
are  good  for  me.”  Moreover,  there  are  items  in  the  self-love 
questionnaire  (“I  notice  the  signals  of  my  body,”  “I  take  time  for 
myself ”) that are prerequisites for the statements in the flourishing 
scale (“I am a good person and live a good live”). Apart from that there 
are statements in the flourishing scale regarding people’s social life 
(“My  social  relationships  are  supportive  and  rewarding,”  “People 
respect me,” “I actively contribute to the happiness and well-being of 
others”) and their future (“I am optimistic about my future”) that have 
no  corresponding  statements  in  the  self-love  questionnaire.  In 
conclusion, the strong correlation between self-love and flourishing 
could result from overlapping parts of the questionnaires and because 
aspects  of  self-love  seem  to  be  important  to  social-psychological 
prosperity or flourishing (Diener et al., 2010).

Pro-socialness was a positive predictor of flourishing. That result 
is in line with previous studies showing that prosocial behavior is 
connected to vitality or positive affect (Martela and Ryan, 2016) and 
that altruism is also associated with connectedness to life satisfaction 
(Becchetti et al., 2017). Moreover, the autonomous motive to help 
other people is associated with subjective well-being (Weinstein and 
Ryan, 2010).

Contrary  to  our  hypothesis,  nature  connectedness  was  not 
significantly  correlated  to  flourishing.  Other  studies  and  meta-
analyses found small significant correlations between connectedness 
to  nature  and  different  aspects  of  well-being  that  ranged  between 
0.17 < r < 0.30 (Nisbet and Zelenski, 2013; Pritchard et al., 2020). In the 
present study, the correlation of nature connectedness and flourishing 
was within this range, too, but failed to reach significance. Another 
explanation for only small non-significant correlations could be that 
people with a higher nature connectedness worry more about the 
threat to the environment and their own future. Nisbet and Zelenski 
(2013) showed that nature connectedness was strongly associated with

biospheric environmental concerns. More worry or concern could 
then be related to less flourishing. In the regression analysis, nature 
connectedness was no significant predictor of flourishing. That result 
could  be  because  nature  connectedness  had  small  to  medium 
relationships  to  self-love  (Nisbet  and  Zelenski,  2013)  and 
pro-socialness (Pirchio et al., 2021) and these factors were stronger 
predictors of flourishing than nature connectedness. Hence, besides 
self-love and pro-socialness, nature connectedness cannot explain the 
variance of flourishing incrementally.

Also contrary to our hypothesis, self-love was not associated with 
pro-socialness.  Because  self-love  is  a  rather  new  empirically 
investigated concept, other studies examining self-love and prosocial 
behavior  are  rare.  One  study  (Corral-Verdugo  et  al.,  2021)  found 
positive associations between altruistic behavior and self-care. Besides 
differences in the constructs of altruistic behavior vs. pro-socialness 
and self-love vs. self-care, Corral-Verdugo et al’s (2021) sample were 
Mexican adults from low, middle, and high socioeconomic strata. Our 
sample  was  approx.  15 years  younger,  from  Germany,  and  highly 
educated (95% had at least 13 years of schooling).

The results of our study contribute to the existing literature on the 
associations between connectedness and flourishing. Self-love as a 
rather new construct was a strong predictor of people’s flourishing. 
This could be considered in interventions to enhance flourishing in 
healthy adults. Moreover, the correlation between pro-socialness and 
flourishing clarifies that it could be beneficial to encourage people to 
help others and engage themselves in prosocial activities. The small 
non-significant  correlations  between  nature  connectedness  and 
flourishing should be analyzed in more detail in intervention studies. 
When  higher  concerns  and  worries  in  people  with  high  nature 
connectedness  are  a  reason  for  non-significant  correlations,  more 
nature contact could enhance people’s flourishing independent of their 
concerns. A mindfulness intervention could even reduce these worries 
(Delgado  et  al.,  2010)  to  enhance  the  effect  of  a  nature 
contact intervention.

This biased sample is a limitation of our study. Another limitation is 
that  the  questionnaires  on  self-love  and  flourishing  could  have 
overlapping items. Future research could use another measurement of 
flourishing that distinguishes for example the six different concepts of 
flourishing (Lee et al., 2020). Furthermore, other aspects of well-being, 
e.g.,  subjective  well-being  or  life  satisfaction,  and  other  aspects  of 
connectedness,  e.g.,  connectedness  to  the  transcendent  could 
be examined. Besides this, the sample should be more diverse including, 
adolescents, older people, and less educated participants in the sample.

To conclude, self-love and pro-socialness had the strongest effect 
on people’s flourishing. For possible intervention programs to enhance 
flourishing in young adults, these two aspects of connectedness should 
be in the focus.
