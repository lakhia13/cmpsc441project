Abstract
Objective: Although Indigenous women are exposed to high rates of risk factors for perinatal mental health problems, the
magnitude of their risk is not known. This lack of data impedes the development of appropriate screening and treatment
protocols, as well as the proper allocation of resources for Indigenous women. The objective of this systematic review and
meta-analysis was to compare rates of perinatal mental health problems among Indigenous and non-Indigenous women.

Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science from their inceptions until February
2019. Studies were included if they assessed mental health in Indigenous women during pregnancy and/or up to 12 months
postpartum.

Results: Twenty-six articles met study inclusion criteria and 21 were eligible for meta-analysis. Indigenous identity was
associated with higher odds of mental health problems (odds ratio [OR] 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 2.11). Odds
were higher still when analyses were restricted to problems of greater severity (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.16) and young
Indigenous women (OR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.28).
Conclusion: Indigenous women are at increased risk of mental health problems during the perinatal period, particularly
depression, anxiety, and substance misuse. However, resiliency among Indigenous women, cultural teachings, and metho-
dological issues may be affecting estimates. Future research should utilize more representative samples, adapt and validate
diagnostic and symptom measures for Indigenous groups, and engage Indigenous actors, leaders, and related allies to help
improve the accuracy of estimates, as well as the well-being of Indigenous mothers, their families, and future generations.

Introduction

Up to 20% of women experience problems with their mental
health during the perinatal period,1 with adverse effects for
the mother, her family, and the health-care system.2-4 A past
history of mental illness,5 poor social support,6 poverty,7
intimate partner violence,8 childhood sexual abuse,9 and
other forms of trauma all increase risk.

One group that experiences very high rates of these and
other risk factors are Indigenous women. Despite this, very
little is known about their mental health during the perinatal
period.10 Indigenous populations are the original inhabitants
of ancestral land prior to the establishment of borders with
cultural identities distinct from the dominant society’s.11
However, because of colonization and assimilation efforts,
they now live with structural risks that have contributed to
poorer health outcomes than their non-Indigenous
counterparts.12

Although not all Indigenous women develop perinatal
mental health problems, it is important to understand the
mental health problems experienced by Indigenous women
around the world so that those who may be suffering can be
helped and the intergenerational transmission of risk to their
children can be reduced. Resilience processes can also be
examined in Indigenous women and their children who are
thriving, so protective factors against the development of
mental health problems can be elucidated. By understanding
the scope of the problem facing Indigenous women and their
families, we will then be able to better prioritize and study
the relevant risk and resilience mechanisms through which
perinatal mental health problems may be transmitted.
Synthesizing the literature on Indigenous perinatal mental
health should ultimately lead to the development of early

screening, identification, and treatment protocols and help
guide the development of policies to help future generations.
Bowen and colleagues conducted a systematic search and
narrative summary of the literature (up to 2010) on the peri-
natal mental health of Indigenous women, identifying 16
quantitative articles.13 Thirteen measured perinatal depres-
sion and reported antenatal prevalence rates from 17% to
47%. Although this review advanced our understanding of
perinatal depression among Indigenous women, a number of
gaps remain. Point estimates of absolute and relative risks
are not yet known, and some of the studies that provided
prevalence data were designed to validate questionnaires
rather than estimate these rates, potentially introducing sam-
pling bias.

It is also not known how country of residence, severity of
illness, or other factors affect the risk of developing psycho-
pathology among Indigenous perinatal women. It is impor-
tant to know which mental health problems Indigenous
women are most vulnerable to, so that appropriate screening
and intervention protocols can be developed and applied
(e.g., pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments,
public health policies, etc.). Screening and intervention can
allow for earlier detection and potentially the prevention of
intergenerational transmission of psychopathology to help
reduce the burden on the mother, her family, and the
health-care system. Finally, little data exist on outcomes
other than depression although problems like perinatal sub-
stance misuse and anxiety are significant risk factors.14,15

Since the review of Bowen and colleagues synthesized
data published nearly a decade ago, accompanied with the
increasing appreciation of the importance of the health and
well-being of Indigenous peoples and the impact perinatal
mental health problems can have on future generations, it is

important to have a comprehensive and contemporary under-
standing of the prevalence and relative risk of these difficul-
ties among Indigenous women.16,17 The objective of this
systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine rates
of perinatal mental health problems among Indigenous
women from the first trimester of pregnancy up to 12 months
postpartum and compare them to non-Indigenous women.

health outcomes that had a nonorganic cause and were
indexed under “mental health disorders” on the databases
(“mental disease” for Embase) were included. For an
exhaustive list, please see the Supplemental Material data.
All efforts were made to find the English translation of non-
English articles.

Methods
Search Strategy

The study protocol guiding this systematic review and meta-
analysis was published in the PROSPERO database on Octo-
ber 11, 2018 (CRD42018108638). The guidelines and
checklists from the preferred reporting items for systematic
reviews (PRISMA) and meta-analyses and meta-analysis of
observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) were fol-
lowed.18,19 Indigenous collaborators of Mohawk (AJ), Red
River Me´tis (CG), and Oji/Cree (BD) heritage were con-
sulted to help create search strategies, plan the subgroup and
sensitivity analyses, analyze and interpret the data, and
review the final draft of the manuscript.

A systematic search of electronic databases (Medline,
EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science) was
conducted from their inceptions until February 25, 2019.
Search strategies/terms were developed in collaboration with
a health sciences librarian and clinicians/researchers of
Mohawk, Red River Me´tis, and Oji/Cree heritage to ensure
terms were specific and inclusive (please see Supplemental
Material data). In general, searches were centered on three
Medical Subject Heading terms: Indigenous populations,
pregnancy or postpartum period, and mental disorders.
Despite terms to describe Indigenous populations being
changed over time, we elected to generate all possible terms
in order to best capture all potential articles related to peri-
natal Indigenous mental health. The ancestry approach was
also used, where the reference lists of relevant articles were
hand-searched to identify additional studies.

Eligibility Criteria

Observational (cross-sectional, case–control, cohort) studies
were included if (1) participants were Indigenous women (as
defined by World Health Organization20 or other valid cri-
teria [i.e., self-identification]21), (2) participants were
assessed anywhere from the start of pregnancy to 12 months
postpartum, (3) mental health outcomes were assessed, (4)
studies used diagnostic interviews or self-report question-
naires to measure mental health outcomes, and (5) outcomes
were reported separately for Indigenous and non-Indigenous
women. Although diagnostic manuals have defined the peri-
natal period to last from the first trimester of pregnancy until
4 weeks postpartum, we elected to extend this time period up
to 12 months postpartum to align with clinical practice of
diagnosing women with mental health problems if they
experience them within a year of delivery.22 All mental

Data Extraction and Methodological Bias
Assessment of Studies

Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent
reviewers (MF and SO) and any disagreements were adjudi-
cated by a third reviewer (RV). Data were extracted using a
standardized form which was pilot-tested with five randomly
selected studies to ensure adequate data capture. Information
regarding study location was extracted, as were study design,
sample size and type, participant inclusion/exclusion cri-
teria, mental health outcomes assessed, measures and clin-
ical cutoffs used, timing of outcome assessment, and
prevalence rates.

The methodological bias of eligible studies was assessed
using The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and
case–control studies.23 Selection, comparability, and out-
come bias were graded using this measure’s star system,
where the greater the number of stars represented higher
methodological quality and lower risk of bias. Publication
bias was assessed using funnel plots generated through Rev-
Man 5.3 and the Egger test.

Statistical Analyses

A random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Odds ratios
(ORs) were expressed with 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs). Cochrane Q test was performed to assess for statistical
heterogeneity, and Higgins I2 statistic was used to deter-
mine the extent of variation between effect estimates (0%
to 100%).

In accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane
Handbook, when needed, study groups were combined so
that only two distinct groups (Indigenous and non-Indigen-
ous) were present.24 It is important to note that Indigenous
groups within and outside country borders have unique cul-
tural histories, social structures, and lived experiences. Com-
bining these heterogenous groups into a single group could
mask any differential effects between and within Indigenous
groups. However, we elected to study Indigenous women as
a whole as it increased statistical power and since there was
limited information on certain Indigenous groups within the
searched databases (e.g., Me´tis women).

Our primary analysis meta-analyzed all eligible studies.
Planned subgroup analyses were then conducted to examine
the influence of a specific type of mental health problem
(e.g., depression, anxiety), reproductive stage (pregnancy,
postpartum), and country of residence. Sensitivity analyses
were also conducted to assess the impact of risk of bias
(excluding studies with a score (cid:2) 4 on the NOS). Research

has also shown that young maternal age is a risk factor for the
development or recurrence of perinatal mental health prob-
lems.25,26 Since Indigenous mothers tend to be younger than
their non-Indigenous counterparts,27 we conducted a sensitiv-
ity analysis that only included studies reporting that Indigen-
ous participants were younger than their non-Indigenous
counterparts. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to
determine how different clinical cutoffs defining illness sever-
ity affected prevalence rates since different ethnicities may
have different thresholds for presenting symptoms of mental
health problems.28 RevMan 5.3 and R 3.4.2 Software (R
Development Core Team) were used to complete statistical
analyses.

Search Results

Our search identified 4,583 potentially relevant articles, and
3,941 underwent title and abstract screening (after removal
of duplicate citations). We identified 41 articles for full-text
review and found 23 that met our inclusion criteria. Three
additional articles were identified via the ancestry approach.
Inter-rater agreement was high (Cohen k ¼ 0.86).

Of these 26 studies, 21 were eligible for meta-analysis
(see Figure 1). Tables 1a, b, and c, outline the characteristics
of studies during antenatal, postnatal, and combined antena-
tal/postnatal periods, respectively.

Characteristics of Included Studies

Participant characteristics. A total of 444,672 perinatal women
were included across the 26 studies, with 39,734 women
identifying as Indigenous and 404,938 as non-Indigenous.

Study characteristics. Studies were conducted in the United
States (n ¼ 12), Australia (n ¼ 6), New Zealand (n ¼ 4),
Canada (n ¼ 3), and Taiwan (n ¼ 1). Twelve studies sampled
women during pregnancy, 12 during the postpartum period,
and two during pregnancy and the puerperium.

Some studies assessed more than one outcome in their
sample.29-32 Twenty-one studies assessed depression with
nine using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
(EPDS),29,33-40 five using the Center for Epidemiological
Studies–Depression (CES-D),30,31,41-43 two using the Patient
Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2),44,45 two using a unique
depression screening instrument designed for that study,46,47
and one study each using the PHQ-15,32 Postpartum Depres-
sion Screening Scale,48 and Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI).49 Six studies measured alcohol and drug use, with
two studies using diagnostic interviews,50,51 two using the
Tolerance, Worry, Eye-Opener, Amnesia, & Cut-Down
Drinking Questionnaire,30,31 and two relied on self-reports
of use.33,39 Four studies measured anxiety with two using the
EPDS Anxiety subscale,29,52 while two utilized the State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) State subscale.30,31 Four
studies assessed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with
two studies using both the Traumatic Life Events and PTSD

Checklist–Civilian Version,31,53 one using the Primary Care
PTSD Screen,41 and one the Impact of Events–Revised
Scale.54 Finally, one study measured panic disorder using
the PHQ-15 Panic module.32

The studies that were not eligible for meta-analysis either
had no comparison group33,35,41,54 or reported only contin-
uous outcomes.52 We completed a narrative synthesis of the
results of these studies.

Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

Of 26 studies, 16 were rated as having a high risk of bias
(score (cid:2) 4 on the NOS—please see Table S1 in Supplemen-
tal Material data). This was most frequently due to sample
selection bias (i.e., ascertainment of exposure) and outcome
measurement bias.

Publication Bias

The symmetrical pattern of the funnel plot formed around
the OR of 1.7 is not suggestive of publication bias (see
Figure 2). Further, formal statistical tests (i.e., Egger test)
suggest that symmetry exists in the funnel plot (P ¼ 0.79)
and also supports an absence of publication bias.

Primary Analysis

When all types of mental health problems were considered,
Indigenous identity was associated with 62% higher odds of
experiencing such a problem than non-Indigenous women
(OR 1.62; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.11; see Figure 3).

Subgroup Analyses

Type of mental health problem. Drug or alcohol use problems
had the highest OR of all problems (OR 3.30; 95% CI, 2.02 to
5.40; Figure 3), followed by depression (OR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.15
to 1.65) and anxiety (OR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.80). ORs for
PTSD were not higher in Indigenous than non-Indigenous
women but were based on just two studies. Indigenous women
were less likely to have panic disorder (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.09
to 0.97), although this is only based on a single study.

Reproductive stage. Indigenous women were found to be at
elevated risk of developing mental health problems during
pregnancy (OR 1.79; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.59) and the postpar-
tum period (OR 1.34; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.60).

Country of study. In every country (Canada, United States,
New Zealand, Australia, and Taiwan), Indigenous women
manifested increased odds of any mental health problem
relative to non-Indigenous women.

Sensitivity Analyses

Methodological risk of bias. Including only studies with a low
risk of bias produced a comparable effect estimate (OR 1.59;

increased to 1.86 (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.28).

Antenatal PTSD. Mah and colleagues conducted a cross-
sectional study with 147 antenatal women from Australia
identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and
reported antenatal PTSD prevalence rates of 10.2% using
the Impact of Events Scale–Revised.54 Dodgson et al.
(2014) found antenatal PTSD prevalence rates at 37.7%
using the Primary Care PTSD Screen.41 In the general peri-
natal population, antenatal PTSD rates are 3.3%.56

Postnatal depression. Hayes et al. (2010) reported that 14% of
their sample expressed postnatal depressive symptoms, as
assessed by an EPDS score (cid:3) 13.33

Overall, rates for depression and PTSD were similar to
ones reported in the meta-analysis while anxiety rates were
higher in the meta-analyzed studies, and drug/alcohol use
rates were lower in studies contained in our meta-analysis.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that
Indigenous women are at increased risk of mental health
problems across the perinatal period, particularly depres-
sion, anxiety, and substance misuse. When analyses are
limited to higher levels of symptoms and younger Indi-
genous perinatal women, odds in Indigenous women are
higher still.

These findings are consistent with a recent Canadian
study (that was not eligible for this review) that showed
that postpartum depression rates were higher in First
Nations (12.9%), Inuit (10.6%), and Me´tis (9.1%) women
compared to their non-Indigenous peers (5.6%).57 Using
the same data, another group reported that Indigenous
women were twice as likely to have postpartum depression
compared to their non-Indigenous peers (OR 2.11; 95% CI,
1.44 to 3.09).58

However, previous meta-analyses on the mental health of
Indigenous males and females of a wide range of ages living
in the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand suggested that
the prevalence of mental health problems is generally not
increased relative to non-Indigenous groups, and in some
cases, may even be lower.59,60 These findings have been
hypothesized to be due to the resiliency and cultural teach-
ings of Indigenous peoples. Despite colonization and its
ongoing effects, assimilation efforts, and current systematic
racism hindering their quality of life, Indigenous peoples
across the globe have shown profound resilience, particu-
larly because of connectedness to traditional land and cul-
ture.59,61 In fact, studies have shown that the more involved a
community is with their culture (e.g., cultural facilities, self-
governance), the lower the suicide rate in that community.62
Indigenous peoples have faced unique social origins of
mental health problems including a collective history of
forced displacement, colonization, and dissolution of tradi-
tional family units (e.g., Indian Residential Schools, Sixties
Scoop, Stolen Generation), combined with present-day sys-
tematic oppression, racism, forced evacuation birthing for

problem (i.e., at risk/mild, moderate, severe; Figure 4). The
odds of mild perinatal mental health problems among Indi-
genous women were not increased (OR 1.78; 95% CI, 0.31 to
1.97), nor were they when studies examined problems of
moderate severity (OR 1.58; 95% CI, 0.77 to 3.26). How-
ever, Indigenous women were nearly twice as likely to man-
ifest a severe mental health problem (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.21
to 3.16).

Narrative Synthesis

Antenatal drug or alcohol use. Hayes et al. (2010) found that
15.0% and 18.5% of Indigenous women self-reported any
drug and alcohol use, respectively, during pregnancy.33 For
context, antenatal drug and alcohol use among the general
pregnant population ranges from 3.7% to 4.3% and 5.4% to
11.6%, respectively.55

Antenatal depression. Three of the five studies not eligible for
meta-analysis reported data on prevalence rates of antenatal
depression among Indigenous women from the United
States41 and Australia.33,35 Hayes et al followed a group of
92 women who identified as Torres Strait Islanders and
found that 37.8% of these women reported antenatal depres-
sion using the EPDS.33 Dodgson et al. (2014) examined
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women with and without
antenatal PTSD and found antenatal depression prevalence
rates of 31.7% among all women using the CES-D.41 Finally,
Buist and Bilszta (2005) conducted a cross-sectional study
with 611 antenatal women identifying as Aboriginal Strait
Islanders and found that 19% of them endorsed symptoms of
antenatal depression through the EPDS.35

Antenatal anxiety. Bowen et al. (2008) conducted a prospec-
tive cohort study with 389 pregnant women from Canada
(255 identifying as Aboriginal) and found no significant
differences in antenatal anxiety between the two groups
using the EPDS Anxiety subscale.52

Indigenous women living in remote and Northern areas of
Canada, and high rates of intimate partner violence (up to 45
times more than their non-Indigenous counterparts).63-65
Given these numerous structural disadvantages, it may be
surprising that our reported rates of mental health problems
are not higher.

The reasons for discrepancies between what might be
expected based on high rates of exposure to adversities
and reported risks of mental health problems are not well

understood. Of relevance to perinatal psychopathology, in
some Indigenous spiritualities, pregnancy is viewed as a
sacred journey and gift from the Creator.66 During this
time, women are taught to honor their traditional teach-
ings and immerse themselves in positive and good
thoughts as these are a medicine for herself and her
baby.67 Therefore, perinatal Indigenous women may
receive a greater level of support from their communities
during this time which may, in part, protect against the

development or recurrence of perinatal mental health
problems.

Certainly, this review suggests that Indigenous women
are at increased risk of psychopathology in the perinatal
period. However, subgroup and sensitivity analyses suggest
that rates may actually be even higher. Our sensitivity anal-
ysis showed that the odds were even higher in young Indi-
genous mothers (OR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.28) relative to
when all Indigenous women were included (OR 1.62; 95%
CI, 1.25 to 2.11). Regardless, methodological limitations
present in many extant studies particularly limitations in
sampling, measurement, and Indigenous engagement may
affect the size of detected effects.

Indeed, 18 of the 26 studies eligible for this review
employed convenience sampling to recruit participants and
most studies were small and enrolled participants mainly
recruited from tertiary care centers, potentially limiting the
representativeness of their samples. A number of other stud-
ies specifically recruited women who were socioeconomi-
cally disadvantaged as control participants, potentially
leading to overestimates of mental health problems in non-
Indigenous comparison groups.39,40,48,52

Limitations in existing measures, particularly their lack of
cultural validity, could also affect effect estimates. Of the 26

studies, 24 reviewed used self-report measures, mainly ques-
tionnaires that have not been validated in Indigenous women
(i.e., BDI, STAI, CES-D, or PHQ). The expression of poor
mental health can vary from culture to culture. For instance,
research has shown that some Indigenous groups may
express depression as anger or somatic symptoms.68 Using
measurements normed primarily in Caucasian groups runs
the risk of underestimating the prevalence of perinatal men-
tal health problems in Indigenous women. Further, the scales
used in the studies have not been formally validated in Indi-
genous teenagers despite research showing that Indigenous
mothers tend to be younger and more likely to be teen-
agers.27 To our knowledge, there are no validation studies
for these scales (e.g., BDI, CES-D, EPDS, PHQ, STAI) con-
ducted exclusively in Indigenous teenagers. This further lim-
its our interpretation of the data, as symptom expression and
illness severity may be different in teenagers compared to
their older counterparts. Even questionnaires that have been
previously validated may have limitations as these validation
studies were completed using small samples and showed
only poor predictive validity for mental health problems in
Indigenous women.69-72 Just two studies in this meta-
analysis utilized structured diagnostic interviews, the gold
standard for assessing psychiatric disorders. Consistent with

160

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 65(3)

our subgroup analyses relating to disorder severity, the two
studies that utilized structured diagnostic interviews reported
some of the highest ORs seen in this review (removing these
two studies from the meta-analysis reduces the magnitude of
our overall effect estimate from 1.62 [95% CI, 1.25 to 2.11]
to 1.41 [95% CI, 1.20 to 1.66]). These findings suggest that
mental health problems endorsed by Indigenous women may
be better detected through clinical interviews and question-
naires that have been culturally validated and adapted.73,74
Although no structured diagnostic interview (i.e., The Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Structured Clini-
cal Interview for DSM Disorders) has specifically been vali-
dated in Indigenous populations, studies have highlighted
the cultural acceptability with these structured73 or semi-
structured interviews.74

A lack of Indigenous consultation and collaboration in
included studies is another factor that could affect the size
of effect estimates. Indeed, only 5 of the 26 studies employed
Indigenous research methodologies29,33 or had Indigenous
research team members that interacted with partici-
pants.36,42,54 Working with Indigenous researchers, clini-
cians, actors, and leaders would promote the inclusion of
appropriate measurements, outcomes, and methodological
design in such studies. For example, while no studies spe-
cifically examined Inuit women, it is well-known that preg-
nant women living in Northern and remote locations in
Canada must be evacuated (by themselves) to a larger city
in order to deliver their baby.75 Research has elucidated the
isolation, depression, and loss of control that these new
mothers face without their family and friends nearby.75 Such
negative birthing experiences certainly contribute to poor
maternal mental health, yet were not highlighted in any of
the studies in our review. Actively seeking and involving
Inuit actors and leaders from study inception may circum-
vent such methodological problems in future research. Fur-
ther, given past medical research atrocities involving
Indigenous groups, participants may not have been as open
or trusting of non-Indigenous researchers which may have
led to decreased reporting of problems overall (including
those relating to mental health). Relatedly, Indigenous
women who have greater trust in Western settler researchers
may have been more likely to participate and been healthier,
which contributed to underestimates in prevalence rates.76,77

Future Directions

To develop accurate estimates of Indigenous perinatal men-
tal health problems, future research should aim to address
methodological issues surrounding sampling, measurement,
and Indigenous inclusion, as described earlier. Such research
will help optimize screening processes, the proper allocation
of resources, and elucidate the risk and resilience processes
in Indigenous perinatal women and their families.

First, studies must aim to recruit representative samples.
While convenience sampling is simpler, it can introduce
biases that can lead to inaccurate estimates. The use of

weighted samples can ensure that typically underrepresented
populations (e.g., Me´tis women, women living on-reserve/
reservation) are appropriately represented. In Canada, most
of the research in the field has focused on First Nations and
Inuit, or generically, in Indigenous peoples compared to their
non-Indigenous counterparts. There is also a need for disag-
gregated data when studying Indigenous populations, some-
thing that has been called a topic of primary importance by
the United Nations Permanent Forum.21 Disaggregated data,
which break down data into its component parts (e.g., sex,
race, geographical district), are often lacking or even non-
existent in Indigenous research, yet it can increase the utility
and employment of data collection in different communities
which are governed by different jurisdictions, health-care
systems, and cultures.21

Second, we propose that structured diagnostic interviews
be adapted and validated to be culturally relevant and safe
for Indigenous women to assess psychiatric problems. Cul-
tural adaptation can include (a) capturing problems which
may be specific to Indigenous peoples (i.e., wounded spirit),
(b) asking about symptoms that may be endorsed differently
(e.g., depression endorsed as anger), (c) understanding the
social origins of mental health (e.g., forced geographic dis-
placement, colonization, dissolution of traditional family
units), or (d) employing methods guided by Indigenous
knowledge, such as storytelling in clinical interviews.76,78
Given that the administration of diagnostic interviews comes
with many barriers (i.e., must be done by a trained and
qualified professional, time-consuming, often conducted
in-person), questionnaires must concurrently be adapted and
validated so that accurate prevalence rates can be estimated
in an efficient, barrier-free manner.

Third, Indigenous researchers, collaborators, commu-
nities, and related allies need to be involved in all stages
of projects examining perinatal mental health problems in
Indigenous women. Research groups working with First
Nations should employ research standards that adhere to the
ownership, control, access, and possession (OCAP) princi-
ple, which provide First Nations with OCAP of the data
being collected.79 Employing the “nothing about us without
us” principle will provide these communities with the
empowerment, capacity, and resources to make changes that
can benefit their own community members and future
generations.21,80

Limitations

In addition to limitations in sampling, measurement, and
Indigenous inclusion, limitations of studies included in the
review warrant mention. First, over half (16/26) were
assessed to have a high risk of methodological bias. Second,
none of the studies sampled women living on-reserve/reser-
vation, which limits our full understanding of the prevalence
of perinatal mental health problems among Indigenous
women. Third, some studies had a small sample of Indigen-
ous women and thus were not adequately powered to detect

La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie 65(3)

161

differences in their primary outcome. Fourth, gray literature
was not searched. Finally, we were not able to report
adjusted ORs as 15 of the included studies failed to adjust
for risk factors between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
women.

Conclusion

The present review suggests that Indigenous identity
increases the risk of developing a perinatal mental health
problem by 62%. In order to most accurately detect and treat
perinatal mental health problems in Indigenous women,
future studies must utilize representative samples, adapt and
validate assessment methods to establish cultural equiva-
lency, and engage Indigenous communities and allies under
the OCAP research standard to reduce the impact of mental
health problems on women, their children, and future
generations.
