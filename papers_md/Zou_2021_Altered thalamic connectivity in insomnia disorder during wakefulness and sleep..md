Abstract

Insomnia disorder is the most common sleep disorder and has drawn increasing atten-

tion. Many studies have shown that hyperarousal plays a key role in the pathophysi-

ology of insomnia disorder. However, the specific brain mechanisms underlying

insomnia disorder remain unclear. To elucidate the neuropathophysiology of insomnia

disorder, we investigated the brain functional networks of patients with insomnia dis-
order and healthy controls across the sleep–wake cycle. EEG-fMRI data from

33 patients with insomnia disorder and 31 well-matched healthy controls during

wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement sleep, including N1, N2 and N3 stages,

were analyzed. A medial and anterior thalamic region was selected as the seed con-
sidering its role in sleep–wake regulation. The functional connectivity between the

thalamic seed and voxels across the brain was calculated. ANOVA with factors
“group” and “stage” was performed on thalamus-based functional connectivity. Corre-

lations between the misperception index and altered functional connectivity were

explored. A group-by-stage interaction was observed at widespread cortical regions.

Regarding the main effect of group, patients with insomnia disorder demonstrated

decreased thalamic connectivity with the left amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, puta-

men, pallidum and hippocampus across wakefulness and all three nonrapid eye move-

ment sleep stages. The thalamic connectivity in the subcortical cluster and the right

| DI SCU SSION

Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI, this study identified the thalamus-

based brain functional networks across wakefulness and all NREM

stages in patients with insomnia disorder. With this advantage, we

illustrated altered thalamus-based connectivity in patients with insom-

nia disorder. Importantly, this study demonstrated that thalamic-limbic

and thalamic-temporal connectivities are significantly correlated with

sleep misperception derived from PSG data, providing possible expla-

nations for the formation of sleep misperception.

The altered connectivity between the thalamus and cortical

regions in patients with insomnia disorder provided possible brain func-

tional network evidence for the hyperarousal hypothesis. Patients with

insomnia disorder showed a more positive thalamocortical connectivity

than the healthy controls during wakefulness. It was found that greater

sleepiness was associated with lower or more negative thalamocortical

connectivity (Killgore et al., 2015). The more positive thalamocortical

connectivity indicated a more vigilant state of the brain of patients with

insomnia disorder during night-time wakefulness. After falling asleep,

the thalamocortical connectivity for the patients with insomnia disor-

der was lower (more negative) than that of the healthy controls. We

previously found activation in the thalamus and deactivation in the

temporal, occipital and frontal gyri during spontaneous arousals in

NREM sleep (Zou et al., 2020). In addition, activation in the thalamus

and deactivation in cortical regions have been found in studies using

auditory and median-nerve stimuli during sleep (Czisch et al., 2004; Del

Felice, Formaggio, Storti, Fiaschi, & Manganotti, 2012). Taken together,

the evidence suggests that the anticorrelation between the thalamus

and certain cortical regions during sleep is related to arousal level. This
