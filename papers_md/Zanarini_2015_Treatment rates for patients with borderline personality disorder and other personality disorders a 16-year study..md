Abstract

Objective—The goal of this study was to delineate the course of 16 treatment modalities 
reported by 290 patients with borderline personality disorder and 72 with other axis II disorders 
over 16 years of prospective follow-up.

Methods—Treatment use was assessed at baseline and at eight two-year follow-up periods using 
a semistructured interview of proven reliability and validity.

Results—Patients with borderline personality disorder reported significantly higher rates of use 
of 12 of the 16 treatment modalities studied. Only individual therapy, intensive individual therapy, 
couples/family therapy, and ECT were used by roughly the same percentage of patients with 
borderline personality disorder and those with other axis II disorders. In addition, rates of 
participation in 13 treatment modalities declined significantly over the first eight years of follow-
up for those in both treatment groups. However, the rates of participation in 15 of 16 treatment 
modalities did not decline significantly over the second eight years of follow-up for those in either 
study group

Conclusions—The results of this study suggest that rates of treatment use by patients with 
borderline personality disorder decline significantly over the short and midterm. They also suggest 
that these rates remain stable or fail to decline further over the longer term.

Clinical experience suggests that patients with borderline personality disorder are more 
likely to have a history of both outpatient and inpatient psychiatric treatment than patients 
with other psychiatric diagnoses. Five cross-sectional studies have confirmed this 
impression (1-5). Two of these studies have also followed their sample of borderline patients 
and comparison participants longitudinally. In a three-year prospective study from the 
Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study, Bender et al. (6) found that patients 
with borderline personality disorder were significantly more likely than those with major 
depression and no serious axis II psychopathology to have been in individual therapy, taken 
psychotropic medication, had an emergency room visit, and been hospitalized for psychiatric 
reasons. In a six-year prospective study, Zanarini et al. (7) found that borderline patients 
who had been hospitalized at the start of this study—the McLean Study of Adult 
Development—were significantly more likely than those with other axis II disorders to have

participated in 11 of the 16 treatment modalities studied. These investigators also found that 
participation in 12 of the 16 treatment modalities studied declined significantly over time for 
those in both study groups.

Treatment utilization of this sample was also studied after 10 years of prospective follow-up 
(8). Only three modalities were studied: individual therapy, standing medication, and 
psychiatric hospitalization. It was found that over 40% of patients with borderline 
personality disorder did not use individual therapy or standing medications for at least one 
two-year follow-up period. However, over 60% of these patients resumed these treatments at 
a later time period. It was also found that over 80% of patients with borderline personality 
disorder were not rehospitalized during at least one two-year follow-up period. However, 
almost half of these patients were later hospitalized for psychiatric reasons.

The current study builds upon these earlier McLean Study of Adult Development studies in 
three important ways. First, it returns to the inclusive list of treatment modalities assessed in 
the first of these two longitudinal studies. Second, it adds an additional decade of 
prospective follow-up to the study of this inclusive list of 16 treatment modalities. Third, it 
assesses time trends encompassing the first and second eight years of follow-up separately—
allowing us to determine the significance of short and midterm declines in use vs. further 
long-term declines in participation in the 16 treatment modalities studied.

As noted above, the current study is part of the McLean Study of Adult Development, a 
multifaceted longitudinal study of the course of borderline personality disorder. The 
methodology of this study, which was reviewed and approved by the McLean Hospital 
Institutional Review Board, has been described in detail elsewhere (9). Briefly, all subjects 
were initially inpatients at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. Each patient was 
screened to determine that he or she: was between the ages of 18-35; had a known or 
estimated IQ of 71 or higher; had no history or current symptomatology of schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I disorder, or an organic condition that could cause serious 
psychiatric symptoms (e.g., lupus, MS); and was fluent in English.

After the study procedures were explained, written informed consent was obtained. Each 
patient then met with a masters-level interviewer blind to the patient’s clinical diagnoses for 
a thorough treatment history as well as diagnostic assessment. Four semistructured 
interviews were administered: the Background Information Schedule, which assesses 
lifetime psychiatric treatment history (5); the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R 
Axis I Disorders (10); the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (11), and the 
Diagnostic Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders (12). The interrater reliability of 
the Background Information Schedule was carefully assessed in a sample of 45 personality-
disordered patients and was found to be good-excellent (5). As a measure of validity, we 
compared self-report of treatment history according to this interview with the medical 
records of 15 patients who had received all of their psychiatric care at McLean Hospital. 
Convergent validity was also found to be good-excellent (5). In addition, the inter-rater and

test-retest reliability of all three diagnostic measures have been found to be good-excellent 
(13,14).

The psychiatric treatments used by study participants over the years of follow-up were 
assessed using the treatment section of the Revised Borderline Follow-up Interview (15)—
the follow-up analog to the Background Information Schedule. This measure, as well as our 
diagnostic battery, was readministered every two years over 16 years of prospective follow-
up by raters blind to previously collected information. The follow-up interrater reliability 
(within one generation of follow-up raters) and follow-up longitudinal reliability (from one 
generation of raters to the next) of these four interviews have also been found to be good-
excellent (7,13,14).

The vast majority of our follow-up interviews were conducted within several months of the 
date of each participant’s last interview. However, two participants who were unavailable 
for interview at 12 and 14-year waves of data collection provided six years of data at 16-
year follow-up. A third participant who was unavailable for interview at 8, 10, 12, and 14-
year waves of data collection provided 10 years of data at 16-year follow-up. All told, eight 
of 2881 interviews (or .3%) assessed a longer time period than our typical two years.

Statistical Analyses

Data on psychiatric treatment were assembled in panel format (i.e., multiple records per 
patient, with one record for each follow-up period for which data were available). 
Generalized estimating equations (GEE), appropriately accounting for repeated measures on 
the same patients, were used to fit loglinear regression models assessing the role of 
diagnostic group on the prevalence of treatment use over time. Specifically, these analyses 
modeled the log prevalence as a piecewise-linear function of time, with separate slopes for 
the change from baseline to 8 year follow-up and for the corresponding change from 8 to 16 
year follow-up; the models also included the effect of diagnostic group. Preliminary tests of 
diagnostic group by time interactions were also conducted to assess whether the pattern of 
change in prevalence differed by diagnostic group. As there was no evidence of interaction, 
main effects of diagnostic group and time are reported; results of these analyses yielded an 
adjusted relative risk ratio (RRR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for diagnostic group 
and the two time trends. Given the large number of comparisons for the 16 treatment 
modalities, we applied the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons to the analysis of 
each treatment modality, resulting in the following corrected alpha level: .0031 (.05/16).

The sample and its diagnostic characteristics have been described before (9). Two hundred 
and ninety patients met both Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-III-R 
criteria for borderline personality disorder and 72 met DSM-III-R criteria for at least one 
nonborderline axis II disorder (and neither criteria set for borderline personality disorder). 
Of these 72 comparison participants, three (4%) met DSM-III-R criteria for an odd cluster 
personality disorder, 24 (33%) met DSM-III-R criteria for an anxious cluster personality 
disorder, 13 (18%) met DSM-III-R criteria for a nonborderline dramatic cluster personality

disorder, and 38 (53%) met DSM-III-R criteria for personality disorder not otherwise 
specified (which was operationally defined in the Revised Diagnostic Interview for 
Personality Disorders as meeting all but one of the required number of criteria for at least 
two of the 13 axis II disorders described in DSM-III-R).

Baseline demographic data have also been reported before (9). Briefly, 279 (77%) of the 
participants were female and 315 (87%) were white. The average age of the participants was 
27 years (SD=6.3), the mean socioeconomic status was 3.3 (SD=1.5) (where 1=highest and 
5=lowest), and their mean GAF score was 39.8 (SD=7.8) (indicating major impairment in 
several areas, such as work or school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood).

In terms of continuing participation, which has also been described before (16), 231/264 
(88%) of surviving patients with borderline personality disorder (13 died by suicide and 13 
died of other causes) were reinterviewed at all eight follow-up waves. A similar rate of 
participation was found for axis II comparison participants, with 58/70 (83%) of surviving 
patients in this study group (one died by suicide and one died of other causes) being 
reassessed at all eight follow-up waves.

Table 1 details the rates of outpatient treatments as well as more intensive treatments, such 
as psychiatric hospitalizations, reported by those in our study groups over 16 years of 
prospective follow-up. As can be seen, patients with borderline personality disorder were 
not significantly more likely to report being in individual therapy, intensive individual 
therapy, or couples/family therapy than those with other axis II disorders. However, they 
were significantly more likely to report being in group therapy and self-help groups. They 
were also significantly more likely to report taking any standing medication, all forms of 
polypharmacy studied (2-5 standing medications), and all forms of more intensive treatment 
studied except ECT (day treatment, residential treatment, psychiatric hospitalizations, 
multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, and hospitalizations lasting 30 days or more). During 
the first 8 years of follow-up (0-8 years), reported rates of all forms of treatment were found 
to decline significantly for those in both study groups except taking four or five or more 
concurrent medications and ECT. Conversely, during the last eight years of follow-up (8-16 
years), reported rates of almost all forms of treatment remained relatively flat or stable over 
time for both study groups; the only exception was the rate of 30 days or more of psychiatric 
hospitalization, which continued to decline significantly for those in both study groups.

As these results are complicated, we present two examples from Table 1 so that they can be 
better understood. As noted above, the rates of reported individual therapy were not 
significantly different between the diagnostic groups over time. However, there was a 
significant decline in the rates during the first eight years of follow-up that was the same for 
those in both study groups; specifically, there was a 29% decline ([1 – .71] × 100%) in the 
rates from baseline to year eight in both groups. Thereafter, during years 8-16, there was no 
significant change in the rates in both groups. As also noted above, patients with borderline 
personality disorder reported significantly higher rates (2.3 times higher) of 30 days or more 
of psychiatric hospitalization than axis II comparison participants over time. However, the 
significant declines in the reported rates were the same for those in both diagnostic groups

Discussion

Three main findings have emerged from this study. The first is that patients with borderline 
personality disorder reported significantly higher rates of use of 12 of the 16 treatment 
modalities studied—all but individual therapy, intensive individual therapy, couples/family 
therapy, and ECT. Or looked at another way, all forms of pharmacotherapy and more 
intensive treatment studied (e.g., psychiatric hospitalizations, day treatment) were reported 
by a significantly higher percentage of patients with borderline personality disorder than 
those with other axis II disorders over time. This finding is consistent with our results at 
study entry (5) and over six years of prospective follow-up (7). It also highlights the 
consistent severity of borderline psychopathology compared to that of other personality 
disorders (17). In addition, it is consistent with the higher rates of co-occurring disorders 
reported by patients with borderline personality disorder than axis II comparison participants 
over time (18,19).

The second main finding is that rates of participation in 13 treatment modalities declined 
significantly over the first eight years of follow-up for those in both treatment groups. Only 
the rates of four or five concurrent medications and ECT remained stable over these eight 
years. This finding too is consistent with the results we found at six-year follow-up (7).

The third main finding is that the rates of participation in 15 of 16 treatment modalities did 
not continue to decline significantly over the second eight years of follow-up for those in 
either study group. Only the rate of hospitalizations of 30 days or more declined 
significantly from 8-16 years of follow-up for those in both study groups. This is a new 
finding and an important one with public health significance. It suggests that the cost of 
treating patients with borderline personality disorder declines in the short and midterms, but 
is relatively stable in the longer term. For example, 97%reported participating in individual 
therapy at study entry and this rate declined significantly to 73% at eight-year follow-up. 
However, this 73% only declined to 65% at 16-year follow-up. This same pattern was also 
found, for another example, with any standing medication. More specifically, 84% of 
patients with borderline personality disorder reporting taking a standing medication at study 
entry and this rate declined significantly to 71% over the first eight years of follow-up. 
However, this rate remained a steady 71% over the second eight years of follow-up. As a 
third example, 79% of patients with borderline personality disorder had a history of prior 
hospitalizations at baseline and the rate of hospitalizations declined significantly to 28% at 
eight-year follow-up. However, this 28% rate only declined to 24% by the time of the 16-
year follow-up.

While the rates of these three major treatment modalities have substantially declined for 
patients with borderline personality disorder over time, the fact that they have barely 
declined in the second eight years of follow-up suggests that these may be chronic rates of 
treatment going forward. The good news in terms of cost is the relatively low rate of 
psychiatric hospitalizations at 16-year follow-up (24%). In a similar vein, only 15% of

patients with borderline personality disorder had multiple hospitalizations, while only 4% 
spent 30 days or more in a psychiatric inpatient unit.

However, the question remains if these rates will remain stable going forward or if there is 
anything clinicians or the health care system can do or would want to do to lower these rates 
further. It may be that these rates at 16-year follow-up of individual therapy (65%) and 
standing medication (71%) are helping patients with borderline personality disorder stay out 
of the hospital. And the rate of more costly forms of these outpatient modalities has also 
dropped. More specifically, the rate of intensive individual therapy dropped from 36% to 
13%, and the rate of aggressive polypharmacy (three or more concurrent medications) 
dropped from 46% to 36%.

However, the relatively high percentages of patients who reported that they were using 
individual therapy and standing medications over the second eight years of follow-up is 
striking, particularly given the high rates of sustained remissions found over the 16 years of 
follow-up (16). For example, 99% of patients with borderline personality disorder reported a 
two-year remission, 95% reported a four-year remission, and 90% reported a six-year 
remission. It may be that these patients were dealing with residual symptoms of borderline 
personality disorder, particularly the less dramatic or temperamental symptoms (e.g., 
anxiety, abandonment concerns, undue dependency) that have been found to resolve more 
slowly than the acute symptoms of this disorder (e.g. self-harm, suicide attempts, quasi-
psychotic thought) (17). It may also be that these patients were being treated for axis I 
disorders that had never remitted or recurred (18).

The main limitation of this study is that all of the patients with borderline personality 
disorder were severely ill inpatients at the time of study entry. The rates of treatment use 
might be substantially lower for those with borderline personality disorder who have never 
been hospitalized and/or never been in psychiatric treatment. This same limitation applies to 
axis II comparison participants as well. In addition, reported rates of many forms of more 
intensive treatments (e.g., residential treatment, 30 days or more of psychiatric 
hospitalization) were very low for axis II comparison subjects during the last eight years of 
follow-up; consequently, due to sparseness of data, extra caution is required when 
interpreting results from our regression analyses for these particular treatments.

It is worth noting that most study participants were treated in the community. Psychotherapy 
was mostly provided by hundreds of community-based psychologists and social workers 
located throughout the US. In addition, these therapies were mostly supportive in nature and 
almost none were empirically based (20-24). Medications were prescribed by psychiatrists 
in general practice or, increasingly, by primary care physicians.
