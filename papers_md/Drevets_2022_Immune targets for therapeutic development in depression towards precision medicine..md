Abstract | Over the past two decades, compelling evidence has emerged indicating that immune 
mechanisms can contribute to the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and that 
drugs with primary immune targets can improve depressive symptoms. Patients with MDD  
are heterogeneous with respect to symptoms, treatment responses and biological correlates. 
Defining a narrower patient group based on biology could increase the treatment response rates 
in certain subgroups: a major advance in clinical psychiatry. For example, patients with MDD and 
elevated pro-inflammatory biomarkers are less likely to respond to conventional antidepressant 
drugs, but novel immune-based therapeutics could potentially address their unmet clinical 
needs. This article outlines a framework for developing drugs targeting a novel patient subtype 
within MDD and reviews the current state of neuroimmune drug development for mood dis-
orders. We discuss evidence for a causal role of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of  
depression, together with targets under investigation in randomized controlled trials, biomarker 
evidence elucidating the link to neural mechanisms, biological and phenotypic patient selection 
strategies, and the unmet clinical need among patients with MDD.

Currently available therapeutics for major depressive 
disorder (MDD) lead to remission in approximately 
one third of patients and partial remission in another 
third1. This heterogeneity in treatment outcomes is 
thought to reflect the biological heterogeneity present 
within patients with MDD. Various forms of immune 
biomarker abnormalities characterize patients with poor 
treatment outcomes2–4, which has raised interest in tar-
geting mechanisms in the immune system as precision 
medicine approaches in psychiatry.

The relationship between immune dysregulation and 
depression cuts across a fault line in the conventional 
diagnostic categorization of depression5. On one side of 
the line is a large group of patients diagnosed with MDD, 
defined by a clinical checklist comprising at least one of 
two core symptoms (low mood and anhedonia), and at 
least three of seven other defined symptoms, for at least 
2 weeks, to a distressing or disabling degree. Formally, 
the diagnosis of MDD is excluded if the patient has a 
medical or physiological condition that could explain 
the depression. On the other side of the diagnostic fault 
line is a second large group of patients who manifest 
major depressive symptoms in the context of primary 
immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s 
disease or systemic lupus erythematosus. These patients 

are ineligible for a diagnosis of MDD. Instead, they are 
typically diagnosed with ‘comorbid depression’ and 
coded more formally using the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) cate-
gory of “depressive disorder due to another medical con-
dition”, based partly on the criterion of “evidence from 
the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings 
that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological  
consequence of another medical condition”.

In this context, the immunology of depression is 
diagnostically disruptive, because immune dysfunction 
could contribute to both comorbid depression (associ-
ated with clinical inflammation) and MDD in a propor-
tion of individuals who also have laboratory evidence of 
low-grade inflammation. Moreover, additional hetero-
geneity likely exists within this subset of patients with 
MDD and immune dysfunction. For example, one group 
accrued evidence for an ‘immunometabolic’ subtype of 
MDD by clustering immunological and metabolic dys-
regulations (such as elevated leptin levels and reduced 
insulin sensitivity) with specific behavioural symptoms 
that reflect an altered balance between energy intake 
and expenditure (hyperphagia, weight gain, hypersom-
nia and fatigue). This cluster of clinical features and 
biomarker abnormalities persisted in this subgroup of

patients for several years6. Other MDD subgroups have 
also been described that have distinct or partly over-
lapping clusters of immune biomarker abnormalities, 
along with different phenotypic patterns of symptoms 
and non-responsiveness to conventional antidepres-
sants, especially to selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (SSRIs)4. Therefore, immune modulators could alter 
antidepressant efficacy for people with MDD and bio-
marker evidence of immune dysfunction related to the 
targeted pathway, as well as for individuals with comor-
bid depressive symptoms; these patients rank treatments 
for depressive symptoms as one of their greatest unmet 
medical needs7.

To pursue these ideas, we address the criteria required 
to develop a therapeutic for a novel subtype for patients 
within the broader MDD diagnostic class (Box 1). First, 
we consider evidence for a causal association between 
immune dysregulation and depression, and the poten-
tial targets implicated thus far. Second, we walk through 
the randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) that 
have been performed to date. We next examine emerging 
evidence of biomarkers associated with MDD for their 
potential as tools for patient stratification in clinical tri-
als as well as in clinical treatment algorithms, and as end 
points in proof-of-concept studies of novel agents. In the 
final section, we discuss the unmet medical need among 
patients whose MDD seems to be mediated through an 
immune mechanism.

Evidence for causality
There is overwhelming evidence that immune dys-
regulation and depression are associated or correlated 
with each other8–10. MDD has been associated with ele-
vated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute 
phase proteins in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 
a decreased adaptive immune response, differences in 
the relative abundance of specific immune cell types, 
a bias towards autoimmunity, increased activation of 
microglia and other immune changes (Fig. 1). The most 
compelling rationale for developing immune-targeted 
drugs for depression, however, would be evidence that 
immune dysregulation can indeed cause depression in 
susceptible individuals, rather than merely evidence 

Box 1 | Criteria for immune-targeted precision medicine in MDD

For successful drug development of an immune-directed compound in major 
depressive disorder (MDD), several criteria must be met.

Causality
The link between immune dysfunction and depression must be causal or a contributing 
factor to the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms.

Targetability
The causal biology or its upstream or downstream molecular pathways must be 
targetable, via either peripheral or central drug delivery.

Diagnosability
a biologically sound approach to selecting patients for specific treatment must be 
identified, and ultimately the diagnostic approach must be scalable, affordable and 
accessible.

Unmet need
In comparative analyses of patients who do or do not fulfil the criteria for treatment,  
a demonstrable unmet need under treatment as usual must exist for selected patients.

for an association between immune dysfunction and 
depression. We must therefore also understand how a 
peripheral or central immune target alters the functional 
organization of the central nervous system (CNS), thus 
distally causing depressive changes in emotion, cognition  
and behaviour.

In the rest of this section, we predominantly review 
human studies because these data are most directly 
relevant to the early clinical development of novel 
immunotherapeutics  for  patients  with  depression. 
Nevertheless, strong preclinical evidence also indicates 
that peripheral and central immune mechanisms can 
have adverse effects on neuronal function and cause 
anhedonia, social isolation and other depressive-like 
behaviours in animals11–15. Finally, we note that although 
immune pathways are complex and interconnected 
(Fig. 1), most studies in MDD have focused on the role 
of pro-inflammatory actors of the innate immune sys-
tem and their therapeutic modulation. By contrast, the 
potential for harnessing mechanisms within the adap-
tive immune system to discover further therapeutic  
innovation in neuropsychiatry is relatively unexplored.

Longitudinal and challenge studies
Longitudinal studies have tested the hypothesis that 
inflammation can precede depression, which is nec-
essary if inflammation is causal. There is supportive 
evidence for inflammation preceding depression or 
depressive symptoms over a wide range of timescales. 
A high concentration of IL-6 in blood at age 9 years 
predicted an elevated risk of depression at age 18 years 
in a UK birth cohort16. Middle-aged women who were 
not with depression but had C-reactive protein (CRP) 
levels higher than the upper limit of the normal range 
(3 mg/l) when tested in 2004 and 2008 were significantly 
more likely to present depression for the first time in 
2012 than women who had normal CRP levels over the 
previous years17. Finally, among women with depression 
at baseline in the Netherlands Study of Depression and 
Anxiety (NESDA), higher IL-6 levels predicted a chronic 
course of MDD based on 2-year and 6-year follow-up 
evaluations18.

Challenge studies have demonstrated that an inter-
vention causing immune activation can increase rates 
of depressive symptoms on short to medium timescales. 
For example, about a third of patients with hepatitis 
who were treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine 
interferon-α (IFNα) had developed major depressive 
symptoms when reassessed 4–48 weeks later19,20. In 
many patients who manifested the new onset of a major 
depressive episode following IFNα therapy, the adminis-
tration of SSRI antidepressants ameliorated these depres-
sive symptoms21. As another example, the experimental 
administration of typhoid vaccine increased blood IL-6 
levels and caused transient depressive or dysphoric 
symptoms within 24–48 h (reF.22).

Genetics and epigenetics
Genetic research is fundamental to target validation: 
an association between a disease and DNA variation in 
a particular gene implicates that gene in pathogenesis. 
Genetically validated targets have a higher probability

of leading to successful drug development in many  
therapeutic areas23.

Genetic evidence that immune-related genes are 
causally implicated in depression is beginning to emerge. 
In the last few years, genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) and meta-analyses have become sufficiently 
powerful, with sample sizes in the order of hundreds 
of thousands, to report statistically robust associations 
between allelic variations and MDD. In one of the largest 
studies to date, pathway analysis of 44 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms  (SNPs)  from  a  MDD  GWAS  gene 
list indicated enrichment for 19 pathways, including 
cytokine and immune response pathways24. Many of 
the genetic variants that are significantly associated 
with MDD by GWAS are in non-coding regions of the 
genome and were enriched at epigenetically active regu-
latory sites in fetal and adult brain tissue, and in periph-
eral lymphoid cells, indicating that genetic risks for 
MDD are likely to be phenotypically expressed through 
both the adaptive immune system and the CNS25. In a  
candidate gene Mendelian randomization analysis,  
a functional SNP in the IL-6 receptor promoter region 
predicted levels of IL-6, CRP and depressive symptom 
severity in a population cohort26. In another candi-
date gene study of a distinct functional polymorphism 
in the IL-6 receptor promoter region (rs1800795), the 
‘low IL-6’ genotype was associated with fewer depres-
sive symptoms during IFNα treatment27. Furthermore, 
CRP levels and individual depressive symptoms are 
co-inherited28. Finally, genetic variation in P2RX7, which 
encodes the purinergic receptor P2X7, was implicated to 
cause depression in a study that integrated depression 
GWAS with human brain proteome data29. P2X7 is an 
ATP-gated cation channel that is abundantly expressed  
in myeloid cells, including microglia, and P2X7 stimula-
tion mediates activation of t he NoD-, Lrr- and pyrin domain- 
containing 3 (NLrP3) inflammasome complex, which is a 
key mediator of innate immune activation30. This finding 
was replicated in an independent depression GWAS and 
proteome-wide association study data set and extended 
using cis-regulated mRNA levels associated with depres-
sion in an integrated depression GWAS plus human brain 
transcriptomic analysis29. In candidate gene studies,  
haplotypes containing gain-of-function SNPs of P2RX7 
that increase P2X7 pore activity31 were associated with 
increased time spent with depression32 and increased 
depression  severity  among  patients  with  bipolar 
disorder33,34, MDD and type 1 diabetes mellitus35–37.

NOD-, LRR- and pyrin 
domain-containing 3 
(NLRP3) inflammasome 
complex
A complex of proteins, 
including NLrP3, that 
functions as a pattern 
recognition receptor that 
recognizes pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns or products 
of damaged cells, and when 
activated, triggers an immune 
response.

Glucocorticoid
A generic term for 
corticosteroid hormones, such 
as cortisol, involved in glucose 
metabolism and energy 
mobilization, which under 
many conditions also exert 
anti-inflammatory and 
immunosuppressive activity.

Hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis
A neuroendocrine system that 
controls reactions to stress and 
regulates a variety of body 
processes such as energy 
mobilization, immune function 
and emotional behaviour. it 
comprises a complex network 
of interactions among the 
hypothalamus, pituitary gland 
and adrenal gland.

Epigenetics  will  also  be  important  to  validate 
immune targets for depression and other stress-related 
disorders. In epigenetic studies in humans, as well as 
in animal models of MDD, DNA methylation of GR, 
which encodes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), or of 
FKBP5, which encodes a GR-chaperone protein, reduced 
expression of glucocorticoid hormone-responsive sig-
nals to such an extent that it increased pro-inflammatory 
biomarkers  in  response  to  social  and  behavioural 
stress. This observation reflects the role of glucocorti-
coids in immune system regulation, as the activated  
GR–glucocorticoid complex upregulates the expression 
of anti-inflammatory proteins and suppresses the expres-
sion of pro-inflammatory proteins38. Therefore, epigen-
etic effects that reduce GR signalling putatively release 
some innate immune mechanisms from the negative 
feedback normally mediated by glucocorticoids via the 
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis39,40. Such epigenetic 
‘memories’ of early life stress may reflect a persistent 
allostatic change related to the glucocorticoid resistance 
previously associated with MDD41 and with the clini-
cally well-recognized increased risk of MDD in adult 
life following an episode of adversity in childhood42. 
These epigenetic data thus converge with the results of 
gene expression studies in patients with depression to 
provide evidence that immune system dysregulation 
and reduced GR signalling (which restrains the effects 
of some pro-inflammatory mediators, including P2X7 
signalling) contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD43.
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in brain 
tissue obtained post-mortem from individuals with 
mood disorders who died of suicide and in blood sam-
pled from patients with depression with suicide idea-
tion associated suicide risk with additive epigenetic 
and genetic factors at a locus in SKA2, which regulates 
GR transactivation44. Another study of tissue obtained 
post-mortem from the prefrontal cortex of patients with 
depression who completed suicide found differentially 
methylated regions, versus non-psychiatric controls, 
in the psoriasis susceptibility gene, PSORS1C3, and in 
TAPBP, which is located in the major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) and encodes a glycoprotein that medi-
ates interaction between MHC class I molecules and the 
transporter associated with antigen processing43. Finally, 
genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression 
analyses performed in patients prospectively defined as 
either responders or non-responders to treatment with 
the SSRI escitalopram identified two genes that exhib-
ited increased DNA methylation and mRNA expression 
in the non-responders: JAK2, which encodes a protein 
that activates both innate and adaptive immunity; and 
CHN2, which may affect hippocampal neurogenesis45. 
Interestingly, whole methylome screening in a small 
case–control study of MDD demonstrated that methyl-
ation of peripheral white blood cells was highly cor-
related with the methylome of frontal cortex and other 
brain regions46, suggesting that stress disorder-related 
epi genetic changes may be coupled across peripheral 
immune cells, which are distal to the site of inflam-
mation but easy to measure, and proximal neuronal and 
glial cells, which are found in the brain and, therefore, 
difficult to assess in the clinic.

In summary, whereas emerging genetic data support 
the hypothesis that immune mechanisms contribute  
to the pathogenesis of mood disorders, highly penetrant, 
clearly causal mutations have not yet been identified. 
These data instead corroborate the broader conclusion 
from genetic studies of psychiatric disorders that their 
aetiology involves daunting polygenicity and phenotypic 
complexity, and poses significant challenges for the elu-
cidation of potential therapeutic targets47. Nevertheless, 
the genetic data converge with other evidence to impli-
cate specific immune-related gene networks in the 
pathophysiology of MDD, which has guided early efforts 
to evaluate drugs targeting these immune pathways as 
potential therapeutics for depression.

Immune targets evaluated in depression
Several  immune-targeted  compounds  have  been 
evaluated  for  potential  antidepressant  effects.  The 
studies assessing these effects use three approaches: 
meta-analyses of changes in depressive symptoms within 
aggregate data from clinical trials of primary immuno-
logical disorders; analyses of mood effects in immuno-
logy clinical trials for which patient-level data were 
available; and RCTs in patients with MDD (TABLe 1). The 
first two of those approaches were opportunistic insofar 
as each study’s primary outcome measure assessed the 
efficacy of the compound in improving key symptoms of  
an immunological disease, and the post hoc analyses  
of effects on depression ratings were exploratory. By con-
trast, the third approach is the most direct exploration 
of the effect of a compound, or evaluation of a mecha-
nism of action, as a potentially viable antidepressant 
pharmacotherapy.

Numerous  targets  and  mechanisms  have  been 
evaluated that modulate different points within com-
plex  immune  networks.  These  targets  include  the 
production of prostaglandins, which is inhibited by 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); a variety 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF), IL-6, IL-12/23, IL-23), which have been targeted 
using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); p38 MAP kinase 
(also known as MAPK14), which not only orchestrates 
innate immunity but also regulates the adaptive immune 
system; and B cell-related targets (such as CD20 and the 
soluble B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)). Additionally, 
several classes of compounds with anti-inflammatory 
effects among their pleiotropic actions (glucocorti-
coids, statins, minocycline, pioglitazone) have been  
evaluated. For example, statins, in addition to their 
lipid-lowering effects, have immunomodulatory and 
anti-inflammatory effects that include inhibition of 
pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in monocytes 
and reduction of CRP levels48,49.

However,  in  most  of  these  studies  of  anti- 
inflammatory treatments in depression, target engage-
ment was insufficiently assessed, therefore causality 
cannot be proven (proof requires that the decrease in 
inflammation is apparent and precedes the improvement 
in symptoms). Another limitation of this research is that 
it predominantly assessed modulation of inflammation 
and the innate immune response, leaving considerable 
room for innovation in targeting aspects of adaptive 

immunity, a wider range of immune cell types and 
autoantibody-driven pathologies.

Clinical trials
The ability of anti-inflammatory treatments to produce 
antidepressant effects was initially demonstrated in 
secondary analyses of studies in patients with immuno-
logical disorders that included depressive symptom rat-
ings. These studies focused predominantly on NSAIDs 
and cytokine inhibitors, and are included in several 
meta-analyses50–53 (Fig. 2). Köhler et al. reported results 
for 6,262 participants across 14 trials, of which 10 eval-
uated the efficacy of NSAIDs and 4 evaluated cytokine 
inhibitors targeting TNF or IL-12/23 (reF.50). They found 
significant pooled effects for NSAIDs (standardized 
mean difference (SMD) 0.27, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.08–0.45; a positive SMD indicates an effect that 
favours treatment) and cytokine inhibitors (SMD 0.38, 
95% CI −0.12–0.88). Kappelmann et al. performed a ran-
dom effect meta-analysis of 7 RCTs of 2,370 participants 
and found a significant effect of cytokine inhibitors on 
depressive symptoms compared with placebo (SMD 0.4, 
95% CI 0.22–0.59), and specifically for TNF inhibitors 
(SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.06–0.6)51. Köhler-Forsberg et al.  
evaluated  a  wider  range  of  drug  classes  and  com-
bined studies evaluating treatment effects in comorbid 
depression as well as in MDD. Overall, they reported 
significant effects across pooled NSAIDs (SMD 0.4,  
95% CI 0.18–1.62) and cytokine inhibitors (SMD 0.56, 
95% CI 0.19–0.93), as well as glucocorticoids (SMD 0.9, 
95% CI 0.36–1.44), statins (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.04–0.48) 
and minocycline (SMD 0.87, 95% CI 0.29–1.45). A sixth 
drug class composed of pioglitazone did not show a  
significant antidepressant effect (SMD 0.43, 95% CI −0.7 
to 1.56)52 (Fig. 2).

There  are  several  challenges  to  interpreting  the 
improvements in comorbid depressive symptoms in  
the context of a medical immune or inflammatory dis-
order that is responsive to the same treatment. First, most 
patients with primary immunological disorders enter 
studies with depression ratings in the non-depression 
range, so sensitivity for detecting an antidepressant effect 
is limited to the minority of patients with clinically sig-
nificant depression at baseline. Second, improvement in 
primary disease symptoms, including pain and fatigue, 
could confound the improvements in mood51.

To address these concerns, Wittenberg et al. reported 
a mega-analysis of patient-level data combined from 18 
RCTs conducted by Janssen or GlaxoSmithKline, each 
of which examined 1 of 9 disorders, for 9 drugs against 
7 different molecular targets (n = 10,743 participants)53. 
Access to patient-level data enabled stratification of 
patients at baseline into a high-depressive symptom 
cohort and a low-depressive symptom cohort, the former 
being the appropriately enriched population for detect-
ing an antidepressant effect. Access to patient-level data 
also enabled the statistical adjustment for potential con-
founding factors including changes in symptom sever-
ity for the primary indication (for example, changes in 
joint pain in trials of rheumatoid arthritis). The greatest 
effects were seen among anti-IL-6 antibodies (SMD 0.8, 
95%  CI 0.20–1.41)  and  an  anti-IL-12/23  antibody

(SMD 0.48, 95% CI 0.26–0.70) (Fig. 2). Antibodies target-
ing BLyS and TNF demonstrated a non-significant trend 
towards improved depressive symptoms, and small mol-
ecules targeting p38 MAP kinase or cyclooxygenase 2  
(COX2) had no significant antidepressant effect (Fig. 2).
Although most of the attention on cytokine antag-
onists as antidepressants has focused on antibodies 
against TNF and IL-6, some studies noted a positive 
effect of the IL-12/23 antagonist ustekinumab on depres-
sive symptoms53,54. Newer compounds such as gusel-
kumab more selectively target IL-23. In patients with 
moderate-severe plaque psoriasis, guselkumab treat-
ment was associated with a significant improvement in 
anxiety and depression symptoms relative to placebo55.
In summary, in seeking immune targets that might 
cause or contribute to MDD, a number of proteins have 
been suggested through longitudinal studies, inflamma-
tory challenges, genetics and epigenetics, and studies in 
patients with comorbid immunological disorders. These 
include TNF, IL-6, IL-23, COX enzymes and P2X7. To 
date, only a subset of these has been tested in patients 
with primary mood disorders.

Immune drug development in MDD
Few studies have tested whether immunomodulatory 
drugs produce antidepressant efficacy in patients with 
MDD or bipolar disorder, and most of these studies used 
drugs that reportedly improved depressive symptoms 
arising comorbidly in patients with a primary immuno-
logical disorder or influenced immunological processes 
that affect synaptic function in preclinical models. For 
example, several cytokines — including TNF, IL-6 and 
IL-1β — are considered ‘neuroactive’ because they  
modulate synaptic plasticity mechanisms such as neuro-
genesis  or  dendritic  remodelling,  and/or  mediate  
neuronal–glial interactions. The drugs assessed to date 
include mAbs that neutralize cytokines or cytokine 
receptors,  compounds  that  alter  molecular  factors 
that are induced by cytokines (for example, cyclooxy-
genases, prostaglandins, kynurenine metabolites) and 
molecules that affect the production, maturation, pro-
cessing, release and downstream signalling induced by 
cytokines (Fig. 3).

Antibodies targeting cytokines or cytokine receptors. 
The first anti-cytokine antibody tested in patients with 
MDD was infliximab, an anti-TNF antibody, which was 
studied in two RCTs. Raison et al. focused on patients 
(n = 60) who were moderately treatment resistant, and 

stratified patients based on high-sensitivity CRP levels 
≥2 mg l–1 (reF.56) (TABLe 1). Infliximab was studied as an 
augmentation therapy (n = 37) or in medication-free 
subjects (n = 23). The primary outcome measure (change 
in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17-item version 
(HDRS-17) score at 12 weeks) did not differ between the 
treatment and placebo arms. However, a post hoc anal-
ysis suggested that for patients with baseline CRP levels 
≥5 mg l–1, infliximab’s treatment effect exceeded that of 
placebo. Infliximab was also tested by McIntyre et al. in 
60 participants who were in the depression phase of bipo-
lar disorder and who had been non-responsive to con-
ventional antidepressants57. Infliximab or placebo was 
administered adjunctively. The primary outcome meas-
ure (change in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating 
Scale (MADRS) at 12 weeks) did not differ between 
treatment and placebo arms; however, a post hoc anal-
ysis suggested a treatment effect among patients with a 
childhood history of physical abuse. Notably, peripher-
ally administered antibodies are expected to exert their 
effects predominantly outside the CNS because of the 
limited permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to 
large molecules. The ability of infliximab to affect CNS 
targets, directly or indirectly, remains unclear.

The anti-IL-6 antibody sirukumab was tested as an 
adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD who were 
inadequately responsive to conventional antidepressants, 
and had plasma CRP levels ≥3 mg l–1 at screening and 
baseline58. The change in HDRS-17 score at week 12 did 
not differ significantly between the sirukumab and pla-
cebo arms. However, secondary analyses showed that the 
mean Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) anhedo-
nia rating improved in the sirukumab group versus the 
control group (nominal P = 0.014). Moreover, the mean 
HDRS-17 score decreased to a greater extent in patients 
treated with sirukumab than in those treated with pla-
cebo for participants with baseline CRP values ≥8 mg l–1 
(although the subset of people with such CRP levels was 
relatively small).

The observation that sirukumab, a mAb that is poorly 
brain penetrant, may improve anhedonia has interest-
ing implications. Potentially consistent with this obser-
vation, studies in animal models showed that anti-IL-6 
antibodies, which directly neutralize IL-6 in the periph-
ery, can reduce the amount of IL-6 in the brain, and have 
profound effects on anhedonia-like behaviours in rodent 
depression models14.

However,  an  open-label  study  in  patients  with 
rheumatoid arthritis using tocilizumab, a mAb that 

230 | March 2022 | voluMe 21 

0123456789();: www.nature.com/nrdReviewstargets the IL-6 receptor, found no significant change 
in depression symptom ratings on the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale (HADS), which is sensitive to 
anhedonia59. Tocilizumab has poor brain penetrance, 
so these data suggest that blocking IL-6 receptors in the 
CNS rather than the periphery may be necessary. By 
contrast, by neutralizing IL-6 cytokines in the periphery, 
sirukumab may have reduced IL-6 receptor signalling in 
the CNS as well as in the periphery60.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Several clini-
cal trials in mood disorders have assessed the potential 
antidepressant effects of small-molecule drugs target-
ing molecular factors that interact with cytokines. The 
most commonly used agents have been NSAIDs that are 
known to be brain penetrant, including selective COX2 
inhibitors (celecoxib), dual COX1 and COX2 inhibitors 
(naproxen, ibuprofen, high-dose aspirin) or predomi-
nantly COX1 inhibitors (low-dose aspirin). COX1 and 
COX2 inhibition can differentially affect neuroplas-
ticity and neuroprotection mechanisms in some pre-
clinical models61,62. These effects are mediated partly

Fig. 2 | Antidepressant effects of immunomodulatory drugs. Meta-analyses of 
placebo-controlled effects of various mechanistic classes of immunotherapeutics on 
‘comorbid’ depressive symptoms, measured as secondary end points in randomized  
clinical trials of medical inflammatory disorders50–53, show that some immunomodulatory 
drugs may improve depressive symptoms. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and

by modulatory effects on the arachidonic acid pathway, 
which is implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar 
disorder63, and by preventing neurotoxicity associated 
with inflammation-driven activation of the kynurenine 
metabolic pathway (see below), which has been asso-
ciated with reduced volumes of the hippocampus and 
other subcortical structures in MDD64,65.

As detailed elsewhere66,67, the sample sizes of these 
studies have been small, so meta-analyses have been con-
ducted to increase statistical power (Fig. 2). Among four 
RCTs that evaluated celecoxib as an augmentation ther-
apy in MDD, three found the celecoxib arm to be supe-
rior, although in one the beneficial effect at 4 weeks was 
no longer significant at the 8-week end point (TABLe 1). 
None  of  these  studies  stratified  patients  based  on 
immune biomarkers, but in one study the baseline levels 
of serum IL-6 predicted changes in depression ratings  
at 6 weeks68. The results of studies assessing the anti-
depressant effects of adjunctive anti-inflammatory agents  
in bipolar depression are also mixed. A meta-analysis of 
eight RCTs that assessed adjunctive NSAIDs, omega-3 
fatty acids, N-acetylcysteine and pioglitazone showed a 
moderate antidepressant effect compared with stand-
ard therapy; significant effects were observed for the 
omega-3 and N-acetylcysteine arms, but not for NSAIDs 
(SMD −0.02, 95% CI −0.56 to 0.52)69. These data showed 
a significant overall benefit of small-to-moderate effect 
size for combined results across NSAIDs, but no signif-
icant benefit for studies that evaluated selective COX2 
inhibitors alone (Fig. 2).

Results of studies exploring more selective inhibi-
tion of COX1 in mood disorders are similarly mixed. 
A pharmacoepidemiological study found that low-dose 
aspirin showed benefits in stabilizing the illness course 
in bipolar disorder (the benefit was fewer medication 
changes), whereas high-dose aspirin, non-selective 
NSAIDs, selective COX2 inhibitors and glucocorti-
coids were associated with an increase in medication 
changes70. Similarly, a pharmacoepidemiological study 
of risk for developing MDD71 found that continued  
use of low-dose aspirin, as well as of statins, decreased 
the rate of incident depression, whereas continued use 
of non-aspirin NSAIDs or high-dose aspirin increased 
the rate of incident depression. Nevertheless, in a trial 
comparing health outcomes on low-dose aspirin versus 
placebo in older adults (n = 19,114, with 1,879 patients 
with depression at baseline), the depression symp-
toms increased to a greater extent in the aspirin arm  
versus the placebo arm across a median of 4.7 years67; 
among individuals with depression at baseline, aspirin 
was associated with a worsening in depression ratings. 
Finally, low-dose aspirin failed to reduce the incidence 
of new cases of depression72.

Minocycline and kynurenine metabolism. Another 
brain-penetrant,  small-molecule  drug  tested  for 
potential  antidepressant  effects  is  the  tetracycline 
antibiotic, minocycline, which  exhibits pleiotropic 
anti-inflammatory effects in the periphery and the 
brain73. Minocycline modulates immune function by 
inhibiting the activation, migration and/or prolifera-
tion of T cells, neutrophils and microglia, inhibiting the

release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing 
the release of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic 
molecules74,75.  In  addition,  minocycline  indirectly 
reduces  the  pro-inflammatory  activation  of  the 
kynurenine pathway by attenuating the expression of 
cytokines that are produced during a pro-inflammatory 
challenge,  thereby  reducing  release  of  neuroactive 
kynurenine metabolites66,76.

In  rodent  models,  the  depression-like  behav-
iours  induced  via  inflammatory  challenge  with 

lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  are  blocked  by  genetic 
or  pharmacological  (using  minocycline  or  the

1-methyltryptophan)  reduction  in  the  activity 
of  the  enzyme,  IDO,  that  converts  tryptophan  to 
kynurenine76,77.  Cytokines  such  as  IFNγ  and  TNF 
activate the kynurenine pathway by increasing IDO 
expression, thereby shunting tryptophan away from 
serotonin synthesis and towards kynurenine, increasing 
the production of neuroactive kynurenine metabolites.

these metabolites: increased metabolism down the 
3-hydroxykynurenine branch leads to increased lev-
els of the putatively neurotoxic metabolite, quinolinic 
acid78. A post-mortem study of patients with MDD or 
bipolar disorder who died by suicide showed elevated 
concentrations of quinolinic acid in microglia in ros-
tral and subgenual portions of the anterior cingulate  
cortex (ACC), a key region in the neurocircuitry of dep-
ression79. In MRI studies, the relative quantities of the  
putatively neuroprotective kynurenine  metabolite, 
kynurenic acid, and the putatively neurotoxic kynure-
nine metabolites, 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic 
acid, in blood correlated with reductions in grey mat-
ter thickness in this cortical region and a diagnosis of 
MDD; reductions in cortex thickness also correlated 
with elevated CRP levels80. The relative reduction in 
levels of kynurenic acid versus quinolinic acid also has 
been associated with reductions in hippocampal and 
amygdala volumes65, as well as with altered hippocampal 
function during emotion-dependent  autobiographical 
memory recall in patients with MDD81.

Based on minocycline’s effects — reducing cytokine 
release and indirectly reducing IDO function — several 
RCTs have assessed its antidepressant efficacy in MDD 
and bipolar disorder. Husain et al. examined mino-
cycline as an adjunctive therapy for patients who were 
resistant to conventional antidepressants82. In the mino-
cycline arm (n = 21), patients had a greater decrease in 
HDRS-17 scores compared with those in the placebo 
arm (n = 20) at week 12 (standardized effect size 1.21, 
P < 0.001). By contrast, Dean et al. studied the efficacy 
of adjunctive minocycline treatment in patients selected 
from the general MDD population83, and found no sig-
nificant change in MADRS scores, although improve-
ments were observed in secondary outcomes related to 
global functioning and quality of life. Nevertheless, the 
negative primary outcome of the trial in participants 
from the general MDD population may highlight the 
importance of selecting patients based on biomarkers 
or treatment resistance to conventional antidepressants. 
Finally, as a passing comment, in an open-label study in 
which minocycline was added to SSRI antidepressants  
in patients with MDD with psychotic features, the 
antidepressant effect was profound, and this study  
population is generally non-responsive to SSRIs alone84.
Two studies assessed the efficacy of adjunctive mino-
cycline for improving depressive symptoms in bipolar 
disorder. Husain et al. compared the efficacy of mino-
cycline plus active celecoxib, minocycline alone and 
celecoxib alone versus placebo85. The mean change in 
HDRS-17 scores at 12 weeks did not differ across groups. 
By contrast, Savitz et al. tested the efficacy of low-dose 
aspirin and minocycline as augmentation therapy for 
bipolar depression86, in patients randomized to receive 
minocycline plus aspirin, minocycline alone, aspirin 
alone or placebo. The primary outcome measure was 
treatment response at week 6, defined conventionally 
as ≥50% decrease in the MADRS score. The minocy-
cline plus aspirin group showed a significantly greater 
response rate than the placebo alone group. When all 
four arms were included in the analysis, the main effect 

of aspirin (but not minocycline) on treatment response 
was significant. Nevertheless, a significant interaction 
with serum IL-6 level was observed, indicating a greater 
response to minocycline versus placebo among partici-
pants with high IL-6 levels. Thus, although minocycline 
had a non-significant effect in the entire sample, con-
sistent with the results of Husain et al., the preliminary 
observation that patients with bipolar disorder and 
depression, as well as elevated basal IL-6 levels, may 
benefit from minocycline warrants further testing14,87,88.

Signalling molecules involved in cytokine production. 
p38 MAP kinase plays a key role in pro-inflammatory 
cytokine synthesis. This gene was implicated as a hub in 
a network of white blood cell genes for which expression 
differed between individuals with MDD and healthy 
subjects in a meta-analysis89. A small-molecule inhibi-
tor of p38 MAP kinase, losmapimod, was studied in two 
RCTs in participants with MDD90. Patients were selected 
for loss of energy and/or interest and psychomotor retar-
dation but were excluded for previous antidepressant 
treatment resistance. Neither study showed a significant 
advantage for losmapimod versus placebo. The extent of 
target engagement within the CNS was not established 
in these studies.

Microglial activation. Recently, a focus in CNS drug 
development has turned towards targets that modulate 
microglial activation, especially via the P2X7–NLRP3 
axis30. As an ATP-gated ion channel, P2X7 responds to 
extracellular ATP, which is released by stressed or dying 
cells or by psychosocial stress91. During innate immune 
responses, damage-associated molecular patterns or 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns activate pat-
tern recognition receptors (namely the Toll-like recep-
tors (TLRs)) that induce ATP release, thus activating 
P2X7. Two convergent signals are required for microglial 
activation. The TLR-mediated activation of the NF-κB 
pathway activation acts as a first signal, promoting the 
transcription of genes encoding inflammatory media-
tors, such as pro-IL-1β, and inflammasome components, 
such as NLRP3; P2X7 stimulation is the second signal, 
inducing inflammasome activation and the subsequent 
activation of caspase 1, which processes pro-IL-1β into 
its mature form, thereby enabling IL-1β release92. P2X7 
activation also promotes IL-6 release and stimulates 
free radical production, phospholipase activation, cell 
cycle regulation and apoptosis. During adaptive immune 
responses, P2X7 stimulation participates in T cell acti-
vation, and ATP–P2X7 signalling decreases the suppres-
sive activity and viability of regulatory T cells (Treg cells), 
favouring polarization of T cells into T helper 17 cells 
(TH17 cells)92.

P2X7 activation on microglia has been reported to have 
a pathological role in neuroinflammatory diseases (such 
as multiple sclerosis) and neuropsychiatric disorders, 
including MDD12,93–96. In patients with MDD, the P2RX7 
mRNA levels were abnormally increased in individuals 
who were treatment resistant, irrespective of medication 
status, but reduced in medicated, treatment-responsive 
patients in remission97. Compatible with these data, 
abnormal increases in the expression of TLR proteins

and mRNA transcripts were reported in patients with 
depression and who died by suicide98. Notably, in mice, 
stress-induced depression-like behaviours were reversed 
by brain-penetrant (but not by non-brain-penetrant) 
P2X7 antagonists30. An RCT is underway to test the anti-
depressant efficacy of a brain-penetrant P2X7 antagonist, 
JNJ-54175446, in MDD.

Anti-inflammatory cytokines. Another area of emerging  
interest  in  therapeutics  discovery  involves  mecha-
nisms that enhance the release or function of anti- 
inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, which participate  
in the immune system’s inherent compensatory mecha-
nisms  for  restraining  pro-inflammatory  cytokine 
signalling.  In  preclinical  models,  the  resolution  of 
inflammation-induced  depression-like  behaviours 
required T lymphocytes, acting via an IL-10-dependent 
pathway to decrease the expression of IDO, suggesting 
that novel therapeutics targeting the T lymphocyte/
IL-10 pathway could promote recovery from MDD15. 
The importance of inherent anti-inflammatory systems 
to recovery from depression was also suggested by a 
longitudinal study of MDD that assessed immune bio-
markers before and after antidepressant pharmacother-
apy; although treatment responders and non-responders 
both had elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
pretreatment and increased levels of anti-inflammatory 
cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10) post-treatment, the 
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels remained elevated 
only in the non-responders99. These data suggest that 
patients with MDD who respond poorly to conventional 
antidepressants manifest a defective anti-inflammatory 
response. Nevertheless, despite these encouraging leads, 
there has been no study yet in individuals with MDD 
with the objective of increasing anti-inflammatory 
activity.

Assessment of mechanism
Although most studies associating immune dysregula-
tion and clinical depression have focused on the periph-
eral immune system, understanding mechanisms in the 
CNS whereby altered function mediates depressive 
symptoms is important to prioritize potential targets 
and characterize patient subgroups that are most likely 
to benefit from new treatments. Neuroimaging biomark-
ers assessed using positron emission tomography (PET), 
MRI (including functional MRI (fMRI)) and magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provide approaches to 
elucidate the effects of altered immune function on 
CNS function. Each of these neuroimaging modalities 
has a different set of trade-offs between immune speci-
ficity of the imaging signal, spatial resolution, cost and 
accessibility.

Positron emission tomography
PET can be used to visualize the most target-specific 
biomarker of human brain inflammation, but its use in 
research is limited by its comparatively high cost and low 
accessibility; PET also involves exposure to low levels  
of radioactivity, limiting its repeat use. To date, studies of  
neuroinflammation in MDD have relied on radio ligands 
(such  as  [11C]PK11195  and  [11C]PBR28)  that  bind  

to translocator protein (TSPO), which is expressed on 
mitochondrial membranes. The TSPO binding poten-
tial increases in multiple conditions involving neuro-
inflammation. However, TSPO is expressed not only 
on microglia but also on other glial cells and neurons, 
which limits the specificity of TSPO binding as a marker 
of microglial activation. Furthermore, a common SNP 
in TSPO (rs6971) causes an amino acid substitution in 
TSPO that alters the affinity of this protein for TSPO 
ligands other than [11C]PK11195 (reF.100), a limitation 
which must be addressed in the study design. Several 
case–control PET studies in patients with MDD reported 
small or moderately sized, but statistically significant, 
increases in TSPO binding in the ACC and other regions 
in which post-mortem studies had more specifically 
shown elevated activation of microglia in individuals 
with MDD or bipolar disorder who died by suicide79,101 
(Fig. 4). Future development of ligands with greater spec-
ificity for microglia or other central immune targets is 
needed to optimize the potential of PET biomarkers of 
 neuroinflammation in depression102.

Functional MRI
fMRI data collected while patients are either performing 
simple cognitive tasks or in the ‘resting state’ can be used 
to measure functional activity in various brain regions, 
as well as the functional connectivity matrix (connec-
tome) of dynamic coherence between the resting and 
active-state fMRI signals that are simultaneously meas-
ured in paired regions. This is a relatively safe, afforda-
ble and accessible imaging biomarker, and is suitable for 
repeated assessments. However, the haemodynamic sig-
nals measured via fMRI are non-specific and limited in 
the extent to which they can inform the neurobiological 
mechanisms underlying differences observed between 
case and control samples.

A review of human fMRI studies of the effects of 
inflammation on cerebral function defined two broad 
strategies  across  this  literature:  observational  and 
experimental103. Observational studies measured the 
correlation  between  fMRI  metrics  and  blood  con-
centration of immune markers. Experimental studies 
measured fMRI metrics before and after a controlled 
pro-inflammatory stimulus (for example, typhoid vac-
cination). Meta-analysis of these data identified regions 
where functional activity was significantly changed in 
observational and experimental studies, including the 
amygdala,  hippocampus,  hypothalamus,  striatum, 
insula, midbrain and brainstem, as well as prefrontal 
and temporal cortices. This observation is consistent 
with emerging evidence that systemic inflammation 
can be correlated with, or could cause, changes in func-
tional connectivity between the areas of limbic, pre-
frontal and temporal cortices, and anatomically related 
subcortical nuclei104,105 that form the ‘medial prefron-
tal network’, which mediates and regulates emotional 
behaviour and comprises the neurocircuitry of mood 
disorders106. These data thus provide evidence that 
interactions of immune activation with brain intero-
ceptive mechanisms can mediate discrete changes in 
brain and behaviour within the context of infection and 
inflammation107,108.

Alternative  magnetic  resonance  modalities  may 
achieve greater neurobiological specificity than fMRI. 
Microstructural MRI enables measurements of physical 
parameters, such as T1 or T2 relaxation times and mag-
netization transfer, that can give insight into the levels 
of extracellular fluid, neurite density, myelination or 
other microscopic properties of brain tissue within an 
image volume element (voxel)109. Microstructural MRI 
metrics that are sensitive to the proportion of free water 

in a voxel seem intuitively more likely to be indicative of 
central inflammation than a macrostructural MRI met-
ric such as cortical volume. Recent studies reported that 
changes in the microstructural MRI parameter of proton 
density (a measure of tissue water content) were asso-
ciated with systemic inflammation, as indexed by CRP 
levels, and differed significantly in patients with MDD 
who manifested CRP levels >3 mg l–1 relative to patients 
with MDD and lower CRP levels, as well as relative to 
healthy controls with CRP levels >3 mg l–1 (reFS110,111).

neuroimaging results linking inflammation to brain states (clockwise from top

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
MRS assesses the brain tissue concentration of mole-
cules such as the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) and glutamate. MRS studies have shown that 
peripheral administration of IFNα was associated with 
increased glutamate levels in the basal ganglia and cin-
gulate cortex, which correlated with fatigue and anhedo-
nia ratings. Basal ganglia glutamate concentration was 
also higher in patients with MDD who had high levels 
of CRP (>3 mg l–1) than in patients with MDD and low 
CRP levels (<1 mg l–1)105. Although the glutamate signal 
is predominantly intracellular, these data are compat-
ible with evidence from preclinical models in which 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation 
can alter glutamate release and transport, resulting in 
increased extracellular glutamate concentrations112. 
Neuroinflammation thus has been hypothesized to 
play a role in neurotoxicity via its downstream effects 
on glutamate metabolism113. However, many factors 
other than inflammation can alter glutamate levels, 
and MRS in vivo can only resolve the minor peak of  
glutamate resonance in relatively large (~1 cm3) volumes 
of tissue.

In summary, non-invasive biomarker measures of 
central immune status that can provide anatomically 
fine-grained information on specific molecular or cel-
lular targets in the human brain are not yet available. 
The increasing use and technical refinement of fMRI, 
microstructural MRI and MRS may conceivably pro-
duce ‘bridging’ biomarkers that can be used to inves-
tigate relationships between immune mechanisms and 
depression. Further developments in PET radiochem-
istry, single-cell analysis of circulating immune cells, 
and greater assay sensitivity for studies of CSF and 
blood could provide more precise insights into immune 
mechanisms for small numbers of patients and prior-
itized immune targets. Nevertheless, peripheral blood 
biomarkers remain the most accessible and comprehen-
sive platform for assessing the immune status in large 
numbers of patients.

Patient stratification
The discovery and development of novel antidepressants 
targeting immune dysregulation will require multi-
disciplinary partnerships between researchers with  
expertise in psychiatry, experimental medicine, biomar-
ker and diagnostic development, and neuroimmunology,  
and success will likely depend on patient selection 
or  stratification  criteria.  Diverse  approaches  have  
been taken to both inclusion criteria and within-trial 
stratification among the studies reviewed above, so strat-
ification clearly remains an area of uncertainty in the 
field. A combination of varying levels of treatment resis-
tance and CRP level thresholds have been used, along 
with symptoms related to anhedonia, in patients with 
either primary mood disorders or depression arising in 
the context of primary immunological diseases. Many 
other small studies focused on ‘all-comers’ with MDD 
or bipolar disorder, which might have resulted in a false 
negative, because an experimental treatment that was 
not statistically different from placebo in an all-comers 
trial may be effective in a patient subgroup (TABLe 1).

One approach to identifying potential options for 
patient stratification is to outline the different immune 
axes along which patients with depression are statistically 
distinct from individuals without depression. As poten-
tial diagnostics, blood biomarkers are more accessible 
than imaging-based markers and provide finely detailed 
mechanistic information about the circulating compart-
ment of the peripheral immune system, although the 
extent to which central immune function can be inferred 
from peripheral immune markers remains unclear. 
Nevertheless, the output of immune-dysregulated brain 
circuits may manifest as observable symptoms and 
behaviours. Quantitatively characterizing phenotypic 
aspects of ‘immune-mediated depression’ may identify 
treatment cohorts. Too often, especially for molecular 
analyses, the focus is on analysing outcomes based on 
general clinical ratings or a diagnosis of MDD rather 
than on specific dimensional constructs, such as anhe-
donia. Ultimately, diagnostic refinement to enable pre-
cision medicine will require the collection of data from 
patient cohorts that are both phenotypically rich and 
biomarker dense.

Understanding case–control differences may prove 
helpful in generating hypotheses for candidate diag-
nostics and stratifying patients in early trial phases. But 
refinement of these diagnostics through clinical trials, 
in which treatment outcomes are characterized, will be 
needed to identify a diagnostic strategy that identifies 
the widest range of patients who are likely to benefit, 
while also enriching the target population for individuals 
with a high likelihood to benefit more from the novel 
therapeutic than from the current standard of care.

Biomarkers with diagnostic potential
A number of immune markers have some capacity to 
distinguish individuals with depression from those 
without, and to quantify the level of immune dysregula-
tion. These markers include CRP114, cytokine levels115,116, 
genome-wide gene expression89,117,118 and quantitative 
PCR (qPCR) levels of specific mRNAs97,119, ex vivo 
LPS-stimulated cytokine or gene expression levels120–123 
and quantitative immune cell counts124–128 (Fig. 1).

Studies that have derived CRP thresholds that can 
predict treatment response in the context of clinical trials 
have, to date, only identified putative ideal cut-off val-
ues post hoc56,58. However, these cut-off values identified 
subgroups that contained a small proportion of people 
with depression. Baseline IL-6 levels predicted response 
to both minocycline86 and celecoxib68. Cytokines have 
been increasingly measured using multiplex assays 
for  dozens  of  proteins,  and  both  aggregated  sum-
mary scores121 and algorithmically derived scores119,129 
have been considered as an approach to increase the  
robustness and precision of the measurements.

As diagnostic biomarkers, some cytokines are diffi-
cult to measure because levels that are considered ele-
vated in the context of MDD are often near the limit 
of quantification of available assays. Furthermore, the 
intrinsic lability of cytokines poses a concern for their 
use as diagnostic biomarkers, as they fluctuate widely 
over the course of a day and in response to activity. Just 
as glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides average

blood sugar control that is weeks long (whereas blood 
glucose levels provide a snapshot), a more stable meas-
ure of cytokine dysregulation may be more useful in the 
clinic.

Whole-genome mRNA expression has been measured  
in whole blood and in peripheral blood mononuclear  
cells in multiple MDD case–control studies — this 
analysis allows a more comprehensive assessment of 
peripheral immune pathways associated with depres-
sion89,117,118. Meta-analyses have identified that innate 
immune genes are overexpressed, and genes involved in 
adaptive immunity are under-expressed, in individuals 
with depression89. These depression-related impair-
ments of adaptive immunity are consis tent with previous 
findings130,131. Notably, the inverse relationship between 
innate and adaptive immune gene expression was evi-
dent at the level of individual subjects: individuals  
with MDD who had increased expression of innate 
immune genes also had decreased expression of adap-
tive immune genes, enabling the development of a single 
score to indicate immune dysregulation that could be 
used for patient selection89.

Studies  focusing  on  the  transcription  of  a  few, 
preselected  candidate  genes  have  reported  differ-
ential  expression  of  pro-inflammatory,  GR  and 
neuroplasticity-related genes97,119. Genome-wide stud-
ies may guide the deliberate selection of a small number 
of stable mRNAs — representative of key immune pro-
cesses, pathways and cell types — that can be assessed 
by qPCR-based assays; these may enable refinement of 
the immune compartments that should be prioritized 
for patient selection for an individual drug and/or its 
mechanism of action. For example, one study using this 
approach showed that patients with MDD who either 
were currently with depression and treatment resistant 
or currently with depression and drug-free could be 
differentiated by signatures of mRNA transcripts from 
healthy controls and drug-treated patients who had 
remitted during treatment97. These signatures putatively 
reflected inflammasome activation and glucocorticoid 
resistance. Moreover, a signature of the expression of six 
mRNAs (P2RX7, IL1B, IL6, TNF, CXCL12 and GR) dis-
tinguished patients who were antidepressant treatment 
resistant from those who were responsive. These data 
are similar to those from a longitudinal study in which 
drug-free patients with depression had increased mRNA 
levels of IL1B,  IL6,  TNF and FKBP5, together with 
reduced levels of GR. Furthermore, the pattern of mRNA 
expression of these and/or other inflammation-related 
genes predicted or correlated with responsiveness to 
antidepressant drug treatment119.

Beyond proteins and genes, another easily accessible 
snapshot of the state of the immune system is through 
immune cell counts. Individuals with depression have 
more white blood cells, more neutrophils, fewer T lym-
phocytes or B lymphocytes132, an increased neutrophil to 
lymphocyte ratio and an increased CD4+ to CD8+ T cell 
ratio relative to control individuals124–128. Depression 
may alter or result from altered CD4+ cell differentia-
tion, as individuals with MDD have fewer Treg cells, and 
more TH1 cells and TH17 cells than those without133–135 
(Fig. 1). In a recent study, based on absolute counts of 

14 blood cell types in patients with MDD, it was possi-
ble to identify subgroups of individuals with ‘inflamed 
depression’, characterized by increased myeloid (neutro-
phil, monocyte) or lymphoid cell (CD4+ T cell) counts, 
and correlated with increased levels of CRP and IL-6 and 
increased depression severity136.

Single-cell sequencing can advance our understand-
ing of the immune system at the cellular level, which may 
further elucidate key drivers of depressive symptoms and 
identify potential therapeutic targets. One study apply-
ing this approach in patients with bipolar disorder found 
remarkably robust biomarker abnormalities among 
mRNA transcripts measured specifically in monocytes. 
An inflammatory gene expression signature composed 
of these transcripts discriminated a large proportion of  
the patients as well as the offspring of parents with  
bipolar disorder from age-matched controls137.

The interplay between innate and adaptive systems 
modulates not only the protective immune response 
to microbial infection and other non-self-antigens 
but also the pathogenic generation of autoantibodies. 
For example, one study found that whereas patients 
with bipolar disorder showed both pro-inflammatory 
activation in monocytes and elevated percentages of 
anti-inflammatory T cells (specifically Treg cells), the 
two sets of abnormalities occurred independently from 
each other, and patients who manifested comorbid auto-
immune thyroid disease (which is common in bipolar 
disorder)  showed  fewer  anti-inflammatory  T  cells  
compared with patients without this condition138.

Furthermore, the potential for autoantibodies to play 
a pathogenic role in psychiatric syndromes has been seen 
in patients with autoimmune encephalitis resulting from 
autoantibodies against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptors139 or potassium channel complex proteins140,141. 
Although these antibodies are unlikely to drive symp-
toms in more than a small minority of patients, higher 
levels of overall autoantibody burden are seen among 
patients with depression and other psychiatric diseases 
compared with healthy patients, suggesting that this area 
merits further exploration as novel treatment options 
to regulate autoantibody levels become available142,143. 
Target-specific, rather than disease-specific, patient 
selection strategies may also emerge, and these could 
involve genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications, or 
even autoantibodies. The utility of the biomarker as a 
patient selection strategy, ultimately, will depend both 
on its predictive power and its prevalence within the 
population.

Phenotypes with diagnostic potential
Although no definitive standard exists to optimize 
the selection of patients with depression for immune- 
directed therapeutics, some patterns of common pheno-
typic traits in patients with elevated inflammatory 
markers are apparent within the more heterogeneous 
set of symptoms of MDD. Compelling evidence sug-
gests that inflammation may have effects specifically  
on anhedonia and the cognitive processing of rewarding 
stimuli rather than an equally weighted impact across 
all DSM-5 symptoms. Similar to depressed mood and 
anxiety,  anhedonia  is  observed  among  individuals 

 voluMe 21  | March 2022 | 237

0123456789();: Nature reviews | Drug DiscoveryReviews 
with a variety of psychiatric, neurological or primary 
inflammatory disorders144. Ultimately, a patient selec-
tion approach based on a clinical phenotype would be 
more widely accessible and economical than a biological 
measurement, if sufficiently accurate.

Evidence  suggesting  a  link  between  anhedonia, 
depression and the function of the mesolimbic dopa-
minergic circuits that underlie reward processing and 
motivated behaviour is converging across informatics, 
clinical and imaging studies. Inflammatory cytokines 
have been shown to exert a direct effect on mesolimbic  
dopamine  transmission  that  is  associated  with  a 
reduced willingness to expend effort for reward as well 
as with a reduced capacity for reward learning144. This 
effect, at least partly, involves a reduction in the avail-
ability of dopamine precursors, as neuroimaging and 
in vivo microdialysis studies in humans and/or non- 
human primates indicate that inflammatory cytokines  
such as IFNα reduce dopamine release in the ventral 
striatum, in association with depressive symptoms 
including anhedonia and psychomotor slowing113. In a non- 
human primate model, this effect could be reversed by 
administering the dopamine precursor, levodopa145.

By impacting motivated behaviour and psychomotor 
activity, the effects of inflammation on central dopamin-
ergic transmission may contribute to the reduction in 
physical activity observed in patients with depression, 
which increases the risk for developing obesity and 
associated metabolic disturbances. Obesity further 
drives systemic inflammation, as adipose tissue actively 
secretes cytokines and obesity is associated with changes 
in the adipocyte secretome that increases the produc-
tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines146. Notably, positive 
genetic correlations with body mass and Mendelian 
randomization analysis support the notion that body 
mass index (BMI) is causal or correlated with causal 
risk factors for depression24. Moreover, a longitudinal 
study of 3,809 adults without depression (age ≥50 years) 
found that participants with higher baseline levels of 
inflammatory markers were more likely to report low 
levels of physical activity 4 years later, and low activity 
partially mediated the relationship between systemic 
low-grade inflammation and subsequent depressive 
symptoms147. Interrupting the effects of inflammation 
on central dopaminergic pathways and physical activ-
ity via pharmacological and non-pharmacological (for 
example, exercise) approaches conceivably may reduce 
or prevent depressive symptoms and associated medical 
comorbidities.

A noteworthy study in this regard profiled drugs for 
their similarity across 4,201 side effects, and found that 
cytokine inhibitors were closest in the high-dimensional 
side effect space to drugs with a dopaminergic effect, 
but were distant from other antidepressants148. This find-
ing suggests that dopaminergic compounds that influ-
ence reward-guided behaviours may be more effective 
in patients with an inflammatory component to their 
depression. Clinically, this hypothesis was confirmed 
in the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression 
Outcomes (CO-MED) study149, which showed that with 
increasing CRP levels, SSRI monotherapy became less 
effective, and augmentation with the dopamine and 

norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, bupropion, became 
more effective150.

In clinical trials, IL-6 antagonists showed potential 
antidepressant activity in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (treated with sirukumab) and multicentric 
Castleman’s disease (treated with siltuximab), but nota-
bly these post hoc analyses relied upon a depressive 
symptom score which weighted anhedonia at 50%151. 
This may explain the findings in the sirukumab study 
in MDD discussed above58 in which significant improve-
ment was not observed on the HDRS-17 (of which only 1 
in 17 items assesses anhedonia) but benefit was observed 
on a scale that rated anhedonia severity (SHAPS).

Recently, in the NESDA study, the association of both 
basal and ex vivo LPS-stimulated inflammatory markers 
with individual depressive symptoms was explored in 
a large, longitudinal cohort. In both cases, inflamma-
tory markers were most strongly associated with ‘sick-
ness behaviour’ symptoms, including deficits in general 
interest and capacity for enjoying previously pleasura-
ble activities or stimuli (both of which are anhedonic  
symptoms), at up to a 9-year follow-up123.

Convergently, multimodal neuroimaging studies of 
inflammation-related changes in brain structure, func-
tion and biochemistry have implicated components of 
the mesolimbic reward circuitry, including increased 
haemodynamic activity in the subgenual ACC (sACC)22, 
increased levels of basal ganglia glutamate105, decreased 
cortico-striatal functional connectivity105, decreased 
striatal volume64, increased markers of inflammation 
in the insular cortex110 and microglial activation in 
the sACC and other regions79,101 in individuals with 
depression (Fig. 4).

Although, in principle, a symptom-based patient 
selection approach should be simpler than a biolog-
ical diagnostic, it remains unclear how patients with 
anhedonia and/or reward processing deficits can opti-
mally be selected for clinical trials. Measurement of 
anhedonia is imprecise, and the available rating scales 
variably address different aspects of this complex phe-
nomenon which includes deficits in motivation, con-
summatory pleasure and reward learning, taking into 
account both direct and indirect rewards152. New clin-
ical scales which address these challenges are under 
development and validation, such as the Dimensional 
Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS)152. As an alternative 
to symptom scales, functioning of the dopaminergic 
reward circuitry can be probed through cognitive test-
ing that uses reward-related tasks, which may provide a 
more specific metric for patient selection144. These are 
currently being tested and validated in human studies, 
with different tasks measuring distinct aspects of reward 
learning153,154. Furthermore, with emerging trends in the 
digital health sector, both cognitive tests and symptom 
assessments could be deployed as digital diagnostics to 
provide online platforms to screen large numbers of 
potential participants for trials of new agents focusing on  
anhedonia or other specific dimensions of depression.

Unmet clinical need
In  order  to  target  an  immune  subtype  of  MDD  as 
a viable strategy for drug development, this patient 

238 | March 2022 | voluMe 21 

0123456789();: www.nature.com/nrdReviewssubpopulation should be demonstrably underserved 
by current therapeutic options, and the introduction of 
a new therapeutic should result in fewer patients with 
depression.

The unmet need for patients with high inflamma-
tory burden has been demonstrated in several ways. 
For example, in the longitudinal NESDA study, patients 
with MDD recently starting an antidepressant and who 
had more than four indicators of chronic inflammation 
or metabolic dysregulation at baseline had a 6.85-fold 
(95% CI 1.95–24.06) increased odds of still having 
MDD at year 2 (reF.155). In addition, during antidepres-
sant treatment, higher pretreatment levels of inflam-
mation, as measured by levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF, 
were associated with a poorer response to first-line 
antidepressants2–4, and after treatment the patients 
who were non-responsive had deficits in the ability 
of anti-inflammatory cytokine release to restrain fur-
ther increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine release99. 
Furthermore, in longitudinal studies, patients with 
depression and who demonstrated suicidality had per-
sistently elevated levels of CSF and kynurenine pathway 
metabolites (such as quinolinic acid), and IL-6 levels 
were elevated in the CSF of individuals who attempted 
suicide and these levels correlated with the severity of 
depression and suicide ideation156–158. Finally, in vitro 
evidence shows that inflammatory cytokines change 
expression  of  the  tryptophan  metabolic  pathway 
enzymes and serotonin transporters, which conceivably 
may contribute to resistance to SSRI antidepressants159.
Beyond the impact of psychiatric symptoms on the 
morbidity and mortality associated with MDD, patients 
with depression also manifest a twofold to fourfold 
higher risk for cardiovascular disorders160, and have 
poorer outcomes during comorbid heart failure, stroke 
and peripheral artery disease161–163. Moreover, MDD 
is associated with exaggerated biological ageing: these 
individuals have premature decreases in leukocyte tel-
omere length (a marker of cellular age that predicts 
several ageing-related diseases and early mortality)  
and increases in senescence-related gene transcrip-
tion and molecular secretion patterns in physiological  
stress and inflammatory systems164–166. Dysregulation 
of the interactions among physiological stress systems 
that include inflammation, hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis hyperactivity and metabolic dysregulation 
may partly underlie these associations167–169. In addi-
tion, early life stress, a risk factor for MDD, is associ-
ated with high levels of inflammation170 and increased 
risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality171. 
Breaking these links could yield positive outcomes 
for patients beyond mental health. For example, met-
formin (a drug used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes)  
has  been  proposed  to  have  anti-senescence  effects 
by modulating intracellular pathways (such as those 
involving NF-κB and p53) that reduce the production 
of senescence-associated secretory proteins, including 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, and mitigate negative 
health outcomes in individuals who are overweight with 
depression165.

Moreover,  elevated  pro-inflammatory  cytokine 
levels, together with reactive oxygen species (ROS), 

putatively  leads  to  the  mitochondrial  dysfunction 
and  oxidative  metabolism  alterations  that  are  evi-
dent  in  many  patients  with  mood  disorders,  and 
which contribute to biological ageing172,173. Chronic 
oxi dative stress, characterized by elevated ROS and  
reactive nitrogen species and/or reduced glutathione 
levels, is a particularly consistent finding in patients 
with  bipolar  disorder  and  other  neuro psychiatric 
or  neuroimmune  disorders  that  are  associated 
with  elevated  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  levels172.  
Activation of microglia by pro-inflammatory cytokines 
in turn leads to further release of reactive oxygen inter-
mediates, pro-inflammatory cytokines, complement 
proteins and proteinases, driving a chronic inflam-
matory state that can trigger or maintain neurodegen-
erative processes174,175. Such processes may underlie 
progression in the cognitive impairment and morbidity 
in some people with bipolar disorder176. Elucidating the 
interactions between inflammation, oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired neuroplasti-
city may be critical for identifying therapeutic targets 
that prevent illness progression and improve outcomes. 
Non-pharmacological treatments also counter the effects 
of inflammation and oxidative stress in mood disorders; 
for example, exercise (running therapy) reduces oxida-
tive stress, inflammation, cortisol release and depressive 
symptoms, and has a beneficial impact on biological  
ageing (as measured by telomere length)177.

Among  the  unmet  psychiatric  needs  associated 
with biomarkers of inflammation113, anhedonia itself 
predicts antidepressant non-response, as observed in 
the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression 
(GENDEP)2 and the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives 
to Relieve Depression (STAR*D)178 studies. Beyond 
anhedonia, other clinical phenotypes have been asso-
ciated  with  different  aspects  of  inflammation.  For 
example,  in  patients  with  MDD  the  magnitude  of 
pro-inflammatory cytokine release in response to LPS 
challenge was significantly greater in patients who man-
ifested more severe anxiety symptoms, even though 
the basal levels of inflammatory cytokines were not  
associated with anxiety symptoms122.

Fatigue is associated with MDD and is a commonly 
comorbid  and  non-specific  symptom  in  primary 
immuno logical disorders. In a meta-analysis of immune 
trials for effects on depressive symptoms53, treatment 
effects  on  fatigue  did  not  remain  significant  after  
correction for concomitant improvement in primary 
illness. Changes in appetite in MDD have been mapped 
to the association between blood CRP and connectivity 
between the striatum and areas of the brain implicated 
in food hedonics179. Sleep changes have also been asso-
ciated with inflammation in MDD180. These symptoms 
are troubling for patients, so these dimensions may be 
useful both as stratification approaches and as outcome 
measures for trials of immune-based therapies.

A somewhat different example of unmet need is pro-
vided by the recent emergence of depression and related 
symptoms (fatigue, anxiety, mild cognitive impairment) 
as part of the ‘long COVID-19’ syndrome of physical 
and mental health disorders experienced by many 
patients following infection with SARS-CoV-2 (reF.181).

The  role  of  immune  mechanisms  in  causing  post- 
COVID-19 depressive syndromes remains to be elu-
cidated but is suggested by recent reports highlighting 
the association between MRI changes in brain structure 
and peripheral immune cell counts in patients follow-
ing discharge from hospital after treatment for severe 
COVID-19 (reF.182).

Ultimately,  the  development  and  adoption  of 
immune-targeted  therapeutics  for  depression  may 
disrupt the conventional, syndromic categorization of 
MDD and focus instead on transdiagnostic symptom 
dimensions, such as anhedonia, that may be particularly 
salient in some clinically defined subgroups of patients 
and  more  specifically  related  to  tractable  immune 
mechanisms113.

Additional considerations
Safety
In addition to addressing unmet medical need, new 
compounds targeting immune function to treat MDD 
will require a risk–benefit ratio that supports their dif-
ferentiation from alternative treatments, increasing the 
need to identify patient subpopulations most likely to 
benefit. For example, an increased risk of infections, 
including reactivation of latent tuberculosis and oppor-
tunistic infections, has been cited in association with 
TNF antagonism183. Depending on the safety profile for 
an immune-targeted therapeutic, patient pre-screening 
for specific infections may be warranted184. Nevertheless, 
such risks must be balanced against the potential benefit 
of helping patients with treatment-resistant depression, 
which is associated with higher morbidity and mortality 
rates than MDD generally185.

In addition, most antidepressants include a black box 
warning indicating they may increase the risk of sui-
cidal thinking in children and adolescents. Recently, the 
anti-IL-17 receptor mAb brodalumab was approved as 
a treatment for psoriasis with a warning that it has been 
linked to suicidal ideation186. Effects on suicidal ideation 
will need to be quantified for any new immune-targeted 
therapeutic in an at-risk population.

Treatment paradigms
Usually, novel therapeutics for MDD are clinically tested 
as adjunctive therapies to standard-of-care antidepres-
sants. The expectation is that they will augment the 
response to available antidepressant therapies, which 
often are partially beneficial even in those patients who 
have an inadequate response. Nevertheless, for any 
immune-targeted therapeutic in MDD, the interaction 
with SSRIs may or may not be synergistic, and treatment 
with both therapies may indeed be worse than mono-
therapy. For example, although patients with elevated 
inflammatory markers respond more poorly to SSRIs or 
serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors105, in the  
CO-MED trial150, patients with low CRP levels responded 
better to SSRIs alone than to a combination of bupropion 
and an SSRI, whereas in patients with higher CRP levels, 
the combination was superior to SSRIs alone. As another 
example, in a study testing the efficacy of infliximab 
as an adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant MDD, 
patients whose CRP levels were in the lower part of the 

range pretreatment showed greater improvement on 
adjunctive placebo than on adjunctive infliximab56.

The development of a monotherapy is often con-
sidered to be more challenging from a regulatory and 
reimbursement perspective. However, ultimately the 
path for a compound will be paved by data from RCTs. 
A compound could be approved as a monotherapy if a 
well-defined subpopulation has a high likelihood of not 
responding to currently available monotherapies, and 
a high likelihood of response to the novel therapeutic.

Sex differences
As is true for MDD, most autoimmune disorders are 
more prevalent in women than in men. Inherent bio-
logical differences between sexes also may impact the 
relationship between immunity and MDD.

In the NESDA study, men, but not women, who were 
with depression had significantly higher CRP and IL-6 
levels than healthy controls187. In a later study in the same 
cohort, IL-6 levels in patients with depression predicted a 
chronic course of depression in women, but not men18. In 
the EMBARC study, higher baseline CRP was predictive of 
poorer antidepressant therapy outcomes in women treated 
with the SSRI, sertraline, but this association was not 
observed in men188. In the GENDEP study, higher base-
line CRP levels correlated with greater depression severity, 
but the effect was only significant in women189. The extant 
data highlight the need for further research to elucidate 
the complex relationships between immune dysregulation, 
depression and sex, which presumably will reflect com-
plex interactions between endocrine, immune and neural 
function, along with lifestyle factors such as stress, diet 
and exercise. With the development of immune-targeted 
therapies for MDD, sex differences should be considered 
as they may play a role in the potential response rate and 
may be useful in patient selection strategies.

Outlook
Collectively, these data imply that immune mechanisms 
play a role in the pathophysiology of depressive symp-
toms for at least a subtype of patients with MDD and 
provide clues for the development of novel therapeutics 
and personalized medicine approaches in neuropsy-
chiatry. Ultimately, the goal is to improve treatment out-
comes by enabling patients with depressive episodes to 
achieve and maintain remission. Immune mechanisms 
could be promising because chronic inflammation is not 
unique to MDD but is found in patients with a variety 
of other medical conditions. Moreover, the immune 
system has a pathophysiological role in some other psy-
chiatric conditions (such as schizophrenia), as well as 
in neurodegenerative and other neurological disorders.  
As biology cuts across diagnostic boundaries, the devel-
opment of precision medicine approaches based on 
immune biomarkers may connect a medication to biolog-
ical deficits and/or psychological dimensions that span 
multiple DSM-5 categories. Such approaches also hold 
the potential to redefine diagnostic boundaries in psy-
chiatry, leading to a nosology based on pathophysiology  
rather than on symptom-based syndromes.
