Abstract: The purpose of this research was to verify, in a group of psychology students, whether
mindfulness training in conjunction with the individual’s level of self-regulation behavior would
produce a change in the use of coping strategies. A total of 38 students participated in this study,
with one experimental group and one control group, in a randomized controlled trial. Observation
of the experimental group revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in speciﬁc emotion-focused, negative
coping strategies (preparing for the worst, resigned acceptance, emotional venting, and isolation),
and a signiﬁcant increase in speciﬁc problem-focused, positive coping (positive reappraisal and
ﬁrmness, self-talk, help for action), in combination with students’ existing low-medium-high level of
self-regulation. The importance and usefulness of mindfulness techniques in Higher Education is
discussed, in conjunction with differences in university students’ level of self-regulation behavior.

1. Introduction

Within the sphere of psychology research that examines stress in academic environments, it is
especially important to analyze differences in the use of motivational-affective strategies. In recent
years, interest has expanded beyond understanding meta-cognitive strategies used while learning to
knowing how motivational-affective processes are regulated and how the latter affect and interact with
the former [1]. One example of this is the important role that is ascribed to students’ self-regulated
behavior and to the regulatory characteristics of the context.

1.1. Self-Regulation as a Meta-Behavioral Variable

The Theory of Self vs. Externally-Regulated Learning [2] considers Self-Regulation (SR) to be
a meta-behavioral skill that predicts numerous student behaviors; three possible behavior types
are established in interaction with the context (self-regulation, a-regulation, and dysregulation).
Previous research has described Self-Regulation as multidimensional, referring to one’s level of effort

in becoming actively engaged in behavior to accomplish a task. It is a psychological construct that
has acquired a great deal of research relevance, given its veriﬁed relationship to improvement of the
individual’s health, well-being, and academic, personal, and professional success [3–6]. Several studies
on personal self-regulation and psychological well-being have shown that students in higher education
with self-regulation skills experienced fewer problems with addictive behaviors (e.g., alcohol) than
those lacking self-regulation skills [7–9]. They also showed better social adaptation [10] and academic
achievement [11].

1.2. Mindfulness-Based Interventions

The term mindfulness can be used to describe a theoretical construct (mindfulness), a practice of
cultivating mindfulness (meditation), or a psychological process (being mindful) [12]. An often-cited
deﬁnition of mindfulness is “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present
moment, and nonjudgmentally” [13] (p. 4). Another frequent deﬁnition is “the nonjudgmental
observation of the ongoing stream of internal and external stimuli as they arise” [14] (p. 125).
Broadly conceptualized, mindfulness has been described as a kind of nonelaborative, nonjudgmental,
present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises in the attentional
ﬁeld is acknowledged and accepted as it is [15].

With the intent to develop an operational deﬁnition, Bishop et al. [15] proposed that mindfulness
encompasses two components: (1) self-regulation of attention, referring to non-elaborative observation
and awareness of sensations, thoughts, or feelings from moment to moment; and (2) adoption of
a particular orientation towards one’s experiences; a kind of attitude that one holds towards one’s
experience, speciﬁcally an attitude of curiosity, openness, and acceptance. From the mindfulness
perspective, acceptance refers to a willingness to let things be just as they are at the moment we become
aware of them and accepting pleasurable and painful experiences as they arise [12].

In the past three decades, a great number of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have become
increasingly popular (for a recent and exhaustive review see Creswell, 2017). Germer [12] proposed four
leading MBIs: (1) Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) [16], which has become the preferred treatment
for borderline personality disorder and is being used for affect regulation in general. Mindfulness
skills in DBT are considered core skills for success: interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and
tolerance of distress; (2) Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) [17], which is an 8- to 10-week
mindfulness training course with multiple applications to physical and mental health. The main
practices taught are sitting meditation (mindfulness breathing), mindful yoga, body scan meditation,
and mindfulness in everyday life, including walking, standing, and eating; (3) Mindfulness Based
Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) [18], which is an application of MBSR to cognitive therapy and depression,
and teaches patients to observe their thoughts. MBCT teaches the mindfulness practices of MBSR,
without the yoga, and with the three-minute breathing space exercise; (4) Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT) [19] encourages patients to accept, rather than control, unpleasant sensations. ACT uses
metaphors, paradoxes, experiential exercises, cognitive defusion techniques, and mindfulness.

In addition to these four MBIs, the recent mindfulness training program “Flow Meditation” (FM)
should also be noted [20–24]; its primary objective is not to try and control thoughts, sensations,
or feelings or to modify or change them, but conversely, to allow them to be free, accepting any private
event that might occur or emerge spontaneously. FM employs mindfulness breathing, body scan
meditation from MBSR, and metaphors and exercises from ACT.

MBIs have proven to be effective in psychological distress, physical health (e.g., chronic pain,
immune system, and many diseases and illnesses like cancer or ﬁbromyalgia), mental health (e.g.,
depression, anxiety, addiction), improving cognitive functioning (e.g., attention, concentration,
memory), emotional and behavioral regulation, well-being, quality of life, and interpersonal relations,
including healthy populations and individuals with mental disorders [25–27]. Extensive descriptions
of MBIs as well as their underlying mechanisms of change can be found elsewhere [14,28,29].

1.3. Coping Strategies as a Meta-Emotional Variable

Coping strategies refer to a constellation of strategies that healthy people apply in problem solving.
Several reviews indicate a strong association between the experience of stressors and the presence of
emotional and behavioral problems [30]. However, despite this evidence, it has been suggested that
psychological well-being and health are more inﬂuenced by the manner of coping with stress than by
the mere presence of difﬁcult situations [31,32].

According to the classic transactional model of coping proposed by Lazarus and Folkman [33],
distress occurs when a person perceives that environmental demands exceed their capacities and
available resources and, on this basis, they make an appraisal of the stressful factor, thereby determining
the level of stress that they experience. “Psychological stress is a particular relationship between the
person and the environment, that is appraised by the person as exceeding or taxing his or her resources
and endangering his or her well-being” [34] (p. 19).

Coping refers to “cognitive and behavioral efforts to master, reduce, or tolerate the internal
and/or external demands that are created by the stressful transaction” [33] (p. 843). Given the existing
diversity of responses to stress, most authors have tried to make signiﬁcant, meaningful categorizations
(e.g., active versus passive or avoidant coping). Lazarus and Folkman proposed that coping serves two
major functions. One is the regulation of emotions or distress that come with the stressful situation
(emotion-focused coping). The other is management of the problem that is causing the stress by
directly changing the elements of the stressful situation (problem-focused coping). Although both
forms of coping are used in most stressful encounters, they are nevertheless dependent on the way
one appraises the situation (i.e., as a threat and/or a challenge) and on its antecedents. Lazarus and
Folkman identiﬁed at least two broad categories of antecedents which will directly inﬂuence how
people appraise and cope with situations: those linked to characteristics of the individual, and those
linked to characteristics of the situation. In the ﬁrst category, for example, we ﬁnd commitments
(which deﬁne what is important to the person and, therefore, what is at stake in the situation), their
beliefs, such as beliefs about personal control, and so on. Among situational factors, we ﬁnd the
novelty vs. predictability of the situation, the uncertainty of the event, time factors (time generally
enhances the threat, however there may also be time to think something through), and the ambiguity
of the situation.

Strategies represent an effort toward modifying stressor factors, whether attributed to the
individual or the environment [35]. The ﬁrst group of such coping strategies comes under the umbrella
of problem solving or directly taking action to confront problems. The second group includes social
support, situational change, and psychological adjustment. A third group from the literature review
relates to emotional avoidance, an individual orientation toward giving up without struggling for
control of the conﬂictive situation, or just accepting with resignation.

1.4. Self-Regulation, Mindfulness and Coping Strategies

MBIs directly or indirectly include training in emotion regulation skills. In fact, the most important
therapeutic component of DBT is precisely its training in emotion regulation skills. In a less direct
manner, ACT, MBCT, MBSR and FM also incorporate the general objective of acquiring and exercising
emotion regulation skills, including development of more effective, healthier coping strategies.

Several studies show the beneﬁcial effects of mindfulness on different processes of emotion
regulation. Arch and Craske [36] showed that a group of participants who were instructed to practice
15 min of mindfulness breathing responded positively to neutral images, in comparison to two
other groups—one group who was instructed to not focus their attention, and another was induced
toward worry—who responded with negative emotional reactions. The authors suggest that focusing
attention on breathing acts as a key mindfulness mechanism for emotion regulation. Using a sample of
psychology students, Evans, Baer, and Segerstrom [37] found that mindfulness, particularly its facets of
not reacting and not condemning, led to increased persistence on laboratory tasks with a certain degree
of difﬁculty, through emotion self-regulation processes. More recently, Hülsheger, Alberts, Feinholdt,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 2230

4 of 20

and Lang [38], with a sample of workers from different organizations (hospitals, schools, shops, public
ofﬁces, etc.), found that mindfulness produced signiﬁcant increases in emotion regulation and job
satisfaction, and a decrease in emotional fatigue. Finally, Brockman, Ciarrochi, Parker, and Kashdan [39]
examined the effects of three emotion regulation strategies (emotion suppression, cognitive reappraisal,
and mindfulness) on the experience of daily negative and positive affect in college students.
Their results indicated that emotion suppression was related to higher negative and lower positive
affect, that cognitive reappraisal was associated with positive, but not negative affect, and that
mindfulness produced lower negative and higher positive affect.

As for coping strategies, research studies show that mindfulness promotes and improves the use of
a broad and varied range of positive coping strategies. Weinstein, Brown, and Ryan [40], with a sample
of psychology students, found that individuals with higher levels of mindfulness made more benign
attributions about stress, showed less use of avoidant coping, and greater use of approach coping.
Kang, Choi, and Ryu [41] examined the effectiveness of a stress coping program, based on mindfulness
meditation, on the stress, anxiety, and depression that was experienced by nursing students. Results
showed that participants in the experimental group made signiﬁcant improvements in adaptive coping
strategies and in the variables of stress and anxiety, however no effect was found on the variable
depression. More recently, Taylor et al. [42] examined several ways by which mindfulness reduced
teacher stress. In essence, results showed a trend for teachers from the experimental group to report
more adaptive strategies for coping with job stress and a tendency to evaluate challenging students in
a more positive affective light. Finally, Pidgeon and Pickett [43] examined differences in psychological
distress, mindfulness, and coping strategies (adaptive vs. maladaptive) in university students with
high and low levels of resilience. The results showed that the university students with a higher level of
resilience reported signiﬁcantly higher levels of mindfulness, greater use of adaptive coping strategies,
reduced maladaptive coping, and lower levels of psychological stress, when compared to students
with low resilience levels.

1.5. Objectives and Hypotheses

Despite plentiful prior knowledge of the strengths of mindfulness as a technique for emotion
regulation, there is still not a precise understanding of how it affects students differently according
to their different existing levels of personal self-regulation, in other words, if self-regulation is a
mediating variable in the effects of mindfulness treatment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to
determine how a training program in mindfulness interacts with university students’ prior levels of
self-regulation with the use of different types of stress coping strategies. Based on prior evidence and
the existing conceptual relationships, the following hypotheses were posed:

1.

In general, the students’ level of self-regulation would be interactive with mindfulness treatment.
Speciﬁcally, a greater level of prior personal self-regulation should be accompanied by lesser
use of inadequate emotion-focused strategies and an increase in adequate emotion-focused
strategies, as well as maintenance of problem-focused strategies. In contrast, students with a
lower level of self-regulation would increase their use of emotion-focused strategies, however
not problem-focused strategies.

2. More speciﬁcally, a signiﬁcant increase is expected in coping behaviors that are typical of
mindfulness, in accordance with students’ level of self-regulation and the treatment received.
Thus, it would seem plausible to ﬁnd that, with greater self-regulation, there would be a
decrease in strategies that represent a negative handling of emotion (suppressing feelings,
avoidance, and substance use), an increase in positive strategies for handling emotion (expressing
feelings, positive attitude), and a greater number of problem-focused strategies (help-seeking
and social support).

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Participants

The sample was composed of 38 students from the University of Almeria (Spain) who were
enrolled in the Faculty of Psychology; ages ranged from 18 to 29 years (M = 24.36; SD = 4.72).
The experimental group was formed of 19 students (2 male and 17 female), and the control group
contained another 19 students (3 male and 16 female). Subjects were assigned to one group or the
other on a random basis, controlling for the gender variable so that there would be a similar number
of men and women in both groups and, thus, avoiding possible interference from this variable in our
results. The variable of year in school was also controlled, such that there were a similar number of
students from different stages in their degree in each group to keep this variable from contaminating
the research results.

2.2. Instruments

Self-Regulation Questionnaire, SRQ [44]. The questionnaire used for this research was the
abridged version of the original questionnaire on self-regulation, which was developed by the
authors to measure self-regulation of behavior in general, deﬁned as what leads people to plan
and ﬂexibly address their own behavior according to the demands of the environment, through a
series of strategies [45]. Pichardo et al. [46] validated the Spanish Self-Regulation Questionnaire, Short
version, SSSRQ, a reduced version of 17 items on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5
(very much). Four dimensions were obtained by both exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis.
The conﬁrmatory factor analysis that was performed for this sample showed the four dimensions (Goal
setting, Perseverance, Decision-making, and Learning from mistakes). The authors reported a total
reliability value of alpha = 0.87, and subvalues for F1 (alpha = 0.81), F2 (alpha = 0.71), F3 (alpha = 0.76),
and F4 (alpha = 0.79), with adequate general values, despite having better adjustment in the case of
the female students. More recently, a revalidation using rasch methodology has been reported, with
similar, consistent results [31].

Coping Strategies Scale. The EEC [47] was used in a short, validated Spanish version,
EEC-Short [48]. Although the original instrument contained 90 items, the validation produced a
first-order structure of 64 items and a second order with 10 factors and two dimensions, both of them
significant, with adequate fit values in the latter case (Chi-square = 878.750; Degrees of freedom (77 − 34)
= 43, p < 0.001; NFI = 0.901; RFI = 0.945; IFI = 0.903, TLI = 0.951, CFI = 0.903, RMSEA= 0.07). Reliability
measurements are Cronbach alpha of 0.93 (complete scale), 0.93 (first half), and 0.90 (second half),
Spearman-Brown of 0.84, and Guttman of 0.80. Two dimensions were evaluated: D1—Emotion-focused
coping (0.95); D2—Problem-focused coping (0.91). In relation to emotion-focused strategies, the factors
were: F1—Avoidant distraction (0.79); F7—Reducing anxiety and avoidance (0.88); F8—Preparing for
the worst (0.80); F9—Emotional venting and isolation (0.91); and F10—Resigned acceptance (0.86).
In relation to problem-focused strategies, the factors were: F2—Seeking family help and counsel (0.92);
F5—Self-talk (0.82); F10—Positive reappraisal and firmness (0.87); F12—Communicating feelings and
social support (0.89); and F13—Seeking alternative reinforcements (0.80). See Chart 1.

2.3. Procedure

The entire experiment was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975,
revised in 2008. All participants also gave oral informed consent. Ethics approval was obtained from
the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Almería, Spain (UALBIO2018/020).

First, a course was made available to Psychology students at the University of Almeria (Spain),
entitled “Learning and practicing mindfulness”; this served to obtain a study sample. A total of 41
students enrolled in the course, of which 38 later became part of the research study. Students who
reported any prior experience with a meditation technique were not taken into account for this study.
Once the study sample was formed, the questionnaires were administered to all of the participants
for individual completion, thereby obtaining pretest measures for the dimensions of the variables
self-regulation and coping strategies. After the pretest score was obtained, subjects were randomly
assigned to the control group or experimental group.

Next, the intervention program was applied to the experimental group over 10 sessions (see
Chart 2), which were 1 1
2 h sessions that were held weekly. The intervention program consisted of
learning and practicing a mindfulness technique for 40 min each day [20,49]. Its main objective was not
to try to control one’s breathing, thoughts, physical sensations, or feelings, or to modify or exchange
them for others; on the contrary, it was to let them be free, accepting any private event that might
appear or spontaneously arise.

Note: Metaphors are types of analogies. An analogy is a comparison between two things to show their similarities
or relationship. Metaphors are used to help people get distance from their thoughts and play an important role in
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).

Mindfulness breathing is one of the main components of FM. This practice consists of mentally
repeating a nonsense word formed by three syllables, while directing attention toward the abdomen
and noticing how air goes in and out while breathing, however trying not to change or alter the
respiration itself. The objective is awareness of how it happens naturally and without effort. This way,
the mind becomes quiet, achieving a state of mental calm and elevated attention and concentration,
therefore decreasing automatic and involuntary activity [50].

The objective of FM is to be aware, passively and without effort, of what occurs in our mind and
our body, however without trying to make any effort to change or modify it, perceiving things as they
are and as they take place each moment. With practice, one develops the ability to observe mental
processes (e.g., thoughts, images) and emotional processes, but without getting involved in those
processes, and without analyzing them, judging, or controlling them, thus breaking the habit of being
led away by thoughts and emotions that are automatic and uncontrolled. In this way, we experience
how thoughts, physical sensations, and feelings are changing at every moment and are constantly in
ﬂow. In this way, one learns to be present, with an attitude of openness and acceptance in the face of
any mental, physical, or emotional process that might occur.

In each of the 10 sessions, besides learning and practicing the mindfulness technique, we made
use of different metaphors and exercises from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, ACT [19].
The objective of these metaphors and exercises was to comprehend and to experience that when we
try to control and/or eliminate bothersome and unpleasant private events (e.g., thoughts, feelings,
body sensations, etc.), they often increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, further aggravating
one’s psychological distress and suffering [51], and therefore, the best option in these cases is to become
aware of them, accept them just as they appear, and let them ﬂow freely.

Another component of the mindfulness program, which was also learned and practiced over
the 10 sessions, was body-scan exercises [17]. Body scan is a technique where attention is directed to
different parts of the body in an ordered, systematic manner, without making any kind of judgment
or appraisal, and without trying to change, control, or eliminate anything (e.g., body sensations,
mental and/or emotional reactions, etc.). Through this technique, the individual observes how body
sensations are continuously changing and learns to not react to them, thereby developing an attitude
of acceptance toward these sensations.

Once the mindfulness course was completed in the experimental group, both groups were
reassessed with regard to the different dimensions of coping strategies under the same conditions
as in the pretest phase. It should be noted that the pretest assessment took place in the month of
March, while the posttest assessment was carried out in June, coinciding with the university’s ﬁnal
exam period.

After the investigation was completed, mindfulness training was administered to the control
group. All of the study participants were informed regarding the research objective at the end of the
study and were asked to give their written consent to make use of the data collected, maintaining and
ensuring conﬁdentiality and anonymity.

2.4. Data Analysis

A randomized controlled trial was used to analyze the effects of personal self-regulation and
mindfulness treatment (IVs) on students’ coping strategies (DVs), where an experimental group and a
nonequivalent control group were compared using pre- and post-test measures. Using cluster analysis,
the independent variable personal self-regulation was manipulated by selection into high, medium,
and low levels. We carried out two Analyses of Variance, univariate and multivariate, Self-Regulation ×
Mindfulness Treatment × Time, to test the hypotheses, with the following dependent variables: (1) total
scores, (2) the two dimensions of coping strategies, and (3) speciﬁc coping behaviors. The software
package SPSS v. 23 (IBM, New York, NY, USA) was used for these analyses.

3. Results

3.1. Effect of Self-Regulation Level (SR) × Mindfulness Treatment (M) × Time (T) on Total Coping Strategies

The pertinent ANOVA showed a main effect with a signiﬁcant interaction of level of self-regulation
(SR) × Time (T) (F(2,70) = 4.133 (Pillai), p < 0.05, n2 = 0.123, observed power = 0.709). Thus,
while students with low self-regulation did not show a signiﬁcant increase in the total strategies
assessed at each moment, this increase was found in students with medium and high levels. There was
no statistically signiﬁcant main effect of mindfulness treatment on total coping strategies. See speciﬁc
results in Table 1 and the interaction effect in Figure 1.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 2230 8 of 21  2.4. Data Analysis A randomized controlled trial was used to analyze the effects of personal self-regulation and mindfulness treatment (IVs) on students’ coping strategies (DVs), where an experimental group and a nonequivalent control group were compared using pre- and post-test measures. Using cluster analysis, the independent variable personal self-regulation was manipulated by selection into high, medium, and low levels. We carried out two Analyses of Variance, univariate and multivariate, Self-Regulation × Mindfulness Treatment × Time, to test the hypotheses, with the following dependent variables: (1) total scores, (2) the two dimensions of coping strategies, and (3) specific coping behaviors. The software package SPSS v. 23 (IBM, New York, NY, USA) was used for these analyses. 3. Results 3.1. Effect of Self-Regulation Level (SR) × Mindfulness Treatment (M) × Time (T) on Total Coping Strategies The pertinent ANOVA showed a main effect with a significant interaction of level of self-regulation (SR) × Time (T) (F(2,70) = 4.133 (Pillai), p < 0.05, n2 = 0.123, observed power = 0.709). Thus, while students with low self-regulation did not show a significant increase in the total strategies assessed at each moment, this increase was found in students with medium and high levels. There was no statistically significant main effect of mindfulness treatment on total coping strategies. See specific results in Table 1 and the interaction effect in Figure 1. Table 1.

3.2. Effect of Self-Regulation Level (SR) × Mindfulness Treatment (M) × Time (T) on the Dimensions of
Coping Strategies

The multivariate analysis SR × M × T showed a signiﬁcant main effect of the factor Self-Regulation
Level (SR) (F(4,118) = 4.389, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.130; observed power = 0.927), with a signiﬁcant
partial effect on Dimension 1, emotion-focused coping (F(2,223) = 6.629 (Pillai), p < 0.01, n2 = 0.183;
power = 0.889; post-hoc: 1,2 > 3, p < 0.001). It also showed a main effect of the factor mindfulness
treatment (F(2,58) = 5.751, p < 0.06, n2 = 0.090; power = 0.542), with a signiﬁcant partial effect on
Dimension 2, problem-focused coping (F(1,70) = 3.3996, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.063; power = 669). Similarly,
a main effect of the factor Time was also observed (F(1,70) = 5.945, p < 0.01, n2 = 0.092; power = 0.669),
with a signiﬁcant partial effect on Dimension 2, problem-focused coping (F(1,70) = 3.3996, p < 0.05,
n2 = 0.063; power = 669). Finally, a statistically signiﬁcant main effect was also observed for the
interaction SR × M (F(4,118) = 2.173, p < 0.06, n2 = 0.069; power = 0.626), with a partial effect on
Dimension 1, emotion-focused coping (F(1,70) = 4.436, p < 0.01, n2 = 0.128; power = 0.732). Speciﬁc
values are presented in Table 2 and Figure 2. Note how the effect of mindfulness treatment was a
decrease in emotion-focused coping strategies in the group of students with low self-regulation, while
the medium group increased a bit, and the high group showed a decrease to the lowest level.

3.3. Effects of Self-Regulation Level × Mindfulness Treatment × Time on Factors of Emotion-focused Coping

The multivariate analysis of SR × M × T showed a signiﬁcant main effect of the factor
Self-Regulation Level (SR) (F(12,110) = 2.574, p < 0.01, n2 = 0.219; observed power = 0.967), with a

Effects of Self-Regulation Level × Mindfulness Treatment × Time on Problem-Focused Factors The multivariate analysis SR × M × T showed a nonsignificant main effect of Self-Regulation Level (SR) (F(10,118) = 0.696, p < 0.727, n2 = 0.056; observed power = 0.248), with no effect on any factor. A marginally significant main effect also appeared for Treatment (F(5,58) = 2.157, p < 0.07, n2 = 0.157; power = 0.668), with a significant partial effect on Factor 13, alternative reinforcement, in favor of the experimental group (F(1,73) = 8.513, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.121; power = 0.819). Similarly, a significant main effect appeared for the factor Time (F(5,58) = 2.412, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.172; power = 0.725), with a significant partial effect on Factor 5, self-talk (F(1,73) = 5.326, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.079; power = 0.623; time 2 > 1]. Finally, there was a significant interaction effect, M × T (F(5,58) = 2.476, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.176; power = 0.738], with a partial effect on Factor 5, self-talk (F(1,73) = 1.315, p < 0.01, n2 = 0.088; power = 0.675), as well as a significant interaction effect, SR × M × T (F(10,118) = 2.231, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.159; power = 0.902], with a partial effect on Factor 3, Actions directed at causes (F(2,62) = 3.861, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.111; power = 0.697), Factor 5, self-talk (F(2,62) = 4.138, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.118; power = 0.711), and Factor 10, positive reappraisal and firmness (F(2,62) = 6.867, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.181; power = 0.909).

3.5. Effects of Self-Regulation × Mindfulness Treatment × Time on Speciﬁc Coping Behaviors

The multivariate analysis Self-Regulation Level × Treatment × Time showed a signiﬁcant main
effect of Self-Regulation Level, SR (F(94,28) = 1.696, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.891, power = 0.952) and of Treatment
(F(47,13) = 5.427, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.952, power = 0.999). There were also signiﬁcant partial effects on
items of speciﬁc coping behaviors. In the case of emotion-focused coping, there was a signiﬁcant partial
effect on item 23 (F(2,70) = 3.129 (Pillai), p < 0.05, n2 = 0.090, power = 0.581), item 29 (F(2,70) = 3.408

and item 82 (F(2,62) = 3.318, p < 0.05, n2 = 0.101, power = 0.607). In problem-focused coping, there was
a signiﬁcant partial effect on item 20 (F(2,62) = 4.921, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.143, power = 0.897), item 36
(F(2,62) = 3.023, p < 0.056, n2 = 0.089, power = 0.586), and item 55 (F(2,62) = 3.730, p < 0.054, n2 = 0.107,

4. Discussion

These results suggest different analyses in light of the hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 suggested
that students’ level of self-regulation would be interactive with mindfulness treatment or, in other
words, that a higher level of self-regulation would be accompanied by a reduction in inadequate
emotion-based strategies, an increase in adequate strategies, and maintenance of problem-focused
strategies. In contrast, students with a lower level of self-regulation would increase their use of
emotion-focused strategies, but not problem-focused strategies.

This hypothesis was partially fulﬁlled. In the ﬁrst place, a crossed effect appeared, self-regulation
× time, for the total coping strategies score. This result shows that a greater number of coping strategies
were produced at Time 2, especially when subjects had a higher level of regulation, at a time that
they were facing greater stress and more behavioral requirements. We must remember that the second
assessment took place during the ﬁnal exam period in June. Moreover, this is consistent with prior
evidence that had already established relationships between level of self-regulation and number of
coping strategies used [52,53].

On the other hand, the evidence indicates that mindfulness treatment had no general effect
of increasing the total number of coping strategies used, only speciﬁc types of strategies. In fact,
the analysis by dimensions showed an interaction between level of self-regulation × mindfulness
treatment, offering evidence that, with lower levels of self-regulation, mindfulness treatment led to
a reduction in emotion-focused coping strategies. This result is consistent with prior evidence that
has repeatedly shown greater self-regulation to be associated with greater use of problem-focused
coping strategies and lesser use of emotion-focused strategies. Students who are more self-regulated
encounter fewer stressful experiences; consequently, fewer strategies need to be applied for stress
management [54,55].

More speciﬁcally, Hypothesis 2 expected a signiﬁcant increase in coping behaviors typical of
mindfulness, corresponding to students’ level of self-regulation and the treatment received. It seemed
plausible that, with greater self-regulation, there would be a decrease in negative emotion-focused
strategies (suppressing feelings, avoidance, and substance use), an increase in positive emotion-focused
strategies (expressing feelings, positive attitude), and a greater number of problem-focused strategies
(help-seeking and social support).

This result was corroborated in part, and differently according to the type of student. Students
with a low level of self-regulation—who have more negative emotional experiences—must invest more
effort and a greater number of emotion-focused coping strategies in order to manage stress [55,56].
This is veriﬁed more speciﬁcally in the factors referring to strategies of avoidant distraction and
emotional venting and isolation, which are signiﬁcantly reduced by mindfulness treatment in all
cases, especially so in students with low self-regulation. This result is consistent with prior research
reports [56].

The effects that are produced in problem-focused strategies have great interest because of the
crossed effect. Thus, while university students who had medium or high levels of self-regulation
increased their use of problem-focused strategies, students with low self-regulation reduced their use
of these (actions directed at the causes, and positive reappraisal and ﬁrmness), although all groups
signiﬁcantly increased their use of self-talk. In other words, students who were low in self-regulation
seemed to adopt a coping strategy of nonproductive effort, choosing to focus on better internal
messages, unlike the medium- and high-level students who increased all their strategies. To proceed in
this manner, while it may be adaptive in some cases, it does not appear to be a well-adjusted tendency;
it is more of a self-protecting strategy (self-regulating) for minimizing the negative emotional factor,
in which case it might be considered functional for the student.

Finally, analysis of discrete behaviors signiﬁcantly conﬁrms the hypothesis, because there
was a crossed effect of reduction in expected behaviors, in increasing proportion with lower
levels of self-regulation, for the behaviors of preparing for the worst, keeping feelings to oneself
(a-regulatory strategies) and drinking, smoking and isolating oneself, to cope with the problem

(dysregulatory strategies). This result is especially relevant for preventive intervention, because such
behaviors—characteristic of university students with low regulation—have already been revealed as
the link between academic stress and health problems [56]. On the other hand, the evidence shows
an increase in discrete, emotion-focused coping behaviors, typical of a positive approach to academic
problems, such as looking at problems in a positive light, not paying attention to negative feelings when
making a decision, and asking for help (self-regulating strategies). Prior evidence has revealed the
goodness of these behaviors for coping positively with problems of daily life, and they are constituents
of resilience [43,57].

This research study has several important limitations to be considered. On one hand, the sample
itself, including only university students, is one bias that should be recognized. On the other hand,
gender differences have not been addressed, although prior research has shown signiﬁcant differences
in use of coping strategies according to this variable [58]. Finally, students were not identiﬁed as being
self-regulatory, a-regulatory, or dysregulatory [2]. Consequently, these aspects should be analyzed in
future research in order to determine whether the effects that appeared here are invariable in nature.
In any case, the question for future research should not be whether this technique is effective or
not, but rather, what type of personalized, differential treatment in mindfulness is needed for each
type of student for economizing time and effort, having taken into account the different effects that are
found. Personalized treatment—suited to each person—should begin to ﬁnd its way into these types
of interventions, not unlike what is already common in other ﬁelds of healthcare intervention.

5. Conclusions

These results show a differential panorama of how students who are low-medium-high in
self-regulation beneﬁt from mindfulness. We observe that the low-level self-regulators showed a
reduction in the number of coping strategies, both maladjusted emotion-focused strategies and
well-adjusted problem-focused strategies, while the medium- and high-level self-regulators, especially,
are able to reduce inadequate emotion-focused strategies and increase problem-focused strategies.
Level of self-regulation may be considered to have a clear mediating or buffering effect on treatment
in the line of study referred to as person × treatment interaction [59] and of the Theory of Self- vs.
External-Regulation [2]. This evidence recommends the analysis of differential, interactive effects that
are produced by students’ level of self-regulation and the intervention program. Beyond the general
effects, it is essential to pay attention to the speciﬁc effects on each type of student in order to better
adjust the program to these characteristics.

In any event, these results further extend the already plentiful evidence that mindfulness as
a training technique contributes to substantial improvement in coping strategies, being in itself a
technique that makes many possibilities available to the subject for understanding and strategic
regulation of his or her emotional experiences [42,43,60–62].

With respect to the mechanisms or variables that are responsible for the changes that are produced
by MBIs, they may intervene positively in a variety of ways. For example, acceptance, exposure, and
emotional self-control are primary behavioral mechanisms for explaining the effects of mindfulness [14].
More recently, other mechanisms that have been proposed are psychological, emotional, and behavioral
ﬂexibility, neurological and physiological changes, or, for example, decentering, desautomatization,
and detachment processes. For more details, see [25,26]. These mechanisms help persons to be more
aware of their experiences and internal processes, to regulate their emotions, and to develop healthier,
more effective behaviors, thus producing more adaptive, positive coping strategies.
