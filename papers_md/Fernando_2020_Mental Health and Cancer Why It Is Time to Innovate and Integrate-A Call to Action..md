Surgical,  radio-oncological,  and  medical  anti-cancer  therapies  have  developed  at  pace  and
scale  in  recent  years,  yet  there  remains  a  huge  unmet  need  for  mental  health  in  cancer  care.
Recent  experience  in  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  added  to  recognition  of  this  unmet  need.
There  needs  to  be  more  effective  clinical  integration  of  relevant  services,  which  must  be
informed  by  patient  choice  and  clinical  need,  and  accessible  throughout  the  patient’s  whole
cancer  journey.  This  needs  to  be  accompanied  by  training  and  research  integration  as  well  as
more  effective  and  creative  use  of  technology  such  as  virtual  reality  and  simulation,  quality
assuring  apps,  and  mobile  technologies.  Finally,  as  a  clinical  community  we  need  to  drive  a
shift  in  culture  towards  measurement  of  patient  quality  of  life  as  a  marker  of  treatment
effectiveness.  We  also  need  to  support  our  own  clinical  workforce  with  their  own  mental
health  needs  so  that  we  prevent  the  alarming  rates  of  burnout  prevalent  among  clinicians
treating  cancer.  The  call  to  action  for  innovation  and  staff  support  has  been  ampliﬁed  by
experience  in  the  COVID-19  pandemic.
Patient  summary:  This  report  highlights  the  unmet  need  for  mental  health  in  cancer
care.  Patients  need  effective  access  to  psychological  support  and  mental  health  services
throughout  their  cancer  journey,  including  better  use  of  technology.  There  is  also  a  need
to  support  the  psychological  wellbeing  of  cancer  clinicians.

Introduction

The  past  few  years  have  seen  surgical,  radio-oncological,  and
medical  anticancer  therapies  develop  at  pace  and  scale.  There
has  been  growing  clamour  from  national  and  international
bodies  to  commit  to  effective  and  personalised  cancer  care.
Yet  despite  this,  the  unmet  need  for  mental  health  in  cancer,
and  its  impact  on  quality  of  life  (QoL)  remains  as  huge  as  ever.
Some  10%  of  patients  will  require  formal  psychological
and  mental  health  support  within  1  yr  of  being  diagnosed

with  cancer  [1].  Alarmingly,  73%  of  cancer  patients  with
depression  do  not  receive  potentially  effective  care  for
their  depression  [2].  Depression  is  under-recognised  and
undertreated  in  cancer  patients  at  all  stages  of  treatment.
Interestingly,  despite  more  people  living  with  and  beyond
cancer  than  dying  from  it  for  the  first  time  in  history,  78%  of
patients  who  have  finished  treatment  highlight  unmet
emotional  needs  [3].

The  case  for  urological  malignancies  is  compelling  to  say
literature  review  [4]  addresses  the

the  least.  A  recent

complex  relationship  between  prostate  cancer,  depression,
androgen  deprivation  therapy  (ADT),  erectile  dysfunction,
and  suicidal 
ideation.  The  psychological  and  cognitive
burdens  of  urological  radiotherapy  [5]  and  ADT  [6]  have
been  well  documented.

It  appears  that  despite  recent  developments  in  cancer
treatment,  many  of  which  have  improved  patient  survival,
the  clinical  community  has  been  rather  myopic  in  failing  to
adequately  consider  how  investing  in  the  mental  health  of
cancer  patients  can 
improve  patient  experience,  QoL,
functioning,  and  even  engagement.  This  involves  doing
things  differently,  namely  thinking  innovatively  and  more
effectively 
integrating  mental  health  and  psychological
wellbeing  into  routine  cancer  services.  It  is  worth  pointing
out  that  in  a  post-COVID-19  world,  in  which  access  to  some
cancer  specialist 
the
paradigms  of 
integration
are  even  more  important.  We  are  likely  to  see  more  late
effects  of  untreated  cancers,  including  neuropsychiatric
manifestations,  and  are  already  seeing  a  clear  increase  in
rates  of  anxiety  disorders  in  major  patient  groups,  including
cancer  patients.

treatments  has  been

impacted,

Effective  integration

Effective  clinical  integration  is  contingent  on  first  getting
the  right  clinical  services  involved,  and  then  embedding
these  services  effectively.

We  know  that  there  is  a  clinical  need  for  counselling,
specialist  psychology,  and  specialist  psychiatry  care  for  can-
cer  patients  [1],  so  it  is  important  that  a  comprehensive
psycho-oncology  service  includes  access  to  these  profes-
sionals,  ideally  with  a  single  point  of  access.  This  model
recognises  both  clinical  need  and  patient  choice.  Some
patients  may  prefer  counselling,  while  others  may  value
(more  structured)  psychological  therapy,  while  others  would
benefit  from  specialist  psychiatry,  particularly  if  there  are
issues  with  capacity,  treatment  engagement,  and  prescribing
of  psychotropic  medication,  noting  the  underestimated
nature  of  interactions  between  medical  anticancer  treat-
ments  and  psychotropic  medication.  Training  nurses  effec-
tively  can  provide  a  cost-effective  resource  in  cancer  care,  as
they  can  work  together  with  psychiatrists  [7].  Improving
access  to  mental  health  resources  for  cancer  patients  is
contingent  on  choice  and  patient  engagement,  and  clinicians
and  commissioners  should  actively  engage  their  patient
groups  in  service  development.  Integration  should  also  con-
sider  co-location  not  just  physically  but  also  in  terms  of
information  and  data.  Oncology  and  surgical  clinics,  ward
rounds  and  MDTs  providing  embedded  psychiatry  and  psy-
chology  should  become  the  norm,  taking  into  account  patient
choice,  with  clinicians  having  access  to  the  same  data-coding,
documentation  and  prescribing  systems.

Cancer  also 

impacts  carers  and  families,  often  with
regard  to  finances,  employment,  sexual  functioning,  and
relationships.  If  we  are  serious  about  improving  the  QoL  of
cancer  patients,  then  access  to  these  services  needs  to  be
widespread.

Patients  often  highlight  the  disparity  in  mental  health
resources  between  cancer  centres  and  elsewhere  in  the
pathway.  A  model  for  accessing  psycho-oncology  care
across  London  has  recently  been  published  [8].  Better  col-
laborative  working  between  primary  and  secondary  care  is
paramount  in  contributing  to  more  accessible  care.  This
need  also  exists  for  patients  facing  death  at  home  or  in
palliative  settings.  Dying  is  a  dynamic  process,  and  having  a
good  death  is  contingent  on  access  to  resources  focusing  on
psychological  support  and  mental  health  when  necessary,
especially  in  hospices  and  nursing  homes.  Co-location  of
services  also  offers  the  opportunity  of  better  QoL  data
collection.  The  tragic  burden  of  death  in  nursing  and  care
home  settings  in  the  UK  as  a  result  of  COVID-19  has
sharply  brought  this  into  focus  recently,  both  in  terms  of
provision  for  patients  and  family  and  with  regard  to  the  staff
providing  care.

Innovation

It  is  vital  that  cancer  services  innovate  beyond  the  clinical  in
terms  of  research  and  training.  The  author  and  colleagues
have  developed 
training
programmes  across  cancer,  including  for  clinicians  con-
cerned  with  communication  around  cancer,  mental  health
comorbidity  and  end  of  life  care.

simulation-based 

innovative 

The  literature  highlights  a  call  for  more  mental  health–
related  simulation  [9],  and  this  is  something  that  we  can
benefit  from  in  cancer  care.  Studies  have  demonstrated  the
utility  of  interprofessional  simulation  as  a  tool  for  improv-
ing  staff  confidence  and  knowledge  in  managing  comorbid
mental  and  physical  illness  [10].  Innovation  is  of  course  not
limited  to  simulation  training.  An  appraisal  of  the  literature
on  the  characteristics  of  technology-based  interventions  in
prostate  cancer  and  mental  health  has  highlighted  the  need
for  further  research  in  this  area  [11].

to 

systematically  evaluate  and 

Increasingly,  virtual  reality  is  being  utilised  to  enhance
patient  experience  at  the  end  of  life  and  to  improve  QoL  for
patients  with  anxiety  who  have  difficulty  undertaking
radio-oncological,  medical,  and  surgical  treatment.  It  is
important 
iteratively
improve  these  interventions.  In  addition,  improvements
in 
telemedicine  and  more  effective  use  of  mobile
technology  in,  for  example,  providing  electronic  cognitive
behavioural  therapy  for  cancer  patients  [12]  need  further
exploration.  We  know  that  until  recently,  across  healthcare
there  has  been  some  reluctance  for  clinicians  to  engage  and
advocate  for  the  use  of  app  technology  for  a  number  of
reasons;  however,  this  does  not  mean  that  with  better
quality  assurance  processes,  as  well  as  better  co-working
with  app  developers,  patients,  carers,  and  clinicians,  we
cannot  utilise  these  technologies  more  safely  and  effectively
in  monitoring,  for  example,  the  impact  a  treatment  has  on  a
patient’s  mood  or  functioning.  Indeed,  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic  has  thrust  upon  us  the  need  to  embrace  telemedicine
where  possible  [13],  and  it  is  likely  for  the  betterment  of  all
concerned  that  we  continue  to  move  forward  with  this
agenda  in  the  aftermath  of  the  pandemic.

Finally,  perhaps  the  clearest  call  to  action  accentuated  by
the  COVID-19  pandemic  is  that  there  is  little  point  in  advo-
cating  for  better  psychological  support  for  cancer  patients  if
we  are  unable  to  look  after  the  wellbeing  of  our  clinical
workforce.  It  is  well  known  that  the  demands  on  cancer
clinicians  lead  to  higher  rates  of  burnout  [14].  It  is  imperative
that  we  are  prepared  to  change  our  own  culture  by  having
safe,  reflective  spaces  where  clinicians  can  discuss  their  con-
cerns  in  an  empowering  and  not  stigmatising  manner,  similar
to  the  Balint  groups  used  in  psychiatry  training  schemes.  It
should  not  have  to  be  considered  innovative  to  highlight  that
staff  also  have  very  real  psychological  and  social  needs  that
require  attention,  especially  if  they  are  to  continue  to  provide
optimal  patient-centred  care.
