Abstract
Maternal exposure to childhood maltreatment (CM) is associated with offspring behavioral problems; however, little work has
examined these associations longitudinally across child development. This study examined the effects of maternal history of CM on
trajectories of child internalizing and externalizing behavior measured from toddlerhood to preschool, and the role of maternal
depressive symptoms and parenting behavior as potential mediators. Participants included 115 mother–child dyads recruited from a
hospital maternity ward. Maternal CM was measured at 3-months postpartum. At 18, 36, and 60 months, maternal depressive
symptoms and child behavior were assessed via maternal report and parenting behavior was assessed through direct observation.
Findings indicated that children of mothers exposed to CM demonstrated poorer trajectories of problem behavior across early
childhood. Maternal depressive symptoms mediated the relation between CM and children’s internalizing problems. Findings highlight
the importance of screening for maternal depressive symptoms and early intervention for maternal and child mental health.

Introduction

Emerging research on the intergenerational transmission of
trauma demonstrates that parental experiences of childhood
adversity are associated with compromised developmental
outcomes in offspring. Speciﬁcally, children of mothers ex-
posed to child maltreatment (CM),
including emotional,
physical, and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical ne-
glect, are at a greater risk for increased internalizing and
externalizing behavior problems in early childhood (Plant
et al., 2018). The intergenerational effects of CM may op-
erate by negatively inﬂuencing various aspects of the care-
giving context, such as parenting behavior (Collishaw et al.,
2007; Rijlaarsdam et al., 2014) and maternal mental health
(Choi et al., 2019; Plant et al., 2017). While this evidence base
is growing substantially, there is a notable gap, with few
studies examining associations between maternal history of
CM, trajectories of child problem behaviors, and relevant
mediators across various developmental stages.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the
effects of maternal exposure to CM on patterns of change in
internalizing and externalizing behavior measured from

toddlerhood to preschool. Furthermore, we investigated po-
tential
indirect effects of CM on child behavior through
maternal depressive symptoms and parenting behavior. The
study design and analyses are informed by the ecological-
translational model of child maltreatment, which describes the
interaction of several ecological contexts, including family

environment and ontogenetic development, that carry risk and
protective factors for the parent (Belsky, 1980). When risk
factors outweigh protective factors, dysfunctional parental
mood and behavior, and compromised child outcomes are
more likely to occur. Given that behavioral and social-
emotional difﬁculties in early childhood are risk factors for
impairment across multiple domains, including lower aca-
demic achievement (Turney & McLanahan, 2015) and future
psychopathology (Mesman & Koot, 2001), longitudinal in-
in understanding the pervasive
vestigations are important
effects of parental CM on offspring adjustment. Such research
can help inform approaches to intervention to reduce the long-
term consequences associated with the intergenerational
transmission of risk.

Maternal Child Maltreatment and Patterns
of Change in Child Behavioral Problems
Exposure to CM has a widespread inﬂuence on adult func-
tioning, including increased risk of physical and mental health
concerns (Norman et al., 2012). In addition, an emerging
literature provides evidence for the effects of CM across
generations. These effects are evident early and have been
shown across multiple domains of offspring development and
functioning, including low birth weight (Racine et al., 2018)
and insecure attachment (Berthelot et al., 2015). Notably, links
between maternal CM and internalizing and externalizing
difﬁculties in offspring have been demonstrated at various
ages across early childhood (Cooke et al., 2019; Madigan
et al., 2015; Pereira et al., 2018; Thomas-Argyriou et al., 2020)
through adolescence (Negriff et al., 2020). In a recent cross-
sectional study, child age (range = 1.5 to 18 years) did not
emerge as a signiﬁcant moderator in the relationship between
maternal CM and children’s problem behaviors, suggesting
that this association persists across development (Stepleton
et al., 2018). These ﬁndings highlight that maternal experi-
ences of CM may constitute a risk for offspring behavioral
problems. Despite the consistency of these cross-sectional
ﬁndings at various ages, signiﬁcant gaps remain regarding the
relation between maternal CM and longitudinal patterns of
change in internalizing and externalizing behavior across child
developmental stages.

Patterns of change in child behavioral problems during
sensitive developmental periods is important to model in order
to understand how maternal CM may be related to malad-
aptive trajectories in offspring. While externalizing behaviors
during toddlerhood are to some extent age-appropriate and
typically peak around 2 years, children experience normative
declines in these behaviors throughout early childhood (Fanti
and Henrich, 2010; Gilliom & Shaw, 2004) through the de-
regulation
velopment of adaptive skills and behavioral
(Campbell, 2002). In contrast, internalizing behaviors grad-
ually increase during this period, likely reﬂective of increased
cognition and improvements in the capacity to remember and
anticipate negative events (Fanti and Henrich, 2010; Gilliom

& Shaw, 2004). However, some children demonstrate per-
sistent externalizing problems or elevated trajectories of in-
ternalizing behavior across early childhood, which are
associated with a higher risk of adjustment problems in early
adolescence, including engagement in risky behaviors and
peer relationship difﬁculties (Fanti and Henrich, 2010; Sterba
et al., 2007). Predictors of such elevated symptomatology
include maternal psychopathology (Sterba et al., 2007) and
socioeconomic disadvantage (Fanti and Henrich, 2010). To
our knowledge, only one study to date has examined asso-
ciations between maternal childhood abuse and trajectories of
child behavior. Children whose mothers reported severe abuse
had a greater persistence of adjustment problems, including
conduct problems and emotional symptoms, between ages 4
and 7 years, in comparison to other children (Collishaw et al.,
2007). Further research is needed to understand how maternal
history of CM contribute to different patterns of child ex-
ternalizing and internalizing behavior, and whether parental
exposure to CM is related to the persistence or escalation of
symptoms overtime.

The Role of Maternal Depressive Symptoms

Maternal depressive symptoms may be an important medi-
ating factor in the intergenerational transmission of CM. The
associations between and adult mental health outcomes are
well established, with higher risk of a diagnosis of depression
and higher depression symptoms scores in individuals ex-
posed to CM (Humphreys et al., 2020). In addition, children of
mothers with depressive symptomatology have been shown to
display higher levels of internalizing and externalizing be-
havior (Goodman et al., 2011), likely through negative in-
ﬂuences on infant stress physiology (Khoury et al., 2016) and
the disruption of secure attachment (Atkinson et al., 2000). In
line with this evidence, maternal depressive symptomatology
has been identiﬁed as an important mediator in the relation
between maternal CM and child internalizing and external-
izing behavior (Choi et al., 2019; Cooke et al., 2019; Madigan
et al., 2015). For example, in a community sample, maternal
depressive symptoms partially mediated the association be-
tween maternal maltreatment history and child internalizing
and externalizing behavior at 5 years (Pereira et al., 2018).

The Role of Parenting Behavior

Maternal history of CM may also be linked to later child
outcomes through negative parenting practices. Caregivers
exposed to CM face challenges across different domains of
parenting behavior, including decreased sensitivity (Gonzalez
et al., 2012) and use of authoritarian or permissive parenting
(Leslie & Cook, 2015). A recent meta-analysis by Savage and
colleagues (2019) showed evidence for a small, but signiﬁcant
association between maternal history of maltreatment and
insensitive caregiving behavior. The impact of maternal CM
on parenting may be attributed to underlying inﬂuences on

256

Child Maltreatment 28(2)

parental stress physiology (Gonzalez et al., 2012) and at-
tachment (Gonzalez et al., 2009), which in turn, also under-
mine a parent’s capacity to sensitively attend and respond to
their child’s needs. Importantly, positive caregiving behavior
is also a strong predictor of healthy social and emotional
development in children. Longitudinal studies have demon-
strated links between insensitive parenting behavior and in-
ternalizing (Kok et al., 2013) and externalizing problems
(Halligan et al., 2013) in early childhood. Sensitive parenting
shapes the development of secure attachment and models
adaptive processes for regulating emotions (Halligan et al.,
2013; Madigan et al., 2015). Children are then less susceptible
to developing internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Ac-
cordingly, ﬁndings support an indirect pathway linking pa-
rental experiences of CM to offspring problem behaviors via
dysfunctional parenting processes, including maternal hos-
tility and harsh discipline (Collishaw et al., 2007; Rijlaarsdam
et al., 2014), although other studies have failed to ﬁnd such
evidence (Bosquet Enlow et al., 2016; Madigan et al., 2015).

The Current Study

Despite a growing body of literature on the intergenerational
effects of CM, a better understanding of the impact of maternal
history of CM on child behavior across various developmental
stages, and mechanisms that may underlie these associations,
is needed. Using a longitudinal approach, the objectives of the
current study are to (1) investigate whether maternal CM
predicts differences in patterns of change in child internalizing
and externalizing behavior from toddlerhood (18 months) to
preschool (60 months), and (2) test whether the associations
between maternal CM and child behavioral problems is
mediated by either maternal depressive symptoms or par-
enting behavior. Modeling associations between maternal CM
and trajectories of child behavioral problems, and the iden-
tiﬁcation of aspects of the caregiving environment that may be
implicated, can inform the development of preventative in-
terventions to mitigate the intergenerational effects of CM and
promote positive child development.

Methods

Design and Participants

Mothers and their children were part of a longitudinal study
focused on the effects of maternal cognitive function on
parenting and child development from birth to age 5 years.
Participants were recruited from the maternity ward at St.
Joseph’s Healthcare, Hamilton, Ontario. Study inclusion in-
cluded the following: (a) age 18 years or older at time of birth;
(b) gave birth to a full-term, healthy infant; (c) custody and
access of their infants at the time of home visits; and (d) able to
read, write, and speak English. Any barriers to completion of
research measures, such as severe disability were exclusion
criteria. Ethics approval was obtained by the McMaster

Research Ethics Board and the St. Joseph’s Healthcare
Hamilton Research Ethics Board. Visits took place between
May 2011 to January 2018, when children were approximately
3 (n = 141), 18 (n = 108), 36 (n = 96), and 60 months (n = 91)
of age.

Maternal age ranged from 19 to 43 years (M = 31.31, SD =
5.18) at recruitment. The majority of mothers were married or
living common law (92.5%) and were university educated
(56.2%). Child mean ages at each visit were as follows: visit
1: 4.03 (SD = 1.28), visit 2: 19.28 (SD = 1.32), visit 3: 39.79
(SD = 1.22), and visit 4: 61.81 (SD = 2.17) months. The
median household income ranged between $80,000–112,999
CAD. Fifty-four percent of children were female and 82.4%
were White. At each visit, dyads participated in a 2-hour home
assessment completed by two trained female research assis-
tants. At the ﬁrst visit, mothers retrospectively reported on
their history of childhood maltreatment. At 18, 36, and
60 months, mother–child interactions were videotaped, and
mothers completed questionnaires about
their depressive
symptoms and their child’s socioemotional functioning and
behavior (Harris et al., 2021).

Measures

Child Maltreatment. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
(CTQ; Bernstein & Fink, 1998) is a 28-item retrospective,
self-report questionnaire measuring exposure to maltreatment
before the age of 18, including ﬁve sub-types: emotional,
physical and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical ne-
glect, with higher total scores indicating greater severity of
trauma exposure. Standard cut-off scores deﬁne the severity of
exposure to each of the childhood maltreatment subtypes
ranging from none to low, moderate, or severe. The CTQ
has demonstrated strong psychometric properties (α = .96;
Paivio & Cramer, 2004). Participants received a score of “1”
for each type of maltreatment exposure (i.e., emotional,
physical and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical ne-
glect) based on low to moderate cut-offs from the CTQ.
Responses were summed for a total score ranging from 0 to 5.
Internal consistency in the present sample was high (Cron-
bach’s α = .91).

Child Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior. To assess child
behavior, mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist for
ages 1.5–5 years (CBCL/1.5–5; Achenbach and Rufﬂe, 2000),
consisting of 99 items representing parent perceptions of child
internalizing and externalizing behaviors within the preceding
2 months. The internalizing scale consists of four subscales:
emotionally reactive, anxious depressed, withdrawn, and
aggressive behaviors. The externalizing scale includes two
subscales: attention problems and aggressive behaviors. The
psychometric properties of
excellent
(Achenbach and Rufﬂe, 2000). In the current study, the CBCL
demonstrates good internal consistency at each time point for
internalizing (.77 ≥ Cronbach’s α ≤ .86) and externalizing

the CBCL are

Harris et al.

(.89 ≥ Cronbach’s α ≤ .92) scales. Total internalizing and
externalizing scores were used in the current study. Both
subscale scores can range from 20 to 80, with higher scores
indicating greater problematic child behaviors.

Parenting Behavior. Parenting behavior was measured through
videotaped interactions between the mother and child at 18,
36, and 60 months postpartum. At the 18-month visit, dyads
participated in a free play interaction (5 minutes), a “play with
toys” interaction in which a standardized set of toys were
provide (5 minutes), and then a “divided attention task” in
which mothers were asked to complete a short survey in the
presence of their infant (10 minutes). At the 36-month visit,
dyads were instructed to engage in a free play interaction
(4 minutes) followed by a challenging puzzle task (4 minutes)
and the divided attention task (4 minutes). At the 60-month
visit, dyads engaged in a free play interaction (5 minutes) and
then an Etch-a-Sketch task (Stevenson-Hinde & Shouldice,
1995). Mothers and their children were each assigned a knob
and instructed to use the Etch-a-Sketch to replicate two pic-
tures provided: two stacked rectangles (practice trial) and a
house (test trial). No set time for completion was given.

All videos were scored by four trained and certiﬁed coders
using the Emotional Availability (EA) Scales, fourth Edition
(Biringen et al., 2014), a measure of the emotional quality
of mother–child interactions. The EA Scales consist of
four caregiver dimensions: sensitivity, structuring, non-
intrusiveness, and nonhostility. Across all dimensions, scores
range from 1 to 7, with higher values reﬂect higher emotional
availability. The EA scales have been validated across a range
of child ages (infancy to middle childhood) and in low and
high-risk populations (Biringen et al., 2014). Interrater reli-
ability was established for 10% of the videos. Intraclass
correlation coefﬁcients (ICCs) for pairs of raters before dis-
crepancy resolution were .75 at 18 months, .75 at 36 months,
and .81 at 60 months. The four caregiver dimensions were
signiﬁcantly correlated (r > .35); therefore, a mean score was
computed as an indicator of parenting behavior at each time
point.

Maternal Depressive Symptoms. The Center for Epidemio-
logical Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale was used to assess
maternal depressive symptoms. The CES-D is a 20-item self-
report questionnaire designed to assess depressive symptoms
in the past 7 days (Radloff, 1977). Scores >16 indicate
clinically signiﬁcant levels of depression. The CES-D has
demonstrated strong psychometric properties in diverse
groups (Weinberg et al., 2001). In the present sample, the scale
demonstrated high internal consistency at each time point
(.88 ≥ Cronbach’s α ≤ .91).

Statistical Analyses

Missing Data. Participants missing child behavioral data at all
three time points were excluded from the analysis (n = 26).

Therefore, included participants were 115 mothers and their
children. Independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests
were run to assess whether participants included in analyses
differed from those not for several variables (i.e., maternal
CM, depressive symptoms, maternal age, and maternal edu-
cation). Participants included in the analysis did not differ
signiﬁcantly from those excluded. For included participants,
65% had child behavioral data for all three visits, 22% of
participants had data from two time points, and 13% had data
at one time point. Results indicated no signiﬁcant differences
between participants with data at all three time points and
those without in variables including maternal CM, depressive
symptoms, maternal age, maternal education, and household
income. Missing data at each wave of data collection ranged
from 0% to 6.59% for main study variables. Full-information
maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation was used to account
for missing data in analyses (Enders, 2010).

Growth Curve Analyses. To address our ﬁrst objective, multi-
level modeling (MLM) was used to model child internalizing
and externalizing behavior trajectories (Singer & Willett,
2003). Growth curves were estimated in Mplus 8 software
(Muth´en & Muth´en, 1998–2017). The time variable corre-
sponded to child age, in months. Observations at child age 18,
36, and 60 months were coded as 0, 18, and 42 months,
respectively, to set the starting point of the analysis to zero.
First, unconditional growth curves were estimated separately
for internalizing and externalizing behavior to identify sig-
niﬁcant variance in the intercept and slope (Model A). A linear
growth model, including ﬁxed and random linear time effects,
and a ﬁxed quadratic model were tested. A quadratic slope can
be tested with three time points; however, the variance of the
quadratic slope needs to be ﬁxed to zero (Hoffman, 2015).
Unconditional growth curve models were used to model
changes in child behavior overtime, on average, without in-
cluding confounding factors. Next, potential covariates, in-
cluding household income, maternal age, marital status,
number of siblings, and child sex, were added individually to
the model. Covariates that were signiﬁcant or approached
signiﬁcance (p < .10) and that improved the ﬁt of the model
were retained in order to control for variables related to out-
comes, while providing a parsimonious representation of
ﬁndings (Singer & Willett, 2003): Household income (sum of
mothers’ and partners’ salaries) and child sex (coded as 1 = male
and 0 = female). Externalizing behavior was included as a
covariate in the growth model of internalizing behavior, and
vice versa, to control for confounding effects. Then, maternal
CM was added to the model to examine effects on both intercept
(i.e., average level at 18 months) and slope (i.e., rate of change
overtime; Model B). Predictors were grand-mean centered (i.e.,
intercept represents the estimated initial status for an individual
with an average value for that predictor). Model ﬁt was assessed
by comparing Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and
Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) values between models,
with lower values indicative of better ﬁt.

Mediation Analyses. To address our second objective, multi-
level mediation analyses were conducted to investigate
whether patterns of parenting behavior and maternal de-
pressive symptoms mediated the association between maternal
CM and child behavior (Supplemental Figure 1). A 2→1→1
approach was employed, in which a Level-1 (time-varying)
variable mediates the effect of a Level-2 (time-invariant) vari-
able on time-varying outcomes (Krull & MacKinnon, 2001).
Estimates of the a pathways (i.e., relation between the inde-
pendent variable and the mediator), the c pathways (i.e., relation
between the independent variable and the outcome), and the ab
indirect pathways must occur at a between-person level, given
that the independent variable is constant within an individual.
Estimates of the b pathway (i.e., the relation between the mediator
and the outcome at level-1) were disaggregated into between- and
within-person effects (Krull & MacKinnon, 2001). Between-
person effects were assessed using time-averaged measures
(i.e., average level across assessment waves) that were grand-
mean centered and entered at Level-2, and focused on the effects
of CM on child behavior at age 60 months. Within-person effects
(i.e., within-person variations in the predictor across time) were
entered as person-mean centered predictors at Level-1. The
signiﬁcance of the ab pathway was tested by building 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CIs) in RMediation using the distribution of
the product method (Toﬁghi & MacKinnon, 2011).

Results

Descriptives and Correlations

Table 1 presents descriptives for the main variables. Only
13.1%, 10.4%, and 11.1% of mothers reported clinically
signiﬁcant levels of depressive symptoms, measured at 18, 36,
and 60 months postpartum, respectively. Few mothers re-
ported borderline or clinically elevated scores (T-scores ≥ 65;

Achenbach and Rufﬂe, 2000) on the CBCL. For internalizing
scores, 1.9%, 5.4%, and 10.0% children fell into at least the
borderline clinical range at child age 18, 36, and 60 months,
respectively. For externalizing scores, 1.9%, 5.4%, and 3.3%
children fell into at least the borderline clinical range at child
age 18, 36, and 60 months, respectively. Bivariate correlations
are included in Table 2. There was a signiﬁcant positive as-
sociation between maternal CM and depressive symptoms and
child internalizing and externalizing behavior. Positive par-
enting behavior was negatively correlated with internalizing
and externalizing difﬁculties. Thus, all condition perquisites to
the proposed mediation model were satisﬁed.

Growth Curve Analyses

Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior Growth Curves. The
intercepts of child internalizing (B = 44.81, p < .001) and
externalizing behavior (B = 48.42, p < .001) were signiﬁcant
(see Table 3, Model A). Random intercepts were retained and
indicated a signiﬁcant amount of between-person variation in
internalizing (σ2 = 54.65, p < .001) and externalizing behavior
(σ2 = 46.78, p < .001) at age 18 months. The best ﬁtting un-
conditional growth model for both was a ﬁxed quadratic model.
On average, internalizing behavior increased from age 18 to
60 months (B = .55, p < .001); however, the quadratic slope was
negative (B = (cid:1).01, p < .001), suggesting a deceleration in rate of
change over time. Similarly, on average, externalizing behavior
initially increased over time, as indicated by a signiﬁcant positive
linear slope (B = .29, p < .001); however, the quadratic slope was
negative (B = (cid:1).01, p < .001), suggesting a deceleration in rate of
change from age 18 to 60 months.

Maternal Child Maltreatment as a Predictor. As shown in Table
3, Model B, while there was no main effect of maternal CM on
internalizing behavior at child age (Fanti & Henrich, 2010;

18 months, there was a signiﬁcant interaction between CM
and time (linear component) (B = .15, p < .05), suggesting that
increase in the number of maternal CM is associated with an
accelerated increase in internalizing behavior problems over
time. To better describe this interaction, the intercept was re-
centered to child age 36 and 60 months to examine changes in
the strength of effects of CM on child internalizing behavior
across development. Results indicated that maternal CM was
signiﬁcantly associated with internalizing behavior at 36 (B =
2.26, p < .05) and 60 months (B = 2.37, p < .01; not shown in
Table 3). This association is depicted in Figure 1.

The effect of maternal CM on the intercept of externalizing
behavior was insigniﬁcant and positive (B = 1.60, p = .18) (see
Table 3, Model B). The maternal CM by time interaction was
also not signiﬁcant, indicating that CM was not associated

with a signiﬁcant increase or decrease in rate of change of
externalizing behavior. Re-centering the intercept showed that
the effects of maternal CM on externalizing behavior were in
the same direction at older child ages. However, these effects
were signiﬁcant at these time points, including child age 36
(B = 2.34, p < .05) and 60 months (B = 4.23, p < .001; not
shown in Table 3). This association is depicted in Figure 2.

Mediation Analyses

Maternal Depressive Symptoms. Maternal depressive symp-
toms mediated the association between maternal CM and
internalizing behavior. Maternal CM predicted higher levels of
depressive symptoms, measured at 18, 36, and 60 months
postpartum (Path a = 3.84, SE = .85, p < .001). At the between-
persons level, elevated symptoms of maternal depression were
related to higher levels of child internalizing problems at age

260

60 months (Path b = .33, SE = .13, p < .05). At the within-
persons level, elevated symptoms of maternal depression at
one time point were not signiﬁcantly associated with higher
levels of child internalizing problems at the same time point
(Path b = .07, SE = .07, p = .32. As a result, at the between-
persons level (but not the within-persons level), maternal
depressive symptoms mediated the relation between ma-
ternal CM and child internalizing behavior at 60 months
(Path ab = 1.27, SE = .47, 95% CI [.34, 2.20]). The direct
effect of maternal CM on internalizing behavior was not
signiﬁcant, after accounting for maternal depressive symptoms
(Path c= .17, SE = 1.07, p = .87). Maternal depressive
symptoms were not signiﬁcantly associated with levels of child
externalizing difﬁculties at the between- (Path b = .13, SE = .16,
p = .42) or within-persons (Path b = .03, SE = .07, p = .66) level.

Parenting Behavior. Maternal exposure to CM was associated
with lower levels of positive parenting behavior, measured at
18, 36, and 60 months postpartum (Path a = (cid:1).14, SE = .06,
p < .05), but the association between parenting behavior and
child internalizing difﬁculties was not signiﬁcant at the be-
tween- (Path b = (cid:1)2.16, SE = 1.31, p = .11) or within-persons
(Path b = 0.97, SE = 1.31, p = .30) level. Similarly, the relation
between parenting behavior and child externalizing behavior
was not signiﬁcant at the between- (Path b = (cid:1)1.71, SE = 1.08,
p = .11) or within-persons (Path b = 0.84, SE = .81, p = .12)
level. As such, parenting behavior was not a signiﬁcant
mediator for internalizing or externalizing behavior.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this current study is the ﬁrst study to
examine the inﬂuence of maternal CM on patterns of change in
child internalizing and externalizing difﬁculties. Children of
mothers exposed to CM demonstrated elevated levels of in-
ternalizing and externalizing behavior at age 36 and
60 months. Moreover, the association between maternal CM
and child internalizing behavior at age 60 months operated
indirectly through maternal depressive symptoms. Parenting
behavior did not emerge as a signiﬁcant mediator.

Consistent with typical developmental trajectories (Fanti
and Henrich, 2010; Gilliom & Shaw, 2004), an average in-
crease in internalizing behavior, and a decrease in external-
izing behavior was seen in children from toddlerhood (i.e.,
18 months) to the later preschool years (i.e., 5 years). Lon-
gitudinal analyses also showed that between-person differ-
ences in trajectories of child behavior were related to their
mother’s exposure to CM. Speciﬁcally, maternal CM was not
signiﬁcantly associated with internalizing or externalizing
behavior measured at 18 months. However, signiﬁcant pos-
itive associations emerged at age 3 and 5 years. These ﬁndings
are likely due to later onset ages for internalizing symptoms
(Liu et al., 2011). Furthermore, given the normative peak of
externalizing behaviors around 2 years (Fanti and Henrich,
2010; Gilliom & Shaw, 2004), signiﬁcant differences in

Change in Child Internalizing Behavior.

Change in Child Externalizing Behavior.

children of mothers exposed to CM may only be seen at later
ages, when normative declines in externalizing behavior
typically occur. While accumulating evidence suggests that
maternal CM is a risk factor for poor behavioral and social-
emotional functioning in offspring (Plant et al., 2018), little
prior research has addressed how maternal CM may inﬂuence
child behavior across development. These results are im-
portant as they suggest an enduring effect of CM on the
development of child problem behaviors, beginning at 3 years
and extending throughout the preschool period.

Maternal CM predicted elevated symptoms of maternal
depression, measured on average from 18 to 60 months
postpartum, which in turn, predicted higher levels of inter-
nalizing symptoms in children at 5 years. This pathway is
consistent with earlier ﬁndings that showed maternal de-
pressive symptoms is a mediator in the association between
maternal CM and increased risk of psychopathology in the
next generation (Choi et al., 2019; Cooke et al., 2019; Pereira
et al., 2018). Exposure to CM during childhood is linked to
physiological dysregulation,
including impaired stress re-
sponses (Shonkoff et al., 2012), that can lead to increased rates
of mental
illness in adulthood (Humphreys et al., 2020;
Norman et al., 2012). In turn, maternal depressive symptoms

may confer risk to the child through biological mechanisms
(e.g., shared genetic risk factors and stress physiology) and
environmental risk factors, including exposure to negative
maternal affect, cognitions, and behavior (Berens et al., 2017;
Goodman & Gotlib, 1999).

Importantly, the direct effect of maternal CM on inter-
nalizing behavior was no longer signiﬁcant after accounting
for the mediating role of maternal depressive symptoms,
suggesting that maternal mental health is an important
mechanism in the intergenerational transmission of CM to
offspring internalizing difﬁculties. In contrast, maternal de-
pressive symptoms was not a signiﬁcant predictor of child
externalizing behavior. While this conﬂicts with previous
ﬁndings that have identiﬁed relations between maternal de-
pression and child externalizing difﬁculties (Goodman et al.,
2011), externalizing behavior may be better predicted by other
forms of maternal mental health difﬁculties, such as maternal
substance use or antisocial behavior (Mesman et al., 2017;
Rhule et al., 2004).

Mothers exposed to CM demonstrated more negative
parenting practices, measured on average between 18 and
60 months postpartum. This ﬁnding is consistent with meta-
analytic ﬁndings linking maternal CM to various indices of
caregiving behavior (Savage et al., 2019) and suggests that
mothers exposed to CM are at a greater risk for parenting
difﬁculties. However, parenting behavior was not signiﬁcantly
associated with internalizing or externalizing difﬁculties in
children. While previous research has demonstrated modest
associations between sensitive parenting and child behavioral
problems (Kok et al., 2013; Halligan et al., 2013), other
studies have found non-signiﬁcant results (Bosquet Enlow
et al., 2016; Madigan et al., 2015). One possibility for a non-
signiﬁcant association may be that other aspects of caregiving,
such as harsh and potentially abusive forms of parenting, are
more predictive of child behavioral outcomes. For instance,
previous studies report that parental discipline (Rijlaarsdam
et al., 2014), and child maltreatment potential (Bosquet Enlow
et al., 2016) mediate relations between maternal CM and child
behavior. Future research is needed to investigate the role of
other forms of parenting behavior in the relationship between
maternal CM and child outcomes.

Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions

Despite important strengths, including a longitudinal design,
which allowed us to examine trajectories of child internalizing
and externalizing behavior across a sensitive developmental
period, several limitations should be noted. First, the majority
of study participants represent a relatively low sociodemo-
graphic risk sample (i.e., mostly married or in common-law
relationships, highly educated, and with a high household
income). Second, children’s internalizing and externalizing
behavior scores were primarily in the normative range. While
our ﬁndings are important as they demonstrate that inter-
generational effects of CM are evident in non-clinical samples

with sociodemographic advantages, generalizability of the
results may be limited. Future research should examine these
associations in socio-demographically diverse populations
and clinical samples as well. Furthermore, mothers retro-
spectively reported on their exposure to CM, which may result
in underreporting due to perceived stigma, recall bias, or other
factors affected by the mother’s current mental state. However,
such retrospective reports have been found to be valid mea-
sures (Karatekin & Hill, 2018). Additionally, maternal de-
pressive symptoms and child behavior were measured via
maternal report. Replication of ﬁndings using clinical inter-
views, observational measures, or multi-informant reports
(e.g., teacher and other caregivers) is important to control for
possible informant bias. Another limitation is the small sample
size (N = 115), emphasizing the need to replicate the results in
larger samples. Finally, no signiﬁcant mediators emerged in
the pathway between maternal CM and externalizing be-
havior, suggesting that other intermediary mechanisms may
account for this direct effect (e.g., social support and paternal
characteristics). These should be considered in future studies
to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the inter-
generational effects of CM.

Implications and Conclusions
In summary, our ﬁndings suggest that children of mothers
exposed to CM are at increased risk for elevated trajectories of
emotional and behavioral difﬁculties across early childhood.
In addition, maternal depressive symptoms may be an im-
portant mechanism through which maternal CM increases risk
of internalizing problems in the next generation. The present
study contributes to a growing body of evidence demon-
strating intergenerational effects of CM, and further suggests
that the associations between maternal CM and child behavior
are relatively enduring from toddlerhood to the preschool
period.

Our ﬁndings also highlight the importance of being alert
to depressive symptoms among mothers who experienced
CM in clinical settings (e.g., well-baby visits), and the value
of referral to early intervention for maternal depression to
interrupt intergenerational cascades of risk from parent to
child before maladaptive behavioral trajectories in children
are established. For example, psychotherapy for maternal
depression has been shown to improve offspring mental
health (Cuijpers et al., 2014). Continued investigation into
the associations between maternal CM and child behavioral
problems across various developmental stages is needed,
including the use of additional mediators and longer follow-
ups to determine whether these effects are persistent in older
children.
