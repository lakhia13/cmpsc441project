Infidelity in the Time of COVID-19

KRISTINA COOP GORDON*
ERICA A. MITCHELL*

Infidelity occurs in approximately 25% of marriages and is associated with various nega-
tive consequences for individuals (e.g., depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress), the
couple relationship (e.g., financial loss, increased conflict, and aggression), and the cou-
ple’s children (e.g., internalizing and externalizing behaviors). Infidelity is also one of the
most frequently cited reasons for divorce. The increased stress brought on by the pandemic
may be putting couples at an increased risk for experiencing infidelity, and data collected
during the pandemic have shown that people across the United States are engaging in
behaviors that are associated with a high likelihood of experiencing infidelity. The negative
consequences of infidelity are also likely to be exacerbated for couples during the pandemic
due to the intersection with the social, emotional, and financial consequences of COVID-
19. Furthermore, couples are likely to experience disruptions and delays to the affair recov-
ery process during the pandemic, which can negatively impact their ability to heal. There-
fore, recommendations for navigating affair recovery during the pandemic, including
adaptations for therapy, are also discussed.

Infidelity occurs in approximately 25% of all marriages (Allen et al., 2005; Laumann

et al., 1994). Infidelity is described in the literature as an emotional or sexual act that is
outside of the primary relationship and constitutes a breach of trust or agreed upon
boundaries of that relationship (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). Experiencing infidelity is associ-
ated with various devastating consequences for both partners and for the relationship.
Individuals may experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress
disorder (Cano & O’Leary, 2000; Couch et al., 2017; Gordon et al., 2004). Couples will often
experience significant financial loss when infidelity occurs, which is exacerbated even fur-
ther for those who get divorced (Crouch & Dickies, 2016). It also negatively impacts the
couple relationship through decreases in sexual desire, frequency, and satisfaction, along
with overall happiness (Grov et al., 2011; Manning, 2006; Previti & Amato, 2004). In addi-
tion, infidelity is associated with increased conflict and a tendency toward aggressive
behaviors, which can escalate into intimate partner violence (Nemeth et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2012). It is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for divorce with one in five
couples that experience infidelity identifying it as the primary cause of the dissolution of
their relationship (Amato & Previti, 2003).

Furthermore, the impact on the couple can have far-reaching effects on their children.
Increased exposure to parental conflict can trigger internalizing behaviors, such as anxi-
ety and depression, and externalizing behaviors in children (Ablow et al., 2009). In

addition, research supports an intergenerational pattern of infidelity within families, such
that individuals that experience parental infidelity during childhood are more likely to be
in romantic relationships in adulthood that are plagued by infidelity (Hunyady et al.,
2008; Lusterman, 2005; Platt et al., 2008), further perpetuating the cycle and its associ-
ated consequences for future generations.

This significant dyadic problem is likely to be exacerbated by the effects of COVID-19,
and couples’ recovery processes are similarly likely to be delayed or negatively impacted
by the pandemic and its attendant social, emotional, and economic fallout. This paper lays
out the various ways in which COVID-19 intersects with normal risks of affairs and the
recovery process and provides recommendations for how to address these complications.

COVID-19 AND THE INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF AFFAIRS

The current pandemic may be putting couples at increased risk for experiencing infi-
delity. While we do not yet have definitive statistics on the rates of infidelity in this era,
studies show that individuals across the United States are experiencing significantly high
levels of stress in response to the pandemic, which is common during an infectious disease
outbreak like this one (CDC, 2020). One survey found that 69% of employees have identi-
fied the current pandemic as the most stressful time in their career (Mayer, 2020). Accord-
ing to Bodenmann (2005), dyadic stress is defined as a stressful event that impacts both
partners, either directly through encountering the same stressful event or indirectly when
the stress of one partner spills over into the relationship, both of which are likely happen-
ing with the current pandemic. Research has consistently found increases in stress to be
associated with decreases in both sexual and relationship satisfaction (Bodenmann et al.,
2007; Harper et al., 2000; Neff & Karney, 2004). Relationship satisfaction is a powerful
predictor of infidelity such that individuals in highly satisfied relationships are less likely
to have an affair (Atkins et al., 2001; McAlister et al., 2005; Previti & Amato, 2004; Shaw
et al., 2013), and a lack of relationship satisfaction is a common justification for individu-
als who have affairs (Emmers-Sommer et al., 2010). Furthermore, individuals who report
feeling sexually satisfied in their relationships are less likely to have an affair (Allen
et al., 2005; Waite & Joyner, 2001). Individuals who are dissatisfied in their current rela-
tionship are more likely to explore alternative options and the increased stress from the
pandemic may be contributing to more negative perceptions for individuals of both their
partner and their relationship.

While prior research supports the theory that couples are at a higher risk of infidelity
due to the pandemic, it is also important to acknowledge that the methods of contact for
affairs may be different than they were before. The recommendations around social dis-
tancing have decreased the opportunities for physical contact with affair partners, such as
not going to the gym, not going to work. However, the use of virtual apps to stay connected
(e.g., Face Time, Zoom, and Skype) has drastically increased during this time (Warren,
2020) and may be more likely to be used for contact with affair partners than prior to the
pandemic. Current research also provides supporting data for the increased risk of infi-
delity occurring through virtual means during this time. For example, a dating site for
married individuals has been adding 17,000 new members per day during the pandemic,
which is an increase of 1,500 new members per day from 2019. Data show that individuals
are accessing this dating site for a variety of reasons including the desire to chat with
someone besides their spouse, the need for emotional validation, or the fantasy of pursuing
a secret sexual relationship (Takahashi, 2020). The current regulations around social dis-
tancing may make a dating site such as this one an optimal outlet for individuals to pur-
sue extradyadic connections. Researchers at The Kinsey Institute are also studying how
the pandemic is affecting intimate relationships. Findings show that about 20% of people

Fam. Proc., Vol. 59, September, 2020

FAMILY PROCESS

have contacted an ex-partner at some point during the pandemic with about half reporting
that they have reached out to multiple ex-partners. About 25% of participants reported
being contacted by an ex-partner and of that group most reported that they replied to their
ex-partner. Of those in committed relationships, about 13% said that they have reached
out to an ex-partner during the pandemic. Follow-up data demonstrated various reasons
for connecting with an ex-partner including checking to see how their ex-partner was cop-
ing with the pandemic, feeling lonely or bored, looking to have sex or hook-up, checking on
their ex-partner’s relationship status, or out of a desire to rekindle a relationship with
their ex-partner. Participants in committed relationships identified looking for a hook-up
or wanting to rekindle the relationship as the primary reasons for the contact, both of
which indicate an increased likelihood of engaging in infidelity (Lehmiller, 2020).

INCREASED CONSEQUENCES OF AFFAIRS DUE TO COVID-19

Given that the data are trending toward an increased risk of infidelity for couples, and
couples are spending more time together than ever before, it is also reasonable that affairs
will be discovered at higher rates during this time. Whether discovered during or right
before the pandemic occurred, it is important to consider how the consequences of affairs
have changed as a result of the pandemic. The discovery of an affair is a devastating event
and couples experiencing the aftermath of an affair during the pandemic may be at
greater risk for negative consequences. The pandemic is taking a significant toll on the
psychological health of individuals around the country. In a recent poll by the Kaiser Fam-
ily Foundation, 45% of adults reported that the pandemic has had a negative impact on
their mental health due to increases in anxiety and stress about the virus (Panchal et al.,
2020). In the aftermath of an affair, research shows that individuals experience the onset
of symptoms of anxiety and depression (Cano & O’Leary, 2000; Couch et al., 2017), which
may be exacerbated due to the current pandemic. In addition, the pandemic has had a sig-
nificant financial impact on families. In a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, 43%
of adults reported that they or someone in their household has lost a job or taken a pay cut
during the pandemic (Parker et al., 2020). Significant financial loss is also a common con-
sequence of infidelity (Crouch & Dickies, 2016), putting these couples at even greater risk
for financial insecurity during this time. Furthermore, circumstances like unemployment,
lack of social support, and increased stress that are commonly experienced during a pan-
demic have been identified as risk factors for interpersonal violence (Serrata & Hurtado
Alvarado, 2019; Zahran et al., 2009) and data from other countries impacted by COVID-
19, such as China, France, Brazil, and Italy, have reported up to a 50% increase in reports
of domestic violence during the pandemic (Campbell, 2020). These trends are alarming for
couples in the aftermath of an affair, as they are already at higher risk for increases in
conflict, aggressive behaviors, and intimate partner violence, as consequences of the affair
(Nemeth et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012).

COVID-19’S IMPACT ON AFFAIR RECOVERY

Couples may also experience more difficulties in recovering from an affair during this
time. The pandemic has limited couple’s access to resources and social support, which may
make it more difficult for them to cope with this significant stressor (Abrahamson et al.,
2012; Gordon et al., 2004; Olson et al., 2002). In addition, couples are experiencing
increases in anxiety and stress related to the virus as well as financial concerns (Panchal
et al., 2020; Parker et al., 2020), which are requiring mental and emotional energy, conse-
quently leaving less capacity to focus on and deal constructively with affair recovery.

Further, the practices supported by research and recommended for couples during affair
recovery may be more difficult to achieve during this time of social isolation.

Heightened Arousal

Similarly to symptoms experienced after a trauma, couples in the aftermath of an affair
experience heightened anxiety and increased emotional arousal, both of which can impede
the affair recovery process (Gordon et al., 2004). Research shows that 86% of people have
experienced trauma symptomatology in response to the pandemic (Case Western Reserve
University, 2020) and these kinds of negative impacts on psychological health are linked
to heightened levels of anxiety and stress about the pandemic (Panchal et al., 2020).
Heightened emotional arousal resulting from both the pandemic and the affair may make
it more difficult for couples to effectively regulate their emotions during this time. This
can inhibit the healing process as both partners are low on emotional resources at a time
when they are needed most, are feeling more irritable than usual and due to their close
proximity, and may be more likely to lash out at their partners (Weiner-Davis, 2020).

Increased Time Together

The stay-at-home regulations in response to the pandemic can mean that couples are
spending more time together than usual and also have limited options for taking a break
from one another. After the discovery of an affair, many couples will take a break from
each other ranging from spending more time apart to one partner moving out of the house
for a period of time (Abrahamson et al., 2012; Olson et al., 2002). This separation can pro-
vide both partners with time alone to think and reflect and can be helpful for healing.
While some couples stay in contact during this time of separation, the conversation is usu-
ally focused on necessary topics (e.g., arrangements for the children, getting bills paid)
and provides them with protected time to not talk about the affair (Olson et al., 2002). The
current pandemic has made spending time apart much more difficult for couples to
achieve, not only potentially hindering the process of recovery, but forcing partners to con-
sistently be in close proximity to one another increases reminders of the affair (Weiner-
Davis, 2020). While communication is an important part of the healing process (Olson
et al., 2002; Timm & Blow, 2018), constantly discussing the affair and the details of the
extradyadic relationship may be more harmful than helpful to healing (Fife et al., 2013).
However, there is a natural tendency for the injured partner (i.e., the partner who did not
have the affair) to be overwhelmingly curious about the details of the affair and to request
this information from his/her partner (Gordon & Baucom, 1998; Weeks & Treat, 2001). A
lack of time apart may lead to conversations about the affair occurring before both part-
ners feel emotionally ready to do so and consequently may result in the sharing of infor-
mation about the affair that is ultimately damaging to the healing process.

Lack of Privacy

Infidelity is a much stigmatized phenomenon and carries a lot of social shame for cou-
ples who experience it. Responses to infidelity are plagued by intense and overwhelming
emotions such as shock, anger, hurt, and despair, often resulting in yelling and the desire
to distance from one another (Abrahamson et al., 2012). These intense emotions need
space and time to be expressed and processed, which is more difficult for couples who have
children in the home because they fear that their children will overhear them (Weiner-
Davis, 2020). Research highlights the importance of protecting children from the negative
consequences of parental infidelity (Negash & Morgan, 2016), leading many couples to
desire to keep the affair a secret, which may be more difficult to do during the pandemic.

Fam. Proc., Vol. 59, September, 2020

FAMILY PROCESS

In addition, the common ways that they would get alone time and space from their partner
(e.g., going to work, going to a friend’s house) without drawing their children’s attention to
it are more limited and couples may be forced to spend more time together or risk disclos-
ing their marital struggles to their children (Weiner-Davis, 2020). Furthermore, the risk
of accidental disclosure may be higher during this time as children are more likely to over-
hear their parents’ conversations as parents are being forced to have more of these conver-
sations within earshot of their children than prior to the pandemic.

Rebuilding Trust

An important component of the recovery process is the rebuilding of the trust that was
lost as a result of the affair (Abrahamson et al., 2012; Bird et al., 2007; Fife et al., 2013;
Gordon et al., 2004; Olson et al., 2002). The process of rebuilding trust is slow, takes a lot
of conscious effort from both partners, and often is not linear (Abrahamson et al., 2012;
Gordon et al., 2004; Olson et al., 2002). Involved partners (i.e., the partner who had the
affair) will often demonstrate their trustworthiness in a variety of ways to begin rebuild-
ing trust in the relationship. In order to start the rebuilding process, the involved partner
must agree to stop seeing the affair partner and put boundaries in place to avoid acciden-
tally coming into contact with that person (Fife et al., 2013; Gordon et al., 2004). For exam-
ple, the involved partner will go to a different gym if the affair partner exercises at the
same one. In some cases, avoiding contact with the affair partner requires a more signifi-
cant change of circumstances such as switching jobs, if the affair partner was a co-worker.
Even with taking these additional measures, the involved partner may unexpectedly come
into contact with the affair partner, and should tell their partner immediately in order to
continue to build trust (Fife et al., 2013). When leaving the house for leisure purposes, the
involved partner may also need to put additional measures in place to help their partner
feel secure about their whereabouts and behaviors, such as taking the kids with him/her
to the grocery store (Olson et al., 2002). The current pandemic has altered the ways in
which couples are able to work on rebuilding trust as some of the strategies that were
helpful before (e.g., taking kids to run errands) may not be feasible or advisable now. On
the one hand, the drastic decrease in social contact with people outside of the home may
be helpful for injured partners to begin rebuilding trust as they have more reassurance
that the involved partner is not coming into physical contact with the affair partner (Wei-
ner-Davis, 2020). However, this does not eliminate other forms of virtual contact for which
couples will still need to work together in order to put boundaries in place. Furthermore,
the boundaries that couples would ideally set up at the start of the recovery process
around physical contact with the affair partner are likely not being put into practice dur-
ing this time. However, at some point, when the restrictions around COVID-19 are lifted,
couples will be forced to encounter these challenges and establish boundaries around
these, which may feel like they are going backwards in the recovery process. The need to
go back to the basics of building trust around physical encounters could be prohibitive to
the couple’s overall process of recovery.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEALING WITH INFIDELITY DURING COVID-19

The foundation of making it through affair recovery during COVID-19 starts with emo-
tional regulation skills. While emotional regulation skills are always an important compo-
nent of affair recovery, couples also need to understand that many experts are considering
the uncertainty around COVID-19 to be akin to a chronic trauma, and as a result, it can
also impair executive functioning, such as memory, concentration and ability to inhibit
impulses. The increased uncertainty and feelings of anxiety surrounding the pandemic

www.FamilyProcess.org

COOP GORDON & MITCHELL

/ 961

may make it more difficult for individuals to regulate their emotions during this time, and
therefore more important that couples focus on implementing emotion regulation strate-
gies during recovery. We also recommend that couples acknowledge these increased diffi-
culties and attempt to give themselves and each other more “grace” for mistakes and
strong reactions during this time.

Couples should take steps to address their heightened arousal both individually and as
a dyad. Individuals’ efforts at prevention might best take the form of managing their own
reactions to stressors stemming from COVID-19 while also making efforts to maintain
and improve connection with their partners to increase their relationship’s resilience to
these stressors. There are a number of effective emotional regulation strategies that cou-
ples can employ to manage their increased stress in response to both the pandemic and
the affair. First, naming and acknowledging feelings of anxiety, dread, sadness, and other
vulnerable emotions is an important first step in managing these feelings (e.g., Linehan,
2015). Second, linking these feelings to situations and evaluating which parts of these sit-
uations can be addressed and which require acceptance allows individuals to reclaim some
sense of predictability and control over events, while also helping to recognize areas where
they might need to practice acceptance of uncertainty and lack of control (e.g., Linehan,
2015). For example, injured partners may acknowledge the dread that they feel when
thinking about the regulations being lifted and their partner going back to work, as this
will erase some of the comfort that they have felt with their partner always being home.
While they do not have control around if and when their partner goes back to work, they
do have control over how they choose to handle that as a couple. Third, self-care routines
such as exercise, eating well, getting enough sleep, and building in supportive social con-
tact with friends who will not take sides also help individuals create the internal resources
to cope with these heightened stressors (e.g., Snyder et al., 2007). During the pandemic,
individuals may need to be more creative about the ways that they are receiving this social
support, as it is much harder to get space and time away from their partner (and children).
For example, individuals may find that having these conversations with others works best
from the car or in a private room after their children have gone to bed, or perhaps with
proper precautions they may even be able to get some in-person support. Finally, recent
research has suggested that increased mindfulness and mindfulness practices can facili-
tate forgiveness processes and interpersonal functioning (Johns et al., 2015), which can be
practiced from anywhere, and therefore extremely feasible for both partners to focus on
implementing when healing during a pandemic.

Couples will also need to work as a team to manage these intense emotions and to pre-
vent interactions from escalating and causing more damage. One such strategy is to
develop a specific safety plan for managing their interactions. Time-out techniques, as
described by Epstein and Baucom (2002) might be particularly helpful in getting both
members to agree on strategies to interrupt negative reciprocal cycles that are escalating
beyond a mutually agreed upon point. Couples should be encouraged to view these “time-
outs” as more akin to the time-outs taken by sports teams so that they can reengage more
effectively as a team when they are done than the kind of time-outs imposed upon children
who are misbehaving. While the strategies for engaging in a time-out may be more limited
during the pandemic, individuals can still find things to do (e.g., go for a walk, listen to
music, and do an exercise video at home) that will help them to calm down during the
time-out period so that they are able to effectively reunite with their partner.

Furthermore, another recommendation is to schedule times to talk about the affair
rather than having these discussions when emotions are running high (Snyder et al.,
2007). This strategy serves two purposes, the first of which is to reduce the likelihood of
emotional dysregulation during the conversation because the conversation does not start
when an individual is emotionally triggered or upset. The second purpose is to manage the

Fam. Proc., Vol. 59, September, 2020

FAMILY PROCESS

amount of time that the couple spends discussing the affair, which may be even more
important in a time period where partners cannot get a break from each other, and it
would be easier to fall into a pattern of constantly talking about the affair. For many
understandable reasons, injured partners will often find themselves to be obsessed and
ruminative about the affair, which can lead to the affair taking over the couple’s daily
interactions. While this impulse is normal and understandable for a variety of reasons
(see Gordon & Baucom, 1998), it ultimately can be a damaging and emotionally exhaust-
ing cycle for both partners and further inhibits their process of healing. Taking time to
schedule these discussions can help couples to exit this cycle in that it assures the injured
partner that the problem will not be ignored and allows them time to process the affair
dyadically. It also helps the involved partner to not be blindsided by discussions at all
times of the day and to know that there are some limits on the amount of discussion
required, which is crucial during this time where couples may be sharing the same physi-
cal space for most of the day. This latter benefit is useful to both partners because setting
this limit can often increase the involved partner’s willingness to be part of affair explo-
rations if they know that there are some safe parameters around the discussion.

Scheduling these talks also enables couples to find privacy for these discussions, which
is generally more difficult to do during the pandemic. If affair discussions are left to “just
happen” when emotions are running high, they are more likely to take place in more pub-
lic parts of the house and create greater risk that children will overhear and become possi-
bly triangulated in their parents’ relationships. Couples can create privacy around these
conversations by selecting a secluded place where the talks will occur—such as in their
bedroom with the door shut and perhaps some form of white noise running at the door to
discourage any curious eavesdroppers, on a walk through the neighborhood, in a garage,
or even in their cars. Clinicians should encourage couples to be creative with how they find
time and space to process the affair and to not give up quickly due to the increased chal-
lenges, which is something that they can continue to do even when engaging with couples
through teletherapy. The involved partner often is experiencing a great deal of shame
about this role, which in turn can lead to avoiding discussions so that this shame is not
triggered. They will often use these privacy barriers to stymy attempts by the injured
partner to engage around the affair, which may be easier to do during the pandemic
because there is a greater lack of privacy at all times. Helping the involved partner to
acknowledge the shame and the desire to avoid, and to think through the consequences of
continued avoidance, can be a useful first step in addressing these barriers. Further, help-
ing that same partner to consider the advantages of scheduling these talks can also help
reduce the stonewalling behaviors, and create expectations that will help both partners
feel more comfortable and confident in navigating this novel and stressful process.

As described above, one of the ways couples typically begin to move forward is for the
injured partner to gradually begin to engage in more trusting behaviors with the involved
partner. Initially, soon after the affair occurred, the injured partner might “check up” on
the involved partner to make sure that they were where they said they would be, with
who they said they would be with, and doing what they said they would be doing. These
checking behaviors will not need to occur as frequently if the partner cannot move around
freely due to COVID-19, and so partners may need to find another way to build trust.
However, even during times of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many couples
may find themselves needing to leave the house for essentials (e.g., groceries, doctor
appointments) or if one or both partners are considered an essential worker, and so oppor-
tunities to establish boundaries and set expectations may still exist. For couples who are
primarily not leaving the house, they can redirect these strategies to checking in about
virtual behaviors such as phone calls, text messages, and Face Time/Zoom/Skype calls,
which will still allow them to practice setting these boundaries and building skills around

www.FamilyProcess.org

/ 963

disclosure. For example, if the involved partner were to accidentally come in to physical
contact with the affair partner he/she would need to disclose that to the injured partner,
and the same principles apply if the involved partner is contacted by the affair partner. In
fact, contact by the affair partner in any form is something that should be disclosed to the
injured partner, but with the current pandemic these instances of virtual contact may be
more likely. We have found that there are emotionally risky behaviors that can also build
trust and connection between the partners, and perhaps could be better bridges to recov-
ery. For example, given that one of the major damages an affair incurs comes from the fact
that the involved partner puts their own needs over the securing of their partners, engag-
ing in behaviors that actually or symbolically are the opposite can start to rebuild trust.
To pull from previous recommendations, when an involved partner who experiences a
great deal of shame and discomfort in processing conversations is willing to show up for
the scheduled meetings and to approach them with honesty and nondefensiveness, these
behaviors can go a long way toward demonstrating a willingness to prioritize their part-
ners’ needs over their own. A continued pattern of these behaviors can help to build up
trust between the partners even when they are less able to move around in the world.

While many of the recommendations provided in this paper thus far are directed at the
couples, research tells us that over 50% of couples who experience infidelity will seek out
support through therapy (Peluso & Spina, 2008). Therefore, it is important to consider
how clinicians can best support these couples despite the fact that many clinicians are
now using teletherapy, as a way to balance the ability to continue to provide services while
also complying with social distancing regulations. While teletherapy is a great resource
for couples experiencing affair recovery during the pandemic, clinicians may need to fur-
ther adapt their usual procedures to best meet the needs of these couples during this time.
First, finding space and time away from the children may be more difficult but necessary
when discussing the affair and the relational consequences of this. Clinicians can support
couples in a dialogue about the best way to receive services during this time such as select-
ing a private space (e.g., in a car, in a bedroom with door closed and white noise machine
running) and time (e.g., early in the morning, late in the evening) in which they will be
able to achieve the necessary privacy for session. The selection of unusual times will also
require more flexibility on the part of the clinician to accommodate this. Second, clinicians
should discuss a “safety plan” with the couple that they can use should a session become
so emotionally charged that one partner removes themselves from the screen. While these
situations do occur in more traditional, in-person therapy formats as well, the clinician
has a lot less control over ensuring both partners’ safety with teletherapy and will want to
make sure from the start that the couple has a plan that they both feel comfortable with.
Third, clinicians may need to be more intentional to check in with couples about their rou-
tines and in particular any changes, or pending changes, to these. The changes may be
subtle, such as one partner having to attend a couple of in-person meetings for work with-
out going back full time or the decision to let their children have play dates again, but any
change in routine could present new challenges to the couple for navigating boundaries
and expectations and the clinician can play an important role in helping couples to do this.
Finally, clinicians should create space in session for both partners to process their feelings,
added stress, and uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. Couples may have a tendency to
only want to focus on the affair in session, as this is their primary reason for seeking ser-
vices. However, it is also important to acknowledge and encourage both partners to pro-
cess their reactions to the pandemic as this is an added, and unique, stressor on top of the
significant amount of stress experienced as a result of the affair.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, infidelity is a wrenching and devastating event that is difficult for cou-
ples to navigate even under the best of circumstances. Experiencing this relational trauma
during a global pandemic that is also traumatic with far-reaching social and economic con-
sequences is even more overwhelming. This context can intensify and exacerbate normal
emotional reactions to affairs and complicates efforts toward recovery. Couples will need
to dig deep and intentionally build emotional resources to meet these challenges. How-
ever, all is not lost in this context and there is hope for couples’ recovery during this time.
After many years of working with couples to deal with the discovery of an affair, we have
found that couples can be astonishingly resilient. If they are able to work as a team to
address their individual needs and to jointly address the barriers COVID-19 presents, this
process can bring couples closer together and create relationships that are healthier than
prior to the affair. We have had many couples express that while they would never wish
an affair to have happened, they are grateful that it made them see pre-existing problems
in their relationships and themselves that they are better off for having addressed more
proactively. Furthermore, some couples are finding that COVID-19 gives them more
opportunities to address and explore their issues, and some are finding the context of loss
and grief are heightening their desire to prioritize their relationship and to value the time
that they have together. Thus, COVID-19’s vast and life-changing impacts can create
added challenges and barriers in couples emotional and social lives, but as the clich(cid:1)e sug-
gests, it also can create opportunities for immense growth for these couples and the clini-
