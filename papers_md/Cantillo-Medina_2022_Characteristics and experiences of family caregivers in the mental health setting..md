ABSTRACT

Objective. To describe the characteristics and experiences of family caregivers of persons with mental 
disorders in a highly complex institution. Materials and methods. Mixed method, explanatory study, 
with an initial quantitative and then qualitative sequence. The quantitative phase was carried out using 
validated instruments: characterization sheet of the person with chronic illness-family caregiver dyad; 
the Nkongho Caregiving Ability Inventory (CAI), and the Zarit burden scale. The qualitative phase was 
conducted  with  a  hermeneutic  phenomenological  approach;  the  information  was  collected  through 
in-depth interviews to understand the needs of the caregivers. Results. The caregivers were mostly wo-
men, mainly mothers and daughters, home-occupied and self-employed, with basic primary education, 
low socioeconomic level and low caregiving skill level; a significant number of caregivers perceived some 
degree of overload. The themes identified in the analysis of the interviews were: feeling fear before the 
disease; the experience of caregiver fatigue; losing one’s job: another cost of the disease; fear of delegating 
care; love: a support for the caregiver; needing support to care. Conclusions. The caregiver experiences a 
complex situation associated with the high demand for care, and conditions under which mental health 
impairment progresses.

Worldwide, the care of people with mental disorders (MD) is a challenge due to its impact on 
physical, psychological and social functionality, which leads to a high degree of disability for 
the individual and a considerable health burden for society (1). An illness that lasts more than 
one year requires continuous medical care and causes limitation of daily living activities (2); in 
addition to a significant emotional and economic cost that affects the quality of life (1), related 
to the lack of social support and the modification in work, family and personal dynamics (3).
Budget  restrictions  in  Ibero-America  have  exacerbated  the  inequities  and  lack  of  fun-
ding for home care programs  (4) for individuals with MD. This has been aggravated by the 
phenomenon of displacement and the delegation of obligations, where health systems shift 
formal care from the hospital setting to families (1), making this a public and collective health 
problem (5).

With the progression of the MD, the person becomes dependent and requires the support 
of  a  caregiver  to  assist  him/her  in  daily  activities  and  for  optimal  treatment  (6).  Assuming 
the role of caregiver causes structural, procedural and emotional changes in the family unit, 
which can negatively affect the caregiver (7,8), due to the unpredictability, transitions, complex-
ity and interaction with the ill person (9).

to function and adapt to stressful life events  (10), added to the 
stigma that produces social rejection due to its association with 
violence (11) and the loss of control during crises, which can en-
danger his or her life or that of others. Therefore, the caregiver 
must use various strategies to cope with the emotional instabi-
lity of his or her family member until he or she can control the 
situation and recover (12).

The caregiver, on most occasions, carries out his or her 
work in isolation from the social environment, in the soli-
tude  of  his  or  her  home  and  in  anonymity,  without  being 
recognized by health professionals  (13). Some studies found 
in the literature address caregiver burden or overload in in-
dividuals with MD (14-16); however, there is a gap in knowle-
dge related to the exploration of variables such as caregiver 
characteristics, caregiving skill and overload, as well as the 
identification of caregivers’ needs through the use of a qua-
litative approach, for an in-depth of the conditions in which 
the caregiver of individuals with MD lives.

For the reasons stated above, the aim of this study is to 
describe the characteristics and experiences of the caregivers 
of family members with MDs in a care center for individuals 
with MDs in the city of Neiva, Colombia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Design
Explanatory mixed method study, with an initial quantita-
tive sequence followed by a qualitative phase that was con-
tinued  with  the  integration  of  the  results  and  data  during 
interpretation. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach 
was used in the qualitative phase.

Population, sample and type of sampling
The  quantitative  collection  included  all  caregivers  (n=64) 
of individuals confined in a care center for individuals with 

KEY MESSAGES

Motivation for the study: The lack of knowledge of the char-
acteristics and experiences of family caregivers in the context 
of mental health prevents the recognition, understanding and 
visibility of their conditions and needs.

Main  findings:  The  conditions  and  needs  of  caregivers  are 
glimpsed  through  the  deepening  of  their  lived  experiences; 
an increase in vulnerability that affects their quality of life is 
evidenced. 

Implications: Educational and psychosocial strategies should 
be developed, based on public policies that have an impact on 
the empowerment and well-being of those involved.

MDs, diagnosed as shown in Table 1; the average age 48.6 
years.  Five  caregivers  participated  in  the  qualitative  phase, 
who  were  selected  by  means  of  a  criterion-oriented  casual 
sampling (20).

Selection criteria
The following inclusion criteria were taken into account for 
both approaches: over 18 years of age, engaged in caregiving 
for a period of more than three months and more than three 
hours per day, between December 2019 and March 2020 in 
a care center for individuals with MDs in the city of Neiva, 
southern Colombia.

Procedures
Data  collection  during  the  quantitative  phase  was  carried 
out by the researchers and the research assistants, by using 
online instruments (Google forms), after acceptance of the 
virtual informed consent.

Qualitative information was collected through in-depth 
interviews (21) conducted by the main researcher. The caregi-

vers were contacted by telephone for the interviews, which 
lasted approximately one hour and were recorded and trans-
cribed  by  the  research  assistants.  A  field  diary  was  kept  to 
ensure that impressions, ideas and reflections were not lost 
during the analysis; anonymity was maintained.

Variables
The  sociodemographic  variables  and  characteristics  of  the 
caregivers were assessed using the characterization sheet of 
the  person  with  chronic  disease-family  caregiver  dyad  (17); 
caregiving skill using Nkongho’s caregiving ability inventory 
(CAI)  (18); and overload using Zarit’s overload scale  (19). The 
instruments are described below:

Characterization sheet of the person with 
chronic disease-family caregiver dyad
This instrument has face and content validity for Latin Ame-
rica. It presents 42 items that address the dyad in three cate-
gories: general conditions that include the sociodemographic 
profile; the perception of burden and support, and the means 
of information and communication available to them (17).

Nkongho’s Caregiving Ability Inventory (CAI).
This  instrument  is  made  up  of  subscales  that  respond  to 
three  factors  associated  with  understanding  oneself  and 

others: knowledge (low score of 76.3 or less, mean of 76.4-
83, and high of 84 or more); courage (low score of 62.4 or 
less, mean of 62.5-73, and high of 74 or more); and patience 
(low score of 60 or less, mean of 61-65.1, and high of 65.2 or 
more). The overall rating is considered low when it is 203 or 
less, mean 203.1-220.2, and high 220.3 or more. This instru-
ment has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.89 and a stability of r=0.80 
in Colombia (18).

Zarit’s overload scale
This instrument has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86 for the Co-
lombian  context.  It  is  comprised  of  22  items,  Likert-type 
questions with five response options where 1 is “never” and 
5 is “almost always”. A score of less than 46 indicates no over-
load, from 46 to 56 indicates mild overload and greater than 
56 indicates intense overload (19).

Data analysis
Data  analysis  was  conducted  with  IBM  SPSS®  statistical 
program, version 22. For categorical variables, we used fre-
quencies and percentages. For interval or ratio variables, the 
descriptive statistics mean, median, standard deviation, mi-
nimum and maximum were used.

The  study  of  the  qualitative  data  was  carried  out  by 
means of thematic analysis  (22), which is described as a me-
thod to identify, analyze and report common patterns (the-
mes) within the data; a table was constructed in a Word file, 
where the units of meaning were identified and grouped into 
common themes. Discussion and reflection were carried out 
by the researchers to organize the final themes, the connec-
tions  and  interconnections  between  them.  The  collection 
and analysis of the information was carried out at the same 
time, the results were returned to the participants and feed-
back was provided by them.

Ethical criteria
Study approved by the Ethics and Bioethics Committee of the 
Universidad Surcolombiana by act 007 of 2019, in compliance 
with the requirements of Resolution 08430 of 1993 based on 
the ethical principles of autonomy, respect, justice, beneficence, 
truthfulness, non-maleficence, confidentiality and suitability.

For  the  qualitative  approach,  we  considered  the  strin-
gent criteria proposed by Lincoln and Guba (23) of credibili-
ty, transferability, conformability and reliability. During the 
reflexivity process  (24), we recognized the importance of the 
participation of the researcher and the participant, in an at-
tempt to maintain openness towards the other and trying to 
see the world in a different way.

RESULTS

Table 2. Sociodemographic characteristics of the caregiver of the person 
with mental health impairment.

The selection of participants for the quantitative and qualita-

tive phases is presented in Figure 1.

The  caregivers  were  mostly  women  (67.2%),  aged  be-

tween 27 and 59 years, mainly mothers and daughters, with 

a stable partner, primary school education, home-occupied 

and self-employed, with low socioeconomic level, were ca-

regivers with no previous experience, had support from the 

beginning of the diagnosis, and practiced the Catholic reli-

gion (Table 2).

The caregivers, regarding their caregiving skill, showed a 

low level of the three dimensions: 50% in knowledge, 64.1% 

in courage and 75% in patience; we observed the same beha-

vior in the global skill rating with 71.9% (Table 3).

Our results show that 31.2% of caregivers had moderate 

overload and 31.3% had intense overload (Table 3). 

Five  caregivers  of  individuals  with  MDs  were  inter-

viewed. The following themes were reported in the analysis 

of the interviews:

Feeling fearful of the disease
When a loved one is diagnosed with a MD, it causes concern 

and emotional stress due to the stigma attached to this per-

son’s health condition; in addition, they are terrified of chan-

ges in medication due to the exacerbation of the symptoms 

of  the  disease.  Fear  of  episodes  of  aggressiveness  leads  the 

caregiver to feel “frightened” and uncertain.

“At first, I tried to scare myself because I said no, if that’s 

how it is as a boyfriend, it’s for life. ... There are people who 

attack themselves or others, I was afraid that I would arrive 

and she wouldn’t understand me and I would hurt someone 

or she would hurt herself. That’s why I got scared”. (CMP 1)

“One  gets  desperate,  and  thinks,  is  she  going  to  reco-

ver?  and  how  long?  we  are  terrified  that  they  will  suspend 

her medications because the disease will increase, it scares 

us, that’s why we are waiting for monitoring. We are scared 

of two things, knowing that she is in this situation and not 

knowing if she will be able to control (the disease)”. (HFC 2)

“We went to bed late, she was sick, the child was young 
and I arrived at work irritated, I have not been a problem, 
but it is annoying, starting the morning, arriving at work and 
starting with that burden on top of me, it is a problem, it is a 
problem... I want to get home to sleep, but I have to take care 
of her...”. (CMP 1)

“It  has  been  complicated  for  me,  because  I  can’t  leave 
him alone, he takes to the street, I have to keep an eye on 
him, many times he is very aggressive and rude to me... It 
was very hard for us, at that time my husband was living, it 
was very hard for me, very hard, because he was the youn-
gest  of  the  children,  so  we  resigned  ourselves  to  take  him 
with that disease and to support him”. (JPM 3)

“That’s like having a gift for people, for me it’s not so di-
fficult, sometimes I get tired, for that I take a medicine and 
you have to keep going”. (MCE 5)

Losing one’s job: another cost of illness
The commitment of caregivers to provide care to their loved one 
sometimes leads them to lose their jobs due to the great demands 
of caregiving, which is related to the amount of time and demand 
required on a daily basis, taking into account their inability to 
take  care  of  themselves  adequately,  in  addition  to  the  multiple 
commitments they must fulfill as members of a family.

“I  had  to  say  “I  can’t  work  anymore,  my  wife  is  sick,  I 
have a small child, 2, 3 years old, it’s over...”. I have quit many 
jobs because of her, I see that she is sick and I cannot take 
care of her, so I quit...”. (CMP 1)

“You don’t think about anything else, you can’t focus, I 

was working and I had to quit because you only think about 

the welfare of that person. Leaving my job did not affect me 

financially... but professionally, I had to stop because my goal 

was my mother’s recovery”. (HFC 2)

“He lives in and out of the hospital for a month, a month 

and a half, and he comes back and they hand him over to me, 

and that’s why I haven’t been able to do anything, I get jobs, 

but I can’t because of him...it’s chaos”. (JPM 3)

The fear of delegating care
For  caregivers,  delegating  care  causes  fear  as  they  believe 

that care will not be provided with the same quality and de-

dication, they feel that only they are prepared to do so, and 

they are the ones who have known their family member best 

since the diagnosis of the disease; in addition, they consider 

themselves  responsible  for  carrying  out  this  task.  Another 

important aspect that produces fear in the caregiver is rela-

ted to the fear of violence exercised by other family members 

when they are in charge of caring for the loved one.

“I  cannot  leave  my  mother’s  care,  because  if  my  sisters 

take care of her, they will beat her, if I get sick, I will have to 

look for a home to take care of her, my mother told me that 

if the time came when I could not take care of her, I should 

leave her under a bridge, so I ask God to have mercy on her 

and on me”. (EPH 5)

“I have been with my son all my life, he began to have 

the  disease  when  he  was  16  years  old,  he  was  a  very  good 

student, when the disease developed, my husband died and 

we  both  continued  to  fight,  I  am  alone  with  him,  I  have  a 

daughter, but she does not love him, she treats him badly, so 

I live worried, I have no one, I have no resources...”. (JPM 3)

Love: a support for the caregiver
Caregivers assume their role out of love, fulfill all the wishes 

of the person they care for, devote all their time seeking their 

well-being, helping them to move forward and being a su-

pport to move forward.

“Those  people  should  have  people  around  them  who 

love them, who really want to sacrifice because it is partly a 

sacrifice, to sacrifice for them, for love... I do all that because 

I am in love with her, I have not lost that illusion, that it is 

possible to live with bipolar disorder, it is possible”. (CMP 1)

“I thought about positive things and knowing that I was 

doing  it  with  love  because  I  knew  she  was  my  mom,  that 

made me feel better... The truth was that I did it with that

my daughter, but she’s with the dad, I knew she was going 

to be fine; there I went and said, well I’m going to face the 

situation, I was going with that positivity”. (HFC 2)

“She is a girl who has managed to get ahead because you 

have  to  handle  them  with  love  and  dedication,  always  su-

pporting them, encouraging them to believe in themselves... 

They have mood swings, they feel very sad, sometimes a little 

aggressive, you have to know how to handle them, channel 

those feelings, supporting them in a positive way with love 

and tolerance so that they can achieve their goals”. (NEC 4)

“Have patience, my mom hits me, and I let her hit me, 

she grabs me and spanks me, I keep this hand swollen she 

always hits me there, I just take her hand away and tell her 

not to be foolish, and I tell her why does she want to hit me? 

I love her so much”. (MCE 5)

Needing support to care
Care must be shared, the caregiver needs to have recreational 

spaces, he/she must be very aware of him/herself and know 

his/her limits in order not to give up. One of the aspects that 

affect  the  caregiver  is  related  to  the  economic  impact  that 

the disease has on the family nucleus and especially on the 

caregiver, they require economic support to meet the needs 

of the ill person and that are inherent to the disease; howe-

ver, the illness of their family member leads them to extreme 

situations due to the impossibility of working and covering 

expenses in order to support the family.

“My  husband  did  it  for  my  health,  I  was  desperate  not 

being able to do anything for my mom, letting the days go by 

and not doing anything, 10 months that she was like that in 

that situation, I always had the support of my husband and 

my dad, they told me “calm down””. (HFC 2)

“Sometimes I go out, I get very depressed and feel bad, I 

go to some friends, to an aunt who sometimes helps me with 

clothes or shoes. I go there or to my sisters and I tell them 

my  problems,  although  they  don’t  help  me  much,  they  are 

also poor”. (JPM 3)

“I always have support, usually it is a sister, who is also 

very loving, she likes to share, teach, educate, it is natural to 

us caregivers of children with mental disabilities, .... I get up 

and ask God a lot to enlighten me, give me wisdom to be able 

to help them”. (NEC 4)

“My need would be to have a person who would be here 

with me day and night, so that when I go to sleep she would 

be  watching  over  me,  or  that  I  could  say  well,  I  am  going 

to downtown all day today and you can leave with peace of 
mind,  that  they  give  you  food,  medicine  and  have  money, 
have money to buy things for you. If there is no money, what 
can you buy things with?”. (EPH 5)

DISCUSSION

The caregivers are mainly women of productive age, mothers 
and  daughters,  with  stable  partners,  low  educational  level, 
informal jobs, low socioeconomic level, have support for ca-
regiving and profess the Catholic religion. With low levels in 
the dimensions of knowledge, courage and patience, as well 
as in the overall assessment of caregiving skills, they present 
levels of overload ranging from mild to intense.

The characteristics of the caregivers coincide with those 
previously described in the literature, the role is mainly assu-
med by women (14,25), feminization persists as the main cha-
racteristic of formal and informal care (25), generally mothers 
in the cycle of mature adulthood with severe deterioration 
of their physical health and with mental health risks typical 
of aging (15).

Caregivers showed total dependence (25). Most of the ca-
regivers have a low educational and socioeconomic level, are 
dedicated to their home, since maintaining a working life is 
complicated by the dedication and time invested in the per-
formance  of  the  caregiving  role  (25),  which  are  unfavorable 
conditions  for  well-being  (16).  The  circumstances  described 
above increase the vulnerability of families because they im-
poverish them (26,27); additionally, they must assume multiple 
requirements not covered by the health system (26).

The caregivers had a partner and a bond with the cared 
person (children and parents), which are aspects that contri-
bute to overcome the obstacles and challenges imposed by 
the  physical  limitations  (25).  Caregivers,  most  of  them  with 
support and without previous experience in the role, care for 
a  time  longer  than  14  months.  They  make  adjustments  to 
their work obligations  (27) and develop strategies for coping 
and adaptation to the disease in search of well-being for the 
patient and family members (12); the whole family group may 
be  affected,  and  will  depend  on  internal  and  external  su-
pport, and on the individual resources of its members (27,28), 
there being a strong relationship between the quality of life 
of the caregivers, the family relationship and the mismatch 
in the dynamics and the diagnosis (1).

Most  caregivers  expressed  that  they  perceive  overload, 
which  may  be  associated  with  the  multiple  responsibilities 
they  assume  regarding  the  tasks  required  by  the  degree  of

generates  feelings  and  emotions  of  anguish,  fear,  guilt  and 
worry in the families, added to the lack of knowledge about 
the management of the health condition, making them feel 
incapable in their caregiving work (28).

Similarly, the received support was rated at a medium level 
overall by most of the population, and reached the highest level 
for religious and family support. These are important aspects 
to strengthen, as suggested by other authors (28), with plans that 
need  to  be  suitable  for  the  needs  of  individuals  and  families, 
taking into account the effect of mental health disorders in the 
reduction of their quality of life (10).

Consequently, caregivers of persons with mental health 
disorders live in conditions that increase their vulnerability, 
with the risk of entering the vicious circle of caregiving from 
the moment they receive the news of their family member’s 
illness, feeling fear of the disease, due to the recurrence of 
crises, prolonged dedication to the work  (18), progression of 
the situation, and the effects on their lives (9). The impact of 
caregiving can cause a greater effort and uncertainty for tho-
se who live with and care for the family member  (3,4,12), and 
shows the experience of caregiver fatigue added to the situa-
tion of losing their job, which are aspects that corroborate 
the quantitative findings related to the presence of overload 
and  the  wear  and  tear  of  maintaining  independent  work, 
threatened by the constant presence of the disease.

Caregivers use love as support and as a coping strategy, 
by  creating  practices  to  provide  wellbeing  to  their  family 
member,  showing  care  with  love  as  a  fundamental  aspect 
when assuming the leading role in facing health crises, and 
always prioritizing the maintenance of the affective bond (12). 
Faced with the need to provide and achieve greater well-be-
ing and with the aim of feeling fulfillment and a little pea-

ce  of  mind,  caregivers  develop  spirituality  through  family 
prayer, which allows them, despite the pain and fatigue, to 
maintain  the  hope  that  favors  the  ability  to  transcend  and 
thus  alleviate  the  emotional,  physical  and  psychological 
wear and tear  (30). Needing support to care for and rely on, 
gives meaning to life, facilitates acceptance of their new si-
tuation  (7), allows social integration, and contributes to the 
prevention of loneliness (13).

The limitations of the study are related to the use of con-
venience sampling and the small sample size, despite the fact 
that we used the entire population of caregivers. Regarding 
the qualitative approach, the design we used to explore the 
meaning of the phenomenon is a limitation because the re-
sults cannot be generalized. 

In conclusion, we can affirm that the care of the indivi-
dual with MD represents a complex situation associated with 
the demand for care and the progress of the disorder. Most of 
the population with MD showed total dependence, and con-
sequently, they live in vulnerable conditions, which ratifies 
the importance of developing educational and psychosocial 
strategies  that  have  an  impact  on  their  empowerment  and 
well-being.
