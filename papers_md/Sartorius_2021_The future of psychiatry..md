ABSTRACT

Since the Second World War mental health programmes and psychiatry have made significant advances. Countries, 

as well as the United Nations, have recognized the magnitude and severity of mental health problems, and numerous 

national programmes have been launched to deal with them. Technology relating to the treatment of mental disorders 

has advanced and significant progress has been made in terms of knowledge regarding the functioning of the brain. 

The awareness of the need to protect the human rights of those with mental illness has increased. National and 

regional programmes against stigma and the consequent discrimination of those with mental illness, have been 

launched in many countries. Associations bringing together those who have experienced mental illness and their 

relatives, have come into existence in many countries. 

While these are great steps forward, more work is necessary to complete these advances. In low- and middle-

income countries, the vast majority of people with mental disorders do not receive adequate treatment. Even in highly 

industrialized  countries,  a  third  of  people  with  severe  forms  of  mental  illness  are  not  receiving  the  appropriate 

therapy. Laws concerning mental health are outdated in many countries. The protection of the human rights of the 

mentally ill is incomplete and imperfect. The emphasis on economic gain and the digitalization of medicine in recent 

years has not helped. On occasions, this has even slowed down the development of mental health services, and the 

provision of mental healthcare. Thus, psychiatry must still deal with the challenges of the past century, while facing 

new demands and tasks. 

Among the new tasks for psychiatry are undoubtedly reforms which will allow (i) the provision of appropriate care 

of people with comorbid mental and physical disorders, (ii) the application of interventions leading to the primary 

prevention of mental and neurological disorders, and (iii) a radical reform of the education of psychiatrists and other 

mental health workers, dealing with mental illness. Collaboration with other stakeholders in the field of mental health 

and medicine, will be of crucial importance in relation to all these tasks. 

АННОТАЦИЯ

После  Второй  мировой  войны  программы  по  охране  психического  здоровья  и  психиатрия  достигли 

значительного  успеха.  Государства,  а  также  Организация  Объединённых  Наций  признали  масштаб 

и  серьёзность  проблем  психического  здоровья,  что  повлекло  за  собой  запуск  множества  национальных 

программ,  направленных  на  решение  этих  проблем.  Продвинулись  технологии  лечения  психических 

расстройств,  значительный  прогресс  был  достигнут  в  понимании  функционирования  головного  мозга. 

Возросло осознание необходимости защиты прав людей с психическими заболеваниями. Во многих странах 

были запущены национальные и региональные программы по борьбе со стигматизацией и, соответственно, 

дискриминацией  людей  с  психическими  заболеваниями;  появились  ассоциации,  объединяющие  людей 

с психическими расстройствами и их родственников. 

Несмотря  на  достигнутый  прогресс,  необходимы  дальнейшие  действия.  Значительная  часть  людей 

с психическими заболеваниями в странах с низким и средним уровнем доходов не получает должного лечения. 

Даже в промышленно развитых регионах до 1/3 больных тяжёлыми формами психических заболеваний лишены 

надлежащей помощи. Законы в области психического здоровья устарели во многих странах, а защита прав

на экономическую целесообразность медицинской помощи и цифровизация медицины не улучшили ситуацию. 

В  некоторых  случаях  это  даже  замедлило  развитие  психиатрических  служб  и  оказание  помощи  в  сфере 

психического здоровья. Таким образом, психиатрия вынуждена справляться со сложностями, возникшими 

в прошлом веке, и при этом соответствовать новым требованиям и задачам. 

К современным задачам, стоящим перед психиатрией, несомненно, относятся реформы, которые позволят 

оказывать (i) необходимую помощь людям с коморбидными психическими и физическими заболеваниями;  

(ii) применять методы по обеспечению первичной профилактики психических и неврологических заболеваний; 

(iii) провести радикальную реформу в образовании психиатров и других специалистов в области психического 

здоровья.  Решение  всех  этих  задач  требует  тесного  сотрудничества  между  всеми  заинтересованными 

сторонами в области психического здоровья и медицины.
