Summary
Current  research  evaluating  the  consequences  of  stigma  towards  people  with  mental  illness  is  not  nuanced  in 
emphasizing the critical distinction between stigma as negative attitudes and discrimination as harmful behaviours 
that  limit  access  to  services,  employment,  and  social  inclusion.  Understanding  these  distinctions  is  essential  for 
designing targeted, evidence-based universal, targeted and indicated interventions to improve the quality of life and 
well-being. This review evaluates the evidence on the consequences of stigma towards people with mental illness. 
Using  PRISMA  guidelines,  we  analysed  448  studies  (294  quantitative,  154  qualitative)  investigating  stigma’s 
negative outcomes. Findings were categorized into health, service use, psychosocial, economic, and structural im-
pacts. Although stigma is consistently associated with adverse outcomes across life domains, evidence of a causal 
link  between  negative  attitudes  and  poorer  outcomes  for  individuals  with  mental  disorders  remains  limited. 
Furthermore,  there  is  a  striking  scarcity  of  research  from  low-  and  middle-income  countries,  with  significant 
regional gaps, and studies addressing structural stigma embedded in societal institutions are particularly rare. Ef-
forts  to  combat  stigma  must  distinguish  between  attitudes  and  behaviours,  focusing  on  reducing  discrimination 
while  enhancing  public  mental  health  literacy  and  access  to  effective  interventions.  Tackling  these  challenges  re-
quires a comprehensive, evidence-informed approach to improving mental health outcomes for all.

refers  to  the  negative  attitudes  that  society  directs  to-
ward individuals with mental health conditions whereas 
self-stigma  occurs  when  individuals  internalize  these 
societal  stereotypes,  leading  to  diminished  self-esteem 
and reduced willingness to seek help.15,16

The  modern  concept  of  stigma  emerged  in  1963 
when Goffman operationalized it as a distinctive mark 
given  by  society  to  an  individual,  signifying  an  ‘attri-
bute,  trait  or  disease  that  leads  to  any  form  of  com-
munity  sanction’.17,18  In  this  framework,  stigma  is 
distinct  from  discrimination:  stigma  represents  a  soci-
etal  label  laden  with  negative  connotations,  whereas 
discrimination  involves  actions  that  negatively  impact 
those  who  bear  this  label.  At  the  turn  of  the  millen-
nium, Link and Phelan (2001) argued that the exercise 
of  power  and  the  enforcement  of  discrimination  are 
necessary  conditions  for  stigmatization  to  occur.6  This 
definition was later criticized, and it has been suggested 
that  labelling,  negative  stereotyping,  linguistic  separa-
tion (“us” versus “them”), and power asymmetry must 
all be present for stigma to arise.19

Nowadays,  although  evolutionary  causes  of  stigma 
are  well  understood,20  mental  health  stigma  is  widely 
considered  as  a  problem  of  knowledge  (lack  of  it  or 
ignorance)  that  is  associated  with  negative  attitudes 
(negative  stereotypes,  prejudices)  that  in  turn  is  asso-
ciated  with  negative  behaviour  (negative  discrimina-
tion).21  This  prevailing  definition 
that 
discrimination  is  a  subset  of  stigma  rather  than  a 
standalone  issue,  potentially  leading  to  the  hypothesis 
that  changing  public  attitudes  may  effectively  reduce 
discrimination and improve the lives of people with and 
without mental health conditions.

implies 

First,  power  asymmetries  exist  in  all  societies, 
making it overly simplistic to claim that only dominant 
groups can stigmatize. Stigmatization operates through 
complex mechanisms that are not solely dependent on 
structural  power.20  For  example,  if  only  dominant 
groups could stigmatize, then racist views held by white 
individuals in apartheid-era South Africa would cease to 
be  stigmatizing  once  white  dominance  ended—an 
empirically and ethically untenable conclusion. Second, 
defining discrimination both as a component of stigma 
and  as  one  of  its  consequences  results  in  a  logical  fal-
lacy, as no phenomenon can simultaneously be its own 
cause and its own outcome.

investigation 

Third,  much  research  and  interventions  on  mental 
health stigma  have so  far merged stigma  and  discrim-
ination and focused on shifting public attitudes,21  with 
limited 
into  whether  such  changes 
empirically  cause  reduced  discrimination  or  tangible 
benefits for PWMI, such as improved access to services, 
employment  opportunities,  or  social  inclusion.  This 
disconnect  is  particularly  problematic  given  that  the 
most harmful consequences of stigma often stem from 
discriminatory  behaviours,  which  systematically  limit 
access to essential resources and opportunities.1

Globally,  combating  mental  health  stigma  has  been 
declared a priority, with substantial resources dedicated to 
anti-stigma programs aimed at improving public attitudes. 
However, these programs often measure success based on 
changes  in  expressed  attitudes  rather  than  reductions  in 
stigma’s  negative  correlates,  such  as  discrimination  or 
systemic inequalities. If the underlying assumption—that 
reducing  stigma  will  mitigate  negative  outcomes—is 
flawed or overly simplistic, such interventions may fail to 
address the most pressing challenges faced by PWMI.

In this review, we aim to map and analyse evidence on 
the  negative  consequences  of  mental  health  stigma, 
focusing  on  the  causal  pathways  linking  the  label  of 
mental illness to adverse outcomes across all domains of 
life, including health, service use, psychosocial, economic, 
and  structural  domains.  By  distinguishing  between  atti-
tudes and discrimination as a problem of behaviours, we 
seek  to  provide  a  foundation  for  interventions  that  can 
improve mental health outcomes for all.

Methods
Search  strategy  and  selection  criteria
We  followed  established  guidelines  on  conducting 
scoping  reviews.22  To  identify  relevant  studies,  we 
applied  a  broad  search  strategy  to  the  following  scien-
tific  databases:  Web  of  Knowledge  (WoK),  Ovid 
(including  Global  Health,  HMIC,  Medline, PsycINFO) 
and  Cochrane  Library,  the  first  search  was  done  on 
January  15th,  2020,  an  update  of  the  search  was  done 
on April 23rd, 2024, and another on March 19th 2025. 
In our initial search strategy, we did not apply any time 
limit, and we used a combination of keywords related to 
‘stigma’  with  other  mental  health  and  consequences 
related keywords. For the update only papers published 
between  2020  and  2024  were  included.  To  identify 
negative consequences, we used terms such as impacts, 
discrimination,  problems,  difficulties,  ramifications, 
influences, effects, inequities, injustices, issues, etc. We 
provide the full search strategy in the Appendix.

We  screened  data  according  to  the  inclusion  and 
exclusion  criteria  provided  in  Table  1.  We  included 
studies  on  negative  consequences  or  correlates  of 
stigma  (henceforth 
‘stigma  related  outcomes’)  on 
PWMI,  and  we  broadly  operationalized  a  negative 
stigma related outcome as any negative outcome across 
any dimension of human life. We did not systematically 
analyse  studies  looking  at  associations  between  atti-
tudes  and  intended  behaviour,  since  we  understand 
intended behaviour as an expression of social  distance 
rather than as actual behaviour.

Data  extraction
Due to the large number of records, we split the data set 
in  half  and  two  pairs  of  researchers  independently 
screened titles and abstracts of each half (AK, AA, and 
PW, ZG). Disagreements at this stage were resolved via

discussion until consensus was reached amongst pairs. 
Next, two researchers (AA, ZG) independently screened 
full texts, each 50% (959 full texts split roughly in half) 
of  the  records.  All  disagreements  were  discussed  and 
reviewed for a second time; further disagreements were 
resolved with a third investigator (PW or AK).

Two  researchers  (AA,  ZG)  extracted  relevant  study 
characteristics in Airtable, an online spreadsheet database 
service.  Data  extraction  included  details  on  author(s’) 
name(s),  title,  year  of  publication,  geographical  location 
(according to the United Nations geoscheme), sample size 
and diagnosis, specific findings related to consequences of 
stigma  and  scales  used  to  measure  them,  as  well  as 
domain  categorization  of  studies  (see  Table  1 
in 
Appendix). For the update of the search in both 2024 and 
in 2025 the same method was used with two researchers 
updating the screening (ZG, HT).

Data  analysis
First, quantitative data was analysed to provide a global 
overview  of  the  existing  knowledge  via  descriptive 
summaries of the results. Data provided in  the results 
sections of qualitative studies were open-coded.24  After 
examining the results of included studies, we assigned 
a  label  to  each  of  the  studies  based  on  the  type  of 
identified stigma related outcome.

Next,  we  used  a  bottom-up  approach  to  categorise 
labels  into  larger  domains  of  stigma  related  outcome. 
The  domains  were  as  follows:  health,  service  use,  psy-
chosocial,  economic  and  structural  outcomes.  Health 
outcomes  refer  to  outcomes  related  to  the  mental  or 
somatic health of an individual (e.g., symptom severity, 
somatic  illness  or  hospitalisation  frequencies).  Service 
use  outcomes  include  behaviours  such  as  treatment 
adherence  or  help  seeking.  Psychosocial  outcomes 
include  outcomes  related  to  psychological  and  social 
aspects such as self-esteem, quality of life, social capital, 
etc. Economic outcomes refer to topics such as financial 
strain and housing. Finally structural outcomes refer to 

all  non-individual  level  outcomes  such  as  systematic 
and structural stigma.

In  accordance  with  systematic  scoping  review 
guidelines,22  quality  assessment  was  not  conducted, 
since  our  aim  was  to  provide  an  overview  of  evidence 
and to identify gaps. Furthermore, given the wide het-
erogeneity of eligible study designs, and the descriptive 
aims of the review, a formal assessment of publication 
bias  and  statistical  heterogeneity  was  not  feasible  or 
appropriate.  Instead,  we  categorised  studies  based  on 
design and methodology to understand the strength of 
evidence. We categorically assigned quantitative studies 
into three groups: studies with a simple cross-sectional 
design identifying correlational associations (A) studies 
with  cross-sectional  design  employing  more  complex 
statistical  methods  such  as  path  analysis  or  structural 
equation modelling (B)25  and studies with longitudinal 
design  (C).  Finally,  we  sorted  the  data  by  labels  and 
domains and by the strength of evidence with respect to 
a  region  of  origin.  Qualitative  studies  were  treated  as 
primary data and analysed inductively using open cod-
ing.24  Following  the  principles  of  thematic  synthesis,26 
codes  were  grouped  into  descriptive  and  analytical 
themes.  Although  based  on  second-order  constructs, 
the  data  were  approached  as  if  they  were  primary 
qualitative data to enable cross-study interpretation and 
theme development.

Results
Following  deduplication,  title  and  abstract  screening 
resulted 
in  959  eligible  articles  for  the  full-text 
screening  (Fig.  1).  Most  studies  (n  =  488)  excluded  at 
the full text stage did not meet our inclusion criteria for 
methodological  requirements,  such  as  vignette  and 
intended  behaviour  studies.  In  total,  448  studies  were 
included in this review (see Table 1 in Appendix for all 
included studies).

association  of  stigma  with  outcomes  of 
(n  =  224)  followed  by  cross-sectional  studies  that 
employed  complex  analysis  of  data  like  structural 
equation  modelling  (n  =  38)  and  longitudinal  studies 
(n  =  32).  The  remaining  (n  =  32)  were  descriptive 
studies on stigma consequences related to help-seeking 
or  adherence  to  treatment  (not  included  in  Table  2). 
There were altogether 154 qualitative studies. Research 
from  North  America,  Northern  and  Western  Europe 
and  Eastern  Asia  constitute  most  of  the  strongest  evi-
dence  on  stigma  related  outcomes,  whereas  some  re-
gions  such  as  the  Caribbean,  African  regions,  Central 
Asia,  Central  America  and  Oceania  were  underrepre-
sented. Fig. 2 shows the study distribution by domain. 
In light of the wide heterogeneity of study designs (467 
studies,  including  both  quantitative  and  qualitative 
work) and the descriptive aims of the review, a formal 
assessment  of  publication  bias  and  statistical  hetero-
geneity was not conducted. As shown in Table 2, most 
studies  were  conducted  in  high-income  countries 
(HICs),  particularly  Northern  America  (142  studies), 
Northern Europe (48), and Western Europe (48). These 
regions  also  contributed  most  of  the  longitudinal  and 
complex  study  designs.  In  contrast,  low-  and  middle- 
income  countries  (LMICs)  are  vastly  underrepre-
sented. Several regions, including Central America and 
Asia, had no studies at all.

Health  domain  outcomes
Stigma is widely shown as a correlate of to be associated 
with  the  deterioration  of  mental  health  status.  In  a 
cohort study of 290 PWMI, Ilic and colleagues provided 
strong  evidence  that  stigma  experiences  can  lead  to 
increased  severity  of  psychiatric  symptoms,  lower  self- 
esteem  and  quality  of  life.29  A  survival  analysis  by 
Rüsch  et  al.  showed  that  young  people  at  risk  for  psy-
chosis reporting stigma as a stressor were at higher risk 
of transitioning to schizophrenia.30  This is also reflected 
in  a  study  where  stigma  related  stress  was  associated 
with poorer recovery for PWMI at 2 year follow-up.31

Other  longitudinal  data  suggest  that  stigma  can  be 
associated  with  higher  depressive,32–34  and  psychotic 
symptoms.32  Similarly, higher levels of self-stigma were 
significantly  associated  with  increased  positive  symp-
toms  and  lower  functioning  after  12  months,35  and 
psychiatric  hospitalisation  after  6  months.36  Addition-
ally,  reduction  in  stigma  scores  during  the  follow-up 
period  was  associated  with  reduced  depressive  and 
anxiety  symptoms  and  improvements  towards  clinical 
recovery.37  It  is  possible,  however,  that  symptom 
severity  can  be  both  a  predictor  and  an  outcome  in 
relation  to  self-stigma.38  Conversely,  some  studies 
found no evidence supporting stigma as a predictor of 
depressive  symptoms  at  3  months39  and  1  year  follow- 
up40  or depression relapses at 2-year follow-up.41

Results related to impact of stigma on suicidality for 
PWMI  are  mixed.  In  participants  at  risk  of  psychosis, 
suicidality  was  predicted  by  increased  stigma  stress  at 
1-year  follow-up.42  The  same  study  did  not  find  an  as-
sociation  of  suicidality  with  perceived  stigma.  Higher 
self-stigma  predicted  suicidal  ideation  after  2  years  in 
people  with  psychiatric  disabilities43  but  there  was  no 
association  found  after  1  year  in  people  with  depres-
sion.44  Some  evidence  suggests  that  the  link  between 
stigma  and  suicidality  is  mediated  by  lower  self- 
esteem,45  and hopelessness.46,47

There is a  great amount of cross-sectional evidence 
suggesting  that  stigma 
is  associated  with  worse 
depressive, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse, ADHD or 
manic  symptoms.32–36  However,  the  evidence  linking 
stigma to the number of psychiatric admissions, dura-
tion  of  mental  illness,  and  number  of  episodes  is  not 
globally  generalisable  as  some  studies  report  no  sig-
nificant  association.34,48,49  A  few  studies  examined  the 
impact  of  stigma  on  physical  health  of  PWMI.  Some 
report that stigma is associated with self-reported poor 
physical  health,37,50,51  and  that  stigma  can  mediate  the 
effect of disability on perceived health.52

Multiple  qualitative  studies  echoed  outcomes  found 
in  the  cross-sectional  studies,  such  as  increased  experi-
ences  of  psychotic  and  anxiety  symptoms,  lower  mood 
and  increased  anxiety.39,53–55  Some  qualitative  studies 
report  on  treatment  related  consequences  in  healthcare 
settings,  expressed  as  a  lack  of  interest  from  health 
professionals,  diagnostic  overshadowing  and  perceived 
exclusion from PWMI in hospital and primary care set-
tings, and ultimately further health complications.56,57

Service  use  domain  outcomes
Adherence,  attitudes  to  treatment  and  even  recovery 
orientation (such as hope for  recovery) can be affected 
by  stigma.58  Oexle  and  colleagues  showed  that  higher 
self-stigma  predicted  less  recovery  orientation  at  base-
line and at 1 year after controlling for symptom severity, 
age and gender, however these results did not hold after 
two  years.59  The  longitudinal  evidence  does  provide 
some  insight  towards  the  evidence  of  causality  or  lack 
thereof  in  the  observations  of  associated  outcomes  of 
the  cross-sectional  studies.  Although  some  studies 
indicate  a  cross–sectional  association  of  stigma  and 
poor  treatment  adherence,  both  pharmaceutical  and 
psychosocial,58,60–62  this  was  not  found  in  a  prospective 
study  after  1  year  follow-up  in  people  who  were  pre-
scribed antidepressants.41

In terms of treatment attitude, increase in perceived 
stigma  after  one  year  of  follow-up  predicted  more 
negative  attitudes  toward  psychotherapy,63  and  stigma 
endorsement  in  people  with  depression  predicted  less 
help  seeking  at  6-months  follow-up.64  It  is  possible, 
however,  that  intention  to  seek  help  is  mediated  by 
symptom  severity,65  as  well  as  by  the  level  of  self-effi-
cacy.66  Another study showed that self-stigma mediates 
the  link  between  perceived  public  stigma  and  help- 
seeking.67

Qualitative  studies  also  provided  insights  into  the 
consequences  of  stigma  related  to  negative  internal 
emotions  experienced  by  PWMI  such  as  shame, 
embarrassment,  lowered  self-esteem,68,69  and  hopeless-
ness,70  and  often  these  consequences  were  linked  to 
stigmatising  friends  and  family.68  Qualitative  data  also 
suggests that stigma may have an impact on the process 
of recovery by inhibiting or slowing it down.68,71  Multi-
ple  qualitative  studies  presented  reports  from  PWMI 
attributing  poorer  adherence  to  pharmaceutical  treat-
ment  to  stigma  and  internalised  shame  in  relation  to 
medication.72  This issue might be especially important 
in  adolescents  who  refuse  treatment  due  to  stigma.73 
Finally,  several  qualitative  studies  described  reduced 
help-seeking  as  a  consequence  of  stigma.  This 

encompassed willingness and steps taken towards help- 
seeking,74  and shame attached to help-seeking.75

Longitudinal  studies  or  cross-sectional  studies  with 
complex analysis on service use consequences of stigma 
were  scarce  in  the  following  regions:  South  America, 
Western  and  Eastern  Africa,  with  South  East  Asia 
having  no  such  studies.  See  Table  3  in  Appendix  for 
complete distribution. No qualitative studies on service 
use  consequences  were  found  in:  Southern  and  West-
ern Africa, Central Asia.

Longitudinal, cross-sectional, and qualitative studies 
show  that  stigma  in  people  with  mental  illness  is 
associated  with  poorer  psychiatric  symptoms,  lower 
self-esteem, reduced quality of life, slower recovery, and 
negative  healthcare  experiences,  though  findings  for 
depression and suicidality are mixed. Evidence remains 
limited in many regions including South America, Af-
rica, and Asia.

Psychosocial  domain  outcomes
The relationship between stigma and multiple psycho-
social variables such as self-esteem, quality of life, self- 
efficacy  and  others  is  complex.76–85  Link  et  al.  demon-
strated  that  perceived  stigma  predicted  lower  self- 
esteem  at  6  months  follow-up  after  controlling  for 
baseline levels of self-esteem, depressive symptoms and 
diagnosis  in  PWMI.76  Reduction  in  self-stigmatising 
beliefs  over  a  follow-up  period  was  associated  with 
improvement  in  functioning  and  quality  of  life,37  and 
less  emotional  discomfort  at  six  months,77  however 
other longitudinal studies failed to demonstrate signif-
icant  association  of  self-stigma  with  quality  of  life.78,79 
Factors  like  intensity  of  depressive  symptoms,  pres-
ence  of  social  support, 
level  of  self-efficacy  and 
empowerment can mediate perceived stigma’s effect on 
quality of life.72,81  Similarly, variables such as hope, self- 
esteem or self-efficacy appear to be mediating the effect 
of self-stigma on quality of life,82  and well-being.83  Even 
poor  sleep  was  linked  to  self-stigma,  which  could  also 
affect  quality  of  life.84  A  decrease  of  stigma  stress  pre-
dicted improved well-being at 1 year follow-up,85  and an 
increase  of  self-stigma  predicted  higher  levels  of 
demoralisation at 1 year follow-up.86  Adverse effects of 
experienced  stigma  were  shown  also  to  have  an  effect 
on  changes  in  symptoms  and  quality  of  life  at  18 
months  follow  up,  but  not  self-esteem,87  and  although 
cross-sectionally stereotype endorsement was related to 
emotional  distress,  there  was  no  association  in  the 
longitudinal design.88

Longitudinal  data  indicate  that  self-stigma  can 
impact  social  withdrawal  of  psychiatric  patients.89  In  a 
study  where  negative  symptoms  were  controlled  for, 
increased self-stigma predicted lower social functioning 
at 4 and 7 months follow-up in 39 people with schizo-
phrenia,  bipolar  disorder  and  depression.90  Addition-
ally,  reduction  in  self-stigma  positively  impacts  social 
adjustment,  predicting  changes  in  the  community

living skills of people with affective disorders over a 12- 
month period.91  In yet another study, it was shown that 
greater  self-stigma  can  be  associated  with  reduced  so-
cial  inclusion  at  5-month  follow-up  which  appeared  to 
be mediated by hopelessness.92

There  is  no  consistent  quantitative  evidence  on  the 
effect of  stigma  on education level, with  mixed  results 
showing  association  of  stigma  with  lower  education,93 
higher  education,94  or  no  association  at  all.95  Addition-
ally,  self-stigma  was  found  to  be  associated  with  low 
social  capital,96  lower  relational  satisfaction,97  and  poor 
parenting  experiences.98  Familial  expressed  emotions 
also  were  shown  to  be  associated  with  self-stigma  and 
experienced stigma.99

Qualitative studies mentioned stigma disrupting the 
education  progress  of  PWMI,  which  was  either  linked 
to  a  lack  of  supportive  accommodation  from  educa-
tional  institutions  or  withdrawal  from  educational  ac-
tivities due to anticipated discrimination.100,101

Several  qualitative  studies  reported  PWMI  experi-
encing  avoidance  from  family  members,  friends  and 
neighbours,54,68,102  feelings of shame by family members 
leading  to  exclusion,102–104  or  being  disowned  by  fam-
ily.105,106  PWMI  also  report  feeling  limited  in  contrib-
uting to household and financial decisions.71,102 A loss of 
social  contacts  after  disclosure  of  mental  illness  diag-
nosis  was  also  reported  as  avoidance  and,  in  some 
cases, shunning by friends. Relating to marriage, most 
studies described that  family  members  of  either  spouse 
were reluctant towards a marriage due to fear of herita-
bility of mental illness, or belief of increased violence of 
people  with  mental  illness.  This  often  resulted  in  diag-
nostic  concealment  when  marrying.54,70,107  Conversely, 
disclosure  of  mental  illness  diagnosis  may  result  in 
divorce.108  Stigma was also generally perceived to impact 
partner  selection  with  studies  reporting  reduced  pros-
pects for dating for PWMI as well as reduced pursuit of 
dating  by  PWMI  due  to  anticipated  stigma  and  related 
fears.54,69,71  Quantitative  evidence  also  report  on  stigma 
significantly  increasing  the  odds  of  engaging  in  risky 
sexual behaviour.109

In  qualitative  studies,  instances  of  abuse  and 
harassment were most frequently defined as verbal and 
physical humiliation or ridicule, including sexual abuse 
and  violence,107  and  beating  or  throwing  things  at 
PWMI.110  Often the abusers of PWMI were people from 
their  community  such  as  neighbour’s  and  family 
members.54  Physical  restriction  such  as  chaining  and 
locking  PWMI  up  is  not  uncommon.54,99  Forced  abor-
tion  due  to  stigmatizing  beliefs  regarding  heredity  of 
mental  illness  was  also  reported  as  a  consequence  of 
stigma.102,107  Three  studies  described  discrimination 
from  law  enforcement  where  participants  felt  dis-
credited  or  disbelieved  when  reporting  crime  to  law 
enforcement  officers,111  or  being  suspected  or  targeted 
due to their mental illness.112

Finally,  some  qualitative  studies  described  diffi-
culties  in  gaining  housing  due  to  stigma.  Loganathan 
et al. described a participant’s experience where parents 
refused  to  give  them  a  share  of  family  property,102 
similar  experiences  are  described  by  Mathias  et  al.113 
Other  studies  described  landlords  holding  stigmatis-
ing  attitudes  which  led  to  exclusion  from  property 
rentals or eviction.56,113

Studies with complex analysis or longitudinal design 
were  scarce  in  South  America,  South  and  West  Asia, 
Eastern  Europe  and Eastern  Africa.  See  Table  4 in  the 
Appendix  for  complete  distribution.  No  qualitative 
studies  on  psychosocial  consequences  were  found  in 
South  America  and  Western  Africa;  evidence  was  also 
scarce in Eastern Europe.

Longitudinal  data  indicate  that  stigma  is  associated 
with  self-esteem,  quality  of  life,  social  functioning,  so-
cial  withdrawal,  and  community  living  skills.  Cross- 
sectional  studies  associate  stigma  with  low  social 
capital,  poor  relational  satisfaction,  and  parenting  dif-
ficulties.  Qualitative  studies  describe  disrupted  educa-
tion,  social  exclusion,  family  avoidance,  relationship 
and  marriage  challenges,  experiences  of  abuse,  and 
barriers  to  housing.  Evidence  is  limited  in  South 
America, Western Africa, Eastern Europe, and parts of 
Asia.

Economic  domain  outcomes
In  one  longitudinal  study,  it  was  shown  that  greater 
self-stigma  can  be  associated  with  reduced  social  in-
clusion  and  vocational  activity  at  5-month  follow-up 
which  appeared  to  be  mediated  by  hopelessness.92 
This  echoes  results  by  Chien  et  al.,  who  showed  that 
reduction in self-stigma positively predicted changes in 
the community living skills including work-life of peo-
ple with affective disorders over a 12-month period.91

Most  studies  showed 

that  stigma  negatively 
impacted employment in multiple ways,108,114  one study 
found no relationship between stigma and employment 
status.95  In  an  experimental  study  fictitious  candidates 
with  reported  mental  illness  history  received  signifi-
cantly  less  callbacks  from  their  job  applications  then 
candidates with physical illness history.28  However, in a 
different experiment, number of received callbacks did 
not  differ  between  applications  with  year  workplace 
inactivity  due  to  depression  and  applications  with  un-
explained reasons for such inactivity.115

In qualitative studies PWMI report less employment 
opportunities when disclosing mental health illness in 
job applications, and even not being able to secure a job 
as  a  result.54,58,75,107,116  Other  studies  also  mentioned 
they  disclosed  mental 
PWMI  being  fired  once 
illness.117,118  Within  the  workforce,  self-stigma  and 
experienced  stigma  were  also  shown  to  be  associated 
with lower income and financial difficulties,114 as well as 
perceived  public  stigma  linked  to  work  and  social

has consequences on both, the importance of work they 
are assigned to and when seeking approval for medical 
leave  or  time  off  to  visit  mental  healthcare  pro-
fessionals.68,117  The  main  impacts  of  co-worker  stigma 
was  bullying  in  the  workplace  and  social  distancing 
leading  to  sharing  less  exposure  to  collaboration  and 
opportunities in their career.105  Finally, financial strain

Stigma is associated with reduced vocational activity 
and  social  inclusion  in  some  longitudinal  studies. 
Cross-sectional  studies  indicate  mixed  findings  with 
some  negative  effects  on  employment,  though  some 
report no association. Qualitative studies report reduced 
employment  opportunities,  job  loss  after  disclosure, 
lower income, workplace bullying, and financial strain.

Structural  domain  outcomes
Structural  outcomes  were  found  only  in  qualitative 
studies, with legal issues appearing first. Some studies 
attributed  the  existence  of  discriminatory 
laws  a 
consequence  of  stigma  in  society.  Such  laws  often 
either  deemed  PWMI  as  incapable  of  autonomous 
decision-making  or  used  derogatory  and/or  inaccurate 
language.116,117,119  Furthermore,  negative  perceptions  of 
PWMI (often related to perceived dangerousness) were 
used as  justification  for  court-based  custody  decisions. 
In  some  studies,  PWMI  also  perceived  stigma  as  the 
reason

services.99,120,121

Four  studies  explored  stigma  in  the  media,  all  of 
which  described  participants’  belief  that  public  stigma 
fuels negative imagery of PWMI.53,56,104,116  The impact of 
stigma  on  service  user  involvement  was  examined  in 
two studies, both indicating that anticipated stigma and 
fear  of  not  being  heard  or  understood  is  a  barrier  to 
service  user 
in  policy  making  and 
advocacy.122,123

Poor  quality  of  mental  healthcare  services  was  also 
reported as an example of structural stigma, as well as 
low  financing  resulting  in  inadequate  coverage  of  ser-
vices  and  deficits  in  resources  available,  for  example 
medication.120,124

Finally,  one  study  from  Northern  Europe  reported 
on the impacts of perceived and experienced stigma on 
accessing  state  benefits.  Participants  reported  that  the 
process in which state benefits for PWMI must be ob-
tained  was  deeply  stigmatizing,  for  example,  the  lan-
guage used in the forms suggested that PWMI are not 
capable of deciding or living on their own.125

The studies within this domain came only from the 
following  regions:  Western,  Eastern  and  Southern 
Europe,  Western  Africa  and  Southern  Africa,  Eastern 
Africa,  Northern  America  and  South-East  Asia.  For 
other regions, no studies were found.

Qualitative  studies  report  stigma  contributing  to 
discriminatory  laws,  legal  disadvantages,  negative  me-
dia  representation,  limited  service-user  involvement, 
poor-quality  and  underfunded  mental  healthcare,  and 
barriers to accessing state benefits. Evidence is available 
only  from  Europe,  Africa,  North  America,  and  South- 
East Asia.

Discussion
This  review  analysed  448  studies  on  the  negative  out-
comes of mental health stigma, categorized into health, 
service use, psychosocial, economic, and structural do-
mains.  Our  findings  highlight  that  while  stigma  is 
strongly  associated  with  numerous  adverse  outcomes, 
the causal pathways linking stigma to outcomes remain 
poorly substantiated across all domains. With 56% (250 
out of 448) of the reviewed studies being cross-sectional 
and  only  7%  (32  out  of  448)  and  8%  (37  out  of  448) 
longitudinal  and  path  analysis  with  mixed  findings, 
most  evidence  reflects  correlations  rather  than  causa-
tion, suggesting the need to critically consider strategies 
that  primarily  target  negative  attitudes  toward  people 
with  mental  health  conditions  to  mitigate  stigma’s 
impact.  The  complex  relationship  between  stigma  and 
specific outcomes and broader domains require a more 
nuanced 
effective 
interventions.

Measuring  stigma  is  inherently  challenging,  as  it 
encompasses diverse constructs, including beliefs, at-
titudes,  and  cultural  contexts.126  Much  of  the  existing 
evidence  base,  particularly  for  structural  outcomes 
relies on qualitative research (34%; i.e. 154 out of 448 
of  included  studies  were  qualitative),  which,  while 
valuable  for  conceptualizing  stigma,  is  limited  in 
clarifying  causal  relationships.127  Similarly,  most 
quantitative  studies  use  cross-sectional  designs,  mak-
ing  it  difficult  to  infer  causality  or  directionality  be-
tween  stigma  and  domain  outcomes.  Mediating 
factors,  such  as  symptom  severity  and  self-efficacy, 
often  complicate  these  relationships,  as  seen  in  asso-
ciations  between  stigma  and  help-seeking  or  suici-

and  while 

advanced 

Longitudinal  and  experimental  studies,  though 
scarce,  provide  stronger  evidence  for  stigma’s  impact 
on  health  and  psychosocial  domain  outcomes, 
including  self-esteem,  quality  of  life,  and  social  with-
drawal.  However,  research  on  the  structural  domain, 
operationalized  as  systemic  discrimination  embedded 
in  institutions,  is  particularly  underdeveloped,  with 
only 13 qualitative studies identified and no quantitative 
research. This gap is critical, as structural stigma affects 
entire populations and requires greater investigation to 
understand its broad societal implications.

studies  examining  intended  behaviours  toward  people 
with mental illness, this area represents a large portion 
of  stigma  related  research.  Therefore,  a  limitation  of 
our  results  is  a  focus  on  measurable  consequences  of 
stigma therefore excluding intended behaviour.

Finally,  while  some  longitudinal  studies  suggest 
associations  between  stigma  and  adverse  outcomes, 
heterogeneity in study populations, control at baseline, 
follow-up  durations,  and  analytic  rigor  limited  our 
ability to draw strong causal inferences. Future research 
should  prioritize  greater  diagnostic  specificity,  dis-
aggregated  analysis  of  subgroups  by  age,  geographic 
diversity,  particularly  from  low-  and  middle-income 
countries,  and  methodological  consistency  to  clarify 
when  and  how  stigma  causally  affects  mental  health 
outcomes.

Our  findings  reveal  that,  except  for  the  negative 
effects of  self-stigma, the evidence supporting stigma 
as  a  direct  cause  of  social  disadvantages  remains 
limited.  While  stigma  is  often  broadly  linked  to 
negative  outcomes,  the  empirical  foundation  for 
claims  of  causality  is  still  weak.  Efforts  to  address 
stigma  must  distinguish  between  attitudes  and  be-
haviours,  focusing  on  reducing  discrimination  while

on how stigma’s consequences develop and how best to 
mitigate  them.128  The  lack  of  evidence  from  low-  and 
middle-income  countries  (LMICs),  where  85%  of  the

Current evidence often attributes negative outcomes 
to 
exclusively 
acknowledge that such outcomes may co-occur with, be 
mediated  and/or  be  influenced  by,  intersecting  factors 
such as unemployment or other forms of marginaliza-
tion, rather than being solely caused by stigma.129,130 The 
impacts  of  stigma  may  compound  over-time,  such  as 
self-labeling81  and  public  stigma  perceptions,131  can 
exacerbate  its  effects,  highlighting  the  need  for  longi-
tudinal research to unravel these dynamics within and 
across  all  domains  included  in  this  study.  Addressing 
these  gaps  is  crucial  for  advancing  evidence-based 
public  health  decision-making 
and  optimizing 
resource  allocation  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  for 
PWMI globally.

This  review’s  broad  scope  enabled  an  inclusive 
exploration  of  the  consequences  of  mental  illness 
stigma across diverse outcomes, without imposing pre- 
existing  frameworks.  This  approach  allowed  for  a 
comprehensive  synthesis  of  findings  across  mental 
health  conditions  and  study  designs.  However,  several 
limitations must be acknowledged. As a scoping review, 
we  did  not  systematically  assess  the  methodological 
quality  of  included  studies.  We  also  excluded  random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs), given the methodological 
difficulty  of 
isolating  stigma-specific  effects  from 
broader intervention outcomes. We also did not include 
studies  on  stigma  related  to  completed  suicides,  sub-
stance  use  disorders,  or  eating  disorders,  which  may 
involve  distinct  stigma  processes;  future  research 
should  explore  the  consequences  of  stigma  in  these 
important  areas of  mental  health.  Additionally,  we  did 
not differentiate between self-stigma, perceived stigma, 
and  public  stigma,  which  represents  an  important 
avenue for future research.

Additionally,  categorizing  stigma  measures  (e.g., 
self-stigma,  public  stigma)  was  challenging  due  to 
overlapping  constructs,  and  grouping  all  mental  ill-
nesses  under  a  single  label  may  have  underestimated 
stigma’s  impact  on  more  severe  conditions.  Although 
most  included  studies  focused  on  depression  and
