Smartphones and social media have become an integral part of human daily life and they influence 
mental well-being. These accounts have been researched in the general population, but not in 
athletes. This is critical given enhanced physical and emotional stressors in athletes versus non-
athletes. Therefore, we here studied intra- and interindividual relationships of four social media sites 
(WhatsApp, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat) with mood, stress, recovery, and sleep using log-based 
media usage tracking as an objective measure in 53 competitive athletes aged 12–27 years. Multilevel 
modeling revealed that intraindividual TikTok usage negatively predicted sleep (β = −0.10, p = 0.040) 
and recovery (β = −0.15, p < 0.002), and positively predicted stress (β = 0.12, p = 0.018). Interindividual 
Instagram usage predicted feelings of calmness (β = 0.27, p = 0.029) and valence (β = 0.20, p = 0.043). 
Intriguingly, competition level moderated the usage outcomes of all four apps: Athletes on low 
performance levels showed lower mental well-being when using social media longer, yet in national 
and international athletes the strength of these relationships was weaker or even reversed. Our study 
unravels social media usage associations with mental well-being to vary as a function of performance 
level and provides findings on intra- and interindividual effects of critical importance to inform future 
population-tailored and expedient interventions.

Digital  media  impact  mental  health  in  adolescents  and  young  adults  alike1.  In  a  meta-analysis,  Vidal  et  al.2 
reported an association between quantity of media usage and depressive mood in adolescents. Likewise, time 
spent on social media predicted higher social and physical anxiety, as well as depressive mood over 12 months3. 
In young athletes, digital media interact with a unique context. They face the challenge of combining several tasks 
and roles, e.g., school, training, recovery measures, and social life, demanding high energy and time resources4,5, 
while coping with additional stressors, e.g., pressure to perform or conflicts within a sport team. This may place 
athletes at a higher vulnerability of stress and mood disorders6. This may be particularly true for athletes on 
a  highly  competitive  performance  level,  as  in  addition  to  positive  effects  of  sport  observed  in  a  recreational 
setting,  straining  factors  such  as  performance  pressure  and  perfectionism  may  be  increased7,8.  Within  this 
context, dysfunctional digital media usage may constitute an additional stressor disturbing important means of 
recovery, such as sleep and emotional self-regulation9,10. Therefore, it is vital to gain an accurate insight into the 
relationship between mental health and smartphone activity in this population to help optimize athletes’ daily 
recovery and well-being. However, up to this point little is known about the relationship of mental health and 
digital media usage in adolescent and young adult athletes up to this point. Fiedler et al.10 found that mental 
health  in  12–19  year-old  athletes  was  decreased  when  they  showed  prolonged  usage  times  and  addiction  to 
digital media. Particularly on high performance levels, addiction to digital media was associated with impaired 
sleep. Walter et al.11 found a relationship between social media usage and eating disorders in young athletes.

Fiedler et al.10 suggest the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model (DSMM)12 as a multidimensional 
framework for understanding how digital media affect psychological outcomes in athletes. Originally developed 
outside of the sport context, the model makes two core assumptions. First, it states that media usage is influenced 
by the social, dispositional, and developmental context it takes place in. Within these context variables, labelled 
propositions, a person’s gender or age may be considered. Within the setting of sport, the model also offers the 
opportunity to include sport-specific context variables, such as an individual’s role and lifestyle as an athlete, that 
may influence both media usage13 and mental health6–8. In particular, a highly competitive or elite performance 
level may be associated with additional challenges, e.g., perfectionism or performance pressure, that may interact 
with media usage in influencing athletes’ mental health8. Second, the model assumes that in interaction with 
the propositions, digital media usage triggers specific cognitive, emotional, and physiological responses, which 
mediate the effects of media on psychological outcomes.

One mediating effect may be disturbed sleep14. Daily media usage longer than two hours decreases sleep 
duration  in  adolescents,  mediated  by  behavioral  (bedtime  procrastination  due  to  conflicting  goals)  and 
psychophysiological  reactions  (disrupted  circadian  rhythm,  increased  emotional  arousal)  to  media  usage15. 
Although sleep is highly relevant for their recovery, performance, and health, prevalence of sleep disturbances in 
athletes are high16,17. In adolescents, neurological development may exacerbate sleep disturbances18. Taking the 
role of a mediator, sleep impairments related to digital media lead to increased stress, negative emotionality, and 
anxiety, while lack of sleep decreases the ability to cope with daily stressors and challenges16.

Apart from sleep, social media may impact athletes’ mood, self-esteem, and anxiety19,20. One effect playing 
an  important  role  in  this  relationship  is  social  comparison,  both  regarding  physical  appearance  and  athletic 
performance13,21. This may  affect young athletes in particular,  as comparison to peers and role models gains 
importance throughout adolescence18. Further, quality of media usage may impact mood. When experienced 
as fulfilling e.g., through communication or emotional support, it improves mood22. However, if experienced 
as negative, e.g., through confrontation with negative comments or content23, it may impair mood and increase 
stress.

According  to  the  heuristic  scissors  model  of  the  interrelation  of  stress  states  and  recovery  demands24,25, 
physical  and  mental  stress  needs  to  be  compensated  through  adequate  recovery  activities.  Limited  resources 
(e.g., time) set a vicious cycle in motion: if the athlete is under increased stress and unable to fulfil the increased 
recovery demands, they experience even more stress. People can be so stressed that they do not find or take 
time to recover adequately or think of better ways to cope with the situation26. Therefore, if stress is increased 
through dysfunctional media usage in athletes, it can be expected that recovery effects are reduced, as they do 
not sufficiently compensate for the mental and physical stress the athlete experiences. Factors such as bedtime 
procrastination or time conflicts through an overuse of digital media may disturb recovery measures15,17. Again, 
recovery may be unsuccessful and cause negative emotions if the activity is evaluated as unfulfilling9.

Previous  studies  revealed  cross-sectional  relationships  between  digital  media  and  mental  health  in  the 
general  population,  young  adult,  and  adolescent  athletes1,10,19.  However,  these  studies  yielded  heterogenous 
results and oftentimes small effect sizes. In part, this may be attributed to methodological issues. First, effects 
of social media in athletes may differ between social networks19. Rozgonjuk et al.27 name Instagram, WhatsApp 
Messenger, Snapchat, and TikTok as the most relevant platforms to young people. TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp, 
and  Snapchat  all  include  direct  messaging  and  the  possibility  to  upload  visual,  user  generated  content  with 
temporary visibility (24 h). While WhatsApp and similar apps (e.g., Signal, Telegram) include limited functions 
to upload permanently visible content, they do not focus on it. On Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat the feature 
is more prominent. Additionally, these three platforms include a feed of suggested content personalized by an 
algorithm, that is not available in WhatsApp or other messengers.

Instagram  holds  a  special  position  for  branding  and  self-presentation  in  sports28.  However,  particularly 
comparison with others on this platform has been associated with negative body image and disordered eating 
behavior29. While Instagram’s start page prompts users to interact with content of users they subscribe to, the 
focus of TikTok is on the feed of personalized content created by the site’s algorithm instead39. Montag et al.31 
suggest this leads to stronger immersion into the site. This may increase addictive potential as a driving factor 
of  negative  associations  between  media  usage  and  mental  health32.  Montag  et  al.31  add  that  TikTok  centers 
interaction between the user and the algorithm, instead of an interaction between users. As communication and 
emotional support through social networks is associated with improved mental health22 this may be another 
problematic aspect about TikTok. This suggests TikTok may have a higher risk of detrimental effects on well-
being than the other platforms.

When  measuring  media  usage,  the  most  common  measure  is  self-reported  data.  However,  Ellis  et  al.33 
criticize that self-reported smartphone usage has a risk of being unreliable. As an alternative, technology-based 
approaches like smartphone activity log-tracking can be utilized34. However, being relatively resource-intensive 
to implement, few studies have applied log-based usage tracking to examine the relationship between mental 
health and smartphone usage yet. This problem is particularly prevalent in research on competitive and elite 
athletes, where the few studies examining the relationship between digital media and mental health in athlete 
populations either relied on measures of self-report10,19 or followed a qualitative approach13. In addition, their 
cross-sectional design holds the risk of falsely interfering from group level data to an individual35. A prominent 
example  depicts  this  well-known  issue  of  drawing  within-person  inference  from  cross  sectional  data,  coined 
“ecological  fallacy”:  For  instance,  cross-sectional  studies  demonstrate  that  individuals  who  engage  in  higher 
levels of physical activity tend to have consistently lower blood pressure, indicating a negative correlation between 
subjects. However, this design would not show a positive within subject correlation that may be expected since 
acute physical activity, like stair climbing, can cause an increase in blood pressure36,37. As Reichert et al.38 point 
out this may explain mixed findings in psychological studies—for an in-depth discussion see36,39–41. However, 
to plan effective interventions, it is necessary to properly distinguish between effects on group and individual

level. In the context of smartphone usage and mental health, this means distinguishing intraindividual effects 
from  cross-sectional  relationships  between  participants.  Conceptually,  intraindividual  effects  describe  the 
impact of usage differences within an individual across a defined time span, e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, yearly. 
When referring to a short time span, they could also be understood as short-term effects of media usage. The 
differentiation between intraindividual and interindividual effects may be achieved using intensive longitudinal 
data (timely dense, e.g., daily, repeated within-subject measurements)42.

Objectives and hypotheses
Although digital media and their impact on mental well-being in both athletes and the general population is a 
highly relevant and current topic, studies examining this topic often face methodological issues, such as a lack of 
detailed or objective measurements, as well as the risk of an ecological fallacy. The current study contributes to 
strengthening research on this topic by measuring smartphone usage in young athletes using a log-based tracking 
approach. Further, this study aimed to distinguish between effects of different social media applications to allow 
for  a  more  precise  understanding  of  which  aspects  of  media  usage  may  be  beneficial  or  harmful  to  athletes, 
which  may  have  substantial  implications  for  both  research  and  practice  within  this  field.  In  a  first  step,  the 
relationship between mental well-being and application usage will be analyzed from a bidirectional perspective. 
Based on the assumption that competitive sport, and especially the setting of elite-level sport, is associated with 
a distinct set of challenges and may therefore interact with media usage effects, competition level will be entered 
into  the  analysis  in  a  second  step  to  test  for  differences  between  competitive  elite  and  recreational  athletes. 
Of note, in our study and following the well-established and recognized theoretical framework of Keyes43, we 
understand mental health as a dual continuum with the interrelated, but distinguishable dimensions of mental 
illness and mental well-being. While mental illness refers to psychopathology, mental well-being relates to mood 
states, psychological needs and optimal functioning43. Within this model, we here investigate the core factors 
mood, stress, recovery and sleep taking a predominantly well-being perspective.

Therefore, this paper aims to test the following hypotheses.

 Usage of messenger apps, Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat predict mood, sleep, stress, and recovery intra- 
and interindividually. A negative relationship between application usage and mental health is expected for 
TikTok and Instagram, while no directional predictions can be made for Snapchat and messenger apps.

Methods
Design and procedure
Statistical power analyses of multi-level models heavily depend on a variety of assumptions (e.g., random slopes, 
covariance structure) that cannot be estimated without the final data set. Therefore, it was tested whether the 
aspired sample size of N = 50–80 participants was adequate for detecting the predicted effects based on recent 
simulation  studies44.  According  to  simulation  studies,  N = 50–80  is  sufficient  to  find  a  medium  minimum 
detectable effect size (MDES = 0.30) in a two-level model, assuming a medium random slope component and a 
level 1 sample size of at least 14 at a power of 80%.

The study used log-based tracking of smartphone data. Data collection took place over 16 days, including 
14 days of continuously tracking participants’ smartphone activity, resulting in detailed measures for each day 
during this period. The length of the tracking period was chosen as a tradeoff between extensive data collection 
and practicability. Data was exported after the tracking period had ended. During tracking, all participants were 
instructed not to look at their media activity to avoid a bias in usage behavior.

One day prior to the start of the tracking period, the first questionnaire was distributed via the web app SoSci 
Survey (www.soscisurvey.de), asking for participants’ demographic and athletic information (e.g., gender, age, 
training duration, competition level). In addition, they generated a pseudonym to later match their questionnaires 
with their tracking data. During the tracking period, participants received a link to a daily questionnaire every 
morning at 5:00 a.m. with the instruction to complete it before noon. It took about two minutes to complete 
and contained the identical three short scales measuring the current mood, perceived quality of sleep in the 
previous night, as well as stress and recovery every day. On the last day, participants were asked to fill out a final 
questionnaire of about five minutes and were instructed to export their usage data. Data files were labeled with 
the pseudonym created on the first day of the study and transmitted to the researchers anonymously via the app 
Dropbox (www.dropbox.com). The final questionnaire included information on unusual events (e.g., prolonged 
sickness, competitions) during the tracking period to enable control for biased media usage behavior or mental 
health states. No participants needed to be excluded based on this data (Fig. 1).

Ethical considerations
Prior to the study, all participants gave their written informed consent to participation in the study. For subjects 
younger than 18 years, informed consent from their parents was obtained in written form as well. The study was 
approved by the institutional ethical committee (Ethical Committee of the Ruhr University Bochum, Faculty of 
Sport Science). The research was performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations45.

Sample
Initially,  58  athletes  participated  in  the  study.  A  convenience  sample  was  acquired  among  the  project’s 
cooperation partners (multiple sport federations, teams and clubs throughout Germany). Potential participants

were informed about the study through an online flyer and in the following were able to sign up to the study. 
Five participants had to be excluded, as they did not fill out the initial questionnaire. As they did not generate a 
pseudonym their smartphone activity and self-report data could not be assigned to each other. Of the remaining 
53 participants, 14 were female and 39 were male. Their age ranged from 12 to 27 years (M = 18.12, SD = 3.62). 
The majority of athletes played a team sport (n = 37), participating in either water ball, basketball, handball, or 
soccer. The most frequent sports in individual athletes were athletics and rowing. Following a review by Swann et 
al.46, competition level (none, informal/local, regional, supra-regional, national, and international) was chosen 
as a measure for athletic performance. Eleven participants reported taking part in informal/local competitions 
only or not competing at all. Nine participants reported competing in regional or supra-regional championships. 
Of the other subjects, 22 competed on a national and eleven on an international level. Athletes on national level 
or higher (n = 33) were classified as elite athletes. For the analysis performance levels were aggregated to elite 
(competing on national level or higher) and non-elite level (competing lower than national level). To exclude a 
bias through unusual events during the tracking period, participants were asked on the last day whether their 
training,  mental  well-being,  or  media  usage  differed  significantly  from  the  previous  weeks.  No  participants 
needed to be excluded based on this data. The relative distribution of male and female athletes across team and 
individual sports, as well as across aggregated performance level was even.

Measures
To  examine  daily  intraindividual  changes,  as  well  as  interindividual  differences,  measures  of  mental  health 
needed to be suited as both trait and state variables. Of the variables previously indicated to relate to digital 
media15,19,47, sleep quality, mood, stress, and recovery met this criterion. Following Reichert et al.38, measures 
needed to satisfy two additional criteria. First, the instruments needed to be adequately sensitive to change and 
refer to the current moment, rather than to a longer period of time. Second, they needed to be very economic 
to avoid the daily questionnaire being too long, thereby risking the loss of participant compliance. Cronbach’s 
Alpha in the current study is reported over all individuals and measuring points.

Mood
Mood was assessed by the six-item short form of the Multimodal Mood Questionnaire (MMQ)47,48. Originally 
measuring valence, energetic arousal, and calmness with twelve items, the six-item short form was validated by 
Wilhelm and Schoebi49 and comprises two items per scale. It is highly sensitive to change, making it suitable 
to measure current mood states. Wilhelm and Schoebi49 reported an acceptable Cronbach’s Alpha of α = 0.70—
0.77.  In  the  current  study  Cronbach’s  Alpha  was  α = 0.814  for  energetic  arousal,  α = 0.805  for  calmness,  and 
α = 0.831 for valence.

Recovery and stress
The  Short  Recovery  and  Stress  Scale  (SRSS)50,51  consists  of  eight  items  and  has  been  derived  from  the  eight 
scales  of  the  Acute  Recovery  and  Stress  Scale  (ARSS)50,51  which  were  then  grouped  into  the  Short  Recovery 
Scale [Physical Performance Capability, Mental Performance Capability, Emotional Balance, Overall Recovery] 
and the Short Stress Scale [Muscular Stress, Lack of Activation, Negative Emotional State, Overall Stress]. The 
internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) for the SRSS ranges between α = 0.78 and α = 0.84. In the manual, Kellmann 
and Kölling50,51 report good sensitivity to change, good convergent validity, and homogeneity for its two scales. 
In the current study Cronbach’s Alpha was α = 0.735 for stress and α = 0.857 for recovery.

Sleep
Sleep was assessed by items of an adapted version of the Evening-Morning-Protocol52 and its short version53. The 
Evening-Morning-Protocol is a common measure in Germanophone sleep research that shows good validity 
and reliability. The adapted six-item scale has been developed by a research group in the authors’ lab as part of 
a screening tool for recovery and immunological stress reactions and aims to measure subjective sleep quality 
in the next morning particularly in adolescent and young adult athletes. While currently under evaluation, it 
displays good validity and reliability. In the current study, Cronbach’s Alpha was α = 0.823. The medium sized 
intercorrelation with recovery and stress (Table 2) indicate good criterion validity.

Smartphone activity data
The  procedure  to  track  smartphone  activity  slightly  differed  between  operating  systems.  Android  users  were 
provided with the app App Usage from the Google Play Store. This app runs in the background and allows for 
detailed tracking of several parameters such as time spent on an app or how often the smartphone got unlocked 
every day. For iOS, neither App Usage nor a similar app could be employed, as iOS devices do not allow for third 
party apps to access data on smartphone usage. Thus, smartphone activity for iOS users was measured using the 
data from the inbuilt Screentime app. This held the disadvantage that participants needed to manually screenshot 
their usage data to export them. Compared to Screentime, App Usage presents data in a less aggregated fashion 
and would have allowed for a more detailed analysis of usage parameters. However, as only few Android users 
participated, data analysis was limited to the parameters comparable in Screentime and App Usage.

Following Rozgonjuk et al.27 data was extracted for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, and messenger apps. The 
category of messenger apps included WhatsApp Messenger, as well as the structurally and functionally similar 
apps Signal and Telegram. While Rozgonjuk et al.27 also name Facebook as one of the most popular platforms, 
only two participants used Facebook in our sample, which is why this platform was excluded from the analysis. 
Further, apps were considered for analysis if used by more than 50% of participants at least once. However, no 
app other than the ones already extracted satisfied this condition.

Data analysis
Data analysis was conducted in IBM SPSS v.27. Descriptive statistics were calculated for media usage and mental 
well-being. To analyze relationships between smartphone usage and mental well-being, multilevel linear models 
were applied. In the first step, psychological well-being measured in the morning of each day was predicted from 
the time spent on an app the previous day. In the following, these predictors will be referred to as lead values. To 
determine whether changes in mental health follow, or rather precede media usage, app usage of the following 
day was also included. In the following these predictors will be referred to as lag values. Parameters for all models 
were estimated using a maximum likelihood approach.

Level  1  represented  intraindividual  differences  to  examine  if  psychological  well-being  differed  within  an 
individual between days on which smartphone usage was longer or shorter. Level 1 predictors were each day’s 
time spent on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, and messengers, for both the day preceding and following the daily 
questionnaire. Level 1 variables were centered around the subjects’ mean to differentiate within-person from 
between-person effects, as well as to avoid intercorrelation between the lead and lag values. Level 2 represented 
interindividual differences, examining if individuals who use smartphone apps more differ in their psychological 
well-being from individuals who use their smartphone less. The predictors on level 2 represented the individual 
mean times spent using the respective apps over the whole tracking period. Mood components, sleep, stress, and 
recovery were included as dependent variables, resulting in a total of six models.

In  the  second  step,  interactions  between  intraindividual  and  interindividual  app  usage  and  participants’ 
performance level were tested. To keep the analysis feasible, only the interindividual means and the lead values, 
but not the lag values were included into this set of models. Following the suggestions of Swann et al.46, athletes 
were  split  into  an  elite  performance  level  (those  competing  on  a  national  level  or  higher)  and  a  non-elite 
performance level (those competing lower than national level) (Fig. 2).

Results
Descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics regarding digital media and mental well-being are displayed in Table 1.

Out of 53 participants, 52 used a messenger app and 51 used Instagram at least once. TikTok was used by 37 
and Snapchat by 44 people. One participant used neither of these four apps. Table 2 displays the intercorrelations 
between the study variables’ individual means. TikTok showed a negative correlation (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) with 
Instagram and a positive correlation to Snapchat (r = 0.54, p < 0.001). Competition level was related positively 
to Instagram.

Multilevel analysis
The relationship between digital media and mental well-being was examined using multilevel models. In the 
lead models, intraclass correlation coefficients were QI = 0.539 for sleep, QI = 0.549 for recovery, QI = 0.518 for 
stress, QI = 0.261 for energetic arousal, QI = 0.490 for calmness, and QI = 0.400 for valence. For example, this 
means that for energetic arousal 46.1% of variance (1-0.539 = 0.461) can be attributed to within-subject variance. 
The full parameters for each model can be found in the supplement. To ensure robustness of the results against 
imbalances in the sample, gender and team vs. individual sports were tested as control variables. This did not 
significantly alter the results.

Analysis of main effects
Results for TikTok
Between participants, TikTok usage does not predict mental well-being. Within participants, TikTok negatively 
predicted quality of sleep (F(1, 209.0) = 4.29, p = 0.040, B = -0.004, CI [-0.008, -0.001], β = -0.10) and recovery 
within  participants  (F(1,  209.7) = 10.12,  p = 0.002,  B = -0.006,  CI  [-0.010,  -0.002],  β = -0.15),  while  positively 
predicting stress (F(1, 213.4) = 5.66, p = 0.018, B = 0.005, CI [0.001, 0.010], β = 0.12). Only mood components 
were not related to TikTok. In tendency, the lag value for TikTok was positively related to stress. However, this 
effect was not significant.

Results for Instagram
Interindividual  effects  were  found  for  the  relationship  between  Instagram  and  calmness  (F(1,  31.0) = 5.27, 
p = 0.029,  B = 0.018,  CI  [0.002,  0.034],  β = 0.27),  as  well  as  valence  (F(1,  31.0) = 4.45,  p = 0.043,  B = 0.013,  CI 
[0.001, 0.027], β = 0.20). This indicates that participants who used Instagram more had higher calmness and 
valence on average. A positive but insignificant tendency was observed for recovery and energetic arousal. The 
lag value was positively related to sleep, indicating that Instagram usage was higher following nights with good 
sleep (F(1, 201.2) = 3.89, p = 0.050, B = 0.003, CI [0.001, 0.005], β = 0.09). Positive tendencies occurred between 
the lag value and energetic arousal and valence.

Results for Messengers
No  interindividual  relationships  were  observed  between  messengers  and  well-being.  However,  a  positive 
tendency was observed for valence. The lag value was negatively related to sleep, indicating that messengers were 
used less following nights of good sleep (F(1, 195.7) = 7.91, p = 0.005, B = -0.005, CI [-0.009, -0.002], β = 0.12). 
The lead value displayed a negative, but non-significant tendency towards a relationship with stress.

Results for Snapchat
No  significant  effects  were  found  for  mental  well-being  and  Snapchat.  In  tendency,  interindividual  usage  of 
Snapchat was negatively related to energetic arousal.

Analysis of interaction effects
Results for TikTok
A  significant  interaction  was  found  between  intraindividual  TikTok  usage  and  performance  level  (F(1, 
233.1) = 5.02, p = 0.026, B = 0.007, CI [0.001, 0.014], β = 0.11) for recovery, indicating a slightly stronger negative 
relationship between TikTok and recovery on a low, than on a high performance level (Fig. 3).

Results for Instagram
On  an  interindividual  level,  Instagram  interacted  significantly  with  performance  level  for  sleep  (F(1, 
30.80) = 4.56, p = 0.041, B = 0.021, CI [0.001, 0.042], β = 0.791), recovery (F(1, 30.74) = 5.10, p = 0.041, B = 0.021, 
CI [0.001, 0.042], β = 0.783), and energetic arousal (F(1, 26.39) = 8.12, p = 0.008, B = 0.021, CI [0.017, 0.105], 
β = 0.843). This indicates a positive relationship between mental health and Instagram usage in athletes on a high 
performance level, while on a low performance level a negative relationship occurred. Within participants, no 
significant effects were found. Only a positive but non-significant tendency was observed for recovery (Fig. 4).

Results for Messengers
Interindividual  messenger  usage  interacted  significantly  with  performance  level  for  energetic  arousal  (F(1, 
28.70) = 5.30,  p = 0.029,  B = 0.077,  CI  [0.009,  0.146],  β = 0.685)  and  valence  (F(1,  31.44) = 5.43,  p = 0.026, 
B = 0.063,  CI  [0.008,  0.119],  β = 0.647).  In  tendency,  all  athletes’  energetic  arousal  increased  with  messenger 
usage, but this effect was stronger in high- compared to lower-performance athletes. Between subjects, valence 
and messenger usage were related negatively in athletes on a low performance level, but positively in athletes on 
a high performance level (Fig. 5).

Results for Snapchat
A  significant  interaction  occurred  between  mean  Snapchat  usage  and  energetic  arousal  (F(1,  55.4) = 11.00, 
p = 0.002, B = 0.053, CI [0.001, 0.053], β = 0.979) as well as valence (F(1, 41.20) = 4.27, p = 0.045, B = 0.027, CI 
[0.002, 0.085], β = 0.592). This indicates that both athletes on a low and high performance level descriptively 
showed a decrement in energetic arousal and valence when using Snapchat more. However, this relationship was 
stronger in athletes on a low performance level (Fig. 6).

Discussion
All three hypotheses were partly confirmed. In accordance with previous findings in athletes10,13, longer TikTok 
usage was related to impaired recovery and sleep, as well as higher stress within participants. Montag et al.31 
suggest that unlike other social media, TikTok focuses on users’ own content, as well as a feed of personalized 
content  selected  by  the  app’s  algorithm.  When  overusing  TikTok,  aspects  of  social  media  promoting  mental 
health, e.g., the connection with others, may be neglected22. Further, high personalization and immersion into a 
social network might engender addictive tendencies, leading to overuse31 and possibly bedtime procrastination15. 
Sleep being an important form of recovery17, its negative association with TikTok within subjects contributes to 
explaining the negative relationship between TikTok and recovery.

Recovery  may  be  viewed  as  a  key  component,  as  it  is  significantly  related  to  TikTok  across  performance 
levels. Kellmann et al.25 define recovery as not solely a passive, but pro-active process determined by individuals’ 
decisions and directly shaping their free time. To recover successfully, it is necessary to distance oneself from 
previous activities and select a suitable recovery strategy. TikTok usage may disturb the step of distancing when 
continued  in  favor  of  a  suitable  strategy  and  in  consequence  hinder  the  recovery  process31,56.  Alternatively, 
TikTok itself may be selected as a recovery strategy, but may not succeed. Reasons may be inherent aspects of 
viewed content (e.g., confrontation with content causing negative emotions)23, consequences of excessive usage 
(e.g., exacerbated time conflicts in young athletes)5, or meta-cognitive evaluations of usage (e.g., anger at oneself, 
when past usage is experienced as a waste of time)9. Although these effects did not reach significance for the lag 
values, it is indicated there may be a positive, bidirectional relationship between TikTok and stress. This may be 
attributed to both indirect effects on recovery5,9,31, as well as on direct stress caused by TikTok through increased 
cognitive and emotional negative arousal55,56. This holds the danger of a vicious cycle, causing further increment

in stress and decrement in recovery. These findings may be highly relevant to athletes aiming to optimize their 
recovery.

Instagram usage was positively related to calmness and valence on an interindividual level. This contradicts 
previous  findings  reporting  an  increment  of  negative  affect  with  usage  of  social  media  in  athletes10.  An 
explanation  may  be  the  moderate  duration  of  media  usage  observed  in  the  current  study.  This  would  imply 
an inversely U-shaped, instead of a strictly linear relationship between media usage duration and mental well-
being, indicating both very low and very high media usage durations may be associated with impaired mental 
health. From a positive perspective, Instagram may be a mean of recovery, a pass-time, or a tool to communicate 
with  family  and  friends4,22.  Seen  negatively,  it  may  be  associated  with  addictive  behavior,  unfavorable  social 
comparison, or a lack of alternative interests10.

Both the lag values for Instagram and messengers were significantly related to sleep of the previous day. This 
effect was negative for messengers, and positive for Instagram, indicating that following nights of good sleep 
messengers were used less, and Instagram was used more. An association with weekends or other free days may 
be assumed, leaving more time for leisure social media usage, but possibly also to meet others in person than 
through the phone and a reduced need to use messengers for functional communication (e.g., organizational 
purposes)4,22. Although its focus on one-on-one communication may have suggested the opposite22 no main 
effect was found between the lead value of messenger apps and mental well-being. Again, communication on 
messenger apps may not only serve the motive of connection but also be of functional or organizational nature4, 
suggesting effects of messenger usage may strongly depend on its purpose. This may also be true for Snapchat, 
either focusing on exchanging short videos with friends (increasing similarity to messengers) or in consuming 
other users’ content (increasing similarity to TikTok). For Snapchat, no significant main effects were found at 
all. Notably, messenger apps and Snapchat displayed shorter usage times than Instagram and TikTok, indicating 
they may be less prominent in young athletes’ usage behavior. For messengers, this is backed up by Rozgonjuk 
et al.27 who found WhatsApp addiction scores were lower than addiction scores to other social networking sites, 
which may reduce negative effects between digital media and psychological well-being32.

Although  athletes  were  expected  to  be  more  vulnerable  to  detrimental  effects  of  media  usage  on  mental 
well-being5,6, the effects of all four apps’ usage were more favorable for elite, than non-elite athletes over all four 
social networking sites. For Instagram and messenger apps, the directions of the relationships changed, while 
for TikTok and Snapchat, the strength of the relationships changed depending on performance level. High-level 
athletes reported training longer and therefore may benefit from a protective effect of training. Mechanisms for 
an effect like this could either be physiological or psychological, e.g., by increased confidence through exercise57. 
A positive effect of exercise on mood may also act protectively against negative effects of media usage on mental 
well-being. This may be most applicable for within-subject TikTok usage and between-subject Snapchat usage, 
both  displaying  a  negative  relationship  between  app  usage  and  mental  well-being,  that  is  significantly  less 
pronounced in elite than in non-elite athletes, however.

Social  comparison  with  peers  and  celebrities  may  explain  both  Instagram’s  main  and  interaction  effects 
on  mood18.  While  social  comparison  can  improve  mental  well-being  when  following  the  goal  of  self-
improvement58, it also has been associated with impaired mental health, e.g., reduced self-esteem and negative 
affect in non-athletes22. Possibly, high-performance athletes use Instagram more functionally by seeking social 
comparisons motivating them to improve themselves. Additionally, the effect of social comparison on mental 
health is moderated by self-esteem22. Athletes may perceive themselves more positively compared to others on 
Instagram. However, this would conflict with the findings by Mancine et al.59 who found a higher prevalence 
of disordered eating in athletes than in non-athletes. Third, athletes may pursue other activities on Instagram, 
than their non-elite peers. Passive, rather than active usage of social networking sites is associated with impaired 
mental health60. For example, elite athletes may use Instagram more to present themselves and less to passively 
consume other users’ content.

Fiedler et al.10 found the lowest sleep quality in young elite athletes with high social media usage compared to 
elite athletes with shorter media usage and lower performing athletes with high media usage. The current study 
contradicts these findings. As mentioned previously, this may be explained with a low prevalence of excessive 
media usage in the current sample compared to Fiedler et al.10. Long media usage durations, particularly close to 
bedtime, may be more likely to interfere with athletes’ sleep given their narrower daily schedule5,15, while shorter 
media  usage  may  not  conflict  with  other  demands.  A  similar  explanation  can  be  applied  to  the  relationship 
between Instagram and recovery. Since recovery requires distancing from a previous activity to implement a 
selected  strategy9,  over  usage  of  social  media  may  interfere  with  recovery,  while  appropriate  usage  may  not. 
Again, this would point towards an inversed U-shaped relationship between the length of media usage in high 
performance  athletes  regarding  both  recovery  in  general  and  sleep  as  a  specific  form  of  recovery.  Assuming 
self-esteem, favorable social comparisons, and active, structured usage as mechanisms for a positive impact of 
Instagram on well-being in elite athletes, a risk would be in inversion of these effects when an athlete suffers from 
an injury, a major setback, or a decrement in performance. Further, particularly up-and-coming athletes who did 
not reach an elite level yet may be seen as a more vulnerable population to adverse effects of social media usage.
As  any  study,  the  current  study  holds  certain  limitations.  Complications  occurred  regarding  smartphone 
operation  systems,  as  usage  data  cannot  be  obtained  from  external  apps  in  iOS.  Since  iOS  devices  are  more 
prevalent than Android devices in the target population, a sample including only Android users would not have 
been representative. In making Android and iOS data comparable, the depth of usage data that was extracted 
needed to be limited, excluding more detailed aspects of each app’s usage, e.g., late night activity. Further, the 
activities  that  apps  are  used  for  would  be  of  interest,  e.g.,  if  they  were  used  actively  or  passively60  or  which 
motives  the  sites  were  used  for  (e.g.,  communication,  self-presentation,  coping).  However,  this  information 
would either require more invasive tracking methods or the usage of self-report. As either of these methods 
may reduce the objectivity of the electronically measured data and reduce compliance, it was refrained from

www.nature.com/scientificreports/

obtaining this information in the current study. However, future studies need to work with this tradeoff, since 
not only quantity, but also quality of media usage may impact mental well-being32.

Alongside a limited period of data availability in iOS, the more complicated procedure in iOS than in Android 
restricted  the  length  of  the  tracking  period. This  shifted  the  choice  of  constructs  regarding  mental  health  to 
aspects that can be expected to change within short periods of time and the conceptualization of mental health 
towards well-being rather than a clinical perspective. Further, this limits the representativeness of the tracking 
period for athletes’ season. Falling into early spring, the tracking period included late competition phase for 
team sport athletes, and early competition phase or late preparation phase for individual sport athletes. It cannot 
be fully excluded that media effects may differ between competition phases. Therefore, future studies should 
consider tracking usage over longer periods of time to expand the understanding of the relationship between 
app usage and mental well-being to the clinical aspect of mental health, e.g., disordered eating. However, this 
requires  a  more  efficient  method  of  exporting  data  from  iOS.  Alternatively,  multiple  tracking  periods  taking 
place in each competition phase should be implemented.

The current sample displayed certain imbalances. Although the analyses showed to be robust when including 
these variables as covariates, it should be considered that the study may represent some athlete subgroups better 
than  others.  First,  the  study  included  more  male  than  female  athletes.  This  may  pose  a  limitation  as  media 
effects  may  differ  between  genders  in  both  athletes  and  the  general  population62.  Specifically,  Nimiya  et  al. 
(2023) conclude that Instagram usage is associated with higher body image concerns in female users, while male 
athletes display more exercise motivation. Although this study refers to a sample of non-athletes, this indicates 
that particularly the positive association between Instagram usage and mood variables in elite athletes need to 
be validated in female athletes. Second, team sports were represented in the sample more strongly than were 
individual sports. Although media effects between team sport and individual athletes have not been examined 
yet, they have been shown to differ in mental health [64]. Again, future studies should aim to validate the current 
findings in individual athletes or even draw explicit comparisons between team and individual sports.

Finally, certain relationships between media usage and well-being may also be non-linear. Moderating effects 
of performance level support this notion. Therefore, future studies should consider testing for non-linear effects 
of smartphone usage on mental well-being.

Conclusion and practical implications
In  this  study,  Instagram  was  related  to  higher  calmness  between  participants,  while  TikTok  displayed  a 
bidirectional negative relationship with sleep, recovery, and stress within participants. The analysis of interaction 
effects revealed a distinct pattern between athletes competing nationally or internationally level and those on 
a  lower  performance  level.  Exempt  a  descriptively  positive  relationship  between  messengers  and  energetic 
arousal, athletes on low competition levels displayed decreased mental well-being when using either application 
longer. High-performance athlete’s app usage and mental health generally showed positive relationships. Only 
intraindividual  TikTok  usage  was  related  negatively  to  recovery  in  high-performance  athletes,  although  this 
relationship was weaker than in those competing on a low level.

As digital media are ubiquitous in young athletes’ lives it is essential to understand their relationship with 
mental  well-being  to  improve  recovery  management  and  mental  health.  The  current  findings  offer  valuable 
insights in implying that differential approaches to interventions may be necessary depending on competition 
level. For example, group interventions for high-performance athletes may need to focus more on digital media’s 
impacts on recovery management than on mood, while in athletes on a low performance level both aspects need 
to be centered. When aiming to avoid negative aspects of smartphone usage on recovery, special attention should 
be given to the usage of TikTok. However, it should be considered that the generalizability of these results may 
be limited by the relatively small sample size, as well as the influence of potential moderators, such as gender or 
sport. Consequently, mechanisms of the relationship between media usage and mental well-being on both high 
and low competition levels need to be continued in future studies to identify high-risk patterns not only on a 
group, but also on an individual level.
