Abstract

Background—Complex, disease-specific factors help to determine post-traumatic quality of life, 
but current practice utilizes outcome measures generated from the general population. Trauma 
survivorship has grown rapidly while defining the factors that influence post-traumatic quality of 
life has lagged. This study sought to develop a valid and reliable trauma-specific quality of life 
measure to help guide future post-traumatic research and clinical care.

Methods—Qualitative data were collected from adult trauma patients and their caregivers (Phase 
1). Subsequent analysis of these data resulted in the development of a 59-item quality of life (QoL) 
questionnaire. The 59-item trauma-specific QoL questionnaire (T-QoL) was then administered to 
adult trauma patients (n=394) and a factor analysis was conducted. The validity of the final TQoL 
measurement tool was assessed (n=111) using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form 
Health Survey version 2 and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (Phase 2).

Results—A 5-component structure using 43 items appeared to best represent the data. The 5 
components included: Emotional Well-Being, Functional Engagement, Recovery/Resilience, Peri-
Traumatic Experience, Physical Well-Being. Four of the five components were found to have 
strong Cronbach's alpha scores (>0.7), demonstrating consistent inter-item reliability. All 
subscales of the T-QoL correlated negatively with the PCL-C (p<.01), demonstrating that as the T-
QoL increases, the likelihood of PTSD decreases. The physical well-being subscale of the T-QoL 
correlated significantly with the SF-36v2 PCS as did the emotional well-being subscale with the 
SF-36v2 MCS (p<.05).

Conclusions—This study utilized the experiences of trauma victims and their informal 
caregivers to develop a five-component, 43-item questionnaire with domains that are unique to

Background

Advances in trauma-specific medical care, coupled with an expanding population, have 
culminated in a trauma survivorship whose needs and care-related issues are only beginning 
to be understood.1 From 2001 to 2010, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the 
total number of annual, nonfatal trauma injuries to have increased from 58.1 million to 63.9 
million.2 These injuries account for the loss of more disability-adjusted life years than any 
other disease, but many of the instruments and measurements used to assess outcome in this 
population are non-standardized or are adapted from other populations.3,4 Additionally, the 
acute cost associated with each patient, when medical care and work loss are considered, is 
around $66,150 or $406 billion annually.1,5 Thus, it is essential that a concerted effort be 
made to improve post-traumatic quality of life, thereby easing the current and future burden 
of the disease.

Previously, quality of care was predicated solely on the clearly defined and measurable 
outcome of mortality. However, as survivorship has increased, it has become apparent that 
the road to functional recovery is much more complex, requiring the comprehensive 
application of a bio-psychosocial view of care. Research, driven by such a view of care, has 
resulted in an increased appreciation for the necessity of multi-faceted quality of life (QoL) 
measurements.6-10 QoL can be measured using both generic and disease-specific 
instruments. Generic instruments allow measurement of population health and comparison 
across populations, while disease-specific instruments are more sensitive to change in an 
individual patient.

While specific QoL instruments exist for a wide range of diseases and populations, the 
development of a trauma-specific instrument is in its infancy. Historically, QoL within the 
trauma population has been predominately assessed using two generic measurements: The 
Quality of Well-Being Index (QWB) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form 
Health Survey (SF-36).11-14 While both generic instruments have provided valuable 
information about the QoL of trauma patients in general, they lack the specificity required to 
accurately predict QoL post-trauma in individual patients.

The importance and usefulness of a trauma-specific QoL measurement that attempts to 
accurately apply a bio-psychosocial view of patient care is being increasingly 
recognized.15-17 Using the psycho-social experience of traumatic patients and their 
caregivers as a foundation, the aims of this study were to develop and pilot a trauma specific 
QoL tool informed by trauma patients and their caregivers.18,19

Methods

Page 3

This study consisted of two phases. Initially, qualitative data were collected from adult 
trauma patients and their caregivers (Phase 1). Subsequent analysis of the data resulted in the 
development of a 59-item QoL questionnaire. In Phase 2, the 59-item trauma- QoL (T-QoL) 
questionnaire was then administered to adult trauma patients (n=394) and a factor analysis 
was conducted to reduce the number of items and to determine possible sub-factors of 
trauma QoL. The validity of the final QoL measurement tool was assessed in a subset of 
these patients (n=111) using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health 
Survey version 2 (SF-36-v2) and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C).

Recruitment of Focus Groups (Phase 1)

Focus groups were composed of a non-random, purposeful sample of adult trauma patients 
as well as their spouses, family members or others who served as informal caregivers. 
Trauma patients (n = 26) were recruited by phone within 12 months of blunt or penetrating 
injury, as identified by the trauma registry at a Level 1 Trauma Center. The informal 
caregivers (n = 11) of patients who sustained a blunt or penetrating injury within the 
preceding 12 months were also recruited. Excluded were individuals with head injury 
resulting in impaired communication, individuals under age 18, and incarcerated individuals. 
No patients or caregivers were excluded on the basis of gender, race, or ethnicity. 
Participants were asked to complete one focus group lasting no longer than 2 hours. All 
study activities were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the participating 
institution and written consent was obtained from all participants.

Qualitative Data Collection (Phase 1)

Over the course of six months, four patient focus groups and three caregiver focus groups 
were held. Each group met for one to two hours and consisted of no more than ten 
participants. Questionnaires were administered to gather basic information such as age, sex, 
ethnicity, type of trauma, time since injury, involvement in litigation, the life impact of the 
trauma experience, and the impact upon various areas of psycho-social importance. 
Interview questions were developed through a collaboration of healthcare providers and 
researchers with experience in caring for trauma patients and/or conducting focus group 
research. (The patient and caregiver participant questionnaires are available upon request.) 
Each focus group was audio recorded, allowing all comments to be collected without any 
initial analysis or grouping, and responses were generated in an open discussion format.

Data Analysis (Phase 1)

Data analysis began with written transcription of the audio recordings from each focus 
group. These qualitative data were then coded using a grounded theory approach. The 
patient and caregiver data were analyzed separately. Two members of the research team 
independently coded each patient transcript. The research team then convened to review 
each code and determine inter-coder agreement. Deliberation established a final code for 
each phrase or idea. Similarly, three members of the research team independently coded 
each caregiver transcript. Patient codes (n=752) and caregiver codes (n=145) were sufficient 
to achieve theoretical saturation in the respective data sets. Computer software was used to

model the data (NVivo; QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). Domains of importance 
were then identified from the codes, ensuring faithful data representation and accurate 
description of the areas under study.

Trauma Quality of Life (T-QoL) Instrument Construction (Phase 1)

The domains of importance derived from the patient focus group data resulted in a 59-item 
quality of life instrument. The pilot instrument was first distributed to a subset of trauma 
surgeons as well as trauma/critical care fellows, nurses and surgical residents for review and 
editing. The instrument was further edited and the language clarified to achieve a Flesch-
Kincaid grade 6.0 reading level.

Each item has response options presented as a Likert scale; scoring of the instrument allows 
for a single numerical measurement of quality of life, with a higher score indicating higher 
quality of life. Some item responses are qualified within a finite time frame; one week was 
used as the time frame of reference. This time frame was selected based on previous studies 
that have demonstrated recall ratings will be inflated relative to averaged momentary ratings, 
particularly over a longer time span, given the effects of recall bias.20,21 As such, a shorter 
time span (one week) was chosen as opposed to a longer time span (four weeks), to obtain 
the most accurate assessment.

Pilot of the 59-Item T- QoL Instrument (Phase 2)

Survivors of traumatic injury who were admitted to the trauma surgery service at a level 1 
trauma center were recruited to participate in phase 2 of the study. Potential participants 
were identified through the trauma registry three months (± 2 weeks) following injury and 
contacted via phone. 394 participants agreed to an assessment over the phone that included a 
questionnaire to collect basic demographic information (Table I) as well as the 59-item 
Trauma Quality of Life instrument. In order to conduct a validity assessment, the final 111 
of these participants were also asked to complete the SF-36v2, a well validated and 
standardized measure of general QoL and the PCL-C. The PCL-C was specifically chosen 
due to its reliability, internal consistency and validity which allow for accurate assessment of 
post-traumatic stress disorder. It was felt that any trauma-specific quality of life 
measurement tool should be able to quantify post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity 
accurately. The 111 subjects used to conduct the validity assessment were drawn 
consecutively from the 394 subjects and were similar demographically, ensuring minimal 
variability (Table I).

Data Analysis (Phase 2)

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify underlying structures within the 
59-item T-QoL measure. It was found that close to 60% of the cohort was unemployed at the 
time of injury and thus six items pertaining to employment were discarded. The retained 53-
items were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) which identified the final 5-
component, 43-item T-QoL measure. The T-QoL measure was then correlated with the 
SF-36v2 and the PCL-C to assess its validity, as non-disease specific QoL is significantly 
correlated with posttraumatic stress disorder following traumatic injury.

Results

Trauma Quality of Life Instrument Construction (Phase 1)

Page 5

Trauma Patient and Caregiver Focus Groups—Four trauma patient focus groups 
were held (n=26). Mean age was 51.3 ± 13.4 years, 73% of the patients were male; 62% 
Caucasian, 31% African American and 7% were of other races. Mechanism of injury was 
motor vehicle or motorcycle crash (27%), fall (27%), assault (19%), gunshot or stab (15%) 
and other mechanisms (12%). Mean time since injury was 230 ± 142 days. Twelve percent 
of patients reported involvement in litigation associated with the injury.

Both patients and caretakers were asked to answer the question, “On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 
being the highest), how much did the trauma experience affect your life?” Patients reported a 
mean life impact score of 7.7 ± 2.8 and caregivers reported a mean life impact score of 8.1 
± 3.0.

The most frequently coded peri-trauma and inpatient variables were perception of injury 
severity (26.6%), perception of medical care (19.6%), causal attribution (12.4%), loss of 
consciousness (11.7%), pain medication (6.5%), and physical impairment (5.8%). The most 
frequently coded post-trauma codes were impact on activities of daily living (8.5%), impact 
on relationships (6.5%), reliance on others (5.7%), post-injury outlook (5.3%), perception of 
physical recovery (5.0%), pain severity (4.7%), emotional impact on others (3.9%), faith/
belief system (3.9%), impact on leisure activities (3.4%), and scars (3.4%).

Pilot of the Trauma Quality of Life Instrument (Phase 2)

Factor Structure of the T-QoL—Three hundred ninety-four participants were included 
in the initial exploratory factor analysis. 60% of the sample was not working prior to the 
trauma and therefore six T-QoL items related to employment (i.e., I have lost my job since 
my injury) were excluded from analyses. Thus, fifty-three items were included in the 
analysis and were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA) using SPSS Version 19. 
The dataset was suitable for factor analysis: inspection of the correlation matrix revealed a 
number of correlations greater than 0.3, the KMO value was 0.91, exceeding the 
recommended value of 0.6 and Bartlett's test of Sphericity was significant (p < .001), 
supporting the factorability of the correlation matrix.

PCA revealed 13 components with eigenvalues greater than 1, explaining a total of 64.0% of 
the variance. Inspection of the scree plot suggested a clear break after the first component, 
but a more subtle break after the third and fourth component. The results of Parallel Analysis 
showed eigenvalues of five components exceeded the criterion value (1.79) for a randomly 
generated data matrix of the same size (53 variables × 394 respondents). Therefore, the PCA 
was re-run with an oblique (direct oblim) rotation forcing a three, four, and five factor 
solution separately. Inspection of the pattern matrices of the three solutions revealed that the 
five factor solution appeared to best represent the data in a parsimonious way. The four 
factor solution had one factor with less than three items and the three factor solution had a 
number of items with strong cross-loadings. Thus, the final five components identified were 
as follows: Emotional Well-Being (16 items), Functional Engagement (8 items), Recovery/
Resilience (6 items), Peri-Traumatic Experience (5 items), Physical Well-Being (8 items).

The five-component solution explained a total of 44.8% of the variance, with Emotional 
Well-Being contributing 26.3% of the variance, Functional Engagement contributing 6.1%, 
Recovery/Resilience contributing 4.8%, Peri-Traumatic Experience contributing 4.2%, and 
Physical Well-Being contributing 3.5%. The rotated five factor solution revealed that all five 
components had a number of strong loadings and most variables loaded substantially on 
only one component. Review of item communalities (values regarding how much of the 
variance an item contributes to a component) suggested that nine items had weak 
contributions to their respective components, and one item did not load on any of the five 
components, resulting in 43 retained items for the T-QoL.

Four of the five components were found to have strong Cronbach's alpha scores (>0.7) 
which demonstrated consistent inter-item reliability. However, the peri-traumatic experience 
component had a poor Cronbach's alpha (0.25) which points to a varied, poor inter-item 
reliability (Table II).

Validity of the Trauma Quality of Life (T-QoL) instrument was assessed using the PTSD 
Checklist – Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Version 2 
(SF-36v2). All subscales of the T-QoL correlated negatively with the PCL-C (p<.01), 
demonstrating that as the T-QoL increases, the likelihood of PTSD (as measured by the 
PCL-C) decreases. The physical well-being subscale of the T-QoL correlated significantly 
with the SF-36v2 PCS score while the emotional well-being subscale correlated significantly 
with the SF-36v2 MCS (p<.05), adding further support to its validity (Table III).

Discussion

Advances in medical care have greatly extended the lives of patients in all areas of medicine. 
These patient populations emerge from disease with unique experiences and needs that 
affect their current and future quality of life. An accurate and specific measurement of 
quality of life is needed to increase the sensitivity in which clinical care can be applied and 
studied. This study utilized the experiences of trauma victims and their informal caregivers 
to inform the creation of a trauma-specific quality of life measurement tool. The five-
domain, 43-item questionnaire resulted in domains that are unique to trauma populations: 
emotional well-being, functional engagement, recovery/resilience, peri-traumatic experience 
and physical well-being.

We found that a 5-domain structure explained the highest percent of variance and was the 
best fitting model for trauma QoL. Each of these domains are highly relevant to the trauma 
population. Prior studies have verified that post-traumatic symptoms are associated with 
lower outcome scoring in almost all of the domains identified, particularly functional 
outcomes.22 Pain (a significant component of the physical well-being domain) is also 
strongly associated with reduced functioning across both physical and psychosocial 
domains.23 Finally, a recent study by Lefering et al. found similar quality of life domains of 
importance: physical, psycho-social and functional capacity.24 Concurrent research 
identifying similar domains lends further credence to the T-QoL's 5-domain structure. This 
may provide clinicians with the opportunity to use an instrument that's more sensitive to 
change in individual trauma patients.

Validity of the Trauma Quality of Life (T-QoL) instrument was assessed using the PTSD 
Checklist – Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Version 2 
(SF-36v2). Both of these instruments were chosen due to their prevalent use and repetitive 
validation. When compared to the PCL-C, four out of the five components (except physical 
well-being) demonstrated consistent, statistically significant negative correlations. Thus, as 
the T-QoL score rises, the risk of PTSD as measured by the PCL-C decreases. Similarly, 
Kiely et al. found that PTSD was correlated with lower MCS scores in the SF-36v2. 25 This 
correlation further demonstrates concurrent validity between our T-QoL measure and 
existing post-trauma outcome measures as compared to the SF-36v2. This gives us 
confidence that the T-QoL not only captures existing factors that affect post-trauma quality 
of life but extends into areas important to survivors and their families that have been 
previously unexplored.

The physical engagement score from the T-QoL correlated significantly and positively with 
the physical component score (PCS) from the SF-36v2 suggesting construct validity with a 
similar measure. Weak positive correlations were also seen between the PCS and the 
physical well-being as well as recovery/resilience domains of the T-QoL but these were not 
statistically significant. Conceptually, these correlations may represent a similar thread of 
“functionality” but the T-QoL items also tie in an emotional and social dynamic that may not 
be present in the SF-36v2. As a result, the two instruments may be measuring a similar 
construct from two different clinical lenses. The T-QoL emotional well-being correlated 
positively (p=0.05) with the MCS of the SF-36v2, again demonstrating the construct validity 
of the T-QoL. The remaining four components showed weak, positive correlations that were 
statistically insignificant.

One limitation of this study is the researcher bias introduced when using coded qualitative 
data. Researcher interpretation and biases were minimized as multiple researchers coded the 
qualitative data individually to establish true inter-coder agreement. Furthermore, this type 
of study design allowed patients and their caregivers to guide and dictate areas of 
importance, ridding the measurement of preformed expectations and biases of the 
investigators. A second limitation is that the data was derived from a single level 1 trauma 
center. However, analyses of the patient and caregiver populations during phase 1 and 2 of 
the study demonstrated demographics similar to many typical trauma populations. Finally, 
one of the five retained components showed statistically weak correlations compared to the 
other four. The peri-traumatic experience domain resulted in a low Cronbach's alpha score. 
When viewed individually, the five items in this domain seem to logically affect post-trauma 
quality of life but their overall thematic grouping is difficult to define and is not statistically 
well-supported. While we elected to keep this domain in the measure, future research needs 
to establish the performance of this domain to inform its retention or deletion.

This is the first step towards defining an accurate and valid measurement of post-trauma 
quality of life. Continued research is needed to help tease out strengths and weaknesses that 
can improve the measurements sensitivity and usefulness to both clinicians and researchers. 
A broad, multi-center national study will help to alleviate these concerns and establish the 
43-item T-QoL as a measure that can guide and improve both future research and clinical 
care.
