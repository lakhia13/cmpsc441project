Abstract: Initiating and maintaining behavior change is key to the prevention and treatment of most preventable chronic
medical and psychiatric illnesses. The cultivation of mindfulness, involving acceptance and nonjudgment of present-mo-
ment experience, often results in transformative health behavior change. Neural systems involved in motivation and learn-
ing have an important role to play. A theoretical model of mindfulness that integrates these mechanisms with the cognitive,
emotional, and self-related processes commonly described, while applying an integrated model to health behavior change,
is needed. This integrative review (1) defines mindfulness and describes the mindfulness-based intervention movement,
(2) synthesizes the neuroscience of mindfulness and integrates motivation and learning mechanisms within a mindful
self-regulation model for understanding the complex effects of mindfulness on behavior change, and (3) synthesizes cur-
rent clinical research evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions targeting health behaviors relevant to psy-
chiatric care. The review provides insight into the limitations of current research and proposes potential mechanisms to
be tested in future research and targeted in clinical practice to enhance the impact of mindfulness on behavior change.

nonadherence to medical regimens account for a substantial
proportion of global disease morbidity and mortality, and
for 40%–50% of the risk for early death in the United
States.2–6 All-cause mortality is inversely associated with healthy
lifestyle behaviors, and changes in unhealthy behaviors can
lead to improved physical and mental health outcomes.7 De-
spite widespread awareness, it remains exceptionally difficult
to initiate and maintain health behavior change.2

Health behavior theories are used to understand and predict
health behaviors,8–16 and several behavior-change interventions
have become popular.17,18 A growing body of evidence suggests
that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective in re-
ducing harmful health behaviors,19 catalyzing chronic disease
self-management and health behavior change,20 and improving
physical and mental health outcomes.21–23 This article provides
a narrative review with three main aims: (1) to define mindfulness
and describe the evolving context and content for the MBI
movement, (2) to describe an updated “mindful self-regulation”
model that integrates motivation and learning mechanisms
essential for behavior change and is grounded in emerging
neuroscientific evidence, and (3) to synthesize current clinical re-
search on MBIs targeting health behaviors relevant to psychiatry.

MINDFULNESS AND MBIs
Mindfulness is commonly defined as the awareness that arises
when paying attention to the present moment nonjudgmen-
tally.24 In 1881, the English scholar Rhys Davids translated
the word mindfulness from the Pali word sati found in Buddhist
texts, which meant “memory, recollection, calling-to-mind,
being-aware-of, certain specified facts”25 but which has also
been described as “lucid awareness”26 or “bare attention.”27

The terms mindfulness and meditation are increasingly con-
flated. General integrative practices (e.g., visualization, yoga)
are often described as “mindfulness” in public discourse, di-
luting the word’s meaning. Importantly, not all meditation
is mindfulness and not all mindfulness is meditation. Medita-
tion is a practice that self-regulates the body and mind by en-
gaging a specific attentional set.28 In mindfulness meditation
(MM), the practice is to pay attention to present-moment ex-
perience with an orientation of curiosity, openness, accep-
tance, nonreactivity, and nonjudgment.29,30

Several core types of MM are taught in MBIs, along an
attentional continuum that ranges from focused attention,
which involves directing and sustaining attention on an ob-
ject, disengaging from distractors (e.g., mind wandering), and
returning attention to the object, to open monitoring, which
has no explicit focus but cultivates metacognitive monitoring
with a nonreactive awareness of the flow of cognition, emotions,
and sensations.31 MBIs also use other evocative meditations to
cultivate specific emotions (e.g., compassion, loving-kindness)
that support MM practice.32,33 MM may produce relaxation
in the body (i.e., the relaxation response, a voluntary, wakeful,
hypometabolic state of parasympathetic dominance),34 but
relaxation is not necessarily the objective. Rather, MM is an
active and intentional practice of cultivating awareness of
present-moment experience that may include strong emo-
tions, difficult thoughts, or unpleasant sensations.35 MM cul-
tivates both awareness and equanimity, an even-minded mental
state or dispositional tendency toward all experiences/objects,
regardless of their affective valence (pleasant/unpleasant/
neutral).33 Several valuable models describe potential psycho-
logical and neurobiological mechanisms through which MM
could exert its salutary effects.30,36–45

Persistent tensions have emerged throughout the MBI move-
ment between (1) adaptation/openness to change versus fidelity/
quality/safety, (2) drives for innovation/novelty versus ownership/
tradition, and (3) non-attachment to labels versus valuing lineage
with respect for teachers. To avoid confusion and to remain
inclusive and neutral to these natural tensions, we describe a
brief history of the movement—providing context for, and
meaning to, various definitions.

Jon Kabat-Zinn began developing the first MBI, mindfulness-
based stress reduction (MBSR), in 1977, integrating Buddhist
insight (Pali: Vipassana) meditation,46,47 other contemplative
practices (e.g., Zen, yoga),47,48 and modern psychological the-
ories about stress and stress coping for application in health
care.49–52 This work spawned a new secular, mainstream
pedagogy for MM training, with a package of practices
(i.e., body scan, mindful breathing, sitting meditation, infor-
mal mindfulness) bundled in an eight-week program that
was designed to cultivate mindful attention in daily life, thereby
helping patients to cope with stress, pain, and other chronic con-
ditions. The first adaptation of MBSR, mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy for depression,53–56 constituted, along with
MBSR, the first generation of MBIs.57 More than a decade
later, these approaches would come to be called mindfulness-

based programs (MBPs), which have in common the “system-
atic and sustained training in formal and informal MM prac-
tices (for both teacher and participants).”57,58 Crane and
colleagues57 distinguish MBPs from general MBIs, which were
adapted from MBSR and mindfulness-based cognitive ther-
apy; although these approaches also focus on cultivating MM
practice, they have not always followed the same teacher-
training process or other MBP standards. Together MBIs and
MBPs focus on MM practice and differ from mindfulness-
informed interventions,59 or “third-wave” interventions60
(e.g., dialectical behavior therapy [DBT], acceptance and
commitment therapy [ACT]),61,62 which feature mindfulness as
a component within a larger suite of techniques and mechanisms
of change without an explicit focus on MM practice.57,59 Re-
search publications on MBIs began increasing exponentially in
the 2000s, in parallel with the proliferation of MBIs for specific
conditions, and by 2020, MBIs have emerged for many chronic
mental and physical illnesses.21,63,64 Academic mindfulness
centers also emerged as dissemination nodes for MBPs,65 en-
couraging standards for formal teacher training and teacher
competency assessments to ensure program integrity.66

This review will focus primarily on the areas with the
strongest evidence relating to mindfulness and behavior
change. We will describe and expand existing models of
mindful self-regulation based on neurobiological mechanisms
of mindfulness, motivation, and learning.38,67,68 Then we will
review data from meta-analyses and well-designed random-
ized, controlled trials (RCTs) of MBPs affecting health behav-
iors. Given the more heterogeneous nature of related
interventions (e.g., MBIs, DBT, ACT, mindful self-compassion,
integrative mind-body therapy),61–63,69,70 we will limit refer-
ences to these interventions except when MBP research is
scarce. It should be noted, however, that DBT and ACT have
made a substantial contribution to the understanding of behavior
change, with strong meta-analytic evidence for a range of psychi-
atric disorders—which has contributed to a broader reconceptu-
alization of the mechanisms of behavior change brought about
by third-wave cognitive and behavioral therapies.60,71

MINDFUL SELF-REGULATION
Self-regulation is the ability to adaptively regulate one’s atten-
tion, emotions, cognition, and behavior to respond effectively
to internal as well as environmental demands.72–74 Self-regulation
impairment is linked to poorer outcomes in school/academics75,76
and also to poorer physical77,78 and mental health.79–84
Self-regulation theory proposes several critical processes for
people to initiate and maintain behavior change and to prevent
self-regulatory failure,73 including the capacity for standard
setting, motivation to meet standards, self-monitoring, and
willpower,73,74,85,86 We will build on the seminal neuroscience-
based frameworks proposed by Hölzel and colleagues38 and
Vago and colleagues,40 which outlined several relevant synergistic
neurocognitive systems that underlie the effects of mindfulness on
self-regulation, including attentional control, cognitive control,
emotion regulation, and self-related processes. Importantly, we

will describe how these self-regulation mechanisms interact with
basic neural mechanisms for motivation and learning, which
are well studied in the addiction and behavioral medicine litera-
ture. We will describe how each of these systems may play a role
in facilitating the way that MM affects a person’s capacity for be-
havior change (Figure 1). The reviews aim to fill the gap in previ-
ous models of mindfulness and self-regulation by describing how,
as MM practice develops, it may begin to enhance motivation for
change by affecting processes of reward, associative and extinc-
tion learning, and habit formation, thereby shifting the balance
from unhealthy to healthier behavioral repertoires.

Attention and Cognitive Control
Cognitive control is a fundamental capacity of human cogni-
tion that regulates access to specific goal-relevant information
to facilitate the performance of specific behaviors.87–91 Exec-
utive functions are cognitive processes necessary for initiating
and maintaining behavior change, and also for selecting and
monitoring behavior toward attainment of goals; mental set
shifting, information updating and monitoring, and inhibi-
tion are of particular importance.92 The subcomponents of
cognitive control and executive function include attentional
control/regulation,93,94 cognitive inhibition, inhibitory con-
trol, working memory, decision making, and cognitive flexi-
bility.95 Attentional control can be further subdivided into
(1) volitional orienting of attention to task-relevant information
(e.g., breath, body sensations), (2) alerting to and successfully
sustaining attention and vigilance for unexpected stimuli, and
(3) conflict monitoring among task-relevant internal thoughts,
feelings, and responses.96 These attentional processes contribute
to recognizing both the consequences of ongoing unhealthy
behavior and the affective precursors to avoidance or appeti-
tive behaviors, contributing to adaptive behavior change.

MM may contribute to self-management of clinical symp-
toms, which are affected by unhealthy behaviors or maladap-
tive cognitive coping strategies, through explicit cognitive
control processes. Two highly cited models38,40 suggest that
mindfulness involves attention regulation (improvement
in orienting, alerting/stability, bias, meta-awareness/
monitoring)97–99 and inhibition/switching (decentering, in-
hibitory control, flexible engagement/disengagement).100,101
While individual studies support these models,102 meta-analyses
of the effects of mindfulness on behavioral-cognitive assays dem-
onstrate substantial heterogeneity,103,104 possibly related to diver-
sity in mindfulness techniques, small sample sizes, nonspecific
effects of common factors (e.g., group effects, empathic ther-
apists), and multiple strategies for performing behavioral
tasks. Moreover, populations with unique cognitive-dysfunction
profiles (e.g., substance use, bipolar disorder, depression,
age-related cognitive decline, or mild cognitive impairment)105–110
may experience improvement of disorder-specific dysfunc-
tion, whereas healthy participants may be sensitive to ceiling
effects. In addition, the mindfulness effect may simply be making
the brain more efficient, requiring less effort for a similar result.106
Functional neuroimaging research demonstrates that these
interrelated cognitive control processes generally engage
overlapping higher-order brain networks, including a central
executive network, salience network, dorsal and ventral at-
tention networks, and default mode network (DMN).111
These networks are anchored through a frontoparietal net-
work that acts as a flexible hub interconnecting these net-
works, depending on the contextual and functional demands
of cognition.112–116 This superordinate frontoparietal net-
work, also referred to as the cognitive control network, in-
cludes the dorsolateral (dl) prefrontal cortex (PFC), posterior
parietal cortex, anterior insula cortex, anterior cingulate cortex

(ACC), and medial PFC.89–91,113,114 In the context of this
flexible-hub framework, growing mechanistic evidence
suggests that different types of MM engage associated
frontoparietal network brain areas both structurally and
functionally, differentially influencing psychological and cog-
nitive outcomes.117,118 For example, studies show differences
in brain activation and connectivity during focused-attention
versus open-monitoring meditation,119 with focused atten-
tion engaging attentional control, whereas open-monitoring
training engages labeling and emotional nonreactivity.120 A
key aspect of cognitive control is the capacity to monitor for
conflicts in information processing and to transmit these sig-
nals to other executive functions.87 This conflict-monitoring
capacity has been associated with the ACC and seems to be
enhanced with alterations in the ACC in the first few weeks
of MM.121–123 Multiple fMRI studies suggest functional al-
terations between the ACC and insula in the context of mon-
itoring for aversive stimuli during MM.123–126 Executive
function is negatively affected by hippocampal dysfunc-
tion,127 whereas MBSR has been associated with increases
in hippocampal volume,128 which can affect working mem-
ory performance.129 Inhibitory control is commonly associ-
ated with the dorsal ACC (dACC) or inferior frontal gyrus,
which may be affected by culture or by developing mental
habits of behavioral consistency.130 In meta-analyses, the
dACC is often activated in studies of both focused-attention
and open-monitoring meditation.117

Given that executive functions are critical for initiating
and maintaining health behaviors, MBPs that enhance these
processes may affect behavior-change capacity. By enhancing
working memory and expanding attentional resources,131
MM may increase conscious awareness of behaviorally rele-
vant external or internal stimuli (e.g., appetitive cues, stress-
or craving-related body sensations), providing more time
for higher-order cognitive functions, such as inhibitory con-
trol and other executive functions. These changes may help
overcome prepotent motor responses, reduce the cognitive ef-
fort required for decision making about appetitive health be-
haviors, and diminish susceptibility to automatic behaviors in
response to negative affect.106,132

Emotion Regulation
Emotions influence our perception, thinking, and behavior,
and are made up of subjective, physiological, and behavioral
components.133 Emotion regulation is the ability to modulate
emotional experiences, enabling adaptive engagement with
internal and external experience, which is essential for
well-being and social adaptation.134,135 A variety of emotion-
regulation strategies have been identified, including modifying
the situation, altering attention toward it, modifying thoughts
about it, and modulating the response to emotional experi-
ences.136 Effective strategies decrease the subjective experience
of negative emotion and its physiological correlates, and are as-
sociated with long-term efficacy in daily life.137 The best-studied
strategy is cognitive reappraisal, the conscious reinterpretation

of a situation in a way that alters its meaning and lessens the
emotional impact. Reappraisal may be one of the mecha-
nisms through which MM improves emotion regulation and
ameliorates anxiety and depression.138,139 According to one
model with empirical support, mindfulness facilitates reap-
praisal by interrupting automatic reactions, allowing for con-
scious reflection.38,140 With ongoing practice, some theorize
that MM practitioners transition from using reappraisal strat-
egies to cultivating states of nonappraisal and equanimity,
though longitudinal research is needed.33,38,141 The available
evidence also provides some support for exposure and extinc-
tion as key mechanisms for mindfulness-related emotion reg-
ulation. Rather than engaging in experiential avoidance142–144
or thought suppression,145 MBPs promote the ability to focus
awareness on a difficult experience when it arises, creating a
condition of exposure to negative emotional reactions.38,146
This change in focus is often aided by the capacity to shift ex-
periential perspective— to step outside one’s immediate subjec-
tive experience to a more objective, non-identified awareness
of one’s experience, which is called decentering,100 metacognitive
monitoring, or meta-awareness.147,148 With practice, repeated
acceptance and awareness of emotional and physiological re-
sponses lead to reduction and even extinction of emotional
reactivity.149–151 Therefore, whereas meditation often causes
state changes with enhanced autonomic parasympathetic activ-
ity, exposure through MM practice may create greater trait im-
plicit control over parasympathetic tone, possibly initially
through ACC control,152 and then possibly, with ongoing prac-
tice, through ventromedial (vm) PFC modulation of the amyg-
dala.148,153 Finally, as people learn to be mindful of emotions,
the capacity for emotion differentiation may be enhanced, which
is associated with an enhanced ability for emotion regulation.154
Functional neuroimaging research implicates both distinct
and overlapping networks involved in different emotion-
regulation strategies. Explicit cognitive strategies like reap-
praisal are associated with activation of the frontoparietal
executive network involved in selective attention, working
memory, and response inhibition, and with deactivation of
the amygdala.155 Neural mechanisms of mindfulness-based
emotion regulation appear to differ, depending on the sub-
jects’ experience level. Naive subjects given brief training in
mindfulness induction for a laboratory study appear to em-
ploy top-down control by PFC regions in fashion similar to
that of subjects instructed to use cognitive reappraisal.156 By
contrast, for experienced meditators, downregulation of
emotional reactivity when in a mindful state appears to in-
volve deactivation of the DMN without deactivation of the
amygdala.157 MBSR completers show decreased amygdala
reactivity accompanied by increased amygdala–vmPFC func-
tional coupling, consistent with the finding that symptom
improvement in anxiety patients correlates with increased
amygdala–vmPFC coupling after MBSR.153,158 Long-term
meditators, in contrast to eight-week MBSR completers,
employ implicit emotion-regulation systems involving the insula
and vmPFC to modulate emotional reactivity.153 These findings

374

Volume 28 (cid:129) Number 6 (cid:129) November/December 2020

suggest that, over time, long-term mindfulness practice pro-
motes greater awareness and acceptance of emotional experi-
ence rather than the suppression of emotions by top-down
inhibitory control.148,153,156,157

Healthy emotion regulation is important for behavior change
to modulate emotions in alignment with one’s goals.159,160
Without it, feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression may
thwart one’s intention to engage in health behaviors related,
for example, to diet, exercise, or smoking—which promote
positive health outcomes.161–164 Similarly, for patients with
chronic illnesses facing a variety of physical and psychological
challenges, emotion regulation is critical for maintaining opti-
mal cognitive functioning and emotional balance.165 Mindful-
ness may also improve the chances of successful behavior
change by increasing awareness of how emotions influence
decisions and behaviors.137 A recent study of primary care
patients with chronic illness reported that an eight-week
MBI facilitated emotion regulation and catalyzed health be-
havior change.20 Our recent meta-analysis found that sub-
jects receiving MBPs, compared to controls, significantly
improved on emotion-regulation measures,166 suggesting
that mindfulness may engage emotion-regulation processes
that can improve behavioral outcomes.67,137,167,168

Self-Related Processes
Cognitive science describes a continuum of self-related pro-
cesses that aligns closely with large-scale neural networks dis-
covered through functional connectivity studies—networks
that are affected by MM.

At one end of the self-related process continuum, the expe-
riential self is the self-as-subject, the embodied self that is sup-
ported by phenomenological body awareness unextended in
time—that is, the sense of “I am in this moment.”169–171
Interoception is the sensory experience of homeostatic affer-
ents related to the body’s physiologic state, producing the
feeling of present-moment self in the body.172 Broader defini-
tions of interoceptive awareness include the tendency to listen
to and trust body sensations as occurring within a dynamic
relationship with appraisal and interoceptive regulation pro-
cesses.173,174 Mindfulness training enhances interoceptive
awareness and function.20 Most MM starts with the body
and seems to develop greater interoceptive accuracy.175,176
Interoceptive dysfunction may lead to difficulties predicting
body states and to allostatic dyscontrol.177 Interoceptive reg-
ulation may be enhanced through MM by increasing the ca-
pacity for perceptual-inference strategies (i.e., bringing the
desired interoceptive state to what is sensed) instead of focus-
ing only on active-inference strategies (i.e., trying to change
the experience to the desired state).178 Numerous recent stud-
ies suggest an impact of MM on improving interoceptive
measures.20,179 Meta-analysis and mediation studies are
needed to examine the full impact of mindfulness on intero-
ceptive awareness and its effect on behavior change.

Mindfulness neuroscience describes a phenomenological
experiential-self network,171 involving activation of the anterior

insula,40 which is altered after MM training.180 The insula
provides an efficient means for processing large-scale intero-
ceptive information in real time.181 Interoceptive activity and
functional connectivity in the insula is disrupted in depres-
sion,182 which may be associated with a lack of emotional feel-
ing in the body183 and may be associated with alexithymia.184,185
Functional connectivity studies of large-scale networks pro-
pose a key role of the insula in a salience network, which is
posited to shift attention between internal (e.g., internal body
sensations) and external stimuli (e.g., external perception)
with dorsal attentional and ventral emotional components.111
Among MM practitioners, the experiential-self network may
use moment-to-moment bodily experience in context to estab-
lish saliency for attention and regulation of cognitive resources.
At the other end of the self-related process continuum, a
narrative self 170 emerges during development, starting in late
latency,186 then consolidating during adolescence187 and
emerging adulthood,188 represented by autobiographical self-
monitoring and social-cognitive and evaluative functions—in
short, the self-as-object, “story of me as a person,” temporally
extended into the past or future.170 These cognitive science
concepts align with cognitive clinical models of self-related
processes, which have an emphasis on self-discrepancy189
between the actual and idealized narrative self through
positive (self-esteem and self-worth190) and negative self-
evaluation191,192 (self-devaluation, self-criticism, and self-critical
rumination).74,193,194 Emerging therapeutic approaches also
include self-schema195–197 or multiple self-like parts198,199
to explain the clinical complexity of narrative self–related pro-
cesses. The narrative self overlaps with many functions of the
DMN, the most prominent large-scale brain network underly-
ing self-related processes.200 The DMN engages medial corti-
cal regions involved in self-monitoring, self-judgment,
self-referential mental activity, episodic-memory retrieval, au-
tobiographical memory, self-related social-cognitive processes,
and value-based decision making.201,202 The DMN connects
during adolescent identity formation,203 increasingly potenti-
ating self-criticism and negative self-evaluative rumination.
Among adults, high levels of DMN connectivity are associated
with depression.204 Importantly, DMN activity and connectiv-
ity are reduced among experienced mindfulness meditators.205
In a recent meta-analysis, the posterior cingulate cortex, which
is a core DMN node involved in self-related processing,206
is reliably deactivated during both focused-attention and
open-monitoring MM.118

Rumination is a response to distress that involves repetitively
and passively focusing on symptoms of distress and the possible
causes and consequences of these symptoms.207,208 Rumination
predicts depression,209 bulimia, substance use, self-injurious
behaviors, impaired problem solving,208 and aggressive be-
haviors.210 One meta-analysis demonstrated that reductions
in rumination partially mediated improved psychological
functioning.151 Another recent meta-analysis found MBPs re-
duced negative self-related rumination, with a strong effect
among six studies with inactive control groups, and potential

for benefit among two studies with active controls.166 A
meta-analysis of brain-imaging studies reports a strong asso-
ciation between DMN core regions, especially the dorsomedial
(dm) PFC, and rumination.211 Reducing negative self-related
rumination through MBPs may improve emotion regulation,
reducing depressive symptoms and self-criticism. In this way,
MM might prevent the detrimental repetition of negative
global self-attributions that come when a person has a brief slip
of unhealthy behavior after a period of sustained abstinence—
which often leads persons to dive into a full-blown relapse, a
process that Marlatt18 named the abstinence violation effect.
Other self-related processes on the continuum are the sense
of agency212 related to the experience of one’s actions and de-
cision making as an individual agentic self, and self-efficacy,
which is one’s belief in one’s ability to succeed in specific sit-
uations or accomplish a task.213 A frontoparietal cognitive
control network may provide flexible control in self-related
processing214—involving coupling between other frontal net-
works, depending on internally or externally directed task de-
mands.91,112,114,215 The overarching cognitive control network
is therefore recruited to support control of belief and goal-directed
strategies, flexibility creating a sense of self-agency that con-
tributes to resiliency.216,217 The dlPFC, which is a core node
of the central executive network, is often activated during
MM; MM enhances connectivity between the dlPFC and
other executive-function regions.218,219 As MM practice
continues over time, the central executive network and other
frontal networks may regulate the DMN in control of
cognition.220

Two small studies have demonstrated increases in task-specific
self-efficacy, though the increases were not statistically significant
compared with controls.221,222 An uncontrolled, prospective
cohort study reported increased chronic illness self-efficacy
after eight weeks of MBSR but less self-efficacy at one year.223
Two larger RCTs of an eight-week MBP with self-efficacy as a
secondary outcome reported within-group improvements in
self-efficacy (d = 0.3 – 0.43), though this result was not signif-
icantly different from a low-dose mindfulness comparator.20,224
The ability to practice mindfulness may lead to a greater sense of
one’s ability to make health behavior change; however, it is also
possible that initial difficulty attaining expected levels of mind-
fulness practice may cause an opposite, deleterious effect on
global self-efficacy and that the feedback from this failure may
affect the capacity to succeed in self-regulation itself.225,226
Closer analysis of self-efficacy and self-agentic beliefs are needed
to understand their role in mindful self-regulation models.

Finally, the warmth with which one relates to one’s self is a
self-related process that affects self-regulation and behavior.
Self-compassion involves responding with a warm, kind,
and understanding orientation toward oneself, as one would
to a close friend, when we suffer, fail, or feel inadequate.227
Self-compassion may be a mechanism through which MM
supports behavior change228,229 and engagement in health-
promoting behaviors230,231 in the context of diabetes,232 dis-
ordered eating,233 exercise-related goals in the face of

setbacks,234 and sexual HIV risk behaviors.235 Self-compassion
has been proposed to have a direct effect on self-regulation236
in part by neurobiologically mimicking a supportive compas-
sionate other, activating the soothing-affiliation system.237 A
meta-analysis demonstrated a strong effect of MBPs for in-
creasing self-compassion in four studies with inactive controls
(d = 0.73), though the result was insignificant versus active
comparators.166 A rigorous RCT comparing an eight-week
MBP versus a 60-minute mindfulness comparator reported sig-
nificant effects of mindfulness dose on self-compassion (d =
0.41).20 MM lowered levels of self-criticism, which was associ-
ated with reduced activation in dmPFC nodes of the DMN,238
initially through dlPFC-mediated self-compassionate reap-
praisal strategies.239 Kindness toward self may clarify that
one is worthy of being cared about, thereby enhancing motiva-
tion for self-care. MBPs focused primarily on attentional aspects
of mindfulness in initial manuals/manuscripts, but a beneficial
implicit “hidden curriculum” emerged for cultivating warmth
and self-kindness.240 More recently, Kabat-Zinn241 clarified
that “mindfulness” is the same as “heartfulness,” acknowledg-
ing the importance of love, kindness, and compassion. In this
way, mindfulness practice may be described as “warmly being
with present moment experience.” “Warm” mindfulness in-
fused with self-compassion may be a more effective rapid
emotion-regulation strategy than a response of “cool” mind-
ful acceptance alone.242 Interventions and programs that fo-
cus explicitly on cultivating inner compassion, which includes
and extends beyond self-kindness, may help facilitate behav-
ior change, particularly for individuals who are prone to
excess self-criticism, shame, or unworthiness.243

Motivation and Learning
In self-regulation theories, motivation relies on an anticipa-
tory proactive system (i.e., setting standards) and a reactive
negative feedback system (i.e., evaluative judgment) for re-
ducing the discrepancy between goals/standards and
behavior.72–74 Early self-regulation theories, based on control
theory72 or homeostasis (feedback error correction),244 em-
phasize the role of evaluative judgment to generate motiva-
tion for change. Importantly, control of motivation can be
stimulus driven in response to an external stimulus or control
driven, which is motivated by, and directed toward, a specific
outcome (e.g., intentions, goal setting).245 The motivation for
unhealthy behavior is often driven by external and interocep-
tive stimuli246 through associative learning—for example,
operant conditioning with positive or negative reinforcement.
While MBPs may initially engage negative feedback systems
utilizing discrepancy through evaluative judgment or predic-
tive error to generate motivation for practice (e.g., “I hate be-
ing depressed, so I am motivated to practice mindfulness”),
evaluative judgment is deemphasized during MBPs in favor
of developing a focus on acceptance, intention setting, and at-
tention toward experiential monitoring rather than self-
evaluation.247–249

Evaluative judgment and feedback occur at least partially
through the phasic activity of midbrain dopamine neurons
in the ventral tegmental area that encode a prediction error
used to guide associative learning throughout the frontal cor-
tex and the basal ganglia.250 Activity in ventral tegmental
area dopaminergic neurons that project to the nucleus accum-
bens (NAc) may signal that a person’s estimate of the value of
current and future events is in error, and also indicate the er-
ror magnitude.251 This dopaminergic signaling process for
reward-based learning begins with the acquisition of a reward
after a behavior and leads to operant conditioning (e.g., in-
centive to repeat a pleasant, rewarding state). This gives
way to wanting through incentive salience for cue-elicited be-
haviors,252 which causes automaticity and habit formation
with the behavior eventually becoming epigenetically encoded
in the dorsal striatum,253–255 making it harder to unlearn.256
Aversive learning happens through several mechanisms.
Avoidance action learning, also referred to as negative rein-
forcement (e.g., action to avoid an unpleasant negative affect
or aversive withdrawal state), depends on dopaminergic
signaling in the NAc, though possibly through a different
mechanism than approach learning.246,257 Pavlovian fear
conditioning258 is due to signaling in the basolateral amyg-
dala, which gets transmitted to the central amygdala, lead-
ing to the startle/freeze response to a stimulus.246,259–261 In
cases where successful avoidance action takes place, however,
a signal from the vmPFC blocks signal transmission to the
central amygdala; instead of freezing, there is a predictive er-
ror signal in the NAc.246 Therefore, with aversive experiential
learning, the freeze response and fear memory get condi-
tioned first, but then successful avoidance action gets condi-
tioned through engagement from the NAc and vmPFC,
priming people to initiate avoidance action when a cue re-
lated to the previously aversive stimuli is experienced.246
Thus, the conditioned action urges that are at the heart of re-
ward and experiential avoidance seem to be encoded in the
prediction error in the NAc modulated by the vmPFC, which
is the cortical region involved in subjective self-related valua-
tion and self-regulatory goals.262–264

Fear memories either get continually reconsolidated after
cue exposure or move toward extinction if the feared condi-
tioned effects do not arise through a NMDA receptor–mediated
process in the basolateral amygdala.265,266 Extinction learning
is the process of inhibiting conditioned fear responses and de-
veloping new learning that competes with prior condition-
ing.266,267 It also involves prediction error–related vmPFC
activity,268 which may explain why approach and avoidance
conditioning often interact when trying to reverse condition-
ing.269,270 Therefore, both negative and positive reinforcement
approaches may rely on this dopaminergic error-prediction
system and modulation from the vmPFC self-related valuation
system, which together are likely candidates for the negative
feedback evaluative judgment system in self-regulation theory.
New theories based on recent neuroscientific develop-
ments also propose that prediction-error processes may be

Mindfulness and Behavior Change

widely distributed throughout the brain’s architecture (in-
cluding the insula) for interoceptive regulation and allostasis,
with a key role in emotion and behavioral regulation.271,272
These neural models of allostasis propose that efficient
self-regulation requires anticipating needs and preparing to
satisfy them before they arise through a process of predictive
error prevention.256

As described above, external rewards and punishments
can lead to associative learning through Pavlovian and oper-
ant conditioning, and lead to habits that persist with ongoing
positive and negative reinforcement. Exposure and associa-
tive learning can also be employed both for removing un-
healthy habitual behavior and for developing and reinforcing
healthy habitual behavior.41 Mindfulness practice, in particu-
lar, is itself a unique healthy behavior that may have the capac-
ity to accelerate the process of extinguishing and replacing
unhealthy behavioral repertoires.273,274 Traditionally, MM
has been effectively taught in retreat settings lacking most
behavior-activating cues,46 allowing interoceptive and cogni-
tive exposure with reduced risk for actual harmful behav-
iors.275 In community MBPs, however, participants live in
high-risk, cue-laden contexts,276 which can be more challeng-
ing. Despite this increased challenge, the social context of the
group helps people spend time away from unhealthy
behavior-activating cues and in a social environment that
values collective learning of mindfulness.277 As community
MBP practice continues, autonomic stability increases,152
allowing for a “window of tolerance,”278,279 within which
exposure, response prevention, reconsolidation, associative
learning, and extinction learning processes150,280 may begin
to unwind the habit learning273 and fear conditioning281 that
were maintaining unhealthy habits.

At around four weeks of practice, nonclinical MBI partic-
ipants generally begin to automatically pay attention to the
present moment.282 MM may be utilizing the same neural cir-
cuitry and associative-learning mechanisms to establish the
habit of mindfulness, which can lead to a process of therapeu-
tic staged neuroplasticity.283 Mindfulness practice associates
readily available cues (e.g., the breath, present-moment sensa-
tions in the body, the physical experience of stress) with the
internal mindful action of warmly being with present-moment
experience with constant, accepting awareness of the experi-
ence’s changing nature—a process traditionally called
Sampajanna in the Pali language, meaning “clear comprehen-
sion of impermanence.”26 This then sets in motion an auto-
matic, internal behavioral repertoire that uses exposure and
extinction processes to uproot deeply programmed, un-
healthy conditioned behavioral patterns, while developing in-
sight and ability to distinguish which behavioral patterns are
healthier and do no harm.197,274,284 By combining this mind-
ful acceptance with deepening interoceptive awareness, MM
then begins to sidestep standard interoceptive feedback pro-
cesses that drive automatic behaviors, thereby shifting intero-
ceptive regulation toward use of the perceptual-inference
instead of active-inference strategies. This change provides

an efficient pathway for discrepancy resolution that reduces
predictive errors and refines allostatic regulation.173,285 The
stimulus-driven approach to learning and motivation dissi-
pates as motivation for mindfulness becomes fully internal-
ized and intrinsic motivation for healthy behaviors awakens.
Self-determination theory suggests motivation is derived
from competence, relatedness, and autonomy.286 The motiva-
tion for initiating and maintaining behavior change exists on
a continuum from amotivation to extrinsic (external pres-
sure), introjected (internal pressure/guilt/shame), identified
(feels useful/important), internalized (aligns with deeply held
values), and most optimally intrinsic (interesting/enjoyable).
Initially, mindfulness and paying attention may come from
introjected or identified motivation (e.g., feeling I should
meditate or that meditation is important for me). As practice
continues and one witnesses the moment-to-moment conse-
quences of unhealthy behaviors and identifies what is deeply
valued, motivation for healthy behaviors become increasingly
internalized, and people become self-motivated.74 As behav-
ior aligns with internal standards, one develops more proac-
tive systems (e.g., intention setting), reducing the burden
from reliance on overreactive, judgment-driven negative feed-
back systems.287 Competence and autonomy are enhanced,
and intrinsic motivations for wellness are progressively un-
covered. Curiosity, which is a key aspect of the mindful
state,101 may also modulate midbrain dopaminergic sys-
tems.288,289 Mindfully taking interest in health behaviors
and its effects may generate greater levels of intrinsic motiva-
tion,287,290 enhancing overall motivational vigor and cogni-
tive control through tonic dopamine release from the ventral
tegmental area to the frontal central executive network
regions.291–293 As mindfulness practice proceeds, mindful sa-
voring of healthy, pleasant experiences may restructure re-
ward processes and dopaminergic tone to reinstate value to
natural rewards.294 Negative emotions have specific action
urges, while positive emotions tend to broaden and build a
person’s repertoire of thought-action patterns.295 Therefore,
emotions are often experienced as intrinsic motivation, and
emotion differentiation296 and reappraisal through mindful-
ness may help reduce emotionally driven unhealthy behaviors
and build internalized and intrinsic motivation for healthy be-
haviors. Finally, kindness and compassion increase related-
ness with others and potentially make people more sensitive
to affiliative motivational systems, through which oxytocin
may drive dopaminergic learning and reward in the ventral
tegmental area and NAc.297,298

Mindful Self-Regulation: Synergy and Integration
Mindful self-regulation integrates attentional/cognitive con-
trol, emotion regulation, and self-related processes in synergy
with mechanisms for motivation and learning as the practice
of MM deepens. Mindful self-regulation starts with atten-
tional control and curiosity about present-moment experi-
ence, leading to the development of interoceptive awareness
and alternatives to self-critical rumination. Reappraisal of

mental content, decentering, and acceptance downregulates
autonomic reactivity, allowing for exposure to aversive inter-
nal stimuli and ultimately developing equanimity. Yet, for
people with high levels of limbic dysregulation (e.g., unre-
solved trauma, marginalized or disempowered status) or
baseline attentional/cognitive impairments, this standard,
“cool” MM pathway offers some challenges. In this context,
a “warm” MM pathway that starts with establishing safety
through a “window of tolerance,” while cultivating self-
compassion and inner warmth, may be more effective.299 By
reducing self-criticism, autonomic reactivity, and internal con-
flict, the focus shifts from unhealthy patterns toward self-care.300
By slowly reducing the limbic load on cognitive control resources,
attentional training becomes more accessible and effective. The
most effective MM teachers often engage both pathways in tan-
dem, helping practitioners more quickly come into smooth regu-
lation and potentially reducing adverse experiences;301 yet, this
key perspective has not been fully appreciated in previously pro-
posed models of mindful self-regulation. As one begins to pay at-
tention, consistent curiosity and kind awareness allow greater
goal-driven control based on values, increased levels of internal-
ized motivation, greater access to intrinsic motivation, and
less reliance on stimulus-driven conditioning and evaluative
negative feedback systems, eventually unwinding associative
learning related to harmful behaviors. Behavior begins to
emerge that puts positive cues in the environment, potentially
activating healthy behaviors and supporting the behavior of
mindful noticing itself, which leads to a positive feedback
loop in favor of healthy behavior change. In this way, over
time MM may cause an evolution toward greater efficiency in
the human self-regulation system within a socio-environmental
context, leading to greater feelings of interconnection and
relatedness, and ultimately even supporting experiences of
self-transcendence.40

MBIs’ EFFECTS ON PSYCHIATRICALLY RELEVANT
BEHAVIOR CHANGE

Substance Use Disorders
Evidence supporting the impact of MBIs for alcohol (AUD)
and substance use (SUD) disorders has been growing,302–310
supporting a few key mechanisms underlying the effect.41,273,311,312
A meta-analysis of 42 studies in 2017 reported a small effect
of MBIs on substance misuse (standardized mean difference =
−0.33) and a moderate effect on substance-related craving
(standardized mean difference = −0.68).23 A three-arm RCT
enrolled abstinent intensive-outpatient and inpatient residen-
tial treatment program completers with SUD (n = 286), com-
paring mindfulness-based relapse prevention versus relapse
prevention versus treatment as usual on substance use out-
comes over 12 months. This study demonstrated mindfulness-
based relapse prevention had fewer drug use and
heavy-drinking days at 12 months compared with relapse
prevention alone.313 Mindfulness-based relapse prevention
is the most commonly studied MBI for SUD, while other

378

MBIs and mindfulness-informed interventions are also being
studied for various substances and stages of treatment (e.g.,
mindfulness-oriented recovery enhancement).274,314–318 While
the strength of evidence for mindfulness effects on certain SUDs
during specific stages of treatment is strong (e.g., AUD),319 evi-
dence for mindfulness and other SUDs is still emerging (e.g.,
methamphetamine, opioid use disorder).320–324

MBI studies for AUD/SUD support the general self-regulation
mechanisms above while also focusing on disorder-specific
deficits (e.g., reward processing, executive function, cue reac-
tivity). For instance, mindfulness reduces impulsivity among
people with opioid use disorder receiving methadone.197,325
MM may strengthen top-down cognitive control and repair
executive-function deficits326 among people with SUD (e.g.,
working memory, inhibitory control)106,326 by increasing ACC/
PFC activity and restoring frontostriatal connectivity.311 Mindful-
ness practice appears to partially decrease substance use through
reductions in craving.327,328 Craving reduction may be from
mindfulness strategies for decentering, acceptance, and atten-
tional control that reduce intrusive cognitive elaboration (i.e.,
dwelling in positive recollections or attempts to suppress them)
and that prevent cascades of emotional and physiologic reac-
tivity.329 Mindfulness enhances emotion regulation, decoupling
depression/negative affect from craving.327,328,330 MM encour-
ages acceptance, reducing thought suppression,329 which may
reduce craving since the suppression of thoughts/urges often am-
plifies craving.331 Mindfulness dampens limbic reactivity and
enhances vagal tone,332 reducing the amplitude and elaboration
of physiologic responses to stress and drug cues associated with
craving.333,334 Mindfulness also seems to facilitate physiological
recovery (e.g. high-frequency heart rate variability) with faster
attentional disengagement after substance-related cues105,335
and stress.336 Evidence is also emerging that MM and mindful
savoring practice may lead to restructuring reward process-
ing,273,337 potentially remediating opioid use disorder–related
hedonic dysregulation.338 By exposing practitioners to imaginal
and interoceptive substance-related cues during practice and
providing rewarding experiences (e.g., feelings of tranquility, cu-
riosity about the novelty of present-moment experience), MM
may allow extinction learning and a reversal of operant condi-
tioning, unwinding years of habit formation.273 Despite the
meta-analyses and efficacy and mechanistic studies supporting
a role for mindfulness in AUD/SUD treatment, critical issues re-
main: establishing an evidence base to support real-world imple-
mentation in clinical settings; adapting interventions for various
levels of care, patient readiness, and stages of treatment; deter-
mining the necessary dose of training at each level; and investi-
gating issues of scalability for diverse populations.305–307

Eating Behavior/Diet
The efficacy of MBIs on food-related behavior and weight
loss has been documented across multiple reviews and meta-
analyses.339–346 Among RCTs, MBIs have large effects on
the reduction of binge eating, emotional eating, and eating
when not feeling physically hungry,339,340,344 and moderate

Mindfulness and Behavior Change

effects on the improvement of eating attitudes.344 Small to
moderate effects were noted for weight loss.339,344,347 MBIs
that include both formal and informal practices (e.g., mindful
eating)339 or that are combined with cognitive-behavioral
therapy appear particularly beneficial.341,343

MBIs may promote enhanced self-regulation and intero-
ceptive regulation through increased ability to notice auto-
matic thoughts or affective cues, accurate appraisal of internal
stimuli, or increased awareness of craving, hunger, fullness,
and other factors influencing eating patterns.38,348–350 For
example, mindful eating promotes present-moment enjoyment
of food while reducing both overall caloric intake and
craving-related eating.351,352 Across studies of individuals
who are obese or overweight, MBIs reduced levels of de-
pression and anxiety with medium effect.344 This improve-
ment in psychological health may disrupt cycles of reactive
or emotional eating, foster self-compassion, and improve
self-concept.348,353,354 Overall, MBIs promote healthier be-
haviors around food and enhance psychological well-being,
resulting in weight loss or weight maintenance. More re-
search is needed to examine the efficacy of MBIs on sustained
weight loss.

In line with broader research on eating-related behaviors
and obesity, MBIs, including mindfulness-based eating aware-
ness training (MB-EAT),354,355 appear useful for the treatment
of binge eating disorder via similar mechanisms of ac-
tion.340,356,357 In a meta-analysis, studies of persons with
binge eating disorder demonstrated large effects for the reduc-
tion of eating pathology, emotional eating, negative affect,
and body dissatisfaction, along with a small effect for weight
loss.357 Additional research is needed to compare the efficacy
of MBIs to traditional approaches (e.g., cognitive-behavioral
therapy) for this pathology.358 Little is known about MBIs in
bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.356,358–362 Initial
meta-analytical reports are favorable, showing reduced eat-
ing pathology, emotional eating, and body dissatisfaction
with medium effect, as well as weight gain in some under-
weight participants.357 Across eating disorders, including
binge eating disorder, compassion-focused techniques and
mindfulness-informed interventions (e.g., DBT) may be use-
ful.358,361 Given the unique clinical characteristics of restric-
tive eating disorders, mindful eating may be distressing for
some individuals, especially with acute symptoms. While
MBIs show promise, more rigorous research is needed to un-
derstand their utility for eating disorder treatment.

Tobacco Smoking
The past decade has seen an evolution of treatments and stud-
ies on MBIs for tobacco smoking cessation, with mixed evi-
dence. Two meta-analyses, both of which included four
smoking-specific RCTs, found that MBIs were superior to
other evidence-based treatments. One reported a moderate ef-
fect (d = 0.42),22 and the other a relative risk of abstinence of
1.88 (1.04–3.40).363 A 2017 meta-analysis with ten RCTs
found that mindfulness-informed interventions (including

brief and mobile interventions) did not differ from compara-
tors.364 In a now somewhat dated 2015 systematic review,
only 13 of 198 articles on mindfulness and smoking were con-
trolled empirical studies, with the majority being pilot or fea-
sibility trials.365 The first RCT in 2011 compared mindfulness
training to cognitive-behavioral therapy (American Lung As-
sociation’s Freedom from Smoking), in which they found a
five-times greater cessation rate with mindfulness,366 which
a secondary analysis demonstrated was moderated by base-
line levels of nonjudgment, with less self-judgment of inner
experience supporting greater cessation with mindfulness
training.367 Another analysis showed mindfulness training
decoupled key links in the smoking reinforcement-learning
pathway (craving and smoking).368 As treatment has moved
digital, app-based paradigms have been tested, reporting sim-
ilar decoupling mechanisms.369,370 Recent work demon-
strated that app-based mindfulness training serves to target
DMN brain networks involved in “getting caught up” in crav-
ing206,371 in a dose-dependent manner, with the degree of
brain activity reduction in the posterior cingulate cortex
predicting smoking reductions, especially among women.372
More work is needed to replicate and extend findings.

Chronic Disease Self-Management
Self-management of chronic illness373,374 for common condi-
tions375 is a priority for improving health care.376,377 As chronic
physical illness is highly comorbid with mental illness,378 help-
ing patients develop skills to self-manage chronic illness is essen-
tial in psychiatry. Chronic illness is often comorbid with anxiety,
depression, trauma, and stress.379–381 Meta-analysis shows
small effects for MBIs on enhancing quality of life and reduc-
ing anxiety, depression, and stress during chronic illness.21
Reducing mental health symptoms through MM may sup-
port greater chronic disease self-management. For instance,
an eight-week MBI—integrated as health care treatment for
primary care patients with comorbid mental and physical chronic
illnesses—demonstrated increased rates of health-related action-
plan initiation compared with participants randomized to a
low-dose mindfulness comparator (OR = 2.91).20 A pilot
eight-week MBSR group adapted for hypertension demon-
strated significant changes in modifiable determinants of blood
pressure—physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption—
for those who were nonadherent to American Heart Associa-
tion guidelines at baseline, and changes were maintained at
one year.382 Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
who participated in an eight-week group program followed
by ten monthly sessions reported increased health behavior
changes and improvement in coping with illness.383 Qualita-
tive findings from 41 individuals with long-term conditions
participating in MBSR emphasized that “starting where I
am” facilitated changes related to coping with and managing
their illnesses.384 Mindfulness training helped lower blood
glucose levels385 and hemoglobin A1c386 among those with
type 2 diabetes but not among emerging adults with type 1 di-
abetes,387 suggesting further research is required.382 Longer-term

continuation groups beyond eight weeks and the addition of
kindness and compassion elements may be an important ad-
aptation for helping those living with chronic illness.388

Violence, Suicide/Self-Injury, and Other High-Risk
Behaviors
Impulsive violence and aggression are critical high-risk be-
haviors commonly monitored in psychiatry. A systematic re-
view on the effect of mindfulness on aggression and violence
included 22 adult studies (4 RCTs), concluding that MBIs
and mindfulness-informed interventions
including
DBT) had a significant impact, with effect sizes from 0.21 to
0.87.389 Mindfulness skills may decrease impulsive thought
and aggressive behavior through improved awareness of in-
ternal experience, reduction of experiential avoidance, and
attentional shifting.390–392 An RCT with 58 patients with
borderline personality disorder found decreased impulsive
behavior after DBT versus treatment as usual.393 An RCT
with 101 adults with recent partner aggression comparing ACT
versus support group reported ACT was more efficacious in
reducing physical and psychological aggression.394 An RCT
with 56 healthy adults comparing MBSR versus waitlist re-
ported MBSR decreased anger suppression and aggressive
anger expression.395 In conclusion, empirical evidence sug-
gests MBIs and mindfulness-informed interventions may reduce
impulsive and aggressive behaviors. More methodologically
rigorous research and meta-analyses are needed to confirm
this hypothesis.

Dispositional mindfulness is negatively associated with sui-
ideation (SI)396,397 and nonsuicidal self-injury.398,399
cidal
DBT has the most evidence for decreasing suicidal and
self-injurious behavior.400,401 In their systematic review,
Chesin and colleagues402 found six studies of MBIs and sui-
cidal behavior.403 Four studies reported inferential statistics
on the effect of MBIs on SI, with three reporting significant re-
ductions. The study that did not find a significant reduction
had relatively low baseline rates of SI, suggesting a possible
basement effect.404 Since that review, other studies have also
shown salubrious effects of MBIs on SI,405,406 with MBIs
appearing to uncouple the association between depressive
symptoms and SI.407 MBIs remediate some cognitive factors
and self-related processes shown to be risk factors for SI—for
example, self-critical rumination, hopelessness, and cognitive
reactivity to suicide408—but they do not mediate the im-
provement in SI.408 Thus, while MBIs may help reduce SI,
more needs to be studied regarding potential mechanisms.
The strongest evidence for nonsuicidal self-injury has been for
DBT, which is effective in reducing nonsuicidal self-injury urges
and behaviors in RCTs and meta-analyses, with particularly
consistent and strong evidence among adolescents.401,409,410
Studies of the effects of MBIs on nonsuicidal self-injury have
been proposed, but results have not yet been published to our
knowledge. One RCT, however, and several open-label trials
for ACT show promise.411,412

Dispositional mindfulness is positively correlated with in-
hibitory control and negatively correlated with impulsivity
and with compulsive and high-risk sexual behavior.391,413–420
One RCT with 28 adults comparing 12 individual ACT ses-
sions to a waitlist control condition to evaluate sexual impul-
sivity related to pornography showed a positive effect of the
intervention on compulsive sexual behaviors.421 Cross-sectional
data suggest that mindfulness training could reduce hypersexual
behavior.420,422 Spiritual self-schema therapy, a psychotherapy
that includes MM as its primary component, showed increased
motivation to reduce HIV risk behavior (i.e., sex without a con-
dom) in an RCT with 72 drug users,274 and completers of
the intervention had decreased impulsiveness on the Barratt
Impulsiveness Scale.197

DISCUSSION

Limitations of Current MBP Research
Many of the populations who may benefit from health-related
behavior change—those with a disproportionate burden and
comorbidity of chronic illness, substance use, and high-risk
behaviors—are underrepresented in current research on mind-
fulness and compassion–based programs. These populations
include trauma survivors,423,424 ethno-racial minorities425,426
(particularly those who identify as African American, Latinx,
or indigenous), sexual or gender minorities,166,427,428 refugee/
immigrant populations,429 and those at the intersection of
these marginalized groups.430 While MBPs may be beneficial
for addressing difficulties experienced by these populations
(e.g., mindfulness-based relapse prevention may be more effec-
tive when delivered within groups composed primarily of
ethnic/racial minorities),431,432 the current research base dis-
proportionately represents well-educated, Caucasian, econom-
ically advantaged individuals.166,425 The paucity of ethno-racial
diversity in both MBP researchers433 and MBP research partic-
ipants166,425 mirrors the lack of diversity in psychological and
biomedical research.434

While the level of MM practice engagement is often pre-
dictive of outcomes,435 trait mindfulness can be measured in
the general non-meditating population, where it contributes
to self-regulated behavior and positive affect.436 Moreover,
even though eight weeks of MBP group training with a silent
day of practice (23 hours in total) was more effective than a
one-hour introduction to MM in catalyzing health behavior
change, evidence supporting what dose intensity is required
for behavior change is not yet definitive.20,437 Many door-
ways to discovering mindfulness likely exist, and those that
are culturally inclusive of marginalized populations are more
likely to be experienced as open doors, supporting greater
access.438 While MBPs are well researched, with reliable
dose-related effects within certain demographic groups,435,439
MBPs as currently designed are unlikely to be the exclusive op-
timal format for all. Innovations like rolling admissions in
mindfulness-based relapse prevention represent an initial step
toward accessibility.440 Overall, demands for the consistency

Mindfulness and Behavior Change

and integrity of MBPs need to be balanced with cultural acces-
sibility in clinical dissemination research.

The future accessibility, relevance, and ethical dissemina-
tion of existing MBPs will depend on adequate training of di-
verse MBP teachers/facilitators and on research agendas that
prioritize overlapping areas of cultural humility, cultural ac-
cessibility, and trauma-sensitive delivery of MBPs, particu-
larly for those affected by historical and intergenerational
traumas.441 Given the potential relationship between interoception
and social power,442 internalized oppression,443 and chronic
illness,173,444,445 future research is needed on interventions
that cultivate embodiment and interoception,285 including
movement,446 drumming,447,448 music,449–452 and dance453
—which may be more culturally accessible and specifically
helpful for people with intergenerational trauma,454 and
serve to foster social connectedness for marginalized popula-
tions with chronic illnesses.453

Future Directions: Adverse Effects, Trauma-Informed
Training, Dose Effects
Adverse effects have been largely undocumented in the MBP
research field. A systematic review of mindfulness-based
stress-reduction or cognitive-therapy RCTs reported that only
15.6% of 231 studies included any statement about adverse
events.455 Yet, potential adverse effects may include panic,
physical pain, reexperiencing of traumatic memories, and dis-
sociative symptoms.301 More needs to be understood about
how program, participant, and teacher/leader factors contrib-
ute to adverse events.456 Britton457 and Grant and Schwartz458
propose a research agenda that takes into account that un-
wanted effects may emerge when aspects of mindfulness, such
as decentering, focus on body sensations, and present-moment
focus, are overemphasized. As the forms of adverse effects and
reactions to symptoms vary based on individual and context,
teachers and leaders should train in how to best monitor
for, and respond to, adverse effects in MBP research.459,460

Program design and training must be sensitive to potential
adverse effects experienced by trauma survivors. A majority
of individuals will experience a traumatic life event, and a
subset of these will develop posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).461 During MBPs, trauma survivors may be more
likely to experience certain adverse effects such as traumatic
flashbacks301 and dissociation.462 Trauma-informed training
assumes that everyone might have a trauma history and fo-
cuses on offering choice, de-shaming adverse effects, supporting
individual agency, and responding skillfully to trauma-related
effects when they arise.424,460 MBPs have the potential to
substantially reduce PTSD symptomology and to support
neurobiological changes in networks implicated in PTSD
psychopathology.111,463–469 Future research is needed on
interventions that incorporate self-compassion, as it may
mitigate and transform the shame-based nature of PTSD.470
When patients with PTSD are immersed within a safe, validat-
ing, healing community, such as well-designed trauma-informed

MBP groups featuring self-compassion, they are likely to suc-
cessfully initiate meaningful behavior changes.20

Finally, future clinical trials should include validated as-
says in clinical settings measuring the impact of dose effects
on the self-regulation components described herein, and the
extent to which each component mediates health behavior
change.471 More dismantling and dose-response studies could
help clarify the most active components and their individual
contributions.120,472 Care should be taken with this investiga-
tive approach, however, since it carries risks of oversimplifying
MBPs to just a collection of techniques in a toolbox.473 When
mindfulness programs are offered solely from this instrumental
dimension of a skill to be acquired,241 then the synergistic,
holistic, and seemingly paradoxical approach to cultivating
mindfulness, which many patients experience as engaging and
deeply healing in MBPs, may be unwittingly sacrificed.

CONCLUSION
A growing evidence base supports the benefits of mindfulness
for behavior change. A mindful self-regulation model based
on an integration of neuroscientific findings describes the
complex and synergistic effects of attention/cognitive control,
emotion regulation, and self-related processes, as well as mo-
tivation and learning mechanisms that may provide a unique
pathway toward sustainable behavior change. While evi-
dence supports the impact of mindfulness on behavior change
for key health behaviors related to psychiatric practice, more
high-quality research is needed, especially with objective mea-
sures, larger samples, replication studies, active controls, and
formal monitoring of adverse events.474 The field will also
benefit from additional research on the impact of integrating
compassion practices and from a focus on trauma-sensitive
adaptations for diverse populations.
