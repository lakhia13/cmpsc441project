Abstract 
Background  Natural disasters cause long term psychological consequences, especially post-traumatic stress disor-
ders. It has been regarded as the most prevalent of psychiatric disorders after a natural disaster. The purpose of this 
study is to estimate the prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and determine its associated factors in 
adult survivors three years after the 2015 Nepal earthquake.

Methods  A cross-sectional descriptive design was used where 1076 adults within the age range of 19–65 were 
randomly selected and interviewed from four adversely affected districts due to the 2015 earthquake. Instruments 
included a demographic questionnaire, an earthquake exposure questionnaire, the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS), 
and the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Descriptive and inferential statistics were 
applied using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 16 for data analysis.

Results  The prevalence of PTSD among earthquake survivors was 18.9%. The multivariate logistic regression showed 
that gender, ethnicity, education, occupation, social support and severity of damage to house and property were sig-
nificantly associated with PTSD. Odds of having PTSD was 1.6 times higher among females (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1–2.3) 
and nearly 2 times higher amongst illiterate survivors (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2–2.8). Participants from the Janajati ethnic 
group and those who had a business occupation had a 50% lower risk of having PTSD. Around 39% of the participants 
had moderate social support and had 60% lower odds of having PTSD compared to those with poor social support 
(AOR = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.2–0.5, p < 0.001). Participants with medium and very high-level damage to personal property 
were more likely to have PTSD.

Conclusion  Post-traumatic stress disorder remained prevalent amongst survivors three years after the 2015 Nepal 
Earthquake. It is important to provide psychological and social support for survivors to decrease the health burden 
from PTSD. Socio-demographic characteristics such as females, farmers, those survivors who endured significant per-
sonal property damage were at higher risk.

Background
Nepal  was  hit  by  a  devastating  7.8  magnitude  earth-
quake  with  its  epicenter  in  Barpak,  Gorkha  District, 
northwest of Kathmandu, at 11:55 a.m on April 25, 2015 
(Nepal  Standard  Time).  17  days  later,  on  May  12,  2015, 
another 6.8 magnitude aftershock caused further damage

and  suffering  [1].  These  two  large  earthquakes  resulted 
in  considerable  property  damage.  In  several  districts, 
people’s  lives  and  infrastructure  were  in  jeopardy  [2]. 
The  earthquake  caused  8,896  fatalities  and  22,303  seri-
ously  injured  patients.  More  than  600,000  households 
were  fully  damaged  leaving  300,000  partially  damaged. 
Of these households, it is estimated that 450,000 people 
remained homeless [1, 3]. According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), 20% of people in post-earthquake 
and other humanitarian situations experience psycholog-
ical  distress,  with  a  lower  minority  (3–4%)  experiencing 
severe mental disorders [4].

Earthquakes  are  one  of  the  world’s  major  calamities. 
With  very  little  warning,  it  destroys  personal  property 
and  lives  [5].  It  may  affect  people  physically  as  well  as 
mentally,  causing  them  to  be  more  afraid  of  the  earth-
quake  due  to  its  unpredictable  and  unforeseen  nature 
[6].These  experiences  can  be  traumatic  especially  to  the 
children, women and elderly [5]. Physical injuries can be 
treatable, as it can be viewed externally, but mental injury 
is often ignored as it is not visible [5].

More  than  two-thirds  of  the  world’s  populations  have 
experienced  an  earthquake  at  some  point  in  their  lives, 
resulting  in  a  wide  range  of  mental  and  physical  health 
consequences [2]. Approximately two-thirds of the PTSD 
patients may improve over time, while for others, it may 
continue to damage their cognitive and behavioral func-
tioning for years. As a result, it is necessary to give ancil-
lary resources and social support in the aftermath of an 
earthquake  to  assist  individuals  in  coping  with  stressful 
effects of an earthquake [5].

Numerous  previous  studies  outside  of  Nepal  have 
shown  the  prevalence  rate  of  depression  after  earth-
quakes ranging from 16 to 28 percent, while PTSD prev-
alence rates range from 7 to 40 percent [7–9]. Similarly, 
a  study  done  in  China  (Wenchuan,  2008)  found  that 
the  prevalence  of  PTSD  in  earthquake  survivors  varied 
from 10.3 to 66%. Prevalence correlated with the level of 
trauma  exposure  and  proximity  to  the  epicenter  of  the 
earthquake  [10].  Another  study  one  year  after  the  2008 
Wenchuan  earthquake  showed  that  the  prevalence  of 
PTSD was 40.1% in Wenchuan, China, over the four-year 
period  following  its  2008  [8].  According  to  a  systematic 
review  of  mental  health  disorders  following  the  Great 
East  Japan  Earthquake  in  2011,  the  reported  prevalence 
of  PTSD  ranged  from  10  to  53.5%,  while  the  prevalence 
of depression ranged from 3.0 to 43.7% [11].

Previous  mental  health  research  in  Nepal  has  focused 
on  heightened  rates  of  psychological  distress  among 
a  substantial  proportion  of  the  population  affected  by 
the  2015  Nepal  earthquakes,  with  a  smaller  propor-
tion  reporting  more  severe  mental  health  and  psy-
chosocial  difficulties  [3].  Research  conducted  in  2015 

Dhadingdistrict earthquake survivors showed the preva-
lence  of  PTSD  at  18.5%  [5].  Another  study  amongst-
adolescents  in  Sindhupalchok  and  Kathmandu  districts 
showed  a  PTSD  prevalence  of  39.5%  and  10.7%  three 
years  after  the  earthquake  [12].  The  literature  review 
retrieved PTSD measures immediately after earthquakes 
at 4, 9, 10 and 14 months in Nepal, concluding that PTSD 
remains for a long time [2, 5, 13, 14].
community-based 
cross-sectional 
research,  27.5  percent  to  33.7  percent  of  individu-
als  passed  the  Beck  Depression  Inventory  criterion  for 
depression,  22.9  percent  to  27.7  percent  for  anxiety  and 
9.6 percent for PTSD [15, 16]. According to longitudinal 
follow-up, the frequency was higher among women and 
older age groups, as well as following armed conflict [16, 
17].

According 

to 

In  a  quantitative  survey  of  513  community  members, 
those  with  symptom  scores  suggesting  depression  (34.2 
percent),  anxiety  (33.8  percent),  and  alcohol-use  issues 
(20.4%)  were  in  greater  proportions  than  those  with 
PTSD symptoms (5.2 percent) [3]. In the four months fol-
lowing the earthquake, the prevalence of suicidal ideation 
was alarmingly high, at 10.9 percent [3, 18].

According to a study by S. Sherchan et al., following the 
earthquake,  mental  health  services  were  offered  in  the 
form  of  hospital-based  clinical  services,  mobile  health 
camps, and health worker training workshops to deliver 
basic mental health services [19].

Despite  the  fact  that  long-term  psychological  conse-
quences  of  disasters  are  significant  and  common,  little 
attention  has  been  paid  to  the  long-term  psychological 
consequences  of  disasters  [20].  More  research  on  the 
long-term  psychosocial  consequences  of  disasters  is 
neededespecially  in  Nepal  as  the  country  is  at  risk  of 
major  earthquakes  in  the  future  [21,  22].  To  our  knowl-
edge,  little  research  has  been  conducted  in  this  area 
3  years  after  the  Nepal  earthquake.  Few  studies  have 
researched  prevalence  or  quality  of  life  in  individuals 
with  trauma/PTSD  [23].  A  systematic  review  revealed 
that most of the research was done 1 to 20 months after 
the  2015  earthquake  in  Nepal  in  limited  earthquake 
affected areas only [24]. The finding of PTSD was mostly 
present among the earthquake survivors with rates vary-
ing  from  4.9%  to  51%.  Gender  and  age  were  associated 
factors  for  this  study.  However,  earthquake  related  vari-
ables  weren’t  observed  in  this  study  [24].  Therefore,  the 
goal of this study is to fill a gap in the literature by looking 
at  the  prevalence  of  PTSD  and  associated  socio-demo-
graphic  factors  in  adult  survivors  who  are  living  in  the 
most affected areas beyond 3 years after the 2015 earth-
quake. The identification of variables that are of influence 
in  the  2015  earthquake  in  Nepal  can  educate  and  assist 
researchers in future exploration of the topic.

Methods
Study design, site and study population

in 

four 

The  research  was  a  descriptive  cross-sectional  study 
earthquake-affected  districts 
conducted 
(Gorkha,  Dolakha,  Sindhupalchowk  and  Bhaktapur) 
in  2019,  three  years  after  the  Nepal  earthquake.  The 
study  population  were  young,  middle  and  older  adults 
who  were  the  survivors  of  the  devastating  earthquake. 
Data was collected from 1076 randomly selected adults 
from  the  four  adversely-affected  districts.  Participants 
aged  between  19  and  65  years,  who  had  experienced 
the  earthquake,  2015  in  Nepal  and  spoke  Nepali  were 
included  in  the  study.  Participants  who  had  hearing 
problems,  poor  verbal  communication,  severe  disease 
conditions,  who  were  already  identified  or  recorded  in 
a  health  facility  as  intellectually  disabled,  dementia  or 

any other major psychosis, and severe mental disorders 
under medication were excluded from the study.

Sampling strategy

Sample  size  calculation  was  done  (Fig.  1)  for  the  four 
most  earthquake  affected  districts  (Gorkha,  Dolakha, 
Sindhupalchowk  and  Bhaktapur).  The  sample  size  from 
Gorkha was 358, 182 from Dolakha, 256 from Sindhupal-
chowk and 280 from Bhaktapur to make the final sample 
size of 1076.

(firstly), 

three  rural  municipalities 

Multi-stage  random  sampling  was  done.  At  the  first 
(Gorkha, 
stage 
Dolakha,  Sindhupalchowk)  and  one  urban  municipal-
ity  (Bhaktapur)  were  selected  randomly.  The  list  of  the 
total number of administrative wards in each of the four 
municipalities and the total number of houses destroyed 
in each of the wards was obtained from the ward offices.

The  household  destruction  percentage  of  each  ward 
was  calculated.  On  the  basis  of  the  household  destruc-
tion  percentage,  the  wards  with  over  50  percent  house-
hold  destruction  were  considered  as  the  most  affected. 
Secondly,  one  of  the  most  affected  wards  was  selected 
through  simple  random  sampling  (lottery  method) 
from  each  four  municipalities.  Thirdly,  systematic  ran-
dom  sampling  was  done  to  select  households.  Due  to 
the earthquake and internal migration, it was difficult to 
determine the population size and the list of people (age 
19–65 years) in selected wards.

The  total  number  of  households  and  the  sampling 
frame  (list  of  households)  in  the  selected  wards  were 
obtained from respective ward offices. The total number 
of  present  households  in  each  ward  was  divided  by  the 
required sample size of the respective ward to determine 
the different kth intervals for each of the four wards.

The  first  household  was  selected  through  a  lottery 
method. Then, every kth household was selected for the 
study  from  the  list  of  households  in  each  ward  accord-
ingly  until  the  required  sample  size  was  met.  Only  one 
participant of age 19 to 65 years within a household was 
recruited for interview through lottery method to ensure 
independence of study subjects.

Ethical considerations

This  study  was  approved  by  the  Institutional  Review 
Committee  of  Kathmandu  University  School  of  Medi-
cal  Sciences  at  Dhulikhel,  Nepal.  All  participants  were 
informed  about  the  purpose  and  procedures  of  the 
study.  Participation  in  the  study  was  voluntary.  They 
were allowed to withdraw their consent and discontinue 
the  research  interview  at  any  time.  Before  the  interview 
began,  written  informed  consent  was  taken  from  the 
participants.  Anonymity  and  privacy  of  the  participants 
were maintained during data collection.

Data collection tools

Face to face interview was conducted using a structured 
questionnaire.  Before  data  collection,  four  enumerators 
with Bachelor’s degree in nursing were called together to 
review  the  questionnaire  and  each  item  was  explained. 
They  were  also  trained  for  face-to-face  interview  meth-
ods.  The  first  part  of  the  questionnaire  included  socio-
demographic  questionnaire  such  as  age,  gender,  marital 
status, ethnicity, religion, occupation and literacy status. 
The  second  part  included  a  questionnaire  about  earth-
quake  exposure  such  as  self-injury,  loss  of  family  or 
friends, loss of house and property, witness of burial, etc. 
Earthquake  exposure  was  considered  “Exposed”  when 
participants  answered  “Yes”  to  any  of  these  earthquake 
exposure related questionnaires.

In the third part, post-traumatic stress symptoms were 
assessed  using  the  subscale  of  PTSD  Checklist-Civilian 
Version (PCL-C) to assess PTSD prevalence. The PCL-C 
version is a commonly used instrument to assess PTSD. 
It  has  17  items  which  measures  three  clusters  of  symp-
toms  that  record  into  diagnostic  Criteria  B  (re-experi-
encing),  C  (avoidance/  numbing),  and  D  (hyperarousal) 
for PTSD in the Diagnostic statistical manual for mental 
health  (DSM-IV)  was  adopted  (Ni  et  al.,  2013)  [25,  26]. 
This  tool  allows  the  participant  to  indicate  the  extent 
to  which  each  symptom  is  correlated  with  the  earth-
quake on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The 
Nepali translated version of the PCL-C was administered 
for  measuring  PTSD.  The  value  of  Cronbach  alpha  in 
this  study  for  PCL-C  was  found  to  be  0.95,  which  pos-
sesses excellent internal consistency. All three clusters of 
symptoms were found to be acceptable in this study set-
ting. The area under the curve for B, C and D groups of 
symptoms  were  0.97,  0.98,  and  0.96  respectively,  which 
shows  the  tool  is  acceptable  in  Nepalese  contests  [5].  A 
provisional  PTSD  diagnosis  can  be  made  by  adding  up 
all  items  for  a  total  severity  score  or  treat  response  cat-
egories  3–5  (moderately  or  above)  as  symptomatic  and 
responses  1–2  (below  moderately)  as  non-symptomatic, 
then the DSM criteria is used for its diagnosis. The maxi-
mal  total  score  for  17  items  is  85.  Participants  with  a 
score of 50 or greater were classified as having probable 
PTSD.  With  a  PCL-C  score  of  50  as  the  diagnostic  cut-
off,  the  sensitivity  was  approximately  80%  [23,  27–34]. 
According  to  a  study  done  in  Nepal,  the  value  of  Cron-
bach  alpha  of  PCL-C  was  found  to  be  0.95,  which  pos-
sesses excellent internal consistency [5]. The PCL-C was 
previously  validated  in  Nepal  with  total  scores  of  50  or 
above indicative of probable PTSD (Thapa&Hauff, 2005, 
Dhungana, 2021) [3, 23, 35]. Besides Nepal, a study done 
in 3372 pregnant women in Peru revealed the reliability 
of the PCL-C was excellent (α = 0.90). Receiver operating 
characteristics analysis showed that a cut-off score of 26 
offered optimal discriminatory power, with sensitivity of 
0.86 (95% CI: 0.78 – 0.92) and a specificity was found of 
0.63 (95% CI: 0.62 – 0.65) [36].

The  social  support  scale  was  the  fourth  section  of  the 
questionnaire.  The  Oslo  3-items  Social  Support  Scale 
(OSSS-3)  is  one  of  the  best  indicators  of  mental  health 
since it is a brief measure of social functioning. It assesses 
the  number  of  persons  with  whom  the  respondent  feels 
close, as well as the level of attention and care provided 
by  others  and  the  ease  with  which  they  can  seek  prac-
tical  assistance.  The  Oslo  Social  Support  scale  scores 
ranged  from  3–14,  with  3–8  indicating  low  (poor)  sup-
port, 9–11 indicating moderate support, and 12–14 indi-
cating  strong  support  [37].  Internal  consistency  for  the 
Oslo  Social  Support  Scale  was  found  to  be  good  with 

Acharya Pandey et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:340

the Cronbach alpha of 0.82, which was also validated in 
Nepal [5].

Finally,  data  was  collected  from  1076  total  adult  sur-
vivors  (one  in  each  house)  selected  from  four  different 
districts.

Data analysis

All data were analyzed by statistical software SPSS 16.0. 
Descriptive  analysis  was  done  to  report  frequency,  per-
centage,  mean  and  standard  deviation.  Chi-square  test 
was  done  to  find  association  between  PTSD  and  soci-
odemographic  variables,  earthquake  exposure  variables 
and  social  support.  Binary  logistic  regression  was  used 
to determine the relationship between PTSD and socio-
demographic  variables,  earthquake  exposure  variables 
and social support.

P  value  of < 0.05  was  considered  to  be  statistically 

significant.

Results
Table  1  depicts  the  distribution  of  socio-demographic 
variables,  social  support  and  their  association  with 
PTSD.  The  prevalence  of  PTSD  was  18.9%.  The  socio 
demographic  variables  were  associated  with  PTSD  such 
as age (p = 0.003), gender (p = 0.001), ethnicity (p < 0.001), 
education (p < 0.001), marital status (p = 0.010) and occu-
pation (p < 0.001). Social support was also associated with 
PTSD (p < 0.001).

In  the  study,  most  of  the  participants  (88.4%)  were 
young and middle adults where 17.6% of them had PTSD 
and  28.8%  of  older  adults  had  PTSD.  Again,  more  than 
half of the participants (56.3%) were females where 22.3% 
of females and 14.5% of males had PTSD. More than half 
of the participants (59.2) belonged to the Janajati ethnic 
group where 14.8% of them had PTSD. Majority (75.4%) 
of participants were Hindu and 18% of them had PTSD. 
Likewise, majority (79.6%) were literate and only 15% of 
them  had  PTSD.  Most  of  the  participants  (82.3%)  were 
married  and  among  them  20%  had  PTSD.  Agriculture 
was  the  most  common  (49.7%)  occupation  among  the 
participants where 26% of them had PTSD.

Regarding  social  support  scale,  nearly  half  of  the  par-
ticipants (46%) had poor social support. Among partici-
pants with poor social support, 26.3% of them had PTSD. 
In  participants  who  had  moderate  social  support,  only 
9.8% had PTSD and in people with strong social support, 
19% had PTSD.

Earthquake exposure of the participants

Majority  (87%)  of  the  respondents  were  exposed  to 
the  earthquake  characteristics.  Regarding  earthquake 
exposure  of  the  participants,  most  of  the  exposure  vari-
ables  were  associated  with  PTSD  such  as  self-buried

capped and relatives and friends being handicapped were 
not associated with PTSD.

Majority  of  the  participants  (92.4%)  had  lost  house 
or  property  in  the  earthquake.  Among  them,  20%  had

PTSD.  Among  the  82  participants  who  were  self-bur-
ied,  30.5%  had  PTSD.  Twenty  two  percent  of  the  par-
ticipants  who  had  witnessed  death  in  earthquake  had 
PTSD.  Again,  among  the  participants  who  had  death 
in  their  family,  26%  of  them  had  PTSD.  The  estimates 
related to earthquake exposure are not shown in tables.

Table  2  illustrates  the  relationship  between  PTSD 
and  several  associated  factors.  The  multivariate  logis-
tic  regression  shows  that  gender,  ethnicity,  education, 
occupation,  social  support  and  severity  of  damage  to 
house  and  property  are  significantly  associated  with 
PTSD.  Odds  of  having  PTSD  is  1.6  times  higher  among 
females compared to males (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1–2.3,

odds  of  having  PTSD  compared  to  Brahmin/Chhetri 
(AOR = 0.6,  95%CI:  0.4–0.9;  p = 0.017).  Participants  who

erty  or  very  less  damage  (AOR = 4.9,  95%CI:2.3–10.5,

Discussion
Earthquakes cause significant stress and affect a substan-
tial number of people in the world. The 2015 earthquake 
in Nepal was a dreadful disaster with a painful impact on 
many  survivors.  Three  years  after  the  disaster,  affected 
people  have  yet  to  fully  recover.  This  cross-sectional 
study  emerged  within  the  four  selected  most  affected 
districts.  The  PTSD  prevalence  assessed  using  PCL-C 
(DSM-IV) criteria was remarkably high three years after 
the disaster.

Prevalence of the PTSD

The  present  study  found  that  the  prevalence  of  PTSD 
three years after a devastating earthquake is 18.9% among 
earthquake-affected  adult  survivors,  which  is  consistent 
with  previous  studies  done  in  Nepal  on  mental  health 
problems  nine  months  after  the  2015  Nepal  earthquake 
[5].

A  study  containing  forty-six  eligible  articles  showed 
the  combined  incidence  of  PTSD  among  survivors  who 
were  diagnosed,  at  no  more  than  nine  months  after  the 
earthquake,  was  28.76%,  while  for  survivors  who  were 
diagnosed  at  over  nine  months  after  earthquake  the 
combined  incidence  was  19.48%  [38].  This  result  shows 
the prevalence of PTSD remains high years later. A study 
on  1355  adults  from  the  2010  Haiti  earthquake  after 
30 months (about 2 and half years) found the prevalence 
rates of PTSD was 36.75%, which is higher than our study 
[39]. The PTSD was measured by the clinician using life 
events checklist subscale [39].

Similarly, our  prevalence rates are  lower  than the 40% 
rate  three  years  after  the  Turkey  earthquake.  The  epi-
center  was  predominantly  government-constructed 
housing. The  study  used  the  Traumatic  Stress  Symptom 
Checklist  (TSSC),  which  included  17  DSM  IV  PTSD, 
55.2%  female,  33.4%  male  reported  eighteen  months 

after  the  Kashmir  earthquake  those  people  were  living 
in tents, 28.5% reported 11 months after the 2015 Nepal 
earthquake, 23% reported 14 months after the epicenter 
of Turkey earthquake, 22.1% reported 8 months after the 
2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China [10, 40–43].

Most  long-term  studies  of  prevalence  of  PTSD  in  dis-
aster  exposed  survivors  show  that  the  prevalence  of 
PTSD  decreases  with  time  [44].  In  contrast,  some  stud-
ies  show  that  there  might  be  a  rise  in  the  prevalence  of 
PTSD. In the years following exposure to the 2001 World 
Trade  Center  disaster,  the  prevalence  of  PTSD  among 
firefighters  was  shown  to  increase  over  time,  from  9.8% 
in  the  first  year  (2002)  to  10.6%  in  the   4th  year  (2005) 
(p = 0.0001), using the same scale as ours [45].

A  literature  review  shows  that  most  researchers  who 
studied PTSD rates occurred around three months after 
the  earthquake  [10].  Even  after  powerful  quakes  (Wen-
chuan),  the  prevalence  rate  of  PTSD  was  seen  lower 
than other reports in the short term, however, our study 
focused on the potential long-term effects after an earth-
quake.  These  differences  may  be  explained  by  factors 
such  as  the  loss  of  family,  loss  of  property,  loss  of  job, 
self-injury/buried,  gender,  strength  of  coping,  type  of 
exposure, location of the disaster and diagnosis measure 
(tools) of PTSD. Compared with current study results of 
Nuwakot (2016) the prevalence (24.10%) was found to be 
higher in the Nepal earthquake after 10 months, it might 
be because of the short duration after an earthquake than 
ours [2]. This is also supported by a study done in China 
after 9 month of an earthquake which found PTSD 24.2% 
by using DSM IV criteria [46].

A  study  done  in  the  Sichuan  and  Shaanxi  provinces 
of  China,  2  earthquake-stricken  areas,  showed  that  the 
1  –year  prevalence  of  PTSD  amongst  2080  adult  survi-
vors  was  40.1%  [8].  Three  years  after  the  same  earth-
quake  it  was  found  that  10.3%  of  the  respondents  had 
PTSD  [47].  Similarly,  a  population  survey  done  among 
1756 respondents aged 16–98 in the 1991 earthquake in 
Yu-Chi, Taiwan found that at 6 months and 3 years, the 
estimated rate of Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) 
was  23.8%  and  4.4%  respectively  [48].  Likewise,  another 
study (Turkey) showed PTSD prevalence dropped by the 
length of time after the earthquake [43]. However, some 
other  studies  suggest  the  prevalence  of  PTSD  has  not 
decreased as time goes on [42, 47, 49].

After an extensive literature review and comparing our 
results  we  conclude  that  many  factors  contribute  to  the 
prevalence of PTSD symptoms amongst earthquake sur-
vivors. Further comparison is limited due to lack of stud-
ies  measuring  the  prevalence  of  PTSD  among  survivors 
three  years  after  the  earthquake  in  Nepal.  We  can  also 
assume  that  variation  may  exist  between  magnitude  of 
earthquake,  assessment  tools,  type  of  study  (qualitative, 

 Acharya Pandey et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:340

quantitative)  and  coping  strategies  adopted  by  individu-
als after a traumatic event.

In  our  study,  there  was  a  significant  association 
(p = 0.003)  with  age  group  and  PTSD.  In  the  age  group 
of 60 and above, participants had the highest prevalence 
of  PTSD  (28.8%).  These  findings  were  consistent  with  a 
study done in Dhading Nepal, 9 months after the earth-
quake  where  adolescents  and  the  elderly  were  associ-
ated  with  a  higher  incidence  of  PTSD  [5,  50].  Similarly, 
another study done in Nepal (2019) and other countries 
(China, 2011, 2013 and 2014, Tehran, 2017), revealed that 
the  elderly  were  more  likely  to  have  PTSD  compared  to 
younger  adult  survivors  [2,  8,  51–54].  Our  result  is  also 
consistent with a study done by Bhat W. et al. where age 
was one of the best predictors of PTSD prevalence [55].

Although our study is consistent with most other stud-
ies,  it  was  inconsistent  with  the  findings  done  in  Wen-
chuan  one  month  after  the  earthquake,  which  revealed 
the prevalence of PTSD as in young and middle age adult 
was 78.8% [56]. One probable reason is the ‘burden per-
spective  hypotheses’,  which  suggests  that  middle-aged 
adults  experience  poorer  coping  capacity  than  others 
because  of  their  responsibilities  to  society  (e.g.  work-
ing)  and  to  the  family  (e.g.  often  providing  support  to 
both children and parents), which can render them more 
psychologically vulnerable in the aftermath of the disas-
ter [57, 58]. Older adults have a high coping mechanism 
according to socio-cultural structure (potential spiritual, 
religious beliefs), which is consistent with a study done by 
Palgi.  Y.  [59,  60].  Moreover,  older  people  were  reported 
to learn coping mechanisms from experience; also, older 
age  was  associated  with  less  sensitivity,  fewer  negative 
beliefs, and decreased mood symptoms [61].

Gender  difference  in  prevalence  of  PTSD  was  also 
noted  in  our  study.  Females  were  found  to  have  a  1.6 
times higher odds ratio of developing PTSD compared to 
males. This is consistent with a study done by Lama et al. 
[54].

Gender  differences  are  also  supported  from  previous 
studies done in Nepal (2018) and other countries (China, 
2015, Pakistan, 2011, 2013, and China, 2013) [5, 53, 61–
66]. A study by Shrestha after the 2015 Nepal Earthquake 
also revealed higher PTSD amongst female medical per-
sonnel [67]. Higher PTSD risk among women may be due 
to  their  stronger  perceptions  of  threat  and  loss  of  con-
trol  [2].  In  addition,  it  is  possible  that  women  are  more 
susceptible  to  negative  events  and  tend  to  express  their 
emotions  more  than  males  [5].  Literature  even  explains 
gender differences in neuro-endocrine response that may 
lead to higher risk of PTSD in women [68].

In  our  study,  illiterate  survivors  were  nearly  2  times 
more likely to have PTSD compared to literate survivors. 
This is consistent with a study in Wenchuan (2012), where 

PTSD  was  found  to  be  52.6%  among  respondents 
with  a  low  level  of  education  (primary  and  secondary) 
compared  with  a  university  degree  (master’s  and  bach-
elor’s  degree).  Another  survey  result  revealed  that  in 
Nepal,  the  prevalence  of  PTSD  was  13.9%  among  liter-
ate  survivors,  while  illiterate  accounted  for  38.1%  [2, 
50].  A  lower  education  level  may  contribute  to  patients 
being  less  informedwhich  may  decrease  confidence 
in both physical and mental recovery [2].

The  results  of  the  present  study  differs  from  a 
study  conducted  in  Haiti  and  other  countries  (China, 
Pakistan) which showed that higher education increases 
levels of PTSD [39, 62, 65]. Our study also disagrees with 
studies  by  Contractor,  AA  and  Khodadadi-H.  et  al. 
which found that participants with a high school educa-
tion  were  more  likely  to  have  PTSD  [69]. Their  hypoth-
esis  for  these  results  is  that  due  to  their  increased  level 
of  education  they  may  be  moreinclined  to  worry  about 
future consequences regarding earthquake than illiterate 
respondents.

Our study found that ethnicity also had an association 
with PTSD symptoms. In the current literature, ethnicity 
has not been consistently described as a risk factor asso-
ciated with PTSD [37, 68].

In  our  study,  the  profession  of  respondents  was  also 
found  to  have  an  association  with  PTSD.  This  is  sup-
ported  by  a  study  conducted  in  China  5  years  after  the 
earthquake  in  2013  [62].  The  major  occupation  of  the 
people  residing  in  Wenchuan,  China  was  fish  farming 
(aquaculture). It was impacted or destroyed by the 2008 
earthquake,  and,  as  a  result,  their  source  of  income  was 
affected  [62].  Similarly,  a  study  revealed  psychological 
health  disturbances  were  more  common  in  farmers  and 
farmworkers, conducted by Daghagh Yazd S et al. [70].

People  engaged  in  other  occupations  where  less  likely 
to develop PTSD when compared with farmers or those 
engaged in agriculture. Our result was consistent with a 
study done by Mitsuaki Katayanagi et al. which revealed 
that after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 nearly 
half of the farmers who were engaged in agriculture and 
fishery  reported  decreased  income  [71].  It  is  possible 
that  these  survivors  had  fewer  resources  in  coping  with 
the stress from the economic burden than those of other 
occupations  [62].  This  may  resulted  in  a  higher  PTSD 
rate amongst farmers [62].

In  our  study  perceived  social  support  was  associated 
with  PTSD  in  both  univariate  and  multivariate  analy-
sis  (p < 0.001).  In  this  study,  participants  with  moder-
ate  social  support  had  70%  lower  odds  of  having  PTSD 
compared to those with poor social support (AOR = 0.3, 
95%CI:  0.2–0.5,  p < 0.001).  These  findings  are  similar 
to  findings  by  Asnakew  S.  et  al.  who  found  that  par-
ticipants  with  poor  social  support  were  3.6  times  more 

Acharya Pandey et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:340 

Page 9 of 12

likely  to  develop  PTSD  than  those  with  strong  social 
support (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI from 2.0 to 6.7) [72]. Other 
research  has  shown  that  there  is  a  possible  positive 
effect of social support for the prevention of PTSD. Social 
support  will  not  benefit  everyone  equally.  Numerous 
confounding variables, including gender, previous experi-
ences of violent trauma, and self-efficacy, appear to play a 
role  [73].  Another  study  by  Dai  W  et  al  in  2016  found 
that strong social support can not only protect individu-
als from mental disorders but also facilitate psychological 
recovery  from  disaster  [38]. This  variation  could  be  due 
to differences in the study population, assessment meth-
ods and posttraumatic period.

Earthquake related variables and PTSD related information

This  study  showed  that  there  is  a  significant  association 
between  PTSD  prevalence  and  factors  such  as  getting 
buried  after  an  earthquake,  death  of  a  family  member, 
and  witnessing  others  who  have  been  buried,  injured 
ordied.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  other  previous 
studies  [39,  74].These  are  all  autonomous  factors  for 
developing PTSD. Similarly, survivors with family mem-
ber loss may undertake more negative traumaand endure 
greater economic and psychological pressure,which may 
contribute to a higher PTSD prevalence rate [75].

Another  factor  that  was  associated  with  the  PTSD 
prevalence  was  participant  house  and  property  dam-
age.  Those  who  had  medium  to  very  high  level  damage 
to  house  and  property  were  5  times  more  likely  to  have 
PTSD compared to those with no or very less damage. A 
study  in  Dhadhing  showed  participants  who  had  house 
completely damaged and loss of property had between 4 
and 9 times higher odds of having PTSD [5].

Our study is consistent with numerous previous stud-
ies  [5,  7,  8,  62,  76,  77].  It  is  a  common  association  that 
increases  the  prevalence  rate  of  PTSD  and  likely  was 
confounded  by  the  fact  that  none  of  the  respondents 
were living in their previous houses three years after the 
earthquake. Their current way of living and surrounding 
environment may have caused a constant reminder to the 
patient  of  the  earthquake.  The  temporary  accommoda-
tion of the respondents has likely made an impact on the 
prevalence of PTSD.

According to Galea and colleagues’ studies, loss of pri-
vate  property  (e.g.  house)  and  experiencing  economic 
loss  (e.g.  loss  of  job)  are  major  stressors  after  a  disaster 
[44].This is consistent with our study. In our study sam-
ple, over ninety percent of houses were damaged during 
the earthquake. With loss of houses and property, many 
survivors were faced with financial and social problems/
barriers three years later.

Similarly,  consistent  with  our  findings,  a  study  (Kun 
P.  et  al.  2009  and  2013)  of  PTSD  concluded  that  female 

gender,  being  married,  ethnicity,  death  of  family  mem-
bers, and damaged personal property are associated risk 
factors [53, 64]. Guo J. et al. and Zhou X. et al. revealed 
that risk factors for PTSD included advanced age, female 
gender,  buried  in  the  earthquake,  injured  in  the  earth-
quake, witnessing someone get injured in the earthquake, 
witnessing  someone  get  buried  in  the  earthquake,  and 
witnessing someone die in the earthquake. These findings 
are consistent with our study findings [10, 75].

Strength of the study

The  study  included  a  large  sample  of  communities 
most  affected  by  the  2015  earthquake  in  4  districts  of 
Nepal.  A  standardized  and  validated  PCL-C  scale  was 
used to assess PTSD symptoms. All interviews were con-
ducted  by  trained  researchers.  There  was,  therefore,  lit-
tle missing data.

Limitations of the study

Our  study  has  some  limitations.  Our  design  is  a  cross-
sectional study with data collected at a single time refer-
ence point. To better study the effects of time, additional 
time  points  would  be  helpful.  This  study  is  quantitative 
in  nature. The  findings  would  be  stronger  if  it  had  been 
triangulated  by  qualitative  (study)  interviews.  Similarly, 
we  also  could  not  assure  that  all  participants  properly 
disclosed  their  mental  illness.  Participants  were  asked 
if  they  were  suffering  from  mental  illness  and/or  if  they 
were under medication as exclusion criteria. It is possible 
that some participants who responded no had an under-
lying  mental  illness.  We  also  did  not  inquire  about  our 
respondents’ family income. Family history of psychiatric 
illness was also not asked.

Ideally,  the  questionnaire  should  be  completed  by  the 
respondents,  but  many  of  the  respondents  were  illiter-
ate. Researchers had to verbally ask questions and record 
their  responses.  This  may  have  introduced  bias  into  the 
study.  Although  the  self-administration  of  the  question-
naire would be more preferable, our data collector might 
have faced difficulties in explaining the PCL-C question-
naire during data collection due to its difficulty in com-
prehension.  Recall  bias  may  have  also  been  a  limitation. 
Although  widely  used  around  the  world,  PCL-C  is  a 
screening  measure  for  PTSD,  not  a  diagnostic  tool.  The 
current  study  participants  with  a  score  of  50  or  above 
greater were classified as having probable PTSD without 
a clinical interview.

Conclusions
Our  findings  conclude  those  three  years  after  the  2015 
earthquake,  adverse  mental  health  impact  still.  PTSD 
remains  a  common  mental  health  problem  among 
survivors.  Multivariate  logistic  regression  shows  that 

 Acharya Pandey et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:340

associated risk factors of survivors with persistent PTSD 
include gender, ethnicity, educational status, occupation, 
social  support  and  severity  to  loss  of  house  and  prop-
erty.  To  reduce  psychiatric  problems  such  as  PTSD  and 
to improve overall mental health and wellbeing in earth-
quake-affected  communities,  a  community-based  men-
tal  health  and  psychosocial  support  program  should  be 
implemented.  We  also  recommend  further  mix  method 
studies for triangulation between quantitative and quali-
tative information.
