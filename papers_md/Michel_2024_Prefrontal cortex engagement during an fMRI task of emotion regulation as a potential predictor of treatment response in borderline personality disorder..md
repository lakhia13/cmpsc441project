Abstract

Background:  Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental illness, with high rates 
of co-morbid depression and suicidality. Despite the importance of optimizing treatment in BPD, 
little is known about how neural processes relate to individual treatment response. This study 
examines how baseline regional brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation during a 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of emotion regulation is related to treatment 
response following a six-month randomized clinical trial of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) 
or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) treatment.

Methods:  Unmedicated females with BPD (N=37), with recent suicidal behavior or self-injury, 
underwent an fMRI task in which negative personal memories were presented and they were asked 
to distance (i.e., downregulate their emotional response) or immerse (i.e., experience emotions 
freely). Patients were then randomized to DBT (N=16) or SSRI (N=21) treatment, with baseline 
and post-treatment depression and BPD severity assessed.

Results:  BOLD activity in prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and insula was associated with 
distancing. Baseline BOLD during distancing in dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and orbital prefrontal 
cortex (dlPFC, vlPFC, OFC) differentially predicted depression response across treatment groups,

with higher activity predicting better response in the SSRI group, and lower activity predicting 
better response in the DBT group.

Limitations:  All female sample.

Discussion:  Findings indicate that greater prefrontal engagement during emotion regulation 
may predict more antidepressant benefit from SSRIs, whereas lower engagement may predict 
better response to DBT. These results suggest different mechanisms of action for SSRI and DBT 
treatment, and this may allow fMRI to guide individualized treatment selection.

Introduction

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental illness affecting over four million 
individuals in the United States alone (Lenzenweger et al., 2007). Depressive symptoms 
and suicidality are common in BPD (Rao and Broadbear, 2019). Over 60% of individuals 
with BPD attempt suicide, and 10% complete suicide (Brickman et al., 2014; Kullgren et 
al., 1986; Qin, 2011). BPD is also associated with one of the highest rates of healthcare 
utilization of any psychiatric disorder, highlighting the importance of targeted and effective 
treatment (Fertuck et al., 2007).

BPD is characterized by a pattern of instability in affect, impulse control, interpersonal 
relationships, and self-image. Individuals with BPD often experience depressed mood, 
intense anger, chronic emptiness, and engage in self-injurious behaviors, like suicide 
attempts and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors (NSSI) (Linehan and Kehrer, 1993). Over 
the past decade, neuroimaging studies have examined neural correlates underlying emotion 
dysregulation and negative affect in BPD. When processing negative stimuli, individuals 
with BPD have heightened activation of the amygdala, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate 
cortex and attenuated engagement of prefrontal regions including, dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), compared with healthy control subjects 
(HC) (Beblo et al., 2006; Donegan et al., 2003; Herpertz et al., 2001; Krause-Utz et al., 
2014a; Krause-Utz et al., 2014b; Ruocco et al., 2013; Schmahl et al., 2006; Schulze et 
al., 2016; van Zutphen et al., 2015). Aberrant limbic-prefrontal connectivity has also been 
implicated (Schulze et al., 2016). Thus, treatments targeting normalization of these brain 
regions should result in symptom improvement.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) has consistently been shown to be effective in treating 
mood-related symptoms in individuals with BPD (Cristea et al., 2017; DeCou et al., 2019; 
Salsman and Linehan, 2006; Stoffers-Winterling et al., 2022). DBT helps individuals with 
BPD develop skills related to mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and 
interpersonal effectiveness to manage their negative thoughts, emotions, and behaviors more 
effectively (Salsman and Linehan, 2006). Several studies have investigated changes in neural 
activation before and after treatment with DBT, and findings suggest that DBT can alter 
the neural underpinnings of BPD. Specifically, DBT was associated with downregulation 
of neuronal activity within limbic regions, including the insula and amygdala (Goodman 
et al., 2014; Schmitt et al., 2016; Schnell and Herpertz, 2007). It was also associated with 
increases in prefrontal recruitment (Ruocco et al., 2016) and prefrontal gray matter volume

(Mancke et al., 2018), and enhanced functional connectivity between limbic and prefrontal 
regions (Schmitt et al., 2016; Uscinska and Bellino, 2018).

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown efficacy in treating symptoms of 
affect instability, depression, impulsivity, and hostility which are often present in individuals 
with BPD (Bozzatello et al., 2017; Mercer et al., 2009; Ripoll, 2022; Vita et al., 2011). 
Additionally, because of the high rate of depression, suicide attempts and self-injury in BPD, 
SSRIs are recommended (Bozzatello et al., 2017). Despite the potential benefits, there have 
been a limited number of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of SSRIs in 
reducing symptoms specific to BPD, and there are no documented neuroimaging studies 
examining the effects of SSRI treatment in BPD (Uscinska and Bellino, 2018). Although 
there have been no BPD specific neuroimaging studies examining SSRI effects to date, in 
depressed samples, antidepressant treatment is associated with a reduction in hyperactivity 
of limbic regions (i.e. amygdala, insula) when processing negative stimuli (Ma, 2015). Since 
hyperactivity of these regions is characteristic of BPD, SSRIs may target these underlying 
neural abnormalities, resulting in affective symptom improvement for those with BPD.

Though some progress has been made in understanding the neural processes targeted 
by treatment, little work has been done to identify predictors of differential treatment 
response. Identification of neurobiological markers indicating who will respond best to 
which treatment could lead to more personalized treatment and improve treatment response 
rate. The current study examined the neural correlates of negative emotion processing and 
regulation at baseline in unmedicated individuals with BPD with recent suicidal behavior 
or self-injury and investigated how these brain regions relate to treatment outcomes after 
participants are randomized into either 6-months of DBT or SSRI treatment. To capture 
the participants’ ability to regulate their affect when presented with something emotionally 
triggering, we employed an fMRI task involving negative personal memories. During the 
fMRI task, participants were asked to immerse themselves in a negative memory, allowing 
themselves to freely feel any emotions or distance themselves from the negative memory, 
downregulating their emotional response. We predicted that the reappraisal condition would 
be associated with greater recruitment of prefrontal brain regions. Additionally, because 
prefrontal engagement is associated with effective emotional reappraisal, we predicted that 
individuals with greater prefrontal recruitment during distancing at baseline would show 
greater improvement in depressive symptoms as well as overall BPD symptom severity 
following treatment. Exploratory analyses will examine whether there is an interaction of 
treatment type and prefrontal engagement in predicting change in depressive symptoms and 
BPD symptom severity.

Methods

Sample

Participants (N=37) were previously recruited by the Molecular Imaging and 
Neuropathology Division (MIND) at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI)/
Columbia Psychiatry to participate in a larger treatment study for BPD. All participants 
were required to meet DSM-IV criteria for BPD, as determined by the Structured Clinical 
Interview (SCID) for DSM-IV, parts I and II (First, 2014). Participants also had at least

one suicide attempt, or suicide-related behavior, or episode of NSSI in the past 6 months, 
and a second suicide attempt, suicide-related behavior, or NSSI within the past two years. 
Suicide related behaviors were defined as: a.) aborted attempt as a self-destructive behavior 
with intent to die but stopped by the individual prior to the point where injury could begin; 
b.) interrupted attempt as a self-destructive behavior with intent to die but the behavior is 
interrupted by another person; c.) micro-overdose as taking more medication than prescribed 
or a larger dose than recommended in OTC medication in which the intent is not to die, but 
to sleep or to “not think”; d.) serious suicide ideation resulting in psychiatric hospitalization 
or ED or urgent care visit. Participants were English speaking, female, between 18-65 years 
of age, and clinically stable enough to be treated as an outpatient. Individuals were excluded 
from participation if they were unable to provide consent, had past or present bipolar 
I disorder, psychotic disorder, schizophrenic disorder, a current substance use disorder, 
uncontrolled medical illness, pregnant, breastfeeding, claustrophobic or had any condition 
contraindicated for neuroimaging. Participants were also excluded if they had previous failed 
treatment trials of DBT or fluoxetine. Participants were only included if they completed 
baseline fMRI and post-treatment behavioral measures. Only 37 fMRI participants met 
this criterion. A CONSORT diagram shows fMRI participant flow in the context of the 
larger treatment study (Figure 1). A comparison of clinical and demographic characteristics 
between individuals who dropped out of the study and treatment group completers can be 
found in the supplemental materials (Table S2).

Overview of Procedures for Treatment Portion of Study

Participants were screened and randomized to either six months of DBT (N=16) or SSRI 
(N=21) treatment. Participants were evaluated on a bimonthly basis during the active phase 
of treatment. Participants were assigned by stratified random sampling, stratified by type 
of self-injury they reported in the past 6 months (NSSI vs. suicide attempt). Prior to start 
of treatment, those on medications began a medication taper and a 2-week washout period. 
Once deemed medication free for at least 2 weeks, those randomized to DBT started weekly 
individual DBT psychotherapy sessions and weekly skills group. For those randomized 
to the SSRI group, fluoxetine was started at 20 mg once daily (QD), increased up to a 
maximum dosage of 40 mg QD in four weeks. Those in the SSRI condition also received 
supportive clinical management, consisting of 30-minute sessions with the study psychiatrist 
at a minimum frequency of every two weeks; weekly if their condition was worsening. 
Supportive clinical management included psychoeducation about BPD, suicide and NSSI, 
assessment of side effects, suicide risk and mental status, review of procedures to follow 
during spikes in suicidal risk, and friendly support. Serum SSRI levels were drawn monthly 
to assess and monitor medication adherence.

All DBT therapists were Ph.D. level clinical psychologists intensively trained by the 
Behavioral Technology Transfer Group. They attended weekly DBT consultation team to 
ensure treatment precision and protect against drift. All treatment sessions were videotaped, 
and some used for supervision and to promote adherence. DBT adherence ratings were 
performed by an individual who received adherence rating training by the Linehan group. 
All therapists achieved DBT adherence.

Clinical Measures

Page 5

Participants completed a battery of assessments administered by trained Master’s level 
psychologists at baseline and at the end of the 6 months of treatment. Clinical and 
demographic characteristics for the DBT and SSRI group at baseline and follow-up, as 
well as differences between the two groups at baseline are reported (Table 1). Axis I and 
II psychopathology was diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV-TR 
and the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (First and Gibbon, 
2004).

The primary outcome was depression severity and it was assessed using the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck and Steer, 1984). The BDI is a 21-item self-report 
measure using a 4-point scale from 0-3, with higher scores indicating increased depression 
severity. Internal consistency of BDI has been reported to be high (Cronbach’s alpha=0.88) 
(Beck and Steer, 1984). BPD symptom severity was assessed using the Zanarini Rating 
Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) (Zanarini, 2003). The ZAN-BPD is 
a clinician administered assessment based on the DSM-IV criteria for BPD and it uses a 
five-point anchored rating scale of 0 to 4 to assess severity of the nine DSM-IV criteria 
for BPD. Internal consistency of the ZAN-BPD is reported to be high (Cronbach’s α=0.85)
(Zanarini, 2003).

Memory Collection

In a pre-scanning testing session, a clinician asked participants to recall 8 upsetting 
memories from the last 6 months of their lives that made them feel sad, angry, or upset. 
If participants had difficulty, they were told that upsetting situations with family, friends and 
work are often sources of distress for people and if necessary, were asked to recall memories 
involving feeling ashamed, humiliated, rejected, misunderstood or hopeless. Participants 
rated each memory on a scale of 1-10 in terms of how initially distressing it was and 
its current intensity and vividness (all task memories were rated as a 7 or higher). The 
clinician and participant created brief phrases to be used as memory cues for the fMRI task. 
Participants provided 4 neutral memories for training purposes.

Memory Task Training

On ‘immerse’ trials, participants were told to see the situation in the first person and to 
feel any emotions that may arise. On ‘distance’ trials, participants were told to watch their 
memory unfold as if from a distance and to adopt the perspective of a reporter who is 
focused on the facts of their memory rather than its emotional details. Participants practiced 
the strategies with neutral memories, so they did not habituate to upsetting memories. 
Participants practiced distancing and immersing two memories aloud with an experimenter 
before practicing silently with two additional memories. All participants successfully 
described the strategy to the experimenter and verbalized how to distance themselves.

fMRI Task

Participants completed four fMRI task runs, each comprised of four trials (Figure 2). Each 
trial began with a memory cue (10 seconds) that prompted participants to recall the memory 
indicated. After a brief delay, the memory cue was presented with an instructional cue

Analysis

(‘immerse’ or ‘distance’) for 20 seconds, during which time participants either immersed or 
distanced themselves from their memory. After each trial, participants completed an active 
baseline task involving making button presses to indicate the direction of an arrow for 20 
seconds (Stark and Squire, 2001). Participants were prompted to recall two memories twice 
per run, once with the immerse instruction and once with the distance instruction. Half 
of memories were presented with the immerse instruction first and half were presented 
with the distance instruction first. Stimuli were displayed using an LCD projector and a 
back-projection screen. Participants responded using a five-finger-button-response (Avotec 
Inc. and Resonance Technologies).

fMRI Acquisition—Whole-brain data were acquired on a GE 1.5 Tesla scanner (General 
Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). Functional data were acquired with a T2*-sensitive 
EPI sequence (28 4mm contiguous axial slices, TR=2000ms, TE=34ms, flip angle=84°, 
FOV=22.4 cm). Anatomical images were acquired with a T1-weighted SPGR scan (124 1.5 
mm slices, TR=19 ms, TE=5 ms, FOV=22 cm). All image processing and analyses were 
completed using FSL (Woolrich et al., 2009).

Preprocessing—The first four volumes of each functional scan were removed to avoid 
saturation effects. Preprocessing included slice time correction, motion correction, 120-
second high-pass filter, bias field correction, and skull stripping. Normalized functional 
images were resliced to 3×3×3 mm voxels and smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6mm. 
Functional images were registered to structural images with 6-degrees of freedom and 
then structural images were warped to the standard MNI space using a 12-degree affine 
registration implemented in FLIRT (Jenkinson et al., 2002). A nonlinear warp was also 
applied in FNIRT (Andersson et al., 2007). Visual checks were used to confirm there were 
no major artifacts or dropout, that field of view was appropriate and consistent, and to check 
for motion issues during the scan. All participants in the sample passed quality checks. 
Visual inspection also confirmed there were no registration failures during pre-processing in 
the sample.

Individual and Group Level fMRI Analyses—First-level, second-level, and group 
analyses of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal were completed in FEAT 
within FSL (Woolrich et al., 2009). First level analyses included modeling memory recall, 
immerse condition, distance condition, and active baseline (arrows task) as boxcar regressors 
convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Motion parameters and high-
pass temporal filter parameters were included as nuisance regressors. Within-subject fixed 
effects models combined data across runs. Group level analyses used mixed-effects analysis 
to identify clusters (voxel p< 0.001; cluster p< 0.05). The distance > immerse condition was 
the focus of this study. To confirm treatment randomization was successful and determine 
if there were any baseline treatment group differences during our condition of interest 
(distance > immerse), we conducted a mixed effects model using a between-group contrast 
(DBT>SSRI and SSRI>DBT).

fMRI Analyses: Treatment Type and Clinical Measures—Follow-up analyses 
were conducted in FSL. We examined the relationship between activation during the 
distance>immerse contrast and depression severity at post-treatment while controlling 
for baseline depression scores. Specifically, we conducted a mixed effects analysis with 
baseline BDI and post-treatment BDI as factors. The contrast of interest was post-treatment 
BDI. We also examined whether there was a relationship between activation during the 
distance>immerse contrast and the interaction of treatment type (DBT, SSRI) and post-
treatment BDI. To do this we conducted a mixed effects analysis with the following factors: 
baseline BDI, post-treatment BDI, treatment type, and the interaction of treatment type and 
post-treatment BDI. The contrast of interest in this model was the interaction of treatment 
type and post-treatment BDI.

We completed the same analyses using the ZAN-BPD. To examine the relationship between 
activation during distance>immerse and post-treatment ZAN-BPD, we conducted a mixed 
effects analysis with baseline ZAN-BPD and post-treatment ZAN-BPD as factors. The 
contrast of interest was post-treatment ZAN-BPD. Additionally, to explore the relationship 
between activation during distance>immerse and the interaction of treatment type (DBT, 
SSRI) and post-treatment ZAN-BPD, we conducted a mixed effects analysis with the 
following factors: baseline ZAN-BPD, post-treatment ZAN-BPD, treatment type, and the 
interaction of treatment type and post-treatment ZAN-BPD. The contrast of interest in this 
model was the interaction of treatment type and post-treatment ZAN-BPD.

As an exploratory follow-up, we conducted a modified intent-to-treat analysis in which we 
used the 4-month BDI assessment scores for individuals who either discontinued before the 
6-month mark or did not have a 6-month BDI. To examine how neural activation during 
distance>immerse related to the interaction of treatment type and depression severity at 
discontinuation or post-treatment, controlling for baseline depression scores, we conducted 
a mixed effects analysis with the following factors: baseline BDI, discontinuation/post-
treatment BDI, treatment type, and the interaction of treatment type and discontinuation/
post-treatment BDI. The contrast of interest for this model was the interaction of treatment 
type and discontinuation/post-treatment BDI.

Regional localizations were identified using the Harvard-Oxford Cortical and Subcortical 
atlases applied to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)152 standard brain template 
(Collins et al., 1995; Mazziotta et al., 2001). Brain regions are reported and include the 
voxel coordinates (X, Y, Z) of the region’s center of gravity (COG). The COG is calculated 
using a weighted average of the coordinates by the intensities within each brain region.

Results

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Sample

Clinical and demographic characteristics for the DBT and SSRI groups are reported in 
Table 1. At baseline, the two treatment groups did not differ on measures of age, education, 
attempt history, diagnosis, race, or depression severity (Table 1). Both DBT and SSRI 
treatments reduced depression severity from baseline to post-treatment (Table 1).

BOLD Activation Associated with Cognitive Reappraisal

In the distance> immerse contrast, distancing was associated with greater activation in 
orbital prefrontal cortex, operculum, anterior cingulate (ACC), dorsal striatum, insula, and 
paracingulate compared with the immerse condition (Figure 3). There were no baseline 
neural differences between the two treatment groups for the distance>immerse condition. In 
the immerse>distance contrast, there was greater activation in lateral occipital cortex and 
angular gyrus (Table S1).

BOLD Activation during Distancing and Clinical Outcomes

When analyzing the entire sample (N=37), irrespective of treatment group, brain activity 
during the distance > immerse contrast was not related to post-treatment depression severity 
scores on the BDI.

There was a significant interaction of treatment type and post-treatment BDI scores with 
a cluster spanning the right dlPFC, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and orbital 
frontal cortex (OFC) (Table 3; Figure 4a,4b). For the SSRI group, greater activation in this 
cluster was associated lower BDI scores post-treatment, indicating more improvement. The 
opposite was seen in the DBT group, with less prefrontal activation at baseline associated 
with lower BDI scores post-treatment, indicating greater reduction in depression symptoms 
(Figure 4b). In our exploratory modified intent to treat analysis, there was similarly a 
significant interaction of treatment type and BDI scores with a cluster spanning the right 
vlPFC and OFC (Table S3). For the SSRI group, greater activation in vlPFC/OFC was 
associated lower BDI scores at 4 or 6 months. For the DBT group, less vlPFC/OFC 
activation was associated lower depression scores at 4 months or later (Table S3, Figure 
S1).

When analyzing the entire sample, irrespective of treatment group, brain activity during the 
distance > immerse contrast was not related to post-treatment BPD severity scores on the 
ZAN-BPD. There was no interaction of treatment type and post-treatment ZAN-BPD scores.

Discussion

This is the first study to examine how neural activity during emotion regulation 
relates to differential treatment outcomes in females with BPD. Overall, reappraisal was 
associated with activation of prefrontal cortex, ACC, insula, thalamus, dorsal striatum, 
and parahippocampal gyri. Baseline dlPFC, vlPFC and OFC activation during emotion 
regulation trials differentially predicted treatment response of depressive symptoms, with 
higher activation predicting enhanced SSRI response and lower activation predicting 
enhanced response to DBT. These findings suggest that dLPFC, vlPFC and OFC activation 
may help delineate what treatment is likely to work optimally on depressive symptoms for a 
given individual.

dlPFC, vlPFC and OFC engagement during emotion regulation may be a neurobiological 
predictor of antidepressant treatment response. Individuals with greater dlPFC, vlPFC and 
OFC engagement during emotion regulation may have a better antidepressant response to 
SSRIs, while those with less engagement may benefit more from DBT. One explanation

may be that elements of DBT treatment, like direct skills training in emotion regulation 
and distress tolerance, may increase dlPFC, vlPFC and OFC, resulting in improvement 
in mood following treatment. Prior data show that following DBT treatment, individuals 
with BPD had increased dlPFC engagement during an fMRI impulse control task (Ruocco 
et al., 2016), increased gray matter volume in prefrontal regions (Mancke et al., 2018), 
and increased prefrontal-limbic connectivity (Schmitt et al., 2016; Uscinska and Bellino, 
2018). These neural changes are suggested to correspond with symptom improvement 
(Mancke et al., 2018; Ruocco et al., 2016; Schmitt et al., 2016; Uscinska and Bellino, 
2018). Additionally, one study found that individuals who saw the greatest gains from 
DBT treatment, as assessed by reduction self-harm, were those with low dlPFC activity 
at baseline (Ruocco et al., 2016). If a core mechanism of DBT is increasing prefrontal 
engagement or connectivity during emotional processing, then individuals with low baseline 
activity in dlPFC, vlPFC and OFC may see the greatest mood benefits from DBT. In 
contrast, one reason individuals with high baseline dlPFC/vlPFC/OFC engagement may 
have benefited more from SSRIs is that antidepressants may improve mood through different 
brain targets (i.e., limbic regions). While there are no prior neuroimaging studies examining 
SSRI effects in BPD, metanalyses of antidepressant effects in depressed patients show that 
SSRI treatment was associated with decreased activity in regions of amygdala and insula 
when processing aversive stimuli (Ma, 2015). Since amygdala and insula hyperactivity is 
characteristic of BPD (Schulze et al., 2016), it is possible that reducing this hyperactivity 
is a key mechanism of antidepressant action of SSRI treatment (Ma, 2015). Thus, if SSRIs 
primarily improve mood in BPD by reducing limbic hyperactivity, then individuals with 
high dlPFC/vlPFC/OFC engagement at baseline may be predisposed to benefit more from 
SSRI treatment and have less improvement with DBT. Further research is needed to replicate 
these findings and to determine their basis.

This finding has a number of clinical implications for treating depressive symptoms in 
females with BPD. Depressive symptomology is common in BPD and may increase the risk 
for suicidal behavior. Because of the high-risk nature of BPD, it is critical to identify factors 
that predict which treatment is most effective in improving mood symptoms. DBT involves a 
high financial cost and a substantial time investment from the patient (Murphy et al., 2020). 
DBT also has a high dropout rate, with more than one-fourth of patients ending treatment 
prematurely (Dixon and Linardon, 2020). Additionally, antidepressant medication is less 
effective in reducing depressive symptoms when MDD and BPD are co-occurring (Ceresa et 
al., 2021). Thus, identifying a neurobiological marker that can predict which patients would 
see more depressive symptom improvement from SSRIs vs. DBT would reduce patient 
burden, cost, and potentially increase treatment adherence and reduce dropout rates.

Baseline neural activity did not predict change in overall BPD symptom severity. BPD is 
a complex disorder with heterogeneous symptoms including impulsivity, anger, emotion 
dysregulation, identity disturbances, depressed mood, unstable interpersonal relationships, 
and self-injurious behaviors. The ZAN-BPD assesses BPD severity with one question for 
each of the nine DSM-IV criteria for BPD. Because of the heterogeneous nature of BPD 
symptoms, it is possible that neural activity is anchored to specific characteristics of the 
disorder (e.g., depressive symptoms, impulsivity, anger), and this may not be captured in

the ZAN-BPD. Thus, future work should determine whether findings differ when using 
assessments specific to these different characteristics (e.g., impulsivity, aggression, etc.).

When examining the entire sample at baseline, females with BPD showed recruitment of 
several regions associated with adaptive emotion regulation. Specifically, reappraisal was 
associated with greater activation in regions of the prefrontal cortex, including frontal 
operculum and frontal poles, and the anterior cingulate. These regions are all implicated 
in cognitive control and reappraisal of negative emotional states (Ochsner and Gross, 2007; 
Ochsner et al., 2012), and are an integral part of effective emotional control. (Blumenfeld, 
2002; Blumenfeld, 2010; Krause-Utz et al., 2014b; Ochsner and Gross, 2007; Ochsner 
et al., 2012). Meta-analyses indicate that individuals with BPD have less engagement of 
prefrontal regions compared with healthy controls when processing aversive stimuli, and 
this attenuated activation is associated with poor emotion regulation in BPD (Ruocco et 
al., 2013; Schulze et al., 2016). In addition to prefrontal structures, engagement of the 
thalamus, dorsal striatum (putamen), and insula were associated with distancing. The insula 
and paracingulate are involved in affective memory, attention, and processing of emotional 
stimuli, while the dorsal striatum is involved in reward processing (Blumenfeld, 2010; 
Morawetz et al., 2017; Ochsner et al., 2012; Song et al., 2017). Previous studies find that 
individuals with BPD have greater activation in insula and paracingulate during emotional 
regulation strategies than healthy controls, and this activation was associated with poorer 
emotion regulation abilities (Krause-Utz et al., 2014b; Schulze et al., 2016; van Zutphen 
et al., 2015). Hyperactivation of brain regions involved in reward processing (i.e., striatum, 
putamen, and thalamus) when processing negative stimuli has been documented in BPD 
compared with controls (Enzi et al., 2013; Krause-Utz et al., 2014b). While many regions 
in the greater limbic circuitry are involved in emotion regulation, the literature suggests that 
individuals with BPD generally have greater activation of these regions, or less deactivation 
of the regions, when attempting to downregulate their emotional response than healthy 
controls (Krause-Utz et al., 2014b; Schulze et al., 2016).

While the sample size is comparable to other clinical studies (Schulze et al., 2016), one 
limitation of this study is the sample size within each treatment group. fMRI studies of 
clinical samples are often smaller than non-imaging studies due to many factors including 
more subject burden. Additionally, since this study required participants to remain in 
treatment for 6-months, this further added to the challenge of retaining a large sample. 
While we did have individuals who dropped out over the course of the study, our dropout 
rates were comparable to other RCTs (Dixon and Linardon, 2020). Another limitation is 
that the group that discontinued treatment had a higher rate of Hispanic participants than 
the SSRI treatment completer group. Future follow-up studies should strive to include more 
individuals within each treatment group and examine ethnic minority-specific barriers to 
retention.

Another limitation of this study is that the fMRI portion was completed with an all-female 
sample. Borderline personality disorder is three times more common in females compared 
with males (Lenzenweger et al., 2007), and prior research has been predominately with

female samples (Herpertz et al., 2018; Schulze et al., 2016). While the research to date 
does not report gender differences in prognosis and in treatment response (Schulze et al., 
2016), future studies should include males to determine whether findings are generalizable 
to men with BPD or to populations with different clinical and demographic characteristics. 
Additionally, due to the high-risk nature of the sample, this treatment study did not include 
a non-treatment control group, and some pre-post clinical gains may be due to regression 
to the mean. Another limitation of the study is that there is no healthy comparison group. 
In order to understand BPD specific brain abnormalities, it is important to include clinical 
comparison samples in future studies. Future work should also examine whether there 
are neurobiological predictors of treatment response related to other BPD symptoms i.e., 
impulsivity or suicidal behavior.

Summary

dlPFC, vlPFC and OFC activation during emotion regulation pre-treatment may 
differentially predict antidepressant treatment response in females with BPD. This study 
is the first to suggest a biomarker for choosing SSRI versus DBT antidepressant treatment 
in BPD. Future work should seek to replicate this potential neurobiological predictor of 
treatment response, with the goal of more personalized care for this high-risk population.

Figure 2. Negative Autobiographical Memories Task
Note: s=seconds. Each trial begins with a memory cue for 10s that prompted participants 
to recall the memory. After an ISI ~2s, the memory cue is presented with an instructional 
cue (‘immerse’ or ‘distance’) for 20s, during which time participants either immersed or 
distanced themselves from their memory. Each presentation is followed by an arrows task 
where participants indicate the direction of the arrow. There are eight memories and four 
runs total. During each run, participants are presented with two memories twice, once with 
the immerse instruction and once with the distance instruction.
