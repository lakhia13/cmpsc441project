Child abuse is an important source of mental and physical adverse consequences 
for victims, their family, and their community. The impact of violence during 
childhood on the development of the victim is a very sensitive theme. Other than 
internalizing symptoms, it is interesting to analyze the possibility that a victim 
may assume the role of persecutor. With this aim, we evaluate Literature and 
examine the interplay among different types of child abuse (emotional neglect, 
emotional  abuse,  physical  neglect,  physical  abuse  and  sexual  abuse)  and  the 
development  of  psychopathy.  We  consider  the  role  of  post-traumatic  stress 
disorder and that of personal environment as potential mediators between abuse 
and psychopathy. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis on possible differences due 
to the victim's gender is performed. Finally, analysis focused on genetic variants, 
such as the polymorphism of 5HTT and MAO-A, or a biological alteration, like 
the difference in daily cortisol levels that could be related to the development of 
psychopathy after a trauma.

Core Tip: Childhood trauma and psychopathy are strictly related; emotional abuse, 
emotional neglect and physical abuse show stronger association with the development 
of psychopathy. Even if sexual abuse is more frequent in females, most researches did 
not  find  a  significant  correlation  between  psychopathy  and  sexual  abuse  in  both 
genders. Furthermore, trauma is the hallmark of secondary psychopathy causing, in a 
fragile mind, the uprising of mental illness.

INTRODUCTION

Child abuse is a strong predictor of short and long term physical and mental illness. 
Five types of maltreatment are commonly recognized: Sexual, physical and emotional 
abuses (EAs) and physical and emotional neglect. Child sexual abuse is a serious 
concern with worldwide prevalence rates between 8%-31% for girls and 3%-17% for 
boys[1]. Every year, about 4%-16% of children are physically abused and one in ten is 
neglected or psychologically abused. During childhood, between 5% and 10% of girls 
and up to 5% of boys are exposed to penetrative sexual abuse, and up to three times 
higher numbers of children are exposed to any kind of sexual abuse[2].

Many research findings support the hypothesis that exposure to early life stress in 
the form of child abuse and/or neglect is associated with a huge increased vulner-
ability  to  major  psychiatric  and  other  medical  disorders[3]. Research  shows  that 
children  who  have  been  physically  or  sexually  abused  have  a  greater  risk  of 
depression, suicidality, post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as antisocial personality 
disorder, psychopathic traits or psychopathy. Psychopathy is characterized by distinct 
interpersonal and affective traits (e.g., manipulativeness, callousness), as well as a 
disinhibited, reckless lifestyle (e.g., impulsivity, irresponsibility)[4].

The aim of the present narrative review is to evaluate the interplay between child 
abuse  and  psychopathy  with  special  attention  to  gender  differences  and  possible 
biological causes.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PSYCHOPATHY

An  original  theory  differentiates  the  psychopathy  in  two  subcategories:  Primary 
psychopathy that have innate biological origins and could be characterized by low 
levels  of  anxiety  and  secondary  psychopathy  developed  in  response  to  adverse 
environmental experiences (Table 1). Primary psychopaths are incapable of emotions 
such  as  empathy  and  guilt,  and  so  appear  callous,  cold,  and  lacking  anxiety.  In 
contrast,  secondary  psychopaths  have  a  relatively  normal  capacity  for  emotional 
experience. Due to environmental stressors and trauma, however, they experience an 
excess  of  negative  emotions  and  so  exhibit  high  levels  of  anxiety  and  emotional 
distress, hostility, aggression, and impulsive behavior. Those differences would mirror 
the  characteristics  of  the  Psychopathy  Checklist-Revised  -  PCL-R  Factor  1  (F1; 
interpersonal  and  affective  traits)  and  Factor  2  (F2;  impulsive,  antisocial,  and 
chronically unstable lifestyle).

Dargis et al[5] studied the correlation between primary and secondary psychopathy 
(PCL:R)  and  trauma  (Childhood  Trauma  Questionnaire-CTQ)  in  a  sample  of  110 
psychopaths (PCL-R > 30) vs 112 inmates (PCL-R < 30). The psychopaths were split in 
2 subgroups: Low negative affect (LN, n = 72) and high negative affect (HN, n = 38).

HN: High negative affect; LN: Low negative affect; LP: Low psychopathy levels; MP: Medium psychopathy level; HP: High psychopathy level; PA: 
Physical abuse; EN: Emotional neglect.

The  HN  subgroup  scored  significantly  higher  at  the  CTQ  total  score  than  the  LN 
subgroup. In particular, the HN subgroup scored significantly higher in EA, PA, EN; 
while they did not differ for PN and SA. HN psychopaths scored higher than the other 
inmates at the CTQ total score and in all types of abuse except for SA. LN psychopaths 
significantly  suffered  more  PA  and  PN  than  other  inmates.  The  hallmark  of  the 
difference between secondary psychopathy (HN) and primary psychopathy (LN) was 
emotional  neglect  and  EA  that  were  significantly  higher  in  HN  compared  to  LN 
offenders suggesting that emotional maltreatment has specific associations with that 
subtype of psychopathy.

Schimmenti et al[6] evaluated the link between child abuse (CA) (measured with the 
Traumatic Experiences Checklist-TEC) and psychopathy (measured with Psychopathy 
Checklist-Revised - PCL-R) in 78 male prisoners. The EA was significantly related to 
the  PCL-R  total  score,  factor  1  (interpersonal/affective  facets)  and  factor  2 
(lifestyle/antisocial facets); while Physical abuse (PA) was linked only to factor 2. 
Furthermore PCL-R total scores were higher when EA occurred in childhood. As a 
consequence, the authors hypothesized a key role of EA in childhood; in fact, it was 
the best predictor of psychopathy scores and could distort the affective development 
of  children,  as  implied  in  the  construct  of  malignant  narcissism,  which  has  been 
theoretically proposed as a crucial dimension for understanding the inflated self-
representation and lack of empathy among criminals.

Similarly, Borja et al[7] evaluated the relationship between several early traumatic 
events and psychopathy analyzing 194 male inmates with the PCL-R and the Early 
Trauma  Inventory  (ETI).  They  divided  inmates  in  3  subgroups:  Those  with  low 
psychopathic  levels  (LP,  n  =  96,  scoring  0-19  point  at  the  PCL-R);  inmates  with 
medium psychopathy level (MP, n = 59, scoring from 20 to 29) and inmates with a high 
level of psychopathy (HP, n = 44, scores > 30). EA and SA were significantly higher in 
HP compared to LP group. Moreover PA was higher in MP vs LP and HP vs LP. After 
a  regression  analysis  they  found  that  early-life  traumatic  events  and  EA  strongly 
influenced the PCL-R total score. Additionally HP and MP were exposed to more 
hostile environment than LP. Ometto and colleagues[8] underlined the relationship 
between  abuse,  detected  through  the  CTQ,  and  the  development  of  psychopathy 
(Psychopathy Checklist:Youth Version; PCL:YV) in 107 teenagers. The PCL:YV total 
score was positively correlated to the abuse and inversely correlated to the frequency 
of  general  social  skill  (measured  with  The  Multidimensional  Personality 
Questionnaire-Brief Form [MPQ-BF]). In the same study, Emotional neglect (EN) was 
positively related to the PCL:YV total factor and interpersonal, affective and lifestyle 
factors. PA was positively correlated to the PCL:YV total factor and affective, lifestyle 
and antisocial factors of the PCL:YV. Emotional and sexual abuse were not related to 
psychopathy. At a Multiple linear regression for the association of distinct types of 
maltreatment (CTQ) and social skills (Social Skills Inventory for Adolescents; SSIA) 
with psychopathic features (PCL: YV), EN was the only abuse related to psychopathy,

especially with the interpersonal Factor.

Dargis et al[9] examined psychopathy (PCL:R) and trauma (CTQ) in 183 inmates and 
discovered a significant correlation between the CTQ total score and Psychopathy, in 
particular  PA,  PN,  EN  and  EA  were  significantly  related  to  the  PCL:R  but  no 
significant relation with SA was found. Factor 2 (lifestyle and antisocial features load) 
was related to the CTQ total score while EA, EN, PA and Factor 4 (antisocial features) 
were related to PA and CTQ total score; no link between factor 1 and trauma was 
detected. Dargis and colleagues evaluated Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD), 
trauma and Conduct Disorder (CD): PA was the only form of trauma related to ASPD 
while CD was related exclusively to SA. With the same aim, Kolla et al[10] evaluated 
the link among ASPD, psychopathy (PCL-R) and trauma in 45 subjects divided in 3 
subgroups: 10 inmates with ASPD and psychopathy (PCL-R > 25), 15 ASPD without 
psychopathy (PCL-R < 25) and 15 non offenders. The first group reported greater 
physical  abuse  during  childhood  but  no  more  sexual  or  EAs  than  those  without 
psychopathy.

THE IMPACT OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

Another important variable that deserves consideration is the role of PTSD in the 
interplay between trauma and psychopathy; the work of Gobin et al[11] analyzed this 
variable in 88 inmates (51 females and 37 males) evaluating ASPD (Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM Axis II Personality Disorders; SCID-II), trauma (CTQ), psychopathy 
(Psychopathic personality inventory; PPI) and PTSD (PTSD checklist civilian version). 
Physical and crime-related trauma were associated with ASPD, while sexual abuse 
was not. Victims of PA were 5.04 times more likely to be diagnosed with ASPD than 
those without history of PA. Likewise, inmates with history of crime related trauma 
were  2.92  more  likely  to  be  diagnosed  with  ASPD  than  those  without.  PA  was 
confirmed as the only type of trauma related to psychopathy, whereas the severity of 
PTSD  symptoms  was  not  related  to  the  PPI  or  ASPD.  The  role  of  PTSD  was  also 
examined by Woodfield et al[12] They underlined a relation between psychopathy 
(Self-report psychopathy scale-short Form; SRP-SF), trauma (The life events checklist; 
LEC-5) and PTSD (The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-checklist Version 5). The total 
LEC-5 score was significantly related to both primary and secondary factors, but the 
secondary  had  a  stronger  correlation  with  trauma.  More  importantly,  only  the 
secondary facet of psychopathy had a correlation with PTSD, showing a key role in 
moderating the effect of trauma on the development of PTSD. Specifically, trauma 
exposure was positively associated with increased PTSD symptoms in individuals 
with  low  levels  of  secondary  psychopathy,  and  negatively  associated  with  PTSD 
symptoms  with  those  with  high  levels  of  secondary  psychopathy.  These  findings 
contribute to the understanding of the nature of the relationships between PTSD, 
psychopathic  facets,  and  trauma  exposure,  as  the  association  between  trauma 
exposure and PTSD is explained by secondary but not primary psychopathic traits.

Craparo et al[13] examined the role of age in mediating the effect of trauma on the 
development of psychopathy. They measured traumatic experiences (TEC) and traits 
of psychopathy (PCL-R) in 22 male subjects and suggested that an early exposure to 
relational trauma in childhood can play a relevant role in the development of more 
severe  psychopathic  traits.  Indeed,  subjects  with  higher  PCL-R  score  experienced 
relational traumatic events earlier in life compared to the rest of participants. There 
was also a significant negative association between age at first relational trauma and 
psychopathy scores.

THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY VIOLENCE

Another variable that needs to be taken in consideration is the role of violence in the 
community in the relationship between trauma and psychopathy.

Schraft  et  al[14]  highlighted  the  effect  of  community  violence  (Community 
Experience Questionnaire; CEQ) on trauma (CTQ) and psychopathy (PCL:YV) in their 
work on 170 detained adolescents (147 males, 23 females). The CTQ total score was 
positively correlated to the PCL:YV total score and scores of the PCL:YV behavioral 
and antisocial factors. The CEQ total score positively correlated to the PCL:YV total 
scores, as well as to scores of interpersonal, behavioral, and antisocial factors. EA, PN 
and EN were associated with higher levels of psychopathic traits. Higher levels of 
traumatic exposure within home and community were associated with higher levels of

psychopathic  characteristics.  Higher  CEQ  scores  were  related  to  higher  scores  in 
behavioral and antisocial facets of psychopathy.

PSYCHOPATHY, TRAUMA AND DISSOCIATION

Poythress  et  al[15]  evaluated  the  role  of  Dissociative  experiences  (Dissociative 
experiences scale; DES) in the link between trauma (Child abuse and Trauma Scale; 
CATS) and psychopathy in 615 male inmates. Psychopathy, abuse, and dissociation 
scales were weakly but significantly associated one with another. Tests of correlation 
revealed that the lifestyle features of psychopathy were significantly more linked to 
abuse  total  scores  than  affective  or  interpersonal  features.  Furthermore,  lifestyle 
feature of psychopathy was significantly more correlated to the DES total score than 
interpersonal features, but not to affective ones. Abuse was not related to interpersonal 
and affective features of psychopathy. In contrast, abuse exerted a direct effect on 
impulsive  and  irresponsible  lifestyle,  and  that  relationship  was  not  mediated  by 
dissociative experiences. Their research demonstrated that child abuse is positively 
linked,  even  if  weakly,  to  psychopathy  and  moderately  to  the  impulsive  and 
irresponsible lifestyle of psychopaths without a significant mediation of dissociative 
symptoms.

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATES 

Different studies analyzed the role of biological alterations that may link trauma and 
psychopathy  (Table 2).  Cima  and  colleagues[16]  evaluated  variations  of  salivary 
cortisol in 47 (24 psychopath and 21 non psychopath) inmates tested with the PPI scale 
for  psychopathy,  the  CTQ  for  childhood  trauma,  compared  to  the  group  of  non-
psychopaths -control group (27 males). The salivary cortisol was analyzed four times a 
day at 8 am, 11am, 2pm and 4pm. Criminals, non-psychopathic as well as psycho-
pathic, reported significantly more traumatic childhood experiences than the control 
group and the non-psychopathic criminals did not differ from psychopathic criminals 
except for PN, which difference was significant. Trauma and salivary cortisol were not 
related in the whole sample.

Nevertheless,  they  found  a  reduction  on  the  Daily  Average  Cortisol  (DAC)  in 
psychopaths that was also significantly related to PA. Besides, the cortisol area under 
the curve (AUC) in that group was related to EA and EN, the diurnal cortisol slope 
was related to PN with a significant relation between the PPI total score and DAC. 
Traumatic  experiences,  in  that  group,  was  also  positively  related  to  impulsive 
nonplanfullness (fourth subscale of the PPI) and external blame attribution factor on 
the  PPI,  while  there  was  a  negative  association  between  traumatic  childhood 
experiences, cold-heartedness and stress immunity. The crucial finding of this study 
was  the  evidence  of  hypoarousal  in  psychopaths  with  a  reduction  of  the  diurnal 
cortisol compared to non-psychopaths. This finding fits with the notion that non-
psychopathic offenders are more reactive, emotional delinquents, while psychopathic 
offenders are more instrumental and cold-blooded.

Two studies analyzed monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
acid transporter (5HTT) alterations in connection to psychopathy and trauma. Sadeh et 
al[17] analyzed 237 inmates with the CTQ and the PCL:SV, and their genetic variations 
of  5HTT  and  MAO-A  were  detected  from  saliva  samples.  The  PCL:SV  factor  1 
(interpersonal/affective facets) was higher in 5HTT long/Long allele vs short/short, 
but  it  was  not  found  an  etiological  explanation  linking  trauma,  psychopathy  and 
genetic alterations. The PCL:SV factor 2 (lifestyle/antisocial facets) was higher in 
people with the MAO-A variant with low activity vs high activity moreover 5HTT 
long/Long  have  higher  PCL:SV  factor  2  than  short/short.  In  particular  MAO-A 
genotype was most consistently associated with the impulsive and irresponsible traits 
of  the  Lifestyle  factor.  Interestingly,  no  correlation  was  found  between  genetic 
alteration and the trauma-psychopathy link. Likewise, in the work of Hollebarch et al
[18], which evaluated trauma (CTQ), psychopathy (Self-Reported Psychopathy scale) 
and  the  MAO-A  uVNTR  genotype  in  a  sample  of  2796  people,  MAO-A  uVNTR 
genotype was significantly associated to general psychopathy in women, meaning that 
women  with  the  MAOA-L  genotype  had  slightly  higher  levels  of  psychopathy 
compared to their MAOA-H counterparts, but they did not find the same in men. 
Childhood trauma was associated with psychopathic traits in adults, both in men and 
women. They did not find any interaction between MAOA uVNTR genotype and any

traumatic factor on psychopathic traits. Their results suggest that psychopathy in 
general, and social deviance in particular, were associated with childhood trauma in 
men and women, and that psychopathic traits are subject to variation of the MAOA 
uVNTR  genotype  in  women.  Hollebarch  and  colleagues[18]  discovered  that  the 
“childhood trauma” factor was not influenced by a variation of MAO-A in men, while 
women with MAOA-H genotype showed a slightly higher scores of PN, EN and EA. 
In  general,  no  significant  link  that  could  explain  the  influence  of  trauma  on 
psychopathy has been discovered yet. We could explain this result with the primary 
and secondary psychopathy theory, according to which the primary psychopathy has 
a  genetic  cause  that  determines  the  onset  of  the  illness  whereas  the  secondary 
psychopathy  has  traumatic  and  problematic  environmental  reasons  as  etiological 
causes. Further genetic study might explain the role of the genetic alterations that 
support the onset of psychopathy.

GENDER  DIFFERENCES  IN  THE  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  TRAUMA 
AND PSYCHOPATHY 

Watts  et  al[19]  analyzed  trauma  (CTQ)  and  psychopathy  (Levenson  self-report 
psychopathy scale) in a non-forensic sample of 1169 subjects (73% female) (Table 3). 
They  underlined  two  gender  differences:  the  first  one  was  the  relation  between 
boldness and childhood neglect that was negative or small to moderate in males but 
almost absent in females. The second was the relation between disinhibition, meanness 
and childhood maltreatment that was stronger for males than females. In their sample, 
men suffered more child abuse than women with the exception of sexual and EAs that 
were more frequent in females.

Thomson and colleagues[20] evaluated the role of sex differences in the association 
between the 4-facet model of psychopathy (PCL-SV) (interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, 
antisocial) and aggression (physical, verbal, and indirect), and LPA (Lifetime Physical 
Abuse)  in  a  sample  of  369  males  and  204  females.  The  relation  between  physical 
aggression and affective facet of psychopathy was significant in both genders. High 
affective traits predicted physical aggression in women with a history of physical 
abuse but not in women without it. Instead, physical aggression was predicted by low 
affective traits in men with a history of physical abuse while lower levels of physical 
aggression  were  associated  with  low  affective  traits  in  men  without  a  history  of 
physical abuse. Moreover, verbal aggression was significantly related to the antisocial 
factor of psychopathy in women. Furthermore, high antisocial traits predicted verbal 
aggression exclusively in men who suffered from physical abuse.

Gender differences were also analyzed by Sevecke et al[21]. They studied 170 male 
and 171 female adolescent detainees using the CTQ, the PCL-YV and the Dimensional 
Assessment of Personality Pathology Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ) for personality 
assessment. They found that gender was a strong predictor of the PCL:YV total score 
and  all  four  psychopathy  dimensions;  incarcerated  male  adolescents  had  a 
significantly higher PCL:YV total score as well as all four psychopathy dimensions 
than incarcerated female adolescents. The PA was related to the antisocial facet of the 
PCL-YV in both males and females and it was also related to the interpersonal facet in

between  emotional  dysregulation  and  psychopathy  than  those  who  reported  PA. 
Opposite to the study of Sveiche et al (no reference), Lansing et al[22] did not find any 
significant difference on the psychopathy scale in males compared to females. Women 
had higher frequencies of emotional and sexual abuse than men. In particular EA was 
the most frequent abuse for EOPD (Early onset persistent delinquent) girls while PA 
was  the  most  common  abuse  among  EOPD  boys.  Nearly  half  of  the  girls  in  their 
sample  suffered  from  SA  which  was  infrequently  reported  by  boys.  A  significant 
correlation between psychopathy and abuse was documented only in women and it 
resulted  particularly  strong  with  EA.  Lansing  and  colleagues  supported  a  lack  of 
significant  relation  between  psychopathy  and  SA  in  men,  and  between  PA  and 
psychopathy in women. Kricher and colleagues[23] examined 185 adolescent inmates 
vs 98 students (control group) and discovered that abuse was more frequent among 
inmates than in the control group; women, in particular, reported significantly more 
emotional, sexual and physical abuses than men. Contrasting with previous studies, 
neither the PCL: YV total score, or any of its four factors significantly differed between 
abused and non-abused women except for the Factor 4 (antisocial psychopathy) that 
significantly correlated to Emotional Neglect in delinquent girls. Instead, boys that 
suffered PA had higher PCL-YV total scores as well as higher Affective and Antisocial 
Factors. Furthermore, they showed poorer Anger Control, more Irresponsibility and 
more Serious Criminal Behavior. Likewise, boys who reported EA were also charac-
terized by significantly higher scores in the Antisocial Factor of the PCL-YV. Authors 
discovered a significant correlation between the Affective Factor 2 and Physical Abuse 
and between the Interpersonal Factor 1 of the PCL-YV and Emotional Neglect in male 
inmates. In contrast with Kricher et al[24], Farina and colleagues found a significant 
relation between trauma and psychopathy in both males and females. Their sample 
was recruited in 2 different penitentiaries: 253 inmates from Pennsylvania and 723 in 
Missouri,  tested  with  the  YPI  and  PPI-SF  scale  for  psychopathy  and  the  CTQ  for 
trauma.  In  the  Pennsylvania  sample  they  found  significantly  more  SA  and  EA  in 
females than in males. Psychopathy was associated with physical and EAs in both 
male and female juvenile offenders with stronger association in girls. No correlation 
was found between SA and psychopathy in both genders. Another important variable 
they  evaluated  was  the  impact  of  PTSD  in  the  relation  between  trauma  and 
psychopathy in males and females. Blonigen et al[25] considered a sample of inmate 
women  (26  of  whom  had  a  PCL-R  >  30).  Interpersonal  and  affective  facets  of 
psychopathy were unrelated to Potentially traumatic events (PET) or PTSD. Instead, 
they  found  a  significant  relation  among  antisocial  facet  and  PET;  furthermore, 
antisocial facet was uniquely associated with PTSD too. The lifestyle facet was prefer-

entially  linked  to  abuse  in  adulthood  and  antisocial  facet  to  abuse  in  childhood. 
Moreover, both PTE and PTSD were related to the factor 2 of psychopathy, known as 
the externalizing spectrum of psychopathy. The theory of primary and secondary 
psychopathy  was  also  investigated  in  the  study  of  Hicks  et  al[26]  They  evaluated 
psychopathy (PCL-R) with a different cut off (25), splitting the sample in 2 groups: 70 
psychopaths and 70 controls. Out of 70 psychopaths, 31 were primary and 39 were 
secondary psychopaths. The secondary psychopaths had personality traits of negative 
emotionality and low behavioral constraint, more substance use disorder, more violent 
behavior and more mental health problems including symptoms of post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  and  suicide  attempts  than  primary  psychopaths.  The  secondary 
psychopaths  suffered  more  PA  than  controls  prisoners  or  primary  psychopaths. 
Instead,  primary  psychopaths  experienced  significantly  more  SA  than  controls. 
Moreover,  secondary  psychopaths  reported  significantly  more  PTSD  symptoms, 
history of mental health treatments and suicidal attempts than control or primary 
psychopaths. An interesting finding was that primary psychopaths had lower rates of 
suicide attempts, though those rates did not differ significantly from that of control 
prisoners.

DISCUSSION

Child  abuse  is  a  serious  public  concern  with  adverse  short  and  long  term 
consequences.  The  aim  of  the  present  narrative  review  is  the  identification  of  the 
development  of  psychopathic  traits  in  victims,  with  a  special  attention  to  gender 
differences and biological reasons.

Primary psychopaths, who are those characterized by a low level of anxiety and lack 
of emotions and sense of guilt, suffer less emotional maltreatments than secondary 
psychopaths,  thus  confirming  the  development  of  that  subtype  of  psychopathy 
(secondary) in response to adverse experiences. In accordance, EA and neglect are 
related to affective facet with higher level of psychopathy at the PCL-R if EA occurs 
during childhood.

The severity of psychopathy is also linked to the moment of exposure to relational 
trauma with more serious traits in case of early exposure during childhood. Traumatic 
exposure  to  domestic  violence  or  violence  in  the  community  is  linked  to  higher 
degrees  of  psychopathy.  Dissociative  symptoms  as  well  as  post-traumatic  stress 
disorder demonstrate weak association in the development of psychopathy after a 
childhood trauma. Similarly, biological correlates that could justify the development of 
psychopathy in response to traumatic experiences have not been demonstrated yet, 
even if women show a variation in the MAOA uVNTR genotype might be associated 
with psychopathic traits in victims of childhood trauma. Generally speaking, men 
show stronger psychopathic traits at the PCL-R and all psychopathic dimensions. A 
strong  gender-oriented  difference  among  several  abuses  and  the  development  of 
psychopathy has not been highlighted yet. Sexual abuse has not been linked to higher 
levels of psychopathy, but it is the only type of abuse that shows higher frequency in 
primary  psychopaths.  This  evidence  is  controversial  because  the  severe  adverse 
consequences of sexual abuse are well documented. It is feasible that sexual abuse 
might be less reported or disclosed, especially by men, due to stigmatization often 
linked to this type of abuse.

Although some kinds of abuse are associated with increased risk of developing 
psychopathy, with gender-oriented differences, the lack of biological explanations still 
limit knowledge on primary psychopathy.

CONCLUSION

Our work highlights a significant relation between trauma and psychopathy: EA, 
emotional neglect and physical abuse are the most frequent types of abuse related to 
psychopathy in males and females. Sexual abuse was the only kind of abuse that did 
not show a significant relation with psychopathy in most studies that we analyzed 
even if it was more frequent in women than men. A biological background, able to 
promote the onset of psychopathy is plausible and should be further investigated. 
Trauma is the key etiological factor of secondary psychopathy.

The  most  frequent  limitations  we  detected  were  evaluations  with  self-reported 
scales since psychopaths have a high inclination to lie. Moreover, almost every study 
investigates inmates, a population with a more frequent history of trauma that could
