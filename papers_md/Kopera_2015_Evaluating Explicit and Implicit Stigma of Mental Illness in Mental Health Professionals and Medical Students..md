Abstract The study investigated explicit and implicit
attitudes towards people with mental illness among medi-
cal students (non-professionals) with no previous contact
with mentally ill patients and psychiatrists and psycho-
therapists (professionals) who had at least 2 years of pro-
fessional contact with mentally ill patients. Explicit
attitudes where assessed by self-report. Implicit attitudes
were measured with the Go/No-Go Association Task, a
variant of the Implicit Association Test
that does not
require the use of a comparison category. Compared to
non-professionals, mental health professionals reported
signiﬁcantly higher approach emotions than non-profes-
sionals towards people with mental illness, showed a lesser
them, and held less
tendency to discriminate against

restrictive attitudes. Both groups reported negative implicit
attitudes towards mentally ill. Results suggest that both
non-professionals and professionals display ambivalent
attitudes towards people with mental illness and that pro-
fessional, long-term contact with people with mental illness
does not necessarily modify negative implicit attitudes.

Introduction

Current research indicates that mental
illness is often
related to social stigmatization, discrimination and pre-
judice and that people with mental illness are often per-
ceived as dangerous, unpredictable and aggressive (Ru¨sch
et al. 2005; Hinshaw and Stier 2008). Despite some
research reporting positive evaluations and attitudes toward
people with mental illness (e.g., Granello and Wheaton
2001; Link and Phelan 1999) and increasing public
knowledge about mental illness, a recent meta-analysis of
changes in public attitudes during the last 20 years,
revealed that attitudes towards people with mental illness
have not signiﬁcantly improved (Schomerus et al. 2012).
The present study was conducted in Poland where studies
performed by Public Opinion Research Center (Wcio´rka
and Wcio´rka 2005, 2008) have found that respondents help
positive attitudes toward people with mental illness; how-
ever, they also believed that social attitudes are generally
negative.

Stigmatization is considered an inﬂuential factor con-
tributing to high dropout rates in the treatment of psychi-
atric population (Ru¨sch et al. 2005). People with mental
illness who internalize negative attitudes toward mental

illness may subsequently avoid seeking treatment (Sirey
et al. 2001). Apart from the consequences of self-stigma-
tization (Corrigan et al. 2006), individuals with mental
illness may be reluctant to seek professional due to antic-
ipation of encountering negative bias within the psychiatric
is
healthcare system (Link and Phelan 2001). Thus,

negative attitudes toward mental illness among the mental

results of studies evaluating differences in

explicit attitudes towards people with mental
between mental health professionals and the general pop-
ulation are inconsistent. For example, Kingdon et al. (2004)
found that psychiatrists’ attitudes toward people with
mental illness were more positive compared to members of
the general population (see also Vibha et al. 2008). On the
contrary, Nordt et al. (2006) reported that psychiatrists had
more negative attitudes towards patients with schizophre-
nia and major depression than a sample from the general
population (see also Aydin et al. 2003; Hansson et al.
2013).

Such conﬂicting results may be, at least in part, due to
the use of self-report assessment measures which introduce
the potential for social desirability bias. Importantly, self-
report measures limit our assessment to that part of the
attitude structure of which we are aware and do not nec-
essarily assess implicit components of attitudes, which
reside outside our conscious control (for rev. Greenwald
and Nosek 2001). As deﬁned by Greenwald and Banaji
(1995) implicit attitudes are ‘‘introspectively unidentiﬁed
(or inaccurately identiﬁed) traces of past experience that
mediate favorable or unfavorable feelings toward an atti-
tude object’’ (p. 6). Measures of implicit cognition provide
the opportunity to reduce deliberate judgment and decrease
the probability that study participants can hide undesired
responses due to social desirability. As evidenced by social
science research, in some cases, explicit and implicit biases
are unrelated and in other cases they are strongly correlated
(Nosek et al. 2002). Consequently implicit and explicit
biases seem to be different predictors of measured behav-
ioral manifestations.

Although there has been a great deal of research con-
cerning explicit attitudes toward people with mental ill-
ness, evaluations of
implicit cognitions are limited,
especially among mental health professionals. One study
found that mental health professionals demonstrated more
positive implicit and explicit evaluations of people with
mental illness than did the groups with little or no mental
health training (general public and undergraduates), and
those with alternate health care experience (other health/

social services professions) (Peris et al. 2008). Studies
among other samples regarding attitudes toward individu-
als with mental illness have reported negative attitudes. For
example, among college students, Teachman et al. (2006)
have established evidence for both implicit and explicit
negative biases against persons with mental illness. Simi-
larly, O’Driscoll et al. (2012) reported that children and
adolescents both implicitly and explicitly stigmatize peers
with attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder and depres-
sion. In the large group of undergraduate students Monteith
and Pettit (2011) conﬁrmed,
implicit responses to
depression were more negative when compared to physical
illness as a contrast condition. Data also suggest
that
negative implicit attitudes toward mental illness are also
manifested by people with mental illness (Teachman et al.
2006) and are related to lower quality of life in this group
(Ru¨sch et al. 2010).

that

Although these prior studies provide useful information
regarding implicit attitudes toward people with mental
illness, they are also limited by their methodology for
assessing implicit attitudes. Most often, studies of this
nature use a modiﬁcation of the Implicit Association Test
(IAT). The IAT method employs a contrasting category
(e.g., physical illness in Teachman et al. 2006 or Monteith
and Pettit 2011 and welfare recipients in Peris et al. 2008);
thus, measurement of implicit attitudes toward one group is
biased by the selection of contrasting category. Context
independent measures, such as the Go/No-Go Association
Task (GNAT; Nosek and Banaji 2001), provide an alter-
native means of assessing this implicit stigma without the
inherent limitation of a contrast category.

Considering prior research and the limitations of the
IAT method,
the purpose of the current study was to
investigate explicit and implicit attitudes towards people
with mental illness among mental health professionals. We
also assessed how professional contact with patients with
mental illness was related to both explicit and implicit
attitudes. Speciﬁcally, we developed the present study to
compare medical students (non-professionals) who never
had professional or long-term contact with mentally ill
patients with psychiatrists and psychotherapists (profes-
sionals) who had at least 2 years of professional contact
with patients with mental illness.

Methods

Participants and Procedure

The study was performed in the Department of Psychiatry at
the Medical University of Warsaw and the research protocol
was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Faculty of
Psychology, University of Warsaw. All measures and

procedures were administered in Polish. Participants inclu-
ded two groups: professionals and non-professionals, all of
whom provided written informed consent. The professionals
group consisted of 29 psychiatrists and psychotherapists
recruited among the personnel of the Department of Psy-
chiatry, including 15 females and 14 males. All professionals
had at least 2 years of clinical experience working with
mentally ill patients. The non-professional group consisted
of 28 ﬁrst-year medical students, including 10 females and
18 males. The students were tested during the integration
camp preceding the beginning of the ﬁrst year. Based on a
preliminary screening, only the students who reported no
previous personal contact with mentally ill people (member
of family, friends, neighbors) were eligible for the study. The
participation in the study was voluntary and participants
were not compensated. All participants completed the study
individually, in a private room. Participants ﬁrst completed a
series of the set of questionnaires (described below), fol-
lowed by the GNAT task using an IBM computer.

Measures

Explicit Attitudes

Participants completed two measures of explicit attitudes
illness. The ﬁrst measure
toward people with mental
(Emotion Scale) was constructed by the authors for the
present study in order to assess emotions that may be
experienced during contact with a person with mental ill-
ness. Participants were instructed to imagine contact with a
person with mental illness (without exact speciﬁcation of
the type of illness) and to then rate the intensity of 10
emotions they could experience during this encounter.
Nine-point Likert scales (ranging from 1 = weak to
9 = strong) were used to assess the intensity of ten emo-
tions: compassion,
interest, sadness, acceptance, anger,
dislike, anxiety, aversion, distrust and indifference. The
selection was driven by the assumption that these emotions
are frequently experienced during the encounter with
mentally ill individuals.

Participants also completed the 51-item Opinions about
Mental Illness Scale (OMI; Cohen and Struening 1962),
which assesses several dimensions of explicit attitudes
toward people with mental illness. This measure included
subscale scores for the following domains: authoritarianism
(tendency to perceive those with mental illness as a class of
people inferior to normal individuals and requiring coer-
cive handling), social restrictiveness (desire to protect the
society by restricting mental patients both during and after
hospitalization), benevolence (encouraging or nurturing
attitude), mental hygiene ideology (need to encourage
equal social participation and incorporation of people with
mental illness into every aspect of community life), and

123

interpersonal etiology (belief that mental illness arises from
negative interpersonal experiences, such as lack of parental
love and attention during childhood). Participants had to
rate each statement on 6-point Likert scale ranging from
strongly agree to strongly disagree. Total scores for each
subscale ranging from: 1 to 46 for mental hygiene, 1–51 for
social restrictiveness, 1–66 for benevolence, 1–56 for
authoritarianism, and 1–36 for interpersonal etiology. The
OMI was translated into Polish by the authors and back-
translated by a native English speaker. Differences were
discussed until a consensus translation was obtained.
Reliability coefﬁcients for each subscale reported by
Cohen and Struening (1962) ranged from alpha = 0.38
(mental hygiene) to 0.89 (authoritarianism). In the present
sample estimates of Cronbach’s alpha were similar. Spe-
ciﬁcally, alphas were 0.43 (mental hygiene), 0.7 (social
restrictiveness), 0.4 (benevolence), 0.6 (authoritarianism),
0.70 (interpersonal etiology).

Implicit Attitudes

The GNAT (Nosek and Banaji 2001) was used to measure
automatic associations between concept (e.g., mental ill-
ness) represented by the target category and attribute (e.g.,
evaluation) categories. In our study, the GNAT consisted of
two blocks. In one block, the target category (mentally ill)
was paired with an attribute (e.g., pleasant) and in the other
block, the target category was paired with the opposing
attribute (e.g., unpleasant). In our version of the test, the
distracter (noise) items reﬂected various professions (e.g.,
journalist) and the opposite attribute (e.g., when ‘unpleas-
ant’ was signal, ‘pleasant’ was noise). During GNAT
administration, labels of the target categories appeared and
remained on the screen in the upper left and right quad-
rants, reminding the target category and target attribute for
a particular block. Participants were instructed to press the
space bar as quickly as possible (Go) for items belonging to
either of the categories which were displayed on the screen
in each particular block. If the item did not belong to either
category they were instructed to withhold the response
(No-Go). For the trials where the participant correctly
responded to an item treated as signal (hits) or did not
respond noise items (correct rejections) a green ‘‘O’’
appeared on the screen during the inter-item interval to
provide feedback about performance accuracy (these trials
were scored as correct responses). On trials where noise
items were incorrectly categorized as signal (false alarms)
or signal items were not categorized (misses) a red ‘‘X’’
appeared below the stimulus item (these trials were scored
as errors). The target category (mentally ill) contained
words that describe mentally ill persons, taken from a
Polish population based national survey performed by The
Public Opinion Research Center (CBOS) (Wcio´rka and

Community Ment Health J (2015) 51:628–634

631

Wcio´rka 2005). From the set of attributes describing
mentally ill patients selected by the respondents, we deci-
ded to include only words which were categorized as
having neutral valence (e.g., schizophrenic, depressive,
neurotic).

Data Analysis

The Emotion Scale was subjected to the factor analysis. All
eigenvalues were higher than 1. Principal components
analysis with oblimin rotation and the inspection of the
scree plot
revealed two factors. The rotated solution
revealed simple structure with all variables loading only on
one factor. The ﬁrst one accounted for 33 % of the total
variance, with eigenvalue = 3.9 and consisted of the items
including anger, dislike, anxiety, aversion, distrust, indif-
ference. Based on the content of the items loading above
0.3 on this factor we labeled the subscale ‘‘Withdrawal
Emotions.’’ Cronbach’s alpha for these items was 0.77. The
second factor labeled, ‘‘Approach Emotions,’’ accounted
for 16 % of variance, with eigenvalue = 1.9 and encom-
passed compassion, interest, sadness, acceptance. Cron-
bach’s alpha for these items was 0.63. Scores on items
within each component were averaged together to create a
mean subscale score. The between-group differences (i.e.,
professional vs. non-professional) in explicit attitudes were
assessed with Student’s t test for independent samples.

The GNAT data were scored according to the algorithm
recommended by Nosek and Banaji (2001). We applied the
measure of sensitivity indexed by d-prime (d0), which
represents the ability to discriminate targets (signal) from
distracters (noise). The proportion of hits and false alarms
was converted into z-scores, and the difference between z-
score values for hits and false alarms was indexed as d0. It
is assumed that greater sensitivity indicates stronger asso-
ciation between the target category (e.g., mentally ill) and
the attribute (e.g., pleasant vs. unpleasant). The Student’s
t test for dependent samples was used for comparing the
strength of positive versus negative associations within
each group.

The criterion for statistical signiﬁcance in all tests was
p \ 0.05. The data were analyzed using SPSS(cid:3) 18.0 for
Windows.

Results

Analyses examining whether professional and non-profes-
sional groups differed in terms of age and gender revealed
that professionals were signiﬁcantly older than non-pro-
fessionals in age (M = 29.52, SD = 3.38 vs. M = 19.21,
SD = 0.86;

ratio (v2 = 1.48; p = 0.22). In both study groups, age was
not signiﬁcantly correlated with explicit and implicit atti-
tudes measures.

Both non-professionals and professionals declared signif-
icantly higher intensity of approach than withdrawal emotions
toward mentally ill individuals [Mapproach = 5.77, SD = 1.64
vs. Mwithdrawal = 3.01, SD = 1.35; t(28) = 6.52; p \ 0.001
for non-professionals; Mapproach = 6.76, SD = 1.16 vs.
Mwithdrawal = 2.59, SD = 1.08; t(30) = 13.83; p \ 0.001 for
professionals]. Professionals reported signiﬁcantly higher
intensity of approach emotions than non-professionals
[M = 6.76 vs. M = 5.77; t(47) = -2.75; p \ 0.02]. The two
groups did not differ signiﬁcantly in the intensity of with-
drawal emotions [t(58) = 1.38; p = 0.07].

Analysis of the results from the OMI Scale revealed that
professionals obtained signiﬁcantly lower scores than non-
professionals on the authoritarianism [M = 17.04, SD =
4.23 vs. M = 21.27, SD = 5.44; t(58) = 3.59; p = 0.001]

There were no between-group differences on the OMI scales
measuring benevolence [t(46) = -1.46; p = 0.15], mental
hygiene ideology [t(57) = -0.51; p = 0.56] and interper-
sonal etiology [t(58) = 1.55; p = 0.13].

restrictiveness

With regard to implicit attitudes as measured by the GNAT,
both groups of participants showed greater sensitivity to
mentally ill ? unpleasant than to mentally ill ? pleasant,
suggesting a negative implicit attitude toward people with
mental illness. This effect was observed for both non-pro-
fessionals [Munpleasant = 2.4, SD = 0.89 vs. Mpleasant = 1.73,
SD = 0.77; t(29) = -7.05; p \ 0.001; Cohen’s d = 0.8]
and professionals [M = 2.21unpleasant, SD = 0.78 vs. Mpleas-
ant = 1.89, SD = 0.71; t(26) = -3.28; p \ 0.003; Cohen’s
d = 0.4]. There were no between-group differences among
professionals and non-professionals in sensitivity to mentally
ill ? unpleasant
[t(55) = 0.84; p = 0.4] and mentally
ill ? pleasant [t(56) = -0.84; p = 0.4].

Discussion

The current study investigated implicit and explicit atti-
tudes toward individuals with mental illness in Poland
among professionals with mental health training (psychia-
trists or psychotherapists with at least 2 years of profes-
sional experience in clinical work) and ﬁrst year medical
students reporting no personal contact with mental illness
(i.e., non-professionals). We investigated whether long-
term professional contact with patients with mental illness
was associated with differences explicit and implicit atti-
tudes compared to having no professional or personal
contact with individuals with mental illness. Results indi-
cated that both groups self-reported positive explicit

123

attitudes towards individuals with mental illness. There are
several possible interpretations of this ﬁnding.

First, it is plausible that informational and educational
campaigns and programs to reduce stigma related to mental
illness introduced in Poland in the recent years have been
successful (e.g., Open the Doors program of the World
Psychiatric Association since 2000). Thus, these favorable
attitudes may be a result of a societal shift of self-reported
evaluations in a positive direction, however the absence of
an experimental design precludes testing this hypothesis.

Alternatively, these results may reveal a need for social
approval by members of the study groups. According to
social norms, individuals with mental illness are supposed
to be the object of tolerance and acceptance, and it is not
appropriate and socially acceptable to express prejudice
overtly (e.g., Teachman et al. 2006), and this belief may be
even stronger among those in the helping professions. For
example, when looking at the between-group differences,
professionals declared more positive explicit evaluations,
expressed in higher approach emotions, less authoritari-
anism and less social restrictiveness than non-profession-
als. Following the social desirability effect, professionals’
responses may be even more distorted than students’
responses in terms of what they perceive to be profes-
sionally desirable. Also, these results can be interpreted
through the lens of the contact hypothesis (Pettigrew and
Tropp 2005) which suggests that interaction with members
of stigmatized groups works to reduce stigmatizing atti-
tudes and behaviors. There is some evidence, that personal
contact with people with mental illness may reduce stigma
(Ogedengbe 1993; Penn et al. 1994; Peris et al. 2008),
however, opposite results have been also reported (Murphy
et al. 1993; Weller and Grunes 1988). Finally, it is also
possible that that the more positive evaluations reported by
professionals may reﬂect generally more favorable views
that these individuals had even before entering the mental
health ﬁeld.

In contrast, there were no between group differences on
implicit attitudes towards the category ‘‘mentally ill.’’
Analysis of the GNAT results revealed that participants
were more likely to associate mental illness with negative
than positive attributes. The effect sizes were high for non-
professionals (Cohen’s d = 0.8), and moderate for pro-
fessionals (Cohen’s d = 0.4). Our results are in contrast
with Peris et al. (2008) ﬁndings which showed positive
implicit attitudes toward mental illness which were sig-
niﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the level of professional mental
health training (i.e., more training was related to less
stigma). It is plausible, that this discrepancy between the
studies is due to the different measurement strategies to
appraise implicit mental illness stigma and results from the
the comparison category. Using welfare
selection of
recipients as comparison category in the IAT, Peris and

123

colleagues introduced another stigmatized group as the
reference for the people with mental illness. Despite the
well-documented utility of the IAT (Greenwald et al. 2009)
as a measure of implicit attitudes it is not possible to
interpret its results irrespective of the contrasting category.
In this case the evaluations of persons with mental illness
depended on the evaluations of welfare recipients. Alter-
natively, the GNAT as utilized as a measure of automati-
cally activated evaluation in our study, does not depend on
the selection of the comparison category and is therefore
free from this particular kind of bias. The present results
are consistent with those negative implicit attitudes
towards individuals with mental illness measured with the
IAT among non-professionals as reported in Teachman
et al. (2006), as well as towards depression in Monteith and
Pettit (2011). However, it is also important to note that in
both studies a comparison category (physical illness) was
utilized.

Our study results also indicate that attitudes toward
people with mental illness are ambivalent both among
students and professionals. Observed dissociations between
explicit and implicit attitudes have been commonly
reported in the studies on attitudes toward other stigma-
tized groups, such as members of racial, ethnic, and sexual
minorities (Rudman et al. 1999; Devos and Banaji 2005;
Steffens 2008). Likewise, individuals with mental illness
might be the object of the same attitudinal dissociation.
This may vary based on level of contact and professional
training. However despite clearly positive self-reported
evaluations among both professionals and non-profession-
als, both groups’ implicit attitudes indicated a negative
bias. When intentional control over behavior was elimi-
nated, non-professionals tended to associate mentally ill
with negative evaluations. Because, lay concepts of mental
disorder are molded by episodic and tendentious informa-
tion presented by media or culturally inherited myths and
stereotypes (Wahl 1995), it is not surprising that these non-
professionals who lacked personal contact with mental
illness had implicit biases.

Yet more intriguing is similar dissociation observed
between explicit and implicit attitudes in professionals. Our
results suggest that despite the therapeutic training, pro-
fessional knowledge, and everyday contact, which are the
factors that presumably should counteract biased views of
mental illness, implicit evaluations were negative. This
outcome may indicate the persistence of implicit attitudes.
Contrary to our study results, prior research with mental
health care professionals reported more positive implicit
evaluations compared to groups with little or no mental
health training, and those with other health care experience
(Peris et al. 2008). Alternatively, Teachman and Brown-
well (2001) reported strong implicit anti-fat bias among
health professionals who specialize and work with obese

(e.g.,

factors

self-presentation) or

patients. Automatic evaluations of overweight persons as
bad and lazy were also prevalent in this group. However, it
is important to note that both our results and those of prior
studies evaluating implicit and explicit bias may be inﬂu-
enced according to possible moderators such as interper-
intrapersonal
sonal
factors (e.g., amount of personal experience with a par-
ticular domain; Nosek 2007), or other factors such as
research measurement, design, and sampling procedure.
Further, negative implicit attitudes among professionals,
may reﬂect the unconscious emotions related to clinical
work. Among other medical professions, mental health
professions are considered to be lower in status (Hinshaw
and Stier 2008). Working with individuals with mental
illness is often described as difﬁcult and prone to burnout.
Moreover, the salaries of mental health workers are on the
low end of ranges for the general health staff (Hinshaw and
Stier 2008). Thus, it is plausible that these factors inﬂuence
professionals’ attitudes toward their patients.

Despite these implications, there are several limitations of
the present study. The study sample was relatively small and
thus caution must be exercised when generalizing the ﬁnd-
ings. The mental health professionals were on average
10 years older than the medical students. Moreover, the
selected category (‘‘mentally ill’’), may be far more hetero-
geneous for mental health professionals as compared to the
general population. For example, psychiatrists and psycho-
therapists work with patients suffering from various mental
health problems; thus, there could be variations in implicit
and explicit attitudes depending on presentation and diag-
nosis (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, personality disor-
ders, or schizophrenia). Therefore, when assessing bias in
this speciﬁc population more information might be obtained
by evaluating attitudes within a diagnostic category. Fur-
thermore, it is plausible that our use of the category ‘‘men-
tally ill’’ is a subcategory within the wider (and more general)
‘‘ill’’ category. Assuming that neutral (without emotional
valence) representations of the given category does not
inﬂuence GNAT results (Nosek and Banaji 2001), partici-
pants may automatically react to the ‘‘ill’’ as target category
and it seems unlikely that people may associate ‘‘ill’’ with
the category
‘‘good’’ attributes. Furthermore, even if
‘‘mentally ill’’ is associated with more positive attitudes,
automatic behavioral reactions might be driven more by a
general tendency to react to the concept of ‘‘illness’’ which is
clearly related to suffering. Furthermore, it is important to
note that in our study, we could not experimentally manip-
ulate personal and/or professional contact with individuals
with mental illness, therefore causality cannot be deter-
mined. Further, results may have been biased by demand
characteristics. Finally, the study was performed in the
University Clinic and results may not be generalizable to
professionals and non-professionals from other settings.

The present results suggest several practical implica-
tions. Given the discrepancy found between explicit and
implicit attitudes as well as previous reports (e.g., Teach-
man et al. 2006), explicit measures might be strongly
inﬂuenced by social desirability and, therefore, may not
adequately assess signiﬁcant dimensions of the attitude
construct. Relying only on the self-report measures pro-
vides information about how people believe they should
feel, but may still be in contrast to their behavior. As the
data from the domain of racial prejudice indicate, implicit
bias may predict prejudiced behaviors more effectively
than self-report (e.g., Dovidio et al. 2002, 2007). Following
the Peris et al. (2008) study results, implicit and explicit
biases toward mental illness may predict different clinical
decision-making. Corrigan et al. (2002), found that fear of
dangerousness negatively predicted helping behavior
toward individuals with mental
illness. In light of the
negative automatic bias revealed in professionals in our
study it would be reasonable to expand knowledge con-
cerning stigmatization in mental health care professionals
during their training and look for the new strategies to
modify it. This knowledge may reduce bias and prevent
discrimination. Educational programs, anti-stigma cam-
paigns and personal contact with mentally ill individuals
are still considered to be important factors for reducing
stigma; however, it is possible that all these actions inﬂu-
ence only the explicit level of attitudes and do not impact
unintentional processes grounded in the implicit bias.
Consequently, community-based stigma reduction pro-
grams and campaigns may not be fully effective and
therefore future research must evaluate methods
for
reducing implicit biases as well.
