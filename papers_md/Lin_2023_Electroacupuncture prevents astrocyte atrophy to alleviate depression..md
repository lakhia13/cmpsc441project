Astrocyte atrophy is the main histopathological hallmark of major depressive disorder (MDD) in humans and in animal models of
depression. Here we show that electroacupuncture prevents astrocyte atrophy in the prefrontal cortex and alleviates depressive-like
behaviour in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Treatment of mice with CUMS induced depressive-like
phenotypes as conﬁrmed by sucrose preference test, tail suspension test, and forced swimming test. These behavioural changes
were paralleled with morphological atrophy of astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex, revealed by analysis of 3D reconstructions of
confocal Z-stack images of mCherry expressing astrocytes. This morphological atrophy was accompanied by a decrease in the
expression of cytoskeletal linker Ezrin, associated with formation of astrocytic leaﬂets, which form astroglial synaptic cradle.
Electroacupuncture at the acupoint ST36, as well as treatment with anti-depressant ﬂuoxetine, prevented depressive-like
behaviours, astrocytic atrophy, and down-regulation of astrocytic ezrin. In conclusion, our data further strengthen the notion of a
primary role of astrocytic atrophy in depression and reveal astrocytes as cellular target for electroacupuncture in treatment of
depressive disorders.

INTRODUCTION
Astrocytes are principal homeostatic cells of the central nervous
system (CNS) supporting nervous tissue at all levels of organisa-
from molecular to organ-wide [1]. Astrocytes present a
tion,
complex spongiform morphology formed by numerous tiny
peripheral processes known as leaﬂets emanating from primary
and higher order processes known as branches [2, 3]. Astrocytic
leaﬂets establish contacts with synapses and form synaptic cradle
to foster and maintain synaptic connectivity [4, 5]. In particular,
leaﬂets
are densely populated by diverse plasmalemmal
Na+-dependent
transporters responsible for neurotransmitter
and ion homeostasis in the synaptic cleft [6, 7].
In addition,
astrocytes secrete numerous factors modulating synaptic function
[8]. The leaﬂets demonstrate high degree of physiological
morphological plasticity, which also modulates synaptic transmis-
sion [9]. In ageing and various forms of neuropathology shrinkage
leaﬂets leads to reduced homeostatic support, aberrant
of
neurotransmitters
spillover, and impaired synaptic plasticity
[9–11]. Astrocytic atrophy with reduced leaﬂets presence is
prominent in brain ageing [10] and is implicated in pathophysiol-
ogy of a wide range of neurological diseases [12],
including
neurodegenerative disorders [13, 14], epilepsy [15], addiction [16],

and mood disorders [17]. Astrocytic atrophy is the leading
histopathological signature of mood disorders in response to
stress, in particular in the major depressive disorder (MDD) [18–20]
and post-traumatic stress disorder [21].

Pharmacological management of MDD remains a challenge,
with many patients being resistant to traditional antidepressants.
Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation is employed as an effective
and safe therapy to treat multiple diseases including inﬂammation
[22, 23], Parkinson’s disease [24], insomnia [25–27], anxiety [28]
and depression [29–31]. The EA at selective acupoints Dazhui
(DU14) and Baihui
(DU20) was shown to restore inhibitory/
excitatory balance and improve cognition in mouse models of
Alzheimer’s disease [32]. Several studies indicated that EA affects
astrocytes by modulating expression of glial ﬁbrillary acid protein
(GFAP) [33] and production of ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2),
the latter being beneﬁcial for alleviating depressive-like behaviour
[31].

In the present study, using high-resolution morphological
reconstructions we analysed protoplasmic astrocytes in the
prefrontal cortex of healthy control mice and mice, which
developed depressive-like behaviours following exposure to
chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We found that CUMS

RESULTS
Validation of the depression model: CUMS triggers anhedonia
and depressive-like behaviours
Exposure of rodents to CUMS and its variants is widely used to
model depression [20, 34–36]. The experimental design including
the timeline of
the experimental protocol and positions of
acupoints used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Treatment of
mice with CUMS regimen for 4 weeks resulted in a signiﬁcant
decrease in sucrose preference reﬂecting the development of
anhedonia, one of the key signs of depression in patients [37–39].
The sucrose consumption decreased from 0.88 ± 0.01 in control to
0.58 ± 0.05, p < 0.001, n = 6 in mice exposed to CUMS protocol
(Fig. 2A). Similarly, exposure to CUMS regimen affected mouse
behaviours as revealed in a series of tests. The immobility time in
both tail suspension test (TST) and force swimming test (FST) was
signiﬁcantly prolonged (from 100.1 ± 4.8 in control to 155.1 ± 6.3,
p < 0.001, n = 6 in CUMS group and from 58.4 ± 4.0 in control to
139.1 ± 3.09, p < 0.001, n = 6 in CUMS group respectively; Fig. 2B,
C). In the open ﬁeld test CUMS decreased exploratory behaviour as
demonstrated by a decrease in total running distance, centre-

Fig. 2D–G). Together, these data indicate that CUMS induces
depressive-like behaviours.

Depression is associated with astrocytic atrophy: CUMS
reduces morphological proﬁles and decreases expression of
ezrin
To access morphological changes in astrocytes following CUMS
we labelled astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice by
stereotactic injection of AAV5·gfaABC1D·mCherry [40], which
allowed reliable morphometric analysis (Fig. 3). The three-
reconstructions of mCherry-labelled healthy
dimensional
and stressed astrocytes were made from z-stacks of
images
obtained with confocal microscopy (Fig. 3A). Astrocytic 3D-
reconstructions were subjected to Scholl analysis inbuilt in the
Imaris software. Exposure to CUMS regimen resulted in a
substantial decrease in astrocytic size and complexity (Fig. 3).
The maximal number of intersections was signiﬁcantly decreased
from 13.5 ± 0.9 in healthy to 8.2 ± 0.4 in depressed animals
(p < 0.001; n = 15, Fig. 3B, C), while and the length of astrocytic
branches decreased from 11.6 ± 0.7 µm in control to 8.0 ± 0.2 µm,
p < 0.001 in CUMS mice; n = 15 (Fig. 3D). Similarly, exposure to
CUMS protocol signiﬁcantly reduced the size of astrocytic
territorial domain (from 1151.6 ± 44.3 µm2
to
in control
283.7 ± 13.3 µm2 in CUMS animals, p < 0.001; n = 6, Fig. 3E, F).

Ezrin, a member of ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family tethers
actin ﬁlaments to the plasma membrane, and is essential for the
formation and structural plasticity of astrocytic leaﬂets and
astrocyte-synaptic interactions [41, 42]. We quantiﬁed ezrin
expression with immunocytochemistry, applied to the PFC
preparations from mice subjected to mCherry astrocytic labelling

drug ﬂuoxetine (a.k.a Prozac). We found that treatment with
ﬂuoxetine as well as treatment with EA at Zusanli acupoint (足三
里, ST36) used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for therapy of
depression fully prevented the development of depressive-like
behaviours in CUMS exposed mice (Fig. 5). In particular, in animals
treated with ﬂuoxetine and EA sucrose consumption was
signiﬁcantly higher compared to the CUMS group (Fig. 5A;
ﬂuoxetine: 0.8 ± 0.03 vs. 0.6 ± 0.05 in CUMS, p < 0.001 EA:
0.8 ± 0.03 vs. 0.6 ± 0.05 in CUMS; p < 0.01, n = 6). Similarly,
ﬂuoxetine and EA prevented the development of depression-like
behaviours in TST and FST (Fig. 5B, C); both treatments also
prevented a decrease in exploratory behaviours in the open ﬁeld
test (Fig. 5D–G). The efﬁcacy of ﬂuoxetine and EA were similar
without any signiﬁcant defences in tests readouts. At the same
time, neither injection of PBS nor sham electroacupuncture (EA1,
EA2: acupuncture without electrical stimulation or acupuncture in
clinically irrelevant acupoints, see methods section) were effective
in preventing the development of depressive-like behaviours in
mice exposed to the CUMS protocol.

Fluoxetine and EA prevent astrocyte atrophy and increase the
presence of ezrin
In parallel with preventing the development of depression-like
behaviours, treatment with ﬂuoxetine and exposure to EA averted
CUMS-induced astrocytic atrophy (Fig. 6) and CUMS-induced
decrease of astrocyte-associated ezrin (Fig. 7). In particular, in the
animals subjected to ﬂuoxetin or EA treatments maximal number
of intersections and length of astrocytic branches was signiﬁcantly
than in the CUMS group (Intersections; ﬂuoxetine:
higher
14.2 ± 0.5 vs. 8.2 ± 0.4 in CUMS; p < 001, n = 15; EA: 17 ± 1.0 vs.

13.6 ± 0.6 vs. 8.0 ± 0.2 in CUMS; p < 0.001, n = 15; EA: 14.0 ± 0.7 vs
8.0 ± 0.2 to p < 0.001; n = 15; Fig. 6A–C). Likewise, both ﬂuoxetine
and EA prevented CUMS-induced decrease in astrocytic territorial
domain (ﬂuoxetine: 790.5 ± 43.2 vs. 283.7 ± 13.4 in CUMS;

p < 0.001, n = 6; EA: 1078.0 ± 62.3 μm2 vs. 283.7 ± 13.4 μm2 in
CUMS; n = 6; Fig. 6D). Neither injections of PBS, nor sham EA were
able to prevent CUMS-induced changes in astrocytic morphology
(Fig. 6B–D).

Similar effects ﬂuoxetin and EA exerted on ezrin association

treatment the ﬂuorescence intensity of ezrin associated with
astrocytic domain was signiﬁcantly higher than in CUMS only
group (ﬂuoxetine: 1248.4 ± 140.5 vs. 703.8 ± 19.4 in CUMS; p < 0.01
n = 15; EA: 1176.14 ± 254.6 vs. 703.8 ± 19.4 in CUMS, p < 0.05;
n = 15, Fig. 7B).
Immunolabelled ezrin puncta increased homo-
geneously in soma and branches areas (Fig. 7B). Again, neither
injections of PBS, nor sham EA affected ezrin levels.

DISCUSSION
Chronic stress induces astrocytic atrophy: pathophysiological
relevance for depression
Using high-resolution morphometric analysis we conﬁrmed
previous observations showing that chronic stress causes mor-
phological atrophy of astrocytes in several areas of the brain
including PFC [20, 43, 44], which was the focus of our study. The
high-resolution morphometry of astrocytes
in situ requires
cytosolic labelling with ﬂuorescent probe; the latter could be
either injected into the cells of interest through microelectrode
(for example Lucifer yellow [40]), or patch-pipette (for example
Alexa Fluor 594 [45]) or expressed under the control of astroglia-
speciﬁc promoter (such as Aldh1l1 [20] or Gfap [43]). In our study,
we used mCherry and Gfap promoter for a viral transfection
(AAV5-gfaABC1D-mCherry; see also [40]). Astrocytic atrophy was
quantiﬁed by Scholl analysis, which showed signiﬁcant decrease in
the number of
intersections, decreased length of astrocytic
branches and reduced area of astrocytic territorial domains
(Fig. 2). In addition, chronic stress affected astrocytic presence of
ezrin, as judged by immunocytochemistry—in animals exposed to

indicated in each column.

CUMS number of labelled ezrin puncta associated with individual
astrocytes (both at the soma and at branches) was signiﬁcantly
decreased (Fig. 3). Ezrin is a linker of plasmalemma and
cytoskeleton, and it is critical for formation and morphological
plasticity of astrocytic leaﬂets [41, 46]; decrease in ezrin leads to a
decrease in the number and/or volume of leaﬂets. The leaﬂets are
idiosyncratic morphology of protoplasmic astrocytes,
part of
which gives them spongiform or bushy appearance [3]. These
leaﬂets are characterised by an extremely high surface-to-volume
ratio and absence of organelles [3, 47], which stipulates speciﬁcity
of ionic signalling in these compartments (predominance of Ca2+
entry and prominence of Na+ signalling [48, 49]). The leaﬂets are
closely associated with synapses and, by virtue of high density of
plasmalemmal homeostatic transporters, sustain and regulate
synaptic transmission [2].

Astroglial atrophy, asthenia and loss of function is a distinct
astrogliopathological entity observed in many neurological
diseases [12]. Decreased astrocytic presence in the brain active
milieu has multiple consequences. Shrunken astrocytes open
diffusional channels and facilitate volume transmission [50]; at the
level of single synapses, reduced presence of astrocytic leaﬂets
impairs clearance of glutamate, leading to increased availability
(with possible excitotoxic repercussions) and spillover of the latter
thus affecting synaptic plasticity [10]. Furthermore, reduced glial
presence limits homeostatic support, provision of glutamine, K+
buffering, control over pH and supply of scavengers of reactive
oxygen species [2, 51]. To the contrary, when the growth of

astrocytic leaﬂets is promoted,
the synaptic
transmission is increased. Astrocytes are characterised by high
degree of morphological plasticity and various environmental
factors are known to increase astrocytic domains, mainly through
an increase of
factors
include, for example, enriched environment and physical activity
[52, 53], dieting [45, 54] and other life style factors, positively
impacting cognitive abilities [55]. In the context of mood disorders
astrocytic atrophy can contribute to the aberrant neurotransmis-
sion and affect neuronal survival and overall functional perfor-
speciﬁc manipulation with astrocytes and
mance.
astrocytic homeostatic cascades can induce depression-like
behaviours, whereas treatment with antidepressants rescues these
behaviours and reverses astrocytic atrophy [56, 57]. Here we
demonstrate that EA acts very similarly to chemical antidepres-
sants and prevents development of depressive behaviours and
astrocytic atrophy in the PFC of mice exposed to CUMS.

Indeed,

Electroacupuncture acts on astrocytes to prevent depression?. Acu-
puncture was used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a
therapeutic manipulation for last 3000 to 4000 years [58]; with
the ﬁrst codex formalising acupuncture treatments (The Yellow
Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine) was published around 100
BC [59]. Acupuncture is now used worldwide for treatment of
various medical conditions [22, 60–62]. Acupuncture is employed
for therapies of neuropsychiatric diseases,
including depression
[63, 64] and anxiety [65]. In particular, 6 weeks of acupuncture at

acupoints Baihui (GV20) and Zusanli (ST36), or Taichong (LR3),
Sanyinjiao (SP6), Neiguan (PC6), and Shenmen (HT7), was as
effective as oral ﬂuoxetine in treating depression, although
acupuncture showed better response and improvement rates
[66]. Similarly, acupuncture at ST36 and CV4 acupoints was
effective in alleviating depressive-like behaviours in animal
models [67, 68]. In our present study, we chose to perform EA
at the Zusanli (ST36, 足三里, or point of longevity) acupoint,
known to be linked to the brain. Acupuncture at this acupoint
affects brain metabolism of glucose [69], modulates excitation-
inhibition balance in cortex [70] and triggers responses of several
brain areas
including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), occipital cortices, somato-
sensory cortex, and midbrain [71, 72].

We found that EA, as well as treatment with ﬂuoxetine fully
prevents the development of depressive-like behaviours in mice
subjected to chronic stress (Figs. 2, 5). To elucidate the possible
brain cellular target of the EA, we performed in depth analysis of
ﬁne morphology of cortical astrocytes, known to become atrophic
in depression. Exposure of mice to the CUMS regimen led, as
to a signiﬁcant decrease in astrocytic size and
expected,
complexity (Fig. 3), which were fully prevented by both ﬂuoxetine
treatment and EA at acupoint ST36. This effect was speciﬁc as
sham acupuncture was ineffective. Treatment with EA (as well as
with ﬂuoxetine) prevented decrease in ezrin associated with
astrocytic structures. We may therefore suggest that chronic stress

leads to a retraction of astrocytic leaﬂets and decrease of
astrocyte-synaptic association, which in turn impairs synaptic
transmission and plasticity, as has been demonstrated in ageing
and various neuropathologies [10, 45, 50, 54] (responsible for
generation of depressive-like behaviours. Our data are supported
by recent observation demonstrating that EA restores expression
of astrocyte-speciﬁc glutamate transporter EAAT2 following
chronic stress;
restoration developed in parallel with
amelioration of depressive-like behaviours [73, 74].

What are the mechanisms translating acupuncture into changes
in astrocytic morphology and functional boost which protects
against depressive changes instigated by chronic stress? At this
stage we can only speculate. As we demonstrated in this study,
classic anti-depressant ﬂuoxetine rescues stress-induced depres-
sive behaviours as well as prevents astrocytic atrophy. Fluoxetine
serotonin
acts on astrocytes either
transporter SERT/ SLC6A4 (which, however, is mainly expressed
in neurones) or through acting directly on astrocytic 5-HT2B
receptors. Activation of these receptors by ﬂuoxetine triggers
several signalling cascades [75, 76], and induces transactivation of
epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), which, in turn, recruits
MAPK/ERK or PI3K/AKT downstream cascades to regulate expres-
sion of several genes (such as Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2,
cPLA2, subtype 2 of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA’s,
ADAR2, or subtype 2 of kainate receptors, GluK2) related to mood
disorders [77]. Fluoxetine also normalises interstitial pH which is

affected in mood disorders by phosphorylating and stimulating
astrocytic Na+-H+ transporter NHE/SLC9a1 [78]. Whether EA may
act through the similar cascade requires further investigation. We
may only note that EA can also act though stimulation of the
subcortical nuclei [79] by activation noradrenergic or dopaminer-
gic systems, known to stimulate speciﬁc astrocytic receptors to
induce various signalling cascades [80–82].

CONCLUSION
In summary, we demonstrated that EA prevents the development
of depression-like behaviours in mice exposed to chronic stress. At
cellular and molecular levels, EA prevents morphological atrophy
of astrocytes (which is a leading histopathological hallmark of
depression) as well as the decrease in astrocyte-associated ezrin
that controls ﬁne morphology of these cells. Our study therefore
provides, for the ﬁrst time, experimental evidence for an idea that
EA boosts astrocytic presence in the brain active milieu thus
protecting it against stress-induced pathological deformations
resulting in depressive behaviours.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All experiments were performed on C57BL/6 mice (obtained from
Chengdu Dossy Experimental Animal Co., Chengdu, China); the mice were
7 weeks old at the beginning of the experimental protocol, which lasted
7 weeks (Fig. 1A). All mice were adapted to the standard laboratory
conditions (24 ± 2 °C room temperature and 65 ± 5% humidity on 12/12 h
light-dark cycles) with drinking water and food available ad libitum. No
statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our

sample sizes are similar
to those reported in previous publications
[15, 20, 36]. The experimental procedures were made in accordance with
the National
Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of
Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (protocol code,
AM3520, 8 May 2019).

Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) regimen
Mice were exposed to the random sequence of stressors during each 24-h
period for 4 weeks, as previously described [34, 83]. These stressors
included water and food deprivation (12 h), cage tilt 45° (12 h), group
housing (12 h), swimming in 4 °C water (5 min), foot shock (1 mA, 5 min),
noise (120 dB for 3 h), tail suspension (5 min), damp bedding (12 h), cage
shaking (40/min for 5 min), and restraint (1 h).

randomly assigned):
interventions;
(iii)
CUMS + ﬂuoxetine group—animals exposed to CUMS and weekly injec-
tions (for all period of CUMS treatment) of ﬂuoxetine at 10 mg/kg; (iv)
CUMS + PBS group, animals exposed to CUMS and daily injections of PBS
(0.2 ml); (v) EA group animals exposed to EA daily and (vi-vii) sham EA1 and
EA2 groups exposed to sham acupuncture daily.

EA was administered at roughly the same time of the day (10:00 a.m. to
11:00 a.m.) to awake animals, immobilised by two Velcro brand hooks and
loop fasteners as well as additional tapes ﬁxed to a wooden block for the
duration of EA [84]. EA was delivered to the therapeutically relevant Zusanli
acupoint (ST36; located at the knee, about 2 mm for mice below the ﬁbular
head). An electrical current of 0.5 mA and a frequency of 2 Hz was
delivered for 30 min, by an acupoint nerve electrostimulator (HANS-200,
Nanjing Jisheng Medical Technology Co., Jiangsu, China). EA was applied

through stainless steel needles (2.5 cm long, 0.25 mm diameter; Hwato-
Med. Co., Jiangsu, China), introduced 2–3 mm deep below the skin at ST36
unilaterally. Sham treatments were as follows. In the sham EA1 group the
needle was inserted but the electrical stimulation was not applied. In the
sham EA2 sham group the needle was positions at the non-acupoint at the
tail [85].

Behavioural tests
Sucrose preference test.
The sucrose preference test is a reward-based test
and a measure of anhedonia, as previously described [86]. The mice were
singly caged for 3 days and given two 50 mL bottles containing water or
water-based 1% sucrose solution (wt/vol), respectively. The bottle positions
were switched daily to avoid a side bias. Following a 24 h period of water
and food deprivation, the preference for sucrose or water was determined
overnight. Sucrose preference (%) was quantiﬁed as (vol sucrose/(vol
sucrose + vol water)) × 100%.

Tail suspension test.
The tail suspension test is a behavioural despair-
based test assessing the duration of immobility of mice subjected to
inexorable conditions, as previously described [87]. Each mouse was
suspended by its tail at a height of 20–25 cm by using a piece of adhesive
tape wrapped around the tail 1 cm from the tip. Behaviour was recorded
for 6 min. The duration of immobility was calculated by an observer
blinded to the treatment groups. The mice were considered to be
immobile only when they remained completely motionless; mice that
climbed along their tails were not included.

The FST was performed as previously described
Forced swimming test.
in a clear glass cylinder ﬁlled with water (temperature, 23–25 °C);
[86],
cylinder’s dimensions were: height, 30 cm; diameter, 20 cm; water level,
15 cm. Mice were gently placed in the tanks. Behaviour was recorded for
6 min. The movement of the animals was video recorded and analysed
later. Following the swimming session, the mice were removed from the
water by their tails, gently dried with towels, and kept warm under a lamp
in their home cages. They were considered to be immobile whenever they
stopped swimming and remained ﬂoating passively, still keeping their
heads above the surface of the water.

Open ﬁeld test.
The open ﬁeld test was performed as previously described
[86]. The apparatus consisted of a rectangular chamber (50 × 50 × 50 cm)
made of white, high-density, non-porous plastic. Mice were gently placed
in the centre of the chamber and their motility was recorded for 10 min.
The total running distance, and the time spent in the centre versus the
the open ﬁeld chamber were recorded by a camera
periphery of
connected to a computer using an automated video tracking program
(EthoVision XT 9.0; Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands). The chamber
was thoroughly cleaned with 95% ethanol, and dried prior to use and
before subsequent tests, to remove any scent clues left by the previous
subject.

AAVs microinjections
Viral injections were performed at the end of week 3 of CUMS treatment as
indicated in Fig. 1 by using a stereotaxic apparatus (RWD, Shenzhen, China)
to guide the placement of a Hamilton syringe ﬁxed with bevelled glass
pipettes (Sutter Instrument, 1.0-mm outer diameter) into the PFC [88]. The
injection site was located at half of the distance along a line deﬁned
between each eye and the lambda intersection of the skull. The needle was
held perpendicular to the skull surface during insertion to a depth of
approximately 0.2 mm. A total of 0.7 μl of AAV5-gfaABC1D-mCherry
(1 × 1012 gc/mL; Taitool Bioscience, Shanghai, China), was slowly injected
into right sides of the PFC. Glass pipettes were left in place for at least
5 min. After injection, animals were allowed to completely recover under a
warming blanket and then returned to the home cage.

Immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfused in the morning with cold paraformaldehyde (PFA, 4%
w/v in phosphate buffer saline (PBS)) under deep isoﬂurane (2%, 5 min)
and pentobarbitone (1%, 50 mg/kg) anaesthesia. Brains were collected,
postﬁxed and cryoprotected in 30% (w/v) sucrose solution. Brains were cut
using a cryostat
in 45 um thick sections; slices were immediately
transferred into storing solution (30% w/v sucrose and 30% ethylene
in PBS) and kept at 80 °C until use. Free-ﬂoating sections were
glycol
incubated 1 h in saturation solution (6% fetal calf serum in PBS). The

sections were then incubated overnight in the same solution comple-
mented with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-Ezrin 1:100 CellSignalling,
Danvers, Massachusetts, USA). After washing in PBS three times, slices were
incubated 1 h at 37 °C in saturation solution containing the relevant
secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California, USA). After washing in PBS three times, labelling nucleus with
DAPI, the coverslips were mounted on slides using anti-fade solution
(Solarbio, Beijing, China). Confocal microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) or
normal ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) were used to
obtain images.

Sholl analysis
Sholl analysis is a commonly used method to quantify astrocyte process
complexity [43, 54]. All processing steps were performed using image
analysis
[https://imagej.net/imagej-wiki-static/
Sholl_Analysis]. In brief, Z-stacks corresponding to the emission spectrum
(565–610 nm) of mCherry-labelling (resolution was 512 × 512 pixels
(0.2 μm/px) on XY axis with a step on Z-axis 1 μm/frame were re-
sampled to the same lateral resolution of 0.25 μm/px.

ImageJ

3D reconstructions
The confocal imaging stacks were collected with a Z-step size of 0.25 μm
under a confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three-dimensional
reconstructions were processed ofﬂine using Imaris 7.4.2 (Bitplane, South
Windsor, CT) as reported previously [89]. In brief, the astrocyte soma and
processes were measured and reconstructed according to their own
parameter. Processes diameter was measured as one-tenth of astrocyte soma.
In addition, Ezrin was measured as 1 mm in every group. The surface–surface
colocalisation was calculated by a speciﬁc plugin of Imaris [40].

Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed by GraphPad Prism 8. All data were
expressed as means ± SEM of n observations, where n means the number
of animals in behavioural tests, or astrocyte cells from at least three
animals. All analysis was single-blind. Data with more than two groups
were tested for signiﬁcance using one-way ANOVA test followed by the
Holm–Sidak test. Multiple comparisons between the data were performed
in case of their non-normal distribution, using the Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA
on ranks, followed by Tukey’s test. A two-way ANOVA followed by Dunn’s
test was performed to compare data obtained in Figs. 2I, 3B, 6B.
Signiﬁcance was deﬁned as P < 0.05.
