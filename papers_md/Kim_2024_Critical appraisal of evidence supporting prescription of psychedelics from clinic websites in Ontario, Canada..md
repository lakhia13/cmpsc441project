Abstract

Psychedelics, including ketamine, 3,4-Methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA), and
psilocybin, have gained attention for their potential therapeutic role in mental health treat-
ment. While recreational use is prohibited in Canada, medicinal exemptions can be granted.
There are several psychedelic clinics in Ontario, Canada, promoting the use of psychedelics
for a variety of medical indications. Our objective was to identify the indications for which
psychedelics are being prescribed in Ontario clinics and assess the quality of evidence used
to support these claims. Internet searches were conducted using Google and Bing to identify
psychedelic clinics in Ontario. Inclusion criteria was as follow: clinics were physically located
in Ontario, had a functioning website link, and demonstrated involvement of a licensed phy-
sician or nurse practitioner. Identified clinics were evaluated for their claims of effectiveness,
the quality of evidence used to support these claims, and statements on psychedelic-related
harms. The cited studies were appraised for quality using Oxford Centre for Evidence-
Based Medicine Levels of Evidence, “level 5” being the lowest quality and “level 1” being the
highest quality. Out of 200 search results, 10 psychedelic clinic websites met our inclusion
criteria. These clinics advertised psychedelics for 47 medical conditions, most commonly for
depression. Only 2 out of 10 clinics described potential risks associated with psychedelic
use. There were 29 studies cited by these websites, majority coming from “level 4” evidence
consisting of case-series and case-control studies. Overall, the cited evidence quality was
low to moderate. Psychedelic clinics in Ontario promote a wide range of medical indications
for psychedelics using primarily low to moderate “level 4” evidence. There is limited informa-
tion shared on the potential adverse effects of psychedelics. Our study emphasizes the
importance of using transparent and high-quality evidence by clinics and clinicians to ensure
safe and effective use of psychedelics in mental health treatments.

Critical appraisal of evidence supporting prescription of psychedelics from clinic websites in Ontario, Canada

Introduction

Psychedelics are a class of compounds known for their psychoactive effects. They include sub-
stances such as ketamine, 3,4-Methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA), and psilocybin,
and have been explored for potential therapeutic applications in mental health treatments.
Ketamine is a dissociative drug that alters sensations and interrupts the pain signaling pathway
in the brain, mainly through its role as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
[1]. It is commonly prescribed and administered by health care professionals in hospital set-
tings for anesthesia and acute pain management [2]. MDMA stimulates serotonin and dopa-
mine pathways and can cause positive short-term effects on mood. Unlike ketamine, which is
commonly used in medicine, MDMA has no currently approved therapeutic indications and
is an illegal substance in most jurisdictions [3]. It is primarily used for recreational purposes.
Psilocybin is one of the active ingredients in “magic mushrooms’’ and acts as a hallucinogen,
altering emotions and senses. Psilocybin is also used recreationally for its psychological effects
[4]. Some individuals describe consuming these psychedelics routinely in very low doses,
known as microdosing, for perceived mental health benefits such as improvement in mood
and anxiety [5].

In Canada, these three substances are regulated under the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act, under which unauthorized production, sale, or possession is illegal [2–4]. Although recre-
ational psychedelic use in Canada is illegal under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,
exemptions for use can be granted by Health Canada for medicinal or scientific purposes. In
recent years, psychedelics have gained popularity as interventions for mental illnesses such as
depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and end-of-life suffering [6]. A 2021 CBC news
article reported patients’ experiences regarding how psychedelic-assisted therapy, a therapeutic
approach involving the use of psychedelics in conjunction with psychotherapy under the
supervision of a licensed professional, dramatically improved their quality of life [7]. Despite
the regulations set by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, stores selling psychedelic sub-
stances have opened around Ontario, allowing customers to walk-in and purchase psilocybin
without a prescription [7]. While technically illegal under Canada’s current legislative frame-
work, these shops remain open, with news reports describing that their inventories are periodi-
cally confiscated by police and that business resumes once the inventory is replenished [8,9].
With substantial attention on psychedelics and their potential therapeutic role, there has been
a rapid increase in investments in the psychedelic market with a growth rate in the United
States that is projected to exceed that of the cannabis market [10]. Financial investments in the
psychedelic industry have taken off in late 2010s and early 2020s, and companies aim to com-
mercialize therapeutic applications of psychedelics [11]. Efforts are made in many countries to
gain full federal regulatory approval of psychedelic medicine, highlighting the growing interest
in psychedelic-assisted therapy and the potential impact on future health policies [11]. With a
surge in popularity and accessibility, it becomes important to evaluate the evidence behind the
risks and efficacy.

Systematic reviews investigating the efficacy of ketamine, MDMA, and psilocybin for men-
tal health disorders have demonstrated some effectiveness, particularly for certain treatment-
resistant conditions [12–14]. One randomized control trial estimated that ketamine is compa-
rable in efficacy to electroconvulsive therapy for people with treatment-resistant major depres-
sion; participants in this study received two 40-minute ketamine infusions per week, for 3
weeks [15]. A randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trial showed MDMA-assisted therapy
reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in a diverse population and was well-tol-
erated [16]. In a double-blind, randomized, phase 3 clinical trial, MDMA was compared with
placebo for the treatment of severe PTSD, including those with common comorbid mental

health conditions [17]. The data indicated that MDMA-assisted integrative therapy sessions
are highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, reducing PTSD symptoms and func-
tional impairment with high safety and tolerability [17]. However, given the relative infancy of
structured clinical.

Research into these substances, more evidence is required to understand both short-term
and long-term effects of psychedelics [6]. Ketamine and MDMA are addictive substances that
can be prone to misuse, particularly if medicines are delivered in an unsafe and unsupervised
setting. Repeated exposure has been shown in animal models to cause neurotoxicity in the cen-
tral nervous system, although these studies generally use doses much greater than what is pro-
moted for human administration [18,19]. A survey of American psychiatrists’ attitudes
towards the use of psychedelics for therapeutic indications showed that despite recent litera-
ture highlighting therapeutic benefits of psychedelics, American psychiatrists appear appre-
hensive about the potential adverse effects associated with their use [20]. A modest majority
expressed doubts regarding the suitability of psychedelics for mental health treatments, even
in adjunction to psychotherapy [20]. There was an agreement among psychiatrists that further
research is required to evaluate the therapeutic potential of psychedelics [20]. Considering the
potential risks associated with these substances, it is essential to critically evaluate the informa-
tion available.

According to one anonymous survey of 1221 people, 62% of the participants used internet
websites as their main source of information about psychedelics, making internet webs sources
the second most common source of information about psychedelics after personal experimen-
tation [21]. Websites of clinics that promote psychedelics are an important source of informa-
tion about these substances. To assess the information available on psychedelic clinic websites,
we adapted a process used by previous comparable studies [22,23], and conducted a narrative
review of the evidence used on the psychedelic prescribers’ websites to support the claims of
psychedelic use for various therapeutic indications. Our objective was to identify the indica-
tions for which psychedelic medications are being prescribed in Ontario clinics and assess the
quality of evidence used to support these claims.

Methods

We conducted a narrative review of Ontario, Canada psychedelic clinic websites. We con-
ducted internet searches between July 11–31, 2023, using Google and Bing, the two search
engines with the greatest market share in North America to identify psychedelic clinics [24].
Searches were conducted using the keywords: psychedelic, clinic, and Ontario. These psyche-
delic clinics are privately owned, outpatient clinics in the community where anyone can inde-
pendently book an appointment without a physician referral. In situations where a parent
company owns or manages several psychedelic clinics, we first verified that a physical location
was present in Ontario before analyzing research evidence cited on the parent website. Our
searches were limited to the top 100 results each from Google and Bing (200 results in total),
which is an established approach for online searches of this type [25]. Inclusion criteria
involved clinics that were physically located within Ontario, had a functioning website link,
and demonstrated presence of a prescriber licensed in Ontario: either a physician licensed
with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario or a nurse practitioner who was
licensed with the College of Nurses of Ontario, which serve as regulatory bodies for profes-
sional practice.

Two trained reviewers (KK and AY) worked in parallel to screen the top 100 results from
each search engine against the inclusion criteria. Conflicting assessments were resolved by a
third reviewer (BO). Afterwards, both reviewers independently examined all pages of included

psychedelic clinic websites. We identified and documented any claims of effectiveness men-
tioned on the websites (e.g. “psychedelics help manage depression”) as well as the peer-
reviewed supporting evidence cited for these claims. We limited our critical appraisal to peer-
reviewed articles cited by these websites to focus on published research evidence used in sup-
port of these claims of effectiveness. The data and results were recorded in Google Sheets and
analyzed using descriptive statistics.

All evidence collected was evaluated for its quality using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-

Based Medicine (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence, an established framework used to assess the
quality of evidence [26]. Under this framework, systematic reviews are initially rated as the
highest level of evidence, “level 1”, with other studies ranked sequentially lower in quality. The
lowest level of evidence, “level 5”, is reserved for studies conducted using animal disease models
or mechanism-based reasoning. We classified studies using this approach and then ‘upgraded’
or ‘downgraded’ the level of evidence ascribed to each included study based on the OCEBM
Levels of Evidence guidance (for example, where a study was described as a ‘systematic review’
but we assessed it to be poor quality, we downgraded this to a lower level, rather than Level 1
which is the ‘initial’ level for systematic reviews; we also did this for all other study types). We
differentiated between reviews (non-appraisable) and systematic reviews (level 1) by analyzing
the methods section of the studies. It was categorized as review if the study summarized and
synthesized existing research on a particular topic without strict criteria for study selection. It
was categorized as a systematic review if the study employed a clear predetermined criterion to
search, select, appraise, and analyze relevant studies, with high replicability and reliability.
There are other approaches available for appraising the quality of evidence used to make recom-
mendations, such as the GRADE system, which is typically used to rate the quality of evidence
in systematic reviews and evidence syntheses [27]. Since our focus was on assessing the quality
of studies used on clinic websites to support their recommendations, we chose the OCEBM Lev-
els of Evidence system, which we believe was most appropriately aligned with our objectives.
Two reviewers (KK and AY) independently assessed the quality of evidence, and any dis-
crepancies were resolved via discussion with a third reviewer (BO). We reported the overall
quality of evidence and the quality of evidence specific to each indication. Furthermore, our
study included information on the total number of psychedelic clinics identified in Ontario,
total number of claims, proportion of evidence-supported claims, statements on psychedelic-
related harms, and any reported costs of therapy.

Ethics statement

This study did not collect or analyze any data from human subjects, and no human subjects
were enrolled. Ethical review and approval was not required, and no consent process was
collected.

Results
Overview of cited evidence from clinic website

We characterized the quality of cited evidence by evaluating whether each study had a clear
hypothesis, control group, power calculation, randomization, allocation concealment, inten-
tion to treat analysis, and blinding when applicable. Among the 29 studies that were refer-
enced, the largest group was randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (7/29, 24%), followed by
reviews (6/29, 21%) and systematic reviews (5/29, 17%) (Tables 1 and S1). For reviews and sys-
tematic reviews, criteria related to experimental design were not applicable as they synthesized
existing research. The review studies were not graded as the Oxford Centre for Evidence-
Based Medicine system does not include general reviews in their levels of evidence hierarchy.

None of the systematic reviews had a clear hypothesis, but 3 had a clear objective, with explicit
study selection criteria. The RCTs included a total of 447 participants, with the participant num-
bers ranging from 18 to 158 (median = 54, IQR = 26.5–82). 4 out of 7 (57%) studies had clearly
stated hypotheses and all 7 (100%) had control groups and randomization. 4 studies (57%) com-
pleted a power calculation, and likewise, 4 (57%) employed an intent-to-treat analysis. All 7
(100%) RCTs had double blinding, while 4 (57%) trials used allocation concealment. Three
RCTs (3/7, 43%) stated that blinding was difficult due to lack of ketamine effects in placebo
groups, potentially resulting in biased patient reporting. Two (2/7, 29%) RCTs stated that if par-
ticipants did not respond to double-blind or discontinued the study early due to lack of efficacy,
they were administered open label standard ketamine dose. One RCT (1/7, 14%) stated that by
the last infusion, 50% of ketamine cases guessed correctly about their assigned treatment.

There were 4 case series/ reports (14%), with a total of 195 participants and study sample
sizes between 18 to 108 (median = 34.5, IQR = 19.5–64). None of the studies explicitly stated a
hypothesis, and none conducted a power calculation. Only 1 out of 4 case series (25%) per-
formed an intent-to-treat analysis. Criteria such as control groups or blinding were not appli-
cable as they did not have comparison groups.

Out of 29 studies included in our analysis, 2 surveys (7%) were cited, with 321 and 886 par-

ticipants respectively. They involved self-reports of the participants’ experience, at various
time points before and after psychedelic use. One of the surveys (50%) had a clear hypothesis
and neither of them (0%) completed a power calculation. Two out of 29 references (7%) were
cross-sectional studies, with sample sizes of 235 and 9016. These cross-sectional studies
involved observational data collection to assess associations among variables at a single point
in time, and unlike surveys, did not include patient self-report. Neither of these studies had a
clear hypothesis or a power calculation. Lastly, 2 editorials (7%) and 1 non-randomized clinical
trial (3.5%) were cited by psychedelic clinic websites. The clinical trial study tested the safety
and efficacy of repeated-dose IV ketamine for acute treatment of treatment resistant depres-
sion (TRD). The clinical trial involved 10 participants and performed an intent-to-treat analy-
sis. The clinical trial study design did not include control group, power calculation,
randomization, allocation concealment, nor blinding.

All analyzed studies enrolled adult participants who were 18 years or older; none included
participants under 18 years of age. Of the 16 studies assessed that included human participants
and reported sample sizes (n = 16), there were in total 11,110 participants (median = 61,
IQR = 22–177).

Results overview of identified clinic websites

Out of 200 search results, we identified a total of 31 potentially eligible psychedelic clinic web-
sites in Ontario. 21 websites were excluded for following reasons: 9 websites (43%) did not

have any licensed physician or nurse practitioner involvement; 5 websites (24%) did not have a
physical clinic located in Ontario; 2 websites (9.5%) did not state that they prescribed psyche-
delics; 3 (14%) were invalid links that directed to another website; and 2 websites (9.5%) were
non-functional links (Fig 1).

Out of the 10 clinics that met our inclusion criteria, psychedelics were advertised for 47
unique medical conditions (Fig 2). The most frequently reported condition was depression or
major depressive disorder (n = 8, 17%). Other indications include post-traumatic stress disor-
der (n = 7, 15%), anxiety (n = 6, 13%), chronic pain (n = 3, 6%), trauma (n = 3, 6%), substance
use disorder (n = 3, 6%), obsessive compulsive disorder (n = 3, 6%), and bipolar disorder
(n = 3, 6%). Only 2 out of 10 clinics (20%) described the potential risks and harms associated

with psychedelic use. The potential side effects outlined on these websites ranged from milder
symptoms such as nausea, elevated heart rate or blood pressure, and dizziness, to more severe
symptoms such as cognitive dissociation, changes in liver or kidney function, or blood in
urine. Nine out of 10 psychedelic clinics offered concurrent psychotherapy. The one clinic that
did not offer psychotherapy promoted ketamine as an alternative physical pain treatment.

Here
33 different studies were referenced in these clinic’s websites to support their claims. 4 cited

studies were not analyzed for their quality of evidence because 3 were non-peer reviewed
sources such as internet websites or newsletters and 1 was retracted from publication (Fig 1).
The remaining 29 studies investigated the outcome of psychedelics for a variety of indications
(n = 48) such as depression/ major depressive disorder (n = 10, 21%), TRD (n = 10, 21%),
post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 6, 13%), anxiety (n = 4, 8%), substance use disorder (n = 4,
8%), and bipolar disorder (n = 4, 8%) (Table 2).

Evaluations of the quality of evidence

Among the 29 studies included in our analysis, the majority was lower quality “level 4” evi-
dence (Table 3). The medical indications explored in the cited studies were matched to the 5
levels of evidence (Fig 3). Specific types of psychedelics were matched to its corresponding
study level (Fig 4). Most included studies reported using ketamine and were level 4 studies.

Psychedelic types and route of administration

Overall, 25 studies (86%) utilized ketamine alone; 1 study (3%) used psilocybin alone; 2 studies
(7%) used a combination of psychedelics such as ketamine, psilocybin, 3,4-Methylenedioxy
methamphetamine (MDMA), and Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); and 1 study (3%) did not
specify the type of psychedelic used (Table 4).

Regarding the route of administration, 14 studies (48%) examined intravenous infusions; 1

study (3%) examined intravenous injection; 1 study (3%) examined oral administration; 1
study (3%) examined sublingual administration; 1 study (3%) examined intranasal administra-
tion; 1 study (3%) examined sublingual and/or intramuscular administration; and 10 studies
(35%) did not specify the route of administration used in their study (Table 5).

Costs

The costs of obtaining psychedelic medicines, most of which incorporated some ‘therapy’ such
as psychotherapy in addition to the medicine itself, varied among the 10 clinics included in
our analysis. Only the clinics that used ketamine for psychedelic therapy provided cost break-
downs. Five clinics (50%) did not provide a pricing estimate on their website; those that did
charged anywhere between $200–1000 CAD per individual treatment. The clinics suggested
that a patient may need anywhere from 4–8 treatments/sessions. Two clinics offered packages,
starting at $5920 CAD for 6 sessions of psychedelic exploration or $9255 CAD for 2 sessions
with a therapist in addition to 9 sessions of psychedelic exploration. No clinics specified the
durability of therapeutic effect and how often these sessions are required. One clinic stated
that the psychedelic-assisted therapy will have “long lasting” effects but did not specify further.

Discussion
Principal findings

Our narrative review of Ontario psychedelic clinic websites established that most evidence
supporting psychedelic prescription is low to moderate quality. The largest proportion of

top 3. However, within the top 3, cited studies included treatment-resistant depression (TRD)
whereas the psychedelic clinics promoted psychedelic use for anxiety.

The reliance on case series or small case-control studies on these websites to promote psy-
chedelics for several different indications raises questions about the credibility of these claims.

conditions [12–14], experts have been concerned about the conflict of interest in psychedelic
research and the lack of transparency with information sharing with the rise of entrepreneurial
interest in this potentially lucrative market [28]. High profile entrepreneurs and corporations
have invested significant resources to fund psychedelic research [29]. Many researchers and
clinicians are employed as advisors for psychedelic clinics and companies [30]. Interests from
large corporations in the psychedelic market in addition to the involvement of researchers in
private psychedelic companies should be considered when interpreting the quality of evidence
supporting the efficacy of psychedelics for various medical indications. Given that a large,
anonymous, online survey has shown that internet websites are the second most common
source of information for psychedelics for the public [21], it is important that psychedelic
clinic websites use high quality evidence to support their claims. It is integral to explore how
knowledgeable providers affiliated with these clinics are on the topic of psychedelic-assisted
therapies. An anonymous survey exploring American psychiatrists’ attitudes towards psyche-
delic-assisted therapies showed that there were limitations in psychedelic knowledge [31]. Psy-
chiatrists desired to learn more about psychedelic-assisted therapies, especially surrounding
adverse effects, highlighting the lack of knowledge in this field [31]. Clinicians associated with
these clinics have the duty to use appropriate evidence to support their decision making and
therapeutic options that are made available to the public.

Most clinics included in our study did not mention potential adverse effects associated with

psychedelic use. Although there are studies exploring the relationships between cognitive

impairments and prolonged psychedelic use [32–34], these studies tend to be lower quality evi-
dence or may not be clinically translatable or relevant. Historical psychomimetic view, rooted
in mid-20th century, framed psychedelic experiences as mimicking psychosis, where the effects
of psychedelics were interpreted as insanity or psychotic [35]. In contrast, psychotherapeutic
view described psychedelic experiences as mind and spiritual awakening, useful in resolving
mental issues in therapeutic settings [35]. Given the potential resemblance between spiritual
awakening and psychosis, highly specialized assessment and support is required. It is unclear
whether these clinics are equipped with the expertise to identify and manage such significant
events should they arise. Collectively, these issues point to the need for more research to better
understand the risks and benefits associated with short and long-term psychedelic usage for
mental health treatments.

Nine out of ten clinics included in our study offered concurrent psychotherapy, though it
remains unclear whether these psychotherapeutic offerings are consistent with the standard
therapeutic model published in literature. Standard model generally includes two clinicians
per patients, where clinicians have extensive professional experience and training with the
effects of psychedelic compound [36]. The clinical team spends a considerable amount of time
with patients, approximately 35–40 hours [36]. The “set and setting” play a significant role in
shaping the process and outcomes of psychedelic experience. The term “set” encompasses psy-
chological factors such as mood and intentions, while “setting” involves environmental factors
such as social and cultural space [35]. Recognizing the importance of these influences, thera-
peutic alliance and rapport have been described as determinants of efficacy and safety of men-
tal health treatment with psychedelic medicines [36]. A literature review of trials found that
adverse events such as mania can be precipitated in patients with bipolar disorder when using
psychedelics [37], emphasizing the necessity of well-trained practitioners, and appropriate
“set” and “setting” to address these potential adverse effects if they arise. To optimize psyche-
delic medicine, a structured process of preparation and support during the experience, and
integration afterwards is recommended. These steps help shape the mindset and environment
of patients for these sessions and provoke reflection afterwards [38]. Clinicians play a crucial
role in the safety and efficacy of psychedelic medicine, but clinics do not provide information
about the level of training of their practitioners. There are several psychedelic therapy training
programs emerging in the space, some funded by industry while others affiliated with aca-
demic centres. Guidelines for the practice and certification of psychedelic assisted therapy are
needed to support safe and effective use of these substances.

Psychedelic clinics in this study emphasized depression as the leading indication for psy-
chedelic use, while only one clinic promoted their application for TRD. This contrasts with the
indications highlighted in cited studies, where depression and TRD were both top indications.
There are several treatments available for depression, ranging from psychotherapies to phar-
macological therapies [39]. TRD lacks a universally accepted definition, but it is commonly
defined as failure to respond to at least two trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy of ade-
quate dose and duration [40,41]. Although there is overlap in some non-biological and phar-
macological treatments of depression and TRD, there are treatments unique to TRD such as
somatic or brain stimulation therapies [40]. Furthermore, dosage and duration of these treat-
ments may differ between the two conditions. As a result, some clinics that have claimed indi-
cations for depression may rely on evidence primarily related to TRD, which can lead to
discrepancies between claimed indications and evidence provided.

Some clinics stated that their services are not covered by Ontario Health Insurance Plan
(OHIP), requiring patients to self-fund the expenses. This may result in disparities with access
to these treatments. A systematic review has found that there is an association between income
inequality and poor mental health [42]. If psychedelic assisted psychotherapy gains wider

acceptance and becomes a mainstream component of mental health treatment in Canada,
careful consideration is needed regarding whether public coverage is warranted based on
safety, efficacy, and efficiency of psychedelic medicine. Considering various social determi-
nants of health and existing health inequities is important to ensure equitable access and out-
comes for diverse populations.

Limitations

We focused exclusively on psychedelic clinics in Ontario, Canada. Although Ontario encom-
passes 40% of Canada’s population, different provinces may have varying prevalence, policies,
and regulations surrounding medicinal psychedelics [43]. We did not independently contact
clinics to determine whether a licensed physician or nurse practitioner was involved. Instead,
we evaluated whether a psychedelic clinic claimed physician or nurse practitioner involvement
on their website as our inclusion criteria. During our assessment, it was observed that many
clinics did not specify the name of physician or nurse practitioner involved. Our study used
the search terms psychedelic, clinics, and Ontario to identify relevant clinics. This search strat-
egy may have missed clinics that used the specific name of psychedelic, rather than the broad
term psychedelic, to advertise their products.

Conclusion

Psychedelic clinics promote the use of psychedelics for a variety of medical indications using
low to moderate quality evidence that are not restricted to peer-reviewed evidence to support
their claims. Most clinics omit information regarding their models of care, training of their
providers, and the potential negative effects of psychedelics, especially regarding harms associ-
ated with spiritual emergence and prolonged usage. Given the high costs of psychedelic assis-
ted therapy and the complex relationship between research and private funding, it is integral
to have clear, high-quality evidence widely available to the public and for clinicians and clinics
to use appropriate information when communicating with the public.
