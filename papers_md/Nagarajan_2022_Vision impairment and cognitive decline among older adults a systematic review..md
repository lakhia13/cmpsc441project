ABSTRACT
Objectives  There has been increasing epidemiological 
research examining the association between vision 
impairment (VI) and cognitive impairment and how poor 
vision may be a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. 
The objective of this systematic review is to synthesise the 
published literature on the association of VI with cognitive 
decline, cognitive impairment or dementia, to aid the 
development of interventions and guide public policies 
pertaining to the relationship between vision and cognition.
Methods  A literature search was performed with Embase, 
Medline and Cochrane library databases from inception to 
March 2020, and included abstracts and articles published 
in peer- reviewed journals in English. Our inclusion criteria 
included publications that contained subjective/objective 
measures of vision and cognition, or a diagnosis of VI, 
cognitive impairment or dementia. Longitudinal or cross- 
sectional studies with ≥100 participants aged >50 years 
were included. The search identified 11 805 articles 
whose abstracts underwent screening by three teams of 
study authors. Data abstraction and quality assessment 
using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality 
Assessment Tool were performed by one author (NN). 10% 
of the articles underwent abstraction and appraisal by a 
second author (LA/VV), results were compared between 
both and were in agreement.
Results  110 full- text articles were selected for data 
extraction, of which 53 were cross- sectional, 43 
longitudinal and 14 were case–control studies. The mean 
age of participants was 73.0 years (range 50–93.1). 
Ninety- one (83%) of these studies reported that VI was 
associated with cognitive impairment.
Conclusion  Our systematic review indicates that a 
majority of studies examining the vision–cognition 
relationship report that VI is associated with more cognitive 
decline, cognitive impairment or dementia among older 
adults. This synthesis supports the need for additional 
research to understand the mechanisms underlying the 
association between VI and cognitive impairment and to 
test interventions that mitigate the cognitive consequences 
of VI.

INTRODUCTION
Dementia is among the most pressing public 
health  challenges  of  the  21st  century.1  In 
2015,  46.8  million  people  were  living  with 
dementia,  and  the  number  is  expected  to 

Strengths and limitations of this study

 ► There  was  heterogeneity  in  the  measurement  of 
cognitive  and  visual  function  among  all  included 
studies.

 ► The  quality  assessment  tool  used  for  assessing 
quality  of  included  studies  penalised  longitudinal 
studies  that  lost  over  40%  of  participants  due  to 
drop- outs/withdrawals, which is common in studies 
that span over many years.

 ► Majority  of  the 

included  studies  were  cross- 

sectional, and these are prone to selection bias.

double  every  20  years.2  Vision  impairment 
(VI),  another  major  global  health  problem, 
affects at least 2.2 billion people worldwide,3 
most of whom are aged 50 years and older.4 
Both cognitive and VI are projected to affect 
an  increasing  number  of  people  over  time, 
primarily due to population ageing.4 5

Prior  work  has  suggested  that  cognition 
and  vision  are  associated,6  7  and  while  there 
are  shared  risk  factors  (neuropathological/
vascular),8 there is also longitudinal evidence 
that VI is associated with cognitive changes.9 
The  mechanisms  underlying 
the  vision- 
cognition  relationship  have  not  yet  been 
fully characterised, but it is hypothesised that 
sensory loss, such as hearing impairment and 
VI, may lead to increased cognitive load, struc-
tural and functional changes in the brain, and 
decreased emotional and social well- being, all 
of which could potentially increase the risk of 
cognitive  impairment.9  10  While  the  role  of 
treating hearing loss in preventing cognitive 
impairment  has  been  acknowledged,  VI  has 
not yet been recognised as a potentially modi-
fiable risk factor for cognitive impairment.1 11
Since  the  majority  of  VI  is  due  to  correct-
able  conditions,  namely  refractive  error  and 
cataract,12  establishing  the  existence  of  an 
association  between  vision  and  cognitive 
impairment  could  present  an  additional 
opportunity to prevent cognitive impairment

and dementia through interventions that optimise vision. 
In  this  systematic  review  of  the  literature,  we  examined 
the association between cognitive and vision impairment 
among  older  adults  in  existing  observational  studies. 
This qualitative review summarises the existing research 
examining  the  vision–cognition  relationship,  providing 
insight  on  data  gaps  and  areas  for  continued  investiga-
tion,  as  well  as  highlighting  differences  in  methodolog-
ical  approaches  that  may  impact  the  interpretation  of 
results across studies.

METHODS/LITERATURE SEARCH
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (online 
esupplemental file 1).

Cross- sectional  and  longitudinal  studies  reporting  a 
measure of association between visual function and cogni-
tive  impairment  were  included  if  they  had  ≥100  partici-
pants aged of ≥50 years (mean) at baseline. Reasons for 
exclusion of studies were: (1) Outcome measure was not 
vision  or  cognition,  (2)  Association  between  vision  and 
cognition  was  not  explored,  (3)  Sample  size  <100,  (4) 
Publication not in English, (5) Mean age <50 years, (6) 
No  cognitive  measure,  (7)  No  vision  measure  and  (8) 
Outcome was not part of inclusion criteria.

An academic librarian searched: Ovid Medline, Embase, 
Cochrane  and  PubMed  from  their  inception  to  March 
2020,  and  developed  a  search  strategy  that  combined 
controlled  vocabulary  and  keywords  related  to  geriat-
rics,  cognition  and  vision  (online  esupplemental  file 
2- complete Ovid Medline search strategy). Searches were 
limited  to  human  studies  published  in  English.  Confer-
ence  and  poster  abstracts,  and  short  oral  presentations 
were also included.

Search  results  were  exported  to  Covidence  (Veritas 
Health  Innovation,  Melbourne,  Australia).  Three  teams 
of  two  reviewers  each  worked  independently  and  in 
duplicate  to  screen  titles,  abstracts  and  full- text  articles 
to determine inclusion (NN and MM; EC and YS; VV and 
LA). Disagreements were adjudicated by a member of the 
other study team.

Data were extracted from the included publications by 
one author (NN), and another (LA) extracted data from 
a random sample of 10% to compare results. Any discrep-
ancies  were  adjudicated  by  a  third  author  (VV).  Data 
collected  for  each  publication  included:  study  design, 
participant  characteristics,  vision  and  cognition  assess-
ment methods and the summary measure that described 
the vision–cognition association.

The  methodological  quality  of 

included  studies 
was  assessed  by  one  author  (NN)  using  the  Effective 
Public  Health  Practice  Project  Quality  Assessment  Tool 
(EPHPP)13  and  the  global  quality  ratings  and  findings 
were summarised qualitatively. A random 10% sample was 
reviewed by another author (VV) to ascertain consistency 
in quality assessment (QA).

RESULTS
Study Selection
Online esupplemental file 3 is a PRISMA flow chart that 
describes  the  results  of  the  search  strategy  of  articles 
that examined the association between VI and cognitive 
impairment  or  decline.  Of  the  11  805  studies  that  were 
imported for screening, 110 articles were included in our 
final systematic review.7 14–122

Description of included studies
Table  1  describes  the  characteristics  of  the  studies 
included. The total number of participants in this review 
was  9  799  329  (range:  112–7  210  535  per  study),  with  a 
mean age of 73.0 years, (range: 50.0–93.1). Of the total 
110  studies  included,  53  were  cross- sectional,  43  were 
longitudinal and 14 had a case–control study design. The 
range of follow- up time for the longitudinal studies was 2 
months to 10 years.

Of the 110 studies included, 51 reported findings from 
participants enrolled in population- based studies. There 
were five studies each from the following large population

based longitudinal studies: English Longitudinal Study of 
Aging  (ELSA)  and  The  Three- City  Study.  Three  studies 
each  from  Fujiwara- Kyo  Study,  Salisbury  Eye  Evaluation 
Study, Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging and Singapore 
Epidemiology  of  Eye  Diseases.  Two  studies  each  came 
from  The  Newcastle  85+  study,  Study  of  Osteoporotic 
Fractures,  Blue  Mountain  Eye  Study,  Australian  Longi-
tudinal  Study  on  Aging,  Health  and  Retirement  Study, 
National  Health  and  Aging  Trends  Study  (NHATS), 
Leiden  85+  study,  Health  ABC  study  and  the  Singapore 
Malay Eye Study. Additionally, 10 studies used insurance 
claims data from different countries.

The  studies  in  this  review  included  participants  from 
over  17  different  countries  (table  1),  30  studies  (27%) 
from the USA, followed by 25 studies from Europe (23%) 
including  the  UK,  Germany,  Ireland,  Finland,  Switzer-
land, France and Netherlands. Ninety of the studies were 
published  between  2009  and  2020.  All  papers  provided 
a  description  of  sampling  methods.  16  studies  were 
included which were either conference abstracts or short 
oral presentations.24 32 45 49–51 53 56 92 93 96 112–116

Assessment of cognitive function
To  assess  cognitive  function,  89  studies  used  objective 
assessments,  13  used  other  assessment  methods  such

as  self- report  and  diagnosis  codes,  and  7  studies  used  a 
combination of both (table 2); one study did not provide 
function  assessment.92 
information  about  cognitive 
Mini- Mental  State  Examination  (MMSE)  was  the  most 
commonly  used  objective  method  to  assess  cognitive 
function  (42  studies).  Other  methods  used  to  objec-
tively  measure  cognition  included:  Montreal- Cognitive 
Assessment  test,28  32  34  53  93  Addenbrooke’s  Cognitive 
Examination- Revised,45  61  79  Cognitive  Performance 
Scale,42  49  65  Blessed- Orientation- Memory- Concentration

Dementia  Scale,86  Digit  Symbol  Substitution  Test  22  122 
and  Cambridge  Cognitive  Examination  test.88  For  the 
studies  that  used  other  assessment  methods,  four  used 
self- reported cognitive measures,18 22 39 105 and nine used 
diagnostic  codes  to  define  cognitive  decline  and/or 
dementia.19–21 51 69 99 103 115 117 Among the studies that used 
a combination of objective and subjective methods, four 
used self- reported cognitive function along with an objec-
tive measure.22 30 48 55

Assessment of visual function
In order to assess visual function, 66 studies used objec-
tive assessments, 34 used other assessment methods such 
as  self- report  and  diagnosis  codes,  and  8  studies  used  a 
combination of both (table 2); no information was avail-
able  from  two  studies.24  116  Visual  acuity  (VA)  was  the 
most commonly measured visual function (42 studies), of 
which  the  Snellen  acuity  chart  was  the  most  commonly 
used method (18 studies). VA was also measured in combi-
nation with other visual functions, including: visual fields 
(VF) (six studies),20 51 70 90 102 118 contrast sensitivity (CS) 
(eight studies),29 52 86 93 94 102 118 122 macular pigment optical 
density  (two  studies)14  34  and  fundus  photography  (two 
studies).63 118 Other methods used to objectively measure 
visual  functions  included:  colour  vision,17  VF  only,28  CS 
only,35 76 fundus photo with grading38 100 and autorefrac-
tion.74 Other assessment methods included: self- reported 
vision  (24  studies)  and  diagnostic  codes  or  patient 
records to define VI (10 studies).19 21 46 69 83 99 104 115 117 121 
The  studies  that  used  a  combination  of  methods,  eight 
studies used self- report along with an objective measure 
of visual function.22 40 53 59 68 71 107 113

Quality of studies
The  methodological  quality  of  included  studies  was 
assessed using the EPHPP.13 The tool assessed each study 
on five domains: (1) Selection bias, (2) Study design, (3) 
Confounders, (4) Data collection methods and (5) Anal-
ysis.  For  each  included  study  the  five  relevant  domains 
were ranked on a three- point Likert scale with three repre-
senting a low risk of bias (‘strong’), two a possible risk of 
bias  (‘moderate’)  and  one  a  high  risk  of  bias  (‘weak’). 
An overall rating was derived following the EPHPP meth-
odology. A study consisting of at least one  ‘weak’ rating 
in  a  domain  received  an  overall  rating  of  ‘moderate,’ 
while those with two or more domains with ‘weak’ ratings 
were automatically classified as ‘weak’ overall. We present

our studies in three different tables which is categorised 
based on the overall ratings, with ‘strong’, ‘moderate’ and 
‘weak’ studies in tables 3–5, respectively. In our sample, 
17  studies  received  a  rating  of  strong,  70  moderate  and 
23 weak.

Study findings
Of  the  110  studies  included  (tables  3–5),  91  found  a 
significant positive association between VI and cognitive 
decline, cognitive impairment or dementia, and 13 studies 
found no significant association.26 30 43 44 60 61 68 81 82 90 94 115 117 
There were six studies that were inconclusive.23 37 67 70 79 83 
Of the 91 studies that found a significant association, 77 
used  objective  methods  to  assess  their  vision  or  cogni-
tive outcome. Of the 43 longitudinal studies, 35 found a 
significant association between VI and cognitive decline, 
cognitive impairment or dementia. The most commonly 
presented  statistical  measures  were  ORs  and  HRs.  The 
random  10%  of  the  study  sample  that  was  separately 
extracted  by  an  independent  author  (LA)  was  found  to 
be similar to elements from the primary extraction.

DISCUSSION
In  this  systematic  review,  we  evaluated  and  synthesised 
the literature examining the association between VI and 
cognitive function among older adults, and found strong 
agreement  that  VI  is  associated  with  cognitive  impair-
ment,  cognitive  decline  or  dementia.  Results  from  the 
longitudinal  studies  that  found  a  positive  association 
between  vision  and  cognition  supports  our  hypothesis 
that  VI  may  be  a  risk  factor  for  cognitive  impairment, 
cognitive decline or dementia.

Ninety- one  studies  reported  associations  between 
decline  in  visual  and  cognitive  functions.  Garin  et  al,40 
who received a ‘moderate’ rating in the QA, performed 
a  cross- sectional  analysis  in  a  representative  sample  of 
Spanish population and measured cognition objectively. 
They also measured distance and near vision and found 
that  objective  and  subjectively  measured  poor  distance 
and  near  VA  were  associated  with  worse  cognitive  func-
tioning.  Lin  et  al47  used  data  from  a  large  longitudinal 
cohort  study  of  older  women  and  found  that  VI  was 
associated with greater odds of cognitive and functional 
decline over 2 years. This study used objective measures 
of assessment for both vision and cognition and received 
a ‘strong’ rating in the bias assessment. Luo et al,48 who 
received  a  ‘moderate’  rating  in  QA,  performed  a  cross- 
sectional  analysis  on  a  large  population  sample  from 
China. They reported that those with VI and Dual Sensory 
Impairment  (DSI)  were  more  likely  to  have  severe  to 
extremely severe dementia compared with those without 
any sensory impairment. Another longitudinal study that 
received  a  ‘moderate’  rating  in  QA  from  Germany  by 
Hajek  et  al58  with  a  large  sample  size  (n=2394)  showed 
that the onset of severe VI was associated with a decline in 
cognitive function scores. Uhlmann et al64 in their paired 
case–control  study  between  VI  and  dementia  patients

concluded that VI was associated with both an increased 
risk  and  an  increased  clinical  severity  of  AD.  Although 
Frost et al38 found a strong association between early age- 
related  macular  degeneration  and  AD,  their  study  was 
cross- sectional, and the sample size was too low to derive 
an  inference.  Both  these  studies  received  ‘moderate’ 
rating in QA. Davies- Kershaw et al95 in their longitudinal 
analysis using the ELSA wave 2 and wave 7 data found that 
individuals in the younger group (50–69 years) and with 
moderate and poor self- rated vision were at greater risk 
of developing dementia than those with normal self- rated 
vision. Hamedani et al99 used Medicare claims data from 
2014  consisting  of  472  871  participants  and  concluded 
that  blindness/low  vision  was  associated  with  a  greater 
odd of Alzheimer’s disease and all- cause dementia. Both 
these studies also received ‘moderate’ rating in QA. Soto- 
Perez- de- Celis  et  al62  in  their  cross- sectional  study  case–
control study found that DSI was significantly associated 
with possible CI. However, the study received an overall 
‘weak’ rating in QA.

Of  the  91  studies  that  found  an  association  between 
VI and cognitive function, 35 were longitudinal, 46 were 
cross- sectional and 10 were case–control studies. Of the 13 
studies that found no association between VI and cogni-
tive function, 6 were longitudinal, 5 were cross- sectional 
and  2  were  case–control  studies.  Ihle  et  al60  performed 
a  cross- sectional  analysis  using  a  sample  of  2812  partici-
pants from Switzerland. They objectively measured cogni-
tion  and  vision  and  concluded  that  their  data  did  not 
support  an  increased  relation  of  cognitive  and  sensory 
abilities  in  old  age.  This  study  received  a  ‘weak’  rating 
in  QA.  Hong  et  al82  used  data  from  Blue  Mountain  Eye 
Study,  a  longitudinal  study  from  Australia  that  studied 
associations  between  VI  and  a  decline  in  MMSE  scores 
over a duration of 10 years. The study concluded that VI 
was not associated with cognitive decline over 5 years or 
10 years. Although the study included a large number of 
participants overall (n=2334), only 152 individuals with VI 
were included in this analysis, suggesting that there may 
have been survival bias. Brenowitz et al94 in their longitu-
dinal study using the Health ABC data concluded that VA 
and  CS  independently  were  not  significantly  associated 
with  incident  dementia.  However,  Swenor  et  al122  used 
data from the same study and found that impaired VA, CS 
and stereo acuity had a greater risk of incident cognitive 
impairment. This could be due to the different outcome 
measures assessed, that is, dementia94 vs cognitive impair-
ment.122 These three studies received a ‘moderate’ rating 
in QA. Michalowsky et al,117 who received a ‘strong’ rating 
in  their  case–control  study  concluded  that  VI  was  not 
significantly associated with dementia, a combination of 
both  visual  and  hearing  impairments  was  significantly 
associated with the risk of dementia.

There was considerable heterogeneity in the measure-
ment  and  reporting  of  cognitive  function.  Studies 
measured  cognitive  function  using  a  variety  of  instru-
ments with the most common being MMSE. The MMSE is 
a paper‐based test with a maximum score of 30, with lower

scores  indicating  more  severe  cognitive  impairment.  A 
score of 24 is often used as a threshold to define ‘normal’ 
cognitive  function.123  The  MMSE  has  been  found  to  be 
a valid and reliable tool as assesses by many studies.123 124 
Several studies used self- report, diagnosis codes and data 
from  existing  records  to  define  cognitive  status.  Simi-
larly, visual function was also assessed by various methods 
including  self- report.  While  VA  was  assessed  most 
commonly,  there  was  significant  variation  in  the  charts 
and tools used to assess it. The parameters used to define 
cognitive decline and VI may have impacted results across 
and within studies.

Our systematic review has found that there is a strong 
consensus in the literature that VI is associated with cogni-
tive  decline,  cognitive  impairment  or  dementia.  Two 
hypotheses  may  help  explain  this  association.  The  first 
one is that a common pathological process (eg, vascular 
disease)  might  be  responsible  for  both  the  sensory  and 
cognitive impairment in older adults. The second one is 
that  by  increasing  cognitive  load,  sensory  impairments 
such  as  VI  might  cause  cognitive  impairment.125  Litera-
ture also suggests that vision rehabilitation in the form of 
cataract  surgery  slows  the  rate  of  cognitive  decline,  and 
therefore,  early  vision  interventions  could  potentially 
reduce risk of dementia.126

Our  review  evaluated  bias  for  all  of  the  110  included 
studies.  The  majority  of  studies  included  in  our  review 
were cross- sectional, and according to EPHPP guidelines, 
cross- sectional studies can only receive a low or moderate 
rating in the bias assessment. Cross- sectional studies are 
also prone to selection bias, thus yielding estimates that 
may not reflect true associations in the target population. 
Studies  receiving  a  strong  rating  were  all  longitudinal. 
However, the tool penalises longitudinal studies that lose 
>40% of participants due to dropouts/withdrawals. This 
may,  perhaps  unfairly,  affect  longer  longitudinal  studies 
to a greater extent since they collect data over many years 
and can have more drop- outs due to deaths since they are 
conducted among older adults.

This review has several important implications. First, it 
highlights  the  need  for  standardised  methods  to  assess 
and  define  both  visual  and  cognitive  function  that  will 
aid  future  research  on  these  emerging  public  health 
issues. Second, it brings into focus the consistent associa-
tion of VI with cognitive impairment in older adults and 
the  need  to  better  understand  the  mechanisms  under-
lying this relationship. Third, as the longitudinal results 
support the sensory consequence theory, and suggest that 
VI may be a risk factor for cognitive decline, this points 
to a need for formulating preventive measures and vision 
rehabilitation  models,  such  as  prescription  glasses,  cata-
ract surgery, low vision rehabilitation, etc, that could have 
the potential to improve overall health and well- being of 
older adults.

Limitations
Given  the  large  number  of  studies  included  in  this 
review and the heterogeneity of measures used to assess

the  outcome,  it  was  not  possible  to  compare  and  meta- 
analyse  results  across  studies.  Although  35  longitudinal 
studies found a positive association between VI and cogni-
tive  decline,  we  cannot  establish  temporality  between 
this  relationship  due  to  the  heterogeneous  nature  of 
the  studies.  The  studies  included  diverse  populations, 
with  different  disease  processes,  and  variation  in  defini-
tions  of  both  cognitive  and  VI.  There  is  also  potential 
bias associated with studies that used different protocols 
for  cognitive  and  sensory  measurements.  The  MMSE, 
which was the most commonly used assessment method 
for testing cognition is sensory dependent and therefore 
one can argue that the results may be confounded with 
VI.127 Further studies should examine the impact of using 
vision  independent  cognitive  tests  on  the  vision–cogni-
tion relationship. Our review examined all cause VI and 
dementia,  and  further  study  is  needed  to  examine  the 
vision–cognition relationship by dementia subtype and by 
different vision pathology. However, despite the heteroge-
neity in studies and assessment methods, we synthesised 
the  evidence  qualitatively  and  by  taking  into  account 
study  quality  assessed  using  a  validated  tool.  While  our 
search strategy was robust, it may have been limited by the 
exclusion of studies that were not published in English.

CONCLUSION
The  number  of  older  adults  with  VI  and  dementia  is 
increasing globally, and therefore, the elucidation of the 
relationship between vision and cognition is of particular 
public  health  importance.  This  systematic  review  found 
that the positive association of VI with cognitive decline, 
cognitive  impairment  or  dementia  is  largely  consistent 
across  studies  using  different  measures  of  vision  and 
cognition,  as  well  as  between  countries  and  cohorts. 
This  overall  agreement  in  the  literature  suggests  that 
poor  visual  and  cognitive  function  are  associated,  and 
that additional research is now needed to move beyond 
documenting these associations. The focus of this area of 
research should now turn to identifying the factors and 
strategies that mediate the vision–cognition relationship 
and  identifying  potential  interventions,  such  as  vision 
rehabilitation  models  and  strategies  tailored  to  people 
with  VI,  that  may  mitigate  the  cognitive  implications  of 
VI.
