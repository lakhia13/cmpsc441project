Abstract: Background and Objectives: Migraine headaches are chronic neurological diseases that reduce
the quality of life by causing severe headaches and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, such as
facial ﬂushing, nasal stufﬁness, and sweating. Their major treatment methods include medication and
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT has been used for pain treatment and various psychogenic
neurological diseases by reducing pain, disability, and emotional disorders caused by symptoms
of mental illness and improving the understanding of mental health. This study aimed to evaluate
the effectiveness and safety of CBT in treating migraines. Materials and Methods: Seven electronic
databases were searched from the date of inception to December 2020. Randomized controlled
studies (RCTs) using CBT as an intervention for migraine were included. The primary outcome of this
study was to determine the frequency of migraines and the intensity of migraines on Visual Analog
Scale (VAS), the frequency of drug use, Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), and Headache
Impact Test (HIT-6) index. The two authors independently conducted the data extraction and quality
assessment of the included RCTs, and conducted meta-analysis with RevMan V.5.4. Results: Among
the 373 studies, 11 RCTs were included in this systematic review. Seven out of the 11 RCTs were
conducted in the USA, and four were conducted in the UK, Germany, Iran, and Italy, respectively.
Headache frequency and MIDAS scores were statistically signiﬁcant reduced. In the subgroup
analysis, headache strength was signiﬁcantly reduced. Two of the included studies reported adverse
effects, including worsening of migraine intensity and frequency, respiratory symptoms, and vivid
memory of a traumatic event. Conclusions: CBT for migraine effectively reduced headache frequency
and MIDAS score in meta-analysis and headache intensity subgroup analysis, with few adverse
events. Additional RCTs with CBT for migraine headaches are needed for a more accurate analysis.

1. Introduction

Migraine is a disease characterized by severe headache accompanied by symptoms,
such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and vomiting [1]. The prevalence of migraine
is estimated to be 15–18% [2], and it is two to three times higher in women than in men [3,4].

Migraine is a chronic neurological disorder and autonomic nervous system dysfunction
that affects patients’ quality of life [5,6]. The preferred treatment for migraine is medication
administration. Acute medications include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), and triptans [7]. Routine use of opioids and barbiturates is not preferred
because of their poor safety and tolerability [8–10].

Overuse of painkillers can lead to a variety of side effects and medication overuse
headache; therefore, attention should be paid to drug abuse during migraine symptoms [11,12].
Non-drug therapy is known to have fewer side effects and can be used simultaneously
with medications [12,13].

Physicians who treat migraines are increasingly interested in complementary treat-
ments [14,15]. Medications, such as antidepressants, hypertension treatments, and ﬂu-
narizine, were common treatment for migraines. However, acupuncture and biobehavial
therapy are also used to prevent migraine headaches for patients with little response to
existing drug treatment or pregnant women, or patients with psychological disorders. [7,16].
Nutritional supplements, such as riboﬂavin, pyridoxine, folate, cobalamin, and vitamin D,
have recently been widely used as preventive treatments for migraine [17–19].

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a treatment that uses cognitive factors to im-
prove mental disorders and psychological distress [20]. The latest practice guidelines em-
phasize CBT as a selective psychotherapy for problems ranging from depression, anxiety,
and personality disorders to chronic pain, addiction, and relationship pain [21]. Previous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of behavioral therapy for migraine headaches,
including CBT, relaxation, and biological feedback, to reduce the frequency of migraine
attacks and migraine-related disorders [22–24].

Although CBT has been used as a treatment for migraine headaches, there is only one
systematic review on pediatric migraine [25], and no systematic review has been conducted
on all ages. In this study, the author stated that there is evidence that CBT is viable in the
treatment of childhood migraine, and therefore should be provided as a ﬁrst-line treatment,
not only as an add-on if medications are not effective. This study aimed to summarize
the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the clinical efﬁcacy and
safety of CBT on migraine patients of all age. Through this study, we aimed to analyze
the availability and effectiveness of CBT in migraine treatment and to help it be used in
clinical situations.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

Two independent authors (J.-y.B. and N.-Y.K.) searched for randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efﬁcacy of CBT for migraine until October 2020. MEDLINE-
PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (English databases);
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (http://www.cnki.net, accessed on 15 October 2021)
(Chinese database); and Research Information Service System (http://www.riss.kr,
accessed on 15 October 2021), Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated Sys-
tem (http://oasis.kiom.re.kr, accessed on 15 October 2021), Korean Studies Information
Service System (http://kiss.kstudy.com, accessed on 15 October 2021), National Dig-
ital Science Library (http://www.ndsl.kr, accessed on 15 October 2021), and DBPIA
(http://www.dbpia.co.kr, accessed on 15 October 2021) (Korean databases) databases
were searched. “Migraine” and “Cognitive behavioral therapy” were used as search terms,
and searching conditions were modiﬁed to each database. The details of the search strate-
gies are provided in Appendix A.

This review was registered on PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020223201)
and the systematic review was written in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement [26].

2.2. Eligibility Criteria

Only RCTs and quasi-RCTs were included in this review. Eligible participants both
had episodic and chronic migraines, regardless of age, sex, and presence of aura. Studies
in which the International Classiﬁcation of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria (I, II, and
III) and Headache International Society (IHS) criteria were used as diagnostic criteria for
migraine were included in this review. The primary outcome was frequency of migraine
(per month), intensity of migraine indicated on the visual analogue scale, frequency of
taking medication (per month), MIDAS index, and HIT-6 index.

2.3. Outcome Assessment and Data Extraction

Two authors (N.-Y.K. and H.-K.S.) assessed the included studies. A detailed analysis
was performed by two authors (J.-y.B. and N.-Y.K.) using an extraction form that included
country, study design, age, sex, number of participants, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria,
duration, outcome index, effect size, and adverse effects (Table 1). Outcome measures
were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and follow-up. Primary outcome measures were
headache days assessed by headache diary (mostly deﬁned as a day containing 2 or more
hours of headache); headache duration and pain intensity; Migraine Disability Assessment
(MIDAS) [27], assessing migraine-related disability, with a higher score reﬂecting more
severe disability; and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) [28], assessing the impact of headache,
score range is 36–78, with a higher score reﬂecting higher impact and number of days using
rescue medication. Various methods of CBT were used in the included studies, and each
method is listed in Table 2. If there were any missing or unclear results, we contacted the
authors of the included studies.

MCT

(1) Unit 1: Introduction and syndrome education
- information about symptoms, pathophysiology and pathopsychology of migraine as well as instructions for progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)
(2) Unit 2: Medication rules and the risk of Medication Overuse Headache
- information about acute and prophylactic migraine medication and MOH-symptoms and pathomechanisms
- establish a clear behavioral intake algorithm in migraine attack situations,
(3) Unit 3: Medication intake behavior
- aimed at raising awareness for ‘external’ (e.g., availability of drugs, stock-keeping, iatrogenic risk factors like doctor shopping) and ‘internal’
(e.g., fear of attack and losing social functioning, stress level in private and professional life) inﬂuences on patient’s medication intake behavior.
(4) Unit 4: General and personal risk factors for drug intake
- established a general risk proﬁle of medication overuse for each patient.
(5) Unit 5: Everyday transfer
- aim to establish individual goals for future drug intake and learning how to make use of social support to control intake behavior.
(6) Daily PMR and Headache Diary: Daily exercise of PMR as well as keeping a daily headache diary had to be performed during the time between all
ﬁve sessions
(7) Homework: after each session, patients were given topic-related homework.

2.4. Assessment of Risk of Bias

The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) assessment tool was used for quality assessment of
the included study [38]. Each bias was classiﬁed into three categories: high risk, low risk,
and unclear risk and was evaluated by two authors (HKS and TJK).

Seven domains were assessed: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blind-
ing of participants and research personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete
outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases.

2.5. Data Synthesis

As a measure of migraine improvement, the weighted mean difference (MD) and
standard deviation (SD) of the primary outcomes were calculated for meta-analysis using
Review Manager (RevMan) ([Computer program]. Version 5.4. The Cochrane Collaboration,
2020) using 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI), respectively. We assessed effect estimates with
MD and standard deviation SD for continuous outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed
by I2 statistics. If I2 was >75%, the random effect model was adopted for meta-analysis;
otherwise, the ﬁxed effect model was used.

2.6. Heterogeneity and Subgroup Analysis

Subgroup analysis was divided according to the control group’s method. Hetero-
geneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. When heterogeneity was higher than 70%, we
also performed subgroup analysis to explain the source of heterogeneity using Review Manager.

3. Results
3.1. The Results of Literature Search and Screening

A total of 373 studies were identiﬁed from the electronic databases, and among these,
233 studies were screened after removing 140 duplicate studies. In the screening, 55 articles
without full text were removed, and 178 articles were assessed for eligibility. Excluding
47 articles that were not RCTs and 122 articles that were non-CBT, 11 articles were ﬁnally
included (Figure 1).

3.2. Description of the Included Studies

Seven RCTs [12,24,29,32,34,36,37] were conducted in the USA, and four RCTs [30,31,33,
35] were conducted in the UK, Italy, Germany, and Iran, respectively. All included studies
were written in English. The total number of patients with migraine analyzed in the review
was 621 (intervention: 317, control: 304). A summary of the included studies is presented
in Table 1.

There were two types of control groups: one control group received conventional
therapy called no treatment/treatment as usual (TAU), and the other group was the sham
control group, who underwent lifestyle modiﬁcation and received placebo behavioral
therapy. According to the Western criteria, four trials [30,33,36,37] utilized the IHS criteria
but did not mention the version, ﬁve [12,29,32,34,35] used the ICHD-II criteria, and two [24,
31] used the ICHD-III criteria. CBT methods as interventions were different in detail and
are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

3.3. Risk of Bias in the Included Studies

As shown in Figure 2, seven studies reported randomization methods, and there was
no statement of randomization method in four studies [30,31,34,37]. Five studies [24,29,32,33,35]
used computerized randomization, one study [36] used a random number table, and one
study [12] conducted randomization based on the inpatient day of participants. There were
three single-blind studies [32,33,36], two double-blind studies [12,29], one without blind-
ing [24], and ﬁve without mentioning blinding [30,31,34,35,37]. There were no incomplete
data in the three studies [29,31,34], and there were missing data in eight studies. Three stud-
ies [30,36,37] showed insufﬁcient information on dropout data, four studies [12,24,32,33]
used intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) for missing data, and one study [35] used analysis-
per-protocol and not ITT analysis for missing data. There were insufﬁcient data to judge
selective reporting without two studies. One study [24] with the original protocol and one
study [30] that was thought to have selectively reported on an outcome of their study.

3.4. Primary Outcome
3.4.1. Headache Frequency

Six RCTs [24,29–31,33,35] reported the mean and standard deviation of the headache
frequency, excluding ﬁve studies (three studies [32,36,37] that did not mention the mean
and standard deviation, one study [12] that reported the median value only, and one
study [34] that reported the percentage of migraine days only, instead of mean and SD).
In meta-analysis, heterogeneity was high (χ2 = 28.18, p = 0.0003, I2 = 82%) so we used
subgroup analysis according to the type of control group. The days of headache per
month decreased signiﬁcantly in sub-group analysis with the education group (p < 0.0001)
(Figure 3). However, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in headache frequency
in the sub-group analysis with the WL/TAU/SMC group (p = 0.36) and heterogeneity
remained high (χ2 = 16.11, p = 0.001, I2 = 81%) (Figure 4).

3.5. Adverse Events

Two studies [24,29] reported adverse effects. Powers reported 199 adverse events
(90 in the CBT plus amitriptyline group vs. 109 in the headache education plus amitriptyline
group), including status migrainosus or worsening of migraine, respiratory adverse events
(e.g., inﬂuenza, pneumonia), and other expected adverse effects of amitriptyline (fatigue,
drowsiness, and dizziness). Seng reported two adverse events in the MBCT-M group:
vivid recollection of a traumatic event while practicing mindfulness and severe increase in
headache frequency and pain intensity.

4. Discussion

Migraine headache is a chronic neurological disease that varies in its frequency and
severity, and [29] is a prevalent condition that can severely affect personal, social, and
work life during attacks [30,31]. Although the standard treatment for migraine headaches
is currently taking medication, a psychiatric approach with a high level of psychological
co-prosperity has also recently drawn attention [28,31]. Individuals with migraine are
increasingly approaching complementary and integrative health strategies [14,15]. Because
patients have an increased preference for CBT treatment for a variety of reasons, several
behavioral treatments for migraine prevention have been used, especially during pregnancy
or when pharmacological choices for patients are limited, such as low efﬁcacy or lack of
durability in pharmacotherapy, or in combination with pharmacological treatments [16].

CBT refers to cognitive processes related to the development and maintenance of psy-
chopathology, particularly emotional pain and dysfunction, which are primarily conducted
during sessions, requiring therapists to coordinate interventions to best help patients [34].
CBT therapy enables patients to develop preventive and acute care strategies, such as
trigger identiﬁcation, modiﬁcation of maladaptive interrelated thoughts, feelings and
behaviors surrounding headache, and physiological autoregulation strategies. Behav-
ioral therapies for migraine headaches, including cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation,
and biofeedback, have demonstrated efﬁcacy in reducing migraine attack frequency and
migraine-related disorders [22,23,35,36].

Several previous studies have shown that CBT reduces disability and chronic pain in
patients [39,40]. Our study showed that CBT had a signiﬁcant effect on reducing headache
frequency and MIDAS scores, which is consistent with the results of previous studies.
Therefore, although many studies with more samples are needed in the future, it is believed
that CBT can be considered for its use as a complementary therapy for migraine treatment.
In subgroup analysis of headache frequency, CBT was effective in reducing migraine
incidence date compared to education alone, but there was no signiﬁcant difference in
headache frequency compared to the WL/TAU/SMC group. In the analysis of the ﬁxed
effect model, the p value was 0.004, but the heterogeneity was high at 81%, so it was
analyzed using a random effect model for a more conservative analysis.

MIDAS score in subgroup analysis showed signiﬁcant change compared to both the
education (p = 0.02) and WL/TAU/SMC group (p = 0.005). Additionally, in subgroup
analysis with WL/TAU/SMC, HIT-6 score showed signiﬁcant change (p = 0.02). Although
the number of studies included in this analysis is small, CBT has been found to have a
signiﬁcant effect on alleviating disability in migraine patients and has shown that it can
also be an option as a treatment to reduce disability caused by migraine headaches.

Meta-analysis and subgroup analysis about headache intensity and the number of days
using rescue medication were impossible due to the high heterogeneity caused by differ-
ences in the control group, and due to the lack of the number of studies

The strength of our study is that it is the ﬁrst systematic review using meta-analysis
of CBT for migraine. Meta-analysis is difﬁcult to use when heterogeneity is signiﬁcantly
high or insufﬁcient data are available. If heterogeneity was high, we conducted a meta-
analysis and evaluated it by performing a subgroup analysis to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
CBT for migraine. Second, our study screened the results of not only an English-based
database but also various database searches, such as Korean and Chinese databases, to

Medicina 2022, 58, 44

25 of 28

reduce publication bias. Finally, for studies with only the F value, we contacted the author
to obtain the mean (SD) value. Five out of the two authors replied to our request and sent
us the raw data [12,24].

This study has some limitations. Clinical heterogeneity was hypothesized to be high
because there was a difference between patients and interventions in each study. There are
many types of migraine, such as acute/chronic, episodic, and migraine with or without
aura. The study was conducted comprising patients with migraine of various types and
intensities. Due to the diversity of participants in each study, there was heterogeneity in
the study demographics. In most cases, the sex ratio of the participants was tilted toward
women without two studies (one study [30] did not mention it, and one study [37] was male
dominant). There were also studies [34,37] that only included children and adolescents.
The reason for this participant conﬁguration is that migraine is most prevalent during the
most potentially productive and childbearing periods [29,30]. CBT treatment methods
were relatively different from study to study, and the limitations of CBT treatment methods
were that they should be implemented in part by experts skilled in each method [12,24].
However, some methods have been implemented through methods, such as CD-ROM [34];
thus, we can expect effective individual treatment to be performed through various video
media and internet lectures. Most studies [32–35,37] combined conventional therapies,
such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, NSAIDs, triptans, and muscle relaxants. Participants in
some studies [12,29–32,34] received pharmacological prophylaxis for migraine (topiramate,
nortriptyline, propranolol, or amytriptiline according to the physician’s choice based on
the patient proﬁle, such as previous failures and contraindications). Hence, it is difﬁcult to
conclude whether the symptoms improved only by the effect of CBT. Finally, there were no
RCTs on CBT for migraine, which were searched from the Korean and Chinese databases.
We hypothesized that taking Western medicine, acupuncture, and herbal medicine has
already been standardized in China and Korea to treat migraine; thus, no RCTs using
CBT have been conducted. Since CBT is receiving attention as an alternative to migraine
treatment, various RCTs should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT on
migraines combined with existing standard treatments.

5. Conclusions

Our study found that CBT can improve headache frequency and MIDAS scores in
patients with migraine, with few adverse events. In subgroup analysis, headache intensity
in the CBT group had a statistically signiﬁcant effect on migraine. Further RCTs with CBT
for migraine headaches are needed for a more accurate analysis.
