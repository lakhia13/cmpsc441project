Abstract
While behavioral interventions remain the mainstay of treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), several potential tar-
geted treatments addressing the underlying neurophysiology of ASD have emerged in the last few years. These are promising 
for the potential to, in future, become part of the mainstay treatment in addressing the core symptoms of ASD. Although it 
is likely that the development of future targeted treatments will be influenced by the underlying heterogeneity in etiology, 
associated genetic mechanisms influencing ASD are likely to be the first targets of treatments and even gene therapy in the 
future for ASD. In this article, we provide a review of current psychopharmacological treatment in ASD including those 
used to address common comorbidities of the condition and upcoming new targeted approaches in autism management. 
Medications including metformin, arbaclofen, cannabidiol, oxytocin, bumetanide, lovastatin, trofinetide, and dietary supple-
ments including sulforophane and N-acetylcysteine are discussed. Commonly used medications to address the comorbidities 
associated with ASD including atypical antipsychotics, serotoninergic agents, alpha-2 agonists, and stimulant medications 
are also reviewed. Targeted treatments in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic disorder leading to ASD, 
provide a model for new treatments that may be helpful for other forms of ASD.

Introduction

ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental, biologically based 
condition with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 44 people [1] 
that impacts all areas of child development — from behav-
ior, problem solving abilities and self-care skills, to complex

social communication ability, language, and executive func-
tioning skills. The range of symptoms and severity of ASD 
vary greatly from child to child, and clinical manifestations 
depend on the individual’s age, cognitive and language abili-
ties, and co-occurring conditions. The last revision of the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) defines ASD 
as impairments in two main domains: (1) social commu-
nication and interaction, which comprises challenges in 
social-emotional reciprocity, challenges in using nonverbal 
strategies during social interaction, and challenges develop-
ing, maintaining and understanding relationships, and (2) 
restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, 
manifested by unusual repetitive movements or behaviors, 
restricted interests, insistence on sameness and inflexible 
adherence to routines, as well as sensory challenges rang-
ing from seeking to avoiding certain sensory stimuli [2–4]. 
However, a range of behavioral, cognitive, and emotional 
disturbances in ASD can also be attributed to a high rate 
of co-occurring mental health and medical conditions such 
as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, 
depression, phobias, intellectual disability, speech/language 
impairment, restrictive/avoidant food intake, sleep issues,

sensory processing issues, and genetic conditions. This often 
makes the recognition, diagnosis, and clinical management 
of ASD even more complex and difficult [5–8].

Classic medical management of medical conditions has 
largely revolved around pharmacological treatment. How-
ever, despite decades of research in ASD, current evidence 
has only established behavioral (non-pharmacological) treat-
ments as the mainstay of management to address the core  
symptoms of ASD. Part of the reason for a lack of efficacy  
in many treatment studies stems from the heterogeneous 
etiology underlying the overall term of ASD. Some studies 
have subdivided enrolled patients either by their genetic eti-
ology or phenotypic features to address this. The aim of this 
paper is to provide a current update on the pharmacological 
treatments available for ASD and therapeutic subtypes of 
ASD, covering both the established ones and upcoming/
emerging treatments which have potential based on scien-
tific evidence to become standard treatments in the next 
few years. A systematic literature search was completed 
on Medline, Scopus, and Embase with key search terms of 
“autism,” “autism spectrum disorder,” “targeted treatments,” 
“pharmacological therapy,” and “management” to identify 
relevant articles. Here we have highlighted the psychophar-
macological treatments that have the most efficacy and are 
also, in most cases, available now or in the near future to 
clinicians. However, we also recognize the current main-
stay of behavioral intervention in the management of ASD 
and will briefly review those which are supported by strong  
empirical evidence.

Non‑pharmacological (Behavioral) 
Interventions

In 1987, Lovaas published an article which introduced a 
new treatment approach describing a significant improve-
ment of IQ scores and educational functioning in almost 
50% of children with ASD [9]. Also known as The Lovaas 
Method of Applied Behavior Analysis, and subsequently as 
discrete trial training (DTT), it is an intensive, highly struc-
tured, long-term, one-on-one behavior intervention designed 
for young children, which has a strong empirical support 
and has become the foundation for many of the evidence-
based behavioral interventions in use today [10]. Subse-
quently, through decades of extensive research, a number of 
modifications and adaptations of the Lovaas method have 
since been developed. These can be used in different set-
tings, environments, and procedures, and have been shown 
to be effective in addressing the core impairments of ASD 
in social communication, speech, behaviors, play, and learn-
ing [11–14].

Odom et al. [13] and Wong et al. [15] have classified behav-
ioral evidence–based interventions into two groups: compre-
hensive treatment models (CTMs) and focused interventions.
Comprehensive treatment models focused on core ASD 
symptoms have been found to improve language, cognitive, 
and functional language skills in young children, using inten-
sive and long-term multi-disciplinary strategies in naturalis-
tic environments. Instructions can be provided at home or in 
a classroom setting, individually or in a group, provided by 
instructors or by parents. Examples of well-established CTMs 
include Early Behavior Intervention (EIBI) [16], Early Start 
Denver model (ESDM) [17], Developmental, Individual differ-
ence, relationship-based model (DIR/Floortime, or Greenspan 
model) [18], Pivotal Response Training (PRT) [19], and Treat-
ment and education of autistic and related communication 
handicapped children (TEACCH) [20].

Focused interventions address a single skill or a specific 
area of developmental domain and are provided for a short 
time, until the skill is mastered. They can also be effective to 
address life-threatening or socially inappropriate behaviors 
that require rapid addressing. Examples include social skill 
training, toilet training, modeling, cognitive behavioral inter-
vention, and behavioral strategies like prompting, ignoring, 
time delay, reinforcement, discrete trial teaching, and extinc-
tion. These can be implemented as a structured session or in 
a naturalistic setting at home, school, clinic, or community 
settings, with peers or parents, and have behavioral, develop-
mental, or educational purposes. Peer-mediated Instruction 
and Intervention (PMII), also known as “Peer Modeling,” 
“Peer Initiation Training,” “Peer support” [21, 22], and Pic-
ture Exchange Communication System (PECS) [23], are also 
other examples of focused interventions.

Behavioral  interventions  work  most  effectively  when 
started at an early age and the majority cater to young chil-
dren to optimize their development and learning skills. The 
sociocultural beliefs and economic capability of the family 
also moderate treatment impact and outcome [24]. However, 
behavioral interventions do have a role in older children, 
adolescents, and adults as well; the targets of these interven-
tions change in older individuals to include social, voca-
tional, leisure skills, and independent living. Research in 
behavioral interventions for adults with ASD is still limited 
and will need to be expanded in future. 

Established Psychopharmacological 
Treatments

The  use  of  psychotropic  medications  has  markedly 
increased over the last decades; approximately two-thirds 
of autistic adolescents have been treated with psychotropic 

1 3

250

medications, especially those with challenging behaviors 
and co-occurring conditions like intellectual disability (ID), 
medical, and mental health diagnoses. Co-occurring men-
tal health conditions have been reported in approximately 
70% of autistic individuals ranging from attention deficit 
and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), irritability, aggression, 
mood, and anxiety issues [8, 25, 26]. Mandell et al. reported 
that 56% were prescribed at least one psychotropic medica-
tion and 20% were prescribed three or more [27]. Individuals 
with ASD frequently are treated with multiple medications, 
including off-label use (e.g., use of antipsychotic medica-
tions in younger children). Studies have reported high rates 
of  polypharmacy  ranging  from  12  to  35%  based  on  the 
type of studies [28, 29]. The increasing prescription rates 
for individuals with ASD is not completely understood. 
For instance, some authors have postulated that this may 
be influenced by improvements in diagnostic and clinician 
awareness of co-occurring mental health issues [25]. How-
ever, other researchers have reported demographic factors 
influencing pharmacological treatment. For instance, in a 
large study, those who were uninsured or exclusively pri-
vately insured were less likely to use more than 3 medica-
tions than were those insured by Medicaid [30]. Prescrip-
tion  medications  may  also  be  affected  by  demographic 
factors including race, ethnicity, and geography. Studies 
have reported that challenging behaviors and mental health 
diagnoses are influencing factors [29]. For example, poly-
pharmacy is often necessary since one treatment for anxi-
ety may not be helpful for another comorbid condition such 
as ADHD. Such polypharmacy will be more common as 
specific treatments for dysfunctional pathways are utilized 
which go hand in hand with other treatments for common 
comorbidities of ASD. An example is metformin which can 
downregulate the mTOR pathway, and this treatment works 
well with stimulants for ADHD and also Selective Serotonin 
Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety.

Prescribers must consider medications not only for symp-
toms of associated psychopathology but also as targeted 
treatments that have the potential to reverse the neurobio-
logical abnormalities and should be considered as a part of 
an individualized therapeutic program with behavioral and 
educational interventions.

General Principles in Using Pharmacological 
Treatment in ASD

Frequently, identification and management of psychiatric 
issues can be complex, especially for those with limited 
language repertoire, low cognitive function, and those expe-
riencing uncertain symptoms. Diagnostic overshadowing is 
common (failure to identify other conditions in the presence 
of a certain diagnosis). A high level of clinical suspicion 
for co-occurring mental health conditions is required for 

1 3

children and adolescents with communication challenges. 
Managing clinicians should obtain information from the 
child, when possible, family and other providers including 
teachers and therapists. Environmental changes and lack of 
skills can be the source of undesired behaviors and should 
be considered in the plan of care.

Pharmacological interventions are sometimes indicated 
and may facilitate their participation in therapy and enhance 
their daily functioning. The principles used for psychop-
harmacological management are the same for children with 
ASD as for those with typical development. However, pre-
scribers should keep in mind that children with ASD tend 
to be more sensitive to medication effects and more likely 
to have adverse effects than children without ASD. There-
fore, pharmacological treatment should be started at lower 
doses, and adjusted more slowly than in neurotypical chil-
dren. Obtaining objective symptom measures from different 
sources before and after the intervention is key to objectively 
evaluate the response of treatment in different settings.

Serotoninergic Medications

Serotoninergic medications regulate the levels of serotonin 
which is a key messenger specially involved in the gastro-
intestinal, cardiovascular, and the central nervous system 
(CNS). The serotonin level has been reported to be elevated 
in the autistic population, and it has been theorized that sero-
tonin dysregulation is associated with symptoms frequently 
seen in autistic individuals ranging from repetitive behav-
iors to anxiety. PET studies have demonstrated that young 
children (under 5 years old) with ASD have lower levels 
of serotonin in the CSF [31]. Studies of lymphoblastoid 
cell lines in patients with ASD compared to controls have 
demonstrated a deficit of enzymes that convert tryptophan 
to serotonin [32]. These studies suggested that those with 
ASD would benefit from treatment with an SSRI to stimu-
late neurogenesis and neuroprotection [33]. There are three 
different groups of medications that influence the serotonin 
levels: the SSRIs, SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reup-
take inhibitors), and tricyclic antidepressants. The SSRIs 
are one of the most commonly prescribed medications for 
autistic individuals to treat anxiety, mood issues, and irrita-
bility. However, results of available clinical trials have been 
inconsistent in the benefits of SSRI’s for improving aggres-
sion and the core symptoms of ASD [34].

A retrospective study of children with FXS (ages 12 
to 50 months) demonstrated improvement in the trajec-
tory of both receptive and expressive language measures 
on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) in those 
treated  with  low-dose  sertraline  vs  those  who  did  not 
receive sertraline [35]. These results led to a controlled 
trial for 6 months of sertraline in children ages 2 to 6 with 
FXS (60% also had ASD) treated clinically with low dose 

An Update on Psychopharmacological Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder

251

sertraline (2.5 to 5.0 mg/day) [36]. Those treated with ser-
traline demonstrated greater improvement in motor and 
visual subtests and the Cognitive T score on the MSEL 
compared to those on placebo. In the children with both 
FXS and ASD, there was also significant improvement 
on the Expressive Language subscale compared to pla-
cebo [36]. In the same controlled trial, a passive visual eye 
tracking measure of receptive vocabulary was also signifi-
cantly improved in those treated with sertraline compared 
to placebo [37]. These studies suggest that young chil-
dren with FXS both with and without ASD benefit from 
low-dose sertraline treatment. However, a similar study in 
young children ages 2 to 6 with idiopathic ASD (without 
FXS) treated with low-dose sertraline did not demonstrate 
a benefit of sertraline compared to placebo [38]. There-
fore, the genetic subtype of ASD makes a difference in 
response to treatment and all children diagnosed with ASD 
must have genetic testing including Fragile X DNA testing 
and a CGH array for starters and subsequent whole exome 
sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) if 
the initial studies are negative [39].

Atypical Antipsychotics

There are two medications approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of irritability associated with ASD: risperidone, 
approved for children older than 5 years of age [40], and 
aripiprazole, approved for children 6 to 17 years of age 
[41]; clinical trials found them to be effective in reducing 
irritability and, to a lesser degree, repetitive behaviors. 
These two atypical antipsychotic medications have affin-
ity for dopamine, 5-HT, alpha-adrenergic, and histamin-
ergic receptors in the brain. They also share similar safety 
profiles; the most common side effects include fatigue, 
increased  appetite,  GI  symptoms,  hyperprolactinemia, 
weight gain, and sedation, and less commonly activation 
including restlessness and akathisia. They are also linked 
to more serious side effects including dyslipidemia, hyper-
glycemia, metabolic syndrome, and extrapyramidal symp-
toms  or  drug-induced  movement  disorders.  Therefore, 
close clinical and laboratory monitoring is recommended. 
Given that the efficacy and safety of these medications 
have not been established for the long-term treatment of 
irritability in autistic individuals, it is important to peri-
odically re-evaluate the need for continuation of treatment. 
Since the development of atypical antipsychotics, the use 
of the conventional antipsychotics has been reserved for 
more  severe  cases  refractory  to  the  newer  generation 
medications, due to the narrower safety profile and greater 
incidence of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal 
symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia with conventional 
antipsychotics.

Stimulant Medications

Stimulants are usually the first line of treatment to treat 
co-occurring attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) as they present with a rapid clinical effect and there 
is enough data supporting their use and safety. Approxi-
mately half of autistic children also meet criteria for ADHD 
[42], but prevalence widely varies based on samples [8, 
43–47]. Treating co-occurring ADHD symptoms in autistic  
individuals should focus on improvement in enhancing their 
daily function in multiple settings, including learning, and 
hopefully long-term functional outcomes improving associ-
ated symptoms causing impairment in the academic setting, 
peer relationships, and emotional regulation, which are also 
key predictors and mediators of functional difficulties in  
adulthood. Before starting a patient on a regimen, the pre-
scribing clinician should assess the potential risks for phar-
macotherapy by obtaining a complete past medical history, 
family history, and a physical examination with a specific 
focus on the cardiovascular system. It is important to obtain 
pretreatment baseline information and a close follow up 
to objectively evaluate the impact of common side effects 
associated with pharmacotherapy for ADHD (i.e., appetite 
changes,  hypertension,  weight  loss,  sleep  disturbances, 
headaches, abdominal pain). Baseline sleep problems do not 
appear to predict stimulant-related sleep problems and may 
improve with stimulant therapy [48]. Adolescent patients 
should be assessed for substance use or abuse prior to start-
ing treatment.

There are two main stimulant families: the amphetamines 
are usually slightly more efficacious than the methylpheni-
date derivates which are usually better tolerated [49]. In a 
systematic review and network meta-analysis that included 
81 published and unpublished randomized trials in > 10,000 
neurotypical children, amphetamines were slightly more effi-
cacious than methylphenidate in reducing clinician-rated 
core symptoms of ADHD at approximately 12 weeks; how-
ever, amphetamines were less tolerable than placebo and 
methylphenidate was better tolerated than amphetamines 
[49]. Specific systematic review of four-crossover trials in 
autistic children (113 participants) age 5 to 13 years found 
low-quality evidence that short-term treatment with meth-
ylphenidate may improve hyperactivity and inattention in 
children with ASD, and the only significant adverse side 
effect was reduced appetite as rated by parents; however, 
there was no evidence of impact on core ASD symptoms 
or improvement in social interaction [50]. In the largest 
crossover trial, approximately 50% of children with ASD 
responded to methylphenidate based on the hyperactivity 
subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC); the 
effect size ranged from 0.20 to 0.54, depending upon dose 
and rater, with greater improvement at higher doses; then, 
this modest effect supports that Methylphenidate exerts a  

1 3

lower effect on primary ADHD symptoms in individuals with 
ASD compared to those in the neurotypical population. Six 
of 66 children in the double-blind phase (9.1%;) discontinued 
treatment due to adverse effects, including irritability, repeti-
tive behaviors, tics, insomnia, and reduced appetite [51].

Treatment  failure  is  defined  by  lack  of  satisfactory 
improvement in core symptoms of ADHD at the maximum 
dose or the occurrence of intolerable adverse effects. At 
least half of the children who presented with an inadequate 
response or side effects to a certain medication may respond 
well to another one. For those children failing to respond 
to two different medications, the prescriber should evaluate 
other causes for the limited therapeutic response including 
(1) the presence of comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, (2) unre-
alistic expectations about the expected clinical response, (3) 
misuse or medication diversion, and (4) lack of adherence to 
the regimen. Children on stable maintenance dose should be 
followed every 6 months to monitor side effects and evaluate 
clinical response.

Alpha‑2‑adrenergic Agonists

There is also evidence about the use of alpha 2 agonists 
to improve core ADHD symptoms, but alpha-2-adrenergic 
agonists (i.e., guanfacine and clonidine) are frequently used 
in children under 5 year old with ADHD or hyperarousal, 
cases with poor response to a trial of stimulants, or selec-
tive norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, have unacceptable 
side effects, or have significant co-occurring conditions (i.e., 
sleep issues). However, studies of alpha-2-agonists in ASD 
are limited and have small sample sizes. Guanfacine has 
been reported to be safe and effective in the treatment of 
hyperactivity and impulsiveness in children with ASD [52, 
53]. The most common side effects of guanfacine include 
sedation, constipation, irritability, and aggression. A small 
crossover study has also suggested positive effects of clo-
nidine in ASD including decreased irritability, stereotypy, 
hyperactivity, inappropriate speech, and hyperarousal behav-
iors [54].

Data from randomized trials, systematic reviews, and 
meta-analyses show that atomoxetine and alpha-2-adrenergic 
agonists are more effective than placebo in reducing the core 
symptoms of ADHD, but as a class, they are less effective 
than stimulants [49, 55, 56]. Similarly, it is key to obtain 
objective targeted symptom measures at baseline and during 
treatment to objectively evaluate the response to treatment 
in different settings.

In a recent review of nine controlled trials of 430 children 
with ASD comparing the response between methylpheni-
date, atomoxetine, and guanfacine, methylphenidate and 
atomoxetine had superior effects than placebo in address-
ing ADHD symptoms; however, the response for hyper-
activity symptoms was less than observed in neurotypical 

1 3

populations with both medications [57]. Worse treatment 
outcomes were associated with individuals with lower cog-
nitive functioning.

Melatonin

Sleep issues are frequently reported in children with ASD 
potentially affecting their behavior, daily functioning, and 
family life. There is some evidence suggesting that low 
melatonin  levels  affect  the  circadian  rhythm  in  autistic 
children [58]. In cases where behavioral and environmen-
tal sleep interventions have been implemented with limited 
response, clinicians may recommend the use of melatonin 
which is usually well tolerated and has a low incidence of 
side effects [59]. There is increasing evidence for the use 
of prolonged-release melatonin in autistic individuals with 
limited response to regular release formulations [60]. Mela-
tonin is an over-the-counter product that is not regulated 
by the FDA. When parents/caregivers purchase melatonin, 
they should seek a formulation that contains melatonin as 
the only active ingredient.

N‑acetylcysteine

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is another antioxidant that can be 
purchased over the counter (OTC), and it can improve the 
imbalance of excitation: inhibition (E:I) that is seen in some 
forms of ASD [61]. NAC works by two mechanisms to lower 
the E:I imbalance; it lowers glutamatergic neurotransmis-
sion, and the cysteine leads to an increase in glutathione  
synthesis which is an important antioxidant. Cysteine is also 
oxidized to cystine, which further helps to reduce glutamater-
gic neurotransmission [62]. Hardan and colleagues carried out 
a controlled trial of escalating doses of NAC from 900 mg 
once a day for 4 weeks, increasing to bi-daily dosing for 
4 weeks and then tri-daily dosing for the last 4 weeks com-
pared to placebo. They randomized 33 subjects with ASD ages 
3.2 to 10.7 years and after 12 weeks of treatment they found 
significant improvement on their primary outcome meas-
ure, irritability subscale on the ABC (p < 0.001) for patients 
treated with NAC compared to placebo. Additional improve-
ments were seen in stereotypic behaviors with significance 
reached on the RBS-S Stereotypies subscale (p < 0.014) and 
the SRS Autism Mannerisms subscale (p < 0.045) for those 
treated with NAC vs placebo [62]. NAC was well tolerated 
although an occasional patient did not like the taste or had  
minimal gastrointestinal side-effects.

Dietary Supplements

Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate (found 
in  broccoli  and  other  cruciferous  vegetables)  [63–65]. 
Sulforaphane  is  an  antioxidant,  anti-inflammatory,  and 

An Update on Psychopharmacological Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder

253

mitochondrial  protective  agent  that  has  been  studied  in 
several animal models and humans with neurodegenerative 
and neurodevelopmental disorders [66]. Sulforaphane is a 
sulfur-rich dietary phytochemical which can penetrate the 
blood brain barrier, and it subsequently induces the nuclear 
factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling cascade 
that stimulates the expression of more than 200 genes that 
are antioxidants and involved in detoxification and neuro-
protection in the CNS [67]. The effect leads to reduction 
of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
upregulation of the proteozome system to digest unfolded 
or misfolded proteins, enhancement of autophagy, inhibi-
tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, protection from heme 
toxicity, and defense of neuronal cells from Aβ42-mediated 
cytotoxicity.

There have been a few studies in patients with ASD [68, 
69] including a controlled trial of young men ages 13 to 
27 with moderate to severe ASD treated with sulforaphane 
(n = 29) compared to placebo (n = 15) for 18 weeks. Sig-
nificant improvements were seen on the Aberrant Behavior 
Checklist (ABC), the Clinical Global Improvement Scale 
(CGI-I), and the Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS) [69]. 
This positive trial lead to a more detailed study in children 
with ASD, a randomized controlled trial of sulforaphane 
lasting 15 weeks followed by an open label trial for another 
15 weeks in 57 children ages 3 to 12 years [70]. Although 
the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical 
Impressions Scale, did not improve significantly in those 
on sulforaphane, a secondary measure, the ABC, did sig-
nificantly improve on sulforaphane vs placebo but the SRS 
did not. In addition, there were significant improvements 
in the biomarkers including the glutathione redox status, 
mitochondrial  respiration,  inflammatory  markers,  and 
heat shock proteins on sulforaphane vs placebo, and these 
improvements correlated with improvements on the ABC. 
They utilized a commercial product of sulforaphane called 
Avmacol made by Nutrimax with a tablet dose of 2 to 8 
tablets per day depending on the weight of the child (equiva-
lent to 2.2 μmol/kg/day). There were no significant adverse 
events and the supplement was well tolerated.

Other antioxidants have been studied in ASD including 
omega-3 fatty acids [71, 72] with mixed results, and these 
antioxidants promote glutathione recycling by facilitating 
the conversion of oxidized glutathione into reduced glu-
tathione. A more recent study was carried out by Mazahery 
et al. [73] in 111 children with ASD ages 2.5 to 8 years, and 
they were randomized to placebo, Vitamin D 2000 IU/day, 
or omega-3 722 mg/day or both interventions for 1 year of 
treatment. Seventy-three patients completed a year of ther-
apy, and those on both treatments had a significant reduction 
in their primary outcome measure, irritability on the ABC 
subscale (p < 0.001) compared to placebo, and those treated 
with vitamin D alone also had a reduction in irritability also 

compared to placebo (p < 0.45) [73]. These studies suggest 
that antioxidants may be a helpful ancillary treatment in 
some patients with ASD, although biomarkers of oxidative 
stress would be helpful to assess in further studies to better 
identify those who would benefit from this treatment.

Emerging Targeted Treatments 
with a Possible Role in ASD

Oxytocin

Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide synthesized in the hypo-
thalamus that plays a critical role in social functioning. 
Extant literature has shown that OXT enhances social pro-
cessing in typically developing adults (enhanced eye con-
tact, better emotion recognition in faces) immediately after 
its administration [74]. There have been generally positive 
results of OXT in adults with ASD, with trials showing 
improvements in repetitive behaviors, social reciprocity, and 
emotion recognition [75–77]. However, all these trials stud-
ied only short-term benefits (within a few weeks) of OXT 
administration. A recent randomised, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind study in adults with ASD showed improve-
ments  in  self-reported  repetitive  behaviors  and  positive 
mood at 1 year post treatment after an initial 4 weeks of 
oxytocin treatment [78]. However, in this same study, there 
were no significant treatment benefits for social responsive-
ness with OXT [78]. Another recent study in young adults 
with ASD also did not demonstrate any immediate benefits 
of OXT on empathy and social perception [79].

Results of OXT studies in children have overall been 
more  equivocal  with  mixed  results.  Although  4  studies 
showed positive short-term results of OXT administration 
on social responsiveness (following 4 or 5 weeks of OXT 
administration) [80–83], another 2 studies did not demon-
strate any OXT specific improvements in social respon-
siveness or repetitive behavior in children with ASD [84, 
85]. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) however 
did not show any significant effects between the OXT and 
placebo group in aberrant behavior, social communication, 
or cognition [86]. At the neural networks level, it has been 
shown that intranasal OXT leads to increased activation in 
the brain regions known to be involved in perceiving and 
thinking about social-emotional information and enhances 
effective connectivity between nodes of the brain’s reward 
and  socioemotional  processing  systems  [87,  88].  There 
were no noted side effects in these studies on children with 
ASD, thus far, although animal studies have raised the pos-
sibility of increased basal OXT levels with long-term OXT 
administration; the clinical effects of this being unclear. Of 
pertinence, there remains a lack of conclusive evidence for 
the long-term beneficial effects of OXT in addressing the

core symptoms of autism [89]. Given that the vast major-
ity of studies in children utilize parent-reported outcome 
measures of social and behavioral symptoms, inherent limi-
tations of bias in reporting even in placebo-controlled trials 
are likely to come into play. Another important consideration 
is whether the gains that are seen with OXT administration 
in the experimental setting translate to real life and this is 
also unclear. The role of OXT thus far has been limited to 
its immediate effect after administration and hence is not a 
single treatment option for ASD. Nonetheless, as illustrated 
by a recent meta-analysis, there does seem to be overall ben-
eficial effects of OXT on social symptoms of ASD, although 
this review included both children and adults [90]. There is 
also some promising research looking at the role of OXT 
in combination with other treatment modalities including 
behavior therapy and probiotics, with clinical trials in this 
area ongoing [91, 92]. It is also likely that the effects of OXT 
in ASD are modulated by age, gender, and possibly genetic 
factors [77, 79, 90]. As such, although it holds much prom-
ise, the use of OXT in individuals with ASD is currently not 
a mainstream treatment.

Bumetanide

Bumetanide is a well-established loop diuretic that works 
by inhibiting sodium–potassium-chloride co-transporters, 
namely, NKCC1 and NKCC2. Bumetanide has been pur-
ported as a potential treatment in autism due to its inherent 
chloride-related antagonist effects which is linked to GABA-
ergic inhibition [93]. Bumetanide has been shown to reduce 
broad ASD symptomatology in children following a 3-month 
treatment course in 2 placebo-controlled randomized con-
trolled trials [94, 95]. Both of these trials used outcomes 
that are screening tools for ASD, namely, the SRS and the 
Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Another open-label 
trial of 6 children with severe ASD and intellectual disabil-
ity showed parent-reported improvement in communicative 
abilities of all children after 3 months of bumetanide [96]. 
However, a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 
superiority trial in children with ASD without severe intellec-
tual disability did not show any treatment benefits on the core 
symptoms of ASD as measured on the SRS-2 [97]. It did show  
treatment benefits on the repetitive behavior scale, with no 
major adverse effects. Another study has suggested possi-
ble combined effects of bumetanide with ABA therapy in 
improving ASD symptoms on the CARS, although this was 
not a randomized controlled trial [98]. There are 2 phase 3  
clinical studies ongoing now, which may shed further infor-
mation on the potential benefits of bumetanide in ASD [99]. 
There is some functional-MRI-based evidence suggesting 
that bumetanide reduces the exaggerated amygdala activa-
tion to eye contact in individuals with ASD and contributes 
to increased eye-gaze time with biological stimuli and better 

1 3

emotional face perception [100, 101]. Regardless, based on 
current literature, there is inconclusive evidence for the role 
of bumetanide in addressing the core symptoms of ASD  
[102, 103].

Metformin

Targeted treatments that reverse known  neurobiological 
abnormalities in subgroups of ASD where there is also ani-
mal data to demonstrate benefit have emerged in the last 
decade for subgroups of ASD. The subgroup of ASD that 
is leading the way in targeted treatments is FXS, the most 
common single gene cause of ASD. In addition, post mortem 
studies have shown that FMRP, the protein that is missing 
or deficient in FXS, is also deficient in the brain in patients 
with idiopathic ASD without a fragile X mutation [104, 
105]. Therefore, FXS is a model for targeted treatments 
in other subtypes of ASD and treatments that work well in 
FXS may also be beneficial for other forms of ASD. So we 
will describe some of the targeted treatment studies with 
compounds that are available currently, although not FDA 
approved for FXS nor ASD.

Animal studies in FXS have demonstrated a hyperactive 
insulin receptor and up-regulation of the mammalian target 
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mitogen-activated 
protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinases (MAPK/
ERK) signaling pathways, as well as elevation of MMP-9 
levels in the absence of FMRP, the protein produced by the 
FMR1 gene [106–108]. Metformin is a bi-guanide that is a 
primary treatment for type 2 diabetes, but it can also reduce 
the appetite in individuals with obesity. Therefore, studies 
of metformin were first carried out in patients with FXS who 
demonstrated obesity, often with the Prader-Willi-phenotype 
of FXS [109]. In a handful of patients with FXS treated 
clinically with metformin between the ages of 4 and 60 years 
old, there was improvement in overeating but also on the 
ABC subscales of irritability, aggression, and social avoid-
ance [109]. Parents also stated that they saw improvement 
in the expressive language abilities in conversation. The 
potential language improvements are currently being stud-
ied in a controlled trial of metformin occurring over 3 sites, 
2 in Canada (Edmonton and Montreal), and one site in the 
USA at the MIND Institute funded by the Azrieli Foundation 
(NCT03479476, NCT03862950). Patients ages 6 to 45 are 
recruited into a randomized controlled trial lasting 4 months 
with outcome measures including the Expressive Language 
Sampling as the primary outcome but also event related 
potentials, eye tracking, NIH toolbox, and other behavio-
ral measures are assessed. The results will be available in 
2022. Additional open label studies have been carried out 
with metformin including one in children ages 2 to 7 years 
old with FXS, and improvements were seen in behavior and 
development on the MSEL [110]. Individual case studies

have shown that macroorchidism did not develop in boy who 
started metformin clinically before puberty [111] and two 
adults with FXS improved their IQ when using metformin 
for over one year [112].

Lovastatin

Lovastatin is a commonly used statin that lowers cholesterol 
levels, but it does this by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl 
coenzyme A (3HMG-CoA) reductase, and it is FDA approved 
for lowering hypercholesterolemia or hyperlipidemia in children 
and adults. This action lowers the excessive protein production 
of the MEK-ERK pathway which are elevated in FXS. Stud-
ies of lovastatin treatment in the FXS knock out (KO) mouse 
rescued excess protein synthesis and also epilepsy [113]. These 
animal studies stimulated FXS patient trials. The one controlled 
trial included 32 children with FXS between 10 to 17 years 
treated in a RCT for 20 weeks with a dose of 10 to 40 mg a day 
as tolerated [114]. In addition, the patients all received Parent 
Implemented Language Intervention (PILI) [115] delivered 
by distance video teleconferencing over 12 weeks by a speech 
and language therapist with 4 sessions per week. Parents were 
taught a set of language facilitation techniques that were uti-
lized with shared story telling sessions with their child. The 
main outcome measures were the number of utterances and 
new words utilized in addition to additional language scales, 
behavioral measures (ABC), and the CGI-I. So this study com-
pared the combined effects of lovastatin plus PILI to PILI alone 
with placebo. Remarkably, there was significant improvements 
from baseline in both groups, but the outcomes were the same 
in both groups; that is, PILI alone had as much improvement 
as lovastatin plus PILI demonstrating the power of intensive 
language intervention [114].

Cannabidiol

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid found in Can-
nabis sativa, marijuana. Although there are hundreds of 
phytocannabinoids in marijuana, CBD is the second most 
common  one  after  delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC) 
which  has  psychotropic  properties.  Marijuana  has  been 
used for 8000 years in India, China, and Middle East for 
fiber and medicinal properties; then introduced to Europe in 
early nineteenth century by Napoleon’s army returning from 
Egypt and then to Britain for medical use by a surgeon who 
served in India. CBD is the non-psychotropic component 
of marijuana, and there are numerous therapeutic effects of 
this drug including treatment of anxiety, pain, nausea, and 
motor deficits including the tremor in Parkinson’s disease 
[116]. CBD has both neuromodulatory and neuroprotective 
effects through a number of mechanisms including blocking 
neuroinflammation and potentiating anti-inflammatory path-
ways, improving mitochondrial function,  GABAA agonist 

potentiation, stimulation of  5HT1A receptors, and enhancing 
levels of anandamide (AEA) [116–119].

The  endocannabinoid  system  has  two  receptors   CB1 
found primarily in the CNS and  CB2 found throughout the 
body and the immune system. The primary endogenous  
ligands  for   CB1  and   CB2  receptors  are  called  endocan-
nabinoids  (ECs)  and  include  anandamide  AEA  and  2- 
arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). The ECs modulate synaptic trans-
mission throughout the CNS, yielding widespread influence  
on cognition and behavior. The ECs are synthesized and 
released from post-synaptic membrane-bound phospholip-
ids in response to neuronal signaling and act as retrograde 
signaling molecules across the synaptic cleft to stimulate 
 CB1 receptors on the presynaptic terminal, and they can 
inhibit neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic termi-
nal. Enzymes that function in synthesizing 2-AG include 
phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL).

CBD has also been shown to act as a positive allosteric 
modulator at  GABAA receptors, and controlled trials have 
shown that CBD in the form of Epidiolex is an effective 
anticonvulsant in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome [120]. CBD’s ability to enhance endocannabinoid 
levels and facilitate GABAergic transmission may serve to 
improve the balance in inhibitory and excitatory transmis-
sion and help restore neuronal function and synaptic plas-
ticity in patients with ASD and FXS even when there is no 
epilepsy. Animal models of both FXS and ASD have shown 
benefits when treated with CBD [121, 122]. Studies of indi-
viduals with ASD treated with CBD and open label trials of 
CBD are reviewed by Nezgovorva et al. [123]; however, the 
preparations studied have both CBD and variable levels of 
THC, although in general, benefits were seen in irritability, 
sleep disorders, tantrums, and anxiety. Currently, studies of 
cannabidavarin (CBDV) are taking place in ASD and CBDV 
has also been helpful in animal models of ASD [123].

Recently,  the  development  of  a  topical  CBD  that  is 
manufactured so that there is no THC has facilitated stud-
ies in both ASD and in FXS. The BRIGHT study was an 
open label study of children ages 3 to 17 with ASD lasting 
14 weeks, and benefits were seen in most outcome measures 
including the ABC and measures of anxiety [124]. Currently, 
a controlled trial of this topical CBD called Zyn002 is tak-
ing place in children with ASD. Another recent randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) looking at an oral preparation of CBD 
in children and young adults with ASD demonstrated posi-
tive improvements in behavior and social communication 
with CBD [125].

Huessler  et  al.  [126]  carried  out  an  open  label  trial 
of  Zyn002  in  Australia  for  children  with  FXS  of  ages 
3–17 years old with doses of the transdermal CBD at doses 
250 mg bi-daily for 12 weeks (ACTRN12617000150347). 
Both the primary outcome, the Anxiety Mood and Depres-
sion (ADAMS) scale and the secondary measures including 

1 3

256

the ABC, demonstrated efficacy. Subsequently, a multicenter 
controlled trial of over 200 children with FXS was carried 
out and efficacy was seen in only those children with > 90% 
methylation with FXS on the primary outcome measure of 
the Social Avoidance subscale of the  ABCFX, a scale that 
has been developed for FXS modified from the ABC (Berry-
Kravis et al. 2022 under review Sci Trans Medicine). Cur-
rently, the FDA has not approved Zyn002 for general use, 
but an additional multicenter controlled trial is now taking 
place to win this approval. It is very likely that the current 
controlled trials taking place for ASD and FXS will show 
efficacy for subgroups for both disorders, and subsequently, 
CBD will be more broadly utilized.

Arbaclofen

Arbaclofen,  also  called  STX209,  is  a  selective 
ɣ-aminobutyric  acid  type  B  receptor  agonist  that  is  the 
R-enantiomer of racemic baclofen. For many subtypes of 
ASD, there is a  GABAB deficit and arbaclofen has rescued 
the behavioral deficits including social deficits in the mouse 
models of idiopathic ASD [127], deletion of 16p11.2 [128], 
and FXS [129]. There are 3 pathways that are improved 
with arbaclofen: Stimulation of presynaptic  GABAB recep-
tors inhibits glutamate release thereby lowering the mGluR5 
pathway. Stimulation of GABA receptors also improves inhi-
bition that is down-regulated in many forms of ASD and 
arbaclofen also enhances K channel activation which can 
also be down-regulated in many forms of ASD [130]. The 
promising mouse studies led to human trials in FXS [131] 
that initially showed improvements in those with ASD plus 
FXS leading to phase 3 trials in FXS [132]. However, the 
adult studies of FXS did not demonstrate efficacy and the 
pediatric trials did not reach significance for the primary 
outcome measure, but did show limited improvements in 
secondary measures including the Parenting Stress Index 
because of lowered irritability in the children [132].

Both open label studies in idiopathic ASD and in those 
with a 16p11.2 deletion have been carried out with positive 
behavioral benefits. A controlled trial with idiopathic ASD 
has also been started but not yet reported. Arbaclofen has 
been well tolerated even at higher doses up to 15 mg tri-daily 
so it is likely that further studies will be carried out both in 
ASD and in subtypes of ASD including FXS.

Trofinetide

Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is considered an emerg-
ing treatment for ASD in animal and cellular models in ASD 
[133–136]. Trofinetide is an analogue of the amino-terminal 
tripeptide of IGF1, and it has been studied in patient groups 
of ASD subtypes. Trofinetide is glycyl-L-2-methylprolyl-
L-glutamic acid, and it was studied in a controlled phase 2 

1 3

trial in 82 children with Rett syndrome ages 5 to 15 years, 
and significant benefit was found in the high-dose group 
(200 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo [137]. Significant 
benefits were seen in several measures including the Rett 
Syndrome Behavior Scale, the Rett Syndrome Clinician Rat-
ing Scale, and a visual analogue scale. This report led to a 
multicenter phase 3 controlled trial in Rett syndrome which 
is ongoing currently.

Trofinetide  has  also  been  studied  in  a  28-day  con-
trolled  trial  in  adolescent  and  adult  patients  with  FXS 
[138]. Patients were randomized to trofinetide 35 mg/kg/
day, 70 mg/kg/day, or placebo. Results demonstrated that 
the 70 mg/kg/day was significantly beneficial compared to 
placebo with a permutation test utilizing the primary com-
ponents of the Fragile X Syndrome Rating Scale, a Fragile 
X Specific Domain Scale on a visual analogue format, and 
the  ABCFX.

In the fragile X knockout (KO), mouse studies trofinet-
ide had several positive effects at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day 
yielding insight as to why it is beneficial in FXS [139]. The 
KO mouse was deficient in IGF1 in the brain, and this was 
normalized with trofinetide treatment for 28 days. Improve-
ments in dendritic spine abnormalities, astrogliosis, neuro-
inflammation, glial activation, and downregulation of the 
MEK-ERK and PI3K-mTOR pathways were seen with tro-
finetide treatment leading to improvements in behavior and 
morphology of FXS [139]. Clearly, trofinetide is a treatment 
that improves multiple pathways that are dysregulated in 
more than one subtype of ASD and further studies at opti-
mal doses will be carried out and some are currently taking 
place.

Phosphordiasterase 4D Inhibitors

It has been known for many years that cAMP, an important 
energy compound for improving synaptic connections, is 
down regulated in FXS [140]. Recent animal studies have 
shown that an inhibitor of cAMP breakdown called a phos-
phordiasterase 4DE inhibitor can rescue features of FXS in 
the KO mouse model and Drosophila model and can raise 
the cAMP levels to normal [141, 142]. These studies led to 
patient trials of a PDE4D inhibitor called BPN14770, and 
an exciting study was recently published, a randomized con-
trolled trial in 30 adult males with FXS that demonstrated 
improvements not only in behavior but also in the primary 
outcome measure, the NIH toolbox, and secondary measures 
after only 12 weeks of treatment [143]. This is the first treat-
ment of FXS that demonstrated improvements in cognition, 
specifically in Oral Reading Recognition, Picture Vocabu-
lary and Cognition Crystallized Composite Score in the NIH 
toolbox that has been modified for use in those with ID. The 
caregivers also used the Visual Analog Caregiver Rating 
Scales and demonstrated improvement in language and daily

functioning. Families are excited that this is the first of hope-
fully many new medications that can reverse cognitive defi-
cits and further controlled trials are in the planning stages.

with anti-inflammatories with resolution of this side effect. 
The future is bright for further gene therapy interventions in 
ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Anavex 2–73

Anavex 2–73 (AV 2–73; Blarcamesine) is a sigma 1 receptor 
agonist that works between the endoplasmic reticulum and 
the mitochondrial membrane to normalize calcium dysregu-
lation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction which 
is seen in many forms of ASD. It has demonstrated signifi-
cant benefits in the KO mouse model of FXS where multiple 
behaviors were improved and deficient brain derived neuro-
tropic factor (BDNF) levels were normalized [144]. In addi-
tion, Kaufman et al. [145] also reported significant benefits 
in the Rett syndrome mouse model with a rescue of behavior 
and BDNF levels and this work lead to patient studies in Rett 
syndrome that have demonstrated efficacy in a controlled 
trial (Anavex Life Sciences press release 2021). AV2-73 also 
has beneficial effects in neurodegenerative disorders because 
of improvement in proteostasis, autophagy, oxidative stress, 
prevention of protein aggregates, and improvement in mito-
chondrial function leading to benefits in Alzheimer’ disease 
and Parkinson’s disease dementia [146–148]. Significant 
potential exists for AV2-73 to improve symptoms in Fragile 
X-associated Tremor Ataxia (FXTAS), a neurodegenera-
tive disease seen in approximately 40% of older carriers of 
the fragile X premutation, because calcium dysregulation, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, proteostasis, and aggregations of 
proteins causing inclusions occur in FXTAS [149].

Gene Therapy

Although this therapy is not available for clinicians to uti-
lize in their patients, exciting research studies particularly 
after the advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology have become 
available. The possibility of introducing a normal gene or 
protein into the CNS to treat ASD or other neurodevel-
opmental disorders where the mutation is known is excit-
ing. Another example of gene therapy is the introduction 
of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to silence RNA or 
gene products that are deleterious. In Angelman syndrome, 
where the maternal copy of UBE3A is mutated or absent, 
ASOs have been utilized to activate the paternal copy of 
UBE3A in the CNS to compensate for the missing maternal 
copy. Recently, a controlled trial of GTX-102, an ASO, was 
tried in 5 individuals with Angelman syndrome ages 5 to 
15 years old. The protocol involved the intrathecal injection 
of GTX-102 at increasing doses once monthly for 4 months. 
However, an adverse effect of leg weakness was seen at the 
higher doses leading to an inability to walk in two patients. 
This was found to be related to inflammation at the level 
where the LP was carried out so these patients were treated 

Conclusion

The  current  evidence-based  management  of  ASD  in 
children relies primarily on behavioral interventions to 
address  the  core  symptoms  of  the  condition.  The  role 
of pharmacological treatments currently is primarily to 
address co-morbid conditions associated with ASD and 
increases with age. These medications including anti- 
psychotic agents and stimulant medications are important in  
the clinical management of patients with ASD. However, 
the emergence of targeted treatments for subgroups of 
ASD where the genes responsible for the ASD are known 
and the neurobiology and potential targeted treatments 
have been studied to reverse the neurobiological abnor-
malities at least in the animal models has led to several 
recent achievements in patients as described here. Of note 
is that there are commonalities among disorders causing 
ASD that suggest that a targeted treatment for one disor-
der will be beneficial for other disorders. For instance, 
GABA deficits are seen in many forms of ASD and medi-
cations that are agonists for the GABA system such as 
CBD are likely to be helpful for many subtypes of ASD 
as described above. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associ-
ated with many forms of ASD, so medications that will 
improve mitochondrial dysfunction are likely to be help-
ful for many subtypes of ASD [150]. The promise of gene 
therapy is becoming a reality for many disorders such as 
Duchene Muscular Dystrophy, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, 
and even Angelman Syndrome because of CRISPR/Cas 
9 technology so in the next few years, many additional 
forms of ASD will be treated with gene therapy. Until 
then, some of the treatments outlined here can be tried 
and more will become available in the near future.
