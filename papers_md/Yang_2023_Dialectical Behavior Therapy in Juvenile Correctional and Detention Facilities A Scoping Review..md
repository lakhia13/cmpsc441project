Abstract
Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has shown preliminary success in the treatment of youth in forensic set-
tings. However, the implementation of DBT varies considerably from facility to facility. A scoping review was
conducted to detail DBT intervention protocols in juvenile correctional and detention facilities. We des-
cribed eight works’ treatment setting, study design, youth characteristics, staff training, DBT approach,
DBT skills modules, and main ﬁndings. All works involved DBT skills sessions, but few incorporated other
DBT components such as individual therapy or skills coaching. Outcomes included reducing problematic
behaviors such as aggression, improving mental health, and largely positive feedback regarding the DBT
intervention from youth and staff. Our results consolidate the existing literature regarding DBT intervention
in forensic settings for youth and inform future implementation and research of DBT in such facilities.

Introduction
Youth impacted by the juvenile legal system, particularly
those incarcerated in correctional facilities, have com-
plex mental health treatment needs. Detained youth
have a lifetime prevalence of up to 95% for mental health
disorders and 96% for substance use disorders (Borsch-
mann et al., 2020). However, only approximately 30%
of detained youth receive treatment (Underwood &
Washington, 2016).

Social determinants of health, such as structural ineq-
uity, family poverty, community violence, educational
inequity, and trauma, exacerbate factors that contribute

to youth incarceration and recidivism (Anoshiravani,
2020; Hughes et al., 2020). Secure facilities offer highly
structured settings to provide mental health treatment,
particularly comprehensive programs such as dialectical
behavior therapy (DBT).

Dialectical Behavior Therapy
DBT was initially developed to treat borderline person-
ality disorder by empowering clients to engage with
inner conﬂict, problem-solve, and enact change toward
more appropriate behaviors (Linehan, 1993, 2015). Since
its development, DBT has been used to manage various

clinical expressions of emotional dysregulation and has
been applied in juvenile forensic settings (Kenny et al.,
2020; Linehan, 2015; Nelson-Gray et al., 2006).

The standard comprehensive DBT program consists of
weekly group skills training, weekly individual therapy,
DBT phone coaching, and weekly therapist consulta-
tion team meetings for 1 year (Linehan, 1993). The
four core DBT skills modules, practiced in groups, are
mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and
interpersonal effectiveness. Individual therapy helps cli-
ents apply the learned skills within the context of their
overall clinical needs. Clients use phone coaching for
real-time skills coaching during challenging situations.
Therapy consultation team meetings support therapists
emotionally and educationally throughout the program.
Program homework, such as diary cards, helps clients
identify emotions and practice DBT skills in daily life.

The standard DBT program is comprehensive and
requires effective therapists, positive environmental
milieus, and strong patient–therapist relationships. For-
mal DBT training and supervision for therapists and
for proper DBT implementation
staff are critical
(Linehan & Wilks, 2015).

An adaptation for DBT in correctional settings (DBT–
Corrections Modiﬁed) has been described and utilized
with beneﬁt to emotion and behavior regulation and
recidivism for incarcerated youth (Nyamathi et al.,
2018; Shelton et al., 2011; Trestman et al., 2004).
DBT–Corrections Modiﬁed adaptations include modify-
ing the manual vocabulary and examples to be more
appropriate to the client’s education level and experi-
ences. The total duration of the program is also ﬂexible
to accommodate a facility’s duration of incarceration.

Tomlinson (2018) detailed DBT modiﬁcations in
forensic
risk-need-
settings worldwide using the
responsivity (RNR) model for reducing recidivism risk.
The RNR model outlined the importance of increased
DBT intensity for high-risk populations (e.g., people
charged with violent offenses), altered programs to target
‘‘criminogenic needs’’ (e.g., antisocial attitudes), and tai-
lored for individuals’ strengths (e.g., motivation). Tom-
linson found that alterations of DBT in forensic settings
are common due to each facility’s unique population
needs and organizational policies. They advised facilities
to adhere to the RNR model, which is consistent with best
practices in rehabilitation.

DBT has also been adapted for adolescents (DBT-A;
Rathus & Miller, 2014) to include as needed family ther-
apy, multifamily skills training group, and middle path
skills (e.g., ﬁnding balance between two seemingly oppo-
sites) that coincide with the mental health treatment
needs of incarcerated youth.

Incarcerated youth are in a developmentally critical
period and require special program modiﬁcations to
improve mental health outcomes and mitigate further

legal system involvement. During adolescence,
there
are rapid changes in brain areas associated with executive
functions such as response inhibition, risk-taking behav-
ior, and emotion regulation (Steinberg, 2005). Although
adolescents are more likely to engage in risky and delin-
quent behaviors, they are likely to grow out of delinquent
behavior as they transition into adulthood (Boyer, 2006;
Fagan & Western, 2005; Steinberg et al., 2015). Thus,
timely rehabilitation of children in juvenile forensic facil-
ities is paramount.

Current Study
Implementation of DBT in juvenile forensic settings may
be challenging due to underresourced facilities, lack of
staff, or uncertainty about how best to implement the pro-
gram (Fox & Whitt, 2008; Restum, 2005). Nonetheless,
juvenile correctional and detention facilities have adap-
ted DBT for their settings with varying success. Under-
standing the implementation science—the ‘‘study of
methods to promote adoption and integration of evidence-
based practices, interventions, and policies into routine
health care and public health settings to improve the
impact on population health’’—of these adaptations is
critical (National Cancer Institute, 2022).

This systematic narrative review of DBT programs in
juvenile forensic settings aims to understand implemen-
tation challenges and successes, and highlight its utility
in improving mental health and legal outcomes to inform
future work in this area.

Method
The PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-
ScR) was used to design and implement a systematic
search for publications evaluating DBT in juvenile foren-
sic settings (Tricco et al., 2018). The preliminary proto-
col was preregistered on the Open Science Framework
repository (https://osf.io/mrqb3/). A research librarian
searched query terms (Appendix A1) in ﬁve databases
(PsycINFO, PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Ofﬁce of
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Publica-
tions). Both peer-reviewed and nonpeer-reviewed pub-
lications (gray literature) were eligible for inclusion.

The study screening process was documented in a
PRISMA ﬂow chart (Fig. 1). Our literature search yielded
441 articles, of which 136 were removed as duplicates.
Three authors (P.Y., S.I.L., Z.B.) screened titles and
abstracts of the remaining 305 articles. To ensure reliabil-
ity, the authors ﬁrst collectively screened 10 articles. The
remaining articles were randomly assigned to the three
authors for independent screening to determine whether
they met inclusion criteria for full-text review. Inclusion
criteria included (a) sample of youth in a secure forensic
facility; (b) evaluation of DBT; and (c) examination of
mental, behavioral, or physical health outcomes. Articles
in languages other than English were excluded (n = 3).

search strategy.

When independent screeners were uncertain, articles
were collaboratively screened by at least two of the
three screeners. Of the 302 articles, 269 did not meet
inclusion criteria. Thirty-three articles (11%) were iden-
tiﬁed for full-text review by the same three authors. To
ensure reliability, all coders collectively reviewed three
articles. The remaining articles were randomly assigned
to two coders each for review. Full texts were reviewed
independently by two coders and discrepancies were
resolved collaboratively.

Twenty-six articles did not meet inclusion criteria
(secondary source n = 14; DBT not evaluated n = 6; sam-
ple did not contain youth n = 4; setting not a secure facil-
ity n = 2). Seven (21%) articles met inclusion criteria.
Bibliographies of 10 secondary sources (systematic
reviews, book chapters) identiﬁed during the search pro-
cess were reviewed, yielding one additional article for
inclusion. The overall total for the ﬁnal analysis was
eight articles.

Results
Study Characteristics
All eight studies were conducted in the United States and
published between 2002 and 2020 (Table 1). Six studies
involved long-term juvenile correctional facilities for
adjudicated delinquent youth and two involved short-
term juvenile detention facilities for preadjudicated
youth. Study designs were 13% cross-sectional and 87%

longitudinal. Sample sizes ranged from 4 to 1,031; 75%
of studies had a sample size of less than 50.

Two studies compared DBT with the facility’s stan-
dard treatment; the other six studies did not include a
comparison condition. Participating youth ranged from
11 to 21 years old. Three studies included only females,
three only males, and two included both sexes. Consistent
with the disproportionate representation of racial and eth-
nic minoritized youth in the juvenile legal system, Black
and Hispanic participants were overrepresented in study
samples compared with the general population (Harris
et al., 2009). A summary of key DBT components and
assessed outcomes can also be found in Table 2.

DBT Program Characteristics
All studies incorporated DBT models modiﬁed in timing
and/or components. All studies incorporated DBT skills
groups ranging from 30 to 90 minutes weekly to biweekly
for 12 to 40 weeks. Fox et al. (2020) did not specify the
length of intervention. Walden et al. (2019) implemented
self-contained skills training due to the average youth
detention period of 3 weeks.

Six of the seven studies that listed skills modules
included at least the four core modules: mindfulness,
emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and dis-
tress tolerance. Only Fox et al. (2020) implemented the
DBT-A ‘‘middle path’’ skill. Trupin et al. (2002) imple-
mented the ‘‘self-management’’ skill. Fasulo et al. (2015)

self-deﬁned three skills: managing the moment, building
coping strategies, and enhancing resiliency. Shelton et al.
(2009) did not specify which skills modules were used.
In Walden et al. (2019), mindfulness modules were deliv-
ered in between every module.

Four studies (50%) incorporated individual therapy
(Banks et al., 2015; Fox et al., 2020; Shelton et al.,
2009; Wakeman, 2010). Fox et al. (2020) involved
weekly individual DBT therapy. Individual therapy in
Banks et al. (2015) was part of the facility’s standard
treatment and did not necessarily involve a DBT thera-
pist. In Shelton et al. (2009), individual therapy took
place after the group skills, as opposed to concurrently
as described in the DBT manual (Linehan, 1993). In
Wakeman (2010), only a subset of youth, referred by
staff, received individual therapy.

Seven studies (88%) described staff training or team
consultation meetings; only Shelton et al. (2011) did
not. Fox et al. (2020), Trupin et al. (2002), and Wakeman
(2010) incorporated both preintervention training and
weekly or biweekly consultation meetings. Walden et al.
(2019) incorporated preintervention training and three
additional trainings 2, 6, and 12 months after the inter-
vention began. Banks et al. (2015) described weekly con-
sultation meetings, but not preintervention training. In
Fasulo et al. (2015), the clinicians were clinical psy-
chology students and received weekly supervision by a
licensed clinical psychologist and an academic faculty
member. Shelton et al. (2009) indicated staff were trained
but did not specify how.

Only Wakeman (2010) discussed phone coaching,
which was replaced by on-site skills coaching. Four stud-
ies (50%) described the use of diary cards where partici-
pants recorded their daily DBT skills use and behaviors,
emotions, or thoughts (Banks et al., 2015; Trupin et al.,
2002; Wakeman, 2010; Walden et al., 2019).

Youth Outcomes
Four studies assessed mental health-related outcomes
(Banks et al., 2015; Shelton et al., 2009, 2011; Wakeman,
2010). Wakeman (2010) described two evaluations of a
16-week DBT skills intervention (Ns = 8 and 38). Signiﬁ-
cant reductions in self-reported depression, anxiety, and
suicide risk scores, but not in staff-reported scores or
self-reported anger scores, were observed from pre- to
postintervention only in the second study (N = 38).

Shelton et al. (2009) found a signiﬁcant decrease in
the severity of psychopathy (Brief Psychiatric Rating
scale; Overall & Gorham, 1962) in the intervention
group (n = 22) compared with the standard-of-care con-
trol group (n = 16) from preintervention to the 6-month
follow-up; no changes in psychopathy were observed
from preintervention to immediately after the 16-week
skills group or at the 12-month follow-up.

Banks et al. (2015) found signiﬁcant improvement
in depression subscales (Beck Depression Inventory-II;
Beck et al., 1996) after
the 12-week intervention
(N = 9). Shelton et al. (2011) did not ﬁnd a difference
between negative or positive affect measures (Positive
and Negative Affect Scales; Watson et al., 1988).

Five studies assessed youth behavioral outcomes
(Banks et al., 2015; Fox et al., 2020; Shelton et al.,
2009, 2011; Trupin et al., 2002). Fox et al. (2020)
showed that youth who were exposed to more support-
ive DBT milieu management, but not more individual
therapy or skills group sessions, had reduced rates of
recidivism within 18 months of release (N = 1,031). Tru-
pin et al. (2002) found a reduction in composite behavior
problems in the mental health unit (n = 22) but not in the
general population unit (n = 23) during the 10-month
intervention. They also found a reduction in commu-
nity risk assessment scores in both groups 90 days after
intake.

Shelton et al. (2011) found a reduction in disciplin-
ary tickets after the intervention compared with a period
before the intervention (N = 26). Shelton et al. (2009) also
found a reduction in disciplinary tickets after the inter-
vention compared with 12 months prior, but not 6 months
after the intervention; the analysis sample included ado-
lescents and adults, ages 16–59 years. Shelton et al.
(2009, 2011) found reductions in physical aggression
(Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire; Buss & Perry,
1992) from pre- to postintervention, which was sustained
at follow-up (Shelton et al., 2009). Banks et al. (2015)
found a signiﬁcant improvement in internalizing but not
externalizing behaviors (Ohio Youth Scales; Ogles
et al., 2004) after the intervention.

Three studies assessed positive behaviors (Shelton
et al., 2009, 2011; Trupin et al., 2002). In Trupin et al.
(2002), youth in the mental health unit were more likely
to access rehabilitative services, such as completing a
general equivalency degree or drug and alcohol program,
during the DBT intervention compared with the year
prior. Shelton et al. (2011) found that participants were
more likely to use distancing as a coping strategy
(Ways of Coping Checklist; Folkman & Lazarus, 1988) im-
mediately after the intervention, whereas Shelton et al.
(2009) found that youth were more likely to use accepting
responsibility (Ways of Coping Checklist) at follow-up.

Two studies assessed DBT skills use (Fasulo et al.,
2015; Walden et al., 2019). Walden et al. (2019) found
a signiﬁcant increase in reported use of mindfulness, dis-
tress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion
regulation skills between intervention week 1 and week 3
(N = 113). They also reported signiﬁcantly greater use
of mindfulness skills compared with the other DBT
skills during the same period. In qualitative interviews
after the 12-week intervention, youth described situations
where they might use DBT skills but expressed difﬁculty

implementing the skills outside of group sessions. Fasulo
et al. (2015) qualitatively described four youths’ progres-
sion through and use of skills during 24 group sessions.

Staff Outcomes
One study evaluated the number of staff punitive actions
(e.g., room conﬁnement) during the intervention period in
the DBT mental health unit and the DBT general popula-
tion unit (Trupin et al., 2002). A reduction in punitive
action from mental health unit staff compared with previ-
ous nonintervention periods was observed. In the general
population unit, they found an increase in staff punitive
action during the intervention period.

Implementation Outcomes
Outcomes of implementation research are operational-
ized based on Proctor et al. (2011). Three studies evalu-
ated implementation outcomes of the adapted DBT
intervention (Banks et al., 2015; Wakeman, 2010;
Walden et al., 2019). In Banks et al. (2015), DBT imple-
mentation was considered feasible based on qualitative
interviews with staff group leaders on organization
factors, program factors, change agents, and staff
factors. Treatment providers described the helpfulness
of the structured DBT skills training manual and super-
vision.

In Walden et al. (2019), implementation suggested
challenges in acceptability and appropriateness. Youth
qualitatively described challenges with treatment buy-in
at the end of the intervention. Themes implied that engag-
ing in therapy was associated with weakness and utiliza-
tion of DBT skills during emotionally intense settings,
such as physical ﬁghts, was not practical.

Wakeman (2010) also highlighted challenges in imple-
mentation acceptability and appropriateness. Most par-
ticipants (95%) provided positive qualitative feedback
about the mindfulness skills groups, describing it as fun
and helpful, but also as lasting too long (75 minutes);
youth also noted skills were difﬁcult
to remember.
Youth skills group leaders (n = 6–10) completed Likert-
scale feedback surveys throughout the treatment. Overall,
leaders were dissatisﬁed with the intervention and did
not believe it helped youth, but expressed that they
enjoyed leading the groups.

Discussion
This systematic narrative review adds to the scientiﬁc
literature regarding effective mental health programs for
incarcerated youth and highlights the dearth of evidence
available about the use of DBT in youth correctional facil-
ities. Youth incarceration is a window of opportunity for
delivering much-needed mental health treatment, and it
is imperative that we optimize the use of the current puni-
tive correctional youth system while reducing the harm
this system inﬂicts on children, families, and communities.

Our review shows promising results about the effec-
tiveness of DBT in reducing mental health concerns
among incarcerated youth, reducing rates of recidivism,
and improving staff caregiving skills. Of note, Trupin
et al. (2002) demonstrated a decrease in the use of puni-
tive actions by staff during DBT use, though some studies
did not show a reduction in disciplinary actions after
DBT. Shelton et al. (2009, 2011) focused on youth with
impulsive behavior issues and demonstrated a decrease
in aggressive behaviors. Few programs incorporated a
comprehensive DBT program with all four core compo-
nents (i.e., group skills, individual therapy, peer consul-
tation, coaching); however, beneﬁts existed even for
programs that implemented group skills only.

Interestingly, DBT dosage did not vary considerably
between detention facilities and correctional facilities.
The two reviewed detention facilities implemented
12-week programs (Fasulo et al., 2015; Walden et al.,
2019). Most correctional facilities implemented 16-week
programs, with one program implementing a 12-week
program and one program implementing a 10-month pro-
gram. Unlike community settings, adapting DBT in foren-
sic settings requires consideration of the clients’ average
length of incarceration. One detention facility made each
session self-contained due to the short average length of
detention (approximately 3 weeks) at their facility so that
even youth who attended one session had the potential to
beneﬁt (Walden et al., 2019).

Adequate implementation of comprehensive DBT in
correctional facilities, and not just as stand-alone individ-
ual or group skills services, offers an opportunity to
address the interpersonal conﬂict that commonly occurs
among youth and between youth and staff. Some of the
studies included in our review highlight the importance
of equipping correctional staff with effective strate-
gies to support youth and minimize the use of restraints,
encourage effective communication, and reduce the
negative power dynamics that can arise in correctional
facilities.

Shifting the focus from solely treating youths’ mental
health to also creating social change in the way that staff,
clinicians, and other caregivers in these facilities interact
with youth can produce additional beneﬁts to the imple-
mentation of therapeutic interventions. For example,
Baetz et al. (2021) found that implementation of trauma-
informed practices in juvenile detention was helpful in
reducing the harm of incarceration only when (a) a
threshold number of youth were trained and (b) when
both youth and staff were trained.

DBT can empower correctional staff with nonpunitive
and effective caregiving skills that can improve commu-
nication, collaboration, and consistency among correc-
tional and clinical staff, ultimately empowering youth
with clinical and communication skills to improve their
self-advocacy abilities.

DBT IN JUVENILE FORENSICS SCOPING REVIEW

367

The reviewed articles described challenges associ-
ated with implementing DBT in juvenile forensic settings
as well as implementation strategies used to address chal-
lenges (Waltz et al., 2015). Commonly noted challenges
included cost of DBT implementation,
facility/staff
resources, youth buy-in, and postadjudication processes
(e.g.,
transfer, early release). Three of the reviewed
articles were led by graduate students and/or student
clinicians (Banks et al., 2015; Fasulo et al., 2015;
Wakeman, 2010). Lack of funding for DBT in the facil-
ities may have led well-meaning graduate students to
incorporate innovative DBT programs in these settings.
However, this may have led to the implementation of
novice therapy to incarcerated youth, who are some of
the most vulnerable members of society.

Other programs also noted challenges in youth buy-in,
which may have contributed to disruptive behavior dur-
ing group sessions (Wakeman, 2010; Walden et al.,
2019). Using the ‘‘engage consumers’’ strategies, clinicians
can integrate youth experiences, such as cultural identities
and life experiences,
to promote intervention buy-in
(Kaput, 2018). Fasulo et al. (2015) qualitatively described
the initial challenges in establishing rapport with the youth.
The clinicians used the ‘‘adapt and tailor to context’’ strat-
egy, for example by incorporating youth-requested music
to facilitate mindfulness exercises. Clinicians also inten-
tionally deemphasized change strategies due to the youths’
history of resisting attempts from authority to change their
behaviors and invalidate their experiences.

Few of the reviewed articles discussed quality metrics.
Fox et al. (2020) described challenges in standard-
ized quality control for individual counseling and skills
groups due to limited staff resources. Trupin et al.
(2002) described ﬁve times more DBT training to staff
working in the mental health unit than in the general pop-
ulation unit, muddying the interpretation of results due
to unequal staff training, but this may be an important
reminder of the type of ‘‘adapt and tailor to the context’’
strategy needed in youth correctional settings.

In summary, our review’s conclusions should be care-
fully examined as the existing evidence base is limited
in that most studies had small sample sizes of youth in
a single facility and used within-subjects designs without
control or active comparison conditions. Fully powered
samples and more rigorous designs (e.g., randomized
control trials) are needed.

Future directions in research assessing the effec-
tiveness of DBT in youth correctional facilities should
incorporate additional layers of cultural and structural
components that may be needed to increase the impact
of this intervention. For example, ensuring that trauma
is compassionately and effectively addressed is of
utmost importance to reduce the behaviors that tend to
result in aggression and recidivism (Kerig, 2019). Imple-
mentation of DBT must also take into consideration

that youth in correctional settings may have never
been exposed to mindfulness or overall mental health
awareness frameworks, as most children have not. Effec-
tive use of these skills requires culturally relevant appli-
cations that are codeveloped with youth voices.

Incorporating family members in the assessment and
treatment of incarcerated youth is also strongly recom-
mended by national advocacy efforts and is a component
of DBT-A, yet our review found only one publication
describing family involvement in treatment (Develop-
ment Services Group, 2018). Finally, future research
and policy must consider the social and monetary cost
of implementing therapeutic models in correctional set-
tings as opposed to nourishing communities with services
that keep youth in the community, enhance public safety,
and are less expensive than traditional services for this
population (Dopp et al., 2018).
