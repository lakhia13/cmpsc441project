Exposure therapy is a first-line, empirically validated treatment for anxiety, obsessive-
compulsive, and trauma-related disorders. Extinction learning is the predominant 
theoretical framework for exposure therapy, whereby repeated disconfirmation 
of a feared outcome yields fear reduction over time. Although this framework has 
strong  empirical  support  and  substantial  translational  utility,  extinction  learning 
is unlikely to be the sole process underlying the therapeutic effects of exposure 
therapy. In our clinic, we commonly treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
patients successfully with exposure therapy even when some or all of their feared 
outcomes are not amenable to disconfirmation and, by extension, to extinction 
learning.  Herein,  we  present  a  generic  clinical  vignette  illustrating  a  commonly 
encountered  feared  outcome  in  OCD  that  cannot  be  disconfirmed  through 
exposure  (damnation  resulting  from  blasphemous  thoughts).  We  describe  two 
specific  non-extinction-based  strategies  we  commonly  employ  in  such  cases, 
and  we  associate  these  strategies  with  known  change  mechanisms  that  might 
account for their effectiveness: (1) non-associative habituation to aversive stimuli, 
and  (2)  fear-memory  elicitation  and  subsequent  reconsolidation.  We  discuss 
the  limitations  inherent  in  the  reverse-translational  approach  taken  and  its 
opportunities for expanding the framework of exposure therapy.

1 Introduction

Exposure therapy is a first-line behavioral treatment for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, 
and trauma-related disorders that involves repeated contact with feared stimuli, contexts, and 
scenarios (Foa and McLean, 2016; Reid et al., 2021; McLean et al., 2022). Exposure procedures 
were largely inspired by a cross-species classical conditioning literature showing that acquired 
threat  responses  can  be  ‘extinguished’  when  threat  cues  (conditioned  stimuli,  CS+)  are 
repeatedly experienced in the absence of an anticipated aversive outcome (unconditioned 
stimulus, US; Figure 1, column A) (Graham and Milad, 2011).

Although extinction (Table 1) is the prevailing theoretical framework for exposure-based 
therapy practices (Foa and McLean, 2016; Craske et al., 2022), there is increasing recognition 
that  additional  psychological  change  processes  contribute  to  the  therapeutic  effects  of 
exposure. For decades, experimental researchers have voiced concerns about the translational

FIGURE 1
(A) In a traditional laboratory extinction paradigm, the initial appraisal that a neutral stimulus (blue square) will be followed by an aversive outcome 
(shock) is usually acquired through conditioning. Repeated exposure to the blue square without shock is expected to result in new experiential learning 
in the form of extinction, evidenced by declining fear responses. (B) In a common presentation of OCD, repeatedly touching the bathroom doorknob 
would lead to extinction if the patient expects an aversive outcome and unambiguously does not experience it. (C) In another common presentation 
of OCD, fears of causing harm are readily disconfirmed through repeated exposures to the perceived “dangerous” situation. Of note, the patient may 
still harbor additional fears about the meaning of his thoughts, which would not be directly disconfirmed through the exposure described. (D) The 
feared outcome of going to Hell after death cannot be disconfirmed through exposure; a patient would be unlikely to experience extinction of this 
core fear. The patient’s fears about the meaning of her thoughts are also unlikely to be disconfirmed through simply omitting the compulsive ritual.

limitations of experimental paradigms that model extinction learning 
(Rachman, 1977; Poulton and Menzies, 2002; Mineka and Zinbarg, 
2006;  De  Houwer,  2020)  and  avoidance  (Krypotos  et  al.,  2015). 
Echoing these concerns in the domain of clinical fear reduction, recent 
reviews  have  advised  experimental  researchers  to  “mind  the  gap” 
between fear reduction through extinction in the laboratory and the 
treatment of fear through exposure in the clinic (Carpenter et al., 
2019)  and  urged  the  development  of  refined  therapeutic  models 
(Chowdhury  and  Khandoker,  2022;  Nihei  et  al.,  2023).  Notably, 
Craske et al. (2008) suggested that, in addition to extinction learning, 
investigators  should  consider  “other  clinically  relevant  cognitive-
emotional  processes”  that  contribute  to  the  beneficial  effects  of 
exposure  therapy.  A  central  conclusion  of  these  reviews  is  well-
captured by Kredlow et al. (2022) who noted that “…many factors that 
are  central  to  exposure  therapy  in  the  clinic  are  not  sufficiently 
modeled in the laboratory.”

These concerns align with our experience as practicing behavioral 
therapists  who  treat  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  with 
exposure and response prevention (ExRP). Our experience supports 
the conclusion that the extinction learning framework is insufficient to 
fully account for the therapeutic change brought about by successful 
exposure  therapy.  Taken  together  with  the  assertion  (Abramowitz, 
2013)  that  the  practice  of  exposure  therapy  benefits  from  a  solid 
understanding of the underlying theory, this conclusion points to a 

need to re-examine the extinction learning model alongside clinical 
insights, empirical evidence, and alternative models. This is particularly 
evident in a subset of our patients who present with fears that are not 
formally amenable to extinction learning, because the occurrence of 
their feared outcome(s) cannot be disconfirmed through exposure.

Under the extinction learning model, fear reduction occurs when a 
negative expectancy is repeatedly disconfirmed through experience. 
This model neatly accounts for the success of exposure therapy in many 
instances. Consider the classic OCD presentation of patients who fear 
they will become sick and vomit shortly after touching a presumably 
contaminated surface such as a public bathroom door handle, and who 
avoid touching such surfaces whenever possible and wash excessively 
following any contact with them. In response to these fears, the patient 
avoids touching such surfaces whenever possible and washes excessively 
following any contact with them. As illustrated in Figure 1 (column B), 
treatment  for  such  a  patient  would  entail  touching  bathroom  door 
handles (and other public surfaces) without washing. Repeating this 
exercise in the absence of both illness and compulsive washing induces 
extinction learning, such that the patient no longer expects that illness 
will result from contact with objects in public spaces.

We also frequently treat patients whose symptoms do not lend 
themselves  to  an  extinction  learning  framework,  or  do  so  only 
partially. Consider another common OCD presentation: patients who 
experience intrusive thoughts of harming loved ones and who, as a

Extinction

A decline in fear, or a change in threat-

related behavior, caused by the repeated 

disconfirmation of an expected negative 

outcome. Includes classical extinction, in 

which a feared stimulus is confronted in 

the absence of an aversive stimulus 

expected to accompany it, and operant 

extinction, in which a feared behavior (or 

omission of a safety behavior) is 

performed in the absence of an expected 

aversive outcome. This can take place 

regardless of whether the original fear 

association was acquired through 

thoughts and images of eternal damnation – are common in OCD and 
used here to illustrate our exposure treatment approach in such cases. 
We chose this vignette to highlight a situation where the importance 
of considering non-extinction-based approaches is particularly clear; 
i.e.,  when  the  primary  fear  allows  for  little  or  no  disconfirmation 
through  exposure.  Following  this,  we  describe  two  putative 
mechanisms, grounded in existing empirical and theoretical literature, 
that  map  onto  the  therapeutic  action  of  the  non-extinction-based 
interventions we describe.

result, avoid approaching loved ones and experience intense guilt and 
shame for having these aggressive thoughts: e.g., “I must be a terrible 
person.” Repeated exposure exercises in which the patient stands near 
their loved one without causing harm, perhaps while holding a kitchen 
knife  or  other  potentially  dangerous  items,  should  disconfirm  the 
feared  outcome  and,  hence,  lead  to  extinction  of  the  association 
between having harm-related thoughts and engaging in harm-related 
behaviors. However, the patient’s disturbing interpretation of their 
intrusive thoughts (e.g., “I must be a terrible person”) is not amenable 
to disconfirmation through exposure (Figure 1, column C).

While  patients  who  fear  that  they  will  cause  harm  would 
be expected to obtain partial relief through extinction learning, other 
patients  that  we  frequently  encounter  would  not.  Consider,  for 
example, patients with religious scrupulosity symptoms who fear that 
their intrusive blasphemous thoughts, in the absence of a prayer ritual, 
will result in damnation after death (Figure 1, column D). Because the 
primary  feared  outcome  is  expected  to  occur  after  death,  it  is  not 
amenable  to  disconfirmation  and,  hence,  cannot  be  extinguished 
through exposure. Such patients might also harbor fear and uncertainty 
(Morriss et al., 2021) about the meaning of these thoughts; these fears 
would also not be amenable to disconfirmation through exposure.

As  practicing  behavioral  therapists  who  primarily  treat  OCD 
through ExRP, we have developed several strategies for treating patients’ 
feared  outcomes  that  cannot  be  disconfirmed  through  exposure. 
Refining these approaches over years of practice to address a clinical 
need  has  stimulated  our  thinking  about  the  therapeutic  processes 
involved in exposure therapy more broadly. This has evolved into the 
present reverse translational endeavor in which we attempt to formalize 
our non-extinction-based techniques, and relate them to the existing 
theoretical and empirical literature. More specifically, we integrate the 
extinction framework with propositional expectancy theory (Lovibond, 
2006), which describes experiential and non-experiential sources of 
learning, and emotional processing theory (Rachman, 1980; Foa and 
Kozak, 1986), which posits a “fear structure” that can be altered through 
strategic methods of incorporating corrective information.

To contextualize the issues and techniques introduced, we describe 
a clinical vignette (Box 1) representing a composite of many cases 
treated in our clinic, as a generic case description. The symptoms 
described  –  ego  dystonic  blasphemous  thoughts  associated  with 

Frontiers in Psychology

03

The patient reports daily ego dystonic sacrilegious thoughts and images. The 

patient  reports  reciting  an  idiosyncratic  prayer  to  neutralize  the  negative 

consequences  of  having  committed  blasphemy.  The  prayer  is  only  partially 

effective  in  alleviating  the  fears  since  the  patient  believes  that  having  these 

thoughts and images may indicate a sinful nature deserving damnation even with 

the ritualized prayer.

Imaginal Exposure to Blasphemous Thoughts

Based on a detailed clinical interview, the therapist develops a hierarchy of 

exposure  exercises  with  ritual  prevention  and  provides  the  patient  with  a 

description of the treatment.

The therapist obtains the patient’s agreement to make an audio recording of 

the imaginal exposure narrative so that they can repeat the exercise outside of 

the session (“homework”).

In the exposure, the therapist describes specific blasphemous thoughts and 

describes specific scenes of being damned as a result, both of which are based on 

details obtained from the patient in the pre-treatment interview. The patient is 

asked to repeat some of the specific blasphemous statements in the narration and 

to occasionally rate their degree of discomfort.

Introduction of New Information

After  about  five  minutes  of  narration  during  which  the  patient’s  fears  are 

strongly activated (as indexed by subjective ratings), the therapist introduces new 

information meant to challenge and modify the patient’s interpretation (meaning) 

of the upsetting thoughts. After confirming that the patient believes that having 

blasphemous thoughts means they are sinful and deserving of damnation, the 

therapist offers an alternative interpretation along the following lines.

“You’ve said you fear that your upsetting thoughts mean you are inherently 

sinful and deserving of damnation, but it seems you’ve never considered that 

they could be a sign of just how much you despise damnation and love God. 

This view is easier to understand if you consider how the brain’s primitive 

safety system operates. This brain system – we can call it your ‘safety brain’ 

– tries to keep you from doing dangerous things by showing you the terrible 

consequences these things can cause. It’s like your brain shows you a horrible 

movie to motivate you to avoid these bad outcomes. This sort of process is not 

uncommon. For example, many people report that when they are walking 

near the edge of a cliff or a bridge, they have a vivid image of their jumping 

off,  flying  through  the  air  in  terror,  and  hitting  the  ground  where  they 

experience  horrible  pain  just  before  death.  This  seems  very  strange  and 

upsetting until you consider what these upsetting thoughts cause the person 

frontiersin.orgBerg et al. 

10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1331155

to do. They cause the person to move away from the edge so they won’t fall! 

From this viewpoint, damnation is your personal, spiritual cliff, and your 

brain plays a scary movie to help keep you from falling off.

“Now I’d like you to do your best to restate what I just said about the safety-

brain and how it relates to your upsetting thoughts about damnation and 

Hell. Even if you’re unsure what you believe, do your best to make the same 

case I just made, but in your own words.”

Repeat Imaginal Exposure to Blasphemous Thoughts

The therapist repeats the imaginal exposure.

Homework

The patient is instructed to listen to the entire audiotape of the exposure 

session  (including  new  information)  twice  daily  while  recording  subjective 

distress and degree of perceived sinfulness indicated by having blasphemous 

thoughts before and after each listening exercise. The patient is instructed to 

avoid saying the ritual prayer and to record any instances where this happens.

2 Putative non-extinction processes

The clinical vignette describes a common course of treatment in 
our OCD clinic, which includes: (1) repeated exposure to available 
elements of the feared outcome (e.g., being consigned to Hell), fear 
triggers (e.g., blasphemous statements) and response prevention (no 
forgiveness  prayer),  and  (2)  introduction  of  new  information 
regarding  the  meaning  of  the  patient’s  obsessive  fears  that  occurs 
during the exposure. Note that these intervention steps did nothing to 
disconfirm  the  patient’s  core  fear  of  being  consigned  to  Hell  after 
death. In this section, we discuss two psychological therapeutic change 
processes putatively engaged by these procedures, and their potential 
relevance for exposure therapy across a broad range of cases.

2.1 Non-associative habituation

Nothing about the intervention described in the vignette could 
have demonstrated that blasphemous thoughts do or do not result in 
damnation  after  death.  As  such,  it  is  reasonable  to  assert  that 
extinction  learning  concerning  the  association  of  blasphemous 
thoughts with damnation would not account for any clinical benefit 
obtained  (Note  that  while  the  case  described  is  generic,  we  have 
commonly  treated  successfully  similar  cases  in  our  clinic).  In  the 
absence of extinction learning, a potential driver of fear reduction 
through exposure to the feared outcome (in imagination, in this case) 
is  non-associative  habituation1,  also  known  as  single-stimulus 

1  Of note, the term “habituation” has been used elsewhere to refer broadly 

to  fear  decrements  during  exposures  (e.g.,  Seligman  and  Johnston,  1973; 

Jacoby and Abramowitz, 2016), both within and between exposures, which 

habituation,  a  process  by  which  physiological  and  psychological 
reactions  to  an  evocative  stimulus  attenuate  with  repeated 
presentations (Table 1). Whereas repeated presentation of a learned 
threat-cue in the absence of the expected aversive outcome leads to an 
associative decrement in fear via extinction learning, the repeated 
presentation of the aversive stimulus itself can lead to non-associative 
habituation of fear responding. Thus, when exposure exercises involve 
repeated presentations of an aversive stimulus (note, this could include 
either fear triggers or the feared outcome itself), a decrease in the 
patient’s  reactivity  to  the  aversive  stimulus  across  repeated 
presentations  would  be  expected  to  occur  via  non-associative 
habituation (see also: Kredlow et al., 2022).

The  vignette  illustrates  how  we  have  modified  our  practice  of 
ExRP to promote fear reduction via non-associative habituation. Not 
only does the imaginal exposure include the presumed fear triggers 
(blasphemous thoughts), it also includes imaginal elements of the 
feared  outcome  (e.g.,  the  actual  experience  of  being  in  Hell  after 
death). This is likely to elicit high levels of fear while also forcing the 
patient to confront the certainty or uncertainty of damnation after 
death;  prior  to  omitting  the  forgiveness  prayer,  the  certainty  of 
damnation would have remained a hypothetical question only. In our 
practice,  this  potent  combination  of  aversive  experiences  –  an 
imagined  experience  of  damnation,  and  the  possibility  of  actual 
damnation in the future – is repeatedly presented to the patient with 
the  expectation  that  both  will  become  less  aversive  with  repeated 
presentations due to non-associative habituation.

It is important to note that this practice (i.e., exposure and ritual 
prevention in the absence of disconfirmation of the feared outcome), 
while common in our clinical practice and likely others’, is inconsistent 
with a purely extinction-based model, given that extinction learning 
requires presentation of the presumed CS+ while explicitly withholding 
the presumed US (see Figure 1, column A). The principle that exposure 
to  feared  outcomes  and  triggers  –  in-vivo  or  in  imagination  –  can 
reduce  the  intensity  of  fear  responding,  even  in  the  absence  of 
disconfirmation, crucially informs exposure planning in many cases. 
The imaginal exposure exercise is designed to closely approximate the 
feared outcome itself, and constitutes a highly aversive experience of 
images, thoughts, and emotions associated with this outcome.

In  this  conceptualization  of  exposure,  there  is  still  room  for 
extinction learning where expectations are violated. For example, if 
the patient over-estimates the level of distress the imaginal exposure 
would  produce,  therapeutic  benefit  via  extinction  learning  would 
be expected (Jacoby and Abramowitz, 2016). In many cases, however, 
the patient instead makes correct predictions about the initial distress 
level of the imaginal exposure. Over multiple exposures to the feared 
outcome (in imagination in this case), non-associative habituation 
should lead the patient to experience decreasing aversiveness, which 
could then serve as an expectancy violation promoting extinction 
learning.  For  example,  the  patient  might  initially  predict  that  the 
imaginal  exposure  will  be  highly  uncomfortable,  or  that  the 
uncertainty  will  be  very  difficult  to  tolerate,  and  then  find  this  to 
be true in the first several exposure exercises. After repeated exposures, 
the  patient  might  find  that  the  images,  and/or  the  accompanying 

can include both associative and non-associative elements. Here, however, 

aversive stimulus responses that are not attributable to any change in the 

we refer specifically to non-associative habituation; that is, decrements in 

stimulus’s association with other stimuli.

uncertainty,  are  newly  tolerable. This  could  pave  the  way  for  new 
extinction learning about the tolerability of feared thoughts or images 
(e.g.,  Jacoby  and  Abramowitz,  2016)  or  about  the  tolerability  of 
uncertainty  (e.g.,  Dugas  et  al.,  2022).  Importantly,  however, 
non-associative habituation would still serve as the necessary first 
ingredient in obtaining this result.

2.2 Leveraging exposures to incorporate 
new therapeutic information

Extinction  learning  provides  corrective  information,  acquired 
through experience, which therapeutically modifies a fear association; 
i.e., that the feared outcome does not follow the presentation of the 
fear trigger, even in the absence of rituals. We posit here that corrective 
information  may  also  be  introduced  through  non-experiential 
semantic or informational learning in the context of exposure. The 
vignette  illustrates  an  example  of  this:  the  therapist  provides 
information  aimed  at  generating  a  competing  non-fear  inducing 
interpretation of the meaning of the patient’s intrusive thoughts; i.e., 
that the intrusive thoughts of being consigned to Hell represent the 
brain’s effort to deter the patient from sin rather than constituting a 
sin itself. This viewpoint is in line with several established theoretical 
accounts that acknowledge a role for both experiential and semantic 
learning in the acquisition of threat and safety contingencies: e.g., 
Lovibond (2006) propositional expectancy model (an extension of 
Seligman and Johnston (1973) cognitive learning model), in which 
learning represents an accumulation of propositional knowledge that 
may be acquired via multiple means. According to this model, in the 
vignette,  modification  of  the  patient’s  obsessional  belief  could 
be  achieved  through  a  combination  of  semantic  learning  (e.g., 
conveying  through  language  that  blasphemous  thoughts  in  the 
absence of a ritual might not guarantee damnation), and experiential 
learning  (e.g.,  the  patient  experiencing  that  they  can  tolerate  the 
distress associated with exposures). Moreover, findings show that new 
information is more memorable when presented in an emotionally 
evocative context (Christianson, 1992; Holland and Kensinger, 2010) 
and that affective arousal during therapy sessions is a key predictor of 
psychotherapy efficacy (Frank and Frank, 1993; David and Szentagotai, 
2006;  Markowitz  and  Milrod,  2011),  suggesting  that  exposure 
exercises may offer a particularly fruitful opportunity for conveying 
therapeutic information.

The practice of leveraging emotional arousal during exposures to 
enable therapeutic learning can also be aligned with Foa and Kozak’s 
(1986) emotional processing theory, as well as recent findings and 
theory related to memory reconsolidation. Regarding the former, Foa 
and Kozak (1986) cite evidence that fear excitation during and just 
after exposures is a critical pre-requisite to successful exposure, and 
they theorize that this is required for the incorporation of corrective 
information into the patient’s pathological “fear structure.” (The fear 
structure is conceptualized as an interconnecting network of stored 
information  about  feared  stimuli,  outcomes,  responses,  and  their 
meaning.) In line with this, memory reconsolidation theory [review: 
(Lee et al., 2017); though see also: (Schroyens et al., 2023)] holds that 
established memories are uniquely amenable to modification during 
their reactivation (or retrieval) into working memory. Specifically, 
reactivation of a stored memory is thought to induce a brief labile 
period, lasting seconds to hours, during which new information may

05

be incorporated with the original memory upon reconsolidation of 
the activated memory (Lewis, 1979; Nader, 2003).

In  our  clinical  vignette,  the  therapist  verbally  conveys  new 
therapeutic information about the meaning of the patient’s obsessional 
content, including: (a) the perspective that intrusive thoughts stem 
from the brain’s “primitive warning system” to prevent rather than 
promote harmful outcomes (damnation, in this case); and, (b) the 
consistency of this therapeutic meaning with past experience (ego 
dystonic images of jumping off a bridge to induce moving away from 
the  edge  for  safety).  The  therapist  provides  this  new  therapeutic 
information at a targeted moment: just after the patient completes the 
first iteration of the imaginal exposure and is experiencing strong 
emotional  arousal,  and  just  prior  to  a  repetition  of  the  imaginal 
exposure. This timing is meant to ensure that the new information is 
introduced during the labile period brought about via reactivation of 
the fear structure. Thus, the therapist induces and then capitalizes on 
a period of fear-related memory instability as a means of introducing 
new 
into  the  fear  memory  network  prior  to 
reconsolidation into long-term memory.

information 

The practice of introducing corrective information in the context 
of  exposure  must  include  several  considerations.  Introducing  such 
information too early in the exposure exercise may prevent the patient 
from reaching and maintaining sufficient emotional arousal for the 
established fear structure to be adequately activated and labile, thus 
inhibiting  the 
information  via 
integration  of  the  corrective 
reconsolidation into long-term memory. On the other hand, simply 
activating the fear memory while conveying little or no new corrective 
information (e.g., devoid of both disconfirmation and other therapeutic 
information) risks leaving the pathological fear structure largely intact 
upon  its  reconsolidation. This  could  pose  an  ethically  problematic 
scenario  in  which  the  patient  would  be  made  upset  through  the 
exposure while achieving no fundamental therapeutic change.

that 

indicated 

It  is  important  to  note  distinctions  between  the  approach 
described here and conventional cognitive restructuring, a commonly 
used technique for addressing distorted or inaccurate beliefs. To date, 
cognitive restructuring techniques, i.e., identifying and challenging 
faulty  appraisals,  have  been  emphasized  as  a  treatment  modality 
distinct from exposure (Kaczkurkin and Foa, 2022) or as a component 
of post-exposure processing (McLean and Foa, 2013). Clinical trials 
have 
traditional  cognitive  restructuring  can 
be moderately helpful in the treatment of OCD (Freeston et al., 1997; 
McLean et al., 2001), but add no advantage in terms of treatment 
efficiency (Vogel et al., 2004). Importantly, the technique illustrated in 
our  vignette  differs  in  key  ways  from  traditional  cognitive 
restructuring,  as  well  as  from  post-exposure  processing.  First, 
we position the introduction of therapeutic information within the 
ongoing exposure to promote its incorporation into the fear memory 
structure upon reconsolidation. This can be contrasted with traditional 
cognitive restructuring and post-exposure processing, which occur 
outside  of  exposure.  Our  approach  is  further  distinguished  from 
traditional cognitive restructuring and post-exposure processing in 
the extent to which the therapist is responsible for the content of the 
new information provided. We view the generation of therapeutic 
content  in  this  context  to  be  uniquely  within  the  purview  of  the 
trained therapist’s expertise, unlike traditional Socratic questioning 
methods which eschew therapist-generated interpretations. In our 
vignette,  for  example,  the  patient  is  not  expected  to  generate  the 
alternative meaning of symptoms provided by the therapist.

It  has  also  been  documented  that  efforts  at  inducing  cognitive 
change during an exposure that provide reassurance to the patient can 
interfere with therapeutic progress by blocking direct exposure to the 
feared  situation  and  its  accompanying  uncertainty  (Gillihan  et  al., 
2012).  In  our  vignette,  the  therapist  is  careful  to  inject  the  new 
information only at the key moment when fears are fully activated 
during exposure. The therapist then repeats the exposure after having 
introduced  the  new  therapeutic  information.  Crucially,  the  new 
therapeutic information is structured to avoid frank reassurance; i.e., it 
does not include statements such as “You will not go to Hell,” or “There 
is no Hell.” Rather, the therapist aims to provide a plausible alternative 
meaning  for  the  patient’s  blasphemous  thoughts.  It  would  also 
be important for the therapist to not respond to requests for reassurance 
the patient might make (e.g., “Are you sure that having these thoughts 
aren’t a sin?”). These steps are designed to prevent the new information 
from serving as reassurance that blocks therapeutic gains.

3 Discussion

In  our  practice  of  treating  OCD  through  exposure  therapy, 
we  have  developed  and  successfully  used  strategies  designed  to 
leverage psychological processes in addition to extinction learning, 
especially (but not exclusively) for patients whose primary fears are 
not amenable to disconfirmation. As described here, we assert that 
the success of these strategies is not accounted for by traditional 
extinction-focused formulations, which requires disconfirmation of 
the  feared  outcome.  Based  on  this  and  our  success  in  treating 
patients whose feared outcomes cannot be disconfirmed, we argue 
that an exclusive focus on extinction learning in conceptualizing 
and  executing  exposure  interventions  fails  to  harness  the  full 
potential  of  this  therapeutic  tool.  Figure  2  summarizes  our 

expanded view of exposure therapy’s efficacy, listing the various 
processes, in addition to extinction learning, that may lead to fear 
reduction resulting from exposure.

In this paper, we describe two non-extinction based practices that 
we have routinely and successfully employed in our clinic. The first of 
these  entails  the  repeated  exposure  to  fear  triggers  and  feared 
outcomes  (whether  in-vivo  or  in  imagination)  in  the  absence  of 
disconfirmation of the feared outcome and rituals. Non-associative 
habituation (i.e., decrements in the intensity of stimulus responses 
with repeated presentations) provides a known mechanism that can 
explain the efficacy of this therapeutic practice. The second is the 
practice  of  strategically  conveying  therapeutic  information  to  the 
patient  during  exposure  with  the  goal  of  incorporating  this  new 
therapeutic information into the exposure-activated fear structure 
upon its reconsolidation into long-term memory storage.

While we have focused in this paper on a common presentation 
of OCD that underscores the limitations of the extinction model and 
illustrates our non-extinction strategies, we believe these strategies 
could be beneficial in treating a wide range of patient presentations, 
even  when  some  degree  of  disconfirmation  through  exposure  is 
feasible (e.g., see Figure 1, column C), in OCD and other conditions. 
For example, a patient with social anxiety disorder who fears public 
speaking might experience disconfirmation of some feared outcomes 
through exposure (e.g., “I will pass out”), but not others (e.g., “the 
audience believes I am terrible at my job”). We posit that such a case 
would benefit from the introduction of new therapeutic information 
in the context of fear activation through exposure (e.g., “your brain 
imagines these feared scenarios not because they are highly likely, but 
because  you  care  deeply  about  preventing  them”).  As  the  patient 
advances from imaginal exposure to in vivo exposures, the patient and 
therapist might collaborate on ways for the patient to retrieve the new 
information at key moments during the exposure, deepening the new 

FIGURE 2
The traditional framework centers on extinction learning as a means to fear reduction. Our expanded framework includes extinction learning as one of 
many mechanisms by which exposure therapy can bring about fear reduction.

memory  structure.  These  strategies  could  be  applied  alongside 
traditional exposure techniques that target extinction learning.

Existing  experimental  paradigms  that  elicit  non-associative 
habituation  (e.g.,  Harris,  1943)  and  memory  modification  in  the 
process of reconsolidation (e.g., Nader et al., 2000) can be used to test 
these strategies. Experimental research, for example, could investigate 
lab-based  analogues  for  these  exposure  strategies  as  a  means  of 
informing  the  continued  development  and  refinement  of  clinical 
techniques. Research with human participants rather than non-human 
animals  is  of  particular  value  in  this  area,  especially  in  terms  of 
studying the effects of semantic learning in the context of exposure. 
For example, clinical trials could investigate whether strategic delivery 
of  therapeutic  information  during  an  exposure  strengthens  (as 
we  suggest  it  should)  or  weakens  (as  inhibitory  learning  theories 
presumably suggest) the effectiveness of exposure.

3.1 Limitations

As a reverse translational endeavor, this work seeks to inspire new 
ideas  and  research  stemming  from  our  clinical  experience  and 
practices. As such, we cannot make strong empirical claims as to the 
validity  of  our  conjectures.  The  “bedside-to-bench”  trajectory  of 
discovery has a history of advancing medical science (Moore, 2008; 
Shakhnovich, 2018; Wagner, 2018), including psychiatry (Malkesman 
et  al.,  2009;  Daniels  et  al.,  2020),  but  this  depends  on  subsequent 
empirical  investigation  of  the  treatment  targets  and  therapeutic 
techniques proposed. The clinical utility of the ideas presented here 
thus remains to be empirically tested. Another limitation of this work 
is  its  narrow  focus  on  two  specific  clinical  processes  underlying 
non-extinction-based effects of exposure therapy. We believe it is likely 
that that other non-extinction processes warrant elaboration and closer 
inquiry. For example, exposure in the absence of disconfirmation of the 
feared outcome could induce cognitive dissonance that is resolved in 
part  by  reassessing  either  the  likelihood  or  severity  of  the  feared 
outcome. Exposure with response prevention could also induce learned 
helplessness concerning the feared outcome; i.e., the acceptance of the 
lack of control over feared outcome. These and other non-extinction 
processes warrant empirical investigation regarding their potential role 
in clinical fear reduction.

i.e., 

those  whose 

with patients for whom extinction learning is definitionally limited 
or  precluded; 
feared  outcomes  cannot 
be disconfirmed in the context of exposure. A continued effort to 
advance  the  framework  for  exposure  therapy’s  mechanisms  of 
action, through experimental research and clinical development, 
holds  promise  to  improve  clinical  outcomes.  We  hope  that  the 
clinical observations and ideas outlined in this paper can be used 
to inform the field, improve the efficacy of clinical practice and spur 
new empirical research.

3.2 Conclusion

Publisher’s note

A  successful  course  of  exposure  treatment  can  yield  life-
changing  symptom  relief,  whereas  an  unsuccessful  course  of 
treatment  can  leave  patients  frustrated,  confused,  and  even 
discouraged from pursuing future mental health care. We describe 
specific techniques and putative mechanisms of change which may 
be related to positive therapeutic outcomes in exposure therapy
