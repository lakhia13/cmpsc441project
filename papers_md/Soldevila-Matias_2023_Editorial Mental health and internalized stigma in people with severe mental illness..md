Editorial on the Research Topic
Mental health and internalized stigma in people with severe mental illness

Introduction

According to WHO, around the world in 2019, ∼970 million people, or one in eight
individuals, were aﬀected by a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders being
the most prevalent. Despite the progress in the understanding and treatment of mental
illness, stigma remains a signiﬁcant barrier to care and recovery for people with severe
mental illness (1). Stigma is a social phenomenon characterized by negative attitudes, beliefs,
and stereotypes toward individuals or groups based on perceived diﬀerences (2). Stigma can
lead to discrimination, social exclusion, and internalized shame, resulting in a signiﬁcant
negative impact on mental health outcomes (3). In this article collection composing this
unique Frontiers Research Topic, bring together experimental and theoretical research,
linking state-of-the-art knowledge about severe mental illnesses with the phenomena of
internalized stigma.

The paper by Sportel et al. aimed to investigate the presence of self-stigma and
impaired cognitive insight in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis,
compared to individuals diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) and
general population controls (GPC). A total of 184 participants were recruited and divided
into three groups: individuals diagnosed with a SSD (n = 92), individuals at UHR (n = 43)
and healthy controls (n = 49). The study found that self-stigma was present in individuals
at UHR to a similar degree as in individuals with SSD, and that high cognitive insight was
associated with high levels of self-stigma. Authors suggest that early interventions targeting
self-stigma and considering cognitive insight are needed in the UHR phase to prevent the
manifestation of psychotic illness.

Stuetzle et al. discuss the self-stigma of mental health professionals who have had
experiences of mental crisis and treatment. A survey was conducted on 182 mental health
professionals from 18 psychiatric hospital departments in Berlin and Brandenburg. The
results showed low levels of self-stigma and perceived public stigma in the workplace.

However, self-stigma was positively associated with workplace
stigma and subjective vulnerability to crisis but not with
identiﬁcation with lived experiences. The
suggests
investigating the relationship between self-stigma, workplace
stigma, and vulnerability to derive possible strategies to reduce self-
stigma and its detrimental eﬀects. The limitations of the study are
also discussed, including the possibility that highly self-stigmatizing
individuals may have been discouraged from participating.

article

Hao et al. aimed to examine stigmatizing attitudes toward
depression, schizophrenia, and general anxiety disorder (GAD)
among caregivers of patients with mental disorders in China.
The researchers used vignettes to describe the mental illnesses
and collected data on caregivers’ attitudes toward individuals with
mental disorders, other people’s attitudes, and willingness to meet
them. The study found that while positive outcomes were expected
in all three vignettes, the top two endorsements of stigma were
that the person could snap out of the problem and people with
this problem are dangerous. Caregivers in the GAD vignette agreed
more than most other people believed this problem is not a real
medical illness compared to schizophrenia. The caregivers in the
schizophrenia vignette were most unwilling to let the person marry
into their family. Despite the stigma and desire for social distance
associated with these mental illnesses, the study suggests that
actions should be taken to improve caregivers’ knowledge about
mental health and reduce stigma.

The study by Nigussie et al. has been conducted in 2022 in
Eastern Ethiopia with the aim to determine the prevalence and
associated factors of perceived stigma and common mental disorder
among primary caregivers of adults with mental illness in public
hospitals. The study found that the magnitude of perceived stigma
and common mental disorder were high, with 42.5and 39.4% of
caregivers experiencing them, respectively. Several factors were
found to be signiﬁcantly associated with perceived stigma and
common mental disorder, including age of caregiver, education
level, duration of illness, family history of mental illness, and poor
social support. The study highlights the need for more attention
to be given to the mental health of caregivers of patients with
mental illness.

Finally, Atienza-Carbonell et al. conducted a pilot study aimed
to investigate whether a single direct-contact intervention with
individuals who have mental illness, referred to as “patient as
educator,” could reduce the degree of stigma toward mental
illness among medical students. The study involved 127 second-
year medical students, 20 of whom participated in the patient
as educator workshop, while the remaining 107 students only
received the formal educational course. The results suggest
that the workshop group experienced a greater reduction in
authoritarianism and social restriction compared to the control
group. The study shows that direct contact intervention may help
reduce stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness among medical
students during their early years of medical school.

Reducing internalized stigma

Reducing internalized stigma in individuals with severe mental
illness requires a multifaceted approach. The following strategies
have been found to be eﬀective in reducing internalized stigma:

1. Education and Awareness: Education and awareness campaigns
can help reduce stigma by providing accurate information
about mental illness and challenging negative stereotypes. These
campaigns can be delivered through various media, such as
television, radio, social media, and print (4).

2. Social Support: Social support from friends, family, and peers
can help individuals with severe mental illness feel less isolated
and reduce feelings of shame and guilt. Peer support programs,
such as support groups and peer mentoring, have been found to
be eﬀective in reducing internalized stigma (5).

3. Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy can help individuals with severe
mental illness identify and challenge negative self-talk, improve
for managing
self-esteem, and develop coping strategies
stigma (6).

4. Medication Adherence: Improving medication adherence and
promoting psychoeducation can also help reduce internalized
stigma by reducing symptoms (7).

Conclusion

Internalized stigma is a signiﬁcant challenge for individuals
with severe mental
illness, aﬀecting their mental health, self-
esteem, and quality of life (8). Overcoming internalized stigma
requires a multi-faceted approach,
including therapy, support
groups, education, and awareness-raising (9, 10). Mental health
professionals play a critical role in addressing internalized
stigma and promoting recovery among individuals with severe
mental
illness. By working together to reduce stigma and
promote understanding, we can create a more inclusive and
supportive society for all individuals, regardless of their mental
health status.
