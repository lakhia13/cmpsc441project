interference

Abstract

Background: Mental health symptoms, like depressive mood (DM) and post-traumatic stress (PTS), and pain
interference (PI) with daily functioning often co-occur following traffic injury and their comorbidity can complicate
recovery. This study aimed to map the course and overlapping trajectories of mental health symptoms, and
associations with PI in a traffic injury population.

Methods: In total, 2019 adults sustaining minor-to-moderate traffic injury were recruited within 28 days post-injury
and assessed using phone interviews at 1, 6 and 12-months post-injury. Trajectories of DM, PTS and PI were
established and relationships between DM, PTS and PI trajectories were explored using dual trajectory modelling.
Bio-psychosocial predictors (e.g. pre-injury health, catastrophizing, acute distress, quality of life, social support) of
mental health trajectories were investigated.

Results: Up to five typical post-trauma trajectories were identified for DM, PTS and PI. Most people were in a
resilient mental health trajectory (over 60%, DM or PTS), or in a chronic PI trajectory (almost 60%) 12 months post-
injury. While recovery/resilient mental health trajectories were strongly interrelated (73.4% joint probability and >
94% conditional probabilities), DM/PTS comorbidity in chronic trajectories was not straightforward, suggesting a
possibly asymmetric relationship. That is, persistent DM was more likely associated with persistent PTS (90.4%), than
vice versa (31.9%), with a 22.5% probability that persistent PTS was associated with none or milder depression (i.e.
following a recovery/resilient DM trajectory). An asymmetrical relationship was also found between mental health
and PI. The majority of those with persistent PI were likely to be in a recovery/resilient DM/PTS trajectory (almost
70%), but those in a non-resilient DM/PTS trajectory showed a high risk of persistent PI. Predictors of non-resilient
mental health trajectories included poorer pre-injury health and social support, and shared factors like acute
psychological distress and pain catastrophizing.

Conclusions: Strong interrelations were confirmed between mental health symptoms and PI following traffic injury.
However, persistent DM was more strongly linked to persistent PTS, than vice versa. Persistent PI was only linked
with persistent DM/PTS in vulnerable subgroups. Early psychiatric/psychological interventions should target elevated
psychological distress and negative appraisals in vulnerable individuals, to reduce long-term mental health morbidity/
comorbidity and PI.

Background
Traffic injuries have a very considerable global impact, af-
fecting up to 50 million people every year [1]. Just like
other injuries [2], irrespective of their initial severity [3],
traffic injuries can result in significant mental health prob-
lems [4–6], chronic pain and related interference on daily
functioning [7, 8], which often co-occur [9]. Comorbid
conditions pose a challenge for injured persons, as well as
treating clinicians, because standard unimodal approaches
frequently lead to suboptimal outcomes [10]. Past studies
of comorbidity have often focused on a subset of problems
in specific injury groups (e.g. post-traumatic stress and
pain in whiplash) and few studies have explored comor-
bidity in the transition from acute injury to chronicity [9].
By adopting a person-centred approach [11], further ana-
lyses must consider these problems as an integrated
system in the person’s recovery course. A thorough under-
standing of the transition of each condition and their asso-
ciations over time is crucial to develop evidence-based,
tailored,
integrated interventions that may lead to im-
proved recovery [12].

Depressive mood (DM) and post-traumatic stress (PTS)
are very common mental health symptoms following an
accident or injury [5, 13–15], however, most studies have
investigated PTS rather than depression. If these DM and
PTS symptoms remain elevated, there is an increased risks
of disability [16–18] and progression to serious mental
disorders (as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)
of Mental Disorders criteria), like major depressive dis-
order (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder [5, 19].
Post-injury rates of mental disorder have been reported in
the range of 30–50% [5, 14, 20, 21].

Individual course and relationships over time between
multiple problems are best captured by person-centred
analysis, such as growth mixture models [11, 22]. A few
studies have now examined trajectories of mental health
following injury [18, 23–27]. Bryant et al., (2015) used
latent class analysis (n = 1084) to establish trajectories of
PTSD severity over a period of 6 years post-injury. They
found five trajectories: (a) 4% with chronically high levels
(chronic), (b) 6% whose severity levels were reducing (re-
covery), (c) 8% who were showing increasing PTSD

severity but improving at 6 years (worsening/ recovery),
(d) 10% who became more severe (worsening) and (e)
73% who had stable low PTSD symptoms across time
(resilient) [26]. These trajectories are typical of those
found following a trauma of some kind, that is, at least
four trajectories (resilient, recovery, chronic and delayed
onset), according to a systematic review of 54 studies
[25]. Only two studies have investigated mental health
trajectories entirely in people with traffic injuries, both
focusing on PTS trajectories [23, 24], but other evidence
suggests people suffering traffic injuries may differ in
their adjustment compared to other traumas [28], with
frequent changes in psychiatric diagnosis over time [5].
More studies are warranted to study mental health
adjustment following a traffic injury in a comprehensive
manner.

factors

Mental health comorbidity is typical after an injury [5,
13, 19, 20], most frequently involving PTSD and MDD
[21, 29–31], but the nature of this association remains
unclear. Some researchers have explored shared predic-
tors and vulnerability in an effort to clarify whether
these conditions are unique or separate constructs [29,
30]. These and other studies [32] have pointed to the
importance of bio-psychosocial
like mental
health history, associated physical problems, cognitive
bias/perceptions (catastrophic thinking, perceived threat
to life), levels of acute distress, the presence of social
support and compensation involvement. These above
factors have been found to contribute more than demo-
graphic and injury factors, in predicting mental health
wellbeing after a traffic injury [32]. Other researchers
have studied directionality of association over time by
looking at reciprocal or directional changes to under-
stand mental health comorbidity [31]. Following traffic
injuries, those affected by multiple disorders (e.g. PTSD
and MDD) or suffering PTSD showed an increased risk
of chronicity in any disorder [5, 29]. Therefore, add-
itional understanding concerning mental health comor-
including overlapping trajectories and
bidity patterns,
the existence of modifiable shared risk factors, is needed
in this population.

Pain frequently co-occurs with mental health problems
[33–35], especially after injury [2, 7, 36], resulting in

Pozzato et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:189 

Page 3 of 13

more complex management of psychiatric care [33, 34,
36] and higher costs [37]. Shared neurobiological under-
pinning [38] and reciprocal relationships have been
found between these conditions, that is, mental health
problems increase risk of persistent pain [2, 24, 34, 36]
and vice versa [34, 39]. Analysis of mental health-pain
relationships among traffic crash survivors is mostly re-
stricted to whiplash cohorts and PTSD [9, 24], despite
substantial evidence showing pain influences mental
health outcomes [40] and negatively interferes with in-
jury recovery [8].

The impact of pain on the individual’s physical and
psychological functioning is known as pain interference
[41]. The literature is robust with respect to the need of
considering not just pain intensity (personal experience
of pain as a symptom) but also pain interference (per-
son’s perception of the extent to which pain limits daily
activities) among trauma patients [42]. Pain interference
is strongly associated with both pain intensity and psy-
chological symptoms, such as mood problems [43–45].
However, studies of comorbid patterns between pain
interference and mental health symptoms following an
injury are scarce.

Traffic injuries have a huge global impact and result in
substantial (co) morbidity [1], but the limited focus of
past research on specific injuries like whiplash and men-
tal disorders like PTSD we believe, has resulted in a def-
icit
in knowledge about how to improve recovery
outcomes. There exists a critical need for large prospect-
ive research to examine comorbidity of multiple mental
health symptoms and associations with pain related tra-
jectories in traffic injury populations, especially minor-
to-moderate injuries [3], given troubling prevalence of
mental health symptoms following these injuries and re-
lated worldwide health burden [46]. Therefore,
the
current study aimed to investigate: (i) trajectories of DM
and PTS and any PI over a 12 month-period post-injury;
(ii) the association between DM and PTS; (iii) the associ-
ation of DM/PTS with PI; and (iv) bio-psychosocial pre-
dictors of membership in a mental health trajectory.

It was hypothesized that: (1) at least four trajectories in
DM, PTS and PI will be found over a period of 12 months
post traffic injury; (2) the probability will be high that partici-
pants in a resilient/recovery or chronic trajectory in DM will
be respectively a member of resilient/recovery or chronic tra-
jectory in PTS, and vice versa (i.e. mental health trajectories
are symmetric and highly interconnected over time), (3) the
probability will be high that persistent PI trajectories are
strongly associated with chronic/worsening mental health
trajectories, and (4) bio-psychosocial variables (e.g. prior
mental health issues, acute distress, pain intensity and cata-
strophizing, social support) will be independent predictors of
membership in DM and PTS trajectories, with psychological
factors being shared predictors.

Methods
Design and procedure
The study employed a multi-site inception cohort de-
sign, defined as recruitment within 28 days post-injury
from emergency departments, general practitioners,
physiotherapy clinics and the claim database of a gov-
ernment
in New South Wales
(NSW), Australia. Recruitment was ongoing between
August 2013 and December 2016. Potential participants
were screened, then invited to participate by letter invi-
tation, with the option of opting-out of the study via
telephone or email within 1-week of the letter mail out.
Verbal consent was obtained over the phone from those
who did not opt out. Phone interviews occurred at 1 (i.e.
within 4 weeks of injury), 6 and 12-months post-injury.
Data were entered on a secure online platform, called
Research electronic data capture (REDCap) [47].

Study inclusion criteria include: (i) being 17 years old or
more; (ii) sustaining a traffic-related physical injury and
being recruited within 28 days of injury; (iii) being a resi-
dent of New South Wales (NSW), Australia; (iv) having
sufficient English proficiency. People were excluded if
they: (i) have sustained a major trauma or catastrophic in-
jury (e.g. spinal cord injury, moderate/severe traumatic
brain injury, extensive burn, major amputation); (ii) have
sustained a very minor soft tissue injury only (e.g. bruise,
abrasion, cut); (iii) have sustained injury due to intentional
self-harm; (iv) have experienced the loss of a family mem-
ber in the crash; (v) have prior cognitive issues impacting
on the ability to consent. For details on recruitment, de-
sign and procedure see Jagnoor et al. [48].

Participants
People aged at least 17 years old were invited to partici-
pate after sustaining minor-to-moderate traffic-related in-
jury (i.e. musculoskeletal
injury, mild traumatic brain
injury) over the 42-month period. A total of 2019 partici-
pants met
(see Add-
itional file 1). Response rates for the 6 and 12-month
follow-up were 73.5 and 59.5% respectively. Those with
follow-up at 6 or 12-months were older (p < 0.0001) and
more likely to be born in Australia (p < 0.0001), have ter-
tiary education (p < 0.0001) and report small or no per-
ceived danger of death caused by the accident
(p <
0.0001). They did not differ significantly in paid work sta-
tus but were less likely to be unemployed and more likely
to be a student or retired (p = 0.0004). They did not differ
significantly in sex distribution, comorbidities, self-rated
pre-injury health, hospitalization or number of injuries.

Measures
Bio-psychosocial predictors

the baseline phone interview. The list of potential

predictors was guided by prior research on psychological
impacts of traffic injury [6, 32]. The final model includes
the following factors: (i) Employment at the time of in-
jury which was dichotomized (yes/no). (ii) Self-reported
pre-injury health-related quality of life (HRQoL), using
the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3 L)
scale that includes five dimensions: mobility, self-care,
usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression
[49]. Each domain is measured by a 3-point Likert scale
(0-no problem, 1-some problems, 3-extreme problems).
An overall summary score, on a range between − 1 and
1 was calculated, based on EQ-5D-3 L value sets for per-
ceived value of the possible combinations of health states
reported. (iii) Post-injury HRQoL was measured using
the Short Form 12 (SF-12), a valid and reliable self-
reported health survey [50], providing a distinct physical
and mental component summary scores. (iv) Pain inten-
sity was measured using an 11-point Likert scale (0-no
pain to 10-worst pain ever) [51]. The following psycho-
social predictors were also included: (v) Perceived dan-
ger of death during the road crash was assessed on a 5-
point Likert scale (0-none to 5-overwhelming). (vi) Satis-
faction with social relationships was assessed using a 5-
point Likert scale (1-poor to 5-excellent). (vii) Pain-
related psychological distress (e.g. feeling helpless about
their pain) was measured using the Pain Catastrophizing
Scale (PCS) [52]. The PCS is a 13-item 5-point Likert
scale (0–4), a range of 0–52 with scores 34 or above in-
elevated pain-related catastrophic
dicating
thinking. However, due to a transposing error, a 6-point
Likert scale (0-not at all to 5-all the time) was used ra-
ther than the usual 5-point scale, resulting in totals ran-
ging between 0 and 65. These totals were rescaled so
that the final score would lie on the published range of
0–52. This minor alteration of the Likert scoring did not
alter the outcome of the analyses [6]. The PCS has been
shown to have adequate reliability, validity and internal
consistency [52].

severely

Table 1 shows baseline socio-demographic (e.g. age,
sex, education) and injury-related factors (e.g. time in
hospital, type and number of injuries, road user type).
Based on previous evidence [32] and supplementary ana-
lysis showing inclusion of these factors didn’t alter study
findings, these were not included in the final predictive
model (also given they are not modifiable). Although the
study collected information on injury compensation, fur-
ther exploration of the impact of this factor was not in-
cluded in this paper.

Post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms
The Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) was used to
measure the presence of PTS symptoms at 1, 6 and 12-
months post-injury via phone interviews. The IES-R is a
22-item self-report measure with acceptable reliability

and validity [53] that has been validated in people with
traffic injuries [54]. Participants were asked to indicate
their degree of PTS during the past 7 days related to
their recent road crash on a 5-point scale (0-not at all to
4-extremely) for subscales avoidance, intrusion and hy-
perarousal. Domains are scored (range 0–4) by deter-
mining the mean item score. The maximum mean score
on each of the three subscales is ‘4’, therefore the max-
imum ‘total mean’ IES-R score is '12' (the sum of the 3
subscales). Higher scores indicate higher levels of PTS.
Based on available norms, a total mean score of ≥4.5 (i.e.
≥33 of the total score of 88) represents clinically elevated
PTS, that is, a probable PTSD diagnosis [21, 53].

Depressive mood (DM) symptoms
The 7-item depression subscale of the Depression Anx-
iety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to assess the
presence of DM symptoms at 1, 6 and 12-months post-
injury via phone interviews. DASS-21 is a 21-item scale
providing an overall assessment of psychological distress
based on DSM criteria [55], including three subscales of
7-item each: depressive mood, anxiety and perceptions
of stress [56]. The depression subscale includes seven 4-
point Likert items (0–3) assessing DM symptoms over
the past week: dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of
life, self-deprecation, lack of interest, anhedonia and in-
ertia. Depression scores are calculated by summing all 7
items and range from 0 to 21. The DASS-21 has accept-
able reliability and validity [56]. Based on available
norms for DASS-21 depression subscale in people fol-
lowing traffic injuries, scores of ≥5 out of 21 (i.e. ≥10
out of 42 if scores are multiplied by 2 according to the
original DASS-42) represent clinically elevated DM, that
is, a probable MDD diagnosis [21].

Pain interference (PI)
PI was assessed at 1, 6 and 12-months post-injury using
item 8 from the SF-12 health survey [50] administered
over the phone, which is a 5-point Likert scale (0-not at
all to 5- extremely) (“During the past 4 weeks, how
much did pain interfere with your normal work includ-
ing work outside the home and housework”). We dichot-
omized PI as any versus no pain interference for the
GMM analyses because there were only five levels of
response.

Statistical analysis
Growth mixture modelling (GMM) and dual trajectory
analyses are person-centred approaches [22] that were
employed to achieve study objectives. Growth mixture
modelling (GMM) in Mplus version 7.3 [57] was used to
determine trajectories for change over time in DM, PTS
and PI, adjusting for significant predictors of trajectory
assignment (conditional model). Unconditional models

Note: These demographic/ injury data have been presented in
prior publications

without covariates were examined initially, however the
trajectory assignments improved after including signifi-
cant predictors in the modelling. Growth parameters
were allowed to vary, with constraints applied if required
due to computation issues. Potential effects of predictors
on growth parameters were examined initially but were
not substantially affecting trajectory assignments. GMM
was estimated under missing data theory using all avail-
able data, thus allowing for missing follow-up on the
outcome measures.

The optimal number of trajectories was determined
from information criterion indices, such as Akaike infor-
mation criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) and entropy values [58]. Methods recommended
for determining the number of trajectories in GMM ana-
lyses include the model that best meets four criteria: (i)
the smallest indices for the Bayesian Information Criter-
ion (BIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC);
(ii) higher entropy values; (iii) significant Vuong-Lo-
Mendell-Rubin (VLMR), Lo–Mendell–Rubin (LMR) and
parametric bootstrap (PB) likelihood ratio test (LRT) sta-
tistics, and (iv) interpretability of the model [58].

Estimated trajectory assignments were used to calcu-
late joint and conditional probabilities of membership in
DM trajectories given PTS or PI, and vice versa. Find-
ings were confirmed using dual trajectory modelling
analyses that calculated the relationships and concur-
rence between DM, PTS and PI trajectories [22]. The

probability of linked memberships in the DM, PTS and
PI trajectories. Data were analysed using Mplus version
7.3 software (https://www.statmodel.com/), Statistical
Analysis System (SAS) version 9.4 and R version 3.5.1.

Results
Compared with those without 12-month follow up,
those with follow up had lower baseline DM symptoms
(mean DASS depression scores: 3.48 (3.20–3.77) vs 4.37
(3.99–4.75)) and PTS symptoms (mean IESR scores: 3.35
(3.18–3.52) vs 4.06 (3.82–4.29)), but similar baseline
levels of PI (mean PI scores: 2.05 (1.97–2.13) vs 2.09
(1.99–2.19)). While rates of DM and PTS decreased over
time, at 12 months around 20% still had clinically ele-
vated DM and around 17.5% clinically elevated PTS
(Table 2). Overall, at 12-month post-injury, one in four
(24.8%) people were suffering persistent DM or PTS and
over 40% reporting any PI.

Trajectories of DM, PTS and PI
Based on information criterion indices of GMM trajec-
tories (see Additional file 2), a five-trajectory solution
was considered the best fit for DM, a four-trajectory so-
lution for PTS and a three-trajectory solution for PI. Fig-
five DM trajectories. There was a

probability of 67.7% of belonging to a trajectory with

stable low DM (T5, resilient; most
12.4% probability of belonging to a trajectory with im-
proving DM (T4, recovery; most likely n = 244), 8.3%
probability of belonging to a trajectory with worsening
DM (T3, worsening; most likely n = 164), 7.5% in a tra-
jectory with moderate-chronic DM (T2, moderate-
chronic, most likely n = 147), and 4.2% in a high DM tra-
jectory (T1, chronic; most likely n = 83).

Figure 2 shows four PTS trajectories, with a probability
of 60.9% of belonging to a trajectory with stable low PTS
(T4, resilient; most likely n = 1206), a 7.8% probability of
belonging to a trajectory with increasing PTS (T3, wors-
ening; most likely n = 154), a probability of 19.4% of be-
longing to a trajectory with reducing PTS over time (T2,
recovery; most likely n = 384), and a 11.9% probability of
belonging to a trajectory with stable high levels of PTS
over time (T1, chronic; most likely n = 236). By contrast,
only three trajectories were found for PI (Fig. 3) with a
probability of 59.3% of belonging to a trajectory with any
persistent PI (T1, chronic; likely n = 1198); a probability
of 25.9% of belonging to a trajectory with reducing PI
likely n = 523), and a 14.8%
over time (T2, recovery;
probability of belonging to a trajectory with stable low
levels or no PI (T3, resilient; likely n = 298).

Predictors of mental health trajectory
With the DM resilience trajectory 5 as the reference (see
factors found to be predictive of
Additional

file 3),

membership in the DM trajectories (T1–4) included
poorer pre-injury health (all trajectories p < 0.001), ele-
vated PTS at baseline (all trajectories, p < 0.001), pain
catastrophizing (all trajectories, at least p < 0.05), dissat-
isfaction with social life (all trajectories, at least p < 0.05),
poorer physical health related-quality of life (T3, worsen-
ing, p < 0.001) and poorer mental health related-quality
of life (all trajectories, p < 0.001). With the PTS resilience
trajectory 4 as the reference, factors found to be predict-
ive of membership in the PTS trajectories (T1–3)
included elevated DM at baseline (all trajectories, p <
0.001), high pain intensity (all trajectories except T2,
recovery, at least p < 0.05), pain catastrophizing (all tra-
jectories, at least p < 0.001) and poorer mental health
related-quality of life (all trajectories, p < 0.001).

Relationships between DM and PTS
Table 3 shows the joint and conditional probabilities be-
tween DM, PTS and PI. It was anticipated that a high
probability of being in a recovery/resilient trajectory or a
chronic trajectory would occur for both DM and PTS.
The largest joint probability for DM and PTS consisted
of people who were members of the recovery/resilient
(T2/T4) PTS and the recovery/resilient (T4/T5) DM tra-
the sample).
jectories (56.2 + 7.8 + 7.0 + 2.4 = 73.4% of
Being a member of a chronic/worsening trajectory in
DM and PTS would be also expected, but this was not
the case. Instead, there was only a 13.1% probability of
belonging to a DM chronic (T1), moderate chronic (T2)
or worsening (T3) trajectory and being a member of a
PTS chronic (T1) or worsening (T3) trajectory, and a
similar joint probability of 13.4% of belonging to a
chronic/worsening trajectory and being a member of a
recovery/resilient trajectory for either DM or PTS.

The conditional probabilities for DM and PTS provide
some explanation for the above finding. As expected,
DM given PTS and PTS given DM conditional probabil-
ities were high for membership in resilient trajectories,
92.2% for DM given PTS and 83% for PTS given DM.
While there was a very high conditional probability of
90.4% for membership in a PTS chronic trajectory given
DM, there was only a 31.9% probability of membership
in the chronic trajectory for DM given PTS. Further,
there was a 73.2% conditional probability of membership
in a recovery or resilient (T4/T5) DM trajectory if one
belonged to a chronic or worsening (T1/T3) PTS trajec-
tory (i.e. a 22.5% probability among those following a
chronic PTS trajectory only). This was unexpected.

Relationships between mental health and PI
It was predicted that persistent PI will be strongly asso-
ciated with chronic/worsening mental health trajectories.
By contrast, the joint probability analysis showed an

or recovery/resilient (T4/T5) DM (41% of the sample).
This was also confirmed by the conditional probability
analysis of DM given PI showing the majority (69.8%) of
participants in the chronic (T1) PI trajectory were in a
recovery/resilient (T4/T5) DM trajectory. Similarly, the
conditional probability analysis of PI given DM showed
that if one was a member of the resilient (T5) DM tra-
they had a 48.1% probability of being in a
jectory,
chronic PI trajectory (T1). In contrast, for PI given DM,
there was a very high probability of being in a chronic PI
trajectory (T1) if in a chronic (T1) or moderate-chronic
(T2) or worsening (T3) DM trajectory (92.8% or 91.8%
or 83.5% respectively). Finally, for DM given PI, there
was a very high probability of being in the resilient (T5)

DM trajectory if one was in the resilient (T3) or recovery
(T2) PI trajectory (89.3% or 82.6% respectively). Analo-
gous asymmetric associations were found between PTS
and PI (see Additional file 4).

Discussion
This study is the first of its kind to use a person-centred
analysis to examine comorbidity patterns of prevalent
mental health symptoms following minor-to-moderate
traffic injuries and exploring relationships between men-
tal health and interference of chronic pain on individ-
ual’s functioning over time in a large prospective cohort
of road crash survivors.

These results strongly confirm that people sustaining
minor-to-moderate traffic injury face high risks of men-
tal distress and pain-related interference with various

activities of daily living. After 4 weeks post-injury, over
80% reported their pain interfered with daily function-
ing, over 30% had clinically elevated PTS symptoms and
almost 30% had clinically elevated DM, reflecting a high
probability of meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD and
MDD disorders respectively [21]. As expected, these
rates reduced with time, however, at 12 months post-
injury over 40% continued to report that pain was limit-
ing their daily functioning and many still reported ele-
vated depressive mood and/or post-traumatic stress
symptoms (i.e. 17.5% PTS and 20% DM). These findings
are in line with 12-month rates of mental disorders

(30%) found in the two largest injury studies, each study
including over 1000 traffic crash survivors [14, 20].

Trajectories of DM and PTS, and predictors
Galatzer-Levy et al. (2018) identified, based on the re-
sults of 54 independent studies, what they called proto-
typical resilience trajectories following a trauma: stable
low distress or resilience, chronically high distress, wors-
ening distress and reducing distress or recovery [25].
Our trajectory findings confirmed these four prototyp-
ical trajectories in the DM and PTS patterns of response
and

strengthen the conclusion that the majority of individ-
uals follow a resilient mental health trajectory [26, 29].

As found in previous research [29], shared psycho-
logical predictors were found for DM and PTS non-
resilient trajectories (hypothesis 4 confirmed) that could
be readily assessed and addressed in psychiatric/psycho-
logical clinical contexts as soon as possible after the in-
jury (i.e. ideally within 1 or 2 months post-injury). The
presence of shared predictors supports the assumption
of a shared vulnerability [9] and strong interrelations be-
tween these conditions following a traffic injury. For in-
stance, catastrophizing styles of thinking is generally
related to increased risk of MDD and PTSD [6] and was
also found to be a shared predictor of chronic/worsening
DM/PTS trajectory membership. The presence of ele-
vated DM and PTS symptoms within 4 weeks of the in-
jury was a strong predictor of poor mental health at 12
months, and should alert clinicians to the need of early
intervention [5]. Additionally, dissatisfaction with one’s
social life also predicted poor outcomes, reinforcing the
importance of social support/engagement as a buffer
against poor mental health, especially in people injured
and likely to have disability that may become a mobility
barrier. Among biological predictors, poorer pre-injury
health raises a red flag for risk of elevated DM, while in-
creased pain intensity predicted a high risk of PTS
symptoms, underlining the need for integrated pathways
of care for injured people with mental health problems if
they also have comorbid chronic pain or pre-existing
medical conditions [10].

These findings indicate mental health vulnerability and
resilience following traffic injury are better interpreted
‘in terms of interactions between biological, emotional,
cognitive, behavioural and environmental factors’ [59].
Within this framework, mental distress symptoms and
negative thinking associated with a physical injury and
pain are shared factors that may help identify less resili-
ent individuals [9, 60, 61].

Comorbidity patterns between DM and PTS
Previous research on mental health impacts of trauma
revealed that PTSD and MDD highly co-occur over time
[5, 29–31]. In support, our dual trajectory joint and con-
ditional analyses of the relationships between DM and
PTS revealed that recovery/resilient DM trajectories
were strongly associated with recovery/resilient PTS tra-
jectories following traffic injury, meaning that resilient
individuals are likely to be resilient for both symptoms.
Interestingly, relationships between chronic PTS and
DM trajectories were more complex. There was a very
high conditional probability (90.4%) of having severe
PTS symptoms if one had severe depressive mood,
though this was not the case for the reverse. There was
a much lower probability (31.9%) of having severe

depressive mood symptoms if one had severe PTS symp-
toms. Based on these findings, hypothesis 2 was only
partially confirmed.

These results challenge the notion that the risk of de-
veloping chronic MDD and PTSD symptoms is symmet-
rical (i.e. if you have PTSD you will have MDD and vice
versa). However, directions of this association cannot be
clearly explained by these data. On one hand, our find-
ings of persistent PTS in almost all those with persistent
DM could support previous studies that showed that
suffering PTSD increases risk for other chronic mental
health disorders [5, 30], as well as confirming the exist-
ence of comorbid PTSD/depression following traffic in-
jury [29]. But, it could equally support the hypothesis of
pre-existing [62] or first-onset elevated MDD after the
injury increasing susceptibility for chronic PTSD [31].
On the other hand, these data show that people can
follow a favourable trajectory for DM even with per-
sistently elevated PTS (i.e. those with persistent PTS
have a 73.2% probability of
following a recovery or
resilient DM trajectory). This could suggest that after
a traffic injury PTS can also occur in isolation or in
association with milder forms of depression having a
favourable course independently of PTS, as observed
by previous findings [29].

All in all, these results, in addition to shared predictive
factors supporting shared vulnerability, confirm a robust,
possibly asymmetric, association between PTS and DM
symptoms following a traffic injury. Possible interpreta-
tions of PTS/DM comorbidity may be that a unique dis-
tress construct exists following trauma [19, 29], or
perhaps that PTS/DM co-occurrence constitutes a dis-
tinct trauma-related phenotype, with specific biological
correlates and poorer prognosis than a single disorder
[63]. Undeniably, comorbidity cases would benefit from
early identification and flexible classification systems and
treatment options targeting depressive mood and trau-
matic distress, [22, 63] preferably as early after the injury
as possible. Treatment should also be offered at least up
to 12 months post-injury, as our findings suggest that a
person may, for instance, be recovering in terms of their
depressive mood, but be deteriorating in terms of PTS
symptoms. The reverse situation seems less likely based
on our findings.

Relationships between mental health and pain
interference (PI)
Given the recognised interactive influence between men-
tal health symptoms and pain on recovery from injury
[2], it was a concern that there was almost a 60% prob-
ability of membership in a trajectory that reported inter-
ference in functioning due to pain. Unexpectedly, the
dual trajectory modelling findings indicate asymmetrical
relationships between pain interference and mental

health (both DM and PTS) following a traffic injury (hy-
pothesis 3 was not confirmed). That is, the largest part
of the sample (41%) had ongoing PI but good psycho-
logical functioning (joint probability). Similarly, almost
70% of those in a chronic PI trajectory were members in
the recovery or resilient DM/PTS trajectory and nearly
50% of psychologically resilient survivors had ongoing
pain interference (conditional probabilities). These find-
ings demonstrate that people can function well even
with the presence of chronic pain, and that other factors
may be associated with the persistence of PI following
injury other than mental health. In contrast, those in a
non-resilient DM/PTS trajectory (i.e. chronic, moderate-
chronic and worsening), although being a minority of
the sample, were very likely to also follow a chronic PI
trajectory, indicating that persisting mental health issues
in vulnerable subgroups are associated with increased
risk of persistent PI [2, 24, 36]. Instead, those in a resili-
ent PI trajectory were likely to also follow a resilient
DM/PTS trajectory. Overall, these findings reveal a high
risk of interference of chronic pain with daily function-
ing for those with chronic mental health symptoms after
traffic injury, but not vice versa, reiterating how import-
ant it is to address comorbid mental health symptoms
early, to reduce long-term risk of prolonged PI in these
vulnerable groups.

Limitations
Although the large sample size, the multisite approach,
thus increased patient heterogeneity, the inception co-
hort design and the use of validated questionnaires are
strengths of this study, there are limitations requiring
discussion. These include the loss to follow-up, espe-
cially at 12 months, the availability of only single items
to measures some of the constructs such as pain inter-
ference, the presence of unmeasured bias (for instance
unmeasured psychological factors), the lack of detailed
information on pre-injury mental health morbidity and
psychological/psychiatric interventions or any other in-
terventions received during the duration of the study.
Also, a standard classification for injury severity (e.g.
ISS, AIS, MAIS) was not included in this study, but
proxies were used (e.g. time in hospital). Further, while
it is accepted that the influence of injury compensation
on recovery is an important but complex issue that will
influence study findings [61], this was beyond the focus
of the present paper, and will be addressed in future
analyses. Finally, interrelations between distinct but pos-
sibly related symptoms, such as DM and PTS, should be
interpreted with caution, as these findings do not offer
information on direction, causation or level of depend-
ence of constructs.

causality) of the prevalent traffic injury consequences, as
well as explore strategies to reduce loss to follow-up, im-
prove the validity of long-term outcomes, improve re-
producibility of trajectories and thus generalize results
to a wider community of adults with traffic-related in-
jury and other trauma/injury populations. Additional
work is also required to clarify any differences in psy-
chological adjustment and comorbidity over time be-
tween people with severe [64] and non-severe injuries
due to a traffic crash.

Conclusions
Most injured people (over 60%) showed high psychological
resilience following a minor-to-moderate traffic injury, but
the same proportion of individuals still suffered persistent
interference of pain in daily functioning of any level 12
months post-injury. Chronic mental health problems oc-
curred in vulnerable groups, with persistent depression being
more strongly associated with persistent PTS than vice versa.
While those in a chronic PI trajectory generally showed
adaptive psychological functioning, those following a non-
resilient mental health trajectory, although a minority,
showed a very high risk of chronic PI. Predictors of non-
resilient mental health trajectory membership were bio-
psychosocial factors, with shared factors being acute elevated
psychological symptoms (i.e. within a month post-injury)
and catastrophizing thinking styles. Addressing these factors
will assist in the identification of less resilient individuals and
are readily modifiable in a psychiatric/clinical psychology
context. Overall, by confirming mental health comorbidity
and strong asymmetric relationships with PI, our findings
strengthen the need for early person-centred interventions
and integrated management of these patients to reduce un-
treated conditions following traffic injury. Interventions are
best individually tailored to vulnerable subgroups exhibiting
co-occurring problems, targeting early psychological reac-
tions to trauma and cognitive thinking styles (i.e. catastro-
phizing), and more comprehensively, addressing the bio-
psychosocial context that influences resiliency and recovery
from adversity.
