Unhealthy alcohol use is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and can worsen 

poverty, couple relationships, and HIV treatment outcomes. In response, we 
assessed participant experiences with Mlambe, a pilot study of an economic and 
 relationship-strengthening intervention for couples living with unhealthy alcohol 

use and HIV. Exit interviews were conducted with a subset of 20 couples who par-
ticipated in a pilot trial of Mlambe in Zomba, Malawi. A 10-month intervention con-
sisted of financial literacy and couples counseling sessions and incentivized savings 

accounts. Eligible couples were married, ≥ 18, with at least one partner with unhealthy 

alcohol use (according to AUDIT-C screen), and currently on antiretroviral therapy 

(ART). Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed using dyadic 

framework analysis. Intervention couples reported that alcohol use caused many 

problems and that reducing or quitting use brought improvements to their physical 

and emotional health, and the well-being of their marriages and households. Before 
Mlambe, couples reported that quarrels about alcohol use were common. After the 
intervention, couples reported improvements to their relationships and less alcohol 

use, which led to more open and respectful couple communication and other marital 

improvements including increased sexual satisfaction and trust. Women and men 

described that post-intervention, men reduced spending on alcohol which improved 

availability of money for household needs such as food and clothing, and that feel-

ing more economically secure reduced stress and led to a more “peaceful family.” 
After Mlambe, male drinkers described more motivation to pursue income-generating

activities, and that reduced alcohol use led to greater medication adherence as 
they no longer forgot to take ART when drinking. Mlambe may contribute to positive 
change for couple relationships and health behaviors through mechanisms includ-

ing reduced conflict and poverty related to reduced alcohol use. The model appears 

promising for couples in resource-poor settings where HIV, poverty, and alcohol use 

are mutually reinforcing.

Introduction

Unhealthy alcohol use is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and can worsen 
economic conditions, couple relationships, and health [1]. Unhealthy alcohol use is 
defined as consuming alcohol above limits that are safe for health (this is defined by 
the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as drinking no more than 
2 drinks a day for men, and no more than one drink for women) (NIAAA). Economic 
insecurity, unemployment, and low-wage, stressful jobs are linked to unhealthy alco-
hol use [2–5]. Alcohol use can also indirectly affect health by damaging couple rela-
tionships that are needed for social support and overall wellbeing [6–10]. Research 
with couples has found that partners can influence each other’s alcohol use, and 
alcohol use can cause and result in relationship distress including intimate partner 
violence (IPV) [11–13].

Unhealthy alcohol use is a health threat for people living with HIV (PLWH) 

[14–16] and unhealthy drinking is higher among PLWH as compared to the general 
population [17,18]. Among PLWH, high levels of alcohol use are associated with 
lower antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and poor clinical HIV care outcomes 
[15,19–25]. Drinking behaviors are often gendered, with unhealthy alcohol use being 
more common among men compared to women [25–27]. In Malawi, men are the 
primary alcohol users; among men who drink (30% of men), 51% meet the criteria 
for unhealthy drinking [28]. Unhealthy alcohol use by one partner can also negatively 
influence the health of partners who do not drink. In a study from Malawi, men had 
difficulty taking HIV medications when they were drinking, and their female partners 
(most of whom did not drink) also faced adherence challenges when their husband’s 
drinking led to IPV and food insecurity [10].

Whereas the negative impacts of alcohol use on relationships are myriad, cou-

ple relationships also offer an opportunity to leverage social support within the 
couple to mitigate the harms of unhealthy drinking [29]. Studies that have used a 
 relationship-strengthening framework have been successful in sub-Saharan Africa at 
reducing alcohol use and addressing HIV-related behaviors [30–34]. In South Africa, 
interventions focused on strengthening relationships among heterosexual couples have 
led to reductions in alcohol use and increased uptake of HIV testing [30,31]. However, 
most alcohol interventions have intervened at the individual level and have not ade-
quately considered the interplay of social and behavioral factors for committed couples, 
despite research that suggests an urgent need for interventions that consider alcohol 
use as a couple-level issue involving and affecting both partners [29,35,36].

Alcohol use can also worsen conditions of poverty. Malawi’s poverty levels are high with 71% of adults living on $2 
USD or less per day [37]. Only 34% of Malawians have access to the formal banking sector for which financial literacy 
is a major barrier [38]. In response to the syndemics of of poverty, HIV, IPV, and alcohol use [13,39,40], we developed, 
implemented, and then evaluated Mlambe, an economic and relationship-strengthening intervention. Mlambe consisted of 
incentivized savings accounts with financial literacy strengthening activities and couples counseling sessions for couples 
with unhealthy alcohol use and living with HIV in Zomba, Malawi [41,42].

Mlambe was guided by a conceptual model based on the couple interdependence theory of communal coping [43] and 

asset theory [44,45]. Couple interdependence theory stipulates that improved relationship dynamics, including couple 
communication, reduced couple conflict and violence, increased partner support around reducing alcohol use, and finan-
cial literacy and planning would improve couple functioning and in turn lead to reductions in unhealthy alcohol use (Fig 1). 
Asset theory suggests that having assets (e.g., a savings account, education, or a small business) can change household 
economic status but also attitudes, behaviors, and hope for the future [44,45]. Having assets can also create an “asset 
effect” which leads to expectations for more assets, creating a sense of security and safety, and encouraging more opti-
mism and planning for the future.

Following the Mlambe trial, we conducted exit interviews to triangulate findings, better evaluate and understand the 
main trial results, and confirm hypotheses around the key areas of change. Interviews explored domains drawn from the 
couple interdependence theory of communal coping [43], asset theory [44,45], and syndemic theory [39,40]. Briefly, in 
the quantitative intervention component, we found that Mlambe participants reported drinking less alcohol and had lower 
rates of unhealthy alcohol use, improved ART adherence, and increased viral suppression [42]. In addition, couples in the 
intervention compared to control reported greater increases in couple communication, sexual satisfaction, intimacy, unity, 
and trust over time and reported decreases in emotional and physical IPV [46]. The qualitative exit interviews were critical 
to understanding the trends in intervention effects but also to understanding the unexpected ways that the intervention 
impacted couple relationships and health outcomes [47,48]. Using our intervention conceptual model (Fig 1), the present 
qualitative study aimed to describe couples’ experiences with the Mlambe intervention and perceptions of how Mlambe 
may have changed relationship dynamics, family finances, alcohol use, and adherence to ART.

Methods

The study took place in the Zomba district of Malawi where 15% of adults are living with HIV [49]. Participants were 
recruited between May 24, 2021 and November 16, 2021 at an urban, public HIV clinic at the district hospital; a rural, 
private community hospital; and a peri-urban, public health center.

For the larger trial, couples were eligible if: 1) in a non-polygamous marital union; (2) aged 18 or older; (3) had at least 

one partner with a positive AUDIT-C screen (score of ≥4 for men and ≥3 for women; prior 3 months) and on ART for at 
least six months (referred to as the “index patient” to distinguish between dyad members). If either dyad member was 
living with HIV, they must have disclosed their HIV status to the spouse. We excluded couples who reported severe IPV 
in the past 3 months based on the WHO domestic violence module [50] and/or feared that their safety would be at risk 
through participation.

Study staff presented information on the study at health information talks in the waiting rooms of the HIV clinics while 

patients were attending appointments and picking up medications. Index patients could approach the recruiters if inter-
ested. Patients who arrived after the health talks were approached directly by recruiters. If the patient was interested and 
eligible, recruiters gave patients an information card to give to their spouse and set up a phone appointment to screen 
the partner. If the partner was also interested and eligible, the couple was scheduled for their first appointment to obtain 
written, informed consent in the local language of Chichewa.

From the larger trial sample of 78 couples (equally divided between study arms), we selected 20 couples (15 from the 
intervention arm and five from the control arm) to take part in exit interviews. Couples were purposively sampled to obtain 
an equal balance across the recruitment sites. We had aimed to select couples based on low or high satisfaction and par-
ticipation levels in the trial, however, we had 100% participation and 100% satisfaction in the trial. The results presented 
focus on the responses from the 15 intervention couples who took part in exit interviews.

Intervention

Mlambe has been described elsewhere [41,42] but in brief, Mlambe consisted of ten monthly intervention sessions deliv-
ered by a pair of facilitators. The facilitators, one male and one female, had backgrounds in education and counseling 
and delivered the intervention sessions as a team. Prior to the first session, couples set up a joint banking account at 
a national bank in which they could start making deposits. Couples were incentivized with a 1:1 match for each Malawi 
Kwacha saved, up to $10 USD per month. Sessions took place in community-based locations equipped with a conference 
room or at a rented space at HIV clinics. A structured manual was followed and was divided into sessions on economic 
and relationship-strengthening activities, which included sessions on banking services, budgeting, savings and asset 
building, debt management, relationship and power dynamics, and couple communication skills. All sessions were group-
based except for two one-on-one couples counselling sessions to learn and practice relationship skills. In the last session, 
community-based extension workers employed by the Malawian government were invited to meet the couples and advise 
them on best practices for their business goals (e.g., animal husbandry, growing vegetables for a produce stand) and 
continued to meet with couples as needed at their homes to offer support. To start their family-based income-generating 
activity (IGA), couples could access the combined savings and matched component and invest the money into the busi-
ness of their choice.

Data collection

Trained, gender-matched interviewers with prior qualitative skills and experience discussing sensitive topics con-
ducted the exit interviews in the local language of Chichewa. To improve comfort discussing sensitive topics, partic-
ipants were interviewed by research staff that they were familiar with and with whom they had developed rapport. 
The research staff had already provided the intervention sessions and multiple rounds of surveys to the interview 
participants. Both partners were interviewed separately but simultaneously in private rooms to ensure confidentiality, 
to minimize bias, and to ensure that participants felt free to express their personal view independent from their part-
ner. Interviews were conducted following the completion of all intervention sessions at 10 months post- intervention. 
Based on our a priori conceptual model of how Mlambe improves health and relationships, we followed a semi- 
structured interview guide that asked open-ended questions framed around the theories that the intervention was

based on (Asset Theory and Interdependence Theory) [43–45]. Interview questions focused on overall experiences  
and perceptions (both positive and negative) of Mlambe, knowledge and skills gained, perceived impacts of Mlambe 
on relationship dynamics (including closeness, sexual life, arguments), household economics and food  
insecurity, adherence to medications and HIV care, mental health and well-being, and suggestions for how  
Mlambe could be improved. Similar questions were asked of both partners and interviews lasted approximately 
60–90 minutes.

Analysis

The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated from Chichewa to English by research assistants who 
are fluent in both languages. The research manager performed spot-checks to ensure that translations were through 
and accurate. We conducted an individual-level analysis and dyadic-level analysis using a framework analysis approach, 
which allows for comparative analysis of themes and cases by utilizing data matrices [51]. We read and reviewed the 
interview transcript pairs, created summary tables, and organized the data by couples and by the larger categories from 
the interview guide (e.g., perceived impacts on alcohol use). We then coded for patterns within each larger category by 
comparing responses within and between couples by examining raw quotes and noting any agreements or disagreements 
between partners (e.g., the husband reported that he quit consuming alcohol, but the wife said he only reduced alcohol 
use). A team of five coders, which included representation from Malawi and are included as authors, coded the full set of 
transcripts and met regularly to build consensus around definitions and applications of codes and to discuss the findings 
using the summary tables and the themes that emerged. Inter-coder reliability was not formally assessed but discrep-
ancies in code application among the research team were discussed to reach consensus. Finally, we held community 
meetings with key stakeholders including couples who participated to present the findings and ensure our interpretations 
were correct.

Ethics statement

This study received ethical approval from the Human Research Protection Program at the University of California San 
Francisco and the National Health Science Research Committee in Malawi. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT #04906616). Written informed consent was collected twice, once for enrollment into the trial and again for participa-
tion in the exit interviews.

Results

Sample characteristics

Among the 40 individuals who completed an exit interview, mean age was 45 years and most (80%) had primary educa-
tion or less. At baseline, 62.5% reported severe food insecurity. Couples had been together for a mean of 14 years and 
reports of IPV in the past 12 months were common, with 30% reporting emotional, 20% reporting physical, and 17.5% 
reporting sexual IPV. Most couples (74%) were sero-concordant positive and among all individuals on ART, 61% reported 
95–100% adherence to treatment (Table 1).

We highlight five themes that emerged regarding perceived changes of Mlambe on: 1) alcohol use patterns, 2) 
improvements in couple relationships, 3) improvements in sexual life and sexual satisfaction, 4) improvements in eco-
nomic security, and 5) improvements in ART adherence.

Intervention couples reported that alcohol use caused many problems in the past, and that reducing or quitting alcohol 

use because of Mlambe brought about multiple improvements to their physical and emotional health, and the well-being 
of their marriages and households. While couples were asked about any negative feedback and how Mlambe could be 
improved in the future, the findings highlight largely positive perceptions of the intervention.

Changes in alcohol use patterns and underlying motivations for drinking

Many men and women believed that because of Mlambe, men’s alcohol use decreased or changed in other positive ways. 
While some men reported stopping drinking completely, others said they reduced their intake or switched to drinking alco-
holic beverages with lower alcohol content like chibuku [a commercially manufactured sorghum beer with low alcohol 
content] instead of kachasu [a locally distilled spirit made from maize with a high alcohol content]. Some men also described 
changes to their drinking patterns, from consuming alcohol at formal drinking establishments (i.e., village bars) to drinking at 
home. Some wives viewed this as a positive change because they could monitor what and how much their partners drank.

I said, “my partner you should reduce your alcohol use” … Even if he was told [to reduce] he was not reducing his alco-
hol use but since Mlambe started he has improved, he has reduced his alcohol use. -Woman, 34 years old

After Mlambe I am now a changed man, by … 6:00 pm I’m already home, my partner even asks, “Are you back this 
time?” I would say yes, sometimes I take alcohol while at home, something I never used to do. -Man, 44 years old

Many women and men felt that since men had reduced alcohol use, they were now coming home earlier and contribut-
ing to family life. Participants reported that before Mlambe, men would often go out to drinking establishments and some 
would be so drunk that they would sleep at the bar and not come home. However, both women and men noted that 
because of Mlambe, some men spent fewer nights out drinking and sleeping outside the home.

My partner used to drink alcohol a lot and sometimes he was even sleeping at the bottle store, but now he stopped 
doing that since we started this program. -Woman, 41 years old

This increased presence of men at home often meant that men were now contributing to a family business or taking part in 
household chores, while also creating space for couples to spend more time together and communicate about family life.

He is not moving out as he used to, he has reduced. He was leaving for beer drinking places in the morning and was 
coming back in the evening, he was going back in the morning. So, I have noticed that he has reduced this, he can 
go to his friends to chat and come back in time, he is able to do household chores without any problem. -Woman, 34 
years old

While most men and women reported a reduction in men’s alcohol use because of Mlambe, there were some 
 discrepancies among couples about whether the men actually reduced their use. One woman reported that her 
 husband had stopped drinking alcohol while he only reported reducing his alcohol intake. In addition, three men 
reported that they either reduced or stopped drinking alcohol while their wives reported that they had only  
reduced their consumption or had not altered their behavior at all, as seen in the quotes below from a husband  
and wife.

Sometimes I would take 4–5 drinks … so they asked me what I benefit when I take alcohol, so now I have reduced to a 
smaller number of drinks, maybe 3–4 … so that time I was a drunkard [local term referring to a person who is publicly 
intoxicated frequently], after Mlambe I am now a changed man. -Man, 44 years old

Imagine telling him to quit alcohol and then he replies, “ah I can’t stop alcohol, it’s better we should divorce”. You see 
that, so it’s difficult, because when you are telling one to stop something, it means it’s bad. Everything learned, he was 
leaving it behind at the exit door of the sessions. -Woman, 33 years old

Participants described several key sources of motivation that helped them to change alcohol use patterns in positive 
ways, including social support. First, men reported receiving consistent advice and reminders from their wives to reduce 
their alcohol use. Many men reported that these reminders, together with communication skills taught during Mlambe 
sessions, helped them to reduce or stop drinking alcohol. Second, men described feeling motivated to reduce their alcohol 
consumption because of support they received from other peers in the intervention, who advised them to reduce exces-
sive drinking. Participants recalled how one of the lessons of Mlambe was to save money on alcohol to develop a small 
business. As a result, many men said they developed a desire to save their money or invest it in a business. Other men 
explained that the savings aspect of Mlambe and the business or income-generating activities they started kept them busy 
and as a result, they reported drinking less. Some men described how Mlambe helped them realize that spending money 
on alcohol was wasteful and caused them to use sparse resources on alcohol instead of on needed household items or 
food.

They enlightened me that you lose a lot of money with alcohol intake, such that when you want to make a budget you 
just be wasting. -Man, 40 years old

Perceived improvements to couple relationships

Most couples reported that their relationships improved because of Mlambe. Couples explained that some improvements 
in relationship quality were due to participation in the intervention and related to learning communication skills or learning 
to approach their partner with respect. Other improvements in the relationship were seen as being prompted by men’s 
reduction in alcohol use.

Men and women reported that quarrels and family conflicts about alcohol use were common prior to Mlambe. Cou-
ples also reported that, before Mlambe, talking about alcohol use within their relationship was rare. Many of the quarrels 
stemmed from men spending all their money or household funds on alcohol that could have been used for food or school 
fees for children. However, after the intervention, couples reported that they had learned about reducing alcohol use for

the benefit of the entire family. Couples were usually in agreement on positive changes to their marriages and both men 
and women reported quarreling less because of Mlambe.

He went to drink alcohol and spent all the money. He came back home without any money. This is when we started 
arguing. We were arguing frequently. When someone did not speak well … we ended up quarrelling. But this stopped 
after we joined this project. -Woman, 34 years old

What happens is that you use that money for beer and [you] finish the money. So when you get home you find that 
there are arguments … sometimes I would speak roughly [to my wife]. But … we should be respecting each other as 
you have taught us. So I see that these days we are able to understand each other more. – Man, 70 years old

Men and women reported that communication skills that they learned as part of Mlambe helped to facilitate more open 
and respectful couple communication and other marital improvements, including more active listening and reports of 
increased trust. Couples felt that these skills helped to strengthen relationships and they felt more “free with each other”. 
Where in the past, discussing alcohol use or family finances had been off limits, couples reported that they could now 
openly discuss these topics, and they felt heard by each other. Couples discussed learning to approach each other 
with humility and respect, and to use “I statements” rather than casting blame with “you statements”. Men and women 
said these techniques helped to reduce fighting in the relationship and led more than one couple to say that Mlambe 
had brought peace to their family. As one husband and wife explained, the communication skills they learned helped to 
improve communication in their relationship.

We have benefited from this in our family, we understand each other and when speaking to each other, when I am 
angry with something, I start talking to her, “I am upset when…” And my partner listens and understands me … so 
because of this, since we started those sessions in our family, we have peace every time. -Man, 49 years old

On communicating with my spouse, we learnt that if I want to talk to him, I should not blame him like using ‘you,’ no I 
should say ‘I’ because if I say I … that the person who is listening is also interested that she has said ‘I’ and is not blam-
ing me … the other thing is that when we are communicating, we must understand each other and be humble to each 
other. When one is speaking it is good that one listens to what the partner is speaking rather than both of us speaking 
at once, you end up quarrelling. – Woman, 39 years old

However, in some couples, it appeared that men were presenting a more positive view of improvements to communication 
since reports by their wives did not coincide with what they said.

Perceived improvements in sexual life and sexual satisfaction

While sexual satisfaction was not a primary focus of the Mlambe intervention, we anticipated that there could be spill-
over effects on sexual satisfaction through improvements in other relationship domains (e.g., communication, trust) and 
through reductions in alcohol use. While a few participants admitted that nothing changed with their sexual life, or that 
they already had a healthy sexual life to begin with, most intervention couples reported improvements in either the quality 
or quantity of sex. Improvements to sexual satisfaction were believed to be related to several shifts in the relationship that 
occurred through participation in Mlambe.

Both men and women reported that before Mlambe when men were drinking, they often had extra-marital sexual 

partners and that these two behaviors went hand-in-hand. Women reported how their husbands were now spending less 
time “sleeping outside the house” (meaning having other sexual partners) and at drinking establishments, and more time 
at home. Some husbands admitted that they were having many sexual partners (referred to by the men as “womanizing”)

because of their unhealthy drinking. After Mlambe, men reported less drinking, fewer sexual partners, and being more 
faithful to their wives. After taking part in Mlambe, one husband explained, “I had a secret lover but I ended the relation-
ship after I noticed that I was not doing good to my partner because every time she was having stress.” Some women 
specifically explained that as their husbands decreased their drinking and were more likely to be sober, having sex was 
more enjoyable. Prior to Mlambe, women would either refuse to have sex when their husbands were drunk or sex would 
not happen because he was too tired or could not perform sexually. Husbands also acknowledged this was happening. 
For example, one husband admitted that:

When I have gone to drink alcohol, I might fail to do sex so she might be sad since I will be tired. So you just come 
back and lay on the bed, nothing happens as if you are sharing a bed with a fellow man. -Man, 40 years old

Couples also described how Mlambe taught them to communicate more openly and respectfully with their partner, which 
extended into the sexual realm. Communication around sex covered topics such as values around monogamy (e.g., 
addressing desires or temptations for other sexual partners), sexual desires and needs (e.g., how often sex should hap-
pen), and acceptable reasons for refusing sex (e.g., when sick). A husband described how he and his wife learned about 
the importance of verbal communication and learning to read each other’s signs for wanting sex:

Mlambe has helped us in this because in the past when we wanted to have sex, it was just happening as a surprise 
[laughing] and Mlambe has told us that when you want to have sex with your wife you need to show signs so that she is 
also aware what her husband wants. -Man, 60 years old

Finally, sexual life improved when sex was perceived as consensual and equally desired by both partners. This contrasted 
with the past, when one partner would pressure or force the other to have sex or refuse sex, often because the man was 
drinking. Two men explained that before Mlambe, they were forcing their wives to have sex with them, but since taking 
part in the intervention, they had stopped that behavior.

Perceived improvements in economic security

Both partners described how men would use household finances to buy alcohol before Mlambe, which left them unable 
to support basic family needs. Women and men both described situations where men spent money on alcohol that was 
being saved for buying food or for paying children’s school fees. Some men and women reported that their children were 
going hungry while the men used what money they had to buy alcohol. After Mlambe, men reduced spending on alcohol 
which led to more money being available to meet basic needs, such as buying more food, soap, clothing, fertilizer, or 
paying school fees for children. Couples were also able to save to plant vegetable gardens or make house improvements, 
such as buying iron sheets that could replace old roofs. When men were not using family funds to buy alcohol, this led to 
fewer conflicts, more “peace in the household”, a greater sense of economic security and reduced financial stress and led 
couples to have a more positive view of the future, with one participant saying that saving money helped to “transform” her 
household.

When he left to drink alcohol, he left home without giving me money to buy food, and he came back while he was drunk 
and then he asked for food. I told him that there was no food and then he blamed me for not preparing food yet he did 
not give me any money and he spent his money on alcohol. -Woman, 39 years old

Before Mlambe, I wasn’t able to save, I wasn’t able to take care of my family, but after I joined Mlambe I started saving 
because they taught us that, I am able to support my family, before when my wife tells me that flour is done, I was say-
ing I cannot use this money, is meant for alcohol, but now that doesn’t happen. –Man, 44 years old

After Mlambe, women and men described how they were able to invest in small businesses such as rearing livestock 
(goats, pigs, and chickens), growing vegetables for sale, opening a small salon, or buying a motorbike that could be used 
as a local taxi. Prior to Mlambe, some men described being “idle” but after Mlambe, male drinkers described being more 
motivated to pursue income-generating opportunities such as rearing livestock.

He was saying that he was drinking alcohol because he doesn’t have things to do, when he found things to do [busi-
ness] he was not going to drink alcohol because he was busy with the business. -Woman, 30 years old

Through the business we are able to find money and its different from just being idle then anything can come into mind 
like “I should go to the beer hall”. -Man, 69 years old

However, in some couples, even though men said they had reduced their alcohol use, women reported that they were 
“saving alone” and starting small businesses on their own without their partner’s support.

Couples also described that prior to Mlambe, men oversaw finances in the household and women had little say when 

men spent their savings on drinking. As one woman described, before Mlambe, her husband, “took all the money and 
ruled over it”. Another man described that when his wife asked him for money, he would scoff at her and say, “I am the 
one who earns money, and you do not have any right to tell me what to do”. However, Mlambe included a session on 
balancing power dynamics including economic power, and after Mlambe, women reported decisions about how to spend 
household finances became more equitable. Men often brought home their earnings and either developed a budget with 
their wives or discussed how to spend or save the money with their wives.

The other skill I learnt is on finances, because previously, every one of us was keeping their money alone and that also 
meant spending, but now, we are able to discuss expenditure. –Man, control arm, 46 years old

Perceived improvements in adherence to ART

Men and women both described how prior to Mlambe, men experienced ART adherence challenges because of alcohol 
use. For many men, they forgot to take medications altogether or took them late because of drinking. Women confirmed 
that alcohol intake was affecting the medication adherence of their partners. Couples also noted that at times it was hard 
to get to facilities for appointments and to collect medications because they were busy. As a result of Mlambe sessions, 
however, men and their wives reported that they started to reduce their alcohol use, and this led to greater medication 
adherence and men feeling healthier. Couples reported that they learned in counselling sessions that medication adher-
ence can help them live longer, improve their immunity, and their overall health. Many men identified that skipping their 
medications was a direct result of drinking too much. As one man explained, “[I] no longer skip taking medication because 
I stopped drinking alcohol. The skipping of medication was as a result of alcohol intake.”

Before Mlambe, he was drinking heavily, he was spending carelessly. I would advise him but he wouldn’t listen … but 
he reduced all that after Mlambe, and also right now he is complying with medication prescriptions … we were arguing 
because he was declining taking medication but now, he is taking medication well. -Woman, 35 years old

In addition to providing general support for medication adherence, an important way that couples supported each other 
was through reminders to take their ART on time and to not miss doses. Both men and women reported that they now 
remind their partners to attend clinic appointments and many reported that they collect medications for each other if one 
person is sick or busy. Many couples also talked about creating daily reminders whereby their partners reminded them to 
take their medications every morning before leaving for work, or right after they eat breakfast. Women also reminded their 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331202  August 29, 2025

10 / 18

partners that taking medications and alcohol at the same time was not good for their health. The Mlambe sessions helped 
couples to see each other as “guardians” or each other’s health. Many participants also felt that improved communication 
skills led them to support each other to take their ART after Mlambe.

When I wake up in the morning, immediately after taking let’s say porridge, she comes and give me the medicine, then 
I take the medicine with water. When I forget she reminds me, so I don’t skip taking medicine. -Man, 44 years old

If someone forgets to take the ARVs the other one should remind him. So we help each other, asking each other if 
he has taken the ARVs. If you have not yet taken them you give thanks for the reminder and then go and take them. 
-Woman, 72 years old

Discussion

These findings highlight the multiple mechanisms by which Mlambe may contribute to positive change for couple relation-
ships and health behaviors related to HIV and alcohol use. Reductions in alcohol use may lead to improvements in couple 
relationship quality, family finances, and engagement with HIV treatment and care. In Mlambe, we holistically examined 
family health by using a qualitative approach to better understand how reductions in alcohol use affect the daily lives of 
couples and families. We found a complicated picture of the interwoven pathways and mechanisms by which a reduction 
in alcohol use improved multiple outcomes including relationship quality and health. The Mlambe model appears promis-
ing in resource-poor settings with couples affected by HIV where poverty may be a driver of alcohol use.

Couples were asked to make suggestions about how the intervention could be improved to better meet their needs, 
and asked to give positive and negative feedback, but mostly reported positive perceptions of the intervention. This aligns 
with our quantitative trial data finding high levels of feasibility and acceptability of Mlambe [42]. Similar to Mlambe qual-
itative data, quantitative data also found reductions in alcohol use, high ART adherence as measured through viral load 
testing, improvements in relationship quality, and greater equitable financial decision-making within couples [42,46,52]. A 
strength of this qualitative approach is that these positive results triangulate and largely confirm the quantitative results but 
also add depth and nuance to our understanding of how Mlambe led to positive change for couples.

Research with couples has shown that partners can influence each other’s alcohol use [11,53], yet few studies in 
sub-Saharan Africa have used a relationship-strengthening framework to reduce alcohol use [30]. Mlambe is one of the 
few couple-level interventions that target alcohol use alongside economic issues and has shown reductions in unhealthy 
alcohol use [42]. Most men qualitatively reported either reducing or stopping alcohol use altogether and the positive 
effects that this had on other areas including relationship quality and family finances. Similar to our Mlambe findings, other 
studies in sub-Saharan Africa that have used a relationship-strengthening framework have been successful at reducing 
alcohol use and addressing HIV-related behaviors. For example, in South Africa, interventions focused on strengthening 
couple relationships among heterosexual couples have led to reductions in alcohol use and increased uptake of HIV test-
ing [30,31]. Studies have also found that relationship-strengthening interventions can reduce IPV [54,55]. In Rwanda, a 
gender-transformative couple-level intervention found that improvements in relationship dynamics such as couple commu-
nication and emotional closeness as well as reducing alcohol use emerged as an important mechanism for reducing IPV 
[56]. In South Africa, a couples intervention focused on reducing unhealthy alcohol use also found decreases in IPV [57]. 
Therefore, Mlambe findings add to a growing literature in sub-Saharan Africa that show that a relationship-strengthening 
framework has great promise for reducing alcohol use in this context.

Participants also described how Mlambe had enhanced couple relationships through improved communication and 

more equitable and shared decision-making in the home. Mlambe improved relationship quality due to fewer family 
conflicts, more open and respectful communication between partners generally and in particular about alcohol use and 
helped develop active listening skills and trust. Prior research from sub-Saharan African countries has also found that

improvements in relationship dynamics, such as communication, commitment, trust, and unity can improve various  
health outcomes including HIV testing and status disclosure, ART adherence, uptake and retention in HIV care  
[5,31,33,34,58–61] and reductions in experienced and perpetrated IPV and reduced sexual coercion [62]. HIV behavioral 
interventions have also been developed for couples and have focused on enhancing couple relationship dynamics for 
improved family health outcomes [31,58,63,64]. While less research has focused on alcohol use, a study among cou-
ples in South Africa found that unhealthy alcohol use was positively associated with poor relationship dynamics such as 
negative communication styles and mistrust [65]. Decision-making power, or feeling that relationships are more equitable, 
may also help to improve relationship dynamics, which in turn can improve couple support for reductions in alcohol use. A 
study with couples in South Africa supports this and found that shared power was strongly associated with higher rela-
tionship quality [66]. The effect of power dynamics on relationship quality remains a crucial study area due to its potential 
impact on couples’ alcohol-related behaviors [43,66–68].

Mlambe couples reported improvements in sexual satisfaction that resulted from reductions in alcohol use. This in turn 

led to more enjoyable, frequent, consensual, and sober sex, and increased open communication around sexual needs 
and desires. Sexual satisfaction is an important dimension of relationship quality [69] and data from a study conducted in 
Malawi and Eswatini found that couples with higher sexual satisfaction also report higher relationship quality and lower 
negative relationship experiences like reports of emotional, physical, or sexual IPV [70]. This is also in line with our finding 
that couples reporting improvements in sexual satisfaction because of Mlambe also experienced less coercive sex and 
more open sexual communication. While few studies have examined sexual satisfaction in the context of alcohol use, a 
study from Uganda found lower sexual satisfaction when men consumed alcohol [71,72]. While these findings are in the 
opposite direction, they reinforce our Mlambe finding that sexual satisfaction is positively associated with reductions in 
alcohol use. Sexual satisfaction has also been associated with positive outcomes such as lower anticipated HIV stigma 
[73] and may be a promising dimension to work on in couple-level interventions as a way to build stronger, more support-
ive and resilient relationships.

The Mlambe intervention focused on strengthening relationships while also offering incentivized savings accounts 
and financial literacy training. Expectedly, Mlambe couples reported that their family finances improved, but the finan-
cial training and savings accounts also led to less alcohol consumption. Finances that previously would have been 
spent on alcohol were described as being spent on household needs. While economic strengthening interventions in 
sub-Saharan Africa have been found to reduce sexual risk-taking among adolescents and to improve suppression of 
HIV among adolescents living with HIV [74–76] using such interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use, as Mlambe 
did, is novel. Mlambe couples also reported more equitable financial decision-making in their families. This is a novel 
finding, as most economic strengthening and micro-savings interventions have focused just on women rather than 
including couples as a unit [41,77–79]. By offering financial literacy training to both members of the couple together, it 
seems that Mlambe led to a sense of joint financial decision-making. It may also be that by working with couples, men 
were less likely to view women’s involvement in financial matters as a threat to their role as providers and as the heads 
of households [41,80,81]. Couples reported how a reduction in alcohol use also led to more money being available for 
starting small family businesses. While some couples appeared to be developing small businesses together, in oth-
ers, women were running the business alone. While this still injects needed resources into the family, traditional gen-
der roles around the division of labor in the household may have been in play, with running a business becoming yet 
another task that women had to be responsible for.

The association between alcohol use and ART non-adherence is well established in SSA [82–89]. In line with this 

literature, Mlambe couples described improvements in ART adherence because of reductions in alcohol use. Specifically, 
Mlambe couples supported each other through reminders about taking treatment and not missing doses. This is in line 
with data from other African settings that also supports the positive impact that partner support can have on treatment 
adherence. In the area of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, a lack of partner support has been 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331202  August 29, 2025

12 / 18

noted as a reason why women stop ART [90,91] while partner support has been associated with ART adherence among 
PMTCT users in Ethiopia and Tanzania and viewed as a necessary precondition for ART initiation and adherence [92,93]. 
While partners can interfere with treatment adherence, positive relationship attributes such as unity, satisfaction, intimacy, 
commitment, and partner support have been found to be associated with reported adherence [35,94]. Primary partners 
can provide critical social support to people living with HIV and can be leveraged, as we saw in Mlambe, to provide ART 
adherence support in a population with challenges around alcohol use.

While both men and women were generally in agreement that Mlambe had positive effects and helped to reduce alco-
hol use, improve couple communication, sexual satisfaction, family finances, and treatment adherence, there were some 
disagreements among couples about the magnitude of impact. Overall, men tended to report more change or improve-
ment than women. For example, while men might report abstaining from alcohol, their wives would report that men had 
reduced their alcohol intake but had not quit completely. Another area of disagreement was around financial saving. 
Sometimes men reported that they were now saving money with their wives, but their wives reported that they were sav-
ing without help from their husbands. Therefore, while the wives were still reporting improvements, they were often less 
than those reported by men. These differences between men and women in reporting about the level of positive effects 
experienced because of Mlambe are similar to a study from Malawi which found that men and women often had conflict-
ing accounts of their family financial situation and the level and impacts of men’s alcohol use. However, when reporting on 
sexual satisfaction, it was more common for women to report improvements in this area, while men reported that things 
were the same as before. This qualitative finding is similar to our quantitative results which found larger positive effects of 
Mlambe on sexual satisfaction among women compared to men [95]. It is possible that for women, reductions in alcohol 
use by their husbands led to a more fulfilling sexual life but that men did not perceive these changes in the same way. 
Overall, while there was some variation, it seems that both men and women benefitted from Mlambe and perceived the 
intervention as creating positive change in their lives.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. As with all research, it is possible that participants were overly positive in their interviews 
about intervention satisfaction given their relationship with the Mlambe study, their desire to maintain a good relationship 
with the study, and the hope to access future opportunities. However, we had checks in place to overcome this potential 
bias. During the exit interviews, the interviewers highlighted the importance of hearing both positive and negative feed-
back and focused on the importance of improving the intervention in the future. However, the positive qualitative findings 
are consistent with the quantitative results which also showed very positive experiences with Mlambe [96]. Therefore, 
while we had intended to include results in these analyses from those reporting low satisfaction and those reporting 
negative experiences, everyone reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention. Social desirability bias is 
also a concern. Participants may have under-reported or misreported details about alcohol use or changes in alcohol use, 
behavior change related to extra-marital sexual partnerships, changes in relationship quality, or changes in their financial 
behavior. In this case, having the accounts of both partners is critical as sometimes one partner reported changes while 
the other reported some or no change. The inclusion of the wives’ voices in the findings also helps to offset overly positive 
portrayals of behavior change among the men—who were the primary target of the alcohol intervention.

Conclusions

These qualitative findings highlight multiple mechanisms by which Mlambe may contribute to positive change for couple 
relationships and health behaviors related to HIV and alcohol use. The Mlambe model appears promising in resource-
poor settings with couples affected by HIV and should be scaled up to improve relationship dynamics, family finances, 
and adherence to ART while reducing alcohol use. While the Mlambe intervention was designed for heterosexual cou-
ples living with HIV, it is possible to adapt the intervention for various populations. If the intervention was being offered to

couples not affected by HIV, the HIV content could be removed. Also, Mlambe participants were middle-aged on average 
and were in established, married couples. The intervention could also be adapted for younger couples, but they might 
have other relationship dynamics that should be targeted. However, many relationship dynamics, such as building trust 
and couple communication, are likely to benefit any couple. Improving the family unit is a strong foundation on which to 
improve health outcomes and as seen in Mlambe, can lead to positive downstream effects not just for the person who 
drinks alcohol – but for the whole family.
