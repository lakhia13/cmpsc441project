HIGHLIGHTS
•  This  study  reveals  three 
subgroups of child victims of 
sexual  abuse:  resilient 
children,  children  displaying 
PTSD  and  children  showing 
Complex  PTSD  symptoms. 
•  Trauma-focused  cognitive 
behavioural  therapy  was 
found  to  be  effective  in 
sustaining  recovery  for  all 
subgroups.

ABSTRACT
Background:  PTSD  symptoms  are  frequent  in  child  victims  of  sexual  abuse.  Yet,  authors 
have argued that early trauma could lead to alterations in development that go far beyond 
the  primary  symptoms  of  PTSD  and  have  proposed  Complex  PTSD  as  an  alternative 
diagnosis  encompassing  difficulties  in  affect  regulation,  relationships  and  self-concept.
Objective:  To  delineate  profiles  in  child  victims  of  sexual  abuse  and  explore  whether 
profiles  are  associated  with  treatment  response  to  Trauma-Focused  Cognitive  Behavioural 
Therapy.
Method: Latent class analysis was used to identify symptom profiles at baseline assessment 
of  384  children  ages  6  to  14,  recruited  in  a  Child  Advocacy  Centre  following  disclosure  of 
sexual  abuse.  Dimensions  of  Complex  PTSD  diagnosis  as  proposed  by  the  ICD-11  were 
derived  from  self-report  questionnaires.
Results:  Latent  class  analysis  identified  a  best  fitting  model  of  three  classes:  Classic  PTSD 
regrouping  51%  of  children,  Complex  PTSD  describing  23%  of  children,  and  Resilient 
describing  25%  of  children.  Trauma-focused  therapy  was  associated  with  a  significant 
reduction  of  dissociation,  internalizing,  and  externalizing  problems  for  children  of  all  three 
classes.  Trauma-focused  therapy  was  also  linked  to  a  significant  reduction  of  PTSD  symp-
toms with larger effect size (d  = .90; 95%CI: 0.63–1.16) for children classified in the Complex 
PTSD  class.
Conclusion:  These  findings  highlight  the  utility  of  a  person-oriented  approach  to  enhance 
our  understanding  of  the  diversity  of  profiles  in  child  victims.  The  results  offer  empirical 
support  for  the  ICD-11  PTSD  and  Complex  PTSD  distinction  in  a  clinical  sample  of  sexually 
abused  children  and  the  relevance  of  this  distinction  in  foreseeing  treatment  outcomes.

Análisis  de  clase  latente  de  síntomas  de  estrés  postraumático  y  TEPT 
complejo en víctimas de abuso sexual infantil y sus respuesta a terapia 
cognitivo  conductual  centrada  en  el  trauma 
Antecedentes: Los síntomas de TEPT son frecuentes en niños víctimas de abuso sexual. Sin 
embargo, los autores han argumentado que el trauma temprano podría llevar a alteraciones 
en el desarrollo que van más allá de los síntomas primarios de TEPT y han propuesto el TEPT 
Complejo  como  una  alternativa  diagnóstica  que  abarca  las  dificultades  en  la  regulación  de 
los  afectos,  las  relaciones  interpersonales  y  el  autoconcepto.
Objetivo: Delinear perfiles en niños víctimas de abuso sexual y explorar si los perfiles están 
asociados  con  respuesta  al  tratamiento  de  Terapia  Cognitivo  Conductual  Centrada  en  el 
Trauma.
Método:  Se  utilizó  análisis  de  clase  latente  para  identificar  perfiles  de  síntomas  en  la 
evaluación  inicial  de  384  niños,  edades  entre  6  a  14  años,  reclutados  en  el  Centro  de 
Defensa  Infantil  luego  de  la  revelación  del  abuso  sexual.  Las  dimensiones  diagnósticas  de 
TEPT  Complejo  según  lo  propuesto  por  la  CIE-11  se  derivaron  de  cuestionarios  de  auto- 
reporte.
Resultados:  El  análisis  de  clase  latente  identificó  el  mejor  modelo  de  tres  clases:  TEPT 
Clásico  reagrupó  al  51%  de  los  niños,  TEPT  Complejo  describió  al  23%  de  los  niños, 
y  Resiliente  describió  al  25%  de  los  niños.  La  terapia  centrada  en  el  trauma  se  asoció  con 
una  reducción  significativa  de  disociación,  y  problemas  internalizantes  y  externalizantes  de 
los  niños  de  las  tres  clases.  La  terapia  centrada  en  el  trauma  también  se  vinculó  con  una 
reducción significativa de síntomas de TEPT con un mayor tamaño de efecto (d=.90; 95% IC: 
0.63-.1.16)  para  los  niños  clasificados  en  el  grupo  de  TEPT  Complejo.
Conclusiones: Los hallazgos resaltan la  utilidad de un enfoque orientado a la persona  para 
mejorar  nuestra  comprensión  de  la  diversidad  de  perfiles  en  niños  víctimas.  Los  resultados 
ofrecen  apoyo  empírico  para  la  distinción  en  la  CIE-11  de  TEPT  y  TEPT  Complejo  en  una 
muestra clínica de niños abusados sexualmente y la relevancia de esta distinción para prever 
los  resultados  del  tratamiento.

diseases.

Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  symptoms  are 
prevalent  in  child  victims  of  sexual  abuse  (Nooner 
et al., 2012). Yet, authors have argued that early trauma 
could  lead  to  alterations  in  development  that  go  far 
beyond the core symptoms of PTSD (Ford, 2015). The 
World  Health  Organization  in  its  last  edition  of  the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD), has pro-
posed  the  Complex  PTSD  (C-PTSD)  as  an  alternative 
diagnosis encompassing difficulties in affect regulation, 
relationships and self-concept (ICD-11) (World Health 
Organization, 2018). Studies that have assessed the rele-
vance  of  C-PTSD,  have  supported  the  distinction 
between  the  two  disorders  (Brewin  et  al.,  2017). 
However,  these  studies  were  conducted  mainly  with 
adult samples and few studies have explored the value 
of 
these  constructs  among  samples  of  children 
(Kazlaushas et al., 2020). Consequently, further research 
is  needed  to  explore  whether  these  two  diagnoses  are 
indeed  distinct  in  child  victims  given  this  distinction 
could efficiently orient service provision.

Trauma-focused 

cognitive-behavioural 

therapy 
(TF-CBT)  is  recognized  as  the  gold  standard  for  the 
treatment  of  PTSD  symptoms  in  child  victims  of 
sexual  abuse  (Runyon,  Risch,  &  Deblinger,  2019). 
Although  TF-CBT  have  been  shown  to  improve 
PTSD  symptoms,  little  is  known  about  its  effect  on 
Complex  PTSD  symptoms  among  children.  Sachser, 
Keller,  and  Goldbeck  (2016)  have  investigated  the 
effects  of  TF-CBT  in  a  sample  of  children  and  ado-
lescents from German mental health clinics, who had 
sustained  a  traumatic  event  and  presented  PTSD 
symptoms.  They  first  identified  two  distinct  classes 
of  symptom  profiles  and  found  that  TF-CBT  was 
associated  to  a  large  effect  size  for  PTSD  symptoms 
in  both  classes  and  medium  to  large  effect  size  for 
symptoms  characteristics  of  C-PTSD  among  the 

C-PSTD  group.  Although  their  study  is  a  first  step 
in  understanding  C-PTSD  in  children  and  its  treat-
ment,  their  study  included  a  small  number  of  chil-
dren  who  completed  treatment  (n  =  38  in  the  PTSD 
class and n = 23 in the C-PTSD). In addition, the age 
range of the participants was quite large and included 
both  school-aged  children  and  adolescents,  which 
could  mask  some  important  developmental  specifici-
ties  in  symptom  profiles.  Their  sample  also  included 
children  faced  with  a  variety  of  traumas  (sexual 
abuse,  physical  abuse,  loss  of  a  close  friend  or  rela-
tive)  and  it  is  known  that  not  all  traumas  are  asso-
ciated  with  the  same  effects.  For  instance,  child 
victims  of  sexual  abuse  are  found  to  present  greater 
internalizing  and  externalizing  behaviour  problems 
over  time  compared  to  maltreated  but  non-sexually 
abused children (Lewis, McElroy, Harlaar, & Runyan, 
2016).  Given  child  sexual  abuse  is  a  more  intrusive 
type  of  trauma  that  involves  specific  interpersonal 
dynamics (Finkelhor & Browne, 1985), it is important 
to  document  whether  C-PTSD  can  be  accurately 
assessed  in  this  population  and  to  explore  the  effects 
of  TF-CBT  among  sexually  abused  children  present-
ing with more complex symptomatology. Against this 
backdrop,  the  current  study  aimed  1)  to  disentangle 
the  diversity  of  symptom  profiles  in  child  victims  of 
sexual  abuse  based  on  the  ICD-11  C-PTSD  model 
and  2)  examine  whether  profiles  are  associated  with 
treatment  response  to  TF-CBT.  Since  TF-CBT  is 
a  flexible  therapeutic  approach,  the  results  will  allow 
for  cues  to  a  more  personalized  approach  to  treat-
ment 
for  this  vulnerable  population  of  youth. 
Documentation  of  symptom  profiles  in  populations 
confronted  to  trauma  in  other  countries  would  also 
contribute  to  support  the  validity  of  the  PTSD/ 
C-PTSD distinction  (Cloitre,  2020).

1. Method

1.1. Participants  and  procedure

The sample involved 384 children ages 6 to 14 (67.2% 
girls;  Mean  age:  9.56,  SD:  2.11)  seeking  services  fol-
lowing disclosure of sexual abuse in a Child advocacy 
centre  in  Montreal,  Quebec,  Canada.  Inclusion  cri-
teria for the study were that the child disclosed sexual 
abuse  and  that  the  case  was  substantiated  by  Child 
Protective  Services.  In  addition,  children  ages  6  to 
14  years  old  had  to  be  referred  for  services  at  the 
Child  Advocacy  Centre,  be  accompanied  by  a  non- 
offending  caregiver  and  speak  English  or  French. 
Exclusion  criteria  were  child  who  do  not  speak 
English  or  French,  or  presented  significant  develop-
mental  delays  making  them  incapable  of  completing 
the  measures.

The  majority  of  children  reported  experiencing 
intra-familial sexual abuse (69.9%) or abuse involving 
a  known aggressor (28.5%).  Only a minority of  cases 
involved  a  stranger  as  the  perpetrator  (1.6%).  Most 
cases  (66.2%)  involved  severe  acts  of  abuse  (penetra-
tion  or  attempted  penetration),  while  (27.4%)  con-
sisted  of  unclothed  touching  and  (6.4%)  clothed 
touching.  Children  reported  chronic  abuse  (38.5%) 
lasting  more than  6  months.

At  their  initial  visit  to  the  centre,  non-offending 
parents  were  invited  to  participate  in  the  study.

the  study  and  the  procedures  which  involved  com-
pletion  of  questionnaires  before  the  therapy  (pre-
treatment)

(posttreatment).  Participants  were  informed  that 
they  could  refuse  to  participate  in  the  study  without 
impacting  the  services  provided  by  the  centre. 
Written  informed  consent  was  obtained  from  all 
parents  and  verbal  consent  was  obtained  from  all 
children. Verbal consent was witnessed and formally 
recorded.  Children  and  the  participating  parents 
were  directed  to  separate  rooms  to  complete  the 
questionnaire  with  the  help  of  a  research  assistant. 
All  procedures 
involving  human  patients  were

(identity  of  the  perpetrator,  sexual  acts  involved, 
duration)  were  assessed  by  an  adapted  version 
the  History  of 
(Hébert  &  Cyr,  2010)  of 
Victimization  Form  (Wolfe,  Gentile,  &  Bourdeau, 
1987),  completed  by  the  clinicians.  Analysis  of  inter- 
rater  reliabilities  based  on  the  coding  of  30  records 
indicated  high  agreement  inter-rater  reliability  with 
a  median  intraclass  correlation  of  .86  and  a  median 
inter-rater  agreement  of  92.8%  (Hébert,  Tremblay, 
Parent,  Daignault,  &  Piché,  2006).

To  reach  our  first  objective,  the  following  mea-
sures  were  used  to  derive  the  PTSD  and  C-PTSD 
symptoms  as  specified for  ICD-11.

1.2.2. PTSD
The  PTSD  subscale  of  the  Children’s  Impact  of 
Traumatic  Events  Scale  II  (CITES  II;  Wolfe,  2002) 
was administered. This instrument assesses the sever-
ity  of  post-traumatic  stress  symptoms  reported  by 
children  with  items  evaluated  on  a  3-point  scale, 
ranging from 0 (false) to 2 (very true). For the latent 
class analysis, items from each of the three criteria of 
Re-Experiencing,  Avoidance,  and  Hypervigilance, 
were  used  and  a  dichotomic  score  was  derived 
where  endorsing  ‘very  true’  to  at  least  one  item  was 
considered symptom  positive.

1.2.3. C-PTSD
Three  sets  of  indicators  of  disturbances  in  self- 
organization were considered as per the ICD-11 diag-
nostics.  Items  were  selected  as  they  were  judged 
directly  or  closely  representative  of  the  symptoms  as 
proposed  in  the  ICD-11.

For  affect  dysregulation,  items  from  the  CITES  II 
reflecting  anger  and  irritability  (for  e.g.  ‘I  get  upset 
over  little  things’)  were  used  and  dichotomized  with 
a  score  of  1,  reflecting  the  presence  of  at  least  one 
manifestation  of  anger  or  irritability.  One  item  from 
the  Revised  Children’s  Manifest  Anxiety  Scale 
(Reynolds  &  Richmond,  1978)  was  used  to  assess 
hurt  feelings  (‘My  feelings  get  hurt  easily’).  For  per-
sistent  beliefs  of  feeling  worthless,  one  item  (‘Other 
kids  are  often  not  happy  with  themselves’)  was 
for 
derived 
Children  (Harter,  1985).  Items  from  the  CITES  II 
were  used  to  assess  feelings  of  guilt  related  to  the 
traumatic  event  (for  e.g.  ‘I  feel  like  I  was  to  blame 
for what happened’). Finally, for persistent difficulties 
in  interpersonal  relationships,  items  reflecting  lone-
liness  (‘I  feel  alone  all  the  time’)  from  the  Children’s 
Depression  Inventory  (Kovacs,  1992)  and  reflecting 
feeling  detached  from  others  from  the  CITES  II  (for 
e.g.  ‘I  did  not  feel  like  playing  or  hanging  out  with 
other  kids’)  were  dichotomized.

To  address  our  second  objective,  the  following 

outcome measures  were  used.

1.2.4. PTSD
The  total  score  (ranging  from  0  to  92)  of  the  PTSD 
subscale  of  the  CITES  II,  described  above  was  used. 
The  internal  consistency  of  the  total  PTSD  score  in 
this  study  was  high  (α  =  .94).

1.2.5. Dissociation
Parents  completed  the  Child  Dissociative  Checklist 
(Putnam,  Helmers,  &  Trickett,  1993)  to  assess  chil-
dren’s  dissociation  symptoms.  This  questionnaire  is 
composed of 20 questions assessed on a 3-point scale 
(0 not true; 2 very true). Total scores range from 0 to 
40. The internal consistency of the score in this study 
was  high  (α  = .82).

1.2.6. Behaviour  problems
Two subscales of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL; 
Achenbach  &  Rescorla,  2001)  were  completed  by  the 
parent to assess the child’s behaviour problems: the inter-
nalizing  behaviour  subscale  (which  includes  symptoms 
such as anxiety, withdrawal and somatic problems) and 
the  externalizing  behaviours  subscale  (which  evaluates 
rule-breaking and aggressive behaviours). For both sub-
scales, a T score was derived. The internal consistency was 
high for both scores (α = .86 for internalizing behaviour 
problems and .92 for externalizing behaviour problems).

2. Data  analytic  plan

Missing  data  analysis  indicated  that  less  than  1%  of 
the  data  were  missing.  No  pattern  of  missing  data 
could  be  identified  (χ2  =  31.35,  df  =  32,  p  =  .49), 
therefore missing data was estimated using Full infor-
mation  maximum  likelihood  (FIML)  (Enders,  2001) 
in  further  analyses.

To achieve our first objective, a Latent Class Analysis 
(LCA)  was  conducted  using  Mplus  8.  This  method  is 
used to identify subgroups in a heterogeneous popula-
tion, using robust standard errors that account for non- 
normality of the data (Lanza & Cooper, 2016). Different 
number of classes were tested subsequently to identify 
the  optimal  class  solution  and  the  following  criteria 
were  used  to  choose the optimal  class  solution (Lanza 
&  Cooper,  2016).  First,  to  compare  the  different  class 
solutions,  the  Akaike  Information  Criterion  (AIC) 
(Akaike,  1987),  the  Bayesian  Information  Criterion 
(BIC)  (Schwarz,  1978),  and  the  adjusted  Bayesian 
Information  Criterion  (aBIC)  (Sclove,  1987)  were 
used; lower values indicate a better fitting class solution. 

Then, the entropy value was used to ensure the differ-
entiation  between  classes,  the  closer  the  entropy  is  to 
one, the better the class differentiate. The Bootstrapped 
Likelihood  ratio  test  (BLRT)  was  used  to  ensure  the 
parsimony of the model. A significant (BLRT) indicates 
that  a  class  solution  is  a  better  fit  than  the  n-1  model 
(Lo,  Mendell,  &  Rubin,  2001).  Last,  the  class  solution 
has  to  be  interpretable.  In  order  to  ascertain  the  dis-
tinctive  features  of  each  class,  a  series  of  chi-square 
analyses were conducted using SPSS 25. Then, pairwise 
comparisons  of  column  proportions  using 
the 
Bonferroni correction, which adjusts the observed sig-
nificance level for the fact that multiple comparisons are 
made, were conducted.

For our second objective, analyses were conducted 
with children who participated in TF-CBT. This ther-
apy  includes  individual  sessions  as  well  as  dyadic 
sessions with the child and the non-offending parent. 
TF-CBT  includes  eight  components  which  spell  out 
the  acronym  PRACTICE:  Psychoeducation  and  par-
enting skills, Relaxation techniques, Affective expres-
sion  and  regulation,  Cognitive  coping,  Trauma 
narrative, In vivo gradual exposure, Conjoint parent-

Mannarino,  & Deblinger,  2017).

sessions,  and  Enhancing 

safety 

Of  the  384  children  who  participated  in  the  initial 
assessment, 20 (5.20%) were not referred to TF-CBT or 
did not start treatment, 2 (0.52%) completed less than 3 
sessions of treatment and posttreatment assessment was 
not available for 36 cases (9.38%). The analyses were thus 
performed with a sample of 326 children who completed 
the  treatment  and  for  whom  posttreatment  data  were 
available.  Pairwise  t-tests  were  performed  to  assess 
changes in symptomatology for each class following TF- 
CBT. The main outcomes considered were internalizing 
and externalizing behaviours problems, PTSD, and dis-
sociation.  To  explore  whether  TF-CBT  was  effective  in 
treating  C-PTSD  symptoms,  pairwise  t-tests  were  con-
ducted for children assigned to the C-PTSD class. Effect 
sizes were computed using Cohen’s d (Cohen, 1977) to 
evaluate the magnitude of changes between pretreatment 
and posttreatment scores.

PTSD,  and  Resilient.  The  expected  probabilities  of 
endorsing  symptoms  within  each  class  are  detailed 
in  Table  2  and  illustrated  in  Figure  1.

The  Complex  PTSD  class  was  characterized  by 
high  probabilities  of  symptom  endorsement  for  all 
indicators  considered  and  describes  23.44%  of  the 
sample. Children in this class reported high probabil-
ities  of  meeting  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  PTSD  as 
well as for disturbances in self-organization symptom 

clusters  including  affect  dysregulation,  negative  self- 
concept  and  interpersonal  problems.

The Classic PTSD class was the largest class, compris-
ing 51.30% of the sample. Children in this class showed 
moderate  (22–39%)  to  high  (69–95%)  probabilities  of 
endorsing  indicators  reflecting  PTSD  and  generally 
lower  probabilities  of  endorsing  symptom  clusters 
reflecting  C-PTSD  although  a  very  high  percentage  of 
children endorsed indicators of anger.

The Resilient class represented 25.26% of the sample 
and describes a profile where children present with low 
probability of symptom endorsement for PTSD symp-
toms  save  for  avoidance  of  thoughts  and  behaviours 
reminders  of  the  trauma  event.  In  addition,  children

in this class showed very low probability of meeting the 
diagnostic criteria for C-PTSD referring to affect dysre-
gulation, negative self-concept, and difficulties in inter-
personal relationships.

The results of Chi-square analyses revealed overall 
significant differences between the three classes for all 
indicators.  Subsequent  paired  comparisons  revealed 
a  gradient  effect  for  all  indicators  but  one.  Thus, 
children  in  the  Complex  PTSD  class  had  the  highest 
probabilities  of  symptom  endorsement,  and  children 
in  the  Resilient  class  had  the  lowest  probabilities  of 
symptom endorsement for indicators, and children in 
the Classic PTSD class, were situated between the two 
other  classes.  The  only  exception  was  found  for 
avoidance  of  thoughts  for  which  the  paired  compar-
ison  revealed  that  children  in  the  Resilient  class  pre-
sented  a  lower probability  of  symptom  endorsement, 
but  this  indicator  did  not  differentiate  children  from 
the  Complex PTSD and  Classic PTSD  class.

The three classes did not differ regarding the chil-
dren’s  mean  age  (F(2,  381)  =  1.40,  p  =  .248),  nor 
family  structure  (single-parent  vs.  not)  (χ2  =  0.34, 
df  =  2,  p  =  .846).  However,  gender  of  the  child  was 
significantly  related  to  classes  (χ2  =  8.78,  df  =  2, 
p  =  .012),  with  pairwise  comparisons  revealing  that 
compared  to  boys,  girls  were  more  likely  to  be 
assigned  to  the  C-PTSD  class.

3.2. Changes  in  symptomatology  following 
TF-CBT  within  classes

To address our second objective, paired t-test analyses 
were conducted to explore possible changes from pre-
for  children 
treatment 

to  posttreatment  scores 

participating  in  TF-CBT  (Figure  2).  Outcomes  mea-
sures  considered  were  continuous  scores  of  child- 
reported PTSD symptoms as well as dissociation symp-
toms,  internalizing  and  externalizing  behaviour  pro-
blems  as  assessed  by  parental  reports.  Paired  t-test 
analyses  showed  an  improvement  following  TF-CBT 
for  children  assigned  to  the  Complex  PTSD  class  and 
children  in  the  Classic  PTSD  class  for  the  continuous 
score  of  PTSD  symptoms,  the  Complex  PTSD  class 
showing a greater change (d = 0.90; 95%CI: 0.63–1.16).
Children  for  all  three  classes  showed  significant 
changes  following  treatment,  revealing  a  decrease  in 
dissociative symptoms  as  well  as  in internalizing  and 
externalizing  behaviour  problems  reported  by  their 
parents.  The  Complex  PTSD  class  consistently 
showed the largest effect size (d = .76–.78), suggesting 
greater improvement following treatment. The results 
are  presented in  Table  3.

Changes  in  C-PTSD  symptoms  (affect  dysregu-
lation,  impairment  in  self-concept,  and  interperso-
nal  relationships)  for  children  in  the  Complex 
PTSD  class  were  also  examined.  Results  revealed 
that  children  showed  significant  improvements  in 
all  three  domains  of  C-PTSD.  Thus,  children 
reported  lower  scores  for  items  assessing  impair-
ment in  self-concept after participating in  TF-CBT

(Pretreatment:  M  =  1.76,  SD  =  .43;  Posttreatment

4. Discussion

the  diversity  of  profiles 

The purpose of this study was to first identify profiles 
of  symptoms,  based  on  the  ICD-11  C-PTSD  model, 
in  a  sample  of  child  victims  of  sexual  abuse.  Our 
in 
findings  highlight 
a treatment-seeking sample of child victims of sexual 
abuse,  as  a  three-class  model  was  identified.  As 
expected,  a  profile  describing  children  showing  clas-
sic  PTSD  symptoms  of  re-experiencing,  avoidance 
and  hypervigilance  emerged  and  regrouped  about 
half  of  the  sample.  Past  studies  have  described 
PTSD  symptoms  as  characteristics  of  child  victims 
of  sexual  abuse,  with  up  to  57%  displaying  clinical 
levels  of  symptoms  (Nooner  et  al.,  2012).  Empirical 
data  has  also  highlighted  the  frequent  presence  of 
multiple  forms  of  maltreatment  (for  e.g.  sexual 
abuse,  exposure  to  partner  violence,  neglect)  in  the 
same  family  and  that  for  a  number  of  trauma- 
exposed  youths,  trauma  is  best  characterized  by  co- 
occurring forms of victimization (Finkelhor, Ormrod, 
&  Turner,  2007).  Symptoms  of  classic  PTSD  would 
fail  to  identify  the  constellation  of  difficulties  experi-
enced  by  children  who  experience  repetitive  and 
chronic  violence  in  an  inadequate  family  environ-
ment  (van  der  Kolk  et  al.,  2009).  Scholars  have  pro-
posed  that  C-PTSD  may  better  describe  the  array  of 
impairments  that  some  children  may show  following 
adverse  life  events  such  as  sexual  abuse.  Our  data 
suggest that for 23% of children, the impact of sexual 

abuse  does  indeed  go  beyond  PTSD  and  they  are 
likely to display as well, manifestations of impairment 
more  akin  to  the  C-PTSD  symptom  cluster.  Our 
analysis  suggests  that,  relative  to  boys,  girls  are 
more  likely  to  be  assigned  to  the  Complex  PTSD 
class,  which  is  consistent  with  past  findings  (Sachser 
et  al.,  2016).

The third class regrouped 25% of sexually abused 
children  that  showed  low  levels  of  PTSD  symptoms 
and  may  be  best  described  as  resilient.  Numerous 
scholars  have  proposed  that  some  sexually  abused 
victims  may  display  better  outcomes  (Domhardt, 
Münzer,  Fegert,  &  Golbeck,  2015;  Marriott, 
Hamilton-Giachritsis,  &  Harrop,  2014).  Not  only 
do  youths  experience  quite  diverse  situations  of 
abuse,  but  it  is  also  highly  improbable  that  all 
have  the  same  personal  competencies  to  deal  with 
the  trauma  and  that  all  benefit  from  the  same 
familial  or  extra-familial  environment 
to  help 
them  in  this  task.  It  is  well  known  that  personal, 
familial,  and  environmental  factors  may  protect 
against  negative  outcomes  following  adverse  life 
events  such  as  child  sexual  abuse  (Masten,  2014). 
For instance, efficient coping skills, parental support 
as well as peer support may lessen the emergence of 
severe  PTSD  symptoms  (Hébert,  Lavoie,  &  Blais, 
2014;  Shapiro,  Kaplow,  Amaya-Jackson,  &  Dodge, 
2012).

improvement  after 

The  second  objective  of  this  study  was  to  examine 
whether TF-CBT was associated with change in symp-
tomatology  for  the  different  classes  identified.  As 
expected,  children  in  the  Classic  PTSD  class  showed 
significant 
they 
reported  less  PTSD  symptoms.  In  addition,  parental 
reports indicated that the therapy was effective in redu-
cing  dissociation  symptoms  as  well  internalizing  and 
externalizing  behaviour  problems.  TF-CBT  was  also 
associated  with  improvement  among  children  in  the 
Complex  PTSD  class,  showing  positive  changes  in 

treatment  as

symptomatology  not  only  for  PTSD  symptoms,  disso-
ciation, and behaviour problems, but also for domains 
included  in  the  C-PTSD  category,  namely  as  affect 
regulation, self-concept and interpersonal relationships. 
In sum, our results offer further support that TF-CBT is 
an  effective  therapy  to  address  the  negative  outcomes 
associated  with  sexual  abuse.  Our  findings  also  high-
light  that  TF-CBT  may  as  well  improve  outcomes  in 
children  displaying  more  complex  symptomatology 
akin to the C-PTSD domains of impairment.

Children classified in the Resilient class did not show 
a significant reduction of PTSD symptoms, which may 
be related to the low levels of PTSD symptoms shown in 
the initial assessment. It is important to note, however, 
that involvement in TF-CBT has nonetheless provided 
for a significant reduction of dissociation, internalizing, 
and  externalizing  behaviour  symptoms.  These  results 
underscore the relevance of providing these children – 
albeit  functioning  at  higher  levels  than  children  from 
the  two  other  classes  –  with  therapy.  Components  of 
TF-CBT,  including  psychoeducation  and  parenting 
skills,  relaxation,  enhancing  personal  safety,  and  con-
joint parent-child sessions with non-offending parents, 
may be essential ingredients to sustain resilience as well 
as means to prevent revictimization, which is unfortu-
nately frequent in child victims of sexual abuse (Walker, 
Freud, Ellis, Fraine, & Wilson, 2019).

4.1. Clinical  implications

Disentangling  the  diversity  of  symptom  profiles  offers 
a  first  step  to  identifying  more  personalized  treatment 
protocols tailored to the needs of each child victim. Our 
findings  underscore  the  relevance  for  mental  health 
professionals  offering  services  to  children  confronted 
to  sexual  abuse,  to  assess  PTSD  as  well  as  C-PTSD 
symptom  clusters.  Assessment  at  clinical  intake  may 
offer  relevant  cues  for  treatment  orientation  that  can 
foster recovery in all child victims of sexual abuse.

Given  the  diversity  of  profiles  in  child  victims  of 
sexual  abuse,  a  modular  approach  to  treatment  may 
be a relevant strategy to consider. A component-based 
approach allowing for flexibility and sequencing using 
a  guiding  clinical  algorithm  has  been  designed  and 
found  to  be  quite  efficient  in  treating  children  with 
anxiety,  depression,  or  conduct  problems  (Chorpita 
et  al.,  2013),  and  could  offer  an  optimal  strategy  to 
promote recovery for all children who have experienced 
sexual  abuse.  An  algorithm,  based  on  the  emerged 
three-class  model,  combined  with  a  detailed  clinical 
assessment  could  be  used  to  orient  treatment  options. 
Children displaying a Classic PTSD profile could ben-
efit  from  TF-CBT  in  the  standard  format,  while  chil-
dren  showing  a  pattern  of  adaptation  similar  to  the 
Resilient  class  could  require  a  smaller  number  of  ses-
sions.  A  periodic  reassessment  could  be  warranted  to 

explore  the  potential  latent  effects  –  symptoms  mani-
festing  if  the  child  is  confronted  to  other  major  life 
events  or  entering  a  specific  developmental  stage  – 
that may trigger the onset of symptoms. TF-CBT with 
additional modules targeting specifically affect dysregu-
lation,  relational  and  social  difficulties  or  aiming  to 
enhance  positive  self-concept  could  be  prioritized  for 
children displaying a profile of Complex PTSD. Such an 
approach  could  optimize  treatment  outcomes.  Results 
reveal that modular treatment is associated with steeper 
trajectories of recovery in children referred for depres-
sion, anxiety, and conduct problems compared to usual 
care or standard treatment (Weisz et al., 2012).

4.2. Limitations

Our  findings  should  be  interpreted  in  light  of  some 
limitations. C-PTSD diagnostics as proposed by ICD-11 
were  modelled  using  a  selection  of  symptoms  derived 
from  other  measures,  as  there  is  presently  no  measure 
specifically developed for assessing C-PTSD in children. 
Our  design  did  not  include  a  follow-up  assessment  to 
ascertain  whether  therapeutic  gains  were  maintained 
over time. Future studies will need to do so and investi-
gate the stability of the emerged three profiles over time. 
Apart from symptomatology, other variables not consid-
ered in the present study could have an impact on treat-
ment  response.  For 
the  non-offending 
caregiver’s  level  of  adherence  to  therapy  and  session 
attendance.  Additional  moderators  of  treatment  out-
comes such as contextual factors (socioeconomic disad-
vantage,  level  of  parental  distress,  etc.)  could  affect 
progress over the course of therapy.

instance, 

In  conclusion,  three  subgroups  of  treatment-seeking 
child victims of sexual abuse could be empirically distin-
guished based on different patterns of symptom presen-
tation.  In  addition  to  identifying  a  profile  of  resilient 
children,  the  latent  class  analysis  provided  evidence  for 
the distinction between PTSD and C-PTSD in children 
confronted to sexual violence. The current therapy, iden-
tified  as  a  best  practice  –  TF-CBT  –  was  found  to  be 
effective  in  fostering  recovery  for  all  children  and  in 
reducing  C-PTSD  symptoms  for  children  assigned  to 
the Complex PTSD class.
