Purpose:  Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT) 
is  a  gold  standard  yet  underuti-
lized  treatment  for  tinnitus,  and  tinnitus  is  especially  highly  prevalent  among  vet-
erans.  The  aims  of  this  study  were  twofold:  to  determine  (a)  if  CBT  for  tinnitus  is 
underutilized  because  participants  find  it  less  acceptable  than  other  behavioral 
treatments  for  tinnitus  and  (b)  if  veterans  and  nonveterans  rate  behavioral  treat-
ments  for  tinnitus  differently. 
Method:  This  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  online  with  a  sample  of  277 
adults  in  the  United  States  who  self-reported  at  least  some  level  of  bothersome 
tinnitus  in  the  past  week.  The  sample  for  this  study  consisted  of  129  veterans 
and  148  nonveterans.  Participants  read  descriptions  of  CBT,  tinnitus  retraining 
therapy  (TRT),  and  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  (MBSR).  For  each  treat-
ment,  presented  to  them  in  random  order,  they  provided  credibility,  expectancy, 
and  acceptability  ratings. 
Results:  Among  277  participants,  147  (53.07%)  reporting  gender  were  women, 
216  (77.98%)  reporting  race/ethnicity  were  White,  and  129  (46.57%)  were  vet-
erans  of  any  branch  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces.  Veteran  ratings  of  credibility, 
lower  than  nonveteran  ratings 
expectancy,  and  acceptability  were  significantly 
across 
in  credibility,  expectancy,  and 
acceptability  ratings  across  treatments,  and  post  hoc  testing  revealed  that  TRT 
was  consistently  rated  higher  than  CBT  or  MBSR. 
Conclusions:  Despite  strong  research  support,  CBT  was  rated  as  less  accept-
able  than  a  different,  less  widely  empirically  supported  treatment.  Veterans’  rat-
ings  of  acceptability  were  lower  than  those  of  nonveterans  across  all  treatments.

Tinnitus  is  the  perception  of  sound  in  the  absence  of 
an  external  stimulus  and  is  often  described  as  a  ringing  or 
hissing  sound  (Baguley  et  al.,  2013;  Bauer,  2018).  If  this

(Lockwood 
et  al.,  2002).  However,  the  majority  of  cases  are  consid-
ered  subjective,  meaning  the  sound  is  only  perceived  by 
the  individual  and  not  tied  to  a  clear  physiological  event 
(Baguley  et  al.,  2013).  Reports  of  tinnitus  prevalence  in 
the  United  States  vary,  with  most  falling  between  4%  and 
15%  of  all  adults  (e.g.,  Møller,  2011).  Tinnitus  can  differ

in  its  level  of  associated  bother,  varying  from  no  bother  to 
severe  impairment.  Recent  efforts  to  define  tinnitus  have 
drawn  attention  to  the  need  to  devise  a  standardized  clini-
cal  definition  of  tinnitus  as  well  as  the  need  to  differenti-
ate  between  the  auditory  percept  and  the  emotional  or 
psychological  distress  caused  by  tinnitus  (De  Ridder  et  al., 
2021).  Perhaps  connected  to  the  psychological  distress  that 
some  people  with 
tinnitus  experience,  researchers  have 
also  identified  comorbid  tinnitus  and  mental  health  com-
plaints  such  as  anxiety  and  depression  to  be  common

2011;  Shargorodsky  et  al.,  2010). 

Currently,  there  is  no  known  reliable  cure  for  sub-
jective  tinnitus  (McFerran  et  al.,  2019;  Searchfield  et  al., 
2011),  although  tinnitus  can  sometimes  subside  with  the

use  of  appropriate  hearing  aids  (Searchfield  et  al.,  2010; 
Shekhawat  et  al.,  2013;  Trotter  &  Donaldson,  2008).  Per-
haps  as  a  result,  many  patients  feel  that  the  treatment  they 
is  not  particularly  effective  (Husain 
receive  for  tinnitus 
et  al.,  2018).  Clinical  guidelines  on  the  management  of  tin-
nitus  encourage  providers  to  spend  time  discussing  treat-
ment  options  with  patients  experiencing  bothersome  tinni-
tus  (Cima  et  al.,  2019;  Tunkel  et  al.,  2014),  but  researchers 
have  estimated  that  only  about  half  (50.6%)  of  patients 
with  tinnitus  discuss  the  issue  with  a  medical  professional 
(Bhatt  et  al.,  2018).  Although  there  are  many  treatments 
for  bothersome 
therapy 
(CBT)  and  hearing  aids  have  had  consistent  empirical  sup-
port  (Hesser  et  al.,  2011;  Manchaiah  et  al.,  2020;  Search-
field  et  al.,  2010;  Shekhawat  et  al.,  2013).  Importantly, 
clinical  guidelines  devised  by  Cima  et  al.  (2019)  note  that 
hearing  aids  are  recommended  for  patients  who  present 
with  hearing  loss  and  tinnitus,  but  not  for  those  who  do 
not  have  hearing 
loss.  Recent  clinical  guidelines  also 
strongly  recommend  the  delivery  of  CBT  to  patients  suf-
fering  from  bothersome  tinnitus  (Cima  et  al.,  2019;  Tunkel 
et  al.,  2014).  Despite  these  guidelines,  in  one  study,  Bhatt 
et  al.  (2018)  found  that  more  patients  report  discussing 
hearing  aids  with  a  medical  professional  (9.2%)  than  CBT 
(0.2%);  they  also  found  that  other  behavioral  treatments 
for  tinnitus  were  discussed  more  often  than  CBT,  includ-

to  know  whether  patients  would  choose 

Since  CBT  for  tinnitus  has  substantial  empirical  sup-
port,  it  is  concerning  that  it  is  so  rarely  discussed  with 
patients,  especially  compared 
less  empirically 
supported  behavioral  treatments.  There  are  multiple  bar-
riers  that  may  be  contributing  to  this  discrepancy,  such  as 
a  lack  of  familiarity  with  tinnitus  among  mental  health  pro-
viders 
(e.g.,  psychiatrists,  psychologists,  social  workers), 
issues  of  insurance  coverage,  and  others.  Attending  to  these 
barriers  would  increase  access  to  CBT  for  tinnitus,  but  it  is 
important 
to 
receive  the  treatment  if  they  had  the  chance.  If  CBT  is  pro-
spectively  less  acceptable  to  patients,  it  may  be  discussed 
initial  tinnitus  treatment  consultations.  To 
less  often 
determine  the  best  steps  to  take  to  improve  access  to  empir-
ically  supported  care  for  tinnitus,  we  must  first  understand 
how  these  treatments  are  perceived  by  people  with  bother-
some  tinnitus.  As  a  result,  we  sought  to  determine  whether 
patients  would  perceive  CBT  more  or  less  acceptable  than 
other,

cussed  with  them.  For  this  study,  we  will  consider  and

combine  multiple  approaches  such  as  progressive  tinnitus 
management  (PTM;  Henry  et  al.,  2010). 

The goal of  CBT  for tinnitus is to reduce tinnitus-
related  distress  through  psychoeducation,  cognitive  restruc-
turing,  and  teaching  the  patient  skills  (e.g.,  progressive 
muscle  relaxation,  challenging  negative  thoughts,  shifting 
attention,  and  others;  Beukes  et  al.,  2021;  Greimel  & 
Kröner-Herwig,  2011).  There  is  substantial  empirical  sup-
port  for  the  efficacy  of  CBT  for  tinnitus,  and  it  is  strongly 
recommended  by  clinical  guidelines  for  treating  tinnitus 
(Cima  et  al.,  2014,  2019;  Hesser  et  al.,  2011;  Manchaiah 
et  al.,  2020;  Tunkel  et  al.,  2014).  Similar  to  CBT,  the  goal 
of  MBSR 
is  to  reduce  tinnitus-related  distress.  MBSR 
employs  mindfulness  meditation  as  a  main  mechanism 
(Kabat-Zinn,  2003;  Roland  et  al.,  2015).  Although  there  is 
less  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of  MBSR  when  compared  to 
CBT,  some  studies  have  found  mindfulness-based  treat-
ments 
(Rademaker 
et  al.,  2019;  Roland  et  al.,  2015).

TRT  attempts  to  leverage  the  neuroplasticity  of  the 
brain’s  auditory  system  to  habituate  to  the  sound  of  tinni-
tus,  decreasing  the  intensity  and  frequency  of  one’s  per-
ception  of  their  tinnitus  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2000, 
2006).  Patients  engage  in  retraining  counseling  and  sound 
therapy  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2000).  Although  there 
are  some  studies  suggesting  the  efficacy  of  TRT  for  reduc-
ing  tinnitus-related  distress  (e.g.,  Bauer  et  al.,  2017),  other 
less  optimism  (e.g.,  Scherer  et  al., 
results  have 
2019).  The  latter  finding  of  TRT  showed  no  clear  advan-
tage  over  standard  care  among  veterans.  Cima  et  al.’s 
(2019)  clinical  guidelines  for  tinnitus  treatment  do  not  pro-
vide  a  recommendation  for  the  use  of  TRT  on  the  basis  of 
a  lack  of  high-level  evidence  for  its  effectiveness.

Tinnitus  and  Veterans 

Tinnitus  is  the  most  common  service-related  disabil-
ity  claim  of  military  veterans  (Karch  et  al.,  2016;  Myers 
et  al.,  2014).  Veterans  are  exposed  to  unique  tinnitus  risk 
factors,  including 
industrial  noise,  auditory  trauma,  and 
blast  exposure  (Burns-O’Connell  et  al.,  2019;  Karch  et  al., 
2016;  Kreuzer  et  al.,  2014;  Moring  et  al.,  2018).  Blast 
exposure  is  an  issue  specifically  related  to  recent  military 
engagements 
is  associated 
in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  and 
with  the  incidence  of  tinnitus,  traumatic  brain  injury,  and 
posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD;  Carlson  et  al.,  2019; 
Kreuzer  et  al.,  2014;  Moring  et  al.,  2018).  These  three 
diagnoses  often  complicate  each  other,  as  veterans  with 
both  tinnitus  and  PTSD  report  more  disturbance  than 
those  with  only 
(Fagelson,  2007;  Fagelson  & 
Smith,  2016).  Furthermore,  tinnitus  in  both  civilian  and 
veteran  samples  is  associated  with  anxiety  and  depression 
(Bhatt  et  al.,  2017;  Carlson  et  al.,  2019),  and  tinnitus  is

(Carlson  et  al.,  2019).  Researchers  have  also  identified  sev-

Acceptability  of  Treatments 

Treatment  acceptability  is  an  often  ill-defined  con-
cept,  as  many  research  teams  have  measured  acceptability 
in  different  ways,  such  as  with  retention  and  recruitment 
rates  (e.g.,  Jones  et  al.,  2018),  thematic  analysis  of  qualita-
tive  interviews  (e.g.,  Finucane  &  Mercer,  2006),  compli-
ance  rates 
`or  others. 
(e.g.,  Scheutzow  et  al.,  2022), 
Sekhon  et  al.  (2017)  have  provided  a  comprehensive  and 
multifaceted  framework  of  acceptability,  including  compo-
nents  such  as  affective  attitude,  burden,  and  perceived 
effectiveness  in  their  definition.  An  important  component 
of  this  framework  is  the  understanding  that  acceptability 
ratings  can  be  taken  before  (prospective),  during  (concur-
rent),  or  after  (retrospective)  partaking  in  a  treatment  and 
that  each  holds  value  for  comprehensively  understanding 
acceptability  (Sekhon  et  al.,  2017).  We  decided  to  follow 
this  framework  for  measuring  acceptability,  supplementing 
our  measurement  with  an  established  measure  of  credibil-
ity  and  expectancy,  which  appeared  to  us  to  overlap  with 
the  concept  of  acceptability.

items.  We  were  interested  primarily 

In  this  study,  we  were  interested  in  comparing  how 
veterans  and  nonveterans  prospectively  rated  CBT,  MBSR, 
and  TRT  for  tinnitus  on  credibility,  expectancy,  and  overall 
acceptability 
in  pro-
spective  ratings  because  we  believe  they  will  most  closely 
capture  the  experience  of  receiving  a  diagnosis  and  discuss-
ing  treatment  options  with  a  health  care  provider.  We  had 
two  main  hypotheses.  First,  we  hypothesized  that  CBT  for 
tinnitus  would  not  be  the  highest-rated  treatment  across 
our  three  outcome  variables,  meaning  TRT,  MBSR,  or 
both  would  be  rated  higher  than  CBT.  Previous  research 
has  shown  CBT  to  be  less  discussed  by  medical  providers 
and  patients  (Bhatt  et  al.,  2018),  which  may  be  indicative 
of  lower  ratings  of  credibility,  expectancy,  and  acceptabil-
ity.  Second,  we  hypothesized  that  veterans  would  rate  all 
three  treatments  lower  on  all  three  outcome  variables  than 
nonveterans.  This  hypothesis  stems  from  research  that  dem-
onstrates  a  multitude  of  related  complications  to  tinnitus 
often  observed  in  veteran  populations  (Carlson  et  al.,  2019; 
Fagelson,  2007;  Karch  et  al.,  2016).  Veterans  with  compli-
cated  cases  of  tinnitus  may  perceive  that  available  treat-
ment  options  do  not  adequately  address  their  specific  needs, 

leading  to  overall  lower  ratings  of  credibility,  expectancy, 
and  acceptability. 

Method 

Participants 

Our  sample  consisted  of  129  veterans  and  148  nonvet-
erans  that  we  recruited  using  Prolific,  an  online  research 
platform.  Prolific  is  free  to  join,  is  open  to  adults  residing  in 
a  variety  of  countries,  and  sets  a  minimum  hourly  rate  for 
payment.  Participants  must  verify  their  identity  before  being 
allowed  to  participate  in  research  studies  in  order  to  protect 
data  quality.  Once  verified,  participants  fill  out  demographic 
questionnaires  in  order  to  match  them  with  research  studies 
seeking  to  recruit  participants  like  them.  Prolific  participants 
are  then  provided  with  a  list  of  studies  they  meet  criteria  for 
that 
includes  a  brief  description  of  each  study,  the  time 
requirement  for  participating,  and  payment.  They  may  then 
select  and  participate  in  any  studies  from  that  list,  which 
periodically  refreshes  with  more  studies. 

All  277  of  our  participants  were  over 

the  age  of 
18  years,  were  fluent  in  English,  resided  in  the  United  States, 
and  self-reported  ringing  in  their  ears.  All  participants  also 
reported  at  least  a  nonzero  level  of  bothersome  tinnitus  on 
an  item  from  the  Tinnitus  Functional  Index  (Meikle  et  al., 
2012),  “Over  the  past  week  how  bothered  have  you  been 
because  of  your  tinnitus  (ringing  in  the  ears).”  This  was  to 
ensure  that  participants  had  at  least  some  level  of  psycholog-
ical  distress  accompanying  their  auditory  distress  as  sug-
gested  by  recent  multidisciplinary  models  of  tinnitus  (Cima 
et  al.,  2019;  De  Ridder  et  al.,  2021).  On  a  scale  from  0  to 
10,  veterans  who  participated  in  the  study  had  an  average 
rating  of  4.42  at  screen.  Nonveterans  who  participated  in  the 
study  had  an  average  rating  of  4.38  at  screen.

Set  1  asks  participants  to  answer  based  on  what  they  think

Item  4  in  Set  1  and  Item  2  in  Set  2,  which  ask  participants

In  addition  to  the  CEQ,  we  added  a  series  of  seven

items  were  scored  on  Likert-type  scales  similar  to  the

Tinnitus  Severity  Short  Form 

The  Tinnitus  Severity  Short  Form  (TS-SF;  Frumkin 
et  al.,  2021)  is  a  10-item  self-report  questionnaire  that  asks 
participants  to  rate  statements  about  their  tinnitus  symp-
toms  over  the  past  week.  In  this  data  set,  the  TS-SF  dis-
played  excellent  internal  consistency  (α =  .95). 

Primary  Care  PTSD  Screen  for  DSM-5 
The  Primary  Care  PTSD  Screen 

(PC-
PTSD-V;  Prins  et  al.,  2016)  is  a  six-item  self-report  question-
naire  used  to  screen  for  PTSD.  The  first  item  briefly  assesses 
if  the  respondent  has  experienced  a  traumatic  event,  followed 
by  five  diagnostic  items.  In  our  sample,  these  five  diagnostic 
items  displayed  acceptable  internal  consistency  (α =  .80).

tered 
Participants  completed  the 
informed  consent  process  at 
the  beginning  of  each  survey  by  reading  an  information 
sheet  about  the  study  so  they  could  decide  whether  they 
wished  to  participate.  Participants  were  recruited  online 
through  a  study  posting  on  Prolific.  All  participants  with 
a  profile  matching  our  inclusion  criteria  (i.e.,  over  the  age 
of  18  years,  residing  in  the  United  States)  gained  access  to 
the  screening  survey  by  seeing  it  appear  in  the  list  of  stud-
ies  they  could  participate 
in.  We  posted  two  separate 
screening  surveys,  including  one  that  we  made  available  to 
indicating  past  military  experience 
potential  participants 
to  participants  who 
and  one 
reported  no  past  military  experience.  We  screened  304 
participants  for  the  veteran  group  and  500  participants  for 
the  nonveteran  group.  Of  those  screened  for  the  veteran 
group,  31  were  ineligible  because  they  did  not  report  mili-
tary  service,  71  were  ineligible  because  they  did  not  report 
any  current  tinnitus,  and  eight  were  ineligible  because  they 
reported  no  bother  from  their  tinnitus  in  the  past  week. 
Of  those  screened  for  the  nonveteran  group,  23  were  ineli-
gible  because 
they  reported  prior  military  service,  200 
were  ineligible  because  they  did  not  report  any  current  tin-
nitus,  and  13  were 
ineligible  because  they  reported  no 
bother  from  their  tinnitus  in  the  past  week.  After  screen-
ing,  we  opened  our  main  survey  to  194  eligible  veterans 
and  264  eligible  nonveterans.

that  we  made  available 

In  the  main  survey,  participants  answered  ques-
tions  about  their  mental  health,  tinnitus  symptoms,  and 

demographics.  Participants  then  viewed  one  of  three  writ-
ten  descriptions  of  a  treatment  for  tinnitus  (CBT,  MBSR, 
or  TRT)  and  were  asked  to  complete  items  related  to  the 
treatment  description.2  These  questions  con-

credibility,  expectancy,  and  acceptability  of  each  treat-
ment.  Descriptions  of  treatments  included  a  summary  of 
their  research  support,  with  the  statement  for  CBT  for  tin-

To  participate  in  studies  posted  on  Prolific,  potential 
participants  are  asked  to  fill  out  questions  to  help  match 
them  with  studies.  Questions  assess  demographics, 
jobs 
and  work  experience,  and  other  domains.  We  used  some 
of  this  information  for  our  study,  including  past  military 
experience,  gender,  age,  ethnicity,  and  hearing  difficulties 
(i.e.,  “Do  you  have  any  hearing 
loss  or  hearing 
difficulties?”). 

(Kassambara,  2021), 

We  completed  all  analyses  in  R,  using  the  following 
packages:  rstatix 
(Rosseel, 
lavaan 
2012),  psych  (Revelle,  2022), 
lme4  (Bates  et  al.,  2015), 
effectsize  (Ben-Shachar  et  al.,  2020),  and  esvis  (Anderson, 
2022).  We  first  calculated  Cronbach’s  alpha  to  evaluate 
the  internal  consistency  of  our  acceptability  items  with  the 
CEQ.  We  conducted  confirmatory  factor  analyses  with  all 
of  the  items  from  the  CEQ  and  all  of  our  acceptability 
items  to  determine  whether  these  items  would  be  best  rep-
resented  by  a  single-factor  model.  In  evaluating  the  fit  of 
our  models,  we  relied  on  the  Tucker–Lewis  incremental  fit 
index  (Tucker  &  Lewis,  1973),  the  comparative  fit  index 
(CFI;  Bentler,  1990), 
root-mean-square  error  of 
approximation  (RMSEA;  Steiger  &  Lind,  1980),  and  the 
standardized  root-mean-square  residual  (SRMR;  Bentler, 
1995).  Recommendations  for  model  fit  index  cutoffs  based 
on  the  work  of  Hu  and  Bentler  (1999)  were  considered. 
We  chose  to  use  the  robust  maximum  likelihood  estimator 
to  fit  our  models.  For  simplicity,  we  also  chose  to  explore 
the  factor  structure  using  data  from  a  single  treatment 
condition  (CBT)  instead  of  all  three  treatments.  Once  we 
established  the  factor  structure,  we  roughly  standardized 
our  variables  before  running  a  mixed  analysis  of  variance 
(ANOVA)  with  repeated  measures.

Including  all  of  the  CEQ  items  and  all  of  the  accept-

(CFI  =  .93,  TLI  =  .91,  RMSEA  =  .14,  SRMR  =  .06), 
and  a  three-factor  model  that  included  covariance  of  two 
CEQ  items  that  were  similarly  worded  (CFI  =  .96,  TLI  =

cantly  lower  ratings.  There  were  also  significant  effects  of

Linear  Mixed-Effects  Models 

Further  testing  revealed  that,  of  the  variables  that  dif-
fered  across  veteran  status,  only  reporting  hearing  difficulties 
had  an  association  with  credibility,  expectancy,  and  accept-
ability  ratings.  Thus,  we  used 
linear  mixed-effects  models 
with  repeated  measures  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  vet-
eran  status,  reporting  hearing  difficulties,  and  the  interaction 
between  these  two  variables  were  predictive  of  credibility, 
expectancy,  and  acceptability  scores.  Across  all  three  models, 
there  were  significant  effects  of  veteran  status  (p s <  .001,  
η2  = .010–.030)  and  hearing  difficulties  (p s < .01,
.009–.020)  but  no  significant  interactions  (p s > .450).

Discussion 

We  hypothesized  that  CBT  for  tinnitus  would  not 
be  rated  the  highest  of  the  three  treatments  across  all  three 
of  our  outcome  variables 
(credibility,  expectancy,  and 
acceptability).  This  hypothesis  was  partially  supported,  as 
TRT  was  rated  significantly  higher  than  CBT  and  MBSR 
in 
terms  of  credibility  and  expectancy.  Although  TRT 
acceptability  scores  were  higher  than  CBT  acceptability 
scores,  this  effect  was  not  significant  after  Bonferroni  cor-
that 
rection.  Although 
research  on  its  efficacy  was  mixed,  providing  less  strong 
research  support  than  CBT  or  MBSR,  TRT  was  rated 
more  favorably  than  the  other  treatments.  Thus,  it  appears 
that  having  more  research  support  was  not  necessarily  asso-
ciated  with  being  a  credible  and  effective  treatment.

We  also  hypothesized  that  veterans  would  rate  all 
less  favorably  than  nonveterans  across 
three  treatments 
each  of  our  outcome  variables.  This  hypothesis  was  sup-
ported,  as  veterans 
rated  credibility,  expectancy,  and

lower  than  nonveterans.  Furthermore,  this 
finding  was  robust  in  post  hoc  testing  that  examined  dif-
ferences  between  veterans  and  nonveterans  on  other  mea-
sured  variables,  including  gender,  highest  level  of  educa-
tion  completed,  and  tinnitus  severity.  This  finding  may 
reflect  the  oftentimes  complex  nature  of  tinnitus  among 
factors,

including  concurrent  diagnoses 
(Carlson  et  al.,  2019; 
Kreuzer  et  al.,  2014),  occupational  auditory  risks  (Moring 
et  al.,  2018),  and  the  possibility  of 
literacy 
(Rodríguez  et  al.,  2013).  In  our  sample,  veterans  were 
more  likely  than  nonveterans  to  report  hearing  difficulties, 
which  may  have  been  a  complicating  factor.  Such  factors 
may  lead  to  veterans  being  less  willing  or  able  to  under-
stand  new  treatments  or  more  pessimistic  about  treatment 
efficacy  if  their  tinnitus  is  complicated  by  other  diagnoses, 
auditory  trauma,  or  hearing  difficulties.  We  also  found  an

physically  identifiable  cause  than  subjective  tinnitus.  Com-
pared  to  treatments  for  hearing  difficulties  that  are  able  to 
directly  address  the  presenting  problem  (e.g.,  a  patient  can 
use  hearing  aids  to  directly  improve  their  hearing),  behav-
ioral  treatments  for  bothersome  tinnitus  may  appear  less 
overtly  helpful.  Treatment  initiatives  designed  for  veterans 
will  need  to  be  mindful  of  credibility,  expectancy,  and 
acceptability,  and  providers  may  need  to  address  veteran 
concerns.  Since  PTM,  the  stepped  care  model  utilized  in 
the  Veterans  Affairs  system,  includes  CBT  for  tinnitus  for 
patients  whose  bothersome  tinnitus  does  not  subside  at

levels,  efforts 

Considering  these  results  against  the  backdrop  of 
current  clinical  guidelines  for  tinnitus  treatment,  there  is  a 
in  the 
clear  disconnect  between  recommended  practices

expectancy,  and  acceptability  of  these  treatments  among 
the  lay  population.  The  empirical  support  of  CBT  for  tin-

ings  among  participants  with  bothersome  tinnitus.  Partici-
pants  instead  favored  TRT,  a  treatment  that  is  not  a  core 
component  of  current  clinical  guidelines.  These  findings 
provide  further  evidence  for  the  need  of  health  care  pro-
viders  to  have  conversations  with  patients  about  current 
options  to  manage  their  tinnitus,  as  well  as  to  provide 
brief  education  on  the  multidisciplinary  nature  of  tinnitus 
discussed  by  De  Ridder  et  al.  (2021). 

Furthermore, 

these  results  may  have 

implications 
for  training  health  care  professionals.  Our  findings  suggest 
that  even  if  access  to  CBT  for  tinnitus  were  increased  by 
familiarizing  primary  care  and  mental  health  providers 
with  treatments  for  tinnitus,  barriers  to  empirically  sup-
ported  care  may  persist.  Further  research  will  be  required 
to  identify  specific  strategies  for  helping  to  improve  the 
perception  of  empirically  based  treatments  such  as  CBT 
for 
the 
treatments,  addressing  common  misconceptions  about 
tinnitus  and  each  treatment,  and  taking  the  time  to  respond 
to  patient  concerns  may  be  a  useful  starting  point. 

focusing  on  accurately  describing 

tinnitus,  but 

Limitations 

Some  limitations  must  be  noted.  First,  these  ratings 
of  credibility,  expectancy,  and  acceptability  were  collected 
from  participants  who  did  not  expect  to  actually  receive 
any  of  the  treatments  during  their  participation.  Although

there  is  clear  value  in  understanding  prospective  accept-
ability,  further  research  will  be  needed  to  understand  con-
current  and  retrospective  acceptability  of  these  treatments 
as  well  (Sekhon  et  al.,  2017).  It  is  possible  that  partici-
pants  would  rate  the  treatments  differently  while  actively 
undergoing  each 
intervention,  which  would  further  our 
understanding  of  the  specific  aspects  of  each  treatment 
that  participants  prefer.  Furthermore,  it  would  be  interest-
ing  to  learn  if  participants’  attitudes  about  each  treatment 
change  after  participating  in  them. 

Second,  since  our  study  sample  was  composed  of 
people  who  self-reported  some  level  of  bothersome  tinnitus 
in  the  past  week,  it  does  not  allow  us  to  specifically  exam-
ine  ratings  from  treatment-seeking  patients  with  tinnitus. 
Treatment-seeking  participants  would  arguably  be  most 
important  to  survey  for  credibility,  expectancy,  and  accept-
ability  ratings,  but  our  study  was  not  designed  to  differenti-
ate  between  treatment-seeking  and  not–treatment-seeking 
people  with  tinnitus. 

Third,  we  did  not  assess  duration  of  tinnitus  in  this 
study.  Duration  of  tinnitus  may  have  an  effect  on  the  pro-
spective  credibility,  expectancy,  and  acceptability  of  treat-
ments  and  will  need  to  be  examined  in  future  work. 

Conclusions 

The 

finding 

that  veterans  and  nonveterans  rated 
TRT  higher  than  CBT  or  MBSR  on  credibility  and  expec-
tancy  measures,  as  well  as  rated  TRT  higher  than  MBSR 
on  an  acceptability  measure,  provides  avenues  for  future 
investigation.  First,  although  we  would  expect  patients  to 
consider 
treatments  with  more  empirical  support  more 
credible,  this  does  not  appear  to  necessarily  be  the  case  in 
our  sample.  Second,  further  investigation  will  be  necessary 
to  determine  what  specific  aspects  of  these  treatments  are 
more  and  less  acceptable.  In  addition,  the  finding  that  vet-
those  reporting  hearing  difficulties  rated  all 
erans  and 
three  treatments 
less  favorably  across  all  three  outcome 
variables  compared  to  nonveterans  or  those  without  hear-
ing  difficulties  has  important  public  health  implications. 
Researchers  have  already  identified  veterans  as  a  poten-
tially  difficult  population 
(e.g., 
Rodríguez  et  al.,  2013),  and  our  findings  appear  to  sup-
is  needed  to  further 
port  this  concern.  Future  research 
examine  the  significant  difference  between  veterans’  and 
nonveterans’  perceptions  of  credibility,  expectancy,  and 
acceptability,  as  well  as  how  best  to  reach  patients  who 
are  skeptical  of  treatments  for  tinnitus.  Furthermore,  these 
findings  suggest  a  divide  between  current  clinical  guide-
lines  for  tinnitus  and  public  perceptions  of  treatment  effi-
cacy.  As  a  result,  these  findings  provide  further  evidence 
for  the  need  to  have  educational  conversations  between 

treatment 

to  reach 

for 

health  care  providers  and  patients  to  explain  the  options 
available  to  manage  bothersome  tinnitus.
