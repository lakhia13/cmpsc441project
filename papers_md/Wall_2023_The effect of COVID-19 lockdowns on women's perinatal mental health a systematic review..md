Background: Risk factors for poor maternal perinatal mental health include a previous mental health diagnosis, 
reduced access to perinatal services, economic concerns and decreased levels of social support. Adverse maternal 
perinatal  mental  health  can  negatively  influence  the  psychological  wellbeing  of  infants.  The  outbreak  of  the 
COVID-19 pandemic presented an additional stressor. While literature on the impact of COVID-19 on perinatal 
mental health exists, no systematic review has focused specifically on maternal perinatal mental health during 
periods of COVID-19 lockdown. 
Aims: This systematic review explores how periods of COVID-19 lockdown impacted women’s perinatal mental 
health. 
Methods: Searches of CINAHL, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were conducted 
for literature from 1st January 2020–25th May 2021. Quantitative, peer-reviewed, cross-sectional studies pub-
lished in English with perinatal women as participants, and data collected during a period of lockdown, were 
included. Data was assessed for quality and narratively synthesized. 
Findings:  Sixteen  articles  from  nine  countries  met  the  inclusion  criteria.  COVID-19  lockdowns  negatively 
impacted perinatal mental health. Risk factors for negative perinatal mental health noted in previous literature 
were confirmed. In addition, resilience, educational attainment, trimester, and ethnicity were identified as other 
variables  which  may  influence  mental  health  during  perinatal  periods  experienced  during  lockdown.  Under-
standing  nuance  in  experience  and  harnessing  intra  and  interpersonal  support  could  advance  options  for 
intervention. 
Conclusion: Developing resources for perinatal women that integrate informal sources of support may aid them 
when normal routine is challenged,  and may  mediate potential long-term  impacts of poor  perinatal maternal 
health on infants.   

Statement of significance 

Problem 

Poor mental health during the perinatal period is concerning for 
mother and infant. Did periods of COVID-19 lockdown exacerbate 
this experience? 

What is already known 

A previous mental health diagnosis, reduced access to perinatal 
services, decreased levels of social support and economic concerns 
are risk factors for poor perinatal mental health. The COVID-19 
pandemic  created  another  stressor.  No  review  exists  focusing 

specifically on the impact of lockdown periods on perinatal mental 
health. 

What this paper adds 
This  article  synthesises  research  on  women’s  perinatal  mental 
health during periods of lockdown. It identifies risk and protective 
factors,  and  potential  areas  for  intervention,  during  times  of 
restriction.

Dempsey                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

months  post birth,  can result in a  range of psychological and  physio-
logical changes for women [1,2]. During this time, changes may also be 
observed  in  the  perinatal  woman’s  relationship  with  her  partner,  her 
family and her wider social network [3]. Such developments can nega-
tively impact women’s perinatal mental health. While prevalence rates 
varied  globally,  it  was  estimated  that  up  to  20%  of  women  would 
experience  a  perinatal  mental  health  problem  [4].  This  included 
obsessive-compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
anxiety,  depression  or  postpartum  psychosis  [2].  In  Ireland  and  the 
United  Kingdom  (UK),  the  leading  cause  of  death  in  women  during 
pregnancy, and in the first year following birth, was suicide [4]. 

Poor perinatal mental health not only affects the woman: it has also 
been linked with short- and long- term psychological development and 
wellbeing of infants [4]. Stress and anxiety during pregnancy can lead to 
infants exhibiting less social and perceptual competencies at birth [5], as 
well as being less emotionally stable due to reduced levels of emotional 
self-regulation [6]. Longitudinal studies have suggested an association 
with antenatal depression and increased emotional problems for chil-
dren  [7–9],  and  have  been  linked  with  insecure  attachment  between 
mother and child [10,11]. Longitudinal studies indicated that antenatal 
depression increased the risk of depression during adolescence [12,13]. 
They  highlighted  an  association  between  postnatal  depression  and 
children’s  externalising  behaviours,  up  to  the  age  of  16,  particularly 
symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [14–17]. Postnatal 
depression has also been linked with children’s general cognitive and 
language  development,  and  has  impacted  the  ability  to  learn  and  to 
achieve developmental milestones [17–20]. 

In  addition  to  this  human  cost,  financial  expenditure  has  been 
associated with perinatal mental health difficulties. For example, in the 
UK,  the  estimated  outlay  of  perinatal  mental  health  problems  was 
£8.1bn per year [4]. This cost was five times greater than the estimated 
budget of improving perinatal services [4]. 

Several risk factors were recognised as contributing to poor perinatal 
mental  health,  including  a  previous  mental  health  diagnosis  [21],  a 
tumultuous relationship with life partner [22], social isolation, lack of 
social support [23–25], and economic concerns linked to unemployment 
and low-income [26–28]. Additionally, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
was, and continues to be, a further stressor with which women in the 
perinatal period contend. 

The  first  cases  of  COVID-19,  an  infectious  disease  caused  by  the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 
[29,30]. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of In-
ternational Concern (PHEIC) in January 2020 and later in March 2020 
COVID-19 was classed as a pandemic [31].  In an effort to curtail the 
spread of the virus, many countries imposed movement restrictions and 
physical distancing measures, commonly referred to as lockdowns [31]. 
Lockdowns slowed the transmission of the disease, yet restrictions have 
negatively  impacted  individual’s  social  lives  [31].  Further,  people 
experienced  increased  financial  pressure  [32,33],  social  isolation  and 
reduced access to professional services [34,35].

COVID-19  lockdown  restrictions  have  resulted  in  some  perinatal 
women  having to substitute onsite hospital appointments with online 
healthcare appointments [36]. Restrictions have also meant less social 
support  from  friends  and  family,  increased  feelings  of  isolation, 
heightened 
remote  working, 
home-schooling  and  overcrowded  homes  and  increased  incidences  of 
domestic  violence  [36].  All  of  these  variables  have  the  potential  to 
negatively impact perinatal mental health. A particular example of the 
impact of COVID-19 restrictions on perinatal healthcare was observed in 
Ireland where restrictions in maternity hospitals led to national protests. 
Specifically, partners were banned from attending prenatal scans and in 
some cases, from attending births [37]. These restrictions caused stress 
and uncertainty for mothers-to-be, partners, family members and hos-
pital  staff  [37].  The  impact  of  poor  perinatal  mental  health  is  far 
reaching and COVID-19 has further complicated a time already fraught 
with complexities. 

1.1. Rationale for current systematic review 

Much literature has been published on the impact of COVID-19 on 
perinatal  mental  health  from  the  perspective  of  various  stakeholders, 
including women in the perinatal period, their partners, hospital staff 
and  policymakers.  However,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  having 
searched  all  available  global  databases  using  a  set  of  comprehensive 
Boolean search protocols, no systematic review has been done to date 
solely  focusing  on  perinatal  women’s  experiences  during  periods  of 
COVID-19 lockdown and specifically how lockdown has impacted their 
perinatal mental health. As there is no end date for the pandemic, it is 
imperative we understand the effect restrictions have had on women’s 
perinatal  mental  health  in  order  to  advance  understanding  of  best 
practice in supporting perinatal women, during and after the pandemic. 
Additionally, the findings of this review may also be applicable to in-
dividuals within society who are regularly cut off from services outside 
of the pandemic due to socio-demographic factors. 

2. Methods 

To determine the utility of conducting a systematic review, this study 
started broadly by completing a scoping review to clarify key concepts 
and  identify  gaps in  the  literature.  The  subsequent  systematic  review 
was reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [38]. 

2.1. Search strategy 

A  systematic  review  protocol  was  registered  with  PROSPERO.  Six 
electronic  databases  (CINAHL,  PsycARTICLES,  PsycINFO,  PubMed, 
Scopus  and  Web  of  Science)  were  searched  to  identify  literature  on 
perinatal  mental  health  during  periods  of  COVID-19  lockdown,  pub-
lished  between  1st  January  2020  and  25th  May  2021.  The  search 
strategy  combined  Boolean  operators  and  truncation  with  Medical 
Subject Headings (MeSH), keywords, CINAHL Subject Headings and the 
APA Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms. Keywords and their syn-
onyms were combined using the following search string: (Perinatal OR 
Pregnan* OR Antenatal OR Prenatal OR Postnatal OR Postpartum OR 
Post-partum  OR  Maternal  OR  Breastfeeding  OR  Intrapartum)  AND 
("Perinatal  mental  health"  OR  "Mental  health"  OR  Mood  OR  "Mental 
wellbeing" OR Psychological OR Psycho* OR Psychiatric) AND (COVID- 
19 OR COVID* OR Coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (Lockdown OR 
restriction*  OR  limitation*  OR  “social  distancing”  OR  “physical 
distancing” OR “cordon sanitaire” OR shutdown OR shut-down OR “shut 
down” OR shelter-in-place OR “shelter in place”  OR safer-at-home OR 
“safer at home” OR stay-at-home OR “stay at home” OR curfew). 

2.2. Eligibility criteria 

For  this  review,  women  in  the  perinatal  period  were  defined  as: 
women receiving prenatal or antenatal care, women who were pregnant 
at the time of data collection, women who were intrapartum or who had 
recently  given  birth,  postpartum  women,  women  in  the  postnatal 
period,  and  women  who  were  breastfeeding  within  the  first  year  of 
giving birth. Inclusion criteria were that articles had to be quantitative, 
peer-reviewed, published in English, and data must have been collected 
during a period of lockdown. Articles which did not explicitly state that 
data had been gathered during a period of lockdown, but which pro-
vided specific dates that could be verified, were included in the review. 
Exclusion criteria were articles not published in English, articles linked 
to other stakeholders such as hospital staff, partners and policymakers, 
and grey literature (e.g., annual reports, newsletters, theses). 

2.3. Data screening and extraction 

Results from the electronic search were exported to Rayyan - a web

application which supported removal of duplicates and streamlined the 
screening  process.  The  study  selection  process  was  summarised  in  a 
PRISMA flowchart (Fig. 1). Following removal of duplicates, the primary 
researcher  (PR)  carried  out  title  and  abstract  screenings  on  the 
remaining articles to determine eligibility. Prior to the full text review, 
reviewers clarified specifics of the inclusion criteria. The PR screened 
100% of articles eligible for a full text review while a second reviewer 
(SR) independently carried out a full text screening on 35% of the ar-
ticles. There were no disagreements about full text exclusion decisions. 
Data extracted from eligible studies consisted of: author(s) name, year of 
publication,  study  location,  sample  size,  measures  and  findings 
(Table 1). 

2.4. Risk of bias assessment 

All  studies  were  independently  assessed  for  potential  risk  of  bias 

using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool 
for  Observational  Cohort  and  Cross-Sectional  Studies  [39].  This  tool 
provided a checklist which allowed articles to be qualitatively rated as 
good, fair or poor. 

2.5. Quality assessment 

Quality appraisal using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Obser-
vational  Cohort  and  Cross-Sectional  Studies  [39]  indicated  that  the 
majority of studies were of fair quality, and three were determined to be 
of good quality i.e., [40,49,53]. Due to the parameters of the current 
review  study,  four  questions  on  the  NIH  assessment  tool  were  not 
applicable (Q8, Q10, Q12 and Q13). No studies were excluded on the 
basis of the quality assessment. The quality appraisal ratings are pre-
sented in supplementary material 1.

MHO: Anxiety prevalence rate approx. 60%. 38% of pp reported depressive 
symptoms. RFs DEP & ANX: Existence of mental health disorders and low levels 
of social support. TRI: Depression scores higher for women in 1st & 2nd 
trimester, compared to 3rd trimester.  
MHO: Depressive symptoms higher during pregnancy and postpartum 
compared to pre-COVID-19 estimates. Increased levels of anxiety reported 
throughout lockdown.  
MHO: Pp anxiety levels negatively impacted during initial stages of lockdown. 
Anxiety levels decreased after original peak during 1st week. RFs ANX: 1st week 
following lockdown and being in 3rd trimester. RF DEP: Antenatal depression 
linked with state anxiety.  
MHO: 58% of pp indicated positive screening for depressive and anxiety 
symptoms. RFs: Physical health, mental health & economic worries, particularly 
post week 3 of lockdown. PMHD: Previous diagnosis of depression or anxiety 
not identified as RF.  
MHO: Pp experienced loneliness, irritability, worries and felt down to ‘some’ or 
‘high’ extent since lockdown began. Most pp felt they could cope, and felt 
connected with friends and family. RF: Lower economic status predicted poorer 
maternal mental health. PFs: Women who received formal and informal support 
experienced better maternal coping.  
MHO: 43% of pp reported clinically significant depression compared to 11.4% 
with existing clinical diagnosis of depression. 61% reported clinically significant 
anxiety compared to 18.4% of pp with existing clinical diagnosis of anxiety. 
Feelings of depression, anxiety and anxiety about motherhood increased. RFs: 
Perceived psychological changes during lockdown predicted variance in risk for 
depression (30%) and anxiety (33%) symptoms. Perceived social changes were 
not significantly associated with increased risk.  
MHO: 11.1% of pp met criteria for anxiety. 9.9% met criteria for depression. 
Black pp more likely to be depressed (16.2%) and anxious (13.9%) than white pp 
(7.9% and 11%, respectively). RES: Higher levels of resilience through (i) 
increased self-reliance and emotional regulation and (ii) increased emotional 
regulation and experiencing less hostile close relationships reduced risk of 
anxiety and depression, respectively. Findings not moderated by race.  
MHO: Approx. 50% of pp reported clinically significant scores for perinatal 
depression and anxiety. 62% of pp experienced loneliness and social isolation. 
SS: Lower perceived ss was linked with more anxiety and depressive symptoms, 
loneliness and RNT. Loneliness and RNT mediated effect of perceived ss on 
anxiety and depression. TRI: Trimester significantly impacted EPDS, PASS and 
RNT scores, with lower scores reported in 2nd trimester.  
MHO: Nearly 50% of pp indicated clinically significant scores for perinatal 
depression and anxiety, with significant associations between RNT and anxiety 
and depression. SS: Higher levels of perceived ss from friends moderated 
negative effects of RNT on anxiety and depression. Family and partner support 
did not act as a buffer.  
MHO: Regional differences demonstrated in depressive symptoms. RES: Higher 
resiliency levels predicted lower depressive symptoms.  
MHO: High prevalence rates of clinically significant anxiety and depression 
during the lockdown. Depression and anxiety were significantly positively 
correlated. PMHD: State anxiety higher in pp with comorbid psychotic or 
depressive disorders. Pp with previous psychiatric diagnoses scored higher on 
the EPDS. EMP: Lower economic status increased pp risk of experiencing 
depressive symptoms and increased state anxiety. RES: Scores linked with 
education and income. Practicing coping strategies predicted higher resilience. 
Scores moderately negatively correlated with depression and anxiety.  
MHO: Lockdown led to significant increases in maternal anxiety. PMHD: 
Increased state anxiety related to pre-existing anxiety. EDU: Pp with lower 
education level displayed less state anxiety. EMP: Employment status not a 
significant factor for anxiety.

felt sadder (42%); angrier (15%); reported thoughts of self-harm (0.74%) and 
experienced suicidal thoughts (0.95%). ANC: Approx. 60% of pp did not receive 
ANC post lockdown, compared to 4% prior to lockdown.  
MHO: Pp reported: severe/extremely severe depression (14%), severe/ 
extremely severe anxiety (11%) and severe/extremely severe stress (40%). RFs: 
For anxiety - having a tertiary education; for stress - being in 3rd trimester. TRI: 
Between 1st & 3rd trimester, stress nearly doubled.  
MHO: 14.7% of pp at risk for postnatal depression. Pp with depression scored 
significantly lower maternal attachment scores.  
MHO: Pp demonstrated anxiety (21.7%) and PTSD (10.2%) symptoms. PMHD: 
Previous psychopathology associated with higher levels of psychological 
distress. Pp with history of depression or anxiety more worried about COVID-19 
and at increased risk of developing anxiety or PTSD symptoms during lockdown.

2.6. Data synthesis 

tool. 

Due to variability in measures and outcomes of the included studies, 
the data set was deemed clinically heterogeneous [56]. Where hetero-
geneity exists, a narrative synthesis is deemed the most appropriate way 
to  synthesise  the  data  [57].  Narrative  synthesis  employed  a  textual 
approach to the way findings were integrated and facilitated exploration 
of similarities and differences among studies [58]. Quantitative mental 
health outcome data, as well as additional findings relating to potential 
risk  and  protective  factors  affecting  perinatal  mental  health  during 
lockdown, were reported in a narrative format. The narrative synthesis 
was guided by Popay et al. [59], specifically in developing a preliminary 
synthesis through textual descriptions and tabulation, as well as explo-
ration of relationships in the data. To support presenting the data in a 
narrative  format,  a  thematic  approach  to  analysing  the  findings  was 
utilised [60]. 

3. Results 

Sixteen articles were included in the review. The initial electronic 
database search yielded 317 records and 203 duplicates were removed. 
Following title and abstract screenings, 57 articles were excluded and 57 
articles were retained for a full text review. Of these, one article could 
not be retrieved therefore 56 articles were fully reviewed. Forty articles 
were excluded. There were seven reasons for exclusion (See Fig. 1). The 
most common reason linked to study design and included not being a 
quantitative  study  and  data  not  being  collected  during  a  period  of 
COVID-19 lockdown. 

3.1. Study characteristics 

Twelve  articles  provided  clinical  scores  for  depressive  symptoms 
[40–43,45–50,53,54]. Twelve articles reported clinical scores for anxi-
ety symptoms [40–43,45–48,50,51,53,55]. One article included clinical 
stress scores [53] and one reported scores for clinical PTSD symptoms 
[55]. Two articles reported subjective, non-clinical mental health out-
comes  [44,52].  In  addition  to  reporting  mental  health  outcomes,  13 
articles provided information on additional risk and protective factors 
identified  which  impacted  perinatal  mental  health  during  periods  of 
lockdown [40,42–48,50–53,55]. 

Two primary themes were identified in the data set: (i) mental health 

outcomes and (ii) risk and protective factors. 

3.2. Mental health outcomes 

Clinically significant depression symptoms were reported in all 12 
studies which screened for depression, with rates ranging from 9.9% to 
49% of participants [40–43,45–50,53,54]. Clinically significant anxiety 
symptoms were experienced by women in 12 studies which screened for 
anxiety, with rates ranging from 11% to 61% [40–43,45–48,50,51,53, 
55]. PTSD symptoms were experienced by 10.2% of participants [55], 
while significant stress symptoms were reported by 40% of women in a 
separate study [53]. Social isolation and loneliness were experienced by 
62% of participants [47]. More than 50% of participants experienced 
feeling lonely, irritable and down, and more than 70% of these partic-
ipants experienced worry to either ‘some extent’  or to a ‘high extent’ 
since the beginning of lockdown [44]. One study noted 0.95% of par-
ticipants reported suicidal thoughts and 0.74% of participants experi-
enced thoughts of self-harm [52]. A second study [50] found that 4.2% 
of respondents reported thoughts of harming themselves. 

Over half of the studies were published during the first year of the 
pandemic [40–42,44,46,47,51,52,55]. Sample sizes varied significantly, 
ranging from 70 to 5866 participants, with data collected from a total of 
13401 women across the 16 studies. While more than 60% of the studies 
focused solely on pregnant women as participants [40,42,46,47,49–53, 
55], numbers of pregnant and postpartum women recruited were rela-
tively  equally  distributed  (7209  and  6192,  respectively).  Thirteen 
studies were conducted within Europe, with the remaining three con-
ducted in North America [46], Asia [52] and Africa [53]. 

All 16 studies utilised a cross-sectional research design. Twenty-two 
self-report  measures  were  used.  Each  study  that  reported  clinical 
symptoms employed standardised measures. Diagnostic screening tools 
were not noted and two studies [44,52] did not use a formal assessment 

3.3. Risk and protective factors 

3.3.1. Previous mental health diagnosis 

Five  articles  examined  the  effects  of  previous  mental  health  di-
agnoses on current mental health outcomes [40,43,50,51,55]. Four of 
these articles indicated that a previous mental health diagnosis appeared 
to be a significant risk factor for current poor mental health outcomes. 
State anxiety was related to previous trait anxiety [51], and was higher 
in women with comorbid psychotic  or depressive disorders [50]. The 
presence  of  mental  health  disorders  was  indicative  of  increased 
depressive and anxiety symptoms [40] while previous psychopathology 
was  associated  with  higher  levels  of  psychological  distress  [55]. 
Conversely, being previously diagnosed with depression or anxiety was

not indicative of current depressive or anxiety symptoms [43]. 

to pregnancy during COVID-19 [46]. 

3.3.2. Support and social changes 

3.3.5. Education 

The concept of support was reported in six of the 16 articles [40,44, 
45,47,48,52],  with  both  informal  and  formal  support  discussed. 
Informal support from a partner, family or friends provided social sup-
port  in  terms  of  affection,  positive  social  interaction  and  emotional 
support, peer support in relation to validation and empathy, as well as 
practical support with household chores. Formal support from health-
care providers offered professional, informational and practical support 
to  women.  Women  reported  that  support  with  their  own  health,  and 
contacting  infant  support  groups,  predicted  better  mental  health. 
Further, women who were supported with their own health as well as 
who experienced a more equal splitting up of household chores were 
associated with better maternal coping [44]. Participants who perceived 
receiving lower levels of social support displayed increased anxiety and 
depressive  symptoms,  were  absorbed  in  more  repetitive  negative 
thinking  (RNT)  and  experienced  more  loneliness  [47].  While  higher 
levels of perceived support from friends lessened the negative effects of 
RNT on anxiety and depression, family member or partner support was 
not found to act as a buffer [48]. Loneliness and RNT mediate the effect 
of perceived social support on anxiety and depression [47]. Low levels of 
social  support  were  indicative  of  increased  depressive  and  anxiety 
symptoms  [40].  While  relationships  with  partners,  feelings  towards 
their baby, level of social support and satisfaction with healthcare pro-
vision  were  negatively  affected  by  lockdown  measures,  these  factors 
were  not  significantly  correlated  with  increased  risk  of  depressive  or 
anxiety symptoms [45]. Pregnant women experienced major changes in 
the provision of antenatal care due to lockdown: antenatal care ceased 
for almost 60% of women, compared to 4% prior to lockdown [52]. 

3.3.3. Economic considerations 

One  quarter  of  studies  included  information  relating  to  economic 
considerations  and  how  these  factors  impact  mental  health  outcomes 
[44,50,51,53].  One  UK  based  study  found  that  travelling  for  work, 
inability to afford food as a result of lockdown, and having an income 
less  than  £30,000  (or  equivalent)  predicted  poorer  maternal  mental 
health [44]. Participants with lower incomes, or who were unemployed, 
were at increased risk of developing depressive symptoms [50]. While 
low or decreased income predicted increased state anxiety in one study 
[50], employment status was not found to be a significant factor for state 
or trait anxiety in an alternative study [51]. Women with an occupation 
which required physical contact such as a trader, farmer or artisan were 
at higher risk for depression [53]. 

3.3.4. Resilience 

Resilience, the ability to competently deal with adversity [46,61], 
was  examined  in  three  studies  [46,49,50].  Women  presenting  with 
higher  levels  of  resilience  demonstrated  lower  depressive  symptoms 
[49].  Resilience  varied  by  geographical  location,  and  was  related  to 
sleep  disturbances  and  obsessive  or  catastrophic  thoughts  about  the 
pandemic [50]. Women with the lowest incomes demonstrated the most 
resiliency,  followed  by  those  that  earned  the  highest  incomes  [50]. 
Women who were used to practicing coping strategies such as painting, 
cooking, physical exercise or relaxation techniques demonstrated higher 
resiliency than those who were not used to practicing coping strategies 
[50]. Greater resilience through increased self-reliance and emotional 
regulation  reduced  participant’s  risk  of  anxiety  [46],  while  resilience 
through  increased  emotional  regulation  and  experiencing  less  hostile 
close relationships reduced participant’s risk of depression [46]. Women 
with  more  resilience  due  to  increased  emotional  regulation  and  per-
ceptions  of  neighbourhood  safety  reduced  general  worries  related  to 
COVID-19,  while  women  with  more  emotional  regulation  and  who 
experienced less hostile close relationships had fewer pregnancy specific 
worries  due  to  COVID-19.  Additionally,  higher  levels  of  resilience 
through increased self-reliance were also linked with concerns specific 

Although 62.5% of studies provided information pertaining to par-
ticipants’  level  of  educational  attainment  [44,45,47–54],  only  two 
studies examined possible relationships between education and mental 
health  outcomes  [51,53].  Women  who  held  a  university  degree  or 
diploma displayed more state anxiety than women with lower levels of 
education [51],  while having a  tertiary  education was identified  as  a 
predictor of anxiety and stress [53]. 

3.3.6. Trimester 

Seven  of  the  studies  included  the  breakdown  of  participants  by 
trimester [40,46,47,51–53,55], however just four studies provided in-
formation  about  relationships  between  trimester  and  mental  health 
outcomes  [40,42,47,53].  Being  in  the  third  trimester  acted  as  a  risk 
factor for anxiety [42] and stress [53], with stress scores almost doubled 
for women in the third trimester in comparison to those in their first 
trimester [53]. Depression scores were found to be higher for women in 
their  first  and  second  trimester,  compared  to  those  in  their  third 
trimester [40]. Trimester had a significant effect on perinatal depression 
and anxiety scores, as well as RNT scores, with significantly lower scores 
found in the second trimester [47]. 

3.3.7. Ethnicity 

Though the ethnic breakdown of participants was provided in seven 
studies [40,44–48,51], it was not widely used to identify associations 
with  mental  health  outcomes.  One  study  found  that  being  of 
Latin-American origin was a predictive factor for anxiety [40], while a 
separate study focused primarily on racial disparities [46]. Black women 
were more likely to demonstrate depressive and anxious symptoms than 
white women, with evident differences in the way financial concerns, 
access to prenatal care and resources, and resilience were experienced 
by black and white women [46]. 

4. Discussion 

COVID-19  lockdowns  initiated  unexpected,  unprecedented  change 
for all, across myriad domains of living. It has been a transformative life 
event.  As  such,  the  finding  that  a  significant  proportion  of  women 
experienced poor perinatal mental health during lockdown is somewhat 
unsurprising. Our findings are mostly consistent with prior literature in 
the  area.  However,  this  review  extends  previous  findings  by  further 
unpacking some of the identified risk factors and highlighting potential 
areas for intervention. 

Risk factors for poor perinatal mental health identified prior to, and 
during the pandemic, included having a previous mental health diag-
nosis; social isolation; a lack of social support; economic pressures; and 
relationship stresses between the perinatal woman and her partner. This 
review  concurred  with  these  findings,  albeit  for  the  occasional 
discrepancy.  For  example,  having  a  previous  mental  health  diagnosis 
appeared to be a risk factor for poor perinatal mental health [40,50,51, 
55] reiterating findings by Johnstone et al. [21]. However, [43] noted 
that a previous mental health diagnosis was not identified as a signifi-
cant risk factor for current depressive or anxiety symptoms. This lack of 
identified association could be due to the low rate of cases: only 166 
women, 22% of the sample, indicated having a previous diagnosis. 

Clinically significant depression and anxiety rates were reported in 
the majority of studies. The findings that participants reported feeling 
lonely,  down,  irritable,  and  worried  since  the  beginning  of  lockdown 
[44] echo those of Bauer et al. [4]. They are stark from both short, and 
long, term perspectives. Specifically, in terms of the former, the social 
isolation  heralded  by  lockdown  dovetailed  with  added  difficulties 
accessing timely professional support. In terms of the latter, as noted by 
Oskovi-Kaplan  et  al.  [54],  participants  who  were  depressed  scored 
significantly lower maternal attachment scores. Research has suggested 

WomenandBirth36(2023)47–5552S. Wall and M. Dempsey                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

antenatal depression is linked with insecure attachments [10,11]. This is 
pertinent  in  terms  of  ongoing,  and  longer-term,  implications  for  the 
wider  familial  unit.  Insecure  attachments  in  early  childhood  can 
contribute to psychopathology in later life [62]. As such, poor perinatal 
maternal  health  signifies  a  risk  factor  for  child  mental  health.  In  in-
stances  where  support  needs  are  met  by  extended  family  members, 
ensuring that professional intervention explicitly identifies commonal-
ity in parenting values is important. Doing so may diminish the possi-
bility  of  parenting  support  becoming  contentious  or  aggravating  in 
terms of mental health. Timely, focused intervention in this area could 
proactively  insulate  against  ongoing  transgenerational  mental  health 
issues. 

Of 13401 participants included across 16 studies, 1458 were asked 
whether they experienced thoughts of self-harm and 944 were probed 
about  suicidal  ideation.  Of  these  participants,  31  women  reported 
thoughts of self-harm, and nine reported experiencing suicidal thoughts. 
Initially these numbers may seem low in relation to the overall sample 
size. However, as suicide was identified as the primary cause of death 
among perinatal women [4], the dearth of research pertaining to this 
area  is  cause  for  concern.  Given  that  all  included  studies  focused  on 
perinatal  mental  health,  had  more  studies  included  questions  on 
self-harm  and  suicidal  ideation  these  findings  may  have  been  signifi-
cantly higher. 

Education,  economic  concerns  and  ethnicity  were,  to  varying  de-
grees, noted as risk factors for poor perinatal mental health [26,28,36, 
40,46,51,53]. In each instance sample sizes were limited. The findings 
are of interest however in terms of prompting research questions. For 
example, what could explain the finding that women who have achieved 
a  third  level  education  display  more  state  anxiety  than  those  with  a 
lower level of education [51,53]? Could this be linked to internal versus 
external locus of control, or experience in responding to multiple life 
changes simultaneously, or self-care activities? In terms of employment, 
notwithstanding the fact that there was ambiguity in the original article 
regarding  meaning  of  ‘physical  contact’  [53],  this  single  study  noted 
that participants whose jobs necessitated physical contact (e.g., trader, 
farmer)  were  at  a  higher  risk  for  depression.  This  suggests  that 
unpacking the demands of a perinatal woman’s occupation may be an 
entry point to responding to individualised support needs. How are we 
to  understand  differences  highlighted  by  Gur  et  al.  [46]  in  the  way 
resilience  was  experienced  among  black  and  white  women?  The  link 
between self-reliance and risk of depression was moderated by race with 
greater self-reliance predicting lower levels of depression for white, but 
not for black, women. Could these findings indicate a need to investigate 
whether  ethnicity  is  really  a  marker  of  cultural  dislocation,  lower 
socio-economic status or other complex factors? Taken together these 
findings highlight the need for a deeper delve into how perinatal women 
from minority groups were affected by lockdown. 

During the perinatal period support is crucial. As noted by Dempsey 
and Peeren [63] and Dunkel Schetter [64], qualitatively different sup-
port is needed from various people. Participants experienced a consid-
erable  decrease  in  the  availability  of  formal  antenatal  care  during 
lockdown  [52]  and  their  satisfaction  with  healthcare  provision  was 
negatively  impacted  [45].  Being  unable  to  draw  on  formal  support 
resulted in participants worrying about lack of regular antenatal visits 
[46,51] and about their birth experience [46]. Through the care they 
provide, midwives and health professionals are well placed to impact the 
way  perinatal  women  think  and  feel  about  their  pregnancy  [63,65]. 
Harnessing  this  professional  support,  through  development  of  audio 
guided  bibliotherapy,  could  provide  a  bridge  to  formal  support  for 
perinatal  women  in  instances  where  in-person  access  to  services  is 
reduced  or  not  feasible  and  continuity  between  support  sessions. 
Further, the findings that women who received support for their own 
health, who contacted infant support groups, and whose partners shared 
household chores more equally with them, experienced improved peri-
natal  mental  health  and  maternal  coping  [44],  point  to  potential  in-
terventions that may fit within the  midwifery services. Specifically, a 

psychoeducational intervention to support women in prioritising their 
individual needs (e.g., mental health, social contact, parenting, infant 
socialisation, managing domestic tasks), could be a relatively low-cost 
support  in  promoting  positive  perinatal  mental  health.  Alternatively, 
offering perinatal parent-infant art classes based on Bruce and Hackett’s 
in  promoting  perinatal  mothers’  mood, 
[66]  work  may  aid 
self-knowledge, understanding of problems and relational engagement 
with their babies. 

Jonsdottir  et  al.  [3]  found  that  changes  in  the  perinatal  woman’s 
informal  support  systems  e.g.  partner,  family  and  friends,  were  often 
experienced. Four studies considered relationship status in terms of so-
cial  support  and  perinatal  mental  health  outcomes.  Negative  changes 
within  the  perinatal  woman’s  relationship  with  her  partner  were  re-
ported but were not a direct risk factor for poor perinatal mental health 
[45]. This is of particular interest given that COVID-19 lockdowns were 
linked  with  increased  incidences  of  domestic  violence  [67].  Just  one 
article in the current review [47] commented on domestic violence rates 
during lockdown. As women in the perinatal period are susceptible to 
experiencing domestic violence [67,68], and may find it challenging to 
seek  help,  routine  screening  by  their  midwifery  team  could  scaffold 
timely intervention and referral for this vulnerable population [68]. 

Higher  levels  of  perceived  social  support  from  friends  moderated 
negative effects of RNT on symptoms of depression and anxiety, though 
support from family or partners did not act as a buffer [48]. Participants 
noted that support from their partners was important so why only sup-
port from friends served as a buffer is not entirely clear. Harrison et al. 
[48] postulate that even the most supportive partner cannot fully un-
derstand  the  maternal  experience  [69].  Another  possible  explanation 
draws  on  Clark  and  Wells’  [70]  and  Clarks’  [71]  cognitive  model  of 
social anxiety whereby people who are socially anxious tend to have a 
more negative perception of other people’s response to them. Could it be 
that participants who perceived lower levels of social support were not 
as fluent as other people in recognising positive responses? Regardless of 
the reason, there is scope for intervention. One approach may be talk 
therapy to empower perinatal mothers in identifying what constitutes 
personal social support for them e.g., being invited to events as normal, 
adapting activity with friends, being included through online contact. In 
this way, brief talk therapy can be drawn on to promote social support. 
In general, people tend to have an implicit understanding of what is 
stressful. It makes intuitive sense that enforced lockdown will, for many, 
have  created  more  challenges  and  difficulties.  Of  course,  within  this 
there will also be some people who found that lockdown may not have 
impacted them as negatively as they had predicted, or as other people 
experienced. Personal resilience can act as a buffer against some of the 
negative perinatal mental health outcomes associated with lockdown, 
such as depression. As resilience seems to be influenced by the active 
practice of coping and relaxation strategies, developing a preventative 
psychoeducational intervention for perinatal women to promote resil-
ience would seem timely. A potential approach could incorporate the 
‘Wellness  Recovery  Action  Plan’  (WRAP)  [72].  This 
peer-led 
self-management  tool,  built  on  the  principles  of  hope,  personal  re-
sponsibility, education, self-advocacy and support,  comprises an indi-
vidualised plan or toolbox of resources and activities identified by the 
person for themselves. It can be updated regularly in response to needs 
regarding  gaining,  or  maintaining,  control  over  mental  wellbeing. 
Developing  a  practical  approach  is  important  for  wellbeing  generally 
and  enhancing  quality  of  life.  This  is  expressly  so  when  routine  and 
normal process is jeopardised. 

5. Limitations and strengths 

Publication bias may exist as only peer-reviewed articles published 
in English were included in the review. Additionally, the heterogeneity 
of studies meant that it was not possible to carry out a meta-analysis. The 
range of assessment tools used in the studies and national variation in 
implementation of COVID-19 rules limited comparability of results. In 

WomenandBirth36(2023)47–5553S. Wall and M. Dempsey                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

terms of the quality of included articles, due to the cross-sectional nature 
of  the  studies  it is  possible  that weaker  evidence is  provided  in com-
parison with regular cohort studies regarding possible causal relation-
ships between lockdown and perinatal mental health. An example are 
the findings relating to the role of previous mental health diagnoses on 
perinatal  mental  health  outcomes  during  lockdown.  While  the  STAI 
measures trait anxiety, in the absence of data pertaining to anxiety levels 
of  the  same  participants  prior  to  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  it  is  not 
possible to comment on the extent that previous mental health diagnoses 
impacted current mental health outcomes. Similarly, variability on what 
constitutes a previous mental health diagnosis limits compatibility be-
tween studies e.g., one study refers to a diagnosis given by a psychiatrist 
following clinical interview [40], while other studies ask participants to 
self-report previous diagnoses [45,55]. While 11 studies did not provide 
a sample size justification, this may be explained by the fact observa-
tional studies are exploratory in nature and so the focus may not have 
been on whether the study had a sufficient number of participants to 
answer the authors research question. 

Initiating  this  study  by  completing  a  scoping  review  undoubtedly 
helped to focus the systematic review, ensuring a comprehensive search 
of the literature could be carried out. Conducting the systematic review 
in line with the updated PRISMA guidelines [38] ensures that the study 
was transparent and complete reporting enhanced the trustworthiness of 
the findings. 

6. Implications 

The  current  study  has  implications  for  clinicians,  researchers  and 
policymakers. The findings of this study are notable in identifying risk 
and protective factors which may have contributed to optimum man-
agement  of  perinatal  mental  health,  during  and  after  the  COVID-19 
lockdown  periods.  Awareness  of  risk  factors  could  support  increased 
screening for earlier identification of poor perinatal mental health by 
healthcare  practitioners.  With  integration  of  online  appointments, 
health care workers’ cognisance that not all service users are computer 
literate is important. As such, information booklets and bibliotherapy 
will aid individuals in understanding what supports are available and 
actions needed to access them. While this review focused specifically on 
how COVID-19 lockdown restrictions impacted perinatal mental health, 
there are transferable learnings in terms of people who, regardless of the 
pandemic, have limited access to services and supports. Findings, and 
noted interventions, can be drawn on to protect against risk factors in 
this area and promote positive perinatal mental health. 

7. Conclusion 

COVID-19 lockdowns amplified the stressors that impact perinatal 
women’s mental health. When normal routine is disrupted, formal in-
terventions  that  draw  on  perinatal  women’s  intra  and  interpersonal 
resources to support changes in their domestic space and facilitate them 
in  developing  mental  health  wellbeing  tool  kits,  may  help  insulate 
against  the  impact  of  mental  health  challenges  for  both  mother  and 
child.
