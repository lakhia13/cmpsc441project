Abstract

Post-stroke dementia (PSD) or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) may affect up to one third of stroke survivors.
Various definitions of PSCI and PSD have been described. We propose PSD as a label for any dementia following stroke
in temporal relation. Various tools are available to screen and assess cognition, with few PSD-specific instruments.
Choice will depend on purpose of assessment, with differing instruments needed for brief screening (e.g., Montreal
Cognitive Assessment) or diagnostic formulation (e.g., NINDS VCI battery). A comprehensive evaluation should include
assessment of pre-stroke cognition (e.g., using Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly), mood
(e.g., using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and functional consequences of cognitive impairments (e.g., using
modified Rankin Scale). A large number of biomarkers for PSD, including indicators for genetic polymorphisms,
biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the serum, inflammatory mediators, and peripheral microRNA profiles
have been proposed. Currently, no specific biomarkers have been proven to robustly discriminate vulnerable patients
(‘at risk brains’) from those with better prognosis or to discriminate Alzheimer’s disease dementia from PSD. Further,
neuroimaging is an important diagnostic tool in PSD. The role of computerized tomography is limited to
demonstrating type and location of the underlying primary lesion and indicating atrophy and severe white matter
changes. Magnetic resonance imaging is the key neuroimaging modality and has high sensitivity and specificity for
detecting pathological changes, including small vessel disease. Advanced multi-modal imaging includes diffusion
tensor imaging for fiber tracking, by which changes in networks can be detected. Quantitative imaging of cerebral
blood flow and metabolism by positron emission tomography can differentiate between vascular dementia and
degenerative dementia and show the interaction between vascular and metabolic changes. Additionally, inflammatory
changes after ischemia in the brain can be detected, which may play a role together with amyloid deposition in the
development of PSD. Prevention of PSD can be achieved by prevention of stroke. As treatment strategies to inhibit
the development and mitigate the course of PSD, lowering of blood pressure, statins, neuroprotective drugs, and
anti-inflammatory agents have all been studied without convincing evidence of efficacy. Lifestyle interventions, physical
activity, and cognitive training have been recently tested, but large controlled trials are still missing.

Background
Stroke is a leading cause of disability [1]. Research and
interventions have historically focused on physical dis-
abilities [2], while cognitive impairment – an important
aspect for stroke survivors – has been rather neglected
[3, 4]. Even minor stroke affects daily functioning, ex-
ecutive functions, and cognition, consequently affecting
life, and return to work [5].
participation, quality of
Stroke survivors are at increased risk of developing cog-
nitive impairment. Obviously, the acute tissue damage
may affect cognition. Nevertheless, despite prospective
data being available, results are conflicting and the direct
cognitive effect of a stroke event beyond the cognitive
decline associated with age and vascular risk factors re-
mains poorly understood. Physical impairments tend to
improve, to a greater or lesser degree, following stroke;
however, for reasons which remain unknown, cognitive
impairments progressively worsen.

This review paper is based on the proceedings of the
International Congress on Vascular Dementia, Ljubljana,
2015, at which reviews of the literature on post-stroke
cognitive impairment (PSCI) and post-stroke dementia
(PSD) were presented by leaders of the field and dis-
cussed by a broad audience. Key thematic areas were
chosen for further elucidation in smaller working groups
and, after
review was
further discussions, a final
compiled.

Methods of research
Using a focused search of PubMed/Medline from January
1995 until August 2016, the relevant literature on PSCI/
PSD was critically reviewed. The following keywords were
employed in te search: “cognitive impairment”, “dementia”,
“definitions and classification”, “diagnosis”, “neuroimaging”,
“interventions”,
“biomarkers”, and “stroke”. References
from the selected papers published in the English language
were evaluated and included if they were found to be rele-
vant to the focus of this systematic review. Experts were
divided in four groups. The first group of experts con-
ducted research about basic concepts, definitions, and epi-
demiology of PSD following stroke as well as on tools for
assessment of cognitive impairment. The second group
evaluated biomarkers for PSD, whereas as neuroimaging
studies and interventions for PSD prevention and treat-
ment were critically reviewed by the third and fourth
groups, respectively.

Definitions
A variety of classifications, diagnostic criteria, and de-
scriptive syndromes are used to define PSCI [6], but a
widely accepted and harmonized terminology is still
missing [7]. Post-stroke neuropsychological syndromes
overlap – PSCI is responsible for a substantial number
of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) syndromes; PSCI

includes the subgroups of PSD and PSCI not fulfilling
criteria for dementia.

The direct application of established diagnostic criteria
for dementia may not be suited to stroke populations.
For example, the differentiation of dementia from PSD
and PSCI not fulfilling criteria for dementia is usually
based on limitations in activities of daily living. In stroke
survivors with substantial physical impairments it may
be difficult to assess changes in activities of daily living
related to specifically cognitive problems [8]. Usual defi-
nitions of dementia emphasize the presence of multido-
main cognitive impairments, and in particular memory
deficits. However, in stroke, it may be possible to have
disabling cognitive problems but retain memory [9].

One of the main questions in the relationship between
stroke and dementia occurring after the cerebrovascular
event is whether the stroke causes the cognitive deterior-
ation, contributes to it, or just alerted the physicians to
the problem. The question remains to be answered, but
undoubtedly about one-third of stroke survivors are
found to have a significant degree of cognitive impair-
ment within the first months after the event [10].

We propose the term PSD for any dementia which
develops
following a clinical cerebrovascular event.
Although we use the descriptor “post-stroke”, emerging
evidence suggests that transient ischemic attack may
also be associated with adverse cognitive prognosis [11].
Using the term PSD in this way does not suggest a par-
ticular underlying neuropathological process. This seems
appropriate as dementia following stroke often com-
prises a mix of “vascular” insults and neurodegenerative
processes [12]. Stroke occurs predominantly in older
adults and therefore stroke patients may have pre-stroke
cognitive decline of varying severity [13]. Recognizing
the pre-stroke cognitive state is essential to allow appro-
priate classification, e.g., a patient with pre-existing cog-
nitive impairment (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who then
has a minor stroke should not be labeled as PSD.

The time assessment of cognitive impairment is an-
other relevant diagnostic factor. Acute deficiencies in
cognitive test scores are often observed following a
stroke and retesting after several weeks often reveals im-
provements [14, 15]. Therefore, the final diagnosis of
PSD should be delayed to at least 6 months after the
event. We recognize that certain strategic infarcts (for
example, in dominant medial temporal lobe) are associ-
ated with immediate cognitive syndromes; however, we
would still reserve the dementia diagnosis until at least
6 months. This delay in applying a dementia diagnostic
in keeping with International classification
label
systems such as the American Psychiatric Association
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.

Cognition Classification Consensus Study (VICCCS;
http://www.vicccs.info/) considered PSD as a major sub-
type of VCI and felt that this label should be used where
there is a clear temporal relationship between stroke and
cognitive decline. A national Korean study of VCI epi-
demiology defined PSD as any major cognitive impair-
ment seen at more than 3 months after a stroke event,
regardless of pre-stroke cognitive status [16].

The terms PSD and vascular dementia (VaD) are not
synonymous. The often used term, VaD, has evolved
during the last century. Today, VaD represents a concept
which includes not only multiple cortical and/or subcor-
infarcts, but also strategic single infarcts, non-
tical
infarction white matter
and
hypoperfusion as possible causes of dementia. VaD can
be considered a subgroup of VCI, representing fully de-
veloped dementia after a clearly identified vascular event
(the overlap of these definitions is illustrated in Fig. 1).

Assessments
International guidelines recommend cognitive and mood
assessment for all stroke survivors and it is increasingly
recognized that cognitive assessment should be part of
the “routine” neurological examination in research and
clinical practice [17, 18]. Several cognitive assessment
tools are available and there is no accepted consensus on
preferred approach [19, 20]. Stroke-specific cognitive as-
sessment tools are available [21], but most centers still
use tools developed for non-stroke populations. A sys-
tematic review of test properties in stroke did not show
clear superiority with respect to global accuracy [22].
The most suitable assessment will vary with the purpose
of testing; for example, if a rater wishes to ensure all
potential cases of PSD are identified then a highly

cognitive impairment

sensitive scale such as the Montreal Cognitive Assess-
ment (MoCA) would be preferable. The cut point used
to define PSD can also be adjusted; for example, many
centers recommend a lower threshold for MoCA when
used in stroke settings. Choice of assessment should also
be guided by other factors such as availability, familiar-
ity, and feasibility (Table 1). Feasibility is of particular
concern in acute stroke, where severity of disease may
preclude lengthy neuropsychological testing [23].

Informant-based structured questionnaires can capture
the patient’s cognitive state before the stroke. The
Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the
Elderly (IQCODE) is the most commonly employed as-
sessment [24]; it has reasonable accuracy in determining
dementia, it is available in several languages, and can be
completed in minutes using the short form version [25].
IQCODE has been used for assessment of pre-stroke
and post-stroke cognition and to aid prognosis; indeed, the
properties of IQCODE vary according to the purpose of
testing. Testing of cognition should be complemented by
functional assessment. The modified Rankin Scale and
Barthel Index are the most commonly used functional as-
sessment tools [26]. Post-stroke cognitive issues will often
coexist with other neuropsychological problems and should
be assessed by validated tools as, for example, language dis-
orders (Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test), mood disorder
(Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale),
fatigue (Fatigue
Severity Scale), delirium (Confusion Assessment Method),
and apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale).

Common stroke-related impairments can complicate as-
sessment if, for example, the patient is unable to complete
a pencil and paper task if the dominant hand is weak [27].
Cognitive assessment in the presence of aphasia is particu-
larly problematic. Tools designed for use in aphasia are
available such as the Cognitive Assessment Scale for
Stroke Patients, which can be administered without using
language, and the Oxford Cognitive Screen [27].

Epidemiology
Stroke is recognized as one of the major causes of adult
disability globally. VaD including PSD is the second
most common cause of cognitive decline, with only
Alzheimer disease (AD) being more prevalent [28]. The
lifetime risk of developing either stroke or dementia at
age of 65 is one in three in men and one in two in
women [29]. With changing population demographics, in-
creased life expectancy and improved survival from stroke,
the absolute numbers of patients with PSD will increase.
However, due to its relation with stroke incidence, PSD
might be reduced with improved stroke prevention.

A pooled analysis of

graphic parameters, factors related to pre-stroke func-
tional status and to the index stroke (s), and factors

relating to post-stroke complications and brain imaging
factors (Table 2) [30, 31].

Silent brain infarctions (SBI) are common findings in
elderly patients, but their relationship to dementia re-
mains uncertain. Bornstein et al. [32] studied admission
CT scans of 175 consecutive patients without dementia,
presenting with a first stroke incident. SBI were defined
as CT evidence of stroke not compatible with the acute
event. Stroke survivors were followed for their mental
state for 5 years and the authors found that SBI did not
predict the development of PSD.

According to study of Grau-Olivares and Arboix [33],
ischemic cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD) should be
regarded as a severe condition prodrome of subcortical
VaD, rather than a relatively benign disorder, as consid-
ered earlier, especially since SVD can be seen on MRI
studies (white matter lesions, lacunes, and microbleeds).
Recent studies showed that the proportion of dementia
caused by SVD ranges from 36 to 67% [9, 28, 31, 33].
Further, patients with a first-ever lacunar stroke present

with cognitive impairment in more than half of cases
and more than 55% of patients fulfill mild cognitive
impairment criteria [33]. Additionally, the presence of
silent multiple lacunar infarctions in patients with first-
ever lacunar stroke is an independent predictor of poor
performance on executive functions and short delayed
verbal memory tests. Thus, in the initial stages of SVD,
mild neuropsychological abnormalities appear to be
related to lacunes rather than to perivascular hyperin-
tensities of vascular cause or leukoaraiosis [34].

A number of important prospective cohort studies have
documented cognitive change following stroke [35, 36].
Meta-analysis of these studies suggests that some form of
cognitive impairment affects up to one third of stroke sur-
vivors; this figure does not differentiate stroke etiology
and may include a proportion (estimated at around 10%)
with pre-stroke dementia. Prevalence of PSCI is higher in
those with recurrent stroke events [31]. These data might
underestimate the true prevalence of post-stroke cognitive
change as patients included in studies tend to exclude
those with larger strokes who are unable to consent or
attend follow-up visits [37]. There are also issues with
feasibility of cognitive testing and attrition to follow-up
that will contribute to under-estimation of the true burden
of cognitive impairment [38].

PSD is often recognized in the first weeks to months
post ictus and, thereafter, prevalence of PSD increases
with time. Compared to controls with no stroke, inci-
dent stroke is associated with acute change in cognition
and change in rate of temporal cognitive decline [39].
Pooled analyses of longitudinal cohorts suggest a linear
increase of 3 and 1.7% per year in hospital- and
population-based studies, respectively [31]. In contrast
to cognitive changes in the normal aging population, a
linear rate of change is not observed, but stroke survi-
vors seem to show different cognitive “trajectories” and
these trajectories may change over time (Fig. 2).

Biomarkers and predictors of PSD
Biomarkers for PSD may include neuroimaging measures
and metabolic, genetic, and inflammatory mediators [40].

fixed cognitive decline causing a dementia that can be detected using
a cognitive screening tool. b The “real world”, where there are various
degrees of pre-stroke cognitive decline and various post-stroke various
cognitive trajectories. This complexity requires differing approaches to
assessment at various time-points

Both neurodegenerative and vascular mechanisms are ac-
tivated and probably result
in overlapping processes,
therefore sharing some pathological features and likely
having some common biomarkers.

Genetic markers
Genes underlying PSD and VCI may include those
shared by VaD and AD, namely genes involved in the
pathways of amyloid production or elimination (apolipo-
protein E and possibly presenilin and APP) may confer
susceptibility to develop dementia after vascular brain
injury, thus explaining, at least in part, the well-known
interaction and synergism between VaD and AD.
Polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes reported as conferring
susceptibility to develop PSD and VaD include the e4
allele of apolipoprotein E, a well-known risk factor for
AD, although its association with VaD and PSD has been
controversial [41–47]. Another reported SNP is in the
gene encoding the angiotensin-converting enzyme, one
of the enzymes in the renin-angiotensin system. Studies
investigating the angiotensin-converting enzyme SNP as
a predictor for post-stroke cognitive decline have yielded

controversial data [48–52]. A genome-wide association
study in the Rotterdam cohort revealed a genetic locus
associated with VaD, located on the X chromosome close
to the androgen receptor gene [53]. An additional SNP
is endothelial nitric oxide synthase, reported as associ-
ated with incident dementia in elderly stroke survivors
[54]. The main research areas currently being investi-
gated are genetic predisposition, predominantly in genes
linked to both AD and vascular disease and inflamma-
tory response.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers
So far, the search for a precise and reliable biochemical in-
dicator which would help establish the diagnosis of VaD
and PSD has not been productive. Although, the Aβ-42
peptide and tau protein CSF levels are sensitive markers of
AD, they showed the lowest specificity in VaD [55]. Prom-
ising results were obtained measuring the levels of matrix-
degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) in CSF, such as
gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) [56, 57].
Gelatinases interfere with molecules of the basal lamina,
leading to proteolytic disruption of the blood brain barrier
(BBB). Further, they are involved in myelin breakdown.
Brain ischemia induces a gelatinase A and B elevation at
different time points after the stroke. Recent studies
showed that the MMP-9 CSF level is significantly higher
in VaD patients compared to AD patients as well as
elderly healthy subjects, and may help in distinguishing
AD from VaD [56]. Other CSF markers also reported as
associated with VaD, and indirectly PSD, are levels of α-1
antitrypsin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and apoli-
poprotein H [58].

Serum biomarkers
Serum biomarkers, such as β secretase enzyme and re-
ceptor levels for advanced glycation end products, have
been suggested to correlate with early PSCI [45]. Homo-
cysteine, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels were linked to
PSCI; however, supplementation with B vitamins had no
effect on the incidence of cognitive impairment or de-
cline [59].

Inflammatory mediators
Inflammation in stroke seems to have both detrimental
and beneficial effects. Activation of resident cells (micro-
glia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells) appears to be neu-
roprotective and promotes brain regeneration/recovery,
whereas recruitment of immune cells with a subsequent
increase in the expression of inflammatory mediators,
such as reactive oxygen species, cytokines, and chemo-
kines, together with BBB disruption, could lead to edema
and neuronal death [60]. Chronic activation of innate
immune responses can trigger neurotoxic pathways
leading to progressive degeneration. Damaged neurons

also exacerbate
disease by release of chemokines and activation of
microglia [61]. Several recent longitudinal studies have
relationship between inflammatory
investigated the
markers and PSD, but an association is not yet estab-
lished. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive
protein, interleukin 6, and interleukin 12 were suggested
as predictors of PSCI [62, 63]. Recently, Kliper et al. [64]
showed strong relationship between ESR and cognitive
performance among stroke survivors, where higher ESR
levels were associated with worse performance in cogni-
tive tests, particularly memory scores. Findings from the
TABASCO study have raised the possibility that many
individuals with cerebrovascular ischemic events harbor
a long and persistent pro-inflammatory background [64].
Whether lowering inflammation can also prevent PSD
needs to be addressed in prospective clinical trials.

Peripheral microRNA (miRNA) profiles as novel
biomarkers
miRNAs are a type of small non-coding RNA molecules
that act as endogenous regulators of gene expression by
binding to complementary sequences of target messen-
ger RNA. The dysregulation of miRNAs is thought to be
involved in many diseases, and changes in the miRNA
expression profile have been observed in cerebral ische-
mia and AD. Studies have demonstrated that serum
miRNAs miR-93, miR-146a, and miR-31 were significantly
up regulated in VaD compared to the controls; thus, they
could serve as specific biomarkers to discriminate AD
from VaD [65]. Endogenous circulating miRNAs have
been found to be stable and consistently detected in
serum, plasma and other body fluids because of their
packaging and secretion into the blood within exosomes.
Currently,
information regarding miRNAs in VaD and
PSD studies is limited, but the potential diagnostic value
of miRNAs is very promising. In conclusion, no molecular
biomarkers have been confirmed as being specifically as-
sociated with PSD.

Neuroimaging
Neuroimaging in PSD provides significant information
about the anatomical substrate of the disorder and has
an important role in PSD diagnosis. Further, it adds to
prediction of cognitive decline after stroke; for example,
hippocampal atrophy is a strong predictor for PSD out-
come [12, 66]. Most acute stroke patients undergo CT
brain imaging and, therefore, CT studies are representa-
tive of the whole clinical population. In everyday prac-
tice, CT is performed mainly to exclude intracerebral
hemorrhage and certain stroke mimics
(e.g., brain
tumors), and can often show early signs of ischemia, as
well as old stroke lesions. Additionally, the presence and
extension of cerebral atrophy and white matter lesions

can easily be seen on brain CT scans. Such neuroimag-
ing characteristics may help predict subsequent cognitive
impairment [67, 68].

MRI represents the most significant neuroimaging
modality in PSD. If not contraindicated, MRI, rather
than CT, is preferred for daily, routine clinical use as
well as in research studies since it has higher specificity
and sensitivity for detecting pathological substrates [66].
Neuroimaging standards with a generally accepted
terminology allowing comparison of findings between
different centers have been suggested (STandards for
ReportIng Vascular changes on nEuroimaging, STRIVE)
[69]. A large number of studies recognized MRI signs of
cerebral SVD (lacunes, white matter hyperintensities,
microbleeds, silent infarcts, white matter changes), as
well as global cerebral atrophy and medial-temporal lobe
atrophy as determinants and predictors of PSD. Vascular
lesions associated with PSD are mainly found in subcor-
tical brain areas, especially including sub-frontal and
orbitofrontal white matter circuits. These lesions include
single infarction in strategic areas such as the dominant
thalamus or angular gyrus, deep areas of frontal lobe,
and the left hemisphere, as well as brain infarcts in both
hemispheres and volume-driven infarctions reaching a
critical threshold of brain tissue loss or injury [70].
Additionally to size and location of the vascular lesion,
the involvement of
tracts,
assessed by diffusion tensor imaging, may be crucial for
cognitive impairment after stroke; its role is still being
studied [71]. Although brain atrophy is a frequent find-
ing in cerebral SVD, the pathophysiological mechanisms
are not fully elucidated. In a recent study, Duering et al.
[72] showed that cortical neurodegeneration following
ischemia in the subcortical region probably represents
pathophysiological mechanisms for cerebral atrophy in
cerebrovascular disease; they showed that subcortical in-
farcts trigger focal thinning in connected cortical areas.
Additionally, patients with mild VCI showed clear pro-
gressive gray matter atrophy in cortical (temporal and
frontal) and subcortical (pons, caudate and cerebellum)
regions after first-ever lacunar stroke, in contrast to pa-
tients without initial cognitive impairment [73].

functional network fiber

Mild to moderate stroke patients with pre-existing
white matter lesions are more vulnerable to cognitive
impairment regardless of
their new ischemic lesions
[74]. Results from the SMART-MR study suggested that
the interaction between brain atrophy and white matter
hyperintensities or infarcts could aggravate cognitive de-
cline [75]. There is evidence of the role of hippocampal
mean diffusivity in the post-stroke cognitive state, above
and beyond that of volume and connectivity of this
structure [76].

for several years in the differentiation between demen-
tias [77]. However, functional and molecular imaging
has a special role for research on the pathophysiology
and the factors involved in development of PSD. Stroke
and the deposition of amyloid in the cerebral cortex are
both known risks for developing dementia [78, 79].
While animal models suggest that stroke-induced in-
flammation and amyloid deposition act synergetically
[79], this relationship remains to be established in hu-
man stroke. Experimentally, large vessel infarcts or small
striatal infarcts are larger in the presence of extracellular
amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits, which are fundamental
markers of AD. Patients with minor cerebral strokes and
moderate AD lesions will develop the clinical manifesta-
tions of dementia. A reasonable question is whether the
stroke was just a signal and not necessarily a player in
the pathogenesis of cognitive deterioration. Additionaly,
small striatal infarcts in the presence of high levels of
amyloid in the brain exhibit a progression in infarct size
over time with an enhanced degree of cognitive impair-
ment, AD-type pathology, and neuroinflammation com-
pared with striatal infarcts or high amyloid levels alone.
Recently, it has been stated that stroke is a specific vas-
cular risk factor for cognitive impairment [80]. There is
an overlap between VCI risk factors (hypertension, dia-
betes, and atherosclerosis) and those for stroke, as well
as AD risk factors. Stroke may alter the clinical expres-
sion of a given load of AD pathology, but more studies
are needed for definitive clarification of the relationships
between stroke, AD, and cognitive detoriation.

Interventions
The best way to prevent PSD is to prevent stroke recur-
rence and stroke severity through optimal acute treat-
ment and intensive secondary prevention. Intravenous
and intra-arterial interventions (if indicated), treatment
in the stroke unit including prevention of complications,
and early rehabilitation are thought to limit the damage
from the stroke lesion and improve outcome [81]. Sec-
ondary prevention includes medical
interventions and
lifestyle modification. To date, there is limited evidence
for specific therapeutic strategies for preventing cogni-
tive decline after stroke. However, aggressive treatment
of vascular risk factors may potentially prevent PSD
through prevention of the total vascular burden, includ-
ing progression of vascular disease and vascular risk as-
sociated with dementia. An observational study showed
reduced cognitive impairment in patients with appropri-
ate vascular risk management post-stroke [82];
this
included antiplatelet therapy, antihypertensive drugs and
statins, or anticoagulants, if indicated. In addition, cogni-
tive function can benefit from treatment of neuropsychi-
atric symptoms like depression, apathy, and anxiety, as
well as cognitive training/stimulation [83].

In a pilot study, the relationship between amyloid de-
position, microglia activation, and cognitive performance

inflammation or amyloid deposition.

Pharmacological interventions for prevention of
PSD
Blood pressure lowering
A review by Zanchetti et al. [86] of randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) not limited to stroke patients suggests that
blood pressure lowering may have some beneficial effects
on cognitive decline. Hypertension treatment after stroke
preserves cognition through prevention of
recurrent
stroke, but it is not yet clear whether it prevents cognitive
decline through other mechanisms. Thus far, only four
published RCTs restricted to patients with a previous
stroke tested the effect of antihypertensive drugs on cogni-
tion as secondary outcome. The Perindopril Protection
Against Recurrent Stroke study showed that long-term
blood pressure lowering after stroke with perindopril was
associated with reduced cognitive decline [87]. This effect
was more pronounced in patients with recurrent stroke,
suggesting a beneficial effect due to secondary stroke pre-
vention. In contrast, telmisartan did not change cognition
in the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second
Strokes (PRoFESS) study [88]. Further, results of the
Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3)
trial showed no differences in cognitive function amongst
groups according to blood pressure control or antiplatelet
drug used [89]. One study, with cognition as the primary
outcome, did not find any association between cognitive
test performance and different blood pressure goals [90].
Similarly, candesartan did not improve cognitive function
at 6 months when compared to placebo in the Scandi-
navian Candesartan Acute Stroke Trial (SCAST) [91].

Statin treatment
Statin therapy in secondary stroke prevention has shown
an effect on new vascular events but only marginally re-
duces the risk of stroke recurrence [92]. Statins lower
LDL cholesterol and may have a beneficial effect on
platelet function, endothelial activity, and inflammation
[93]. No study has tested the effect of statins on cogni-
tion in patients with previous stroke. However, two large
studies (HPS and PROSPER), which included patients

fected cognition [94, 95].

functions as outcome measures, particularly the executive
domains.

Other potential pharmacological interventions
Many therapeutic strategies have been developed for
neuroprotection in acute stoke. Nitric oxide donors are
thought to reduce infarct size and improve cerebral
blood flow, but did not improve cognitive function post-
stroke [96]. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and meman-
tine may have a beneficial effect on cognition in patients
with mild to moderate vascular dementia in general [97],
but evidence for both general improvement are limited.
Cerebrolysin had a beneficial effect on global outcome,
but did not assess cognition, especially in stroke patients
[98]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be as-
sociated with overall recovery after stroke even in the
absence of depression [99]. Fluoxetine is proposed to
improve stroke recovery, and there is an ongoing trial that
includes cognition as an outcome [100]. The dietary nu-
cleotide citicoline may also improve recovery [101]. There
are ongoing studies to explore the potential positive effect
of phosphodiesterase-3, anti-inflammatory agents, BBB
modulators, endothelin antagonist, flavonoids,
immuno-
suppressive agents, peroxisome proliferator-activated re-
ceptor gamma antagonists, prostacylin, sympathomimetics,
xanthine oxidase inhibitors, antidepressants, neurotrophic
agents, gingko biloba extract Egb-761, and others [12, 102].

Lifestyle interventions
Multifactorial interventions
Most vascular risk factors are modifiable. Modifications of
lifestyle factors include physical exercise, healthy diet,
moderate alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation.
Multimodal lifestyle interventions have been successful in
changing the lifestyle habits of stroke survivors [103, 104].
Two randomized trials have been performed with multi-
factorial
interventions including optimal medical treat-
ment for secondary prevention in addition to physical
activity, diet, weight control, smoking cessation, healthy
diet with better glycemic control, and cognitive stimula-
tion. One tested the effect of the multimodal risk factor
intervention over 1 year on cognition, but no change in
cognitive outcome was found [105]. However, significant
beneficial effects were found on depression as the se-
condary outcome [106]. The recently published RCT by
Matz et al. [107] showed that stroke patients receiving
multiple, intensive life-style interventions did not differ in
cognitive outcomes after 2 years compared to patients
who received standard care; a small non-significant reduc-
tion in dysexecutive syndromes appearing in the interven-
tion group was noted, but not significant. This finding
indicates that studies for lifestyle interventions have to be
performed in larger populations with neuropsychological

Physical interventions
A systematic review including nine studies, published in
2012, showed that increased physical activity after stroke
improves cognitive performance [108]. Exercise training
is standard for cardiovascular disease management, and
cardiac rehabilitation was shown to improve cognitive
performance in several studies [109]. Sharing the same
risk factors as stroke, brain rehabilitation including
exercise might be a right strategy in future stroke care,
supported by papers published over the past 2 years. A
6-month training model combining aerobic and resist-
ance training, initiated at least 10 weeks post-stroke, re-
sulted in improved cognitive function and reduction of
patients meeting the threshold criteria for mild cognitive
impairment [110]. A recently published paper by Moore
et al. [111] showed that exercise therapy three times per
week for 19 weeks improved cognitive function,
in-
creased regional blood flow in the medial temporal lobe,
and prevented structural loss in the same region. An on-
going RCT, Move IT, aims to investigate whether a phys-
ical exercise program can prevent cognitive decline in
the acute phase after transient ischemic attack or minor
ischemic stroke [112].

Cognitive training
Cognitive rehabilitation is a complex therapeutic interven-
tion aiming to improve cognitive function after stroke; at
present, the approached strategies are individual remedi-
ation therapy with a neuropsychologist, group-based train-
ing, and computer cognitive training [113]. Cognitive
rehabilitation plays an integral role in stroke multidiscip-
linary rehabilitation and should be started shortly after
stroke onset, with effectiveness both in the post-acute
period and a few years after stroke [114]. However, there
are insufficient data to conclude on the long lasting bene-
fits in memory and executive function for post-stroke sur-
vivors [114, 115]. Moreover, data is missing regarding
whether the possible improvements in neuropsychological
tests are related to improvement in everyday functional
activities [116].

Non-invasive brain stimulation
Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, including re-
petitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial
direct current stimulation, have been reported to improve
functional status of stroke patients through modulation of
the excitability of cortical circuits [117, 118]. Nevertheless,
most previous studies included a small number of partici-
pants and evaluated only the short-term effect. Therefore,
there is limited evidence for recommendation of repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct

current stimulation in the treatment of PSCI. Future stud-
ies are needed to elucidate appropriate stimulation sites,
optimal parameters, and stimulation protocols to over-
come individual differences such as skull shape or genetic
polymorphisms [119].

Actovegin
Natural biological products, such as actovegin, may have
beneficial effects in the restorative phase of ischemia
[120]. Elmilnger et al. [121] found protective and anti-
oxidative effects of the hemodialysate actovegin on pri-
mary rat neurons in vitro. The efficacy of actovegin was
investigated by Mikhaĭlova et al. [122] in the treatment
of mild cognitive impairment post-stroke. The authors
found a positive therapeutic effect, including increased
speed of mental processes and reduced memory impair-
ment as well as a positive impact on asthenic and de-
pressive symptoms. In addition, the ARTEMIDA study
explored whether this treatment has a disease-modifying
effect on PSD [123]. Actovegin has been shown to have
effects on some cellular processes in the aging brain and
recent experimental studies revealed actovegin to play a
role in neuroprotective mechanisms [124].

Conclusions and further prospects
A variety of classifications, diagnostic criteria, and de-
scriptive syndromes are used to define post-stroke cog-
nitive problems, but a widely accepted and harmonized
terminology is still missing. We propose the term PSD
for any dementia following stroke that has a temporal
relationship with stroke.

The best way to prevent PSD is optimal treatment to
reduce stroke incidence and severity and, once stroke
occurs, intensive prevention of early complications and
long-term stroke recurrence. To date, there is limited
evidence for specific therapeutic strategies for preventing
cognitive decline after
stroke. However, aggressive
treatment of vascular risk factors, such as antiplatelet
therapy, antihypertensives and statins, or anticoagulant
therapy (if
indicated), may potentially prevent PSD
through inhibition of the total vascular burden, includ-
ing progression of vascular disease and vascular risk as-
sociated with dementia. In addition, cognitive function
can benefit from treatment of neuropsychiatric symp-
toms like depression, apathy, and anxiety, as well as cog-
nitive training/stimulation.

In the future, it is necessary to introduce a uniform def-
inition of cognitive impairment state following stroke,
which should be widely accepted, leading to more accur-
ate epidemiological results and a greater potential to com-
pare and pool data. For this to be possible, all inclusion
and exclusion criteria should be precisely defined, and in
particular the time assessment of cognitive impairment

following stroke. We propose that final diagnosis of PSD
should be delayed to at least 6 months after the event.

One of the main strategies for easier identification of
PSD is finding a precise biochemical marker. Since there
is still no reliable marker, the search continues, with an
enormous influence on future health economics and the
development of preventative treatments and strategies.
Therefore, multi-center studies on long-term cognitive
outcomes in stroke patients should be given high priority.
