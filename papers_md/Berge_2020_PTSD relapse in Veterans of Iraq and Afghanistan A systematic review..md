ABSTRACT
This systematic review examines studies published between 2003, the initial invasion of Iraq, and
2018 related to the long-term treatment outcomes for Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan suffering
from combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More specifically this review attempts
to estimate the rate at which Veterans experience the return of symptoms after completing
treatment. The review was conducted by the authors in accordance with the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The literature search identified eight eligible
studies, which met the predefined inclusion criteria. Of the included studies a majority were
deemed to be at a high risk of attrition bias. In addition, few studies comprehensively reported
relevant relapse or recurrence related outcome statistics. The implications of the available evi-
dence base on long-term treatment outcomes are discussed. Recommendations for future studies
on relapse and recurrence of PTSD symptoms among Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are also
presented.

What is the public significance of this article?—It is
vital that we understand what characterizes Veterans
and soldiers who are hindered by their combat experi-
ences, and how best to help them. Research has already
established that Veterans and soldiers seeking treat-
ment for combat trauma face a variety of challenges
that civilians do not. As a whole, Veterans are more
likely to drop out of treatment before their conditions
improve, and those who do complete treatment are less
likely to experience a significant improvement than
civilian patients. Of the relatively few military patients
who complete treatment and experience a significant
improvement,
little is known about how long this
improvement generally lasts.

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder is a disabling anxiety dis-
order, emerging after an acutely distressing event of
a threatening or catastrophic nature. The core symp-
toms of the disorder are persistent reexperiencing of
the trauma, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, nega-
tive alterations in cognitions and mood, and increased
arousal and reactivity. Military personnel, especially
those directly involved in combat operations, have
been found to be at an increased risk of developing

the disorder. A study from the American Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) examining over 100,000
Veterans indicated that PTSD was the most commonly
diagnosed military service-related mental health condi-
tion, accounting for more than half of all Veterans
diagnosed with a mental health condition (Seal,
Bertenthal, Miner, Sen, & Marmar, 2007). In recent
years a large number of military personnel have pre-
sented with combat related trauma as a result of opera-
tions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Veterans of these
conflicts have been exposed to operational stressors
that differ meaningfully from those of their predeces-
sors, as well as finding themselves in a markedly differ-
ent social context (IOM, 2008). These differences may
have implications for both how modern Veterans
experience their trauma and how they respond to treat-
ment. As a result, ensuring effective and efficient treat-
afflicted service members has become
ment of
a priority.

Estimates of the prevalence of PTSD among ser-
vice members vary between studies. An observational
study of over 18,000 US Army soldiers returning
from Iraq and Afghanistan described the
self-
reported prevalence of PTSD to be 15% (Thomas
et al., 2010). Similarly, a comprehensive study of
the prevalence of this disorder among over 13,000

Veterans deployed during OEF/OIF indicated an
overall rate of 15.8% (Dursa, Reinhard, Barth, &
Schneiderman, 2014). An extensive meta-analysis by
Hines, Sundin, et al., 2014 estimated a prevalence of
12% amongst combat units and 5% among non-
combat units. Although estimates vary, the research
literature indicates that Veterans in general, and
combat Veterans in particular, are at a much greater
risk of being diagnosed with PTSD than civilians
(Hines, Sundin, et al., 2014; Fulton et al., 2015).
Furthermore,
associated
with a number of negative consequences in addition
to the symptomatology of the disorder itself, such as
substance abuse, depression, interpersonal difficulties,
and suicidality (Debell et al., 2014; Ramchand,

2015;
Stander, Thomsen, & Highfill-McRoy, 2014).

Treating PTSD in Veterans and military personnel

Although research indicates that Veterans and military
personnel suffer from PTSD at a higher rate than the
civilian population, research also indicates that relatively
few seek treatment. A combined systematic review and
meta-analysis by Sharp et al. (2015) provides a useful
overview. For instance, it is estimated that 40–60% of
Veterans that would benefit from treatment do not seek
professional help (Hoge et al., 2004; Iversen et al., 2011;
Kehle et al., 2010). Studies also indicate that of the small
proportion of military personnel afflicted with PTSD
that do seek help, a majority receive help from non-
clinical sources, such as social workers or chaplains
(Hines, Goodwin, et al., 2014; Iversen et al., 2010).
Hoge (2011) argues that with current rates of treatment
seeking, and a recovery rate of approximately 40%, cur-
rent treatment strategies will only be able to reach
approximately 20% of Veterans in need of PTSD
treatment.

Combating the high rate at which military personnel
and Veterans withdraw from treatment for PTSD is
another critical challenge. A systematic review of dropout
from psychotherapy by Goetter et al. (2015) suggested an
overall pooled dropout rate of 36% for military personnel.
A similar review of nonmilitary PTSD patients estimated
a dropout rate of only 18% (Imel, Laska, Jakupcak, &
Simpson, 2013). Goetter et al. (2015) also indicated that
attrition among soldiers was even higher in routine clin-
ical settings than from clinical trials, and that younger
Veterans quit at a higher rate than older Veterans
(Goetter et al., 2015). As such, many Veterans unfortu-
nately terminate treatment prematurely, and therefore
may not experience significant symptom reduction.

MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY

301

A 2015 review of 36 randomized clinical trials (RCT)
examining psychotherapy for military-related PTSD
concluded that approximately two-thirds of patients
retained their diagnosis after treatment (Steenkamp,
Litz, Hoge, & Marmar, 2015). However, the review
also indicated that between 49–70% of patients attained
meaningful symptom reduction. It has not yet been
conclusively established whether outcomes of PTSD
treatment are poorer for military than civilian popula-
tions, although a growing body of evidence indicates
that they are (Bradley et al., 2005; Price, Gros, Strachan,
Ruggiero, & Acierno, 2013). If this is the case, it may be
necessary to consider novel intervention methods in
order to ensure more effective treatment of combat-
related PTSD (Steenkamp et al., 2015).

In summary, of the small portion of Veterans suffer-
ing from PTSD symptoms who seek and receive treat-
ment, only a slight majority experience symptom
reduction, and most retain their diagnosis.

Long-term effects of treatment

In a clinical context, experiencing an increase in mental
health symptoms after a period of treatment is referred
to as either a relapse or recurrence. The term relapse
generally refers to the return of symptoms associated
with a treated episode of mental illness, for instance in
cases where treatment
terminated prematurely
is
(Hollon, Thase, & Markowitz, 2002). In contrast, the
return of symptoms following a period of complete
recovery is referred to as a recurrence, and is thought
to represent the start of a new and separate episode
(Hollon et al., 2002). Unfortunately, as of yet there are
few studies which examine the duration of symptom
reduction among Veterans after treatment over an
extended period of time. For instance,
in a recent
review by Steenkamp et al. (2015) the follow-up period
in RCTs of first-line interventions ranged from no
follow-up at all to 12 months, with an average of
approximately 5 months. As a result, relatively little is
known about the rate at which Veterans diagnosed with
combat-related PTSD experience relapse or recurrence
after completing treatment.

Ensuring that

treatment gains are maintained
beyond the treatment period itself is essential to ensur-
ing that adequate care is being provided. Interventions
that result in temporary treatment gains, may offer
short-lived relief for patients, but may also have nega-
tive secondary consequences. Patients may become
averse to further treatment attempts or may conversely
become dependent on ineffective treatments (Institute
of Medicine
(US). Committee on Treatment of
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, 2008). Accordingly, the

302

E. E. BERGE ET AL.

Institute of Medicine recommends that evaluations of
treatment effectiveness should also determine to what
extent improvements decline, continue or are main-
tained (Institute of Medicine (US). Committee on
Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, 2008). If
current treatments of combat-related PTSD are found
to be ineffective in ensuring long-term improvements,
this would have several important implications. First,
such a finding would highlight the need for more
robust methods of early relapse detection and preven-
tion. Second, it is essential that Veterans who suffer
from the disorder are made aware of what to expect
with regards to long term prognosis, also after complet-
ing treatment. Finally, if symptom reduction for com-
bat-related PTSD is not maintained over
time,
necessitating multiple courses of treatment, estimates
of the overall societal cost of providing labor intensive
care to the Veteran population may be expected to
increase.

Aims of the systematic review

In an attempt to summarize what is currently known
about the long-term effects of the most commonly used
psychotherapies in the treatment of combat-related
PTSD among Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, this
systematic review will present a summary of the avail-
able literature. Assessing the long term treatment out-
the military clinical
comes for other subgroups of
population, such as Veterans of other eras of service
or Veterans suffering from military sexual trauma, is
beyond the scope of the present review. To the knowl-
edge of the authors no such review has been completed
in recent years. In particular the review will attempt to
summarize what the relapse and recurrence rates of
Veterans are indicated to be, as well as what charac-
terizes treatments associated with lower relapse and
recurrence rates. The present review was conducted in
accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins et al., 2019).

Methods

Eligibility criteria

For an RCT to be selected for the review it was required
to have (1) a sample consisting primarily of Veterans of
military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; (2) PTSD
as an inclusion criterion; (3) a majority of participants
that reported combat related trauma; (4) reported
symptom scores on standardized clinical measures of
PTSD at pretreatment, posttreatment, and for a follow-

up period of at least 6 months after treatment; (5)
utilized individual or group therapies that adhered to
the British National Institute of Clinical Excellence
(NICE), American Psychiatric Association (APA) or
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) guidelines for
first-line treatment of PTSD, and did not solely involve
pharmacotherapies.

Study selection and data collection

The results of the four searches were collated, and
duplicates were removed. All titles and abstracts were

screened to remove ineligible studies. For the remain-
ing potentially relevant studies, full-text versions were
retrieved and reviewed. The number of full-text papers
that were assessed and excluded at each stage, as well as
primary reasons
for exclusion, were reported in
a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart. The authors
manually extracted the necessary data items to deter-
mine the potential eligibility of the identified relevant
studies. The data items extracted from potentially rele-
vant studies included whether a study was randomized,
the treatment method used, sample size, whether parti-
cipants were primarily Veterans of Afghanistan and
Iraq, the PTSD outcome measure utilized, as well as
the length of follow-up.

Assessing risk of bias

The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to determine
the degree of potential bias. The Cochrane risk of bias
tool assesses (1) sequence generation; (2) allocation
concealment; (3) blinding of participants and person-
nel; (4) blinding of outcome assessors; (5) incomplete
outcome data; (6) and selective outcome reporting. The
first and last author evaluated risk of bias of individual
studies independently of each other. Discrepancies were
discussed in order to reach consensus.

above the cutoff point, the amount of improvement
necessary to qualify for “loss of diagnosis” will vary.
In the case of CAPS the diagnostic cutoff is commonly
set at 45 points or less (Weathers, Ruscio, & Keane,
1999). If a participant in a study had experienced one of
these three forms of improvement at post-treatment,
but no longer did so at follow-up, they were thought to
have experienced a relapse or recurrence.

Results

The literature search returned 533 references which,
after removal of duplicates, resulted in 491 unique
references. The authors screened the titles and abstracts
of these references and identified 75 potentially relevant
references. After further assessment, it was concluded
that 8 of these potentially relevant studies fulfilled the
inclusion criteria and were therefore included in the
review. Reasons
for exclusion at each stage are
described in the PRISMA flow diagram (see Figure 1).

Excluded studies

Of the 75 potentially relevant articles assessed for elig-
ibility, 67 were excluded after closer examination. Of
these, 26 studies were excluded for not being randomized
trials, 29 were excluded for not having a sample wherein
a majority were Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, 4
studies did not require participants to have a diagnosis
of PTSD, 2 did not utilize approved treatment methods

remission refers to a full recovery from previously

a predefined cutoff point on a given trauma symptom
scale. For
the Clinician
Administered PTSD Symptom Scale (CAPS) partici-
pants scoring at or below 20 points are considered to
be in remission (Weathers, Keane, & Davidson, 2001).
Similarly, the term clinically meaningful change refers
to a decrease in reported trauma symptoms which is
thought to be large enough to constitute a meaningful
change in the patients experienced symptoms, rather
than insignificant fluctuations in symptom severity. For
instance, a decrease of 15 points or more in CAPS total
score is deemed to represent a clinically meaningful
change (Weathers et al., 2001). Finally, loss of diagnosis
refers to a decrease in experienced trauma symptoms
that is large enough that the participant no longer
fulfills the criteria of the PTSD diagnosis. As a given
participant may have a score that lies just above or far

periods. For specific exclusion reasons for all potentially

(Appendix A: Characteristics of excluded
studies).

Included studies

The studies included in the present review had the
following characteristics (see also supplemental online
material Appendix B: Characteristics of
included
studies):

Design
One of the included studies was a non-inferiority trial
(Acierno et al., 2017) while another (Castillo et al., 2016)
utilized a wait list control group. A third study (Reger
et al., 2016) utilized a combined parallel-group and wait
list design, with two arms receiving simultaneous treat-
ment and a third waitlist group serving as a control. The
remaining six studies all used a parallel-group design. All
included studies were randomized at the participant level.

Sample sizes
In the present review a total of 1041 participants were
allocated to 18 conditions across the 8 studies. Sample
sizes ranged from 26 (Litz et al., 2012) to 268 partici-
pants per study (Resick et al., 2017). Other than the
study by Litz et al. (2012) and one additional study
which had a sample of 86 participants (Castillo et al.,
2016), the remaining six studies all had samples of at
least 100 participants (Acierno et al., 2017; Kozel et al.,
2018; Reger et al., 2016; Resick et al., 2017, 2015;
Rothbaum et al., 2014).

Setting
All included studies were conducted in the USA. Three
studies recruited active duty service members via referrals
from providers at military medical centers (Reger et al.,
2016; Resick et al., 2017, 2015). One of these studies also
allowed for self-referral via study advertisements posted
within military installations (Reger et al., 2016). Four
studies recruited Veterans from Veterans Affairs medical
centers and hospitals (Acierno et al., 2017; Castillo et al.,
2016; Kozel et al., 2018; Litz et al., 2012). One of these
studies also recruited participants from Veteran centers,
local universities and colleges with Veteran enrollment, as
well as nonprofit Veteran associated service organizations
(Kozel et al., 2018). One study did not specify where
participants were recruited from (Rothbaum et al., 2014).

Participants
The majority of participants included in the present
review were male. The three studies that examined active
duty service members (Reger et al., 2016; Resick et al.,
2017, 2015) all had samples that were over 90% male. Two
studies had samples that were homogenous, with one
study using an entirely male sample of Veterans (Litz
et al., 2012), and another using an entirely female sample
of Veterans (Castillo et al., 2016). Of the remaining three
studies, two had Veteran samples that were over 90%
male (Acierno et al., 2017; Rothbaum et al., 2014). The
final study did not report specific participant gender
statistics, but did report having a predominantly male
sample of Veterans (Kozel et al., 2018). All participants
in all included studies satisfied diagnostic criteria for
PTSD. All participants in all but one of the studies also
exclusively reported combat-related trauma after deploy-
ments to Afghanistan or Iraq. The exception (Acierno et
al., 2017) reported that 61% of its participants had been
deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.

Exclusion criteria
The criteria that were used to determine inclusion or exclu-
sion of potential participants varied somewhat between
studies, although there were a number of similarities. For
instance, all studies reported active psychotic symptoms as
an exclusion criteria, and most studies also excluded based
on suicidal ideation and substance dependence. All studies
required their participants to maintain stable regimes of
prescribed psychotropic medications during the treatment
period. One of the studies, which utilized repetitive tran-
scranial magnetic stimulation in combination with psy-
chotherapy, also excluded participants based on a number
of medical contraindications such as seizures, dementia and
pregnancy. Four studies listed traumatic brain injuries as an
exclusion criteria in their studies, with one only excluding
severe injuries (Resick et al., 2017), and three excluding
both moderate and severe traumatic brain injuries (Kozel
et al., 2018; Resick et al., 2015; Rothbaum et al., 2014).
Finally, five of the studies required their participants to
not receive any other psychotherapy for PTSD during the
treatment period (Acierno et al., 2017; Castillo et al., 2016;
Kozel et al., 2018; Litz et al., 2012; Reger et al., 2016). Of the
three remaining studies, one explicitly mentioned allowing
participants to undergo parallel treatment (Resick et al.,
2017), while the other two made no mention of simulta-
neous psychotherapies (Resick et al., 2015; Rothbaum et al.,
2014).

Interventions
All experimental interventions included in the present
review used forms of either exposure therapy or cognitive
processing therapy. For more comprehensive descriptions

Characteristics of included studies).

Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and CAPS. The
remaining six studies did not report any measures of
diagnostic interrater reliability.

PTSD Measures

Treatment completion

Of the eight studies included in the present review, seven
used a clinician-administered measure of PTSD (Castillo
et al., 2016; Kozel et al., 2018; Litz et al., 2012; Reger et al.,
2016; Resick et al., 2017, 2015; Rothbaum et al., 2014). In
five of the studies the clinician administered measure used
was the Clinician Administered PTSD Symptom Scale
(CAPS) (Castillo et al., 2016; Kozel et al., 2018; Litz
et al., 2012; Reger et al., 2016; Rothbaum et al., 2014).
Two studies used the Posttraumatic Symptom Scale-
Interview Version (PSS-I) (Resick et al., 2017, 2015).
Five of the studies with a primary clinician-administered
measure of PTSD also reported a secondary self-report
measure. These included the original (Kozel et al., 2018),
military (Litz et al., 2012), civilian (Reger et al., 2016), and
stressor specific (Resick et al., 2017) versions of the PTSD
checklist (PCL). Another study used the Posttraumatic
Symptom Scale- Self Report Version (PSS-SR) as
a secondary outcome measure (Rothbaum et al., 2014).
Two studies used a self-report measure as their primary
outcome measure, namely the PTSD checklist-military
(PCL-M) (Acierno et al., 2017), and the PTSD checklist-
stressor specific version (PCL-S) (Resick et al., 2015). Two
studies reported rates of diagnostic interrater reliability
for clinician administered assessments. Resick et al.
(2015) reported good interrater diagnostic reliability
(ĸ =.83) for the PSS-I based on at least 5% of independent
evaluators interviews. Rothbaum et al. (2014) reported
100% interrater reliability for the primary diagnostic
assessment which consisted of the Mini-International

Many of the included studies described issues of high
dropout rates from both treatment and control conditions.
The number of sessions attended in order to be considered
a completer differed between studies. As a result the defini-
tion of treatment completion provided by the individual
studies was used in assessing treatment acceptability.

All included studies minimally reported PTSD outcome
measures at pretreatment, posttreatment and at last follow-
up. In one study the posttreatment assessment took place
one week after the final treatment session (Acierno et al.,
2017). In six of the studies the final follow-up assessment
took place six months after treatment was completed
(Acierno et al., 2017; Castillo et al., 2016; Kozel et al.,
2018; Litz et al., 2012; Reger et al., 2016; Resick et al.,
2017), while the final two studies conducted the final fol-
low-up assessment 12 months after treatment completion
(Resick et al., 2015; Rothbaum et al., Prevalence of bias in
studies2014).

Risk of bias in included studies

Bias assessments were conducted independently by the
first and last author. The results were then compared,
and divergent assessments were discussed before a final
decision was made. For details on the “Risk of bias”
judgments for each study, please refer to the supple-
mental online material (Appendix A: Characteristics of
included studies). The overall assessments of bias in the

Allocation
Four studies specified the method of sequence genera-
tion and allocation used and were judged as being at
low risk of selection bias (Acierno et al., 2017; Kozel
et al., 2018; Litz et al., 2012; Reger et al., 2016). One
study was judged to be at low risk of selection bias due
to sequence generation and at an unclear risk of selec-
tion bias due to potentially inadequate concealment
(Resick et al., 2017). Three studies did not adequately
describe the method of sequence generation used and
were therefore judged as being at unclear risk of selec-
tion bias (Castillo et al., 2016; Resick et al., 2015;
Rothbaum et al., 2014).

Blinding
In studies assessing psychotherapy participants and
personnel cannot normally be blinded to treatment
allocations. As a result, all studies comparing different
methods of psychotherapy were judged to be at high
risk of performance bias (Acierno et al., 2017; Castillo
et al., 2016; Reger et al., 2016; Resick et al., 2017, 2015).
The three remaining studies were judged to be at low
risk of performance bias (Kozel et al., 2018; Litz et al.,
2012; Rothbaum et al., 2014). All eight studies were
judged to be at low risk of detection bias with regards
to clinician-rated outcomes. With regards to patient-
reported outcome measures, the five studies comparing
different methods of psychotherapy were also judged to
be at high risk of detection bias (Acierno et al., 2017;
Castillo et al., 2016; Reger et al., 2016; Resick et al.,
2017, 2015).

Incomplete outcome data
Seven studies clearly reported drop-out and loss to
follow-up and performed intention-to-treat (ITT) ana-
lyses on all randomized participants (Castillo et al.,
2016; Kozel et al., 2018; Litz et al., 2012; Reger et al.,
2016; Resick et al., 2017, 2015; Rothbaum et al., 2014).
However, five of these studies had such high rates of
data-loss that they were automatically judged to be at
high risk of attrition bias (Kozel et al., 2018; Litz et al.,

2012; Reger et al., 2016; Resick et al., 2017, 2015;
Rothbaum et al., 2014). One study reported conducting
a modified ITT analysis, and was therefore judged to be
a at a high risk of attrition bias (Acierno et al., 2017).

Selective reporting
For seven studies, all prespecified PTSD-related out-
come measures were reported at all prespecified time-
points, and were therefore judged to be at low risk of
reporting bias (Acierno et al., 2017; Castillo et al., 2016;
Litz et al., 2012; Reger et al., 2016; Resick et al., 2017,
2015; Rothbaum et al., 2014). One study was judged to
be at an unclear risk of reporting bias (Kozel et al.,
2018).

Measures of relapse and recurrence

Only one study reported rates of remission, clinically
meaningful change and loss of diagnosis at both post-
treatment and last follow-up (Castillo et al., 2016). One
study reported both changes in clinically meaningful
change and loss of diagnosis, but did not report these
statistics at last follow-up for the group receiving pro-
longed exposure therapy combined with d-cycloserine
(Litz et al., 2012). One study reported clinically mean-
ingful change at post-treatment and follow-up for all
conditions (Resick et al., 2015). Another study reported
rates of clinically meaningful change for all conditions,
but only at posttreatment (Reger et al., 2016). Two
studies reported loss of diagnosis both at posttreatment
and last follow up for all treatment conditions (Resick
et al., 2017; Rothbaum et al., 2014). Finally, two studies
did not report any rates of remission, clinically mean-
ingful change or loss of diagnosis for any treatment
conditions at any time points (Acierno et al., 2017;
Kozel et al., 2018).

Effects of interventions

Only one study was not deemed to be at a high risk of
attrition bias (Castillo et al., 2016). It was however

judged to be at a high risk of performance bias, as well
as an unclear risk of selection bias. The study reported
overall rates of remission, clinically meaningful change
and loss of diagnosis, both at posttreatment and at the
last follow-up assessment, indicating a slight decrease
in all three measures. However, as the study utilized
a waitlist condition, no such long-term outcome statis-
tics were available for a control group. As such no
useful comparison of relevant outcome measures is
possible based on the literature included in the present
review. For an overview of relapse and recurrence
related outcome statistics for all included studies, please
refer to Table 2.

Discussion

Lack of research

few of

The present review identified relatively few eligible
studies on the topic of long-term treatment outcomes
for PTSD among Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. In
addition,
these eligible studies consistently
reported relevant relapse and recurrence related out-
come statistics, such as rates of clinically meaningful
loss of diagnosis, or remission. Only three
change,
studies reported a relevant outcome statistic for all
conditions and at both post-treatment and follow-up.
No study reported all three outcome statistics for more
than one condition, and no study reported actual rates
of relapse or recurrence. As such, it was not possible to
estimate an overall relapse or recurrence rate. However,
based on the studies returned by the literature search,
certain observations may be made about the research

literature

that is currently available. A sizable number of studies
have been conducted on PTSD among Veterans in
general, and in recent years on Veterans of Iraq and
Afghanistan in particular. The
search
returned 34 potentially relevant RCTs that were con-
ducted on Veterans suffering from PTSD, eight of
which were included in the final review. The average
follow-up period for these 34 studies was four months,
with 19 of the studies not meeting the minimum cri-
teria of six months, and eight of the studies reporting
no follow-up period at all. Similarly, 22 of the studies
either did not report what conflict their participants
had been deployed to, or reported that a majority of
their participants had deployed to other theaters than
Iraq and Afghanistan. In summary, a minority of the
studies returned by the literature search were con-
and
ducted
Afghanistan, and most had follow-up periods that
were too short to assess long-term outcomes. These
tendencies may represent two potential deficits in the

Quality of current research

In addition to the small number of eligible studies
available on the present topic, the quality of the studies
that are available should be addressed. In particular,
the included studies are characterized by high risk of
performance and attrition bias. Although a risk of
performance bias is inherent to most studies that com-
pare psychotherapeutic interventions, the high rate of

308

attrition bias may indicate a much more serious con-
cern. It is important to note the distinction between
dropout and loss of data. Although the decision of
participants to terminate treatment may often be
beyond the control of researchers, the same does not
necessarily apply to the collection of follow-up data.
The Institute of Medicine argues that studies that
either exceed a 15% difference in data-loss between
groups, or exceeds 40% data-loss in any group, auto-
matically indicates a high risk of bias, regardless of the
analytic methods used to handle the missing data
(Institute of Medicine (US). Committee on Treatment
of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, 2008). The average
loss of data at final follow-up for the included studies
was 48%, with three studies reporting loss of data that
exceeded 60%. In accordance with the Institute of
Medicine, these rates of data-loss are so high that
results will be at high risk of bias, regardless of the
analytic methods employed (Institute of Medicine
(US). Committee on Treatment of Posttraumatic
Stress Disorder, 2008). As a result, even if the literature
search had returned a larger number of eligible but
methodologically similar studies, little could be reliably
concluded based on their results anyway. In summary,
high rates of data-loss lead to an increased risk of
attrition bias which poses a serious threat to the quality
of the available research. This may in turn have impli-
cations for the validity of conclusions drawn on the
basis of such research.

Exclusion criteria

With regards to the quality of currently available
research, the variety in the participant exclusion criteria
used in the included studies should also be stressed.
Participant characteristics such as substance dependence
and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are particularly pre-
valent comorbidities among active duty soldiers and
Veterans (Hoge et al., 2004; Seal et al., 2007), and are
thought to influence a participant’s ability to effectively
(Bryant & Hopwood, 2006;
engage
Ouimette, Goodwin, & Brown, 2006). A disparity within
the literature with regards to whether participants should
be excluded on the basis of these factors or not is
problematic for several reasons.

in treatment

First, the exclusion of participants based on highly
comorbid factors which are thought to both affect a large
portion of the clinical population and hinder effective
treatment, may lead to misleading estimates of treatment
efficacy and dramatically limit the generalizability of
results. Conversely, overinclusion of participants with
a variety of potentially confounding secondary condi-
impede any meaningful discoveries about
tions will

PTSD as an independent disorder. As a result, conflict-
ing inclusion criteria may therefore also lead to conflict-
ing conclusions regarding treatment efficacy.

Secondly, estimates of total treatment efficacy based
on meta-analysis or systematic reviews will be of lim-
ited use if the samples of the included studies are too
different to be compared. These issues highlight the
importance of identifying and separately examining
the largest subgroups within the clinical population
with regards to comorbid disorders. Studies of patients
suffering only from PTSD, but none of the most pre-
valent comorbid disorders, will be unable to assess what
constitutes effective treatment for patients with comor-
bid disorders. Ideally the available body of research
would be both extensive and diverse enough to include
both studies with strict
inclusion criteria, enabling
observation of PTSD as an independent disorder, as
well as studies specifically aimed toward furthering
our understanding of patients with the most common
and disruptive comorbid disorders.

Another aspect of participant selection that is worth
noting are the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, as considerable
changes were made to these criteria in the newest edition of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-5; Pai, Suris, & North, 2017). These changes may in
turn have implications for the diagnostic assessments that
are made in selecting study participants. As the present
review includes studies that were published both before
and after the release of the DSM-5, it is pertinent to evaluate
to what extent this may have influenced the utility of the
review. In the present review all included studies describe
having utilized diagnostic criteria based on the DSM-IV. As
such, there is no reason to believe that a comparison of
study results would be complicated by differing diagnostic
criteria. Such a comparison is however complicated by the
inconsistent reporting of interrater diagnostic reliability in
the included studies. As a majority did not report any such
measures, it is difficult to assess whether participant selec-
tion was based on accurate diagnostic assessments.

In summary, a disparity in participant exclusion cri-
teria and inadequate reporting of diagnostic interrater
reliability may pose a threat to the generalizability and
utility of study results. As an understanding of what
constitutes effective treatment for patients both with
and without comorbid disorders is vital, it is important
that a consensus on exclusion criteria is agreed upon,
and that studies are conducted on all sub-groups.

Definition of relapse and recurrence

The comprehensive summary by the Institute of Medicine
(2008) on modern PTSD research argues that there is no
generally accepted or used definition of recovery within

the field of psychological trauma. To the knowledge of the
author, no widely accepted definitions of trauma-related
relapse or recurrence currently exists either. As with the
term “recovery”, there may be many similarities between
trauma-related relapse and recurrence, and the empiri-
cally supported, and accepted definitions of similar terms
within the literature on other disorders. However, as of
now there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that this is
the case. As such, the development of empirically sup-
ported and consistent definitions of relapse-related terms
would facilitate more methodologically robust studies of
the disorder in the future.

Quality of outcome statistics

Although changes in outcome related statistics such as
rates of remission, clinically meaningful change and loss
of diagnosis are the most common indicators of the total
rate of relapse or recurrence within a clinical sample, these
are inaccurate estimates as they do not include individual
patient statistics. Consequently, a comparison of what
percentage of participants experienced clinically signifi-
cant improvement at post-treatment compared to final
follow-up constitutes a poor statistic of overall relapse or
recurrence rates. This estimate will, for instance, poten-
tially be affected by the number of participants who did
not experience a significant amount of improvement by
the end of treatment, but did experience a spontaneous
improvement during the follow-up period. In addition, an
assessment of changes in clinically significant improve-
ment rates takes into account all participants, whether
they experienced an improvement or not. An estimate
of relapse or recurrence would ideally only take into
account individuals who achieved responder status by
the end of treatment, and then assess what percentage of
these individuals maintained their responder status at the
final assessment. As such, an outcome statistic that would
more accurately reflect relapse or recurrence rates in
future studies would be the proportion of participants
who did not maintain a clinically significant improve-
loss of diagnosis or remission at the last data
ment,
collection point. The utility of such a measure would,
however, necessitate long enough follow-up periods for
impending relapses or recurrences to be observed. More
systematic reporting of what portion of participants that
have received treatment for PTSD earlier, would also be of
interest. Finally, recording which of these previously trea-
ted participants have experienced a symptom free period
in the interim would enable researchers to determine
whether participants are currently experiencing a relapse
or recurrence. In summary, if future research is to provide
accurate assessments of long-term treatment outcomes
and overall estimates of relapse and recurrence rates,

more accurate long-term statistics of relapse and recur-
rence must be reported.

Limitations

the

deployed

international

There are several limitations to the present systematic
review. First, the small number of eligible studies con-
stitutes a major limitation with regards to estimating an
overall relapse and recurrence rate. Second, the sys-
tematic review would ideally utilize a longer follow-up
period than 6 months as an inclusion criterion. This
may very well be too short a period of time to reliably
observe impending recurrences or relapses. In compar-
the Institute of Medicine refers to long-term
ison,
effects of
treatment as those that persist beyond
12 months (Institute of Medicine (US). Committee on
Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, 2008).
Third, the search engine strategy that was implemented
in the present review yielded an 85% irrelevant record
result. One could therefore argue that further attempts
could have been made to refine the strategy. However,
to our knowledge such a high rate of irrelevant record
results is not uncommon for systematic literature
searches. Fourth, the entirety of the sample in this
review consists of American Veterans and active duty
military personnel. This is not surprising as a majority
of
both
troops
Afghanistan and Iraq during the last two decades have
been American. All the same, the review would be
strengthened by the inclusion of studies examining
military personnel from other NATO member coun-
tries deployed to the
conflict.
A comparison of outcome measures in the context of
Veteran nationality would also be of great interest, with
regard to both cultural and clinical differences in treat-
ing combat-related PTSD. The inclusion of both active
duty personnel and Veterans in the review may also
constitute a potential limitation. It is conceivable that
long term treatment outcomes and rates of relapse/
recurrence for these groups are not directly compar-
able, given that active duty soldiers are at higher risk of
redeploying. This may in turn increase the likelihood of
future relapse/recurrence. As such, one could argue that
separate analyses should be conducted for each of these
subgroups. Fifth, the review would be strengthened by
including studies of other empirically supported treat-
ment methods. In particular, one could argue that eye
movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is
a common psychotherapeutic treatment that is missing
from the present review. Lastly, as argued above, the
current literature and therefore this review is limited by
inaccurate and inconsistently reported statistics of
relapse and recurrence.

Implications for future research

The aforementioned flaws in current research on the
topic of relapse and recurrence among Veterans, as well
as the general shortage of available studies, indicate
several recommendations for future research on the
subject. In order to contribute to valid estimates of
long term treatment efficacy and relapse/recurrence,
future studies should seek to conduct randomized con-
trolled trials, as many of the studies excluded from the
present review were done so on the basis of lacking
randomization. Similarly, future studies should seek to
extend the follow-up period after completed treatment,
so as to better outline long term outcomes and allow
for impending relapses and recurrences to be observed.
With regards to follow-up, the present review also
highlights
the importance of developing methods
aimed toward limiting the high rate of data loss in
clinical trials of Veterans, so as to avoid being at an
automatic risk of attrition bias. In addition, it is advi-
sable that researchers strive to use more accurate sta-
tistics of relapse and recurrence, and report them more
consistently. Furthermore, the development of trauma
specific definitions of relapse and recurrence would
greatly improve the quality of future research on the
topic. Finally, an empirically founded consensus among
researchers with regards to exclusion criteria for parti-
cipants, as well as conducting separate studies on the
largest currently excluded subgroups within the clinical
population would be beneficial.

Iraq and
Afghanistan based on the available studies. This is, in
and of itself, an important finding, as it highlights
a deficiency in recent research on this important clin-
ical population. Based on the large body of research
that was returned by the literature search and subse-
quently excluded from the review, as well as an assess-
ment of risk of bias in the studies that were included,
the present review outlines a number of areas of
improvement and recommendations for future studies.
