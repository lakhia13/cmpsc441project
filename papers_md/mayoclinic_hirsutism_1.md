### Research: It's all about patients


Joseph Sirven, M.D., Professor of Neurology, Mayo Clinic:Mayo's mission is about the patient. The patient comes first. So the mission and research here is to advance how we can best help the patient, how to make sure the patient comes first in care. So in many ways, it's a cycle. It can start with as simple as an idea worked on in a laboratory, brought to the patient bedside, and if everything goes right — and let's say it's helpful or beneficial — then
brought on as a standard approach. And I think that is one of the unique characteristics of Mayo's approach to research — that patient-centeredness — that really helps to put it in its own spotlight.
