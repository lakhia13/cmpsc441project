Abstract

Despite evidence that empirically supported couple therapies improve marital relationships, 
relatively few couples seek help when they need it. Low-income couples are particularly unlikely 
to engage in relationship interventions despite being at greater risk for distress and dissolution than 
their higher-income counterparts. The present study aimed to clarify how premarital education 
influences couples’ progression through different stages of later help-seeking, as identified in prior 
research. Using five waves of self-report data from a sample of 431 ethnically diverse newlywed 
couples living in low-income neighborhoods, analyses revealed that wives who received premarital 
education later considered seeking therapy at a higher level of relationship satisfaction and lower 
level of problem severity than those who did not receive premarital education, though this was not 
true for husbands. Wives who received premarital education were also more likely as newlyweds 
to say that they would seek therapy if their relationship was in trouble, though husbands were not. 
Spouses who considered seeking therapy were more likely to follow through with participation if 
they had received premarital education, whereas if they had not received premarital education they 
were more likely to consider seeking therapy without following through. Similarly, among couples 
who received therapy, those who also received premarital education sought therapy earlier than 
those who did not receive premarital education, though not at a higher level of relationship 
satisfaction. Taken together, these results suggest that participation in premarital education is 
linked with later help-seeking by empowering couples to take steps throughout their marriage to 
maintain their relationship.

Although empirically-supported couple therapies reliably improve relationships (e.g., 
Baucom, Atkins, Rowe, Doss, & Christensen, 2015), relatively few couples seek help when 
they need it (Halford, Kelly, & Markman, 1997). Efforts to increase rates of help-seeking 
among couples are complicated by the fact that both spouses are required to participate, and 
men in particular appear to be less interested in seeking therapy and slower to pursue 
treatment once the decision is made (Doss, Atkins, & Christensen, 2003; also see Addis & 
Mahalik, 2003). The present study aims to understand how couples naturally seek help and 
how prior experience with premarital education might contribute to this process. We focus 
specifically on help-seeking among couples living with low incomes — couples who are less 
likely to participate in relationship interventions than middle-class couples (Halford, 
O’Donnell, Lizzio, & Wilson, 2006; Sullivan & Bradbury, 1997) despite being at greater risk 
for distress and dissolution (e.g., Bramlett & Mosher, 2001).

Increasing uptake of couple therapy may pivot on couples’ earlier experiences with 
premarital education. Although the long-term effectiveness of premarital education remains 
a topic of debate (Bradbury & Lavner, 2012; Cowan & Cowan, 2014), these programs are 
widely available and very well-received by couples (Halford & Bodenmann, 2013). To the 
extent that premarital education does improve relationships, we would predict that couples’ 
newly established skills and awareness should reduce their need for later treatment. 
Paradoxically, however, couples who receive premarital education appear to be more likely 
to seek couple therapy compared those who do not receive it, a possibility suggested by 
early developers of premarital education programs (Halford, Markman, Kline, & Stanley, 
2003; Stanley, 2001) and later demonstrated empirically (Williamson, Trail, Bradbury, & 
Karney, 2014). Described as the gateway effect, this finding suggests that participation in 
premarital education induces later help-seeking by empowering couples to maintain their 
relationship and directing them to resources that enable them to do so. This view implies that 
increasing participation in premarital education will lead to greater rather than lesser 
eventual use of couple therapy, perhaps at a time when relationships are still functioning 
relatively well. We build on this premise by undertaking a replication of the gateway effect 
and, more critically, by specifying how participation in premarital education might affect the 
process by which couples later seek therapy.

Drawing from Doss, Atkins, and Christensen’s (2003) model of couple help-seeking, we 
propose that participation in premarital education will operate upon the progression toward 
help-seeking in three ways. In the initial stage, partners first recognize and acknowledge 
friction in the relationship that they cannot readily repair on their own. Here, premarital 
education might increase couples’ awareness of relationship problems earlier in their 
marriage, at a time when these problems may be more easily resolved. Consistent with this 
possibility, premarital education programs appear to heighten awareness of communication 
deficits targeted specifically within those programs (e.g., couples trained to resolve conflict 
appear to have greater awareness of unresolved conflict; Rogge, Cobb, Lawrence, Johnson,

& Bradbury, 2013). In the second stage, partners consider what to do about their difficulties 
and whether or not couple therapy could be a solution for them. Couples with prior 
experience in premarital education should be more likely to consider counseling to be a 
viable option, compared to couples who had not experienced premarital education. Finally, 
in Doss et al.’s (2003) third stage, partners actively participate in couple therapy. At this 
point we might expect that premarital education participants would feel less threatened by 
therapy, and more inclined to see value in more intensive intervention, and therefore take 
steps as a couple to seek it out.

In this study we test three predictions about how participation in premarital education will 
covary with couples’ progression through these stages of help-seeking. First, to examine 
whether premarital education is associated with heightened awareness of relationship 
problems, we test whether couples who receive premarital education consider seeking 
therapy when their relationship satisfaction is higher and their levels of relationship 
problems are lower, compared to couples who did not receive premarital education. Second, 
to examine whether premarital education is associated with considering treatment, we test 
whether couples who receive premarital education are more likely as newlyweds to report 
that they will seek professional help and to report that they have considered seeking therapy 
after marrying. Third, to examine whether premarital education covaries with help-seeking 
behaviors, we test whether premarital education receipt is associated with an increased 
likelihood that couples who consider seeking therapy actually receive it, and whether those 
who receive premarital education convert from considering to seeking therapy more quickly 
than couples who did not receive premarital education.

We conduct these tests using five waves of self-report data, collected over the first four-five 
years of marriage from a sample of 431 ethnically diverse couples living in low-income 
communities. We focus on this important segment of the population in response to calls for 
greater diversity in research on couples (e.g., Karney, Kreitz, & Sweeney, 2004; Rogge et al., 
2006) and more specifically because enhancing relationships among people living with 
sociodemographic disadvantage can stabilize the financial status of people who, were they to 
divorce, would be subject to even more severe forms of poverty and especially poor child 
outcomes (e.g., Amato, 2000). More pointedly, the gateway effect is especially strong for 
high-risk populations, including African American couples and couples living with lower 
incomes and less formal education (Williamson, Trail, Bradbury, & Karney, 2014). 
Understanding how premarital education may increase use of couple therapy is therefore 
likely to have greater impact on vulnerable couples than on couples with more economic 
resources.

Method

Sampling

The sampling procedure was designed to yield first-married newlywed couples in which 
both partners were of the same ethnicity (Hispanic, African American, or Caucasian), living 
in neighborhoods with a high proportion of low-income residents in Los Angeles County. 
Recently married couples were identified through names and addresses on marriage license 
applications. Addresses were matched with census data to identify applicants living in low-

income communities, defined as census block groups wherein the median household income 
was no more than 160% of the 1999 federal poverty level for a 4-person family. Next, names 
on the licenses were weighted using data from a Bayesian Census Surname Combination, 
which integrates census and surname information to produce a multinomial probability of 
membership in each of four racial/ethnic categories (Hispanic, African American, Asian, and 
Caucasian/other). Couples were chosen using probabilities proportionate to the ratio of 
target prevalences to the population prevalences, weighted by the couple’s average estimated 
probability of being Hispanic, African American, or Caucasian. A total of 3,793 couples 
were contacted through the addresses they listed on their marriage licenses, and offered the 
opportunity to participate in a longitudinal study of newlywed development. Of the 3,793 
couples contacted, 2,049 could not be reached and 1,522 responded to the mailing and 
agreed to be screened for eligibility. Of those, 824 couples were screened as eligible, and 
658 of them agreed to participate in the study, with 431 couples actually completing the 
study.

The sample comprised 862 spouses (431 couples) identified with the above procedures. At 
baseline, marriages averaged 4.8 months in duration (SD = 2.5); 38.5% of couples had 
children. Mean ages were 26.3 (SD = 5.0) for women and 27.9 (SD = 5.8) for men. Median 
household income was $45,000. Twelve percent of couples were African American, 12% 
were Caucasian, and 76% were Hispanic.

At baseline (T1), couples were visited in their homes by two interviewers who took spouses 
to separate areas to describe the IRB approved study, obtain informed consent, and orally 
administer self-report measures. Interviewers returned at 9 months (T2), 18 months (T3), 
and 27 months after baseline (T4) and administered the same interview protocol. Couples 
who reported that they had divorced or separated did not complete the interview. Following 
each interview couples were debriefed and paid $75 for T1, $100 for T2, $125 for T3 and 
$150 for T4. At Time 5 (T5), which occurred an average of 22 months after T4, all intact 
couples and spouses from dissolved couples were contacted via telephone. Each individual 
was compensated $25 for the T5 interview. Data collection took place between 2009 and 
2013 for T1 through T4. Collection of T5 data occurred in February and March 2014.

Over the course of the study, 93 couples (21.6%) were lost to attrition while 55 couples 
(12.8%) divorced or legally separated. The average number of waves completed was 4.08 
out of 5; 241 couples completed all five waves, 89 couples completed four waves, 36 
couples completed three waves, 24 couples completed two waves, and 41 couples completed 
only baseline. Missing data was handled by using all available data for analysis. Thus, if a 
couple completed fewer than all five waves of assessment their cumulative variables (i.e., 
consideration of couple therapy, receipt of relationship counseling) were calculated based 
upon the waves at which they provided data.

Measures

Page 5

Premarital Education—At T1 participants were asked “Did the two of you receive any 
sort of relationship education or classes before you got married?” Reponses were coded as 0 
= no and 1= yes. Couples were coded as receiving premarital education if either spouse 
responded yes. In 86% of couples, partners agreed on whether or not they received 
premarital education. In 7% of couples the husband reported that they received premarital 
education but the wife did not, and in 7% of couples the wife reported that they received 
premarital education and the husband did not.

Help-seeking Intentions—Participants’ intentions to seek therapy in the future if they 
were to experience relationship difficulties were measured with two items administered at 
T1. Participants were asked; “If you and [SPOUSE NAME] were having marital difficulties, 
what would you do about it?” Responses to the option “get therapy” were coded as 0 = no 
and 1 = yes. Next participants were asked; “If you needed to, who would you talk to about 
your marriage?” Individuals who responded yes to “professional counselor” and/or “other 
professional (doctor, social worker, etc.)” were coded as 0 = no and 1 = yes.

Consideration of Couple Therapy—Whether participants had considered seeking help 
for their relationship was assessed by asking “In the last nine months, did you ever consider 
seeking or receiving counseling for this relationship?” at T2 – T5. Responses were coded 0 = 
no and 1 = yes at each time point and then collapsed across time points, such that an 
individual who responded yes at any time point was coded as 1 and individuals who 
responded no at all time points were coded as 0.

To calculate the level of relationship satisfaction and problem severity at which participants 
considered seeking therapy, we used the relationship satisfaction and problem severity 
scores reported at the time point prior to when they reported considering therapy. For 
example, if an individual reported at T2 that they had considered seeking therapy at some 
point over the past 9 months, their relationship satisfaction and problem severity scores from 
T1 would be assigned as the level at which they considered therapy.

Relationship Counseling—At T2 – T5 participants were asked “In the last nine months, 
have you received counseling for this relationship?” Reponses were coded as 1= yes and 0 = 
no. Couples were coded as receiving counseling if either spouse responded yes. In 86% of 
couples, partners agreed on whether or not they received counseling. In 5% of couples the 
husband reported that they received counseling but the wife did not, and in 9% of couples 
the wife reported that they received counseling and the husband did not.

To calculate the level of relationship satisfaction and problem severity at which participants 
sought counseling, we used the relationship satisfaction and problem severity scores 
reported at the time point prior to when they reported receiving counseling. For example, if 
an individual reported at T2 that they had received counseling at some point over the past 9 
months, their relationship satisfaction and problem severity scores from T1 would be 
assigned as the level at which they received counseling.

Relationship Satisfaction—Relationship satisfaction at each time point was assessed by 
summing responses on an eight-item questionnaire. Five items asked how satisfied the 
respondent was with certain areas of their relationship (e.g., “satisfaction with the amount of 
time spent together”), and were scored on a 5-point scale (ranging from 1 = Very dissatisfied 
to 5 = Very satisfied). Three items asked the degree to which the participant agreed with a 
statement about their relationship, (e.g., “how much do you trust your partner”) and were 
scored on a 4-point scale (1 = Not at all, 2 = Not that much, 3 = Somewhat, 4 = Completely). 
Coefficient α exceeded .70 for husbands and wives across all time points.

Relationship Problem Severity—At T1–T5 participants rated how much each of 28 
common areas of marital disagreement (e.g., management of money, relationships with in-
laws; adapted from Geiss & O’Leary, 1981) was a source of difficulty/disagreement in their 
relationship on a scale of 0 to 10, such that higher scores reflected issues that caused 
frequent or intense conflict. To measure the maximum severity of the relationship problems, 
each participant’s maximum problem rating (possible score 0–10) across the 28 items was 
assigned as their problem score.

Results

Descriptive Statistics and Preliminary Analyses

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the study variables. Roughly 45% of couples 
received premarital education, which is relatively high in comparison to other studies of 
premarital education (e.g., 29% reported by Halford and colleagues (2006)). At the time of 
marriage, 35% of husbands and 41% of wives reported that they intended to “get therapy” if 
their relationship were to become troubled, whereas only 26% of husbands and 25% of 
wives reported that they would talk to a “professional counselor.” Over the course of their 
marriage, 40% of husbands and 51% of wives considered seeking therapy at some point; 
27% of couples went on to actually receive therapy.

Couples who did and did not receive premarital education did not differ in ethnicity (t(429) 
= −1.47, p = .141). However, they did differ on household income (t(425) = −2.53, p = .012) 
and religiosity (husbands, t(429) = −6.15, p < .001; wives, t(429) = −6.96, p < .001), with 
couples who received premarital education reporting higher level of income and religiosity 
than couples who did not receive premarital education. Additionally, couples who did and 
did not receive premarital education did not differ in their likelihood of completing all five 
waves of assessment (χ2 = 1.127, p = .289).

Initial levels of relationship satisfaction (husbands: t(429) = 0.88, p = .092; wives: t(429) = 
−1.30, p = .916) and problem severity (husbands: t(429) = −0.08, p = .762; wives: t(429) = 
1.41, p = .982) did not differ between couples who did and did not receive premarital 
education.

Stage 1: Premarital Education and Awareness of Relationship Problems

Wives who received premarital education reported considering therapy at a higher level of 
relationship satisfaction (32.4 vs. 31.0; t(206) = −2.53, p = .012), and lower level of 
relationship problem severity (7.66 vs. 8.22; t(206) = 1.99, p = .047) than those who did not

receive premarital education. Husbands, however, considered seeking therapy at the same 
levels of relationship satisfaction (t(161) = −1.01, p = .313) and relationship problems 
(t(161) = 0.60, p = .553) regardless of whether or not they received premarital education.

Stage 2: Premarital Education and Intentions to Seek Help

Wives in couples who received premarital education were significantly more likely as 
newlyweds to say that they would seek therapy if their relationship was in trouble (χ2(1) = 
9.24, p = .002), but they were not more likely to say that they would talk to a professional 
counselor if their relationship was in trouble (wives: χ2(1) = 1.88, p = .171).

Husbands reported that they would seek therapy or talk to a professional counselor if their 
relationship was in trouble at the same rates, regardless of whether they received premarital 
education (χ2(1) = 0.53, p = .818 and χ2(1) = 0.38, p = .538, respectively).

Moreover, couples who received premarital education were not more likely to consider 
seeking therapy over the first 58 months of marriage (husbands: χ2(1) = 1.11, p = .291, 
wives: χ2(1) = 3.00, p = .083).

Stage 3: Premarital Education and Engagement in Later Help-seeking

Couples who received premarital education were significantly more likely to receive therapy 
than those who did not receive premarital education (36.3% vs 23.1%, χ2 = 8.22, p = .004), 
thus replicating the gateway effect (Williamson, Trail, Bradbury, & Karney, 2014) that forms 
the basis for this work.

The association between considering therapy and seeking therapy was also moderated by 
receipt of premarital education in the predicted manner: when spouses considered seeking 
therapy, they were more likely to actually do so if they had received premarital education, 
whereas if they had not received premarital education they were more likely to consider 
seeking therapy without actually following through (husbands: 61% versus 47%; χ2(1) = 
3.79, p = .03, wives: 54% versus 42%; χ2(1) = 3.31, p = .034).

Similarly, among couples who received therapy, those who also received premarital 
education sought therapy earlier than those who did not receive premarital education (wave 
3.3 [~16 months into marriage] vs. wave 3.9 [~22 months into marriage]); t(113) = 2.50, p 
= .014, d = .48). However, among couples who received therapy, those who did and did not 
receive premarital education did not differ in the level of relationship satisfaction (husbands: 
t(108) = −0.003, p = .998; wives: t(109) = −1.42, p = .157) or problem severity (husbands: 
t(108) = 0.746, p = .746; wives: t(109) = 1.84, p = .069) at which they sought therapy.

Discussion

Couples sometimes turn to couple therapy to improve their relationship, and those who 
participate in premarital education prior to marriage appear especially inclined to do so 
(Williamson, Trail, Bradbury, & Karney, 2014). We replicated this gateway effect, while also 
adopting Doss et al.’s (2003) three stage model in an effort to clarify how participation in 
premarital education might contribute to couples’ tendencies to consider, seek, and engage

in couple therapy. With longitudinal data collected from a relatively large sample of couples 
living in low-income communities, we demonstrate that premarital education participation 
covaried with the three stages in the help-seeking process. As we outline below, these 
findings allow us to highlight specific ways in which premarital education programs might 
be reconfigured to connect couples with couple therapies as they navigate the early, high-risk 
years of marriage.

Participation in premarital education was associated, first, with a tendency among wives to 
consider seeking therapy at higher levels of relationship satisfaction and lower levels of 
problem severity. This finding is broadly consistent with the view, outlined by Rogge and 
colleagues (2013), that premarital education may inadvertently sensitize participants to 
shortcomings in their relationship; the new information added here is that partners may be 
able to contemplate these shortcomings while the partnership is still relatively strong and see 
them as a catalyst for efforts to improve their relationship through outside help. This effect, 
if replicated, underscores the value of premarital education as not simply a gateway to later 
treatment but as an inducement to healthy relationship maintenance. As others have argued 
(e.g., Halford, Wilson, Lizzio, & Moore, 2002), a key element in healthy relationships may 
be an active and intentional willingness to maintain the relationship when it is going 
reasonably well (as distinct from a global desire for the relationship to persist; see Schoebi, 
Karney, & Bradbury, 2012), and premarital education modules might be developed to 
encourage this higher-order capacity.

We find mixed evidence for our second prediction, that participation in premarital education 
would covary with newlyweds’ intentions to seek treatment or with their subsequent reports 
of considering treatment. Wives in couples who received premarital education were more 
likely to say that they would seek therapy, but were not more likely to say that they would 
talk to a professional counselor (while husbands were no more likely to endorse either). This 
suggests that wives may define “therapy” to include more than just couple therapy delivered 
by a professional therapist/counselor, and instead may be seeking counsel from others, such 
as clergy. This latter possibility is supported by the finding that wives who received 
premarital education reported a higher level of religiosity than those who did not, suggesting 
that these couples may have received the premarital education in a religious setting and 
intend to return to that setting for further counseling if necessary. However, husbands who 
received premarital education also reported higher levels of religiosity, but were no more 
likely to say that they would seek therapy for their relationship, suggesting that perhaps they 
did not see this as a source for future therapy. These are only speculations at this point, as 
the current study was unable to ascertain the source or type of counseling that couples 
engaged in. This leaves open the possibility that couples were receiving something other 
than couple therapy delivered by a therapist, including counseling delivered by a clergy 
member. Future investigations are needed to determine what types of counseling couples are 
engaging in, and the effectiveness of these naturally occurring interventions. We suggest that 
providing couples with information on how to be critical consumers of relationship 
interventions could be a foundational element in premarital education, capitalizing on 
premarital education’s ability to facilitate later help-seeking, and steering couples toward 
resources most likely to be helpful to them.

Finally, we demonstrate that participation in premarital education is associated with a greater 
likelihood that couples who had considered seeking treatment would actually follow through 
to receive it, and would receive it slightly earlier in their relationship, compared to those 
who did not participate in premarital education. Thus, whereas premarital education may not 
facilitate consideration of help-seeking directly, experience with premarital education 
appears to combine with a willingness on the part of couples to consider treatment and 
thereby convert intentions into actions. This too suggests an elaboration of the gateway 
effect, in that premarital education may have little bearing on actual treatment uptake if 
couples see little need for it; however, premarital education may become consequential 
among those who are beginning to wonder about whether an intervention could help them. 
Whether couples who have participated in premarital education have more information about 
who to contact for treatment, or experience less anxiety and discomfort when doing so, 
cannot be determined from this study. Future investigations into the mechanism through 
which premarital education helps convert help-seeking intention into action are warranted, 
as this is a promising area for increasing uptake of couple interventions more broadly.

Results of the current study highlight a possible gender difference in how premarital 
education is experienced. On individual-level variables, including consideration of therapy 
and intentions to seek therapy, associations were found only for wives, whereas participation 
in premarital education was not associated with an increase in any individual-level help-
seeking variable for husbands. Husbands, however, did experience an increased likelihood of 
participating in relationship counseling after receiving premarital education, but given that 
decisions to pursue relationship counseling are typically dyadic in nature, this effect might 
be driven primarily by their wives (as women are more likely to be the partner who initiates 
therapy; see Doss, Atkins, & Christensen, 2003). Additionally, although husbands did not 
experience an increase in consideration of relationship counseling after attending premarital 
education, the link between premarital education and relationship counseling was moderated 
by husbands’ consideration of therapy. Thus, when wives reach the point at which they have 
decided to initiate therapy, their request may be most effective if their husbands have not 
only thought that they may need help for their relationship, but have also had prior 
experience with a relationship intervention.

Several factors affect interpretation of these results. While collecting data from ethnically 
diverse, first-married, newlywed couples living in low-income communities is a strength of 
the study, it also limits our ability to generalize our findings to other populations, including 
established, unmarried, remarried, and same-sex couples. Additionally, the measure of 
relationship satisfaction used in the current study has not been used in other samples, 
limiting our ability to compare this sample to others in the literature.

Second, our assessment of premarital education and relationship counseling was crude as it 
provided no information about the content of those programs or the setting in which they 
were delivered; thus we have measured all types of naturally occurring premarital education 
that couples may access in the community. Additionally, because we used a correlational 
rather than an experimental design, all results should be interpreted with caution. Couples 
were not randomized and therefore may have self-selected into premarital education because 
of their desire for a relationship intervention, or may have been required to attend by their

religious organization. Couples who self-select into premarital education may differ from 
couples who choose not to attend on a number of dimensions, including increased comfort 
with help-seeking in general, prior positive experience with psychological interventions, and 
being more psychologically-minded. Future investigations into factors that predict 
participation in various types of premarital education and couples therapy, along with 
experimental studies of premarital education, will help determine how much these factors 
may be playing a role in the link between various types of relationship help-seeking.

Third, the present study’s reliance on self-report data might bias the findings we obtained as 
couples might not have remembered or reported correctly whether they received premarital 
education or therapy or whether they had considered seeking help over a given wave of the 
study. More frequent assessments could more accurately capture thoughts about help-
seeking, including fluctuations in these thoughts and behaviors that may have occurred 
during the nine months between assessments.

Finally, the current data do not allow us to tease apart the reasons that may underlie the 
effects and non-effects of premarital education on the three help-seeking stages. Possible 
reasons include increased comfort with help-seeking, increased belief that outside 
intervention could be helpful to their relationship, and increased awareness of how to go 
about seeking help. Future research may aim to clarify why couples who received premarital 
education may be more likely to seek therapy.

Notwithstanding these limitations, the present study lends confidence to the gateway effect 
and adds new perspective on how premarital education may and may not promote later help-
seeking and relationship well-being. While premarital education is certainly a heterogeneous 
enterprise, these results, together with the replicated finding that premarital education is 
associated with increases in later help-seeking, suggest that increasing access to premarital 
education and further increasing these programs’ focus on maintaining the relationship in 
the future may serve to empower more couples to identify problems in their relationships 
and seek help for them before it is too late.
