Summary

Background—Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat. New treatments, clinical trials and standards 
of quality for assessing evidence justify an update of evidence-based recommendations for its 
pharmacological treatment.

Methods—The Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) of the International 
Association for the Study of Pain conducted a systematic review of randomised double-blind 
studies of oral and topical pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain, including unpublished trials 
(retrieved from clinicaltrials.gov and pharmaceutical websites). Meta-analysis used Numbers 
Needed to Treat (NNT) for 50 % pain relief as primary measure and assessed publication bias. 
Recommendations used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE).

Findings—In total 229 studies were included. Analysis of publication bias suggested a 10% 
overstatement of treatment effects. Studies published in peer-review journals reported greater 
effects than online studies (R2=9·3%, p<0·01). Trial outcomes were generally modest even for 
effective drugs : in particular NNTs were 3·6 (95 % CI 3·0–4·4) for tricyclic antidepressants 
(TCAs), 6·4 (95 % CI 5·2–8·4) for serotonin- noradrenaline reuptake inbibitor (SNRI) 
antidepressants duloxetine and venlafaxine, 7·7 (95 % CI 6·5–9·4) for pregabalin and 6·3 (95 % CI 
5·0–8·3) for gabapentin. NNTs were higher for gabapentin ER/enacarbil and capsaicin high 
concentration patches, lower for opioids and botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) and undetermined for 
lidocaine patches. Final quality of evidence was lower for lidocaine patches and BTX-A. 
Tolerability/safety and values/preferences were high for lidocaine patches and lower for opioids 
and TCAs. This permitted a strong GRADE recommendation for use and proposal as first line for 
TCAs, SNRIs, pregabalin, gabapentin and gabapentin ER/enacarbil in neuropathic pain, a weak 
recommendation for use and proposal as second line for lidocaine patches, capsaicin patches and 
tramadol, and a weak recommendations for use and proposal as third line for strong opioids 
(particularly oxycodone and morphine) and BTX-A. Data for cannabinoids, tapentadol, drug 
combinations, and several other antiepileptics, antidepressants and topical drugs were 
inconclusive.

Interpretation—Limited efficacy, large placebo responses, inadequate diagnostic criteria and 
poor phenotypic profiling probably account for modest trial outcomes and should be taken into 
account in future studies.

Funding—This study was funded by NeuPSIG.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain, caused by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous 
system,1 has a considerable impact on patients’ quality of life, and is associated with a high 
economic burden on the individual and society.2–4 It is now considered as a distinct clinical 
entity despite a large variety of aetiologies.5

Epidemiological surveys have shown that many patients with neuropathic pain do not 
receive appropriate treatment for their pain.2,6,7 This may be due to lack of diagnostic 
accuracy and relatively ineffective drugs, but also insufficient knowledge about effective 
drugs and their appropriate use in clinical practice.8 Evidence-based recommendations for 
the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain are therefore essential.

Over the past 10 years, a few recommendations have been proposed for pharmacotherapy of 
neuropathic pain9–11 or specific neuropathic pain conditions, such as painful diabetic 
neuropathies and postherpetic neuralgia.12–14 In the interim, new pharmacological therapies 
and high-quality clinical trials have appeared. Previously hidden and unpublished large trials 
can now be identified on the web (clinicaltrials.gov, pharmaceutical industry websites), 
which, together with analysis of publication bias, may limit the risk of bias in reporting data.

Methods

Procedures

Furthermore, prior recommendations sometimes came to discrepant conclusions because of 
inconsistencies in methods used to assess the quality of evidence (eg,13,15,16). In order to 
address these inconsistencies, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, 
and Evaluation (GRADE) was introduced in 200017,18 and has received widespread 
international acceptance. All these reasons justify an update of evidence-based 
recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain.

The present work aimed to update the recommendations of the Special Interest Group on 
Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) 
(www.neupsig.org) on the systemic and topical pharmacological treatments of neuropathic 
pain.19 Non-pharmacological management such as neurostimulation techniques were 
beyond the scope of this work (see20 for a recent systematic review) We conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of all drug 
treatments for neuropathic pain published since 1966 and of unpublished trials with 
available results, and assessed publication bias. We used GRADE to rate the quality of 
evidence and the strength of recommendations.17,18

The preparation of this article was conducted under the auspices of NeuPSIG. We followed 
the 23-item Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Avaluation (AGREE II) Instrument 
for developing and reporting recommendations.21 Details of the working group, criteria for 
eligibility, search methods, reporting and statistical analysis are found in appendix 1.

The systematic review of the literature compiled with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements.22 We used a standardized 
review and data extraction protocol (unpublished, appendices 2 and 3). The full reports of 
randomised, controlled, double-blind studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 
1966 and April 2013 were identified using searches of PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase. Additional papers were identified from 
published reviews and the reference lists of selected papers.

The target population was patients of any age with neuropathic pain according to the IASP 
definition (ie, pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system),1; 
this included postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic and non-diabetic painful polyneuropathy, 
postamputation pain, post-traumatic/postsurgical neuropathic pain including plexus avulsion 
and complex regional pain syndrome type II (the latter was generally subsumed into post-
traumatic/post-surgical neuropathic pain), central post-stroke pain, spinal cord injury pain, 
multiple sclerosis-associated pain. Neuropathic pains pertaining to multiple aetiologies were 
also considered. Neuropathic pain associated with nociceptive components (eg, cancer 
neuropathic pain and radiculopathy) was included provided that the primary outcome was 
neuropathic pain. Conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome type I, low back pain 
without radicular pain, fibromyalgia, and atypical facial pain were not included because they 
do not fulfill the current definition of neuropathic pain.1 Trigeminal neuralgia was 
considered separately because of generally distinct response to drug treatment.10,23

The interventions were systemic or topical treatments (oral, sublingual, oropharyngeal, 
intranasal, topical, subcutaneous, intradermal, and smoking) with at least 3 weeks duration 
of treatment. Single-administration treatments with long-term efficacy (high-concentration 
capsaicin patches and botulinum toxin) were included if there was a minimum follow-up of 
3 weeks. Studies using intramuscular, intravenous, or neuraxial routes of administration and 
preemptive analgesia studies were excluded (see review20).

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with parallel group or crossover study 
designs that had at least 10 patients per arm were included. Enriched-enrolment, randomised 
withdrawal trials were summarised separately. Studies published only as abstracts were 
excluded. Double-blind active comparator trials of drugs generally proposed as first or 
second-line treatments24 were included. The study outcome (positive, negative) was based 
on the effect on the primary outcome measure, e.g. neuropathic pain intensity. Studies in 
which the primary outcome included a composite score of pain and paraesthesia or 
paraesthesia only were not included.

Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the five-point Oxford Quality 
Scale25 by two independent authors (appendix 1). Here, a minimum score of 2 out of 5 
(randomised and double-blind study) was required for inclusion.25 We also assessed serious 
risk of bias relating to lack of allocation concealment, incomplete accounting of outcome 
events, selective outcome reporting, stopping early for benefit, use of invalidated outcome 
measures and carryover effects in crossover trials.

Evidence summary and reporting

The GRADE classification was used to assess recommendations based on a group of RCTs 
pertaining to the same drug or drug class when relevant (ie TCAs)17,18 with final quality of 
evidence rated as strong or weak for the treatment, against the treatment, or inconclusive 
(the last category was added due to the large number of inconsistent results in RCTs). We 
did not conduct a new health economic analysis of costs,16 but estimated three levels of 
relative drug costs in various countries in relation to the average price (for oral drugs) for 
each country using price data for the daily dose as defined by WHO (appendix 1). The 
average of these percentages across countries was calculated, and the cost was rated as low 
if <67%, moderate if 67–300%, and high if >300% than the average.

Statistics

NNT for 50% pain intensity reduction (alternatively, 30% pain reduction or at least 
moderate pain relief) was the primary effect measure, and NNH was calculated as the 
number of patients that needed to be treated for one patient to drop out due to adverse 
effects. The 95% CI for NNT and NNH values was calculated as the reciprocal value of the 
95% CI for the absolute risk difference using the normal approximation. In dose-finding 
studies, data from subgroups treated with low doses (eg, pregabalin 150 mg) were not 
included in the meta-analysis. Difference in pain intensity was a secondary outcome. Serious 
and common (>10% incidence) reported adverse events were also recorded in the data 
extraction form (appendix 3).

An assessment of publication bias was performed using funnel plots,26 Egger’s regression,27 
and Duval and Tweedie’s non-parametric trim and fill approach.28 (appendix 1). 
Additionally, we estimated the susceptibility to bias for individual drug classes.29,30 The 
extent to which the observed variability (heterogeneity) in treatment effects is explained by 
publication in a peer-reviewed journal was assessed using meta-regression. Heterogeneity 
among trials was presented as a L’Abbé plot31 and with the use of the I2 statistic.

Results

Study selection and characteristics

The results of the database and registry search are shown in figure 1. In total, 191 published 
articles and 21 unpublished studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Study 
characteristics are summarised in appendices 4 and 5. In addition, five published and 12 
unpublished studies were retrieved between April 2013 and January 2014 (appendix 6). 
Thus, a total of 229 articles/studies were included. References are presented in appendix 7.

Eligible studies investigated tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin- noradrenaline 
reuptake inbibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, other antidepressants, pregabalin, gabapentin/
gabapentin extended release (ER) and enacarbil, other antiepileptics, tramadol, opioids, 
cannabinoids, lidocaine 5% patch, capsaicin 8% patch and cream, subcutaneous BTX-A, 
NMDA antagonists, mexiletine, miscellaneous topical, newer systemic drugs, and 
combination therapies. Fifty-five percent of the trials were conducted in diabetic painful 
polyneuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia. NNT and NNH could be calculated in 77% of 
published placebo-controlled trials.

Risk of bias in individual trials

The average Oxford quality scores for individual trials is presented in appendix 4. The mean 
score was 4·1 (SD 0·87, range 2–5). It was lower (average 3–4) for older studies of TCAs 
and capsaicin and higher (average >4) for more recent studies (pregabalin, gabapentin, 
SNRIs, opioids, capsaicin high-concentration patches). Detailed descriptions of study 
limitations of individual studies are available from the corresponding author per request.

Risk of bias across studies

Heterogeneity—Heterogeneity assessed with the I2 statistic is presented in figure 2 and 
appendix 8 and L’Abbé plot is presented in appendix 9. Heterogeneity, particularly 
heterogeneity that was not easily explained by differences in drug dose, diagnosis, and size 
of placebo response, was included in the GRADE recommendation.

Publication bias—A total of 165 published or unpublished trials with dichotomous data 
were analysed for publication bias. Visual inspection of the funnel plot (figure 3a) showed 
asymmetry, which was confirmed by Egger’s regression test (figure 3b). The trim and fill 
method suggested 34 theoretical missing studies (figure 3c) and adjusted our effect size from 
an OR of 1·8 (95% CI 1·7–1·9) to 1·6 (95% CI 1·5–1·7). This suggests a 10% relative 
overstatement of treatment effects. The analysis of susceptibility for publication bias 
amongst individual drug classes is summarised in table 1. Only the estimated effect size of

capsaicin 8% patches demonstrated susceptibility to change to a clinical non-significant 
effect if studies with no effect were published. Using meta-regression, we identified that 
studies published in peer-review journals reported greater treatment effects (OR=2·2, 95% 
CI 1·5–3·0, n=153; adjusted R2=9·3%, p<0·01) than studies identified via online repositories 
(OR=1·4, 1·0–1·9, n=17).

Quantitative data for individual drugs or drug classes

Results of individual and combined NNT and NNH values for placebo-controlled studies are 
presented in appendix 4, other studies in appendices 5 and 6 and quality of evidence in 
appendix 10. Forest plots showing NNTs for all drug classes are presented in figure 2 or 
appendix 8. Risk differences, calculated using fixed effect and random effects models, are 
presented in appendix 8. There was no evidence showing different efficacy of most drugs in 
distinct neuropathic pain conditions, except otherwise specified. Long-term controlled 
studies were lacking and few lasted longer than 12 weeks, with the longest lasting 24 weeks.

TCA and SNRI antidepressants—In 18 placebo-controlled trials (20 comparisons with 
placebo of which seven used active placebos), evaluating mainly amitriptyline (25–150 mg/
day), 16 were positive. The final quality of evidence was moderate (appendix 10). There was 
no evidence for a dose-response effect. Combined NNT (15 studies) was 3·6 (3·0–4·4) and 
NNH was 13·4 (9·3–24·4).

We identified 14 studies of SNRI antidepressants with results including notably nine with 
duloxetine (20–120 mg, seven positive) and four with venlafaxine (two positive, dosages 
150–225 mg daily, two negative but with low dosages). The final quality of evidence was 
high. Combined NNT was 6·4 (5·2–8·4) and NNH was 11·8 (9·5–15·2).

Antiepileptics—A total of 18 out of 25 placebo-controlled RCTs of pregabalin (150–600 
mg/day) were positive, with high final quality of evidence. There was a dose response 
gradient (higher response with 600 mg daily than 300 mg). Two trials of HIV-related painful 
polyneuropathy with high placebo responses (34 to 43% had 50% pain relief with placebo) 
were negative. Combined NNT was 7·7 (6·5–9·4) and NNH was 13·9 (11·6–17·4).

We identified 14 RCTs of gabapentin (900–3600 mg/day) (nine positive) and 6 RCTs of 
gabapentin ER or gabapentin enacarbil (1200–3600 mg/day) (four positive). Combined NNT 
was 6·3 (5·0–8·3) for gabapentin and 8·3 (6·2–13) for gabapentin ER/enacarbil. There was 
no evidence for a dose-response effect. Safety was good (NNH 25·6 (15·3–78·6) for 
gabapentin and 31·9 (17·1–230) for gabapentin ER).

Most studies using other antiepileptic drugs were negative. Topiramate, zonisamide, and 
oxcarbazepine/carbamazepine had the poorest safety profile, with combined NNH of 6·3 
(5·1–8·0), 2·0 (1·3–4·6), and 5·5 (4·3–7·9), respectively.

Opioids—Tramadol is a weak opioid agonist and a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake 
inhibitor. All seven studies of tramadol (mainly tramadol ER up to 400 mg daily) were 
positive, with moderate final quality of evidence. Combined NNT was 4·7 (3·6–6·7), with 
the highest NNT (6·4) in the largest study. Combined NNH was 12·6 (8·4–25·3). Tapentadol

is an opioid with noradrenaline reuptake inhibition, with low affinity for the mu opioid 
receptor. We identified one negative study and one positive enrichment study of tapentadol 
ER: the latter had potential bias (probable unblinding of the patients enrolled in the double 
blind period) and high NNT (in 67 % of the patients responding to the open phase).

We identified 13 trials of strong opioids using mainly oxycodone (10–120 mg/day) and 
morphine (90–240mg/day) in peripheral neuropathic pain. The final quality of evidence was 
moderate. Ten trials were positive: combined NNT was 4·3 (3·4–5·8) and NNH was 11·7 
(8·4–19·3). Maximum effectiveness seemed associated with 180 mg morphine or equivalent 
(no additional benefit for higher doses).

Oromucosal cannabinoids—Sativex is an oromucosally delivered spray prepared from 
extracts of the plant cannabis sativa with several active constituents (principally 
standardised 27 mg/ml delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and 25 mg/ml cannabidiol). We 
identified nine trials of Sativex in neuropathic pain, of which only two were positive. Of 2 
studies in pain associated with multiple sclerosis, one was positive, while the larger one had 
a negative primary outcome.

Topical lidocaine—Based our inclusion criteria (at least 3 weeks’ duration), we identified 
only one small negative study of 5% lidocaine patches in postsurgical neuropathic pain and 
two enriched enrolment studies in postherpetic neuralgia. The smaller study (32 patients) 
was positive, the larger study (263 patients) was negative in the ITT population, but positive 
in the per protocol population. Of note, studies of less than 3 weeks’ duration found efficacy 
of 5% lidocaine patch.24 Safety and tolerability were excellent in all cases.

Capsaicin high-concentration patches—Five out of seven studies (in postherpetic 
neuralgia or HIV-related painful polyneuropathy) reported sustained efficacy of a single 
application of high-concentration capsaicin patch (8%) (better results for 60 minutes 
application in postherpetic neuralgia and 30 minutes in HIV neuropathy) compared with a 
low-concentration patch (0·04%) (aiming to minimize the risk of unblinding related to the 
burning sensation of capsaicin). The final quality of evidence was high. Combined NNT was 
10·6 (7·4–19). Results on secondary outcomes were inconsistent.

Botulinum toxin type A—Six RCTs evaluated the efficacy of a single administration of 
BTX-A (50–200 units subcutaneously in the painful area) in peripheral neuropathic pain. 
The smaller studies had a positive primary outcome (NNT of 1·9 (1·5–2·4) for four studies) 
with a very low placebo effect, but one large unpublished study was negative. Safety was 
generally excellent.

Miscellaneous—Results concerning other drugs (SSRI antidepressants, capsaicin cream, 
NMDA antagonists, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, mexiletine, and newer topical or oral drugs), 
are in appendix 4. There were no RCTs with conventional nonopioid analgesics (NSAIDs, 
acetaminophen).

Combination therapy

Page 9

Of seven RCTs of various combination therapy in neuropathic pain (appendices 4 and 6), 
two found that gabapentin combined to morphine or to nortriptyline was superior to 
monotherapy (and to placebo in one study) at reduced dosages and with no more side 
effects. However the largest study (not placebo controlled) showed no difference in efficacy 
or side effects between pregabalin combined to duloxetine at moderate dosages (300 mg 
pregabalin, 60 mg duloxetine daily) and monotherapy at high dosages (600 mg pregabalin, 
120 mg duloxetine daily) in patients not responsive to monotherapy at moderate dosages.

Comparative drug trials

We identified seven comparative RCTs without placebo groups (appendices 4, 5). Neither 
individual studies nor their statistical combination demonstrated significant differences in 
efficacy or safety between drugs. Despite limited sample sizes and unknown assay 
sensitivity in the lack of placebo groups, results suggest comparable efficacy across first- 
and most second-line recommended treatments.

GRADE recommendations

There was generally no evidence for efficacy of particular drugs in specific conditions. 
Therefore these recommendations apply to neuropathic pain in general. However, they may 
not be applicable for trigeminal neuralgia, for which we could extract only one study 
complying with our inclusion criteria. We therefore recommend referring to previous 
specific guidelines regarding this condition.10,23 Few studies included cancer-related 
neuropathic pain; the recommendations for the use of opioids may be different in certain 
cancer populations. Similarly these recommendations do not apply to acute pain or acute 
pain exacerbation. Treatment of neuropathic pain in children is a neglected area.32 However, 
none of the studies assessed pediatric neuropathic pain, and the present guidelines therefore 
only apply to adults.

Details regarding GRADE recommendations and practical use are provided in tables 2, 3 
and appendix 10. Few relevant trials appeared since our meta-analysis, but none affected the 
recommendations (appendix 11). TCAs, SNRI antidepressants duloxetine and venlafaxine, 
pregabalin, gabapentin and gabapentin ER/enacarbil have strong GRADE recommendations 
for use in neuropathic pain and are proposed as first-line, with caution regarding most TCAs 
(Table 2). Tramadol, lidocaine patches and high-concentration capsaicin patches have weak 
GRADE recommendations for use and are proposed as generally second-line. Topical 
treatments are recommended for peripheral neuropathic pain with presumed local pain 
generator. In select circumstances, e.g when there are concerns due to side effects or safety 
of first-line treatments, particularly in frail and elderly patients, lidocaine patches may be 
considered as first-line.

Strong opioids (particularly oxycodone and morphine) and BTX-A (specialist use for 
peripheral neuropathic pain and presumed local pain generator) have weak GRADE 
recommendations for use and are recommended as third-line. Prescription of opioids should 
be strictly monitored particularly for patients requiring high dosages (including tracking the 
dose in morphine equivalence, use of risk assessment tools and treatment agreements).38,39

Tapentadol, other antiepileptics, capsaicin cream, topical clonidine, SSRI antidepressants, 
NMDA antagonists and combination therapy40–42 have inconclusive GRADE 
recommendations. Combination of pregabalin/gabapentin and duloxetine/TCAs may be 
considered as an alternative to increasing dosages in monotherapy for patients unresponsive 
to monotherapy with moderate dosages (appendix 10 for details).

Cannabinoids and valproate have weak recommendations against their use in neuropathic 
pain and levetiracetam and mexiletine have strong recommendations against their use 
(appendix 10 for details).

Discussion

The present manuscript presents the revised NeuPSIG recommendations for the 
pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain based on an updated systematic review and meta-
analysis of systemic or topical drug treatments. We used the GRADE system17,18 to assess 
the quality of evidence for all treatments, and the recommendations comply with the 
AGREE II guidelines.

The present recommendations are driven by drug treatments rather than by the aetiology of 
pain, akin to prior NeuPSIG recommendations.19 Neuropathic pain is increasingly 
recognised as a specific multiaetiology entity across neuropathic syndromes.43 In 
accordance with previous reports24 results of our meta-analysis show that the efficacy of 
systemic drug treatments is generally not dependent on the aetiology of the underlying 
disorder (appendix 4). Side effects may, however, to some degree depend on the aetiology, 
eg, drugs with CNS-related side effects may be less tolerated in patients with CNS lesions.44 
Pain due to HIV-related painful polyneuropathy and radiculopathy seems more refractory 
than other pain conditions in our meta-analysis. This may be due to large placebo responses 
in HIV-related neuropathy trials,45 a distinct clinical phenotype in subgroups of patients 
with radiculopathy,46 or psychological/psychosocial comorbidites, often neglected in large 
trials. Topical agents have no known relevance for use in central neuropathic pain, and this 
is clearly stated in our recommendations.

The strengths of this systematic review and meta-analysis are the analysis of publication 
bias29 and unpublished trials. Publication bias may be present if studies with positive results 
are published while those with no data or negative results are not.29 It may lead to major 
overestimation of efficacy in therapeutic studies.47 Our results showed that the effect sizes 
estimated from studies published in peer-reviewed journals were higher than those estimated 
from studies available in open databases. This finding emphasises the need for searching 
these databases in systematic reviews. Analysis of further publication bias (analysis of 
studies that are neither published nor reported with results in open trial registries) suggested 
a limited overstatement of overall efficacy of drug treatments (by 10%), although available 
methods to assess publication bias have limitations.48 Here, we found that high-
concentration capsaicin patches were the most susceptible to publication bias, ie, a new 
study with less than 400 participants with no effect may increase the NNT to an 
unacceptable level. This supports the robustness of a meta-analysis taking into account

unpublished trials, and suggests that effect sizes were overestimated in previous meta-
analyses of pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain.

Results of quantitative data for individual drugs, showing NNT for 50 % pain relief ranging 
from around 4 to 10 across most positive trials, emphasizes the overall modest study 
outcomes in neuropathic pain. Inadequate response of neuropathic pain to drug therapy 
constitutes a highly unmet need and may have substantial consequences in terms of 
psychological or social adjustment.49 However these results may also reflect insuffficient 
assay sensitivity of clinical trials of neuropathic pain50 (Table 4). One major issue is the 
placebo response which seems to have increased in recent trials of neuropathic pain and may 
lead to an underestimation of drug effects.51 Placebo response has been found to be higher 
in HIV-related neuropathies,45 and in patients with low or variable pain scores at 
inclusion.52 Conversely it seems to be lower in postherpetic neuralgia.45 Another issue 
concerns the lack of adequate diagnostic criteria for neuropathic pain (available on request 
for individual trials). The use of diagnostic algorithms for neuropathic pain53 and screening 
tools54 should contribute to reducing diagnostic heterogeneity (Table 4). Lastly, a largely 
debated issue concerns the heterogeneity of patient phenotypes in clinical trials, which may 
reflect various underlying mechanisms.55–57 Interestingly, the results of a number of very 
recent trials or posthoc analyses of recent trials suggest that some drugs might be 
differentially effective in patients classified based on their sensory phenotypes.58–60

Our updated therapeutic algorithm for neuropathic pain based on GRADE differs in many 
ways from prior therapeutic recommendations. The latter generally proposed TCAs, 
pregabalin, gabapentin and lidocaine patches as first line for neuropathic pain9–13,15–16,19,61. 
We now also propose gabapentin ER/enacarbil, duloxetine and venlafaxine as first line 
based on strong GRADE recommendation for use. We no longer recommend lidocaine 
patches as first line because of weak final quality of evidence. However, owing to an 
excellent safety profile, high values and preferences, paucity of alternative well tolerated 
and safe medications, short term positive studies, we propose a weak GRADE 
recommendation for use as generally second line for peripheral neuropathic pain. Strong 
opioids are now recommended as third line, contrasting with several prior recommendations 
in which they were generally considered as first or second line17,61 This mainly stems from 
the consideration of potential risk of abuse, particularly with high doses35 and concerns 
about a recent increase in prescription opioid-associated overdose mortality, diversion, 
misuse and other opioid-related morbidity particularly in USA, Canada and UK.62–64 High-
concentration capsaicin patches and cannabinoids are considered for the first time in 
therapeutic recommendations for neuropathic pain. Capsaicin patches are proposed as 
second-line for peripheral neuropathic pain because of high quality of evidence, but modest 
effect size, training requirements, and potential safety concerns on sensation with long-term 
use.65 We provide a weak recommendation against the use of cannabinoids in neuropathic 
pain, mainly because of negative results, potential misuse, abuse, diversion and long term 
mental health risks particularly in susceptible individuals.66–71

One important issue when proposing recommendations is to assess to what extent they are 
applied by practitioners and whether this may contribute to improving their practice. Few 
studies have investigated the real-life impact of evidence-based recommendations on

physicians’ practices. It has recently been reported that the drug treatment of postherpetic 
neuralgia by primary care physicians was roughly consistent with the US recommendations 
issued some years before.6 In contrast, a recent large study of general practitioners’ 
adherence to current French recommendations observed a paucity of appropriate recall of 
first-line drugs.8 One important educational objective of the present guidelines will be to 
facilitate their dissemination and subsequently assess their real life implementation in 
various countries.7

Figure 2. Forest plot for data included in meta-analysis
Numbers needed to treat (NNTs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown for each 
trial and for the overall estimate (fixed effects, Mantel-Haenszel) for first-line drugs. The 
size of the squares represents the Mantel-Haenszel weight that the corresponding study 
exerts in the meta-analysis. The full line indicates an NNT of ∞ corresponding to an 
absolute risk difference of 0, ie. no effect. Numbers to the right of the line indicate effect 
and numbers to the left harm. The dotted line represents the overall estimate.
2a) TCAs=Tricyclic antidepressants. 2b) SNRIs=serotonin noradrenaline reuptake 
inhibitors. 2c) Pregabalin. 2d) Gabapentin including gabapentin ER and Enacarbil.
MS=multiple sclerosis pain. PHN=postherpetic neuralgia. PNI=peripheral nerve injury. 
RADIC=painful radiculopathy. SCI=spinal cord injury pain. CPSP=Central poststroke pain. 
PPN=painful polyneuropathy.

Figure 3. Evidence of publication (reporting) bias
(a) Funnel plot showing the precision (inverse of the standard error) against the effect size; 
in the absence of bias the points should resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel, (b) Egger’s 
regression showing the precision plotted against the standardised effect size, the 95% 
confidence intervals of the regression line do not include the origin suggesting funnel plot 
asymmetry, and (c) Funnel plot showing the additional missing studies imputed by trim-and-
fill in red. The red vertical line indicates the possible summary if the theoretical missing 
studies were to be included.

Abbreviations: SNRIs=serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. TCAs=tricyclic antidepressants. ER= extended realease; BID : twice daily; 
QD : once daily. PNP=peripheral neuropathic pain.

1

TCAs generally have similar efficacy (appendix 4). Tertiary amine TCAs (amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine) are not recommended at 
dosages > 75 mg/day in older adults because of their major anticholinergic and sedative side effects and potential risk of falls.33 An increased risk 
of sudden cardiac death has been reported for doses > 100 mg daily.34

2

The long-term safety of repeated applications of high concentration capsaicin patches in patients has not been clearly established particularly with 

respect to degeneration of epidermal nerve fibres, which may be a concern in progressive neuropathy.

3

Sustained release oxycodone and morphine have been the most studied with maximal daily dosages of 120 mg and 240 mg respectively in clinical 
trials (appendix 4). Long-term opioid use may be associated with abuse particularly at high doses, cognitive impairment and endocrine and 
immunologic changes.35–37

Table 4

Limitations of current clinical trials in neuropathic pain as outlined by the present meta-analysis and 
systematic review, and NeuPSIG recommendations for implementation of future clinical trials in neuropathic 
pain

Issues raised by current drug clinical trials in neuropathic pain

NeuPSIG recommendation for future trials in neuropathic pain

1/Patients population

All RCTs have been conducted in adults

Conduct more studies in peadiatric population

Lack of validated diagnostic tools/algorithms for neuropathic pain

Classification of patients is generally based on aetiology

2/ Characteristics of the trials

Use IASP diagnostic criteria for probable or definite neuropathic pain 
and validated screening tools to confirm diagnosis1

Classification should be based on sensory phenotypes rather than merely 
on aetiology2

Trial duration is 12 weeks or less in 81 % of the trials

Consider longer trial duration

High placebo response particularly in recent trials

Exclude patients with low pain intensity and high variability of pain at 
baseline45

Abbreviation: RCTs: randomized clinical trials

1

Criteria for neuropathic pain diagnosis were not available before the development of screening tools and of diagnostic algorithms for NP 
(2008).46,47 However less than 10 % of clinical trials conducted over the past decade have used screening tools or diagnostic algorithms for NP.

2

This recommendation tends to be confirmed by very recent clinical trials52,53 or posthoc analyses of recent clinical trials51 that could not be 
considered in the present meta-analysis. Some trials suggested in particular that drugs such as oxcarbazepine or topical clonidine may be 
significantly more effective in subgroups of patients with preserved nociceptive function as compared to those without such phenotype52, 53 
However these individual trials need to be replicated and do not change the current level of recommendation for these drug treatments.
