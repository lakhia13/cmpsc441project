Abstract

Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder) are a 
heterogeneous class of complex illnesses marked by weight and appetite dysregulation coupled 
with distinctive behavioral and psychological features. Our understanding of their genetics 
and neurobiology is evolving thanks to global cooperation on genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS), neuroimaging, and animal models. Until now, however, these approaches have advanced 
the field in parallel, with inadequate crosstalk. This review covers overlapping advances in these

key domains and encourages greater integration of hypotheses and findings to create a more 
unified science of eating disorders. We highlight ongoing and future work designed to identify 
implicated biological pathways that will inform staging models based on biology as well as 
targeted prevention and tailored intervention and galvanize interest in developing pharmacologic 
agents that target the core biology of the illnesses for which we currently have few effective 
pharmacotherapeutics.

Eating disorders are severe psychiatric disorders that, for many, evolve into chronic or 
fluctuating conditions with serious adverse outcomes1. Among adolescents and young 
adults, the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia 
nervosa (BN) are among the highest of all psychiatric disorders2. Binge-eating disorder 
(BED) and other specified feeding and eating disorders have yet to be included in estimates, 
but are projected to account for the majority of global disease burden of eating disorders3. 
Although the disorders occur in pure forms, although diagnostic crossover across the course 
of illness is common4. For a brief definition of the symptoms and epidemiology of the three 
primary eating disorders, see Box 1.

Biological effects within eating disorders range from the subcellular (genetic variants 
and their effects on gene expression and structure), through the cellular (signaling) and 
intercellular (neurons and neuronal circuits), to organismal effects (eating disorders and 
disorder-related behaviors)5. These levels of biology are interconnected, but are investigated 
using different scientific approaches, with limited crosstalk to date. Integrating results from 
different approaches is vital. A hierarchically connected research approach, reflecting the 
biological interconnectivity, will provide a more complete understanding of the biology of 
eating disorders, providing the foundations for developing much-needed novel treatments. In 
this review, we describe the state of the science across biological levels and approaches and 
conclude by discussing progress towards this more integrated understanding.

Human Genetics of Eating Disorders

Twin-based heritability.

Large-scale twin studies yield heritability estimates ranging from 0.28 to 0.74 for AN6, 
with imprecision reflecting varying definitions of illness and sample size, with more severe 
definitions associated with higher heritabilities7. Heritability estimates range from 0.55 to 
0.626 for BN and 0.39 to 0.45 for BED6.

GWAS.

Candidate gene and linkage literature in eating disorders was rife with unreplicated small-
sample studies and was minimally informative beyond signaling the likely complexity of 
their genetics6. We take as a starting point the most recent genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) of AN performed by the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric

Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED)8. Combining existing samples9 with the Anorexia 
Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)10 yielded a European ancestry dataset including 16,992 
AN cases and 55,525 controls, from 17 countries, and identified 8 genome-wide significant 
loci, including 4 single-gene loci: CADM1, MGMT, FOXP1 and PTBP28. Analysis of 
tissue enrichment for AN-associated genes revealed a significant association with the central 
nervous system, and comparison to single-cell gene expression datasets from mice revealed 
significant associations with hippocampal pyramidal neurons and striatal medium spiny 
neurons. Song et al.11 further identified that AN-associated genes were enriched in the 
prefrontal cortex.

Genetic correlations implicate psychiatric, education, and metabolic factors in AN.

Genetic correlations (SNP-rg) between AN and psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and substance-
related disorders 8,12 correspond with clinical observations of comorbidity13 and twin 
studies14-16. Building on this work, AN and OCD risk genes pinpointed through GWAS 
showed similar prefrontal cortex expression alterations meaning that these disorders may 
have similar functional pathways11. A novel positive SNP-rg with objectively measured 
physical activity was found in the PGC-ED GWAS8 and may relate to the driven exercise 
seen in AN. Significant positive SNP-rg with educational attainment was not seen for IQ 
(Figure 1).

Earlier results hinted at a significant negative genetic correlation between AN and body 
mass index (BMI)9,17. The PGC-ED GWAS revealed significant genetic correlations with 
metabolic, lipid, and anthropometric traits, suggesting that metabolic mechanisms may drive 
physiological resistance to healthy body weight in AN8. The observed correlations were not 
confounded by the genetics of BMI—a concern given that BMI is a component of the AN 
diagnosis8. Likewise, exploratory Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in the PGC-EDs 
GWAS indicated a bidirectional causal relationship between AN and low BMI. The authors 
concluded that both metabolic and psychological factors may need to be considered to fully 
understand AN and that doing so may hasten the development of more effective treatments. 
Based on the strong associations with psychiatric traits, physical activity, educational 
attainment, and metabolic traits, multivariate GWAS analyses (e.g., genomic structural 
equation modeling) could offer novel opportunities to disentangle common and specific 
genetic effects and help boost power for discovery.

Polygenic scores.

Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize genome-wide data into a single variable of genetic 
liability to the phenotype—as a sum of the number of risk alleles present in the individual 
weighted by the SNP effects from GWAS. Higher PGS for AN derived from the 2019 
PGC-ED GWAS were associated with increased odds of AN, and equally in females and 
males8. Further, PGS of age of onset of AN predicted age at onset in independent cohorts18. 
A rich body of literature applying PGS is emerging, with multiple studies reporting that BMI 
and psychiatric PGS influence childhood and adolescent disordered eating behaviors19-21. 
PGS for other phenotypes may also differentiate among AN, BN, and BED on the 
genomic level. UK Biobank analyses revealed strong positive associations between binge-

type eating disorders (BN and BED) and anthropometric PGS (e.g., overweight and waist 
circumference), suggesting that binge eating may share genomic variants with overweight 
and obesity. In contrast, in AN, the direction of these associations was reversed22.

We anticipate increasing evidence that PGS will predict developmental phenotypic 
manifestations of illness (i.e., premorbid behavioral traits, course of illness) and gene-
environment associations, and ultimately inform risk assessment and clinical applications. 
Presently, clinical utility is limited23,24.

Cross-disorder GWAS.

A cross-disorder GWAS of eight psychiatric disorders (AN, ADHD, autism spectrum 
disorder, bipolar disorder, MDD, OCD, schizophrenia, and Tourette’s syndrome) revealed 
109 pleiotropic loci (i.e., signals for at least two disorders), of which eight had signals 
for AN25. The top locus (18q21.2) was associated with all disorders, has previously 
been implicated in MDD and neuroticism, and encodes the netrin 1 receptor gene (DCC) 
that regulates axon outgrowth. A joint genomic structural equation model showed that 
AN loaded onto a factor with OCD and Tourette’s syndrome26. These findings suggest 
overlapping genetic risk across disorders and that work needs to be done to separate 
specific from non-specific susceptibility variants, and the association of specific variants 
with cellular gene expression datasets to generate testable hypotheses for their ultimate 
impact on brain circuit function. Other cross-disorder GWAS on AN/OCD have yielded 
promising insights but require larger samples to pinpoint risk loci (i.e.,27).

Mendelian randomization (MR).

MR studies treat genetic variants as unconfounded proxies of an exposure of interest to 
evaluate the causal effect of an exposure on a phenotypic outcome. However, MR analyses 
investigating the causal effects of AN on other traits are presently limited in power. As 
stated earlier, a bidirectional causal association between AN and low BMI was found in 
the PGC-ED GWAS8. An MR study on the ALSPAC cohort (n = 4,473) suggested possible 
causal effects of genetically predicted childhood BMI on binge eating and weight and 
shape concern, and of binge eating and overeating on BMI28. In another study, adiponectin, 
a fat-tissue derived hormone, showed evidence consistent with a causal effect on eating 
disinhibition but not eating restraint29. Adams et al.30 found evidence consistent with a 
protective effect of fasting insulin level (n = 108,557) on AN (n = 72,515) (OR = 0.48, 
95% CI: 0.33, 0.71), but not for fasting glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) on AN. 
Future MR studies will help to disentangle the nature of pleiotropy and shed light on causal 
exposure-outcome effects.

Rare mutations and copy number variants.

No Mendelian forms of eating disorders have been identified and efforts to find rare genetic 
variants have not yet been successful. In an exome-chip based GWAS in 2,158 AN cases 
and 15,327 controls31, 16 independent variants were taken forward for in silico and de 
novo replication. No findings reached genome-wide significance. Scott-Van Zeeland et al.32 
conducted a series of targeted sequencing and genotyping studies focusing on 152 candidate 
genes in 1,205 AN cases and 1,948 controls, implicating variants in the estrogen receptor-b

(ESR2) and epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2) genes. A smaller exome sequencing study of 93 
AN cases reported an enrichment of rare variants in neuropeptide/neurotrophic pathways33. 
Combined linkage and sequencing of densely affected families with multiple AN or BN 
cases has been reported34,35. Results of these studies are tentative as sufficient sample sizes 
to identify rare point mutations have yet to be attained.

The situation is similar for genome-wide analyses of copy number variants (CNVs). Wang 
et al.36 found no evidence of CNV enrichment in AN cases compared to controls. Yilmaz et 
al.37 analyzed 1,983 female AN cases38 seeing no occurrence of well-established pathogenic 
CNVs for neurodevelopmental disorders (1q21.1; 2p16.3; 3q29; 7q36.3; 13q12; 15q11.2; 
15q13.3; 16p11.2(1); 16p11.2(2); 17q12; or 22q11.21). Chang et al.39 reported association 
of a 15q11.2 microduplication with AN, but cautioned that the results require validation. 
Currently, there is no credible evidence that novel or known large effect size CNVs influence 
AN. Much larger sample sizes may be required before we can exclude a role for CNVs 
carrying moderate effect sizes.

Limitations of human genetic studies.

Integration.

Several limitations in the field should be considered. First, to our knowledge, no GWAS of 
bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, purging disorder, atypical AN, avoidant/restrictive 
food intake disorder (ARFID), pica, or rumination disorder have been published. Second, 
for AN, genome-wide signals presently account for a low proportion of phenotypic variance 
(1.7%), while gene mapping and gene expression results presently rely on limited Hi-C, 
eQTL, and brain cell data. Larger sample sizes are required to improve statistical power 
and detect more susceptibility loci. Large, systematic sequencing studies are required to 
assess the role of rare variants and to complement common variant GWAS. Finally, although 
eating disorders are likely under-detected in males, the gender ratio is definitely tipped in 
the direction of females. Accruing larger samples sizes of afflicted males is essential for 
identifying genetic sex differences and is a priority for future research.

Genomic discovery in eating disorders is underway and early discoveries highlight new 
directions for deepening our understanding of some of the more perplexing facets of AN 
(e.g., extreme weight dysregulation, the frequent re-loss of therapeutically restored weight, 
compulsive exercise). The PGC is expanding genomic samples of AN, BN, and BED 
with efforts such as the Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative (EDGI)40. Novel biological 
discoveries are anticipated to accelerate therapeutic opportunities in drug discovery, the 
repositioning of current drugs, and our understanding of pleiotropy including opposing 
effects that may mitigate unintended off-target effects. The availability of biobanks 
with genetic and electronic health record data offer opportunities for extending genetic 
associations to other medical phenotypes not currently available. As with many illnesses, 
global cooperation and harmonization of methods boost sample sizes and accelerate science. 
Clearly, collaboration with researchers in other fields will increase the utility of GWAS 
results and integrate them into a unified science of eating disorders. This unification 
can be achieved through targeting dimensional phenotypes and symptoms and generating 
hypotheses for testing the causal impact of genomic variants on neural circuit function.

Eating disorders GWAS have focused primarily on diagnoses; however, exploring relevant 
dimensions or core symptoms may enhance translation to approximate phenotypes in 
animal models. Fine-mapping approaches are required to delve deeper into trait-associated 
regions to identify specific variants or genes that causally influence the target trait. 
Clearly describing the strength of evidence for the functional involvement of specific 
genes and variants in eating disorders will provide strong targets for causal validation and 
neurobiological exploration.

Neurobiology of genes implicated in AN GWAS.

Although too recent to have influenced neurobiological studies directly, several genes 
implicated by the latest AN GWAS have been studied in relation to other traits and show 
neurobiological relevance to eating disorders. For example, FOXP1 haploinsufficiency is a 
rare form of intellectual disability, related to autism spectrum disorder41. Haploinsufficiency 
of FOXP1 is associated with neurodevelopmental impairments, but also with feeding 
difficulties and gastrointestinal disturbance in humans and in mice, supporting FOXP1 in 
AN41. Conditional Foxp1 knockout studies in the mouse brain implicate neurogenesis and 
neural migration, particularly the development and functioning of medium spiny neurons 
and pyramidal neurons. Both cell types have been implicated as relevant neuronal cell types 
by systems biological analyses of the AN GWAS41.

As well as being implicated in AN, CADM1 and PTBP2 have also been implicated 
in GWAS of BMI42. PTBP2 encodes a neuron-specific RNA binding protein that 
organizes axonogenesis in the developing cortex, relevant across psychiatric disorders43. 
By comparison, CADM1 has not been associated with psychological or behavioral traits 
except BMI and AN (although family member CADM2 has been implicated in numerous 
traits related to impulsive behavior)44. CADM1 encodes a synaptic cell adhesion molecule. 
The BMI-associated variants appear to increase the expression of CADM1 in the human 
hypothalamus and cerebellum, and parallel experiments in mice suggest this increased 
expression contributes to weight gain, potentially through CADM1-positive innervation 
of POMC neurons45. CADM1 is also involved in the neural control of first estrous in 
mice, which is of particular interest given amenorrhea in AN1. MGMT, which encodes 
a DNA alkyltransferase, is the most well-studied of the genes implicated in the AN 
GWAS, as it is involved in DNA repair and protection against cancer46. The biological 
pathways linking DNA repair dysfunction to AN is unclear, although recent research 
suggests that postmitotic neurons require recurrent DNA repair that is relevant to neuronal 
dysfunction47,48. Assuming future GWASs support MGMT as a causal gene for AN, its role 
is worthy of future investigation.

Identifying conserved, eating disorder-relevant genes is currently limited by underpowered 
phenotype-driven analyses in humans and rodents. Neuroscience typically focuses on a 
different level of the biological hierarchy than statistical genetics. As such, deeper insight 
may be gained through examining the neuronal circuitry implicated directly through 
neuroscientific approaches and indirectly through GWAS-based approaches. GWAS-based 
approaches use information on cell-type specific genome biology, such as epigenetic 
markers49 or gene expression50. These methods show that genes associated with AN are

on average specifically expressed in brain tissues, especially in medium spiny neurons and 
CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons8. Results from these methods implicate the same cell 
types in other psychiatric disorders and are supported by functional studies in rodents. 
Differential vulnerability to ABA in female C57BL/6J mice was associated with GABAergic 
inhibition of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells51. Prolonged binge-like consumption of 
sucrose has been shown to alter the morphology of medium spiny neurons in the nucleus 
accumbens of rats52. However, beyond broad support for brain tissues in general, most 
circuits implicated in neurobiological studies of mice and of humans are poorly supported by 
these GWAS-based approaches, most likely due to limitations of power and insufficient data 
from appropriate tissues. For example, in contrast to the neurobiological evidence supporting 
a role for DA circuitry in AN, there is no such evidence from AN GWAS8. However, 
evidence for genetic variants affecting the DA system in eating disorders may emerge as 
the power of eating disorder GWAS increases. Both of these limitations are being overcome 
through increasing GWAS sample sizes and via collaborative brain mapping initiatives like 
the PsychENCODE project53.

Human Neuroimaging in Eating Disorders

Neuroimaging research in eating disorders has been motivated by (1) prior work in animal 
models which study microcircuitry involved in homeostatic and hedonic eating pathways 
and (2) genetic/GWAS studies that have identified shared functional networks that exhibit 
overlapping phenotypes (cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical pathways) (Figure 2).

Hedonic reward pathways - Mesocorticolimbic and mesolimbic networks.

The brain reward system is well-defined and plays a central role in the drive to eat. 
Mesocorticolimbic and mesolimbic pathways project from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) 
to the cerebral cortex (frontal, cingulate, and entorhinal cortex) and limbic structures (ventral 
striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala), respectively. Importantly, these systems are largely 
intertwined and overlapping54, and assigning specific brain regions to one clinical phenotype 
(e.g., restriction) or characteristic (e.g., cognitive control) is unhelpful as they act in unison. 
Collectively, mesocorticolimbic and mesolimbic pathways are responsible for cognitive 
functions, reward, emotion, and motivation, which may represent transdiagnostic factors 
underlying AN, BN, and BED55,56.

Early studies focusing on understanding the neurobiology of eating disorders suggested 
that there were pathological alterations in monoamine neurotransmitter systems, specifically 
DA and 5-HT56. These align with other works that have strongly implicated the reward 
system in pathological changes in hedonic eating and decision making. The VTA 
comprises a cluster of dopamine (DA) producing neurons that play a key role in positive 
and negative reinforcement, decision making, working memory, incentive salience, and 
aversion. Dopaminergic VTA neurons innervate corticolimbic regions via the mesocortical 
pathway, forming the mesocorticolimbic reward network. A subpopulation of midbrain 
DA neurons projecting to the striatum co-release glutamate and GABA onto their target 
neural substrates57. Understanding the structural and functional connectivity of these reward

circuits in eating disorders has been a central focus for neuroimaging investigations 
highlighted below.

Functional neuroimaging studies suggest altered processing of rewarding and aversive 
food stimuli in acute and recovered AN58,59. In binge-type eating disorders (BN, BED), 
functional neuroimaging findings are less consistent60,61. Positron emission tomography 
(PET) data in individuals recovered from AN show increased striatal dopamine receptor 
(D2/D3) binding, which was also related to striatal responses during monetary choices and 
self-reported trait anxiety62. Although, two PET studies focusing on individuals with acute63 
and weight restored AN64 compared to healthy controls, found no difference in DA receptor 
binding. PET studies in individuals with BN have identified decreased striatal dopamine 
transporter availability65. In patients with BN, increases in glutamate signaling receptors 
(metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5; mGlu5) were higher in the anterior cingulate 
cortex (ACC), subgenual prefrontal cortex, and straight gyrus compared with controls66. 
Structural neuroimaging studies in AN and BN reveal volumetric abnormalities in the 
insula67. Further, lower white matter measures of axonal integrity (measured via fractional 
anisotropy) and increased structural white matter connectivity between the insula and orbital 
frontal cortex suggest that altered processing of taste perception may be present across 
eating disorders. The insular cortex extends beyond taste function and is a center of body 
awareness, integrating autonomic, cognitive, and affective processing68 of the homeostatic 
state of the body. Both structural and functional neuroimaging studies highlight deficits in 
the insula and abnormal interoceptive activity in AN69,70 and BN71.

Cognitive control and habitual responding—cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical pathways.

The cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CTSC) pathway is a brain circuit that controls 
movement execution, habit formation, and reward, all of which have been hypothesized 
to be relevant to eating disorders. Hyperactivity throughout the CTSC circuits is believed to 
underlie OCD72, increasingly relevant given the strong positive genetic correlation between 
OCD and AN8. Overlapping CTSC loops, including lateral PFC, ACC, dorsal striatum, the 
presupplementary motor area, insula, and parietal regions, are involved in these processes.

In patients with BN, there are limited neuroimaging data to suggest that functional 
and structural alterations in control circuits occur early in the course of BN and may 
contribute to the disorder’s persistence over time73,74. In patients with AN, maladaptive 
excessive self-control is commonly described although the differences in underlying 
neurobiological correlates (i.e., structures) involving cognitive control are inconsistent in 
imaging studies75,76. Both AN and BN patients show reduced gray matter volume in caudate 
nucleus, ACC, and insula77; however, these results may normalize in AN and BN following 
successful treatment78.

Limitations.

Deficits in cognitive control, executive functioning, reward and affective processing are 
commonly reported across multiple psychiatric disorders, with similar neurobiological 
correlates reported in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex79-81. A limited number of studies compare neuroimaging across psychiatric

disorders (e.g.,82,83) or use meta-analytic techniques to do so (e.g.,79,80). Those that 
have been conducted have not included eating disorder patients despite evidence of 
psychiatric multimorbidity (including mood, substance use, and anxiety disorders)84. Eating 
disorder exclusion may occur because of state-specific neurobiological alterations due 
to malnourishment or dehydration stemming from key eating disorder specific behaviors 
(e.g., caloric restriction, purging, excessive exercise). Failure to account for state-specific 
effects has stymied human neuroimaging research in eating disorders. Eating disorder 
specific recommendations from experts in the fields of eating disorders and neuroimaging85 
have been proposed to account for malnutrition effects. Importantly, novel experimental 
designs are essential to disaggregate the extent to which any observed neurobiological 
alterations in AN are truly related to disease etiology or more accurately attributed to 
the impact of prolonged malnutrition/starvation. Accordingly, re-evaluation of prior eating 
disorder neuroimaging findings accounting for effects of malnourishment (e.g., white-matter 
alterations in AN86 and BN87) has led to improved understanding of state vs. trait effects in 
the brain.

Integrating human genetics and neuroimaging.

Imaging and genetics target distant levels of the biological hierarchy, and so integration 
is challenging. Genetically informed models of eating disorders hold the potential to 
generate construct-valid neurobiological disease models. Direct examination of the effect 
of genetic variation on brain structure and function is underway through the ENIGMA 
consortium88. Further insights could be obtained by examining intermediate levels of the 
biological hierarchy. Cellular-level data can be inferred from eating disorder GWAS—this 
has implicated hippocampal pyramidal neurons and striatal medium spiny neurons as the 
cell types that express identified genes in AN8. However, this approach remains in its 
infancy—larger sample sizes for GWAS and for gene expression datasets in neuronal and 
non-neuronal cells (e.g., microglia, oligodendrocytes) are needed to provide sufficient power 
for the parallel implication of brain circuits from neuroimaging and from GWAS.

Animal Models for Eating Disorders

As eating disorders GWAS become larger and more robust, their ability to interconnect 
with animal models will increase. Animal models offer speed in achieving power, control 
over allele frequency and genetic background, environmental exposure, and recording and 
collection of the appropriate cell types and tissues at appropriate time points to study the 
dynamic genetic architecture and genomic adaptations across eating disorder progression 
and recovery. Two popular animal models for eating disorder are the activity-based anorexia 
(ABA) model and the binge-like eating (BLE) model (see Box 2). Genes, variants, and 
circuit mechanisms gleaned from animal studies can be discovered and validated first 
within the same species and genetic background and then in humans. Likewise, identified 
genes from human GWAS and proposed circuitry from human neuroimaging studies can 
also be tested for causality and function in animal models, potentially on multiple genetic 
backgrounds (Figure 3).

Phenotype-driven genetics of ABA.

Various mouse strains exhibit differential susceptibility to ABA. Specifically, DBA/2J 
female mice show greater wheel running activity, greater weight loss, less food intake, 
and severe hypoleptinemia compared to C57BL/6J89. C57BL/6J showed greater ABA than 
A/J and multiple chromosome substitution strains90. A genetic correlation between baseline 
physical activity (wheel running, locomotor) and ABA across inbred strains91 identified 
physical activity as a potential premorbid trait that predicts the development of ABA. 
Despite inbred strain differences in ABA, causal genetic factors have yet to be found.

Phenotype-driven genetics of BLE.

Phenotypic differences in BLE between inbred rodent strains implicate underlying causal 
genes92,93. In an intermittent, limited access paradigm for BLE of sweetened PF, 
cytoplasmic FMR-interacting protein 2(Cyfip2) was mapped and validated in a cross 
between C57BL/6 substrains. Cyfip2+/− mice showed a decrease in compulsive BLE 
of PF but not chow94. Cyfip1+/− mice also showed modulation of BLE, depending on 
parent-of-origin, genetic background, and sex95. CYFIP1 CNV is implicated in autism, 
ADHD, psychosis96, and, possibly, AN although lab validation of the CNV calling 
failed39. The study of BLE with increased genetic diversity, additional diets (high fat diet), 
and environmental variables will increase gene identification. In support, a recent study 
involving a cross between the BLE-prone DBA/2J strain with the BLE-resistant C57BL/6J 
strain92 identified multiple QTLs influencing eating behavior and body weight, including a 
sex-combined QTL containing the candidate gene Lcorl that influences initial consumption 
of palatable food, a female-selective locus containing the candidate gene Zeb1 underlying 
changes in body weight during BLE, and a male-selective locus for escalation in palatable 
food intake that contains the candidate genes Adipor2 and Plxnd197.

Given the diverse array of mouse crosses and populations that are now available to 
accelerate gene mapping, forward genetic studies of ABA and BLE in rodents provide 
the opportunity for novel gene/pathway identification. Such studies are sorely lacking. 
Nonetheless, CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 have homologs to study in humans. Although neither 
of these genes has yet been associated with AN through GWAS8, ongoing GWAS of BED 
and BN will be more relevant for assessing the association between CYFIP genes and binge 
eating in humans.

Omic studies of ABA.

Omics analysis has been applied to both brain tissue and gut microbiota to improve our 
understanding of molecular adaptations associated with ABA and BLE. Proteomic studies 
in ABA models have identified hypothalamic mitochondrial and autophagy processes98, 
deficits in energy metabolism in colonic mucosa99, and an increase in ATP-producing 
glycolytic enzymes in gut microbiota100. These results implicate an adaptive energy source 
in the gut that could influence brain function and feeding behavior in AN. Opposing changes 
in energy utilization between the hypothalamus and gut mucosa during ABA suggest that 
restoration of energy homeostasis between the CNS and periphery could improve treatment 
of AN in humans.

Animal models can be used to longitudinally measure the impact of early life factors 
like stress, diet, or genetics on eating disorders. In a mouse model involving chronic, 
variable mild stress in pregnant dams, prenatal stress (PNS) induced transcriptomic indices 
of hypothalamic HPA and metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity and protected 
against ABA in adolescent female mice. PNS protection was associated with increased DNA 
methylation and placental miR-340 downregulation and upregulation of miR-340 targets101. 
Low miR-340 and ABA resistance were also associated with increased expression of SLC 
nutrient transporters (amino acids, glucose), and growth factors that are potentially regulated 
by miR-340 targets. Placental overexpression of miR-340 recapitulated fetal and adolescent 
hypothalamic and circadian dysfunction101, supporting a role for placental miR-340 in 
regulating nutrient availability that could influence eating disorder susceptibility.

Omics of BLE.

Transcriptome analysis of the striatum found a BLE-induced downregulation of myelination 
genes94, supporting reports of decreased white matter integrity with increased BE in 
individuals with BN102. Gut microbiota from male rat feces following intermittent access 
to energy-rich “cafeteria” showed changes in microbial flavonoid, bile acid, d-arginine, 
d-ornithine, fatty acid, and geraniol biosynthetic pathways that correlated with body weight, 
adipose tissue, glucose, leptin, and insulin103. Although similar studies are needed in 
humans, these data suggest that microbial pathways could be targeted to normalize eating 
and metabolic function in BE.

To summarize, omics analysis of relevant tissues at appropriate time points in animal models 
for eating disorders offer distinct, complementary advantages to human studies and will 
continue providing unique insights into the hedonic and homeostatic adaptations that could 
inform therapeutics. Furthermore, combining omics with phenotype-driven forward genetic 
studies can further inform mechanisms of gene dysfunction and the consequent genomic 
adaptations that drive and sustain disordered eating. Expanding these latter approaches 
would provide valuable triangulation of omics studies in humans.

Viral overexpression and neural circuit studies of ABA.

Contemporary circuit approaches to understand feeding suppression and stimulation have 
been reviewed elsewhere (e.g.,104-106). Here, we distinguish our discussion from the 
physiology of homeostatic meal termination—adaptive anorexigenic responses—and focus 
on related studies involving ABA that more holistically model AN pathology and behavioral 
phenotypes. These studies provide more direct evidence as to the associative and causal 
neurobiological factors of AN. Viral overexpression of the D2 dopamine receptor in D2-
containing mouse neurons of the NAc core induced hyperactivity, increased food intake, 
and enhanced ABA-induced wheel running and weight loss in females107. Only females 
showed severe weight loss during scheduled fasting alone, even without a change in food 
intake or hyperactivity. More recently, chemogenetic activation inhibition of the projection 
from medial PFC to NAc shell decreased cognitive flexibility and increased ABA whereas 
inhibition prevented ABA weight loss and increased cognitive flexibility108. Zhang and 
Dulawa propose that projections from the NAc shell to the lateral hypothalamus (LH)

and in turn, from the LH to the VTA, could link ABA-induced mesocorticolimbic reward 
dysfunction with ABA-induced changes in metabolism109 (Figure 4).

The NAc receives strong input from VTA dopamine-producing neurons, and specific 
chemogenetic activation of NAc-projecting VTA DA neurons increases food intake, food 
anticipatory activity, and survival in the ABA model110. These results implicate female-
specific metabolic dysfunction induced by NAc D2 overexpression107 and suggest that NAc 
D2 receptor density and signaling could affect risk for AN and predispose individuals 
toward excessive exercise, potentially as a means to alleviate underlying reward deficiency
—although further studies are needed to support this hypothesis. Combined with genetic 
studies implicating striatal neurons that express either D1 or D2 and human imaging studies, 
we propose that striatal circuits are a biological risk hub that warrant further investigation.

Moreover, animal, clinical, and genetic findings implicate leptin in the risk and maintenance 
of AN. Hyperactivity, eating restraint, and earlier weight loss after inpatient refeeding are 
correlated with lower leptin in AN patients111, implicating a loss of leptin signaling in VTA 
underlies ABA hyperactivity. In ABA rats, leptin treatment reduced hyperactivity via the 
VTA region112, implicating a loss of leptin signaling in VTA underlies ABA hyperactivity. 
GWAS-based genetic correlations suggest an overlap in the biological regulation of AN, 
leptin, and physical activity8. A case report suggested that leptin treatment may reduce 
hyperactivity and eating disorder-related cognitions in AN113. Although it has not been 
studied in AN, human neuroimaging studies in healthy individuals demonstrate that leptin 
regulates mesolimbic dopamine systems under stress114. Accordingly, leptin is an important 
hormone in linking genetics with alterations in the DA reward system.

Optogenetic and chemogenetic analysis of BLE.

Optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches seek to identify and manipulate specific cell 
types and fibers to test proposed circuitry in feeding115, see reviews (e.g., 104). Here, 
we focus on studies employing BLE paradigms directly or indirectly associated with the 
mesolimbic reward pathway.

Several studies have identified that activation of inputs to VTA dopamine (DA) neurons 
from the lateral hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, or the dorsal raphe 
nucleus produces positive valence, appetitive behavior, and can increase compulsive-like 
food or liquid reward consumption104. Broadly, these studies support a physiological role 
for these brain circuits in shaping motivation and food consumption by transient phasic 
activation of VTA DA neurons. Conversely, persistent activation of VTA DA neurons using 
chemogenetics or via the 5HT2C receptor agonist lorcaserin resulted in a reduction in binge 
eating116. Of note, direct stimulation of VTA DA neurons does not stimulate eating per 
se117. These data suggest that the observed contribution of VTA DA neurons to BLE is 
complex and sensitive to the time scales of experimental manipulations. These findings 
also underscore the critical need to understand how VTA DA neuron activity is altered 
across multiple binge eating episodes. Finally, the incorporation of pathological BLE models 
that pair food consumption with aversive consequences (e.g., footshock) will be useful in 
distinguishing between patterns of VTA neuron activity that accompany adaptive hedonic

food consumption versus repetitive compulsive-like BLE that is insensitive to negative 
reinforcement.

Studies of BLE have also revealed important changes in neural circuits receiving robust 
dopamine inputs and how dopamine receptors modulate neural activity in these sites. The 
VTA and substantia nigra pars compacta DA neurons project to the ventral (NAc) and 
dorsal striatum. Released DA then shapes ongoing neural activity in medium spiny neurons 
primarily via modulation of downstream PKA-dependent signaling cascades. In the NAc, 
a multiday course of binge eating increase delta band oscillations of local field potentials 
(LFPs) and single unit activity in anticipation of palatable food intake118. Palatable food 
consumption was specifically disrupted via targeted stimulation during anticipatory periods, 
a phenomenon that may require activation of D2 receptors119. Interestingly, delta band 
oscillations in the ventral striatum were observed in humans118. Anticipatory activity, or 
ramps, are also visible in the dorsal striatum at the level of single neurons or bulk calcium 
transients during food approach 120. These ramps rapidly terminate during food consumption 
and their functional requirement to binge eating is unknown.

Modulation of the dorsal and ventral striatum also occurs from prefrontal and insular cortex 
(IC) inputs. The IC integrates taste, interoception, and motivation to regulate feeding, and 
food-predictive cues reliably activate IC neurons121,122. Chemogenetic activation of the 
anterior IC as a whole decreases palatable food intake and cue reactivity in a rat model 
of binge eating123, and optogenetic activation of the right anterior IC in mice similarly 
reduces food intake124. Conversely, in a model of compulsive binge eating in rats, pathway-
specific inhibition of the insula cortex (IC) to NAc decreased appetitive behavior to receive 
palatable food intermittently paired with foot shock125. These studies indicate a complex 
role of the insula in reinforcement and compulsive BLE. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), 
activation of NAc shell projecting neurons reduced food intake in a binge-eating model in 
rats predisposed to high impulsivity, a trait observed in a previous study126. Optogenetic 
activation of inhibitory VIP-expressing interneurons of infralimbic and prelimbic mPFC 
in male mice decreased BLE of a high caloric diet127. These findings implicate reduced 
function of the PFC->NAc circuit in impulsivity and BLE. Further study of these circuits 
across the acquisition of BLE behavior (first episode vs last) is necessary to investigate the 
dynamics and link to pathology more precisely. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that 
BLE can be inhibited in real time through neural circuit manipulations demonstrating that 
ongoing activity of specific cortical and limbic circuits is required for BLE.

Animal Model Limitations.

One of the primary limitations in the use of animal models is their inability to capture 
complex psychological constructs important to the etiology of eating disorders like a drive 
for thinness, body dysmorphia, or intense fear of weight gain in the case of AN and a loss 
of control for BLE. However, emerging technologies in markerless pose estimation and deep 
learning provide basic scientists the opportunity to extract novel behavioral phenotypes that 
may be associated with these constructs128. The other major limitation of animal models 
is that, to date, animal models have not yet been used to test the causal nature of a sum 
of polygenic risk-associated common variants from an eating disorder group. This is an

important technical and conceptual factor to consider as we move closer to testing causality 
of disease-associated variants.

Integration.

Circuit approaches in animal models provide increasing specificity with regard to cell 
types and their connections underlying ABA and BLE. Convergent evidence across 
studies suggests that longitudinal assessment of neuronal function in mesolimbic and 
nigrostriatal circuits, combined with single cell omics will advance our understanding of 
the central neuronal adaptations as well as peripheral cell type-specific adaptations that 
drive maladaptive feeding. These assessments should incorporate hypotheses informed by 
emergent GWAS and human imaging data and can in turn contextualize and inform studies 
in humans.

Genetic, neuroimaging, and animal model research in eating disorders have largely 
represented independent disciplines. These sciences of eating disorders have now matured 
adequately that cross-communication is both possible and essential in order to strengthen 
causal inferences and translate observations into biological understanding and novel 
therapeutics.

Conclusions and Future Directions.

As human GWAS and neuroimaging studies grow and diversify and novel animal models 
are developed, efforts to bridge disciplines must expand. Ongoing GWAS of BED and 
BN will give context to findings from mouse BLE models. Gene-driven approaches in 
neurobiology and behavior should increasingly incorporate evidence for association of target 
genes from human GWAS. Interdisciplinary efforts will benefit studies investigating the 
main effects of genes and variants, as well as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. 
Exquisite control over environmental factors in animal models will allow rigorous testing 
of putative interactions from genome-wide observational epidemiology in eating disorders. 
Finally, eating disorder research must be proactive in embracing other disciplines. For 
example, the utility and diversity of induced pluripotent stem cell models has increased 
rapidly, and the application of these models to eating disorder research could yield 
valuable new insights129. Our hope is to accelerate target identification by applying robust 
statistical genetic and pathway analysis methods, large-scale brain and neurodevelopmental 
systems biology approaches, and innovative chemoinformatics130. In order to do this, eating 
disorders should seek to communicate across disciplines, including establishing meetings 
dedicated to translational eating disorders research. Ultimately, the goal is to translate 
genetic and neuroscience findings directly into the clinic to enable biologically informed 
tailored treatment selection and delivery and to eliminate morbidity and mortality from these 
debilitating illnesses.

Anorexia nervosa.

Overview of Eating Disorder Phenotypes

The hallmark symptom of AN is low body weight, accompanied by persistent restriction 
of energy intake and/or increased energy expenditure, intense fear of gaining weight or 
persistent behavior preventing weight gain, and distorted body image1. Both a restricting 
and a binge-eating/purging subtype exist. The lifetime prevalence is 1.4% (0.1-3.6) for 
women and 0.2% (0-0.3%) for men%)131. The standardized mortality ratio of AN is >5 
132 with deaths primarily attributable to illness effects and suicide133. Treatment outcome 
in adults is poor with only 30% achieving full recovery134. Family-based treatment 
for youth is recommended; multidisciplinary interventions are recommended for adults 
although the evidence base remains particularly weak135. No medications exist that 
successfully treat the disorder or are approved by the FDA135.

Bulimia nervosa.

The core symptoms of BN include binge eating (eating an unusually large amount of 
food in a circumscribed period of time accompanied by a sense of loss of control) and 
inappropriate compensatory behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting, abuse of laxatives, 
diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise), with self-evaluation being strongly influenced 
by shape and weight1. BN can occur at all body weights, but is diagnosed as AN 
binge-eating/purging subtype in the presence of AN. The lifetime prevalence is 1.9% 
(0.3-4.6%) for women and 0.6% (0.1-1.3%) for men131, and onset is typically in late 
adolescence or early adulthood. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the leading 
evidence-based treatment and fluoxetine, whose efficacy was established in placebo-
controlled clinical trials in the early 1990s, is the only FDA approved medication135 BN 
recovery rates are ~50% at 5-10 years follow-up136.

Binge-eating disorder.

BED is marked by recurrent binge eating that causes distress, the absence of regular 
compensatory behaviors, and behavioral and emotional features such as eating rapidly 
or when not hungry, and feeling embarrassed or disgusted by one’s behavior1. The 
lifetime prevalence is 2.8% (0.6-5.8%) for women and 1.0% (0.3-2.0%) for men131. 
Onset is typically early adulthood but can be at any time and in individuals spanning 
the normal to obese weight ranges1. Evidence-based treatments for BED include CBT, 
second-generation antidepressants, and since 2015, lisdexamfetamine an FDA approved 
stimulant originally prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder137. Preclinical, clinical, genetic studies (of binge eating), and neuroimaging 
data converged on dysfunction in systems regulating eating behavior and reward (i.e., 
dopaminergic and noradrenergic), and support the repositioning of lisdexamfetamine in 
BED138.

Animal Models for Eating Disorders

Activity-based anorexia (ABA).

AN has some characteristics that cannot be modeled in rodents (drive for thinness, body 
image distortion, intense fear of weight gain). However, key behavioral components of 
AN as well as traits commonly comorbid with AN can be modeled in mice (high physical 
activity, anxiety, depression, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive-like behavior). Perhaps 
most well-known is the activity-based anorexia (ABA) model that starts with daily 
unlimited chow availability but for only 2h per day or less followed by introduction of 
a running wheel which leads to compulsive-like running, appetite suppression, voluntary 
restriction of food intake, decreased anxiety-like behavior, severe weight loss, and death 
without intervention139. ABA induces other AN-like effects on physiology, including 
hypothermia, loss of estrus, increased HPA axis activity, anhedonia, ulcers, and humoral, 
CNS, cardiovascular, and GI dysfunction140—a credible model for the behavioral and 
physiological components of AN.

Binge-like eating (BLE).

Binge eating shares several features with substance use disorders—tolerance, withdrawal, 
relapse, loss of control, and compulsive intake. Binge-like eating (BLE) has been studied 
in animals141, defined by increased intake of palatable food (PF; high caloric) versus 
chow and escalation of intake over time142. Compulsive-like eating refers to habitual, 
often increased effortful intake despite potential harm (aversive stimulus) that can relieve 
negative affect during withdrawal143. Home cage chow restriction, stress exposure, and 
limited, intermittent access to PF can all promote BLE144. Intermittent BLE models 
induce the most robust binge-like eating, yet do not typically induce obesity, as rodents 
voluntarily restrict chow intake in anticipation of PF which in turn, increases PF 
reinforcing efficacy145,146. BLE is a reasonable animal approximation of the behavioral 
components of dysregulated eating characteristic of human binge eating.

Figure 2. 
Human neuroimaging circuitry involved in eating disorders. (A) Represents the structures 
comprising two major dopaminergic pathways, mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, 
supported by prior work in animal models. Both originate in the ventral tegmental area 
(red); mesolimbic pathways project to the nucleus accumbens, and is part of the complex 
circuit involving the amygdala (pink), hippocampus (green), and the bed nucleus of the stria 
terminalis (yellow). The mesocortical pathway projects primarily to the prefrontal cortex 
(orange) and insula (purple). (B) Represents sub-structures involved in the cortico-striatal-
thalamo-cortical (CSTC) pathway that are supported by recent genetic/GWAS studies with 
shared functional networks that exhibit overlapping phenotypes. The CSTC pathway is a 
multi-synaptic neuronal circuit that connects the cortex with the striatum and thalamus. The 
striatum (green) receives glutamatergic input from the cortex and the thalamus (blue) sends 
out GABAergic inputs to the sub-thalamic nucleus (pink, purple, red).

Figure 3. 
Forward and backward translation of eating disorder-relevant traits at different levels 
of biological hierarchy. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) and binge-like eating (BLE) 
are behavioral models for restrictive eating in AN and for binge eating in BN and 
BED. Within the use of animal models, there are four primary approaches that seek 
to elucidate the fundamental biology of eating disorders: QTL mapping, Omics, neural 
circuit manipulations, and in vivo gene editing. QTL mapping is used to discover genetic 
loci and ultimately candidate causal genes and variants that regulate phenotypic traits at 
the molecular, cellular, or behavioral level. QT mapping capitalizes on natural variation 
across different strains or substrains of laboratory models like mice. Omics investigations 
are carried out at the genomic, transcriptomic(not shown), proteomic, microbiomic, or 
metabolomic levels and can reveal novel biological pathways that regulate feeding and/or 
metabolism. In vivo gene editing research can be used to establish causality for candidate 
genomic variants identified from rodent QTL/GWAS or in silico studies. Neural circuit 
approaches are also used to establish causal molecular, cellular, or circuit elements that 
drive eating behavior and metabolism. They span the range of observing neural activity 
and synaptic function, manipulating those circuits in real time (e.g., via optogenetic. 
chemogenetic, or pharmacological approaches), and layering these experiments with 
pathological models.

drugs; Gi = G inhibitory DREADDS; Gs = G stimulatory DREADDS; D2 = D2 
dopamine receptor overexpression. Green indicates excitation of cell type and pathway. 
Red indicates inhibition of pathway. Purple indicates overexpression. Overexpression of D2 
dopamine receptors in medium spiny neurons of NAc core increased ABA phenotypes and 
combined with scheduled fasting alone (no wheel running), was sufficient to induce weight 
loss and glucose intolerance in females without affecting food intake107. Chemogenetic 
activation of the mPFC->NAc shell pathway decreased cognitive flexibility and increased 
ABA; inhibition had the opposite effect108. Chemogenetic activation of VTA neurons 
decreased ABA and increased survival110. Leptin injections into the VTA decreased wheel 
running112. Blue arrows indicate pathway proposed by Zhang and Dulawa109 to mediate 
mesocorticolimbic reward modulation of energy expenditure and metabolism in ABA. 
Additional work is necessary to delineate the circuits, neurotransmitters, and hormones that 
link ABA reward dysfunction with increased energy expenditure.

Figure 5. Mesolimbic-centered neural circuits that modulate binge-like eating (BLE).
Converging on the VTA to NAc dopaminergic circuit, behavioral neuroscientists have 
used circuit-level techniques like chemogenetics and optogenetics to study BLE, normal 
feeding, and reward-like behavior. Inputs to the VTA from the DR, BNST, and LH modulate 
reward and food consumption as shown by pathway-specific optogenetics. Within the VTA, 
chemogenetic activation of VTA DA neuron reduces BLE and direct optogenetic activation 
has no impact on feeding. Within the NAc, pathway specific optogenetic inhibition of 
the inputs from the insular cortex reduces BLE. Similarly, chemogenetic activation of the 
NAc-projecting input cells from the vmPFC or VIP-expressing neurons in the prelimbic 
and infralimbic PFC also reduces BLE. Abbreviations: BLE – binge-like eating; BNST – 
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; ChR2 – Channelrhodopsin2; DA – dopamine; D1R – 
dopamine D1 receptor; D2R – dopamine D2 receptor; DR – dorsal raphe; GABA – gamma 
aminobutyric acid; GLU – glutamate; IC – insular cortex; LH – lateral hypothalamus; NAc 
– nucleus accumbens; PET-1 - PC12 ETS Domain-Containing Transcription Factor; PFC – 
prefrontal cortex; VIP – vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; vmPFC – ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex; VTA – Ventral tegmental area.
