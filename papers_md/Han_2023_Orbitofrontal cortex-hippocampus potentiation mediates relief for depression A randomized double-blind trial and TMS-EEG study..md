SUMMARY

It has been 15 years since repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex (DLPFC) was approved by the FDA for clinical depression treatment. Yet, the underlying mech-
anisms for rTMS-induced depression relief are not fully elucidated. This study analyzes TMS-electroenceph-
alogram (EEG) data from 64 healthy control (HC) subjects and 53 patients with major depressive disorder
(MDD) before and after rTMS treatment. Prior to treatment, patients with MDD have lower activity in the
DLPFC, the hippocampus (HPC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and DLPFC-OFC connectivity compared
with HCs. Following active rTMS treatment, patients with MDD show a signiﬁcant increase in the DLPFC,
HPC, and OFC. Notably, the increase in HPC activity is speciﬁcally associated with amelioration of depressive
symptoms but not anxiety or sleep quality. The orbitofrontal-hippocampal pathway plays a crucial role in
mediating depression relief following rTMS treatment. These ﬁndings suggest potential alternative targets
for brain stimulation therapy against depression (chictr.org.cn: ChiCTR2100052007).

INTRODUCTION

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental
illness, causing considerable economic burden worldwide.1,2
Despite the wide and relatively efﬁcient use of antidepressants
in clinical practices, they often bring side effects and take a
few weeks to be effective.3,4 In the past two decades, repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex (DLPFC), as a non-pharmaceutical therapy, has
proven to be effective for patients with MDD.5,6 Nevertheless,
the neural mechanism underlying the therapeutic efﬁciency of
rTMS treatment have not been fully elucidated. Dissecting
neurophysiological signatures and circuitry reprogramming
following rTMS treatment is therefore critical for target optimiza-
tion and individualized precision of the technique.

It has been proposed that the therapeutic beneﬁts of rTMS
involve the changes both in the stimulated site and in deeper
brain regions.7,8 Neuroimaging studies found that rTMS attenu-
ated the functional connectivity from the stimulated DLPFC to
the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and amyg-
dala,9–11 which are mainly involved in emotion processing and
regulation. Beyond these regions, patients with MDD also
demonstrated structural and functional abnormality in the hip-

pocampus (HPC) which is closely related to the cognitive func-
tion of memory.12–15 One possible explanation for the changes
in HPC activity following DLPFC-targeted rTMS treatment is
that rTMS directly normalizes activity through the DLPFC-
HPC pathway.16,17 Such circuitry dysfunction has been well
documented in animal models with memory deﬁcits18,19 and
also in patients with schizophrenia20 and posttraumatic stress
disorder.21 Although DLPFC-targeted rTMS has been reported
to alter DLPFC-HPC connectivity in healthy adults,22 it is un-
clear whether this circuit can be modulated through rTMS in
the treatment of patients with MDD. Apart from the direct
pathway, it is also possible that rTMS normalizes HPC activity
through connectivity with other regions. For instance, activation
of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is positively associated with
HPC activity,23,24 and antidepressants have been found to
reverse the abnormal activity in both the OFC and HPC.25 How-
ever, the effects of rTMS on the DLPFC-OFC-HPC circuit
remain unknown.

Toward these possibilities, we employed a single TMS pulse
as a quantitative probe to activate the DLPFC region and
concurrently measured the evoked neurophysiological activities
among different brain regions. This simultaneous TMS-electro-
affords high temporal
approach

ability, as well as cortical-cortical connectivity.26,27 These fea-
tures were recognized with signiﬁcant power to distinguish
healthy control subjects from those with psychiatric disorders
including mood disorders, schizophrenia, substance use disor-
ders, and attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder.8,27,28 We ﬁrst
identiﬁed neural indicators that differentiate patients with MDD
from healthy control subjects. We hypothesized that patients
with MDD had abnormal
local activity and impaired cortical-
cortical/subcortical connectivity compared with healthy con-
trols. We then examined the potential effects of rTMS treatment
on these neurophysiological features. We further hypothesized
that patients with MDD in the active rTMS group would demon-
strate signs of normalization when compared with the subjects
of the sham rTMS group. Finally, we aim to use structural equa-
tion modeling to explore the circuit mechanism (direct, indirect,
or both) of these changes. These results shall help to elucidate
the network mechanism underlying rTMS-induced relief
for
depression (Figure 1).

velope [SOE]) at source levels (Figures 2E–2G). Statistics were
computed with the same time window as those used for LMFA-
AUC. Compared with HC subjects, patients with MDD showed sig-
niﬁcant hypoactivity in the DLPFC (t = 2.29, p = 0.024, Cohen’s d =
0.41), OFC (t = 2.85, p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 0.50), and HPC (t =
2.09, p = 0.039, Cohen’s d = 0.37) accompanied by a decrease
in low frequencies (e.g., delta, theta, or alpha, p < 0.05). In contrast
to these regions, there was no difference at the posterior parietal
cortex (PPC) between the two groups in either SCD or speciﬁc fre-
quency bands.

To quantify the effective circuitry connectivity between the
DLPFC and its related brain regions, we took signiﬁcant current
scattering (SCS) as a measurement for activation propagation.
The results showed that the SCS between the stimulation site
and the OFC was lower in patients with MDD than HC subjects
(W = 2058.5, p = 0.047, Cliff’s delta = 0.21), and no difference
was observed in other ROIs (Figures 2H and 2I). These results indi-
cated that patients with MDD showed reduced functional connec-
tivity of the DLPFC-OFC circuit but not the DLPFC-HPC circuit.

RESULTS

Neurophysiological alterations of DLPFC centered
circuits in patients with MDD

As shown in Figure 2A, patients with MDD had higher Hamilton
Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24) scores than the healthy control
(HC) group (t = 32.95, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 6.64). Similarly, pa-
tients with MDD scored higher on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating
Scale (HAMA) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scales
than the HC group (p < 0.001). For EEG signals, we ﬁrstly inves-
tigated neural activity of DLPFC at sensor levels. The TMS-
evoked potential (TEP) amplitude ratio of P60/N100, a surrogate
for E/I balance in local regions, was signiﬁcantly lower in patients
with MDD when compared with the HC group (t = (cid:1)2.16, p =
0.033, Cohen’s d = 0.41; Figure 2C). No difference was found
for other TEP parameters between the two groups (Table S1).
We then examined the extent of local neural activation using
local mean ﬁeld amplitude area under the curve (LMFA-AUC;
see Figure S2A for temporal dynamics of the full period), and
we found that patients with MDD demonstrated a smaller
LMFA-AUC than HC subjects between 164 and 215 ms after
TMS pulse (t = (cid:1)3.14, p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.55; Figure 2D).
These results co-suggested for reduced excitability in prefrontal
region in MDD.

To precisely locate the changes in neural circuitry related to the
DLPFC, we performed source localization analyses and calculated
the corresponding regional activation (signiﬁcant current density
[SCD]) and frequency-speciﬁc activities (signiﬁcant oscillatory en-

Effects of rTMS treatment on neurophysiological
markers

We compared the interaction between treatment group (active vs.
sham) and time (pre-rTMS vs. post-rTMS) for patients with MDD.
There was signiﬁcantly higher decrease in HAMD-24 scores in the
active treatment group than the sham group (t = 4.28, one-tailed
p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.20; Figure 3A), but this tendency was
not signiﬁcant
in the measurement of HAMA and PSQI
(p > 0.05). At sensor levels, the changes in P60/N100 did not signif-
icantly different between active and sham treatment groups (t =
0.07, one-tailed p = 0.471; Figure 3C) and neither did other TEP
parameters (Table S2). Notably, the treatment induced a higher in-
crease in LMFA-AUC (150–185 ms after TMS pulse) in active than
sham treatment groups (t = 2.70, one-tailed p = 0.005, Cohen’s d =
0.73; Figure 3D; see Figure S2C for temporal dynamics).

At source levels, the increase of SCD in OFC activation was
larger in the active treatment group than in the sham treatment
group (t = 1.75, one-tailed p = 0.043, Cohen’s d = 0.48;
Figures 3E and 3F). This tendency was not observed in another
four ROIs. For connectivity analysis, there was no signiﬁcant dif-
ference of SCS changes between active and sham treatment
groups (Figure S3A).

In the MDD group with active rTMS treatment, there was a sig-
niﬁcant increase of SCD in the left DLPFC (lDLPFC) (t = 2.19,
one-tailed p = 0.019, Cohen’s d = 0.61), OFC (t = 2.43, one-tailed
p = 0.011, Cohen’s d = 0.62), and HPC (t = 1.85, one-tailed p =
0.038, Cohen’s d = 0.48; Figure 3G). The following analysis on
SOE further suggested that the increase in these regions was

weekdays. Each session consisted of 1,800 pulses of 10 Hz rTMS. After 2 weeks of rTMS treatment, patients with MDD were measured with clinical scales and
TMS-EEG again.
(B) Pipeline for analyzing TMS-EEG data. At sensor levels (top), TEPs and LMFA-AUC were calculated as the mean TMS-evoked amplitudes and the summation
of LMFA amplitudes within speciﬁc time windows (TWs), respectively. TWs were locked for the following analyses when there were signiﬁcant differences
between two conditions (e.g., HCs vs. patients with MDD). At source levels (middle), SCD and SOE sum all signiﬁcant TMS-evoked current densities or SOEs in a
given region of interest (ROI). At network levels (bottom), SCS sums all of the distance of a signiﬁcant source from the stimulated site, and SEM is a multiple linear
regression model that evaluates relationships among ROIs simultaneously.

HCs. After rTMS treatment (bottom), patients with MDD who received active treatment showed a larger decrease in HAMD scores, as well as increased activity in
ROIs, than those receiving sham treatment.

successfully distinguish the MDD group from the HC group
(p < 0.05). Notably, model 3, with P60/N100, LMFA-AUC, and
OFC-SCD included, showed the best performance compared
with the other models (Figure 4B). Also, the real AUC using cor-
rect labels was signiﬁcantly higher than the shufﬂed AUC (Fig-
ure 4C). These results suggested that LMFA-AUC and OFC-
SCD are potentially important
factors differentiating MDD
from HC.

After rTMS treatment, the increase in LMFA-AUC was gener-
ally associated with the relief of depressive symptoms, regard-
less of the type of the treatment (r = (cid:1)0.33, p = 0.015; Figure 4D).
Unlike LMFA-AUC, the increase in HPC-SCD associated with the
reduction of depressive symptoms was restricted to the active
treatment and not the sham treatment (active: r = (cid:1)0.41, p =
0.030; sham: r = (cid:1)0.01, p = 0.950; Figure 4E). Moreover, to clarify
the speciﬁcity of LMFA-AUC and HPC-SCD changes to depres-
sive alleviation, we conducted control analyses by computing
their correlations with changes in anxiety and sleep quality. Re-
sults showed that the increase in LMFA-AUC and HPC activity
was not signiﬁcantly associated with changes in anxiety and
sleep quality (Figure S4), supporting that LMFA-AUC and HPC-
SCD changes may serve as speciﬁc biomarkers for depression
alleviation. More speciﬁcally, we found that
the increased
gamma-band activity in the DLPFC and delta-band activity in
the HPC after active rTMS were associated with depressive alle-
viation (Figures 4F and 4G).

The OFC-HPC circuit mediates depression alleviation

To dissect how hippocampal activation (i.e., HPC-SCD) was
modiﬁed following active rTMS treatment, we constructed a
structural equation model. This approach enables us to simulta-
neously evaluate the direct DLPFC-HPC pathway and the indi-
rect pathway. As shown in Figures 5A and 5B, only in the active
treatment group was the direct effect of DLPFC changes on HPC

changes no longer signiﬁcant after OFC
changes were included into the model
(c0 = (cid:1)0.18, p > 0.05), while the indirect
pathway mediated by OFC changes was
signiﬁcant (a = 0.62, b = (cid:1)0.57, both
p < 0.001). Moreover, we conducted
these analyses on each frequency and
the mediated effects were
found that
reserved in low-frequency bands, such
as delta/theta/alpha (Table S3). Together
with the ﬁnding that only the delta
changes over HPC activation were found to associate with
depressive alleviation, we infer that delta oscillations play a
particular role in the normalization of the pathway (Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION

The present study uncovered that DLPFC-OFC-HPC circuitry
underlies rTMS treatment-induced depression relief. The results
identiﬁed distinct neurophysiological features as reduced local
excitability at both sensor (P60/N100, LMFA-AUC) and source
in patients with MDD when
levels (lDLPFC, OFC, HPC)
compared with HC subjects. The functional connectivity be-
tween the lDLPFC and OFC was lower in patients with MDD
than in HC subjects. The lDLPFC-targeted rTMS treatment led
to increased OFC activity, which contributed to the normalization
of HPC activity and depression alleviation. These results there-
fore support network-based modulation in rehabilitating the
depression brain and indicated the OFC as a potentially new
target for brain stimulation therapy against MDD.

rTMS increased regional excitability in patients with
MDD

Previous studies have indicated lDLPFC hypoactivity in patients
with MDD compared with HC subjects.29–31 Consistent with
these results, we found that patients with MDD showed lower
prefrontal excitability measured with P60/N100 and LMFA-AUC
at a sensor level, as well as reduced lDLPFC and OFC activities
at a source level. Furthermore, the incorporation of LMFA-AUC
and OFC activation signiﬁcantly improved the prediction perfor-
mance for distinguishing patients with MDD from HCs, suggest-
ing that prefrontal abnormality served as a critical diagnostic fac-
tor. Moreover, our ﬁndings additionally showed decreased HPC
activity for patients with MDD compared with HCs, supporting
the functional impairment of the HPC in patients with MDD.12,15

OPEN ACCESS

Following active rTMS treatment, although lDLPFC, OFC, and
HPC activities were detected to increase, only OFC excitability
was signiﬁcantly enhanced when compared against the sham
treatment group. Notably, although the DLPFC and PPC belong
to the executive control network,12,32 increased activity was
solely observed in the DLPFC but not in the PPC. These ﬁndings
provide converging evidence supporting that DLPFC-targeted
rTMS could normalize the widespread impaired regions rather
than increasing global excitability.

rTMS induced changes in different circuits in patients
with MDD

To investigate how the activity in the HPC was altered by rTMS
treatment, we proposed two hypotheses. One hypothesis is
that rTMS acts by a direct pathway of the DLPFC-HPC circuit,
and the other hypothesis is that rTMS acts by an indirect
pathway. To test them, we used SCS and SEM to measure func-
tional connectivity between ROIs. The baseline analysis on SCS
showed that DLPFC-OFC connectivity in patients with MDD was
impaired before rTMS treatment, as there was a decreased con-
nectivity from the stimulated site to the OFC in patients with MDD
compared with HCs. This ﬁnding was consistent with previous
research that found that DLPFC-OFC connectivity was associ-
ated with depressive severity.33 In contrast, the connectivity be-
tween the lDLPFC and HPC was not signiﬁcant between the two
groups, suggesting that DLPFC-HPC connectivity was intact in
patients with MDD. Following active rTMS treatment, scanning
electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that the relationship
between changes in lDLPFC activity and changes in HPC activity
was fully mediated by changes in OFC activity. More speciﬁcally,
further analysis on each frequency showed that these alterations
were mainly driven by low-band oscillations, such as delta,
theta, and alpha. These ﬁndings altogether supported the hy-
pothesis that lDLPFC-targeted rTMS could normalize wide-
spread circuits.

It is worth noting that while the ROIs analyzed in the current
study are preselected, it does not mean that the OFC would be
the sole mediator affecting HPC excitability. It remains possible
that the sgACC and amygdala, with a known role in the patho-
physiology and treatment of MDD, may also be involved in
altered neural circuits, given that these regions have both
afferent and efferent connections with the OFC and HPC.34,35
To explore this, we additionally included the sgACC or the amyg-
dala in the follow-up analysis. We found that the tendency of
HPC activation via the alteration of the OFC-sgACC/amygdala
pathway was reserved for both active and sham rTMS groups,
which is more likely to be accounted by the effect of antidepres-
sants but not rTMS alone. Therefore, further studies should
further justify the roles of these regions in the OFC-HPC pathway
and investigate whether there are other regions or neural net-
works engaged in the altered circuit.

Notably, although our primary ﬁndings support the alteration
of an indirect circuit following rTMS, they do not fully exclude
the existence of a direct pathway. For example, the increase in
gamma activity over the lDLPFC may directly affect gamma
changes in the HPC (Table S3). Given that the increase in gamma
activity over the HPC was not signiﬁcant in our study, the direct
pathway should be treated carefully and further tested in future

study. Besides, our ﬁndings were limited to stimulation of the
F3 electrode. Further studies are needed to ﬁnd whether there
exists an optimal entry target over the DLPFC that can directly
modulate the HPC in patients with MDD.

To summarize, our ﬁndings supported that rTMS ameliorated
depression through the alteration of the OFC-HPC network, partic-
ularly in low-frequency bands. Since the OFC is the primary region
reacting to reward values,25,36 our ﬁndings suggest that depres-
sion might be improved by reward-guided memory retrieval.
More importantly, the OFC might be an ideal alternative target
for treating depression, as proposed by other studies.30,37,38

Indicators to track clinical assessments

Patients with MDD with higher LMFA-AUC were associated with
less depression severity. The greater the increase in LMFA-AUC,
the greater the clinical improvement, which was not speciﬁc to
active rTMS treatment. Given that antidepressants were used in
both rTMS treatment groups, it is likely that the correlation could
be partially explained as the general effect of the medication. This
suspicion was in line with previous ﬁndings that antidepressants
increased activity in the DLPFC,39,40 thereby increasing engage-
ment of its regulatory function. Unlike LMFA-AUC, which tracked
HAMD changes regardless of treatment, changes in lDLPFC-
gamma/HPC-delta activity were found to be associated with
HAMD changes in patients with MDD who received active, but
not sham, rTMS treatment. These ﬁndings further indicated that
the effect of medication and rTMS on relieving depression could
be measured by changes in LMFA-AUC and oscillatory alter-
ations over the lDLPFC/HPC, respectively.

Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that antidepressants and
rTMS act in distinct ways. Antidepressants have been reported
to reverse the abnormal HPC.25 In this study, the authors
compared two groups of healthy ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients
with MDD who took antidepressants or placebo. Although the
targeting group is different from our study, this ﬁnding suggests
a potential role of the effect of medication in HPC recovery. A
plausible account for the failure of replicating antidepressants’
effects in the current study might be that all recruited patients
with MDD took antidepressants before and during the rTMS
treatment. This may lead to underestimation in the role of the
medication in treating depression.

Limitations of the study

This study does have certain limitations. First, patients with MDD
took antidepressants during the period of receiving rTMS treat-
ment. Thus, the improvement of depressive symptoms was an
outcome of a combination of medication and rTMS therapy. To
control the effect of medication, all recruited patients took homo-
geneous antidepressants, and the patients were randomly allo-
cated to the active or sham rTMS treatment group. Therefore,
the difference of the treatment effect between active and sham
groups could be mainly contributed to the rTMS effect. It should
be noted that the effect of combining two therapies might be
more effective than just taking one of them,41 and thus the role of
medication in the current study could be underestimated. Another
limitation is related to the possible contamination of TMS-evoked
neurophysiological responses by auditory components. As in pre-
vious studies,42,43 to avoid auditory stimulation, all participants

Article

wore earphones with noise masking. Nevertheless, it is difﬁcult to
rule out the contribution of sensory stimulation in the measure-
ment. Future work could apply more effective noise-masking pro-
cedures44 to minimize the confounding effect. Furthermore, as
previously mentioned, the preselection of ROIs may conceal other
regions/networks/oscillations that were involved in the alteration
process. Future study could tap into additional possibilities based
on a larger dataset, such as adopting a data-driven approach
across the whole brain45 or examining alpha asymmetry as a
gender-speciﬁc biomarker for predicting MDD treatment.46,47

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS

A total of 74 MDD patients were recruited at Ningbo Kangning Hospital. All patients were independently diagnosed by two psychi-
atrists based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) and met the following inclusion criteria: (1) age
18–65; (2) Hamilton Depression Scale-24 score (HAMD-24) R 20 points; (3) taking escitalopram consistently, with no changes to the
medication during intervention; (4) no history of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), TMS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),
transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), or other neurostimulation treatments within the past 3 months. Exclusion criteria
included: (1) a history of alcohol dependence, neurological disorders and other complicated mental illnesses; (2) a history of epilepsy,
or a recent EEG evidence of epileptic waves; (3) the presence of cardiac pacemakers or intracranial metal implants.

The criteria for loss of participants were: (1) discontinuation from the efﬁcacy analysis if the patient did not receive treatment for 2
consecutive or more than 2 cumulative times; (2) serious adverse effects during treatment. Finally, resulting in a ﬁnal sample of 53
MDD patients (age = 30.30 ± 13.96, 18 males, see Figure S1 for details).

A group of 64 healthy control subjects (age = 33.08 ± 9.40, 23 males) were recruited from the society and matched the MDD pa-
tients’ group in terms of gender, age, education and has the HAMD-24 score lower than 7. All participants understood experimental
procedures and signed the informed consent.

The study has been approved by the ethics committee of medical research at Ningbo Kangning Hospital, and all experimental pro-
cedures were carried out following the guidelines of human medical research (Declaration of Helsinki). The intervention part of the
study has been registered on the chictr.org.cn website (ChiCTR2100052007).

METHOD DETAILS

Acquisition and preprocessing of TMS-EEG data

The TMS-EEG study was performed using a 64-channel EEG cap with TMS-compatible Ag/AgCl electrodes (Easycap, Germany).
FCz and AFz served as recording reference and ground electrode, respectively. EEG signals were recorded at a sampling rate of

25 kHz using BrainVision Recorder software (BrainProducts, Germany). Electrode impedances were regularly checked and kept
below 5 kU throughout the recording. During TMS-EEG recording, stimulation was placed over the F3 electrode at 100% RMT in-
tensity. A total of 100 single TMS pulses were delivered at this site while participants remained at rest with their eyes open. To reduce
auditory evoked potentials related to the TMS click, noise masking was used throughout the data acquisition. An overview of the
experimental procedure is provided in Figure 1A.

TMS-EEG data were analyzed ofﬂine using MATLAB R2016b (The Mathwoks, USA) and incorporating the EEGLAB48 and ARTIST49
toolboxes. The preprocessing code was adapted from a fully automated artifact rejection algorithm for single pulse TMS-EEG
(spTMS-EEG), which contains following steps. The time window containing TMS-pulse artifact was ﬁrstly removed and replaced
with the cubic interpolation ((cid:1)5–15ms). EEG data were then downsampled to 1kHz to reduce ﬁle size. After data segmentation
with respect to the TMS pulse ((cid:1)2000–2000 ms), big decay artifacts were automatically removed using the ﬁrst ICA based on thresh-
olding. Slow drifts and high-frequency noise were bandpass (1-100Hz) ﬁltered. The 50Hz AC line noise artifact was removed by a
notch ﬁlter (48-52Hz). Bad trials with signal amplitude outside 3 standard deviations the trial average were rejected. Bad channels
were identiﬁed and interpolated by adjacent channels. Remaining artifact such as scalp muscle artifact and ocular artifacts were
automatically removed using the second ICA. Cleaned EEG Data were then re-referenced to the common average and corrected
to the pre-TMS pulse baseline ((cid:1)550ms to (cid:1)50ms).

Sensor level analysis

We selected for each participant the ﬁve neighboring EEG channels (F1, F3, F5, FC3, AF3) where signals had the largest response to
TMS pulse. Four TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) components: P30 (25-35ms), P60 (50-70ms), N100 (80-120ms), and P180
(160-200ms) were studied due to their high reproducibility for DLPFC stimulation and in accordance with the literature.26–28 Average
amplitude within each component period and their ratio values were calculated for statistics. Local mean ﬁeld amplitude (LMFA) has
previously been used by Pellicciari et al.52 to assess motor excitability in healthy participants. It was calculated using the equation
adapted from Lehmann and Skrandies53:

LMFA-AUC was calculated by summation of LMFA amplitude within a certain time window after TMS pulse. It represents local

brain activity induced by TMS and therefore could be interpreted as an index of cortical excitation.54

Source localization and ROIs analysis
Source localization was performed using FieldTrip50 toolbox and custom scripts. A BEM (boundary element headmodel) was used
based on a template aligned with EEG electrode locations. A source grid model with 8-mm spacing and 7452 grid points was deﬁned
in source space. The pre-stimulus period of individual trials (-500-0 ms) was used to calculate the noise covariance. Source activities
were identiﬁed using a Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamformer, where we calculated a common LCMV ﬁlter for
pre- and post-stimulus period (-500-500 ms) together per participant. This common ﬁlter was then used to transform the participants’
sensor signals into source space.

Signiﬁcant current density (SCD) is a standardization measure that evaluate regional excitability in response to TMS. It is calculated
using the following equation adapted from methods described in the literature by Casali et al.55: SCD (x,t) = SS (x,t) 3 |Jnorm (x,t)|, in
which Jnorm is averaged post-stimulus time series at source level normalized by subtracting the mean pre-stimulus value and
dividing by pre-stimulus variance. SS (x, t) is a binary matrix of signiﬁcant sources across the brain at each time point. It was calcu-
lated by random permutation tests of pre- and post-stimulus periods, estimated from 1000 permuted sets with a signiﬁcant level
alpha = 0.01.

Signiﬁcant oscillatory envelope (SOE) further identiﬁes which frequency bands of neural oscillations contributes to regional excit-
ability evoked by TMS. Similar to SCD, SOE was calculated using the equation: SOE(x,t) = SS (x,t) 3 Znorm (x,t), in which Znorm (x,t)
was calculated as the absolute values of the complex signals for a speciﬁc frequency band after the Hilbert transform. Five frequency
bands: delta (1-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-30Hz), and gamma (30-50Hz) were separated decomposed using fourth-
order Butterworth bandpass ﬁlter.

For region of interest (ROI) analysis in source space, we used anatomical masks provided by the automated anatomical labeling
(AAL3) atlas.51 Except for lDLPFC (labeled as Frontal_Mid_2_L), the following bilateral masks were included: OFC: ‘OFCant_L’, ‘OF-
Cant_R’, Hippocampus: ‘Hippocampus_L’, ‘Hippocampus_R’, and PPC: ‘Parietal_Sup_L’, ‘Parietal_Sup_R’.

Neural network analysis

Signiﬁcant current scattering (SCS) is a standardization measure for inferring activation propagation. SCS measures the effective
connectivity of a source relative to the stimulation site. It was calculated using the equation: SCS = SS (x, t) 3 d(x – xstim), in which
d (x – xstim) was calculated as the distance of every source voxel from site of stimulation (i.e., F3).55 The coordinate (MNI: x = (cid:1)36, y =
26, z = 42) for calculating SCS was determined by identifying the point with the maximum value over lDLPFC using the average data
from healthy controls.

Unlike SCS, linear structure equation model (SEM) enables us to measure indirect interactions among multiple regions simulta-
neously.56 Changes in activities between pre- and post-rTMS treatment served as variables to test how neural circuits were modiﬁed
by active or sham rTMS treatment, respectively.

rTMS treatment

74 MDD patients were randomly divided into active- and sham-treatment groups according to a computer-generated random num-
ber list with a ratio of 1:1. All operators, evaluators and patients were blinded to the group allocation. Twenty-eight of 37 patients
(age = 27.93 ± 12.86, 11 males) in the active treatment group and 25 of 37 patients (age = 32.96 ± 14.89, 7 males) in the sham treat-
ment group completed the two-week intervention (also see Figure S1).

High-frequency rTMS (10Hz) was delivered to left DLPFC utilizing Magstim Rapid2 TMS stimulator (Magstim Ltd, Oxford, UK) at
110% resting motion threshold (RMT) intensity. RMT was determined as the lowest stimulation intensity eliciting R 50 mV MEPs in 5
out of 10 successive trials.57 Patients received a treatment session every day for a total of ten consecutive weekdays58. Each session
consisted of 1800 pulses. The stimulation target of left DLPFC was positioned at F3 electrode implemented in an international 10/20
system. This location approximates the scalp region overlying the left DLPFC and can be used to estimate this area when MRI co-
registration is not available.29 In the sham treatment group, we used a sham coil (D70 Air Film Coil, Magstim) and placed it over the left
DLPFC while keeping parameters unchanged, which enable to produce the vibration and sound identical to the real stimulation in the
active treatment group, but without therapeutic effect.

At baseline and 2 weeks after treatment, HAMD-24, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index (PSQI) were used to evaluate patients’ depressive, anxiety and sleep quality, respectively. Assessments were conducted by
specialized scale raters who were unaware of which intervention the patients received.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All statistical analysis was conducted using R software. c2 tests were used for categorical variables. For continuous variables, two-
sample t tests were used when comparing baseline (i.e., HC vs. MDD) or treatment (i.e., Active vs. Sham) conditions, but Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was used if the normality assumption was not satisﬁed. Paired-sample t tests were used for comparing pre- and
post rTMS treatment in MDD patients. To identify the time window that differs between two groups, we applied the cluster-based
permutation tests based on 1000 re-sampling. To identify TMS-EEG indicators contributing to clinical diagnosis, we used stepwise
logistic regression model to classify healthy controls versus MDD patients. The model with the highest ROC-AUC was regarded as
the best model. Pearson correlation was used to quantify the association of EEG signals and clinical assessments. Unless speciﬁcally
noted, statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05 and all tests were 2-tailed. The data that support the ﬁndings of this study are avail-
able from the corresponding author, upon reasonable request.
