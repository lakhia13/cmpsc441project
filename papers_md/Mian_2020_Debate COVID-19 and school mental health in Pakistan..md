Pakistan

Pakistan has one of the world’s largest youth population,
with 63% of Pakistanis now under the age of 30 (UN Pop-
ulation Fund Report 2017). Experts believe that this
demographic division may have been one of the principal
reasons behind the relatively low severity of COVID-19
morbidity and mortality experienced in the country,
compared with similar and neighbouring nations. Given
the complicated socioeconomic fabric of the population,
with a signiﬁcant percentage being daily wage workers,
the government had responded early on with mandatory
‘smart’ lockdown, and to date, while businesses have
slowly opened, schools and other educational institu-
tions remain physically closed.

On the other hand, COVID-19 response measures
such as self-isolation, social distancing, lockdown of
communities leading to limited access to preventive care
in primary care settings, poorer economic conditions,
restricted travel and delayed vaccination schedules, as
well as school closures, have further compounded poor
health conditions for young children, especially in low-
and middle-income countries (LAMICs) such as Pakistan
(Chandir, Siddiqi, Setayesh, & Khan, 2020). Prepan-
demic, Pakistan already had the world’s second highest
number of out-of-school children (OOSC) with an esti-
mated 22.8 million children aged 5–16 not attending
school, representing 44% of the total population in this
age group (NEMIS-AEPAM, 2018). Mandatory school clo-
sures have further compounded the already existing
sociocultural issues that keep children out of school,
thus further widening the disparity gap.

The provision of education in Pakistan is not univer-
sal. Education in Pakistan is delivered by public/govern-
ment sector (62%) and private (38%)
institutions.
Government schools are present in most districts across
the country, but the quality of education in most of these
is not at par with private sector institutes (NEMIS-
AEPAM, 2018), and many are ‘ghost’ schools, with empty
buildings standing. This gap then is largely ﬁlled by the
private sector, largely established in urban centres and
some of
the large villages (NEMIS-AEPAM, 2018).
Recently, there has been a new conversation by the gov-
ernment about reducing the fragmentation and inequal-
ities and creating a modernized uniform education
system. However, given the vast economic, linguistic,
cultural and religious disparities between Pakistan’s
diverse regions, it would be particularly challenging to
teach students in remote rural and urban areas the
same curriculum. Children, mainly those from disad-
vantaged backgrounds, do not access schools due to

various barriers, including poverty, distances to schools
with no transportation facilities, nonavailability of
schools and high dropout rates due to lack of awareness
for the value of education (NEMIS-AEPAM, 2018).

After ‘smart’ lockdown in the country, the Ministry of
Federal Education and Professional Training published
a national education response and resilience plan (K-12)
for COVID-19 (Ministry of Federal Education & Techni-
cal Training, 2020). The framework aimed to ensure con-
tinuity of learning for all children identiﬁed a range of
technology-based education interventions to support
learners and set a policy action to develop, implement
and expand Alternative Learning Pathways for children
who fall behind due to closures or being out of school.
Based on the report, during the pandemic, various vir-
tual educational platforms were utilized to pursue edu-
cational Sustainable Development Goal 4 (NEMIS-
AEPAM, 2018). The government initiated the delivery of
curricular content for K-12 via the educational television
channel, TeleSchool, which started its broadcast in
April. The channel launched with the slogan ‘education
at home’ and aims to provide education for grades one
through 12, through a set timetable; the broadcast runs
from 8 am to 6 pm, with 30-min slots for each class.

After a short hiatus of planning, most of the private
sector schools moved towards some level of online
modality of education. The content, quality and method-
ology of online ediﬁcation though have been highly vari-
able across institutions, given that most schools and
teachers were not familiar with the use of online technol-
ogy for teaching and learning. This has led to consider-
able uncertainty for both teachers and learners, and
there was an increased perception of stress reported by
teachers in preliminary surveys. Student promotions to
next academic year, especially for higher grades, were
either cancelled or moved to predicted grades based on
prepandemic face-to-face sessions, causing increased
anxiety amongst those applying for colleges and higher
education institutions. Given that all schools were
closed, some of the government school buildings, men-
tioned above as the ghost schools, were now allocated as
isolation and quarantine centres.

Similar to adults, the unprecedented nature of the
pandemic has imposed multifaceted burdens on chil-
dren and adolescents as well. These have been observed
at the individual, familial and communal levels. The
challenges include feelings of isolation, social contact
restrictions, economic shutdown, closure of schools and
out-of-home leisure time activities. Parents are asked to

support their children with homeschooling, while work-
ing from home, with minimal to no external support by
other family members and social support systems. This
could easily result in emotional distress, mental health
problems and violence (Fegert, Vitiello, Plener, & Cle-
mens, 2020). In the context of COVID-19, when access
to therapeutic and allied health services is severely dis-
rupted, the situation has intensiﬁed difﬁculties for chil-
dren who were not well-adjusted in schools and those
who were seeking specialized help. For parents of chil-
dren with special needs, the school also represented a
source of respite that is now no longer available, increas-
ing not just parental stress but also the risk of child
abuse.

It has become evident that the impact of school clo-
sures is far beyond the schools. In a rapid needs assess-
ment nationwide, on the question of barriers to
education during the lockdown, 89% reported that clo-
sure of school had affected children’s education, 4%
reported inability to pay the children school fee, and
38% reported that children do not have textbooks and
other learning materials for continuing their education
(IRC, 2020). The continued closure of schools may fur-
ther widen the gap between the expected years of school-
ing and adjusted years of schooling, potentially
increasing dropout rates and, subsequently, the number
of out-of-school children. Educational technology inter-
ventions can become a burden to the communities with-
out considering how to support the technology, time,
money and skills available to ensure the sustainability,
cost-effectiveness of
the programme, accessibility,
equality and integration of children with disabilities.
These barriers may exacerbate pre-existing divides mag-
nifying the existing rural–urban, gender and socioeco-
nomic divide with the potential
to increase the
prevalence of child labour both in the short run and in
the long run.

Following the global trend of reopening schools for the
fall semester, and given a steady improvement in the
COVID-19 situation in the country, the Government of
Pakistan has also issued a recommendation for a graded
reopening of schools. One can anticipate that returning
to school after the extended quarantine may bring its
own stressors and anxiety. Students, now used to a rela-
tively unstructured routine, may have difﬁculty with
restarting the routine of going to school and may have to
re-learn behaviours that were disrupted. The return may
need an intentional effort to ensure student’s engage-
ment and to prevent a predicted rise in school dropouts.
The World Bank (2020) has outlined three scenarios of
learning losses that governments should prepare
for when schools reopen: 1) a loss of learning for all stu-
dents due to school disruptions; 2) widening disparity
with lowest performing children falling further behind
while the well-performing children moving ahead – pre-
dicted based on the availability of resources; and 3)
increase in the number of school dropouts especially in
lower-income households. Government schools in Pak-
istan are likely to ﬁnd themselves facing the second sce-
nario of disparities in student performance and a risk of
an increase in the number of children dropping out of
school, as in the third scenario outlined by the World
Bank. In the backdrop of these challenges, it is crucial

to collaborate with schools and ensure healthy and safe
return for children to schools.

School mental health (SMH) is becoming an increasing
priority in CAMH service models as an effective and
viable way of disseminating awareness, mental health
literacy and services. Schools vary in the way they
address mental health problems based on their socioe-
conomic status, geography, political stability, religion
and culture. SMH initiatives have been proposed by
international organizations. However, due to the
methodological and contextual limitations in countries
such as Pakistan, these initiatives have been challenging
to implement. These limitations include a severe short-
age of CAMH professionals and lack of availability of
resources and skills to conﬁrm screening results, con-
duct risk assessment and develop referral pathways fol-
lowing the screening, as well as minimal availability and
the nonaffordability of the cost of the subsequent inter-
vention. Other barriers include lack of organizational
infrastructure and
focus,
processes for sustainable implementation,
limited
access to evidence-based information, insufﬁcient fund-
ing and lack of knowledge and comfort in supporting
student mental health.

foundational commitment,

With a dearth of current published empirical studies,
much of the literature has been drawn from previous
research evidence on school closures due to previous
pandemics. To adequately address the establishment of
SMH programmes, countries may need to look at what
resources they have at hand, and how they can be opti-
mized. Given that the pandemic would have increased
the mental health-related concerns, schools need to
focus on areas of nurturing resilience in children and
adolescents by better communication to address their
fears and concerns, encouraging routines and physical
activities, and taking measures to alleviate loneliness.
Parents need to look after their mental health, coping
strategies and model positive psychological attitude to
support children and adolescents.

Students’ mental and physical health will need explicit
support in the return to everyday life. The role of govern-
ments is vital in mitigating the disruptive impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on education delivery and out-
comes. Top priorities for action as schools reopen would
include (OECD, 2020):

(cid:129) Ensuring safety: school buildings must be disin-
fected, and adequate ventilation of classrooms
ensured in an ongoing manner.

(cid:129) Assessing progress and mitigating the impact of
learning losses: diagnostic formative assessment of
all students will be needed to help plan and organize
their learning.

(cid:129) Targeted learning support will be needed, especially
for the most vulnerable. Efforts to address learning
loss must avoid creating traps for the disadvantaged,
for example large-scale grade repetition.

(cid:129) Ensuring well-being: many students will experience
emotional distress from the pandemic, ranging from
anxiety to post-traumatic stress symptoms. Some
students will have lacked physical activity during
conﬁnement.
