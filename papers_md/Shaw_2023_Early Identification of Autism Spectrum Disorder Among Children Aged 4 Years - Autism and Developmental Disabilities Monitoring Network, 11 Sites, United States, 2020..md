Abstract

Problem/Condition: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Period Covered: 2020.
Description of System: The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network is an active surveillance program that 
estimates prevalence and characteristics of ASD and monitors timing of ASD identification among children aged 4 and 8 years. In 
2020, a total of 11 sites (located in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, 
Utah, and Wisconsin) conducted surveillance of ASD among children aged 4 and 8 years and suspected ASD among children 
aged 4 years. Surveillance included children who lived in the surveillance area at any time during 2020. Children were classified as 
having ASD if they ever received 1) an ASD diagnostic statement in an evaluation, 2) a special education classification of autism 
(eligibility), or 3) an ASD International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code (revisions 9 or 10). Children aged 4 years were classified 
as having suspected ASD if they did not meet the case definition for ASD but had a documented qualified professional’s statement 
indicating a suspicion of ASD. This report focuses on children aged 4 years in 2020 compared with children aged 8 years in 2020.
Results: For 2020, ASD prevalence among children aged 4 years varied across sites, from 12.7 per 1,000 children in Utah to 46.4 
in California. The overall prevalence was 21.5 and was higher among boys than girls at every site. Compared with non-Hispanic 
White  children,  ASD  prevalence  was  1.8  times  as  high  among  Hispanic,  1.6  times  as  high  among  non-Hispanic  Black,  1.4 
times as high among Asian or Pacific Islander, and 1.2 times as high among multiracial children. Among the 58.3% of children 
aged 4 years with ASD and information on intellectual ability, 48.5% had an IQ score of ≤70 on their most recent IQ test or 
an examiner’s statement of intellectual disability. Among children with a documented developmental evaluation, 78.0% were 
evaluated by age 36 months. Children aged 4 years had a higher cumulative incidence of ASD diagnosis or eligibility by age 48 
months compared with children aged 8 years at all sites; risk ratios ranged from 1.3 in New Jersey and Utah to 2.0 in Tennessee. 
In the 6 months before the March 2020 COVID-19 pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization, there were 1,593 
more evaluations and 1.89 more ASD identifications per 1,000 children aged 4 years than children aged 8 years received 4 years 
earlier. After the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, this pattern reversed: in the 6 months after pandemic onset, there were 217 
fewer evaluations and 0.26 fewer identifications per 1,000 children aged 4 years than children aged 8 years received 4 years earlier. 
Patterns of evaluation and identification varied among sites, but there was not recovery to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels by 
the end of 2020 at most sites or overall. For 2020, prevalence of suspected ASD ranged from 0.5 (California) to 10.4 (Arkansas) 
per 1,000 children aged 4 years, with an increase from 2018 at five sites (Arizona, Arkansas, Maryland, New Jersey, and Utah). 
Demographic and cognitive characteristics of children aged 4 years with suspected ASD were similar to children aged 4 years

with ASD.
Interpretation: A wide range of prevalence of ASD by age 4 years 
was observed, suggesting differences in early ASD identification 
practices among communities. At all sites, cumulative incidence

improvements in early identification of ASD. Higher numbers of evaluations and rates of identification were evident among 
children aged 4 years until the COVID-19 pandemic onset in 2020. Sustained lower levels of ASD evaluations and identification 
seen at a majority of sites after the pandemic onset could indicate disruptions in typical practices in evaluations and identification 
for health service providers and schools through the end of 2020. Sites with more recovery could indicate successful strategies to 
mitigate service interruption, such as pivoting to telehealth approaches for evaluation.
Public Health Action: From 2016 through February of 2020, ASD evaluation and identification among the cohort of children 
aged 4 years was outpacing ASD evaluation and identification 4 years earlier (from 2012 until March 2016) among the cohort 
of children aged 8 years in 2020 . From 2016 to March 2020, ASD evaluation and identification among the cohort of children 
aged 4 years was outpacing that among children aged 8 years in 2020 from 2012 until March 2016. The disruptions in evaluation 
that coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in prevalence of suspected ASD in 2020 could have 
led to delays in ASD identification and interventions. Communities could evaluate the impact of these disruptions as children in 
affected cohorts age and consider strategies to mitigate service disruptions caused by future public health emergencies.

Introduction
Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  is  a  developmental 
disability  characterized  by  deficits  in  social  interaction  or 
communication  and  the  presence  of  restricted  interests  or 
repetitive  behaviors. The  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics 
recommends that pediatric care providers screen all children 
for  ASD  at  ages  18  and  24  months  in  addition  to  regular 
developmental surveillance (1). Early developmental screening 
and  receipt  of  services  for  children  with  ASD  also  are  core 
national objectives for Healthy People 2030 (2). During early 
childhood, ongoing neurodevelopmental processes present the 
opportunity to optimize children’s ability to develop language 
and social skills (3–5). Early ASD identification is important 
to ensure children have access to services they might need to 
support development of these skills.

The  Autism  and  Developmental  Disabilities  Monitoring 
(ADDM)  Network  has  reported  biennial  ASD  estimates 
since  2000  and  began  tracking  ASD  identification  among 
children  aged  4  years  in  a  subset  of  sites  in  2010  (6).  In 
2018,  surveillance  among  this  age  group  expanded  to  the 
full  ADDM  Network.  New  patterns  in  ASD  prevalence  by 
race and ethnicity emerged, with children from groups with 
historically lower prevalence, including non-Hispanic Black 
and Hispanic children, and children in lower socioeconomic 
status  (SES)  neighborhoods  having  the  highest  prevalence 
(7). Since 2016, comparisons with children aged 8 years have 
shown more early identification of ASD by age 48 months 
among younger cohorts (7,8).

The  2020  surveillance  year  includes  the  COVID-19 
pandemic  declaration  by  the  World  Health  Organization 
in  March  2020  (https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/
situations/covid-19)  and  ensuing  shutdowns  in  the  United 
States.  The  Act  Early  Response  to  COVID-19  project 

performed a rapid needs assessment in 2020, surveying key 
partners  from  early  childhood  programs  and  systems  in  43 
U.S. states and territories. Overall, 91% of the 349 participants 
reported  the  COVID-19  pandemic  had  “highly  impacted” 
early  identification  of  children  with  developmental  delays 
and disabilities (9). Forty-eight percent of these participants 
reported during fall 2020 that the number of children served 
by early childhood programs and systems had decreased since 
the start of the pandemic. The ADDM Network is uniquely 
positioned to provide population-based measures that can show 
disruptions to timely evaluation and identification of ASD.

This report provides data on early ASD identification among 
children  aged  4  years  in  11  U.S.  communities,  including 
prevalence  and  characteristics  of  children  with  ASD  and 
suspected ASD in 2020, and comparisons with children aged 
8 years to show patterns in identification and emergence of 
possible  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic. These  data 
can be used for ongoing monitoring of trends and to support 
efforts to ensure early and equitable identification of children 
with ASD.

Methods

Surveillance Sites and Procedures
ADDM Network sites conducted surveillance of ASD among 
children aged 4 and 8 years and suspected ASD among children 
aged 4 years in 2020 in defined areas of Arizona, Arkansas, 
California,  Georgia,  Maryland,  Minnesota,  Missouri,  New 
Jersey, Tennessee,  Utah,  and  Wisconsin  (Table  1).  All  sites 
functioned  as  public  health  authorities  under  the  Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 Privacy 
Rule  and  met  applicable  local  institutional  review  board, 
privacy, and confidentiality requirements under 45 CFR 46.

Case Ascertainment and 
Surveillance Case Definition
Surveillance was conducted using the same methods as in 
2018 (7,10). All sites had access to health and education records 
in 2020 (11). Nine sites had data agreements in place with 
education sources covering 100% of their study areas, Missouri 
had agreements with education data sources covering 50.3%, 
and Georgia with education data sources covering 97.6% of 
its study area. Maryland, Utah, and Wisconsin had access to 
Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act  (IDEA)  Part  C 
early intervention data. Arizona, California, and Wisconsin 
also  had  access  to  state-funded  services  such  as  Medicaid 
(https://www.medicaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-12/list-
of-eligibility-groups.pdf ) or disability services programs (11). 
Sites requested health records with International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Classification 
of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) billing codes relevant to 

developmental  disabilities  from  clinical  sources  and  special 
education records with specific special education exceptionality 
codes from school sources to identify children with ASD.

Children aged 4 years in 2020 met the surveillance ASD 
case  definition  if  they  lived  in  the  surveillance  area  at  any 
time in 2020 and they received 1) a written ASD diagnostic 
statement (diagnosis) by a qualified professional, 2) a special 
education  classification  of  ASD  (eligibility),  or  3)  an  ASD 
ICD-9  code  between  299.00  and  299.99  or  ICD-10  code 
in  the  F84  range  (10).  Children  with  an  ICD  code  for 
Rett syndrome (F84.2) and no other indicators of ASD were 
excluded. Children met the suspected ASD case definition if 
they did not meet the criteria for ASD but records contained 
a qualified professional’s statement indicating a suspicion of 
ASD.  Additional  demographic  information,  developmental 
evaluations, special education plans, and IQ assessments were 
collected from records for these children.

Surveillance SummariesUS Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAdditional Data Sources and 
Variable Definitions
The  number  of  children  aged  4  years  living  in  each 
surveillance area was obtained from the U.S. Census vintage 
2021  county-level  single-year-of-age  postcensal  population 
estimates  for  2020  (https://www.census.gov/programs-
surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology.html). 
Surveillance  areas  at  three  sites  (Arizona,  California,  and 
Minnesota) comprised subcounty school districts. For these 
sites, population estimates were adjusted using public school 
enrollment counts (https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/files.asp) of school 
districts included in surveillance areas. Full details are available 
(Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1, https://
stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124396).

When race and ethnicity or sex was missing from records, 
birth  certificate  data  were  used  if  available.  Co-occurring 
intellectual disability was defined as an IQ score of ≤70 on 
the most recent test or an examiner’s statement of intellectual 
disability  in  a  developmental  evaluation.  Evaluation  by 
age  36  months  was  calculated  using  the  earliest  recorded 
developmental  evaluation  (health  or  educational)  for  each 
child.  Earliest  identification  was  defined  as  the  child’s  first 
recorded  ASD  diagnosis  or  special  education  eligibility 
(identification ages for children with only an ICD code were 
not available).

Analytic Methods
ASD prevalence was calculated as the number of children who 
met the ASD surveillance case definition per 1,000 children 
aged  4  years  living  in  the  surveillance  area.  Prevalence  was 
calculated  overall,  by  sex,  and  by  race  and  ethnicity  for 
American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian or Pacific 
Islander (A/PI), Black, White, two or more races (multiracial), 
and Hispanic children. (Persons of Hispanic origin might be of 
any race but are categorized as Hispanic; all racial groups are 
non-Hispanic). Children lacking information on sex (n = 4) 
or  race  (n  =  94)  were  excluded  from  analyses  stratified  by 
those variables. Prevalence estimates with a relative SE ≥30% 
were  suppressed  because  of  limited  statistical  precision. 
Prevalence  ratios  were  used  to  compare  prevalence  by  sex, 
race and ethnicity, and suspected ASD from 2018 to 2020; 
prevalence  ratios  involving  at  least  one  suppressed  estimate 
were likewise suppressed.

Cumulative  incidence  of  ASD  per  1,000  children  was 
calculated by dividing the total number of children aged 4 or 
8 years with an ASD diagnosis or eligibility at each month of 
age by the population denominator for children aged 4 years 
or 8 years in 2020. Diagnosis or eligibility by age 48 months 

6 

MMWR  /  March 24, 2023  /  Vol. 72  /  No. 1

was compared between children aged 4 years and 8 years in 
2020 using risk ratios.

To assess the impact of COVID-19 on patterns of evaluation 
and identification, numbers of evaluations and ages of earliest 
identification were aggregated by calendar month for children 
aged 4 and 8 years in 2020. To compare the same age windows 
by calendar month, the numbers of evaluations and incidence 
of identification from 2012 (year 0) through 2016 (year 4) for 
children aged 8 years was subtracted from the same months 
during 2016 (year 0) through 2020 (year 4) for children aged 
4 years.

The Wilson score method was used to calculate 95% CIs for 
prevalence, prevalence ratios, cumulative incidence, and risk 
ratios. Prevalence and risk ratios were considered significant 
when  95%  CIs  did  not  include  1.0. The  male-to-female 
prevalence ratio among children aged 4 years was compared 
among sites, between years, and with the ratio among children 
aged 8 years (11) using the Mantel-Haenszel test of homogeneity. 
Chi-square tests or Fisher tests were used to compare differences 
in distributions between groups for analyses of co-occurring 
intellectual  disability,  evaluation  by  age  36  months,  and 
having confirmed versus suspected ASD. Mantel-Haenszel and 
chi-square tests were considered significant when the p value 
was <0.05. R software (version 4.2.0; R Foundation) was used 
for data analysis and visualizations.

Results

Prevalence and Characteristics of Children 
Aged 4 Years with ASD
For 2020, prevalence ranged from 12.7 per 1,000 children 
aged  4  years  in  Utah  to  46.4  in  California  (Table  1).  ASD 
prevalence in the 11 sites combined was 21.5 per 1,000 (one 
in 46) children aged 4 years. Overall, 80.2% of children who 
met the ADDM Network case definition had a recorded ASD 
diagnosis (range = 54.1%–98.3%) (Figure 1) (Supplementary 
Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124396), 38.1% had 
a recorded ASD eligibility (range = 9.3%–75.1%), and 79.4% 
had a recorded ASD ICD code (range = 22.0%–92.7%). A 
majority of children (74.4%) had more than one component 
of the case definition in their records and 23.3% had all three; 
9.8% had an ASD ICD code only (Figure 1).

Demographics
For 2020, prevalence was 32.3 per 1,000 boys aged 4 years, 
which was 3.1 times as high as among girls (10.4) (Table 2). The 
male-to-female ratio among children aged 4 years was similar 
across sites, but the ratio was lower than among children aged

8 years (11). Prevalence in 2020 among children aged 4 years 
was 24.3% higher among boys and 34.5% higher among girls 
than  prevalence  in  2018  (7),  but  the  male-to-female  ratios 
were similar between years. Among race and ethnicity groups, 
Hispanic children had the highest prevalence of ASD at 28.7 

among  children  aged  4  years,  followed  by  Black  children 
(25.3), A/PI children (23.5), multiracial children (19.3), White 
children (16.3), and AI/AN children (11.1) (Table 3).

Race  and  ethnicity  patterns  in  prevalence  were  mostly 
consistent across sites. Compared with White children, ASD 
prevalence  was  higher  among  Black  children  at  nine  sites 
(overall  1.6  times  as  high),  Hispanic  children  at  seven  sites 
(overall 1.8 times as high), A/PI children at six sites (overall 
1.4 times as high), and multiracial children at two sites (overall 
1.2 times as high) (Table 3). Prevalence among AI/AN children 
was similar to White children, but Black, Hispanic, A/PI, and 
multiracial children had an ASD prevalence 2.3, 2.6, 2.1, and 
1.7 times as high as AI/AN children, respectively.

Co-Occurring Intellectual Disability
Overall, 58.3% of children had information on intellectual 
ability  available  (range  =  38.6%  in Wisconsin  to  89.8%  in 
Arkansas) (Table 4). A/PI and multiracial children were more 
likely to have information on intellectual disability available 
(67% and 71.2% with information) than White (57.1%) and 
Black children (56.4%).

Among  children  with  data  on  intellectual  ability,  48.5% 
of children with ASD met the surveillance case definition of 
having co-occurring intellectual disability (range = 24.7% in 
California to 67.3% in Arkansas). The percentage was similar 
between boys (49.2%) and girls (46.2%) with ASD (Table 4), 
and among White, Hispanic, A/PI, and multiracial children 
with ASD (43%, 44.7%, 49.4%, and 40.5%, respectively). 
Black children with ASD had a higher percent of co-occurring 
intellectual  disability  than  other  groups  at  62.7%.  Fewer 
children had information about intellectual ability available at

(11),  but  a  higher  percentage  of  children  with  information 
available met the surveillance case definition for intellectual 
disability among children aged 4 years (48.5%) compared with 
children aged 8 years (37.9%).

First Evaluation
Among children with ASD with a developmental evaluation, 
78% were evaluated by age 36 months, with variability across 
sites ranging from 66.7% in Tennessee to 87.8% in Arkansas 
(Table  5).  Evaluation  by  age  36  months  was  similar  by  sex 
and by racial and ethnic groups except for being lower among 
Black  (75.9%)  compared  with  Hispanic  (79.8%)  children. 
Similar percentages of children with and without co-occurring 
intellectual disability were evaluated by age 36 months (82.4% 
and  85.1%),  but  the  percentage  was  lower  among  children 
without intellectual ability information (68.5%).

Cumulative Incidence of ASD Diagnosis 
or Eligibility Compared with 
Children Aged 8 Years
Children  aged  4  years  had  1.6  times  higher  cumulative 
incidence of ASD diagnosis or eligibility by age 48 months than 
children aged 8 years in 2020 (17.5 per 1,000 children compared 
with 11.2) (Figure 2) (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/124396). This pattern was consistent across 
sites, ranging from 1.3 times as high in New Jersey and Utah 

8 

MMWR  /  March 24, 2023  /  Vol. 72  /  No. 1

to 2.0 times as high in Tennessee (Supplementary Figure 2, 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124396).

Evaluation and Identification During 
COVID-19 Pandemic Onset
From 2016 through February 2020, children aged 4 years 
in  2020  had  more  evaluations  and  identifications  than  the 
cohort aged 8 years in 2020 had during 2012–2016. In the 
6  months  before  the  COVID-19  pandemic  declaration  in 
March  2020,  there  were  1,593  more  evaluations  and  1.89 
more ASD identifications per 1,000 children aged 4 years than 
children aged 8 years received 4 years earlier (Supplementary 
Tables 3 and 4, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124396). After 
the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, this pattern reversed: 
In the 6 months after pandemic onset, there were 217 fewer 
evaluations and 0.26 fewer identifications per 1,000 children 
aged 4 years than children aged 8 years received 4 years earlier 
(Figure  3).  Patterns  of  evaluations  and  ASD  identification 
after  pandemic  onset  varied  by  site,  with  certain  sites  (e.g., 
Georgia, Minnesota, and Utah) having sustained declines in 
evaluation and identification through the end of the year, but 
other sites (e.g, Missouri and Tennessee) showing resurgences 
closer to prepandemic levels (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 
and Supplementary Figures 3 and 4, https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/124396).

Prevalence and Characteristics of Children 
Aged 4 Years with Suspected ASD
Prevalence  varied  widely  among  sites  in  the  prevalence 
of  children  with  suspected  ASD  (those  with  a  documented 
qualified  professional’s  statement  indicating  a  suspicion  of 
ASD but without a diagnosis, eligibility, or ICD code), from 
0.5  per  1,000  children  aged  4  years  in  California  to  10.4 
in  Arkansas.),  from  0.5  per  1,000  children  aged  4  years  in 
California  to  10.4  in  Arkansas  (Figure  4)  (Supplementary 
Table 5, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124396). Prevalence 
of suspected ASD increased from 2018 at five sites (Arizona, 
Arkansas, Maryland, New Jersey, and Utah) and was similar 
between years at other sites (7) (Figure 5). Children with ASD 
and  children  with  suspected  ASD  were  similar  by  sex,  race 
and  ethnicity,  intellectual  disability,  and  evaluation  by  age 
36  months  (Supplementary Table  6,  https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/124396).

Discussion
In 2020, ASD identification by age 48 months was higher 
among  children  aged  4  years  than  aged  8  years  at  all  sites, 
indicating progress in early identification across the ADDM 
Network.  Children  aged  4  years  had  consistently  more 
evaluations  and  higher  identification  from  2016  through 
February 2020 than children aged 8 had during 2012–2016. 
Despite the encouraging patterns, a large drop-off in progress 
among  children  aged  4  years  was  evident  beginning  with 
the  pandemic  onset  in  March  2020.  Although  every  site 
experienced  a  period  of  lower  evaluation  and  identification 
among children aged 4 years, certain sites showed movement 
toward  recovery  to  prepandemic  levels. This  could  reflect 
increased  use  of  telehealth  approaches  that  enabled  remote 
evaluation and identification of children with ASD (12–16). 
Sustained decreases also could reflect extended remote learning

through the end of 2020 in certain sites such as in Minnesota, 
where many children are identified in schools (Figure 1).

Suspected ASD was highest in the three states (Utah, Arizona, 
and Arkansas) with the lowest ASD prevalence, and two of 
the three states with the highest prevalence (California and 
Tennessee) had the lowest suspected ASD prevalence. Higher 
levels of suspected ASD could reflect community requirements 
for  ASD  diagnosis.  For  example,  Arkansas  code  required 
agreement  by  three  professionals  in  specified  categories  to 
receive an ASD diagnosis until the code was revised in 2021 
to two “qualified professionals” (17), easing the requirements 
for identification. Suspected ASD prevalence in 2020 increased 
from 2018 at five sites and could be linked to challenges in 
evaluation and follow-up of children suspected of having ASD 
during  the  pandemic.  Because  earlier  identification  could 
lead to better outcomes, follow-up of children suspected but 
not  confirmed  of  having  ASD  could  help  minimize  delays 
in  identification  and  intervention. The  characteristics  of 
children suspected of having ASD were similar to children with 

10 

MMWR  /  March 24, 2023  /  Vol. 72  /  No. 1

ASD, but these comparisons were among children seen for a 
developmental evaluation; disparities in receiving evaluations 
could still exist.

Prevalence among girls surpassed 10 per 1,000 children aged 
4 years for the first time in ADDM Network surveillance (also 
observed among children aged 8 years for the first time) (11). 
A larger increase in prevalence from 2018 for girls compared 
with boys was observed; however, the male-to-female ratio was 
similar across years.

The  higher  prevalence  of  ASD  among  Black,  Hispanic, 
and A/PI versus White children aged 4 years first reported in 
2018 continued in 2020 and also was seen among children 
aged  8  years  (11). This  could  reflect  increased  policy  and 
community  efforts  to  provide  equitable  services  and  access 
to health care for all children. The higher occurrence of ASD 
among these groups possibly suggests higher risk for ASD (e.g., 
perinatal or environmental factors) in populations that were 
previously masked by socioeconomic disparities in accessing 
ASD identification and treatment services. ASD is beginning 
to  be  identified  more  in  lower-SES  groups  than  previously 
(7,11); however, barriers to services still exist for lower-SES 
families of children with ASD (e.g., transportation, childcare, 
and job accommodations) (18–26).

Prevalence of ASD among children aged 4 years increased 
26%, from 17.0 per 1,000 children in 2018 to 21.5 in 2020. 
However, prevalence varied widely across sites in 2020, with 
prevalence 265% higher in California than in Utah, the site 
with  the  lowest  prevalence. This  likely  reflects  community 
factors  influencing  early  ASD  identification.  California 
continued to report high levels of early ASD identification, 
with higher prevalence at age 4 years than 8 years in 2020 (11). 
Local  factors  likely  contribute  to  early  identification  at  the 
California site, such as hundreds of pediatricians participating 
in the Get SET Early model (27) and a state-funded regional 
center  that  provides  evaluations  and  service  coordination 
for persons with disabilities and their families (https://www.
dds.ca.gov).  Variability  in  state-level  procedures  for  early 
intervention also could contribute to differences in prevalence 
among sites. For example, in Maryland, early intervention is 
embedded within the school system, the health department, or 
shared between both (and other agencies such as social services). 
Such variability is likely seen across states and can potentially 
lead to different paths to accessing services.

The  ADDM  Network  will  continue  tracking  ASD 
identification, which might reveal lasting disruption to early 
identification and potential for longer-term impacts among 
children with ASD because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
addition, CDC’s Act Early Initiative promotes collaboration 
among  early  childhood  programs  in  states  and  territories 
so children with autism or other delays and disabilities can

free  developmental  monitoring  tools  in  multiple  languages 
and the Milestone Tracker application to empower parents, 
educators, and health care providers to monitor children’s early 
development and address signs of developmental delay early 
(https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly).

ADDM Network data for 2020 show differences across sites 
that suggest differences in early identification practices or policies. 
These data allow communities to explore barriers to, or success 
with, early identification of ASD for all children. The increases in

identification are encouraging, but there is potential to improve 
early ASD identification in many ADDM Network communities, 
especially considering disruptions to developmental evaluation 
and services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Limitations
The  findings  in  this  report  are  subject  to  at  least  four 
limitations.  First,  surveillance  area  populations  are  not 
necessarily generalizable to the entire state or United States. 
Second,  data  quality  is  dependent  on  data  availability 
and  completeness  of  records  at  data  sources.  For  example, 
demographic  characteristics  reflect  what  is  documented  in 
records; sex and race and ethnicity estimates could be higher 
or lower if administrative records are different from individual 
or family preferences. Third, sites or study areas could change 
between study years, which could complicate comparisons over 
time. The latter is mitigated by comparing ASD identification

between children aged 4 and 8 years in the same study area

definition of intellectual disability is not the same as a clinical 
diagnosis;  IQ  measurements  in  young  children  might  lack 
stability and children might not ultimately receive a diagnosis 
of intellectual disability.

Future Directions
Increasing access to additional data sources, such as Medicaid 
and IDEA Part C early intervention data, continues to be a 
goal of the ADDM Network’s early identification work. Data 
from upstream steps, including screening and referrals, could

Because  the 
COVID-19 pandemic began part way through the surveillance 
year,  future  surveillance  years  could  reveal  the  magnitude 
and  persistence  of  COVID-19  pandemic  effects  on  ASD 
identification in communities.

Conclusion
Findings from the ADDM Network 2020 surveillance year 
include  a  higher  prevalence  of  ASD  among  children  aged 
4  years  than  in  2018.  ASD  prevalence  was  higher  among 
boys compared with girls, and among Hispanic, Black, and 
A/PI  children  compared  with  White  and  AI/AN  children. 
Findings  were  similar  to  2018  by  presence  of  co-occurring 
intellectual  disability  and  evaluation  by  age  36  months. 
The  higher  cumulative  incidence  of  ASD  identification  by 
age 48 months among children aged 4 years compared with 
children aged 8 years indicates more early identification in the 
younger group. Children aged 4 years in 2020 received more 
evaluations  and  ASD  identification  before  the  March  2020 
COVID-19 pandemic declaration than children aged 8 years 
received 4 years earlier. However, after pandemic onset, the 
pattern  reversed,  and  fewer  evaluations  and  identifications 
were  observed  among  children  aged  4  years.  Identification 
of children with suspected ASD also increased at certain sites 
compared with 2018 data. Because of variability in practices 
across  communities,  and  the  unprecedented  disruption  to 
services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding 
factors to recover and improve equitable and timely access to 
early ASD identification and services could improve outcomes 
for children with ASD.
