Objective   Mental health problems such as anxiety, panic, and depression have been exacerbated by the coronavirus disease-2019 (CO-
VID-19). This study aimed to compare the symptom severities and overall function before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among 
patients with panic disorder (PD) seeking treatment compared to healthy controls (HCs).
Methods   Baseline data were collected from the two groups (patients with PD and HCs) in two separate periods: before COVID-19 (Jan 
2016–Dec 2019) and during COVID-19 (Mar 2020–Jul 2022). A total 453 participants (before COVID-19: 246 [139 patients with PD and 
107 HCs], during COVID-19: 207 [86 patients with PD and 121 HCs]) was included. Scales for panic and depressive symptoms and over-
all function were administered. Additionally, network analyses were performed to compare the two groups within the patients with PD. 
Results   The results of two-way analysis of variance analyses showed that patients with PD enrolled during COVID-19 showed higher 
levels of interoceptive fear and lower overall functioning. In addition, a network comparison test revealed that a significantly high strength 
and expected influence for agoraphobia and avoidance in patients with PD during COVID-19.
Conclusion   This study suggested that the overall function could have worsened, and the importance of agoraphobia and avoidance as 
a central symptom may have increased in patients with PD seeking treatment during COVID-19.

atric and neuropsychiatric manifestations, in every facet of 
human life.2 Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future 
precipitated anxiety and stress-related disorders, along with 
the direct effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-
navirus-2 and the subsequent host immunological response on 
the human central nervous system.3

Huge stressors, such as images of older adults and dead bod-
ies shown by the media, social distancing, loss of loved ones 
without seeing them, strong quarantine methods that deprived 
people of freedom, fear of vaccines, and economic crisis with 
unemployment, resulted in significant burden and functional 
impairment in daily life.4,5 Stress, anxiety, and depression were 
prevalent at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak6 as well as 
in non-peak situations.7 Furthermore, distress from uncertainty 
and unpredictability regarding the endpoint of the COVID-19 
pandemic led to mental health issues, such as anxiety, depres-
sion, and panic symptoms.4,5

A recent case report suggested that COVID-19 infection ex-

acerbates existing psychiatric illness and induces panic disor-
der (PD), characterized by recurrent panic attacks, anticipato-
ry anxiety, agoraphobia, and related functional impairment.8,9 
Additionally, another study showed a 3% new incidence of 
PD during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 in 11 countries, 
including the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Czech Re-
public, Finland, India, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Sweden.10
Network analysis can help analyze anxiety symptoms and 
functional decline using different indices, such as edge weight 
and centrality, which focuses on the relationship between symp-
toms and functioning during the COVID-19 outbreak. In a 
cross-sectional network analysis study among nurses, psycho-
logical symptoms, such as irritability, uncontrollable worry, 
trouble relaxing, and depressed mood, had the highest cen-
trality values during the COVID-19 pandemic.11 Furthermore, 
the analysis revealed that sad mood, irritability, worry, and guilt 
formed central symptoms in adolescents during COVID-19.12 
However, these are all cross-sectional studies conducted dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic and are not comparisons be-
tween findings before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Therefore, it is important to conduct research that compares 
the symptoms and functioning of mental health problems be-
fore and during COVID-19.

Therefore, the initial psychological symptoms, functioning, 
and network structures of patients seeking treatment for PD 
at the hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic 
should be compared with those of the healthy control (HC) 
group before and during that period. Thus, the study proposes 
the following hypotheses: 1) the psychological symptoms and 
functioning of patients with PD seeking treatment will differ 
from those of HCs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic 
and 2) the central nodes (psychological symptoms or func-
tional levels) and edge weights during the COVID-19 pan-
demic were different from those before the COVID-19 pan-
demic in patients with PD.

METHODS

Participants

Two cross-sectional studies included 453 Korean participants 
aged 16–75 years, comprising 225 patients with PD and 228 
healthy individuals. We recruited a pool of patients with PD 
who visited the psychiatry outpatient clinic at the CHA Bun-
dang Medical Center in Gyeonggi-do, Korea for the first time 
for diagnosis and treatment, and HCs from the same local 
community through advertisements. Participants’ individual 
and family histories were collected through interviews. 

The first baseline data collection was conducted before the 
COVID-19 pandemic from January 2016 to December 2019. 
Of the 279 initial participants, six HCs were excluded because 

246  Psychiatry Investig  2023;20(3):245-254

they did not meet the inclusion criteria and 27 patients with 
PD who did not satisfy the inclusion criteria were excluded. 
Finally, 246 individuals, including 139 patients with PD and 
107 healthy individuals, participated in the first stage of the 
study. The second baseline data collection was performed dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 2020 to July 2022. 
There were 207 participants, including 86 patients with PD 
and 121 HCs; this was after seven patients with PD and 13 
HCs, who did not satisfy the inclusion criteria of the 227 par-
ticipants, at baseline were excluded (Figure 1). Additionally, 
consistency in data collection was maintained until the end of 
recruitment to achieve homogeneity among all participants. 
Regarding PD, the inclusion criteria were only primary 
patients with PD, with or without agoraphobia, diagnosed by 
practising psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Inter-
view to evaluate the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders, fourth edition, Text Revision Axis I Disorder. 
Moreover, the exclusion criteria for participants with PD in-
cluded any history of past or ongoing anxiety disorders other 
than PD, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, depres-
sive disorders, bipolar disorders, mental retardation, substance-
related disorders, significant medical problems that included 
neurological disorders or brain damage, anaphylactic reactions 
to vaccines, COVID-19 infection, and pregnancy. The exclu-
sion criteria for healthy individuals were as follows: 1) any his-
tory of major psychiatric disorders, 2) patients infected with 
COVID-19 and their families, 3) neurological disorders and 
traumatic brain injury, 4) pregnancy, and 5) person who made 
an unreliable questionnaire report.

All procedures were performed per the recommendations 
and ethics of the Institutional Review Board of the CHA Bun-
dang Medical Center (2019-05-030). The study was explained 
in detail to the participants, following which written informed 
consent was obtained from the latest version of the Declara-
tion of Helsinki. Additionally, principles of good clinical prac-
tice were acquired.

Clinical assessments

The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), Albany Panic and 
Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ), Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI-II), Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised (ASI-R), and 
Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) were used to evaluate anxiety 
and depressive symptom severity and functional impairment 
in all participants.

The PDSS measures the severity of panic symptoms.13 The 
PDSS is a 7-item self-rated measure of PD-specific symptoms, 
including 1) frequency of panic attacks, 2) distress during panic 
attacks, 3) severity of anticipatory anxiety, 4) phobic avoidance 
of situations, 5) phobic avoidance of physical sensation, 6) 
functional impairment in work, and 7) social functional im-

pairment. Responses were scored on a 5-point scale ranging 
from 0 to 4. The Korean version of the PDSS has high reliabil-
ity, validity, and internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.88). 

The APPQ can evaluate agoraphobia, social phobia, and 
interoceptive fear in patients with PD.14 We used the Korean 
version of the APPQ, which showed good internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α=0.95) and high test-retest reliability (r=0.77).15
Additionally, the Korean version of the BDI-II was used to 
evaluate depression severity. The BDI-II consists of 21 self-ad-
ministered items rated on a scale from 0 to 3, ranging from 0 
to 63.16 The BDI-II has high internal consistency, with a Cron-
bach’s α coefficient of 0.93 among healthy adults.17 Further-
more, in previous research on the Korean adult population, 
Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.91, and the test-retest reliabili-
ty was 0.84.18

The Korean version of the ASI-R (K-ASI-R) was used to 
evaluate anxiety sensitivity (AS) in all participants.19,20 It is a 
commonly used measure of sensitivity to anxiety. Furthermore, 
it consists of the following items: fear of respiratory symptoms, 
cardiovascular symptoms, a publicly observable anxiety reac-
tion, and cognitive dyscontrol. The K-ASI-R has high internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.92) and good test-retest reliabil-
ity (r=0.82).

Developed by David Sheehan, the SDS is a simple, brief, and 
cost-effective self-report instrument to measure functional 
impairment levels through psychiatric or medical symptoms 

in three major domains. Therefore, it shows adequate levels 
of reliability (Cronbach’s α=0.56–0.83) and validity for patients 
with PD across the following domains: 1) work or school, 2) 
social life or leisure, and 3) family life or home responsibili-
ties.21,22 Each domain was measured on a scale ranging from 
0 (not at all) to 1–3 (mild), 4–6 (moderate), 7–9 (marked), 
and 10 (extreme).

Analytical strategies

We used an independent t-test and chi-square test, with the 
significance level set at 0.05, to analyse the sociodemographic 
characteristics before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 
each group of patients with PD and HCs. Furthermore, we 
performed Levene’s test for equality and homogeneity of vari-
ances for all demographic findings across the two samples dur-
ing the two periods.

Regarding the clinical measurement of psychological symp-
toms, the two-factor analyses of variance (ANOVA) were ap-
plied to compare between before and during the COVID-19 
pandemic in each group and determine the group-by COV-
ID-19 period interaction effects. In addition, the Benjamini–
Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method was used for each 
item or subscale for multiple correction tests. Statistical analyses 
were conducted using SPSS Windows software version 27.0 
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 

Network analysis was then performed regarding estimation,

ticipants. We could not find network structures of HCs that 
were stable and accurate; therefore, we analyzed only the net-
work structures of patients with PD before and during the CO-
VID-19 pandemic.

Network estimation

To analyse the relationship between nodes (symptoms and 
functionality) among patients with PD as a network, the R soft-
ware was used to estimate associations between nodes sepa-
rately before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.23 Initially, 
we constructed the network using Pairwise Markov Random 
Field (PMRF).24 The PMRF can construct a network in which 
each variable serves as a node. This network is represented by 
an undirected graph demonstrating the conditional dependence 
between two variables. Using the extended Bayesian informa-
tion criterion model, the graphical least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator was applied to reduce false associations 
and estimate a sparse network.25,26

For node selection in our network analysis, 13 nodes were 
included for network estimation among patients with PD as 
shown Table 1: seven panic nodes (each score of 7-item in the 
PDSS), three phobic nodes (mean score of the APPQ-agora-
phobia, social phobia, and interoceptive subscales), one depres-
sive node (total score of the BDI-II), one AS node (total score 
of the ASI-R), and one functional impairment node (total score 
of three SDS subscales: 1) work/school, 2) social life/leisure, 
and 3) family life/home responsibilities).

In each network, two centrality measures were used to deter-
mine the central nodes and perform essential roles: 1) strength 
and 2) expected influence (EI).27,28 Strength is the sum of the 
absolute weights of all edges from a target node to a neighbor-
hood. Contrastingly, EI is the summed edge weight from a tar-
get node, considering the sign of the association connecting 
the neighbors.

Network stability and accuracy

Bootstrapping was used to demonstrate the accuracy and 
reliability of the networks. The edge weights’ accuracy was cal-
culated using 95% confidence intervals and bootstrapped mean 
edges.26,29 The correlation stability coefficient (CS-C) was mea-
sured to evaluate the stability of the two centrality measure-
ments using subset bootstrapping.30 CS-C indicates the stabil-
ity and reliability of the measured centrality index. Epskamp 
and Fried discussed in their previous work26,31 that a CS-C of 
0.5 or greater is a reliable measurement and should not be less 
than 0.25. Bootstrapped edge-weight difference tests were per-
formed to evaluate the differences between edges.26

Networks comparison test of before and during the 
COVID-19 pandemic among patients with PD

To assess network differences before and during the COV-
ID-19 pandemic among patients with PD, we performed a 
network comparison test (NCT) using the R package “Network 
Comparision Test.”32 A NCT was performed with 10,000 per-
mutation samplings to evaluate the differences in invariance 
measures, including edge weights, strength, and EI.32,33 Fur-
thermore, significant differences between the two networks 
were estimated separately using a p<0.05 (two-tailed) signifi-
cance level.

RESULTS

Sociodemographic characteristics of patients seeking 
treatment for PD and HCs before and during the 
COVID-19 pandemic 

Table 2 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the 
patients with PD and HCs. There was no significant diagno-
sis-by-COVID-19 interaction effect in age, sex, education level, 
marital status, and income level. And there were no significant 
main diagnosis effects in age, sex, and monthly income, except 
for education level (p<0.001), between patients with PD and 
HCs. Additionally, among the patients with PD, there were no 
significant differences in the frequencies of agoraphobia, du-
ration of illness, and the presence of medication, types, and 
doses of pharmacotherapy between before and during COV-
ID-19 period group.

Comparison of the clinical characteristics of patients 
seeking treatment for PD and HCs before and during 
the COVID-19 pandemic

Table 3 shows clinical characteristics between the two groups 
divided before and during the COVID-19 pandemic within 
each group of patients with PD and HCs.

As results of the two-factor ANOVA, there were significant 
diagnosis-by-COVID-19 interaction effects in the impairment 
in social functioning (PDSS item 7) (F=5.25, p=0.02), APPQ 
total score (F=4.72, p=0.03), interoceptive fear (F=5.91, p= 
0.02), SDS total score (F=5.33, p=0.02), work/school (SDS sub-
scale) (F=4.03, p=0.045), social life (SDS subscale) (F=4.84, 
p=0.03), and family life/home responsibilities (SDS subscale) 
(F=5.32, p=0.02), including significant diagnostic effects in 
these variables. After FDR multiple corrections for each item 
or subscale, three subscales of the SDS remained (all FDR-
adjusted p=0.045).

Network analysis

Among patients seeking treatment for PD, both network 
structures comprising 13 nodes showed non-zero 39 edges 
(50.0%) and 44 edges (56.4%) of the total 78 edges before and 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively (Figure 2).

Estimated network structures before the COVID-19 
pandemic among patients seeking treatment for PD

In the network before the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 2), 
the strongest connection between the nodes was found in 
impairment in work functioning (P6)–impairment in social 
functioning (P7) (r=0.52), followed by agoraphobia (AgoP)–
interoceptive fear (IntP) (r=0.47) and agoraphobic fear/avoid-
ance (P4)–panic-related sensation fear/avoidance (P5) (r=0.45).
Figure 3 shows the strength and EI of all the nodes in the 
networks at different periods of patients with PD. In the before 
the COVID-19 pandemic network, P7 showed the highest 
strength and EI, while IntP reported the lowest value in both 
centrality measures in patients with PD. The second and third-
highest strengths were demonstrated by AgoP and AS, and 
this tendency was also seen for EI.

Estimated network structures during the COVID-19 
pandemic among patients seeking treatment for PD

Meanwhile, in the network during the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Figure 2), P6–P7 (r=0.54) were the most substantial edge, 
like the before COVID-19 period group. However, the second 
strongest association was found in P4–P5 (r=0.50) and AgoP–
IntP (r=0.44) as opposed to the before COVID-19 period group.
In the during the COVID-19 pandemic network as shown 
Figure 3, P4 showed the highest strength and EI. The second 
and third-highest strengths were demonstrated by P6 and P7,

and this tendency was also seen for EI. And the overall func-
tional impairment (SH) showed the lowest value in strength 
and IntP reported the lowest value in EI, respectively.

NCT of before and during the COVID-19 among 
patients with PD

The strength and EI invariance test before and during the 
COVID-19 period using the NCT are shown with asterisks in 
Figure 3. In terms of centrality, before the COVID-19 pan-
demic group has significantly higher strength (diff=0.49, p= 
0.001) and EI (diff=2.71, p=0.002) in the P4 than during the 
COVID-19 pandemic group.

Additionally, the edge weight scores were higher at the three 
edges during COVID-19 than before the COVID-19 pandemic: 
1) P4–AS (diff=0.13, p=0.01); 2) P6–depressive symptoms (D) 
(diff=0.01, p=0.01); and 3) P4–panic attack frequency (P1) 
(diff=0.10, p=0.02). Notably, the scores of edge weights in D–
SH (diff=-0.23, p=0.01) and D–AgoP (diff=-0.10, p=0.04) dur-
ing the pandemic were significantly lower than those before 
the pandemic.

Network stability and accuracy before and during 
the COVID-19 pandemic among patients seeking 
treatment for PD

All edges were observed to fall within the range of 95% boot-

strapped-confidence interval, suggesting a nonparametric 
bootstrapping procedure for verifying the edge weight accu-
racy of the two networks among patients with PD (Supple-
mentary Figure 1 in the online-only Data Supplement). The 
bootstrapped edge weight difference test results are shown in 
Supplementary Figure 2 (in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Strength, among centrality indices, showed fair stability to 
interpretation before and during the COVID-19 network (CS-
C=0.36 and 0.36). And the CS-Cs for EI by case-dropping 
subset bootstrapping were 0.44 and 0.36 in the network be-
fore and during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively (Sup-
plementary Figure 3 in the online-only Data Supplement).

DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to com-
pare the baseline clinical characteristics and network structures 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic between PD and 
HCs groups. Patients with PD seeking treatment in Korea dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic had higher functional impair-
ments in work, interpersonal relationships, and family life/
home responsibilities than before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In network analyses to estimate the relationship between psy-
chological symptoms within a group of patients with PD, the 
centrality of agoraphobic fear/avoidance was higher than that

in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients with PD experienced significant functional impair-
ments in work, interpersonal, and family relationships during 
the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the COVID-19 
pandemic. After controlling for confounding variables and con-
sidering the functional levels of HCs before and during the 
COVID-19, a significant group-by-period interaction effect 
was revealed. According to the previous study,34 the odds of 
functional impairment significantly increased by 27% for higher 
scores in separation distress, 25% for higher scores in dysfunc-
tional grief, and 13% for higher scores in posttraumatic stress 
symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, COV-
ID-19 related to stress predicted large proportions of variance 
in anxiety, depression, health anxiety, and functional impair-
ment in American adults.35 Our results are also in line with 

252  Psychiatry Investig  2023;20(3):245-254

those of the aforementioned previous studies. Our finding of 
changes in functional impairment in patients with PD suggests 
that during a pandemic, anxiety disorders such as PD, with 
high health concerns and high AS, may show a higher level 
of functional impairment in patients with PD than in healthy 
people. Therefore, policymakers in public mental health should 
consider these patients with PD.

Within the PD group, there was no significant difference in 
panic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic compared 
to before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the interocep-
tive fear symptom tended to increase over the study period 
compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic in patients 
with PD. This can be explained by the possibility that during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about infection increased 
the sense of visceral organs, which may have increased so-
matic symptoms. Patients with PD were more vulnerable to 
various social and occupational situations during the COV-
ID-19 pandemic. 

In the network analysis of the PD group, NCT showed that 
the agoraphobic fear/avoidance symptom showed significantly 
higher scores on the strength and EI centrality measures dur-
ing COVID-19 pandemic than before COVID-19. Notably, the 
agoraphobic fear/avoidance symptom was the second highest 
during the pandemic compared to the 12th-highest before the 
pandemic among the 13 symptoms in network analysis in pa-
tients with PD. In network analysis, the agoraphobic fear/avoid-
ance increased its essentiality because they are newly associated 
with AS and social functional impairment during the COV-
ID-19 pandemic. Our network analysis results are in line with 
those of the previous studies that exhibited an increase in avoid-
ance behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthy 
individuals.36,37

During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with PD respond 
by avoiding virus-related cues or crowded places because they 
are overwhelmed by anxiety or fear of infection. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, various social phenomena, such as stig-
ma, racism, religious discrimination, and invasion of privacy, 
have emerged as socially controversial. In these social situa-
tions, patients with PD have a high sense of fear suppression 
in various areas of their lives. These continuous changes in be-
havior would have appeared as a response to avoiding unspeci-
fied situations. This response suggests that behavioral chang-
es, such as agoraphobic fear/avoidance, during the COVID-19 
pandemic in patients with PD may lead to other avoidance, 
vulnerability or sensitivity to anxiety, as well as functional im-
pairment in the workplace and interpersonal or family relation-
ships. However, it is necessary to study the changes in symp-
toms in patients with PD in situations where the spread of 
COVID-19 continues using a longitudinal design.

Despite these implications, this study had several limitations. 

Functionality and Agoraphobia in PD During COVID-19First, it was designed using two cross-sectional studies. There-
fore, it might be challenging to determine the exact causal ef-
fect and relationship of time changes because we did not follow 
up on the patients. Second, although there was no statistically 
significant difference in sociodemographics (except education 
level between HCs and PD) between the participants recruited 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, our study may 
have had a sampling bias, as all participants were recruited from 
one hospital in one region.

In summary, this study, including network analysis of PD 
during and before the COVID-19 pandemic, showed that pa-
tients with PD during the COVID-19 pandemic had signifi-
cantly higher levels of social phobia and overall functional im-
pairments in work, social, and family relationships than before 
the COVID-19 period. In addition, the importance of agora-
phobic fear and avoidance as a central symptom may have in-
creased during the COVID-19 period than before COVID-19 
in patients with PD. It is necessary to focus on changes in cen-
tral symptom patterns in patients with PD in future studies, 
as social situations continue to change according to the CO-
VID-19 pandemic.

Supplementary Figure 1. Accuracy of edge weight parameters and their bootstrapped confidence intervals. The gray indicates the bootstrapped confidence intervals; and the red line represents 
the values of real sample. The y-axis represents all observed edges of the network. This accuracy analysis results showed accurate and small confidence intervals for all edge weights, suggesting 
that the sample is similar to the population. The name of the edge is omitted due to large number of edges. COVID-19, coronavirus disease-2019.
