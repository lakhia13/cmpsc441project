Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with symptoms that
affect the whole personality and all aspects of life. Although there is a high degree of heterogeneity
in both its etiology and its characteristic behavioral patterns, the disorder is well-captured along
the autistic triad. Currently, ASD status can be conﬁrmed following an assessment of behavioral
features, but there is a growing emphasis on conceptualizing autism as a spectrum, which allows for
establishing a diagnosis based on the level of support need, free of discrete categories. Since ASD has
a high genetic predominance, the number of genetic variations identiﬁed in the background of the
condition is increasing exponentially as genetic testing methods are rapidly evolving. However, due
to the huge amount of data to be analyzed, grouping the different DNA variations is still challenging.
Therefore, in the present review, a multidimensional classiﬁcation scheme was developed to accom-
modate most of the currently known genetic variants associated with autism. Genetic variations
have been grouped according to six criteria (extent, time of onset, information content, frequency,
number of genes involved, inheritance pattern), which are themselves not discrete categories, but
form a coherent continuum in line with the autism spectrum approach.

In the early 2000s, the Human Genome Project (HGP) established the ﬁrst complete
genome sequence as part of a broad international collaboration. The knowledge of the
three billion base pairs of the human genome, together with the methodological and
technical skills accumulated during the project, has clearly set the direction of research
for professionals in the ﬁeld since the turn of the millennium [1]. As in many areas of
basic and applied research, the study of the genetic background of a condition has become
increasingly important in psychology and psychiatry. Twin studies on autism spectrum
disorder have shown that it is one of the most genetically determined neurodevelopmental
disorders, with an inheritance rate of between 0.7 and 0.8. It also has a high prevalence,
affecting around 1% of the population (see below). It is not surprising therefore, that this
developmental disorder, after being ﬁrst described by Kanner [2] and Asperger [3], very
quickly became the focus of interest of clinicians and then of geneticists with the emergence
of the theory of genetic determination. Prior to the 2000s and the HGP, mainly the more
extensive genomic abnormalities (e.g., chromosomal abnormalities) were studied in relation
to ASD. In the years following the HGP, however, there has been increasing interest in
exploring the role of smaller, even single-base human variants.

In terms of methodology, psychogenetics has typically investigated the genetic varia-
tions of genes selected on the basis of psychological theories and physiological functions
as well as their molecular biological effects. However, it soon became clear that a single
or even a few genetic variations alone could not explain the vast majority of ASD cases,
and the complex, polygenic nature of the developmental disorder, involving hundreds

of genes in complex networks, became apparent. If, however, it is indeed the combined
effect of many variants of many genes that result in the development of the autistic pheno-
type, it is legitimate to raise the idea in the psychology, psychiatry, and special education
communities that ASD is nothing more than a different organization of the brain from
what is currently considered typical. Due to the diversity of the genetic background of
autism, research is nowadays shifting toward high-throughput genetic screening tests to
understand the mechanisms of ASD at the molecular level, which are highly complex and
involve many physiological and biochemical processes.

In addition to reviewing the milestones underlying the genetic determination of ASD,
given the complexity of genetic variations in autism and their inconsistent clustering prin-
ciples in the literature and varying dimensions from publication to publication, the present
review aimed to develop a possible classiﬁcation of DNA-level variations, illustrated with
speciﬁc examples.

2. Genetic Aspects of Autism Spectrum Disorder
2.1. Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism spectrum disorder is a pervasive neurodevelopmental condition with symp-
toms that affect the whole personality and everyday behavior patterns and persist through-
out life. ASD can be considered as a developmental disorder, a speciﬁc developmental
pathway, but the difﬁculties encountered are highly dependent on the environment, in
addition to the severity of the autism [4]. There is a high degree of heterogeneity in both
etiology and characteristic behavioral patterns, but the unity of the disorder is still well-
captured along the lines of the autistic triad, or more recently the dyad [5]. Despite the
extremely diverse clinical picture, qualitative developmental differences in (i) reciprocal
social behavior and (ii) communication (which form a shared category in the dyadic concep-
tion) are always present. In addition, (iii) rigid, repetitive patterns of behavior and narrow,
stereotyped interests are very common as a third member of the triad. The characteristic
symptoms appear early in development, before the age of three. Although not part of
the autistic triad, sensitivity to various stimuli (e.g., light, sound, smell, texture, etc.) is
frequent (in the dyad concept, this has been placed in the second group of the dyad) as
well as an uneven ability proﬁle and insular, outlier abilities (e.g., above-average memory,
drawing skills, etc.). The condition can now be interpreted as a multidimensional spectrum,
where the speciﬁc symptom picture is inﬂuenced by several factors. Age, severity of autism,
intelligence level, personality, speech production and comprehension, and environmental
inﬂuences are important factors in the considerable heterogeneity of the clinical picture.
The latter include family environment, institutional care, and the extent and quality of
support [6].

2.2. Epidemiology

The study of the epidemiological aspects of autism spectrum disorder is extremely
important for several reasons, as the prevalence of ASD and its alteration inﬂuence the
planning of the range and availability of care and services for those affected at the societal
In addition, the prevalence characteristics of a condition may be related to its
level.
underlying causes. Accordingly, the temporal and spatially uniform distribution of autism
implies a genetic background, as opposed to other conditions that are temporally and
geographically uneven and mainly dependent on environmental factors.

2.2.1. Prevalence

Since the 2000s, data on the prevalence of autism worldwide have shown an increasing
trend [7]. While by the turn of the millennium, diagnoses based on Kanner’s description
estimated that 4–5 out of 10,000 people were affected, the prevalence of autism began to
rise signiﬁcantly, reaching 1% by 2010, and has continued to increase worldwide over the
past 10 years. In an analysis of the geographical distribution, data from the U.S., Europe,
Asia, and Africa were combined to ﬁnd that the prevalence of ASD ranged from 0.2% to

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16768

2.5% worldwide [8]. A similar study using post-2012 data estimated an average global
prevalence of 1% with a considerably wide range (0.01% to 4.3%) [9]. The staggering
increase in the prevalence of autism in the United States since 2010 is also marked in the
overall and gender-speciﬁc prevalence rates for the eight-year-old child population, which
is systematically analyzed and published every two years (Figure 1, [10–15]).

Figure 1. Trends in the prevalence (A) and IQ (B) of children affected by autism in the United States
between 2010 and 2020.

Thus, over the last ten years, the prevalence of autism has increased from 1.47% to
2.76%, according to the U.S. public health data. The rate of increase is clear for both sexes
(Figure 1A), but there is only a tendency for the IQ distribution of those affected to shift
toward the lower range (Figure 1B). Similar trends can be observed both in Europe [16]
and on the Asian continent [17], although the data have been less systematically processed
thus far. The increase in prevalence can be explained partly by apparent and partly by real
case number increases. The apparent increase is due to the broadening of the diagnostic
criteria for autism, with a direct consequence of the increasingly thorough recognition of
the condition [18]. In addition, there has been a gradual and signiﬁcant improvement in
diagnostic tools and procedures as well as an increase in the knowledge of society regarding
autism [19]. The biological explanations for the actual increase are currently unknown,
but factors may include selective immigration (e.g., moving into better care settings, the
stabilizing effect of cultural distance on the relationship of high-functioning ASD individ-
uals), evolving rehabilitation options, and environmental inﬂuences [20]. However, the
geographic differences in prevalence, sometimes reaching orders of magnitude, are more
likely to reﬂect the differences in diagnostic protocols and the differences in the level of
development of economic and social functioning in different regions of the world, rather
than real and signiﬁcant regional differences [18].

Autism is more common in males, but while published data in the 2000s suggested that
4–5 times more boys than girls were affected, recent studies suggest that the male-to-female
ratio is probably closer to 3:1 [21]. It is also noteworthy that at higher IQ levels, the ratio
is even more skewed toward males (10–15:1), but at lower IQ levels, it almost evens out
(1.5:1) [22]. Recent theories suggest that this is due to ‘female camouﬂage’, which refers to
the ability of high-functioning ASD females to adapt to the rules of mainstream society at
the cost of a signiﬁcant energy investment, better than men and lower-intellectuals [23–26].
Of course, this comes at a ‘cost’, as non-diagnosis, delayed diagnosis, or misdiagnosis
deprives affected females of key support services, which greatly impairs their quality of
life, often leading to the development of comorbid mental disorders [27–29].

The prevalence of autism among siblings of individuals diagnosed with ASD is much
higher than in the general population [30]. On average, it is between 10% and 20%, but
the prevalence is inﬂuenced by the gender of the person with ASD and the gender of the

In an analysis of the geographical distribution, data from the U.S., Eu-rope, Asia, and Africa were combined to ﬁnd that the prevalence of ASD ranged from 0.2% to 2.5% worldwide [8]. A similar study using post-2012 data estimated an average global prevalence of 1% with a considerably wide range (0.01% to 4.3%) [9]. The staggering in-crease in the prevalence of autism in the United States since 2010 is also marked in the overall and gender-speciﬁc prevalence rates for the eight-year-old child population, which is systematically analyzed and published every two years (Figure 1, [10–15]).

Thus, over the last ten years, the prevalence of autism has increased from 1.47% to 2.76%, according to the U.S. public health data. The rate of increase is clear for both sexes (Figure 1A), but there is only a tendency for the IQ distribution of those aﬀected to shift toward the lower range (Figure 1B).

However, the geographic diﬀerences in prevalence, sometimes reaching orders of magnitude, are more likely to reﬂect the diﬀerences in diagnostic protocols and the diﬀerences in the level of development of economic and social functioning in diﬀerent regions of the world, rather than real and signiﬁcant regional diﬀerences [18]. Autism is more common in males, but while published data in the 2000s suggested that 4‒5 times more boys than girls were aﬀected, recent studies suggest that the male-to-female ratio is probably closer to 3:1 [21].

sibling [31]. Among the siblings of children with autism, the prevalence of subclinical
autistic traits that do not reach diagnostic criteria (i.e., the broad autism phenotype) is much
higher in neurotypically developing children [32,33].

2.2.2. Heritability

The hereditary nature of autism spectrum disorder is now a clear scientiﬁc fact, but
there is still some uncertainty regarding its extent. A meta-analysis in 2016 reviewed
6413 sets of monozygotic and dizygotic twins with at least one child diagnosed with ASD.
Their results suggest an estimated heritability of 0.64–0.91, which has since been conﬁrmed
by others [34], suggesting a currently accepted heritability rate for ASD of 0.7–0.8 [35].
This implies the presence of a similar degree of genetic component as, for example, that of
body height [36] or attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is otherwise
comorbid with autism [37].

2.3. Etiology

Research into the development of autism spectrum disorder is no longer concerned
with speciﬁc root causes, but rather with predisposing and protective factors [38]. While
the former increases the likelihood of developing the disorder, the latter counteracts it, thus
the phenotype is the result of both sets of factors. Since the heritability of ASD is high,
but not equal to 1, it is not only the genes and their variations that are responsible for the
development of the condition. Therefore, the role of environmental, possibly psychogenic
factors in the background of autism cannot be ignored.

2.3.1. Environmental Impacts

The current scientiﬁc consensus suggests that the following environmental factors may
contribute to the development of autism [39–41]: (i) higher parental, especially paternal,
age; (ii) adverse prenatal inﬂuences (e.g., infections during pregnancy, extreme intrauterine
hormonal, especially testosterone effects [42], poor quality of maternal nutrition, maternal
substance use and smoking, maternal health, heavy metal pollution or air pollution);
(iii) perinatal complications (e.g., umbilical cord abnormalities, meconium amniotic ﬂuid
aspiration, low birth weight, etc.) [43]; (iv) low socioeconomic status. It is important
to emphasize, however, that none of these factors are autism-speciﬁc; they increase the
susceptibility of many other mental or physical disorders in addition to ASD. Furthermore,
some of the environmental factors cannot be sharply separated from genetic effects, as,
for example, higher paternal age increases the prevalence of de novo mutations during
spermiogenesis [44], and complications during childbirth may also arise due to atypical
fetal positioning (e.g., breech presentation, facial positioning, improper ﬁtting in the birth
canal), which may also be genetically determined [45].

2.3.2. Genetic Factors

The genetically determined nature of autism spectrum disorder is therefore well-
established, but the methodological complexity of assessing the components still makes it
challenging to evaluate the accumulated data.

Twin Studies

Twin studies of psychiatric disorders such as ASD have employed epidemiologi-
cal approaches that determine heritability by comparing the concordance rate between
monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Theoretically, MZ twins share 100% of the
genetic and environmental background, although this is no longer clear in either case due
to epigenetic modiﬁcations or de novo mutations [46]. Several such studies have been
conducted in the literature with rather heterogeneous results (summarized in Table 1). In a
meta-analysis published in 2016, the concordance rate for MZ twin pairs was found to be
98%, while that for DZ twins was 53% [47].

The analysis of co-occurrence between siblings of different ages also supports the
genetic determination of ASD. This involves examining how often a younger sibling of a
child with autism receives a similar diagnosis. In a follow-up study of a relatively large U.S.
sample (N = 664), Ozonoff and colleagues found a recurrence risk of 18.7%, suggesting a
very strong genetic inﬂuence compared to the average prevalence of 1% in the population.
Male siblings of children with ASD are three times more likely to have a similar diagnosis
than female ones (26.2% vs. 9.1%) [30]. Hansen and colleagues studied the prevalence of
autism in an international sample (U.S., Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and Israel)
of more than 60,000 younger siblings and cousins of children diagnosed with ASD and
childhood autism. The likelihood of a younger sibling being diagnosed with autism was
8.4 times higher for ASD and 17.4 times higher for a diagnosis of childhood autism. The
probability, although smaller (2-fold), was also increased in second-degree relatives [33].
Another study of a large number of cases found an even higher recurrence probability of
30.4 times for a sibling diagnosed with ASD [52]. Although the exact magnitude of the
risk varies widely, there is a clear familial cumulative pattern of autism. It is very likely,
however, that such family studies have been somewhat underestimated, and the probability
of the condition recurring in younger siblings of an older autistic child is presumably higher
than that measured, since often after the birth of an affected child, the parents will no longer
have more offspring, even if a larger family was previously planned [53].

Comorbidities

ASD is associated with hundreds of genetic diseases and conditions, most of which are
extremely rare. Approximately 45% of people with autism are intellectually disabled (ID),
50% live with ADHD, and 30% have epilepsy [54]. While AHDH has a very signiﬁcant ge-
netic component, the same is still only plausible for ID [55] and some types of epilepsy [56].
The prevalence of ASD in genetic syndromes with at least 0.01% frequency is summarized
in Table 2.

It is striking that the prevalence of ASD is much higher (up to more than 60 times) than
the population average for the listed syndromes. In addition, there are several other very
rare genetic disorders associated with autism (Angelman, Joubert, Smith–Lemli–Opitz, and
Timothy syndromes, etc. [64]), the prevalence of which is extremely low. To date, approxi-
mately 20–35% of individuals diagnosed with ASD have some genetic abnormalities [70],
which present a very diverse phenotypic picture, further complicating the possibility of
establishing uniform clinical and diagnostic categories. It is noteworthy, that ASD is highly
prevalent in certain syndromes compared to the population average, however, among
individuals with autism, these syndromes are relatively rarely identiﬁed, explaining at
most one third of cases [71].

3. Categorization of Genetic Variations Associated with Autism along Six Dimensions

The DNA sequence changes underlying autism spectrum disorder can be very diverse.
These can range from single nucleotide changes to the appearance of entire extra chromo-
somes, from rare mutations to very common polymorphisms, from de novo variants to
hereditary ones. The picture is further complicated by the blurred boundaries and a lot
of overlap between the categories as well as the interpretational differences of modiﬁca-
tions affecting the genome [35,70]. The present work attempts to develop and present a
transparent categorization system as well as illustrate the signiﬁcance of a given genetic
modiﬁcation through a couple of autism speciﬁc examples.

3.1. Categorization by Extent
3.1.1. Chromosomal Abnormalities

The prevalence of autism is signiﬁcantly increased by certain trisomies. Down syn-
drome with chromosome 21 trisomy is more than 40 times more likely to develop ASD
compared to the population average (Table 2) [58]. Supernumerary sex chromosomes
also signiﬁcantly increase the susceptibility to ASD [72]. On average, the prevalence of
autistic traits in people with Klinefelter syndrome is 25% [73,74], and 10–27% of children
meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD, a signiﬁcant increase compared to the population
average of 1–2% [74,75]. The prevalence of autism in XXX trisomy is also increased, at
around 15% [74,76]. XYY trisomy also predisposes to autism with a high variance; around
30% reach the threshold for clinical diagnosis [77,78]. Interestingly, the only non-lethal
whole-chromosome monosomy, Turner syndrome, is not associated with an increased risk
of ASD [79].

If a large segment of one chromosome, usually an arm, is lost, the cell is functionally
monosomic with respect to the genetic information in that region. In autism, such defects of
chromosome 11 are frequently reported in the literature, for example, it is known that loss
of a long arm of chromosome 11 (Jacobsen syndrome) is associated with the development
of severe autistic symptoms [80]. Nevertheless, Jacobsen syndrome is quite rare, and the
prevalence of ASD cannot be accurately established in this population. However, in the
case of Cri du chat syndrome with complete absence of the shorter arm of chromosome 5,
the prevalence of ASD has increased signiﬁcantly to almost 40% [81].

The question may arise as to how long a chromosomal abnormality is considered a
partial monosomy and when it is considered a deletion, which can be classiﬁed more as a
structural change. There is no clear consensus on this point. In this work, partial monosomy
was considered when one arm of the chromosome was missing in its entirety, while it was
classiﬁed as a structural aberration when this absence was partial.

Although the structural variations no longer affect the whole chromosome or one
of its arms, they are still very extensive, affecting several to hundreds of genes at a time.
Their development requires a spontaneous or induced breakage of the chromosome(s) at
one or more points. In an unbalanced translocation, the displacement of two chromosome
fragments results in the loss of genetic information and phenotypic consequences. The
imbalanced variant of the translocation between the short arms of chromosome 8 and chro-
mosome 4 shows familial accumulation and is more common in the ASD population [82,83].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16768

In addition, one-ﬁfth of autism-related cases of Phelan–McDermid syndrome are due to
the unbalanced translocation of segments of chromosome 22 and 2 [84]. Prader–Willi and
Angelman syndromes are caused by deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15. The
incidence of autism in both syndromes is signiﬁcantly higher than in the control population.
While the former is 3–57 times more common [85], the latter has a higher prevalence of more
than 30 times for an associated ASD diagnosis [64]. Additionally, other structural anomalies
of chromosome 15 such as isodicentric chromosome [86] and uniparental disomy [87] have
also been described in the context of autism. Microdeletions are deﬁned as the loss of a
relatively small chromosomal fragment, but this does not necessarily imply a favorable
outcome. From schizophrenia to cardiac malformations and autism, a number of conditions
with a genetic background of microdeletions have been described in the literature (for a
summary, see [88]), which highlight several microdeletion hot-spots with an increased fre-
quency of abnormal chromosomal changes. These include the long arms of chromosomes
22, 17, 16, and 7. The vast majority (~80%) of cases of autism-related Phelan–McDermid
syndrome are caused by a break at the end of the long arm of chromosome 22 [84]. The
same syndrome can also be due to a ring chromosome resulting from the fusion of two
broken ends of chromosome 22.

3.1.2. Copy Number Variations

Copy number variations (CNVs) are very frequent, accounting for 5–10% of the
human genome [89]. The vast majority (~95%) are common variants that are assumed
to be important in the development of genetic diversity [90]. Roughly 1% of them are
considered rare variants, which may play a key role in the genetic background of many
neuropsychiatric or developmental disorders including autism [91]. The results of a whole
genome analysis of a sample of thousands of individuals by Marshall and colleagues clearly
showed that all regions, except chromosome Y, were affected [92]. However, several CNVs
that have recurred in recent studies clearly highlight some autism-speciﬁc chromosomal
regions [93] including segments of the long arm of chromosomes 1, 7, 15, and 22, and some
areas of the short arm of chromosomes 2 and 16 [93] (Table 3).

As CNVs can result in the simultaneous loss or duplication of up to dozens of genes,
the exact connection between autism and these genetic variations as well as their mechanism
remains a major challenge. The association between phenotype and changes in the dosage of
the affected gene (deletion or duplication) may provide guidance, although the connection
is not always predictive. A good example is the microdeletion of the 7q11.23 region in
Williams syndrome, which is associated with a high degree of sociability. At the same
time, duplication of the same region is likely to result in autism and communication

deﬁcits [97–99]. This suggests that the region may have dose-dependent opposite effects in
the phenotype. However, individuals with microdeletion, similar to those with ASD, have
been found to have basic social skills deﬁciencies [100]. This is not surprising given the
complex nature of the different social functions and behaviors, so the relationship between
the genotype and phenotype is likely to be even more nuanced.

Interestingly, the deletion and duplication of another CNV affecting the 16p11.2 locus
were both equally associated with autism, but while deletion was correlated with macroen-
cephaly and obesity [101], duplication was phenotypically characterized by microencephaly
and impaired growth [102]. An attempt to explain this paradox relationship was made by
Deshpande and colleagues [103]. Fibroblasts from individuals with deletion or duplication
of the 16p11.2 region were used to generate pluripotent stem cell cultures and differentiate
the cells in the neural direction. Neurons carrying the deletion had larger cell bodies and
longer dendrites than those carrying the duplication. Despite the signiﬁcant phenotypic
difference, however, neurons with either deletion or duplication showed similar levels of
reduced synaptic activity, offering very elegant evidence for a correlation between clinical
phenotype, cellular processes, and genetic background.

3.1.3. Single Nucleotide Variations

Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) compose about 0.1% of the human genome, the
majority of which are common variants and, like CNVs, are a major source of genetic
diversity. Due to their extent, SNVs can usually affect only one gene. On the one hand, this
may facilitate the identiﬁcation of their role in a given phenotype, in this case autism, but on
the other hand, the complex nature of ASD means that the small effect of a single gene can
easily be ‘lost’ in the interpretation of the different neurodevelopmental background of an
intricate interplay of tens or even hundreds of genes. Today, a very large number of genes
and their SNVs are associated with autism in the literature, and the list is expected to grow
with the routine application of next-generation whole-genome sequencing. Processing
this dynamically growing amount of data is largely facilitated by a number of searchable
databases of SNVs and genes associated with ASD. The most recent online databases
available without restrictions are listed in Table 4.

However, the results of the various high-throughput studies and the growing number
of summaries written on the topic [35,93,104,105] are still only the beginning of the journey,
as it is very common that the list of SNVs and genes associated with ASD from the various
works is not or only limitedly overlapping. To resolve these discrepancies, further, largely
functional studies and advanced bioinformatical methods will be needed. Despite the
contradictory results, three main functional gene clusters seem to emerge in relation to
ASD. In addition to a group of genes that are key in the regulation of gene expression and
neuronal communication [106], genetic information that controls the organization of the
cell scaffold appears to be crucial [104]. A striking example of the latter is the much-studied
three isoforms of the SHANK gene, which encode post-synaptic scaffolding proteins of
glutaminergic synapses in the central nervous system. Many of their SNVs have been
consistently shown to be associated with the development of autism [107,108]. In addition,

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16768

9 of 20

the role of the NLGN3 and NLGN4 genes, which encode neuronal cell surface proteins and
are thought to be important in regulating intercellular communication, in the etiology of
ASD is also clear, and their mutations have been widely identiﬁed and studied [109,110].

3.2. Categorization by Time of Onset
3.2.1. De Novo Variations

A de novo variation is the result of a mutation in the parental gametes or a genetic
modiﬁcation during embryogenesis that arises for the ﬁrst time in the individual. Genetic
alterations during embryogenesis or later in development result in mosaicism (i.e., only
the progeny of the cell that has undergone the genetic change carry the de novo variant).
Such genetic variation can occur at the level of chromosomes, CNVs, and SNVs. Although
it is not yet entirely clear what proportion of ASD cases involve de novo events, the
prevalence of somatic variations in autism has recently been estimated to be between 5
and 7.5% [111,112]. Most of the autism-related chromosomal abnormalities discussed in
Section 3.1.1. fall into this category. Rare CNVs (see Section 3.1.2) also often develop
during de novo events [96], with an increased incidence of 3–10 times among individuals
diagnosed with ASD [113].

3.2.2. Inherited Variations

Hereditary variations can be found in the parental genome. They can affect large
gene regions or only a single nucleotide. In general, due to the complexity of the genetic
background of autism spectrum disorder, recessively inherited (see also Section 3.6.) genetic
alterations are the primary focus of research [114,115]. Although their signiﬁcance has been
described for more than 30 years [116] and demonstrated in a number of ways [117], the
extensive study of heritable variants has been somewhat overshadowed by the current
interest in de novo variation. In 2013, Lim and colleagues concluded that in about 5% of
cases, ASD is caused by inherited variants that result in the loss of function of a particular
gene, of which 3% are autosomal and 2% are X-linked [118].

3.3. Categorization by Information Content

Given the complex genetic background of ASD, it is not surprising that an extremely
large number of autism-related genetic variants affecting the coding region have been
described, so this review can only highlight the main trends.

3.3.1. Coding Region Variations

The three billion base pairs of the human genome encode only 20–25 thousand genes,
which are translated into protein via mRNA. Genetic variations affecting exons therefore
have a high probability of being reﬂected in the structure of the protein, altering its function.
In most cases, this change affects the protein negatively, causing a loss of function and
disrupting a very complex and precisely engineered system. Less frequently, variations in
the coding region can create a protein that works more efﬁciently or has a new function
(gain-of-function variations). Larger, deletional CNVs tend to corrupt genes, which can
often be partially or completely lost. Their duplications, however, can lead to a stronger
gene expression, which of course is not necessarily beneﬁcial for the organism. The effect
of missense SNVs can range from undetectable to gain-of-function or to complete loss-of-
function. Longer or shorter insertions or deletions may also show a variable phenotypic
picture depending on the number and position of nucleotides being excised or incorporated.
A large-scale study sequencing the whole genomes of more than 100,000 individuals
concluded that rare loss-of-function variants in coding regions signiﬁcantly increased the
risk of autism, among several other neurological conditions [119].

3.3.2. Intron Variations

Although intron variations do not appear in the protein structure, speciﬁc regions
of the introns are essential for mature mRNA function. During the splicing process, the

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16768

10 of 20

regulatory role of certain intron sequences is essential, so variations in these sequences
may already clearly contribute to the phenotype, as has been shown in the case of autism
spectrum disorder [120]. It has been raised that in this case, the intron region in question
could be considered a regulatory region (see Section 3.3.3). Further complicating the
picture, an intron of one gene may be a regulatory region for another one. In addition, in
the process of alternative splicing, where a variable number of exons are deleted alongside
introns, these intron regions also have a gene- and tissue-speciﬁc regulatory role. Given
the complexity of the human genome, the picture is therefore complex and the boundaries
between categories are not sharp.

3.3.3. Regulatory Region Variations

Regulatory regions ultimately affect the amount of protein produced from a gene
in a given cell under given conditions. While the promoter regulates gene expression,
the 3(cid:48) region affects the stability of the mRNA produced and the process of translation.
However, in addition to studying genetic variation in regulatory regions [121], there is
increasing interest in comparing mRNA and protein levels that are also affected by genetic
modiﬁcation in samples from individuals with autism and controls. Comparisons of
samples from different tissues of healthy and ASD individuals have shown differences
in the expression patterns of several genes such as FOXP1, MAL, and C11orf30 [122–125].
This is further supported by the fact that several variants of these genes have also been
associated with language development delay and autism [126,127].

3.3.4. Non-Coding Region Variations

Only 1.5% of the human genome codes for proteins. Currently known regulatory
regions account for a further 1.5%. A part of the remaining 97% encodes other RNAs
(tRNA, rRNA, microRNA, lncRNA), while the function of other parts is still unknown. It is
understandable that at the beginning of genetic studies and even today, this large DNA
pool has mostly been outside the focus of autism research. Nevertheless, data on the genetic
variation of these regions are steadily accumulating with the results of high-throughput
whole genome sequencing [128,129]. However, identifying genetic variants associated with
autism is only the easy part of the task, as the lack of known function of the DNA sequence
makes it challenging to provide a causal explanation. A further complication is that the
average effect of these non-coding regions on the development of autism is likely to be
relatively small [130].

3.4. Categorization by Frequency

The average difference of 0.1–0.5% between the genomes of two unrelated individuals
is the sum of rare and common variants. The frequency of rare variants or mutations
in the population is below 1%, correspondingly, the frequency of common variants or
polymorphisms is above 1%. Other deﬁnitions set this threshold as 5%, so the frequency
range between 1 and 5% is considered a grey zone.

3.4.1. Rare Variations

In general, mutations tend to, but not exclusively, affect the coding region or the entire
gene and have a drastic effect on the expressed protein. As a result, a larger proportion of
them is created through de novo events. Chromosomal abnormalities are understandably
clearly rare variants, but they are relatively common in autism (see Section 3.1.1.). However,
only about 1–4% of CNVs are classiﬁed as rare variations. Analyzing the genetic samples
of more than a thousand ASD and neurotypical individuals, Pinto and colleagues found a
signiﬁcantly higher prevalence of rare CNVs in autism compared to the control population
(7.6% vs. 4.5%) [131,132]. According to the current point of view, rare genetic variations
are responsible for only 1–5% of ASD cases, which usually affect genes involving synaptic
connections (such as the neuroligin gene family, the scaffolding protein family, or the
neurexin gene family) [35].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16768

3.4.2. Common Variations

Polymorphisms are mainly found in regulatory or non-coding regions, with no or
mild functional consequences. They largely make up the genetic complexity of polygenic
traits, and hence of autism, involving many variations in many genes. Common variants
may underlie around 40–60% of ASD cases [133,134]. Two opposing models are known for
the frequency of genome variation associated with ASD. One model emphasizes the role
of rare variants with high phenotypic impact [124], while the other model suggests that
common variants contribute at least 50% to the high heritability of ASD [133]. The latter
suggests that these common variants can easily persist in the population due to their small
phenotypic effect, in contrast to rare variants with robust phenotypic consequences and
high selection pressure [90].

3.5. Categorization by Complexity
3.5.1. Monogenic Factors

A trait can be considered monogenic if a single change at the DNA level or one or more
genetic modiﬁcations in a single gene is sufﬁcient for its development, which is obligate
regardless of environmental inﬂuences, and is merely the consequence of a change in the
genetic information. These conditions usually form discrete categories, with no transition
between them. Section 3.1.1. offers several examples of monogenic conditions in connection
with autism, reiterating that the mentioned genetic abnormalities are monogenic for the
developing syndromes and not for ASD, with a clear contribution to the genetic background
of the latter [135].

3.5.2. Polygenic Factors

The development of polygenic traits, conditions, and diseases involves many vari-
ations of many genes in combination with environmental inﬂuences. As a consequence,
they usually do not create discrete categories, but a diverse phenotypic continuum moving
across a broader spectrum, depending on the number and quality of the genes involved and
the environmental inﬂuences. Despite the fact that many types of genetic predisposition
have been successfully identiﬁed and characterized, currently no single variant, gene, or
polygenic score has a high predictive value in the diagnosis of ASD. Even CNVs with a
high effect size for ASD present with variable psychiatric characteristic traits, and risk may
be attributed to a combination of rare and common variants [136].

3.6. Categorization by Inheritance

For many of the genetic variations associated with ASD, the exact pattern of inheritance
is still unknown, but where it is, virtually all known possibilities can occur. The present
work does not aim to describe all possibilities, but merely to illustrate, through a few
examples, another segment of the extremely complex genetic components of autism.

In tuberous sclerosis with autosomal dominant inheritance, the prevalence of autism
is quite high, around 25–50% (see Table 2). The development of the disease is due to loss-
of-function mutations in two genes involved in the regulation of key cellular mechanisms
(proliferation, protein and lipid synthesis, apoptosis), TSC1 and TSC2. Thus, in addition to
tumor lesions affecting virtually all organs, ASD symptoms are also very common [137].

Autism-related Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome, an autosomal recessive inheritance
disorder, is caused by gene defects in a key enzyme of cholesterol metabolism (DHCR7).
Although the disorder itself is quite rare, the phenotypic picture of the syndrome is closely
associated with autistic behavioral features [64,138].

Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome are characterized by dominant inheritance
linked to the X chromosome. While the former is the most common cause of mental
retardation in men, the latter mainly affects women. Both disorders have a relatively high
prevalence of autism (30–60%, see Table 2) [64,67]. In Fragile X syndrome, a high number
of trinucleotide repeats (CGGs) of the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome leads to gene
silencing and thus a reduction in the amount of protein produced [139]. While the normal

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16768

12 of 20

number of repeats is below 30, affected individuals have 200–2000 repeats. Mutations in the
MECP2 gene, located at the end of the longer arm of the chromosome X (Xq28), are involved
in the development of Rett syndrome. MECP2 is a transcriptional regulator expressed
throughout the body that regulates the function of several other genes, and therefore the
full mechanism of disease development is still unclear [140]. The mutations themselves are
de novo in the vast majority of cases, but can arise in the maternal germline, which thus
exhibit a classical X-linked dominant inheritance pattern.

4. Discussion

Over the past two decades, signiﬁcant progress has been made in understanding
the genetic components of autism spectrum disorder. Large sample size studies and
technological and bioinformatical innovations have enabled the identiﬁcation of many
common genetic predisposing factors and detailed autism-speciﬁc analysis of the human
genome. From monogenic and chromosomal abnormalities, which can explain only a very
small proportion of ASD cases, the focus has moved on to the study of multicomponent,
complex genetic determinants. Moreover, in addition to the importance of rare variations,
which is not disputed, there is a growing emphasis on the role of common variants in
autism [70].

However, the literature on the genetic components of autism categorizes changes in
DNA in very different ways. Often, merely one aspect is discussed (e.g., only CNVs, only
de novo variants) or only a few dimensions are highlighted. The principles for grouping
genetic variations also vary from publication to publication, making it very difﬁcult to
compare them and to form a coherent picture. This review has attempted to classify the
genetic variations involved in autism into six categories based on their extent, time of onset,
localization inside the gene or genome (i.e., protein coding vs. non-coding), frequency of
variation, inheritance pattern, and the number of genes involved in a given individual,
thus covering the full spectrum of variations in DNA along several dimensions.

The picture is further complicated by the fact that a given genetic variation can often
belong to more than one of the dimensions discussed in Section 2 and illustrated in Figure 2.
In Phelan–McDermid syndrome, the prevalence of autism is greater than 70% and can be
caused by multiple defects on chromosome 22 [141]. Phenotypically similar consequences
are also associated with the translocation or deletion of the longer arm of chromosome 22
or mutations affecting one or a few bases of genes in this region (see Figure 2, dimension of
extent). In addition, these alterations may be newly induced or even inherited (see Figure 2,
dimension of onset).

Figure 2. Dimensions of the genetic components of ASD.

It is also noteworthy that each of the six dimensions summarized in Figure 2 can be
considered a spectrum itself, with the number of transitions between the two endpoints
(shown in the ﬁgure) being virtually inﬁnite. Thus, it is easy to conclude that the genetic
predisposing factors of individuals with autism can be located in a very diverse pattern

It is also noteworthy that each of the six dimensions summarized in Figure 2 can be considered a spectrum itself, with the number of transitions between the two endpoints (shown in the ﬁgure) being virtually inﬁnite. Thus, it is easy to conclude that the genetic predisposing factors of individuals with autism can be located in a very diverse pattern along the spectrum of the six dimensions, contributing in many diﬀerent ways and de-grees to the autism phenotype. Although ASD is largely a genetic condition, we cannot overlook the variability in neurodevelopment, cognition, and environmental inﬂuences, which together make the interpretation of the autism spectrum a complex and challenging scientiﬁc and professional endeavor. Currently, the bottleneck in autism research is no longer the lack of eligible subjects, the complexity of genetic analysis, or the inaccuracy of diagnostic systems, but the evalu-ation of the accumulated data and the deﬁnition of interpretative frameworks. Recent re-search trends represent an interdisciplinary systems biology and network approach. Nowadays, there is a growing number of consortia studies in this ﬁeld, where represent-atives from several disciplines are working together to develop a complex genetic model of autism [104,142,143]. It is undoubtable that the translation of rapidly growing genetic knowledge into clin-ical, pedagogical, and special education practice is a rather slow process. A question has arisen as to whether and how the person with autism and their family will beneﬁt from the genetic knowledge detailed in this review. The current view is that, although it is now feasible, genetic variants associated with autism are not screened for during pregnancy, as the link between a particular genetic condition and autism is still unclear. There is no guidance on what to do when a variation closely associated with autism is detected in a fetal sample. Today, since it is still only possible to identify genetic constellations that predispose to autism, but not necessarily cause it, ethical questions have been rightly raised in connection with this type of testing. However, there is also a strong argument for pre- and perinatal genetic screening, since if parents are aware of the higher likelihood of autism in the newborn child, intervention as early as possible can give them the best possible outcome. Genetic testing following a diagnosis of autism can have a number of beneﬁts, as it can provide families with a reassuring explanation of the cause of ASD, help them accept the condition, and avoid self-blame. It can also help people with similar genetic alterations and their families to join a support group. Advanced and detailed genetic testing can also help to identify the presence of other genetically determined conditions (e.g., cardiac mal-formations, tumors) that may require medical intervention and may go unnoticed in the shadow of autism. Finally, the long-term beneﬁts must be taken into account, as the grow-ing pool of autism-speciﬁc genetic information will have an impact on the well-being not only of children currently living with autism, but also of children born with the condition Int.

along the spectrum of the six dimensions, contributing in many different ways and degrees
to the autism phenotype. Although ASD is largely a genetic condition, we cannot overlook
the variability in neurodevelopment, cognition, and environmental inﬂuences, which to-
gether make the interpretation of the autism spectrum a complex and challenging scientiﬁc
and professional endeavor.

Currently, the bottleneck in autism research is no longer the lack of eligible subjects, the
complexity of genetic analysis, or the inaccuracy of diagnostic systems, but the evaluation
of the accumulated data and the deﬁnition of interpretative frameworks. Recent research
trends represent an interdisciplinary systems biology and network approach. Nowadays,
there is a growing number of consortia studies in this field, where representatives from several
disciplines are working together to develop a complex genetic model of autism [104,142,143].
It is undoubtable that the translation of rapidly growing genetic knowledge into

account, as the growing pool of autism-speciﬁc genetic information will have an impact
on the well-being not only of children currently living with autism, but also of children
born with the condition in the future. Overall, the genetic panels developed for screening
ASD associated variations cannot yet provide deﬁnitive information on whether a person
has autism (i.e., they cannot be used for diagnostic purposes). However, they offer at
least partial answers to the cause of the condition [144]. Finally, scientiﬁc efforts to ﬁnd a
cure for autism, mainly in monogenic cases, using a gene therapy approach, should also
be mentioned [135]. However, this raises ethical issues, together with the limitations of
technical implementation, and is currently not a reality in clinical practice [145,146].

As researchers gain a deeper understanding of the genetic background of autism, they
may be able to assign developmental pathways speciﬁc to a genetic pattern, which may
allow for the development of tailored, effective interventions [143].

5. Conclusions

With the opportunities offered by technological advances, it is now possible to se-
quence whole genomes in a matter of days, allowing comparative analyses to be carried
out. Larger studies often compare the genomes of thousands or even tens of thousands
of autistic and typically developing individuals. This has, of course, not only brought
technical innovations in molecular biology techniques, but has also led to dramatic ad-
vances in comparative analysis, statistics, and, above all, bioinformatics. Alongside genome
sequencing, exome and RNA sequencing, which allow for qualitative and quantitative
analysis of the ‘active’ part of the genetic material that is being transcribed, are becoming
increasingly common. All this can now be carried out from a single cell and without

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16768

invasive sampling procedures. It should not be overlooked, however, that currently ASD
patients are diagnosed and categorized on the basis of behavioral characteristics, the criteria
for which may vary between clinical trials and thus affect the interpretation of the results
obtained, and it is therefore not surprising that heterogeneous genetic results are reported
in a heterogeneous patient population.

In recent years, a huge amount of genetic information has accumulated—and is still
accumulating—in the ﬁeld of autism research, which may legitimately raise the question
of whether we are any closer to understanding the etiology of ASD. The answer is not
obvious, despite the huge amount of data and work that has been conducted. It can
be stated with certainty, thanks to ever-evolving diagnostic tools and newer and newer
molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques, that considerably more is known about
the molecular genetic background of this condition than was earlier the case, but it is
still far from being fully understood. Similarly, with a few exceptions, the possibility of
reliable genetic screening or even personalized treatment at the genetic level—if this is even
necessary—is still a long way off. Only the details are known, and further network-based
research would be needed to discover systems in the dataset that clearly identify the key
gene clusters underlying ASD.

According to the current state-of-the-art understanding of autism, ASD is a spectrum
condition with no distinct categories. However, this approach is not always useful in clinical
and genetic research, which often requires grouping subjects according to certain criteria
(e.g., IQ) to achieve greater homogeneity. Ultimately, a clearer diagnostic categorization of
ASD will lead to clearer genetic correlations, and clearer genetic deﬁnitions would be of
great help in autism identiﬁcation and diagnosis.
