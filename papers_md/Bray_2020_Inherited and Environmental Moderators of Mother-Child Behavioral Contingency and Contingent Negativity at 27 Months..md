Abstract

Previous research has shown that as depressive symptomology increases, mothers tend to show 
withdrawn or harsh interaction patterns with their children, and the quality of these interaction 
patterns have subsequently been linked to child behavior problems. However, little research has 
examined bidirectional influences between mothers and their children, and how these moment-to-
moment contingencies differ based on heritable and environmental characteristics. We used data 
from the Early Growth and Development Study a prospective adoption study to examine how 
adoptive mothers’ depressive symptoms and children’s heritable tendencies for negative affectivity 
interact to predict the quality of mother-child interactions at child age 27-months. Results detected 
two distinct dyadic interaction patterns. The first was a withdrawn interaction style and was 
observed in children with a high heritable tendency for negative affect. In that style, mother and 
child interactions were not contingent upon each other, suggesting a lack of joint engagement. The 
second was a volatile interaction style, observed in children with a low heritable tendency for 
negative affect. In these cases, mother and child interactions were highly contingent but negative. 
Our findings demonstrate essential differences in how dyadic interaction patterns vary according 
to level of depressive symptomology and heritable tendency for negative affect.

Introduction

Maternal depressive symptomology is associated with a range of important child outcomes 
including child externalizing behavior problems, lower intellectual functioning, and social 
exclusion by peers (Belsky, 1984; Goodman, 2007; Goodman et al., 2011; Kerr et al., 2013; 
Natsuaki et al., 2014). One of the mechanisms through which this is believed to occur is 
through the quality of maternal interactions with their children (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999; 
Goodman, 2007; Goodman et al., 2011). For example, mothers with depressive 
symptomology can be withdrawn from (Dix, Meunier, Lusk, & Perfect, 2012; Field, Healy, 
& LeBlanc, 1989; Leadbeater, Bishop, & Raver, 1996), or intrusive/negatively reactive 
towards their young children (Field, Healy, Goldstein, & Guthertz, 1990; Gelfand & Teti, 
1990; Henderson & Jennings, 2003), but many also maintain high levels of responsivity and 
involvement despite challenges to their mental health (Cohn & Tronick, 1989; Shaw et al., 
2006).

There is considerably less research on bi-directional influences of mother and infant 
influences on interaction quality (Pardini, Fite, & Burke, 2008; (Gross, Shaw, & Moilanen, 
2008), although notable exceptions do exist of research on the coordination of and emotional 
regulation between depressed mothers and their children (e.g., Tronick & Reck, 2009; Riva 
Crugnola, Ierardi, Albizzati, & Downing, 2016). In this research tradition, contingency 
refers to the quality of the bidirectional, moment-to-moment, and mutually influential 
interactions within dyadic pairs. Contingent negativity refers to the degree to which a 
partner's negative behavior is dependent (or conditional on) the other's prior negative 
behavior (Roben et al., 2015). For example, contingent negativity would be demonstrated if 
a mother tries to force her toddler to place a puzzle piece where she wants it, and the child 
responds by forcibly resisting her grasp. It represents one approach to quantifying coercive 
cycles in which a negative behavior begets a negative response. Coercive cycles have been 
repeatedly shown to predict escalation in conflict and poor outcomes in children (Patterson 
et al., 2002).

In the reverse, positive behavior can of course follow positive behavior. Synchrony and 
mutuality are two approaches that have been widely used to determine the degree to which 
one partner’s affect or responsiveness temporally follows the other partner’s expression or 
behavior (Feldman, 2015; Kim & Kochanska, 2012). Synchrony and mutuality within dyads 
predict positive self-regulation outcomes in children (Blair et al., 2011; Feldman, 
Greenbaum, & Yirmiya, 1999; Deater-Deckard & Petrill, 2004). Theoretically, negative 
behavior followed by negative behavior, and positive behavior followed by positive behavior, 
would both be considered examples of synchrony or mutuality (see Feldman, 2007 for 
review). However, much of the empirical work in synchrony and mutuality is conducted 
using low-conflict tasks like free-play that are more likely to encourage positivity and less

likely to elicit negativity (see Leclère et al., 2014 for review). In contrast, a conflictual task, 
like a cleanup task or a teaching task, tends to evoke higher contingent negativity (Rodriguez 
et al., 2005).

However, mothers and children tend to spend most of their time in mismatched states (e.g., 
the child is negative and the mother responds positively), rather than in matched states 
(Tronick & Cohn, 1989; Tronick, 1989). Thus, a method is needed to capture the degree to 
which one partner's behavior is dependent (or conditional on) the other's prior behavior, 
regardless of whether that behavior is positive or negative, and regardless of whether it is 
matched with the prior behavior. Here, we introduce the construct behavioral contingency 
which, like mutuality or synchrony, represents the overall contingency between partners. 
Critically, it captures congruent positive and negative responses, as well as mismatched 
responses. As this is the first study to measure mother-child behavioral contingency, it is not 
yet known if behavioral contingency will be moderated by mother and child characteristics.

In addition, research examining bidirectional mother-child interaction patterns tends to 
involve biologically-related mothers and children, where the influence of parenting is 
confounded with shared genetics. Sameroff’s (1975; 2009) seminal transactional model 
(which expanded on Bell’s (1968) theory on mother-child relationships) proposed that 
variations in children’s vulnerabilities to environmental stressors are the result of 
bidirectional, reciprocal influences between heritable child characteristics (e.g., 
temperament) and their environment (e.g., maternal depressive symptoms). Some children 
are more vulnerable to the effects of maternal depressive symptoms than others because of 
gene by environment (G x E) interactions (Goodman et al., 2011; Hammen, 2002; Rutter, 
2007). Therefore, in studies of biologically related mother-child dyads, if an infant or toddler 
of a depressed mother shows high contingent negativity, it’s unclear whether this negative 
reactivity is due to the dyad’s shared heritable influences for temperamental negative 
affectivity, the effect of the mother’s style of parenting associated with her depressive 
symptoms, or the combination of the two.

The parent-offspring adoption design used in the current study included measurement of 
both adoptive and birth mothers, allowing us to disentangle how heritable and environmental 
influences work together to predict adoptive mother-child interaction patterns. Focusing only 
on contingent negativity, previous research using the same sample as the current study found 
that, as adoptive mother’s depressive symptoms increased, children’s contingent negativity 
increased, which subsequently predicted later adoptive mother’s increase depressive 
symptoms (Roben et al., 2015). Notably, this last finding was only present if the child’s birth 
mother was depressed, suggesting a G x E interaction. We aim to build on this prior work 
through modeling of contingent negativity and behavioral contingency. Our two-pronged 
approach can provide a more comprehensive analysis of two possible ways that maternal 
depressive symptoms negatively affect children, through mother-child mutual negativity and 
overall responsivity (either matched or mismatched).

Further, Roben et al. (2015) used one-second intervals in their analyses, but there are strong 
reasons to suggest that such a brief period of time may not provide a sufficiently long 
observation window for a young child to respond, limiting the ability to capture valid

mother-child interaction patterns. For example, Tronick and Cohn (1989) used a data-driven 
approach for their observational coding and found that it took 3-5 seconds for mothers and 
their infants to repair disruptions in their interactions. There are of course substantive 
differences in construct between the repair of a disruption in a relationship, and behavioral 
contingency/contingent negativity, but the common concern is that there are currently no 
standardized rules for determining appropriate epoch length and lag for observation data. 
The length and lags chosen for any given study or group of studies could significantly 
impact results as they can be accounting for mere moments or up to a minute of interaction 
time.

In the current study, we use multivariate multilevel models to simultaneously model the 
associations between mother and child behaviors, and between broad characteristics of 
adoptive mothers and birth mothers. In this first study of behavioral contingency, we 
examined child and adoptive mother behavioral contingency, contingent negativity, and how 
these contingencies are associated with birth mother negative affect (as a heritable 
influence), current maternal depressive symptoms (as a proximal environmental influence), 
and the interaction between the two. We modeled adoptive mothers’ concurrent depressive 
symptoms and dyadic interaction patterns to capture the association of present depressive 
symptoms and dyadic interaction patterns because these dyadic interactions patterns have 
been associated with poor child outcomes (Goodman et al., 2011). While the timing of 
adoptive mother assessments is critical (given the risk for developing depression in the early 
days of adoption, see Mott, Schiller, Richards, O’Hara, & Stuart, 2011), the timing of birth 
mother assessments is less important because temperamental negative affect is a stable trait, 
whereas depressive symptoms change over time.

We note that birth mother negative affectivity was chosen as the heritable influence because 
it has moderate heritable associations with child negative affectivity, predicts young 
children’s externalizing behaviors, and evokes more harsh parenting (Goldsmith, Buss, & 
Lemery, 1997; Lipscomb et al., 2011, 2014). Difficult child temperament has also been 
shown to result in low behavioral contingency because mothers of difficult temperament 
children withdraw from their child, presumably due to the fact they are more stressful to 
parent (Koenig, Barry, & Kochanska, 2010).

1.1.  Hypotheses

For adoptive mothers and their children engaged in a difficult teaching task, we 
hypothesized first that (1) dyads with children whose birth mothers show higher negative 
affectivity would show lower maternal (mother reacting to child) and child (child reacting to 
mother) behavioral contingency and higher contingent negativity. This would mean that the 
dyad shows less overall contingency, but when there is negative behavior, the partners 
respond with negative behavior.

Second, based on previous research on the environmental associations between maternal 
depressive symptoms and mother-child relationship quality (Goodman, 2007), we also 
hypothesized that (2) adoptive mothers with higher depressive symptomology would show 
lower maternal and child behavioral contingency and higher contingent negativity.

Finally, we hypothesized that there would be a moderating effect in which (3) dyads with 
children whose birth mothers showed higher negative affectivity and whose adoptive 
mothers had higher levels of depressive symptoms, would demonstrate the lowest maternal 
and child behavioral contingency and the highest contingent negativity. We presumed that 
the children whose birth mothers reported higher negative affectivity would be more difficult 
temperamentally, and this higher negative affectivity would be associated with lower 
behavioral contingency. Dyads with children whose birth mothers show lower negative 
affectivity and adoptive mothers with few depressive symptoms were expected to 
demonstrate the highest maternal and child behavioral contingency and the lowest 
contingent negativity.

2.  Method

2.1.  Participants

The data used in the current study were from the Early Growth and Development Study 
(EGDS), a prospective parent-offspring adoption study including data from birth parents, 
adoptive parents, and adopted children (Leve et al., 2019). Table 1 provides demographic 
information on birth and adoptive mothers who were included in this study (n = 393).

The children in this study were 57.2% male, and 55.6% Caucasian, 19.3% multiracial, 13% 
African American, 10.9% Latino, < 1% Asian, < 1% American Indian, and < 1% ethnicity 
not reported. Families were recruited nationwide through various types of adoption agencies: 
public, private, religious, secular, open adoption, and closed adoption. All adoptions were to 
non-relative families; none of the children were adopted by parents who were genetically 
related to them. The median child age at placement was two days (SD = 12 days), and 
children had no significant medical conditions.

2.2.  Procedure

The birth mother and adoptive family in-person assessments were conducted by interviewers 
who completed a minimum of 40 hours of training. Birth mother assessments were 
conducted in a location convenient to the birth mothers and occurred at 18-months post-
partum. The adoptive family assessment occurred when the adopted child was 27-months of 
age. In-person assessments for birth mothers and the adoptive families lasted 2-3 hours and 
included self-report questionnaires, personal interview questions, and interviewer 
impressions, along with videotaped standardized tasks. In the current study, data from a 
microcoded dyadic interaction task, the Parent-Child Teaching Task, along with birth mother 
and adoptive mother questionnaire data were used for analyses.

2.3.  Measures

2.3.1.  Birth mother temperamental negative affectivity—The Adult Temperament 
Questionnaire(ATQ; Derryberry & Rothbart, 1988) was completed by the birth mother at 18-
months postpartum. The Negative Affectivity factor of the ATQ consists of subscales 
measuring levels of fear, sadness, anger, frustration, and discomfort. Mothers reported on a 
7-point scale that ranged from “extremely untrue” to “extremely true,” with higher scores 
representing higher levels of negative affectivity. Birth mother’s ratings were used to create

factor scales with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 7 (α = .81; See Table 1). This score 
was used to represent the heritable influences of temperamental negative affectivity on the 
child.

There was a large proportion of missing data (65% missing) for birth fathers, and therefore 
birth fathers’ temperamental negative affectivity scores were not included in the current 
analysis because of multivariate multilevel modeling’s limitation in its capacity to 
effectively handle such a high level of missing data.

2.3.2.  Adoptive mother depressive symptoms—The Beck Depression 
Inventory(BDI; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) was used to index the adoptive mother’s 
current depressive symptoms at the 27-month assessment. Adoptive mothers reported their 
depressive symptoms on a 3-point scale with higher scores representing the presence and 
severity of depressive symptoms. Items from the BDI assess multiple symptoms of 
depression, such as irritability, physical discomfort, guilt, and sadness. Adoptive mother 
depressive symptoms were calculated as the sum of the 20 BDI items (α = .71). For 65% of 
the sample the BDI did not include the suicidality item. As such, the suicidality item was 
removed from analyses. Scores from 0-13 are considered to be in the minimal range, 14-19 
is considered mild, 20-28 is considered moderate, and 29-63 is severe (BDI; Beck et al., 
1996). Table 1 provides means and standard deviations for adoptive mother depressive 
symptoms. Eleven of the adoptive mothers in this sample met criteria for mild depression 
(1.9% of the sample), one mother met criteria for severe depression (.3% of the sample), and 
no mothers met criteria for moderate depression in the sample.

2.3.3.  The adoptive mother and child interaction—The Parent-Child Teaching 
Task was used to examine adoptive mother-child dyadic interaction patterns at the 27-
months assessment. For this study, only the adoptive mothers and their adopted child 
observational data were included because we were interested in examining associations 
between maternal depressive symptoms and mother-child interactions. For same-sex 
adoptive couples, we included only the primary female caregiver because the analytic 
method used in this study was unable to model two adoptive parents of the same child. In the 
5-minute Parent-Child Teaching Task, mothers were instructed to show their children a 
difficult puzzle to observe individual differences in mothers’ abilities to scaffold interaction, 
children’s responses, and how dyads negotiated a task above the children’s developmental 
ability (e.g., Forman & Kochanska, 2001; Belsky et al., 2006; Page, Wilhelm, Gamble, & 
Card, 2010). This task has been used in previous research to analyze global ratings of 
constructs such as children’s engagement, parents’ positive regard for children, maternal 
sensitivity, parents’ intrusiveness, and parents’ supportive presence (Egeland & Hiester, 
1993).

The task was coded with a microcoding system (Moore, Teti, & Roben, 2009) designed for 
the study based on existing parent-child interaction rating systems (Cohn & Tronick, 1988; 
Moore & Calkins, 2004; Moore, Cohn, & Campbell, 2001). Mothers’ and children’s 
behaviors during the Parent-Child Teaching Taskwere coded by trained research assistants 
naïve to the hypotheses of the current study. Coders were assigned to teams to code either 
mothers’ behaviors or children’s behaviors and used an observational coding software

package (Interact with p.a.t.t.e.r.n. analysis module; Mangold International). The behaviors 
were coded in 1-second intervals, and most codes were not mutually exclusive so that coders 
could code all applicable behaviors. To establish inter-rater reliability, subsets of the cases 
were double-coded. For child codes, 18.9% of cases were double-coded (κ = .70). For 
mother codes, 22.2% of cases were double coded (κ = .70).

2.4.  Data Analytic Strategy

2.4.1.  Variable aggregation—Following prior research (Roben et al., 2015), the coded 
behaviors were collapsed into four theoretically derived composite variables: Positive 
Maternal Behavior (e.g., scaffold, positive touch, social bid), Negative Maternal Behavior 
(e.g., harsh touch, disengagement, off task, gaze away from toy and child), Positive Child 
Behavior (e.g., play with toy, approach toy, social bid, gaze at caregiver), and Negative Child 
Behavior (e.g., resist, move puzzle away, off task, proximity is outside of caregiver’s reach). 
The method for creating these composite variables was as follows: At each second, Positive 
Maternal Behavior was set to 1 if any of the coded behaviors that were positively focused on 
the child and task occurred (otherwise the variable was set to 0). Negative Maternal 
Behavior was set to 1 if any of the behaviors that were disengaged from the task or 
negatively focused on the child occurred. Positive Child Behavior was set to 1 if any of the 
behaviors that were positively focused on the task or parent occurred. Negative Child 
Behavior was set to 1 if any of the behaviors that were negatively focused on the parent and 
task or disengaged from the parent and task occurred. Mother Behavior was an aggregate of 
Positive Maternal Behavior and Negative Maternal Behavior. Child Behavior was an 
aggregate of Positive Child Behavior and Negative Child Behavior. The total number of 
mother and child positive and negative behaviors that were observed across the teaching task 
are reported in Table 2.

To establish which length of time had the best model fit, mothers’ and children’s time-series 
data were then collapsed into 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-second epochs, and the frequency of each 
composite variable within each epoch was aggregated (e.g., any 2 seconds of Positive 
Maternal Behavior in a 3-second epoch resulted in a value of 2 for that 3-second epoch). We 
used restricted maximum likelihood (REML) for these models because of its usefulness for 
fitting linear mixed models that include fixed and random effects (Raudenbush & Bryk, 
2002; Searle, Casella, & McCulloch, 1992).

2.4.2.  Multivariate Multilevel Modeling—This study used two multivariate 
multilevelmodels of time-series data (Hox, Moerbeek, & Van de Schoot, 2017; MacCallum, 
Kim, Malarkey, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1997) to assess: (1) behavioral contingency and (2) 
contingent negativity, hereafter referred to as behavioral contingency for simplicity. Each 
multilevel model evaluated the degree to which mother and child behavior at epoch 2 was 
affected by the other’s behavior at epoch 1, over and above their own behavior at epoch 1 
(i.e. autocorrelation).

We next asked whether heritable influences on children’s behavior (G; indexed by birth 
mother temperamental negative affectivity) and environment (E; indexed by adoptive 
mother’s depressive symptoms), moderated child and maternal behavioral contingency.

And finally, we created a G x E interaction term to determine whether the interaction of 
heritable and environmental factors influenced maternal and child behavioral contingency.

2.4.3.  Data preparation—In the full sample, there were 561 linked sets of participants: 
561 adopted children, 567 adoptive mothers, 552 adoptive fathers (this includes 41 same-sex 
adoptive parent families), 554 birth mothers, and 208 birth fathers. However, 17% of the 
dyads (n = 96) were not included in the models because they did not participate in the 
observation task, their task observations were missing because of audio/visual errors related 
to hardware malfunctions, or the dyad was not visible on the recording. There were other 
dyads who participated in the observation task but had missing adoptive mother report of 
depressive symptoms, biological mother report of negative temperament, or both (n = 72).

This missing data led to a final sample of 393 triads with sufficient data for the primary 
analyses. Of the dyads that were included in the model, their behavior was coded for a total 
of 48,083 of the 48,178 possible epochs (99.8% code rate). For data analysis, we used 
Little’s test for missing data used in this study, and the test statistic for data missing at 
random was not significant (χ2 = 1.79, p = .407). Therefore, the missing data were treated as 
missing (completely) at random.

To prepare the data, we person-centered the composite behaviors to independently test 
between- and within-person associations with the heritable influences and environmental 
influences (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 2003). This person-centered approach allows us to 
isolate and measure behavioral contingencies over and above the mother or child’s typical 
frequency of behavior during any 3-second epoch.

We also calculated individual-level residual deviations (i.e., random effects), which were not 
correlated with the residual error. Random effects parameters refer to deviations between 
each partner’s behavior at epoch 2 that varied between each dyad. We attempted random 
effects for autocorrelation effects and cross-lag effects, but the models did not converge 
because of the complexity of the model that could not accommodate more parameters. 
Similarly, we attempted to include covariates in the model, such as annual household 
income, adoptive mother’s education, and child gender, but those models did not converge 
because of the complexity of the model. We discuss the implications of the income/SES of 
our sample in the Discussion.

Finally, we ran behavioral contingency models with epoch lengths of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-
seconds and with a lag of 1, 2, or 3 epochs. Model fit statistics (Akaike information criteria, 
AIC; Bayesian information criteria) were calculated to determine which model had the best 
fit. We determined best model fit as a combination of low AIC and BIC, along with 
interpretability. Therefore, a model with low model fit that was uninterpretable might be an 
example of overfitting the model, and, thus, would not be chosen as the best fitting model. 
We also used restricted maximum likelihood (REML) for these models because of its 
usefulness for fitting linear mixed models that include fixed and random effects 
(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Searle et al., 1992).

Multivariate multilevel models were conducted by using nlme: Linear and Nonlinear Mixed 
Effects Models (nlme package version 3.1-137; Pinheiro, Bats, DebRoy, Sarkar, & R CORE 
TEAM, 2018) in R (Version 3.4.0; R Core Team, 2013). The multivariate multilevel models 
simultaneously calculate mother and child dyadic interaction patterns. The difference 
between the models is that the behavioral contingency model included positive and negative 
composite behavior, whereas the contingent negativity model only used negative composite 
behavior. Equations for these models can be found in the supplementary materials.

3.  Results

3.1.  Preliminary Analyses

Descriptive statistics of the primary study variables were computed with SPSS 25.0. 
Correlations between the aggregated coded parent composite behaviors and aggregated child 
composite behaviors are presented in Supplemental Table 1. The correlations between 
positive and negative behaviors were low or negative, suggesting that behavioral contingency 
and contingent negativity were distinct from each other (rs .02 to −.56). More specifically, 
there was a moderate negative correlation between positive and negative behaviors for 
children but not for mothers. Model fit statistics of behavioral contingency models with 
epoch lengths of 1-, 2-, and 3-seconds and a lag of 1, 2, or 3 epochs are presented in 
Supplemental Table 2. Model fit statistics of models with epoch lengths of 4- and 5- seconds 
are not presented because of their lack of interpretability. That is, the models with 4- and 5-
seconds epochs had nonsignificant autocorrelation of mother or child behavior at epoch 1 
and epoch 2. This result is a sign of a poor-fitting model because autocorrelation of behavior 
typically accounts for the majority of variance when predicting the frequency of an 
individual’s behavior at epoch 2.

Chi-square tests for model fit could not be calculated because of the difference in dataset 
length between models. For example, a dataset of 1-second long epochs with a lag of 1 is 
considerably longer than a dataset of 5-second long epochs with a lag of 5. Therefore, based 
on our best model fit parameters, the behavioral contingency model with 3-second long 
epochs and a lag of 1 was determined to show best model fit. We used 3-second long epochs 
and a lag of 1 for the contingent negativity model as well. This result was in line with 
Tronick and Cohn (1989), who found that mothers and children tend to take 3-5 seconds to 
repair disruptions in the interaction.

3.2.  27-Month Behavioral Contingency Model

Note, that we report unstandardized coefficients throughout our model to aid in 
interpretation. As described in Table 3, we found a significant autocorrelation for mother 
behavior, such that mother behavior at epoch 1 was associated with a higher frequency of 
mother behavior at epoch 2(βA1i = .419, p < .001, with 95% CI = [.409, .428]). We also 
found a similar autocorrelation for child behavior (βB1i = .537, p < .001, with 95% CI = 
[.528, .545]). Maternal and child behavioral contingency was also significant, such that child 
behavior at epoch 1 was associated with a lower frequency of mother behavior at epoch 2 
and mother behavior at epoch 1 was associated with a lower frequency of child behavior at

epoch 2 (βA2i =−.134, p < .001, with 95% CI = [−.197, −.071]; βB2i = −.094, p < .01, with 
95% CI = [−.165, −.023]).

Both birth mother’s negative affect and adoptive mother’s depressive symptoms were 
significantly associated with maternal behavioral contingency, and there was also a 
significant interaction between the two on maternal behavioral contingency (γA21 = .018, p 
< .01, with 95% CI = [−.197, −.071]; (γA22 = .019, p = .021 l, with 95% CI = [.003, .034]; 
γA23 = −.005, p = .001, with 95% CI = [−.007, −.002]). As seen in Fig. 1, adoptive mothers 
with higher depressive symptoms were less contingent to children whose birth mothers 
reported high vs. low negative affectivity. Interestingly, however, adoptive mothers with few 
depressive symptoms were more contingent to children whose birth mothers reported high 
negative affectivity than those whose birth mothers reported low negative affectivity.

The main effect of birth mother’s negative affectivity associated with child behavioral 
contingency was also significant (γB22 = .018, p = .046, with 95% CI = [.001, .035]). As 
negative affectivity increased, children showed a higher frequency of behavior following 
mother’s behavior.

3.3.  27-Month Negative Contingency Model

Again, note that we report unstandardized coefficients throughout our model to aid in 
interpretation. As described in Table 4, we found a significant autocorrelation for mother’s 
negative behavior, such that mother’s negative behavior at time 1 was associated with a 
higher frequency of mother’s negative behavior at time 2 (βA1i = .289, p < .001, with 95% 
CI = [.279, .299]). We also found a similar autocorrelation for child’s negative behavior 
(βB1i = .493, p < .001, with 95% CI = [.485, .502]). Maternal and child contingent 
negativity was not significant, such that child behavior at time 1 was not associated with 
frequency of mother behavior at time 2 and mother behavior at time 1 was not associated 
with frequency of child behavior at time 2 (βA2i = .029, p = .375, with 95% CI = 
[−.035, .093]; βB2i = −.044, p = .246, with 95% CI = [−.117, .030]).

Adoptive mother’s depressive symptoms and birth mother’s negative affect were not 
associated with maternal contingent negativity, and the interaction between the two on 
maternal contingent negativity was also not significant. The main effect of adoptive mother’s 
depressive symptoms in the prediction of child contingent negativity was significant, and 
there was a significant interaction between adoptive mother’s depressive symptoms and birth 
mother’s negative affectivity on child contingent negativity (γB21 = .012, p = .048, with 95% 
CI = [.001, .025]; (γB23 = −.003, p = .025, with 95% CI = [−.006, −.001]). As seen in Fig. 2, 
and contrary to our expectations, for dyads of mothers with higher depressive symptoms, 
children with birth mothers who reported higher negative affectivity showed lower 
contingent negativity than those whose birth mothers reported lower negative affectivity. For 
dyads with mothers with fewer depressive symptoms, children with birth mothers with 
higher negative affectivity showed higher contingent negativity than other children with 
similar mothers.

4.  Discussion

Page 11

Goodman et al. (2011) identified a need for genetically informed research on mother-child 
interaction patterns that can clarify potential mechanisms of risk transmission of depressive 
symptoms from mothers to their young children. In this study we examined both behavioral 
contingency and contingent negativity to evaluate two theorized mechanisms of risk 
transmission. As maternal depressive symptoms increased, there were two distinct 
interaction patterns based on the dyad’s characteristics that matched previously theorized 
dyadic interactions (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999).

The first dyadic pattern resembled a withdrawn interaction style. Mothers showed low 
behavioral contingency and children showed low contingent negativity. This interaction style 
suggests a dyad where the mother and child are not as jointly engaged in the task as other 
dyads. The second dyadic pattern resembled a volatile interaction style. As maternal 
depressive symptomology increased, mothers showed higher behavioral contingency, and 
children showed higher contingent negativity. This would be a dyad where the mother and 
child are highly engaged in the task together, but when mothers acted negatively, their 
children responded more negatively than other children.

These dyadic interaction patterns are influenced by both heritable and environmental factors. 
Based on previous work, we had initially predicted that both adoptive and birth mother 
characteristics would be a risk factor for high contingent negativity (Goldsmith et al., 1997; 
Goodman, 2007; Lipscomb et al., 2011, 2014). However, in contrast to these expectations, 
children whose birth mothers had high negative affectivity showed the lowest contingent 
negativity. In these dyads, as adoptive mother’s depressive symptoms increased, children 
demonstrated a withdrawn interaction style. Conversely, as depressive symptoms increased, 
children whose birth mothers reported low negative affectivity showed a volatile interaction 
style. We found these patterns to be particularly interesting because even though few 
adoptive mothers in this sample reported clinical levels of depression, maternal depressive 
symptoms was still associated with differences in the parent-child interaction.

Prior research has shown that as maternal depressive symptomology increases, behavioral 
contingency decreases (Goodman & Gotlib, 1999). Notably, our study suggests that this is 
the case primarily for mothers of young children whose birth mothers self-report high 
negative affect. We speculate that such children may have a predisposition for more 
contingent negativity than other children. This in turn might lead to mothers becoming less 
behaviorally contingent because they have developed an expectation of unpleasant responses 
from their children. Similarly, children’s low contingent negativity may arise as an early 
form of learned helplessness. That is, they may show less contingent negativity in response 
to repeated maternal intrusive behavior. Low contingent negativity could also be linked with 
low maternal behavioral contingency, indicating that this dyad is not as jointly engaged as 
other dyads.

In contrast, the volatile mother-child interaction pattern occurred in dyads composed of 
children whose birth mothers reported low negative affectivity. As maternal depressive 
symptoms increased, these dyads showed higher maternal behavioral contingency paired

with high child contingent negativity. Children who are less negatively reactive are better 
able to stay on task than other children (Goldsmith et al., 1997). These children may 
therefore experience their mothers’ level of contingency as intrusive because of their low 
heritable tendency for negative affectivity. This volatile interaction style may lead to a 
recurring cycle of negative mother-child interactions similar to Patterson’s (2002) coercive 
circle. Prior research had found similar patterns in young infants, such that mothers who 
were intrusive when their children were distressed showed more joint hostility in their 
interactions (Beebe et al., 2010).

Importantly, behavioral contingency is unique in its ability to capture both matched and 
mismatched responses. Previous contingency constructs have tended to focus on moments of 
matched affect, whereas behavioral contingency is better able to capture mismatched states 
which are most common in mother-child interactions (Tronick & Cohn, 1989). One example 
of a frequent mismatched response is structured parenting that is defined as moments when 
parents provide clear instructions and redirect children to the task at hand after they are off-
task or disruptive. Previous work demonstrated that specific parent directives to children to 
stay on task is associated with better outcomes for children at high genetic risk for disruptive 
behavior (Leve et al., 2009). However, constructs like synchrony or mutuality would not be 
able to capture this adaptive parenting practice. Therefore, our construct of behavioral 
contingency expands on prior mother-child interaction research to allow researchers to 
capture these common mismatched responses between parents and children that other 
constructs could not.

We note that contingency analyses lack an agreed-upon standard for epoch length. Previous 
research used epochs of various lengths of 1-,3-, 5- and even 30-seconds (Feldman, 2003; 
Lindsey, Cremeens, Colwell, & Caldera, 2009; Roben et al., 2015; Tronick & Cohn, 1989). 
This has resulted in some studies capturing mere moments up to a minute of interaction 
time. Epoch length would, of course, influence the patterning of results and their meaning. 
Because it takes more than a second for a partner to perceive the other’s behavior, interpret 
it, and engage in a motor response, an epoch of one second would be too brief a period of 
time to capture the back and forth dynamic of dyad partners. Conversely, an epoch of 30 
seconds would be too long; within that time frame, multiple actions and reactions could have 
occurred, but that variance would be collapsed into a single measurement score of behavior. 
However, the theoretical difference between 3- and 5-seconds is hard to parse, and the data-
driven approach may help to empirically ascertain optimal epoch length. Similarly, previous 
research used a lag of one epoch to measure contingencies, and our study adds to the 
evidence-base for using lag-1 in contingency research.

One of the strengths of the current study was the use of a data-driven strategy to identify the 
most appropriate epoch and lag lengths for analysis. Comparing model fit between models 
with 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-second epochs and the effect of one epoch to the next of lag-1, 
lag-2, and lag-3, we found that a 3-second epoch with lag-1 had the best model fit based on 
fit statistics and interpretability. Thus, future work in contingency research should use a 
data-driven process and carefully consider the epoch length and lag that may vary based 
children’s developmental status.

Our findings suggest that clinicians working with mothers with depressive symptoms may 
wish to observe dyadic interactions before implementing treatment. Notably, our study is 
unable to suggest or describe an “ideal” level of behavioral contingency, which is likely to 
vary by the specific behavioral context as well as the developmental needs of the child. It 
might be appropriate to reduce some mothers’ level of contingency to their children so that 
the children can practice more autonomy. However, for other mothers, it might be 
appropriate to increase the mothers' level of contingency to their children to stimulate a more 
interactive mother-child dyadic interaction. Intervention programs, such as Attachment and 
Biobehavioral Catch-up (Bernard et al., 2012), Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (Eyberg, 
1988), and other attachment-based intervention programs (e.g. PRERAYMI; Riva Crugnola 
et al., 2016) explicitly have clinicians focus on improving the quality of the parent-child 
relationship.The results of this study suggest that these interaction patterns should be closely 
monitored to guide recommendations for comparable treatment modalities. While this study 
was unable to examine how dyadic interaction patterns affected mother and child outcomes, 
it illuminates distinct differences in how dyads interact based on their characteristics.

5.  Limitations and Future Directions

Adoptive families in this study were drawn from a predominantly White, higher SES, 
community sample with relatively low levels of depressive symptomology. It would 
therefore be important to replicate the findings of the study to see whether they are present 
in more racially, socioeconomically, and clinically diverse samples. Furthermore, we chose 
to focus on birth mother temperamental negative affectivity as a proxy influence on child 
negative emotionality. However, replications and extensions of these findings also should 
consider other indices of genetic influences on the child, such as birth parents’ general 
psychopathology, internalizing problems, or other characteristics. Although there were 
significant associations between the interaction of birth mother and adoptive mother 
characteristics with mother-child contingencies, it should be noted that the confidence 
intervals were close to zero. It is possible that other birth parent characteristics may show 
stronger links with mother-child contingencies than temperamental negative affectivity in 
birth mothers. That being said, to inform our understanding of how dyadic interaction 
patterns are associated with parental characteristics and behaviors, we also recommend 
future research examine birth fathers’ temperamental characteristics, adoptive father-child 
observation data, and the influence of child gender.

A strength of our study was in the inclusion of mismatched states in the evaluation of dyadic 
responsiveness in our behavioral contingency model. However, it may be that the 
directionality of mismatched responses may have differential effects on the mother-child 
relationship. For example, a mother responding negatively to a child’s positive behavior may 
likely predict outcomes that are distinct from a mother responding positively to a child’s 
negative behavior. However, an investigation of these mismatched responses was beyond the 
scope of this study, and we recommend that future work examine these mismatched 
responses using the same statistical approach as our contingent negativity model. Relatedly, 
we examined moment-to-moment dyadic interactions at age 27-months. To determine 
whether these associations persist into the early preschool and school entry periods, we 
recommend future studies also examine the predictive power of mother and child

contingencies on child behavior problems and maternal well-being at these later ages. It may 
be that the lower maternal contingency of depressed mothers is a protective factor because it 
reduces children’s exposure to aversive characteristics of maternal depressive symptoms. 
Roben et al. (2015) had found that higher child contingent negativity at 18-months was 
related to greater maternal depressive symptoms at 27-months. Future studies are 
encouraged to determine whether mothers showed less contingency in response to countless 
negative interactions with more negative reactive adopted children, whereas other mothers 
showed more contingency with their less negative reactive adopted children.

6.  Summary and Conclusions

Although an extensive literature exists that has documented the negative influence of 
maternal depressive symptoms on child outcome, the literature documenting bidirectional 
influences on interaction quality is substantially smaller, and the literature examining 
moderating influences on these transactions, smaller still. To help fill this relative gap in the 
literature, and using a data-driven approach to identify the most appropriate epoch length, 
this study examined the moderating influences of heritable child characteristics and maternal 
depressive symptoms on bidirectional transactions between mothers’ and children. This 
approach offered surprising findings. Even among mothers with generally normative levels 
of depressive symptoms, we found that as maternal depressive symptoms increased, dyads 
composed of children whose birth mothers reported high negative affectivity showed the 
lowest level of maternal behavioral contingency and child contingent negativity, in what we 
interpreted as an early form of learned helplessness. Also, as maternal depressive symptoms 
increased, dyads composed of children whose birth mothers reported low negative affectivity 
showed more maternal behavioral contingency and more child contingent negativity than 
other dyads. A more nuanced understanding of mother-child interaction patterns may help 
interventionists tailor their treatments to increase or decrease maternal behavioral 
contingency as an intervention target, thereby reducing the deleterious effects of maternal 
depressive symptoms.
