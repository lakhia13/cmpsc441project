Abstract

Mindfulness meditation training has been shown to increase resting-state functional connectivity between nodes of the
frontoparietal executive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]) and the default mode network (posterior
cingulate cortex [PCC]). We investigated whether these effects generalized to a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
course and tested for structural and behaviorally relevant consequences of change in connectivity. Healthy,
meditation-naïve adults were randomized to either MBSR (N = 48), an active (N = 47) or waitlist (N = 45) control group.
Participants completed behavioral testing, resting-state fMRI scans and diffusion tensor scans at pre-randomization (T1),
post-intervention (T2) and ∼5.5 months later (T3). We found increased T2–T1 PCC–DLPFC resting connectivity for MBSR
relative to control groups. Although these effects did not persist through long-term follow-up (T3–T1), MBSR participants
showed a significantly stronger relationship between days of practice (T1 to T3) and increased PCC–DLPFC resting
connectivity than participants in the active control group. Increased PCC–DLPFC resting connectivity in MBSR participants
was associated with increased microstructural connectivity of a white matter tract connecting these regions and increased
self-reported attention. These data show that MBSR increases PCC–DLPFC resting connectivity, which is related to increased
practice time, attention and structural connectivity.

Introduction

Mindfulness meditation practice aims to improve well-being
through training attention to present-moment experience
(Kabat-Zinn, 1990). There is growing evidence that mindfulness
meditation training improves multiple aspects of attention and

executive functioning, including improved working memory
(Zeidan et al., 2010), decreased rumination and distraction
(Jain et al., 2007) and decreased mind-wandering (Mrazek
et al., 2013). Moreover, decreases in mind-wandering mediated
improvements in cognitive performance following mindfulness
meditation training (Mrazek et al., 2013). These behavioral

changes following mindfulness practice suggest dynamic
alterations in brain networks responsible for implementing
attention and executive function.

The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is the central hub of
the default mode network (DMN; Spreng et al., 2013), which is
a set of brain regions in which activation is correlated at rest
and is associated with mind-wandering and self-referential pro-
cessing in task-based fMRI (Mason et al., 2007; Andrews-Hanna
et al., 2010). A cross-sectional study of long-term mindfulness
meditation practitioners by Brewer et al. (2011) found reduced
activation of this network at rest and during meditation practice,
which was interpreted as reflecting reduced mind-wandering
and increased focus on present moment experience. However,
research to date has not provided direct, supporting evidence
for this interpretation. Brewer et al. (2011) also found increased
resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the PCC
and a node of the frontoparietal executive control network (FPN),
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in long-term mind-
fulness practitioners compared to non-meditators, suggesting a
functional mechanism by which attentional improvements and
reductions in mind-wandering may manifest. The FPN coordi-
nates activation between the DMN and the dorsal attention net-
work, for example for top-down modulation of mind-wandering
(MacDonald et al., 2000; Smallwood et al., 2012). Nodes of the
FPN, including DLPFC, are also active during mind-wandering,
and one interpretation infers this activation as constraining or
regulating mind-wandering (Christoff et al., 2009; Christoff et al.,
2016). A recent study found that PCC–DLPFC RSFC also increased
following short-term mindfulness meditation training relative to
an active control intervention (Creswell et al., 2016).

Despite this progress, prior research is limited by small
sample sizes, use of non-standard interventions, lack of mean-
ingful behavioral correlates and failure to include diffusion-
weighted measures of structural connectivity. In the present
study we evaluated the impact of the most commonly used
mindfulness intervention—Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
(MBSR). MBSR is manualized, widely available and has been
adapted for use in a variety of populations and contexts
(Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Furthermore, arguments regarding the prac-
tical significance of mindfulness meditation-related changes
in functional connectivity would be more compelling if these
findings were mirrored by changes in the microstructure of
pathways connecting these regions, and/or accompanied by
alterations in behavioral processes served by these networks.

In the current study we sought to conceptually replicate
and extend prior work showing that short-term mindfulness
meditation training increases PCC–DLPFC RSFC in a randomized
controlled trial of MBSR. We employed a validated, active control
intervention well-matched to MBSR, the Health Enhancement
Program (HEP) (MacCoon et al., 2012), and utilized a sample
size that was approximately double that used in prior research
(Creswell et al., 2016). We defined a PCC seed and PFC target
region of interest (ROI) based on coordinates reported in Creswell
et al. (2016); we refer to this region as ‘LPFC’, as these coordinates
are anterior and ventral to the canonical DLPFC that is part
of the FPN. We also investigated PCC connectivity with a
more canonical, anatomically-defined DLPFC target ROI, the
middle frontal gyrus (MFG; Petrides and Pandya, 1999; Kim
et al., 2012; Ptak, 2012) from the Harvard-Oxford Atlas (Craddock
et al., 2012). We examined individual differences in practice
duration to determine whether there was a dosage effect on
changes in RSFC. Finally, we investigated associations between
increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC and decreased mind-wandering,
and with microstructural connectivity of a white matter tract

connecting PCC and DLPFC, the superior longitudinal fasciculus
(SLF). Thus, the current study enables us to examine with
rigorous design and methodology, the efficacy of mindfulness
meditation training in altering the structure and function of
brain circuits associated with mind-wandering and attention
and their behavioral correlates.

Methods

This study is registered as a clinical trial with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT02157766).

Participants

We recruited 140 healthy human participants (average age
44.3 ± 12.8 years; 83 female)
from Madison, WI, and the
surrounding community using flyers, online advertisements and
advertisements in local media. Recruitment materials described
the study as researching ‘the impact of health wellness classes
on the brain and body’. Sixteen participants had RSFC data
excluded from baseline analysis due to excessive motion
(described below; n = 11) or anatomical brain abnormalities as
determined by a radiologist (n = 5). Participants were randomly
assigned to one of three groups following baseline data collec-
tion: MBSR, the HEP active control group, or a waitlist control
group (WL). Participants were block randomized following
stratification based on gender (male and female) and age (25–
39, 40–50 and 51–65 years). The intervention procedures were
identical to those detailed by MacCoon et al. (2012). Twenty-nine
additional participants were excluded from analysis of pre/post-
differences: 16 participants withdrew prior to T2; 6 participants
were excluded for failure to attend more than 1 HEP or MBSR
class; 1 participant had poor data quality (severe signal dropout
in PFC); 1 participant was excluded for medical reasons; and 5
participants were excluded due to excessive motion during the
T2 scan. Thus, there were 31 MBSR (average age 41.4 ± 12.9 years;
18 female), 34 HEP (average age 43.6 ± 13.1 years; 22 female) and
30 WL (average age 43.0 ± 12.0 years; 19 female) participants in
analyses of T2–T1 RSFC. An additional 10 participants withdrew
prior to T3 and 3 were excluded for excessive motion at the
third scan, resulting in 29 MBSR (average age 41.1 ± 13.5 years;
17 female), 27 HEP (average age 43.7 ± 13.4 years; 16 female)
and 29 WL (average age 44.0 ± 11.7 years; 18 female) for T3–T1
RSFC analyses. A subset of participants completed the Emotional
Styles Questionnaire (ESQ), which was introduced subsequent
to the onset of data collection due to availability of the measure:
25 MBSR (average age 40.2 ± 12.5 years; 12 female), 24 HEP
(average age 42.0 ± 13.5 years; 13 female) and 21 WL (average
age 41.6 ± 10.6 years; 12 female).

Participants were excluded if any of the following applied,
due to their potential impact on the current analyses or other
aspects of the larger study in which they were enrolled: reg-
ular use of psychotropic or nervous system altering medica-
tion; psychiatric diagnosis in the past year or history of bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; color blind-
ness; currently participating in another clinical trial; current
asthma diagnosis; currently diagnosed with a sleep disorder or
regularly taking prescribed sleeping medications; current night
shift worker; significant training or practice in meditation or
mind-body techniques such as yoga or Tai-Chi; expert in phys-
ical activity, music or nutrition (for HEP); any history of brain
damage or seizures; medical problems that would affect the
participant’s ability to participate in study procedures. Written,
informed consent was obtained from all participants according

to the Declaration of Helsinki (WMA, 2013) and the study was
approved by the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board at
the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Data collection

Participants completed a baseline data collection visit prior to
randomization, a second visit following the 8-week intervention
period and a third visit ∼5–6 months after the second visit. At
each of these times, participants attended a 24 h laboratory visit
that included an MRI scan and the ESQ (Kesebir et al., n.d.) among
other measures as part of a larger multisession, multiproject
study. The ESQ consists of a 1–7 Likert scale with 1 = strongly dis-
agree and 7 = strongly agree. One of the ESQ subscales provided a
measure of attention that was most relevant to the hypotheses
of the current study, and items included ‘I do not get distracted
easily, even when I am in a situation in which a lot is going on’
and ‘I sometimes feel like I have very little control over where my
attention goes’ (reverse-coded). Experimenters were blind to the
group assignment during data collection. All participants were
given monetary compensation for their participation.

Experience sampling

Experience Sampling was conducted during the week prior to
and following the intervention period (14 days total). Participants
provided their cellular phone numbers and available 8 h periods
for each of the 14 days. Participants had a choice of receiving
text messages six, seven or eight times a day, and received a text
message every 90 min on average. The text message contained
a question assessing mind-wandering: ‘Was your attention on
the activity you were performing?’ Participants were asked to
respond with a number from 1 (attention is not on the task) to
9 (attention is completely on the task at hand). On average par-
ticipants responded to 82% of text messages they received. The
response window was set to the time between two successive
messages such that participants were given until the next mes-
sage arrived to respond to the current message. If participants
sent two responses in-between messages, the second response
was discarded. The ratings across all 7 days of the week for each
time period (pre/post-intervention) were averaged to obtain a
mean attention rating for each participant at T1 and T2.

Image acquisition

Images were acquired on a GE MR750 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner
with a 32-channel head coil. Anatomical scans consisted of a
high-resolution 3D T1-weighted inversion recovery fast gradient
echo image (450 ms inversion time; 256 × 256 in-plane resolu-
tion; 256 mm field of view (FOV); 192 × 1.0 mm axial slices). A
12 min functional resting-state scan run was acquired using a
gradient echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (360 volumes;
repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/Flip, 2000/20 ms/75◦; 224 mm
FOV; 64 × 64 matrix; 3.5 × 3.5 mm in-plane resolution; 44
interleaved sagittal slices; 3 mm slice thickness with 0.5 mm
gap). The in-plane resolution was decreased after the first 21
participants from 3.5 × 3.5 to 2.33 × 3.5 mm to better address
sinus-related artifacts, resulting in a matrix of 96 × 64. Diffusion-
weighted images (DWIs) were acquired with single-shot spin-
echo EPI sequence (TR/TE/Flip, 8575/76.6 ms/90o; 75 × 2 mm
interleaved sagittal slices; 2.0 mm isotropic voxels). In total,
63 DWIs were acquired along non-collinear diffusion encoding
directions across three b-values of 500/800/2000 s/mm2 (9/18/36

directions, respectively), while six additional images with no
diffusion encoding (i.e. b = 0 s/mm2) were acquired. Parallel
acquisition with a geometric reduction factor of two was used
to reduce image acquisition time and distortions from magnetic
field inhomogeneities. The total time for the multiple b-value
DTI acquisition was 10 min.

Image processing: RSFC

Functional
images were processed using a combination of
AFNI (Cox, 1996) (versions 17.3) and FMRI Expert Analysis Tool
Version 6.00, part of FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL; Smith et al.,
2004), including the following steps: removal of the first four
volumes, motion correction with MCFLIRT (Jenkinson et al.,
2002), BET (Smith, 2002) brain extraction and registration of the
subject’s functional data with their anatomical image using the
boundary-based registration approach (Greve and Fischl, 2009).
A 12 degrees of freedom (DOF) affine transformation using FLIRT
(Jenkinson et al., 2002) was followed by FNIRT nonlinear trans-
formation to register each subject’s functional data to Montreal
Neurological Institute 152 space. Images were segmented into
white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid with FAST
for use as masks that were eroded using a 3 × 3 × 3 voxel
kernel and then used to generate ROI-averaged time series
serving as nuisance regressors (along with their derivatives
and the six motion regressors) with AFNI’s 3dDeconvolve.
Images were smoothed with a 5 mm full-width half-maximum
Gaussian kernel.

We extracted the time series from a spherical PCC seed with
a 4 mm radius defined based on coordinates from Creswell
et al. (2016). We regressed this time series back onto each sub-
ject’s data using AFNI’s 3dDeconvolve, which also censored high-
motion time points (>0.2 mm framewise displacement; Power
et al., 2014). Participants were excluded from analysis if they had
<6 min of data due to >50% of data points censored for motion.
Two sets of target ROIs were defined: a bilateral DLPFC ROI,
based on MFG from the Harvard-Oxford atlas (Craddock et al.,
2012) thresholded at 50% probability for small-volume-corrected
voxelwise analysis, which was split into left and right for ROI
analysis, and left and right LPFC ROIs defined as 10 mm spheres
around coordinates provided in Creswell et al. (2016). Resting-
state fMRI connectivity was assessed based on the Fisher-Z
transformed (FZT) correlation between the PCC seed and every
other voxel in the brain for the voxelwise analysis and separately
for each of the target ROIs.

Image processing: DTI

DWIs were corrected for between-volume head motion and eddy
currents using FSL’s eddy tool (Andersson and Sotiropoulos,
2016), while diffusion encoding gradient directions were addi-
tionally corrected for rotations (Leemans and Jones, 2009). Brain
extraction was performed using FSL’s BET tool (Smith, 2002),
and maps of diffusion tensors were calculated using the robust
estimation of tensors by outlier rejection (Chang et al., 2005)
algorithm as implemented by the diffusion imaging in python
open-source package (Garyfallidis et al., 2014). Quantitative maps
of functional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial dif-
fusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) were derived from the
diffusion tensors (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996).

A population-specific template was created from a represen-
tative subset of the subject data to minimize coordinate system
induced bias. Affine and diffeomorphic registration as imple-

mented in DTI-TK (Zhang et al., 2006) were used for estimating
the spatial transformations. Data from the individual subjects
were spatially normalized to the estimated population-specific
template. The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) ICBM-DTI-81 FA
template (Mori et al., 2005) was co-registered to our population-
specific FA template using diffeomorphic registration as imple-
mented by the Advanced Normalization Tools (Avants and Gee,
2004) software package. Deep white matter labels included as
part of the JHU template were warped into the space of our
population-specific template using nearest neighbor interpo-
lation. Right and left hemisphere SLF ROIs were then inverse
warped to the native space of each participant using the inverse
of the subject-specific spatial transformation obtained from DTI-
TK. Median FA, MD, RD and AD in these subject level SLF ROIs
were then calculated. The median was used over the mean in
order to be robust to outlier voxels within the ROIs.

Statistical analysis

The analysis plan for this study was pre-registered on the Open
Science Framework at https://osf.io/vrmz9/register/5771ca429
ad5a1020de2872e. The analytic plan said linear models looking
at T2 and T3 adjusting for T1 would be used, but we instead used
T3–T1 and T2–T1 differences in our models, for consistency
with analyses in other studies that were part of the larger
project in which this study was embedded. We also changed
the cutoff for the maximum number of TRs censored for motion
from 25% to 50%, given that the resting-state scans were about
twice as long in duration than those in prior studies on which
this cutoff was defined. Analyses of baseline data regressed
the T1 measures on group or other variables of interest. For
each analysis examining changes due to MBSR, we computed
difference scores (T2–T1 or T3–T1), which were regressed on
group to test the effect of MBSR compared to HEP or to WL.
Within-group analyses tested the intercept of the linear model
for the difference score, reflecting whether or not the change in
the dependent variable was significantly different than zero.
Comparisons between two different variables regressed the
difference score for one variable on the difference scores for the
second variable. All tests were conducted using linear models
from the “lm” function (for linear modeling) in the stats package
in R (R Core Team, 2015). All analyses included covariates for
age and gender, and analyses of RSFC included an additional
covariate for the change in the resting-state scan acquisition
(as described above). Significance of results were consistent
regardless of inclusion of the covariates, except where noted in
the text. All results are reported after removing outliers based
on Cook’s D, with a cutoff threshold of 4/(N-P) for data points
disconnected from the distribution (where N = sample size and
P = number of parameters in the model) as determined by the
modelCaseAnalysis function of the lmSupport package (Curtin,
2015) in R (R Core Team, 2015). The significance of results is
consistent with or without outliers included, except where
indicated. We used a false discovery rate correction to control for
multiple comparisons for each family of tests with the p.adjust
function in the stats package in R (R Core Team, 2015), and the
corrected p-values are indicated by p

RSFC analysis

In order to test for intervention effects, we computed difference
maps for the T2 or T3 map subtracting the T1 map. We assessed
the effects of mindfulness meditation on PCC–DLPFC RSFC by
extracting the average RSFC FZT difference score across two sets

of ROIs: (i) the anatomically-defined DLPFC ROI (split between
left and right hemispheres of the Harvard-Oxford-defined MFG)
and (ii) two spheres of 10 mm radius in left and right LPFC
centered on coordinates provided by Creswell et al. (2016). The
anatomical DLPFC ROIs provided a means to examine connec-
tivity in a more ‘canonical’ DLPFC region than the spherical ROIs
defined from Creswell et al. (2016) and were also broader than
the spherical ROIs. In addition, we examined group differences
in a voxelwise fashion within the DLPFC ROI. We conducted a
secondary voxelwise analysis across the whole brain to identify
other regions that might differ in connectivity between groups
and to test for specificity of changes to PCC–DLPFC RSFC. Voxel-
wise analyses were thresholded at P < 0.05 controlling for family-
wise error (FWE) using threshold-free cluster enhancement with
FSL’s randomize (Winkler et al., 2014).

Within the MBSR group, we tested relationships between
PCC–DLPFC RSFC and two measures of mind-wandering as
potential behaviorally relevant outcomes of stronger connec-
tivity between these regions: self-reported attention on the
ESQ (Kesebir et al., n.d.) and experience sampling of mind-
wandering via text messaging. We included difference scores
of the attentional measure as a covariate of interest for each
participant in a voxelwise analysis within the anatomical
DLPFC. We also examined this relationship in an ROI analysis
by extracting the average PCC RSFC from the left and right
anatomical DLPFC ROIs, which were entered as the independent
variables in linear models with the attention measure (T2–T1 for
both variables).

DTI analysis

We tested whether MBSR-related changes in PCC–DLPFC RSFC
were associated with changes in the SLF using DTI measures.
The median values for FA, MD, RD and AD of the SLF ROIs were
entered into a principle component analysis (PCA; Zeestraten
et al., 2016; McLaughlin et al., 2018), using the prcomp function
in R (R Core Team, 2015) to construct a right and left hemisphere
composite of the underlying microstructure. The first principle
component was used as a representative composite of white
matter microstructure, as this accounted for the greatest covari-
ance between the four DTI parameters (77.1% for the right and
80.0% for the left). The factor loadings for FA, RD, MD and AD were
0.44, −0.54, −0.56 and −0.45 for the right side, respectively; and
0.45, −0.53, −0.56 and −0.46 for the left side, respectively. Thus,
larger values of the microstructure composite are indicative of
higher anisotropy and lower diffusivity, which is generally inter-
preted as a superior white matter microstructure (Basser and
Jones, 2002; Jones et al., 2013). DTI values at T2 were computed
using the weights from this first principle component of the PCA
analysis using the predict function in R (R Core Team, 2015).

Voxelwise analysis. There were no regions in which PCC RSFC
differed for MBSR participants compared to HEP or WL at
baseline in the whole-brain analysis. MBSR participants showed
significant increases in PCC RSFC with a network of regions
that included DLPFC [primarily inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)] from
T1 to T2 in the voxelwise, whole-brain analysis (Figure 2A).
MBSR participants had significantly increased PCC RSFC with
a region in right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) compared to
HEP (Figure 2B) and no significant differences compared to
WL. No statistically significant differences were observed in
PCC–DLPFC RSFC when comparing MBSR to control groups in
the wholebrain, voxelwise analysis. However, at a whole-brain
threshold of P < 0.10, MBSR participants had increased PCC
RSFC with right DLPFC (primarily IFG) relative to HEP and with
left frontal pole relative to WL (Figure 1C and D), among other
regions (see Table 1 for detailed cluster information). There were
no regions with significant (or marginal) changes in PCC RSFC
within HEP or WL, and no regions where HEP or WL increased
in PCC RSFC relative to MBSR (either significantly or at a
trend level).

MBSR participants had increased PCC RSFC with right DLPFC
in the small-volume-corrected, voxelwise analysis (Figure 3A).
No significant group differences were observed in the voxelwise
analysis restricted to the anatomical DLPFC ROI when comparing
MBSR to control groups. However, at a threshold of P < 0.10,
MBSR participants had increased PCC RSFC with right DLPFC
relative to HEP (Figure 3B). We observed the same pattern for
MBSR compared to WL; however, at baseline WL participants also
had higher PCC RSFC than MBSR participants in an overlapping
cluster of right DLPFC (Figure 3C). There was no difference in
PCC–DLPFC RSFC between MBSR and HEP at baseline.

There were no regions across the whole brain or within the
small-volume-corrected anatomical DLPFC that showed signifi-
cant group differences in PCC RSFC from T1 to T3.

Experience sampling

Within the MBSR group, there was no significant relationship
between changes in PCC–DLPFC RSFC and mind-wandering

corrected for FWE), nor in the ROI analyses [right DLPFC:

Fig. 4. Effects of MBSR practice duration. (A) MBSR participants had stronger PCC–DLPFC RSFC with more total days of practice compared to HEP between T2 and T1
for the left DLPFC and (B) T3 and T1 for the right DLPFC. Envelopes represent 1 standard error above and below the point estimates of the means, and raw data points

are overlaid.

The group differences in RSFC were localized to MFG, which
is a more canonical region of the DLPFC (and of the FPN; Petrides
and Pandya, 1999; Kim et al., 2012; Ptak, 2012) that is posterior
and dorsal to the regions reported by Creswell et al. (2016). In
contrast, we failed to replicate prior findings using an ROI based
on the exact coordinates provided by this prior study. There is a
growing body of evidence suggesting the anatomically-defined
DLPFC region should be involved in attentional processes that
shift with mindfulness training (Fox et al., 2016), whereas the
LPFC ROI is based on coordinates from a single study and is
likely less reliable. Although there were no significant group
differences in PCC–DLPFC RSFC in the voxelwise analyses, we
report the subthreshold results given that the pattern is con-
sistent with the significant group difference in the anatomical
DLPFC ROI analysis, and to provide a complete picture of the
data. However, subthreshold results alone are not evidence of a
group difference, given the possibility of false positives. The sig-
nificant increase in PCC–DLPFC RSFC within MBSR participants
in the voxelwise analyses adds further evidence to this pattern
of results implicating MBSR practice with improved connectivity
between the DMN and FPN.

There was an unanticipated, significant group difference
in the voxelwise analysis, whereby MBSR participants had
increased PCC–ITG RSFC relative to HEP. While there was no
difference between MBSR and WL in PCC–ITG RSFC, this result
appears to be driven by the significant increase for the MBSR
group, as there was no change for HEP (or WL). The ITG has
been considered part of the FPN (Kim et al., 2012), and reduced
ITG RSFC has been associated with aging-related cognitive
impairment (Han et al., 2011; Agosta et al., 2012). Increased PCC–
ITG RSFC may therefore reflect improved cognitive function.
However, future research is needed to replicate this finding in a
confirmatory analysis.

Importantly, we also found a group difference in the relation-
ship between practice and change in PCC–DLPFC RSFC, whereby
it was stronger for MBSR relative to HEP. The more time partici-
pants spent practicing MBSR, the stronger their PCC–left DLPFC
RSFC became—representing a linear dosage effect at this early
stage of training. There was no significant relationship for HEP
practice and PCC–DLPFC RSFC. Since participants in the MBSR

Fig. 5. MBSR-related increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC and attention. The more par-
ticipants’ PCC–left DLPFC RSFC increased (time 2–time 1) following MBSR, the
more their self-reported attention also increased (red-yellow; P < 0.05 controlling
for FWE using threshold-free cluster enhancement with FSL’s randomize). The

Discussion

In this study we found evidence that MBSR—one of the most
widely used mindfulness meditation interventions—increased
RSFC between nodes of the DMN and the FPN compared to well-
matched active and passive control groups. Previous research
has found similar effects following a brief mindfulness inter-
vention relative to relaxation training (Creswell et al., 2016), as
well as in cross-sectional research of long-term practitioners
(Brewer et al., 2011). A large and growing body of research has
implicated the DMN in mind-wandering, task-unrelated thought
and self-referential processing, whereas the FPN is associated
with externally-oriented and goal-directed attention (Spreng
and Grady, 2009; Barrett and Satpute, 2013; Spreng et al., 2013).
Given that one of the primary skills trained during mindfulness
meditation is directing attention to present moment experi-
ence without elaboration (unlike during typical self-referential
processing), increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC could reflect a greater
ability to attend to task-related stimuli and increased control
over self-referential processing and mind-wandering.

group did not all engage to the same degree with practicing
mindfulness meditation, the intervention should not lead to an
equivalent change across MBSR participants as a group. This
interaction of an individual differences measure with group is
strong evidence that MBSR practice played a causal role in the
RSFC changes, particularly given the significant main effect of
group on change in PCC–DLPFC RSFC.

While the group difference in changes in brain connectivity
was not sustained at the later follow-up, continued practice with
MBSR may be necessary to maintain this effect. Our finding
that days of MBSR practice between T1 and T3 were positively
associated with increasing strength of RSFC of this network over
the same time period adds support to this hypothesis. Future
research should seek to replicate this effect since it was not pre-
registered in this study, and to examine whether individuals who
continue to practice mindfulness meditation following MBSR
and incorporate the practices into their daily lives experience
more lasting change. For example, future studies may extend
this line of research by following participants further out in
time and examining whether participants engage in mindful-
ness practices when dealing with stressors vs solely as a sitting
practice.

Increased PCC–DLPFC RSFC following MBSR training was
associated with increased white matter microstructure of a
tract linking these regions, the SLF, in an exploratory analysis.
Decreased diffusivity and increased fractional anisotropy in
white matter may reflect a more streamlined white matter
fiber organization (Beaulieu, 2002; Alexander et al., 2007; Zatorre
et al., 2012). However, changes in DTI-based measures are non-
specific and may stem from various alterations to the underlying
microstructure (Jones and Cercignani, 2010; Jones et al., 2013).
Thus, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying such
changes still require future investigation. While the white matter
microstructure of the entire group of MBSR participants’ SLF
did not change significantly following the intervention, our
findings highlight the importance of examining individual
differences, since it was only for those who showed more
substantial changes in functional connectivity that we observed
alterations in white matter structural connectivity. Future
research should examine relationships between structural
and functional connectivity in this network in a confirmatory
manner to replicate these findings.

While we also found an association between increased
PCC–DLPFC RSFC and self-reported attention, as theorized, the
relationship was only present in an exploratory analysis with a
different measure than hypothesized in our pre-registration. The
questionnaire measure utilized in the current study (ESQ) is also
new, and the nomological network associated with individual
differences on this measure remains to be determined. It will
be important for future research to conceptually replicate
this result with a validated ESQ or other validated self-
report measure. Moreover, there was no relationship between
changes in PCC–DLPFC RSFC and mind-wandering as measured
by experience sampling following MBSR, contrary to our
hypothesis. It is possible that the experience sampling measure
in the current study assays a different aspect of attention than
that which is supported by PCC–DLPFC connectivity, and/or
that this measure is insufficient for measuring MBSR training-
related changes. It is critical to identify behavioral measures
associated with MBSR-related increases in PCC–DLPFC RSFC in
order to more fully understand the relevance of such changes
in brain connectivity. The ideal test would identify behavioral
improvements following MBSR that are mediated by increased
PCC–DLPFC RSFC.

Limitations

In the current study we found a mixture of positive and negative
results, across confirmatory and exploratory analyses. Strong
conclusions regarding the effect of MBSR training on PCC–DLPFC
RSFC are limited, given that group differences in the voxel-
wise analysis were non-significant and the P-values of the ROI
analyses change from 0.04 to 0.05 in two cases when correct-
ing for multiple comparisons. While our pre-registered anal-
ysis of the a priori anatomical ROIs provide support for the
conclusion that MBSR strengthens PCC–DLPFC RSFC, further
research is needed to replicate these effects. Replication of the
results of multiple exploratory analyses is also needed, includ-
ing relationships with practice, structural change of the SLF
and increased self-reported attention. Moreover, the question-
naire measure we utilized (ESQ) remains to be validated. Finally,
results of the whole-brain analysis revealed an unanticipated
difference in PCC–ITG RSFC between MBSR and HEP that was
non-significant for MBSR compared to WL. Since this group dif-
ference in PCC–ITG RSFC was the result of secondary, exploratory
analyses, we are hesitant to over-interpret this novel result,
which needs to be replicated in future confirmatory research.
We offered a tentative interpretation that such RSFC changes
may reflect improved cognitive function as an idea for further
exploration.

This study provides evidence of training-related changes
following practice with mindfulness meditation in brain
networks important for executive control and modulation
of mind-wandering with relevant outcomes in self-reported
attention. Individual differences in practice time and structural
changes associated with PCC–DLPFC RSFC changes suggest
the importance of continued practice beyond the formal
instruction period. Future research to examine potential longer-
term changes may need to consider factors that contribute to
adopting mindfulness meditation practice as a lifestyle change,
similar to the need for continued exercise and healthy eating for
maintenance of healthy weight. Potential avenues to facilitate
long-term use of mindfulness meditation practice may be
through tailoring practices for incorporation into activities of
daily living, availability of ongoing training exercises, greater
accessibility of training support through mobile platforms and
a meditation community. Given the wide use and efficacy of
MBSR for treating numerous mental health conditions (Goldberg
et al., 2018), as well as the growing evidence of behaviorally-
relevant biological changes as described in this study, the future
of mindfulness meditation research should aim to determine
factors that predict lasting change.
