Abstract: The aim of this study was to review the health information of dental fear-, dental anxiety-,
and dental phobia-related videos on YouTube. The 100 most widely viewed videos for the keywords
“dental fear”, “dental anxiety”, and “dental phobia” were chosen for evaluation. Out of the 300 videos,
145 videos met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. It was found that most of them were
produced by the professions, with a dentist delivering the key messages or with patients giving
testimonials. Many etiological factors and symptoms were described. Many pharmacological and non-
pharmacological interventions were recommended to the audience, such as sedation and distraction,
respectively. However, there was a lack of information on the deﬁnition or diagnostic criteria of dental
fear, dental anxiety, and dental phobia. Videos with high views had a higher ratio of misleading
information. Videos with a dentist being the informant had a similar ratio of misleading information
compared to other videos. Without adequate information on how to diagnose, it would be very
difﬁcult for the audience to determine if the video content was relevant or useful. The dental
profession can work together with psychologists or psychiatrists to produce authoritative videos
with accurate content.

1. Introduction

Dental fear and dental anxiety are two terms frequently used interchangeably, com-
monly under an umbrella term of dental fear and anxiety [1]. It is a common phenomenon
and frequently investigated in academia [2,3]. Recent meta-analyses calculated that its
global prevalence rate was as high as 15.3% among adults [4] and 25.8–36.5% among
preschoolers and schoolchildren [3]. People with higher levels of dental fear and anxiety
were found to have lower self-esteem and lower morale [5]. Moreover, higher levels of
dental fear and anxiety were associated with an increased number of decayed teeth [6],
more severe dental pain, and hence a lower oral-health related quality-of-life [7,8]. There-
fore, it is of paramount importance to gauge and manage the dental fear and anxiety of
affected patients, so that they can beneﬁt from more relaxed dental visits and smooth dental
treatments. There are many psychometric scales available in the academic literature to
measure the level of dental fear and anxiety of patients [9], with Corah’s Dental Anxiety
Scale (DAS), Kleinknecht’s Dental Fear Survey (DFS), and Dental Anxiety Inventory Short
Version (DAI-S) being some of the notable examples. Moreover, many management tech-
niques for dental fear and anxiety have been proposed, ranging from non-pharmacological
(e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, distraction) to pharmacological [10,11]. Furthermore, a
recent meta-analysis showed that signiﬁcant anxiety reductions using non-pharmacological
interventions could be demonstrated through psychometric assessment [12]. Such ﬁndings
implied that dental fear and anxiety is a manageable condition once the patient is able to
ﬁnd appropriate help.

Meanwhile, dental phobia can be considered a more severe condition, as some re-
searchers have suggested that one way to differentiate between dental anxiety and dental
phobia is to consider their impact on normal functioning; that is, if they affects the patient’s
occupation or social activities [1]. As such, dental phobia was considered to be different
from dental fear and anxiety as it could lead to the avoidance of dental treatment, even
when it was necessary [13]. A survey of nearly 2000 adult respondents reported a dental
phobia prevalence of 3.7%, a very small number compared to the dental fear prevalence
of 24.3% [14]. Dental phobia is not clearly deﬁned in the ﬁeld of psychology, with some
researchers suggesting that it could be an example of a condition called speciﬁc phobia, as
listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
and International Classiﬁcation of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) [1]. There have also
been discussions regarding which subtype of phobia dental phobia should be placed under,
with some researchers supporting the blood–injection–injury subtype [15], but with some
rejecting this notion and suggesting that it should be an independent subtype by itself [16].
A recent guideline in Germany [17] recommended that a patient should be suspected of
having dental phobia and should consult a psychologist or psychiatrist if high levels of
dental fear and anxiety are associated with over 2 years of dental avoidance, because these
patients may have other psychologic disorders (comorbidity) that are not manageable by
dentists alone. Though frequently investigated in dentistry, dental fear, dental anxiety, and
dental phobia are not currently explicitly listed in ICD-11 or DSM-5.

Negative health beliefs were reported to directly relate to the increase of dental fear
and anxiety [18]. At present, many patients consult online patient education materials for
healthcare information, such as YouTube videos [19], with COVID-19 being a prominent
example [20]. In particular, dental patients search YouTube videos to seek information
regarding various treatment options, such as dental implants [21] and orthodontics [22]. It
is equally possible that dental patients who suffer from dental fear and anxiety, being too
afraid of seeking help from dentists, might search for YouTube videos to better understand
their dental fear, dental anxiety, or dental phobia, and to ﬁnd ways to manage it. Dental
fear, anxiety, and phobia have different etiologies, diagnostic criteria, and manifestations,
all of which may determine the relevance/correctness of the information received by the
patients. Unfortunately, no prior study has evaluated the content of the YouTube videos
dealing with this topic. It is largely unclear who uploaded these videos, what contents
are covered, what management methods are introduced, and whether they contain any
misleading information. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a qualitative
content analysis of YouTube videos on dental fear, dental anxiety, and dental phobia, so
that a general overview of the videos concerned could be obtained. The objectives of this
study were to reveal the video metrics (e.g., view count), source of the video (whether the
channel was by health professions), and aspects of the conditions covered (e.g., prevalence,
etiology, symptoms, triggering stimuli, management methods).

2. Materials and Methods

Ethical approval was not applicable to the current study.

2.1. Information Sources, Search Strategy, and Eligibility Criteria

A search of YouTube videos was conducted on 25 October 2022. The search string in
this study was adapted from a qualitative study of YouTube videos related to dental fear
and anxiety in children and adolescents conducted by Gao et al. (2013) [23]. Qualitative
analysis has often been used in dental research [24]. The terms dental fear, dental anxiety,
and dental phobia were searched on the YouTube home page. The ﬁrst 100 most widely
viewed videos that resulted from each search term were recorded and screened. Hence,
a total of 300 videos were correspondingly screened for eligibility. Videos with a title
or content covering information related to dental fear, dental anxiety, or dental phobia
were included. Exclusion criteria included irrelevant (e.g., cartoon, game, and role play
video with no information or unrelated to dental fear and anxiety; purely for entertain-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 750

3 of 17

ment; and purely music with/without narrative for meditation or hypnosis purposes) and
non-English videos.

2.2. Video Selection

The screening of eligible videos was conducted within 14 days, given that a large
number of videos are created and uploaded daily and the dynamic nature of social media
means it changes rapidly [25]. To achieve objectivity, the titles and content of YouTube
videos were reviewed by two independent investigators (NW and AY). Disagreements
were resolved by discussion and reaching consensus.

2.3. Data Extraction

Two investigators (NW and AY) independently and carefully watched each of the
selected videos and conducted a qualitative content analysis of them. One investigator was
a PhD student with a psychology background (NW) and one investigator was a dentist
experienced in evaluating YouTube videos related to dentistry (AY). The following param-
eters were extracted and coded for each of the analyzed videos: YouTube video metrics
(e.g., number of views, likes, comments, subscriber, duration of video, and uploaded date),
characteristics of video (e.g., informants, sources of video, and whether the video contain
commercial information), and video content (e.g., information about dental fear, dental
anxiety, dental phobia, as well as corresponding treatment or management). Thematic
content analysis was applied, and no data analysis software was used [23]. Data were coded
as either in vivo codes (words from the informants) or in vitro codes (words and concepts
from the authors’ discipline). Codes with similar content were subsequently grouped and
merged into analytical categories. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

2.4. Statistical Analysis

Pearson’s correlation tests were conducted to evaluate if there were correlations
between the view count, like count, comment count, video duration, and channel subscriber
count. Chi-squared tests were conducted to evaluate if the proportion of videos with
misinformation was signiﬁcantly different between video groups, in terms of the video
source (lay public, professions versus others), informant identity (health professions versus
non-health professions), and view count (high view versus low view, binarized by median
split). Statistical tests were conducted using SPSS 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Results
were considered as statistically signiﬁcant if p < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Video Metric

A total of 1626 videos were identiﬁed from the searches. Of the 300 videos screened,
181 videos were recorded and screened for eligibility after removal of duplicates. Videos
with irrelevant content (i.e., no information about dental fear, dental anxiety, or dental
phobia) or not in English were excluded. A total of 145 videos were included in the ﬁnal
analysis. A ﬂowchart of the video selection and screening process is shown in Figure 1.
Agreement between two reviewers was reached in the phase of assessing eligibility, with
Kappa coefﬁcient levels of agreement of 94.7%.

The frequency count of 145 videos uploaded on YouTube is shown in Figure 2. The
oldest video was uploaded in March 2007, while the most recent was uploaded in September
2022. Over 70% (n = 100) of the videos had been uploaded in the past 5 years (2017–2022).

3.2. Sources of Video

Among the included videos, most were created by health professions (n = 100; 69%)
such as a dentist, dental hygienist, psychologist, etc. The second most common video
source was from the lay public (n = 21; 15%). The rest were generated from television
programs (n = 17; 12%), network news channels (n = 5; 3%), and the education sector (n = 2;
1%) (Figure 3).

Figure 4a shows the percentage of informants in different categories. More than half of
the informants were health professionals (n = 100; 51%), followed by patients (n = 42; 22%),
and inﬂuencer/key opinion leaders (n = 19; 10%). News reporters (n = 9; 5%) and channel
narrator (n = 9; 5%) together accounted for 10%. Very few informants (n = 7; 4%) were
researchers or television hosts. Among those health professions who provided information
in the videos, more than three-quarters were dentists (n = 90; 84%). Few of the health
professions informers were dental hygienist (n = 5; 4%), anesthesiologist (n = 3; 3%), dental
surgery assistant/dental nurse (n = 2; 2%), and psychologist (n = 2; 2%). The rest (n = 5;
5%) included hypnotherapists, physical therapists, psychotherapists, and therapists with
an unclear context (Figure 4b).

3.3. Video Content Related to Dental Fear, Dental Anxiety, and Dental Phobia

Overall, 24 out of 145 videos (16.6%) mentioned dental fear, 38 videos (26.2%) men-
tioned dental anxiety, and 17 videos (11.7%) mentioned dental phobia. Around one quarter
of videos (n = 35; 24.1%) mentioned more than one term, and only 15 videos (10.3%) men-
tioned all three (Figure 5). The content of 16 videos (11%) did not use these terms but used
more generic phrases such as “fear of (going to) the dentist”. Among those 50 videos that
discussed two or more topics, only three videos described and compared the differences
between dental fear, dental anxiety, and dental phobia.

Table 4 summarizes the etiology of dental fear, dental anxiety, and dental phobia
mentioned in the videos. The causes mentioned in the videos can be categorized into
“cognitive factors” and “behavioral factors”. Cognitively, most patients perceived them-
selves as having no control over the treatment process. Furthermore, patient fears were
caused by conditioning. Most patients were behaviorally conditioned by their own un-
pleasant experiences, by observing and modeling others’ bad experiences, and by hearing
others’ experiences.

are summarized in Table 5. Generally, the symptoms mentioned in the videos could be cate-
gorized into “physiological responses”, “behavioral responses”, and “cognitive responses”.
Most patients appeared to have a ﬁght-or-ﬂight response, an automatic physiologic reaction
to stressful situations, such as increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating. Some
patients even had dizziness, stomachache, and vomited when they were going to have or
experienced a dental treatment. Furthermore, most patients with dental fear and anxiety
were unable to sleep well at night or had nightmares. Some of them had difﬁculty or
hesitation in making dental appointment. Meanwhile, avoidance behavior was shown in
patients with dental phobia. Patients with dental phobia would search for alternatives to
tackle their dental problems, so as to reduce the need to have a dental visit. They avoided
going to a dental clinic until they could not handle oral problems themselves or when they
could no longer bear the pain caused by bad oral health. Lastly, patients in the videos
claimed that they had irrational thoughts on dental visits. Examples of patients’ narratives
are shown in Table 5.

3.4. Video Content Related to Management of Dental Fear, Dental Anxiety, and Dental Phobia

Of the 145 videos, only 100 videos (69%) recommended a treatment or suggested
interventions to manage dental fear, anxiety, or dental phobia. Among those 100 videos with
treatments suggested, 30% mentioned pharmacological methods, while 32% talked about
non-pharmacological methods (Figure 6). Meanwhile, 38% discussed both pharmacological
and non-pharmacological interventions.

Figure 6. Type of management mentioned in the videos.

Regarding pharmacological methods, oral medication and intravenous sedation were
most commonly mentioned in the videos (18.6%) (Table 7). Some unclarity was found,
as supplements with an unclear content were mentioned in two videos (1.4%), and 12
videos (8.3%) mentioned sedation without specifying which type(s). Regarding the non-
pharmacological methods, distraction was the most frequently covered speciﬁc concept
(n = 51, 35.2%), which included various methods utilizing audio and visual stimuli (Table 8).
Some methods generally used in dental ofﬁces were also frequently mentioned, such as
signaling and tell-show-do.

4. Discussion

This study on YouTube videos about dental fear, dental anxiety, and dental phobia
found that the majority had been viewed 1000–100,000 times, implying that they could
potentially reach a broad audience on the Internet. Most of them were produced by the pro-
fessions, with the health professions delivering narratives or patients giving testimonials.
One prominent issue identiﬁed was the lack of deﬁnition of dental fear, dental anxiety,
and dental phobia, or an explanation of their diagnostic criteria. In healthcare, an accurate
diagnosis is crucial for proper patient care and management. For example, it is useless to
prescribe antibiotics if a patient has a viral infection. Similarly, if a patient complains of oral
pain, a dentist should conﬁrm the root cause of the pain before suggesting a treatment. If
the pain is due to dental caries, the treatment should be the removal of the decayed part of
the offending teeth. In this case, it is useless to advise the patient to try to use mouthrinse
more frequently to kill bacteria in the oral cavity. Unfortunately, the analyzed YouTube
videos in this study seldom provided a description of what dental fear, dental anxiety,
and dental phobia were, or provided diagnostic criteria. There are many psychometric
tools devised to assess the dental anxiety level of patients and they are heavily used in
academia for benchmarking populations or for diagnostic purposes in research studies,
such as the DAS and DFS. However, none of these were introduced in the analyzed videos.
In fact, only one video asked the audience four questions from an unclear source, and
claimed that the audience might have dental anxiety if their answered yes to at least two
questions. Without a proper deﬁnition or diagnostic tools on dental fear, anxiety, and
phobia, it might be very difﬁcult for the audience to determine if the information provided
by the videos was suitable or relevant. It should be noted that not all interventions are
suitable for different patients with different anxiety levels and etiology, not to mention that
some videos confused or did not differentiate between dental fear, anxiety, and phobia.
For instance, most videos proposed sedation (or so-called “sleep dentistry”) as one of the
options for patients with dental fear, dental anxiety, or dental phobia. However, sedation
cannot help patients to overcome fears and anxiety, as it only allows patients to be put into
sleep, so that the dentist can perform dental treatment in a “smoother” manner. Fear and
anxiety may still exist without any desensitization at all. Moreover, sometimes it is not
practical to put patients to sleep, as some dental procedures, such as one or two simple
restorations, can be completed within a relatively short time.

The authors initially intended to evaluate the quality of the videos using existing
scales/measurement tools for assessing online patient education materials, such as the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 750

14 of 17

DISCERN [29] and JAMA benchmark tools [30]. However, it has been argued that these
tools were designed to assess written information and websites but not videos (see Azer,
2020 [31]). For instance, DISCERN requires the assessor to evaluate whether the aims of
the assessed material are clearly stated or not. This is not perfectly suitable for assessing
YouTube videos, as they are not necessarily produced as educational materials with learning
aims and objectives listed at the beginning. In fact, there is a chance that a patient may
choose to skip the video if its opening explains its aims in a didactic manner, rendering
it boring. A recent systematic review pointed out that studies analyzing YouTube videos
for patient education shared common goals of discovering what health-related content the
videos contained and the content credibility, but without a standardized set of evaluation
method and tools [32]. Perhaps research experts should devise a standard evaluation tool
for assessing online videos in the future. Therefore, the authors opted to evaluate the
content of the YouTube videos based on items speciﬁcally related to dental fear, anxiety,
and phobia.

To the authors’ surprise, it was found that the high view videos had a larger ra-
tio of misinformation. This was an alarming ﬁnding, as it implied that misinformation
could potentially spread across a broad audience. Here is some of the notable misleading
information identiﬁed from the analyzed videos:
• Misinformation: People with dental fear or anxiety being exposed to videos of dental
procedures would be beneﬁcial. Truth: Not everyone would have their dental fear or anxiety
alleviated after watching such videos. See [33]. Some might become more anxious.

• Misinformation: All psychological and non-pharmacological treatments were grouped
as “cognitive-behavioral interventions” (CBI). Truth: CBI is a psychological intervention.
• Misinformation: Dental fear and dental phobia are the same thing. Truth: They differ in

severity and phobia leads to avoidance behavior.

• Misinformation: “Speciﬁc dental phobia”. Truth: Such a term has yet to be established in

the literature.

• Misinformation: A video title said there were new drugs that could help dental anxiety.
Truth: The drug actually replaced injection (helped with anesthesia) without targeting anxiety.
• Misinformation: Dental phobia is actually a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual (DSM). Truth: Some people believed that dental phobia could be an example of speciﬁc
phobia listed in DSM, but dental phobia itself is not listed in DSM.

• Misinformation: Laughing gas is not sedation. Truth: Laughing gas (nitrous oxide) is

used for inhalation sedation.

It was unsatisfactory to see such misleading information contained in the videos.
Unlike dental treatment topics, the misleading information might not be rectiﬁed or clariﬁed
by the dentist when a patient went to the dental ofﬁce for a consultation. Here, patients
with dental fear, dental anxiety, or dental phobia might not be as communicative when they
go to see a dentist, or they might avoid going to the dentist at all. This implies that it would
be much more difﬁcult to correct the misleading information received. Indeed, there have
been cases where misleading health information online led to delays in seeking treatment or
to receiving harmful/deadly treatment [34]. How the mass media inﬂuences the audience
has been a recurring research theme for many decades, with multiple theories proposed.
For example, the “magic bullet theory” or “hypodermic effects theory” implies that the
audience would simply be persuaded and accept the messages received. On the other end,
there is the “active audience theory” that implies the audience becomes actively involved
in assimilating the messages into their personal and social contexts (for a comprehensive
account on the evolution and spectrum of mass media effect theories, please refer to [35]).
How dental patients perceive the messages conveyed in these YouTube videos on dental
fear, dental anxiety, and dental phobia is largely unknown and should be further examined
in future studies. However, it could be argued that patients with heightened dental fear
or anxiety may not remain calm and critically analyze the content of these videos, and
thus it is important to the include correct information in these videos. It is important for
the videos to provide accurate information, as not only dental patients but also dental

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 750

15 of 17

students may consult them as a learning tool. In fact, it was found that over 95% of dental
undergraduates [36] and postgraduates [37] would watch a relevant YouTube video before
attempting a clinical procedure.

Despite some notable misleading contents being found in some videos, there were still
some potential merits to the videos, as some of them mentioned that their recommenda-
tions were based on research ﬁndings. Unfortunately, they did not clearly mention their
source of information, so that we could not verify whether they had interpreted research
ﬁndings accurately.

5. Conclusions

This report analyzed 145 YouTube videos on dental fear, dental anxiety, and dental
phobia. It was found that most were produced by the professions, such as dental clinics
and hospitals, with health professions delivering the key messages or with patients giving
testimonials. Many etiological factors and symptoms were described. Many pharmacologi-
cal and non-pharmacological interventions were recommended to the audience, such as
sedation and distraction, respectively. However, there was a lack of information on the
deﬁnition or diagnostic criteria of dental fear, dental anxiety, and dental phobia. Misleading
information was found among the videos, and videos with high views had a higher ratio
of misleading information. Correct diagnosis leads to proper treatment/management.
Without adequate information on how to diagnose, it would be very difﬁcult for the au-
dience to determine if the video content was relevant or useful. Future videos should
cover diagnostic criteria, which implies that the dental and psychology ﬁelds should work
together to properly align the commonly used terms, namely dental fear, dental anxiety,
and dental phobia, in DSM-5 and ICD-11.
