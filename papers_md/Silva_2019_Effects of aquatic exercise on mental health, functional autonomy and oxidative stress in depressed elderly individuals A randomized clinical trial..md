OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of aquatic exercise on mental health, functional
autonomy and oxidative stress parameters in depressed elderly individuals.
METHODS: Initially, ninety-two elderly individuals were included in the study and were allocated into the
depression group (n=16) and nondepression group (n=14). Both groups engaged in the aquatic exercise
program for 12 weeks, including two weekly sessions (45 min/session) at a low intensity (between 50% and 60%
of maximal heart rate or Borg scale scores of 13 to 14) throughout the intervention. All outcomes were
evaluated at baseline and 12 weeks later.
RESULTS: The patients were 63.5±8.8 years old. The following scores were decreased after training in the
depressed group: depression (53%), anxiety (48%), and Timed Up & Go (33%). The following scores increased:
Berg Balance Scale (9%) and ﬂexibility (44%). Regarding the blood-based parameters, there were decreases in
protein carbonylation (46%) and nitric oxide (60%) and increases in glutathione (170%) and superoxide
dismutase (160%) in the depression group (po0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: The aquatic exercise program reduces depression and anxiety, improves functional autonomy
and decreases oxidative stress in depressed elderly individuals.

’ INTRODUCTION

Decreased physical activity can contribute significantly to
increased levels of depression (1). On the other hand, regular
physical exercise positively alters the symptoms of depression
thereby promoting mental health (2,3). In addition, physical
exercise facilitates and stimulates social interaction with posi-
tive consequences on quality of life (1,3). Feasible and effective
interventions that might provide benefits to both physical and
mental health are needed for these disorders to optimize
health outcomes in this vulnerable patient group (1,4).

Recently, research in this area has been focused on mental
health markers, which reflect common pathophysiological

processes, related to the loss of functional autonomy and
increased oxidative stress that are thought to be involved in
depression (5,6,7). Psychosocial stressors, a sedentary life-
style and low functional autonomy may alter cellular
functioning and have been proposed as worthwhile inter-
vention targets for the treatment or prevention of depression
(3,4,7).

Although studies have shown significant improvement in
the depressive symptoms of elderly individuals after the
regular practice of physical exercises (2,8), the relations
between mental health, functional autonomy and oxida-
tive stress remain obscure. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effects of aquatic exercise on mental health,
functional autonomy and oxidative stress parameters in
depressed elderly individuals.

Study design

This longitudinal clinical study, conducted for 12 weeks,
subjected both the depression group and the nondepression
group to the aquatic physical training program. Two days
before and 48h after the program, parameters related to
mental health, oxidative stress and physical fitness were
analyzed.

Group allocation

Initially, 56 patients were screened with a medical
diagnosis of major depression and confirmed by the medical
clinic psychiatrist at the local University, and 36 nonde-
pressed elderly individuals participated in the study. Of the
56 patients, 29 did not meet the inclusion criteria, and 7
declined to participate. Thus, 20 patients (9 men and 11
women) with depression, aged between 50 and 80 years old,
were included in the study and formed the depression
group. Of the 36 nondepressed individuals, 12 did not meet

the inclusion criteria, and 4 declined to participate. Thus, 20
(13 men and 7 women) elderly individuals without depres-
sion, aged between 50 and 80 years old, were included in the
study and formed the nondepression group. Both groups
were subjected to the same physical training program at the
same place, time and days of the week. (Figure 1: allocation).

Subjects

Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder
(MDD), according to established criteria (e.g., DSM5), and
healthy elderly individuals (according to WHO criteria) were
recruited through advertising in local newspapers. The
criteria for inclusion in the depression group included the
following: had MDD, were not engaged in regular exercise
(i.e., did not exercise more than 20 min on 3 or more days a
week), were 50 years old or over, and had a recent medical
release for exercise practice (in the 6 months preceding the
study). The exclusion criteria were current drug abuse,
psychotherapeutic treatment, contraindications to physical
exercise, suicidal behavior according to the Hamilton dep-
ression rating scale (10), and metabolic or endocrine disorders.
The participants were instructed to not change the medication
prescribed by a psychiatrist (Table 1) throughout the study.
The inclusion criteria for the healthy elderly group were as

follows: healthy elderly individuals who were without
pathology or physical limitations for exercise practice, were
50 years old or over, and had a recent medical release for
exercise practice (in the 6 months preceding the study). The
exclusion criteria were individuals who presented with
pathological problems (musculoskeletal, cardiometabolic or
endocrine)
limited or were contraindicated for the
practice of the programmed exercise. In addition, participants
from either group who did not complete more than 90% of the
stipulated physical activity program were excluded.

Intervention

Patients underwent a 12-week aquatic training program
with two weekly sessions, lasting 45 min. In both groups, the
intensity was similar. Heart rate (HR) was monitored every
10 sec (Polar, Kajaani, Finland), and the rate of perceived
exertion (Borg scale) was measured in the final 20 sec of each
stage. The aquatic training classes were always held in the
afternoon in a pool with a depth of 1.20 m, measuring
25 m (cid:1) 12.5 m, with water in the approximate temperature
range of 26 to 28oC.

Program exercise

Each 45-min session was divided into a warm-up period
(5 min) and the main training program (40 min), followed by a
cool-down period (5 min). Both groups underwent interval-
training programs with the following schedule: 9 exercises in
each session; each exercise was performed as 4 sets of 30 sec
with 10-sec intervals;
two weekly sessions (Tuesdays/
Thursdays). Exercise intensity was measured by a heart rate
monitor and maintained in a low-intensity range (50% and

The exercises involved the large muscle groups, with upper
and lower limbs together. Both groups had identical training
protocols (Table 2).

Clinical tests

These tests were conducted 48h before the first session and
48 h after the last training session in the patients for a clinical
evaluation and included assessments of mental health,
functional mobility, and oxidative stress. Before and after
the intervention, an alimentary assessment was performed
over 3 consecutive days.

Mental health

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (11) is a standardized
self-administered questionnaire designed by the Center for
Cognitive Therapy (CCT) researchers and is a widely used
measure for the self-assessment of depression, both in research
and in the clinical setting (12). The BDI is a participant-
administered questionnaire with 21 items. The total score
ranged from 0 to 63 points, and the items referred to sadness,
pessimism, feeling of failure, lack of satisfaction and feeling
guilty, among others. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (13)
presented 21 items related to anxious symptoms, and each
was composed of four affirmations that increased in degree of
intensity from 0 to 3. More than one affirmation could have
been chosen; however, the computed score always used the
affirmation of greater intensity.

Functional mobility

For the Timed Up & Go (TUG) test, individuals were
seated in a chair (45 cm high) with their back against the
chair. They were instructed to stand, walk 3 m following a
straight line on the ground as fast and safely as possible,
return to the chair, and sit in the starting position (14).
The Berg balance scale (BBS) had a maximum score of 56,
and each item had an ordinal scale of 5 alternatives ranging
from 0 to 4 points. The test is simple, easy to administer, and
safe for the evaluation of elderly patients. These tests require
only a stopwatch and a ruler as equipment, and its execution
takes approximately 15 min (15). The test used to assess the
flexibility of the hamstring muscles was the Sit and Reach
originally proposed by Wells and Dillon in 1952, following the
Canadian standardization of physical fitness assessment tests
(Canadian Standardized Test of Fitness; CSTF) (16).

Oxidative stress parameters

Protein oxidation was measured by the formation of
carbonylated protein derivatives using 2.4-dinitrophenylhy-
drazine read spectrophotometrically at 370 nm (17). Total
glutathione levels (GSH) were measured in a reaction

Depression scores

The results shown in Figure 2 reveal a significant decrease
in scores for depression after the aquatic exercise program in
the depression group (-13.2±3 points) when compared to
scores before the program (score of 28.5±3.8) (po0.01). The
control group did not show significantly altered results on
the depression scale after (4.2±1.1) compared to before
(5.2±1.9) the program (p40.05). Our results indicated that
clinically,
there was a 53% decrease in the scores for
depression in the depressed elderly individuals.

Anxiety scores

As shown in Figure 3, the results showed a significant
decrease in scores for anxiety after the aquatic exercise
program in the depression group (11.8±5) when compared
to before the program (22.9±4) (po0.05). The control group
did not show significantly altered results for anxiety after the
program (4.5±3) compared to before the program (4.7±1)
(p40.05). Our results indicated that clinically, there was a
48% decrease in the anxiety scores in the depressed elderly
individuals.

Timed Up & Go test (TUG)

The results in Table 3 show a significant decrease in time
for the Up & Go test after the aquatic exercise program in the
depression group (7.68±0.3 sec) compared to before the
program (11.5±0.7 sec) (po0.05). The nondepression group
did not have significantly altered results on the TUG test
after (7.4±0.3 sec) compared to before (7.1±0.4 sec) the
program (p40.05). In the Berg test, the results showed a
significant increase after the aquatic exercise program in the
depression group (55.5±0.2) compared to before the pro-
gram (50.8±1.3) (po0.05). The nondepression group did not
show altered results after (56±0.1) compared to before
(56±0.3) the program. In addition, the results demonstrated
a significant increase in the flexibility of the hamstring

between DTNB and thiols that reached a maximum in 5 min.
Absorbance was read at 412 nm after 10 min, and a standard
curve of GSH was used to calculate the GSH levels in each
sample (18). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was
estimated by adrenaline auto-oxidation inhibition, which
was read at 480 nm in a spectrophotometer (19). Nitric oxide
(NO) production was estimated spectrophotometrically based
on nitrite generation. Samples were incubated with Griess
reagent at room temperature for 10 min, and the absorbance
was read at 540 nm using a microplate reader (20).

Blood collection

Eight-milliliter samples of blood were obtained from the
antecubital vein. Blood was collected in vacutainers without
additives and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4oC.
Aliquots of red blood cells and serum were stored at -70oC
until used in the biochemical assays.

Statistical analyses

All analyses were performed by blinded evaluation. The
data are expressed as the means ± standard errors of the
mean (SEM). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to
confirm normality. The w2 test for nonparametric analyses
was also used and followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test.
The a priori sample size was calculated based on a predicted
difference of 0.5% in the levels of SOD=0.05 and power of
0.90, performed with IBM Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS) software (Armonk, New York; version 18),
that was based on the study of Silva et al. (21). This calcu-
lation indicated that 11 patients in each group would be
sufficient to detect significant changes in oxidative stress. The
level of significance established for the test was po0.05. SPSS
version 21.0 was used as the statistical software.

’ RESULTS

Treatment groups

The study participants were divided into two groups:
depression and nondepression. In the depression group, 56
patients were assessed for eligibility, 20 were allocated to the
group, and 16 were included in the exercise program and
analyses. The four individuals who were not included in this
analysis were 2 who dropped out of the study and two who
had inadequate adherence (o90%). In the nondepression
group, of the 36 patients assessed for eligibility, 20 were ran-
domized and 14 were included in the analyses and exercise
program. The six individuals who were not included in this
analysis included 2 who dropped out of the study and four
who had inadequate adherence (o90%). To perform an
intention-to-treat analysis, all participants were invited to
undertake before and posttraining evaluations. The distribu-
tion of individuals can be observed in Figure 1.

Baseline characterization of participants

Age, duration of depression, body mass, BMI, sex, and

Oxidative stress parameters

As observed in Table 4, the results showed a significant
decrease in oxidative damage indicated by protein carbony-
lation after the aquatic exercise program in the depression
group (0.16±0.04 nmol/mg protein) compared to before the
program (0.3±0.07 nmol/mg protein) (po0.01). The non-
depression group did not show significantly altered oxida-
tive damage after (0.13±0.02 nmol/mg protein) compared to
before (0.14±0.03 nmol/mg protein) the program (p40.05).
Regarding nitric oxide, the results showed a significant
decrease in its production after the aquatic exercise program
in the depression group (11.7±3.5 nmol/mg protein) com-
pared to before the program (28.2 ±2.5 nmol/mg protein)
(po0.001). The nondepression group had significantly
increased levels of this marker after (12.8±2.5 nmol/mg
protein) compared to before (5.56±2.8 nmol/mg protein) the
program (po0.05). Regarding superoxide dismutase, the
results showed significantly increased SOD after the aquatic
exercise program in the depression group (1.3±0.3 nmol/mg
protein) compared to before the program (0.5±0.01 nmol/
mg protein) (po0.05). The nondepression group did not
show altered SOD after (1.44±0.3 nmol/mg protein) com-
pared to before (1.3±0.2 nmol/mg protein) the program
(p40.05). In addition, glutathione significantly increased
after the aquatic exercise program in the depression group
(4.17±0.8 nmol/mg protein) compared to before the pro-
gram (1.54±0.07 nmol/mg protein) (po0.01). The nonde-
pression group did not show altered GSH results after
(2.88±0.03 nmol/mg protein) compared to before (2.97±0.08
nmol/mg protein) the program (p40.05). Our results in the
there was a
depressed group indicated that clinically,
reduction of 46% in protein carbonylation and 60% in nitric
oxide, and there was an increase of 170% in GSH and 160% in
SOD.

Dietetic parameters

Food intake, macronutrient distribution (carbohydrates,
lipids and proteins) and daily calorie intake were not altered
by the 12-week training period (data not shown).

’ DISCUSSION

The present study demonstrates that a low-intensity
aerobic training program in the aquatic environment can
contribute to the treatment of depression by reducing anxiety
and depression scores, improving functional autonomy and
decreasing oxidative stress.

Aquatic exercise and depression
da Silva LA et al.

CLINICS 2019;74:e322

The reduction in the depression scores found in the present
study demonstrated the efficacy of aquatic training on
depression in elderly individuals and corroborates previous
meta-analyses (7). Dunn et al.
(22) randomized adults
diagnosed with depression to 12 weeks of one of five aerobic
exercise-training treatment conditions and demonstrated that
three to five times per week presented similar results regard-
ing the decrease in depression scores. Our results showed
that the frequency of two times a week was sufficient to
reduce depression. We believe that the intermittent char-
acteristic of the exercise, unlike the traditional ‘‘continuous
aerobic’’ method reported by previous studies (23,24), is the
crucial factor in explaining these results. Several theories
have been advanced to explain the antidepressant effects of
exercise, including hormonal changes (e.g., increased beta-
endorphins, serotonergic adaptations and hormone levels)
(1,23) and oxidative stress (oxidative damage and antiox-
idant defense system) (25), as well as changes in cortical
activity and structure (26).

In the current study, anxiety levels were reduced among
the depression group; these findings were consistent with
previous studies (12,27). Regular physical exercise decreased
symptoms of anxiety (27). The related release of b-endorphin
and dopamine induced by exercise provides a tranquilizing
effect in regular practitioners (5,28). Our study demonstrated
that low-intensity (Table 2) exercise was sufficient to reduce
anxiety. Clinical trials have indicated that physical exercise
can have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects (3). Studies
involving low-intensity aquatic exercises have presented
significant results for the reduction in anxiety, corroborating
the present findings (28,27). Several studies have shown that
during physical exercise, there is release of b-endorphin and
the neurotransmitter dopamine, providing a tranquilizing
and analgesic effect, thereby reducing the symptoms of
anxiety (28,29).

The anatomical and physiological changes observed in the
elderly population have been associated with increased dis-
ability, frailty and falls (8,30). Regarding functional auton-
omy, we evaluated parameters of dynamic balance (TUG),
static equilibrium (Berg) and flexibility levels (Table 3). Our
results point to improvements in depressed elderly people
after the aquatic exercise program. Aidar et al. (8) observed
similar results in which functional autonomy can be imp-
roved by 12-week aquatic physical activities. Ochoa Marti-
nez et al. (30) demonstrated that an aquatic exercise program
for 12 weeks improved the functional autonomy of older
women. It is possible that the muscular resistance caused by
the water 10 times higher than that of the air during the
exercises required more work of the motor cortex in the
elderly individuals. This improved the synchronization of
the motor units and increased the excitability of the motor
neurons, which reflected an increase in muscular strength
and consequently the functional autonomy of the elderly
individuals (31).

Depression may be accompanied by increased oxidative
stress and a decreased antioxidant system (2,7). Previous
studies (1,27,31) showed that oxidative damage levels were
increased in persons with depression and/or depressive
symptoms. Our results showed reduced oxidative damage
mediated by protein carbonylation after training in the
depression group (Table 4). Ji (32) suggested that the decrease
in ROS production induced by physical
training could
increase the level of antioxidant repair of the carbonylation
process. The results of this study are in accordance with the

the idea that aerobic exercise can promote beneficial effects on

study suggested the involvement of NO
mechanisms in the pathogenesis of depression (34). Aggar-
wal et al. (34) showed that reducing NO can help improve
neurobehavior related to depression-like effects in mice. Our
results demonstrated decreased levels of NO after physical
training in the depression group (Table 4). In humans, the
regular practice of aerobic exercises increased endothelial-
derived relaxation stimulated by acetylcholine by augment-
ing the release of NO (35).

There is also evidence to suggest that antioxidant enzymes
are decreased in people with depressive symptoms (36,37).
Previous studies have suggested that abnormal metabolism
of SOD/GSH is closely related to various pathologies (36,37).
Our results demonstrated that SOD/GSH levels were lower
in the depression group and that physical training increased
their activity. Several studies have reported that physical
training increased SOD activity and GSH levels (32,33,38).
For example, Pinho et al. (38) demonstrated in experimental
models that physical training increases SOD activity in the
heart. Brocardo et al. (3) showed that physical exercise
increased glutathione levels in men and women. Somani
et al. (39) showed that the exercise-induced increases in SOD
activity and GSH content were higher than the increases in
the mRNA levels of the respective antioxidants. The decrease
in oxidative damage observed in the current study can be
explained by the increase in antioxidants (SOD/GSH) in the
depressed group.

On the other hand, there is some evidence to suggest that
antidepressants have antioxidant properties and may act by
reducing ROS production and improving antioxidant levels,
thereby reducing oxidative stress (40,41). In our study, dep-
ressed individuals took medications throughout the exercise
intervention. This is a limitation that occurs frequently for
ethical reasons in studies involving humans. We believe that
the use of the drugs associated with the exercise helped the
treatment by improving the results of this study. Considering
the reductions in anxiety and depression levels in our sub-
jects and notable improvements in functional physical
capacity and oxidative stress biomarkers after the exercise
intervention, it is tempting, if not plausible, to speculate
about the involvement of functional autonomy and oxidative
mechanisms in obtaining beneficial responses. In conclusion,
we demonstrated that an intermittent aquatic physical
exercise program reduced anxiety, depression, and oxidative
stress and improves the functional capacity of depressed
elderly individuals.
