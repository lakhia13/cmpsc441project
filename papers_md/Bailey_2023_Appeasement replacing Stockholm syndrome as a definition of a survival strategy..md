ABSTRACT
Background: Stockholm syndrome or traumatic bonding (Painter & Dutton, Patterns of
emotional bonding in battered women: Traumatic bonding. International Journal of Women’s
Studies, 8(4), 363–375, 1985) has been used in mainstream culture, legal, and some clinical
settings to describe a hypothetical phenomenon of trauma survivors developing powerful
emotional attachments to their abuser. It has frequently been used to explain the reported
‘positive bond’ between some kidnap victims and their captor’s, although scarce empirical
research has supported this assertion.
It has been used in various situations where
interpersonal violence and mind control are reported and where clear power diﬀerentials
intimate partner violence, human traﬃcking, and
exist, such as in child sexual abuse,
hostage situation scenarios.
Objective: We propose replacing Stockholm syndrome with ‘appeasement,’ a term that can be
explained through a biopsychological model (i.e. Polyvagal Theory) to describe how survivors
may appear emotionally connected with their perpetrators to eﬀectively adapt to life-
threatening situations by calming the perpetrator.
Conclusion: We believe the term appeasement will demystify the reported survivor
experiences and will, in the eyes of the public, victims, and survivors, provide a science-
based explanation for
to be
contradictory. By understanding the potent reﬂexive neurobiological survival mechanisms
embedded in appeasement, individuals and families can operationalise their survival from a
perspective that supports resilience, a healthy long-term recovery, and normalises their
coping responses as survival techniques.

Apaciguamiento: Reemplazar el síndrome de Estocolmo como deﬁnición
de una estrategia de sobrevivencia

Antecedentes: El síndrome de Estocolmo o vínculo traumático ha sido utilizado en la cultura
dominante, en algunos contextos legales y clínicos para describir un fenómeno hipotético de
sobrevivientes de trauma que desarrollan fuertes vínculos emocionales con su abusador. Se ha
utilizado frecuentemente para explicar el supuesto “vínculo positivo” entre algunas víctimas de
secuestro y sus captores, aunque escasa investigación empírica ha respaldado esta aﬁrmación.
Se ha utilizado en variadas situaciones en las que se informa de violencia interpersonal y
control mental y donde existen claras diferencia de poder, como abuso sexual
infantil,
violencia de pareja, tráﬁco de personas y situaciones de rehenes.
Objetivo: Proponemos reemplazar el síndrome de Estocolmo por “Apaciguamiento”, un
término que se puede explicar a través de un modelo biopsicológico (ej. Teoría Polivagal)
para describir cómo los sobrevivientes pueden aparecer emocionalmente conectados con
sus perpetradores para adaptarse efectivamente a las situaciones de amenaza vital
calmando al perpetrador.
término apaciguamiento desmitiﬁcará las experiencias
Conclusiones: Creemos que el
reportadas por los sobrevivientes y a los ojos del público, víctimas y sobrevivientes,
proveerá una explicación de base cientíﬁca para sus narrativas de sobrevivientes que
pueden inicialmente parecer contradictorias. Al comprender
los potentes mecanismos
reﬂexivos de supervivencia neurobiológica integrados en el apaciguamiento, los individuos y
familias pueden operacionalizar su sobrevivencia desde una perspectiva que respalde la
resiliencia,

1. Critique of Stockholm syndrome

Words can carry strong messages about intentionality,
motivation, and healing. Consider the recent aware-
ness around the use of victim versus survivor. Some
people choose to use the word victim when describing
life-threatening traumatic experiences, while others
prefer the word survivor, warrior, or victor. What is
important is that individuals who have experienced
these traumas have a voice in how they refer to them-
selves and that the words we use accurately reﬂect
their lived experiences.

One particularly problematic term for survivors of
kidnapping, as well as traﬃcking, interpersonal vio-
lence, and sexual abuse is ‘Stockholm syndrome’.
Stockholm syndrome was originally proposed when
trying to explain why some survivors of hostage-type
situations do not, to the outside observer, appear to
react to their situation with ﬁght or ﬂight, and further-
more seem to sympathise with their perpetrator as
supposedly evidenced by lack of cooperation with
police, and expression of understanding or lack of
expression of hostility toward their perpetrator. The
term has since been used in other traumatic situations
in which there are power imbalances such as kidnap-
ping, and abusive relationships. The word Stockholm
syndrome postulates a positive emotional relationship
between victims and abusers that developed because of
the trauma (Jülich, 2005). This term persists despite
several critiques.

First, Stockholm syndrome has been interpreted to
assume that there is a relationship between perpetrator
and victim that reﬂects mutual care and aﬀection
between them, but that mutuality does not exist in
cases of abduction, abuse, and perceived life threat
(Graham et al., 1988). Furthermore, Stockholm syn-
drome attempts to explain survival from captivity as
a formula derived from the perpetrator or observer’s
perspective (Namnyak et al., 2008). The variables
include: the perceived threat to survival; the belief
the threat will be carried out; the captive perceives
some small kindness from the captor; and the hostage
experiences the perceived inability to escape. Each of
these perspectives requires a level of conscious proces-
sing that contradicts what occurs physiologically
during a terror state. These conceptual diﬃculties

with Stockholm syndrome may explain why a review
of the professional literature on survival techniques
utilised during violent crimes (Jordan, 2013) demon-
strates a lack of validated criteria for Stockholm syn-
drome as a psychiatric diagnosis along with a limited
empirical research base (Geisler et al., 2013). The con-
cept’s origin in the media rather than research or clini-
cal practice and its application to various crimes, ages,
and interpersonal contexts raise questions about its
meaning, validity, and continued relevance to theory
building and research (Namnyak et al., 2008).

Although past theorists have suggested that the
concept of Stockholm syndrome may help normalise
survivors’ behaviour (Graham et al., 1988), it can be
argued that the term does not reﬂect survivor experi-
ence, a critique not yet reported in the professional lit-
erature. A more accurate term would be ‘appeasement’
because the word and overall description of appease-
ment emphasise the asymmetry in the relationship
and the adaptive strategy to regulate and calm the cap-
tor, thus minimising potential injury and abuse to the
victim (Treisman, 2004).

Using the Polyvagal Theory’s (Porges, 2011) asser-
tion of the fundamental drive to internalise a sense of
safety through sociality (Porges, 2022), we propose
the term appeasement may be operationally
that
deﬁned to more accurately describe a powerful
instinctual strategy to survive and thrive regardless
of the circumstances that can be separated from the
concept of mutual aﬀection and bonding with the per-
petrator. This perspective can be applied to a variety of
populations where the power diﬀerential and basic
survival needs perpetuate abuse and victimisation
the previous relationship with the
regardless of
perpetrator.

2. A brief history of appeasement as a
response to threat

Cantor and Price (2007) introduced the concept of
appeasement, proposing that it is a natural mamma-
lian response to entrapment or conﬁnement. They
suggested that appeasement could contribute to a bet-
ter understanding of PTSD, Stockholm syndrome, and
hostage dynamics. They proposed a step in articulat-
ing the normalisation of a shutdown process and

suggested implications for further understanding of
victim dynamics. From their perspective, appeasement
was a paciﬁcation and submission response. Since
appeasement may serve to de-escalate a situation, it
was suggested that the resulting paciﬁcation could
contribute to survival. Although we reject
the
deﬁnition of Stockholm syndrome, Cantor and Prices’
appeasement concept helps operationalise dynamics
present in circumstances where a victim perceives
and experiences threat to physical and psychological
survival, especially when there is social isolation.

However, the Cantor and Price formulation of
appeasement misses the two-way functional
inter-
action, with the beneﬁcial neurobiological impact of
co-regulation, between perpetrator and victim that is
better understood in deﬁning appeasement through
the Polyvagal Theory. The Polyvagal Theory (Porges,
2004, 2021, 2022) suggests that when faced with a
life threat the foundational survival circuits originat-
ing in the brainstem, which regulate bodily organs
via the autonomic nervous system, take over moving
the nervous system into a defensive state that sup-
plants intentional behaviour and social interactions.
This process is observed as a variation of the cascade
of ﬁght/ﬂight/freeze and potentially collapse and shut-
down. This defensive cascade is dependent on auto-
nomic states that functionally divert neural activity
from higher brain structure resulting in reducing pro-
blem-solving capacity, limiting cognitive processing,
and displacing intentionality and authentic forms of
sociality with defensive strategies. Basic survival
needs can determine and impact an individual’s
deﬁnition of life threat. For example, a parent facing
housing and food insecurity can experience a lack of
resources as a life threat. Social connection to the per-
petrator may be experienced as a type of lifeline.

Dissociation is a product of these foundational sur-
vival-oriented brainstem circuits and may serve as a
buﬀer to the realisation that one’s life is at risk.
From the polyvagal perspective, dissociation is viewed
as an unconscious process that serves as a protective
buﬀer when a threat is imminent. When an individual
dissociates, their higher level of thinking is disrupted
and the autonomic functions of the nervous system
take over to optimise the regulation of bodily systems
via the autonomic nervous system, even during life-
challenging situations. Heart rate is slowed, digestion
is interfered with, and awareness is impacted. Individ-
uals who have suﬀered a traumatic (life-threatening
experience) may internalise a feeling of extreme vul-
nerability and may have diﬃculty moving out of the
dissociative state (Cantor & Price, 2007). From a
pure survival stance, the slowing of heart rate, diges-
tion interference, and impaired reality perception
serves to save resources and protect from panic.
Although these strategies of conservation are evolutio-
narily eﬀective in asocial reptiles, they compromise

homeostatic functions and sociality for humans. It is
later, after the imminent threat has passed, that con-
tinued dissociation can become problematic, resulting
in an array of mental and physical health comorbid-
ities. By accepting the preeminent need to survive as
a biological imperative, then disassociation could be
studied as an adaptive survival-related physiological
buﬀer in response to overwhelming circumstances.
In extended periods of captivity or when under threat,
an individual may function in a disassociated state,
allowing for a tolerance of the intolerable.

3. A science of safety leads to an
understanding of the internal processes
supporting survival

The motivation to feel safe is a primary goal of the ner-
vous system (Porges, 2022). The Polyvagal Theory
(Porges, 2021) provides an innovative scientiﬁc per-
spective that includes the neurophysiological descrip-
tion of the neural circuit that down-regulates threat
reactions. This physiological adjustment occurred
during the evolutionary shift from asocial reptiles to
social mammals (Porges, 2021). From the perspective
of evolution, the shift in the autonomic nervous sys-
tem is at the core of our ability to connect socially
with others. When we apply and reﬁne the concept
of appeasement to the Polyvagal Theory’s assertion
of the fundamental drive to internalise a sense of
safety, we can more accurately describe the powerful
instinctual desire to survive and thrive, regardless of
the circumstances. In this context, the concept of
appeasement eliminates most suggestions of mutual
aﬀection and bonding when in survival mode. The
importance of feeling safe as an objective feeling has
been debated going back to the earliest psychologists,
such as Wundt (Ogden, 1907).

The ambiguous language used to describe emotions
and feelings adds to the challenge of operationalising a
‘felt sense of safety’ (Porges, 2022). Polyvagal Theory
suggests a deﬁnition of resilience in victims/survivors
that conceptualises a hierarchical explanation of feel-
ings as higher brain interpretations of the neural sig-
nals conveying information regarding visceral organs
(e.g. heart, gut, etc.) to the brainstem (Geisler et al.,
2013). This
bio-psycho-evolutionary perspective
emphasises the foundational function of the auto-
nomic state in the subjective experiences of global feel-
ings and speciﬁc emotions. Within this hierarchical
conceptualisation, feelings of safety are preeminent
and form the core of an enduring motivational system
that shifts autonomic state, which in turn drives beha-
viours, emotions, and thoughts.

When faced with a physical threat, the natural
response is to revert to a defensive stance, including
ﬁght/ﬂight or a complete shutdown of emotional
responses (Porges, 2022). Faced with a situation

4

where no escape is immediately possible, some survi-
vors may have the resource to express a type of
‘super social engagement’ that may enable them to
engage and eﬀectively co-regulate and calm their per-
petrator. We operationally deﬁne this capacity to co-
regulate and calm the perpetrator as appeasement.
The ability to access the appeasement process is con-
ceptualised as a type of ‘super social engagement’
that requires the neural capacity to manage a hybrid
state that enables access to the calming and social
cuing of the social engagement system (Porges, 2011,
2021, 2022), while simultaneously maintaining access
to the energetic mobilisation sympathetic system to
engage ﬁght/ﬂight behaviours if necessary (Porges,
2011). Firsthand accounts from survivors of abduction
underscore their awareness of the importance of estab-
lishing some type of social connection with the perpe-
trator. Repeated themes of awareness of the need for
the establishment of connection are brought into
therapeutic settings and are described by these survi-
vors. In the terms used within Polyvagal Theory, this
process of connection between the survivor and the
perpetrator is considered ‘co-regulation,’ a process
through which there is a mutually beneﬁcial bi-direc-
tional expression of cues of safety that functionally
calm the autonomic nervous system and observable
behaviour (Mohandie, 2002).

Not only does social engagement help calm the
autonomic nervous system, the withdrawal of this
social engagement can dysregulate the system. This
may necessitate a continued need for social engage-
ment in order for the survivor to stay safe. In a
study on co-regulation between mothers and infants,
the caregiver of young children provides cues to
calm infants. Speciﬁcally, prosodic tone was demon-
strated to help regulate a baby who is having behav-
the infants appeared
ioural distress. Furthermore,
distressed after social engagement was withdrawn
from their caregiver. This particular study not only
focused on the impact of prosodic tone on the infants’
it also presents the dis-regularity
internal stress,
impact of social withdrawal, suggesting the bio-direc-
tional impact between two autonomic nervous sys-
tems (Sarrate-Costa et al., 2022).

The ability to appease when in an activated state
requires suﬃcient regulation to appear to the perpe-
trator as being calm. This form of regulation is not
easily accessed or universally available but requires
innate abilities to resources to inhibit the sympathetic
arousal that would trigger the perpetrator’s defense.
Appearing calm and sending cues of engagement
when faced with a predator provides an opportunity
for co-regulation to occur. The visceral response to
threat is a foundational survival circuit located in the
brainstem and shared by several vertebrate species
that preceded the evolution of social mammals.
These circuits coordinate sympathetic arousal or

dorsal vagal shut down to support survival via defen-
sive behaviours. The ability to be in the proximity of a
life-threatening individual or event, without shutting
down, ﬂeeing, or ﬁghting, requires the ability to access
the social engagement system with its neurophysiolo-
gical dependence on the ventral vagal complex that
regulates primary structures (e.g. facial expression,
the intonation of voice) upon which social connection
and co-regulation are dependent (Porges, 2022). Acti-
vating the neural substrate to appease is a challenge to
the nervous system and is not an easily accessible
intentional behaviour. Rather, it requires a retuning
of the autonomic state that opportunistically main-
tains suﬃcient inhibition over the adaptive threat
reactions of
the sympathetic nervous system (i.e.
ﬁght/ﬂight) or the dorsal vagal system (i.e. shutdown,
collapse, fainting, defecation). By placing an auto-
nomic state at the core of feelings of safety or threat,
the pragmatic survival behaviours of ﬁght and ﬂight
and complex problem-solving strategies that would
lead to escape are consequential and dependent on
the facilitatory function of the autonomic nervous sys-
tem in optimising these strategies. Similarly, turning
oﬀ the threat reactions and calming the autonomic
state via the ventral vagal pathway will promote inter-
personal accessibility, while simultaneously support-
ing the co-regulation of the autonomic states of both
the survivor and the perpetrator. This model positions
the autonomic state as an intervening variable, med-
iating the interpretation of contextual cues and shap-
ing the reactions of both predator and captive.
Within this conceptualisation, depending on the indi-
vidual’s autonomic state, the same contextual cues and
challenges may result in diﬀerent behavioural, cogni-
tive, and physiological reactions. This would be true
both within and between individuals.

4. Appeasement is a powerful utility for
survival, adaptability, and resilience

There is a range of responses among individuals who
share the same traumatic environmental context.
Studies on hostages indicate that a calm, regulated
state may increase survival rates (Jaeger et al., 2014).
Furthermore, the adaptive utility of appeasement in
the experiences of survivors of abuse may functionally
neutralise defensive strategies in the victim as well as
the perpetrator via neural circuits communicating
cues of safety. Thus, if the perpetrator starts to feel
safe with the victim, then there is the possibility of
the perpetrator’s nervous system calming and receiv-
ing cues of safety emitted by the victim, resulting in
less violence, anger, and injury. This is not to be con-
fused with the notion of fawning. Fawning is the use of
people-pleasing to diﬀuse conﬂict and earn the
approval of others (The Association between a Psy-
chotherapist’s Theoretical Orientation and Perception

of Complex Trauma and Repressed Anger in the Fawn
Response – ProQuest, n.d.). It’s a maladaptive way of
creating safety in our connections with others by
essentially mirroring the imagined expectations and
desires of other people.

We propose that the victim is not using fawning tech-
niques, but is indeed inﬂuencing the perpetrator by an
internal process of co-regulation (Porges, 2004). Co-
regulation encourages regulation of both captor and
abductee. It is a feature that enables all mammals to
downregulate defensive strategies like yelling and
screaming and instead promotes sociality by enabling
psychological and physical proximity without the
consequences of injury, even in survival situations.
It is this calming mechanism that adaptively adjusts
to protect us when in ﬁght-or-ﬂight mode (Geisler
et al., 2013). This message has been confused by
some as Stockholm syndrome or as a type of aﬀection
instead of a powerful adaptive survival reaction. In
fact, fawning does not use the powerful biological
forces of co-regulation. Fawning involves less attune-
ment and is more one sided. In addition, from a poly-
vagal perspective, fawning may have the opposite
eﬀect of appeasement because it could be perceived
by the aggressor as a highly vulnerable state, inciting
more aggression (Reid et al., 2013).
Bonanno and colleagues’ research (Bonanno &
Burton, 2013) builds on the growing body of literature
that underscores the acceptance that the ﬂuid process
of the nervous system and self-regulation has become
an important variable for understanding the resiliency
(Bonanno, 2021; Chen & Bonanno, 2020; Jiang et al.,
2021). In summary, the ﬁrst step of self-regulation is
an assessment of what is required in the speciﬁc scen-
ario. The second step, according to Bonannos’ theory,
is the choice of what they describe as a regulatory
response. The question becomes, what can I do?
Lastly, the question becomes, is it working? The last
question requires a conscious assessment of the strat-
egy. It may be assumed that in a life-or-death situ-
ation, the question becomes, how likely am I to be
kept alive? This research supports the notion that
especially brain structures
the nervous
involved in regulating intentional behaviour, plays
an important role in survival. However, from a bio-
logical perspective, what is missing is the understand-
ing of the role that foundational brainstem survival
mechanisms play in response to imminent danger. It
is also unclear how one develops a resilient enough
autonomic state to be able to have an appeasement
response in the face of that threat.

system,

It is well documented that conscious thought is
impacted by the biological response to terror (Pyszc-
zynski et al., 1999). In times of life threat, the founda-
tional survival circuits in our nervous system take over
and interfere with executive functioning, suggesting
that logical thought and strategy development are
fully unconscious processes. All mammals operate
from the perspective of safety versus vulnerability. A

ﬂexible nervous system provides options for survival
and resilience, although these actions may be the result
of unconscious processes. Animal models have also
presented data to support that all mammals reach a
level of saturation in which the threshold is too high
for one nervous system to inﬂuence the other without
rest and deactivation (Chemtob et al., 1992). This is
important when understanding resilience because, in
many situations, the fate of the victim is, of course,
predicated by the pathology or motivation of the
perpetrator.

are
approaches, many supported by robust evidence-
based research (Han et al., 2021; MacFarlane &
Kaplan, 2012; Review of Narrative Therapy: Research
and Utility – Mary Etchison, David M. Kleist, 2000,
n.d.; Warshaw et al., 2013; Williamson et al., 2010).
The common variable across modalities is the adaptive
nervous system of the individual trying to make sense
of the horriﬁc past. The question initially is ‘why
didn’t you leave?’ but a more important question is ‘
how did you survive?’ The clinical focus should sup-
port the natural instinctual process that kept the indi-
vidual alive. Post recovery, the challenge becomes how
to help support the internalisation and the realisation
that there is no longer danger and life threat. There lies
the dilemma, victim/survivors of long-term and isola-
tive abuse seen in kidnapping and interpersonal vio-
lence are often led to believe there will always be
danger and life threat even when the perpetrator is
not present. Fear immobilises and compromises
higher level processing re-enforcing dependency.

The belief that one fell in love with the perpetrator
can be confusing and frightening to an individual who
has experienced captivity. The concern can lead to
fears of further vulnerability and may connote the
message that the individual is capable of being easily
fooled. Another factor is the message given to family
members that the individual
intentionally did not
escape out of a twisted allegiance to the perpetrator.
This message is also confusing and dysregulating to
family members and supporters, which can prevent
the family members from being actively supportive
of the survivor. Perception of support is important
to the healing and well-being of the whole family sys-
tem (Bailey et al., 2020). To begin to receive and give
this support, it is important for survivors and their
families to understand that kidnapping, traﬃcking
and intimate partner violence by deﬁnition occur in
contexts of diﬀerentials. Captivity in these circum-
stances can be easily confused with love as survival
needs shape dependency in the same way a small
child is forced to depend on the caregiver.

6

R. BAILEY ET AL.

Finally, shame has been identiﬁed as one of the key
factors underlying many trauma symptoms (López-
Castro et al., 2019; Saraiya & Lopez-Castro, 2016).
Ideas such as Stockholm syndrome can increase
shame. Providing survivors with the appeasement fra-
mework normalises and commends
the survival
mechanism given the rare capacity to engage the social
network when under threat. Appeasement can and
should be framed as an alternate explanation for
what may be a strong survival tactic, a tactic not solely
intentional, but dependent on the capacities of a resi-
lient autonomic state as a resource.

6. Purpose and hopeful outcome of this
article

In the ﬁeld of trauma research, recognising resiliency
as the norm has grown from being considered rare
to being viewed as a majority outcome (Bonanno,
2021). What is not so clear is what variables constitute
resilience. A large body of research has looked at per-
sonality variables, supportive resources, ﬁnancial and
educational assets, minimal searching for meaning
and experience, and expression of positive emotions
(Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno et al., 2015). Another
important variable cited is emotion regulation strat-
egies. Posing the question of how or what makes one
individual more able to handle adverse events more
positively than others? Research has not been able to
accurately assess the future coping ability of individ-
uals perceived to be resilient at the time of traumatic
stress.

As Bonnano’s research presents a picture of modest
outcomes for isolating and categorising individual
variables found in the resiliency literature (Bonanno,
2021), we postulate that operationalising a singular
explanation for survival and achieving resiliency can-
not be condensed down to a singular or multi-variable
recipe. Logically, a state preserving resources and
altering the reality of circumstances would be opti-
mum for preventing overwhelming anxiety and, in
some cases, what I refer to as voodoo death (Cannon,
1942; Lex, 1974).

The goal of our proposed model of appeasement is
to provide an alternative to the Stockholm syndrome
in understanding how a survivor may have navigated
and functionally adaptively negotiated with the perpe-
trator’s nervous system. Additionally, we propose the
introduction of a powerful unconscious survival
response. Appeasement is not guaranteed to survival,
but we propose appeasement
to be one possible
unconscious process when faced with a life threat in
the context of interpersonal violence. This life threat
is the key factor for appeasement to occur. The under-
standing that one person’s nervous system can uncon-
sciously impact another nervous system has been
identiﬁed in research looking at therapeutic presence

and variables contributing to eﬀective therapeutic
interventions
(Geller & Porges, 2014; Porges &
Dana, 2018). When this theory is applied to circum-
stances involving captivity and life threat, it provides
a plausible explanation of how we can understand
and honour the survivors who have had a regulated
nervous system that when confronted with life threats
enable them to express features of calmness, interest,
and social engagement. Thus, possibly diﬀusing or
altering the agitated state of the perpetrator. As a
caveat, the model is solely explanatory to honour the
capacity of the survivors who have had the resource
to access appeasement during life-threatening situ-
ations. The model does not infer that this capacity
can be learned or trained. Further research should
include the impact of operationalising this concept
in a manner that supports the healing and well-
being of survivors of a variety of crimes. An important
research question should be: ‘If survivors behaviour is
supported as a resiliency factor and labelled in terms
that underscore unconscious processes, will it impact
the recovery process in a positive manner if their
experience is conceptualised from their perspective
and not that of the preparator?’
