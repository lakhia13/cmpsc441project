The age of COVID-19 calls for a different approach toward global well-being and
ﬂourishing through the transcendence suffering as advocated by existential positive
psychology. In the present study, we primarily explained what self-transcendence is and
why it represents the most promising path for human beings to ﬂourish through the
transformation of suffering in a difﬁcult and uncertain world. After reviewing the literature
on self-transcendence experiences, we concluded that the model of self-transcendence
presented by Frankl
is able to integrate both of the characteristics associated with
self-transcendence. Afterward, we discussed how the self-transcendence paradigm
proposed by Wong, an extension of the model by Frankl, may help awaken our innate
capacity for connections with the true self, with others, and with God or something larger
than oneself. We presented self-transcendence as a less-traveled but more promising
route to achieve personal growth and mental health in troubled times. Finally, we
presented the history of the development and psychometrics of the Self-Transcendence
Measure-Brief (STM-B) and reported the empirical evidence that self-transcendence
served as a buffer against COVID-19 suffering. The presented data in the current study
suggested that the best way to overcome pandemic suffering and mental health crises
is to cultivate self-transcendence.

INTRODUCTION

The human costs of the pandemic in terms of mortality, morbidity, mental health conditions,
and direct economic losses are staggering (Cutler and Summers, 2020; Graham, 2020). Even with
three vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still warns of a 4th wave of
COVID-19 (Soucheray, 2021). The pandemic may persist for years, according to the Chief Public

Self-Transcendence Buffers COVID-19 Suffering

Health Oﬃcer of Canada (Aiello, 2020). The pandemic has
destroyed countless businesses and careers. It becomes more
challenging to rebuild an own career or start a new one.
Therefore, an individual needs to be equipped with the mental
toughness to excel in whatever one pursues. The positive illusion
of focusing only on the positive side of life will not carry one very
far in a world full of cut-throat competition and the human evils
of deception and discrimination.

For people who have lost everything, the struggle may seem
like a futile attempt to endlessly push a rock uphill (Camus,
1942/1955). The pandemic fatigue may turn into pandemic
burnout (Millard, 2021). The universality of suﬀering is a fact
that we can no longer deny or avoid in the age of COVID-19.
The natural tendency to avoid or escape from the pain of life may
create more problems for us. Paradoxically, the greatest discovery
of dialectical psychology is radical acceptance, the idea that to
embrace and make the best use of all of one’s pain for a better
life is a better alternative to ﬁnding healing and ﬂourishing.

However, our optimistic view (Wong, 2020a, 2021a,e) is based
on empirical evidence (Bethelmy and Corraliza, 2019; Lin et al.,
2021; Worth and Smith, 2021; Yaden and Newberg) regarding
the power of self-transcendence, which comes from altruism
(Feigin et al., 2014), religious faith (Koenig, 2009), meaning
(Wong, 1998), and the feeling of awe (Yaden et al., 2017).
According to Wong (2021b), the worst of times is also the best
of times, but we cannot celebrate the best without overcoming
and transcending the worst. This sums up the power of self-
transcendence, which achieves the dual purpose of transforming
suﬀering into resilience and motivating us to pursue the highest
ideals. This vertical dimension of self-transcendence is often
neglected because current psychology research tends to focus
on the horizontal dimension of self-actualization, pro-social
behaviors, and the emotion of awe.

In sum, when probably understood,

self-transcendence
represents what is good and noble about humanity. It is like a
symphony celebrating the heroic eﬀorts of those who sacriﬁce
themselves in order to lift others above their suﬀering to a
higher ground of faith, hope, and love. More importantly,
it has the power of inspiring countless others to transcend
their petty, egotistic concerns and serve something greater
than themselves. However, this mega shift demands more than
individual endeavors. It also requires a collective eﬀort to co-
create a more just and compassionate society.

At this crucial juncture of history, it is advisable to honestly
and deeply examine our cultural beliefs and our own existential
crises. In this article, we intended to explain and demonstrate
empirically why self-transcendence can not only buﬀer us against
COVID-19, but also transform us from a self-centered and self-
absorbed existence to a self-transcendent and fulﬁlling life.

Cushman’s (1990) social-historical analysis on “the empty self-
phenomenon” is still relevant to the current meaning crisis. He
pointed out that broad historical forces, such as industrialization,
urbanization, and secularism, have shaped Western culture and
inﬂuenced the predominant psychological view of human beings
as bounded, autonomous, masterful, but with empty selves.
America is one of the richest countries, but it is also one of the
emptiest ones because Americans try to ﬁll their inner emptiness

with the consumption of products, drugs, psychotherapy, or
happiness coaches. Such eﬀorts are self-defeating because our
spiritual yearning for meaning can only be ﬁlled by constitutive
goods, which are intrinsic to human existence, such as friendship,
justice, and prosocial behavior.

The main argument in Cushman’s study is that “in a world
sorely lacking in community and tradition, the most eﬀective
healing response would be to address those absences through
structural societal change by reshaping political relationships
and cultural forms and re-establishing the importance of their
transmission” (p. 607). He raised the important question,
“Could psychology now become a helpful force, assisting in the
development of a perspective on the masterful, bounded self
in opposition to the current system? Given the history of the
Western self and the role of psychology within that history, it is
doubtful” (p. 609).

as

In view of Cushman’s analysis, our current mental health
crisis is partly one of our own making, with the misguided
self-contained
Western conception of human beings
masterful individuals who are entitled to feel happy every day
by consuming instrumental rather than constitutive goods.
Constitutive goods are natural and intrinsic goods, such as
connections with the self, with others, and with God because of
our human nature, according to the self-transcendence paradigm
of Wong (2020a, 2021a). More importantly, we hope that this
push for a change of direction in psychology will also drive the
public dialogue toward how to restore civil virtues and spiritual
values in our culture, such as responsibility, cooperation,
altruism, reverence for life, and benevolence.

Self-transcendence is important for psychology and society
because it is a promising way to balance self-interest with
social interest. Consistent with Cushman’s analysis, mainstream
psychology still focuses on the scientiﬁc study of diﬀerent aspects
of the self as a masterful individual, such as the internal locus of
control, self-eﬃcacy, self-control, self-esteem, signature character
strengths, and achievement. However, during diﬃcult times, such
as this pandemic, survival and ﬂourishing depend on our ability
to transcend adversity and selﬁshness by making the necessary
sacriﬁces for the common good. There is an urgent need for
public awareness of the importance of “we” over “me” in times
of national crises.

Paradoxically, the power of self-transcendence in contributing
to well-being, resilience, and the richness of our lives seems
to come from embracing and transcending suﬀering, vis-à-vis
from losing ourselves in the beauty and goodness around us to
sacriﬁcing immediate gratiﬁcation in pursuit of the long-term
worthy life goal to serve the common good. In the ﬁnal analysis,
it appears that developing the capacity to endure and transcend
our misfortunes, trauma, suﬀerings, and fears over and over again
in order to serve something or someone is more important for
surviving and thriving, especially in the era of COVID-19. The
lifelong research of the ﬁrst author and clinical practice support
this proposition. This is the core message of this study.

What Is Self-Transcendence
According to the American Psychological Association (APA),
is
self-transcendence is “the state in which an individual

able to look beyond himself or herself and adopt a larger
perspective that includes concern for others. Some psychologists
maintain that self-transcendence is a central feature of the
healthy individual, promoting personal growth and development
(ﬁrst described by Viktor E. Frankl) (American Psychological
Association, 2020a).” Literally, self-transcendence refers to
that which goes beyond our own limitations and diﬃculties
in life experience in order to serve or become connected
with something greater. According to Ackerman (2021), self-
transcendence is experienced when there is a “realization that
you are one small part of a greater whole, and act accordingly.”
This humanness of being bound by all kinds of constraints can
only be unbound through the transcendental realm (Elmer et al.,
2003).

The transcendence principle encompasses nature, science,
religion, politics, culture, or anything that is greater or beyond
human experiences (van Deurzen, 2014). Transcendence also
generally refers to the complex emotions that arise from a sense
of unity with other people, nature, and God, such as awe and
selﬂessness (Keltner and Haidt, 2003; Mikulak, 2015; Yaden et al.,
2017).

Self-Transcendence as a Religious or
Spiritual Experience
Self-transcendence involves
the motivation to experience
something sacred and beyond the daily mundane experience.
Human existence is ordinary and material until we can perceive
and take hold of the part of us that seeks out the realm of sacred
experience larger than the self (Mayseless and Russo-Netzer,
2017). These self-transcendent sacred moments add some deeper
spiritual meaning to our lives.

religious
experiences. For example, William James (1902/2004) wrote:
“The only thing that religious experience, as we have studied
it, unequivocally testiﬁes to is that we can experience union
with something larger than ourselves and in that union ﬁnd
our greatest peace.” van Deurzen (2014) pointed out
that
transcendence can also be related to polytheism:

“Transcendence is experienced as related to the many diﬀerent
gods and divine representations that need to be appeased. Many
clients hold such hidden views. They say prayers to the various
deities, icons, or saints they believe in and feel they will only
be able to surpass their problems if the gods are favorable
to them. Polytheistic beliefs often go with a strong sense of
community and community support is crucial for transcendence
to become possible.”

Similarly, Frey and Vogler (2019) concluded that, according
to research in the humanities and social sciences, individuals who
can locate themselves in a larger or broader perspective, whether
it is within the family, community, or religious or spiritual
groups, often experience greater happiness, meaning, and virtue.
More importantly, this ﬁnding is relevant to all major religions,
both Eastern and Western.

Self-Transcendence as an Emotional
Response of Awe
The self-transcendent emotion refers to a category of emotions
such as awe, love, elevation, and appreciation, among others, that
connect people in social relationships (Stellar et al., 2017).

Awe is a natural emotional response to something spectacular
or sacred, such as a glorious sunset or an ancient temple,
which may be considered as a deep existential-spiritual response
(Schneider, 2009, 2011). According to a study by Keltner and
Haidt (2003) on cognitive interpretation, awe tends to arise from
a perception of vastness and a cognitive need to accommodate
our own perception into existing mental schemas.

The importance of this transcendental emotion, speciﬁcally
for well-being, has received increasing empirical attention (Yaden
et al., 2017; Allen, 2018). For example, Bethelmy and Corraliza
(2019) reported that various recent studies have demonstrated
the power of nature to induce the transcendental emotion
of awe. They developed an instrument to measure sublime
emotion toward nature, which includes the feeling of awe and
inspiring energy. More recently, Clewis et al. (2021) discovered
that there is much overlap between awe and sublime feelings,
suggesting that these two pieces of literature could inform one
another. In terms of application, Passmore and Holder (2016)
reported that a 2-week nature-based well-being intervention
increased transcendental beneﬁts such as positive aﬀect, elevating
experiences, a general sense of connectedness (to other people,
to nature, and to life as a whole), and prosocial orientation as
compared with the human-built and control groups.

According to the self-transcendence model described later,
there are at least seven ways to boost the emotions of awe. We
can stand in awe of the following phenomena:

1. The power of life forcing us to grow and bear fruits against

all odds.

2. The wisdom of human mind to probe into the mystery of life.
3. The virtue of love in sacriﬁcing the self for others.
4. The magic of gratitude to ﬁll our hearts with happiness.
5. The invincible courage to stand up against evil.
6. The unwavering faith in creating a better future.
7. The unspeakable joy of losing oneself to become a part of

something greater, e.g., nature or the Creator.

Self-Transcendence as Altruistic and
Prosocial Behavior
Self-transcendence has both a vertical and horizontal dimension.
We can transcend upward toward God, nature, or an invisible
spiritual realm, and we can also transcend toward others by
serving and connecting with them. We proposed that our innate
self-transcendence tendency can account for altruistic, helping,
and prosocial behaviors. This tendency can be reinforced by
the intrinsic feeling of good from doing good (Mruk, 2018)
and the positive eﬀect of connecting with others, thus meeting
our need for companionship and social and emotional support
(Meek, 2012). Recently, some researchers found that the natural
transcendental emotional response to some powerful stimuli is
suﬃcient to make one forget our own “small self ” and pay

attention to others or engage in prosocial behavior (Piﬀ et al.,
2015; Guan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019).

on meaning-seeking model proposed by Wong (2016b), which
will be explained in detail later.

In contrast to egotism, altruism is motivated by our desire to
increase the welfare of another person, even when it may cost
something to ourselves (Bartlett and DeSteno, 2006). It is the kind
of prosocial behavior that beneﬁts others without any expectation
of return (Eisenberg and Miller, 1987; Feigin et al., 2014). There is
increasing research evidence that the natural emotional response
of awe is suﬃcient to make one forget their own small self and
self-interest and, instead, pay attention to others or engage in
prosocial behavior (Keltner and Haidt, 2003; Piﬀ et al., 2015; Li
et al., 2019).

Volunteering is another form of prosocial behavior, which is
very relevant to retirees today because it enables them to stay
connected and make some contribution to society and, in return,
contributes to their health and meaning in life (Wilson, 2000;
Midlarsky and Kahana, 2007). Recent research has conﬁrmed that
such acts of kindness contribute to own well-being (Curry et al.,
2018; Hui et al., 2020).

Self-Transcendence as Virtue and Value
According to the study of Peterson and Seligman (2004),
transcendence encompasses several character strengths such
as an appreciation for beauty gratitude, hope, humor, and
religiousness (having a solid belief about a higher purpose and
meaning of life); it represents one of the six virtues. Although
they do not make explicit references to God or religion, Peterson
and Seligman (2004) recognized the universality of religion and
spirituality: “Although the speciﬁc content of spiritual beliefs
varies, all cultures have a concept of an ultimate, transcendent,
sacred, and divine force” (p. 601).

The large-scale studies by Sortheix and Schwartz (2017)
among European countries found that self-transcendence was
positively related to subjective well-being. More importantly,
they did not ﬁnd any support for the expectation that self-
transcendence might also be detrimental to subjective well-being
because self-transcendence often entails investing more in the
well-being of others than in their own.

Self-Transcendence as Personal Growth
Humanism is also based on the principle of self-transcendence
(van Deurzen, 2014). According to humanistic psychology, self-
transcendence is a growth motivation to connect with others.
According to DeRobertis and Brand (2019):

“The purpose of the self-transcending motivational tendency is to
relate to things and others in the most meaningful and profound
manner, overriding (without necessarily eliminating) concern for
own enjoyment or self-interest.”

Wong (2016a) described self-transcendence as a paradoxical way
toward personal growth. In other words, the best path toward
self-actualization and personal growth is through transcending
our limitations toward the greater good. His approach is based

“Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive
or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating,
as ends rather than means, to oneself, to signiﬁcant others, to
human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and the
cosmos” (Maslow, 1971, p. 269).

On the other hand, Frankl argued that self-transcendence
was merely a by-product of pursuing self-transcendence. Wong
(2005) provided a similar but more detailed critique of Maslow’s
hierarchical model. However, Kaufman (2020) is correct in
arguing that there is no real conﬂict between self-actualization
and self-transcendence because one moves freely from one state
to another in a ﬂuid manner. Actually, everyone begins with
self-actualization, as we desire to develop our potentials and
become our best selves; however, this can only happen when we
are awakened to our need for b-values of being-values, such as
goodness, rightness, justice, and benevolence, which are the kind
of values that characterize self-transcendence. No purposes are
equal. If the life goal of an individual is egotistic and worldly,
success may result in them ruining their own lives (Holiday,
2016).

The study by Rogers (1961) on organismic valuing theory
is also moving toward the direction of self-transcendence
as evidenced in the study by Kaufman (2020) on the new
science of self-actualization. Likewise, Maurer and Daukantaite
(2020) reviewed a great deal of empirical evidence supporting
the connection between the organismic valuing theory of
personal growth and self-transcendence. In a qualitative study
of highly self-transcendent individuals, Reischer et al. (2021)
conﬁrmed that such individuals tended to narrate their lived
experiences as spiritual journeys of humanistic growth toward
self-transcendence during the later middle age.

From the psychodynamic perspective, Dobson (2015)
reported that self-transcendence represents personal growth
toward spiritual and moral maturity:

“For Jung as well as for Kohut, one’s maturation into a whole
self, one’s hoped-for completion of the task of individuation is
a transcendent, transpersonal act of great moral responsibility”
(p. 9).

Self-Transcendence Contributes to Mature
Happiness
Life is full of dilemmas, paradoxes, contradictions, and suﬀering.
We need to face life in its totality with the existential courage
to face suﬀering and death (Van Tongeren and Van Tongeren,
2020): “Courage is the universal self-aﬃrmation of one’s Being in

the presence of the threat of non-Being” (Tillich, 1952, p. 163).
The only way we can ﬁnd ways to transcend adversity is to learn
how to muster enough courage to face the stress and negative
emotions of each day.

van Deurzen (2014) provided a very useful survey of major
existential philosophers to make the point that the single-minded
pursuit of happiness as the end goal of life is doomed to fail.
She began by pointing out that it is not possible to think of
the positive without thinking of the opposite side: “Happiness
and unhappiness are twins that grow up together”. Therefore,
there is a need to transcend and integrate all the contractions
and oppositions in life, according to the dialectics of Hegel
on synthesis from the thesis and antithesis. Greater truths and
integrations in life and in research, can only come from such
a synthesis. She also cited the notion of Sartre on re-inventing
oneself or re-deﬁning a situation so as not to get stuck: “Man
is characterized above all by his going beyond a situation and
by what he succeeds in the making of what he has been
made”. Therefore, she eloquently pointed out the impossibility
of personal growth and mature happiness without transcending
the unavoidable and inescapable paradoxes and suﬀerings in
human existence:

“The paradox of life is that only if we accept both aspects of
these oppositions and contradictions that we can transcend our
diﬃculties and ﬁnd new and more creative ways to encompass the
whole span of human ability and challenge.

It is only when we are willing to face death and pain that we can
live life to the fullest, instead of worrying ourselves sick and trying
to be healthy and wealthy and comfortable all the time, which
leads to a life lived in fear.

It is only when we allow ourselves to notice our weakness and
vulnerability that real strength is found instead of us covering up
our doubts by narcissistic pretense or giving in to our fragility by
self-destructive denial of ourselves.”

See Figure 1 depicting diﬀerent types of happiness and Figure 2
for diﬀerent types of well-being. Also, see the tentative global
theory of well-being of Wong, which represents the ideal of
Taoism (Figure 3).

Ancient philosophies, such as Taoism and Buddhism, also
contribute to our understanding of mature happiness. For
example, I-Ching oﬀers the Way to live a good life in an
uncertain and ever-changing world. Happiness is never just about
individual pursuit, but about the way to achieve harmony as
reﬂected by the Taoist concept of the union between Heaven and
people (天人合一), or living in harmony with heaven, earth, and
people (天地人和).

Therefore, the less-traveled path to happiness is to attain inner

peace and harmony with self, others, and Heaven and Earth.

contradictions provides the necessary background for the
psychology of mature happiness. Wong and Bowers (2018)
made a similar argument that mature happiness, characterized
by inner peace and harmony, comes from the wisdom and
courage to transcend opposites. More recently, Lomas (2021)

declared that: “an overarching deﬁnition of well-being is oﬀered:
the dynamic attainment of optimal balance and harmony in
any–and ideally all–aspects of life.” (Lomas, 2021, p. 5). Thus,
in addition to the emotion of awe, mature happiness comes
from cultivating wisdom, courage, and virtue in transcending
suﬀering (Wong, 2020a, 2021a). True happiness comes from

It

When probably understood, self-transcendence represents the
most beautiful story about what is good and noble about
humanity.
is an uplifting story about human beings,
individually or collectively, who dedicate and sacriﬁce themselves
in order to lift up others beyond their limitations and suﬀerings
to a higher ground of faith, hope, and love. Thus, in addition to
this re-orientation, the willingness to suﬀer for the common good
is another deﬁning characteristic of self-transcendence, because it
is not possible to achieve the highest ideal or deepest meaning of
an individual without any sacriﬁce or suﬀering.

In short, Frankl attempted to restore the soul or the
noetic (spiritual dimension) to psychology and society (Wong,
2021c). Thus, the meaning of life or self-transcendence is about
developing the gift an individual has so they can give their best to
serve the world (Wong, 2016a).

Research supports Frankl’s deﬁnition of meaning in terms
of a search for self-transcendence. For example, Harris et al.
(2018) showed that ﬁnding meaning is an essential element
of self-transcendence. McClintock (2015) reported that self-
transcending gratitude may be the very key to how we can
become change agents of making a diﬀerence in the world. A
sense of the self-transcendental motivates individuals to live a
meaningful life and use their gifts to make a positive contribution
to society (Wong, 2014a, 2016a).

The remembrance of Wong (2021c) on the contribution
revolved around
to self-transcendence

of Viktor Frankl
three themes:

(1) Self-transcendence is an awe-ﬁlled lifestyle of serving a

cause passionately.

(2) Self-transcendence is the core of meaning-focused therapy
and an important adjunct for all therapeutic dimensions.
(3) Self-transcendence has become the foundation of existential

positive psychology.

According to Frankl (1946/1985), self-transcendence is the
essence of human nature; it presents a healthy spiritual core with
its yearning to strive toward the sacred and the service of others:

that someone is living out

“Only to the extent
this self-
transcendence of human existence, is he truly human or does he
become his true self. He becomes so, not by concerning himself
with his self-s actualization, but by forgetting himself and giving
himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward.”

Self-transcendence involves a change of mindset from what I can
get from life to what I can give to life. It involves a shift from the
horizontal dimension of being preoccupied with worldly success
and comfort to the vertical way of living that focuses on the
spiritual needs an individual has for meaning, personal growth,
and serving something sacred or greater than oneself. This
quantum shift is necessary to ﬁll the void of the empty self and
enable us to become our best version despite internal and external
limitations. This is why Frankl suggested that the best way an
individual can discover their own calling is to discover both what
gift they can oﬀer and what life demands from their own lives.
Thus, we are responsible, both ethically and instrumentally, for
the well-being of our neighbors because we are an integral part

FIGURE 3 | Toward a general theory of global well-being.

being the light to banish the darkness in the world. It means the
self-transcendental way is enduring the necessary suﬀering and
self-sacriﬁce for the greater good. According to Wong (2021b),
there are three major types of happiness as shown in Figure 1.
Mature happiness is basically spiritual (noetic) happiness based
on self-transcendence, but it could also be known as charionic
(Wong, 2011 PP 2.0), because the Greek word for rejoicing in
suﬀering is Xαíρετ ε (chairete) as found in Philippians 4:4 of
the Bible.

Frankl’s Self-Transcendence Model
The earliest and most inﬂuential theory of self-transcendence was
developed by Frankl (1946/1985). Researchers routinely credit
Frankl as the father of meaning-focused therapy, but they fail
to understand conceptualization of meaning in terms of self-
transcendence that Frankl proposes. A deep sense of meaning
involves the volition to exercise the will to the meaning of
an individual to pursue self-transcendence for the common
good regardless of sacriﬁce and suﬀering. Meaning is not
only anchored on subjective feelings, but also on an objective
behavioral commitment to devoting one’s life to loving something
or someone greater than oneself, such as loving others or serving
society according to one’s calling. This paradoxical truth of self-
fulﬁllment is clearly stated in this quote:

that someone is living out

“Only to the extent
this self-
transcendence of human existence, is he truly human or does
he become his true self. He becomes so, not by concerning
himself with his self ’s actualization, but by forgetting himself
and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward”
(Frankl, 1977/2011, p. 36).

of a relational world. This is why being ethical and benevolent
toward others is an inherent part of self-transcendence (Wong
and Reilly, 2017).

Frankl’s Two-Factor Theory of
Self-Transcendence
As shown in Figure 4, the theory of self-transcendence proposed
by Frankl rests on two factors.

to meaning,

the motivational

Will to Meaning as a Motivational Factor
The will
factor that propels
people from point “A” toward “B” through the process of self-
transcendence, is considered by Frankl as a primary motivation.
From the perspective of
life, self-
transcendence was one of the universal values according to
Schwartz (1992, 1994). The will to meaning consists of both
the push and pull motivations in our own striving toward a
meaningful goal, which is pushed by the yearning of the soul and
pulled by a future purpose to be fulﬁlled.

the terminal values of

Meaning-Mindset as the Cognitive Factor
The meaning-mindset (MM) consists of the worldviews or
assumptions of an individual aﬃrming that life has inherent
meaning and value (Wong, 2012). If mindfulness adds clarity by
reducing the emotional reactivity of an individual, MM provides
the lens that adds content and depth to their perception. It
enables people to see things from a deeper spiritual perspective.

Furthermore, MM enables one to see the connectivity of all
people and all living things and to discover the signiﬁcance of
ordinary events. In short, we tend to discover or see what we value
or search.

Contrary to positive psychology’s preference to emphasize
the positive emotion of awe, the emphasis of Frankl is on will
and mindset. The MM facilitates the discovery of meaning and
signiﬁcance and the selection of worthy life goals to pursue.
These two factors work together to contribute to the discovery
of self-transcendence at all three levels. Meaning-mindset opens
our own perceptions to all the hidden meanings in ordinary life
experiences, including sunsets to sunrises, the starry skies and
snow-capped mountains, the spontaneous play of little children,
and the wrinkled smiling faces of old people; these experiences
can move us with a sense of wonder and appreciation of life.

The importance of having a realistic and yet positive
worldview is emphasized (van Deurzen, 2014; Wong, 2021d).
Research also indicated that the worldview of an individual that
life has inherent meaning that facilitates goal-striving toward
sacred emotions (Emmons, 2005) or eudaimonic happiness
(Braaten and Huta, 2016). In addition, Haidt (2000, 2003)
provided evidence that being open to the possibilities of
discovering meaning and connecting with something larger
increases the likelihood of awe and the positive emotion
of elation. Together,
these two factors contribute to the
pursuit and discovery of self-transcendence, which has four
deﬁning characteristics.

Self-Transcendence Buffers COVID-19 Suffering

The Four Deﬁning Characteristics of
Self-Transcendence
A Shift in Focus From the Self to Others
This involves a re-orientation from egotistic concerns or
selﬁshness toward something greater or someone more valued
than oneself. There is a new sense of selﬂessness in being
connected with something vast or grand or someone more
important than our own lives. While the will to meaning
provides the necessary motivation to actively engage in searching
for self-transcendence, the MM provides the worldview and
openness to discover something that transcends selﬁshness and
personal limitations. This re-orientation may happen at three
levels: the transpersonal, life as a whole, and situational. At
the transpersonal level, there is a perceived connection with
God, nature, or all
living things. There is a new openness
to the spiritual/transcendental realm and the possibilities of
meaning, beauty, and goodness all around us, which facilitate
our discovery of all these ideals. At the level of life as a
whole, there is an awareness of one’s worthy life purpose
or the unconditional
self-acceptance and aﬃrmation that
their lives have inherent meaning and value, independent of
their possessions or achievements. An awareness of major
life transitions and the mortality an individual has can shift
the focus from a preoccupation with earthly concerns to
the larger schemes of things and the transcendental realm.
Spiritual conversion may also shift the focus from the city of
earth to the city of heaven (Tolstoy, 1882/1921; Augustine,
2009).

A Shift in Values
This involves a shift in emphasis from extrinsic motivation
to intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to doing
something in its own right, such as playing, doing good deeds,
or caring for friends and loved ones. Such activities are not
only inherently rewarding and worthwhile but also beneﬁcial
to others and make the world a better place. One engages
in self-transcendence for its own sake, rather than as an
instrument to serve some other extrinsic motive. It also entails
the willingness to sacriﬁce self-interest for serving the greater
good or a higher purpose. Intrinsic motivation also means
pursuing some goal that has intrinsic or inherent value, which
is the value that is good in itself and for its own sake, such as
the goal of helping others, saving lives, or saving planet earth.
The study of Frankena (1973) regarding the list of intrinsic
values includes life, consciousness, love, virtue, justice, and all
things that are morally good inherently. These shifts in focus
and values may result from a personal encounter with a life-
changing event, such as surviving 9/11 or a serious illness, but
also from a shift in perspective from a success orientation to
a spiritual or meaning orientation as a result of reading the
books of Frankl or seeing a meaning therapist. These shifts
emphasize that all people are hardwired for connecting with
each other and with a higher power or the cosmos. Therefore,
relational pursuits motivated by love and compassion are deeply
satisfying to the extent they meet the deepest spiritual needs of
an individual.

An Increase in Moral Concern
There is increased attention to the moral dimension in the pursuit
and action of a goal by an individual. The above shifts are
aligned with the moral compass of an individual, which includes
law), religiously
their own innate conscience (natural moral
or theologically based moral law, and some culturally based
normative vision of moral values and virtues. The cardinal virtues
according to Plato and Confucius, or the normative ethics of
the golden rule, are part of the moral compass that diﬀerentiates
true self-transcendence from pseudo- self-transcendence, such as
terrorist suicide bombers. In addition, we are endowed with the
capacity for moral reasoning. We evaluate some goals and actions
as moral when they are consistent with our moral compass. Moral
responsibility is important to ensure that we are sensitive to the
well-being and rights of other people when we strive for our goals
and make decisions.

Emotions of Awe
All the above three characteristics may trigger emotions of
elevation. These emotions include awe, ecstasy, or amazement
because of something extraordinary in its vastness (God or
nature), ability (exceptional accomplishment), or goodness
(special kindness of one person toward another). This feeling
of awe is part of a life-transforming experience because it
moves people toward worship or becoming better and more
responsible individuals.

Peak experiences (Maslow, 1964) and the experience of
timelessness inﬂow (Csikszentmihalyi and Hunter, 2003) often
involve the emotion of awe. Watching sunsets,
listening to
classical music, or worshiping God in a church or temple can
all contribute to the emotion of awe. Dobson (2015) provided a
thorough review of the literature on awe and concluded that awe
is related to a diminished sense of the self.

In a qualitative study, Bonner and Friedman (2011) also
identiﬁed similar themes in their analysis of the accounts of
participants when they experienced awe. Speciﬁcally, they found
that when participants experienced awe, they described that they
were part of something larger than themselves. In addition, the
experience of awe was associated with a decreased attention to
the self. Generally, the emotion of awe contributes to a shift in
focus, well-being (Rudd et al., 2012), and self-transcendence goals
(Seaton and Beaumont, 2015). Furthermore, Kristjánsson (2015)
has also examined how awe is related to humility and virtue.

In view of this ﬁner diﬀerentiation of the four deﬁning
characteristics, Wong developed the 24-item Self-Transcendence
Measure (STM) with six items pertaining to each dimension,
which was later revised into 21-items after eliminating items with
double-loadings. This revised STM has already been used in a
few studies to demonstrate its validity. For example, the study
by Dhillon (2020) on path analysis has empirically supported
the self-transcendence spiral hypothesis of Wong (2017), which
posited that, when there is a clear shift in focus from the self
to the other as measured by STM, there is an increase in the
“meaning-virtues-happiness” cycle. In another study, Dhillon
(2021) showed that STM is negatively associated with depression,
but positively correlated with social support, meaning in life,
and positive traumatic growth in divorced women. Finally, the

the future. Similarly, when we are in desperate situations beyond
human control, we naturally pray to God or a higher power for
help (Goodman, 2020). To protect ourselves against the terror
of death, we may unconsciously identify with our cultural beliefs,
according to terror management theory (Pyszczynski et al., 2004).
Likewise, hope is also an optimistic state of positive
expectation, but it is often related to having conﬁdence in our
own eﬃcacy. Whatever our goal or plan, we are motivated to
work toward such only when we have some agentic hope of
success. According to hope theory (Snyder and Lopez, 2009),
hope is deﬁned as the perceived ability to discover the pathways
to desired goals and the eﬃcacy to achieve these goals. There
is vast literature supporting hope theory. While faith makes all
things possible, hope makes the prospect of our future plans
brighter, and love connects us all together.

When it comes to love, compassion, and relationships, the
literature is beyond measure. Supreme human achievements,
from medicine and science to religion and literature, are
motivated by love. Some of the best poems and pieces of music
are inspired by love. There is a very long list of publications
on the importance of loving and connecting with others (for
examples, see Adler, 1938/2011; Fromm, 1956/2019; Ainsworth,
1989; Baumeister and Leary, 1995). There is a consensus that
humans are hardwired to connect (Golemen, 2007; Siegal, 2010).
At the personal level, we desire to love and to be loved.
Intuitively, we believe that love is the antidote to loneliness and
the key to happiness. A life without love is like a garden without
water. We need love in order to satisfy the deepest yearnings of
our souls and make our lives complete.

In sum, our souls need faith, hope, and love just as our
bodies needs air, food, and water. When any of these basic
psychological/spiritual needs are not met, we will experience a
loss of life balance and an increase in distress. In this study, we
tested this hypothesis (see the main study) and found that the
evidence supports our claim that these three pillars of mental
health (or the golden triangle of well-being) are capable of
not only enabling us to cope eﬀectively with the suﬀering of
COVID-19, but also transforming us into better and stronger
human beings.

the

Wong (2021a,d) proposed that

self-transcendence
approach to global well-being involves so many fundamental
changes in assumptions and methodologies that it represents a
new paradigm of ﬂourishing through suﬀering. It hypothesized
that all the good things in life are on the other side of fear, and all
the best things in life are on the other side of suﬀering. Therefore,
it is diﬃcult, if not impossible, to achieve ﬂourishing without
going through the gates of overcoming adversity as reﬂected by
Figure 6.

Figure 6 indicates that only by incorporating the realism of
transcending or overcoming the harsh reality of life can we
achieve ﬂourishing, especially in the era of COVID-19, when
suﬀering can no longer be ignored or avoided. Thus, it requires a
radically diﬀerent set of basic assumptions for well-being:

1. Everything exists in polarity. The old way of binary, either-
or thinking is that everything is either positive or negative as
two opposite poles on the same dimension. The new way is to

study of Dhillon and Singh (2021) reported that, in young adults,
humanity was the only virtue correlated with STM, whereas in
the middle-aged sample, all virtues as measured by the Values
in Action (VIA) Survey of Peterson and Seligman (2004) were
correlated with STM.

Wong’s Self-Transcendence Paradigm
According to Wong’s self-transcendence paradigm (Wong,
2021a), self-transcendence can only be experienced through
satisfying the deepest yearning of the soul for connections with
our own selves, with others, and with God, which are the three
major life domains, as shown in Figure 5.

Frankl (1946/1985) got it right when he said that love is the
ultimate truth: “The truth-that love is the ultimate and highest
goal to which man can aspire.” Indeed, the most promising way
to live a good life is to aim for the highest ideal of unconditional
love (agape) for the self, for others, and for God as shown in the
golden triangle.

This requires a radical reorientation from egotistic concerns to
striving for the ideal of becoming the best in order to serve others
and glorify the source of life and all blessings. Such a striving
toward the ultimate concern or the highest good will lead to an
adaptive balance between all opposing forces and result in inner
peace and harmony even during COVID-19.

The concept of faith, hope, and love can be grasped intuitively
because we all have the innate capacity to believe, hope, and
love. Furthermore, this is because we all have experienced these
human qualities even when we are not fully aware of them. For
example, whenever we pledge to marry someone or enter into
a business relationship with someone, we are taking a leap of
faith because people are complex, and we can never fully know or
understand that our partner will be trustworthy or compatible in

see positive and negative as two separate but complementary
dimensions, thus allowing maximum cognitive ﬂexibility and
emotional agility in coping with the world.

2. The old way is to choose between one of two opposite poles.
The new way is to have a mind big enough to hold two
opposing ideas or a heart big enough to hold two opposing
emotions. This involves creative tension and creative thinking
to transcend the two opposites.

3. The old way is to seek to maximize the positive and minimize
the negative, to accept one position and reject the opposite
one. This will result in a polarized mind and a divided society.
The new way is to navigate an optimal balance between two
opposites to maintain dynamic harmony and balance as the
core of well-being.

In sum, self-transcendence is the less-traveled road toward
personal growth and well-being. This narrow path will never be as
popular as the broad way to happiness because it involves tough
choices in favor of what is true, good, and beautiful, but it will
lead you to live a life of meaning and fulﬁllment.

In the age of COVID-19, when people all over the world
are overwhelmed by loneliness, anxiety, and stress, the practice
of self-transcendence will lead to a more compassionate and
harmonious society (Wong, 2016a) and a return to the virtue of
humility and selﬂessness love. In short, the self-transcendence
paradigm requires a very diﬀerent way of doing research and
intervention to promote global well-being.

Development of the STM
The STM was designed as a psychological instrument to measure
self-transcendence. The 24-items of the scale (see the Appendix)
were generated by Wong primarily based on the four-factor
model concept of self-transcendence described earlier. The face
validity of these items was ﬁrst screened by a group of 30
graduate students taking a course on self-transcendence and
by three psychology professors (co-authors of this scale at the

University of East London). The list was then presented to
a group of 30 scholars (including philosophers, theologians,
and psychologists) supported by a Templeton Grant on self-
transcendence (Guerra, 2017) for their feedback. Some of the 24
statements were reworded as a result of their feedback as shown
in the Appendix.

Factor Structure of the STM
Study 1
To examine the factorial structure of the STM, a series of studies
was conducted. Participants were recruited using Mechanical
Turk (www.mturk.com) (Amazon Web Services (AWS), Seattle,
Washington), which is a web portal that facilitates paying
participants to complete tasks such as surveys. Recruiting
participants from Mechanical Turk has exhibited comparable
research results as more conventional methods, with diverse
participants and the sample comprising good generalizability (for
example, see Buhrmester et al., 2011). Furthermore, it avoids
the problem of using weird samples with a more representative
sample (Rad et al., 2018). Participants in these studies were paid
varying amounts ranging from $0.4 to $1.50 based on the length
of the questionnaire in the study.

An initial exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the
24-item measure using data collected from 240 participants
(results from ﬁve participants were excluded because they did not
answer a control question correctly). Among the 235 remaining
participants, 138 (58.7%) were men, 96 (40.9%) were women,
and 1 (0.4%) was other. Their ages ranged from 19 to 73 years
(M = 33.76; SD = 10.74), and 193 (82.1%) reported being from
USA, 34 (14.5%) from India, and 8 (3.4%) from other countries.
All reported having English as their ﬁrst language. A maximum
likelihood factor analysis using Promax rotation (IBM, Armonk,
NY) was conducted and resulted in two factors being retained.
This two-factor solution accounted for 43.3% of the variance,
with the ﬁrst factor explaining 37.9%. However, this analysis did

not yield a clear factor structure. The highest loadings on the ﬁrst
factor were items related to meaning. Several moral items had the
highest factor loadings on the second factor and some items had
dual loadings or low loadings on both factors.

Study 2
The scale items were reduced to 18 of the strongest loading
items, and a second exploratory factor analysis was conducted
on the results from 248 participants (5 were removed due to
not answering the control question correctly) who completed
this scale version. Among the 248 remaining participants, 175
(70.6%) were men and 73 (29.4%) were women. Their ages
ranged from 19 to 65 (M = 31.71; SD = 8.3) years old, and
96 (38.7%) were from USA, 134 (54%) from India, and 18
(7.3%) from other countries. English was reported as the ﬁrst
language by 217 (87.5%) participants. A maximum likelihood
factor analysis of these 18 items using Promax rotation resulted
in two factors being retained. This two-factor solution accounted
for 43.1% of the variance, with the ﬁrst factor explaining 37.3%.

Study 3
The scale was further trimmed by eliminating an additional
six of the original items to produce a 12-item scale that was
completed by another 255 participants; 20 were excluded for
not answering the control question correctly. Among the 235
remaining participants, 134 (57%) were men and 101 (43%)
were women; their ages ranged from 18 to 72 (M = 34.94;
SD = 10.31) years old. Among the participants, 166 (70.6%)
were from the USA, 51 (21.7%) from India, and 18 (7.7%) from
other countries. For 222 (94.5%) participants, English was listed
as their ﬁrst language. A maximum likelihood factor analysis
(Promax rotation) was employed to retain two factors. This two-
factor solution accounted for 42.8% of the variance, with the
ﬁrst factor explaining 35.5%. Two items loaded on both factors
and were subsequently removed to produce the ﬁnal 10-item
Self-Transcendence Measure-Brief (STM-B).

Psychometric Properties of the STM-B
Study 4
To examine the construct and concurrent validity of the STM-B,
254 participants were recruited (34 were subsequently excluded
from the analyses due to not answering the control question
correctly) to complete the scale along with the measures noted
below. Among the remaining 220 participants, 154 (70%) were
men, 65 (29.5%) were women, and 1 (0.5%) was other. Their ages
ranged from 20 to 64 (M = 31.37; SD = 8.34) years; 90 (40.9%)
were from the USA, 107 (48.6%) from India, and 23 (10.5%) from
other countries. Additionally, 202 reported speaking English as
their ﬁrst language.

In addition to the STM-B, the following measures were
completed: The self-transcendence subscale from the Sources of
Meaning Proﬁle-Revised (Reker, 1995), the Collectivism subscale
from Sources of Meaning Proﬁle-Revised (Reker, 1995), and
the Benevolence and Universalism subscales from the Schwartz’s
Value Survey (Schwartz, 1992). The STM-B (M = 29.87; SD =
6.58; N = 220) was found to have very good internal consistency
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88).

FIGURE 7 | Standardized regression weights for the one-factor model of
self-transcendence (N = 220). The models were identiﬁed by setting the factor
loading of the ﬁrst indicator of the latent construct to 1. The presented values
are standardized by setting the variances of both the observed and latent
variables to unity.

A conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out using
the Lavaan package (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) (Rosseel,
2012) in R (R Core Team, 2016) to verify that all STM-B items
were indicators of a single latent variable. As the item responses
were not normally distributed, the robust estimator maximum
likelihood method was used; the results of this analysis indicated
that a single factor model provided a good ﬁt to the data (χ 2 =
45.062, p = 0.119, N = 220; CFI = 0.978; RMSEA = 0.036). The
results of the CFA are summarized in Figure 7.

Study 5
To further examine the psychometric properties of the STM-
B,
including test-retest reliability, an additional study was
conducted that involved participants completing a package of
scales at two points in time.

Time 1. At Time 1, data were collected from 252 participants.
There were 29 participants who failed to answer the control
questions correctly and were removed from the study. Among
the remaining 223 participants, 123 (55.2%) were men and 100
(44.8%) were women. Their ages ranged from 18 to 68 years
(M = 35.4; SD = 11.44), and 159 (71.3%) were from the USA,
40 (17.9%) from India, and the remaining 24 (10.8%) from other
countries. Additionally, 211 (94.6%) reported English as their
ﬁrst language.

In addition to the STM-B, scales included at Time 1 were nine
measures of various aspects of well-being: the Mature Happiness
Scale (Wong and Bowers, 2018; 12 items), the Satisfaction with
Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985; 5 items), the Harmony in Life Scale
(Kjell et al., 2016; 5 items), the Positive and Negative Aﬀect Scale

Scale (Konrath et al., 2014; 1 item).

The coeﬃcient alpha for the STM-B was 0.87, indicating
that the internal consistency was very good in this sample and
comparable with our previous ﬁndings. Table 1 shows the means
and SDs for each of the measures, as well as the correlation
between STM-B and each of the other Time 1 measures. The
STM-B had signiﬁcantly moderate to moderate-high correlations
with most of the measures of well-being. Interestingly, the STM-
B had virtually no correlation with the measure of negative aﬀect
(PANAS negative scale) or the measure of narcissism (Single Item
Narcissism Scale).

Time 2. Among the 223 Time 1 participants, 140 (62.7%)
successfully completed the Time 2 questionnaire. Among these
Time 2 participants, 75 (53.6%) were men and 65 (46.4%) were
women. Their ages ranged from 18 to 65 years (M = 37.2;
SD = 11.28), and 106 (75.7%) were from the USA, 23 (16.4%)
from India, and the remaining 11 (7.9%) from other countries.
Additionally, 137 (97.9%) reported English as their ﬁrst language.
The Time 2 questionnaire included the following measures
also administered at Time 1: the STM-B, the Mature Happiness
Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Harmony in
Life Scale (Kjell et al., 2016; 5 items), and the 15-item Self-
Transcendence Scale (Reed, 1986).

The test-retest reliability for the STM-B was high (r = 0.7,
p < 0.001) over 3–4 weeks. The internal consistency of STM-B
at Time 2 was also high (Cronbach alpha = 0.88), consistent with
our previous results.

The descriptive statistics for Time 2 measures are shown
in Table 2. The correlations between the STM-B and the three
measures of well-being also administered at Time 1 were
moderately high and similar to the Time 1 values. Also, the
correlation between the STM-B and the Self Transcendence Scale
of Reed was moderately high, providing further support for the
convergent validity of the STM-B.

explained what self-transcendence is and why it represents the
most promising path for human beings to ﬂourish through
overcoming and transforming suﬀering in a complex and
uncertain world. After reviewing the literature of a variety of self-
transcendence experiences, we ﬁrst examined the psychometric
properties of the development of the STM in the previous
ﬁve studies. We then tested a moderated mediation model to
explore whether life satisfaction mitigated the negative eﬀect of
coronavirus suﬀering on the psychological adjustment of people
and whether self-transcendence moderated the mediating eﬀect
of it in this association by serving as a buﬀer against coronavirus
experiences (see Figure 8).

METHODS

Participants
Employing a convenience sample and an online survey, the
survey was applied to 183 adults, ranging in age between 20
and 84 years (M = 47.55; SD = 13.11). The study comprised
62% women and 38% men. According to Kline (2015), an

adequate sample size should be 5 or 10 times the amount of
the parameters in the path and factor analysis, and a reasonable
sample size is about 150 (Muthén and Muthën, 2002; Fritz and
Mackinnon, 2007). The sample of this study is thus considered
adequate for the analyses. The participants were recruited
through social media and email within the aﬃliated networks
of the research team. A web-based survey was created using the
study measures and demographic questions. Participants were
informed of the voluntary nature of the study and were assured
that no identiﬁable personal information would be collected to
ensure anonymity.

Measures
Suffering During COVID-19
The Suﬀering Measure During COVID-19 (SM-COVID-19) was
used to measure the suﬀering experiences of people during
COVID-19,
including their adversities (Wong, 2020b). The
scale is a 10-item self-report scale, e.g., “Poor physical health
condition,” and all items were scored using a ﬁve-point Likert
type scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal). The
internal reliability estimate of the scale with the present study was
strong, see Table 3.

Personal Meaning
The brief version of the Personal Meaning Proﬁle (PMP-B)
was used to assess the perception of an individual of personal
meaning and the sense of purpose and personal signiﬁcance
in their lives (McDonald et al., 2012). The PMP-B is a 21-
item self-report measure, e.g., I believe I can make a diﬀerence
in the world. Participants indicated their agreement with each
item on a seven-point Likert type scale, ranging from 1 (not at
all) to 7 (a great deal). The subscales of the PMP-B included
achievement, relationship, religion, self-transcendence, self-
acceptance, intimacy, and fair treatment. The subscale scores can
be summed to form a total score. The internal reliability estimate
of the scale with the present study was strong, see Table 3.

Psychological Adjustment
The Brief Adjustment Scale-6 (BASE) was used to assess
psychological adjustment problems. It is a six-item self-report
instrument, e.g., “I nearly always feel awake and alert,” scoring
on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely)
(Cruz et al., 2020). The internal reliability estimate of the scale
with the present study was strong, see Table 3.

Life Satisfaction
The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) was used to assess
the cognitive emulations of the lives of people. The scale is
a ﬁve-item self-report scale, e.g., “I am satisﬁed with my life,”
responding based on a seven-point Likert type scale from 1
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) (Diener et al., 1985). The
internal reliability estimate with this study sample was strong,
see Table 3.

Data Analyses
The data analyses were performed in two steps. Prior to
testing the proposed model, we ﬁrst examined the psychometric
properties of the STM in the present study. The factor structure
of the scale was identiﬁed using exploratory factor analysis with
the sample derived from the previous study [n = 213 (69%
men, age range = 19–65; M = 31.9 and SD = 8.52); see in the
introduction]. Factor loading scores (λ) ≥ 0.4 are recommended
for selecting the items of the measure (Stevens, 2009; Tabachnick
and Fidell, 2013). After exploring the factor structure of the
measure, we conducted a conﬁrmatory factor analysis to aﬃrm
the latent factor structure of the measure with a sample of the
present study (Figure 9). The results from this analysis were
interpreted using several model ﬁt statistics and their cut-oﬀ
scores: non-normed ﬁt index (NNFI ≥ 0.9 for acceptable ﬁt),
comparative ﬁt index (CFI ≥ 0.9 for acceptable ﬁt), the root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA ≤ 0.1 for acceptable ﬁt),
and the standard root mean square residual (SRMR ≤ 0.1 for
acceptable ﬁt) (Hooper et al., 2008; Kline, 2015).

of the indirect eﬀect (Hayes, 2018). All analyses in the present
study were conducted using SPSS version 25 (IBM, Armonk, NY)
and LISREL version 8.8 (Scientiﬁc Software International Inc.,
Skokie, IL).

RESULTS

Validity and Reliability Analyses of the STM
The results from the exploratory factor analysis, which was
carried out using a principal component analysis with Promax
(oblique) rotation, indicated that the measure yielded a two-
factor solution with eigenvalues >1 that explained ∼58% of the
variance and was characterized by a lack of singularity (Bartlett’s
χ 2 = 854.55, df = 45, p < 0.001) and an adequate sample
size [Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) = 0.88]. The factor loadings
of the measure were adequate-to-strong, ranging between 0.4
and 0.93. Following that, the conﬁrmatory factor analysis results
aﬃrmed the two-factor measurement model, providing adequate
data-model ﬁt statistics [χ 2 = 90.89, df = 34, p < 0.001, NNFI
= 0.92, CFI = 0.93, RMSEA (95% CI) = 0.097 (0.073,0.12),
SRMR= 0.062]. The STM also had adequate-to-strong factor
loadings (λ range = 0.44-0.69), characterized by adequate latent
construct (H = 0.75–0.77–0.86) and internal reliability estimates
(α = 0.73–0.76–0.84), as seen in Figure 9. Additionally, the
correlation results with the measures in this study provided
further evidence for the concurrent validity of the measure. These
results suggested that the STM is a reliable and valid measure for
use in assessing the self-transcendence of people.

Testing the Moderated Mediation Model
We ﬁrst examined descriptive statistics for the variables of the
study, as shown in Table 3. Descriptive statistics indicated that
the kurtosis and skewness scores of the study variables ranged
from −0.82 to 0.59, indicating that the measures of this study
had relatively normal distribution (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013;
Kline, 2015). The correlation analysis results further revealed that
coronavirus-related suﬀering was signiﬁcantly and negatively
associated with life satisfaction (r = −0.22, p < 0.001), while
it positively correlated with psychological adjustment problems
(r = 0.5, p < 0.001). However, the correlation of coronavirus-
related suﬀering with self-transcendence was non-signiﬁcant
(r = −0.01, p = 0.907). Self-transcendence had a signiﬁcant
and positive correlation with life satisfaction (r = 0.33, p <
0.001) and a negative association with psychological adjustment
problems (r = −0.2, p < 0.001). There was also a signiﬁcant and
negative correlation between life satisfaction and psychological

FIGURE 9 | Conﬁrmatory factor analysis results.

In the second step of the analyses, preliminary analyses were
examined including descriptive statistics, analysis assumptions,
and correlations for the variables of the present study. The
assumption of normality was checked based on kurtosis and
skewness values and their decision criteria, namely, skewness
and kurtosis scores ≤ |1| (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013; Kline,
2015). A Pearson correlation analysis was conducted next to
investigate the association between suﬀering, life satisfaction,
psychological adjustment, and self-transcendence. Afterward, we
conducted a moderated mediation analysis to understand the
protective role of self-transcendence on the mitigating eﬀect
of
life satisfaction in the association between coronavirus-
related suﬀering and psychological adjustment problems. The
PROCESS macro version 3.5 (Hayes, 2018) was used to
employ the moderated mediation model (see Figure 8) with
the bootstrapping method with 10,000 resamples to estimate
the 95% CIs (Preacher and Hayes, 2008; Hayes, 2018). The

Table 3.

Second, we conducted the moderated mediation model to test
the protective role of self-transcendence on the mitigating eﬀect
of life satisfaction on the association between coronavirus-related
suﬀering and psychological adjustment problems. The ﬁndings
from the moderated mediation model showed that coronavirus-
related suﬀering had a signiﬁcant predictor eﬀect on the life
satisfaction of people (b = −0.2, p < 0.001) and accounted for
5% of the variance in this variable. Psychological adjustment
problems were signiﬁcantly predicted by coronavirus-related
suﬀering (b = 0.66, p < 0.001) and life satisfaction (b =
−0.45, p < 0.001). These results indicated that life satisfaction

mitigated the adverse impacts of coronavirus-related suﬀering
on the psychological adjustment of people. Further, the analyses
demonstrated that the interaction between coronavirus-related

model, as shown in Table 4. Overall, the model explained
46% of the variance in psychological adjustment problems.
Moreover, the simple slope eﬀect revealed that the indirect eﬀect
of coronavirus-related suﬀering on psychological adjustment
was observed when self-transcendence was high (+1 SD),
moderate, and low (−1 SD), as seen in Figure 10. These
results indicate the protective eﬀect of self-transcendence on the

psychological adjustment of people. Recently, the American
Psychological Association (2020b) reported a nationwide mental
health crisis in 2020 because of COVID-19. However, there is
still a silver lining in the dark cloud ahead of us, that is, the
prolonged lockdown and social isolation also provide a rare
opportunity for self-reﬂection and self-transformation. More
speciﬁcally, we suggest that learning to accept the current
condition and re-orienting our own values and life goals toward
something greater than ourselves can elevate our lives to a
higher plane. The research of Emmons (1986, 2003) on Personal
Goal Striving Theory can also account for the connection
between self-transcendence and well-being because some of
the worthy life goals, such as spirituality and generativity, are
clear examples of self-transcendence. Meaning research has
demonstrated that self-transcendence is a source of well-being
as we reviewed in the introduction. Future research will clarify
the importance of self-transcendence in all kinds of happiness,
including an attunement with oneself, with others, and the world
as a fundamental state of happiness and well-being (Haybron,
2013; Wong, 2014b).

We suggested that

the STM represents an important
instrument in advancing second-wave positive psychology (PP
2.0; Wong, 2011; Ivtzan et al., 2015) for several reasons. Firstly,
it measures a sustainable well-being that is less dependent
on positive emotions and positive circumstances. Secondly, it
shifts the focus from behavior and cognition to the spiritual
dimension that really separates human beings from other
animals. Thirdly, it acknowledges that self-transcendence is the
most promising path to moral virtue, eudaimonic happiness,
and existential meaning. Frankl wanted to make sure that a
good theory of self-transcendence needs to pass the Hitler test,
that is, someone like Hitler can never lay claim to having
lived a worthy self-transcendent
life. This is why he was
at pains to emphasize the conscience test, objective values,
and ethical responsibility toward others. Similarly, Levinas
(1972/2003) also emphasized that a fully functioning human will
transcend self-interest in order to be ethically responsible for
the Other.

To attain self-transcendence is our crowning humanistic
and spiritual achievement, which enables us to move from
instinctive selﬁshness to a state of selﬂessness and a higher
level of consciousness. Self-transcendence motivates people to
devote their time and energy to make positive contributions
in society and appreciate little miracles in everyday life, thus
resulting in greater well-being for themselves and others.
Costin and Vignoles (2020) reported that a sense of mattering
consistently emerged as a signiﬁcant precursor of meaning
in life. Mattering refers to the belief that the actions of an
individual have made a diﬀerence in the world and that they
have lived a signiﬁcant life. We propose that such a belief is
more based on living a life of self-transcendence, as measured by
the STM-B.

It has taken more than 5 years, beginning with Wong
(2016c), and involved many researchers from diﬀerent countries
to develop a reliable and valid measure of self-transcendence.
Consistent with the literature (for examples, see Wong, 2014c;
Yaden et al., 2017; Kaufman, 2020), our series of validation studies
have demonstrated that the STM-B as a measure of or-orientation
our focus and values away from egotism toward others and higher
ideals s indeed signiﬁcantly connected with meaning, benevolent
values, virtues, eudaimonia, and mature happiness.

More importantly, we have demonstrated that the STM-B
is a buﬀer against COVID-19 suﬀering. Thus, we propose that
self-transcendence may be a unique antidote to adversity and
suﬀering and a pathway toward personal growth and mature
happiness. We hope that the STM-B can be used widely as
an instrument to monitor global well-being in the era of the
coronavirus pandemic. In sum, the concept of self-transcendence
proposed by Frankl added both depth and breadth to meaning
in life and may be an important breakthrough in mental health
because it restores the soul or spiritual dimension as the healthy
core in overcoming suﬀering and mental illness.

We realized the limitations of not relying more on prospective
or longitudinal studies. Other recent research in the special
issue of Frontiers on Self-Transcendence (Wong et al., 2021) has
remedied this deﬁciency. On the positive side, it provided a useful
instrument to study self-transcendence as a spiritual motivation
or value.

Everyone is free to pursue what they believe will make them
happy, but they are not free from the negative consequences of
their choices. Often, the consequence could be the painful regret
of hurting their loved ones or getting punished for their unethical
means to achieve their egotistic ends.

This study showed that, by re-orienting the focus and values
of an individual
from their pre-occupation with happiness
as their main life goal to selﬂessly striving toward a worthy
life goal that beneﬁts society, an individual is given a sense
of satisfaction from the intrinsic value of pursuing meaning
self-transcendence. Interestingly, some Japanese psychologists
have developed a Fear of Happiness Scale and Fragility
of Happiness Scale (Namatame et al., 2021). Such a fear
is warranted in view of the avoidable suﬀerings from the
blind pursuit of happiness. We hope that the STM-B will
contribute to the global well-being through the less-traveled path
of self-transcendence.

Self-Transcendence Measure-Brief

My life is meaningful because I live for something greater than myself.

My suffering is more bearable when I believe that it is for my family,
friends, and/or for a higher purpose.

I enjoy the process of striving toward excellence in what matters.

At my funeral, I want to be remembered as a decent human being who
cared about others.

A worthy lifelong pursuit ought to have some intrinsic value—something
that is good in its own right.

What matters most to me in life is the contribution I make to society.

I focus on discovering the potential meaning in every situation.

I devote my life to pursuing the ideals of beauty, goodness, and truth.

I develop my full potential in order to give my best to beneﬁt society.

10.

I am more motivated by doing something meaningful than by the
prospect of receiving external rewards.
