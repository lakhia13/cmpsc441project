Abstract:  Background:  Obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  is  associated  with  affective  and 
cognitive symptoms causing personal distress and reduced global functioning. These have consider-
able societal costs due to healthcare service utilization. 

Objective: Our aim was to assess the efficacy of pharmacological interventions in OCD and clinical 
guidelines, providing a comprehensive overview of this field. 

Methods: We searched the PubMed database for papers dealing with drug treatment of OCD, with a 
specific focus on clinical guidelines, treatments with antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabiliz-
ers, off-label medications, and pharmacogenomics. 

Results: Prolonged  administration of selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs) is most effec-
tive. Better results can be obtained with a SSRI combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
or the similarly oriented exposure and response prevention (ERP). Refractory OCD could be treated 
with different strategies, including a switch to another SSRI or clomipramine, or augmentation with 
an  atypical  antipsychotic.  The  addition  of  medications  other  than  antipsychotics  or  intravenous 
antidepressant  administration  needs  further  investigation,  as  the  evidence  is  inconsistent.  Pharma-
cogenomics and personalization of therapy could reduce treatment resistance. 

Conclusions:  SSRI/clomipramine  in  combination  with  CBT/ERP  is  associated  with  the  optimal 
response  compared  to  each  treatment  alone  or  to  other  treatments.  New  strategies  for  refractory 
OCD are needed. The role of pharmacogenomics could become preponderant in the coming years. 

Keywords: Obsessive compulsive disorder, psychopharmacology, pharmacogenomics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
atypical antipsychotics, off-label treatments. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

  Obsessive-Compulsive  Disorder  (OCD)  is  a  psychiatric 
disorder  included  in  the  DSM-5  Obsessive-Compulsive 
Spectrum  Disorders.  The  main  symptoms  include  intrusive 
thoughts (obsessions), and ritualistic behavior (compulsions) 
[1]. OCD affects more than 1% of the population worldwide 
[2, 3], with lifetime prevalence of 2-3% in the general popu-
lation [4], and no difference in gender distribution, although

juvenile-onset  OCD  is  more  often  familial  and  more  preva-
lent  in  boys  than  in  girls  [5,  6].  Age  at  OCD  onset  is  bi-
modal, with the first peak in  late childhood or early adoles-
cence,  and  the  second  in  early  adulthood  (i.e.,  20-29  years) 
[7, 8]. Onset is usually gradual and its clinical presentation in 
child-onset  and  adult-onset  forms  is  generally  similar  [1]. 
However, these differ in associated comorbidities [5]. Illness 
course has a chronic but fluctuating pattern, which often re-
lates to stressful life events [9, 10]. 

  The  life  of  patients  with  OCD  is  characterized  by  more 
years of disability than that of patients with multiple sclero-
sis  and  Parkinson  disease  combined  [11,  12].  Despite  the 
illness  burden,  it  is  often  unrecognized  or  misrecognized  in

both primary and psychiatric settings, since its symptoms are 
often internally rather than externally expressed, and because 
many  patients  manifest  self-stigma  (symptoms  experienced 
with shame, embarrassment, or guilt) [12-15]. Consequently, 
the mean time from OCD onset to introduction of a pharma-
cological  treatment  is  nearly  eight  years  [12,  16,  17].  Less 
than 40% of patients coming to clinician’s  attention receive 
OCD-specific  therapy,  and  less  than  10%  obtain  evidence-
based  treatment  [12,  18].  Epidemiological  studies  suggest 
that  over  50%  of  patients  with  OCD  have  at  least  one  co-
morbid psychiatric disorder, most commonly an anxiety dis-
order  or  major  depressive  disorder.  Moreover,  alcohol  use 
disorder is more frequent in OCD than in the general popula-
tion [19]. 

  A  preponderance  of  evidence  supports  the  combined 
OCD  treatment  with  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors 
(SSRIs)  and  cognitive  behavioral  approaches.  Most  patients 
show symptom improvement with these interventions, either 
alone  or  in  combination  [20].  Given  this,  clinical  practice 
usually consists of combining SSRI treatment with cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) [21]. However, even when a theo-
retically  appropriate  treatment  is  established,  40-60%  of 
OCD  patients  exhibit  disabling  residual  symptoms,  indicat-
ing the need for innovative pharmacological treatments, dif-
ferent  augmentation strategies,  and novel physical treatment 
techniques [12, 22]. 

  The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive re-
view  of  the  developments  in  the  pharmacological  manage-
ment  of  OCD  in  adults  within  the  past  10  years.  We  re-
viewed the most recent evidence of the effectiveness of anti-
depressant,  antipsychotic,  and  mood  stabilizing  drugs,  as 
well  as  off-label  drug  treatment.  We  summarized  clinical 
guidelines and highlighted the possibilities of a positive  im-
pact of pharmacogenomics and of personalized mental health 
approaches. 

2. METHODS 

2.1. Study Selection 

studies 

  We  performed  a  PubMed  search  to  identify  peer-
reviewed 
investigating  psychopharmacological 
treatments  in  adult  patients  with  OCD.  We  used  a  stepwise 
procedure to identify relevant experimental articles focusing 
on OCD psychopharmacology. First, we identified studies in 
the  last  10  years  through  a  standard  search  with  the  title-
abstract  specification  in  PubMed  (http://www.pubmed.gov). 
On  25  February  2017  we  performed  a  search  including  the 
terms  ‘obsessive  compulsive  disorder’,  ‘pharmacol*’,  ‘anti-
depress*’,  ‘antipsych*’,  ‘lithium’,  ‘stabilis(z)er’,  ‘antiepi-
lept*’, and  excluding the terms ‘p(a)ediatr*’, ‘child*’, ‘case 
report’,  ‘tourette’,  ‘schizophr*’,  ‘bipolar’,  ‘epilepsy’,  ‘neu-
ropsychol*’, 
‘rTMS’, 
‘stimulation’,  ‘ECT’,  ‘surgery’,  ‘*tomy’,  ‘mice’,  ‘animal’, 
‘rat’, ‘dysmorphic’, ‘somatic symptom disorder’, ‘hoarding’, 
‘skin’,  ‘neuroimaging’.  We  retrieved  266  papers.  We  in-
cluded  pharmacological  trials,  and  systematic  reviews  and 
meta-analyses.  We 
included 
child/adolescent patients, case reports, diagnoses of Tourette 
syndrome, dysmorphic, hoarding, excoriation (skin picking), 
nail  biting,  personality,  somatic  symptom  and  other  OCD 

‘personality  disorder’, 

excluded  papers 

‘dTMS’, 

that 

spectrum  disorders,  schizophrenia,  bipolar  disorders,  and 
epilepsy.  We  also  excluded  transcranial  magnetic  stimula-
tions,  surgery,  neuroimaging,  psychometrics,  and  animal 
studies. We excluded 182 studies for not meeting our inclu-
sion- and/or meeting our exclusion-criteria. Of these, 3 were 
animal  studies;  case  reports,  9;  focused  on  CBT  or  psycho-
metrics,  14;  neuroimaging,  13;  not  focused  on  OCD,  63; 
non-systematic  reviews,  20;  mainly  focused  on  clinical  or 
psychopathological aspects, or non-pharmacological studies, 
58;  2  were  focused  on  child/adolescent  patients.  Then,  we 
searched for studies prior  to the  considered period in article 
references  and  on  PubMed  through  the  function  “Similar 
articles”,  further  including  93  other  studies  on  the  basis  of 
our inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Based on these criteria, 
we  finally  included  177  papers  focusing  on  OCD  psycho-
pharmacology (see PRISMA flow-chart, Fig. 1). 

3. DISCUSSION 

3.1. Antidepressant Medications 

  Changes  in  the  serotonergic  transmission,  including  the 
enhancement  of  postsynaptic  signals  induced  by  serotonin, 
have  been  associated  with  OC  symptom  improvement.  In 
physiological  neurotransmission,  serotonin  is  transported 
from  the  synaptic  cleft  back  to  the  presynaptic  neuron 
through  membrane  transporter  proteins  and  from  there  into 
the  readily  releasable  synaptic  pool  through  vesicular 
bioamine  transporters.  SSRIs  can  specifically  block  mem-
brane transporters, resulting in an accumulation of serotonin 
in the synaptic cleft [23]. SSRIs are generally first-line, with 
good  response  rates  and  positive  long-term  results  [23-25], 
despite  the  possible  slight  superiority  of  clomipramine  in 
efficacy studies [26]. 

3.1.1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) 

  Most  of  these  drugs  showed  effectiveness  in  treating 
OCD  both  in  the  acute  and  in  the  maintenance  phase  and 
showed good tolerability. A Cochrane review confirmed the 
efficacy for all SSRIs (including citalopram, fluoxetine, flu-
voxamine,  paroxetine,  and  sertraline),  without  significant 
differences [27]. 

  The response to SSRI treatment may be more delayed in 
patients  with  OCD  than  in  those  with  major  depression  or 
anxiety  disorders.  However,  a  recent  meta-analysis  showed 
that  a  significant  benefit  from  SSRI  treatment  compared  to 
placebo  occurred  already  after  2  weeks  from  the  start  of 
treatment  [28].  Long-term  treatment  (24-52  weeks)  with  an 
SSRI compared to placebo was associated with significantly 
lower  probability  of  relapse  with  SSRIs  [29,  30].  SSRIs 
should  be  maintained  at  the  maximum  effective  dose  for  at 
least  12  months.  Treatment  response  is  dose-related,  with 
better clinical responses associated with higher dosages [29, 
30], although lower doses (e.g., in the  case of escitalopram) 
could  be  effective  in  preventing  relapses  [30].  OCD  family 
history,  aggressive,  sexual,  and  religious  obsessions,  orbi-
tofrontal  cortex  hypometabolism,  and  right  caudate  nucleus 
hypermetabolism correlated with high likelihood of respond-
ing to SSRI treatment [31, 32]. Hoarding behavior [33], poor 
insight,  severe  concomitant  depressive  episode  [34],  and 
higher levels of disability [35] correlated with  limited SSRI 
treatment response.

Several  studies  have  focused  on  paroxetine  treatment  of 
OCD. Doses of 20-60 mg/day generally correlated with sig-
nificant  symptom 
improvement.  Paroxetine  showed  a 
marked anxiolytic effect and may be recommended as a first-
line  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  OCD  comorbidities  [36].  It 
reduced  avoidance  related  to  phobic  symptoms  improving 
quality of life [37]. Its safety and long-term efficacy are sup-
ported by the literature [38]. It has been consistently associ-
ated with treatment response (i.e., drop of at least 25% on the 
Yale-Brown  Obsessive-Compulsive  Scale  [Y-BOCS])  from 
baseline scores [25, 36, 39-42]. 

Placebo-controlled  studies  in  OCD  patients  consistently 
associated  fluvoxamine  administration  (dosage  range  100-
300 mg/day) with treatment response [43-47], although with 
some  exceptions  [48-52].  Fluvoxamine’s  pharmacokinetic 
profile  and  its  side  effects  may  hinder  rapid  titration.  The 
drug showed efficacy in social anxiety, avoidance, and pho-
bic symptoms after 6-8 weeks of treatment and subsequently 
was  associated  with  further  improvement  [53].  Long-term 
treatment  (40-weeks  with  a  dose  of  100-300  mg/day)  was 
associated  with  improvements  of  psychosocial  skills  and 
obsessive symptoms [54]. 

  Citalopram  proved  to  be  effective  in  the  treatment  of 
OCD  [55],  with  best  results  at  doses  of  60  mg/day  [56], 
which  correlated  with  improvements  on  psychosocial  func-
tioning, depressive symptoms, obsessive thoughts, repetitive 
behavior,  and  anxiety.  It  showed  good  tolerability  [57]  and 
appeared  to  be  effective  in  patients  with  refractory  OCD 
[58]. 

  Escitalopram  showed  favorable  pharmacokinetics  and 
good tolerability. It is the most 5-HT-selective among SSRIs, 
with  little or no affinity for other  transmitter  transporters or 
receptors [59].  Compared  to other SSRIs, escitalopram may 
have  weak  or  minimal  interactions  with  the  cytochrome 
P450  system  [60,  61].  In  a  randomized,  double-blind,  pla-
cebo-controlled  24-week  trial  in  OCD,  escitalopram  (20 
mg/day)  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  response  rate 
compared  to  placebo  after  12  weeks.  Other  placebo-
controlled  studies  consistently  showed  escitalopram-related 
treatment response [25, 30]. 20 mg/day escitalopram has also 
been  associated  with  better  OCD  symptom  remission  com-
pared  to  40  mg/day  paroxetine  or  placebo  at  week  12  [30]. 
Three different escitalopram dosages (5, 10, and 20 mg/day) 
were  compared  with  a  fixed,  20  mg/day  dose  of  paroxetine 
in  a  12-week  study,  in  which  escitalopram  showed  both 
greater efficacy and better tolerability [62]. 

Fluoxetine was shown to be safe and  effective  at  a dose 
of  40-60  mg/day  [63,  64].  The  effects  of  fluoxetine  on  dif-
ferent  clinical  OCD  subtypes  have  been  studied,  showing 
improvement  of  obsessive  thoughts,  washing  compulsions, 
psychosocial functioning, and quality of life [65]. Regarding 
the  management  of  phobic  symptoms,  fluoxetine  has  been 
shown to be equally effective in both the short- and the me-
dium-term (24 weeks), both in monotherapy and in combina-
tion  with  CBT  [66].  Placebo-controlled  studies  consistently 
associated  the  administration  of  fluoxetine  with  treatment 
response  (drop  of  at  least  25%  on  the  Y-BOCS  from  base-
line) [63, 64, 67-69], although with some exception [70, 71].

Current Neuropharmacology, 2019, Vol. 17, No. 8    713 

Fluoxetine proved to be useful and safe in preventing recur-
rence  of  obsessive  symptoms  in  patients  who  responded  to 
short-term administration. The low overall relapse rates were 
evident  at  the  maintenance  dose  of  40  mg/day,  although  60 
mg/day seemed to provide more protection. 

Sertraline  has  shown  efficacy  and  safety  at  doses  of  50-
200  mg/day  [72]  in  treating  phobic-related  states,  with  a 
greater reduction in symptoms related to anxiety/fear, physi-
cal  symptoms  and  avoidance  behaviors  [73].  Clinical  im-
provements  in  obsessive  symptoms  and  phobic  behavior 
have been achieved with long-term therapy, with a good tol-
erability profile. A rapid sertraline titration up to 200 mg/day 
correlated  with  fast  response  rates.  A  20-week  study  with 
sertraline 50-200 mg/day produced significant improvements 
both  in  functioning  and  social  skills  [74].  Stable  sertraline 
treatment  guaranteed  lower  recurrence  rates,  and  a  general 
improvement  in  quality  of  life.  Placebo-controlled  studies 
consistently  showed  sertraline-related  treatment  response 
[72, 75, 76], although with one exception [77]. Treatment of 
refractory OCD with high doses of sertraline (250-400 mg/day) 
resulted in a significant symptom improvement and a similar 
rate of adverse events observed with a 200 mg/day dose [78]. 

3.1.2. Clomipramine 

  Clomipramine,  a  tricyclic  antidepressant  (TCA)  with  a 
transporter  blockade  profile  that  is  much  similar  to  the  pro-
files of most SSRIs as far  as the serotonin/noradrenaline ra-
tio is concerned [38], placing it midway between SSRIs and 
SNRIs  and  quite  far  from  other  TCAs,  was  the  first  drug 
used  to  treat  OCD.  In  addition,  one  of  the  primary  metabo-
lites  of  clomipramine,  desmethylclomipramine,  is  a  potent 
noradrenaline  uptake  blocker  [26].  It  has  a  unique  anti-
obsessive  effect  due  to  its  potent  inhibition  of  serotonin  re-
uptake, and this action has drawn attention to a possible role 
of serotonin in the neuropathophysiology of OCD [79]. The 
efficacy of clomipramine  in treating OCD  is well  supported 
by  the  literature  [26].  Among  studies,  a  multicenter  double 
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 122 
OCD  patients  compared  clomipramine  vs.  exposure  and  re-
sponse prevention (ERP) vs. ERP plus clomipramine combi-
nation vs. placebo. The study provided ERP for four weeks, 
with subsequent maintenance sessions for eight weeks and/or 
clomipramine (up to 250 mg/day) treatment for 12 weeks. At 
week 12, all active treatments proved to be superior to placebo. 
ERP  did  not  show  differences  from  clomipramine+ERP 
combination,  which  were  more  effective  than  clomipramine 
only  [80].  Other  data  also  showed  that  intravenous  clomi-
pramine  could  be  effective  in  treating  refractory  OCD  [81]. 
A  10-week  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  conducted 
on 27 OCD outpatients treated with oral clomipramine showed 
that the drug was significantly superior to placebo [82]. An-
other  10-week  double-blind  study  on  thirty-two  OCD  pa-
tients  without  depression  showed  that  the  treatment  with 
clomipramine  was  associated  with  significant  improvement 
in OCD symptoms, although with more frequent and severe 
side  effects  than  placebo  [83].  Two  multicentre  (21  sites) 
double-blind studies focused on the efficacy, safety, and tol-
erability of clomipramine (up to 300 mg/day) vs. placebo in 
520 OCD patients, of whom 239 with more than two years of 
illness (study 1), and 281 between one and two years of ill-

ness (study 2). Both studies demonstrated that clomipramine 
was significantly more effective than placebo. Among the most 
frequent clomipramine-related adverse effects (similar to the 
other tricyclic antidepressants), seizures and aminotransferase 
augmentation  were  the  most  dangerous.  However,  clomi-
pramine was generally well-tolerated [84]. One more double-
blind placebo-controlled study conducted on 25 patients with 
OCD  for  10  weeks  showed  that  clomipramine  treatment  vs. 
placebo  significantly  improved  symptoms.  Side  effects 
mainly  included  heart  rate  increase.  The  authors  showed 
clomipramine-related  attenuation  of  autonomic  reactivity  to 
stressors, which they interpreted as a direct autonomic effect 
of  clomipramine  or  an  increased  unresponsiveness  to  psy-
chological  stressors  [85].  Twenty-five  OCD  patients  with 
moderate  to severe  symptoms and  at least 2 years of  illness 
duration were involved in a double blind, placebo-controlled, 
10-week  study  that  showed  the  superiority  of  clomipramine 
over  placebo.  Another  analysis  focused  on  symptoms  out-
come  and  plasma  drug  concentrations  in  33  OCD  patients 
taking clomipramine showed that clomipramine plasma con-
centrations  directly  correlated  with  outcome  measures.  Pa-
tients  with  treatment  response  significantly  showed  higher 
plasma  clomipramine  and  a  trend  toward  lower  desmethyl-
clomipramine [86]. 

  Clomipramine has been compared to paroxetine in a mul-
tinational  randomised  study  involving  406  subjects  with 
OCD  of  at  least  six  months  duration  received  double-blind 
medication for up to 12 weeks and doses adjusted according 
to therapeutic effect and side-effects. Both treatments proved 
to be an appropriate treatment for OCD [39]. 

Summarising,  the  efficacy  of  clomipramine  in  OCD  is 
consistently  reported  and  appeared  to  be  equivalent  to  or 
slightly  better  than  that  of  SSRIs,  although  its  side  effect 
profile is less favorable [39, 80, 82-86]. 

3.1.3.  Serotonin–Norepinephrine  Reuptake 
(SNRIs) 

Inhibitors 

SNRIs  combine  the  actions  of  SSRIs  with  inhibition  of 
noradrenaline reuptake. These drugs have little effect on the 
activity  of  α1-adrenergic,  muscarinic  cholinergic  or  hista-
minergic  receptors,  thus  showing  better  tolerability  than 
clomipramine. 

  Venlafaxine short-term treatment of OCD showed similar 
efficacy  to  clomipramine,  although  with  a  more  favorable 
safety profile [87]. Most studies have shown efficacy in both 
naïve and  treatment-resistant OCD patients at daily dosages 
between  150  mg/day  and  375  mg/day  with  satisfactory  re-
sponse  rates  (30-60%)  [88-92].  OCD  treatment  with  300 
mg/day  venlafaxine  compared  to  60  mg/day  paroxetine 
showed  similar  response  rates,  although  paroxetine  may  be 
more  effective  than  venlafaxine  in  refractory  patients  [93]. 
Duloxetine  has  shown  some  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of 
OCD,  although  most  evidence  comes  from  case  reports  or 
studies with small samples [94-96]. 

Some  preliminary  reports  focused  on  OCD  treatment 
with  milnacipran,  which  has  a  recognized  efficacy  in  fi-
bromyalgia  and  major  depression  [97].  Milnacipran  is  used 
much  in  France,  Canada  and  Japan,  but  its  usefulness  in 
OCD needs further examination.

3.1.4. Other Antidepressants 

  Agomelatine  5-HT2C  antagonism  could  mediate  anx-
iolytic  effects,  and  melatonin  modulation  (MT1  and  MT2 
receptors  antagonism)  could  contribute  to  circadian  rhythm 
restoration  in  OCD  patients  [98].  It  has  been  tested  both  in 
substitution  [99]  and  in  addition  [100]  to  standard  SSRI 
treatment, and to clomipramine [101]. Other antidepressants 
showed  little  or  no  effects  in  OCD.  A  double-blind  discon-
tinuation study showed for mirtazapine a significantly better 
effect of the drug with respect to placebo on Y-BOCS scores 
[102].  Another  double-blind  study  showed  poor  improve-
ment  of  obsessive-compulsive  symptoms  with  trazodone 
[103].  Many  antidepressants  were  reported  to  be  useful 
mainly  as  add-ons  on  established  pharmacotherapy  in  the 
attempt to overcome treatment-resistance in case reports, but 
none showed efficacy in double-blind studies. 

3.1.5. Antidepressants in Refractory OCD 

  A management strategy for treatment-resistant OCD may 
consist  of  adding  SSRIs  to  other  drugs  that  further  enhance 
serotoninergic  transmission  [104].  Some  open  studies  sug-
gested  that  the  combined  treatment  with  clomipramine  and 
an SSRI is effective and well tolerated. Positive results have 
been  reported  with  the  addition  of  citalopram  to  clomi-
pramine  in  the  long  term  [58].  Encouraging  data  were  also 
reported with the combination of clomipramine with fluoxet-
ine  or  sertraline  [54].  In  any  case,  add-on  treatment  on 
clomipramine requires careful clinical monitoring [81]. 

Intravenous  antidepressant  administration, 

including 
clomipramine  and  citalopram,  was  associated  with  faster 
response, but eventually, with continued treatment, the result 
is  similar  to  oral  administration  [105,  106].  Intravenous  vs. 
oral  clomipramine  was  more  effective  in  two  double-blind 
placebo-controlled  studies  [107,  108].  Treatment  with  high 
doses  of  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  is  another  strategy  to 
consider, including 250-400 mg/day sertraline [78], and 30-
50  mg/day  escitalopram  [109,  110].  There  is  no  evidence 
that  switching  from  one  first-line  drug  to  another  can  pro-
duce  benefits.  Lower  response  rates  were  reported  after 
switching from one SSRI to another, as compared to the shift 
from  an  SSRI  to  clomipramine  [76].  Summarizing  the  evi-
dence, it appears that the last resort could be clomipramine. 

4. ADD-ON ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS 

  About  40-60%  of  OCD  patients  do  not  satisfactorily  re-
spond  to  monotherapy  with  serotonergic  drugs  [111],  con-
sidering  for  response  a  reduction  of  at  least  25-35%  of  the 
values  of  the  Y-BOCS  [51].  The  main  lines  of  research  on 
refractory  OCD  have  focused  on  the  study  of  psychotropic 
drugs  as  add-ons.  The  cortico-striatal  OCD  working  model 
speculates on the existence of an imbalance of the direct vs. 
indirect pathway, with subsequent circuitry hyperactivations 
that  may  relate  to  OCD-related  repetitive  behaviors  [112]. 
The  amygdalocentric  model  hypothesises  malfunctioning  in 
the  physiological  top-down  inhibition  of  the  amygdala  in 
OCD  patients,  which  may  relate  to  the  more  intrusive 
thoughts  and  chronic  anxiety.  Dysfunctional  top-down  inhi-
bition of the amygdala may be  affected by modifications of 
the  mesolimbic  dopaminergic  system;  increased  dopamine 
adversely  affects  the  ability  of  the  prefrontal  cortex  to  sup-

press anxiety-related activation of the amygdala [112]. Based 
on  the  hypotheses  of  dopaminergic  hyperactivation  in  the 
etiology of the OCD, an important strategy is the use of an-
tipsychotic drugs in add-ons to SSRIs. 

4.1. Nosological Issues 

From a clinical viewpoint, antipsychotics should be pref-
erentially used for comorbid psychotic symptoms, which are 
not  rare  in  OCD  [113].  The  overlap  of  symptoms  between 
schizophrenia  and  OCD  relates  to  difficulties  in  differential 
diagnosis  and  therapeutic  management  and  constitutes  an 
important research line of psychopathology since  the begin-
ning  of  modern  psychiatry.  “Folie  raisonnante”,  “folie  lu-
cide”, “folie avec conscience" already identified in the nine-
teenth century those clinical pictures between delusions and 
obsessions,  in  which  ideas  are  egosyntonic  and  reality  per-
ception is preserved, and in which the diagnostic definition is 
borderline  between  neurosis  and  psychosis.  Over  time,  in-
creasing  evidence  indicated  the  existence  of  dynamic  rela-
tionships  between  obsessive  and  psychotic  symptoms,  with 
the  use  of  several  terms,  such  as  “obsessive  psychosis”, 
“OCD with prevalent ideas”, “OCD with psychotic aspects”. 
Recently,  the  definition  “OCD  with  poor  insight”  distin-
guishes  an  “atypical”  subtype  of  OCD,  which  relates  to 
worse  outcome.  It  is  characterized  by  the  coexistence  of 
compulsive obsessions  and rituals with psychotic  symptoms 
or by obsessions (considered realistic and reasonable by pa-
tients) that can be comparable to delusions or hallucinations 
[114, 115]. Conversely, prevalence of obsessive-compulsive 
symptoms/OCD is high in patients with schizophrenia [116]. 
According  to  a  psychodynamic  interpretation,  obsessive-
compulsive rituals  could protect patients with schizophrenia 
from  psychotic  breakdown.  The  neuropathophysiology  of 
these  disorders  involves  the  dopaminergic  and  serotonergic 
neurotransmitter  systems,  which  are  mutually  interacting 
[117]. 

  Overall, the manifestation of psychotic symptoms affects 
1-12%  of  patients  with  OCD  [118-121].  This  subgroup  has 
an earlier onset, a greater impairment of functioning at work, 
more  severe  depressive  symptoms  and  a  more  frequent 
chronic  course.  It  is  also  correlated  to  specific  basic  symp-
toms  (mainly  cognitive,  thought  and  perception  disorders) 
and schizotypal personality disorder [122-124]. Ganesan et al. 
[125]  suggested  that  the  manifestation  of  psychotic  symp-
toms in OCD is an unfavorable prognostic factor, predicting 
worse  illness  course  and  poor  response  to  standard  treat-
ments (both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic). 

4.2. Guidelines 

  A  short  duration  of  SSRI  therapy  could  be  a  source  of 
bias because some patients may respond to these drugs more 
slowly than others. Hence, SSRIs should be administered for 
an  adequate  time  before  a  treatment  change.  The  American 
Psychiatric Association guidelines recommend a period of at 
least 8-12 weeks of SSRI treatment (with at least 4-6 weeks 
at the maximum tolerable dose) before considering a change 
in drug strategy [126]. Accordingly, in cases of partial initial 
treatment response, the addition of antipsychotics should be 
preferred  over  the  switch  to  a  different  SSRI,  which  should 
be conducted only in case of non-response [126]. The World

-olanzapine  or 

-risperidone 

  To  date,  the  addition  of  antipsychotics  to  standard  sero-
tonin enhancers is one of the most documented strategies for 
treatment-resistant  OCD.  The  prevalence  of  antipsychotic 
prescriptions in OCD patients  is  currently high and  increas-
ing  [128].  However,  no  antipsychotic  agent  is  officially  ap-
proved for the treatment of OCD. The use of add-on antipsy-
chotics  to  SSRIs  in  OCD  with  comorbid  Body  Dysmorphic 
Disorder needs further study [129]. 

4.3. Use of Add-on Antipsychotics in OCD 

  Albert  et  al.  [130,  131],  comparing  the  efficacy  of  vari-
ous antipsychotics in different mental disorders, found a sig-
nificant role of prolonged-release quetiapine, risperidone and 
aripiprazole  as  possible  adjuvant  alternatives  in  treatment-
resistant OCD. 

  Consistent  evidence  of  efficacy  in  resistant  OCD  is  re-
lated  to  risperidone.  Komossa  et  al.  [132],  comparing  11 
RCTs that examined the efficacy of the add-on strategy with 
SGA  versus  placebo  in  about  400  cases  of  refractory  OCD, 
indicated  risperidone  as  the  most  promising  augmenting 
agent. Quetiapine did not appear to improve the response to 
antidepressant treatment but was statistically superior to pla-
cebo in reducing the mean Y-BOCS score and showed posi-
tive  effects  on  anxiety  and  depressive  symptoms.  The  least 
advantageous option was the add-on with olanzapine, which 
showed  less  efficacy  and  tolerability,  especially  in  terms  of 
weight gain, although the data were too limited to draw defi-
nite  conclusions  [132].  Similar  conclusions  emerged  from 
another meta-analysis [133], which examined 12 other RCTs 
evaluating  add-on  strategies  with  quetiapine,  risperidone, 
olanzapine,  aripiprazole  and  haloperidol  in  394  treatment-
resistant  OCD  patients.  Overall,  about  a  third  of  patients 
were benefiting from the augmentation strategy with average 
antipsychotic doses; risperidone was confirmed as a potential 
first  choice,  both  for  response  rates  and  for  total  Y-BOCS 
score drop. Li et al. [134] compared the treatments with add-
on  risperidone  (1  mg/day)  and  haloperidol  (2  mg/day)  in  a 
crossover  study.  Both  drugs  were  significantly  effective  on 
obsessive  symptomatology,  but  only  haloperidol  signifi-
cantly  reduced  the  total  Y-BOCS  score.  Placebo-controlled 
studies showed add-on risperidone to reduce more than 20% 
Y-BOCS  scores  [104,  135,  136],  while  other  studies  con-
firmed  reduction  of  Y-BOCS,  although  to  a  lesser  degree 
[137,  138].  On  the  other  hand,  risperidone  induced  signifi-
cant improvements in depressive symptoms and was signifi-
cantly  more  tolerable  than  haloperidol  [139].  Maina  et  al. 
[140]  compared  risperidone  and  olanzapine  as  add-on  to  a 
SSRI, demonstrating a significant improvement in obsessive-
compulsive  symptomatology with  each strategy. Selvi et al. 
[141]  showed  the  superiority  of  add-on  risperidone  (3 
mg/day)  compared  to  aripiprazole  (15  mg/day).  A  very  low 
dose  of  risperidone  (0.5  mg/day)  added  on  standard  SSRI 
treatment showed a greater effect size than a moderate dose 
[137], but placebo-controlled studies showed a greater effect 
of higher doses (2-3 mg/day) [104, 135, 136]. 

  The  literature  is  not  consistent  regarding  the  usefulness 
of  adding  quetiapine  to  a  SSRI  for  the  treatment  of  OCD. 
Vulink et al. [142] examined the effect of the combination of 
quetiapine  with  citalopram  in  patients  with  non-refractory 
OCD,  showing  a  significantly  higher  efficacy  of  quetiapine 
compared  to  placebo.  All  but  one  [143]  placebo-controlled 
studies  of  50-500  mg/day  add-on  quetiapine  on  SSRIs 
showed  a  greater  than  20%  reduction  of  Y-BOCS  scores  of 
treatment-refractory  OCD  patients  [139,  144-147].  Signifi-
cant efficacy was not demonstrated for olanzapine and queti-
apine in a first meta-analysis [133], but subsequently shown 
by a second one by the same group [148]. Still another meta-
analysis [149] did not show  efficacy for quetiapine or olan-
zapine  compared  to  placebo.  Other  studies  showed  remark-
able  response  rates  in  treatment-resistant  OCD  with  add-on 
antipsychotic  treatment.  Haloperidol  [150],  quetiapine  [144, 
151],  olanzapine  [152],  and  amisulpiride  [153]  have  shown 
efficacy  in  more  than  40%  of  treated  patients.  After  6 
months of add-on to high-dose SSRIs treatment, ziprasidone 
was  less  effective  than  quetiapine  in  patients  with  resistant 
OCD (44.4% vs. 80% clinical response) [139]. 

  Add-on  aripiprazole  to  SSRIs  has  shown  encouraging 
results  in  the  treatment  of  resistant  OCD.  The  efficacy  of 
aripiprazole  has  been  also  observed  for  the  treatment  of 
compulsive  obsessive  symptoms  in  patients  with  bipolar 
disorder  [154],  schizophrenia  [155],  or  children  with  Tic 
disorders  [156].  Its  therapeutic  role  in  refractory  OCD  was 
initially  evaluated  as  monotherapy.  Already  the  first  studies 
showed  greater  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  in  augmentation  to 
antidepressant  drugs  rather  than  in  monotherapy  [157-163]. 
A  recent  meta-analysis  showed  that  10  mg/day  aripiprazole 
was  the  most  effective  short-term  option  with  an  important 
overall  effect  size  [149].  Risperidone  also  showed  a  small 
effect  size  in  the  short  term  in  this  study.  Treatment  with 
aripiprazole  at  a  dose  of  5-20  mg/day  added  on  to  paroxet-
ine,  fluvoxamine  or  clomipramine  showed  high  response 
rates  [164].  Aripiprazole  was  also  well  tolerated  and  the 
most  commonly  observed  adverse  reactions  were  akathisia, 
nausea,  vomiting,  and  agitation  [164].  Aripiprazole  in  addi-
tion to SSRIs showed significant improvements in obsessive-
compulsive  symptoms  also  in  the  midterm  (12  months  fol-
low-up) [162, 165]. Confirmations of efficacy and tolerabil-
ity  of  low  doses  of  add-on  aripiprazole  (10  mg/day)  in  se-
vere,  treatment-resistant  OCD  also  derive  from  other  two 
randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  trials  [166, 
167]. Compared to other antipsychotics, aripiprazole showed 
a lower risk of weight gain, sedation, and prolactin increase 
[168]. Long-term follow-up studies  are needed to  assess the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  aripiprazole  added  on  to  SSRIs  in 
treatment-resistant OCD. 

  Overall,  antipsychotics  as  augmenting  agents  compared 
to placebo showed a statistical superiority in terms of clinical 
improvement.  Haloperidol,  risperidone  and  aripiprazole 
showed  more  consistent  positive  effects  on  refractory  OCD 
as  add-ons.  For  other  antipsychotics,  like  quetiapine,  olan-
zapine, and paliperidone the evidence is less compelling, and 
some  studies  showed  they  did  not  significantly  differ  from 
placebo  [138,  148,  167,  169].  In  summary,  the  most  recent 
studies suggested  that risperidone  and aripiprazole  might be 

716    Current Neuropharmacology, 2019, Vol. 17, No. 8 

Del Casale et al. 

used  as  add-on  agents  to  SSRIs/CBT  in  resistant  OCD  
patients. 

4.4.  Clozapine 
compulsive Syndrome (OCS) 

and  Clozapine-related  Obsessive-

  Clozapine is not recommended for OCD due to poor evi-
dence of efficacy [170]. In addition, several case reports and 
clinical  studies  support  the  association  of  clozapine  with 
worsening  or  onset  of  obsessive-compulsive  symptoms  in 
patients with a psychotic disorder [171-176]. At least 20% of 
individuals treated with clozapine (and other antiserotonergic 
antipsychotics) would experience worsening or emergence of 
obsessive-compulsive  symptoms  [177],  which  are  dose-
related  [178]  and  generally  reversible  upon  discontinuation 
of clozapine treatment and switch to a different antipsychotic 
[179]. The mechanism by which clozapine and other second-
generation  antipsychotics  (SGAs)  can  induce  or  worsen  ob-
sessive-compulsive  symptoms  is  unclear  and  probably  re-
lated  to  5-HT2A  receptor  blockade  in  areas  known  to  be  in-
volved  in  the  neuropathophysiology  of  OCD,  such  as  the 
anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal posterior prefrontal cor-
tex  and  the  orbitofrontal  cortex  [180-182].  Supporting  the 
antiserotonergic  hypothesis,  there  is  evidence  that  first-
generation  antipsychotics  (FGAs),  which  mainly  have  do-
paminergic  actions,  are  not  implicated  in  iatrogenic  OCS 
[183]. Patients exposed to a potent dopamine antagonist before 
clozapine  would  be  more  susceptible  to  the  development  of 
clozapine-induced OCS, pointing to hypersensitisation. The use 
of clozapine following the upregulation of striatal D2 receptors 
induced by chronic FGA exposure would result in a reduction 
of  the  dopaminergic  block  with  consequent  OCS.  Finally, 
polymorphisms of various genes (i.e., SLC1A1, GRIN2B and 
GRIK2) may be related to clozapine-induced OCS [184]. 

  OCS  induced  by  clozapine  should  not  be  confused  with 
worsening  of  psychosis;  in  fact,  one  would  be  prompted  to 
increase  dosages  to  obtain  proper  antipsychotics  that  could 
be  associated  with  further  symptom  worsening.  Clozapine-
related  OCS  should  not  lead  to  clozapine  withdrawal  when 
primary  psychotic  symptomatology  has  clearly  benefitted. 
Therapeutic options for clozapine-induced OCS include dos-
age  reduction  [185],  introduction  of  a  serotonin  enhancer 
[186], or aripiprazole [187], which could be effective due to 
its  partial  5-HT1A  agonism,  cautiously  considering  potential 
pharmacokinetic  interactions.  The  possible  introduction  of 
fluoxetine, paroxetine or clomipramine deserves caution due 
to  the  mild-to-moderate  inhibition  of  clozapine  metabolism 
by  these  drugs  [188,  189].  Fluvoxamine  should  be  avoided, 
as  it  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  clozapine  metabolism  and  may 
cause toxicity [190]. Some case reports described other  clo-
zapine-induced  OCS  management  modalities,  including  the 
introduction of valproic acid and the use of electroconvulsive 
therapy [191, 192]. 

4.5. Pharmacodynamics 

  The mechanism of action of SGAs is the combination of 
D2  and  5-HT2A  antagonism.  To  date,  it  is  not  clear  which 
receptor,  in  addition  to  the  serotonin  uptake  inhibition  re-
lated to SSRI treatment, is at the heart of the therapeutic ef-
fects in resistant OCD. Haloperidol has slightly more affinity 
for  D2  receptors  than  olanzapine  and  risperidone  and  much 

more  than  quetiapine.  Since  response  rates  to  haloperidol 
and risperidone were found to be higher than those of queti-
apine  and  olanzapine  in  meta-analytical  studies,  it  can  be 
assumed  that  besides  antidopaminergic  activity,  there  must 
be  other  mechanisms  supporting  the  anti-psychotic  efficacy 
of the former drugs in treatment-resistant OCD. The antido-
paminergic  hypothesis  is  supported  by  an  open-label  aug-
mentation study with 200-600 mg/day amisulpiride, a selec-
tive  and  potent  blocker  of  the  D2  and  D3  receptors,  which 
showed  promising  results  [153].  Since  amisulpiride,  like 
other  substituted  benzoamides,  is  highly  specific  for  dopa-
mine receptors, this would seem to confirm the involvement 
of D2 antagonism in the therapeutic action in resistant OCD. 
However, the study was not double blind, so the efficacy of 
amisulpiride in this condition remains undetermined. 

  According  to positron emission tomography (PET)  stud-
ies, low doses of atypical antipsychotics induced high levels 
of  5-HT2A/C  antagonism,  while  relatively  higher  doses  are 
necessary  to  determine  significant  blockade  of  D2  receptors 
[193].  However,  SGAs  were  effective  augmentation  agents 
in  treatment-resistant  OCD  at  medium  doses,  lower  than 
those currently recommended for the  treatment of psychotic 
disorders, similarly to what occurs in the treatment of major 
depression.  Both  haloperidol  (strong  D2  and  moderate  5-
HT2A  receptor  blocker)  and  aripiprazole  (the  most  peculiar 
among SGAs in terms of effects on D2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 
5-HT2C  receptors)  proved  to  be  useful  in  refractory  OCD. 
This could indicate that antipsychotic augmentation in OCD 
treatment mainly relies on the modulation of the interplay of 
serotonergic  and  dopaminergic  transmissions  [149].  Fur-
thermore,  since  low  doses  of  antipsychotics  primarily  an-
tagonize the presynaptic dopamine autoreceptor, this mecha-
nism  is  more  likely  to  increase  or  modulate  rather  than  an-
tagonize  dopaminergic  transmission.  The  promising  results 
of  aripiprazole  added  on  SSRI  treatment  may  relate  to  its 
peculiar  partial  agonism  of  D2  and  5-HT1A  receptors  and 
antagonism of 5-HT2A/2C receptors. 

4.6. Limitations 

  Different  studies  produced  inconsistent  results  and  were 
limited  by  small  samples  of  treatment-resistant  OCD  pa-
tients,  multiplicity  of  study  designs,  inconsistent  definitions 
of  treatment  resistance,  lack  of  homogeneity  in  the  adopted 
response criteria, and heterogeneity of the clinical pictures of 
included  OCD  patients.  Some  symptom  subsets  may  differ-
ently respond to a specific treatment, even if symptoms over-
lap  and  vary  in  severity.  To  date,  there  is  no  genotype  or 
phenotype  identified  as  a  predictor  of  add-on  antipsychotic 
treatment  efficacy  in  resistant  OCD.  A  further  limitation  is 
the  variability  of  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  regarding 
comorbidities particularly tic disorders. Tourette and tic dis-
orders  tend  to  co-occur  with  OCD  and  are  usually  treated 
with  antipsychotic  drugs;  it  should  be  considered  that  OCD 
patients with  comorbid  tic disorder benefit more from  addi-
tional  antipsychotic  drugs  than  patients  with  OCD  without 
tic disorders [194]. 

4.7. Future Directions 

  There is a lack of studies focusing on high-dose antipsy-
chotics  in  refractory  OCD,  and  we  cannot  exclude  that  this 

Psychopharmacological Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2019, Vol. 17, No. 8    717 

strategy  may  increase  the  proportion  of  responders.  Further 
studies  are  needed  addressing  these  issues  to  allow  for  the 
optimization  of  treatment  recommendations  for  refractory 
OCD. Considering the possibly low overall response to SSRI 
monotherapy,  early  co-administration  of  antipsychotics  is  a 
commonly  recommended  strategy  for  treatment-resistant 
OCD. There is still no precise guideline about antipsychotic 
choice,  neither  on  optimal  dosing,  nor  on  appropriate  treat-
ment duration or long-term safety of increasing antipsychotic 
doses.  Further  investigations  are  needed  to  clarify  the  effi-
cacy and safety of each antipsychotic drug and establish pos-
sible differences. There are no studies with a very long-term 
follow-up  investigating  the  outcome  or  adverse  events  of 
add-on  antipsychotics.  Although  benefits  have  been  found, 
especially  for  aripiprazole  and  risperidone,  potential  long-
term risks are not known. After one year of treatment, queti-
apine, risperidone and olanzapine added on CBT and SSRIs 
in  non-responder  patients  were  associated  with  symptom 
improvement,  but  also  with  increases  in  body  mass  index 
(over  10%)  and  fasting  blood  glucose  levels  in  more  than 
half of treated patients [195]. The potential benefits of antip-
sychotic  medications  should  be  carefully  balanced  against 
the risk of side effects. Should a patient with standard treat-
ment-resistance  be  judged  to  respond  to  a  4-week  add-on 
antipsychotic, he/she should be advised to regularly monitor 
weight,  blood  glucose,  and  blood  lipid  profile;  the  clinician 
should  monitor  the  patient  for  possible  long-term  adverse 
effects. 

  Alternative strategies to antipsychotic augmentation may 
be more  efficacious  and safer  in the long run. For  example, 
CBT showed more efficacy and less side effects than risperi-
done  or  placebo  [138],  which  prompted  the  investigators  to 
provide  non-pharmacological  treatment  first,  thus  defining 
treatment-resistant  patients  as  those  who  also  had  evidence 
of a failed CBT course. However, this study is flawed by the 
fact that there is no such a thing as a blind sham psychother-
apy administration, so conclusions should be avoided. Inves-
tigators  should  be  prompted  to  speak  about  drug-resistance 
when only drugs have been tried and of treatment resistance 
when  all  possible  treatments  have  failed,  otherwise  they 
should  define 
as  SSRI-,  psychotherapy 
(CBT/ERP)-  or  somatic  (TMS,  DBS,  ECT,  or  psychosur-
gery)-treatment–resistance (i.e., they should be more specific 
in their definition of a resistant/refractory patient in the titles 
of  the  articles  they  publish).  Some  evidence  supported  the 
add-on of clomipramine  to a SSRI before trying an antipsy-
chotic  add-on  treatment.  The  addition  of  clomipramine  (25-
75  mg/day)  to  fluoxetine  showed  more  effectiveness  than 
add-on  quetiapine  [196];  also,  the  use  of  add-on  clomi-
pramine  to  citalopram  was  superior  to  citalopram  alone 
[197].  In  such  cases,  a  combination  with  clomipramine  re-
quires ECG monitoring [197], but this is just one of the pre-
cautions that should be taken, as this type of practice exposes 
the patient to the risk of a serotonin syndrome [198, 199]. 

resistance 

  To date, more data  are needed to predict  the response  to 
SGAs  in  add-on  to  standard  treatment.  Further  studies  are 
needed  to  identify  subgroups  of  patients  that  could  benefit 
from  this  treatment  option  [200].  Further  evidence  showed 
that  reducing  the  dose  of  SSRI  after  the  introduction  of  an 
antipsychotic does not  improve response to  treatment [196]. 

Taking  into  account  the  chemical  and  pharmacodynamic 
heterogeneity of the SSRIs as a class, further studies should 
evaluate which of them is the most suitable for antipsychotic 
augmentation in refractory OCD. 

5.  OTHER  ADD-ON  PHARMACOLOGICAL  TREAT- 
MENTS 

5.1. Antiepileptics 

  Considering  the  significant  proportion  of  drug-resistant 
OCD  patients,  further  treatment  strategies  have  been  at-
tempted,  including  augmentation  with  antiepileptic  drugs. 
Overactivation of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuit, 
in which a role could be played by glutamate, is apparently 
involved in OCD, justifying the assumption that antiepileptic 
medications  antagonizing  glutamatergic  activity  could  re-
duce OCD symptoms [181, 182, 201]. 

  Add-on  topiramate  at  daily  dose  ranges  up  to  400  mg 
improved  refractory  OCD  [201-204].  One  study  reported  a 
positive  effect  of  225-675  mg/day  pregabalin  augmentation 
in  10  partial  responder/resistant  OCD  patients  to  combined 
SSRI/SGA treatment [205]. 

  Lamotrigine at 150 mg/day added on 225 mg/day clomi-
pramine [206] in a case and at 100-200 mg/day added to the 
same clomipramine dose or  to 60 mg/day paroxetine in  two 
cases  [207]  obtained  improvement;  this  was  further  con-
firmed in two placebo-controlled studies, both showing effi-
cacy vs. placebo of 100 mg/day lamotrigine added on SSRIs 
in refractory OCD [208, 209]. The addition of gabapentin to 
fluoxetine reduced time to treatment response [210]. Deltito 
[211] (1994) reported that 8 of 10 patients who did not toler-
ate  standard  antiobsessional  treatment,  who  were  pretreated 
with valproate, responded to subsequent reintroduction of the 
antiobsessional with a reduction of OCD symptoms. Another 
report, in which one patient has been treated similarly; clini-
cians  gradually  tapered-off  clomipramine  and  continued  on 
valproate monotherapy, obtaining further reduction of obses-
sive-compulsive  symptoms  [212].  These  finding  have  not 
been replicated to date. 

5.2. Ondansetron 

  Ondansetron  is  a  5-HT3  serotonin  receptor  antagonist 
used  primarily  to  reduce  nausea  and  vomiting  associated 
with  chemotherapy,  radiotherapy,  post-surgery,  and  preg-
nancy.  Since  5-HT3  blockade  produces  a  weak  inhibitory 
effect  on  dopaminergic  neurotransmission  [213],  ondanse-
tron has been tested in the treatment of schizophrenia [214], 
Tourette's disorder [215] tardive dyskinesia [216], alcoholism 
[217]  (Johnson  et  al.,  2011),  and  OCD  [218].  Both  uncon-
trolled  and placebo-controlled studies showed  that ondanse-
tron was safe and effective  in treating refractory OCD, both 
in  monotherapy  and  added  on  SSRIs.  In  a  pilot,  8-week, 
open-label  trial,  oral  ondansetron  monotherapy  (3  mg/day) 
resulted in 29-55% reduction of Y-BOCS scores from base-
line  and  to  45%  worsening  2  weeks  after  suspension  [219]. 
Fourteen patients with refractory OCD received ondansetron 
(0.5-1  mg/day)  added  on  SSRIs  and  SGAs  for  12  weeks, 
showing decrease of at least 23% of the Y-BOCS scores and 
some  minor adverse  events [220]. Twenty-one patients who 

718    Current Neuropharmacology, 2019, Vol. 17, No. 8 

Del Casale et al. 

did not respond adequately to a SSRI, received 12 weeks of 
0.5-1  mg/day  add-on  ondansetron,  obtaining  a  27.2%  aver-
age reduction of Y-BOCS (57% response rate). Four weeks 
after ondansetron discontinuation, Y-BOCS scores increased 
by 15.5% on the average  in the entire sample  and 38.3%  in 
the  responder  sub-sample.  No  clinically  significant  side  ef-
fects emerged [221]. 

  Two  RCTs  investigated  moderate-high  (4-8  mg/day) 
doses ondansetron combination with SSRIs. In the first study 
[222],  42  patients  with  refractory  OCD  randomly  received 
ondansetron  4  mg/day  or  placebo  in  addition  to  fluoxetine 
for  8  weeks,  showing  significant  greater  decrease  of  Y-
BOCS  scores  with  ondansetron  compared  to  placebo.  Hei-
dari et al. [223] randomized 46 adults with severe refractory 
OCD  to  receive  8  mg/day  ondansetron  or  placebo  for  8 
weeks  in  addition  to  100-200  mg/day  fluvoxamine.  After  8 
weeks of treatment the mean Y-BOCS scores dropped to 15 
in the ondansetron group and to 21 in the placebo group; the 
Y-BOCS  improvements  that  followed  ondansetron  vs.  pla-
cebo  were  significant  for  obsessions,  compulsions,  and 
global  symptoms.  The  efficacy  of  ondansetron  in  treating 
refractory  OCD  was  superior  in  RCTs  than  in  uncontrolled 
studies  [220,  221].  Reported  adverse  events  were  very  few 
and comparable between ondansetron and placebo. However, 
patients  of  uncontrolled  studies  had  history  of  drug  resis-
tance,  while  RCTs  did  not  report  history  of  drug  resistance 
and their patients were not taking medications in the six pre-
vious  weeks,  in  spite  of  OCD  severity.  Moreover,  ondanse-
tron was given at higher doses in RCTs [222, 223] vs. uncon-
trolled  studies  [220,  221].  Ondansetron  (1-8  mg/day)  is  a 
potential  augmenting  agent  in  patients  for  whom  SGAs  are 
problematic [224]. However, further studies are necessary to 
confirm these acquisitions, to establish long-term efficacy and 
safety, and to identify appropriate dosing and treatment duration. 

5.3. Buprenorphine 

  The  evidence  for  the  use  of  buprenorphine  and  other 
opioids  in  the  treatment  of  severe  and  refractory  OCD  is 
weak  [225-229].  The  mechanism  underlying  the  therapeutic 
action  of  opiates  in  OCD  is  still  debated.  Buprenorphine, 
through  partial  agonism  of  the  µ-opioid  receptor,  promotes 
the release of serotonin and dopamine in the central nervous 
system  [230,  231].  Conversely,  naloxone,  i.e.  a  pure  opioid 
antagonist with affinity for all three types of opioid receptors 
(µ, δ, κ) has been shown to rapidly worsen OCD symptoms 
[232, 233]. 

  Buprenorphine  400-600  µg/day  added  on  SSRIs  (200 
mg/day  fluvoxamine  or  200  mg/day  sertraline)  or  150 
mg/day clomipramine correlated with improvement of symp-
toms in severe refractory OCD. Buprenorphine was adminis-
tered  at  lower  doses  than  those  used  to  treat  chronic  pain, 
i.e., started at 200 µg/day, with the dosage doubled after one 
week,  and  further  200  µg/day  increases  based  on  clinical 
response  [229].  Opioid  treatment  was  not  associated  with 
significant side effects (cyclizine was prescribed in the initial 
treatment  phase  in  case  of  nausea)  and  improvement  was 
maintained  without  tapering-off.  Patients  that  did  not  re-
spond  to  buprenorphine  augmentation  were  affected  by  se-
vere  OCD,  severe  depression,  and  were  resistant  to  SSRI 
treatments  and  CBT  [229].  Add-on  buprenorphine  to  stan-

dard  OCD  treatment  may  result  in  a  clinically  significant 
improvement  in  a  proportion  of  refractory  patients,  particu-
larly  in  people  who  partially  responded  to  SSRIs.  This  ob-
servation  supports  the  hypothesis  of  a  close  interaction  be-
tween  opioid  and  serotonergic  systems;  however,  further 
trials  are  needed  to  better  understand  the  role  of  the  opioid 
system in OCD and related disorders. 

5.4. D-cycloserine 

  An  emerging  therapeutic  approach  for  patients  with  re-
fractory anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD, is the treatment 
with  D-cycloserine  (DCS)  added  on  CBT.  Originally  de-
signed  as  anti-tuberculosis,  DCS  has  been  tested  in  Alz-
heimer's dementia and in the treatment of negative symptoms 
of  schizophrenia  [234,  235].  DCS  did  not  show  anxiolytic 
properties and is not considered a first-line strategy for anxi-
ety  disorders.  However,  favorable  effects  on  anxious  symp-
tomatology could derive from DCS-related associative learn-
ing enhancement [236]. 

  Animal studies showed DCS to enhance conditioned fear 
extinction learning, a  central mechanism in ERP [237]. Par-
tial agonism at the site of glycine recognition of the glutama-
tergic  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)  glutamate  receptor, 
which  is  linked  in  the  amygdala  to  learning  and  memory, 
could  be  the  basis  of  the  mechanism  of  action  of  DCS. 
NMDA antagonists, on the other hand, would block learning 
of the extinction of fear. Human studies showed the potential 
therapeutic  role  of  DCS  in  anxiety  disorders,  although  the 
effect  size  of  DCS  seemed  to  be  less  than  animal  studies 
[238].  A  meta-analysis  conducted  on  patients  with  OCD, 
PTSD,  and  severe  anxiety  disorders  showed  that  add-on 
DCS improved ERP, facilitating the extinction of fear [239]. 
Of  note,  interactions  of  DCS  with  other  psychotropic  drugs 
require further investigation. 

  A study conducted by Anderson et al. [240] in 128 OCD 
patients who underwent 5 sessions of 12-week guided expo-
sure  and  were  on  stable  antidepressant  therapy,  suggested 
that DCS added on CBT could be a promising strategy only 
in  patients  who  were  not  receiving  antidepressants.  Long-
term  administration  of  different  classes  of  antidepressants, 
including imipramine and citalopram, alters NMDA receptor 
subunits  and  DCS  regulation  of  the  glycine  binding  site, 
blocking  its  facilitatory  effect  on  fear  extinction  [241].  A 
recent  meta-analysis  conducted  on  21  RCTs  [242],  which 
included  1047  subjects  with  a  severe  anxiety  disorder  or 
OCD  or  PTSD  randomized  to  receive  DCS  or  placebo  in 
addition  to  CBT,  showed  add-on  DCS  to  correlate  with 
symptom  improvement  only  from  pre-treatment  to  post-
treatment,  but  not  from  pre-treatment  to  mid-treatment  or 
from  pre-treatment  to  follow-up.  The  CBT  group  also 
showed  lower  severity  of  symptoms  at  the  end  of  treatment 
and at follow-up. In this study, the  concomitant use of anti-
depressants did not moderate the effect of DCS [242]. Other 
RCTs  conducted  on  pure  OCD  samples  showed  that  DCS 
augmentation may lead to a faster response to treatment than 
placebo, although without beneficial effects at the end of the 
treatment or at follow-up [243-247]. 

  To  date,  DCS  has  proven  to  be  a  promising  strategy  for 
strengthening CBT. It could reduce the number of CBT ses-

Psychopharmacological Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2019, Vol. 17, No. 8    719 

sions needed, reduce the exposure-related anxiety, and facili-
tate  adherence  to  treatment,  leading  to  faster  patient  relief 
and  lower  healthcare  costs  [248].  DCS  appears  to  be  effec-
tive  when  administered  1-2  hours  before  or  after  exposure 
(during  the  period  of  consolidation  of  the  memory  that  oc-
curs after exposure rather  than during exposure  itself) [238-
249].  The  possible  efficacy  of  a  small  number  of  DCS  ad-
ministrations  can  be  explained  by  the  progressive  receptor 
desensitization  with  continued  use  of  the  substance  [238]. 
However,  clinical  research  should  be  performed  to  indicate 
adequate  protocols,  treatment  time,  and  DCS  doses  for  re-
fractory OCD. 

  Add-on  DCS  dosage  range  of  50-500  mg/day  did  not 
show significant differences in CBT enhancement [250]. For 
doses  lower  than  500  mg/day,  DCS  was  well  tolerated  and 
no  significant  adverse  effects  were  reported.  DCS  admini-
stration  infrequently  correlated  with  nightmares  the  night 
after  the  CBT  session and euphoric mood with hyperactiva-
tion  in  a  person  with  chronic  depression  [251].  Other  re-
ported unwanted effects were increased anxiety, somnolence, 
xerostomia  [244],  mild  gastrointestinal  disorders,  dizziness, 
tiredness  [243],  and  nausea  during  the  hour  following  DCS 
administration [251]. De Kleine et al. [252] did not find dif-
ferences between DCS and placebo groups regarding adverse 
events. Stable high DCS doses (500-1000 mg/day) were re-
lated  to  headache,  confusion,  tremor,  memory  difficulties, 
paraesthesia  and  seizures  [253].  Furthermore,  DCS  in  ani-
mals  seems  to  induce  tolerance  when  administered  at  high 
and/or chronic doses, probably due  to a paradoxical antago-
nistic effect on NMDA receptor [254], with consequent fear 
extinction  reduction  [255].  In  summary,  due  to  the  minimal 
side effects of low-dose DCS, this drug appears to be a safe 
alternative for improving CBT outcomes [246]. 

  Many aspects need further  investigation,  including  char-
acteristics  of  patients  who  could  potentially  benefit  from 
DCS  in  addition  to  CBT,  considering  that  this  treatment 
could be effective in subtypes of OCD with prevalent cleans-
ing/contamination symptoms [256]. More studies are needed 
to  evaluate  treatment  modalities,  including  the  number  of 
CBT  sessions  to  perform,  treatment  time,  DCS  dosages, 
methods of administration (it is not yet known if DCS can be 
effective if administered only after successful sessions), and 
interactions of DCS with antidepressant treatments. 

5.5. Cannabidiol 

  Activation of the  CB1 cannabinoid receptors  is involved 
in  fear  extinction  and  prevention  of  reconsolidation  of  fear 
[257],  i.e.,  the  negative  feedback  of  the  neuroendocrine 
stress response and the protection from the adverse effects of 
chronic  stress  [258,  259].  As  a  consequence,  CB1  receptor 
agonists, including Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, 
and  synthetic  agents  capable  of  enhancing  CB1  activation, 
such  as  fatty  acid  amide  hydrolase  inhibitors,  are  being 
evaluated as new anti-anxiety treatments [260-262]. Preclini-
cal data showed that cannabidiol could be safe and effective 
in  reducing  fear-  and  anxiety-related  behaviors  in  schizoaf-
fective,  post-traumatic  stress,  anxiety  and  obsessive-
compulsive  disorders  [262,  263].  Further  preclinical  and 
clinical  studies  are  needed  to  assess  the  usefulness  of  drugs 
targeting  the  cannabinoid  system  in  some  psychiatric  disor-

ders.  To  date,  the  use  of  cannabinoids  in  the  treatment  of 
OCD  is  not  recommended,  also  in  consideration  of  the  re-
lated  risk  of  psychosis  [264].  However,  the  use  of  can-
nabidiol-like  molecules  alone  should  not  pose  such  safety 
questions and may constitute a viable strategy for the future, 
not  only  in  OCD,  but  in  anxiety  and  psychotic  disorders  as 
well. 

5.6. Other Medications 

  Different placebo-controlled studies showed some effec-
tiveness in refractory OCD of add-on treatments with mavo-
glurat  [265],  eicosapentaenoic  acid  [266],  celecoxib  [267], 
L-carnosine  [268],  inositol  [269],  the  5-HT3  antagonist 
granisetron [270],  the  µ-opioid agonist  morphine [228], and 
the β-adrenoceptor/5-HT1A antagonist pindolol [271]. 

Promising  results  from  placebo-controlled  studies  con-
cerning  the  efficacy  of  add-on  treatments  with  memantine 
[272-274]  and  N-acetylcysteine  [275-277]  (however,  the 
latter showed some inconsistencies [278]) need replication. 

  Other  placebo-controlled  studies  showed  lack  of  effec-
tiveness  of  add-on  buspirone  [279,  280],  clonazepam  [281], 
glycine  powder  [282],  lithium  [283],  naltrexone  [284],  and 
riluzole [285]. 

6. PERSONALIZED TREATMENT STRATEGIES 

6.1. Treatment Response Prediction 

  Given the significant rate of treatment resistance and the 
significant  disability  in  OCD  patients,  an  improved  knowl-
edge  of  the  predictive  factors  of  drug  treatment  response 
could allow better improvement through the implementation 
of  personalized  therapeutic  regimens.  The  identification  of 
homogeneous subgroups of OCD patients could help finding 
treatment  response  predictors  and  selecting  better  personal-
ized pharmacological treatment options [286]. 

  Autogenic  obsessions  (A-OCD)  are  generally  sexual, 
aggressive  or  immoral,  intrusive,  unrelated  thoughts  and 
impulses with identifiable triggers. These are associated with 
avoidant  control,  magical  rituals,  and  superstitious  behavior 
or through thought-control strategies,  and frequently  associ-
ated with schizotypal personality and disorders of thought or 
perception.  Reactive  obsessions  (R-OCD)  concern  contami-
nation, errors, accidents, symmetry and loss, and can be trig-
gered by specific external stimuli. R-OCD can lead to coping 
behaviors  such  as  trying  to  avoid  or  actually  avoiding  any 
negative  consequences  related  to  the  meaning  of  thought, 
and  are  associated  with  perfectionist  personality  traits  [287, 
288]. A-OCD and R-OCD subtypes showed different neuro-
biological correlates [289, 290]. 

  The  current  literature  on  the  different  therapeutic  ap-
proaches  to  autogenic  or  reactive  obsessions  reports  incon-
sistent  results.  Some  studies  suggested  that  A-OCD  might 
not  respond  to  ERP  and  SSRI  as  well  as  R-OCD  [9,  291, 
292],  others  showed  no  subtype  differences  [34,  55,  293]. 
The augmentation with a SGA showed more  clinically rele-
vant  improvements  in  the  A-OCD  vs.  R-OCD  group  [294]. 
The  increased  symptom  severity  and  frequent  association 
with  schizotypal  personality  traits  could  explain  the  higher 
antipsychotic prescription rate in the A-OCD subtype [288]. 

 
720    Current Neuropharmacology, 2019, Vol. 17, No. 8 

Del Casale et al. 

However, the presence of mixed obsessions is frequent, and 
the  OCD  subtype  may  change  over  time  [9].  Treatment 
strategies may not be adaptable to specific OCD subtypes of 
symptoms,  given  that  many  other  factors  may  influence 
clinical  response  and  outcome,  including  symptom  severity 
[111], age of onset [294],  co-occurrence of schizotypal per-
sonality  disorder  [295],  chronic  tics  [150],  and  depression 
[296]. The debate on the potential role of the OCD subtypes 
in  pharmacological  treatment  strategies  requires  further  and 
more detailed studies. 

  To date, predictors of response to SSRIs include positive 
family  history  [34],  aggressive,  sexual  and  religious  obses-
sions  [31],  and  OFC  hypometabolism  and  right  caudate 
hypermetabolism [32]. On the other hand, a poorer response 
to  SSRI  has  been  related  to  prevalence  of  hoarding  symp-
toms  [33],  lack  of  insight  [34],  severe  concomitant  depres-
sion [292], and higher levels of basic disability [35]. 

  The  most  consistent  predictor  of  add-on  antipsychotic 
response  is  a  comorbid  tic  disorder  [194].  Few  studies  on 
add-on  benzodiazepines,  which  are  commonly  considered 
ineffective [297], and glutamatergic agents [298, 299] cannot 
fully clarify specific predictors of treatment response. 

6.2. Pharmacokinetics Factors 

  CYP2D6  metabolizes  most  of  the  antidepressants,  such 
as  TCAs,  SNRIs  and  most  SSRIs.  CYP2C19  metabolizes 
several  TCAs  and  some  SSRIs,  including  escitalopram  and 
citalopram. Gene polymorphisms of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 
alter the metabolism of drugs, influencing their efficacy and 
the profile of adverse effects. Other CYP450 enzymes (such 
as  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C9  and  CYP3A4)  may  also 
play a role in metabolizing psychoactive drugs. CYP2D6 and 
CYP2C19 polymorphisms could be related to antidepressant 
response  in  OCD  patients  [300-302].  Reduced  CYP2D6 
function has been associated with lack of response, and non-
extensive  CYP2D6  metabolizers,  compared  to  extensive, 
showed a significantly higher number of failed responses  to 
different antidepressant drugs [302]. 

6.3. Pharmacodynamics Factors 

  The  serotonergic  system  is  involved  in  the  pathogenesis 
of  OCD;  in  fact,  SSRIs  are  the  first-line  treatment  of  this 
disorder,  which  is  widely  supported  by  the  literature  [126]. 
Many genes have been found to regulate the expression and 
function  of  serotonin,  including  SLC6A4  and  its  promoter 
HTTLPR, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR1B and TPH [303]. 

  There  is  no  evidence  supporting  the  hypothesis  that  a 
single genetic variation or gene can be related to antidepres-
sant  responses  in  patients  with  OCD.  However,  several  sin-
gle-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  of  candidate  genes 
within  the  neural  aminergic  systems  and  the  CYP450  liver 
system might be  involved with both OCD neuropathophysi-
ology  and  treatment  response  [303].  The  SLC6A4  gene 
(chromosome  17)  encodes  the  serotonin  transporter,  which 
carries on  the reuptake of serotonin [304]. A polymorphism 
in  the  promoter  region  of  SLC6A4  influences  gene  expres-
sion, with the long allele (L) correlating with higher levels of 
serotonin  transporter  expression,  which  is  up  to  three  times  

than those of the short  allele (S) [305].  The variation of the 
activity of this transporter influences the availability of sero-
tonin  in  the  synaptic  cleft,  having  an  impact  on  the  activity 
of postsynaptic receptors. 

  The association of 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms with OCD 
has  been  reported  in  the  literature,  although  somewhat  in-
consistently,  with  some  studies  not  showing  any  significant 
association  and  others  indicating  an  association  of  the  L-
allele  expression  with  OCD  [306].  Higher  diencephalic  ex-
pression  of  the  transporter  prior  to  treatment  may  correlate 
with increased transporter occupation and better response to 
antidepressants  (e.g.,  sertraline)  [307].  HTR2A  gene  poly-
morphisms  may  also  influence  the  response  to  SSRI  treat-
ment [308]. A single nucleotide polymorphism of the COMT 
gene  was  associated  with  response  to  citalopram,  indicating 
that  the  Met/Met  (L/L)  genotype  of  the  COMT  Val158Met 
polymorphism could predict a better response to antidepres-
sant treatment [309]. 

  There  is  increasing  evidence  of  the  role  of  the  glutama-
tergic system in the etiology of many neuropsychiatric disor-
ders,  including  OCD  [310].  In  fact,  altered  glutamatergic 
function  is  seen  as  one  of  the  main  biological  correlates  of 
hyperactivity  of  the  cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical  circuit 
[311]. Drugs interfering with the glutamatergic system (such 
as  phenobarbital, 
topiramate,  riluzole,  N-
acetylcysteine,  memantine,  ketamine,  and  DCS)  have  been 
used  as  potentiating  agents  in  refractory  OCD.  Different 
haplotypes  of  the  SLC1A1  gene,  which  encodes  the  neural 
glutamate transporter, have been associated with OCD [312]. 

lamotrigine, 

  Neurodevelopmental  changes 
in  ventral  prefrontal-
striatal  circuitry  causing  developmentally-mediated  network 
dysplasias  were  advanced  to  account  for  the  onset  of  OCD 
[313].  This  hypothesis  received  support  from  both  neuroi-
maging [314] and genetic studies [315-317]. A study by Qin 
et  al.  [318]  demonstrated  that  the  top  SNP  associated  with 
the  response  to  SSRIs  was  rs17162912  (i.e.,  an  intergene 
variation near  the DISP1 gene), which is involved in neuro-
developmental cell-cell interaction [319]. 

  Briefly,  pharmacogenetics  and  personalised  medicine 
may radically change the clinical practice for treating OCD, 
guiding  physicians  to  indicate  the  best  antidepressant  treat-
ment (and perhaps also alternative augmenting strategies) for 
each patient [303]. The continuous and rapid development of 
genomic  testing  and  related  studies  focused  on  predictive 
factors,  association  studies,  and  pharmacoeconomy  will 
prove  or  disprove  the  validity  of  the  personalised  approach 
in  mental  health.  An  important  question  regarding  timing 
(i.e., when a psychiatrist should indicate a pharmacogenomic 
test) is still unclear [320]. 

  Although  no  published  studies  to  date  examined  this  is-
sue  in  OCD,  pharmacogenomics  in  psychiatry  can  lead  to 
improvement  in  patients’  adherence  to  treatment,  decreases 
in  healthcare  costs  [321],  and  better  response  to  antidepres-
sants  in  major  depression  [322].  Because  of  the  lack  of 
pharmacogenomic  studies  in  OCD,  we  hypothesise  that  this 
method could at least be considered when a patient is refrac-
tory to the switch to a second SSRI, clomipramine, or SSRI/ 
clomipramine with add-on atypical antipsychotics (Fig. 2).

6.4. OCD Treatment During Pregnancy 

  OCD  is  relatively  common  during  the  perinatal  period. 
Pregnancy and postpartum are associated with higher risk of 
OCD onset [323] or recurrence, although some patients pre-
sent  symptom  improvement  [324-326].  Data  on  the  safety 
and efficacy of OCD treatment during pregnancy are limited 
and  mainly  derive  from  retrospective  studies.  Furthermore, 
safety data of drug treatment during pregnancy mainly come 
from studies focused on other psychiatric disorders, and it is 
not  certain  that  drug  safety  does  not  vary  according  to  the 
specific disorder. Few data exist about the effects of untreated 
OCD during pregnancy on fetal and child development. 

Stress  and  anxiety  during  pregnancy  correlate  with  in-
creased resistance to placental blood flow, preterm birth, low 
gestational  age,  and  increased  risk  of  placental  detachment; 
sleep  and  eating  disorders,  ADHD  and  cognitive-behavioral 
and  emotional  problems  may  occur  in  the  child  [327-331]. 
Newborns  of  women  with  OCD  showed  significantly  lower 
birth  weight  compared  to  controls  and  higher  levels  of  the 
proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) 
[332]. These findings suggest that maternal OCD can poten-
tially  influence  future  child  neurodevelopment;  however, 
conclusions  cannot  be  drawn  due  to  the  lack  of  studies  in 
literature on this topic. 

Factors  to  be  considered  in  treatment  strategy  decisions 
are  family  psychiatric  history,  previous  adverse  reactions  to 
drug  treatment,  risks  related  to  untreated  maternal  OCD, 
safety  and  effectiveness  of  drugs  during  pregnancy,  the 
availability  of  non-pharmacological  treatments  [333],  OCD 
severity,  and  related  reduced  global  functioning  [334]. 
Pharmacological  treatment  should  be  indicated  in  cases  of 
severe  depression  and  anxiety,  elevated  risk  of  suicide, 
OCD-related  sleep  and  eating  disorders,  and  unresponsive-
ness to CBT [335]. 

SSRIs  are  the  first-line  drugs  also  in  OCD  during  preg-
nancy [333, 336], given the absence of related teratogenesis 
[333,  337-342].  Sertraline,  citalopram  and  escitalopram  ap-
pear  to  be  the  most  favorable  in  the  perinatal  period  [341], 
considering  their  effectiveness  in  OCD  and  the  association 
lack with congenital malformations [333, 343, 344]. 

Pregnancy  safety  data  on  fluvoxamine  are  few,  and  its 
use  during  pregnancy  is  less  frequent  compared  to  other 
SSRIs. Therefore, caution is recommended with regard to the 
use  of  fluvoxamine  [345,  346].  Paroxetine  and  fluoxetine 
correlated  with  an  increased  risk  of  cardiac  malformations 
and "poor neonatal adaptation syndrome" (PNAS) [347]. On 
this  basis,  these  drugs  should  be  used  only  in  case  of  non-
response or intolerance to other SSRIs. 

  Clomipramine  is  another  first-line  agent  for  OCD  treat-
ment  [336]  but  presents  an  unfavorable  safety  profile  in 
pregnancy.  During  this  period,  the  risk  of  cardiovascular 
defects of the future child doubles [348, 349]; this drug is the 
TCA  that  is  most  associated  with  PNAS  [350].  In  addition, 
the risk of maternal intolerance is high. Venlafaxine does not 
seem  to  be  related  to  congenital  malformations,  but  limited 
evidence exists about its effectiveness in OCD, and similarly 
to  SSRIs,  its  use  involves  different  risks,  including  miscar-
riage, premature birth, and PNAS [333, 334, 340, 351]. 

  Generally,  higher  antidepressant  doses  are  used  in  OCD 
than  those  used  in  the  treatment  of  major  depression  [352]. 
For  this  reason,  the  risk  of  pre-term  birth  associated  with 
overdose  of  SSRI  [101,  353]  should  be  taken  into  account, 
and the minimum effective dose should be used [335]. 

  Uguz  et  al.  recently  suggested  a  scheme  of  pharmacol-
ogical  interventions  in  refractory  OCD  during  pregnancy 
[335].  If  clinical  response  to  the  first-line  SSRIs  appears  to 
be only partial, it is recommended to increase the dose, care-
fully  monitoring  both  the  woman  and  future  child.  In  cases 
of unresponsiveness to sertraline, citalopram or escitalopram, 
a  switch  to  fluvoxamine  vs.  clomipramine  should  be  pre-
ferred.  Further  refractoriness  could  be  treated  with  higher 
doses  of  SSRIs  or  the  combination  of  a  SSRI  with  clomi-
pramine  (with  all  the  caution  that  was  mentioned  before). 
Clinicians should consider that the latter strategy is related to 
risk  of  drug  interactions  and/or  adverse  reactions,  including 
convulsions [354], and data on its effectiveness are inconsis-
tent. Should the addition of clomipramine be necessary, it must 
be administered at the lowest possible dosage [58, 336, 355]. 

Safety data about SSRI augmentation with antipsychotics 
are  scanty.  Given  that  this  strategy  does  not  guarantee  the 
remission of treatment-resistant OCD [133, 356, 357], its use 
during  pregnancy  should  be  considered  only  if  all  other 
pharmacological  approaches  and  CBT  fail.  The  dosages  of 
add-on  antipsychotic  drugs  must  be  as  low  as  possible. 
Among  available  antipsychotics,  risperidone  is  recom-
mended as the first choice, because it has the best safety pro-
file for the unborn child. Haloperidol and quetiapine, which 
have  an  established  safety  profile,  in  terms  of  efficacy  are 
placed  in  an  intermediate  position  between  risperidone  and 
olanzapine. Olanzapine use is related to a risk of gestational 
diabetes  mellitus.  Safety  data  about  add-on  aripiprazole  are 
limited.  Quetiapine  and  olanzapine  should  be  preferred  in 
case of severe sleep disorders and loss of appetite. Particular 
caution should be adopted for combinations of high doses of 
SSRIs with moderate-high doses of antipsychotics or clomi-
pramine [133, 356, 357]. 

In conclusion,  the recent acquisitions on OCD  treatment 
during  the  perinatal  period  are  still  limited.  Optimal  treat-
ment dosages and duration are still unknown. More informa-
tion is needed regarding the relationship between congenital 
malformations  and  antidepressant  doses,  as  well  as  safety 
and efficacy of the SSRI/antipsychotic combination options. 

7. CLINICAL GUIDELINES 

  According  to  the  National  Institute  for  Health  and  Care 
Excellence  (NICE)  CG31  guidelines  (updated  to  September 
2013  and  which  in  February  2014  showed  no  expected 
changes for the next 3-5 years) for the treatment of OCD in 
adults  [358],  patients  with  mild  functional  impairment 
should  be  directed  towards  low-intensity  CBT/ERP  (<10 
hours  of  therapist  input  for  patient).  If  ineffective,  more  in-
tensive cycles of SSRI or CBT (more than 10 hours) are con-
sidered comparably effective. Adults with OCD with moder-
ate  functional  impairment  should  have  the  opportunity  to 
choose  between  an  intensive  SSRI  or  CBT  cycle.  If  func-
tional impairment is severe, combined treatment with a SSRI 
and CBT/ERP is recommended [358].

Fig. (2). Algorithm on OCD treatment strategies. 

Initial  drug  treatment  for  adults  with  OCD  includes  a 
SSRI (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline or cita-
lopram).  If  treatment  response  is  not  adequate  and  no  side 
effects  have  occurred,  dosage  increases  may  be  considered 
after 4-6 weeks of treatment. SSRI administration should be 
reviewed  if  patient  develops  marked  and/or  prolonged 
akathisia,  restlessness  or  agitation.  Treatment  should  con-
tinue for at least 12 months after OCD remission (symptoms 

are  not  clinically  significant,  and  patient’s  functioning  is 
good for at least 12 weeks) to prevent relapse and allow fur-
ther improvement. A further prolongation of treatment dura-
tion  should  be  reassessed,  taking  into  account  the  severity 
and duration of the previous symptoms, number of previous 
episodes,  presence  of  residual  symptoms,  and  concomitant 
psychosocial difficulties [358]. 

 
 
Psychopharmacological Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2019, Vol. 17, No. 8    723 

Initial OCD treatment should not include other classes of 
antidepressants  such  as  TCAs,  SNRIs  and  monoamine  oxi-
dase  inhibitors  (MAOIs)  (unless  comorbid  disorders  for 
which  these  drugs  are  needed),  anxiolytics  (except  for  cau-
tious,  short-period  use  to  treat  possible  activation/agitation 
induced  by  SSRIs  during  treatment  introduction),  combina-
tions  of  antidepressants,  and  antipsychotic  monotherapy  or 
augmentation.  Patient’s  adherence  to  treatment,  and  alcohol 
or  substance  use  should  be  assessed  in  case  of  failed  re-
sponse  to  a  complete  treatment  cycle  with  a  SSRI,  before 
making changes to the pharmacological strategy [358]. 

If  patient  shows  a  partial  response  to  12  weeks  of  SSRI 
treatment,  NICE  CG31  recommends  the  combination  with 
CBT/ERP. If this combination fails, or SSRI response lacks, 
or the patient does not endorse CBT, switching to a different 
SSRI or to clomipramine should be evaluated. Clomipramine 
should be considered in three circumstances, i.e., failure (in-
efficacy  or  intolerance)  of  an  adequate  trial  of  at  least  one 
SSRI,  if  he/she  favors  clomipramine,  or  if  he/she  showed 
previous  response  to  this  drug.  If  effective,  treatment  with 
clomipramine should be continued for at least 12 months, as 
there  may  be  further  improvements.  Before  starting  clomi-
pramine, both adults and children should perform an electro-
cardiogram  to  rule  out  cardiac  conduction  abnormalities. 
TCAs  other  than  clomipramine,  MAOIs,  SNRIs,  and  antip-
sychotics  should  not  be  used  for  treating  OCD  in  children 
and  young  adults.  However,  these  can  be  considered  in  re-
fractory OCD [358]. 

If there is a lack of response after a complete trial with at 
least  one  SSRI,  another  with  a  SSRI  and  CBT/ERP,  and  a 
further  trial  with  clomipramine  alone,  NICE  CG31  recom-
mends  considering  strategies  such  as  additional  CBT/ERP, 
addition  of  an  antipsychotic  to  a  SSRI  or  clomipramine,  or 
the  combination  of  clomipramine  with  citalopram  (with  all 
the  precautions  we  stressed  above).  The  optimal  selection 
sequence  is  not  specified  because  there  is  no  current  evi-
dence supporting the superiority of one strategy over another 
[358].  We  summarize  clinical  guidelines  in  the  algorithm 
shown in Fig. 2. 

People with severe, chronic, and treatment-resistant OCD 
should  have  constant  access  to  specific  specialist  and 
multidisciplinary teams of health professionals with specific 
skills  in  OCD  treatment.  Hospital  services  should  carefully 
assess  suicide  risk,  extreme  discomfort  or  functional  im-
pairment,  ineffectiveness of appropriate  trials of pharmacol-
ogical/psychological/combined  treatments  for  long  periods, 
severe  comorbid  depression,  anorexia  nervosa,  or  schizo-
phrenia,  inversion  of  the  waking  cycle,  severe  or  habitual 
compulsive and avoidance behaviors interfering with normal 
activities and daily life. 

In  clinical  practice,  treatment  strategies  do  not  always 
follow  evidence-based  guidelines.  Poppe  et  al.  [359]  col-
lected  prescription  data  of  842  OCD  patients  from  1994  to 
2012  to  analyze  models  and  changes  in  prescription  strate-
gies.  Nine/tenths  of  patients  received  at  least  one  drug  and 
about  68%  a  combination  of  at  least  two  drugs.  The  most 
prescribed  drugs  were  antidepressants  (78%):  the  prescrip-

tions consisted of SSRIs (58%), TCAs (18%), mainly includ-
ing  clomipramine,  SGAs  (38%),  and  FGAs  (14%).  Several 
patients  received  a  tranquilizer  (20%).  The  authors  showed 
an  increase  over  time  of  SSRI,  SGA  and  tranquilizer  pre-
scriptions,  and  a  decrease  of  clomipramine.  FGA  use  re-
mained  stable.  The  high  rate  of  SSRI  use,  preference  for 
clomipramine  and  SGA  augmentation  were  consistent  with 
recommendations  of  international  guidelines.  The  admini-
stration of tranquilizers and FGAs and the choice of individ-
ual strategies were not  in  line with  the  expert recommenda-
tions [359]. 

  Other  guidelines  confirm  the  above  approaches.  For  the 
World  Federation  of  Biological  Psychiatry  (WFSBP),  first-
line  treatments  are  SSRIs  and  clomipramine  [360].  The  use 
of  medium-to-upper  doses  is  recommended  despite  lack  of 
evidence  of  a  dose-response  relationship  for  both  in  OCD. 
These  recommendations  are  made  to  general  practitioners 
and in case of non-response, psychiatric consultation in rec-
ommended.  In  still-resistant  severe  OCD  cases  and  after  all 
options  have  been  attempted  unsuccessfully,  deep  brain 
stimulation  should  be  considered.  The  updated  American 
Psychiatric  Association  guidelines  [361]  endorse  similar 
approaches, but also stress the need for identifying response 
predictors,  for  assessing  the  long-term  effectiveness  and 
safety of augmentation strategies in refractory OCD, and for 
establishing  adequate  time  points  for  intervention.  Combin-
ing  this,  the  way  is  paved  for  sequential  treatment  and  
for  personalized  medicine  approaches,  including  genetic/ 
pharmacogenomic/metabolomic  assessment.  We  propose  in 
our treatment algorithm (Fig. 2) to adopt such assessment in 
totally refractory OCD patients, specifically in those who did 
not  respond  to  augmentation  with  SGAs  or  to  switch  to 
clomipramine or to various SSRI trials. 

  Drug prescriptions  in OCD patients significantly vary  in 
different countries. Brakoulias et al. [297] compared the pre-
scription rates in Brazil, Italy, South Africa, Japan, Australia, 
India,  and  Spain.  Of  3139  OCD  patients,  almost  78%  re-
ceived a psychotropic drug, being in 73.5% of the cases of a 
SSRI,  which  was  in  line  with  international  guidelines.  The 
use of SSRIs varied from 59% in Australia to 96% in Japan, 
clomipramine ranged from 5% in Japan and South Africa to 
26% in India and Italy, atypical antipsychotics from 12% in 
South  Africa  to  50%  in  Japan.  Further  prospective  studies 
should be conducted to identifying cultural factors, pharma-
coeconomics, and pharmacogenomics, which may play a role 
in improving prescriptions and treatment outcomes. 

CONCLUSION 

  To date,  the most  effective pharmacological treatment is 
the  combination  of  an  SSRI  agent  with  CBT.  Refractory 
OCD  symptoms  can  improve  with  high  SSRI  dosages  or 
augmentation  with  an  atypical  antipsychotic  drug,  mainly 
risperidone  and  aripiprazole.  Due  to  inconsistent  evidence, 
the  addition  of  medications  other  than  antipsychotics  and 
intravenous  antidepressant  administration  needs  further  in-
vestigation.  Intervention  strategies  based  on  personalized 
medicine are of promise but require further investigation.
