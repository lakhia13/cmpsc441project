Abstract: Substance abuse is a chronic pathological disorder that negatively affects many health and
neurological processes. A growing body of literature has revealed gender differences in substance
use. Compared to men, women display distinct drug-use phenotypes accompanied by recovery
and rehabilitation disparities. These observations have led to the notion that sex-dependent sus-
ceptibilities exist along the progression to addiction. Within this scope, neuroadaptations following
psychostimulant exposure are thought to be distinct for each sex. This review summarizes clinical
ﬁndings and animal research reporting sex differences in the subjective and behavioral responses to
cocaine, methamphetamine, and nicotine. This discussion is followed by an examination of epige-
netic and molecular alterations implicated in the addiction process. Special consideration is given to
histone deacetylases and estrogen receptor-mediated gene expression.

1. Introduction

Over the past decades, epidemiological reports have indicated that the trajectory of
substance abuse is distinct between men and women [1–3]. While psychological, social,
and economic factors contribute to these gender disparities [4], physiological aspects also
inﬂuence the onset of drug use distinctly between the sexes [5,6]. Given the conceptu-
alization that women progress along the addiction landscape faster [7,8], it is essential
to understand the physiological mechanisms that lead to sex-dependent differences in
substance misuse. Thus, the focus of this review is to explore sex differences in substance
abuse from a biological and intracellular perspective. Special consideration is given to
clinical studies and animal research that examine gender and sex differences following
cocaine, methamphetamine (METH), and nicotine exposure. Herein, substance abuse is
deﬁned as a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by compulsive and cyclical
maladaptive behaviors of progressive drug use despite adverse consequences [9,10]. The
term gender, referring to men or women, is used when examining results from clinical
studies using human participants. The term sex, referring to biological features of a male or
female, is used when discussing relevant ﬁndings from studies using animal models of drug
addiction. The term epigenetics refers to regulatory processes involving posttranslational
modiﬁcations (PTMs) to chromatin structure, resulting in transcription changes without
altering genetic sequences [11]. Lastly, considering that psychostimulant exposure often
results in adaptive PTMs such as histone acetylation and deacetylation [12], this review
focuses on intracellular mechanisms associated with histone deacetylases (HDACs).

Elucidating the relation between epigenetic and intracellular mechanisms associated
with substance abuse across sex is vital. First, although a large body of research examines
substance abuse as a multifaceted disorder, there remains a further understanding of the
molecular adaptations that occur in response to psychostimulants exposure in females. Sec-
ond, because most studies from health disciplines have traditionally focused on males [13],
it is essential to provide evidence that considers sex-based issues given the inequity of

applying data generated from only one physiological system to both sexes. Given that
female animal subjects and human participants are underrepresented, research efforts have
now begun to explore sexually dimorphic variation within health complications, including
addiction research, as directed by the US National Institutes of Health [14].

2. Neuroanatomical Correlates of Substance Abuse

Substance abuse is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by the initiation of
drug consumption, progression towards uncontrolled drug intake, and the emergence of
adverse health complications [9]. Major brain structures associated with the neurobiological
aspects of substance use and the subsequent development of addiction include, but are
not limited to, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and dorsal
striatum [15]. The mPFC is a key structure associated with cognitive functioning such as
decision making, memory retrieval, learning, and the suppression of intense emotional
responses [16]. The mPFC is also implicated in the development of psychiatric disorders,
including anxiety and depression [17], two major aspects of substance use. This structure
receives neuronal inputs from other brain regions, including the thalamus, hippocampus,
and amygdala [16]. Efferent connections, however, project excitatory inputs to the NAc [17],
a neuronal pathway closely linked to the development of substance abuse. Disruption of
mPFC functioning is observed in conjunction with disinhibited drug motivation and an
increased drive for drug-seeking behavior [18].

The NAc is involved with motivated behaviors and the reinforcement of hedonic
experiences [19]. Within this structure, drug-associated reward is manifested through
dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as excitatory projec-
tions from the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) [20]. In
addition to hippocampal activation, stimulation of the NAc following psychostimulant
exposure results in an internal learning process whereby memory consolidation occurs
between associated environmental cues and drug reward [21,22]. However, once learning
patterns are established, there is a shift from voluntary drug usage to compulsory drug
taking. This process is manifested through excitatory activation of the dorsal striatum,
a brain region associated with the development of habit-forming behavior [23]. Indeed,
while the dorsal striatum is linked with Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, it is also
engaged in sequential motor-based behaviors often observed with obsessive-compulsive
tendencies [24], another major indicator of drug use.

It is also noteworthy to mention the pharmacological distinctions between cocaine,
METH, and nicotine which derives from the structural differences between these three
drugs. In brief, cocaine enhances neuronal transmission by inhibiting the reuptake of extra-
cellular monoamines [25]. This process results in the synaptic accumulation of dopamine,
serotonin, and norepinephrine within the previously mentioned brain regions [26,27].
METH also induces the extracellular accumulation of monoamines [28]. However, this pro-
cess involves vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) reverse transport, a mechanism
resulting in redistributed dopamine from intracellular vesicular storage to excess synaptic
release and neurotoxic effects [29]. In contrast, the reinforcement aspects of nicotine are
manifested by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) found along the ni-
grostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine pathways [30]. nAChRs are ligand-gated channels
that, once stimulated by acetylcholine or exogenous agonists including nicotine, allow the
inﬂux of calcium, sodium, and potassium promoting neurotransmission via depolarized
intracellular environments [31]. Thus, while these psychostimulants possess robust habit-
forming and addictive properties, each has a unique mechanism of action that drives the
development of substance abuse.

Within this framework, it is postulated that drug reward and hedonic experiences
linked to initial substance use signiﬁcantly diminish following persistent drug consumption
over time [20]. Along with neurotransmitter adaptations, this descending change is thought
to involve epigenetic alterations in cortical and mesolimbic systems resulting in a loss of
control over drug use [32]. Together, drug-induced mPFC, NAc, and striatal dysregulation

Genes 2022, 13, 892

manifest adverse changes in cognitive, emotional, and motor systems, each of which ensues
interconnected features of the addiction phenotype. However, evidence has accumulated
indicating that these neuroadaptations may be inﬂuenced by 17β-estradiol (E2) [5,33,34].
This process is believed to reinforce the addictive properties of psychostimulants in a
sex-dependent manner, given that, while both men and women produce E2, a prevalent
concentration of this hormone is not observed in males but cyclically ﬂuctuates in females.

3. Gender Disparities Observed in Substance Abuse

Converging lines of evidence have revealed gender differences in substance use. Tradi-
tionally, and across numerous cultures, men display higher rates of drug use in comparison
to women [3]. These observations often correlate with disposable income differences,
distinctions in social norms expectations, physiological variations in body weight, and
drug metabolism rates across gender [4,35]. However, women may experience intensiﬁed
health disturbances and adverse effects following lower drug consumption compared to
men. To illustrate, women are more likely to experience secondary drug-related problems,
including partner violence and sexual trauma [36,37]. In addition, women have unique
drug-induced health complications such as menstrual irregularity and unfavorable preg-
nancy outcomes [38,39]. Relative to men, women are also more likely to report positive and
pleasurable moods in response to psychostimulant exposure [40]. Women also report lower
drug abstinence rates characterized by an increased likelihood of stress-induced relapse [41].
Furthermore, many psychological inﬂuences contribute to gender disparities in drug use
such as early life traumas, anxiety reactivity, and adverse coping mechanisms [38,39].

Evidence also indicates that psychostimulant abuse is manifested distinctly between
the sexes from a biological perspective. For example, women who use illicit psychos-
timulants have increased brain regions associated with addiction and decreased brain
volumes associated with impulsivity control [42]. When considering the additive effect of
these components, it is often conceptualized that women move forward along the course
of addiction more rapidly, an observation referred to as the “telescoping effect” [1,8,43].
However, it is essential to stress that there are no certainties that predict hazardous drug
use for either gender [2]. Hence, it would be inappropriate to suggest that women are
simply vulnerable individuals with a greater addiction liability. Instead, understanding the
speciﬁc neuro-plastic events that occur in the wake of drug exposure, between the sexes,
can help develop effective therapeutic approaches for each gender.

4. Hormonal Inﬂuence on Substance Abuse: A Focus on Estrogen

Estrogens are essential gonadal hormones that inﬂuence growth throughout the lifes-
pan, promote osteogenesis, mediate inﬂammatory responses, and impact several physio-
logical processes including the regulation of reproductive systems [44]. The various forms
of endogenous estrogen include E2, estrone, estriol, and estetrol [45]. As a precursor of
these hormones, pregnenolone is found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) within
the gonads, adrenal glands, as well as the central nervous system (CNS), and can be de-
rived from cholesterol through several enzymatic steps in mitochondria [46]. Following
the conversion of pregnenolone to androstenedione, androstenedione then converts to
either testosterone or estrone [46,47]. Testosterone can then be converted to E2 by aro-
matase and, depending on the circulating levels, estrone can also be converted to E2 by
17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) [47]. However, in females, E2 is the main
endogenous form of these hormones [44], with varied ovarian ﬂuctuation across the 28-day
menstrual cycle. For instance, E2 levels increase during the follicular phase, reach peak
levels during ovulation, and decline during the luteal phase [47]. In contrast, progesterone,
another ovarian hormone released in conjunction with E2, increases during the luteal
phase [48]. E2 and progesterone are regulated by hypothalamic-pituitary negative feedback,
while their release is stimulated via the gonadotropin-releasing, luteinizing, and follicle-
stimulating hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary glands [46,47]. In addition,
E2 permeates the blood-brain barrier [49] and, once found in the CNS, can promote cell

Genes 2022, 13, 892

growth, synaptogenesis, as well as transcription [50]. Within this context, it is thought that
E2 inﬂuences neuronal programs that impact a vast array of reward-based behaviors [51],
alleviates deﬁcits in cognition observed with neurodegenerative disease [52], and promotes
memory formation [53].

Over the past 20 years, evidence has accumulated indicating that the ﬂuctuation
of ovarian hormones may be a prominent mediator of gender differences observed in
substance abuse [6,33,54]. Speciﬁcally, E2 is noted to enhance reactions to rewarding stim-
uli [51] and amplify the hedonic effects of psychostimulants [5,34]. For instance, elevated
levels of E2 correlate with enhanced positive subjective moods following psychostimulant
exposure in women [54,55]. Animal studies examining sex differences in cocaine, METH,
or nicotine have also revealed that E2 has an essential role in mediating the rewarding
aspects of these drugs. In female rodents, ﬂuctuations in ovarian hormones occur across
proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus, four distinct phases of the estrous cycle [56]. E2
levels are highest during proestrus, decline during estrus, and remain relatively low during
metestrus and diestrus [57]. In agreement with clinical reports, increased E2 levels also
correlate with enhanced drug-seeking behaviors in female rodents [33]. Thus, the following
sections provide selective summaries of clinical studies and ﬁndings from animal research
comparing the subjective and behavioral effects of cocaine, METH, and nicotine between
the sexes.

4.1. Gender Differences in Cocaine Use

Cocaine is an illicit psychostimulant with a robust addictive proﬁle [25]. Cocaine
addiction is characterized by recurrent patterns of drug use and negative health conse-
quences [58]. Regarding gender differences, women progress faster through the stages of
cocaine addiction and exhibit shorter cocaine-abstinence periods than men [59]. While
environmental stressors such as the occurrence of early traumatic events [60] contribute to
gender disparities in cocaine use, hormonal distinctions between men and women also play
an important role. For instance, the hedonic impact of cocaine is increased in a menstrual
phase-dependent manner, as women seeking cocaine report an enhanced “high” during
the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle [41]. These ﬁndings are further corroborated
by evidence demonstrating that smoked cocaine induces elevated positive subjective ef-
fects in women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle [61,62]. Conversely, the
administration of progesterone, which reduces the effects of E2, is reported to decrease
the positive subjective effects of cocaine in women, an effect not observed in men [63,64].
However, there is evidence indicating no differences in the subjective effects of cocaine
across the menstrual cycle [65]. Interestingly, the route of cocaine administration in human
participants (e.g., intranasal vs. intracranial) has been noted as a potential confounding
variable when considering the relation between E2 and enhanced cocaine reward [65].

4.2. Sex Differences in the Behavioral Response to Cocaine

Multiple research laboratories have compared the reinforcing effects of cocaine across
sex using the intravenous self-administration (IVSA) paradigm. The IVSA paradigm is a
preclinical assessment used to examine the motivational and reinforcing properties of drugs
in animals. This paradigm utilizes operant conditioning whereby responses, as noted by
“active” lever presses or nose pokes, result in light/tone cues and programed drug delivery
via intravenous infusions. Inactive responses, as noted by presses on a non-drug associated
lever, result in no consequences. The paradigm can consist of several phases including
acquisition, escalation, maintenance, extinction, and reinstatement of drug seeking by cue-
or drug-induced methods [66,67]. Many researchers have noted that female rodents display
enhanced addiction proﬁles relative to male rodents, using IVSA procedures. For example,
female rats acquire cocaine IVSA faster [68] and respond more under progressive ratio (PR)
schedules of reinforcement than male rats [69]. Female rats also respond more for cocaine
under extended access [70,71] or short-access IVSA paradigms compared to male rats [72].
Under a PR schedule, female rats display higher breaking point averages for cocaine than

Genes 2022, 13, 892

5 of 27

males [73,74]. Enhanced addiction proﬁles are also observed in female rodents during
adolescence. For instance, adolescent female rats display faster acquisition for cocaine
IVSA under ﬁxed ratio (FR) and PR schedules, compared to male adolescents [75]. The
notion that females may experience greater cocaine reward is also observed across species.
Speciﬁcally, cocaine self-administration (SA) is enhanced in female cynomolgus monkeys
compared to male cynomolgus monkeys [76], an effect attributed to ﬂuctuations in ovarian
hormones during the follicular phase. Female rats also respond more to cocaine-associated
cues following a withdrawal period (incubation of cocaine craving) than male rats [69,77].
These effects are thought to be mediated via hormonal changes throughout the estrous cycle.
For instance, following either a 15- or 48-day absence period from cocaine IVSA, female
rats in estrus display enhanced cue-induced drug-seeking behavior [77,78]. Even after the
extinction of cocaine IVSA has occurred, female rats demonstrate greater cocaine-induced
reinstatement during estrus [79,80].

The role of E2 in mediating cocaine reward is further illustrated by studies utilizing
ovariectomized (OVX) procedures in female rodents. For example, OVX female rats display
reductions in cocaine IVSA compared to free-cycling female rats [81]. Furthermore, estrogen
benzoate treatment recuperates cocaine IVSA in OVX females [81]. E2 treatment in OVX
female rats also results in faster acquisition of cocaine IVSA compared to control OVX
rats [70,82,83]. In contrast, progesterone is thought to counteract the effects of E2 on cocaine
IVSA. For instance, OVX female rats simultaneously treated with E2 and progesterone
display lower escalation for cocaine IVSA than OVX female rats treated with E2 only [82,84].
E2 also seems to have a unique effect on brain-associated neurochemical responses to
cocaine. Speciﬁcally, OVX female rats treated with E2 benzoate display cocaine-induced
dopamine increases within the dorsal striatum, an effect not observed in castrated male
rats [85]. Castrated male rats treated with E2 also display an increased preference for cocaine
than vehicle-treated castrated male rats [86]. Moreover, by using four core genotypes
(FCG) mice, a mouse model designed to generate XY mice exhibiting ovaries and XX mice
exhibiting testes [87], it was demonstrated that male XY mice with ovaries acquire cocaine
IVSA faster than gonadal-intact males [88]. Together, multiple studies have demonstrated
sex differences in cocaine IVSA. These effects are likely mediated by E2-associated processes
leading to enhanced drug-seeking behaviors.

4.3. Gender Differences in Methamphetamine Use

METH is another illicit psychostimulant with a strong potential for abuse liability [89].
Addiction to METH is characterized by a rapid escalation of drug intake, loss of control over
drug usage, and the emergence of cognitive deﬁcits [90]. Regarding gender differences,
women tend to use METH at an earlier age [91] and become addicted to METH at a
faster rate [92]. Additionally, women are more likely to experience comorbid psychiatric
symptoms in conjunction with METH use [93]. Psychological and social factors associated
with early METH use among women include weight reduction motivations, intimate
partner inﬂuences, and physical abuse [93–95]. METH use distinctly impacts men and
women from a physiological perspective as well. For instance, amongst METH users,
women tend to experience greater METH dependence [92], develop thinner frontal cortices,
have larger NAc volumes, and display greater impulsivity compared to men [41]. However,
men tend to have greater amphetamine-induced striatal dopamine release compared to
women [96]. Gender disparities in METH abuse might be associated with the effects of
hormonal ﬂuctuations across the menstrual cycle. For example, women report an increase in
positive mood and euphoria following amphetamine exposure during the follicular phase
of the menstrual cycle [97,98]. In healthy women, E2 treatment also increases the positive
subjective experiences of amphetamine [99]. However, there is evidence indicating that
progesterone enhances the positive effects of amphetamine in non-addicted women [100].
Collectively, these reports demonstrate that varying levels of gonadal hormones in women
alter the subjective rewarding effects of METH.

4.4. Sex Differences in the Behavioral Response to Methamphetamine

Preclinical studies investigating sex differences in METH IVSA have revealed in-
consistent ﬁndings. For example, evidence indicates that female rats acquire METH SA
signiﬁcantly faster than male rats under FR1 conditions and 6-h access to the drug [101].
Under similar conditions, female rats display faster escalation for drug intake and self-
administer more METH than male rats [102]. Compared to male rats, female rats also
demonstrate enhanced motivation for METH SA, as noted by an increase in responses for
the drug under FR5 conditions [103,104]. In contrast, there is evidence indicating that male
rats intake more METH than female rats under 6-h extended access procedures using FR1
regimens [105,106]. However, other reports have noted no sex differences in METH SA
when using short [107,108] or extended access [109–111] IVSA procedures. Interestingly,
under a 96-h METH IVSA access paradigm, female rats display escalation patterns char-
acterized by a three-fold increase in their METH intake, an effect not observed for male
rats [112]. After extinction procedures, female rats also respond more for METH following
cue-induced or drug-primed reinstatement procedures [107,113,114]. Additionally, male
and female rats demonstrate similar incubation of METH seeking following a 30-day absti-
nence period from METH SA [105,106,111]. Along with distinct METH IVSA procedures,
drug dose regimens might account for some of these inconsistencies, given that female rats
display greater responses for lower METH doses [101] than male rats [105,106].

E2 is also thought to mediate some of the sex-speciﬁc behavioral responses to METH.
For instance, METH SA is lower in OVX female rats in comparison to E2-treated OVX
female rats [115]. Utilizing the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, another
animal model of drug abuse, it is reported that E2 treatment in OVX female mice facilitates
METH-induced CPP in comparison to castrated male mice [116]. Taken together, these
studies report that females display greater METH seeking than male rodents, and implicate
E2 as a potential mediator of METH addiction-like behavior in a sex-dependent manner.

4.5. Gender Differences in Nicotine Use

Although the prevalence of smoking cigarettes has declined within the US over the past
50 years [117], tobacco remains a commonly used drug coupled with powerful addiction
properties. As a health concern, smoking tobacco is linked to many medical complications,
including cardiovascular failure, lung disease, and is associated with the development of
cancer [118]. While there is a multitude of chemical components found within a given
cigarette, nicotine is generally considered one of the primary habit-forming substances
linked to the rewarding aspects of smoking [119,120]. Regarding sex differences, clinical
studies have observed gender disparities in tobacco use. For example, men tend to consume
more cigarettes than women [121]. However, women are less likely to beneﬁt from smoking
cessation aids [122], have lower success rates when attempting to quit smoking [123], and
report more nicotine withdrawal symptoms during smoking abstinence [124]. Clinical
reports indicate that some of the gender disparities in tobacco use may be, in part, linked
to ovarian hormone ﬂuctuations across the menstrual cycle. For instance, earlier reports
suggested that cigarette use increases during menses [125], and the craving for smoking in-
creases during the luteal phase [125]. However, more recent reports indicate that enhanced
nicotine use among women increases when E2 levels are highest [126,127]. In contrast,
the average number of cigarettes smoked per day decreases when progesterone levels are
increased [128]. In addition, women seeking treatment for nicotine dependence display
an increased likelihood of smoking abstinence when progesterone levels are highest [129].
Thus, ﬂuctuations in ovarian hormones affect cigarette use, craving for smoking, and
increase the propensity for relapse [127,130].

4.6. Sex Differences in the Behavioral Response to Nicotine

Animal research has also observed sex differences in nicotine SA. For example, the
acquisition of nicotine IVSA is faster in female rats relative to male rats [131,132]. Multiple
studies utilizing IVSA procedures have also demonstrated that female rats intake more

Genes 2022, 13, 892

7 of 27

nicotine than male rats [133–135]. Under an FR5 schedule, female rats also display more
nicotine IVSA compared to males [136]. Nonetheless, there are reports indicating that
male rats acquire nicotine IVSA faster than females [72], and no sex differences in nicotine
IVSA [137]. Data from animal studies also demonstrate the importance of ovarian hormones
in mediating nicotine reward. For instance, E2 differentially enhances nicotine-induced
striatal dopamine release between the sexes, with female rats displaying greater dopamine
release than males [138]. Additionally, female rats respond more to nicotine SA under
PR schedules during estrus [132]. Compared to regular cycling female rats, OVX females
display reductions in nicotine-induced place preference [139] and nicotine IVSA [133,140].
These effects are estrogen-related, given that E2 treatment partially recovers nicotine SA in
OVX female rats [133,140]. However, variations across the estrous cycle may not inﬂuence
nicotine reward in female rats when considering ﬁndings from the nicotine IVSA [131] or
CPP paradigms [139].

5. Histone Acetylation as a Regulatory Mechanism of Gene Expression

Gene expression is regulated through dynamic PTMs to the chromatin structure that
restricts or provides access to DNA. Transcriptional activation and silencing are processes
modulated, in part, by the epigenetic modiﬁcation of histones via reversible interactions
between their N-terminal tails and nuclear enzymes [141,142]. Within chromatin, each
nucleosome consists of an individual octameric structure made of four main histone pro-
teins, including H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (with 2 of each primary histone), wrapped around
147 base pairs of DNA [142,143]. Each histone protein contains lysine residues that undergo
PTMs. Negatively charged DNA structures form an electrostatic force with positively
charged lysine residues, forming a compressed state [141,144]. Large protein complexes
containing enzymes known as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) can add acetyl groups
to this structure, leading to a neutralized electrostatic state resulting in chromatin relax-
ation [144,145]. This process reduces DNA afﬁnity toward nucleosomes, thus rendering
promoter regions more accessible [144,145]. By contrast, repressor complexes containing
enzymes known as histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups [146,147]. The
removal of acetyl groups results in N-terminal tail electrostatic charge and chromatin com-
pression. This process restricts transcription factors from accessing promoter regions along
DNA sequences, leading to gene silencing [148]. However, while these dynamic processes
are associated with transcriptional stimulation and repression, it is important to note that
in some cases histone deacetylation can prompt transcriptional activation [147].

6. Histone Deacetylases and Drug Exposure

Currently, there are 18 known mammalian HDACs categorized into four distinct
family classes. These include the zinc-dependent Class I (HDAC 1, 2, 3, 8), Class IIa (HDAC
4, 5, 7, 9), Class IIb (HDAC 6 and 10), and the Class IV (HDAC 11) family member [149].
The Class III HDACs are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)1-dependent enzymes
called Sirtuins and have seven distinct subfamily members [146]. Relevant to this review,
HDACs are broadly expressed throughout the brain and serve vital roles including intra-
cellular regulation, cell differentiation, cell viability, and are implicated in drug-induced
gene expression. Speciﬁcally, it is thought that HDACs function to regulate the transcrip-
tional responses necessary for the formation of molecular and intracellular environments
conducive to the addiction phenotype following drug exposure [150,151].

6.1. Class I Histone Deacetylases

Identiﬁed during the mid-1990s, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are nuclear-localized enzymes
with an estimated 80% shared sequence homology [152,153]. These enzymes are essen-
tial for embryonic development, with their deletion resulting in early lethality [154]. In
addition, both enzymes contain a single deacetylase domain, share similar intracellular
functions including DNA repair [152–154], and engage in protein-protein associations with
large transcriptional repressive complexes, including Swi-independent 3 (Sin3) [155,156],

Genes 2022, 13, 892

8 of 27

repressor element-1 silencing transcription corepressor (CoREST) [154], and nucleosome
remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) [157]. Together, these protein complexes regulate gene
silencing and activation via the remodeling of chromatin accessibility [157]. HDAC1 and
HDAC2 also mediate behavioral responses to psychostimulant exposure. For instance,
the non-speciﬁc HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) phenylbutyrate and trichostatin A (TSA) have
been found to attenuate cocaine SA in rats [158]. Furthermore, conditional knockdown of
HDAC1 within the NAc reduces cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization in mice [151].
In relation to METH exposure, an acute METH challenge results in overexpression of
Hdac1 and Hdac2 in the mouse mPFC [159]. However, acute METH exposure decreases
HDAC1 and increases HDAC2 expression in the rat NAc [160]. Furthermore, conditional
knockdown of HDAC2 prolongs the overexpression of immediate early genes in the mouse
NAc following acute METH exposure [161]. In relation to nicotine exposure, treatment
with the HDACi sodium butyrate facilitates the extinction of nicotine SA in rats [162]. In
addition, nicotine-induced CPP is associated with increased HDAC2 expression in the rat
NAc [163].

HDAC3, identiﬁed shortly after HDAC1 and HDAC2 [164,165], is another nuclear
Class I family member that is abundantly expressed in the brain [166] and shares structural
similarities to HDAC8 [149]. HDAC3 is involved in embryonic development, DNA repair,
and long-term memory formation [167]. Similar to HDAC1 and HDAC2, HDAC3 induces
transcriptionally repressive activity however it associations with other protein complexes
including nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid and
thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) [168]. Furthermore, HDAC3 coimmunoprecipitates
with HDAC4 and HDAC5 such that the enzymatic activity of these other family members
is dependent on the presence of HDAC3 [169]. In relation to psychostimulant exposure,
systemic HDAC3 inhibition results in the suppression of cocaine SA reinstatement [170].
However, the latter report also notes that HDAC3 inhibition does not alter cocaine SA under
PR or FR schedules of reinforcement. Selective inhibition of HDAC3 also facilitates the
extinction of cocaine-induced CPP in mice [171]. Furthermore, local deletion of HDAC3 in
the NAc facilitates cocaine-induced CPP in mice [172]. Chronic cocaine exposure alters the
deacetylase activity of HDAC3 and the transcriptional expression of HDAC-target genes in
the mouse NAc in a cell-speciﬁc manner [173]. However, local knockdown of HDAC3 in the
NAc does not reduce cocaine locomotor sensitization [151]. With respect to METH exposure,
a single METH challenge decreases Hdac3 mRNA in the NAc [174]. However, repeated
METH exposure does not alter Hdac3 mRNA in the mPFC [159]. In the dorsal striatum,
Fos-positive neurons overexpress Hdac3 mRNA following a 30-day withdrawal period from
METH SA in rats [175]. Regarding nicotine exposure, phenylbutyrate treatment, another
HDACi, results in reduced nicotine-induced CPP in rats [163].

HDAC8, originally identiﬁed by multiple researchers in the year 2000 [176,177], is
another important Class I family member known for its role in cellular proliferation and
oncogene control [178]. Aside from being found in the cell nucleus, HDAC8 can translocate
to the cytoplasm and deacetylate non-histone targets, including tumor protein P53 (p53),
α-actin, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) [179]. This activity occurs in
the absence of large complexes, given that, unlike other Class I family members, HDAC8
lacks a C-terminal tail, used to recruit corepressors [180]. Because of its non-histone targets,
HDAC8 is implicated in the regulation of signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) [178]. Interestingly, TSA or phenylbu-
tyrate treatment reduced cocaine SA and reinstatement in rats [158,181]. Regarding METH
exposure, non-contingent chronic METH challenges decrease Hdac8 mRNA levels in the
dorsal striatum of mice [182]. Similarly, a single METH challenge decreases Hdac8 mRNA
levels in the mouse NAc [174]. However, a single METH challenge increases Hdac8 mRNA
levels in the mouse mPFC [159], suggesting distinct regional responses to METH. To date,
the potential effects of HDAC8 on nicotine action are not fully understood.

6.2. Class II Histone Deacetylases

Class IIa HDACs have received substantial focus considering their shuttling ability
between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments [183]. HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC6
possess a C-terminal catalytic domain similar to Class I HDACs, but also have an addi-
tional N-terminal domain that is able to bind onto transcription factors, leading to gene
silencing [184]. Upon dephosphorylation, Class IIa HDAC family members enter the cell
nucleus and become enzymatically active by combining with NCoR and SMRT complexes
containing HDAC3 [169]. However, once their N-terminal serine residues become phos-
phorylated, Class IIa HDAC family members transport out of the nucleus and return to the
cytoplasmic compartment via 14-3-3 adaptor proteins [184]. This translocation prevents
access to core histones, which results in hyperacetylation and the expression of genes.
Interestingly, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC9 become degraded within the cell nucleus,
while HDAC7 undergoes cytoplasmic degradation following phosphorylated-induced
nuclear export [185].

HDAC4, ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1999 [186], is a potent transcriptional repressor with high
expression within skeletal muscle, heart, and neuronal tissues [166]. Within the brain,
HDAC4 is involved in the development of spatial learning and memory processes [186],
and plays important biological roles including apoptosis, cell differentiation, and neu-
rogenesis [187,188]. Moreover, the nuclear and cytoplasmic concentration of HDAC4 is
varied within distinct cell types of the CNS, with phosphorylation leading to cytoplasmic
localization [189]. Differentiated cleaved isoforms of HDAC4 also determine the intra-
cellular localization of this enzyme [184]. HDAC4 is known to associate with HDAC3
and the SMRT/NCoR complex [169]; however, the enzymatic properties of HDAC4 are
inactive in the absence of HDAC3 [190]. Concerning drug exposure, non-contingent cocaine
administration leads to hyperphosphorylation of HDAC4 and subsequent nuclear export
of this enzyme in striatal mouse tissue [191]. Pharmacological degradation of HDAC4 is
associated with enhanced cocaine SA [192], while viral overexpression of HDAC4 in the
NAc is associated with reduced cocaine SA [193]. Additionally, knockout (KO) of HDAC4
within the NAc of mice results in a reduction of cocaine-induced CPP and locomotor
responses [191]. Regarding METH, a single METH challenge results in decreased Hdac4
mRNA level in the NAc of mice [174]. However, single and repeated METH challenges
increase Hdac4 mRNA levels in the mPFC of mice [159].

HDAC5, identiﬁed along with HDAC4 and HDAC6 [186], is another important Class
IIa HDAC family member implicated in transcriptional repression, microtubule regulation,
and axonal growth [194]. The intranuclear shuttling of HDAC5 involves protein kinase
C subtype µ (PKCµ), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-II), and
protein kinase A (PKA) [195]. For instance, HDAC5 phosphorylation by PKCµ leads to
14-3-3 chaperone interactions and cytoplasmic localization [196]. Moreover, PKA can pre-
vent this process by phosphorylating HDAC5 resulting in nuclear import [197]. Regarding
psychostimulant exposure, chronic cocaine exposure increases HDAC5 phosphorylation
and cytoplasmic localization in the mouse NAc [198], a process implicating CaMK-II. In
addition, viral overexpression of nuclear-bound HDAC5 within the NAc reduces cocaine-
induced CPP in mice [197]. Within the striatum, cocaine exposure leads to the nuclear
import of dephosphorylated HDAC5 via protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) [199]. Following
cocaine sensitization, Hdac5 mRNA expression is decreased within the dorsal striatum and
PFC [200]. Regarding METH exposure, viral-induced overexpression of HDAC5 in the
rat dorsal striatum results in enhanced METH seeking after prolonged drug abstinence
following IVSA procedures [201]. Interestingly, the same study reports that dorsal stri-
atal knockdown of HDAC5 results in decreased METH seeking after a drug abstinence
period [201]. With respect to nicotine, increases in global levels of H3 and H4 acetylation
are observed in the mouse striatum following nicotine exposure, a result thought to be
mediated by the inhibitory effects of nicotine on HDAC activity [202].

HDAC7 plays a vital role in cardiovascular viability, immune cell response [203],
and apoptotic neuronal protection [169]. Relative to the expression levels of other HDAC

Genes 2022, 13, 892

10 of 27

family members in the CNS, HDAC7 has the lowest expression [166]. This Class IIa family
member has independent deacetylase action [204], but also possesses deacetylation proper-
ties within nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments when associated with HDAC3 [169].
Intracellular signaling and nuclear shuttling of HDAC7 involves protein kinase D (PKD),
whereby phosphorylation of HDAC7 induces nuclear export, and CaMK-I promotes cyto-
plasmic localization [183]. In addition, HDAC7 binds with NCoR and SMRT [169] and has
both transcriptional activation and repressive properties. In relation to psychostimulant
exposure, treating human primary astrocytes with cocaine results in upregulated HDAC7
protein levels [205]. Local knockdown of HDAC2 in the NAc results in upregulation of
Hdac7 in mice [151]. Similarly, HDAC2 KO mice demonstrate increased Hdac7 mRNA levels
following an acute METH challenge [161].

HDAC9, cloned in early 2001 [206], is another important Class IIa family member
involved in the regulation of T-cell immune responses [207], metabolism of lipids, develop-
ment of atherosclerosis plaques, and vascular inﬂammation [208]. Within the CNS, HDAC9
is observed in mature neurons, but not in supporting glial cells including astrocytes or
oligodendrocytes [209]. In regard to psychostimulant exposure, HDAC9 KO mice do not
display differences in cocaine-induced CPP relative to control mice [198]. The latter study
also reports that overexpression of HDAC9 in the mouse NAc has no effect on cocaine
reward. Related to METH exposure, a single METH challenge does not alter Hdac9 mRNA
levels in the mouse NAc [161].

Like other Class II family members, HDAC6 imports to the cell nucleus, where it
interacts with distinct large protein complexes such as ligand-dependent corepressor
(LCoR) [210]. However, HDAC6 is predominantly found within the cytoplasmic com-
partment, where it interacts with non-histone substrates, including heat shock protein
(Hsp)90, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1, and α-tubulin [211]. The distinct
biological roles of HDAC6 include microtubule stabilization, cell division, cell migration,
and cytoskeletal dynamics, including the elimination of misfolded proteins due, in part, to
its zinc ﬁnger-ubiquitin binding protein (ZnF-UBP) domain [212]. Because of its prominent
role in the regulation of aggresomal formation, HDAC6 has been implicated as a potential
therapeutic target for various neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a cognitive
decline [213]. Regarding psychostimulant exposure, HDAC6 levels are increased in the rat
PFC following synthetic cannabinoid and cocaine exposure, an effect not observed when
challenging rats with cocaine only [214]. With respect to METH, systemic pharmacological
inhibition of HDAC6 results in decreased METH IVSA in rats [215]. In relation to nicotine,
exposing lung cancer cells to nicotine results in the inhibition of HDAC6 activity [216].

HDAC10, identiﬁed in 2002 [217,218], shares structural homology with HDAC6 and
possesses two distinct catalytic domains. Speciﬁcally, HDAC10 contains an N-terminal
catalytic domain and a secondary C-terminal leucine-rich catalytic domain [217]. HDAC10
serves distinct biological functions, including DNA repair and mitotic regulation [219]. In
addition to nuclear localization, HDAC10 can be found in the cytosolic compartment, where
its C-terminal leucine-rich domain allows for cytoplasmic accumulation [218]. However,
once imported to the cell nucleus, HDAC10 interacts with SMRT, HDAC3, and HDAC2 to
commence transcriptional repression [169]. Regarding METH exposure, a single METH
challenge does not alter Hdac10 mRNA levels in the mouse mPFC [159]. Similarly, a single
METH challenge does not alter Hdac10 mRNA expression within the mouse NAc [174].
However, repeated METH challenges reduce Hdac10 mRNA levels within the rat dorsal
striatum [182]. With respect to nicotine, exposing human neuroblastoma cells to nicotine
results in nucleosome repositioning and Hdac10 DNA accessibility [220].

6.3. Class IV Histone Deacetylases

HDAC11, identiﬁed in 2002, is the only current member of the Class IV family and is
the most abundantly expressed HDAC in the rat brain [166,221]. HDAC11 is the smallest
of the HDACs [221] and interacts with corepressor complexes containing HDAC6 and
HDAC9 [222]. This enzyme has an important role in regulating inﬂammatory T cell

Genes 2022, 13, 892

11 of 27

response, maintaining metabolic homeostasis [223] and fatty acid deacetylase activity [224].
Relative to other HDAC family members, the enzymatic preference of HDAC11 for histone
lysine residues is thought to be relatively lower [225]. In addition, HDAC11 has been found
in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments; however, this localization may be cell
type-dependent [226]. Regarding drug exposure, HDAC11 expression has been found to
increase following cocaine SA in the rat dorsal striatum, cingulate cortex, and NAc [226].
In relation to METH exposure, Hdac11 mRNA levels decrease in the rat dorsal striatum
following a 30-day withdrawal period from METH IVSA [227]. Hdac11 mRNA levels also
decrease in the rat dorsal striatum following repeated METH challenges [182]. In contrast,
Hdac11 mRNA decreases in the mouse NAc following acute METH exposure [174].

7. Intracellular Mechanisms of Estrogen Receptors

The molecular activity of E2 is mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER) α and the ER β,
two distinct steroid hormone receptors [228,229]. Here, (ERs) is used when referencing both
ERα and ERβ subtypes. Both ERs share amino acid sequence similarities [228] and are cell
membrane-localized or nuclear-bound [229]. ERα was identiﬁed during the 1960s [230,231]
and cloned during the late 1980s [232]. ERβ was characterized and cloned in the mid-
1990s [233,234]. In addition, ERβ has ﬁve distinct isoforms [235], while ERα has two
distinct isoforms [236]. In the brain, ERs are found within neurons and glial cells [47,236]
and serve diverse biological functions including cell survival, neuronal plasticity, gene
regulation, and memory formation [53]. ERs possess six distinct domains denoted as A/B
to F [237]. The A/B domains contain activation function (AF)-1 and mediate transcription
in a ligand-dependent and -independent manner. In the absence of E2, ERs can become
activated via phosphorylation by kinases such as ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) [238]. The C domain consists of two different zinc-ﬁngers that allow ERs to recognize
and bind onto DNA [239]. Furthermore, ERs have a high afﬁnity for estrogen response
elements (EREs), a 17-bp palindromic DNA sequence (5(cid:48)-GGTCA—TGACC-3(cid:48)) [237,240]
found along various genes [228]. Once bound to either full ERE sites or partial ERE
half-sites [241], these receptors recruit RNA polymerase II and assemble large activator
complexes to stimulate transcription [237]. While both receptors share overlapping ERE tar-
gets, they also independently prefer speciﬁc gene promoters and display competitive ERE
selection, as each can displace the other from ERE sites, resulting in reduced transcriptional
activity [241]. In this manner, ERα and ERβ play essential roles in regulating global patterns
of gene expression, via direct nuclear mechanisms and transcriptional programs. Domains
D/E include AF-2 [242] and regulate transcription via non-classical mechanisms by interact-
ing with either transcriptional co-activator or co-repressive proteins. While AF-1 functions
without ligand binding, AF-2 is ligand-dependent [228]. Ligand-linked ERs can form
homodimers or heterodimers that recruit transcriptional machinery to AP-1 responsive
elements [229] or activate diverse protein-kinase cascades, including PKA, MAPK/ERK,
and phospholipase C (PLC) [243], which induce CREB phosphorylation resulting in gene
expression [244]. Furthermore, cell membrane-localized ERs also induce the rapid release of
intracellular Ca+ stores [245], triggering multiple G-protein-related intracellular signaling
cascades and pathways. ERs also modulate transcriptional activity in a ligand-independent
manner when their lysine residue becomes acetylated or their serine residues become
phosphorated [244]. Moreover, through membrane caveolin protein interactions, ER can
couple with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), resulting in CREB phosphoryla-
tion (see Figure 1 for an illustrated representation depicting some of the reviewed molecular
mechanisms by which E2 stimulates transcriptional responses) [243,246].

However, ligand-linked ERs can also suppress transcription by targeting genes lacking
an ERE site through associations with HDAC-containing complexes [238] such as LCoR,
SMRT, and metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA-1) [247]. Additionally, ligand-linked ERβ
is known to inhibit transcription through AP-1 sites [248]. Thus, ERs indirectly suppress
or enhance gene expression through alternative promoter regions [228]. The F domain
contains a C-terminal able to enhance overall DNA-binding capacity [249]. This aspect

Genes 2022, 13, 892

12 of 27

is of interest given that lysine residues along ER domains can be reversibly acetylated or
deacetylated, a process involving HAT and HDAC activity. To illustrate, p300 acetylates
K266/K268 and K302/K303 found along the DNA-binding domain of ERα, whereas TSA
exposure halts the deacetylation of ERα [249–251]. However, each acetylated lysine pattern
impacts transcriptional activity distinctly, as acetylated K266/288 enhances ERα-mediated
gene expression while K302/303 acetylation decreases transcription [249,251].

histone deacetylases (HDACs) on chromatin are displayed. On top, the schematic displays cell
membrane-bound ER activated by E2 and possible downstream intracellular pathways leading
to gene expression. Illustrated on the top-left, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) and ER-

Here, cell membrane-bound ERs indirectly inﬂuence nuclear environments by the phosphorylation
and activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), leading to CRE-mediated gene
expression. Similarly, stimulation of the MAPK/ERK cascades and subsequent phosphorylated
activator protein 1 (AP-1) is displayed as another intranuclear regulation by membrane-bound ERs.
The bottom of the schematic depicts distinct molecular environments surrounding nucleosomes that
generally limit or promote gene expression. Illustrated on the bottom-left are nucleosomes with
densely packed DNA, characterized by repressed access to promoter regions and estrogen response
element (ERE) sites. Here, nuclear, and cytoplasmic-shuttling, HDACs perform an integral role in
restricting transcription by removing histone acetyl groups. HDACs are also depicted as blocking ERs
from reaching their genomic targets. On the bottom-right portion of the schematic, nucleosomes are
depicted with relaxed states, characterized by loosely wrapped DNA. Here, histone acetyltransferases
(HATs) add acetyl groups to lysine residues, resulting in reduced DNA-histone afﬁnity and accessible
ERE sites. Classical ER-mediated transcription is illustrated via E2 activated nuclear ER targeting
an ERE site. A phosphorylated ER is also depicted as an additional mechanism of transcriptional
activation. Furthermore, the acetylation of ERs by p300 is depicted as another possible mechanism
that promotes transcription within the accessible nucleosome state. Collectively, these epigenetic
mechanisms and molecular adaptations may drive enhanced drug-seeking behavior more so in
females compared to males.

8. Estrogen Receptors and Sex Difference in Neural Adaptations following Drug Exposure

Studies using animals have noted that ERβ plays a prominent role in mediating
addiction-like behavior linked to cocaine exposure. For example, following extinction from
cocaine IVSA, systemic administration of diarylpropionitrile, an ERβ agonist, enhances
cocaine seeking during reinstatement procedures in OVX female rats [84]. Interestingly,
this same effect was not observed when administering an ERα agonist [84]. Similarly, local
infusions of diarylpropionitrile into the prefrontal cortex potentiates drug-seeking behavior
in OVX female rats following extinction from cocaine IVSA [252], an effect not observed
when locally administering an ERα agonist into the same region. Female mice treated with
an ERβ agonist also display increases in cocaine-induced CPP, while ERβ knockdown in
the NAc decreases cocaine-induced CPP [253]. Furthermore, local administrations of a G
protein-coupled estradiol receptor (GPER) agonist into the dorsolateral striatum enhances
breaking point averages and potentiates reinstatement of cocaine IVSA in female but not
male rats [74]. These effects are most likely associated with E2-mediated enhancement of
cocaine reward through ER activation, given that E2 treatment enhances cocaine SA in OVX
female rats and not in castrated male rats [82].

Relative to cocaine, fewer reports have examined the neuro-plastic and molecular
adaptations following METH exposure between sex. For instance, female rats exhibit
increases in synaptic activity within the prelimbic area of the PFC, as noted by evoked
excitatory currents following METH IVSA [110]. Following METH IVSA, and incubation
of METH seeking, female rats display increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor
2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus and decreased prodynorphin mRNA levels in the
PFC [105]. However, male rats display increased prodynorphin mRNA levels in the NAc
after similar METH SA procedures, an effect not observed in female rats [106]. Male rats
also display hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increases following
METH IVSA procedures, an effect not observed in female rats [109]. Collectively, these
studies demonstrate sex-dependent changes in response to METH exposure across distinct
brain regions. Given that varying levels of E2 distinctly affect dopaminergic and glutamater-
gic transmission in reward circuitry [254], ER/E2 interactions can inﬂuence intracellular
mechanisms associated with METH addiction distinctly between males and females. This
is probable, as E2 administration has a greater effect on striatal dopamine release following
amphetamine exposure in OVX females compared to castrated male rats [255]. In addition,
E2 can inﬂuence reward-linked behaviors in a sex-dependent manner [245] through cell
membrane ER-metabotropic glutamate receptor associations [256]. Although non-genomic,
stimulating metabotropic glutamate receptors by ligand-bound ERs induces MAPK and
CREB phosphorylation [257], which in turn stimulate transcriptional responses. Further-
more, E2 stimulated CREB phosphorylation may be sex-speciﬁc, as only hippocampal
neurons from female rats exhibit this effect [243]. These observations are relevant given that
proteins along the MAPK/ERK intracellular cascade are phosphorated following METH
IVSA [258]. E2 might also exert neuroprotective elements that are sex-dependent. For
instance, E2 treatment prior to challenging mice with neurotoxic METH doses reduces the
amount of dopamine depletion in the striatum of OVX female mice, an effect not observed
for male mice [259].

The ability of ER/E2 interactions to enhance nicotine reward also includes dopaminer-
gic and glutamatergic transmission along mesolimbic systems. Within the NAc, multiple
dendritic spines found on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) receive dopamine and glutamate
inputs [260]. Dopamine input originates from the VTA, and glutamatergic inputs derive
from the PFC, hippocampus, and amygdala [261]. The necks of dendritic spines receive
input from dopamine projections, while spine heads receive glutamatergic input [262]. Fol-
lowing nicotine exposure, nAChRs activate and stimulate excitatory projections to the NAc,
including those of dopaminergic producing neurons from the VTA [263]. This process pro-
motes drug-induced neuro-plastic events in MSNs such as dendritic growth and synaptic
formation. However, females may experience an increased sensitivity to estradiol-induced
plasticity, given that women display higher synaptic spine densities within the NAc than

Genes 2022, 13, 892

14 of 27

men [264]. Additionally, women display a higher concentration of E2 in the NAc, along
with a wider distribution of E2 in multiple neurons compared to men [264]. Moreover, in
female rats, E2 stimulates greater nicotine-induced dopamine release within the striatum,
an effect not observed in male rats [138]. Interestingly, nicotine and its metabolite cotinine
can prevent aromatase activity causing the inhibition of E2 syntheses, a process known to
occur within the brain [265]. In addition, nicotine can inhibit ERE binding capacity within
the CNS [266]. Thus, the effect of E2-ER interactions on nicotine reward most likely involves
membrane-bound ER and disrupted associations in intracellular cascades. The observation
that OVX female rats demonstrate diminished nicotine IVSA [133] is also of interest, given
that OVX procedures cause the downregulation of ERβ in the NAc and VTA [140]. Similar
to the partial recovery of nicotine SA in OVX rats following E2 treatment [133], decreased
NAc ERβ levels are also recuperated in OVX rats following E2 treatment [140].

9. Estrogen Receptor and HDAC Interactions

Given the limited literature on the effects of psychostimulant exposure and cellular
adaptations involving E2 and HDAC interactions, the following section provides a brief
discussion covering HDACs-ER associations within the scope of cancer research. Multiple
HDAC family members are implicated as therapeutic targets for the treatment of tumor
growth [267]. This research branch has led to an accumulation of data that characterizes the
interplay between ERs and HDACs, given their regulatory roles over gene expression [268].
For example, in human breast cancer cells, ERα recruits HDAC1 and reduces p53-mediated
transcription [269]. In addition, ERα recruits NCoR and SMRT, resulting in transcriptional
silencing, a process indicating ER-HDAC3 associations [269]. In agreement with the latter
observation, ERα links with HDAC3 and forms a repressive HDAC3/ERα complex [270].
These ﬁndings indicate that ERs can recruit HDACs and stimulate their silencing activity.
However, not all ER-HDAC interactions result in transcriptional repression. For example,
HDAC6 can bind onto the AF-2 domain of ERα and form an HDAC6/ER complex that
deacetylates tubulin [271]. Several HDAC family members also regulate the activity of ERs.
For instance, HDAC1 interacts with the AF-2 domain and reduces ER-mediated transcrip-
tion in breast cancer cells [272]. Additionally, HDAC4 suppresses the transcriptional activity
of nuclear ERα in an E2-dependent and independent manner [273]. Similarly, HDAC7 and
HDAC9 can lower the expression and transcriptional activity of ERα within breast cancer
cells [274,275]. These ﬁndings indicate that, although ERs recruit the epigenetic silencing
actions of HDACs, HDACs can modulate the pro-transcriptional properties of ERs.

This notion is further sustained by studies using HDACi to examine the effects of
deacetylated ERs in cancer cells. For example, TSA treatment enhances ER-mediated
transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells [276]. Treating breast cancer cells with TSA
also induces the nuclear translocation of ERβ, suggesting an increase in transcriptional
functionality [276]. In corroboration with the latter observation, treating glioblastomas with
panobinostat or romidepsin (two HDACi) upregulates the expression and promotes the
activation of ERβ [277]. Furthermore, exposing T5 human cancer cells to E2 results in the
rapid acetylation of core histones, a process associated with reduced HDAC activity [278].
However, treating these cells with tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen cancer medication, results in
transcriptional silencing via the recruitment of multiple HDAC-containing complexes [279].
Thus, in the absence of HDAC activation, it is likely that E2 facilitates cellular growth
through histone accessibility and ER-induced transcription.

Related to the notion, E2 promotes synaptogenesis and enhances pro-neuro plastic
processes associated with memory formation [52,280]. For instance, within the hippocam-
pus, E2-ER interactions increase synaptic protein immunoreactivity, enhance dendritic
spine density, and stimulate synaptic button outgrowth [281]. Because E2 levels ﬂuctu-
ate in females, these processes may represent an intracellular environment conducive
to sex-dependent transient neuronal plasticity and structural expansion. Indeed, while
men typically have larger gray matter volumes within the hippocampus, women undergo
hippocampal volume increases during the late follicular phase [282], a period of relatively

Genes 2022, 13, 892

15 of 27

high levels of E2. In agreement with the latter observation, converging lines of data from
neuroimaging studies report that ovarian E2 release drives structural neuro-plastic expan-
sion within the hippocampus, hypothalamus, NAc, and amygdala [48], all brain regions
associated with the addiction process. Evidence from animal research further demonstrates
that dendritic spine densities on MSNs are enhanced within the NAc of female compared
to male rodents [283]. Female rats also have more dopaminergic neurons in the VTA and
display greater dopamine transmission in the striatum, including dopaminergic release,
receptor density, and binding capacity, compared to males [254]. Interestingly, varying
levels of E2 inﬂuence membrane-bound ER expression. Speciﬁcally, the expression levels of
both ERs increase during estrus and lower during proestrus [284].

Considering the evidence described above, a plausible mechanism may exist whereby
ER-driven synaptic stimulation ensues the strengthening of memory consolidation for drug-
associated cues in a sex-dependent manner. This process most likely involves periods of
histone accessibility through PTMs and disrupted HDAC activity following drug exposure.
In this context, unabated ER-mediation transcription and cyclical E2 ﬂuctuations might
further promote a neuro-plastic environment that potentiates drug reward in females.
Based on the molecular mechanisms reviewed herein, Figure 1 illustrates cytoplasmic and
nuclear E2-ER interactions that induce transcriptional activity. As previously discussed,
E2 is associated with the enhancement of hedonic stimuli [51] and facilitates the rewarding
aspects of psychostimulants [128]. However, additional investigations are necessary to
fully clarify the associations between ERs, HDAC activity, and their inﬂuence on substance
abuse vulnerability.

10. Concluding Remarks and Future Considerations

In conclusion, clinical studies have identiﬁed differences in substance abuse between
men and women. Animal research has provided data indicating that, amongst other
physiological factors, E2 has a signiﬁcant role in mediating these sex differences. In addition,
HDACs contribute to the development of addiction-like behaviors through the reversible
accessibility and restriction of histones. This process includes epigenetic regulation of
transcriptional codes following drug exposure. Based on the evidence examined in this
review, it is speculated that sex differences in substance abuse might involve HDAC-ER
interactions, which alter gene expression along neurological pathways associated with
addiction. E2 ﬂuctuations may further cyclically inﬂuence hazardous drug use for females
within this framework. Moreover, Class II HDACs represent prominent targets to examine,
given their dynamic responses following psychostimulant exposure and regulation over ER-
mediated transcription. Altogether, this review supports the notion that substance abuse is
a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by intracellular responses that may be
distinct for each sex. The value of integrating female-speciﬁc ﬁndings in addiction research
is also highlighted, given that sex-based comparisons in epigenetic adaptations remain
relatively unexplored. This issue is important, as a better understanding of the mechanisms
that mediate sex differences in substance abuse is needed to develop gender-appropriate
treatment practices for patients seeking rehabilitation and recovery options.
