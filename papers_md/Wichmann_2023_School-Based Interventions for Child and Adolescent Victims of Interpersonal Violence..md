Abstract
Background: Interpersonal violence against children and adolescents can affect their mental health and functioning in the long
term. To reduce mental health problems in children and adolescents, school-based mental health interventions have been
shown to be beneﬁcial. A review of school-based interventions designed to mitigate posttraumatic symptoms after inter-
personal violence is lacking to date. Methods: We searched for original studies published in English or German until November
2019 in 6 electronic databases. Supplementary search strategies to reduce publication bias were implemented. Peer-reviewed
original studies assessing school-based interventions for children and adolescents under the age of 21 after interpersonal
violence were included. Relevant data was extracted, synthesised and assessed qualitatively. The methodological quality of
included studies was assessed. Results: Of 5,021 unduplicated publications, 15 studies met eligibility criteria. The included
studies were almost exclusively conducted in the USA; over half utilised a randomised-controlled design. Studies mainly
focussed on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or depression. In all studies, implemented interventions partially or fully
mitigated posttraumatic symptoms. Nine school-based interventions, ﬁve of which were based on cognitive behavioural therapy
(CBT), were identiﬁed. School staff were often involved in intervention implementation besides mental health professionals.
Conclusions: School-based interventions can be beneﬁcial to reduce mental health problems in children and adolescents after
interpersonal violence. Trained school staff aided by mental health professionals can implement trauma-informed practices at
school. While school-based interventions may be a feasible way to provide children and adolescents with accessible mental
health care, further research on school-based trauma interventions outside the USA is necessary.

Introduction

During their lives, children and adolescents can be exposed to
a myriad of adverse childhood experiences, including but not
limited to interpersonal violence (i.e. physical and emotional
abuse or neglect, sexual, domestic or community violence, or
violent experiences during war and ﬂight). These experiences
can be summarised as interpersonal (Maercker & Hecker,
2016) or complex trauma (van der Kolk, 2005). Research
has shown that refugee minors, in particular those unac-
companied by adults, are especially affected by interpersonal
violence not only in their countries of origin, but also during
ﬂight and after arriving in host countries (e.g. Metzner et al.,
2016). For example, children of asylum seekers in Germany
reported having witnessed physical violence (41%) and
having experienced violence at home against other family
members (26%), physical attacks against the child (15%),
physical child abuse at home (14%) or sexual violence (5%)
(Ruf et al., 2010). A Dutch study revealed that compared to
accompanied refugee and immigrant minors, unaccompanied
refugee adolescents were more often exposed to physical

abuse (63% vs. 23%) or sexual violence (20% vs. 8%) and
had more often witnessed physical violence (72% vs. 47%)
(Bean et al., 2007). Interpersonal violence against children
and adolescents is however a problem independent of ethnic
background, war or conﬂict. A global review of meta-
analyses reported lifetime prevalence rates for sexual
abuse (13%), physical abuse (23%), emotional abuse (36%),
physical neglect (16%) and emotional neglect (18%) ac-
cording to self-report (Stoltenborgh et al., 2015). For Europe,
a systematic review reported median prevalence rates for

sexual abuse (13%), physical abuse (12%), emotional or
psychological abuse (22%), and neglect (27%) in childhood
(Moody et al., 2018). As an example of a western in-
dustrialised country with no recent war exposure, an as-
sessment of a representative German sample of 2510
participants aged 14 to 94 resulted in prevalence rates
for moderate to extreme emotional abuse (7%), physical
abuse (7%), sexual abuse (8%), emotional neglect (13%)
and physical neglect (22%) during childhood (Witt et al.,
2017).

Psychosocial Consequences of Interpersonal Trauma in
Children and Adolescents

Experiencing complex interpersonal
trauma can impact
children and adolescents’ physical and mental health long-
term into adulthood, putting them at higher risk, for example,
for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depressive dis-
orders, anxiety disorders, behavioural or conduct disorders,
substance abuse,
risky sexual behaviour and sexually
transmitted infections, chronic disease (e.g. obesity) as well
as suicidal or self-harming behaviour, with a dose–response
relationship (Hughes et al., 2017; Norman et al., 2012;
Perez et al., 2018; Witt et al., 2019). Research has also
shown that compared to other types of trauma, interpersonal
long-term trauma can result in more (potentially chronic)
impairment (Maercker, 2013). For example, higher one-
year and lifetime prevalence of PTSD was reported for
sexual violence in adulthood (37–50%), child sexual abuse
(31–35%), war-related experiences (25–39%) or child ne-
glect (22%) compared to other types of trauma (e.g. acci-
dents: 8–13%, witnessing accidents or violence: 2–7%, ﬁre
or natural disasters: 0–5%) (Maercker, 2013; Maercker &
Hecker, 2016). A meta-analytic review of 47 studies re-
ported a high prevalence for PTSD (35%), emotional and
behavioural problems (25%), depression (21%), anxiety
disorders (15%) as well as suicidal ideation and behaviour
(5%) in 24,786 refugee and asylum-seeking youths residing
in European countries (Kien et al., 2018). In accordance to
the ‘domains of impairment in children exposed to complex
trauma’ described by Cook et al. (2005, p. 392), inter-
personal trauma in childhood was also found to be a risk
factor for aggressive, impulsive and problem behaviour, as
well as delinquent or criminal behaviour (Hughes et al.,
2017; Jimenez et al., 2016; Perez et al., 2018). Especially
relevant from an educational point of view, childhood in-
terpersonal trauma can impact children and adolescents’
academic functioning and outcomes, for example resulting
in attention and concentration problems, educational un-
derachievement or learning disabilities (e.g. language and
literacy skills), discipline problems and conﬂicts (e.g. with
peers or teachers), school changes, repeating forms1, ab-
senteeism, or special education needs (Elklit et al., 2018;
Holmes et al., 2018; Jimenez et al., 2016; Larson et al.,
2017).

The Role of Schools in Providing Mental Health Care
following Trauma

Children and adolescents spend a majority of their time at
school and can be reached there independent of their ethnic,
socioeconomic or familial backgrounds. Especially for chil-
dren and adolescents who may suffer from a loss of trust in
caregivers, a loss of a sense of self or low self-esteem fol-
lowing complex interpersonal trauma (Cook et al., 2005; van
der Kolk, 2005), school staff (e.g. teachers), can serve as
important attachment ﬁgures, provide support and help their
pupils to re-learn trust in others. Therefore, schools can serve
not only as practical locations to implement and provide in-
terventions and mental health care services, but also as places
of resilience (Gerke et al., 2019). For example, in a German
survey of people who had suffered sexual violence and
contacted a helpline for sexual abuse, participants reported
that their well-being was positively affected by their teachers’
reactions and support following disclosure, and that an on-
going interest in their experience was perceived as helpful
(Gerke et al., 2019).

In recent years, the beneﬁt of school-based interventions or
trauma-focussed practices for children and adolescents has
been assessed in systematic reviews (Rolfsnes & Idsoe, 2011;
Yohannan & Carlson, 2019; Zakszeski et al., 2017). Rolfsnes
and Idsoe (2011) for example assessed the effectiveness of
school-based interventions for children and adolescents suf-
fering from PTSD after traumatic events in a meta-analysis of
19 international studies. Their results showed not only that
school-based interventions were effective in reducing PTSD
symptoms, but also that school staff (e.g. counsellors or
teachers) were able to successfully implement the interven-
tions, and that intervention access and completion rate was
higher within the school setting compared for example to a
clinical setting (Rolfsnes & Idsoe, 2011). Zakszeski et al.
(2017) conducted a systematic review of 39 international
studies and found that
trauma-focussed practices within
schools largely led to mitigation of posttraumatic symptoms
following trauma exposure.
and internalising problems
Yohannan and Carlson (2019) assessed 41 international
evaluation studies of school-based interventions, concluding
that these interventions can help to mitigate posttraumatic
outcomes in children after traumatic events. These systematic
reviews however did not restrict
the trauma exposure to
speciﬁc events, instead including all types of trauma (e.g.
natural disasters) and thus had very heterogenous samples.

Aims of This Systematic Review

Past research has shown the beneﬁt of school-based services
for children and adolescents following trauma exposure.
However, a comprehensive systematic review on school-
based interventions for children and adolescents targeting
posttraumatic outcomes speciﬁcally after interpersonal vio-
lence is lacking to our knowledge. With view to the potentially

severe and long-term mental health outcomes following
complex interpersonal trauma, there appears to be a substantial
gap in research. The current systematic review aims to close
this gap by identifying and describing school-based inter-
ventions designed to mitigate psychosocial posttraumatic
symptoms in children and adolescents after interpersonal
violence.

Methods

The methods of this systematic review are based on guidelines
for implementation and analysis of systematic literature re-
views (e.g. Higgins et al., 2019; Moher et al., 2009).

Search Strategy

Using the psychological, medical and pedagogical literature
databases PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, ISI
Web of Science (subcategory Social Science) and ERIC,
original studies published until 20 November 2019 were
systematically searched. The search results were limited to
journal articles in English or German language. An overview
of English and German search terms used in the database
search is found in Table 1. The search included experiences of
war as well as refugee samples, as these children and ado-
lescents were regarded as relevant samples due to the range
and prevalence of interpersonal violence experiences in the
context of war (Bean et al., 2007; Metzner et al., 2016; Ruf
et al., 2010). In an effort to reduce publication bias, a sup-
plementary literature search was conducted: reference lists of
studies and literature reviews were searched
relevant

manually, Google Scholar was utilised for a manual search,
and authors of included publications were contacted for
further relevant studies that may have been missed via sys-
tematic database and supplementary search.

Selection Process

The systematic database search yielded 6,237 results, with an
additional 50 publications identiﬁed via supplementary
search. After removal of duplicates, 5,021 publications re-
mained (see Figure 1). Two independent reviewers (graduated
psychologists) screened the remaining publications for con-
formity with inclusion criteria using title, abstract and key-
words (see Table 2).

After screening, the full-texts of 164 publications were
considered eligible for inclusion into the systematic review
and assessed by the independent reviewers regarding their
conformity with inclusion criteria (see Figure 1). The reviewer
assessments matched in 80% of publications, resulting in a
moderate inter-rater reliability (κ = .56; Altman, 1999). The
independent reviewers were not blind to authors and journal of
the assessed publications in either step. In cases of differing
assessments, the publication in question was discussed until
consensus was reached. In cases of publications examining the
same sample, only the publication with most relevant data for
the current systematic review was included into data synthesis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

After reviewing the full-texts against the inclusion criteria, 15
studies were included into the systematic review. Using a

structured table for data synthesis, two independent reviewers
ﬁrst extracted and coded relevant information for describing
the studies included: country where the study was conducted,
methodology (e.g. study design, data collection, control
group, posttraumatic outcomes assessed), sample character-
istics (e.g. size, age and gender distribution, trauma exposure),
and intervention outcome. Next, the independent reviewers
extracted and coded information about the school-based in-
terventions described in the studies included: name and ac-
ronym, studies utilising the intervention (or a modiﬁcation
thereof), and intervention characteristics (e.g. primary goal,
implementation at
target population, type of intervention,

school, duration, contents or components). In case of mixed-
methods studies, only quantitative methods and data were
extracted. If the information extracted from the studies dif-
fered between the ﬁrst and second reviewer, a third reviewer
was consulted. No authors of studies included were contacted
for further information or data.

Methodological Quality Assessment

The methodological quality of the studies included was as-
sessed by two independent
reviewers using the Mixed
Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT; Hong et al., 2018).

Notes. No inclusion criteria were speciﬁed for Comparators, as both controlled and non-controlled study designs were of interest for this systematic review.

The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The MMAT (Hong et al.,
2018) was developed for methodological quality assessment
of empirical studies included in systematic reviews com-
prising different study designs. Overall, ﬁve types of study
designs can be assessed using the MMAT: qualitative,
quantitative randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quantitative
non-randomised, quantitative descriptive and mixed methods.
Methodological quality is assessed ﬁrst using two screening
questions (applicable to all study designs). If one or both
screening questions are not met, further assessment ‘may not
be feasible or appropriate’ (Hong et al., 2018, p. 2). Second,
methodological quality is assessed with ﬁve quality criteria
particular to each study design. Due to the current systematic
review’s focus on intervention studies, quality criteria for only
two relevant study designs (quantitative RCTs and quantita-
tive non-randomised) were applied. For quantitative RCTs,
following quality criteria were assessed: (1) ‘Is randomi[s]
ation appropriately performed?’, (2) ‘Are the groups com-
parable at baseline?’, (3) ‘Are there complete outcome data?’,

(4) ‘Are outcome assessors blinded to the intervention pro-
vided?’, and (5) ‘Did the participants adhere to the assigned
intervention?’ (Hong et al., 2018, p. 2). For quantitative non-
randomised studies, following quality criteria were assessed:
(1) ‘Are the participants representative of the target pop-
ulation?’, (2) ‘Are measurements appropriate regarding both
the outcome and intervention (or exposure)?’, (3) ‘Are there
complete outcome data?’, (4) ‘Are the confounders accounted
for in the design and analysis?’, and (5) ‘During the study
period, is the intervention administered (or exposure occurred)
as intended?’ (Hong et al., 2018, p. 2).

Methodological quality assessment procedure. The independent
reviewers assessed the quality of included studies using ﬁrst
the screening questions for all study categories, and second the
ﬁve quality criteria particular to each study design. In case of
mixed-methods studies, only the quality of quantitative
methodology was assessed. Disagreements in assessment
were resolved through discussion. The screening questions

6
1748 

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 0(0)
TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 24(3)

and quality criteria were assessed as ‘met’, ‘not met’ or ‘not
enough information available’, resulting in a global assessment
of methodological quality (high, medium, low). Both screening
questions had to be met; if one or more screening questions
were assessed as ‘not met’ or ‘not enough information avail-
able’, the study quality was immediately judged as ‘low’, re-
gardless of quality criteria assessment. After screening, the
included studies’ methodological quality was further assessed
using the ﬁve quality criteria, resulting in overall ratings of high
(all quality criteria met), medium (3–4 quality criteria met) or
low (0–2 quality criteria met) methodological quality.

Results

Overall, k = 15 publications were included into the systematic
review. All publications passed methodological quality
screening. Subsequently, study quality was rated high for k = 2
studies, medium for k = 9 studies and low for k = 4 studies (see
Table 3). The characteristics and reported results of the studies
included are presented below.

Study Characteristics

The included intervention studies were published between
1999 and 2019 and comprise k = 13 quantitative and k = 2
mixed-methods studies. Over half of the studies included (k =
9) conducted an RCT; a pre-post study design was chosen in
k = 5 studies. Of the k = 10 studies including a control group,
almost all (k = 9) utilised a waitlist control condition (see Table
4). The majority of studies was conducted in the USA (k = 12;
80%), with k = 1 study each conducted in the Palestinian
territories, the UK and Sri Lanka (see Table 4).

Sample Characteristics

Only counting intervention groups, sample sizes ranged from
n = 12 to n = 350, with a total of n = 1369 children and
adolescents receiving treatment interventions included across
all studies (information available for k = 14 studies). The
percentage of female intervention group participants ranged
from 33% to 100% and was unknown for k = 1 study.
Intervention group participants were on average 12.1 years
old (information available for k = 11 studies). Only k = 4
studies reported age ranges for their intervention groups,
resulting in an overall range of 6–21 years (see Table 4).
The study samples included were generally exposed to
violence (k = 6 studies) or child endangerment (k = 6
studies). Samples in k = 4 studies had experienced war and
conﬂict in their countries of origin (Palestinian Territories,
Barron et al., 2013; Sri Lanka, Tol et al., 2012) or were
forced to ﬂee or emigrate from their countries of origin
(Beehler et al., 2012; Ehntholt et al., 2005) (see Table 4).
The refugee samples were ethnically diverse, originating
from ﬁve (Ehntholt et al., 2005) to nine (Beehler et al.,
2012) different regions.

Assessed Posttraumatic Outcomes

Almost all studies assessed PTSD (k = 13) or depression (k =
10) as posttraumatic outcomes. Emotional or behavioural
problems were assessed in k =7, anxiety in k = 5 and global
functioning in k = 4 studies. In k = 6 studies, other post-
traumatic outcomes (e.g. coping behaviour, substance use,
grief, global mental health) were assessed. Furthermore, one
study (Barron et al., 2013) assessed school performance as
outcome (see Table 4). Instruments most frequently used to
measure PTSD symptoms were the Childhood PTSD
Symptom Scale (Foa, Treadwell, Johnson & Feeny, 2001) (k
= 6) and the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index (Pynoos et al.,
1998) (k = 4). Depression was mainly measured using the
Children’s Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1992) (k = 6) and
the Depression Self-Rating Scale (Birleson, 1981) (k = 3).
Self- and third-party-report versions of the Strengths and
Difﬁculties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997) were most
frequently used to measure emotional and behavioural
problems (k = 4).

Reported Intervention Outcomes

While not all
implemented interventions signiﬁcantly
improved all posttraumatic outcomes, positive interven-
tion effects (fully or partially signiﬁcant, or approaching
signiﬁcance) were reported in the majority of included
studies. For PTSD symptoms, 92% of relevant studies
reported full (k = 7) or partial (k = 5) mitigation, while
depressive symptoms were mitigated fully (k = 4) or
partially (k = 3) in 70% of relevant studies. Emotional and
behavioural problems and anxiety fully or partially im-
proved in about 60% of relevant studies (k = 4 and k = 3,
respectively). Functioning fully improved as a result of the
implemented intervention in three of k = 4 relevant studies
(see Table 4).

Description of Implemented Interventions

An overview of implemented interventions across all studies
included is presented in Table 5.

Overall, nine different interventions were implemented
across all k = 15 studies. Almost all interventions had no
gender restrictions, the only exception being Project Chrysalis
(Brown & Block, 2001) which solely addressed females who
had experienced physical, emotional or sexual abuse. Two
further interventions however were implemented in all-female
samples (Psychodrama Groups, Carbonell & Parteleno-
Barehmi, 1999; HTL, Crosby et al., 2019). Of the k = 4
studies assessing war- and ﬂight-related trauma, all
im-
plemented interventions speciﬁcally addressed war-related
trauma or culture-sensitive needs, and k = 2 studies
(Beehler et al., 2012; Ehntholt et al., 2005) implemented their
interventions in ethnically diverse refugee or immigrant
samples.

The majority of interventions was manualised or stand-
ardised (6/9) or integrated a manualised or standardised
component (2/9); for a short description of the interventions
see Table 5. In k = 6 studies, the authors implemented an
adapted (e.g. according to local needs and resources) or
translated version of a manualised intervention. Five inter-
ventions in k = 11 studies were based on (trauma-focussed)
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or used CBT-based
components
(see Table 5), of which k = 5 studies
achieved complete mitigation of posttraumatic outcomes
(see Table 4). The primary goals of the interventions im-
plemented were largely building resilience and coping
strategies (6/9), mitigation of posttraumatic symptoms and
problems (e.g. PTSD, depression, anxiety, psychological
distress) (5/9) and improving functioning (2/9). About half
(i.e. ﬁve) of the interventions were implemented as extra-
curricular sessions during the school day (k = 11 studies),
while one intervention consisted of counselling and support
at school (Beehler et al., 2012) and another implemented
trauma-sensitive teaching at school using teacher trainings
(Crosby et al., 2019). One intervention described by Perry
implemented both trauma-sensitive
and Daniels (2016)
practices within the school and extracurricular clinical ser-
vices. Overall, four interventions (k = 9 studies) utilised
group settings with individual components, three interven-
tions (k = 4 studies) utilised pure group settings, and one
intervention (k = 1 study; Carrion et al., 2013) offered purely
individual treatment (see Table 5). The implemented inter-
ventions’ duration varied, with the number of sessions
necessary ranging between 5 and 20. One intervention
(Project Chrysalis; Brown & Block, 2001) allowed for pupils
to participate as (in-)frequently as per their needs throughout
one school year. The persons implementing the interventions
across the included studies mainly comprised mental health
professionals (e.g. clinicians, psychologists, counsellors,
therapists). Five interventions described in k = 11 studies
included school personnel in implementation, two of which
utilising trauma-sensitive teaching and practices (Crosby
et al., 2019; Perry & Daniels, 2016) were implemented by
teachers within the school or had teachers participating in the
implementation process (see Table 5).

Two interventions were implemented in more than one
study: Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT; Smith et al.,
2000) (k = 2 studies) and Cognitive Behavioral Interven-
tion for Trauma in Schools (CBITS; Jaycox, 2004) (k = 6
studies, with k = 1 further study utilising CBITS as an in-
tervention component). One study implementing TRT each
achieved full (Barron et al., 2013) or partial (Ehntholt et al.,
2005) mitigation of posttraumatic outcomes (see Table 4).
Three studies (Hoover et al., 2018; Kataoka et al., 2003; Perry
& Daniels, 2016) implementing CBITS or using CBITS as an
intervention component achieved complete mitigation of
posttraumatic outcomes, while four studies achieved partial
mitigation (Goodkind et al., 2010; L. H. Jaycox et al., 2009;
Santiago et al., 2018; Stein et al., 2003) (see Table 4).

Discussion

The current systematic review aimed at identifying and de-
scribing school-based interventions designed to mitigate
posttraumatic outcomes in children and adolescents after in-
terpersonal violence. The results show that school-based in-
terventions can be a beneﬁcial approach in improving
posttraumatic symptoms, especially PTSD, after complex
interpersonal trauma, with all intervention studies described in
this review achieving partial or full symptom mitigation for at
least one posttraumatic outcome.

Discussion of Current Findings

Similar to ﬁndings of previous reviews (Rolfsnes & Idsoe,
2011; Stratford et al., 2020; Yohannan & Carlson, 2019;
Zakszeski et al., 2017), the majority of studies implemented a
CBT-based intervention with CBITS being the most common
approach. The included studies rarely assessed only speciﬁc
traumatic experiences, but rather cumulative and complex
experiences of general violence in the children and adoles-
cents’ environment, child endangerment or war-related
trauma, with a particular focus on PTSD and depression as
posttraumatic outcomes. Although outcomes like anxiety,
academic and global functioning or emotional and behavioural
problems have been assessed in some of the included studies,
in view of the wide range of psychological, behavioural and
socio-emotional consequences complex interpersonal trauma
can have on children and adolescents (e.g. Elklit et al., 2018;
Holmes et al., 2018; Hughes et al., 2017; Perez et al., 2018),
research on school-based interventions targeting these other
posttraumatic outcomes seems to be insufﬁcient. With the
addition of Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) into the current In-
ternational Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD-11; World Health
Organization, 2020), a diagnosis that takes behavioural, socio-
emotional and cognitive symptoms speciﬁc to complex trauma
into account has become available. As C-PTSD is still a very
recent addition,
increased research on this diagnosis and
possible effects of (school-based) interventions is to be ex-
pected in the upcoming years, prospectively adding to em-
pirical knowledge about a broader range of posttraumatic
symptoms. As perhaps the most interesting ﬁnding pertaining
to school-based intervention research, in accordance with the
ﬁndings of Rolfsnes and Idsoe (2011), trained school-based
personnel (e.g. school counsellors, teachers) aided by mental
health professionals were involved in the implementation
process in almost all studies, for example establishing trauma-
informed practices at school (Crosby et al., 2019; Perry &
Daniels, 2016). An overview of critical ﬁndings is provided in
Table 6.

Diversity and generalisability. The current ﬁndings indicate that
the interventions described in the included studies are gender-
inclusive and able to address samples with diverse needs. As
mentioned above, with the exception of Project Chrysalis

⁃ The current ﬁndings should not be generalised for populations outside the USA.
⁃ School-based interventions can be beneﬁcial for the reduction of posttraumatic symptoms in children and adolescents after interpersonal

violence.

⁃ CBT-based interventions seem to be the most common approach.
⁃ School-based intervention research seems to put a large focus on PTSD and depression as posttraumatic outcomes.
⁃ Central aims of school-based interventions seem to be mitigating posttraumatic symptoms and building resilience or coping strategies.
⁃ Trained school personnel supported by mental health professionals can successfully implement interventions aimed at mitigating

posttraumatic symptoms in children and adolescents after interpersonal violence.

(Brown & Block, 2001), no intervention had gender restric-
tions. Furthermore, there was a broad range of interpersonal
trauma experiences in the samples assessed, with only two
studies (Brown & Block, 2001; Crosby et al., 2019) focussing
on speciﬁc types of interpersonal violence. Interventions ad-
dressing war- and ﬂight-related trauma generally had culture- or
war-sensitive content and were in part implemented in ethni-
cally diverse samples (e.g. Beehler et al., 2012; Ehntholt et al.,
2005). While these ﬁndings might seem to point to a broad
applicability of the interventions described in the included
studies, one factor limiting a generalisation of the current
ﬁndings needs to be considered: consistent with previous
ﬁndings (e.g. Yohannan & Carlson, 2019; Zakszeski et al.,
2017) the overwhelming majority of research was based in the
USA. Given the US-based Trauma and Learning Policy Ini-
tiative (TLPI), ﬁrst introduced in 2005 and further developed
into a framework for action in 2013 (Massachusetts Advocates
for Children, MAC, 2009, 2013), this ﬁnding is not surprising.
The TLPI is in its core a research-based project to reform and
develop schools, introducing trauma-informed practices and
teaching (MAC, 2009, 2013) and consequently impacting US-
American policy, practice and research. While the USA has
effectively become a pioneer in school-based trauma-informed
practices and research, there is a dearth of school-based in-
tervention research targeting consequences of complex inter-
personal trauma in other parts of the world. As such, taking
global differences in populations, mental health care services
and school systems into account, the ﬁndings of the current
review cannot be generalised for populations outside the USA.

Excluded studies. During the selection process of studies to be
included in data extraction and synthesis, the two reviewers
agreed in 80% of assessments, resulting in only moderate
inter-rater reliability. This can be attributed to an initially high
level of disagreement about trauma exposure as described by
inclusion criterion 2 and exclusion criterion 1, accounting for
64% of all disagreements. Initially, inclusion criterion 2 was
determined as the population being exposed to at least one
interpersonal traumatic experience without specifying what
percentage of the sample had to have experienced interper-
sonal violence. This deﬁnition emerged as not precise enough
for clear decision-making, even when taking exclusion

criterion 1 (traumatic experience without interpersonal com-
ponent) into account: The study samples had experienced a
range of traumatic events, including non-interpersonal trauma
(e.g. shelling, bombings, accidental injury or death of a loved
one). For many studies, it was not evident to the reviewers
whether interpersonal violence was the predominant traumatic
event, in turn leading to disagreements in their decisions. Thus,
inclusion criterion 2 was speciﬁed during the data extraction
and synthesis process in order to create a more homogenous
improve decision-making and to increase
overall sample,
comparability of included study samples. Consequently, 13
studies had to be retroactively excluded from data extraction
and synthesis because they (a) did not provide enough infor-
mation to judge whether interpersonal violence was the pre-
dominant traumatic experience, or (b) fell below the 50% cut-
off now deﬁned in inclusion criterion 2 (see Table 7).

Unfortunately, although the strict selection criterion re-
garding trauma exposure provided clearer decisions and
certainty that at least 50% of the assessed sample had ex-
perienced at least one type of interpersonal violence, the
exclusion of these otherwise relevant studies also meant an
omission of some important ﬁndings and a restriction of re-
gional diversity in the current systematic review. More spe-
ciﬁcally, the excluded studies largely assessed war- and ﬂight-
related trauma (12/13) and were conducted in a range of
different countries, that is, USA (3/13), Canada, Palestinian
Territories and Bosnia and Herzegovina (2/13 each), as well as
the UK, Australia, Israel and Lebanon (1/13 each), with
English-speaking countries again dominating research (8/13).
While, similar to the included studies, most excluded studies
assessed PTSD (9/13) and depression (7/13) as posttraumatic
outcomes, there were also a number focussing on emotional
and behavioural problems (5/13). Regrettably, a large number
of interventions implemented by teachers (7/13) had to be
excluded, as well as all interventions incorporated into the
school day (5/13) as opposed to extracurricular sessions.
Furthermore, all studies achieving no mitigation of post-
traumatic symptoms (4/13) were excluded.

Future research. Due to the current systematic review’s ob-
jective and resulting heterogeneity of studies as well as
samples included into data extraction and synthesis, a meta-

Table 8. Summary of implications for Practice, Policy and Research.

Implications

Practice

⁃ School-based trauma interventions can supplement regular mental health care for traumatised children and adolescents and

reduce barriers to care.

Policy

⁃ Trained school staff can help to support traumatised children and adolescents.
⁃ Necessary resources, structures and guidelines must be put into place (e.g. ﬁnancing, trauma-sensitive teacher training, inter-

agency cooperation).

Research ⁃ More school-based intervention studies outside the USA and using RCTs are necessary (e.g. regarding implementation in diverse

school systems).

⁃ Meta-analyses are necessary to assess the effectiveness of school-based interventions regarding complex interpersonal trauma.
⁃ Meta-analyses could focus on children and adolescents generally exposed to war or adverse childhood experience.

analysis was not feasible. As a result, no conclusions can be
drawn regarding the actual effectiveness of school-based in-
terventions for posttraumatic symptoms following interper-
sonal violence. As shown by the current systematic review, a
strict criterion regarding (interpersonal) trauma exposure can
moreover lead to the exclusion of a range of relevant inter-
vention studies – in fact, trauma exposure was the criterion
most studies were excluded by (see Figure 1). In situations
where children and adolescents are exposed to war or com-
munity violence, however, interpersonal violence is rarely a
singular event but rather goes hand in hand with a myriad of
other potentially traumatic experiences. Additionally, in a
heterogenous school or classroom setting, diverse experiences
of the pupils targeted by the intervention are to be expected.
As such, necessary meta-analyses on comparable school-
based trauma interventions (e.g. manualised, CBT-based in-
terventions or teacher trainings) could examine populations of
children and adolescents who have experienced trauma

globally related to war or ﬂight (including e.g. bombings or
shelling) or adverse childhood experiences as a whole (in-
cluding e.g. incarceration or mental health problems of a
parent, drug abuse at home), potentially creating more ho-
mogenous and comparable samples rather than including the
samples based on experiences of interpersonal violence only.

Limitations

In addition to the aforementioned lack of generalisability of
the current ﬁndings outside the USA, following limitations
have to be considered when interpreting the results of this
systematic review. First, the database search and selection
process were limited to German and English language publi-
cations, quite possibly excluding relevant intervention studies
in other languages from the current systematic review. Second,
despite efforts to minimise publication bias and despite some
intervention studies achieving no signiﬁcant mitigation of

16

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 24(3)

posttraumatic outcomes being present in the retroactively ex-
cluded studies, a tendency to publish only ‘positive’ and sig-
niﬁcant results cannot be ruled out. While the current ﬁndings
indicate beneﬁts of school-based interventions for children and
adolescents after complex interpersonal trauma, one should be
careful not to overestimate this beneﬁt. Third, while a majority
of included studies implemented manualised or standardised
interventions, modiﬁcations to the interventions were made in
some cases according to the needs and local conditions in
participating schools, making statements about the beneﬁt of
these manualised interventions in their intended form difﬁcult
or even impossible. Fourth, 40% of included studies used a
single sample pre-post or non-randomised controlled study
design, and about one third of RCT-studies did not include a
follow-up assessment. Fifth, the comparability of included
studies may be limited by the sample compositions themselves
(e.g. age range very large or not reported, in part small sample
sizes, varying gender proportions). Sixth, the tool used for
assessment of methodological quality (MMAT, Hong et al.,
2018) was developed with a clinical or medical focus. However,
as none of the included studies were medical trials, their
methods were not reported with the necessary detail, resulting
in many assessments of ‘not enough information available’
especially with regards to RCTs. Consequently, study quality
was rated as medium or low for most studies. We nonetheless
chose to use the MMAT due to its capacity to assess meth-
odological quality of different study types within the same
systematic review. Last, as mentioned above, no meta-analysis
was conducted in view of the current review’s objectives and
resulting heterogeneity of included studies. However, a sys-
tematic review without meta-analysis can neither provide in-
sight about the actual effectiveness of intervention studies nor
compare the effectiveness of school-based interventions.

Strengths

Taking into account the limitations, the current systematic
review also shows a number of strengths. Most of the included
studies used a randomised-controlled design, almost all made
an effort to implement manualised or standardised interven-
tions or intervention components. The interventions were
generally gender-inclusive and addressed populations with a
broad range of interpersonal trauma experiences. The ﬁndings
show not only a beneﬁt of school-based interventions for a
range of posttraumatic outcomes, but also that trained school
staff is able to implement these interventions with support of
mental health professionals. In summary, the current sys-
tematic review adds to existing research and knowledge about
the possible beneﬁt of school-based mental health interven-
tions. Previous systematic reviews on school-based inter-
ventions had only assessed PTSD as posttraumatic outcome
(Rolfsnes & Idsoe, 2011) or included all types of trauma,
including non-interpersonal
(Rolfsnes & Idsoe, 2011;
Yohannan & Carlson, 2019; Zakszeski et al., 2017). Con-
sidering the broad range and severity of psychosocial and

health consequences of interpersonal violence (e.g. Jimenez
et al., 2016; Kien et al., 2018; Larson et al., 2017; Maercker,
2013; Norman et al., 2012), these ﬁndings imply not only that
school-based interventions may be beneﬁcial for the speciﬁc
sample of children and adolescents exposed to interpersonal
violence, but also that they can be used to address a range of
posttraumatic outcomes following interpersonal violence.

Conclusions

The most critical ﬁndings of the current systematic review are
that (a) school-based interventions can be feasible and ben-
eﬁcial for the mitigation of posttraumatic outcomes in children
trauma, and (b)
and adolescents following interpersonal
trained school personnel supported by mental health profes-
sionals are able to implement
trauma interventions and
trauma-informed practices at school (see Table 6). From these
central ﬁndings, several conclusions can be drawn regarding
practice, policy and research (summary in Table 8). In
Practice, research has shown that a number of structural and
personal barriers to regular mental health care exist for
children and adolescents (e.g. Colucci et al., 2015; Kowalski
et al., 2012; Larson et al., 2017; Metzner et al., 2016). Pro-
viding mental health care is not the primary role of schools.
However, as schools are the place most young people can be
reached, the implementation of trauma interventions and es-
pecially trauma-informed practices in schools seems to be a
promising approach to better connect educational and mental
health care systems, supplement regular mental health care
services and reduce barriers to care. Trained school staff (e.g.
teachers, school counsellors) could thus serve as a ﬁrst line of
contact for pupils who have experienced interpersonal vio-
lence. With view to Policy, the implementation of a trauma-
informed learning environment or school-based trauma ser-
vices requires at least stable ﬁnancing, cooperation between
mental health services and schools as well as sufﬁcient
knowledge in school staff. Surveys for example in Canada
(Weegar & Romano, 2019) and Germany (Ullrich &
Zimmermann, 2014) however have shown a lack of knowl-
edge, skills and training regarding trauma and interpersonal
violence in teachers. Structures and guidelines to improve
teacher training regarding trauma-sensitive practices, enable
inter-agency cooperation and to ensure ﬁnancial support
during this process can only be put into place by policymakers.
In Research, there is a need for school-based intervention
studies from more countries apart from the USA, especially
regarding the transferability and feasibility of (long-term)
implementation of school-based intervention approaches in
diverse school systems worldwide. In view of the large per-
centage (40%) of studies relying on pre-post or non-
randomised designs, more RCT studies are needed to eval-
uate school-based interventions. Meta-analytic systematic
reviews are necessary to assess the effectiveness of school-
based interventions for posttraumatic symptoms after inter-
personal violence in children and adolescents. However, as

Wichmann et al.
Wichmann et al.

shown above, the inclusion of study populations for (meta-
analytic) systematic reviews using an overly strict criterion for
interpersonal trauma exposure can lead to the exclusion of a
multitude of
relevant school-based intervention studies.
Therefore, future meta-analytic reviews that focus on pop-
ulations who have either experienced global war-related
trauma or adverse childhood experiences may further ex-
pand on existing knowledge about possible effects of school-
based interventions.
