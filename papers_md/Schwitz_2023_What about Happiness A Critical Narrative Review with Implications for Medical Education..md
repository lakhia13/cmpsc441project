ABSTRACT

Introduction:  Despite  abundant  scholarship  and  improvement  initiatives,  the  problem 
of physician wellbeing persists. One reason might be conceptual: the idea of ‘happiness’ 
is rare in this work. To explore how it might influence the conversation about physician 
wellbeing  in  medical  education,  we  conducted  a  critical  narrative  review  asking:  ‘How 
does  happiness  feature  in  the  medical  education  literature  on  physician  wellbeing  at 
work?’ and ‘How is happiness conceptualized outside medicine?’

Methods: Following current methodological standards for critical narrative review as well 
as the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles, we conducted a structured 
search in health research, humanities and social sciences, a grey literature search, and 
consultation with experts. After screening and selection, content analysis was performed. 

Results:  Of  401  identified  records,  23  were  included.  Concepts  of  happiness  from  the 
fields of psychology (flow, synthetic happiness, mindfulness, flourishing), organizational 
behaviour  (job  satisfaction,  happy-productive  worker  thesis,  engagement),  economics 
(happiness industry, status treadmill), and sociology (contentment, tyranny of positivity, 
coercive happiness) were identified. The medical education records exclusively drew on 
psychological concepts of happiness. 

Discussion  and  Conclusion:  This  critical  narrative  review  introduces  a  variety  of 
conceptualizations  of  happiness  from  diverse  disciplinary  origins.  Only  four  medical 
education papers were identified, all drawing from positive psychology which orients us 
to treat happiness as individual, objective, and necessarily good. This may constrain both 
our  understanding  of  the  problem  of  physician  wellbeing  and  our  imagined  solutions. 
Organizational, economical and sociological conceptualizations of happiness can usefully 
expand the conversation about physician wellbeing at work.

INTRODUCTION

For more than 30 years, we have been discussing the issue 
of  physician  wellbeing  at  work.  Scholarship  on  physician 
wellbeing and related concepts such as life satisfaction and 
wellness has: analysed contributors and impacts of burnout 
[1–3],  identified  health  problems  among  physicians  and 
potential  solutions  [1,  4,  5],  explored  wellness  and  the 
pursuit of balance [6–8], and implemented interventions to 
improve resilience among physicians [9–12]. This scholarship 
has informed a movement to improve wellbeing in medical 
education and medicine [13, 14]. Main dimensions of this 
movement  are:  changing  of  organizational  strategies 
[1,  12],  promoting  the  wellbeing  of  physicians  in  training 
through  faculty  development  [13,  15]  and  systematic 
strengthening of individual factors [1, 12, 15]. 

Despite  this  wealth  of  scholarship  and  improvement 
initiatives,  the  problem  of  physician  wellbeing  seems  to 
have  improved  very  little  [15].  Data  from  the  Association 
of  American  Medical  Colleges  Graduation  Questionnaire 
and  Year  2  Questionnaire  from  2016  to  2019  show  no 
sign  of  improvements  among  medical  students  despite 
targeted  efforts  [16,  17].  The  Accreditation  Council  for 
Graduate  Medical  Education  also  surveys  residents  and 
faculty annually, but changes to wellbeing in recent years 
are challenging to analyze due to a change in the structure 
of the questionnaire and the onset of the pandemic. What 
is  clear  is  that  mental  illness  and  suicide  among  doctors 
has  increased  [18],  supported  by  data  highlighting  high 
rates  of  mental  health  symptoms  among  physicians 
[19].  Furthermore,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  appears  to 
have  worsened  the  situation.  Its  potential  impact  on  the 
mental wellbeing of health workers has been studied [20], 
with  consistent  reports  of  stress,  anxiety  and  depressive 
symptoms  among  healthcare  professionals  [21].  Thus, 
the  question  of  why  physician  wellbeing  efforts  are 
unsuccessful is particularly pressing. 

One  reason  might  be  conceptual.  Amid  the  suite  of 
concepts  around  which  physician  wellbeing  work  has 
formed, the notion of ‘happiness’ does not strongly feature. 
Happiness is a richly theorized construct in other domains. 
It is used for a number of different constructs [22, 23], and 
a distinction between affective wellbeing and eudaimonia 
or  eudaimonic  wellbeing  (meaning  and  purpose  of  life) 
has  been  recognised  since  antiquity  [22].  While  the  two 
conditions,  wellbeing  and  happiness,  are  related  (or  even 
perhaps conflated) in the literature, their relationship is not 
clear. This review arises from our assumption that the term 
‘happiness’  may  carry  additional,  distinctive  meanings 
that  could  influence  the  conversation  about  physician 
wellbeing  in  medical  education.  Other  scholars  have  had 
similar  ideas:  e.g.,  Alan  Peterkin  has  noted  that  ‘pleasure 

209

and  happiness  are  neglected  in  our  training  and  in  our 
work’  [24].  Thus,  we  conducted  a  critical  narrative  review 
guided  by  two  questions:  ‘How  does  happiness  feature  in 
the  medical  education  literature  on  physician  wellbeing?’ 
and  ‘How  is  happiness  conceptualized  outside  medicine?’ 
We aim to describe whether and how happiness features 
in  medical  education,  how  the  construct  of  happiness  is 
understood  in  other  select  domains,  and  how  we  might 
adopt  understandings  from  other  domains  to  enrich  the 
scholarship of physician wellbeing at work going forward.

METHODS

This  critical  narrative  review  followed  the  Scale  for  the 
Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) procedure 
[25]  and  was  also  informed  by  Kahlke’s  work  [26].  Our 
goal has been to explore a wide-ranging literature and to 
be  deliberately  selective  in  highlighting  works  that  allow 
us  to  achieve  the  key  contribution  of  a  narrative  review: 
deepened  understanding  that  advances  the  scholarly 
conversation [27]. 

‘Happiness’ 

Our  review  began  with  the  question 

‘How  does 
happiness  feature  in  the  medical  education  literature 
on  physician  wellbeing?’ 
is  a  broad  and 
multifaceted  concept,  one  which  a  single  review  would 
struggle to comprehensively capture; given our interest in 
physician happiness at work, we used the term “workplace 
happiness” to focus our inquiry. We conducted a structured 
literature  search  in  the  medical  literature  for  ‘workplace 
happiness  AND  physicians’  in  the  databases  PubMed, 
CINHAL  and  PsycINFO  with  librarian  assistance.  In  the 
screening process, we excluded records that contained the 
term ‘happiness’ (or derivatives such as ‘happy’) in passing, 
without  definition  or  conceptualization.  For  example,  one 
article  mentioned  that  52%  of  pathologists  are  ‘happy’ 
with  their  job  but  did  not  describe  how  happiness  was 
understood [28].

Having identified the records in medical education, our 
next step was a humanities and social sciences literature 
search  to  address  the  second  question,  ‘How  is  the  term 
happiness  used  outside  medicine?’  We  searched  using 
purposeful  combinations  of  ‘workplace  happiness’  and 
‘happiness’  in  Web  of  Science,  Embase  and  Scopus. 
Searches  in  the  grey  literature  covered  a  broad  spectrum 
from Google Scholar to TED Talks. Discussion with experts 
from  psychology,  sociology,  philosophy,  women  studies 
and medical education helped us identify relevant sources. 
We did not use synonyms for happiness in our search, as our 
intent  was  not  a  full  exploration  of  the  conceptualization 
of  happiness  but  rather  an  understanding  of  how  these 
disciplines use the term happiness.

Schwitz et al. Perspectives on Medical Education DOI: 10.5334/pme.856The authors judged the sufficiency of our database on 
two levels. First, we sought to represent a range of disciplines 
in  which  happiness  is  theorized.  Because  our  structured 
search  returned  sources  from  sociology,  psychology, 
economics  and  organizational  behaviour,  these  became 
the  focus  of  our  results.  Critical  narrative  review  involves 
compiling  a  selective  rather  than  comprehensive  set  of 
records;  we  judged  this  range  of  disciplines  sufficient  to 
provide useful insights on which to base future research. The 
second point of sufficiency relates to how many and which 
records from each discipline are necessary to represent key 
notions around happiness. Rather than setting a threshold 
for  a  specific  number  of  records,  the  authors  instead 
considered  whether  the  records  offered  a  sufficiently 
robust description of the concept. As we analysed selected 
records, we judged them sufficient once we could explain 
the  concept  and  recognize  redundancies  in  additional 
records.  Where  we  could  not  make  this  judgment,  we 
sought  additional  records.  Overall,  we  justified  the  choice 
of  literature  based  on  its  ability  to  support  a  description 
of  different  conceptualizations  of  happiness  that  could 
advance  our  thinking  on  the  topic  in  medical  education. 
This  process  is  the  essence  of  rigour  in  critical  narrative 
reviews [26].

Screening and selection were shaped by the orientations 
of our research team members. Our group includes a senior 
medical education researcher with disciplinary roots in the 
humanities, an early career medical education researcher 
with  roots  in  public  health  and  health  promotion,  and 
a  cardiology  educator  completing  a  masters  in  medical 
education.  We  brought  to  the  review  different  degrees 
of  familiarity  and  comfort  with  the  disciplines  we  were 
searching:  for  instance,  we  were  all  familiar  with  medical 
education  scholarship,  but  two  of  us  were  also  familiar 

210

with  scholarship  and  vocabulary  from  social  sciences, 
psychology  and  organizational  behaviour,  while  none 
of  us  were  familiar  with  economics  scholarship.  This 
invariably  influenced  our  insights  and  enthusiasms  for 
particular  concepts  retrieved  in  our  search,  but  together 
we  endeavoured  to  address  all  retrieved  records  with  the 
same attention and support each other to interpret those 
we were less familiar with.

After  screening  and  selection  of  records  for  both  the 
focused medical education search and the broader, multi-
discipline search, content analysis was done to enhance the 
trustworthiness of the study. Content analysis offered a way 
to arrange the data systematically into distinct categories, 
including definitions and conceptualizations of happiness, 
disciplinary  origin  of  ideas,  connections  and  similarities, 
and differences or tensions. Concept mapping enabled us 
to visualize the relationships among these categories, and 
informed our interpretation of these relationships.

RESULTS

Our  searches  retrieved  401  records.  After  abstract  and 
title  screening,  28  were  selected  for  full-text  review,  of 
which  13  were  included.  An  additional  10  were  included 
from  hand-searching  and  grey  literature  for  a  total  of 
23.  Our  focused  medical  education  search  yielded  4 
records.  Our  second,  broader  search  yielded  records  from 
psychology (8), organizational behavior (6), economics (2) 
and  sociology  (3).  While  such  disciplinary  categories  are 
necessarily  simplifications,  we  use  them  in  the  following 
sections  as  organizing  structures  to  highlight  disciplinary 
patterns 
in  how  the  records  characterize  happiness 
(Figure  1:  Disciplinary  patterns  in  the  characterization  of

records showed that this scholarship exclusively employed 
psychological  concepts,  we  have  included  these  records 
(which address our first research question) in that section. 
Because  of  the  small  number  of  medical  education 
records, the bulk of our results address our second research 
question. Terminologies vary and are used interchangeably 
in  this  literature  (Cromby  cited  in  Frawley)  [29];  however, 
for  consistency  we  deliberately  use  the  term  ‘happiness’ 
except when quoting from a record that uses another term.

HAPPINESS AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPT
Psychological  concepts  of  happiness  have  in  common  a 
predominantly  individual  approach.  In  this  section,  we 
highlight four psychological concepts that have particular 
relevance  in  the  context  of  physician  wellbeing  at  work, 
including those that have already been taken up in medical 
education.

The first concept is flow theory [30], which states that 
you need a flow feeling – a state of ideal balance between 
challenges  and  abilities—to  be  happy.  Flow  is  a  state  of 
being  focused;  having  a  sense  of  ecstasy,  inner  clarity 
and  serenity;  knowing  that  an  activity  is  doable;  feeling 
timelessness  and  intrinsic  motivation  [31].  Flow  tends  to 
occur at work more than in leisure time [32]: e.g., a musician 
could  reach  a  flow  state  during  a  concert.  The  concept 
of  flow  has  its  origin  in  positive  psychology.  The  initial 
study  about  flow  theory  by  psychologist  Csíkszentmihályi 
included surgeons, and the concept of flow has been taken 
up in medical education in a paper about enhancing career 
enjoyment,  performance  and  workplace  happiness  [33, 
34]. This work supported flow through training in individual 
interventions such as coaching, psychological skills training, 
mental skills training or stress management training [33]. 
While  supporting  flow  in  health  care  is  recognized  to 
require supplementary system-level interventions, such as 
increasing time for patient care, minimizing administrative 
tasks, and promoting constructive learning environments, 
scholarship at the system level is less common [33, 35].

The second concept from positive psychology is synthetic 
happiness. The term was coined by Daniel Gilbert in a 2004 
TED  Talk,  although  his  subsequent  writings  do  not  use  it. 
Contrasted with ‘natural happiness’ which is what we feel 
when we get what we want, ‘synthetic happiness is what 
we make when we do not get what we want’ [36]. A term 
coined  by  Harvard  psychologist  Daniel  Gilbert,  synthetic 
happiness  acts  like  a  psychological  immune  system,  to 
‘[strike]  a  balance  that  allows  us  to  feel  good  enough  to 
cope with our situation but  bad enough  to do something 
about  it’  [36,  37].  We  convince  ourselves  that  we  have  is 
what we would have chosen anyway. For instance, clinical 
clerkship  students  acknowledge  what  they  like  or  dislike 

211

about  each  specialty  as  they  rotate  through  them,  but 
during residency their choice is already made, so they are 
likely to convince themselves that they are happy with it. 
Synthetic happiness helps us to find a way to like what we 
have. However, synthetic is not ‘false’; Gilbert argues that 
‘synthetic Happiness is as real and enduring as the natural 
happiness’  [36],  suggesting  it  could  have  implications  for 
being happy in an imperfect workplace. 

Finally,  two  related  concepts  from  positive  psychology 
occurred 
in  our  records:  flourishing  and  mindfulness 
[38,  39].  Flourishing  draws  on  the  metaphor  of  flower 
growth,  and  refers  to  a  lifestyle  determined  by  optimal 
living,  mastering  life’s  tasks,  kindness,  personal  growth, 
and  resilience.  Five  pillars  are  required:  positive  emotion, 
engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment 
[40]. These factors form the basic precondition for a life of 
profound fulfilment. Mindfulness is described as a mental 
state  achieved  by  focusing  one’s  awareness.  While  it 
shares  features  with  flourishing,  it  is  the  practice  of  non-
judgmental attention in the moment. Only one record used 
mindfulness as part of a suite of interventions to ‘increase 
happiness’4;  the  others  did  not  articulate 
increased 
happiness as an explicit goal of mindfulness.

HAPPINESS AS AN ORGANIZATIONAL CONCEPT
Organizational  approaches  to  happiness  arise  from  the 
premise  that  individuals  spend  most  of  their  adult  lives 
working.  As  such,  happiness  in  the  workplace  is  a  key 
component of overall happiness in life. In this section, we 
highlight key concepts in our records that were associated 
with  happiness  at  work, 
job  satisfaction, 
productivity, and employee engagement.
idea 
is 

literature 
A  common 
about  happiness 
‘job  satisfaction’.  Components  of 
job  satisfaction  that  contribute  to  employee  happiness 
include aspects at the transient, individual (employee) and 
organizational  or  collective  level  [41,  42].  Transient-level 
contributions to workplace happiness include momentary 
affect,  emotion  at  work  and  flow  state  [43].  Employee-
level  contributions  to  workplace  happiness  include  job 
security,  meaningful  work,  positive  relationships  with 
coworkers,  recognition,  autonomy  and  engagement  [44]. 
The  organizational  aspects  that  contribute  to  workplace 
happiness include opportunities for growth, compensation, 
job  flexibility,  a  positive  work  environment,  work-life 
balance, and organizational culture [44]. Both the employer 
(leader) and the individual (follower) play a strong role in 
shaping organizational aspects that contribute to happiness 
through constructive dissensus [45]. Constructive dissensus 
refers  to  a  mutual  understanding  between  leaders  and 
followers,  including  shared  beliefs  and  values,  leading  to 
improved  quality  of  life  at  work.  Interventions  aimed  at 

Schwitz et al. Perspectives on Medical Education DOI: 10.5334/pme.856improving  workplace  happiness  should  be  multi-faceted 
and focus both on improving individual happiness as well 
as the organizational aspects to enhance job performance 
and employee retention [45].

The happy-productive worker thesis states that all things 
being  equal,  happy  workers  perform  better  than  those 
who  are  less  happy.  This  idea  has  been  the  holy  grail  of 
management  and  organizational  psychology  research  for 
two decades. With roots in positive psychology, the happy-
productive worker thesis explicitly focuses on ‘productivity 
as a consequence of happiness at work’ [46]. Happiness in 
this thesis was operationalized by a diversity of constructs 
(affect,  wellbeing,  burnout,  life  satisfaction,  growth  and 
purpose), which may explain the inconclusive nature of the 
empirical literature, which finds that people who are happy 
in general are more productive, but people who are happy 
specifically at work are not necessarily so. 

‘Engagement’  was  a  crucial  dimension  of  measuring 
happiness  at  work  [47].  Workplace  engagement 
is 
defined  as  a  persistent  affective  state  that  includes  how 
employees express themselves physically, cognitively, and 
emotionally  at  work.  The  physical  aspect  of  engagement 
focuses on the energy expended by individuals to perform 
their job, while the cognitive aspect focuses on employees’ 
beliefs about their organization and the emotional aspect 
focuses  on  how  employees  feel  towards  the  organization 
[48].  Workplace  happiness  is  the  ‘positive  outcomes  at 
the  workplace  which  are  a  result  of  many  interlinked 
factors  ranging  from  employee-work  relation  within  the 
organization  to  the  end  results  of  efficient  production 
and  customer  satisfaction’ 
[47].  The  organizational 
behavior  literature  connects  engagement  to  productivity. 
Describing  engagement  as  having  a  positive  correlation 
with constructs like organization growth, lower operational 
costs,  lower  absenteeism,  and  decreased  intentions  to 
literature  begins  to 
turnover  [47],  the  organizational 
articulate an economics of happiness which is even more 
explicit in the economic records we analyzed. 

HAPPINESS AS AN ECONOMIC CONCEPT
Economic approaches to happiness arise from the position 
that  happy  workers  improve  the  economy.  Therefore,  the 
search for happiness has also become more and more of 
a business. In this section, we highlight the aspects related 
to the ‘happiness industry’.

Happiness  is  a  central  concept  in  economics.  Global 
institutions such as the World Bank and the World Health 
Organization embrace the relationship between subjective 
happiness and economic wellbeing [29], and, since 2012, 
the  World  Happiness  Report  has  tracked  the  happiness 
of  countries  as  a  marker  of  economic  health.  ‘Happiness 
economics’ conceives of happiness as an objective, measur-

212

able entity, something that can be ‘reduced to calculable 
units’ [29]. Happiness is calculated at individual and group 
levels, with the goal of converting happiness into familiar 
kinds  of  economic  capital  like  gross  domestic  product, 
consumer spending, and employment rates. 

With the rise of the happiness industry, the interaction 
between  happiness  and  the  markets  becomes  a  central 
concern  of  economics.  As  a  marketing  device,  happiness 
is  strategic.  Consumer  groups  must  be  poised  ‘between 
pleasure and pain’: just happy enough to sustain the idea 
that products bring happiness and just unhappy enough to 
feel the need to buy more [49]. However, economic growth 
compulsion  can  have  a  negative  impact  on  happiness, 
as  consumers  are  confronted  with  the  agony  of  choice. 
Multiple options can only contribute to happiness as long as 
the number of options is still manageable. Once a certain 
threshold is reached, additional options do not bring further 
happiness. And purchasing power is not the solution. 

Studies  of  the  relationship  between 

income  and 
happiness  suggest  that,  despite  economic  growth  and 
increased prosperity, people are not happier. At the same 
time,  however,  critical  economic  scholars  warn  against 
extrapolating  that  poorer  means  happier  (Pender  cited  in 
Frawley) [29], and raise concern that the emphasis on the 
subjective sensations of the populace can deflect attention 
from objective realities like insufficient food. Furthermore, 
the relationship between money and happiness is complex: 
the ‘status treadmill’ concept captures the notion that it is 
relative, not absolute, income that can lead to happiness, 
and we are happier when our relative income is higher than 
our peers [50]. In relation to physician happiness at work, 
these  economic  concepts  suggest  a  complex,  nonlinear 
relation between physician income and happiness.

HAPPINESS AS A SOCIAL CONCEPT
Sociological  approaches  to  happiness  arise  from  the  posi-
tion  that  the  predominantly  psychological  treatment  of 
happiness fails to attend to the affordances and impediments 
to happiness that exist at a structural level. In this section, 
we highlight two concepts – the crisis of contentment and 
happiness as coercion – that arose in our records. 

In the book, Deconstructing Happiness, McKenzie describes 
a  crisis  of  contentment.  They  distinguish  happiness,  which 
is  an  individual  characteristic,  from  contentment,  which  is 
‘a collective social project’ [51] arising from ‘committing to 
something greater than the self’ [51]. Contentment is socially 
defined  and  motivated,  standing  in  contrast  to  pleasure-
driven,  temporary  and  individual  forms  of  happiness.  With 
this  distinction,  the  author  argues  that  we  are  currently 
experiencing a ‘crisis of contentment’ (not of happiness) in 
modern society. Our lives are ‘filled with an almost unending 
range of products, services and self-help books that will lead 

Schwitz et al. Perspectives on Medical Education DOI: 10.5334/pme.856to happiness’ but ‘people do not seem to be as happy as they 
SHOULD be’ [51] because individual happiness cannot provide 
meaning  and  long-term  satisfaction  without  context.  The 
values  and  norms  of  the  social  world  provide  this  context. 
Therefore, ‘how the individual is able to positively place him-
or herself with regard to social values and norms’ [51] is the 
basis of contentment. 

The concept of a crisis of contentment moves us away 
from  concerns  about  the  individual’s  happiness  or  lack 
thereof.  Instead,  we  must  be  concerned  with  the  social, 
political and economic factors that shape the relationship 
between the individual and society [51]. In particular, we 
need to critique our expectations of happiness [29]. Some 
sociologists  have  argued  that  the  idea  of  happiness  is 
part  of  a  widespread  ‘tyranny  of  positivity’  in  modernity, 
pressuring individuals ‘to conform to culturally sanctioned 
ideals of behavior and disposition’ [51]. A growing body of 
work challenges the ‘epistemological fallacy that happiness 
‘has’ a kind of essence’ and argues instead that the concept 
of  happiness  is  a  relational  construct,  gaining  meaning 
from socio-historical context and attendant social norms’ 
[51]. Happiness, they argue, is not a neutral concept.

Happiness  as  coercion  is  an  instance  of  its  lack  of 
neutrality,  as  argued  by  critical  feminist  scholarship.  For 
instance,  Sara  Ahmed  considers  happiness  as  a  ‘world-
making device’ [52]: the world is made by prescribing what is 
appropriate ‘happiness’ based on largely unacknowledged 
social values and norms. Happiness, then, is an instrument 
for reorienting the individual toward a common good. Thus, 
as  ‘an  idea  or  aspiration  within  everyday  life’  happiness 
can  lead  to  ‘forms  of  coercion  …such  that  one  person’s 
happiness  is  …made  conditional  on  their  willingness  to 
be  made  happy  by  the  same  things  as  other  people’. 
Happiness,  therefore,  makes  demands  on  us  [50].  It 
demands  that  we  accept,  with  a  smile,  the  social  values 
that have dictated what happiness is. Using the example of 
‘happy housewife’ of the 1950s, she argues that this notion 
of  female  happiness  enforces  ‘gendered  forms  of  labour’ 
and encourages us to consider the possibility of refusing to 
be happy in the ways that society prescribes. What would 
it mean instead to ‘claim the freedom to be unhappy’ [52]? 

DISCUSSION

213

HAPPINESS IS NOT ONLY INDIVIDUAL: IT IS 
ALSO SOCIAL
The  four  medical  education  papers  we  analysed  that 
explored physician happiness at work all relied upon concepts 
of happiness based in positive psychology. And while efforts 
to  promote  physician  flow  and  mindfulness  at  work  are 
valuable, they represent a partial view of the phenomenon 
due  to  their  focus  on  the  individual.  Even  in  the  Canadian 
Medical Association Journal call to consider ‘Physician health: 
beyond wellness to happiness’, the emphasis is on personal 
attributes  such  as  stoicism  and  perfectionism.  However, 
as McKenzie argued, ‘the individual approach to happiness 
is  both  incomplete  and  inherently  flawed’  [51].  We  would 
argue that we’ll never fully understand physician happiness 
by exclusively emphasizing individual psychology. We need 
to also address the relationship between the individual and 
society by considering the concept of contentment, which 
requires  paying  attention  to  social,  political  and  economic 
factors.  As  McKenzie  has  suggested,  with  this  shift  ‘the 
goal  is  no  longer  supporting  individual  attempts  to  find 
happiness, rather [it is] experiencing the ups and downs of 
life within a meaningful social narrative’ [51]. Given this, we 
might ask, what would it mean to have ‘a meaningful social 
narrative’ for physicians to experience the ups and downs 
of their work? 

A first step might be to normalize these ups and downs 
and  openly  discuss  how  we  make  sense  of  them,  paying 
attention  to  the  social,  political  and  economic  factors 
that  shape  this  sense-making.  Economics,  for  instance, 
is part of this social narrative, but absolute income is less 
important  than  relative  income  [50].  Attention  to  such 
factors  might  helpfully  complicate  discussions  about  the 
place  of  physician  income  in  wellbeing  at  work  and  draw 
our  attention  to  questions  of  the  relative  value  of  health 
professions  and  medical  specialties  in  inter  and  intra 
professional  workplaces.  Other  social  factors  that  matter 
for  a  meaningful  social  narrative  of  the  ups  and  downs 
of  physician  work  include  ‘a  thriving  and  collaborative 
group  identity’  [49]  which  this  literature  connects  to  the 
promise  of  constructive  dissensus.  To  further  explore  this 
promise, scholarship might begin to connect the wellbeing 
conversation  to  the  conversation  about  teamwork  to 
understand  how  the  ability  to  negotiate  shared  meaning 
in moments of conflict influences physician contentment. 

This  critical  narrative  review  has  articulated  multiple 
conceptualizations  of  happiness  that  could  inform  the 
way  we  approach  physician  wellbeing  at  work  in  medical 
education. In this section, we provide three main insights 
about these conceptualizations of happiness and consider 
their implications for scholarship and improvement efforts 
related to physician wellbeing in the workplace. 

INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS IS NOT OBJECTIVE, IT 
IS SUBJECTIVE
The definition of happiness is multifaceted. Terminologies 
vary, and there remain no standardised definitions [29]. But 
what  most  terms  have  in  common  is  that  they  approach 
happiness as an objective thing – something we can ‘get’ 
more  or  less  of.  However,  our  results  suggest  agreement 

Schwitz et al. Perspectives on Medical Education DOI: 10.5334/pme.856that  happiness  is  subjective:  it  is  something  we  perceive 
and  even  something  we  manufacture  thanks  to  our 
psychological immune system. Knowing that happiness is 
subjective, unstable, situated – even synthetic – calls into 
question our insistence on measuring it. Most of the records 
about  physician  happiness  from  medical  education  were 
measurement-focused. A critical examination of both our 
insatiable appetite to measure and the individual measures 
themselves is necessary if we are to avoid oversimplifying 
the  construct  of  happiness  as  we  integrate  it  more  fully 
into  medical  education.  Notwithstanding  the  question 
of whether happiness can be measured at all, our results 
suggest that understanding happiness may have more to 
do  with  measuring  expectations  and  interpretations  than 
experiencing  happiness.  Given  this,  we  might  explore  the 
expectations and interpretations medical trainees bring to 
the profession, how they change over time, and how these 
changes influence happiness at work.

HAPPINESS IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARDLY 
GOOD; IT IS ALSO POTENTIALLY COERCIVE
Critical  sociological  approaches  to  happiness  draw  our 
attention  to  the  role  of  happiness  as  ‘a  central  pacifying 
rhetoric and important technolog[y] for the management 
of subjectivity to ensure … the perpetuation of the existing 
order  of  things’  [29].  Such  critiques  of  happiness  remind 
us  that,  amid  our  efforts  to  promote  the  happiness  of 
individual  physicians,  we  must  also  be  critically  reflexive. 
We need to ask questions such as: Who defines ‘happiness’ 
for  physicians?  What  social  norms  and  power  relations 
does  that  definition  serve?  Does  our  conceptualization  of 
physician  happiness  acknowledge  cultural  contingencies? 
We are not suggesting that we should abandon initiatives 
that  seek  to  improve  happiness;  however,  as  we  pursue 
them,  we  must  also  ask  ourselves  how  these  perpetuate 
an existing structural and political order that is ‘coercive’, 
sustaining unacknowledged power relations. To use Ahmed’s 
term,  do  we  cast  as  ‘killjoys’  [52]  physicians  who  refuse 
to perpetuate the existing order by refusing to be happy-
as-prescribed?  Do  we  support  physicians  to  be  unhappy 
in the face of tragedy, or demand that they suppress that 
emotion  and  be  happy  (or  at  least  neutral)?  Recognizing 
that  dominant  understandings  of  happiness  might 
disempower  some  physicians  based  on  culture,  gender, 
race or other minority factors, we should consider whether 
and  how  the  prevalent  conceptualization  of  happiness 
inclusion  and  decolonisation 
takes  equality,  diversity, 
(EDI-D) into account. As Slavin has recognized, ‘wellbeing 
programming  has  been  a  one-size-fits-all  approach  and 
has  not  adequately  acknowledged  and  addressed  the 
additional  threats  to  wellbeing  and  satisfaction  faced  by 
many in our community’ [15]. To advance the conversation 

214

about physician happiness at work, we need to recognize 
how  conventional  definitions  of  physician  happiness  may 
be coercive, especially for minorities and equity deserving 
groups. We should be alert to physician unhappiness as a 
symptom not a disease – and even, perhaps, as a form of 
resistance to prescribed narratives.

LIMITATIONS
A critical narrative review of happiness is, by design, selective 
and  positioned  rather  than  exhaustive  and  neutral  [53]. 
We  have  chosen  to  highlight  disciplines  and  concepts  of 
happiness  specifically  related  to  our  focus  on  physician 
happiness  in  the  workplace.  Consequently,  our  review 
examines  the  concept  of  workplace  happiness  as  one 
important  component  of  happiness  in  medical  education: 
other  aspects  of  happiness  beyond  ‘workplace  happiness’ 
are likely relevant but are not captured in this work. We have 
focused  on  a  subset  of  disciplines  (psychology,  sociology, 
economics,  organizational  behavior),  and  we  acknowledge 
that our review of concepts of happiness in each discipline is 
selective rather than comprehensive: it reflects the records 
our search returned and there may be other insights about 
happiness  in  these  disciplines  that  future  work  building 
on  our  own  could  explore.  Furthermore,  the  inclusion  of 
additional  disciplines  would  probably  enrich  and  expand 
the  conceptualizations  of  happiness  we  have  described  in 
this work. A particular gap is the lack of philosophy records 
captured  in  our  search,  which  initially  surprised  us.  After 
consulting  with  a  philosophy  scholar,  we  determined  that 
this  was  because  the  terminology  in  philosophy  differs 
significantly from our search terms. Likely other disciplines, 
such  as  religious  studies  or  history,  were  also  outside  the 
scope of our initial search due to differences in terminology 
for  the  happiness  construct.  This  is  a  challenge  for  any 
review: reviewers need to decide how far from their original 
search terms to venture and where to draw the line. For this 
first narrative review of ‘happiness’ as it relates to physician 
happiness at work, we decided to remain consistent in our 
search terms and we therefore acknowledge that our results 
cannot be comprehensive of all treatments of the concept 
in  all  published  literature.  Finally,  our  review  of  included 
disciplines was not intended to be exhaustive, but to describe 
some key conceptualizations of happiness as they relate to 
understanding  physician  happiness  at  work.  Undoubtedly 
there  is  much  more  to  be  learned  about  the  history  and 
nuances of each of these fields’ approaches to happiness. 

CONCLUSION

This  critical  narrative  review  has  revealed  that  medical 
education rarely incorporates the concept of happiness in 

Schwitz et al. Perspectives on Medical Education DOI: 10.5334/pme.856215

the workplace and, when it does, it draws exclusively from 
positive  psychology.  This  disciplinary  emphasis  orients  us 
to treat happiness as individual, objective, and necessarily 
good.  Understanding  organizational,  economic  and  social 
aspects of happiness can usefully expand the conversation 
about  physician  wellbeing  at  work  to  include  the  insights 
that  happiness  is  also  social,  subjective,  and  potentially 
coercive.  With  such  insights,  we  might  imagine  different 
solutions to the persistent problem of physician wellbeing – 
in fact, we might even redefine the problem itself.
