Abstract: A large amount of the current literature has focused on the characteristic symptoms of at-
tention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. In contrast, less attention
has been devoted to ADHD clinical subtypes in adult patients. We evaluated 164 consecutive adult
ADHD (A-ADHD) outpatients using DSM-5 criteria and many speciﬁc rating scales and question-
naires. A principal component factor analysis was performed on clinical and symptomatological
variables to describe potential clinical variants. We sought to determine different A-ADHD variants
focusing on demographic and clinical features. A four-factor solution was identiﬁed, and patients
were clustered, according to their z-score, in 4 subgroups. The ﬁrst was marked out by Emotional
Dysregulation (ED), the second by Substance Use (SU), the third by Core-ADHD Symptoms (Co-
ADHD) and the fourth by Positive Emotionality (PE). Predominantly ED patients showed worse
overall function, early treatment with antidepressants and a greater presence of borderline personality
disorder than predominantly Co-ADHD patients. Predominantly SU patients reported high rates
of bipolar disorder and severe general psychopathology. The PE factor was related to hyperthymic
temperament and hypomania and showed a higher level of functioning. Females with A-ADHD
showed a lower risk of being included in SU, and A-ADHD patients with co-occurring delayed
sleep phase had less risk of being included in the SU factor than the prevailing Co-ADHD group.
Our empirically based description of four clinical A-ADHD variants shows several aspects beyond
the deﬁnition given by the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

1. Introduction

Neurodevelopmental disorders include a broad group of disabilities involving some
forms of disruption of brain development, and group together a very heterogeneous
range of neuropsychiatric conditions where each condition may differ substantially from
the others in clinical presentation and etiology [1]. Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder and is characterized in children
and adolescents by high levels of inattentiveness, impulsivity and/or hyperactivity.

The evolutionary trajectory of the disorder into adulthood is variable, and about
half of children and young adolescents with ADHD show an attenuation of hyperactivity
when they grow up [2]. Usually, patients with adult-ADHD (A-ADHD) are predominantly
inattentive and impulsive [3].
In 15% of these cases, the full syndrome persists into
adulthood [4].

In epidemiological surveys, the prevalence of A-ADHD is estimated to be around
2.5–4% [5,6] and the hyperactive/impulsive presentation is more common in males than
in females [7]. A-ADHD patients come to clinical attention with a variety of symptoms
of internal (anxiety, depression and social withdrawal) and external (problems in the self-
control of emotions and behaviors such as deﬁant behavior, aggressiveness and disruptive
impulses) psychiatric comorbidities [8,9], which form a severe and complex clinical pic-
ture [10], making their recognition and management a complicated task [11].

In the DSM-5, ADHD is described according to a two-dimensional model comprising
inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive or combined subtypes. This model underestimates
several clinical aspects of fundamental importance to the clinical management of adults
with the disorder.

However, given the proposals made in scientiﬁc research, the current categorical
approach to nosography may be intended to be overcome by a more appropriate etiopatho-
genetic classiﬁcation system of mental diseases consistent with the existence of deﬁnite neu-
robiological processes that support a variety of psychiatric conditions that share the same
pathophysiology. These pathophysiological traits may be explained by the clinic as trans-
diagnostic psychological/psychiatric defects and vulnerabilities that play the role of “en-
dophenotypes”. In particular, The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project [12,13] de-
veloped by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has been made available
to researchers in order to seek new ways to classify mental disorders by basing them
on the transdiagnostic forms, and subconstructs that link neurobiological systems with
their subunits (genes, molecules, neurons and neural circuits), to distinct but correlated
functional and dysfunctional aspects.

Attractively, the RDoC provides a dimensional viewpoint on psychiatry, ranging
from normal to pathological, including diagnostic subthreshold psychological/psychiatric
settings, psychological/psychiatric precursors and predisposing factors. Prime patterns of
these neurobiologically based systems considered in the RDoC transdiagnostic approach
to the pathogenesis of addiction, and in mood and impulse control dysfunctions, are
reward-processing systems and inhibitory systems.

Different variants of A-ADHD have been described, with different courses [14,15].
However, the presence of emotional dysregulation appears to be a signiﬁcant compo-
nent [16–18] that leads over time to various psychiatric comorbidities such as substance
use disorders (SUD), mood disorders and personality disorders [19,20], and thus to greater
severity in overall functioning [21–23].

The term “emotional dysregulation” is used to identify a series of affective and
behavioral phenomena found in many psychiatric disorders [24]; it is often associated with
a substantial syndromic complexity not mentioned in the DSM-5 criteria. The main features
of emotional dysregulation are: irritability, with frequent short-term behavioral outbursts
(temperamental control); short and unpredictable mood swings (affective instability); and
reduced ability to manage stress with the feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions
(emotional over-reactivity) [25].

The aim of this study is to explore the presence of different clinical patterns in a popula-
tion of A-ADHD subjects so as to more accurately describe the heterogeneity of the disorder
in adulthood.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Sample

This is a multicentric, cross-sectional, observational study. The sample included
164 consecutive outpatients admitted, with the same protocol, to Psychiatric Unit 2 at

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 922

3 of 12

the University of Pisa or to the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry of the Sapienza
University in Rome. All patients were diagnosed with A-ADHD according to DSM-5
criteria. No exclusion criteria were applied, except for the patient’s age (≤18 years old).
Demographic data, psychiatric history, past psychiatric treatment, past ADHD speciﬁc
treatment and self-reported drug use were recorded at study entry. Resident and senior
psychiatrists of the ADHD research groups evaluated the recruited patients by holding
a clinical interview and speciﬁc diagnostic tests. The study was conducted between 2016
and 2019, in accordance with the WMA Declaration of Helsinki—Ethical Principles for
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. All patients enrolled in the study ﬁlled
in and signed an informed consent document. Both the consent form and the experimental
procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Pisa, in accor-
dance with internationally accepted criteria for ethical research (study ID: 14003; code:
ADHD-MOOD).

2.2. Instruments

The diagnosis of ADHD was made according to DSM-5 criteria and conﬁrmed by
using the Italian version of the semi-structured, clinician-administered Diagnostic Inter-
view for ADHD in adults (DIVA 2.0). When possible, a caregiver/family member of
the patient participated in the interview to provide retrospective and collateral infor-
mation. Each interview comprised three parts: nine criteria for attention deﬁcit, nine
criteria for hyperactivity-impulsivity and a third part evaluating the age of onset and
the level of impairment. The presence/absence of each item was investigated both in child-
hood/adolescence and adulthood. If collateral information provided by the caregiver was
not available, the diagnosis was based exclusively on the patient’s recollection.

The clinical evaluation was based on the following scales:

•

Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scales—Observer: Screening Version (CAARS-O:SV):
this is a 30-item questionnaire for the caregiver/family member. It evaluates the pres-
ence of symptoms and behaviors associated with ADHD in adults, and rates symptoms
on a Likert scale, ranging from 0 “never” to 3 “very often”. CAARS-O:SV is a tool
designed for the DSM-V criteria, although there is no updated version yet. Neverthe-
less, it is appropriate to assess the severity of A-ADHD regardless of the version of
the DSM. The Screening Version provides four subscale scores: Inattentive Symptoms,
Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptoms, Total ADHD Symptoms and ADHD Index. Higher
scores indicate clinically signiﬁcant levels of ADHD symptoms [26].

•

• Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS): this 18-question scale was used to assess
the frequency of self-reported adult ADHD symptoms derived from the DSM-IV
criteria. Answers are expressed on a Likert scale, ranging from 0 “never” to 4 “very
often”, and a higher total score indicates signiﬁcant levels of ADHD symptoms [27].
Brief Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego (brief TEMPS-
M): this is the short version of the 110-item questionnaire evaluating the self-reported
affective and anxious temperaments. The brief TEMPS-M consists of 35 items, with
a ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from 1 “not at all” to 5 “very much”. The questionnaire
assesses ﬁve types of temperament: depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable
and anxious temperaments [28].
Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11): this is a self-report questionnaire designed
to investigate the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness and is consid-
ered the gold standard measure of impulse control. The BIS-11 consists of 30 ques-
tions; answers are expressed as a range going from 1 “never/rarely” to 4 “almost
always/always”. The scale is structured following a factorial analysis covering six
ﬁrst-order (attention, cognitive instability, motor, perseverance, self-control, cogni-
tive complexity) and three second-order factors (attentional, motor, non-planning
impulsivity) [29].
Difﬁculties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS): this is a 36-item self-evaluation scale
of six subdomains of emotional regulation (awareness, clarity, goals, impulse, non-

acceptance, strategies). Answers range from 1 “almost never” to 5 “almost always”,
and higher total DERS scores reﬂect greater difﬁculties in regulating emotions [30].
Reactivity, Intensity, Polarity and Stability questionnaire (RIPoSt-40): this scale was
used to quantify emotional dysregulation in its different facets. It consists of 40 self-
administered questions with answers given on a Likert scale going from 1 “never” to
6 “always”. Results can be divided into four subscales: affective instability, positive
emotionality, negative emotionality and emotional impulsivity. A second-order scale
can be identiﬁed as follows: negative emotion dysregulation, comprising affective
instability, negative emotionality and emotional impulsivity [31].

• Hypomania Check List-32 (HCL-32): used to evaluate lifetime hypomanic symp-
toms, it consists of 32 questions with yes/no answers and has a two-factor structure
(active/elated hypomania and risk-taking/irritable hypomania) [32].
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS): 18-item tool commonly used by clinicians to
assess current psychopathology and symptom severity [33].

•

• WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0): a 36-item questionnaire used
to explore self-reported functioning and disability in six major life domains: cognition,
mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, participation. Answers are given on
a Likert scale ranging from 1 “no difﬁculty” to 5 “extremely difﬁcult/cannot do” [34].

2.3. Data Analysis

Self-reported substance use was expressed by a four-level scale with increasing time
of use: 0 = “never used” for non-SUD patients, 1 = “abstinent for more than one year”,
implying use only in the past, 2 = “abstinent for less than one year” as recent use and 3 =
“used for more than one year” as chronic use. We considered alcohol, THC and cocaine.

A principal component factor analysis was performed on clinical and symptomatologi-
cal variables in order to reduce the heterogeneity among our A-ADHD patients. The factors
which allowed the best possible reconstruction of the data were extracted by means of prin-
cipal component analysis (PCA); we selected factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1. We
then rotated our factor matrix according to Varimax with Kaiser normalization in order to
achieve a simple structure and interpret the factor loadings. The loadings with a magnitude
greater than the conventional cut-off of 0.40 were selected and used to describe the factors.
In order to make factor scores comparable, they were standardized by converting them
into z scores. All the subjects were then assigned to one of the different subtypes based on
the highest z-scores obtained for each factor (predominant factor). This procedure gave us
the opportunity to classify patients on the basis of the highest-ranking symptomatological
cluster.

We also explored differences between the four different A-ADHD subtypes regarding
demographic data, past psychiatric treatment and psychiatric comorbidities. For continu-
ous variables, we used the Kruskal–Wallis test; for categorical variables, we used Pearson’s
Chi-squared test with post hoc Bonferroni corrections.

Third, we performed a backward multinomial logistic regression to test clinical and

demographic variables as possible predictive values of A-ADHD subtypes.

We used the statistical routines of IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 25.0

(Cupertino, CA, USA).

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the Sample

In our sample of 164 patients with a diagnosis of A-ADHD, 112 (68.3%) were males
and 52 (31.7%) females. The mean age was 28.3 (sd = 10.7) years, mean body mass index
was 24.3 (sd = 5.1). Of these 164 subjects, 42 (25.6%) were unemployed, and 122 (74.4%)
were employed; the mean number of years of schooling was 13.40 (sd = 3.18). Regarding
marital status, most of the subjects (140, 83.4%) were single, while 24 (16.6%) were married.
A total of 85 (51.8%) subjects had received previous psychiatric drug treatment and more
precisely, 53 (32.3%) with antidepressants, 37 (22.6%) with antipsychotics. Only 45 (27.4%)

had been diagnosed which allowed them to receive speciﬁc treatments (methylphenidate
or atomoxetine) for ADHD in childhood or adolescence.

Regarding psychiatric comorbidities, 134 (81.7%) of our patients had at least one
comorbid psychiatric disorder: 66 (40.2%) had anxiety disorders, 66 (40.2%) had bipolar
disorder, 7 (4.3%) had major depressive disorder, 72 (43.9%) had borderline personality
disorder, 10 (6.1%) had obsessive compulsive disorder, 28 (17.1%) had speciﬁc learning
disabilities, 13 (7.9%) had tic disorders, 8 (4.9%) had an intellectual disability, 13 (7.9%) had
autism spectrum disorder, 19 (11.6%) had feeding and eating disorders and 60 (36.3%) had
delayed sleep phase disorder.

3.2. Factor Analysis

Factor analysis, which is reported in Table 1, revealed a four-factor solution. Factor 1,
Emotional Dysregulation (ED), included DERS-TOT score and RIPOST-ED score, which are
the two rating scales for emotional dysregulation. TEMP-depressive, TEMP-cyclothymic
and TEMP-anxious also loaded with factor 1, and they can be interpreted as indirect temper-
amental measures of emotional dysregulation. Lastly, the BARRAT-TOT score, ASRS-TOT
score and WHODAS-TOT score measured impulsivity, self-reported ADHD symptoms
and impairment in global functioning. Factor 2, Substance Use (SU), included the life-
time use of all substances (Alcohol, Cannabis, Cocaine-lifetime) and BPRS-TOT, which
indicates a severe degree of general psychopathology. Factor 3, Core-ADHD Symptoms
(Co-ADHD), included the three subscales of CAARS (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive
and the ADHD index). Factor 4, Positive Emotionality (PE), included TEMP-hyperthymic,
RIPOST-positive emotionality and HSRS-Tot mean scores, all measures that give a direct or
indirect assessment of positive emotionality. ED was the predominant factor in 45 patients,
SU in 43, CO-ADHD in 37 and PE in 39.

3.3. Comparison of Demographic and Clinical Features Among Different Clinical Subtypes

The comparisons of demographic and clinical variables among the, predominantly,
Emotional Dysregulation, Substance Use, Core-ADHD Symptoms and Positive Emotion-
ality groups of patients are reported in Table 2. The four groups show similar results
regarding age, body mass index, years of schooling, gender and marital status. A statisti-
cally signiﬁcant difference was found in the employment rate, with more employed subjects
in the PE-predominant group compared with the SU-predominant group of patients. Re-
garding past pharmacological psychiatric treatment, past antidepressant treatment was
more strongly represented in the ED-predominant group compared with PE-predominant
patients. The four groups did not show statistically signiﬁcant differences for psychiatric
comorbidity except with bipolar disorder, which was more strongly represented in SU-
predominant patients than in CO-ADHD ones, and with borderline personality disorder,
which proved to be more common in the ED-predominant group than in the CO-ADHD-
predominant group (chi = 12.306, p = 0.006).

A positive association was found for the ED-predominant group with borderline
personality disorder. The SU-predominant group was positively associated with bipolar
disorder and negatively with female gender, professionally employed and delayed sleep
phase disorder. Lastly, the PE-predominant group was negatively associated with delayed
sleep phase disorder.

4. Discussion

The demographic and clinical characteristics of our patients were consistent with those
reported in other A-ADHD samples [35,36]. The main result of our study is the identiﬁca-
tion through factorial analysis of four clinical variants of A-ADHD, mainly distinguished
by ED, SU, CAS and PE.

In a recent report, the DSM-5 distinction between predominantly inattentive, hyper-
active/impulsive and combined subtypes [37] has been criticized, and two main clinical
presentations have been proposed for A-ADHD: inattentive and emotionally dysregu-
lated [38,39].

The importance of emotional dysregulation in the psychopathology of neurodevel-
opmental disorders has been conﬁrmed by many empirical observations [17,40]. Most
of the recent research has, however, been focused on the evaluation of the relationships
between emotional dysregulation and DSM-5 core-ADHD features [39]. The traditional
view does not consider other clinical implications that have been noted elsewhere [1].

Emotional dysregulation is characterized [41] by rapid mood swings, impulsive emo-
tionality with related uncontrolled and maladaptive behavior and marked difﬁculties
in regulating negative emotionality. The conceptualization of this emotional instability
as a neurodevelopmental syndrome in itself postulates that it may represent a common
neurophysiological substrate for several conditions described from different perspectives
as neurodevelopmental, mood and personality disorders [42–45].

In our ﬁrst factor, the severity of emotional dysregulation (measured by DERS-TOT
and RIPOST-ED) and the associated affective temperaments (TEMP-depressive and TEMP-
cyclothymic) are grouped together, so suggesting relative independence of the DSM-5
core-ADHD features. This result is consistent with other reports [39]. A signiﬁcant level
of impairment in overall functioning, as registered by WHODAS-TOT, is associated with
the severity of emotional dysregulation. Many studies describe how co-occurring severe
emotional dysregulation in neurodevelopmental disorders markedly worsens the basic
functioning of the patient [25,39,46,47].

As for positive emotionality, in our sample, due to the presence of hyperthymic
temperament, RIPOST-Positive Emotionality and HCL-32 total scores, it seems to be
relatively independent of the severity of emotional instability, supporting the possible
existence of an A-ADHD subtype with less difﬁculty in keeping emotional control [48,49]
and a relatively high level of functioning.

Consistent with the view that substance use is very common in A-ADHD patients,
we observed a high rate of SUD in our sample [50,51]. In our sample, Factors 2 and 3
identiﬁed clinical variants that are distinguished by lifetime substance use and by DSM-5
core-ADHD features as relatively independent. In other words, clinical variants for which
the highest scores in measures of speciﬁc ADHD psychopathology have been reported
are relatively independent of those with predominantly SUD features. This observation is
partly in conﬂict with the literature, which shows a positive correlation between the sever-
ity of ADHD symptoms and those of SUD [52,53]. Some recent studies have, however,
proposed that substance use is not associated with substantial changes in ADHD phe-
nomenology [54]. Other reports have shown that substance use is more frequent in ADHD
subtypes with severe emotional dysregulation and externalizing disorders, but we have
not found any correlation with these speciﬁc features [55–58]. Factor 2 also includes
the BPRS-TOT score for general psychopathology, which could indicate greater severity of
global psychopathology in A-ADHD patients with SUD. This observation is true for most
psychiatric disorders [59,60].

Comparative studies on demographic and clinical characteristics shown by the various
clinical subtypes showed that patients with stable employment are more common in the PE
than in the SU group. This observation is consistent with research showing that subjects
with positive emotionality tend to be less sensitive to negative feedback while being better
adapted socially [61]. They also avoid potentially damaging situations, such as the use of
drugs [62]. Moreover, a cognitive focus on positive emotions may favor problem solving
and decision making [63,64] and, consequently, the maintenance of a stable job.

We will now compare various previous treatments that rely on psychiatric drugs: as
expected, ED-predominant patients were more frequently treated with antidepressants
than those with predominant PE. Emotional dysregulation is, indeed, associated with
negative affect and more frequently prompts medical attention. In addition, the pro-
longed use of antidepressants may be associated with emotional instability [65,66] and
may increase the difﬁculty experienced in controlling stress and negative emotions in these
patients [67–69].

Bipolar disorder and SUD frequently coexist [70,71] and this seems true even when
bipolar disorder is associated with ADHD, as conﬁrmed by our results. Lastly, as expected,
in our sample borderline personality disorder is associated with ADHD variants, including
severe emotional dysregulation. The association between these syndromic variants involves
the reward systems that include brain structures such as the prefrontal cortex, the ventral
striatum and the anterior cingulate [72,73]. Someone might object that almost half of
the sample had borderline personality disorder, which suggests that this sample has more
than just A-ADHD, demonstrating itself as a severely emotionally dysregulated sample.
This level of A-ADHD comorbidity with BPD is extremely and unusually high, suggesting
this sample is not generalizable to a standard population of A-ADHD. Reimherr’s work
underlines this aspect: adults with ADHD may receive suboptimal interventions because
of the misconception that they reﬂect a different diagnosis, such as a personality disorder;
this potential for misdiagnosis has been identiﬁed by others [39,74].

Gender differences resulted when multinomial logistic regression was applied, with
A-ADHD females showing a lower risk of having SUD. The same ﬁnding was reported
by Sobanski et al. [75], which highlights the fact that ADHD females are more likely to
develop comorbidities with depressive episodes and eating disorders, while males are
more frequently affected by SUD.

It is known that females have greater difﬁculty in regulating negative emotions
in respect to males; this leads to a propensity towards comorbidities in the emotional
spectrum and anxiety disorders [76–78], while men usually have greater impulsiveness,
which leads more easily to addiction [79,80]. Delayed circadian rhythm disorder was
a risk factor for inclusion in the CAS group, suggesting a strong relationship between
circadian rhythm disturbances and neurodevelopmental disorders [81–83]. It is known that

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 922

9 of 12

delayed circadian rhythm and ADHD have a common genetic basis and possible shared
pathophysiology [84].

Limitations: In our sample, there was an imbalance between males and females,
which may skew the generalization of our results. Additionally, the sample was relatively
uneducated, lacking college graduates and also lacked marital statuses other than single,
which is not generalizable to most of the adult population. However, our sample gives
a good description of individuals with A-ADHD who come for a consultation at a level
II psychiatric clinic. As an additional issue, most of our A-ADHD subjects had never
been diagnosed with the disorder, they had never been medicated or were aware of
their symptoms. Thus, they may not have had the awareness to report accurately on their
ADHD symptoms. However, this fact often happens in real life; narrative inconsistency and
alexithymia are typical of patients with A-ADHD. Thus, the clinical variants highlighted
by us are not negatively affected by that. At the most, this fact accounts for the diagnostic
difﬁculties encountered by psychiatrists.

5. Conclusions

In this study, we have described four clinical variants of A-ADHD, distinguished as ED,
SU, CAS and PE. Predominantly ED patients showed worse overall functioning, frequent
early treatment with antidepressants and common association with borderline personality
disorder. A-ADHD patients with predominant SU were frequently males with comorbid
bipolar disorder who showed severe general psychopathology. The predominantly CAS
variant showed co-occurring delayed sleep phase, and the PE variant was distinguished by
hyperthymic temperament and hypomania, with a relatively high level of functioning.

Our empirically based description of four clinical variants of A-ADHD shows several
aspects that elaborate on details of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. This clinical perspective
may have pertinent implications for patient identiﬁcation and management in various
psychiatric settings.
