With Persistent Stuttering: Current
Status and Essential Research

Purpose: The purpose of this review article is to provide
an overview of the current evidence base for the behavioral
management of stuttering and associated social anxiety.
Method: We overview recent research about stuttering
and social anxiety in the context of contemporary cognitive
models of social anxiety disorder. That emerging evidence
for self-focused attention and safety behavior use with those
who stutter is considered in relation to current treatment
approaches for stuttering: speech restructuring and social
anxiety management.
Results: The emerging information about social anxiety
and stuttering suggests a conflict between the two clinical
approaches. For those clients who wish to control their
stuttering and where speech restructuring is deemed the

most suitable approach, it is possible that speech
restructuring may (a) induce or increase self-focused
attention, (b) promote the use of safety behaviors, and
(c) become a safety behavior itself. This conflict needs
to be explored further within clinical and research
contexts.
Conclusions: The issues raised in this review article
are complex. It appears that evidence-based speech
treatment procedures are in conflict with current best-
practice treatment procedures that deal with social
anxiety. In this review article, we propose directions
for future research to inform the development of improved
treatments for those who stutter and recommendations
for interim clinical management of stuttering.

S tuttering, being a disorder of speech production, can

have a profound effect on a person’s ability to com-
municate. For many who stutter, verbal output and
language complexity are restricted. For instance, anticipa-
tion and fear of stuttering can prompt those affected to
avoid using particular words and the intricacies of language
associated with engagement (Lee et al., 2015; Spencer
et al., 2005, 2009). Overall, quality of life can be impacted
by stuttering (Craig, 2010; Craig et al., 2009; Cummins,
2010; Koedoot et al., 2011; Yaruss, 2010). For many, edu-
cational and occupational potential is restricted (Gerlach
et al., 2018; McAllister et al., 2012; O’Brian et al., 2011).
Many people who stutter will also experience various men-
tal health conditions (Craig et al., 2015; Derogatis, 1994;
Iverach, Jones, et al., 2009a, 2009b; Iverach et al., 2010;

which social anxiety disorder is the most prevalent (Blumgart
et al., 2010; Iverach, O’Brian, et al., 2009).

Treatment for persistent stuttering typically involves
teaching a client to change the way they talk so that they
can communicate with greater ease, dealing with the psy-
chological effects of the disorder or a combination of both.
Charles Van Riper was one of the pioneers for stuttering
treatment and described procedures that targeted both issues
—fluency and anxiety (Van Riper, 1973).

To date, for those clients seeking help to minimize
stuttering, the treatment approach with the strongest evi-
dence base is speech restructuring (Onslow & Menzies, 2010).
Speech restructuring involves teaching a novel speech
technique to control stuttering during everyday speech. The
resulting speech is intended to sound as natural as possi-
ble and acceptable enough for the speaker to use when
needed.

Subsequent to early documented treatment proce-

dures that aimed to target speech and anxiety (Van Riper,
1973), cognitive models of social anxiety disorder have in-
formed the development of current gold standard evidence-
based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) procedures for
social anxiety. CBT involves identifying and challenging
unhelpful cognitions and behaviors and replacing these with

coping strategies (Clark, 2001; Clark et al., 2003; Clark &
Wells, 1995).

The thesis of this review article is that the emerging

information about social anxiety and stuttering suggests
a potential conflict between the two clinical approaches.
Speech restructuring procedures for the control of stutter-
ing appear to be in conflict with psychological treatment
approaches for anxiety associated with stuttering. For in-
stance, some speech treatment procedures may induce or
maintain anxiety for some people who stutter who are prone
to experience anxiety. Accordingly, we provide an overview
of the current evidence-based speech and anxiety treatments
for persistent stuttering as well as current research about
stuttering and anxiety that signals a potential conflict be-
tween the two clinical approaches. We draw attention to
essential research that is needed to allow the field to de-
velop an optimal understanding about the nature of stut-
tering and to provide treatment for it. Finally, we
propose interim clinical applications for the management
of stuttering and anxiety.

Treatment for Persistent Stuttering

Treatment for persistent stuttering has a long history.

Several prominent researchers and clinicians in the field
foreshadowed current evidence-based procedures. One such
pioneer in the field was Van Riper (1973), who described a
treatment based on learning theory, psychotherapy, and stut-
tering modification procedures that involved dealing with
fears and avoidance, in addition to modifying stuttering
behaviors. However, there is limited clinical trial evidence
available for those early treatment procedures (Blomgren
et al., 2005; Georgieva, 2014). Therefore, it is not possible
to evaluate the efficacy of those studies according to over-
all standards for clinical trials (World Health Organization,
2018) or according to generally accepted standards for tri-
als of stuttering treatment (Onslow et al., 2008). Another
treatment program for persistent stuttering that incorpo-
rates procedures to target speech behaviors and anxiety is
the Comprehensive Stuttering Program (Boberg & Kully,
1994; Langevin & Boberg, 1993; Langevin et al., 2006).
However, rather than employing stuttering modification
procedures, the Comprehensive Stuttering Program uses
speech restructuring procedures alongside components to
manage anxiety.

The current empirical evidence for treating the speech
motor component of stuttering is heavily weighted to speech
restructuring. This treatment approach has many variants,
described by terms including fluency shaping, prolonged
speech, and smooth speech. Speech restructuring has a long
history, dating back centuries (Packman et al., 2000). Its
first formal description in modern clinical terms seems to
have occurred during the 18th century (Bormann, 1969).
From the 1960s, the discovery of the effects of delayed
auditory feedback led to the development and clinical trials
of modern variants of this technique (R. J. Ingham, 1984).
At the end of the 1970s, a meta-analysis established the
merits of this technique over other approaches (Andrews

et al., 1980). Decades later, the situation has not changed.
It appears that speech restructuring produces changes to
the acoustic features of speech, which override the unstable
speech motor system of those who stutter, thereby enabling
fluent speech (Mallard & Westbrook, 1985; Onslow et al.,
1994; Packman et al., 2007; Robb et al., 1985; Shenker &
Finn, 1985). Many clinical trials of speech restructuring
procedures have been reported during past decades, and
preliminary trials have been reported for Internet-based
speech restructuring treatments that do not require a clini-
cian (for an overview, see Onslow, 2020).

While capable of controlling stuttering in the short
term, many who have received speech restructuring treat-
ment do not maintain treatment benefits in the long term
(Andrews & Craig, 1988; Block et al., 2006; Craig, 1998;
Craig & Calver, 1991; Craig & Hancock, 1995; Martin,
1981). Relapse rates range from 20% to 70% (Boberg &
Kully, 1994; Craig & Hancock, 1995; Martin, 1981). Several
variables have been associated with relapse: pretreatment
stuttering severity (Andrews & Craig, 1988; Block et al.,
2006; Craig, 1998; Huinck et al., 2006), locus of control
(Bloodstein & Bernstein Ratner, 2008; Craig & Andrews,
1985), and attitude to communication (Guitar, 1976; Guitar
& Bass, 1978). These reports highlight the so-called “re-
volving door” effect, where clients will re-present to speech
clinics several times during their lives.

Although many researchers have attempted to estab-
lish predictors for the high rates of relapse following speech
restructuring treatment, the most compelling evidence that
has emerged is the presence of anxiety-related disorders
(Craig & Hancock, 1995; Iverach, Jones, et al., 2009a).
Subsequent to indications implicating self-reported relapse
with anxiety, Craig and Hancock (1995) and Iverach, Jones,
et al. (2009a) provided further evidence in support of this
finding. In the Iverach, Jones, et al. (2009a) report, 64 adults
received speech restructuring treatment. Up to two thirds
of the participants were diagnosed with one or more men-
tal health disorders, the majority being anxiety disorders.
The critical finding of this study was that the presence
of any mental health condition was associated with an
increase in stuttering severity and avoidance of speaking
situations 6 months posttreatment. This finding occurred
in the absence of any differences in stuttering severity
between those with and those without mental health disor-
ders prior to treatment. This was the first empirical study
to connect having a mental health disorder with long-term
treatment outcomes.

Stuttering and Social Anxiety Disorder

More recent research indicates that adults who stut-

ter are at high risk of developing social anxiety disorder.
Up to 60% of those who seek treatment for stuttering war-
rant a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (Blumgart et al.,
2010; Iverach, O’Brian, et al., 2009; Menzies et al., 2008;
Stein et al., 1996). Iverach, O’Brian, et al. (2009) found that
a large cohort of adults seeking treatment for stuttering had
16- to 34-fold increased odds of developing a diagnosis of

60 Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (cid:129) Vol. 64 (cid:129) 59–74 (cid:129) January 2021

social anxiety disorder compared with community controls.
Blumgart et al. (2010) reported that up to 46% of a com-
bined sample of community and treatment-seeking partici-
pants who stuttered warranted a diagnosis of the condition.
Moreover, using diagnostic interviews, up to 44% of adults
seeking treatment for stuttering (Stein et al., 1996) and
60% of participants taking part in a clinical trial of CBT
for stuttering (Menzies et al., 2008) met the criteria for a
social anxiety disorder diagnosis. These high rates of social
anxiety disorder are not constrained to adults who stutter.
A report by Iverach, Jones, et al. (2016) found that 24%
of children aged 7–12 years had the disorder. This high
prevalence of social anxiety disorder is understandable,
given that stuttering interferes significantly with verbal
communication.

Social Anxiety Disorder

Social anxiety disorder is a common but serious psy-
chological condition characterized by an extreme and debili-
tating fear of negative evaluation from others during feared
social situations (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Those with the disorder fear being humiliated in front of
others, leading to an overestimated fear of negative conse-
quences (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The de-
bilitating nature of the condition can impact significantly
on daily functioning and subsequent quality of life (Sareen
et al., 2006; Schneier et al., 1994; Slade et al., 2009; Stein
& Kean, 2000; Stein et al., 2005). Social anxiety disorder
can affect the capacity to develop and sustain relationships
and fulfill educational and occupational potential. Further-
more, it is associated with a number of comorbid condi-
tions, including depression and substance abuse (Kessler,
2003; Lampe et al., 2003; Marks, 1969; Turner et al., 1986;
Wittchen et al., 1999). Social anxiety disorder can be a
chronic condition (Liebowitz et al., 1985; Turner et al., 1986;
Wittchen et al., 1999), with lifetime prevalence estimates
ranging from 5% to 13% (Grant et al., 2005; Kessler et al.,
2005; Kirmizioglu et al., 2009; Ruscio et al., 2008; Stein &
Kean, 2000).

Treatment for Social Anxiety Associated
With Stuttering

CBT is the most empirically evaluated and effica-
cious treatment approach for anxiety disorders, including
social anxiety disorder (Clark et al., 2003; Mattick et al.,
1989; Tolin, 2010; for reviews, see Acarturk et al., 2009;
Rodebaugh, Holaway, & Heimberg, 2004). CBT involves
identifying and challenging negative and unhelpful thoughts
and beliefs. Procedures then target those thoughts through
psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, exposure therapy,
and behavioral experiments.

Based on gold standard CBT procedures, a program
has been developed specifically to deal with social anxiety
experienced by adults who stutter (Menzies et al., 2008).
This treatment targets specific negative thoughts and con-
cerns associated with stuttering (St Clare et al., 2009) and

is based on contemporary theories of social anxiety disor-
der (Clark & Wells, 1995). The procedures in this CBT pro-
gram are broadly consistent with procedures developed by
Van Riper (1973). Several studies have evaluated the merits
of using the Menzies et al. (2008) CBT program with adults
who stutter. In a randomized controlled trial, Menzies
et al. (2008) administered CBT before speech treatment to
determine whether it had any effect on stuttering severity.
The participants who received CBT before speech treat-
ment showed improved scores for Global Assessment of
Functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) im-
mediately posttreatment, and the trend for improvement
continued at 12 months posttreatment. In addition, the
CBT program was associated with significantly less avoid-
ance of speaking situations than for the control group,
and this trend was retained at 12 months posttreatment.
For those participants who received CBT before speech treat-
ment, the CBT did not appear to affect speech outcomes
for percent syllables stuttered, as measured by blinded
observers. However, as would be expected, both groups
demonstrated lower scores for percent syllables stuttered
following speech treatment.

An Internet version of the treatment—iGlebe—has

been developed. Several reports have provided evidence for
its capacity to eliminate social anxiety disorder diagnoses
for adults who stutter (Helgadóttir et al., 2009, 2014a)
and to improve responses on measures that assess unhelp-
ful thoughts, avoidance behaviors, fear of negative eval-
uation, depression, anxiety, stress, and overall quality of
life (Menzies et al., 2016; Menzies, O’Brian, et al., 2019;
Menzies, Packman, et al., 2019). There is also emerging
evidence that the iGlebe program is associated with im-
proved self-reported stuttering severity (Menzies, O’Brian,
et al., 2019; Menzies, Packman, et al., 2019).

iBroadway, a modified version of the iGlebe treatment

program for adolescents, has also provided encouraging
results (Gunn et al., 2019). This report associated the
iBroadway program with reduced mental health diagnoses,
including social anxiety disorder, and improvement on
scores of psychological measures of anxiety, for adolescents
who stutter.

Cognitive Models of Social Anxiety Disorder

Two decades after Van Riper (1973) detailed his treat-
ment procedures, cognitive models of social anxiety disorder
were developed in an attempt to explain how anxiety is
maintained with the condition (Clark & Wells, 1995; Hirsch
& Clark, 2004; Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). These models
are driven by the need to explain why those with social
anxiety disorder fail to unlearn fear, regardless of the
many social encounters that do not result in negative
consequences. One such prominent model (Clark & Wells,
1995) includes a central component of “processing of the
self as a social object” (Clark, 2001, p. 72). When a person
enters a feared social situation, anxiety symptoms, such as
increased heart and respiration rate, confirm preexisting
negative expectations that the situation is dangerous and

to be feared. This exaggerated interpretation of danger
within a social situation triggers a focus on the physiologi-
cal arousal associated with anxiety symptoms, along with
the negative thoughts and dysfunctional beliefs connected
with the social situation. The model proposed by Clark
and Wells (1995) informed the development of much of
the existing gold standard CBT procedures as described
above. In what follows, we explore the components of the
Clark and Wells model of social anxiety disorder as it per-
tains to stuttering.

Self-Focused Attention, Social Anxiety,
and Stuttering

According to the Clark and Wells (1995) cognitive

model of social anxiety disorder, entering a feared situation
triggers a shift toward what is referred to as self-focused
attention. This self-focused attention involves an excessive
and maladaptive preoccupation toward negative thoughts
and physiological symptoms associated with anxiety (Clark
& Wells, 1995; Ingram, 1990). Cognitive theories have
been supported by evidence clearly demonstrating that
self-focused attention plays a role in the maintenance
of anxiety with social anxiety disorder (Bögels & Lamers,
2002; Hoffmann, 2000; McManus et al., 2009; Wells &
Papageorgiou, 1998; Woody et al., 1997). There are sev-
eral mechanisms by which self-focused attention can main-
tain anxiety. An overview of these mechanisms is given
below, with reference to studies that have investigated
self-focused attention with social anxiety disorder and
stuttering.

Self-Focused Attention and Access to Feedback
From Social Situations

One prediction of the Clark and Wells (1995) model
of self-focused attention that is fundamental to social anxi-
ety disorder is “reduced processing of external social cues
when anxious” (Clark, 2001, p. 413). Such social informa-
tion could include positive feedback that has the potential
to disconfirm fears of poor performance and fear of nega-
tive social evaluation (Clark, 1999; Clark & Wells, 1995;
Ingram, 1990). Maladaptive self-focused attention with
social anxiety has been explored extensively, and research
has confirmed that self-focused attention is associated with
poorer recall of information from the social environment
and heightened recall of self-referential information (Daly
et al., 1989; D’Argembeau et al., 2006; Hope et al., 1990;
Mansell et al., 2003; Mellings & Alden, 2000).

Direct evidence has shown that adults who stutter
similarly appear to avoid positive social information during
a speaking task (Lowe et al., 2012). In that study, adults
who stutter and fluent controls gave a speech to a non–live
audience; the audience was prerecorded, and audience mem-
bers displayed a range of expressions, including showing
signs of being interested or uninterested or having neutral
expressions. Participants were led to believe that the audi-
ence was real and was sitting in another room during the

speaking task. Participants who stuttered, compared with
fluent controls, looked less at the audience during the speech.
Furthermore, a tendency by the participants who stuttered
to avoid looking at the interested audience members was
associated with increased self-reported anxiety. The avoid-
ance of positive information within social settings for adults
who stutter (Lowe et al., 2012) is consistent with findings
for social anxiety disorder (Chen et al., 2002; Pishyar et al.,
2004, 2008).

Self-Focused Attention and Attentional Biases

The most significant consequence of self-focused at-
tention is that it can result in failure to receive information
and feedback from others during social situations. This has
been confirmed in laboratory studies with social anxiety
disorder using various research methods. One such method
to evaluate attention is the probe detection task (MacLeod
et al., 1986). For this task, emotionally valenced stimuli
are presented on a computer screen. Examples of such
stimuli are negative, positive, or neutral words or pictures
of faces displaying negative, positive, or neutral expres-
sions. Participants press a button on a device or keyboard
following a cue. Participant reaction times are recorded,
and latencies are assumed to reflect biases in attentional
processing.

The probe detection task has been used extensively

in research with social anxiety disorder, demonstrating at-
tentional biases to avoid threatening stimuli (Chen et al.,
2002; Mansell et al., 2003, 1999; Pineles & Mineka, 2005).
However, Lowe et al. (2016) were unable to replicate the
effect using the same design and stimuli with participants
who stuttered and were not socially anxious. In contrast,
higher trait anxiety was associated with a tendency to look
toward threatening stimuli, which is consistent with studies
that have investigated attentional biases with general social
anxiety (Bradley et al., 1999; Macleod et al., 1986). Inter-
estingly, a similar effect to that reported by Lowe et al.
(2016) has recently been found with adolescents who were
not socially anxious. Rodgers et al. (2020), using a modi-
fied probe detection task, reported that the participants
looked toward faces with threatening expressions faster
than toward those with neutral expressions and that they
looked away from faces with threatening expressions fas-
ter than from those with negative expressions. However,
McAllister et al. (2015) reported that young people who
stutter with higher scores on a social phobia subscale di-
rected attention toward faces with sad expressions. The dis-
parity of results, using tasks that aim to assess attentional
biases, highlights nuances with the task design and partici-
pant characteristics that have also been demonstrated in the
literature about attentional biases and social anxiety.

Self-Focused Attention and the Maintenance
of Fears and Negative Beliefs

According to the Clark and Wells (1995) model, when
a person with social anxiety enters a feared social situation,

62 Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (cid:129) Vol. 64 (cid:129) 59–74 (cid:129) January 2021

anxiety symptoms, such as the heart beating fast, feeling hot
and flushed, and increased breath rate, confirm negative
thoughts that the situation is dangerous and to be feared.
This exaggerated interpretation of danger within a social
situation triggers a tendency to focus intently toward the
physiological arousal associated with anxiety, increasing
the salience of anxiety symptoms. Consequently, the infor-
mation obtained from that inward focus of attention is
recalled during postevent evaluations, confirming negative
beliefs and expectations of poor performance (Clark &
Wells, 1995). The biased recollection of anxiety symptoms
in the absence of accurate and potentially positive informa-
tion confirms fears and dysfunctional beliefs about danger
and risk of negative consequences associated with social sit-
uations (Clark & Wells, 1995).

There is evidence to suggest that adults who stutter
may focus their attention toward negative thoughts about
stuttering and the negative consequences of stuttering (Boyle,
2013b; Boyle & Fearon, 2018; Cream et al., 2003; Jackson
et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2015; St Clare et al., 2009; Tudor
et al., 2013) and, more specifically, to the physiological
arousal associated with moments of stuttering (Lowe et al.,
2015). This is not surprising because negative emotions asso-
ciated with stuttering have been well documented and include
feelings of guilt, shame, embarrassment, fear, helplessness,
isolation, and frustration (Bloodstein & Bernstein Ratner,
2008; Corcoran & Stewart, 1998; Hugh-Jones & Smith, 1999;
Sheehan et al., 1962; Yaruss & Reardon, 2002). Negative
thoughts about stuttering have been comprehensively docu-
mented in the context of developing the Unhelpful Thoughts
and Beliefs About Stuttering scale (Iverach et al., 2011;
St Clare et al., 2009). Examples of negative thoughts in-
clude “It’s impossible to be really successful in life if you
stutter,” “I won’t be able to keep a job if I stutter,” “No one
will like me if I stutter,” and “People will think I’m boring
because I have nothing to say.” Furthermore, Boyle (2013a)
developed the Self-Stigma of Stuttering Scale. This scale is
designed to assess the extent to which a person agrees with
and applies stereotypical attitudes toward themselves. The
scale includes items that portray negative thoughts about
stuttering: “Because I stutter, I feel less capable than people
who don’t stutter,” “Most people in the public believe that
people who stutter are insecure,” and “I believe that most
people who stutter are nervous.”

The potential for self-focused attention to be associ-

ated with well-documented negative consequences is im-
portant to consider for those who stutter. As with social
anxiety disorder, the focus of attention toward negative
thoughts and emotions by those who stutter is likely to
maintain fears of negative consequences of stuttering and,
overall, maintain anxiety.

Self-Focused Attention and Spontaneous Imagery

Clark (2001) also states that a prediction of the Clark
and Wells (1995) model is that social anxiety disorder causes
those affected to experience “distorted observer-perspective
images of how they think they appear to others when in

feared social situations” (p. 414). For example, these images
depict scenes of the self from the perspective of another.
Such scenes convey incorrect, exaggerated content, such as
seeing the self with a twisted face, with distorted features,
or seeming much smaller than others in the image. This has
been demonstrated for those with social anxiety disorder
(Conway et al., 2004; Hackmann et al., 1998; Kenny &
Bryant, 2007; Wells & Papageorgiou, 1999). The recall of
scenes from the perspective of the observer is thought to
maintain negative fears and beliefs, as it is this information
that is recalled during post-event evaluations rather than
accurate feedback from the social interaction (Clark &
Wells, 1995). Furthermore, such scenes feature prominently
during anticipatory processing of social encounters (Clark
& Wells, 1995). Combined with faulty predictions of poor
performance during social situations, faulty negatively
valenced imagery can lead to negative consequences and
maladaptive behaviors. For instance, negative anticipatory
processing of impending social events may lead to avoid-
ance of the situation. However, if a situation cannot be
avoided, anticipatory processing may induce self-focused
attention during the event, thereby perpetuating inaccurate
processing of the encounter (Clark & Wells, 1995). The
cycle of anxiety maintenance is therefore reinforced.

In the case of stuttering, two studies have investigated

the recall of memories with adults. Tudor et al. (2013) re-
ported more recall by stuttering participants of recurrent,
intrusive, and negative imagery during speaking situations
than by controls. Lowe et al. (2015) reported that, when
comparing participants who stutter with a control group,
the stuttering group was more likely to recall an observer
perspective when recalling social events. Furthermore, the
participants who stutter recalled images of how they thought
they appeared to others rather than memories of images
of what, in reality, was within their visual fields during
the interaction. For those who stutter, recalling negatively
valenced observer-perspective images is likely to maintain
fears of poor performance during social interactions and
maintain fear of negative evaluation from others. In the
same way that negative observer-perspective recall of
memories with social anxiety can maintain anxiety, such
biased recall of memories is likely to maintain anxiety with
those who stutter. However, this clearly requires further
investigation.

Safety Behaviors, Social Anxiety, and Stuttering

Cognitive models of social anxiety disorder incorpo-
rate the use of safety behaviors and suggest they maintain
anxiety (Clark & Wells, 1995). For example, perceived
social danger prompts those affected by social anxiety to
engage in behaviors or rituals to minimize the occurrence
of feared outcomes (Salkovskis, 1991). With social anxiety
disorder, a common safety behavior is avoidance, for ex-
ample, avoiding eye contact with others, avoiding situa-
tions, or talking to specific people (Clark & Wells, 1995;
Marks, 1969; Ohman, 1986; Wells & Clark, 1997; Wells
et al., 1995). As with self-focused attention, using safety

Lowe et al.: Management of Speech and Anxiety With Stuttering 63

behaviors has been demonstrated to contribute to the
maintenance of anxiety with social anxiety disorder (Sal-
kovskis, 1991; Wells & Clark, 1997; Wells et al., 1995).

It has been suggested that safety behaviors maintain

anxiety through several mechanisms. For instance, when
safety behaviors are used to reduce anxiety, if the feared
outcome does not occur, the person attributes this to the use
of the safety behavior. The safety behavior is then repeated
in future situations to reduce anxiety, and the cycle of
anxiety maintenance continues (Salkovskis, 1991; Wells &
Clark, 1997; Wells et al., 1995). For example, a person may
avoid talking during meetings at work due to fear of nega-
tive evaluation from others. This avoidance reduces anxiety
in the immediate situation; however, the same fears continue
in future situations, and the person therefore continues to
use avoidance strategies to manage the anxiety.

Using safety behaviors can tax attentional resources,
which can, in turn, affect performance during social encoun-
ters, such as engaging with others. Perceptions of poor
performance confirm fears and beliefs, which, in turn, main-
tain anxiety (Clark & Wells, 1995).

The use of safety behaviors can increase the likelihood
of the feared outcome occurring. For example, avoiding eye
contact can decrease opportunities to engage in the social
encounter, increasing the risk of negative self-perceptions
of performance. Additionally, avoiding eye contact can lead
to the perception by others of reticence to engage in the
social encounter, leading to negative evaluation.

However, the most significant problem with using

safety behaviors is that fears are not challenged and,
therefore, persist (Lovibond et al., 2009; Salkovskis, 1991;
Wells & Clark, 1997). In other words, safety behaviors
prevent new learning that fears are irrational and beliefs
are inaccurate.

Considering the range of coping behaviors associ-

ated with stuttering, many could be considered safety be-
haviors. For example, there is ample documentation for
those who stutter to avoid topics, specific words, and eye
contact (Corcoran & Stewart, 1998; Cream et al., 2003;
Crichton-Smith, 2002; Hayhow et al., 2002; Jackson et al.,
2015; Kraaimaat et al., 2002; Lowe et al., 2012; Mahr
& Torosian, 1999; Martens & Engel, 1986; Plexico et al.,
2005; Vanryckeghem et al., 2004; Yaruss & Reardon, 2002).
Situation avoidance is common among those who stutter.
Many who stutter recall that, as children, they avoided
situations such as participating in class discussions, answer-
ing questions, reading aloud, and seeking help from teachers
(Hugh-Jones & Smith, 1999; Klompas & Ross, 2004; Plexico
et al., 2005; Silverman & Zimmer, 1982). Furthermore,
extreme types of avoidance include truanting, and with-
drawing from school and not undertaking further education
in order to avoid talking are commonly reported (Crichton-
Smith, 2002; Hugh-Jones & Smith, 1999; O’Brian et al.,
2011).

There is emerging evidence that, indeed, those who
stutter engage in safety-seeking behaviors to avoid feared
outcomes. In a recent survey, adults who stutter who en-
rolled in the iGlebe program (see above), for treatment of

social anxiety, reported engaging in behaviors that are
considered to be safety behaviors (Lowe et al., 2017). Such
behaviors included to “mentally rehearse sentences,” “keep
answers short,” and “avoid difficult words.” Cream et al.
(2003) reported that adults who stutter rehearse sentences
and responses and that they manipulate situations to avoid
the unpredictability of being asked questions. Systemic
functional linguistic analyses have shown that adults who
stutter alter their use of language to limit conversational
engagement with others (Lee et al., 2015; Spencer et al.,
2005, 2009). Lee et al. (2015) suggest this may be a coping
strategy used to avoid potential negative events associated
with interacting with others. Further evidence of the use of
safety behaviors by adults who stutter is demonstrated by
the anticipation of stuttering. The anticipation of stutter-
ing has been shown to result in the use of strategies such
as avoidance or changing the content of speech and lan-
guage, such as substituting words anticipated to be stuttered
(Jackson et al., 2015; Vanryckeghem et al., 2004).

An Emerging Clinical and Theoretical Conflict
The field is well under way with treatments for man-

aging persistent stuttering and social anxiety associated
with stuttering, and there are encouraging signs that such
developments may be translatable and scalable with Inter-
net-based versions (Erickson et al., 2016; Menzies et al.,
2016; Van Eerdenbrugh et al., 2018). Concurrent with the
more recent development of formalized CBT procedures
for social anxiety for those who stutter, research has pro-
vided some insights about the underpinning processes that
may sustain social anxiety with those who stutter. These
processes are self-focused attention and safety behaviors.
In the following sections, we develop the idea that

these recent advances raise clinical and theoretical ques-
tions about current clinical management of stuttering. We
propose that speech restructuring and psychological ap-
proaches for stuttering may, in fact, be in direct conflict
with one another. This conflict may provide an explana-
tion for the failure of many adults who stutter to maintain
their speech treatment benefits. Accordingly, we will con-
clude with recommendations for interim clinical manage-
ment of stuttering and research that may contribute to the
resolution of this conflict.

Self-Focused Attention and Speech
Restructuring Treatment

We speculate that self-focused attention, as discussed
earlier, could affect speech performance, even in the absence
of techniques to manage stuttering. Adults who stutter,
having dealt with stuttering and its consequences through-
out life, may have a stronger tendency for self-focused at-
tention than those with social anxiety disorder in general.
Anticipating stuttering, monitoring speech, and modifying
spoken language in an attempt to avoid stuttering—as dis-
cussed earlier—are examples where attention is focused

64 Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (cid:129) Vol. 64 (cid:129) 59–74 (cid:129) January 2021

inwardly at the expense of attending to and participat-
ing in interactions with others.

Predictably though, self-focused attention is likely to
have detrimental effects on the ability to implement speech
restructuring techniques. Maladaptive attentional focus
toward unhelpful thoughts and beliefs, or other salient
symptoms of anxiety, can tax attentional resources available
to implement speech restructuring techniques. Therefore,
excessive and maladaptive self-focused attention may be
one explanation for the Iverach, Jones, et al. (2009a) find-
ings that those participants with mental health and anxiety-
related disorders failed to maintain their speech treatment
outcomes.

Conversely, another possible explanation for post-

treatment relapse rates for particularly anxious participants
is that, although speech restructuring can provide control
of stuttered speech, it has the potential of also enhancing
self-focused attention. Clients who have received speech
restructuring treatment need to focus inwardly, in situations
where stuttering control is desired, with constant attention
to their use of the novel speech pattern (Block et al., 2005;
Curlee, 1993; Howie et al., 1981; Langevin et al., 2010).
Additionally, during many treatment approaches, clients
are taught to monitor and evaluate their stuttering severity
to assess change over time during treatment and to monitor
speech over time. This self-monitoring may occur at the
expense of attending to the social interaction and receiving
accurate feedback from others. In the presence of anxiety
and associated negative thoughts and beliefs, lack of cor-
rective feedback from attending to the interaction can lead
to the maintenance of maladaptive thoughts and beliefs
and overall persistence of anxiety.

Additionally, adults who stutter feel different from
fluent speakers, and, even after behavioral speech treat-
ment, that perception remains. Before treatment, stuttering
is the point of difference; however, following treatment
with speech restructuring, it is the fluency technique that
discerns them from fluent speakers (Cream et al., 2003;
Finn & Ingham, 1994; Metz et al., 1990). This is an impor-
tant issue in the context of fear of negative evaluation from
others that adults who stutter experience (Cream et al.,
2003). Furthermore, fear of negative evaluation about how
others will perceive the sound of a novel fluency technique
is likely to tax attentional resources needed to use the tech-
nique. Consequently, this fear of negative evaluation may
provide an explanation for the high failure rates to main-
tain speech treatment outcomes. Those who stutter may
be reticent to use a technique to minimize their stuttering
due to fear of negative evaluation about how the technique
sounds.

Safety Behaviors and Speech
Restructuring Treatment

It is well established that safety behaviors can main-
tain anxiety for those with anxiety disorders (Helbig-Lang
& Petermann, 2010). For those who stutter, the use of
safety behaviors is also likely to maintain anxiety. In turn,

persistent anxiety may lead to a reticence to use speech
restructuring techniques. Safety behaviors can impact on
the capacity to be present and engaged in social encoun-
ters and can increase the risk of negative self-perception of
social performance (Clark & Wells, 1995). As proposed by
Clark and Wells (1995), biased perceptions of performance
can confirm fears and maintain anxiety. Furthermore,
using safety behaviors can impact on social performance,
thereby increasing the risk of negative evaluation from
others, which could confirm fears of poor performance,
hence maintaining anxiety (Clark & Wells, 1995). As with
anxiety disorders, the use of safety behaviors by those who
stutter, in an attempt to avoid negative consequences, could
prevent fears being challenged and, hence, could maintain
anxiety. Additionally, safety behavior use by those who
stutter could have the consequence of affecting speech per-
formance and, more specifically, maintain or exacerbate
stuttering.

As has been established as a theme for this review

article, speech treatment procedures may be in conflict with
psychology theory about safety behavior use. Inadvertently,
in the context of speech treatment, speech-language pathol-
ogists (SLPs) may recommend that their clients use safety
behaviors. This was highlighted in a study by Helgadóttir
et al. (2014b), in which 169 Australian SLPs were surveyed.
The SLPs were asked to comment on how often they rec-
ommended that their clients use certain behaviors. Those
behaviors had previously been categorized by clinical psy-
chologists as potential safety-seeking behaviors. The most
frequently recommended items on the list included “rehearse
opening line of telephone call before making call” and
“choose safe or easy people to talk to in socially threaten-
ing situations.” Additionally, around half of the respon-
dents reported to recommend suggesting to their clients
the following: “If you are feeling anxious, try to avoid dif-
ficult syllables,” “If you are feeling anxious, try to avoid
difficult words,” and “If you feel like you are having a bad
day, skip unnecessary talking.”

However, critical to the thesis of this review article, if
speech structuring techniques are sought and used to avoid
feared consequences of stuttering, in itself, the treatment
could be considered a safety behavior. Indeed, there is evidence
that speech restructuring is used as a means of protection
from harm (Cream et al., 2003). One possible explanation
for the failure of participants to maintain their speech treat-
ment benefits in the Iverach, Jones, et al. (2009a) study
is that if speech restructuring is used as a safety behavior,
anxiety is maintained, self-focused attention is increased,
cognitive resources are reduced, and speech restructuring
techniques are unable to be used effectively to control
stuttering.

Treatment for stuttering using speech restructuring
techniques requires ongoing practice to maintain the skill
in order to continue to control stuttering during everyday
speaking situations. Many of the safety behaviors from
the Helgadóttir et al. (2014b) list were specifically about
the use of speech restructuring techniques, such as “prac-
ticing speech technique immediately before an important

Lowe et al.: Management of Speech and Anxiety With Stuttering 65

speaking situation.” However, in the context of safety be-
haviors, if such behaviors are used to moderate anxiety and
not merely used to practice the speech motor technique, there
is ample reason to foreshadow that such behaviors have the
potential to sustain anxiety (Lovibond et al., 2009). Clearly,
this matter warrants urgent investigation.

Clinical Applications

Overall, this emerging conflict between speech restruc-
turing procedures and social anxiety needs to be considered
in the context of clinical practice. The main issues that
have been discussed are that speech restructuring (a) may
induce or increase self-focused attention, (b) may promote
the use of safety behaviors, and (c) may become a safety
behavior itself. Therefore, it appears there is a conflict
between speech restructuring treatment and CBT for social
anxiety that needs to be dealt with by clinicians during cli-
ent management. Craig and Hancock (1995) reported that
perceived relapse by adults who stutter was associated
with high trait anxiety levels, and Iverach, Jones, et al.
(2009a) reported that high rates of anxiety and mental
health disorders were associated with a failure to maintain
treatment benefits. According to these findings, these so-
called relapse rates could apply to as many of two thirds
of adults who present to clinics for assistance with their
stuttering.

For clients with clinically significant social anxiety,
speech restructuring used to control stuttering may come
at a cost. Speech restructuring techniques could trigger or
worsen social anxiety by promoting self-focused attention.
In general, focusing on implementing speech techniques is
likely to impact on attentional resources available to engage
fully in the interaction. Furthermore, postevent processing
of the situation is therefore likely to draw on self-perceptions
of performance due to lack of accurate information from
the situation, as has been proposed with social anxiety dis-
order (Clark & Wells, 1995). In addition, when speech
restructuring techniques are used as a safety behavior, they
may prevent the extinction of fear and anxiety for those
who stutter. That cost may be increased if the clinical pro-
cess causes both effects: triggering or worsening social
anxiety while concurrently preventing its extinction. There-
fore, based on the Iverach, Jones, et al. (2009a) report,
speech restructuring may be contraindicated in the pres-
ence of social anxiety and may perpetuate the “revolving
door” effect with client health care for stuttering. If a cli-
ent’s perceived need to control stuttering is driven by so-
cial anxiety, the use of speech restructuring to attain that
control may, in effect, maintain their anxiety and, in turn,
prevent effective stuttering control. In short, speech restruc-
turing for such clients could potentially be more clinically
harmful than helpful. As such, in the event that a client is
experiencing social anxiety and could concurrently benefit
from control of stuttering, the SLP has a challenging situa-
tion to deal with. At present, there is little empirical guid-
ance about this matter, and, as discussed below, more is
needed urgently.

Dealing With This Clinical Conflict

The first stage of dealing with this clinical issue in-
volves assessment. The assessment process clearly needs to
consider both speech and psychological domains. Drawing
on Baer’s (1988, 1990) accepted statement, central to the as-
sessment and treatment process are the complaints of those
seeking behavioral treatments. Therefore, if a client is seek-
ing clinical help to minimize their stuttering, to some extent,
this should be considered during the clinical interview with
the knowledge that there is a sound clinical trial evidence
base in support of clinical efforts to achieve such a goal.
However, screening for anxiety and, in particular,
social anxiety now seems essential for all cases of persis-
tent stuttering, based on recent evidence demonstrating the
high rates present within clinical caseloads (Iverach, Jones,
et al., 2009a; Menzies et al., 2008; Stein et al., 1996). For
adults, existing anxiety screening resources can be recom-
mended. To assess the expectation of negative evaluation
from others, the eight- or 10-item Brief Fear of Negative
Evaluation scale can be used (Carleton et al., 2007, 2011,
2006; Collins et al., 2005; Duke et al., 2006; Leary, 1983;
Rodebaugh, Woods, et al., 2004; Weeks et al., 2005). Clini-
cally, this measure can be used to assess fear of negative
evaluation and potential anxiety in order to determine the
need for referral to a psychologist. To screen for disorder-
specific potential markers of anxiety, the six-item screening
version of the Unhelpful Thoughts and Beliefs About Stut-
tering scale (Iverach, Heard, et al., 2016) can be used. If
needed, the full version of the scale (Iverach et al., 2011;
St Clare et al., 2009) is useful as a guide for a clinical in-
terview about the topic or as an indicator of the need for
a clinical psychology assessment. This process of assess-
ment may be ongoing during treatment as potential indica-
tors of anxiety or failure to make progress with speech
treatment may appear.

If, based on screening and clinical interview, the cli-
nician forms a view that clinically significant anxiety is not
an issue with an adult seeking to minimize their stuttering,
then, potentially, there would appear to be no problem pro-
ceeding with current evidence-based treatments aimed at
reducing stuttering. For clients with subclinical levels of so-
cial anxiety, it is unknown at present if speech restructuring
will induce self-focused attention, safety-seeking responses,
and associated effects. In the interim, it is advised to pro-
ceed with caution during speech restructuring treatment.
It may well be that for some clients, for whom stuttering
management is important, a trade-off needs to be estab-
lished between that need and the potential to develop social
anxiety. However, if a client presents with a need for stut-
tering and social anxiety management, what is yet to be
established empirically is how best to proceed, for instance,
whether speech restructuring or CBT should be introduced
first, whether and how they can be combined, or how treat-
ment procedures may be modified to take account of the
potential conflicts described above.

As discussed earlier, Van Riper (1973) and several
later studies have reported the use of CBT procedures to

66 Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (cid:129) Vol. 64 (cid:129) 59–74 (cid:129) January 2021

deal with anxiety for adults and adolescents who stutter
(Andrews & Craig, 1982; Andrews & Feyer, 1985; Blood,
1995; Boberg & Kully, 1994; Craig & Andrews, 1985;
Howie et al., 1981; Maxwell, 1982). Typically, during the
speech treatment, those reports combined various CBT pro-
cedures in an attempt to remove fears and reduce avoidance
behaviors. Those procedures included desensitization, such
as openly stuttering while attempting to reduce avoidance
behaviors, exposure tasks, thought stopping, locus of con-
trol, and relaxation procedures. As noted by Craig et al.
(1987), the CBT procedures used in some of those early
studies were a “developing and experimental aspect of the
course, and as a result is not as structured as the behavioral
change aspects of the programme” (p. 59).

Van Riper’s (1973) text provides a detailed account of
anxiolytic procedures included within a broader treatment
approach. However, as noted in the introduction, there-
have been no clinical trials of those treatment approaches.
In subsequent studies (Andrews & Craig, 1982; Andrews
& Feyer, 1985; Blood, 1995; Boberg & Kully, 1994; Craig
& Andrews, 1985; Howie et al., 1981; Maxwell, 1982), the
CBT components that featured with speech restructuring
procedures were not consistently documented, nor was there
documentation of psychological responses to those CBT pro-
cedures. Regardless, it is possible that the CBT procedures
used may have been incompatible with the speech treatment
procedures, explaining the high relapse rate (Craig et al.,
1987). However, that is conjecture only, because those early
studies did not report standard participant diagnoses of anx-
iety disorders. Since those studies, it has been established
that a diagnosable social anxiety disorder is the predominant
anxiety condition associated with stuttering.

At present, the evidence available for the CBT pro-

gram for social anxiety with stuttering involved adminis-
tration either before or after speech restructuring treatment
(Menzies et al., 2016, 2008). Interestingly, while the CBT
program is capable of removing social anxiety disorder
diagnoses, there is no evidence for this treatment reducing
stuttering severity when measured by blinded observers.
However, preliminary evidence is emerging that, following
the CBT program, self-reported stuttering severity decreased
in the absence of speech treatment (Menzies, Packman,
et al., 2019). Furthermore, in another study by the same
research group, participants who received the CBT program
as a supplement to speech restructuring treatment reported
improved self-ratings of stuttering severity in the absence of
such an effect for observer ratings of percent syllables stut-
tered (Menzies, O’Brian, et al., 2019). Notably, the speech
restructuring treatment in the Menzies et al. (2008) and
Menzies, O’Brian, et al. (2019) studies was not complete, as
all fluency technique practice regimes, hierarchical transfer
tasks, and anxiolytic treatment components had been re-
moved. Consequently, as previously noted by Menzies et al.
(2008), the results of such studies cannot be compared to
speech outcomes from reports of complete speech restruc-
turing treatments.

These issues require further exploration in future stud-

ies, but one interpretation so far is that CBT may improve

perceptions of performance and, specifically, perceptions
of the cost of stuttering, irrespective of observer evaluation.
While this can be viewed positively in light of CBT out-
comes, the discussion earlier about the potential conflict
between speech restructuring and CBT approaches requires
consideration. It may be that speech restructuring proce-
dures could be dampening potential CBT effects beyond
that reported in preliminary studies, and, potentially, CBT
procedures may be clouding speech restructuring outcomes.
While the studies investigating CBT for social anxiety

with those who stutter are preliminary, several consider-
ations are necessary for future research, including sample
size and the presence of psychological diagnoses, which
may impact treatment outcomes. For instance, there has
been an emergence of research reporting on the presence
of mental health conditions associated with adult stutter-
ing, including anxiety and mood disorders (Iverach, Jones,
et al., 2009b; Iverach et al., 2010; Tran et al., 2011).
Clearly, further research is urgently needed.

An Essential Research Plan

It is essential to empirically clarify issues raised in this

review article about the potential conflict between speech
restructuring treatment approaches for stuttering and social
anxiety associated with stuttering. Clinically, it will be es-
sential to determine if speech restructuring procedures in-
duce potential maladaptive information processing biases
such as self-focused attention and attentional biases, which
can maintain anxiety. In the event that this is determined,
speech restructuring treatment approaches would need to
be modified. One procedure may be to ensure that those who
are treated with speech restructuring direct their attention
more adaptively toward cues and stimuli in the social envi-
ronment that can provide accurate and potentially discon-
firming feedback about fears. It could be justifiably argued
that those who stutter do experience negative consequences
as a result of stuttering. However, it is common for those
who are socially anxious to overestimate the probability
and cost of negative outcomes (Brundage et al., 2017). Typ-
ically, strategies taught during CBT involve teaching clients
to identify maladaptive cost and probability estimates and
modifying these appraisals to more realistic and likely levels.
This approach is detailed in Menzies et al. (2009).

It is now reasonable to consider which behaviors those
with stuttering might engage with that have the potential to
be safety behaviors (Helgadóttir et al., 2014b; Lowe et al.,
2017). However, in order to be confirmed as safety behav-
iors, they require empirical confirmation of their capacity
to prevent fear extinction and maintain anxiety. At the out-
set, such a research plan is complicated by the possibility
that not all safety behaviors will be clinically unhelpful to
the treatment process (Rachman et al., 2008; Thwaites &
Freeston, 2005). The initial and judicious use of safety be-
haviors may, in fact, assist to engage with treatment and
complete necessary treatment tasks, as has been shown with
anxiety and phobia disorders (Hood et al., 2010; Milosevic
& Radomsky, 2008, 2013). For instance, in the short term,

Lowe et al.: Management of Speech and Anxiety With Stuttering 67

safety behaviors may assist clients to complete practice and
exposure tasks, and that may prove to be clinically benefi-
cial in the long term. For example, adults who stutter may,
during the early stages of treatment when learning to use the
speech restructuring technique, initially choose safe or easy
people to talk with in socially threatening situations. How-
ever, as proficiency using the fluency technique improves,
this strategy of avoiding talking with people who are not
considered safe or easy to talk to could become a safety-
seeking behavior. For instance, if one always avoids talking
to people not considered safe, to avoid negative outcomes,
there will be no opportunity to challenge fears and, impor-
tantly, it is likely to maintain anxiety. A consequence of only
speaking to safe and easy people would profoundly limit
the potential to meet new people that could lead to lasting
friendships, fulfilling relationships, and life experiences. How-
ever, in the first instance, it will be important to explore
whether such behaviors maintain anxiety. An experimental
laboratory protocol could determine whether potential
safety behaviors used by those who stutter do prevent fear
extinction.

In any event, it is unknown whether those with per-
sistent stuttering routinely use safety behaviors. This issue
could be explored initially with a laboratory protocol in-
volving a speech to strangers, which is a situation often
feared by those who stutter (Trotter & Bergmann, 1957;
Vanryckeghem et al., 2017). Participants could identify
particular behaviors or rituals they use in such a scenario
and then be instructed to use or not use the behavior. Fur-
thermore, the use of safety behaviors during a speech could
be regressed using measures that would include those that
are translatable to clinical practice in speech-language pa-
thology, such as stuttering severity, the Brief Fear of Nega-
tive Evaluation scale, the Unhelpful Thoughts and Beliefs
About Stuttering scale, and the Self-Stigma of Stuttering
Scale. This would enable the exploration of constructs known
to be related to safety behaviors, such as anxiety, unhelpful
thoughts, and disproportionate fear.

To overcome the potential issue of speech restructuring

being a safety behavior, laboratory studies could draw on
psychological theory and systematically include exposure
tasks while participants learn speech restructuring. An exam-
ple of such a study could include exposure while learning
speech restructuring, alternating between using and not using
the technique during speaking tasks. They would then evalu-
ate the outcomes of using and not using the speech restruc-
turing technique in terms of probability and cost of negative
evaluation from others about stuttering and use of the speech
restructuring technique. Furthermore, such exposure and
cognitive restructuring exercises have the potential to enable
clients to evaluate the cost and consequences of stuttering
more realistically when their ability to use speech restruc-
turing is not as effective, such as when fatigued or unwell.

Such a program of research, as outlined above, should

include participants from as young as the early adolescent
years. As with every clinical advance with this disorder, the
earlier that treatment can be administered during the course
of the disorder, the better.

Conclusions

The issues raised in this review article are complex.
Many adults who stutter will present to speech clinics and
experience social anxiety at levels that warrant a diagnosis
of social anxiety disorder. Cognitive theories have confirmed,
by empirical research, that several processes are involved in
the maintenance of anxiety for social anxiety disorder. These
processes form the basis of well-established CBT procedures
for anxiety disorders. However, there is emerging evidence
that the same processes that are associated with anxiety
maintenance for social anxiety disorder appear to also be
used by those who stutter. It appears that evidence-based
speech treatment procedures that target control of stutter-
ing are in conflict with treatment procedures that deal with
social anxiety and can potentially induce or exacerbate those
processes involved in anxiety maintenance.

This review article proposes suggestions for future

research to investigate this potential conflict. Such research
should explore the potential for speech restructuring treat-
ment to increase self-focused attention or to become a safety
behavior. The results may inform the direction of research
efforts toward modifying speech restructuring treatment
approaches or to psychological treatment approaches that
may ameliorate these effects. Such research efforts may
lead to the development of optimal speech and psycholog-
ical treatments for those who stutter that have long-term
treatment and economic benefits. In the interim, it is recom-
mended that clinicians who treat persistent stuttering con-
tinually monitor their clients for anxiety and consider, in
consultation with their clients, the most personally presenting
concern: managing speech behaviors or anxiety management.
