Simple Summary: Equine-assisted therapies (EATs) are often applied to patients with diﬀerent types
of either mental or physical conditions. The increasing application of EATs has induced interest
in the scientiﬁc community about equine well-being during these therapies. This study aimed to
investigate whether equine-assisted therapy (EAT) creates negative or positive emotions in horses and
the inﬂuence of patients’ therapy expectations (one group of patients had physical and psychological
expectations, and one group of patients had only psychological expectations) on horses’ behavioral
and physiological responses. We observed 58 pairs (patient–horse) during EAT sessions and when the
horses were at rest. Then, we compared the horses’ behavioral and physiological responses between
the diﬀerent periods of therapy and among the groups of patients. Our results suggested that the EAT
in this study was neither a negative nor a positive event. EATs with patients who had both physical
and psychological expectations were more challenging for horses than those with patients who had
only psychological expectations. Further research on EAT should focus on providing horses with
positive stimulation and reinforcement to understand whether a positive association with EAT can
be created.

Abstract: Equine-assisted therapies (EATs) have been widely used in the treatment of patients with
mental or physical conditions. However, studies on the inﬂuence of equine-assisted therapy (EAT) on
equine welfare are very recent, and the need for further research is often highlighted. The aim of
this study was to investigate whether EAT creates negative or positive emotions in horses, and the
inﬂuence of patients’ expectations (one group of patients had physical and psychological expectations
and one group of patients had only psychological expectations) on horses’ emotional responses.
Fifty-eight pairs (patient–horse) were involved in this study. Behaviors and heart rate variability
(HRV) data were collected during a resting phase, a preparation phase in which the patients brushed
and saddled the horse, and a working phase. Behaviors and HRV were compared between phases and
among the groups of patients. Our results suggested that the EAT in this study was neither a negative
nor a positive event. EATs with patients who had both physical and psychological expectations
were more challenging for horses than those with patients who had only psychological expectations.
Further research should focus on providing horses with positive stimulation and reinforcement to
understand whether a positive association with EAT can be achieved.

1. Introduction

2 of 12

Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) is a term that is commonly used to describe any modality
using animals to improve the physical, mental, and social conditions of humans [1]. These interventions
have proven eﬀects in applications for autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, behavioral
problems, and emotional well-being [1–3]. Other medical issues in which this therapy has been applied
include Parkinson’s disease [4], heart failure [5], cerebral palsy [6], and neurological impairments and
applications for children with developmental delays [7].

AAIs that involve equines are usually deﬁned as equine-assisted therapies (EATs) or equine-assisted
activities (EAAs) [8]. EATs have been used to improve social, emotional, and physical domains in
patients suﬀering from anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, and spinal
cord injury or to improve balance, muscle symmetry, coordination, and posture [6,8,9].

Animal welfare has become a major concern in all activities that involve animals, including animal
production [10], sports [11], work [12] and even pet ownership [13]. The awareness of the welfare of the
animals used in EATs is a focus of interest to the scientiﬁc community along with its applications [14].
The most commonly used physiological indicators of animal welfare focus on the negative impact of an
activity on animal welfare, assuming the absence of a negative impact to be associated with well-being
or “positive welfare” [15]. However, the deﬁnition of positive welfare includes not only the absence of
negative experiences or feelings, but also the presence of positive experiences or feelings [16]. This
means that the study of animal welfare should include both negative and positive indicators.

Equine-assisted therapy (EAT) activities that involve horseback riding appear to be no more
stressful for horses than recreational horseback riding activities [14,17]. Additionally, in a previous
study, interactions between patients experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and horses assisting
in their therapy were found to be equally stressful as the interactions between healthy humans and
horses [18]. The authors of this study suggested that horses respond more to physical cues than to
emotional cues from humans [18].

Many studies of EATs that have investigated behavioral and/or physiological aspects have
suggested that EAT activities do not produce negative outcomes, such as stress, in horses [18,19].
Considering the absence of negative outcomes, some authors have suggested that EAT may produce
positive outcomes for horses [14]. However, one study that investigated both negative (plasmatic
cortisol concentrations and heart rate variability) and positive (plasmatic oxytocin concentrations)
outcomes of EAT found no diﬀerence between the parameters [20]. Nevertheless, there are relatively
few studies on EATs, and only one investigated positive outcomes of these activities.

Some authors have demonstrated that heart rate variability (HRV) is a suitable tool to study
equine emotional responses in animals involved in EAT [21]. HRV analysis the autonomic nervous
system (ANS) activity [22]. The frequency domain analysis of HRV studies the sympathetic (SNS)
and parasympathetic (PNS) components of the ANS [23]. This analysis includes parameters, such as
low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and very low frequency (VLF); these are inﬂuenced by the
respiratory rate, which varies according to species; therefore, the frequency band widths should be
adapted in this type of analysis [24,25].

Each of the described HRV parameters reﬂects diﬀerent aspects of ANS activity [25]. Some authors
have suggested that LF may represent sympathetic activity [22,26]. HF is commonly considered a
marker of the cardiac vagal tone, and consequently, the parasympathetic system [22,23,27]. The LF/HF
ratio reﬂects the SNS–PNS balance [22,23,27]. The VLF component of HRV has been associated with
a slow recovery of the ANS balance after a mental or physical eﬀort [28]. The analysis of the ANS
activity provides an objective tool to study both positive and negative outcomes of EATs [16,29].

The emotional states are best assessed by a combination of behavioral and physiological
measures [30]. Physiological and behavioral indicators should include both positive and negative
outcomes for the assessment of equine emotional states and welfare [16]. Some behaviors have
been associated with negative emotions [14,19], while others have been associated with positive

Animals 2019, 9, 409

emotions [31]. Thus, these behaviors may be useful as negative and positive indicators of equine
emotions in association with physiological indicators.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether EAT creates negative or positive emotions in

horses and the inﬂuence of patients’ therapy expectations on horses’ emotional responses.

2. Materials and Methods

This project was approved by the Research Institute in Semiochemistry and Applied Ethology
(IRSEA) Ethics Committee (C2EA125) and the French Ministry of Research (APAFIS Process
number 11949).

General and speciﬁc information about the patients and the horses was collected through
a questionnaire survey. Patients’ medical conditions and expectations were collected with the
agreement of the patients and/or their families. Nevertheless, to respect patient conﬁdentiality,
the diagnoses and expectations of individual patients were not reported; instead, data were classiﬁed
into diﬀerent categories.

This study was conducted in Avignon, France, between March and July 2018.

2.1. Population

This study included nine horses (10 ± 3 years old) and 51 patients (18 ± 11 years old) who

participated in EATs.

The animals were recruited from two diﬀerent equestrian facilities. Housing conditions were
the same in both centers. Horses lived in paddocks that they shared with other conspeciﬁcs. The
population included four females and ﬁve geldings (six grade horses, one Mérens, one Halﬁnger,
and one Carmargue). These horses have been involved in EAT for: 9 years; 8 years; 6 years; 4 years;
two horses for 3 years; 2 years; 1 year; and 6 months.

The patients involved in this study have been diagnosed with diﬀerent medical conditions
(see Table 1). From the patients’ and therapists’ perspectives, the expectations for improvement related
to these therapies could be divided into two categories: psychological (PSY) or both physical and
psychological (PHY + PSY) expectations.

The statistical unit considered for this study was the pair (patient + horse). Some of the included
patients had therapy with diﬀerent horses on diﬀerent days. Fifty-eight pairs of patient–horse were
involved in this study.

2.2. Study Design and Data Collection

This investigation included a resting phase and two phases of EATs (preparation and

working phases).

The resting phase consisted of the collection of HRV data in the normal living and husbandry

conditions of the horses.

Animals 2019, 9, 409

The preparation phase consisted of controlled interactions between the patient and the horse, such
as petting, brushing, saddling, cleaning the horses’ feet, and feeding or watering the horses. These
interactions diﬀered according to the patients’ needs and abilities, and were selected by the therapists.
Preparative sessions were performed near the paddocks.

The working phase followed the preparation phase. The patients could either ride or perform
in-hand training with the horses. In-hand training included the following: the approach and the
initial contact with the horse, making the horse move forward or backward, leading the horse to cross
obstacles or pass parallel bars on the ground, and lunging the horse in a round pen. The therapists
made the decision of whether the patient should ride or perform in-hand training. Working sessions
were performed in riding arenas of variable size.

Each phase lasted between 20–30 minutes, and took place between 09:00–13:00 and 14:00–16:00

during the day.

Behavior data were collected for both the preparation and working phases by one observer
through direct observation. The considered behaviors included “ears pinned back” (EPB), “head lateral
movement” (HLM), “snort”, and “defecation” (see Table 2) [14,31]. These parameters were assessed in
terms of frequency.

HRV data were collected during all the phases with Polar V800 Equine

equipment (Kemple,
Finland). Then, the collected data were transformed with Kubios
software (Kuopio, Finland),
and only normal R-R intervals were considered for the HRV analysis. The described data included
time domain (heart rate) and frequency domain analysis (see Table 3). Frequency band thresholds were
established within each frequency interval using the following parameters: LF power = 0.005–0.07 Hz;
HF power = 0.07–0.5 Hz; VLF power = 0.001–0.005 [25].

2.3. Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS 9.4 software Copyright © 2002-2012 by (SAS Institute

Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The signiﬁcance threshold was classically ﬁxed at 5%.

Animals 2019, 9, 409

2.3.1. Data

5 of 12

The duration of each phase diﬀered according to the patient’s responses to the therapy. For horse
behaviors, the proportion of the frequency over the duration of the given phase was calculated to
standardize this variable among diﬀerent phases. Finally, the frequency of each behavior per minute
(freq/min) was considered for the statistical analysis.

HRV data were analyzed as raw data to compare the diﬀerences between the two EAT phases and
between the two categories of patients’ therapy expectations. Then, the diﬀerences (∆) between the
preparation and resting phases and between the working and resting phases were calculated to study
the evolution of these parameters from resting to the two diﬀerent EAT situations. These parameters
were deﬁned as ∆HR, ∆VLF, and ∆LF/HF ratio.

2.3.2. Statistical procedures

For HR and the LF/HF ratio, the assumption of normality of the data was tested using residual
diagnostics plots and the UNIVARIATE procedure. Comparisons between phases and between
patients’ expectations were performed with the general linear mixed model using the MIXED procedure
(two-factor analysis). When signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found, multiple comparisons were analyzed
with Tukey’s test using the LSMEANS statement.

For EPB, HLM, and VLF, the assumption of normality of the data was tested with the
above-described procedure, although the assumption was not veriﬁed. Then, box-cox transformation
was performed. The assumption of normality of the data was retested using residual diagnostics
plots and the UNIVARIATE procedure. Comparisons between phases and between patients’
expectations were performed with the general linear mixed model using the MIXED procedure.
When signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found, multiple comparisons were analyzed with Tukey’s test using
the LSMEANS statement.

For the diﬀerences in the cardiac parameters (∆HR; ∆VLF; ∆LF/HF ratio), the assumption of
normality of the data was tested with the above-described procedure, although the assumption was
not veriﬁed. Then, the data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon Signed-rank’s test (for paired samples).
For snort and defecation frequencies, data were transformed into binary variables, because the
animals did not perform this behavior very often. In this case, the following code was adopted: 1 – the
behavior was observed; 0 – the behavior was not observed. Comparisons between phases and patients’
expectations were performed with the generalized linear mixed model using the GLIMMIX procedure.
When signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found, multiple comparisons were analyzed with Tukey’s test using
the LSMEANS statement.

3. Results

A few patients could not participate in one of the phases, as participation was not recommended
due to their medical state, which lead to an absence of data. The lack of data concerned three patients
in the preparation phase and one patient in the working phase.

One patient was highly disturbed by the presence of the observers during the preparation phase,
so the therapists decided to remove the observers from the patient’s visual ﬁeld. Therefore, it was not
possible to observe the horse’s behavior during this phase.

One session occurred during feeding time. This caused a distraction for the horse, which was
looking at the animal keepers feeding the animals, signiﬁcantly increasing the HLM parameter.
Therefore, the data concerning this parameter in the preparation phase were removed from the analysis.
In one working phase, a side walker was required to ensure the patient’s safety. This unexpected
situation clearly modiﬁed the horse’s behavior. As some behavioral or HRV parameters were inﬂuenced
by this condition, the authors decided to remove them from the statistical analysis (EPB, HLM, LF/HF
ratio, and ∆LF/HF ratio).

Due to technical issues related to the heart rate monitor, the HRV data of two horses in the working

phase were not recorded.

3.1. Behavior

There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in EPB between the diﬀerent phases, the two groups of patients’
therapy expectations, or the interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations (phases: DF = 1;
F = 0.40; p = 0.53; patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 0.13; p = 0.72; interaction of phase*patients’
therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 1.64; p = 0.21).

Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed for HLM in the interactions between phases and patients’
therapy expectations (interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 6.60; p = 0.01).
More precisely, in the preparation phase, horses performed on average two times more HLMs with
the PSY group than with the PHY+PSY group. Additionally, horses involved in therapies with the
PSY group performed on average two times more HLMs in the preparation phase than in the working
phase (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Equine-assisted therapies eﬀect on Head Lateral Movement (freq./min.): eﬀect of
phase*patients’ therapy expectations. Mean ± standard error. * p < 0.05.

There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in snort concerning either the diﬀerent phases or the patients’
therapy expectations (phases: DF = 1; F = 0.05; p = 0.82; patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 0.05;
p = 0.82; interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 0.00; p = 0.99).

Defecation was only observed 11 times over a total of 111 EAT observations (preparation +

working). For that reason, statistical analysis with a model was not applicable for this behavior.

3.2. HRV

HRV results concerning the interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations were not signiﬁcant
for any of the studied parameters (HR: DF = 1; F = 1.46; p = 0.23; VLF: DF = 1; F = 1.27; p = 0.27; LF/HF
ratio: DF = 1; F = 0.56; p = 0.46).

3.2.1. Phase Eﬀect

Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in HR, VLF, and the LF/HF ratio were observed between phases (HR: DF = 1;
F = 76.67; p < 0.001; VLF: DF = 1; F = 4.59; p = 0.04; LF/HF ratio: DF = 1; F = 9.80; p < 0.01). More
precisely, an increase of 10 beats per minute (bpm) on average in the horses’ HR between the preparation
and working phases was observed. VLF and the LF/HF ratio were signiﬁcantly higher in the working
phase than in the preparation phase (see Table 4).

Animals 2019, 9, x 6 of 12  influenced by this condition, the authors decided to remove them from the statistical analysis (EPB, HLM, LF/HF ratio, and ΔLF/HF ratio). Due to technical issues related to the heart rate monitor, the HRV data of two horses in the working phase were not recorded. 3.1. Behavior There was no significant difference in EPB between the different phases, the two groups of patients’ therapy expectations, or the interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations (phases: DF = 1; F = 0.40; p = 0.53; patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 0.13; p = 0.72; interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 1.64; p = 0.21). Significant differences were observed for HLM in the interactions between phases and patients’ therapy expectations (interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 6.60; p = 0.01). More precisely, in the preparation phase, horses performed on average two times more HLMs with the PSY group than with the PHY+PSY group. Additionally, horses involved in therapies with the PSY group performed on average two times more HLMs in the preparation phase than in the working phase (see Figure 1). There was no significant difference in snort concerning either the different phases or the patients’ therapy expectations (phases: DF = 1; F = 0.05; p = 0.82; patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 0.05; p = 0.82; interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 0.00; p = 0.99). Defecation was only observed 11 times over a total of 111 EAT observations (preparation + working). For that reason, statistical analysis with a model was not applicable for this behavior. Figure 1.

HRV HRV results concerning the interaction of phase*patients’ therapy expectations were not significant for any of the studied parameters (HR: DF = 1; F = 1.46; p = 0.23; VLF: DF = 1; F = 1.27; p = 0.27; LF/HF ratio: DF = 1; F = 0.56; p = 0.46). 3.2.1. Phase Effect Significant differences in HR, VLF, and the LF/HF ratio were observed between phases (HR: DF = 1; F = 76.67; p < 0.001; VLF: DF = 1; F = 4.59; p = 0.04; LF/HF ratio: DF = 1; F = 9.80; p < 0.01). More precisely, an increase of 10 beats per minute (bpm) on average in the horses’ HR between the preparation and working phases was observed.

Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the ∆HR, ∆VLF, and ∆LF/HF ratio values were observed between
phases (∆HR: preparation: median = −3.000 VS working: median = 9.000; S = 570; p < 0.001; VLF:

LF/HF ratio inversely changed from the resting phase to the other phases (see Table 4).

3.2.2. Eﬀect of Patients’ Therapy Expectations

Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in the LF/HF ratio between the two groups of patients’
therapy expectations (patients’ therapy expectations: DF = 1; F = 5.83; p = 0.02). More precisely,
the LF/HF ratio was higher in the PHY+PSY group than in the PSY group (see Figure 2). There were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in HR and VLF between the diﬀerent groups of patients’ therapy expectations
(HR: DF = 1; F = 1.74; p = 0.19; VLF: DF = 1; F = 0.42; p = 0.52).

4. Discussion

The results obtained with the diﬀerent parameters showed that EAT may induce some behavioral
and physiological changes in horses. Nevertheless, the results obtained regarding HRV, in particular
LF/HF, were within the normal range in both phases [21]. Thus, these responses could not be linked to

that have suggested that EAT does not increase stress [14,19,20].

Considering the studied behaviors, the HLM frequency was lower in the PHY+PSY group than in
the PSY group during preparation, suggesting that horses searched more for visual information [14]
with the PSY group than with the PHY+PSY group. This result could be explained by the curiosity of
horses about unusual types of interactions. In addition, a decrease in the HLM frequency from the
preparation to the working phase was observed in the PSY group, suggesting that interactions required
more visual contact for the horses during the preparation phase than during the working phase.
Nevertheless, the observed frequencies of all the behaviors in this study were very low. In general,
in this study, horses performed EPB and HLM less than one time per minute. Snort was only performed
in approximately half of the observations. Defecation was observed in 11 out of 111 observations.

EPB and defecation, as well as HLM during riding sessions, are behaviors that are commonly
associated with negative emotions [14,19]. Snort was previously considered a behavior related to
arousal [32–34], but recently, this behavior has been associated with positive situations [31]. The
relationship between each of these behaviors and either a positive or negative situation or emotions is
interesting, because such relationships may indicate that the EAT activities in the present study were
neither positive nor negative for the horses, as none of the behaviors were frequently expressed by
the animals.

4.2. HRV

In terms of the HR, an increase of approximately 10 bpm between the preparation and the working
phases was observed. VLF was less than 1% in the preparation phase, and a small increase from the
preparation to the working phase was observed, although VLF was still less than 1% after the increase.
Concerning the LF/HF ratio, an increase of approximately 1.8 times between the preparation phase and
the working phase was observed. Additionally, the LF/HF ratio of the horses involved in EAT with the
PHY+PSY group was approximately 1.7 times higher than that of the horses involved in EAT with the
PSY group.

Regarding the ∆ values, a decrease in HR of 3 bpm from the resting phase to the preparation
phase and an increase of 9 bpm from the resting phase to the working phase were observed. Moreover,
the VLF showed a small decrease (0.02) from the resting phase to the preparation phase, and a higher
increase (0.23) from the resting phase to the working phase. Finally, a decrease in the LF/HF ratio from
the resting phase to the preparation phase and an increase in the LF/HF ratio from the resting phase to
the working phase were observed. Nevertheless, values of LF/HF appear to indicate physiological
changes, and usual LF/HF values in EAT horses could be considered to range between 2–5 [21]. Besides
the observed variability, the results of the present study concerning the LF/HF ratio were all within the
above-described range.

Horses involved in other equestrian activities may show an increase in HR that can exceed 100 bpm
during working/training sessions [35,36]. The EAT activities in this study were performed at a low
intensity level, which explains the low levels of the HR changes observed in this study. Declining
trends in the VLF component of HRV have been related to slow recovery of the ANS balance, and have
also been associated with heart disorders [28]. However, in our study, we observed a short decrease in
VLF in the preparation phase, which was immediately balanced during the working phase. An increase
in the LF/HF ratio represents an increase in sympathetic activity, while a decrease in the LF/HF ratio
represents an increase in parasympathetic activity [26,28]. In our study, an increase in this ratio was
observed in the working phase, which could be associated with attempts by the horses to cope with the
situation. In addition, patients in the PHY+PSY group induced higher LF/HF ratios than the patients
in the PSY group. This suggests that therapies with patients in the PSY group were less challenging to

Animals 2019, 9, 409

the horses’ emotional state than therapies with patients in the PHY+PSY group. However, neither of
the groups represented a major stressor to the horses.

4.3. General Discussion

The beneﬁts of EAT for people with mental and physical disabilities have been the subject of
many investigations, which have demonstrated improvements in the muscle activity, social skills,
and reductions in the anxiety of patients suﬀering from diﬀerent medical conditions [6,8]. As EATs are
getting popular, the welfare of horses involved in EATs has become a subject of increasing interest in
the scientiﬁc community [14,19–21,37].

EAT activities are usually performed at low levels of physical activity [21], which was also
observed in our study. Some authors have described HRV as a useful tool to study the emotional
balance of horses involved in EAT and assess the horse–human partnership [21]. Indeed, our results
support the use of HRV as an interesting tool to study equine perceptions of EAT because this analysis
allows the study of the animal’s response toward a stimulus and its capacity to subsequently recover.
Investigations about EAT have suggested that these activities are minimally stressful for horses
and could produce positive outcomes or emotions in horses [14,18,19]. Nevertheless, a recent study
suggested that EAT does not increase equine well-being [20]. The conclusions of that study relied on
HRV and the plasmatic concentrations of cortisol and oxytocin before, during, and after EAT sessions.
The assessment of oxytocin concentrations in equine plasma through enzyme immunoassay requires
an extraction phase, as described by Bienboire-Frosini et al. [38]. This procedure was not performed
in the previously cited study [20]. However, the results of HRV in that study were in line with the
results obtained in the present study. The results of the present study concerning both behavior and
HRV suggested that horses experienced neither negative nor positive emotions during EAT activities.
In addition, horses rapidly balanced their ANS after these sessions. Hence, we suggest that the horses
involved in EAT perceive EAT activities as neutral rather than negative or positive.

The positive or negative indicators of emotions could be considered one limitation in this study.
Snort has often been described as an indicator of negative emotions [32–34]; however, recently, some
authors have described this behavior as a positive indicator [31]. HLM was also described as an
indicator of negative emotions [14], although this behavior could also be related to the natural curiosity
of horses. These ﬁndings highlight the need for further research on the use of behavioral indicators
to study equine emotions, especially positive emotions. Nevertheless, in the present study, HRV
was also assessed to complement the behavioral assessment. This tool has been commonly used to
study stress or negative emotions, but positive emotions could also be studied through this analysis,
because positive emotions create modiﬁcations in the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
systems [16,29].

Another limitation to this study was the variability of the activities performed in each phase.
Activities such as brushing and cleaning the feet, as well as riding the horse or performing in-hand
work, may have induced diﬀerent reactions. The variability in the horses’ reactions to the diﬀerent
situations within each phase was not investigated in the present study, as the aim was to assess the
overall reaction of horses to the preparation and working phases, and to assess whether EATs were
perceived as positive or negative by the horses. Additionally, each group of patients in this study
included patients with diﬀerent illnesses, who may interact diﬀerently with the horses, producing
negative or positive outcomes.

Previous studies on EAT have focused on the negative outcomes that EAT activities could represent
for horses [14,19,20]. The results of these investigations suggested that there are no negative outcomes
related to EAT activities for the studied animals. In addition, our results suggested that there were
neither negative nor positive outcomes related to EAT for horses. Moreover, as described above,
there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between patients in the PSY and the PSY+PHY groups, but these
diﬀerences should be interpreted carefully, as the observed variables were within normal ranges [21].
These ﬁndings are of great importance, because they show that even if an event is not perceived as

Animals 2019, 9, 409

10 of 12

negative or does not induce a negative outcome for horses, a positive association with the event or a
positive outcome should not be expected.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, EAT was neither a negative nor a positive event for the horses in this study,
as demonstrated by the horses’ behavior and HRV parameters. Behavioral and HRV changes
were higher in horses involved in EATs with patients who had both physical and psychological
therapy expectations than in horses involved in EATs with patients who had only psychological
therapy expectations.

HRV is useful for measuring ANS activity, and thus assessing equine emotional balance during EAT.
Further research focusing on the positive aspects of these therapies for horses is required. This
future research should focus on improving equine welfare in EAT, e.g., providing horses with positive
stimulation and reinforcement, thus producing positive outcomes for the horses involved in EAT.
