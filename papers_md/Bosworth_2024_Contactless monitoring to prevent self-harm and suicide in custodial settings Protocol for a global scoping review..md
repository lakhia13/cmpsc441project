ABSTRACT
Introduction  Self- harm and suicide are major 
contributors to the global burden of disease and people in 
custodial settings are at a markedly increased risk of these 
adverse outcomes. Contactless monitoring technology is 
emerging as a possible solution to prevent self- harm and 
suicide by detecting and predicting vulnerabilities among 
people at increased risk in custodial settings in realtime, 
however no reviews to date have synthesized the evidence 
base, in the custodial context, regarding (a) the extent 
to which this technology has been implemented; and (b) 
the acceptability and feasibility of its application among 
custodial staff, specifically in relation to maintaining the 
wellbeing and safety of both incarcerated people and 
custodial professionals.
Methods and analysis  Our scoping review will be 
reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic reviews and Meta- Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews guidelines. We searched key electronic 
health and social science databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, 
Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest and Google Scholar) on 
5 February 2024 for peer- reviewed studies, which report 
on the use of contactless monitoring in custodial settings. 
Any type of study design was eligible, and the publication 
format was not limited. We included quantitative peer- 
reviewed journal articles, all types of reviews (narrative, 
systematic and meta- analysis) and did not apply study 
eligibility restrictions on country of origin. We will also 
search grey literature. Inclusion of publications will be 
restricted to the English language.
Ethics and dissemination  This review does not require 
institutional ethics review or approval as it is a review of 
studies that have already been granted relevant ethics 
approval. Our dissemination strategy includes a peer- 
reviewed publication and presentations at relevant national 
and international academic conferences. A plain language 
summary will be distributed through consumers and 
professional networks.

INTRODUCTION
is 
Self- harm  among 
a  significant  public  health  concern  glob-
ally,1 2 with an estimated prevalence of 5%–6% 
among  men  and  20%–24%  among  women 
incarcerated  in  the  UK.1  The  most  serious 
adverse  outcome  associated  with  self- harm 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ This scoping review uses a comprehensive search 

strategy including six academic databases.

 ⇒ Our review is further strengthened by the inclusion 
of  grey  literature,  enhancing  the  comprehensive-
ness of findings.

 ⇒ An  additional  strength  is  the  diverse  background 
of  the  research  team,  comprising  expert  by  lived 
experience  of  incarceration  and  mental  ill- health, 
academics, clinicians, managers, stakeholders and 
industry  professionals  with  expertise  in  various 
fields  including  psychology,  nursing,  engineering, 
police, medicine, justice health and forensic mental 
health.

 ⇒ A limitation of this study is that correctional officers 

are not included in the team of stakeholders.

 ⇒ Another  limitation  of  this  study  is  that  this  review 
will  be  limited  to  publications  only  in  the  English 
language.

in prison is suicide3 and, in 2020, the annual 
rate  of  suicide  among  incarcerated  males 
with  a  history  of  self- harm  in  England  and 
Wales  was  334  per  100  000,  compared  with 
95  per  100 000  for  incarcerated  individuals 
with  no  history  of  self- harm.3  Adolescents 
(ie, those aged 10–24 years)4 detained under 
the  criminal  justice  system  are  also  at  an 
increased  risk  of  suicidal  behaviours  when 
compared  with  their  age- and  sex- matched 
peers  in  the  general  population.5  In  2020, 
suicide was the most common cause of death 
among 
in  Europe, 
followed  by  COVID- 19  and  drug  overdose.6 
In Australia, 5.1% of people discharged from 
prison reported self- harm during the current 
period  of  incarceration  in  2022.7  In  2021–
2022,  of  the  63  deaths  in  Australian  prisons 
where  the  manner  of  death  was  recorded, 
25%  were  from  death  by  suicide  or  self- 
inflicted  and  22%  were  death  by  hanging.7 
The  burden  of  self- harm  among  people  in 
prison is likely to increase further, given the 

incarcerated  people

global imprisonment rate is also increasing annually, and 
importantly,  this  rate  is  increasing  at  a  faster  rate  than 
population  growth.1  8  9  The  health  profiles  of  people  in 
custody are often complex, with many living with co- oc-
curring  conditions;6  for  example,  approximately  50% 
of the global prison population living with non- affective 
psychosis  or  major  depression  are  also  living  with  a 
comorbid substance use disorder.10 This further increases 
the risk of other potentially fatal medical episodes during 
custody, particularly intoxication and overdose.11

Currently, a range of monitoring procedures are used 
in custodial settings to minimise adverse outcomes asso-
ciated  with  self- harm,  suicide  attempts  and  alcohol  and 
other substance use,12 as well as potential complications 
following  the  use  of  restraint  and  the  administration  of 
medications.13  Traditional  monitoring  methods  include 
risk  assessments  and  visual  observations,  both  physically 
and remotely, yet key differences exist. Risk assessments 
are informed by both clinical intuition and screening on 
entry  into  custody  and  as  circumstances  or  conditions 
change,14–16  assessing  for  signs  of  intoxication  and/or 
withdrawal, consciousness levels, head injuries, substance 
concealment  and  self- harm  or  non- fatal  suicide  attempt 
history.11  Risk  assessments  are  an  ongoing  process  and 
refer  to  structured,  point- in- time  evaluations  used  to 
determine whether increased monitoring such as contin-
uous observation or checks at specific intervals are indi-
cated.14  Risk  assessments  are  also  used  to  determine  if 
monitoring  can  be  decreased,  indicated  by  the  individ-
ual’s clinical condition and future risk factors for suicide 
or  self- harm.17  Visual  observations  refer  to  watching 
for  observable  changes  that  may  indicate  risk  and  may 
include physically checking for signs of life via positional 
changes, attempts to rouse when sleeping or movement 
in  the  rise  and  fall  of  the  chest,11  13  16  either  from  the 
cell door or remotely via closed- circuit teleision (CCTV) 
video surveillance.11 14 15 Monitoring vital signs (eg, heart 
rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature) is 
often beyond the scope of non- medical custodial staff and 
therefore dependent on the presence and input of health 
professionals.
Unlike 

intrusive  methods,  contactless 
monitoring  uses  contactless  techniques  and,  depending 
on  the  application,  different  technologies  may  be  used 
to  remotely  and  continuously  monitor  vital  signs  and 
evaluate  risk  factors  and  behaviours.18–20  These  include 
radar- based systems, machine learning, edge computing 
(processing data closer to a collection point, to act on data 
and  provide  faster  insights  in  real- time)19  21  and  image- 
and  non- image- based  systems.22  Contactless  monitoring 
technology  has  evolved  markedly  in  the  last  decade,18 
boasting a broad array of potential application scenarios 
spanning  not  only  the  corrective  services  sector22  23  but 
also  national  security,  aged  care,  MedTech,  home  care, 
livestock,  veterinary  services  and  healthcare.23  Contact-
less  monitoring  technology  is  emerging  as  a  solution  to 
supplement  current  monitoring  procedures  custodial 
staff use to monitor the well- being of people at increased 

traditional

risk while in their cells.12 14 By monitoring vital signs, risk 
factors  and  behaviours,  any  deviations  that  could  signal 
an impending health event can raise an alarm in real- time 
and alert the custodial staff, who can then intervene. The 
implementation  of  the  technology,  in  combination  with 
existing methods, may overcome some of the limitations 
of  traditional  monitoring.  Limitations  may  include  the 
reliance  on  physical  visual  checks  conducted  through 
spy holes, flaps in the door or perspex panels, the misin-
terpretation  of  life- threatening  conditions  for  drug  or 
alcohol  consumption,14  outdated  technology  affecting 
CCTV  quality  and  blind  spots,  complications  between 
scheduled  checks,13  ethical  privacy  concerns  and  over- 
reliance on these methods to the exclusion of others.24

technology 

While  contactless  monitoring 

shows 
promise for addressing critical health concerns in custo-
dial  settings,  its  development  stage  must  be  considered. 
Despite advancements, contact- based sensors remain the 
norm  in  healthcare.  Contactless  monitoring  is  not  yet 
a  standard  practice,  with  limited  literature  on  its  effec-
tiveness  on  acutely  unwell  or  deteriorating  patients.25 
Validation against gold standard measurements in tradi-
tional settings is unclear.25 Both radar- and camera- based 
techniques face challenges affecting accuracy and appli-
cability.26  A  review  by  Khanam  et  al  (2019)26  on  remote 
monitoring of vital signs in diverse non- clinical and clin-
ical scenarios using computer vision systems provides an 
assessment  of  image- based  monitoring  and  highlights 
some  deficiencies,  including  (1)  automatic  selection  of 
multiple regions of interest, (2) noise and motion artefact 
removal,  (3)  simultaneous  multiperson  monitoring,  (4) 
long- distance detection, (5) multicamera fusion, (6) low 
lighting conditions and (7) the lack of publicly available 
datasets  from  realistic  scenarios.26  Wireless  video- based 
patient  monitoring  was  reviewed  in  a  systematic  review 
by  Harford  et  al  (2017),27  identifying  several  significant 
shortcomings including (1) minimal testing or validation 
in clinical settings, (2) a predominant focus on neonates 
rather  than  children  or  adults  and  (3)  inadequate 
data  for  validation  in  laboratory  settings,  particularly 
concerning the duration of testing and the range of vital 
signs  assessed  in  healthy  participants.  Radar- based  tech-
nologies  also  encounter  issues  such  as  body  movement 
interference  and  the  lack  of  efficient  and  stable  signal 
processing  techniques  capable  of  handling  low  sample 
data.28 While Doppler radar has shown feasibility for vital 
sign  monitoring  in  controlled  environments,  additional 
work is needed to improve signal quality analysis for better 
breathing and heart rate estimation.24 In prison settings, 
additional sources of motion like ceiling fans and water 
movement  from  sinks  and  toilets  flushing  further  affect 
radar  signal  quality  and  increase  false  alarms.12  24  Thus, 
challenges  remain  to  widespread  adoption  in  clinical 
settings and necessitate further research.

Contactless monitoring technologies, while promising, 
often  show  reduced  accuracy  and  reliability  compared 
with  traditional  methods.  However,  studies  have  shown 
Doppler  radar  can  match  wearable  device  outputs

(2022)29  reported  93.2%–100%  accuracy  for  medical 
radar compared with contact- type ECGs and respiration 
belts.  Camera- based  measurements  also  perform  well 
under  ideal  conditions  but  highlight  performance  vari-
ability.29  30  When  considering  the  implementation  of 
contactless monitoring technology, it is important to note 
its current deployment and acceptance in clinical settings. 
Some areas, like neonatal intensive care units, use camera 
imaging- based  systems  using  imaging  photoplethysmog-
raphy (iPPG) for continuous monitoring, including heart 
rate, respiratory rate, skin temperature and oxygen satu-
ration.31  32  iPPG  has  also  been  used  for  patients  under-
going  haemodialysis.33  34  Trials  at  the  Royal  Melbourne 
Hospital involve radar imaging and thermal scanners for 
rapid  assessment  in  older  patients.35  A  review  by  Grech 
(2024)36  reported  on  15  hospital- based  studies  on  non- 
contact  red- green- blue  camera- based  heart  rate  and 
rhythm  monitoring  in  adult  clinical  settings,  including 
emergency  departments,  postoperative  care  units, 
general medical wards and haemodialysis units. However, 
the  review  highlights  ongoing  challenges  with  patient 
movement,  illumination  and  technique  standardisation 
that must be overcome for widespread adoption.36

Limited literature exists on staff perceptions of contact-
less monitoring. Ede et al (2021)37 explored intensive care 
unit  staff  expectations,  finding  the  concept  acceptable 
with  perceived  usability  benefits  for  both  patients  and 
staff. Contactless monitoring may offer a sustainable solu-
tion, yet staff need to be comfortable and familiar with the 
system  and  able  to  troubleshoot  issues  independently.37 
Nevertheless, perceived acceptability does not equate to 
proven reliability or accuracy of the technology. Despite 
the promise of this technology, the continuous collection 
of sensor data in healthcare settings presents significant 
ethical  concerns  about  privacy,  data  management,  bias, 
fairness  and  informed  consent.38  Therefore,  addressing 
these  issues  is  crucial  to  identify  and  mitigate  potential 
harms,  ensuring  transparency  and  accountability  and 
building trustworthy and ethically sound systems.38

Contactless  monitoring  technology  is  considered  to 
hold particular significance in addressing critical health 
concerns  such  as  self- harm,  suicide  and  substance  use 
in custodial settings.39 However, no reviews to date have 
synthesized  the  evidence  base,  in  the  custodial  context, 
regarding  the  feasibility  and  acceptability  from  the 
perspective  of  end  users,  including  people  detained  in 
custodial settings, custodial officers and healthcare staff, 
and  on  the  extent  to  which  contactless  monitoring  has 
been implemented in custodial settings. In this context, 
we have produced a robust protocol for the first scoping 
review globally to synthesize research relating to: (a) the 
contactless  monitoring  technologies  implemented  in 
custodial  settings;  (b)  the  benefits,  limitations  and/or 
challenges  of  implementing  contactless  monitoring  in 
custodial settings and (c) the knowledge, attitudes and/
or  perceptions  among  custodial  and  healthcare  staff 
towards contactless monitoring, specifically in relation to

maintaining the well- being and safety of both people in 
custodial settings and staff. It must be acknowledged that 
this  scoping  review  aims  to  map  the  existing  literature 
rather  than  provide  a  prevalence  estimate.  Therefore, 
the prevalence of existing studies should not be confused 
with the prevalence of the technologies used.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS
Protocol and registration
This  scoping  review  protocol  was  developed  according 
to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines40 and the 
review will adopt the approach of Arksey and O’Malley’s 
framework.41  We  will  follow  the  Preferred  Reporting 
for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta- Analysis 
Items 
(PRISMA)  protocols  and  apply  the  PRISMA  extension 
for  scoping  reviews  to  present  the  results42  (online 
supplemental 1).

Search strategy and information sources
We searched six key electronic health, social science and 
engineering  databases  (MEDLINE,  PubMed,  Scopus, 
Web  of  Science  and  ProQuest  and  Google  Scholar  was 
searched  via  Harzings  Publish  or  Perish)  for  studies 
published in English, which report on the use of contact-
less monitoring in custodial settings. Publication date was 
limited from database inception to 5 February 2024. We 
used  variants  and  combinations  of  search  terms  related 
to contactless vital sign monitoring, proof of life, police, 
custody,  prison,  jail,  self- harm  and  suicide.  The  search 
strategy  was  developed  in  consultation  with  a  research 
librarian  from  the  faculty  of  Science,  Medicine  and 
Health  at  the  University  of  Wollongong,  Australia,  to 
ensure optimal rigour (online supplemental 2). To locate 
additional relevant publications not identified during the 
database searches, reference lists of published review arti-
cles  will  be  scrutinised.  We  will  search  websites  of  rele-
vant authorities, organisations and stakeholders (eg, the 
International  Corrections  and  Prisons  Association),43 
the  International  Association  of  Chiefs  of  Police  and 
the Global Law Enforcement and Public Health Associa-
tion44 for any additional literature, including conference 
websites for relevant abstracts (eg, innovative technology 
conferences,  law  enforcement  technology,  police  tech-
nology  forums/conferences  and  corrections  technology 
conferences). Publication format will not be limited and 
will  include  qualitative  and  quantitative  peer- reviewed 
journal  articles,  including  all  types  of  review  (narrative, 
systematic  and  meta- analysis)  as  well  as  grey  literature. 
Any  type  of  study  design  was  eligible  (eg,  randomised 
controlled  trials,  case- control  studies,  prospective  or 
retrospective  cohort  studies,  quasi- experimental  and 
qualitative),  publication  format  was  not  limited,  and  no 
study  eligibility  restrictions  on  country  of  origin  were 
applied. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in 
online supplemental 3).

Study selection
Publication  details  and  abstracts  for  each  of  the  studies 
identified  through  the  electronic  search  were  imported 
into  EndNote21  reference  management  software45  and 
then  transferred  into  Covidence,46  before  duplicates 
were  removed.  Study  selection  will  consist  of  two  stages 
of  screening:  (1)  title  and  abstract  review  and  (2)  full- 
text review. During the first stage, the titles and abstracts 
of  all  remaining  studies  will  be  independently  screened 
by  Reb  B,  BE,  and  JK  against  specified  inclusion/exclu-
sion criteria for potential inclusion (online supplemental 
3).  PE  will  resolve  any  conflicts.  Roh  B  will  be  involved 
in  the  rescreening  of  10%  of  studies  included  in  the 
initial screen (title and abstract) to test the validity of the 
approach  and  discuss  potential  alterations.  During  the 
second  stage,  full- text  reviews  of  the  remaining  publica-
tions will be conducted independently by Reb B and BE, 
and reference lists of potentially relevant publications will 
be  manually  searched  against  specified  inclusion/exclu-
sion  criteria  to  locate  additional  references.  Forward 
searching will also be conducted.47 Double screening will 
be conducted during all stages of the review. Uncertainty 
regarding whether publications met the inclusion criteria 
will  be  resolved  through  discussion  among  members  of 
the  team.  In  instances  when  the  full  text  of  potentially 
relevant  publications  cannot  be  located,  a  maximum  of 
two  attempts  will  be  made  to  contact  the  author(s)  via 
email to request a copy. The JBI Critical Appraisal Check-
list  will  be  used  to  assess  the  methodological  quality  of 
all primary research publications by evaluating the extent 
to  which  they  addressed  the  possibility  of  bias  in  nine 
areas  of  study  design,  conduct  and  analysis.48  Scoping 
reviews  aim  to  provide  an  overview  of  evidence,  rather 
than produce a critically appraised and synthesised result; 
therefore, an assessment of methodological limitations or 
risk of bias is generally not performed.49 Included studies 
can be on any of (a) contactless monitoring technologies 
implemented  in  custodial  settings;  (b)  benefits,  limita-
tions  and/or  challenges  of  implementing  contactless 
monitoring  in  custodial  settings  and/or  (c)  knowledge, 
attitudes and/or perceptions of technology among custo-
dial staff.

Data extraction
Data  from  all  final  included  full- text  articles  will  be 
extracted  by  two  or  more  independent  reviewers  using 
a  data  extraction  tool  developed  by  the  authors.  Any 
disagreements  that  arise  between  the  reviewers  will 
be  resolved  through  discussion,  or  with  an  additional 
reviewer(s).  A  standardised  Excel  template  will  be  used 
to extract data which will include, yet will not be limited 
to,  details  regarding  author(s)  and  year  of  publication, 
country, study design, setting, participant characteristics, 
types  of  contactless  monitoring  implemented,  knowl-
edge/attitudes/perceptions  of  custodial  and  health-
care  staff  towards  the  feasibility  and  acceptability  of  the 
technology  and  relevant  evaluation  and  outcome  data, 
such  as  contactless  monitoring  trial  evaluations  and/

4

or  effectiveness/outcomes  of  currently  implemented 
technologies.

Text and tables will be used to collate, summarise and 
report  the  extracted  data.  Following  the  extraction  of 
relevant information, content analysis will be conducted 
on  the  extracted  data.  The  data  extraction  form  will  be 
refined  and  updated  throughout  the  review  based  on 
emergent findings, given a scoping review is an iterative 
process.  Modifications  will  be  detailed  in  the  scoping 
review.  Online  supplemental  4  outlines  the  preliminary 
data extraction plan for this scoping review.

Collating, summarising and reporting the results
Given a scoping review can be used to map the concepts 
underpinning a research area and the main sources and 
types  of  evidence  available,  a  narrative  summary  will 
accompany  the  tabulated  and/or  charted  results.  The 
summary  will  provide  an  overview  of  the  research  and 
describe  how  the  results  relate  to  the  scoping  review’s 
objective  and  question(s),  rather  than  an  assessment  of 
the quality of individual studies.

Risk of bias assessment
Scoping reviews do not typically include a risk of bias assess-
ment;40 therefore, this assessment was not conducted.

Patient and public involvement
In  accordance  with  the  BMJ  guidance  on  patient  and 
public  involvement  statement,50  public  partners  were 
engaged in this study. A public partner with lived experi-
ence of incarceration and mental ill health is involved in 
the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of 
this research. First, contact was sought to seek interest in 
collaborating with the team on the review, via email and 
a  follow- up  phone  conversation  to  provide  background 
and  context.  The  public  partner  was  advised  to  assess 
their interest after being advised of the potential burden 
involved.  This  includes  helping  the  researchers  review 
the  first  draft  and  provide  insight  and  feedback,  as  well 
as continuing to contribute to edits of the paper and be a 
co- author. Following consent, the member was provided 
with the first draft via email, and permission was sought 
to  follow- up  with  an  online  Zoom  meeting  to  discuss 
any  recommendations  or  feedback  and  allow  for  active 
contribution. The protocol and research questions were 
drafted  prior  to  engagement  with  the  public  partner, 
with  the  view  to  amend  as  required  as  engagement  was 
not sought prior to this point. Following review, based on 
the public partner’s experience of incarceration, a curi-
osity emerged as to the availability of the technology. The 
public partner shared their perceived benefits and limita-
tions on the technology as well as the perceived accept-
ability  by  custodial  staff.  Therefore,  the  draft  research 
questions  aligned  with  the  public  partner’s  experience 
and  areas  of  interest.  The  priorities  and  preferences  of 
the  public  partner  in  relation  to  the  topic  were  shared 
with  the  view  of  integrating  ideas  into  the  discussion  of 
the review. The public partner and research team will be

involved in dissemination. The team will be disseminating 
plain  language  findings  to  consumer  organisations  with 
an interest in the health of incarcerated individuals.

Ethics and dissemination
This review does not require institutional ethics review or 
approval  as  this  is  a  review  of  studies  that  have  already 
been granted relevant ethics approval. Our dissemination 
strategy  includes  a  peer- reviewed  academic  publication 
and presentations at relevant national and international 
conferences.  A  plain  language  summary  will  be  distrib-
uted through the authors’ and professional networks.
