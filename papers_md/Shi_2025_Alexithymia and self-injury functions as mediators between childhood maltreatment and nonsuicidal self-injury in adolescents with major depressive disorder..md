Childhood Maltreatment (CM) is a critical risk factor for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and major 
depressive disorder (MDD). However, the mechanisms by which CM influences NSSI through 
alexithymia and self-injury functions (SF) remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the mediating 
roles of alexithymia and SF in the relationship between CM and NSSI and to explore the interrelations 
among these variables in adolescents with MDD. The study sample included 260 MDD patients and 
125 healthy controls, with a mean age of 15.10 ± 1.74 years and 230 females (62.5%), and after 
propensity score matching (PSM), 166 MDD patients and 101 healthy controls were included in the 
final analysis. The primary variables examined were alexithymia, CM, self-injurious behaviors, and 
SF. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to evaluate the direct effect of CM on NSSI, as 
well as the mediating effects of alexithymia and SF. The prevalence of NSSI (65.1%), CM (78.3%), and 
alexithymia (77.1%) in MDD patients were significantly higher than in the control group, where the 
rates were 7.9%, 35.6%, and 41.6%, respectively (P < 0.001). The most common methods among MDD 
patients were cutting the skin (59.63%), pinching body parts until bleeding (60.24%), and inserting 
objects under the skin or nails (56.63%). SEM revealed that CM was directly associated with difficulty 
identifying feelings (DIF) (β = 0.439, P < 0.001) and depressive symptoms (β = 0.418, P < 0.001). Similarly, 
SF was strongly correlated with NSSI (β = 0.575, P < 0.001). However, there was no direct effect of 
CM on SF (β = 0.138, P = 0.171), nor of DIF on NSSI (β = -0.114, P = 0.115). Finally, CM had a significant 
direct effect on NSSI (β = 0.346, P < 0.001) and an indirect effect on NSSI through DIF and SF (β = 0.072, 
P = 0.022). This study demonstrates that difficulty identifying feelings and self-injury functions partially 
mediated the relationship between CM and NSSI. These findings highlight the importance of targeting 
key symptom nodes, specifically difficulty identifying feelings and self-injury functions, in interventions 
and treatment efforts for NSSI.

Non-suicidal  self-injury  (NSSI)  is  a  significant  mental  health  issue,  involving  the  deliberate  damage  to  one’s 
body  without  suicidal  intent1.  Common  methods  of  NSSI  include  cutting,  burning,  hitting,  and  scratching, 
with individuals often using sharp objects or causing injuries through direct physical trauma2. In the general 
population, the prevalence of NSSI was estimated to be around 4.6–32.8% in adolescents2–5 and 6.1–8.5% in 
adults6,7. And, previous research found that the prevalence of NSSI among adolescents with major depressive 
disorders (MDD) ranges from 48.2–76.1%8–10. NSSI is often a specific manifestation of poor treatment adherence 
and is closely associated with its risk factors, such as disease severity and substance use disorders11–13. While 
NSSI  may  serve  short-term  purposes,  such  as  relieving  emotional  distress  or  seeking  attention,  over  time  it 
contributes to greater emotional pressure and social isolation14,15. Moreover, although NSSI does not involve 
suicidal intent, recent research had showed that individuals within the first year of NSSI onset were more likely 
to develop suicidal ideation (odds ratio[OR]:2.37–5.89) and attempt suicide(OR:4.94–15.47) compared to those 
without NSSI16. These figures highlight the urgent need to explore the contributing factors to NSSI, particularly 
in adolescent patients with MDD.

According to the NSSI theoretical model, Childhood Maltreatment (CM) which includes physical, emotional, 
and sexual abuse, as well as neglect, was identified as a key risk factor for NSSI17. Although the prevalence of CM 
in the general population ranges from 16.4–55.4%18–20, due to differences in measurement tools and definitions, 
the rate of CM among individuals with depression was significantly higher(77.2–92.9%)21,22. Previous studies 
indicated  that  CM  was  positively  direct  associated  with  more  severe  depressive  symptoms  in  MDD  patients 
and associated with late-life depressive symptoms with dose-response patterns23,24. Furthermore, investigations 
showed that adolescents with MDD who had experienced CM were more likely to engage in NSSI and exhibited 
a  higher  frequency  of  such  behaviors  compared  to  those  without  a  history  of  maltreatment25.  For  example, 
recently  studies  found  that  adolescents  with  CM  have  a  1.13–1.22  times  increased  risk  of  self-injury26,27. 
Additionally,  literature  reports  a  positive  correlation  between  emotional  dysregulation  and  CM,  suggesting 
that it may be a risk factor for future self-injurious behavior28,29. While the direct link between CM and NSSI 
has been established, the specific pathways, such as the role of emotional functioning, Self-Injury Motivation, 
remain unclear and warrant further exploration.

Alexithymia  refers  to  a  reduced  focus  on  internal  emotions  and  difficulty  in  identifying  and  describing 
one’s own emotional states. The prevalence of alexithymia is reported to range from 12 to 36% in the general 
population30–32while among individuals with depression, the rate is typically higher, ranging from 57–70%33,34. 
Due to difficulties in accurately identifying and describing their emotional states, individuals with alexithymia 
often experience emotional dysregulation and tend to adopt maladaptive coping strategies. A study involving 
community  adults  found  that,  compared  to  participants  with  low  alexithymia,  those  with  high  alexithymia 
were more likely to use generally maladaptive regulation strategies, such as expressive suppression, behavioral 
withdrawal, and avoidance35. The occurrence of depression may be linked to these strategies. For instance, among 
adult patients with MDD, a network analysis found that alexithymia plays a key role in the somatization and 
emotional/affective manifestation of depressive symptoms36. Additionally, another consequence of emotional 
dysregulation may be the emergence of NSSI37.

Mediation  analysis  revealed  that,  in  addition  to  the  direct  effect  of  alexithymia  on  NSSI,  psychological 
resilience  and  depressive  symptoms  may  also  serve  as  mediators8,37.  This  suggests  the  potential  existence  of 
other mediating factors.

Self-injury functions behind NSSI were crucial to understanding the behavior itself. The motivation for self-
injury is often related to intrapersonal and interpersonal emotional needs. According to Nock and Prinstein’s 
psychosocial model, self-injury functions were classified into a four-factor model: intrapersonal/interpersonal 
and positive/negative reinforcement38. In studies on Chinese populations, this model had been further simplified 
and specified into a three-factor model: emotion regulation, attention-seeking, and social avoidance39.A meta-
analysis  revealed  that  66–81%  of  NSSI  patients  were  motivated  by  intrapersonal  factors,  such  as  “stopping 
negative emotions,” “seeking stimulation,” “escaping negative thoughts,” and “self-punishment“40. Similarly, in 
Chinese  adolescents  with  depressive  disorders,  emotion  regulation  and  social  avoidance  have  been  found  to 
mediate the relationship between anxiety and NSSI41. Although studies have found that adolescents with MDD 
who engage in NSSI exhibit greater emotional dysregulation, higher levels of alexithymia, CM, and self-injury 
motivation compared to non-NSSI patients, the specific relationships between these factors have not been clearly 
established29,42.

The  primary  aim  of  this  study  is  to  explore  the  relationship  between  CM  and  NSSI  in  adolescents  with 
MDD, and to test the hypothesis that alexithymia and self-injury functions serve as significant mediators in this 
relationship.

Methods
Participants
Adolescent patients were eligible to participate if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) diagnosed with 
major depressive disorder (MDD) based on a structured clinical interview following the DSM-5 guidelines; (2) 
aged 12–18 years and of Han Chinese ethnicity; (3) capable of comprehending the questionnaires; and (4) NSSI 
was defined as having at least five times of non-suicidal self-harm behaviors in the past 12 months39. Individuals 
with additional psychiatric or  neurological conditions,  or  intellectual disabilities, were excluded. The control 
group consisted of healthy adolescents aged 12–18 years, of Han Chinese ethnicity, with no history of psychiatric 
or neurological disorders. All participants were able to understand and complete the study questionnaires and 
were  recruited  from  local  middle  schools.  Initially,  260  patients  with  MDD  and  125  healthy  controls  were

enrolled. Due to incomplete questionnaires, 15 patients and 2 controls were excluded. The mean age of the total 
sample was 15.10 ± 1.74 years, with 230 females (62.5%).

Study design and procedure
This cross-sectional study was carried out between January and August 2021 in three general and four psychiatric 
hospitals across five cities in Anhui Province, China, including Hefei, Bengbu, Fuyang, Suzhou, and Ma’anshan. 
Participants and their guardians provided written informed consent after being briefed on the study’s objectives 
and procedures. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki as part of its ethical framework and received 
approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of Chaohu Hospital, Anhui Medical University (approval number: 
202009-kyxm-04). All procedures followed the relevant guidelines and regulations.

Data collection and measures
Participants’ demographic characteristics were collected, including gender, age, educational level (From 1 to 6, 
the numbers represent educational levels from 7th grade to 12th grade (Chinese middle school to high school)) 
and body mass index (BMI), which may be associated with self-injury43.

Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short form (CTQ-SF)
CTQ-SF  is  a  5-point  Likert  scale  consisting  of  28  items,  including  25  core  questions  and  3  validity  items44. 
CM experiences are assessed across five dimensions: emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional 
neglect, and physical neglect, with scores for each dimension ranging from 5 to 25. Cutoff scores indicating the 
presence of maltreatment are emotional abuse ≥ 13, physical abuse ≥ 10, sexual abuse ≥ 8, emotional neglect ≥ 15, 
and physical neglect ≥ 10. Participants who scored higher than the cutoff score in at least one of the subscales 
were  categorized  as  maltreated  The  Chinese  version  of  the  questionnaire  demonstrates  good  reliability  and 
validity(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81)45. The Cronbach’s α coefficient for this study was 0.847.

The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20)
TAS-20 is a widely used self-report measure for assessing alexithymia46. The scale consists of 20 items, rated 
on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). It includes three subscales: 
Difficulty Identifying Feelings, Difficulty Describing Feelings, and Externally Oriented Thinking. Higher scores 
on the TAS-20 indicate greater levels of alexithymia. Previous studies have demonstrated that the questionnaire 
exhibits good reliability in Chinese populations(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.79)47. The Cronbach’s α for this study was 
0.845.

 The Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI)
DSHI is a 17-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the frequency of 16 specific types of non-suicidal self-
injury behaviors, such as cutting and burning, along with one additional category for other unspecified NSSI 
behaviors48. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Higher total scores 
indicate more frequent NSSI. The Chinese version of the DSHI shows excellent reliability and validity(Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.82)49, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.911 in this study.

The 20-item center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (CESD-20)
The  Center  for  Epidemiologic  Studies  Depression  Scale  (CES-D)  consists  of  20  items  that  assess  depressive 
symptoms over the past week. Items are rated on a 4-point scale, from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most or 
all of the time), with total scores ranging from 0 to 6050. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. 
The  Chinese  version  of  the  CES-D  has  shown  good  reliability  and  validity  (Cronbach’s  alpha = 0.724)51.  The 
Cronbach’s α for this study was 0.848.

The functional assessment of self-mutilation-Chinese version (C-FASM)
C-FASM consists of 33 items, with 11 assessing self-mutilation types and 22 evaluating its functions52. Since the 
DSHI provides a more comprehensive assessment of self-harm behaviors, the FASM specifically focuses on the SF 
behind these behaviors. Previous research has indicated that the FASM can be categorized into three dimensions: 
Emotion Regulation (items 2,4,10,14, and 22), which involves using self-mutilation to manage emotional states; 
Attention Seeking (items 3,7,8,15,17, and 20), which refers to engaging in self-mutilation to gain social support 
and attention; and Social Avoidance (items 1,5,9, and 13), which involves using self-mutilation to avoid social 
demands39. Its Chinese version has demonstrated good reliability and validity (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84)52. The 
Cronbach’s α for this study was 0.970.

Statistical analysis
Mean ± standard  deviation  (SD)  and  frequency  distributions  (%)  were  calculated  for  the  descriptions  of 
continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Due to the association between gender, age, and self-injury, 
propensity  score  matching  (PSM)  was  conducted  using  the  MatchIt  package  with  a  2:1  ratio  (MDD:  health) 
and caliper 0.02, adjusting for gender and age as covariates52,53and applying a caliper of 0.02. The sample size 
(n = 166)  was  determined  based  on  the  standard  guideline  of  5–10  times  the  number  of  observed  indicators 
(12 indicators)54. Statistical power analysis using the semPower package demonstrated excellent power (0.989) 
for model estimation (effect size = 0.30, α = 0.05, df = 40)55. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were 
compared between the health and MDD groups using independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and 
chi-square test as appropriate, after assessing normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Spearman’s correlation was 
used to examine correlations between variables in patients with MDD.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to assess the fit of the measurement model and evaluate whether 
the observed variables effectively represented their corresponding latent variables of CM and SF. A structural 
equation model (SEM) was conducted using the lavaan package with the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) method 
due to non-normal variables, examined the relationship between CM and DSHI, with DIF, SF, and CESD as 
mediators, while controlling for gender and education level. Bootstrap resampling (5,000 iterations) was used to 
test mediation effects and ensure robustness56. The criteria for well-fitting models were as follows: χ2/df < 3, root 
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.08, comparative fit index (CFI) ≥ 0.95, Tucker–Lewis index 
(TLI) ≥ 0.95  and  Standardized  Root  Mean  Square  Residual  (SRMR) < 0.08.  All  analyze  were  conducted  using 
RStudio version 4.4.0 and statistical tests were two sided with statistical significance denoted at P < 0.05 (Fig. 1).

Result
Demographic and clinical characteristics of participates before and after PSM
After PSM, the final sample included 166 MDD patients and 101 healthy controls (Fig. 1). The mean age of the 
total  sample  was  15.19 ± 1.77  years,  with  151  females  (56.6%). There  were  no  significant  differences  between 
groups  in  terms  of  gender,  age,  educational  level,  or  BMI  (P > 0.05).  An  overview  of  the  study  population’s 
characteristics before and after PSM is provided in Table 1.

The prevalence of NSSI (65.1%), CM (78.3%), and alexithymia (77.1%) in MDD patients were significantly 
higher  than  in  the  control  group,  where  the  rates  were  7.9%,  35.6%,  and  41.6%,  respectively  (P < 0.001). 
Additionally, compared to the controls, MDD patients reported more severe depressive symptoms, stronger self-
injury functions, more frequent self-injury behaviors, and significant differences across all dimensions of CM 
and alexithymia, including difficulties identifying and describing feelings, as well as externally oriented thinking. 
(Table 1) (All P < 0.001).

Frequency of self-injurers and method
The most common methods were cutting the skin (MDD: 59.63%, Health: 10.89%), pinching body parts until 
bleeding (MDD: 60.24%, Health: 12.87%), and inserting objects under the skin or nails (MDD: 56.63%, Health: 
9.90%), neither MDD group or the healthy control group. In contrast, hair pulling (3.61%), burning the skin 
(3.01%), and using cleaning agents or bleach to rub the skin (2.41%) occurred less frequently (Table 2).

Correlation matrix for observed variables
Bivariate correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between NSSI and self-injury functions 
variables (emotion regulation, attention seeking, social avoidance), CM variables, difficulty identifying feelings, 
and CESD (All P < 0.05). Additionally, self-injury functions variables were significantly positively correlated with 
CM  variables,  difficulty  identifying  feelings,  and  CESD  (All  P < 0.05).  Difficulty  identifying  feelings  was  also 
significantly positively correlated with CM variables (emotional abuse, emotional neglect and physical neglect) 
and CESD (All P < 0.05). Furthermore, gender, education level, and age were significantly correlated with self-
injury  functions  variables  and  NSSI  (All  P < 0.05).  However,  BMI  was  not  significantly  associated  with  these 
variables (Table 3).

CFA and SEM analysis of CM, self-injury functions, and mediating mechanisms
Due  to  the  sexual  abuse  factor  loading  being  0.220,  which  is  below  the  threshold  of  0.4,  and  the  lack  of 
correlation between sexual abuse and other variables in the model, it was considered for removal57.The latent 
variable CM is comprised of four observed variables: emotional abuse, physical abuse, emotional neglect, and 
physical neglect, whereas the latent variable self-injury functions consist of three observed variables: emotion 
regulation, attention seeking, and social avoidance. Fit was acceptable for the final CFA model: χ2/df = 1.499, 
RMSEA = 0.055, CFI = 0.990, TLI = 0.979, and SRMR = 0.029 (Table 4).

The  model  fit  statistics  (χ2/df = 1.356;  RMSEA = 0.047,  CFI = 0.982,  TLI = 0.971,  SRMR = 0.066)  indicated 
acceptable  fit.  CM  were  directly  associated  with  difficulty  identifying  feelings  (β = 0.439,  P < 0.001),  CESD

(β = 0.418, P < 0.001), and NSSI (β = 0.345, P < 0.001). However, it didn’t show direct relations with self-injury 
functions (β = 0.138, P > 0.05). In turn, NSSI were directly and positively associated with self-injury functions 
(β = 0.575, P < 0.001), but not associated with difficulty identifying feelings (β = −0.114, P > 0.05). Additionally, 
self-injury functions were positive directly associated with difficulty identifying feelings (β = 0.286, P < 0.001) 
(Fig. 2).

The total indirect and total effect of CM on NSSI was positive and significant. Further analysis revealed that 
CESD (β = 0.102, P < 0.05) and DIF (β = 0.126, P < 0.05) fully mediated the relationship between CM and self-
injury functions (Indirect effect/total effect:1). Additionally, difficulty identifying feelings, self-injury functions 
(β = 0.072, P < 0.05) partially mediated the relationship between CM and NSSI (Indirect effect/total effect: 0.172). 
(Table 5).

Discussion
In this study, we found that the elevated prevalence of NSSI (65.1%) among MDD patients, compared to healthy 
controls (7.9%), was consistent with previous studies demonstrating that individuals with MDD were at a much 
higher  risk  for  engaging  in  NSSI5,9.  Among  the  16  types  of  self-injury,  the  most  common  methods  include 
cutting the skin, pinching body parts until bleeding, and inserting objects under the skin or nails. The choice of 
self-injury methods shows a pronounced preference, with considerable variation across different countries and 
regions. A study of South Korean high school students found that the most common self-injury method was 
preventing  wound  healing58.  Among  middle  school  students  in  Macau,  China,  common  self-injury  methods 
include hitting themselves, pulling their own hair, and biting themselves59. Similar to our findings, a study of 
psychiatric patients in mainland China identified cutting as the most common self-injury method, while burning 
was the least common39. This indicates cultural differences in adolescent self-injury methods.

In parallel, the significantly higher rate of CM in the MDD group (78.3%) compared to controls (35.6%) 
reinforces  the  well-established  link  between  early-life  adversity  and  the  development  of  mood  disorders. 
Research had shown that exposure to CM—such as emotional, physical, or sexual abuse—can lead to profound 
and long-lasting changes in neurobiological systems responsible for stress regulation and emotional processing, 
resulting in a significant increase in vulnerability to stressful situations60–62. Similar, a prospective study found 
that greater childhood maltreatment was associated with higher levels of depression symptoms in adulthood, 
along with alterations in reward-related resting-state functional connectivity63. Furthermore, the significantly 
higher  prevalence  of  alexithymia  (77.1%)  in  adolescent  patients  with  MDD  compared  to  controls  (41.6%) 
emphasized  its  role  in  the  development  of  depression.  Alexithymia  impaired  emotional  regulation,  making 
it difficult for individuals to process and express emotions, which increases stress, anxiety and contributes to 
the  persistence  of  depressive  symptoms64.  The  hypothesis  regarding  inflammatory  markers  and  alexithymia 
suggests that cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 may be linked to impaired emotional processing. Specifically, these 
markers are associated with a reduced ability to recognize emotions like anger and fear, as well as neutral facial 
expressions65.

Additionally, SEM revealed that difficulty identifying feelings served as a mediating factor in the relationship 
between  CM  and  CESD.  CM  often  disrupted  emotional  development,  making  it  harder  for  individuals  to

recognize  and  describe  emotions,  which  was  a  hallmark  of  difficulty  identifying  feelings.  A  network  bridge 
analysis of Chinese adolescents diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder shown a significant correlation 
between  CM  and  alexithymia  and  identified  emotional  abuse  and  difficulty  identifying  feelings  as  central 
nodes66. Another study similarly found that emotional abuse and emotional neglect were significantly associated 
with total TAS scores in adult patients with MDD67. Furthermore, this emotional dysregulation, in turn, leads 
to heightened depressive symptoms, as indicated by elevated CESD scores. A retrospective study conducted at 
a psychosomatic clinic in China found a significant positive correlation between difficulty identifying feelings 
and depressive symptoms68. And, among adults with severe affective disorders, difficulty identifying feelings was 
closely linked to feelings of hopelessness69. The mediating function of difficulty identifying feelings highlights its 
crucial role in linking CM with ongoing emotional and psychological challenges.

Most  importantly,  we  found  that  difficulty  identifying  feelings  and  CESD  fully  mediate  the  relationship 
between CM and self-injury functions, which indicated that childhood maltreatment did not directly lead to 
an increase in patients’ self-injury functions, but rather indirectly caused an increase in that through depressive 
symptoms and alexithymia. According to the attention assessment model, alexithymia was involved in the four 
stages  of  emotion  regulation:  identification,  selection,  implementation,  and  monitoring70.  And  alexithymia 
impairs  all  four  stages:  due  to  reduced  emotional  recognition  ability,  patients  struggle  to  categorize  their 
emotions, leading to confusion when selecting emotional coping strategies and during the implementation of 
emotion regulation, the lack of sensitivity to real-time emotional feedback results in discrepancies in the details 
of coping strategies71. Further research revealed that emotion dysregulation was bidirectionally linked to both 
negative and positive emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, leading NSSI patients to seek emotional 
release  or  increased  emotional  stimulation40,72,73.  This  is  consistent  with  our  findings,  which  indicate  that 
difficulty identifying feelings directly affects the emotion regulation. In addition to emotion regulation, another 
intrinsic motivation for NSSI, attention seeking, was also influenced by the regulation of difficulty identifying 
feelings. Previous studies found that alexithymia typically led to impaired emotional memory and decreased 
facial  mimicry  ability,  further  contributing  to  feelings  of  social  isolation,  loneliness  and  the  development  of 
psychosocial issues via blunted insula reactivity74–76. In contrast, high levels of social support significantly reduce 
the  likelihood  of  self-injury  among  adolescent  depression  patients77.  The  perceived  sense  of  social  isolation 
and loneliness may prompt patients to seek social attention and support from others78. Furthermore, beyond 
actively seeking social interaction, NSSI patients also express motivations for social avoidance, stemming from 
withdrawal in the face of real-life adversity and an attempt to escape social responsibilities. Due to diminished 
emotional recognition abilities towards themselves and others, NSSI patients may struggle to establish effective 
communication and maintain long-term relationships in social interactions. Emotional dysregulation may lead 
them  to  adopt  inappropriate  coping  strategies,  such  as  emotional  suppression  and  behavioral  withdrawal  to 
avoid social engagement35. Related studies showed that, compared to individuals with low alexithymia, those 
with  high  alexithymia  experienced  more  interpersonal  problems  and  displayed  a  stronger  tendency  toward

social avoidance79. Similarly, other studies also found that alexithymia had a more significant negative impact on 
prosocial behavior compared to autistic traits80,81. Finally, as we expected, another finding of this study indicated 
that  self-injury  functions  directly  influence  NSSI  and,  together  with  difficulty  identifying  feelings,  jointly 
mediates the effect of CM on NSSI in the SEM. In summary, our findings suggest that targeting interventions on 
difficulty identifying feelings and self-injury functions may be an effective approach to addressing NSSI.

Notable,  the  other  two  dimensions  of  alexithymia  (difficulty  describing  feelings,  externally  oriented 
thinking) were not correlated with CESD, NSSI, or CM variables. This may be because, compared to difficulty 
describing feelings and externally oriented thinking, difficulty identifying feelings played a more significant role 
in influencing emotional and psychological health82. Such as, related research found that individuals with higher 
levels  of  difficulty  identifying  feelings  reported  more  depressive  symptoms  and  increased  neuroticism83,84. 
Another  finding  of  this  study  is  the  absence  of  a  direct  effect  of  DIF  on  NSSI,  despite  a  significant  positive 
correlation observed in the correlation analysis. Alexithymia had been recognized as a crucial factor in both 
the onset and maintenance of NSSI85. And a retrospective survey from psychiatric outpatient clinics revealed 
that patients with alexithymia were 2.76 times more likely to exhibit NSSI behaviors86. The results of this study 
suggest that alexithymia may influence NSSI behavior more indirectly through self-injury functionality.

This  study  has  several  limitations  that  should  be  considered.  First,  its  cross-sectional  design  limits  the 
ability  to  establish  causal  relationships  between  CM,  alexithymia,  depressive  symptoms,  and  NSSI.  Second, 
reliance on self-reported data introduces potential biases, such as recall and social desirability biases. Third, the 
inclusion criteria were limited to the Chinese Han population, as the Han ethnicity constitutes the majority of 
China’s population; this may affect the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups. Fourth, although 
the  model  fit  indices  indicated  good  fit,  differences  between  RMSEA  and  SRMR  suggest  limited  robustness. 
Thus, the results should be interpreted cautiously. Additionally, the study also did not explore other potential 
mediators, such as impulsivity or family dynamics, which could further explain the CM-NSSI link. Fifth, due to 
sample size constraints, we used total scores for key constructs (e.g., DIF, CESD and DSHI) rather than latent 
variable modeling, which may inflate measurement error. Finally, the absence of biological measures and limited 
consideration of comorbidities like anxiety or PTSD constrain a more comprehensive understanding of these 
relationships.

Conclusion
In  conclusion,  this  study  found  that  adolescents  with  depressive  disorders  exhibited  significantly  higher 
prevalence rates of NSSI, alexithymia, and CM compared to the control group. CM was significantly associated 
with NSSI and played a direct mediating role. The structural equation model confirmed our previous hypothesis: 
alexithymia (difficulty identifying feelings) and self-injury functions partially mediated the relationship between 
CM and NSSI. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of NSSI. Prevention 
and treatment efforts for NSSI should target key symptom nodes, specifically difficulty identifying feelings and 
the three factors of self-injury functions (attention seeking, emotional regulation, and social avoidance). Future 
studies  should  further  explore  the  stability  of  these  pathways  across  different  cultural  contexts  and  clinical 
populations.
