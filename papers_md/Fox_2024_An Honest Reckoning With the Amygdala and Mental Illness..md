Abstract

Anxiety disorders are a leading source of human misery, morbidity, and premature mortality. 
Existing treatments are far from curative for many, underscoring the need to clarify the underlying 
neural mechanisms. Although many brain regions contribute, the amygdala has received the 
most lavish scientific attention. Over the past several decades, this intense scrutiny has yielded 
a detailed understanding of amygdala function, but it has failed to produce new clinical assays, 
biomarkers, or cures. Rising to this urgent public-health challenge demands an honest reckoning 
with the functional-neuroanatomical complexity of the amygdala and a shift from theories 
anchored on “The Amygdala” to models centered on specific amygdala nuclei and cell types. 
We begin by examining evidence from studies of rodents, monkeys, and humans for the Canonical 
Model, the idea that the amygdala plays a central role in fear- and anxiety-related states, traits, 
and disorders. Next, we selectively highlight work indicating that the Canonical Model, while 
true, is overly simplistic and fails to adequately capture the actual state of the evidentiary 
record, the breadth of amygdala-associated functions and illnesses, or the complexity of the 
amygdala’s functional architecture. We describe the implications of these facts for basic and 
clinical neuroimaging research. We conclude with some general recommendations for grappling 
with the complexity of the amygdala and accelerating efforts to understand and more effectively 
treat amygdala-related psychopathology.

INTRODUCTION

Fear and anxiety are evolutionarily conserved features of mammalian life that help protect us 
from harm (1, for a fuller definition, see 2). But when expressed too strongly or pervasively, 
they can be crippling, even fatal (3–5). Anxiety disorders impose a staggering burden 
on global health, afflicting ~360 million individuals annually (6). In the U.S., ~1 in 3 
individuals will experience a lifetime disorder, service utilization is surging, and direct 
healthcare costs exceed $40B annually, drawing the attention of clinicians, scientists, the 
media, and policymakers (7–13). Existing treatments were developed decades ago and have 
limited effectiveness, durability, and tolerability, underscoring the need to clarify the neural 
systems that govern the expression of fear and anxiety (14–17). Although many brain 
regions contribute, the amygdala—an almond-shaped collection of nuclei buried beneath 
the temporal lobe—has received the lion’s share of scientific attention (Figure 1). Over 
the past two decades, this lavish attention has yielded a much more detailed understanding 
of amygdala function, but it has failed to produce new clinical assays, biomarkers, or 
cures. Rising to this urgent challenge demands an honest reckoning with the functional-
neuroanatomical complexity of the amygdala and a shift from conceptual models centered 
on “The Amygdala” to models centered on specific nuclei and cell types. We begin by 
examining evidence for the Canonical Model, the idea that the amygdala plays a crucial role 
in all manner of fear- and anxiety-related states, traits, and disorders. Next, we highlight 
work indicating that the Canonical Model, while true, is overly simplistic and fails to 
adequately capture the nuance of a burgeoning empirical literature, the breadth of amygdala-
associated functions and disorders, or the complexity of amygdala architecture revealed by 
animal models (for detailed reviews, see 18, 19–21). We then describe the implications 
of this complexity for the design and interpretation of basic and clinical neuroimaging

research and for understanding and developing better treatments for psychiatric illness. 
We have come to believe that shifts are required in how neuroimagers approach the 
study of fear and anxiety. Nevertheless, we emphasize here and reiterate later that we are 
not fundamentally pessimistic about the human neuroimaging enterprise—such work is a 
necessary complement to animal models and there are valuable clues to be gleaned from 
the close study of the human brain in sickness and in health (1, 22, 23). We conclude by 
outlining some general recommendations for more effectively grappling with the complexity 
of the amygdala and accelerating efforts to understand and more effectively treat amygdala-
related psychopathology.

Section 1.  The Canonical Model of “The Amygdala”

In the minds of many scientists and even the public, the amygdala is synonymous with fear 
and anxiety (24–27). Indeed, converging lines of evidence indicate that that the amygdala: 
(a) is anatomically poised to trigger fear and anxiety; (b) is sensitive to a wide variety 
of noxious and potentially threat-relevant stimuli and variation in amygdala function is 
associated with dispositional risk for anxiety disorders, depression, and related internalizing 
illnesses (28); (c) exerts bi-directional control over signs and symptoms of fear and anxiety; 
and (d) contributes to the development, maintenance, and treatment of internalizing illness.

The amygdala is anatomically poised to orchestrate states of fear and anxiety
—The amygdala lies at the center of a web of brain regions and it is uniquely well-
positioned to use information from sensory, contextual, and regulatory regions to guide 
the assembly of emotional responses via dense projections to the downstream regions 
that directly mediate the behavioral (e.g., passive and active avoidance), physiological 
(e.g., cardiovascular and neuroendocrine activity, startle), and cognitive (e.g., vigilance, 
associative learning, long-term memory) features of fear and anxiety (29–31).

Amygdala function is sensitive to threat and co-varies with dispositional 
risk for internalizing illness—Studies of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) afford 
an opportunity to obtain concurrent measures of naturalistic defensive behaviors, 
neuroendocrine activity, and brain metabolism in response to a range of ethologically 
relevant threats, including explicit cues of potential danger (i.e., an unfamiliar human 
intruder’s profile) and more diffuse contexts (i.e., a novel testing cage)—something that 
would be challenging to accomplish in humans. Using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron 
emission tomography (FDG-PET) in samples encompassing as many as 592 individuals, 
Kalin, Fox, and colleagues have demonstrated that amygdala activity (glucose metabolism) 
co-varies with heightened behavioral inhibition or freezing behavior and neuroendocrine 
responses to such threats (32–37). Amygdala metabolism is moderately stable over time and 
context and, as such, represents a trait-like feature of brain function (36). Fox and colleagues 
showed that amygdala metabolism during exposure to an unfamiliar human intruder’s profile 
showed an intra-class correlation ICC=0.64 over 1.1 years, similar to the concurrent stability 
of defensive responses to threat in young monkeys (ICC=0.72; 34, 38, 39) and the 5-year 
stability of neuroticism/negative emotionality (N/NE), a prominent dispositional risk factor 
for internalizing illnesses, in humans (partial R=0.60; N=56,735; 31, 40).

Like the anxiety disorders, anxious temperament or ‘trait anxiety’ reflects a mixture of 
nature and nurture in humans and nonhuman primates (33, 41, 42). Work in monkeys 
demonstrates that the neural circuitry underlying trait-like variation in anxiety can be 
similarly fractionated. Although heritable, amygdala metabolism appears to be more closely 
related to the variation in anxious temperament that is explained by differences in early-life 
experience (h2=0.26, rG=n.s., N=592) (33). In contrast, functional connectivity between the 
amygdala and neighboring bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) appears to be more 
relevant to understanding the heritable variation in anxious temperament and, hence, to the 
intergenerational transmission of internalizing risk from parents to their offspring (h2=0.45, 
rG =0.87, N=378) (43).

Among humans, the amygdala is recruited by a broad spectrum of noxious and potentially 
threat-relevant stimuli, both learned and unlearned, including aversive scenes and odors; 
Pavlovian-threat cues (CS+); uncertain- and certain-threat anticipation; horror movies; an 
approaching tarantula; photographs of angry, fearful, and untrustworthy faces; and pain 
(22, 44–53, 54, Study 1, 55–58). Increased amygdala activation is, in turn, associated 
with elevated levels of threat-elicited distress and psychophysiological arousal (22). More 
recent work has leveraged machine-learning approaches to show that the amygdala is also 
a key element in whole-brain multivoxel patterns or ”signatures” that predict the intensity 
of negative affect triggered by noxious stimuli (i.e., in individuals not used for signature 
training; 59) and that distinguish Pavlovian threat (CS+) from safety (CS−) (52, 60, 61).

Like monkeys, human adults and youth with a more anxious, neurotic, or shy disposition 
are prone to more intense or persistent activation in the amygdala. This has been 
observed both at “rest,” in the absence of an explicit task, and in response to novelty, 
task-irrelevant negative emotional faces, aversive images, and Pavlovian threats (41, 53, 
62–65). For example, Kaczkurkin and colleagues used a large peri-adolescent youth dataset 
(N=875) to show that, on average, adolescent females are marked by a more anxious 
temperament than adolescent males and that this difference statistically reflects elevated 
resting perfusion in the amygdala (sex → resting amygdala activity → disposition) (66). 
Amygdala-temperament associations appear to be more pronounced following acute stress 
inductions (67) and amplified among individuals with lower social support (68), another risk 
factor for internalizing illness (31).

The amygdala exerts bi-directional control over fear- and anxiety-related 
states and traits—Lesion and other loss-of-function experiments (e.g., optogenetic 
inhibition) in rodents demonstrate that the amygdala is mechanistically critical for 
orchestrating defensive responses to a variety of threats, learned and unlearned, certain 
and uncertain (19, 22, 69–74). The amygdala is also critical for mounting species-typical 
avoidance and escape responses to naturalistic threats, such as a robotic virtual predator (75).

Other work in mice suggests a role for the amygdala in anxious temperament and related 
emotional traits. For example, Ahrens and colleagues showed that anxious, behaviorally 
inhibited mice are characterized by tonically elevated amygdala activity (76), consistent 
with FDG-PET and perfusion fMRI studies in humans and monkeys (36, 66, 77, 78). In an 
elegant series of experiments, Ahrens and colleagues demonstrated that amygdala activity is

sensitive to uncertain danger (unpredictable shock) and is both necessary and sufficient for 
heightened defensive responses to novelty and diffuse threat (open field).

While our understanding of the primate amygdala lags behind that of rodents, work in 
monkeys and humans suggests that it is mechanistically crucial for mounting defensive 
responses to threat. In monkeys, fiber-sparing (excitotoxic) lesions of the amygdala attenuate 
defensive behaviors and endocrine responses to both conditioned and innate threats, 
including unfamiliar conspecifics (79–82).

These observations dovetail with work in humans. Patient SM, for example, is marked 
by near-complete bilateral destruction of the amygdala and shows a profound lack of fear 
and anxiety—whether measured objectively or subjectively—to both diffusely threatening 
contexts (e.g., traversing a haunted house, where the timing and nature of threat encounters 
is uncertain) and acute threats, including spiders, snakes, horror films, Pavlovian-threat 
cues, ‘jump-scares’ in the haunted house, and even real-world assault (83). Notably, SM 
also shows profoundly low levels of dispositional fear and anxiety—whether indexed by 
self-report, family report, clinician report, or daily diary (83–85).

Other work has examined the consequences of amplifying amygdala activity. Work in 
monkeys shows that manipulations that increase amygdala metabolism can potentiate 
freezing and other signs of threat-evoked anxiety (80), consistent with rodent studies (76). 
Likewise, electrical stimulation of the human amygdala has been shown to elicit conscious 
feelings of fear and anxiety, accompanied by tachycardia and surges in electrodermal 
activity (86). Inman and colleagues described an individual (‘subject 8’) who experienced 
intense fear and anxiety in response to 6V stimulation in the right amygdala: “It was, um, it 
was terrifying, it was just…it was like I was about to get attacked by a dog…like someone 
unleashes a dog on you, and it’s just like it’s so close, and you feel like you’re going 
to s*** your pants. It’s terrifying.” At 8V, he asked to terminate the stimulation, saying 
“that was so scary it was nauseating. It’s like, um, I went zip-lining a few weeks ago…and 
this was worse” (86)1. Such feelings were dose-dependent, absent during intermixed sham 
trials, reproducible across sessions, and broadly consistent with earlier work (87–89). Taken 
with the loss-of-function data, this suggests that circuits centered on the amygdala exert 
bi-directional control over many of the core signs and symptoms of fear- and anxiety-related 
states and traits.

Amygdala hyper-reactivity is associated with internalizing illness and 
normalized by treatment—Several lines of evidence indicate that the amygdala plays 
a prominent role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and depression.

provide consistent evidence of amygdala hyper-reactivity in individuals with 
major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or anxiety disorders (92–94). In the 
most nuanced CBMA, McTeague and colleagues observed significant amygdala 
hyper-reactivity to “emotional” tasks among individuals with interview-verified 
anxiety or depression diagnoses (93). Ancillary analyses suggested that these 
effects were largely driven by studies of negative faces and scenes. Amygdala 
hyper-reactivity was also evident in a comprehensive recent CBMA focused on 
anxiety disorders and emotional tasks (95).

…is amplified by exposure to the same kinds of stressors and psychological 
pathogens (e.g., combat, childhood maltreatment) that can precipitate acute 
illness in at-risk individuals (90, 96–98). For example, a recent CBMA 
encompassing more than 3,000 participants indicated that adversity exposure 
is associated with exaggerated reactivity of the amygdala to emotional tasks (99).

…prospectively predicts heightened internalizing symptoms among adolescents 
and emerging adults exposed to stress, trauma, or negative life events (NLEs) 
(100–102). For example, McLaughlin and colleagues showed that adolescents 
marked by a more reactive amygdala at baseline experienced heightened 
posttraumatic symptoms 9 months later, following exposure to the terrorist attack 
at the 2013 Boston Marathon (103). Among young children, amygdala activation 
has been shown to prospectively predict the worsening of internalizing symptoms 
(62).

…is attenuated by clinically effective pharmacological (e.g., benzodiazepine, 
SSRI) treatments for anxiety and depression (90, 104–107), consistent with work 
in rodents (108, 109). Amygdala reactivity is dampened by moderate doses 
of ethanol (110), a well-established anxiolytic that, like the benzodiazepines, 
enhances inhibitory neurotransmission in the amygdala (111–113). The 
discontinuation of antidepressant treatment often triggers relapse and new work 
suggests that individuals who show a “rebound” in amygdala reactivity at the 
time of discontinuation are more likely to relapse (114).

…is attenuated by cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) in anxiety patients (107, 
115, 116) and by cognitive reappraisal (a core element of CBT) in psychiatrically 
healthy individuals (117).

Collectively, these observations suggest that heightened amygdala function contributes to 
the development and maintenance of pathological fear, anxiety, and depression. Despite 
this progress, it has become increasingly clear that things are not so simple. To develop a 
more complete and useful understanding of amygdala function, we need to reckon with its 
anatomy.

Section 2.  A Neuroanatomical Perspective on “The Amygdala”

The amygdala was discovered and named by Burdach in the early 19th century, decades 
before Nissl, Golgi, and Cajal developed the stains needed to resolve cellular details 
and 150 years before the advent of the chemical tracers needed to resolve long-range 
connectivity (118). As these tools became available, neuroanatomists recognized that “The

Amygdala” is an anatomical concept that lumps together at least 12 different nuclei, each 
containing millions of functionally and structurally distinct cells (20, 118, 119). Differences 
in the contribution of these assorted nuclei to fear, anxiety, and other behaviors reflect 
differences in cellular composition and connectivity (118). The overall composition of 
amygdala nuclei ranges from “striatal-like,” in the case of the central (Ce) and medial 
(Me) nuclei, to “cortical-like,” in the case of the basal (Ba) and lateral (La) nuclei 
(often grouped together as “BLA”). Although both regions contain mixtures of inhibitory 
(GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons, the Ce and Me primarily contain 
inhibitory neurons that project to subcortical and brainstem nuclei, whereas the La and Ba 
primarily contain excitatory neurons with robust bidirectional connections to cortex. Recent 
work in humans and monkeys indicates that Ce neurons, whether inhibitory or excitatory, 
show different profiles of gene expression when compared to their La counterparts, as 
indexed by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (120). In fact, the Ce is more similar to 
the extra-amygdalar BST—in terms of gene expression, cytoarchitecture, neurochemistry, 
connectivity, embryonic development, and many aspects of function—than it is to the La 
(21, 22, 48, 121, 122). Based on neuroanatomical similarities, Alheid and Heimer proposed 
an alternative anatomical concept—the “extended amygdala” (EA)—that encompasses a 
mixture of amygdalar and extra-amygdalar regions, including the Ce, Me, BST, portions 
of the of the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA; an archipelago of cell islands 
lying between the substantia innominata and lenticular nucleus), and parts of the nucleus 
accumbens (NAC) shell that neighbor the BST (20, 121). In short, even a cursory inspection 
of these kinds of anatomical data makes it clear that “The Amygdala” is neither a natural 
kind nor a singular unit—that it both combines disparate regions (Ce/Me vs. BLA) and 
omits similar ones (e.g., BST)—suggesting that the Canonical Model is too simplistic.

Section 3.  New Human Data and Shortcomings of the Canonical Model

From a human-neuroimaging perspective, the Canonical Model—which implies that the 
amygdala is the neural center for fear and anxiety—suffers from two notable shortcomings. 
First, associations with fear- and anxiety-related constructs, while statistically significant, 
are often weaker and less generalizable than often assumed. Second, the Canonical 
Model fails to adequately capture the breadth of functions and disorders supported by 
the amygdala, suggesting that that amygdala’s contribution to fear and anxiety may be 
more nuanced and complex than the model implies. To be clear, these limitations do not 
fundamentally undermine the Canonical Model, but they do raise conceptual and practical 
concerns, and they underscore the need to adopt approaches that more fully embrace the 
functional and anatomical complexity of this region.

Associations with fear and anxiety are often modest and inconsistent

Basic neuroscience research.: Much of the groundbreaking work to understand the 
function of the rodent amygdala focused on its role in Pavlovian conditioning (123). Guided 
by this work, the first wave of human fMRI studies reported heightened amygdala activation 
to Pavlovian-threat cues (CS+ > CS−), suggesting an evolutionarily conserved functional-
neuroanatomical system (124, 125). But replicating these observations—which were based 
on a grand total of 19 participants—has proved challenging, with many groups reporting 
null effects (54, Study 2, 126, 127) or even amygdala de-activation (CS+ < CS−; 127, 128).

Similar inconsistencies are evident in the instructed threat-of-shock literature (44, 95, 129, 
130). While the mechanistic status of the human amygdala in Pavlovian threat conditioning 
was never in any real doubt (131), for much of the past decade, it was unclear whether 
this association could be reliably detected in human fMRI studies. While differences in 
methodology and sample composition certainly contribute (132, 133), a more substantive 
answer to this question only recently emerged. Leveraging a well-powered sample (n=601) 
and region-of-interest (ROI) approach, Wen and colleagues showed that many of these 
inconsistencies reflect a mixture of weak statistical effects, rapid habituation, and the field’s 
tendency to aggregate heterogeneous amygdala nuclei (51). They showed that statistically 
significant, but numerically negligible amygdala activation is evident using a conventional 
analytic approach, which entails aggregating across all acquisition trials and nuclei (Cohen’s 
d=0.12). Effects were stronger in the first four trials of the acquisition phase (Cohen’s 
d=0.51), particularly the first trial (before the association is learned), but even here the 
authors’ power analyses indicated that ~80 participants are required to consistently detect 
differential amygdala reactivity at a liberal threshold (CS+ > CS−; 75% power; α=0.01, 
uncorrected). Trial-by-trial analyses revealed significant de-activation within ~10 trials, and 
this effect was especially pronounced in BLA. During the extinction phase, heightened 
amygdala activation was only evident for the first 1–2 trials. These findings, which dovetail 
with rodent electrophysiological work, strengthen claims of conserved amygdala function 
and reinforce the importance of going beyond “The Amygdala” to examine individual nuclei 
or circumscribed sets of nuclei (e.g., BLA) They also highlight the value of examining more 
fine-grained temporal dynamics. Yet the need to focus on such a limited number of trials 
raises serious concerns about psychometric reliability and casts doubt on the utility of this 
approach for psychiatric neuroimaging association studies (134–136).

Individuals with an anxious, shy, or neurotic disposition are more likely to develop 
internalizing disorders and, if they do, they may experience a more severe and treatment-
resistant course (31). Although early human fMRI studies indicated that these risk-
conferring dispositional phenotypes are associated with exaggerated amygdala reactivity 
to emotional faces (137–139), four recent large-sample studies (n=213–1,256) failed to 
replicate these associations (44, 140–142). This suggests that relations between dispositional 
risk and amygdala reactivity to emotional faces are either negligible or, as with the 
Pavlovian literature, require specialized approaches to detect (143, 144). There are hints that 
amygdala-disposition associations are stronger for faces that are task-irrelevant, unattended, 
or presented outside of conscious awareness (64, 137, 145). Whether this is generally true 
and whether these associations are sufficiently consistent and strong to warrant further 
investment is unclear. Weak and inconsistent associations are not limited to emotional-face 
paradigms. Early work suggested that individuals with an anxious or neurotic disposition 
show heightened amygdala reactivity during periods of threat anticipation, as with Pavlovian 
threat conditioning and instructed threat-of-shock paradigms (146). With one exception (53), 
subsequent studies—many featuring relatively large samples (n=50–220)—have reported 
null effects (reviewed in Ref. 44).

Mechanistic work has also revealed effects that are inconsistent with a simplistic version of 
the Canonical Model. Amygdala lesions do not completely abolish threat-elicited freezing, 
and not all manipulations that increase amygdala activity increase anxious or fearful

behaviors (81). For example, in monkeys, overexpression of neurotrophin-3 (NTF3) in 
the dorsal amygdala increases Ce metabolism, but decreases anxious temperament (147). 
Although microstimulation of the human amygdala can produce signs and symptoms of fear 
and anxiety, and these are the most commonly evoked emotions, feelings are infrequently 
evoked and by no means confined to fear; in fact, feelings of sadness, guilt, joy, and 
happiness have been reported (86–89). This heterogeneity likely, in part, reflects variability 
in the intensity and nuclear location of stimulation (86).

Conversely, loss-of-function research indicates that the human amygdala is not necessary for 
experiencing all forms of fear and anxiety. In a seminal study, Patient SM and two other 
patients with bilateral amygdala lesions experienced frank panic attacks; reported intense 
feelings of fear, anxiety, and panic; and showed elevated signs of arousal in response to 
CO2-inhalation, a well-validated interoceptive threat (148). Taken with the data reviewed in 
Section I (e.g., 83), these observations suggest that although the amygdala can be critical for 
organizing fear and anxiety in response to many external threats (but perhaps not all; e.g., 
as with Pavlovian ‘overtraining’), it is not necessary for triggering emotional response to 
CO2-triggered air hunger, an endogenous threat.

Clinical neuroimaging research.: Overlapping concerns apply to the clinical-neuroimaging 
literature.

To ensure an adequate number of studies, CBMAs of the clinical-neuroimaging 
literature have been compelled to “lump” across diagnoses, ages, and tasks, 
precluding inferences about diagnostic or symptom specificity (92–94). Among 
individuals with anxiety disorders, a recent CBMA demonstrated amygdala 
hyper-reactivity to emotion perception and generation tasks (95). While this was 
true when collapsing across diagnoses, in disaggregated analyses it was only 
evident for specific phobia and social anxiety disorder. Whether this reflects 
genuine diagnostic differences or an artifact of differences in statistical power 
and fMRI assays is unknown (149).

Early research suggested that amygdala activation is associated with the 
severity of internalizing symptoms (150, 151). Yet more recent studies with 
substantially better power (n=229–28,638) indicate that amygdala reactivity to 
negative emotional faces and Pavlovian-threat cues is unrelated to concurrent 
anhedonia, depression, fear, or general distress symptoms (128, 152), consistent 
with null effects for dimensional measure of anxious temperament and N/NE 
(44). Whether this reflects a genuinely null effect, an artifact of aggregating 
amygdala nuclei, or suboptimal fMRI assays is unclear. In several well-powered 
studies (n=592–875), significant associations with basal measures of activity in 
the dorsal amygdala have been consistently observed (33, 66). Although this 
provides an empirical rationale for prioritizing the Ce and neighboring nuclei 
for mechanistic follow-on projects, the magnitude of these associations is too 
modest for clinical application or therapeutics development.

In a groundbreaking study (n=340), Swartz, Hariri, and colleagues showed that 
heightened amygdala reactivity to fearful and angry faces predicts the worsening

of anxiety and anhedonia symptoms in young adults exposed to negative life 
events (NLEs) (100). While scientifically useful, here again, the magnitude 
of this prospective association (d=0.33, r2=0.027) is too weak to be useful 
for screening, diagnosis, or other clinical applications centered on individuals 
(for online visualization tools, see 153, 154). More generally, null effects 
are not uncommon in prospective studies. For example, Peng and colleagues 
recently reported that amygdala reactivity to Pavlovian-threat cues is unrelated to 
the longitudinal course of internalizing symptoms across a 2.5-year follow-up 
(n=279; 155). Whether this reflects the use of a whole-amygdala ROI and 
conventional analyses of the Pavlovian paradigm (see above) or a failure to 
measure and model NLE exposure is unknown.

4.

Early studies suggested that amygdala reactivity is dampened by cognitive 
reappraisal in healthy individuals and by CBT in internalizing patients (115–
117). Yet Bo and colleagues recently failed to detect significant amygdala down-
regulation in a well-powered (n=358) reappraisal study, even when examining 
specific amygdala nuclei. This is consistent with null effects in recent CBMAs of 
the CBT neuroimaging literature (55, 156, 157).

Is the amygdala a key player in fear- and anxiety-related states, traits, and disorders? 
Undoubtedly. Is there any value to clinical-neuroscience research? Yes, work conducted 
over the past two decades has yielded steady advances in our understanding of what the 
human amygdala does and does not contribute to the expression and experience of fear and 
anxiety in rodents, monkeys, and humans. Nevertheless, the data reviewed in this section 
provide a sober reminder that most of the work remains undone, and they raise concerns 
that neuroimagers have relied too heavily on underpowered samples; a limited number of 
sub-optimal workhorse tasks (e.g., emotional faces); and analytic approaches that disregard 
intra-amygdala heterogeneity, weakening associations with psychiatric phenotypes (1, 91). 
The degree to which modest brain-behavior associations reflect cellular heterogeneity within 
amygdala nuclei remains unclear, a point we return to later.

The human amygdala is not specific to fear and anxiety—The amygdala’s robust 
contributions to fear and anxiety often overshadow its role in other behavioral functions 
and psychiatric illnesses. The field has long recognized that the amygdala contributes to a 
variety of non-threat functions (27, 158–160) and human neuroimaging studies show that 
the amygdala is robustly engaged by a variety of positive stimuli, including erotica, food 
and drug cues, music, pleasant odors, happy faces, and humorous stimuli (56, 161–170). 
The amygdala also appears to play a key role in directing eye gaze to the parts of the face 
most diagnostic of others’ intentions and inner states (31, 171). Likewise, detailed studies 
of Patient SM and other individuals with circumscribed damage indicate that the amygdala 
plays a critical role in aspects of social perception and decision-making, theory-of-mind, 
the emotional modulation of declarative memory, and loss aversion for rewards (172, 173). 
Convergent evidence comes from work in monkeys, where fiber-sparing lesions of the 
amygdala disrupt normative preferences for viewing conspecific faces (174) and leads to 
aberrant visual inspection of faces (175).

From a clinical perspective, the amygdala is now known to contribute to a wide variety 
of neuropsychiatric disorders—not just internalizing illnesses. Among these, temporal lobe 
epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are perhaps the most familiar (88, 176). Youth 
with ASD show aberrant trajectories of neuroanatomical maturation in the amygdala (177, 
178) and alterations in gaze-dependent amygdala reactivity to faces (171, 179, 180). Other 
work suggests a role in psychosis spectrum disorders. A recent CBMA demonstrated that 
individuals with schizophrenia show exaggerated amygdala reactivity to emotionally neutral 
stimuli (181), while those with heighted paranoia show elevated amygdala perfusion (182, 
183). Other work suggests that the amygdala plays an important, though often overlooked 
role in substance use disorders and obesity (e.g., 184). For example, feelings of hunger 
have been shown to amplify amygdala reactivity to food cues in unselected samples, and 
to amplify reactivity to drug cues in users (185–187). Furthermore, heightened amygdala 
reactivity to drug cues is attenuated by successful attempts to cognitively downregulate 
craving intensity, consistent with a causal role (188). More recently, the amygdala has 
been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s 
and Parkinson’s (189–191). While many of these associations are modest in size, they 
underscore the amygdala’s relevance to a broad range of illnesses.

Taken together, these observations make it clear that the amygdala is not a fear and anxiety 
center; it is a key contributor to a panoply of practically and psychiatrically important 
behaviors, symptoms, and illnesses. Recent work in rodents has provided some valuable 
clues about the cellular mechanisms that underlie this functional diversity.

Section 4.  New insights from rodent models of the amygdala

Seminal work in rats and rabbits by LeDoux, Kapp, Davis, and others led to a detailed 
understanding of the amygdala’s role in Pavlovian-threat learning and set the stage for the 
Canonical Model as we currently know it (123, 158, 192). Early theories emphasized the 
serial flow of information from La, the sensory gateway to the amygdala, to Ce, the major 
output station of the amygdala (123, 192). Pavlovian associative memories are formed in 
La, where information about a tone or some other benign conditioned stimulus (CS+), and 
a shock unconditioned stimulus (US), converge. With sufficient pairings, this convergence 
induces synaptic strengthening in La, enabling the formerly neutral CS to trigger preparatory 
defensive responses via projections to Ce, which serves as a relay to downstream effector 
regions (Figure 2a). Although the serial model was an important milestone in the scientific 
study of the amygdala, it has become increasingly clear that it, too, is incomplete. Building 
on new data, theorists have summarized this updated understanding with different sorts of 
simplified schematics, each incorporating features that were unknown or overlooked by the 
serial model. First, La learning depends on indirect feedback from Ce, contraindicating 
the serial-relay view (Figure 2b) (193, 194). Second, the intercalated cells (ITCs)—small 
clusters of cells nestled along the border of Ce and Ba/La—and other amygdala nuclei 
participate in Pavlovian-threat learning (Figure 2c) (195, 196). Direct projections from La 
to Ce are relatively modest and much of the communication happens via intermediate 
nuclei, including the ITCs and Ba. ITCs relay information from La to Ce, and are 
modulated by input from frontal regions during acquisition and extinction (prelimbic and 
infralimbic cortex, respectively) (195). Third, other amygdala nuclei can, in coordination

with frontal regions, influence defensive responding. For example, BM activity can decrease 
freezing elicited by both learned (Pavlovian threat) and unlearned (open-field) triggers (197). 
Likewise, Me can initiate freezing and other defensive responses to a variety of naturalistic 
threats (198). Fourth, like the overarching Canonical Model, the serial-relay model of 
Pavlovian-threat conditioning makes no attempt to incorporate the role of amygdala nuclei 
(including La, Ba, and Ce) in non-threat functions, including reward (199–201), social 
behavior (202, 203), olfaction (204), aggression (205), and others (159, 206, 207).

The fact that the La, Ba, Ce, and other amygdala nuclei each contribute a range of functions
—both threat and non-threat—highlights the need to grapple with the anatomical complexity 
lying within these nuclei. Within each nucleus, cells can be grouped into functionally 
distinct populations based on their patterns of gene expression and/or connectivity. 
Studies in rodents have leveraged projection and cell-type-specific opto- and chemogenetic 
manipulations to identify microcircuits that contribute to a rich variety of threat-related and 
non-threat behaviors (19, 207–211). In some cases, this work has revealed intermingled 
cellular populations with distinct, even opposing, consequences on behavior (22). Here, we 
selectively highlight a few illustrative examples of these new insights. Studies of mouse 
BLA mice have revealed overlapping groups of Ce- and NAC-projecting neurons that are 
required for threat and reward learning, respectively (212–215). Other work demonstrates 
that stimulation of different groups of intermingled Ce neurons can trigger a panoply of 
defensive and non-defensive responses, including prey pursuit and capture (216), eating 
(217, 218), taste preferences (219), and pain (220).

From a neuroimaging perspective, these observations raise questions about whether and 
how we can discern intranuclear differences in cellular function. After all, the engagement 
of different cellular populations is not necessarily associated with differences in bulk 
activation, as indexed by fMRI. In the BLA, for example, one can imagine that the 
recruitment of threat- and reward-sensitive cells leads to similar overall levels of activity 
(see the Supplementary Note). Importantly, the complexities of microcircuit architecture can 
further complicate relations with bulk activation. In the Ce, for instance, the same threat can 
recruit distinct groups of somatostatin (SST+) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH+) 
cells to trigger freezing or escape, respectively (221). Critically, SST+, CRH+, and protein 
kinase Cδ (PKCδ+) cells are mutually inhibitory; that is, increasing the activity of one 
attenuates the others (Figure 2d) (19, 208, 210, 211). In short, different behaviors and tasks, 
each mediated by distinct Ce cellular populations, could result in identical changes in bulk 
activation.

Interim conclusions—The amygdala encompasses more than a dozen nuclei, each 
containing intermingled populations of cell types. Over the past decade, work in mice 
has revealed that these cells contribute to a broad array of threat- and non-threat functions 
and behaviors. These are often mediated by dynamic interactions between cell types within 
microcircuits that are situated within and across amygdala nuclei (and other regions of the 
brain). With this new knowledge in hand, the modest and inconsistent associations between 
neuroimaging measures of “The Amygdala” and psychiatrically relevant phenotypes in 
humans are hardly surprising. The Canonical Model of “The Amygdala” is insufficient and 
studying “The Amygdala” is nearly always the wrong level of analysis. The challenge for

complexity.

Section 5. 
accelerating clinical research

Implications of amygdala cellular heterogeneity and opportunities for 

A central goal of psychiatry and clinical psychology is to prevent or cure psychiatric illness. 
Yet billions of dollars of research have largely failed to uncover new assays, biomarkers, 
or treatments. Research focused on “The Amygdala” cannot to rise to this challenge. Based 
on what we now know about amygdala cells and microcircuits, the mapping between 
brain and psychiatric phenotypes likely reflects a mixture of “many-to-one” and “one-to-
many” associations (222). Many-to-one because perturbations of multiple cell types can 
produce similar behavioral disturbances. For instance, alterations to Ce-projecting BLA 
neurons, ITCs, or SST+ Ce neurons can all influence Pavlovian-threat conditioning. One-
to-many because perturbations to different cell-types within a single nucleus can have 
dramatically different behavioral consequences (e.g., SST+ vs. CRH+ neurons in Ce) (221), 
and perturbations of the same cell-type could impact different outcomes depending on the 
larger circuit in which they are embedded (e.g., CRH+ cells are involved in both escaping 
threat and approaching reward) (221, 223). To the extent that different amygdala-implicated 
disorders (see Section 3) are marked by different signs and symptoms, this likely reflects 
distinct cellular substrates. Conversely, to the extent that different patients with a particular 
amygdala-implicated disorder or different disorders share overlapping symptoms, this may 
reflect shared cellular substrates. The same implications apply to the development of new 
therapeutics.

Recent insights into the cellular complexity of the amygdala also have implications for 
the interpretation of gene-association studies. Like other brain regions, cell typing in the 
amygdala is often based on patterns of gene expression. Gene-association studies indicate 
that thousands of genetic variants contribute to amygdala-relevant disorders (224–229). The 
impact of these genes on psychopathology is proximally mediated by their influence on 
neural cells. Genes that are uniquely expressed in specific amygdala cell-types are likely 
to have circumscribed phenotypic consequences, whereas those that are expressed across 
different types of amygdala cells are likely to have a broad impact. While genes that 
are expressed in both amygdala and non-amygdala cells will have the broadest and least 
specific behavioral consequences. These insights can help make sense of evidence that 
many psychiatric disorders are co-heritable and rely on overlapping sets of genes (230, 
231). In short, understanding what cell-types are impacted and how they contribute to 
psychopathology has the potential to guide the development of novel therapeutics, a point 
we develop further below.

Cells are the fundamental building blocks of the brain and are shaped by a combination 
of genetic and experiential processes. Cell-types provide a natural biological platform for 
accelerating our understanding of neuropsychiatric illness and for developing more effective 
treatments with fewer off-target effects. Consider Parkinson’s disease. While it has long 
been recognized that Parkinson’s reflects the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta, it was unclear which cells were most vulnerable and the underlying

molecular processes remained enigmatic. Recent work identified a single class of cell-types 
that are disproportionately affected, which in turn highlighted a set of specific molecular 
processes that appear to mediate heightened genetic risk (232). Other work has begun to 
exploit cell-type information to create precisely targeted gene therapies for disorders of the 
retina and inner ear (233, 234). From a therapeutics perspective, treatments that target a cell-
type for excitation or inhibition are attractive because they can address multiple candidate 
etiologies, all of which ultimately act at the level of the cell. For example, disruption of a 
receptor, the regulation of its expression, or its intracellular signaling could all potentially 
result in the same functional outcome. Even if they do not directly address the underlying 
cause, a cell-type-targeted treatment could effectively address any or all of them by simply 
inhibiting the cell, either tonically or in an activity-dependent manner (235).

To achieve the promise of cell-type treatments for amygdala-related disorders, we must 
first develop a taxonomy of human cell-types and understand the degree to which they are 
conserved across mammalian species. Efforts are ongoing and underscore the complexity 
of the mammalian brain (236–244). Even comparatively “simple” regions, such as primary 
motor cortex, contain more than 50 unique cell-types (236). Although there is no agreed-
upon comprehensive taxonomy for amygdala cell-types, data from multiple groups suggest 
that this heterogeneity goes beyond commonly used chemoarchitectonic (e.g., GABAergic 
vs. glutamatergic), cytoarchitectonic (e.g., projection vs. medium spiny), or expression-
based (e.g., SST+ vs. CRH+) classifications (243–246). Moreover, there is no guarantee that 
the amygdala cells mediating threat-elicited freezing in mice (e.g., SST+) perform the same 
functions, or even exist, in humans (120). Indeed, comparative work has begun to reveal a 
mixture of conserved and, perhaps, human-unique cell-types in the amygdala (120).

Once cell-types are identified, we need to identify the types that are most relevant 
to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. This can be accomplished by fusing cell-type 
taxonomies with data from human gene-association studies. For example, Kamboj, Fox, 
and colleagues leveraged GWAS data to identify La and Ce cell-types that are relatively 
enriched for the genes linked to anxiety disorders and other amygdala-related illnesses 
(120). Focusing on relative enrichment has the advantage of down-weighting cell-types 
that are enriched for non-specific psychopathology-linked genes. This approach revealed 
a group of ITC cells that were enriched for genes associated with neuroticism/negative 
emotionality (N/NE), anxiety disorders, and depression. As described in Section 4, work 
in rodents indicates that ITCs play a key role in processing Pavlovian threat and can 
be modulated by prefrontal biasing signals. Taken together, these observations prioritize 
ITCs as a target for mechanistic follow-up work. Basic research in animals can leverage 
cell-type-specific perturbation and recording tools to clarify their role in local microcircuits 
and their relevance to psychiatrically relevant behavioral phenotypes. While challenging, 
human translational research can assess whether cell-type-specific hypotheses are fruitful 
for understanding the macroscopic function of the human amygdala and other brain regions 
(see the Supplementary Note for additional details and examples). Together, these basic 
and translational studies can be used to prioritize the cell-types that are most likely to be 
involved in psychiatric disorders.

Prioritized cell-types provide a target for therapeutics development. Efforts to develop 
improved tools for targeted interventions is on-going. This includes the development of 
viral vectors that can be delivered across the primate blood-brain-barrier (247–251); the 
identification of enhancers, promotors, and other regulators to restrict expression to specific 
amygdala cell-types (e.g., 252); and innovations in genetically encoded cargo which could 
be used to modulate the activity of these cells at the scale of the human brain (e.g., 
designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, or DREADDs) (253–258). 
Pharmacological treatment strategies can also be targeted at cell-types, by identifying 
receptors that are enriched on the cell-type of interest. For example, Kamboj and colleagues 
showed that anxiety-related ITCs are enriched for neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFFR2), 
and pre-clinical research hints that NPFFR2 treatments may buffer the effects of stress 
(259–262). While systemic pharmacological approaches are more likely to have adverse 
off-target effects than gene therapies, via their impact on other cell types in and outside 
of the amygdala, this provides another potential pathway to developing new treatments for 
maladaptive fear and anxiety.

More broadly, this body of work showcases some ways in which cell-types can be leveraged 
to generate novel hypotheses about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying amygdala-
related and inform the development of new treatments. The utility of this approach is likely 
to increase over time as more data and consensual cellular taxonomies become available for 
the amygdala and other regions.

Conclusions

Amygdala-related disorders impose a staggering burden on public health and existing 
treatments are far from curative for many (GBD 2021 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators, 
2024; SAMHSA, 2023). Addressing this burden will require the development of 
interventions that are more effective, durable, and tolerable. Rising to this challenge requires 
a frank recognition of the strengths and weaknesses of the theoretical canon that has built 
up around “The Amygdala” and an embrace of models centered on nuclei and cell types. 
Translational work in animals can be used to develop hypotheses that can be tested in 
healthy and diseased humans. Although this path will require exceptional creativity and 
effort, it is clear that we must begin to more honestly reckon with the amygdala’s functional-
neuroanatomical complexity, if we are going to understand its role in neuropsychiatric 
disease.

Figure 2. Amygdala Microcircuits.
(a) Influential models developed in the late 20th and early 21st century emphasized the serial 
flow of information from La, the sensory gateway to the amygdala, to Ce, the major output 
station of the amygdala (25). Ce triggers defensive responses via efferent projections to 
subcortical and brainstem effector regions. (b) More recent evidence has produced a new 
generation of schematics. Some emphasize the flow of feedback from Ce to BLA (193, 
194). (c) Some emphasize the ITCs’ role in mediating the flow of information flow from 
La to Ce (195, 196). (d) Others focus on the role of inhibitory Ce microcircuits in selecting 
defensive responses to threat (19, 208, 210, 211). Abbreviations—BL, basolateral nucleus; 
BLA, lateral, basolateral, and basomedial nuclei; Ce, central nucleus; CeL, lateral division 
of Ce; CeM, medial division of Ce; ITC, intercalated cells; La, lateral nucleus.

Figure 3. Identifying and understanding the role of amygdala cell-types in anxiety disorders.
(a) As shown in (120), single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) can be used to identify 
evolutionarily conserved cell-types, along with putative marker genes (TSHZ1 and FOXP2) 
and g-protein coupled receptors (NPFFR2). (b) GWAS data can be leveraged to identify 
cell-types that show relative enrichment of disorder-associated genetic variants. (c) Spatial 
sequencing and in situ hybridization can be used to confirm cellular location. (d) Together, 
these data can be integrated with rodent microcircuit studies to prioritize cell-types for 
mechanistic follow-up studies, including experimental therapeutic research. Abbreviations
—BL, basolateral nucleus; Ce, central nucleus; CeL, lateral division of Ce; CeM, medial 
division of Ce; ITC, intercalated cells; La, lateral nucleus.
