Background

A B S T R A C T

Road  traffic  suicides  are  common.  However,  due  to  the  difficulty  in  distinguishing  between  motor  vehicle  crash  fatalities  and  actual
suicides, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Restricting access to means is an important universal or population-based
approach to suicide prevention with clear evidence of its effectiveness. However, the evidence with respect to means restriction for the
prevention  of  suicide  on  roads  is  not  well  established.  We  conducted  a  systematic  review  to  assess  the  impact  of  restrictions  on  the
availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads.

Search methods

We  searched  the  Cochrane  Library,  MEDLINE,  Embase,  PsycINFO,  and  the  Transport  Research  International  Documentation  (TRID)
Database  from  the  date  of  database  inception  to  March  2020.  We  conducted  searches  of  the  World  Health  Organization  International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. We applied no date, language,
or publication status restrictions to these searches.

Selection criteria

Eligible studies were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, controlled intervention studies without randomisation, before-
after studies, or studies using interrupted time series designs, which evaluated interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to,
means of suicide on roads.

Data collection and analysis

Two  review  authors  screened  abstracts  and  full-text  publications  against  the  inclusion  criteria.  Two  review  authors  planned  to
independently extract data and assess risk of bias of included studies. However, we identified no studies eligible for inclusion.

Main results

We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' conclusions

This systematic review highlights the paucity of research around road traffic suicides and the need for future robust studies that aim to
investigate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads. Suicide ascertainment is a key issue; therefore, clear objective
criteria are necessary in order to scale up and study this method more accurately. In the absence of any substantial evidence, we advocate

for more awareness on road traffic suicides and its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Further research exploring
effective measures, particularly those that do not require driver compliance, are also needed.

Means restriction to prevent suicide on roads

Why is this review important?

Road traffic suicides are difficult to distinguish from motor vehicle crash fatalities and, therefore, no official figures exist for this method
of suicide. Limiting access to lethal methods used for suicide (called means restriction) is an important universal or population strategy
for preventing suicide. While there is evidence that means restriction is an effective approach for preventing suicides, the evidence for
preventing suicide on roads is not well established. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the impact restriction of access would have
on suicide on roads.

Searching for evidence

We searched several medical databases to find studies that assessed the impact of restricting access to means of suicide on roads. We
searched the databases up to March 2020. We also searched international trial registries for unpublished and ongoing studies. Our main
outcomes of interest were suicide and attempted suicide or self-harm.

Key results

We found no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of means
restriction interventions for the prevention of suicide on roads. Determining suicidal intent is a major problem in road crash fatalities,
therefore clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up, study and understand this method of suicide more accurately. Improved
awareness of suicide on roads in suicide prevention activities is needed, as well as, its inclusion in future government suicide prevention
policies. Robust studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads are urgently required

Description of the condition

Suicide rates

Suicide is recognised as a significant global public health problem.
It  is  estimated  that  each  year  around  800,000  people  die  from
suicide; this equates to a global mortality rate of 10.5 per 100,000
population  (WHO  2019).  However,  it  is  suggested  that  global
suicide figures could be under-reported due to misclassification of
suicides as accidents or other causes of death (WHO 2014). Suicide
occurs  throughout  the  lifespan  and  is  the  second-leading  cause
of  death  in  15-  to  29-year  olds  worldwide  behind  unintentional
road injury (WHO 2018). Most deaths by suicide occur in low- and
middle-income  countries  (79%),  however,  high-income  countries
have the highest age-standardised suicide rates (11.5 per 100,000
population)  (WHO  2019).  Self-harm,  which  includes  acts  of  self-
poisoning or self-injury carried out by an individual irrespective of
motivation or suicidal intent (NICE 2011), is much more common
than  suicide  and  a  significant  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality,
including by suicide (Sinclair 2010; WHO 2014). In describing self-
harm, we have followed the approach favoured in the UK and some
other  countries  where  all  purposeful  self-harm  with  or  without
suicidal  intent  (from  non-suicidal  self-injury  to  suicide  attempts)
is  described  and  included  in  a  single  category,  namely  self-harm
(Hawton 2016).

Risk factors/causes

There are a variety of risk factors for suicide. These include mental
disorders (particularly depression, anxiety, and substance abuse);
social,  psychological,  biological,  and  genetic  factors;  exposure  to
suicide  in  others;  and  adverse  life  events  (Hawton  2009;  Turecki
2016).  A  prior  suicide  attempt  is  the  single  most  important  risk
factor  for  suicide  in  the  general  population  (WHO  2014).  Sex
is  also  a  factor,  with  higher  rates  of  suicide  reported  in  males
(13.7  per  100,000  population)  than  in  females  (7.5  per  100,000
population) (WHO 2019). However, unlike suicide, self-harm usually
occurs more commonly in females (Hawton 2008; Geulayov 2016).
Whatever  the  background  factors  at  the  point  when  a  person
feels  hopeless  and  suicidal,  access  to  the  means  of  suicide  can
be  decisive  (Hawton  2007).  Availability  of  means  can  increase
the  likelihood  of  a  suicide  attempt,  particularly  where  impulsive
behaviour  is  a  factor  (Hawton  2007).  The  nature  of  the  method
chosen will influence the outcome (Yip 2012).

Definitions

A  range  of  different  terms  are  used  for  suicide  and  suicidal
behaviour.  In  the  context  of  this  review,  'suicidal  behaviour'
refers  to  any  form  of  intentional  self-injurious  or  self-poisoning
behaviour  with  known  suicidal  intent.  'Suicide'  refers  to  self-
injurious  or  self-poisoning  behaviour  with  a  fatal  outcome  and
known suicidal intent or where that intent was underdetermined.
Self-harm includes acts of self-poisoning or self-injury irrespective
of motivation or suicidal intent.

Means of suicide

Three principal methods of suicide predominate worldwide. These
include  hanging,  use  of  firearms,  and  poisoning  by  ingestion  of
pesticides (WHO 2014). Road traffic suicides are also known to be
quite  common  and  can  be  categorised  as  either  driver  suicides
or pedestrian suicides (Routley 2003). Driver suicides are typically

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

single-vehicle, single-occupant collisions and occur by three main
methods: driving a vehicle off road infrastructure with the intention
of  self-harm;  driving  a  vehicle  into  road  infrastructure  with  the
intention of self-harm, or driving a vehicle into another vehicle with
the  intention  of  self-harm  (Harrison  2017).  Likewise,  pedestrian
suicides occur by: jumping off or on to road infrastructure with the
intention of self-harm (this may be from a moving vehicle); stepping
into the path of a moving vehicle with the intention of self-harm;
or  lying  before  a  moving  vehicle  on  a  road  with  the  intention  of
self-harm (Routley 2003; Harrison 2017).  In our review on means
restriction for the prevention of suicide by jumping (Okolie 2020),
we  addressed  all  mechanisms  of  suicide  by  jumping  –  including
jumping from a height onto roads. We identified three studies from
six articles (Lester 1993; O'Carroll 1994; Beautrais 2001; Beautrais
2009;  Sinyor  2010;  Sinyor  2017)  that  evaluated  interventions  on
bridges  that  spanned  (but  were  not  specific  to)  road  networks.
There  was  little  focus  on  the  road  networks  in  all  three  of  these
studies. We found that the installation of safety barriers on bridges
led to a significant reduction in suicide rates by jumping at these
sites.  Cost-effectiveness  analyses  suggested  that  bridge  barriers
would be highly cost-effective in the long term as a result of reduced
suicide mortality by alternate methods.

Researchers  have  found  it  difficult  to  assess  the  true  extent  of
suicide on the roads. One reason is the difficulty of distinguishing
between  motor  vehicle  crash  fatalities  and  actual  suicides
(Andersson 2015; Harrison 2017). Statistics on reported road traffic
accidents  in  Great  Britain  show  that  there  were  1793  reported
road  deaths  in  2017  –  most  of  whom  were  vehicle  occupants
(Department for Transport 2018). Suicide ascertainment is a major
problem in road crash fatalities and, as a result, no official figures
exist for this method of suicide. Despite this limitation, various local
and  national  estimates  and  studies  of  road  traffic  suicides  have
been undertaken to establish the scale of the problem. A review of
the literature published in 2012 concluded that over 2% of traffic
crashes  are  as  a  result  of  suicidal  behaviours  (Pompili  2012).    In
the  UK,  the  Parliamentary  Advisory  Council  for  Transport  Safety
(PACTS) estimates that at least 50 deaths by suicide per year occur
on UK roads (Harrison 2017). A Scottish study of fatal road traffic
collisions  between  1993  and  2003  reported  that  17  cases  (2.8%
of all road traffic fatalities) appeared to be suicides (Wyatt 2009).
A  similar  study  in  Switzerland  identified  53  cases  of  road  traffic
suicide between 2000 and 2010 (Gauthier 2015). The authors of the
above publications, however, suggested a possible under-reporting
of road traffic suicides due to the tendency of investigators to regard
all road traffic fatalities as unintentional. Despite the lack of clarity
with  regards  to  the  scale  of  road  traffic  suicide,  this  method  of
suicide is unique in the sense that it potentially places others (road
users and pedestrians) at risk of death and injury (Wyatt 2009).

Some studies suggest that pedestrian suicides are not as common
as  driver  suicides  (Gauthier  2015).  Most  road  traffic  suicide
victims  are  males  aged  between  25  and  34  years,  unmarried,
in  regular  employment,  with  a  history  of  attempted  suicide
(Hernetkoski  1998;  Gauthier  2015).  A  history  of  mental  illness,
particularly  depression,  and  alcohol  misuse,  either  proximal  to
the incident or longer term, have also been identified as possible
risk factors associated with road traffic suicides (Hernetkoski 1998;
Routley 2003).

Description of the intervention

The  choice  of  suicide  method  can  be  influenced  by  certain
factors.  For  road  traffic  suicide,  these  include  lethality,  financial
benefits  (insurance  compensation),  and  reduced  stigma  (than
other  methods)  (Routley  2003).  Availability  and  accessibility  of
means increases the likelihood of a suicidal act, particularly where
impulsive behaviour is a factor (Yip 2012). Restriction of availability
or  access  to  lethal  methods  of  suicide  (means  restriction)  is,
therefore, an important universal or population-level approach to
suicide prevention. Universal prevention strategies are targeted at
the general public or entire population groups. These strategies are
designed to influence everyone and typically affect people whose
suicide risk is otherwise undetected (Yip 2012). Means restriction is
underpinned by the concept of intervention being available during
acute periods of risk for suicidal behaviour, for example, as might
occur when a person with depression is exposed to an adverse life
event. If access to means is restricted at this point, the chance of
survival  beyond  the  stage  of  acute  risk  increases.  Evidence  from
research on near lethal suicide attempts supports the idea that, at
least for a proportion of people, these attempts are an impulsive
response  that  would  not  have  occurred  if  the  means  had  not
been readily available (Hawton 2005). Means restriction is therefore
applied  to  the  population  as  a  whole,  where  it  typically  affects
vulnerable individuals, whose suicide risk may be undetected and
who have not sought assistance in the midst of this crisis (Yip 2012).

It has been argued that restricting access to one method of suicide
will lead to substitution with another. There is evidence, however,
that  restricting  access  to  means  during  periods  of  acute  risk  can
have an impact on an individual’s likelihood of dying from suicide in
the longer term (Daigle 2005). Studies of substitution suggest that,
although there may be some shifting of suicidal acts to other sites,
deaths by the same method are still significantly reduced overall
(Pirkis 2013).

How the intervention might work

As a means of suicide, vehicles and road infrastructure are widely
available yet  population-wide restriction of access to vehicles on
the  road  network  is  not  practical.  However,  implementation  of
barriers for high-risk individuals and situations – such as the use
of alcohol ignition interlock devices and driver monitoring systems
–  have been  suggested  as  potential  interventions  (Routley  2003).
Installation  of  physical  barriers  and  fencing  at  high-risk  jumping
sites, especially bridges, has been shown to be effective at reducing
the  number  of  suicides  by  jumping  (Okolie  2020).  Since  barriers
and  fences  provide  a  physical  obstruction  to  prevent  individuals
from  jumping  off  or  onto  structures,  this  approach  may  also  be
relevant  in  the  prevention  of  suicides  on  actual  road  networks  –
particularly pedestrian suicide – by restricting pedestrian access to
road  networks.  These  interventions  may  be  used  in  combination
with  other  suicide  prevention  measures  such  as  interventions
aimed  at  increasing  opportunities  for  help-seeking  (e.g.  crisis
telephone  support  services),  or  those  aimed  at  increasing  the
opportunity  and  capacity  for  human  intervention  (e.g.  closed-
circuit  television  (CCTV)  camera  surveillance).  Some  or  all  these
interventions could operate at multiple levels within the universal,
selective, and indicated hierarchy as described below.

• Universal interventions: targeted at the general public or whole

populations.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Selective interventions: targeted at individuals or groups within

a population at increased risk of suicidal behaviours.

• Indicated  interventions:  targeted  at  individuals  with  known

suicidal behaviours.

Most  means  restriction  interventions  operate  at  the  universal
level.  However,  where  these  interventions  are  targeted  at  high-
risk  individuals  or  installed  in  proximity  to  schools,  psychiatric
hospitals, or prisons, these interventions could then operate at the
indicated/selective levels.

Other  measures  such  as  responsible  media  reporting  –  including
not  reporting  on  method  and  context  of  a  suicide  –  are  also
important for suicide prevention when used in combination with
means restriction interventions.

Why it is important to do this review

Although there is clear evidence of the effectiveness of restricting
access to lethal means as a suicide prevention measure (Hawton
2001;  Mann  2005;  Florentine  2010),  the  evidence  with  respect
to  means  restriction  for  the  prevention  of  suicide  on  roads  is
not  well  established.  Research  into  road  traffic  suicide  is  very
limited.  Previous  reviews  on  this  topic  have  either  focused  on
the  epidemiology  of  road  traffic  suicides  (Routley  2003;  Pompili
2012),  or  sought  to  establish  a  possible  link  between  single-car
crash  drivers  and  suicidal  intent  (Pompili  2006).  No  review  has
specifically addressed the prevention of road traffic suicides. This
is  an  important  area  given  the  high  levels  of  suicide  rates  in
men  and  their  use  of  this  method.  Hence,  we  did  a  systematic
review specifically focused on means restriction for prevention of
road  traffic  suicides  to  support  suicide  prevention  strategies  and
activities such as that produced by Highways England (Highways
England 2017).

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We  included  primary  research  studies  with  the  following  study
designs in this review: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-
RCTs, cross-over RCTs, and quasi-RCTs (trials in which allocation of
participants to study arms is not truly random). Other study types
eligible  for  inclusion  included  before-after  studies,  and  studies
using interrupted time series design. Due to the nature of this area
of study, we anticipated that randomised trials would be unlikely,
in  which  case  we  considered  the  best  available  evidence.  We
considered both published and unpublished studies. However, we
excluded publications with no effectiveness data, such as editorials
and case reports. All eligible studies were considered regardless of
language.

Types of participants

Adults or children of all ethnicities were eligible for inclusion in the
review. Participants included individuals exhibiting self-harm and/
or  suicidal  behaviour.  We  also  included  studies  with  participants

analysis, it had to have a postintervention evaluation of at least two
years' follow-up for outcome assessment.

Types of interventions

Experimental intervention

We considered studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions
to  restrict  the  availability  of,  or  access  to,  means  of  suicide  on
roads. These include the use of physical barriers or fencing at high-
risk  sites,  implementation  of  barriers  for  high-risk  individuals  or
situations, or in-built vehicle systems to detect and avoid collisions.

Some  or  all  these  interventions  could  operate  at  multiple  levels
within the universal, selective, and indicated hierarchy.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We searched the following electronic databases on 27 March 2020
(from the dates of inception):

• The Cochrane Library (2020, Issue 3);
• Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards);
• Ovid Embase (1974 onwards);
• Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards);
• Transport  Research  International  Documentation  (TRID)  (all

We excluded studies assessing the effectiveness of:

years to 27 March 2020).

• interventions  aimed  at  educating  professionals  or  the  public

about means of suicide;

The search strategies can be found in Appendix 1; Appendix 2; and
Appendix 3.

• interventions  to  restrict  cognitive  availability  of  means  of

suicide, for example, the impact of media portrayals;

• interventions aimed at improving recognition, screening for risk,
treatment,  or  the  understanding  of  causes  and  risk  factors  of
suicidal behaviour (including mental illness);

• interventions solely aimed at increasing opportunities for help-
seeking or third-party involvement (e.g. studies only assessing
the effects of crisis telephone support services or CCTV cameras
on road networks).

However,  studies  assessing  means  restriction  interventions  in
combination  with  other  suicide  prevention  measures  such  as
interventions  designed  to  increase  help-seeking  or  third-party
involvement or responsible media reporting, were included.

Comparator intervention

Comparator interventions or control conditions included any other
intervention  delivered  in  isolation  (e.g.  crisis  telephone  support
services  or  CCTV  on  road  networks),  or  no  intervention.  We  also
included studies with head-to-head comparator interventions (e.g.
signage on road networks versus structural changes).

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

• Suicide.
• Attempted suicide or self-harm.
• Study withdrawal.

Secondary outcomes

• Change in hospital admission rates for attempted suicide or self-

harm.

• Cost-effectiveness of interventions.

Timing of outcome assessment

The  effects  of  the  interventions  are  expected  to  be  immediate;
however,  studies  have  shown  that  a  short  duration  of  follow-
up  (less  than  two  years)  following  the  introduction  of  a  means
restriction  intervention  may  not  be  adequate  to  detect  a  change
in the rate of suicides (Hawkins 2007; Hawton 2007). Therefore, we
considered that for a study to be eligible for inclusion in a meta-

We  applied  no  date,  language,  or  publication  status  restrictions
to  these  searches.  In  addition,  we  searched  international  trial
registries  via  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  International
Clinical  Trials  Registry  Platform  (ICTRP)  (www.who.int/ictrp)  and
ClinicalTrials.gov  (clinicaltrials.gov)  to  identify  unpublished  and
ongoing studies.

Searching other resources

Grey literature

We searched the following sources of grey literature.

• OpenGrey (www.opengrey.eu/).
• Google Scholar.

Reference lists

We  intended  to  handsearch  the  reference  lists  of  all  included
studies.  We  searched  the  reference  lists  of  all  relevant  papers
lists  of  relevant
known  to  our  team,  and  the  reference 
systematic reviews.

Correspondence

We  contacted  corresponding  authors,  chief  investigators,  and
subject experts for information on unpublished or ongoing studies,
or to request additional study data.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two review authors (CO and AJ) undertook a two-stage screening
process.  First,  both  review  authors  independently  assessed  all
citations  from  the  searches  and  identified  relevant  titles  and
abstracts. In the second stage, both review authors independently
assessed full texts of potentially eligible studies to identify studies
to  be  included  in  the  review.  We  resolved  disagreements  at
either stage through discussion. Where disagreements could not be
resolved, we consulted a third review author.

Data extraction and management

We  planned  that  two  review  authors  (CO  and  AJ)  would
independently  extract  data  from  all  included  studies  using  a
modified  version  of  the  Cochrane  Public  Health  Group  Data

Extraction  and  Assessment  Template.  Data  to  be  extracted
included:

• methods:  study  design,  total  duration  of  study,  study  setting,

authors.

We planned to resolve any disagreements in the first instance by
discussion  and,  where  this  failed,  by  referral  to  a  third  review
author. However, data extraction was not possible as screening of
database searches did not reveal any studies suitable for inclusion
in the review.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

We  planned  that  two  review  authors  (CO  and  AJ)  would
independently  assess  the  risk  of  bias  of  all  included  studies.
We  anticipated  that  our  included  studies  could  consist  of  both
randomised and non-randomised studies, therefore our risk of bias
criteria  were  based  on  Cochrane's  'Risk  of  bias'  assessment  tool
(Higgins 2019) and the Cochrane Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised
Studies  of  Interventions  (ROBINS-I)  tool  (Sterne  2016a).  The
ROBINS-I  tool  is  currently  available  for  cohort  study  designs  but
adaptations are being developed for other non-randomised study
types (Sterne 2016b).

For  randomised  trials,  we  planned  to  make  a  judgement  of  'low
risk', 'unclear risk', or 'high risk' of bias for the following domains.

• Random sequence generation.
• Allocation concealment.
• Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors.
• Incomplete outcome data.
• Selective outcome reporting.
• Other sources of bias.

For non-randomised studies, we planned to make a judgement of
'low risk', 'moderate risk', 'serious risk', or 'critical risk' of bias for the
following domains.

• Confounding.
• Selection bias.
• Bias in classification of interventions.
• Bias due to deviations from intended interventions.
• Bias due to missing data.
• Bias in measurement of outcomes.
• Bias in selection of the reported result.

We planned to resolve any disagreements in the first instance by
discussion and where this failed, by referral to a third review author.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Measures of treatment effect

We  planned  to  report  count  or  rate  data  by  calculating  the
pooled  incidence  rate  ratio  (IRR)  using  a  random-effects  Poisson
regression analysis. The pooled IRR is the most appropriate effect
size  for  summarising  counts  of  an  outcome  (e.g.  deaths)  over  a
period  of  time.  We  selected  Poisson  regression  because  the  IRR
follows a Poisson distribution, that is, the distribution describing
independent, random events in a fixed time interval. In addition,
Poisson regression estimates the change in suicide incidence from
pre-  to  postintervention,  while  also  assessing  both  baseline  and
between-study variability in the intervention effect (Spittal 2015).
Where  applicable,  we  planned  to  summarise  studies  reporting
cost-effectiveness  or  economic  evidence  of  means  restriction
interventions  using  the  brief  economic  commentary  framework
(Shemilt 2019).

Unit of analysis issues

Cluster-randomised trials

For  cluster-randomised  trials,  we  planned  to  adjust  sample
sizes based on an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient
(ICC) derived from that trial (if available), from a similar trial, or from
a study of a similar population. We planned to undertake sensitivity
analyses to assess the impact of including such trials.

Cross-over trials

For  cross-over  trials,  we  planned  to  include  data  from  the  first
period  of  measurement  only  and  analyse  study  results  together
with those derived from parallel-group studies.

Studies with multiple treatment groups

Given  the  nature  of  the  area  of  study,  it  was  unlikely  that  we
found any studies with multiple comparators or studies that were
not  observational  in  design.  However,  if  such  studies  had  been
identified, we planned to combine the arms to create a single pair-
wise comparison when possible.

Dealing with missing data

We  intended  to  use  intention-to-treat  analysis  when  data  were
missing  for  participants  who  dropped  out  of  trials  before
completion. When data regarding an outcome of interest were not
reported,  we  planned  to  contact  the  authors  of  publications  to
obtain missing results.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We planned to assess heterogeneity between studies using the I2
statistic. This measure describes the percentage of total variation
across  studies  that  results  from  heterogeneity  rather  than  from
chance.  Thresholds  for  interpreting  the  I2  statistic  were:  0%  to
40%  –  might  not  be  important;  30%  to  60%  –  may  represent
moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% – may represent substantial
heterogeneity; 75% to 100% – considerable heterogeneity. Where
there  was  substantial  heterogeneity,  we  planned  to  explore
possible causes. Where not appropriate, we planned to summarise
studies in tables and conduct narrative synthesis.

Assessment of reporting biases

Reporting  bias  occurs  when  the  decision  to  publish  a  research
finding  is  influenced  by  the  direction  and  significance  of  its
results (Egger 1997). We planned to assess small-study effects and

potential  publication  bias  using  a  funnel  plot  if  a  meta-analysis
included  results  of  at  least  10  studies.  If  required,  we  planned  to
conduct sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the meta-
analysis conclusions to different assumptions about the causes of
funnel plot asymmetry.

Data synthesis

We  planned  to  analyse  data  using  Review  Manager  5  (RevMan
Web  2019).  Where  more  than  one  study  examined  the  same
intervention, and we judged the study populations and methods as
being sufficiently similar, we planned to conduct a meta-analysis
using  a  random-effects  Poisson  regression  model  to  provide  an
overall estimate of treatment effect. We planned to report count or
rate data by calculating the pooled IRR. Where we deemed meta-
analysis inappropriate due to significant heterogeneity, we planned
to provide a narrative synthesis of results.

to undertake sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of including
such trials.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence

We  planned  to  use  the  GRADE  system  to  assess  the  certainty  of
evidence  for  each  of  our  main  outcomes  (suicide  and  attempted
suicide or self-harm) (Schünemann 2011). Using the four standard
GRADE  levels  of  evidence  (high,  moderate,  low,  and  very  low)
we  planned  to  assign  evidence  from  RCTs  an  initial  certainty
rating  of  high  and  evidence  from  observational  studies  an  initial
certainty  rating  of  low  (Balshem  2011).  We  planned  to  upgrade
or  downgrade  these  levels  based  on  our  judgements  regarding
risk  of  bias,  precision,  consistency,  indirectness  of  study  results,
and publication bias. We planned to create separate 'Summary of
findings' tables for the following comparisons:

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Suicidal  behaviour  is  strongly  associated  with  a  history  of  self-
harm or mental disorder. Effect sizes in these high-risk groups are
generally  higher  than  in  the  general  population.  When  data  are
available, we planned to conduct the following subgroup analyses.

• History of self-harm versus no known history of self-harm.
• Diagnosis of mental disorder versus no known history of mental

• All means restriction interventions (delivered in isolation or in
combination with other interventions) to restrict the availability
of, or access to, means of suicide on roads.

Sensitivity analysis

For this review, we planned on analysing the effects of excluding
studies  that  were  methodologically  different  from  other  studies,
studies  judged  to  be  at  high  risk  of  bias  across  one  or  more
domain(s),  and  studies  that  contributed  substantial  levels  of
statistical  heterogeneity.  If  the  exclusion  of  these  studies  did  not
substantially  alter  the  direction  of  effect  or  the  precision  of  the
effect  estimates,  then  we  planned  to  include  data  from  these
studies in the analysis. For cluster-randomised trials, we planned

Summary of main results

Our  review  identified  no  eligible  studies  that  assessed  the
effectiveness of restriction of physical means of access as a method
of preventing suicide on roads.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

We  were  aware  of  the  limited  nature  of  the  research  around
road  traffic  suicides  beforehand,  so  we  ensured  we  accessed  the
maximum amount of literature possible on this topic. This included
designing  a  broad  search  strategy  incorporating  a  wide  range  of
search  terms,  searching  a  wide  range  of  databases  –  including
specialised  transportation  databases  –  and  contacting  subject
experts  for  information  on  unpublished  or  ongoing  studies.  It  is
unlikely that we missed any relevant studies

Quality of the evidence

We found no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.

We are not aware of any other reviews that specifically address this
intervention in a road setting. Other reviews have focused on the
epidemiology of road traffic suicides (Routley 2003; Pompili 2012),
or sought to establish a link between single-car accident drivers and
suicidal intent (Pompili 2006).

Implications for practice

This  review  identified  no  eligible  studies  that  assessed  the
effectiveness  of  restriction  of  physical  means  of  access  as  a
method  of  preventing  suicide  on  roads.  This  does  not  mean
that  means  restriction  interventions  would  not  work  in  a  road
traffic  setting.  Previous  research  has  shown  that  installation  of
physical barriers and fencing at high-risk jumping sites, especially
bridges  and  railways,  could  be  effective  at  reducing  the  number
of  suicides  at  these  sites  (Pirkis  2015;  Ueda  2015;  Okolie  2020).
Since barriers and fences provide a physical obstruction to prevent
individuals  from  jumping  off  or  onto  structures,  this  approach
may  also  be  relevant  in  the  prevention  of  suicides  on  actual
road  networks  –  particularly  pedestrian  suicide  –  by  restricting
pedestrian  access  to  road  networks.  In  situations  where  physical
barriers  are  not  appropriate,  other  measures  such  as  painted
lines and cross-hatchings have been used to mark areas that are
unsafe  to  enter  (Public  Health  England  2015).  Anyone  crossing
such a boundary will be conspicuous, and this may be enough to
deter  suicidal  individuals  or  offer  an  opportunity  for  third-party
intervention. Similarly, the installation of blue light-emitting diode
(LED) lamps at railway crossings and platforms has been shown to
decrease the number of suicides at these sites (Matsubayashi 2013).
This intervention could be applicable on road networks especially
those identified as high-risk sites.

Measures suggested for preventing vehicle driver suicides include
the  use  of  alcohol  ignition  interlock  devices,  intelligent  speed
adaptation  (ISA)  systems,  the  use  of  electronic  driving  licences
(Smart licences), driver monitoring systems, and the employment
of automatic emergency systems (Routley 2003; WHO 2017). Some
in-vehicle  measures  such  as  seat-belts,  airbags,  driver  assistant
systems,  and  anticollision  radars  may  offer  some  protection,  but
these systems can be overridden or ignored by a driver intent on
taking their own life and are, therefore, unlikely to be effective at
preventing driver suicides (Routley 2003).

Little is known currently about road traffic suicides in comparison
to other methods of suicides. Determining suicidal intent is a key
issue, therefore clear objective criteria to determine ascertainment
is  necessary  in  order  to  scale  up  and  study  this  method  more
accurately. In the absence of any substantial evidence, we advocate
for  more  awareness  on  road  traffic  suicides  and  its  inclusion  in
future government suicide prevention policies.

Implications for research

The  lack  of  eligible  studies  emphasises  the  need  for  future
robust  studies  that  aim  to  investigate  the  effectiveness  of
interventions  to  prevent  road  traffic  suicides.  This  would  be
particularly  important  for  in-vehicle  technologies  in  which  an
override of the system is not possible, such as in fully autonomous
(driverless/self-drive)  vehicles.  However,  there  are  ethical,  legal,
and  safety  concerns  with  self-driving  technology  (Hevelke  2015).
Overall,  a  detailed  knowledge  and  further  understanding  of  this
suicide  method  is  required  for  prevention  efforts.  This  would
require  improvements  to  existing  incident-reporting  systems,
cross-sector collaboration, and data-sharing processes. Currently,
most national mental health and public health strategies on suicide
refer to railways but not roads. Consideration of suicide on roads in
future government suicide prevention policies is needed. Reliable
methods  of  studying  road  traffic  suicides  are  also  important  in
determining  suicide  ascertainment.  This  could  be  accomplished
by  the  routine  investigation  of  every  road  traffic  fatality  by  an
interdisciplinary  team  (Hernetkoski  1998),  including  complete
autopsies  (both  psychological  and  forensic)  routinely  performed
for fatal single-vehicle, single-occupant vehicle incidents (Pompili
2012).  Furthermore,  an  investigation  into  any  factors  in  play  in
determining  why  an  individual  would  contemplate  using  road
traffic collision as a means of suicide is required. This is especially
important because of the widespread availability of motor vehicles.
One  study  exploring  factors  influencing  and  discouraging  the
decision to attempt suicide on railway networks found that people
chose  this  method  because  railway  settings  were  easy  to  access
and  because  of  an  inaccurate  perception  of  certain  and  quick
lethality  (Marzano  2019).  A  study  incorporating  participants  who
had survived a suicide attempt on the road would be useful to gain
insights that could aid in prevention.

Further  research  is  required  for  the  identification  of  individuals
who may be about to make a suicide attempt on a road. Previous
research  on  railways  suggests  that  there  are  several  behaviours
that may be identifiable in the moments leading up to a suicide or
suicide attempt which may present opportunities for intervention
(Mackenzie  2018).  Driver  monitoring  systems  currently  being
developed to reduce vehicle speed on detection of risky patterns of
driving may have the potential for application in preventing driver

suicide  (Routley  2003).  In  addition,  most  research  on  this  topic
normally  focuses  only  on  people  who  died  and  not  on  survivors
of  suicide  attempts.  Focusing  only  on  suicide  incidents  could
underestimate the true scale of the problem and overall impacts of
interventions on suicidal behaviour. Further research incorporating
suicide  attempts  is,  therefore,  required  in  this  regard,  as  well  as
to explore various health-related issues in suicide survivors which
could aid in prevention efforts. Other factors such as the 'Werther
Effect'  need  to  be  investigated  (Jonas  1992).  Prominent  media
coverage  and  style  of  reporting  may  contribute  to  imitation  or
contagion  and  thus  lead  to  an  increase  in  use  of  this  method.  In
addition, identification of the road networks and locations where
road traffic suicides occur more frequently is required in order to
target  the  appropriate  interventions.  Finally,  while  it  may  not  be
ethical  or  practical  to  conduct  RCTs  on  interventions  to  reduce
suicide on roads, further well-designed high-quality observational
studies are required to further evaluate the effectiveness of these
interventions.  Controlled  before-after  studies  would  provide  a
higher level of confidence in the findings around ruling out possible
influence of secular trends and co-occurring interventions.
