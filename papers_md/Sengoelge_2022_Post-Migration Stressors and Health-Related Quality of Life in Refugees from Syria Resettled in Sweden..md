Abstract: The link between post-migration stressors and mental ill health is well documented in
refugees resettled in high-income host countries, but the consequences of these stressors on refugees’
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are less known. This study examined the association between
post-migration stressors and HRQoL among Syrian adult refugees resettled in Sweden using a
preference-based value set obtained from the general Swedish population. A total of 1215 Syrian
adults, ages 18–64 years, granted residency in Sweden, responded to a postal questionnaire in 2016
regarding various aspects of their resettlement. The European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Five
Level (EQ–5D–5L) questionnaire was used to assess HRQoL through an EQ–5D–5L index score (range;
0=dead to 1=full health). The index score was preference weighted using a Swedish population
value set. Predictors were four self-reported post-migration stressors related to daily living in
the host country: ﬁnancial strain, social strain, competency strain and perceived discrimination
divided into low, medium and high levels of experienced stress. Multivariable linear regression
models were employed to assess the association between post-migration stressors and HRQoL
index score, adjusting for potentially traumatic events in the pre- and peri-migration phase as well
as sociodemographic confounders/covariates (sex, age, education, civil status, immigration year).
The Syrian refugees had a mean EQ–5D–5L index score of 0.863 (SD = 0.145). There was strong
evidence of a negative dose-response association in both unadjusted and adjusted models between
HRQoL and the post-migration stressors ﬁnancial strain and social strain—i.e., there was a stepwise,
and statistically signiﬁcant, decrease in HRQoL when going from low to medium to high strain.
Competency strain and discrimination were only associated with lower HRQoL when experienced at
high levels in fully adjusted models. High exposure to potentially traumatic experiences before or
during ﬂight was also associated with lower HRQoL. Syrian refugees resettled in Sweden reported a
lower HRQoL than the general Swedish population and lower than age-matched Swedish adults.
The present study results point to the possible adverse effects of post-migration stressors on HRQoL.

The link between stressors pre-, peri- and post-migration and mental ill health in
refugees resettled in high-income host countries is well documented [1–4], and a growing
number of studies are exploring how these stressors are associated with the broader concept
of quality of life (QoL). A review of refugee populations in high-income countries concluded
that social networks and social integration was positively associated with QoL, whereas
mental ill health (e.g., depression or PTSD) was negatively associated with QoL [5]. When
comparing QoL in general and clinical populations of refugees in community settings, a

recent review found that there was a wide heterogeneity in the scores, and domain-speciﬁc
patterns of QoL varied across the two groups [6]. Both reviews acknowledge the complexity
and diversity of the refugee experiences and the variety of elements that may affect QoL.
Indeed, QoL is a complex, multidimensional concept developed to encompass an
individual’s perception of one’s physical and psychological state, level of independence,
social relationships, personal beliefs and relationship to the environment [7,8]. Moreover,
health is a major component of QoL, yet the related term health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) has been inconsistently deﬁned and operationalized in the scientiﬁc literature
of migrants [9]. For example, use of the term HRQoL when referring to a measure of
self-perceived health status, or when stating that research is focusing on HRQoL when the
instrument measures “overall” QoL [10]. The key to HRQoL research is an individual’s
evaluation of one’s health state, as compared to solely reporting on it [11,12]. The term
HRQoL should be utilized when either: (a) exploring how health affects QoL using separate
measures of each and statistically exploring how they relate to one another, or (b) examining
the utility associated with different health states using health status questionnaires with an
attached value set [13].

Preference-based HRQoL studies both assess and apply preference weights for dif-
ferent health states. This valuation is summarized as a health index score anchored on
a 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health) scale [14]. Such measures have been increasingly used to
determine whether there has been a change in HRQoL in the population [15]. Examples of
such measures include the SF−6D [16] and the European Quality of Life Five Dimensions
known as the EQ–5D [17]. Few studies in the published literature to date have explored
HRQoL in refugee populations using such a preference-based approach. One study of 133
Syrian refugees in Germany found that the HRQoL of the refugees reported was lower
compared to a representative German population sample [18]. A prior publication by our
research group used the EQ–5D–5L index score to examine gender differences in HRQoL
in Syrian adult refugees resettled in Sweden but based on the United Kingdom population
data as no value set was available for the Swedish population at the time [19]. The study
found that male sex, younger age, living with a partner and social support were positively
associated with HRQoL [19].

Moreover, potential determinants of HRQoL in refugee populations might be related
to the level of trauma experienced before and during ﬂight [20], including exposure to
torture [21]. Other determinants may involve stressors experienced in the resettlement
phase [22]. These post-migration stressors can be family-related (e.g., family separation,
conﬂicts with family), related to poor social integration and weak social networks (e.g., no
or low number of friends from within or outside one’s ethnic community, low participation
in activities), or related to ﬁnancial or housing difﬁculties, poor host language proﬁciency
and/or unemployment [23]. All of these resettlement stressors have been shown to be asso-
ciated with higher levels of negative mental health outcomes, particularly post-traumatic
stress disorder, anxiety and depression [3,24]. HRQoL may also likely be linked to cultural
values in the perception of one’s own state of health [25].

In sum, there is a scarcity of studies that utilize the full potential of HRQoL measures
in refugee populations examining preference-based HRQoL and in relation to ﬂight-related
trauma exposure and post-migration stressors. Host countries need to obtain an under-
standing of the HRQoL of its refugee population in order to allocate resources and monitor
the effectiveness of broad community interventions. With this knowledge, host countries
can more effectively identify and support positive resettlement interventions, services
and policies that mitigate unmet needs. Thus, the aim of the present study was to estab-
lish a benchmark reporting of HRQoL among a sample of Syrian adult refugees resettled
in Sweden using preference-weighted data, and to explore how post-migration factors
inﬂuence HRQoL.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Population

Eligible participants for the study included all adult refugees from Syria who were
given permanent residency in Sweden and resettled in the country between 2011 and
2013. A random sample of 4000 refugees was drawn from a sampling frame of N = 9662
identiﬁed through the Swedish Population Registry. All sampled refugees were invited
to participate in a postal questionnaire survey in 2016 on self-reported health, pre- and
peri-migration experiences and various aspects of their resettlement, drawn up in Swedish
and back-translated into Arabic. Of the invited refugees, 1215 returned the questionnaire
(response rate = 30%). More detailed information on design, sampling and recruitment
strategies and potential study population bias has been previously published [26].

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Five Level (EQ–5D–5L)

The EQ–5D–5L is a well-known indirect, generic measure of HRQoL consisting of ﬁve
domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression [27].
For each domain, participants endorse one of ﬁve levels of functioning ranging from no
problems (=1), slight problems (=2), moderate problems (=3), severe problems (=4) to unable
to/extreme problems (=5). A full, 5-digit scoring proﬁle, or health state, is created by putting
each domain score after one another in the order outlined above (starting with mobility and
ending with anxiety/depression). For example, someone reporting ‘no problems’ on all ﬁve
domains has a proﬁle of 11,111, whereas someone with ‘extreme problems’ in the domains
usual activities and anxiety/depression and ‘no problems’ in the other three domains has
a proﬁle of 11515. In total, there are 3125 possible combinations of domains scores and
thus 3125 possible health states. In order to compare the perceived relative value or utility
of different states, preference data are obtained from people experiencing these states by
asking their willingness to trade time in their current state for time in ‘perfect health’ (time
trade-off method), and this preference is converted to a number between 0 and 1. People
who are perfectly happy with their health will not be willing to trade off any time and they
deﬁne the ‘perfect health’-end of the spectrum and are given an index score of 1 (10/10 = 1).
People who struggle with severe health issues may be willing to trade, say, 10 years in
their current health for 1 year in perfect health (hypothetically), and are given an index
score of 0.1 (1/10 = 0.1). The closer the index score is to 1, the better the associated health
and HRQoL. A value set for a population is a complete coding scheme where each of the
possible 3125 health states have an assigned index score based on preference data from
the population in question. Using the example above, the proﬁle 11111 will have an index
score of 1.0 (perfect health), whereas the proﬁle 11515 may have an index score of, say,
0.70 (this depends on how the people with this proﬁle in the population responded to
the time trade-off question). The present study uses a value set from the Swedish general
population to estimate HRQoL index scores for respondents [28].

2.2.2. Post-Migration Factors

The Refugee Post-Migration Stress Scale was used to measure four domains of post-
migration strain related to resettlement in the host country: (1) ﬁnancial strain; (2) social
strain; (3) competency strain; (4) perceived discrimination [29]. Financial strain relates
to material and economic hardship that could affect integrity, independence, dignity and
well-being (example: ‘Worry about unstable ﬁnancial situation’). Social strain relates to
social hardship, e.g., feeling isolated or frustrated due to loss of status (example: ‘Feeling
excluded or isolated in the Swedish society’). Competency strain relates to feelings of
inadequacy of host-country speciﬁc skills needed to successfully navigate and function
in daily life (example: ‘Bothering difﬁculties communicating in Swedish’). Perceived
discrimination asks about experiences of unfair treatment in Sweden, either verbally or
nonverbally, on the basis of prejudice (example: ‘Feeling disrespected due to my national
background’). All domains are comprised of three items, except perceived discrimination

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2509

that has four items. Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they experience
each item on a scale ranging from 1 = never to 5 = very often. Please refer to Figure S1
for the distribution of responses on individual items. Respondents were categorized into
low, medium and high strain for each of the four domains. The low-strain group had a
maximum score of 2 = seldom for all items within a given domain. The high-strain group
answered 4 = often or 5 = very often on all items within a given domain, and the medium-
strain group consisted of the remaining. Cronbach’s alpha for the four domains ranged
between 0.80 and 0.84.

2.2.3. Sociodemographic and Pre-Migration Trauma Exposure

Potential confounders included were sociodemographic variables, e.g., sex, age, edu-
cation, civil status and year of immigration to Sweden. Potentially traumatic experiences
(PTEs) related to before (pre-ﬂight) or during (peri-ﬂight) migration were measured with
the Refugee Trauma History Checklist, tested and validated in a sample of Syrian asylum
seekers in Sweden [30]. The scale asks about eight PTEs prior to ﬂight, and the same
eight during ﬂight, for a total of 16 PTE items (e.g., ‘War at close quarter’ and ‘Forced
separation from family or close friends’). A PTE adversity ratio (PTE-AR) introduced by
Steel et al., was calculated as the number of endorsed PTEs divided by the total number of
PTEs inquired about and categorized into: <0.2; 0.2–0.29; 0.3–0.39; ≥0.4 [2].

2.3. Statistical Analyses

Data were inspected for errors, outliers and missing values. Frequency distributions,
simple summary statistics and cross tabulations were used to make the descriptive table.
Sociodemographic variables were modelled as in prior studies by our group to facilitate
comparison. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression were used to explore the as-
sociation between post-migration stressors and the ﬁve domains in the EQ5 scale. Each
domain was analyzed separately and answer choices were dichotomized with choice 1 (i.e.,
‘no problem’) as the reference category and choices 2–5 (i.e., ‘slight problems’ or higher)
deﬁned as a case. In the adjusted analysis, missing was handled through listwise deletion
with the total number contributing data to full models indicated in the relevant table. Odds
ratios (ORs) with 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI) and associated p-values are presented.
Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression was used to investigate the association
between post-migration stressors and HRQoL, with results reported through unstandard-
ized regression coefﬁcients with 95% CI and associated p-values. Standard regression
coefﬁcients were also estimated to make it easier to compare regression coefﬁcients for
different post-migration stressors. The standardized coefﬁcients are only commented on
in the text in order not to clutter tables. Missing values were handled through listwise
deletion as in logistic regression (total number included in models is denoted in the table).
Linear regression was deemed appropriate even if the outcome was skewed due to the
large sample size (central limit theorem).

3. Results

Descriptive statistics of all respondents are shown in Table 1, as well as the proportion
of respondents reporting at least ‘slight’ problems within each of the ﬁve dimensions of the
EQ–5D–5L. Dimensions four (pain/discomfort) and ﬁve (anxiety/depression) were the two
dimensions with the highest number of respondents reporting problems (over half in each
dimension). Respondents with higher levels of post-migration stress reported problems in
each of the ﬁve dimensions more frequently and had lower index scores. This occurred for
all post-migration stressors. Furthermore, there was a clear dose-response pattern for each
stressor. The high stress group reported more problems and had a lower mean index score
than the medium stress group, which had more problems/a lower index score than the low
stress group.

Table 2 presents unadjusted and adjusted logistic models of each dimension of the
EQ–5D–5L regressed on post-migration stressors, controlling for pre- and peri-migration

stress and sociodemographic variables. There was strong and consistent evidence in both
the unadjusted and partially adjusted models that all post-migration stressors were associ-
ated with increased odds of reporting problems in all ﬁve dimensions of the EQ–5D–5L,
with the exception of discrimination. In general, there were small to moderate attenu-
ations of the ORs after controlling for sociodemographic variables, indicating that the
confounding by these variables was not substantial. In the fully adjusted models with all
post-migration stressors included together with pre- and peri-migration stress, the evidence
for associations changed notably. Self-care (dimension 2) was no longer associated with
any of the post-migration stressors, and the associations between competency strain and
the EQ–5D–5L dimensions were markedly attenuated or no longer signiﬁcant. A similar
attenuation pattern was seen for social strain, though the association between social strain
and dimension 4 (pain/discomfort) and 5 (anxiety/depression) remained highly signiﬁcant.
The strongest evidence was found for ﬁnancial strain, which was strongly associated with
all EQ–5D–5L dimensions except for self-care, with the odds of experiencing problems
three- to fourfold higher in the high ﬁnancial strain group compared to the low strain group
(all p-values < 0.001).

In Table 3, unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models of the EQ–5D–5L index
score are presented. There was strong evidence in both unadjusted and partly adjusted
models that all four post-migration stressors were associated with a lower index score
and there were clear dose-response patterns. When comparing standardized regression
coefﬁcients in partly adjusted models, ﬁnancial strain and social strain were the two
stressors associated with the greatest change in the standardized index score. In the fully
adjusted model, there was very strong evidence that respondents reporting the highest
level of ﬁnancial and social strain had lower index scores compared to the lowest strain
groups, with the standardized regression coefﬁcient for ﬁnancial strain much larger than
that for social strain (β = −0.296 vs. β = −0.166, respectively). There was also evidence that
respondents in the medium strain group for these two stressors had lower index scores
compared to the low strain group, though the evidence was weaker. Respondents reporting
high levels of competency strain and discrimination had lower index scores compared
to their respective reference categories, though the standardized regression coefﬁcients
were notably smaller than for ﬁnancial strain (β = competency strain = −0.108; β = discri-
mination = −0.094) and we found no evidence for an association for the medium strain
group. Lastly, high exposure to potentially traumatic experiences before or during ﬂight
was associated with a lower HRQoL index score at the p < 0.01 level.

4. Discussion

In the present study, refugees from Syria resettled in Sweden reported a lower HRQoL
than an age-matched Swedish reference population [31] and lower than the general Swedish
norm data from which the value set was derived [28]. A markedly higher proportion of
refugees reported problems in the Anxiety/depression domain (62% vs. 37% in the Swedish
norm data). In contrast, the proportion with reported problems in the domains Mobility,
Self-care and Usual activities were comparable in both groups, whereas a somewhat lower
proportion of refugees reported problems in the domain Pain/discomfort (55% vs. 68% in
the Swedish norm data). Mental health is therefore the likely driver of the lower HRQoL
reported by the refugee group. However, comparability of HRQoL index scores in the
current study with those of the representative Swedish population samples is limited due
to the younger age of the current sample. Approximately half of the refugees were under
40 years of age compared to 9% in the Swedish sample, and there exists a known and very
strong negative association between age and HRQoL. The estimated mean index score is
also somewhat higher than the 0.82 value found in a study of Syrian refugees resettled
in Germany [18]. Possible explanations for this difference include the use of value sets
obtained from different populations (Sweden versus Germany). Additionally, an inclusion
criterion in the German study was the presence of mild to moderate symptoms of post-
traumatic stress, whereas the present study used a general refugee population. Moreover,
the German sample had a notably higher proportion of singles/divorced and civil status
was strongly associated with HRQoL in our study.

To our knowledge, the present study is one of the ﬁrst studies to estimate HRQoL using
preference-weighted data in a large sample of refugees while exploring the association
between HRQoL and post-migration stressors. Refugees who reported experiencing high
levels of post-migration stressors had the lowest HRQoL scores. The stressors driving this
association were ﬁrstly ﬁnancial strain, followed by social strain.

The measure of ﬁnancial strain used in the present study was related to material and
economic hardship threatening integrity, independence, dignity and well-being. Refugees
in Sweden receive ﬁnancial assistance to cover basic needs for clothing and food, but the
ﬁndings from this study suggest that many refugees nonetheless experience ﬁnancial strain
that may adversely and signiﬁcantly impact HRQoL. This is supported by a study on Iraqi
asylum seekers in the Netherlands, which found that socioeconomic living conditions was
a more important predictor of reduced overall QoL than psychopathology [32]. While
relatively few studies have explored the association between ﬁnancial strain and QoL in
refugee populations, there is solid evidence for the adverse association between ﬁnancial
strain and mental distress (for an overview see [4,24]), including a recent, longitudinal
study from Australia providing consistent evidence across all time-points that economic
stressors were positively associated with mental illness [1]. Limited access to employment
and economic opportunities is key to explaining the economic hardship often faced by
refugees. Employment rates of refugees resettled in high-income countries are typically
under 20% in the ﬁrst two years after arrival and then increase depending on the host
country. However, refugees have been shown to continue having lower employment
rates than other immigrants and natives, even ten years after migration [33]. Moreover,
adequacy of income and employment have been shown to be signiﬁcant predictors of
general mental health for resettled refugees [34,35] and to moderate the adverse mental
health effects of pre- and peri-migratory stressors experienced by refugees [36]. Barriers
to employment identiﬁed by refugees include adverse effects of PTSD, problems with
professional recertiﬁcation and economic barriers to pursuing education [37].

In the case of social strain related to feelings of isolation and loss of status in the
host country, a fair number of studies have found positive associations between social
integration/support and QoL both in selected [38,39] and more general refugee popula-
tions [40–42]. Studies have further shown that social connectedness and support are key
enablers for integration, health and well-being, with some evidence suggesting patterns
are gender speciﬁc [43,44]. A recent, large German survey of 4325 resettled refugees found

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2509

11 of 14

that contact with members of the host society, better host country language skills and
being employed were related to reduced distress and higher levels of life satisfaction [45].
The negative relationship between social integration and mental distress has been docu-
mented in several studies [39,46,47], including in the abovementioned longitudinal study of
refugees resettled in Australia [1]. The study found that loneliness during resettlement was
positively associated with PTSD and severe mental illness over time, though the strength of
the association ﬂuctuated across timepoints, suggesting time-varying effects. A challenge
when comparing ﬁndings from the present study to the existing literature is that the concept
of social strain is deﬁned and measured in different ways across studies. Whereas many
studies focus primarily on loneliness and the lack of social networks, the present study
also includes status loss and frustration at not being able to use skills and competence.
In summary, the overall ﬁndings in the current study on ﬁnancial and social strain are
consistent with much of the available evidence to date linking both stressors to lower levels
of positive mental health outcomes, such as QoL and well-being, and elevated levels of
mental distress.

Contrasting this overall picture is a recent systematic review by Hou and colleagues [48].
The review investigated both general distress and well-being/QoL in relation to post-
migration everyday life stressors stratiﬁed into subjective (perceived emotional distress
associated with different daily experiences), interpersonal (e.g., conﬂict, discrimination,
isolation, lack of emotional support) and material (e.g., housing/neighborhood contexts,
accommodation difﬁculties, employment-related issues, access to social or mental health
services). Results showed consistent positive associations of daily stressors with general
distress but, somewhat surprisingly, non-signiﬁcant effect sizes between daily stressors and
general well-being/QoL across seven studies. The authors concluded that more research
focusing on domain-speciﬁc QoL in relation to stressors is needed. By using a single index
value as the outcome measure for HRQoL, the present study took a somewhat opposite
approach. The strong associations found between both ﬁnancial and social strain and the
single index HRQoL score suggest this approach may be reasonable. A large sample size
increasing power may partly explain why signiﬁcant associations were found in the present
study and not in the studies included in the review by Hou [48]. Another possible explana-
tion is that the present study used a preference-based approach to HRQoL. Our ﬁndings
demonstrate that worse HRQoL among Syrian adult refugees living in Sweden may not be
limited to mental health problems, but also extend to other dimensions of general health
that in turn inﬂuence quality of life. This is important from a health determinants viewpoint
as interventions to address this are limited by the complexity of resettlement hardships
faced by this group as they attempt to acculturate into the host society. Future studies are
needed to analyze the HRQoL of refugees in Sweden longitudinally, as compared to the
general Swedish population and in refugees of different countries of origin. More research
is also required to identify mechanisms that strengthen HRQoL, such as support networks,
employment and education opportunities.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of the study include random sampling from population-based registries,
a large sample size and the use of well-established measures of key variables. A particu-
lar strength is that HRQoL was estimated by combining refugees’ HRQoL self-reported
data with an experienced, preference-based value set obtained from the general Swedish
population. The study thus follows expert advice that studies on HRQoL should move
beyond looking solely at self-perceived health and/or general QoL, and instead focus on
the utility associated with health, accomplished by using health status data in combination
with an attached value set [13]. Our results represent a benchmark that can be used to
evaluate changes in HRQoL in this sample over time or after participation in speciﬁc
interventions or policies. Furthermore, information about the sociodemographic variables,
except civil status, was retrieved from national, high-quality registers, reducing the risk of
information bias.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2509

12 of 14

A limitation is that self-reported health is likely linked to cultural values [25], thus,
applying preference data from one culture to another, in this case adults in Sweden to
adults with a refugee background from Syria living in Sweden, could lead to an index score
with low validity. However, in the absence of available preference data from any refugee
population, this may still be the best alternative. Another limitation is that the data were
self-reported through a postal survey. Refugees with low HRQoL may have not been able
to participate in the survey (non-responders), resulting in potential selection bias and a
sample that is healthier than the target population.

5. Conclusions

Syrian refugees resettled in Sweden report a lower HRQoL than the general Swedish
population and lower than age-matched Swedish adults. Findings of the present study also
point to the adverse effects of post-migration stressors on HRQoL. Effective, community-
based interventions are needed to reduce the ﬁnancial and social strain experienced by
this population. Moreover, multidimensional interventions are recommended to improve
HRQoL in combination with advocacy and support to improve ﬁnancial status and social
competency skills.
