Abstract 
Background:  Many patients with metastatic breast cancer experience cancer- and treatment-related side effects that 
impair activities of daily living and negatively affect the quality of life. There is a need for interventions that improve 
quality of life by alleviating fatigue and other side effects during palliative cancer treatment. Beneficial effects of exer-
cise have been observed in the curative setting, but, to date, comparable evidence in patients with metastatic breast 
cancer is lacking. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a structured and individualized 9-month exercise 
intervention in patients with metastatic breast cancer on quality of life, fatigue, and other cancer- and treatment-
related side effects.

Methods:  The EFFECT study is a multinational, randomized controlled trial including 350 patients with metastatic 
breast cancer. Participants are randomly allocated (1:1) to an exercise or control group. The exercise group participates 
in a 9-month multimodal exercise program, starting with a 6-month period where participants exercise twice a week 
under the supervision of an exercise professional. After completing this 6-month period, one supervised session is 
replaced by one unsupervised session for 3 months. In addition, participants are instructed to be physically active 
30 min/day on all remaining days of the week, while being supported by an activity tracker and exercise app.

Participants allocated to the control group receive standard medical care, general written physical activity advice, 
and an activity tracker, but no structured exercise program. The primary outcomes are quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30, 
summary score) and fatigue (EORTC QLQ-FA12), assessed at baseline, 3, 6 (primary endpoint), and 9 months post-
baseline. Secondary outcomes include physical fitness, physical performance, physical activity, anxiety, depression, 
pain, sleep problems, anthropometric data, body composition, and blood markers. Exploratory outcomes include 
quality of working life, muscle thickness, urinary incontinence, disease progression, and survival. Additionally, the cost-
effectiveness of the exercise program is assessed. Adherence and safety are monitored throughout the intervention 
period.

Discussion:  This large randomized controlled trial will provide evidence regarding the (cost-) effectiveness of exer-
cise during treatment of metastatic breast cancer. If proven (cost-)effective, exercise should be offered to patients with 
metastatic breast cancer as part of standard care.

Background
Breast  cancer  is  the  most  commonly  diagnosed  can-
cer  and  the  leading  cause  of  cancer  mortality  among 
women  worldwide  [1].  The  majority  of  breast  cancer-
related  deaths  are  due  to  metastatic  breast  cancer 
(mBC) [2]. Despite the availability of a number of treat-
ment options, treatment of mBC remains palliative with 
a  poor  median  5-year  survival  rate  of  25%  [3].  Hence, 
maintaining the quality of life (QoL) is one of the most 
important goals for patients with mBC. Side effects that 
affect  patients’  QoL  include  fatigue,  decreased  physi-
cal fitness, insomnia, depression, neuropathy, and pain 
[4–8].  Of  these  side  effects,  fatigue  has  the  most  sub-
stantial impact on QoL by negatively affecting activities 
of  daily  life.  Therefore,  interventions  that  can  improve 
QoL by alleviating fatigue and other cancer- and treat-
ment-related side effects during palliative treatment are 
needed.

There is ample evidence that exercise is safe and well-
tolerated  during  and  after  curative  cancer  treatment, 
and  that  it  has  a  significant,  positive  effect  on  a  range 
of side effects, including fatigue [9]. To date, these posi-
tive  effects  of  exercise  have  not  been  demonstrated  in 
patients  with  mBC,  since  these  patients  are  typically 
excluded from exercise interventions due to the potential 
risk of bone fractures and poor prognosis. Only very few, 
mainly  small  studies  with  short  interventions  have  been 
performed.  A  recent  systematic  review  in  patients  with 
advanced  cancer,  including  patients  with  mBC,  showed 
that  exercise  is  safe  and  feasible  [10].  More  specifically, 
it  has  been  shown  that  exercise  appears  safe  in  patients 
with  bone  metastases,  if  it  includes  a  supervised  com-
ponent  [11].  The  summarized  evidence  indicates  that 
exercise improves physical performance and functioning 
in patients with advanced cancer, whereas the effects on 
fatigue,  QoL,  and  other  cancer-  and  treatment-related 
side effects are mixed [10]. A high-quality and adequately 

powered study is needed to evaluate comprehensively the 
efficacy of exercise in patients with mBC.

The randomized controlled EFFECT study is designed 
to  assess  the  effects  of  a  structured  and  individualized 
9-month  exercise  intervention  in  patients  with  mBC  on 
QoL  and  physical  fatigue.  Secondary  aims  are  to  inves-
tigate  the  cost-effectiveness  of  the  exercise  intervention 
and  exercise  effects  on  other  cancer-  and  treatment-
related  side  effects  and  blood  markers.  We  also  inves-
tigate  the  effects  of  exercise  on  overall  survival,  breast 
cancer-specific  survival,  and  progression-free  survival. 
Here, we describe the design of the EFFECT study.

Methods/design
Study design

The  EFFECT  study  is  a  multinational,  randomized  con-
trolled trial with two study arms: 1) the intervention arm 
that  receives  a  9-month  structured  and  individualized 
exercise  program  in  addition  to  usual  care,  and  2)  the 
control arm that receives general physical activity advice 
and  an  activity  tracker  in  addition  to  usual  care,  but  no 
structured exercise program.

The  study  protocol  was  approved  in  October  2019  by 
the  institutional  review  board  of  the  University  Medical 
Center  Utrecht,  the  Netherlands,  and  by  the  local  ethi-
cal review boards of all participating institutions. Written 
informed consent will be obtained from all participants. 
The  study  was  registered  with  Clini calTr ials. gov  on 
October  9,  2019  (NCT04120298).  The  first  patient  was 
included on January 8, 2020.

More  information  about  organizational  aspects  of  the 

trial can be found in Appendix I.

Study population

We  plan  to  include  a  total  of  350  patients  with  mBC, 
both  male  and  female.  Patients  must  meet  the  follow-
ing inclusion criteria: age ≥ 18 years; diagnosis of breast

cancer  stage  IV;  ECOG  (Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology 
Group)  performance  status  ≤  2;  and  able  and  willing 
to  perform  the  exercise  program  and  wear  the  activity 
tracker.  A  patient  who  meets  any  of  the  following  crite-
ria is excluded from participation: unstable bone metas-
tases  inducing  skeletal  fragility;  untreated  symptomatic 
brain  metastasis;  estimated  life  expectancy  <6  months; 
serious  active  infection;  too  physically  active  (i.e.,  >210 
min/week  of  moderate-to-vigorous  exercise)  or  already 
engaging  in  intense  exercise  training  comparable  to  the 
EFFECT  exercise  program;  severe  neurologic  or  cardiac 
impairment according to the American College of Sports 
Medicine (ACSM) criteria [12]; uncontrolled severe res-
piratory  insufficiency  or  being  dependent  on  oxygen 
supplementation in rest or during exercise; uncontrolled 
severe pain; any other contraindications for exercise; any 
circumstances  that  would  impede  adherence  to  study 
requirements or ability to give informed consent; or preg-
nancy. Medical in- and exclusion criteria are checked by 
an involved physician at the treating hospital.

Recruitment and randomization

Participants  are  recruited 
in  Germany  (Heidelberg 
University  Hospital/German  Cancer  Research  Center 
(DKFZ)/National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Hei-
delberg and German Sport University Cologne (DSHS)), 
the  Netherlands  (University  Medical  Center  Utrecht 
(UMCU)  and  the  Netherlands  Cancer  Institute  (NKI)), 
Poland  (Wielkopolskie  Centrum  Onkologii  (WCO)), 
Spain  (Onkologikoa  (ONK)),  Sweden  (Karolinska  Insti-
tutet (KI)), and Australia (Australian Catholic University 
(ACU)).  Some  centers  have  invited  additional  recruit-
ment sites to contribute patients to the study. The study 
procedures  are  summarized  in  Fig.  1.  Potentially  eligi-
ble  patients  are  informed  about  the  study  by  an  oncol-
ogy  nurse  or  medical  specialist  during  a  regular  visit  or 
by mail/letter. In addition, social media (e.g., of national/
local  patient  organizations)  are  used  to  recruit  patients. 
Interested  patients  receive  an 
letter 
explaining the study aims and procedures. After 1 week, 
the patient is approached by telephone to provide further 
information, answer questions and check the (remaining) 
in- and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients who are will-
ing  to  participate  are  invited  to  the  study  center  to  sign 
written informed consent and to undergo baseline meas-
urements.  Patients  who  choose  not  to  participate  in  the 
EFFECT  study  are  asked,  but  not  required,  to  provide  a 
reason for non-participation.

informational 

After  baseline  assessments,  participants  are  randomly 
allocated (1:1) to either the exercise intervention or con-
trol group by central computerized randomization using 
a  blocked  computer-generated  sequence,  effectively 

blinding  randomization.  Randomization  is  stratified  by 
study  center  and  therapy  line  (maximum  of  two  treat-
ments  received  versus  more).  Due  to  the  nature  of 
the  intervention,  blinding  of  participants,  local  study 
nurses, or investigators to intervention assignment is not 
possible.

Exercise intervention

The  9-month  exercise  program  starts  with  a  6-month 
period where patients participate in a supervised, multi-
modal exercise program of 1 h twice a week. Thereafter, 
one  supervised  session  is  replaced  by  one  unsupervised 
session  for  3  months.  Supervision  is  performed  by  an 
exercise  professional  (trainer).  This  can  be  an  exercise 
physiologist or (oncology) physiotherapist who is trained 
by  the  study  team  to  ensure  a  safe  and  standardized 
execution  of  the  exercise  program.  Exercise  sessions  are 
offered  at  community  or  hospital-based  fitness  centers, 
physical  therapy  practices,  gyms  or  personal  training 
facilities  throughout  the  catchment  areas  of  the  recruit-
ing sites and close to the patients’ home address.

Each participant has an intake session in order to indi-
vidualize the standard exercise prescription to their spe-
cific needs. The multimodal exercise program comprises 
aerobic-, resistance- and balance components. In case of 
physical limitations, an adapted exercise program is pro-
vided. Questions of local trainers can be presented to the 
EFFECT  exercise  expert  board  (including  oncologists 
and exercise professionals from all study centers).

If  training  facilities  are  closed  due  to  local  COVID-
19  regulations  or  if  participants  do  not  feel  safe  to  visit 
them, an alternative live-online training program is pro-
vided by the trainer that includes the same components 
as the face-to-face exercise program. If needed, the study 
team  provides  participants  with  the  required  training 
equipment  (e.g.,  resistance  bands  and  free  weights  for 
resistance training; a cycle ergometer or an aerobic step 
for aerobic training). Prior to the start of the live-online 
program, the trainer conducts one individual face-to-face 
exercise  session  in  which  the  exercises,  training  equip-
ment, and training documentation are explained. During 
each  session,  the  trainer  closely  monitors  each  partici-
pant to ensure that all exercises are performed correctly 
and safely.

Balance training

Each exercise session starts with 5 min of balance train-
ing.  The  balance  exercise  component  includes  exercises 
involving  a  variety  of  different  stances  (e.g.,  tandem 
stand)  and  can  be  progressed  by  including  more  chal-
lenging  tasks.  Progression  depends  on  the  subjective 
evaluation of both the trainer and participant.

Fig. 1  Recruitment and study procedures

Aerobic training

The  aerobic  training  consists  of  a  moderate-intensity 
continuous  training  (MICT)  and  progresses  to  high-
intensity  interval  training  (HIIT).  The  aerobic  training 
protocol  is  individualized  based  on  the  patient’s  fitness 
level using the Maximal Short Exercise Capacity (MSEC) 
and  estimated   Wpeak  as  determined  at  baseline,  3  and  6 
months  post-baseline  with  the  Steep  Ramp  Test  (SRT; 

see  Study  Outcomes).  Since  the  prescribed  training  load 
applies  to  the  cycle  ergometer,  at  least  one  training  ses-
sion per week should be performed on a cycle ergometer. 
The other training session can be performed on the row-
ing  machine,  treadmill,  or  elliptical/cross  trainer,  using 
the Borg scale to monitor intensity. For participants with 
bone metastases, aerobic training is preferably performed 
on the cycle ergometer or treadmill.

b Main exercises include the leg press, leg curl, leg extension, chest press, seated row, lat pulldown. Variations of these exercises are allowed and depend on the 
exercise modality

The exercise intensity is gradually increased during the 
exercise  program  (Table  1).  The  perceived  intensity  of 
the aerobic training is assessed using the Borg scale [13]. 
Since  this  is  a  vulnerable  population  and  health  status 
can  deteriorate,  the  load  should  be  decreased  by  10%  if 
the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE; 6-20) is higher than 
15, whereas the load can be increased by 10% if the RPE 
is lower than 13.

Resistance training

Resistance training consists of six exercises targeting the 
major lower and upper body muscle groups. The exercises 
can be delivered using the following modalities: machine-
based, free-weights, or body-weight. All resistance exer-
cises  are  individualized  based  on  the  patient’s  fitness 
level,  which  is  assessed  by  the  trainer  during  the  intake 
session  using  12-repetition  maximum  (12-RM)  muscle 

strength tests. Three sets per exercise are performed and 
the  intensity  is  periodized  (Table  1).  To  ensure  a  suffi-
cient training load throughout the 9-month intervention 
period,  the  weights  are  continuously  adjusted  according 
to  a  progressive  training  protocol  and  in  line  with  the 
periodization  (if  the  participant’s  health  status  permits) 
so  that  the  predefined  maximum  number  of  repetitions 
is  met  as  closely  as  possible.  For  participants  with  bone 
metastases, 12-RM testing is not performed for exercises 
that load regions with bone metastases (Table 2). Accord-
ingly,  adaptations  to  resistance  exercises  are  shown  in 
Table 2.

Unsupervised exercise program

In  addition  to  the  supervised  exercise  program,  partici-
pants  are  encouraged  to  be  physically  active  for  at  least

a Resistance exercises that load the affected region can be either omitted according this table or can be performed using a “start low, go slow” approach, depending 
on patient characteristics and the experience of the involved trainer. According to this approach, participants with bone metastases should start with low weights and 
more repetitions and increase weights gradually over time up to 10-12 repetitions if possible. Higher intensities (i.e., 6–8 repetitions with 80–85% of h1RM) should be 
avoided. Weights will be reduced if participants report pain during a resistance exercise or experience an increase in pain or pain medication since the last exercise

30  min  per  day  on  all  remaining  days  of  the  week.  The 
participants are provided with an activity tracker (i.e., Fit-
bit Inspire HR) and an exercise app specifically designed 
for the EFFECT study.

As  indicated  above,  during  the  last  3  months  of  the 
program, one supervised session is replaced by one unsu-
pervised  session  of  60  min,  supported  by  the  exercise 
app.  The  app  includes  exercises  that  participants  have 
learned during the supervised exercise program and can 
be  performed  at  home  using  body  weight,  free  weights, 
or resistance bands. All exercises are illustrated with sim-
ple  animations  and  contain  clear  instructions.  Partici-
pants receive instructions on the use of the exercise app 
from  the  study  team.  Participants  are  supported  by  the 
trainer to effectively use the exercise app and to success-
fully make the transition to unsupervised exercise.

Control group

Patients randomized to the control group receive stand-
ard medical care. They do not receive a structured exer-
cise intervention as this is not yet part of routine care. In 
line with current physical activity guidelines, the control 
group participants are advised to avoid inactivity and to 
be  as  physically  active  as  their  health  status  allows  [9]. 
They also receive an activity tracker.

Study outcomes

Patients  visit  the  clinical  center  for  measurements  at 
baseline and 3 and 6 months post-baseline. This includes 
assessments  of  physical  fitness,  body  composition,  and 
blood markers (Table 3). For patients undergoing chem-
otherapy,  these  assessments  take  place  at  least  three 
days  after  chemotherapy  infusion.  The  primary  out-
come  assessment  is  at  6  months.  All  questionnaires  are 
completed  at  baseline,  3,  6,  and  9  months  post-baseline 
(Fig.  1).  Socio-demographic  data  are  assessed  at  base-
line  with  a  study-specific  questionnaire.  Medical  data 
are  retrieved  from  the  medical  records.  Personal  data 
are  coded  and  all  data  are  handled  in  compliance  with 
the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR)  (EU) 
2016/679.

Primary outcomes

The primary outcomes of the EFFECT study are cancer-
related physical fatigue and health-related QoL (HRQoL). 
Cancer-related  physical  fatigue  is  measured  using  the 
questionnaire of the European Organization for Research 
and  Treatment  of  Cancer  (EORTC)  that  is  specifically 
developed  and  validated  for  assessing  cancer-related 
fatigue  (EORTC  QLQ-FA12)  [15].  The  EORTC  QLQ-
FA12  is  a  12-item  questionnaire  and  assesses  physical, 
cognitive,  and  emotional  dimensions  of  cancer-related 
fatigue.  Scores  range  from  0  to  100  with  a  higher  score 

indicating  higher  levels  of  fatigue.  HRQoL  is  measured 
using  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  summary  score,  which 
includes  all  original  QLQ-C30  subscales  excluding  the 
global QoL score and financial difficulties score [16, 17]. 
Scores range from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating 
a better HRQoL.

Secondary outcomes
HRQoL, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep problems, 
and pain

Secondary  outcome  measures  comprise  the  EORTC 
QLQ-C30/-BR45  functional  and  symptom  scales  and 
the  other  fatigue  dimensions  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-FA12 
(emotional,  cognitive,  and  total  fatigue  scores).  Anxi-
ety and depression are assessed using the Patient Health 
Questionnaire  for  depression  and  anxiety  (PHQ-4), 
which  consists  of  two  core  anxiety  items  and  two  core 
depression items [18]. Sleep problems are assessed using 
the  Pittsburgh  Sleep  Quality  Index  (PSQI),  which  con-
tains  19  self-reported  items  assessing  subjective  sleep 
quality,  sleep  latency,  sleep  duration,  habitual  sleep  effi-
ciency,  sleep  disturbances,  use  of  sleeping  medication, 
and daytime dysfunction over the past month [19]. Pain 
is  assessed  using  the  Brief  Pain  Inventory  Short  Form 
(BPI-SF)  and  the  Pain  Catastrophizing  Scale  (PCS).  The 
BPI-SF is a validated 11-item questionnaire and measures 
the severity of pain and its impact on daily functioning on 
a  0–10  numeric  scale  with  the  highest  scores  indicating 
worst  pain  and  complete  interference,  respectively  [20]. 
The PCS is a validated 13-item questionnaire designed to 
measure  catastrophic  thinking  related  to  pain  on  a  0–4 
scale with higher scores indicating a higher level of cata-
strophizing  [21].  Neuropathic  pain  is  assessed  using  the 
13-item painDETECT screening questionnaire [22].

Resting heart rate and blood pressure

Resting heart rate and blood pressure are measured prior 
to  the  physical  fitness  and  performance  measurements 
(see Appendix II for details).

Physical fitness and performance

The order of the physical fitness and performance meas-
urements is standardized. First, we assess functional per-
formance and subsequently, MSEC, muscle strength, and 
aerobic capacity.

Functional performance

Originally,  we  planned  to  assess  physical  performance 
using the Short Physical Performance Battery [23]. How-
ever, due to the observation of ceiling effects in our first 
participants,  we  decided  to  replace  this  testing  battery 
with  the  Short  Fullerton  Advanced  Balance  (S-FAB) 
scale  [24]  and  the  5  times  sit-to-stand  test  [23,  25].  The

S-FAB  scale  measures  static  and  dynamic  balance  dur-
ing  four  tasks,  including  the  tandem  walk,  standing  on 
one  leg,  standing  on  foam  with  eyes  closed,  and  step-
ping  up  onto  and  over  a  6-inch  bench.  S-FAB  tasks  are 
rated on 0- (unable to complete task) to 4-point ordinal 
scale  (independent  task  completion)  with  higher  scores 
indicating  better  balance.  The  5  times  sit-to-stand  test 
assesses functional strength of the lower limbs. The time 
(in seconds) required to perform 5 rises from the chair to 
an upright position as fast as possible is measured. This 
test  is  contraindicated  for  patients  with  spinal  or  pelvis 
metastases,  who  are  unable  to  perform  the  test  without 
impact on the spine/pelvis.

Maximal Short Exercise Capacity

MSEC  is  measured  with  the  SRT  using  a  cycle  ergome-
ter  [26].  After  3  min  of  unloaded  cycling,  the  test  starts 
at  25  Watts  and  is  increased  by  2.5  Watts  per  second 
or  25  Watts  per  10  s  until  exhaustion.  Participants  are 
instructed  to  cycle  between  70  and  80  revolutions  per 
minute (RPM). The test ends when cycling cadence drops 
below  60  RPM  or  when  the  participant  experiences  any 
pain  or  anxiety.  After  termination,  the  participant  is 
asked  to  continue  cycling  at  an  easy  cadence  and  with 
minimal  load  to  recover.  The  outcome  is  registered  as 
the  highest  achieved  output  in  Watts  and  is  referred  to 
as MSEC. From the MSEC, peak Wattage  (Wpeak) can be 
estimated using a regression equation [27]. Additionally, 
we record the RPE, time cycled, and heart rate at the end 
of the test as well as 1 and 2 min after termination.

Muscle strength

Upper  body  muscle  strength  is  measured  using  a  hand-
grip  dynamometer  (hydraulic  Jamar®)  with  participants 
seated,  their  elbow  by  their  side  and  flexed  to  the  right 
angle (70°), and a neutral wrist position. Participants are 
asked  to  squeeze  the  dynamometer  as  hard  as  possible. 
Three  measurements  are  performed  on  each  hand  and 
the  best  attempt  of  each  hand  is  recorded.  Lower  body 
muscle  strength  is  assessed  using  a  leg-press  hypotheti-
cal  1-repetition  maximum  (h1-RM)  test  according  to 
a  standardized  protocol  or  an  isokinetic  dynamometer 
(IsoMed  2000®),  unless  the  presence  of  bone  metasta-
ses in the lower body prohibits safe testing. Measures of 
lower body muscle strength may differ between centers, 
but not within centers. For the h1-RM test, we record the 
highest  weight  that  was  successfully  lifted  for  12  repeti-
tions and the corresponding h1-RM [28]. Maximal isoki-
netic peak torque (MIPT) is tested and recorded for each 
leg at 60°/s with the isokinetic dynamometer.

Aerobic capacity

Aerobic  capacity  is  assessed  using  a  constant-load  exer-
cise test to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer. The load is 
determined as 70% of the estimated  Wpeak derived from 
the  SRT  at  baseline.  If  the  SRT  is  terminated  early  and 
there  are  objective  reasons  to  believe  that  a  maximal 
MSEC  was  not  achieved,  80%  of  the  estimated   Wpeak  is 
used as the load to avoid a ceiling effect of the test. Par-
ticipants are instructed to maintain a speed of ~70 RPM. 
The test ends when cycling cadence drops below 60 RPM 
or when the participant experiences any pain or anxiety. 
After  termination,  the  participant  is  asked  to  continue 
cycling  at  an  easy  cadence  and  minimal  load  to  recover. 
The  following  parameters  are  recorded:  time  cycled  in 
minutes, RPE, and heart rate at the end of the test as well 
as 1 and 2 min after termination.

Anthropometry

Anthropometric data (i.e., body weight, height, waist and 
hip  circumference)  are  measured  in  light  clothing  with-
out shoes (see Appendix II for details).

Body composition

Body  composition  (i.e.,  fat  mass  and  fat-free  mass)  is 
measured  prior  to  physical  fitness  testing  by  whole-
body single frequency (50 kHz) bio-electrical impedance 
analysis  (BIA).  Patients  are  measured  in  a  fasted  state 
(no enteral intake for a minimum of 2 h) in a standing or 
lying  position.  Raw  BIA  data  (i.e.,  reactance,  resistance, 
and phase angle) are registered and estimates of fat mass 
and  fat-free  mass  are  obtained  using  the  Kyle  equation 
[29]. BIA devices may differ between centers, but patients 
within each center are measured consistently on the same 
device.

Blood markers

Plasma, serum, buffy coat and peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMC) are derived from whole blood samples 
(30 mL). In the 24 h prior to blood sampling, participants 
are instructed not to exercise vigorously or drink alcohol, 
and in the 2 h prior to blood sampling, they are asked to 
abstain  from  cigarettes,  food,  and  drinks.  Immediately 
after collection, blood samples are centrifuged and stored 
at -80°C at the local laboratory according to standardized 
procedures. Blood samples are transferred to the central 
biobank at the Karolinska Institutet for analysis after the 
last sample has been collected locally.

Physical activity

Disease progression and survival

The  Modified  Version  of  the  Godin-Shephard  Leisure-
Time  Exercise  Questionnaire  and  complementary 
questions  on  types  and  settings  of  exercise  are  used  to 
measure  self-reported  physical  activity  levels  [30,  31]. 
The  Godin  questionnaire  is  a  4-item  questionnaire, 
including  questions  on  the  average  frequency  and  dura-
tion one engages in mild, moderate, and vigorous aerobic 
activities  and  moderate-to-vigorous  resistance  exercises 
in bouts of at least 10 min during leisure time in a typi-
cal  week.  In  addition,  the  Fitbit  Inspire  HR  is  used  to 
objectively  measure  step  count,  heart  rate,  and  physical 
activity  minutes.  Both  intervention  group  and  control 
group participants are asked to wear the activity tracker 
throughout the whole study period, but in any case dur-
ing seven days after randomization and seven days before 
T1 (3 months), T2 (6 months), and T3 (9 months).

Cost‑effectiveness

The EQ-5D-5L is used to measure health in five dimen-
sions, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/
discomfort,  and  anxiety/depression,  using  5  levels  of 
severity [32]. This questionnaire is used to calculate qual-
ity adjusted life years (QALYs) during follow-up.

The  actual  costs  incurred  within  both  study  arms  will 
be  compared  until  nine  months  after  randomization. 
The  cost-effectiveness  analysis  (CEA)  will  be  done  from 
a societal perspective, including healthcare costs, patient 
and family costs, and productivity costs. Participants are 
asked to complete questionnaires on these different types 
of costs. A health care use questionnaire was developed 
before  the  start  of  the  study,  based  on  the  iMTA  Medi-
cal  Cost  Questionnaire  (iMCQ)  [33],  including  cost  cat-
egories that are deemed relevant for patients with mBC. 
Productivity  losses  are  measured  using  the  Productivity 
Cost  Questionnaire  (iPCQ)  [34].  These  questionnaires 
are completed 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline.

Adherence

Adherence  incorporates  both  attendance  at  the  super-
vised  exercise  sessions  and  compliance  with  the  pre-
scribed  exercises  according  to  protocol.  For  each 
scheduled session, the trainer documents attendance and 
compliance  in  a  case  report  form  (see  Appendix  II  for 
details).

Satisfaction

At  3,  6,  and  9  months,  we  assess  satisfaction  with  the 
supervised  exercise  program,  the  exercise  trainer,  the 
activity tracker, and supporting exercise app by means of 
a study-specific questionnaire.

Participants will be followed for disease progression and 
survival  for  5  years  beyond  the  9-month  study  period. 
Information  on  disease  progression  and  (all-cause  and 
breast  cancer  specific)  death  is  retrieved  from  medical 
records and/or the cancer registry.

Add‑on measurements

The  following  measurements  are  completed  at  some 
clinical centers (Table 3): quality of working life, urinary 
incontinence,  cardiopulmonary  exercise  testing,  whole 
body  dual-energy  X-ray  absorptiometry,  isokinetic  and 
isometric peak torque, and muscle thickness. See Appen-
dix II for details.

Safety

All (serious) adverse events ((S)AE) related to exercise or 
study  measurements  are  recorded.  Participants  in  both 
groups  are  asked  by  the  study  personnel  about  exer-
cise- and study measurement-related (S) AEs in a stand-
ardized  manner  during  all  follow-up  visits.  In  addition, 
participants  allocated  to  the  exercise  group  are  asked 
by  their  trainer,  before  and  after  each  supervised  ses-
sion,  whether  any  potentially  exercise-related  (S)  AEs 
occurred  during  or  since  the  last  exercise  session.  The 
trainers are instructed to contact the study team if any (S) 
AE occurred. All (S) AEs are recorded by the study team 
and SAEs are reported to the accredited ethical commit-
tee that approved the protocol, according to the require-
ments of that ethical committee.

Sample size

An  improvement  of  either  or  both  of  the  primary  out-
comes,  i.e.  cancer-related  physical  fatigue  or  HRQoL, 
from baseline to 6 months post-baseline relative to con-
trol  is  of  relevance.  To  adjust  for  multiple  testing,  the 
Bonferroni-Holm method will be used. Based on results 
from 6 randomized exercise trials in patients with breast 
cancer  receiving  adjuvant  treatment,  we  anticipate  an 
effect  size  of  0.35,  which  has  been  found  in  a  pooled 
analysis [35]. With n=139 patients per group (n=278 in 
total), for each endpoint separately a mean standardized 
effect size of at least 0.35 can be detected with an analy-
sis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline values 
of the outcome with a power of at least 78% or 82% at a 
(nominal) two-sided significance level of 2.5%, assuming 
a  correlation  between  pre-  and  post-intervention  levels 
of  Rho=0.3  or  Rho=0.4,  respectively  [36].  However,  the 
probability  of  at  least  one  of  the  two  tests  correspond-
ing  to  the  two  primary  outcomes  to  yield  a  significant 
result,  if  both  alternative  hypotheses  are  true,  is  higher. 
In addition, taking repeated measures into account using 
mixed models might further increase the study power. To 

 Hiensch et al. Trials          (2022) 23:610 

Page 10 of 14

account  for  a  potential  drop-out  rate  of  approximately 
20%,  a  total  number  of  n=350  patients  will  be  enrolled 
into the study (n = 175 per study arm). This sample size 
will  also  facilitate  exploratory  moderator  and  subgroup 
analyses  to  better  understand  which  patients  benefit 
most from the exercise program.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive  statistics  will  be  used  to  characterize  the 
study population at baseline. Questionnaire scores will be 
calculated according to published scoring manuals. Anal-
yses  will  be  performed  according  to  the  intention-to-
treat  principle.  For  the  primary  outcomes,  mixed  linear 
regression  models  will  be  used  to  assess  exercise  effects 
on  physical  fatigue  and  HRQoL  separately,  while  taking 
the hierarchical structure of the data into account. Mod-
els will be adjusted for the baseline value of the outcome 
and stratification factors (i.e., center and therapy line). To 
adjust for multiple testing, the Bonferroni-Holm method 
will be used to maintain an overall alpha level of 5%. The 
same analysis will be performed for secondary outcomes. 
The  detailed  statistical  analysis  plan  is  included  in  the 
IRB study protocol.

In the economic evaluation, the balance between costs 
and effects of both study arms will be assessed and com-
pared up until nine months after randomization. Results 
of  both  cost  and  effect  measurement  will  be  integrated 
using  cost-effectiveness  and  cost-utility  analyses.  In  the 
cost-utility  analysis,  efficiency  is  expressed  in  terms  of 
costs  per  QALY.  In  the  cost-effectiveness  analysis,  costs 
per  unit  of  change  in  the  two  primary  outcome  meas-
ures  will  be  estimated.  Finally,  incremental  costs  and 
incremental  effects,  expressed  in  a  ratio  (ICER)  will  be 
estimated.  A  probabilistic  uncertainty  analysis  using 
bootstrapping will be performed.

To  assess  the  potential  effect  of  exercise  on  progres-
sion-free, overall, and breast cancer-specific survival, we 
will use Cox proportional hazard regression models strat-
ified by center and adjusted for pre-specified prognostic 
factors, including therapy line, type of baseline metasta-
ses, age, and time since diagnosis of first metastases.

Potential  moderators  of  the  exercise  effect  will  be 
explored (e.g., age, baseline fitness level, type of therapy, 
and location of metastases). In addition, mediation analy-
ses  will  be  performed  to  explore  potential  underlying 
mechanisms of exercise effects (e.g., blood markers).

Missing  data  due  to  disease  progression  or  mortal-
ity  will  certainly  occur,  which  could  be  Missing  Not  At 
Random  (MNAR)  if  the  exercise  intervention  also  has 
an effect on progression and survival. To explore poten-
tial  bias,  sensitivity  analyses  according  to  EMA  recom-
mendations  will  be  conducted  using  approaches  that 

investigate  different  MNAR  scenarios  such  as  a  pattern 
mixture model.

Data capturing and monitoring
Castor®,  a  cloud-based  clinical  data  management  plat-
form,  is  used  for  randomization  and  data  capture. 
Castor is also used to send out questionnaires to all par-
ticipants. Validity of the data is checked by an independ-
ent monitor.

Discussion
During  palliative  cancer  treatment,  many  patients  expe-
rience  cancer-  and  treatment-related  side  effects  that 
impair  daily  life  activities  and  negatively  affect  QoL. 
Exercise  during  and  after  curative  cancer  treatment  is  a 
proven strategy to minimize these side effects. Since the 
majority of the available literature is in early stage cancers 
[9],  results  may  not  be  directly  generalizable  to  patients 
with  advanced  cancers  due  to  the  nature  of  the  disease, 
differences  in  treatments,  and  the  higher  risk  of  disease 
progression. In the current trial, we are investigating the 
(cost-)effectiveness  of  a  9-month  exercise  program  in 
mitigating fatigue and maintaining or enhancing QoL in 
patients with mBC.

Due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  were  forced  to 
make  some  (temporary)  changes  to  the  original  study 
protocol  and  offer  live-remote  training.  These  changes 
were  approved  by  the  Medical  Ethics  Committee  of  the 
University Medical Center Utrecht and local ethical com-
mittees  and  are  being  reported  according  to  the  CON-
SERVE-SPIRIT  guidelines  [37].  Furthermore,  the  local 
COVID-19 regulations might result in a delay in recruit-
ment  or  a  cancelation  of  follow-up  visits,  since  patients 
are  not  allowed  or  willing  to  visit  the  study  center  for 
study-related  activities.  All  COVID-19-related  changes 
will  be  reported  alongside  the  primary  results  of  our 
study.

In this study, we decided to include any patient who is 
currently being treated for mBC with at least a 6-month 
life expectancy, independent of the number of treatments 
received.  We  are  aware  that  this  approach  will  result  in 
a  heterogeneous,  but  representative,  group  of  patients. 
Since  the  line  of  treatment  might  affect  our  outcomes, 
we stratify our randomization based on the therapy line 
(maximum  of  two  treatments  received  versus  more). 
Note, we decided to not include patients with oligometa-
static breast cancer who are treated with curative intent

Meta-analyses  of  exercise-oncology  trials  have  sug-
gested  that  supervised  exercise  programs  and  programs 
that  involve  both  aerobic  and  resistance  exercises  are 
most  effective  [38,  39].  In  general,  compliance  with  this 
exercise  prescription  is  reported  to  be  above  80%  [40]. 
For  patients  with  mBC,  we  anticipate  that  adaptations 

Hiensch et al. Trials          (2022) 23:610 

Page 11 of 14

will be required, since we expect patients to present with 
a high disease burden and fluctuating health and perfor-
mance  status.  This  involves  regular  monitoring  of  pain 
and fatigue and will result in personalized adaptation of 
the exercise prescription. In this way, exercise intensities 
can be increased or decreased based on the self-reported 
severity of exertion. We think of such ad-hoc adaptations 
to the pre-planned training schedule as appropriate exer-
cise  prescription  for  this  specific  population,  and  not  as 
evidence of lack of feasibility or poor intervention fidel-
ity.  A  guide  for  selecting  the  appropriate  exercise  inten-
sity  and  volumes  is  provided  to  all  trainers.  To  improve 
gait  stability  and  hence  activities  of  daily  living,  balance 
exercises are included in the program. Balance exercises 
have  also  been  suggested  to  improve  limitations  due  to 
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies [41–44].
The  skeleton  is  the  most  common  site  for  distant 
metastases in breast cancer. In addition, patients can suf-
fer  from  osteoporosis  due  to  treatment  with  aromatase 
inhibitors  [45].  Given  the  expected  increased  risk  of 
skeletal-related  events,  including  pathological  fracture 
and  spinal  cord  compression,  exercise  is  often  underu-
tilized  by  trainers  [46–48].  A  recent  systematic  review 
showed  that  exercise  is  safe  (no  exercise-related  SAEs 
were reported) and feasible for patients with bone metas-
tases  if  it  includes  a  supervised  component  [11].  In  the 
current  study,  all  exercise  sessions  are  supervised  by  a 
trainer specially trained by the study team to ensure safe 
execution  of  the  exercise  program.  Based  on  findings  of 
the aforementioned review [11] and previous research in 
patients with advanced cancer [49], we provide all train-
ers  with  specific  instructions  on  adaptations  that  need 
to be made to the prescribed exercise protocol in case of 
bone  metastases.  Nevertheless,  exercise  in  patients  with 
mBC  remains  challenging  and  additional  adaptations 
to  the  exercise  program  may  be  required. Therefore,  we 
have  created  an  EFFECT  exercise  expert  board  that  will 
respond to questions and request for additional informa-
tion  from  the  trainers.  Additionally,  members  from  all 
recruiting  sites  meet  twice  weekly  to  discuss  exercise-
related questions

In  the  curative  setting,  exercise  programs  from  12 
weeks  or  longer  are  reported  to  be  effective  [9].  In  the 
metastatic  setting,  patients  generally  receive  continuous 
treatment. Therefore, we offer a longer intervention, i.e., a 
6-month exercise program with 2 supervised session per 
week,  followed  by  3  months  with  one  supervised  exer-
cise session replaced by one unsupervised session, which 
will be supported by an activity tracker and exercise app. 
Additionally,  the  trainer  encourages  the  participant  to 
be active in daily life. We hypothesize that the transition 
from  supervised  to  unsupervised  exercise  sessions  will 

help participants to maintain a physically active lifestyle 
beyond the period of study participation.

In  exercise  intervention  studies,  results  might  be 
affected by low compliance to the intervention and con-
tamination  of  the  control  group.  In  order  to  increase 
attendance  and  compliance,  our  exercise  sessions  are 
individualized  and  supervised  by  specially  trained  and 
experienced trainers, and are offered close to the patients’ 
home.  In  addition,  we  closely  monitor  adherence  and 
compliance in the study. Contamination (i.e., adoption of 
something similar to the intervention by the controls) is 
reported  in  37%  of  all  exercise-oncology  trials.  We  took 
recommended measures to decrease the risk of contami-
nation, i.e., we include relatively inactive patients, clearly 
explain  the  randomization  procedure  to  avoid  disap-
pointment when being randomized to the control condi-
tion, and provide general exercise advice and an activity 
tracker to the control group [50]. While controls’ physical 
activity  level  might  be  increased  by  providing  the  activ-
ity  tracker,  it  has  been  shown  that  providing  something 
to the control group decreases the risk of drop-out and of 
contamination  [50].  Patients  who  consent  to  participate 
in  an  exercise  intervention  trial  are  generally  willing  to 
exercise, and activity trackers have been observed to pro-
vide  a  low-level  stimulus  to  engage  in  physical  activity. 
Thus,  the  EFFECT  trial  will  assess  whether  the  exercise 
intervention is significantly better than a simple low-level 
physical activity stimulus.

In  conclusion,  in  the  EFFECT  study,  we  are  investi-
gating  the  effects  of  a  supervised  exercise  program  in 
patients with mBC on physical fatigue and QoL, as well 
as  a  range  of  other  patient-reported,  biomedical  and 
objective  health  outcomes.  If  exercise  during  palliative 
treatment  of  patients  with  mBC  is  proven  to  be  (cost-)
effective, implementing exercise as an integral and stand-
ardized  component  of  palliative  care  would  be  a  logical 
next step. The results of our study can also inform inter-
national guidelines with respect to the role of exercise in 
improving  the  QoL  of  patients  with  advanced  stages  of 
disease  and  reducing  cancer-  and  treatment-related  side 
effects.
