Abstract
The  health  of  refugees  has  been  widely  documented,  as  has  the  impact  of  a  range  of  factors  throughout  the  migration 
journey from being exposed to violence to the impacts of immigration detention. This study adds to our understanding of 
health-related quality of life amongst refugees and asylum seekers by evaluating health-related quality of life as measured 
by the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey using meta-analysis. The aims of this study were to (1) provide a summary 
and overview of health-related quality of life (as measured by the SF-36), including the extent to which this varies and (2) 
explore the factors that influence health-related quality of life (as measured by the SF-36) amongst refugees and asylum 
seekers. A search was undertaken of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO and SCOPUS, returning 3965 results. Papers were 
included  if  they  sampled  refugees  (or  asylum  seeker  or  those  with  refugee-like  experiences)  and  used  the  SF-36  (or  its 
variants)  as  an  outcome  measure.  Mean  scores  and  standard  deviations  were  pooled  using  a  random  effects  model. The 
pooled sample size was 18,418. The pooled mean scores for the SF-36 physical summary measures was 54.99 (95% CI 
46.01–63.99), while the mental health summary measure was 52.39 (95% CI 43.35–61.43). The pooled mean scores for 
each of the sub-scales ranged from 49.6 (vitality) to 65.54 (physical functioning). High heterogeneity was found between 
both summary measures and all sub-scales. In comparison to SF-36 results from general populations in high and middle 
income countries, these results suggest that refugee quality of life is generally poorer. However, this varied substantially 
between studies. One issue that is not well clarified by this review are the factors that contributed to health-related qual-
ity of life.

Introduction

In 2022 there were over 100 million people who were forci-
bly displaced globally [1]. Amongst these were over 40 mil-
lion refugees and asylum seekers, those who have fled their

country and sought (or are seeking, as is the case with asy-
lum seekers) protection in another country because of vio-
lence or persecution. In addition to having to flee their home 
countries, the vast majority of refugees and asylum seekers 
are  subjected  to  significant  hardships.  Violence  and  per-
secution prompt many to flee their home countries. While 
seeking safety, many live in unsafe conditions, most are in 
temporary camps for protracted periods of time. The precar-
ity  of  the  conditions  in  these  camps  has  been  well  docu-
mented, with little food, water and sanitation, with violence 
an  ongoing  threat  [2].  Many  find  themselves  on  perilous 
journeys, by land and sea. The Mediterranean, for example, 
has  seen  over  1.7  million  attempted  crossings  since  2016. 
This has resulted in almost 30,000 people reported dead or 
missing [3]. For those who make it to a country where pro-
tection could be provided, they often face further hardship in 
the form of detention or persecutory immigration policies,

which  leave  many  destitute  and  waiting  years  for  a  deci-
sion on their claims for asylum [4]. Even when asylum is 
granted, many post-migration challenges remain; financial 
strain and/or unemployment, housing difficulties, language 
problems, weak social networks and discrimination.

The  health  of  migrants  and  more  specifically,  refugees 
and asylum seekers has been widely discussed, as has the 
impact  of  the  migration  journey  on  health  and  wellbeing. 
Several meta-analyses now exist that document the impact 
of  the  migration  journey  on  mental  heath.  Together  these 
studies suggest that anxiety, depression and post-traumatic 
stress disorder are far more prevalent amongst refugees and 
asylum seekers in comparison to the general population [5]. 
While there is a growing body of work in this area on mental 
health, health-related quality of life has received relatively 
less attention. Some recent exceptions include a systematic 
review  carried  out  by  Gagliardi,  Brettschneider  [6]  that 
explored  health-related  quality  of  life  as  measured  by  the 
WHOQOL-Bref instrument. While this study did not utilise 
meta-analysis, the authors found that scores were generally 
lower  than  population  norms,  however  also  had  high  het-
erogeneity. Similarly, a systematic review by van der Boor, 
Amos  [7]  examined  the  factors  associated  with  quality  of 
life for asylum seekers and refugees in high-income coun-
tries, finding that quality of life was largely associated with 
social and mental-health related factors.

Given the nature of these populations, the adverse expe-
riences they often face and ongoing challenges in resettle-
ment, the need for further clarity in relation to health-related 
quality  of  life  is  pressing.  This  study  seeks  to  add  to  our 
understanding of health-related quality of life amongst refu-
gees and asylum seekers by evaluating the Short-Form 36 
(SF-36; 8) using meta-analysis.

The aims of this study were to (1) provide a summary and 
overview  of  health-related  quality  of  life  (as  measured  by 
the SF-36), including the extent to which this varies and (2) 
explore the factors that influence overall and specific com-
ponents of quality of life as measured by the SF-36 amongst 
refugees and asylum seekers.

Methods

A systematic review was carried out to identify all relevant 
studies;  those  that  utilised  the  SF-36  (and  its  variants). 
PRISMA guidelines [8] were followed and a study protocol 
was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023465533). The 
search strategy, screening, data extraction and analysis are 
outlined below.

Search Strategy

A search was carried out on 20/09/2023 utilising the follow-
ing databases: PSYCINFO, CINAHL, MEDLINE and SCO-
PUS (which incorporates both MEDLINE and EMBASE). 
Search terms were developed to capture the core concepts, 
related to the population and outcome of interest. The final 
search terms were: refugee OR “asylum seeker” AND “self-
reported  health”  OR  “self  reported  health”  OR  “self-per-
ceived health” OR “subjective health” OR “physical health” 
OR “health status” OR “quality of life” OR QoL OR “short 
form” OR sf-36 OR sf-20 OR sf-12 OR sf-6.We carried out 
a further manual search of references lists of studies found 
to be eligible.

Eligibility Criteria

No  time  or  language  limits  were  placed  on  studies.  Stud-
ies  were  included  if  the  sample  included  refugees  or  asy-
lum  seekers.  We  included  studies  that  self-identified  their 
samples  as  refugees  and  asylum  seekers.  Where  studies 
included  a  mixed  sample  (for  example  migrants  and  refu-
gees) we included these studies if the majority came from 
refugee/asylum seeker backgrounds or data specific to the 
refugees  or  asylum  seekers  could  be  extracted.  We  also 
included studies where samples were likely to have had ref-
ugee-like  experiences.  For  example,  a  sample  of  migrants 
who  had  escaped  political  persecution  would  be  included 
even if the study did not explicitly identify them as refugees 
or asylum seekers. We included studies that sampled refu-
gees and asylum seekers in all settings, this included those 
in transit, those who had resettled and those in clinical (i.e., 
hospital or medical) settings.

Studies were included if they used the SF-36 (or any of its 
variants) as an outcomes measure. The SF-36 is a self-report 
measure of health and wellbeing and was designed to give an 
overall picture of general health status. For ease and unless 
specified, we will refer to all variations of this questionnaire 
(see  below)  as  the  SF-36.  The  SF-36  has  been  translated 
into more than 40 languages and used in thousands of stud-
ies with a range of general and clinical groups. The SF-36 
consists  of  two  summary  measures  –  physical  and  mental 
health and eight scales: physical functioning (10 items), a 
scale  which  includes  questions  related  to  everyday  physi-
cal activities; role-physical (4 items), a scale which includes 
questions related to the physical demands of work and other 
daily activities; bodily pain (2 items), a scale that explores 
pain and the extent to which it interferes with daily activi-
ties; general health (5 items), a scale which explore general 
perceptions of health and future health outlook; vitality (4 
items), a scale exoring levels of energy and fatigue; social 
functioning (2 items), a scale measuring social functioning; 

Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health (2024) 26:925–9351 3role-emotional  (3  items),  a  scale  exploring  the  extent  to 
which  emotional  problems  interfere  with  work  and  daily 
activities and mental health (5 items), a measure of overall 
psychological wellbeing. Scales are standardised and scored 
from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health.

There are several variations of the SF-36, including the 
SF-8 [9], SF-12 [10] (which only include the physical and 
mental  health  summary  measures)  and  the  SF-20  (which 
only includes the six of the above scales) [11]. In addition 
to there being several versions that differ in length, there is 
a  RAND  [12]  and  Medical  Outcomes  Study  [13]  version, 
each of which contain the same items, but are scored slightly 
differently. We opted to include all versions of the SF-36 as 
generally  different  versions  have  been  found  to  be  highly 
correlated [14]. We also planned to explore the impact that 
the  choice  of  instrument  had  on  scores  in  our  sensitivity 
analysis  (see  below).  Studies  had  to  contain  extractable 
data for at least one of the sub-scales or summary measures. 
Only cross-sectional studies were included.

Screening and data Extraction

Screening  was  undertaken  in  two  phases.  A  first  screen 
was  carried  out  by  RE  examining  the  titles  and  abstracts 
of articles. A second full text screen was carried out by RE 
and EK. Each paper was screened independently, by at least 
two  authors.  Disagreements  were  resolved  with  a  discus-
sion  with  the  team.  RE,  EK  and  MM  contributed  to  data 
extraction. Data was extracted independently by at least two 
authors, except on the two papers which were in German, 
where  MM  carried  out  the  data  extraction.  SF-36  scores, 
along  with  demographic  and  study  characteristics  were 
extracted,  including  the  sample  size,  country  where  the 
study  took  place,  the  type  of  outcomes  measure  used,  the 
mean age of the sample, whether the sample came from the 
general population or was clinical and whether the sample 
was residing in camps or an urban setting.

Quality Appraisal

We  opted  to  use  the  JBI’s  critical  appraisal  tool  for  cross 
sectional  studies  (https://jbi.global/critical-appraisal-tools). 
Each study was independently rated by at least two authors. 
Disagreements were resolved with a discussion to reach a 
final, collated score.

Publication bias

Potential  publication  bias  was  explored  utilising  funnel 
plots (visualising effect sizes against SEs), where asymme-
try  can  indicate  possible  bias,  and  with  Egger’s  test  with 
p < .10 indicating possible publication bias.

Data Transformation and Analysis

While a number of studies were excluded because no data 
could  be  extracted,  where  possible  data  was  transformed. 
This generally involved converting standard errors and con-
fidence intervals. To do this we used the Cochrane RevMan 
calculator  [15].  For  a  small  number  of  studies  we  either 
pooled  means  and  standard  deviations  (where  two  groups 
were compared for example) or extracted data for only one 
group in the study in question. The specific details for each 
study where this was done will be provided below.

Meta-analysis  was  used  to  systematically  synthesize 
the findings of the studies retrieved from the search. Mean 
scores and standard deviations were pooled using a random 
effects model with tests for heterogeneity (see below). The 
meta package [16] in R [17] was used to carry out this anal-
ysis. Plots were created using ggplot [18].

Analysis of sub-groups

While we had planned to carry out a formal analysis of sub-
groups, we opted not to do this for a range of reasons which 
are  outlined  below  (see  results).  Instead  we  carried  out  a 
more informal exploration of the data, to help in identify-
ing  patterns  in  the  data  and  any  study  characteristics  that 
appeared to influence this.

Heterogeneity

The existence of heterogeneity was explored with Cochran’s 
Q statistic (where p < .05 indicates heterogeneity is present). 
The magnitude of the variation in effect sizes across stud-
ies with Higgin’s I2 statistic was also utilised. This statis-
tic estimates the proportion of variance in effect sizes due 
to true heterogeneity (from 0 to 100%), with higher values 
representing greater inconsistency in effect size across stud-
ies. Finally, we also report τ as a measure of heterogeneity 
for each comparison, which gives the SD of the effect size 
estimates.

Sensitivity Analysis

We also performed sensitivity analysis to assess how robust 
our findings were. We planned to removed outliers, that is, 
studies  with  unusually  high  or  low  SF-36  scores  on  any 
of  the  subscales  or  summary  measures  and  studies  which 
scored relatively low on the JBI quality appraisal instrument 
in question, for our purposes this meant not meeting at least 
70%  of  the  criteria  on  any  given  instrument.  The  results 
of this and the above search and analysis will be reported 
below.

Patient and Public Involvement

Patients  and  the  public  were  not  involved  in  the  develop-
ment of this manuscript.

Results

The  search  returned  3965  results.  Results  were  imported 
into Rayyan [19] where duplicates were removed, leaving 
2557  papers. A  title  and  abstract  screen  left  61  articles,  a 
full text screen was then carried out. A further 11 papers that 
were found in reference lists of included papers, which were 
also screened. After screening, 20 papers met the inclusion 
criteria  [20–39].  The  search  results  are  summarised  in  a 
PRISMA diagram (Fig. 1).

The  20  studies  included  reported  data  from  over  two 
decades (1999–2023) and were carried out in Croatia [28], 
Germany [20, 21, 25], Greece [22, 23], Jordan [37], Kosovo 
[35,  36],  Malaysia  [34],  Netherlands  [30],  South  Sudan 
[38], Switzerland [32], Thailand [33], Uganda [39] and the 
US  [24,  26,  27,  29,  31].  Studies  were  also  categorised  as 
high income countries (n = 13) and low and middle income 
countries  (n = 7).  Studies  used  the  SF-36  (n = 11),  SF-12 
(n = 6), SF-8 (n = 2), SF-20 (n = 1). Two studies utilised the 
RAND version of the SF-36/12 [32, 37] while the remainder 
used the Medical Outcomes Study version(s). The majority 
of  studies  had  either  samples  of  refugees  (n = 17),  mixed 
samples (n = 2), while the remaining study had a sample of 

internally displaced people. Fourteen studies included out-
comes from samples who lived in ‘urban’ environments, five 
who lived in ‘camps’ and one which included a mixed sam-
ple. The total sample size of these studies was 18,418. Not 
all studies reported individual component scores. The most 
commonly reported measures were the mental and physical 
health summary measures (n = 11 and n = 11 respectively).

For two studies with multiple assessments, pooled mean 
and standard deviations were used [20, 26]. Data was also 
selectively extracted from another three where we felt that 
data  could  not  be  pooled  (as  the  groups  being  compared 
were too different). For the study carried out by Eisenman, 
Gelberg [24] we only extracted data for the group who expe-
rienced political violence (as opposed to the group who did 
not),  for  the  study  carried  out  by  Eytan, Toscani  [41],  we 
extracted data from the group who had not been diagnosed 
with post-traumatic stress disorder (as opposed to those who 
were diagnosed) and for the study carried out by Wangmo 
[32] we extracted data for those who had resettled in Swit-
zerland (as opposed to those resettled in India).

SF-36 sub Scales

The  pooled  mean  scores  for  each  of  the  SF-36  subscales 
was  calculated.  Subscales  ranged  from  49.60  (vitality)  to 
65.54 (physical functioning). All subscales had significant 
(Q) and substantial (I2, τ2) heterogeneity. These results are 
summarised in Table 1, with forest plots included as supple-
mentary material.

SF-36 Physical and Mental Health Summary 
Measures

substantial  heterogeneity 

The pooled mean score for the physical summary measure 
was 54.99 (95% CI 46.01–63.99). Mean scores of individual 
studies ranged from 42.4 to 76.8. Significant (Q = 2179.44, 
(I2 = 99.5%, 
p < .001)  and 
τ2 = 171.29) were observed, meaning study means and stan-
dard  deviations  varied  significantly  between  the  studies. 
Results  are  summarised  in  Fig.  2. The  pooled  mean  score 
for the mental summary measure was 52.39 (95% CI 43.35–
61.43). Mean scores of individual studies ranged from 47.75 
to 83.6. Significant (Q = 3174.56, p < .001) and substantial 
heterogeneity  (I2 = 99.7%,  τ2 = 175.78)  were  observed, 
meaning  study  means  and  standard  deviations  varied  sig-
nificantly  between  the  studies.  Results  are  summarised  in 
Fig. 3.

Sensitivity Analysis

A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  for  each  scale  and 
summary measure with outliers removed. Notably scores in 

studies by Hinton, Sinclair [26] and Wangmo [32] were sub-
stantially lower and higher (respectively) than those reported 
elsewhere.  Also  excluded  were  studies  above  where  data 
was  transformed  or  where  data  was  selectively  extracted 
and  those  which  scored  below  70%  on  quality  appraisal 
instruments. While pooled mean scores shifted slightly with 
these studies removed, this has little impact on the overall 
results, with scores still highly heterogeneous. We opted to 
retain these studies and offer some reflections below on why 
scores were substantially different in these studies.

Sub-group Analysis

While we had planned to run sub-group analyses we opted 
not to do this prior to undertaking analysis. While 20 studies 
were included in this meta-analysis, not all reported scores 
for  each  scale  and  summary  measure. As  noted  above  the 
most reported scales were the mental (n = 11) and physical 
(n = 11)  summary  measures.  When  looking  at  the  studies 
that reported each of these summary measures, they varied 
substantially  and  often  we  were  left  with  only  one  study 
that offered a comparison (for example, only one study was

930

Fig. 3  Forest plot of SF-36 mental functioning summary measure

conducted in a clinical (hospital) setting that used both the 
physical and mental summary measures). Because of this, 
we  did  not  carry  out  formal  sub-group  analysis.  We  did 
however  speculatively  explore  the  remainder  of  the  stud-
ies  to  see  if  patterns  in  the  data  existed. These  results  are 
summarised in Fig. 4. which plots physical and mental sum-
mary scores and age, with each colour representing different 
sample characteristics. There appears to be no obvious rela-
tionship  between  summary  scores  and  age,  however  there 
are notably at least three studies that appear to be outliers on 
both scales. One of these studies had a sample much older 
than the majority of the other studies, while all studies had 
samples of refugees and came from general (as opposed to 
clinical) populations.  Notably,  some  studies  also  appeared 
to have very different scores based on study characteristics. 
For example, two studies carried out in high income coun-
tries  had  at  least  two  outliers,  with  two  studies  with  sub-
stantially higher physical and mental summary scores than 
others, while the two studies carried out in refugee camps 
had  vastly  different  physical  summary  scores. These  find-
ings will be discussed below in light of the broader literature.

Study Quality and Publication bias

To assess the quality of the studies included in this review, 
the JBI instrument for cross sectional studies was used. The 
results  and  rating  for  each  study  are  included  in  supple-
mentary material (Table S1). Generally studies scored well, 
however  one  persistent  issues  across  a  number  of  studies 
related  to  the  scoring  of  the  SF-36,  where  in  many  cases 
this was not reported with adequate transparency. Only one 
study failed to meet 70% of the criteria put forth in the tool 
[26]. No evidence of potential publication bias was found, 

based on the funnel plots (Appendix Figures S9 and 10) and 
a nonsignificant Eggers test (p = .11) for the physical sum-
mary and (p = .80) for the mental summary scales.

Discussion

This study provides insight into health-related quality of life 
of refugees and asylum seekers by examining SF-36 scores 
amongst 18,418 refugees and asylum seekers. Mean scores 
for the physical and mental summary scales were 54.99 and 
52.39  respectively.  Sub  scales  ranged  from  49.60  (vital-
ity)  to  65.54  (physical  functioning).  Scores  between  stud-
ies were highly heterogenous on all summary measures and 
sub-scales, meaning scores varied substantially.

Beyond  the  differences  between  studies  included  here, 
one advantage of utilising SF-36 scores to explore HRQoL 
is that it allows for comparisons between different popula-
tions. To offer a point of comparison we explored five further 
studies that employed large general samples from Germany 
[42], Canada [43], Norway [44], New Zealand [45] and Tur-
key [46] and compared these with the pooled mean scores 
found in this study. These results are summarised in Fig. 5. 
This comparison, that on all scales, the pooled mean scores 
in this study were lower, except for the physical and mental 
summary measures where mean scores appear comparable. 
This suggests that generally, refugees and asylum seekers to 
have lower SF-36 scores than those in the general popula-
tion in a number of high and middle income countries.

While we did not opt to carry out formal sub-group anal-
ysis it is worth reflecting on some of the outliers we iden-
tified  in  the  above  scores,  along  with  what  insights  these 
might  provide  given  the  existing  literature.  The  study  by

Wangmo  [47]  is  notable  in  that  it  sampled  a  group  much 
older than what was found in other studies. This study exam-
ined SF-36 scores amongst elderly Tibetans settled in both 
Switzerland  and  India.  When  extracting  data  we  opted  to 
only extract data from those resettled in Switzerland as the 
scores between the groups varied substantially, with those 
in India having much lower physical and mental summary 
scores. This study begins to provide some insight into why 
the group resettled in Switzerland had far higher scores, and 
arguably sheds light on some of the variability seen between 
many of the studies above. One important factor this study 
identified was the benefits and support provided in Switzer-
land, compared to India, such as social security and health-
care. The reasons why the other studies that were outliers 
on the physical [28] and mental summary scores [34] were 
not immediately apparent. Mollica [28] examined physical 
summary  scores  amongst  Bosnian  refugees  in  a  camp  in 
Croatia, while Daher [34] examined mental summary scores 
amongst  Iraqi  refugees  resettled  in  Malaysia,  this  study 

noted  that  the  sample  was  relatively  young,  with  the  vast 
majority aged between 18 and 29 years old having travelled 
to Malaysia to both study and escape the political instability 
in Iraq; this may at least partially explain why scores were 
higher  on  this  measure  for  this  group.  One  final  study  by 
Hinton, Sinclair [26] where scores were also outliers, exam-
ined refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia, resettled in the 
US with psychiatric diagnoses, in line with the broader lit-
erature (see below) this may explain why scores were much 
lower for this group.

Together  these  results  suggest  that  refugee  quality  of 
life  is  generally  poorer  than  that  of  the  general  popula-
tion  in  a  number  of  host  countries.  What  is  also  apparent 
is  that  this  can  vary  quite  substantially.  One  issue  that  is 
not well clarified by this review were the factors that deter-
mined  health-related  quality  of  life. While  we  did  not  opt 
to  carry  out  formal  sub-groups  analysis,  we  also  did  not 
find  any  apparent  patterns  in  our  data  that  would  suggest 
study  or  sample  characteristics  being  predictive  of  SF-36

scores. Looking at the broader literature however, there are 
several  potential  explanations. These  include  the  diversity 
of  the  samples,  that  is,  refugees  and  asylum  seekers  have 
vastly different experiences, come from a variety of back-
grounds and are exposed to vastly different potentially trau-
matic experiences. In resettlement, a range of different and 
varying  challenges  are  faced  dependent  on  the  country  of 
resettlement. This is reflected in the broader literature that 
has explored the factors that impact quality of life amongst 
refugees and also perhaps explain some of the heterogeneity 
in this study. In a systematic review that examined 23 papers 
that explored the factors that were associated with refugee 
quality of life, van der Boor, Amos [7] found that the most 
salient factors when it came to quality of life were related to 
social integration and “having established social networks”. 
Having a mental health disorder was the most salient factor 
when it came to reductions in quality of life. When it comes 
to mental health, several factors, such as isolation have been 
found  to  predictive  of  worse  mental  health  [48].  Studies 
have  also  found  a  significant  relationship  between  factors 
related to host countries’ refugee policy, whether people are 
detained and the process by which they can apply for pro-
tection and their wellbeing [49]. In practical terms, with the 
results  of  this  study  and  the  broader  literature,  this  means 
that in resettlement, while quality of life is generally poorer 
for refugees, this is not always the case and the factors that 
may contribute to this are numerous. This study also high-
lights  the  difference  between  difference  elements  of  well-
being, for example emotional and physical wellbeing, with 
subs-scale  scores  varying  substantially  between  studies. 
These results and the broader literature highlight the need 
for a comprehensive and individualised exploration of qual-
ity  of  life  amongst  refugees  who  are  resettled  taking  into 
account the range of individual, social, culture and political 
factors that may influence this.

There are at least two notable limitations worth mention-
ing  in  relation  to  this  study.  First,  it  was  not  always  clear 
how  studies  scored  the  SF-36  and  in  particular  how  they 
calculated physical and metal summary scores. This was not 
always  detailed  in  papers  and  often  studies  only  included 
summary  scores  (and  not  the  scores  of  each  of  the  sub-
scales). While these studies may have been scored correctly, 
there  was  often  a  lack  of  detail  about  how  this  was  done. 
This may explain why the sub scale scores here are lower 
than most published studies, while the physical and mental 
summary scores are comparable. There is a need for future 
studies to offer greater transparency around the scoring of 
these  instruments.  Second,  and  following  from  what  was 
said above, we opted to include a relatively broad sample 
of  refugees  and  asylum  seekers  in  this  study,  all  who  had 
vastly  different  experiences,  through  fleeing  their  country 
of  origin  to  their  experiences  in  resettlement,  all  having

vastly  different  impacts  on  quality  of  life.  Future  meta-
analyses that examine the quality of life of refugees should 
consider  whether  it  may  be  of  benefit  to  examine  quality 
of  life  amongst  a  more  focused  sample  because  of  these 
differences.

This paper adds to discussions in relation to refugee health 
and in particular refugee health related quality of life. These 
findings suggest that while refugee health-related quality of 
life  is  generally  poorer  than  that  found  in  the  majority  of 
countries,  when  compared  to  the  general  population,  this 
can  vary  substantially.  Future  research  is  needed  to  more 
systematically explore the factors that influence quality of 
life in these populations.
