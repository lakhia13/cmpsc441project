Abstract

This article reviews research on the development of motor behavior from a developmental systems 
perspective. We focus on infancy when basic action systems are acquired. Posture provides a 
stable base for locomotion, manual actions, and facial actions. Experience facilitates 
improvements in motor behavior and infants accumulate immense amounts of experience with all 
of their basic action systems. At every point in development, perception guides motor behavior by 
providing feedback about the results of just prior movements and information about what to do 
next. Reciprocally, the development of motor behavior provides fodder for perception. More 
generally, motor development brings about new opportunities for acquiring knowledge about the 
world, and burgeoning motor skills can instigate cascades of developmental changes in perceptual, 
cognitive, and social domains.

Introduction

Motor behavior includes every kind of movement from involuntary twitches to goal-directed 
actions, in every part of the body from head to toe, in every physical and social context from 
solitary play to group interactions. The development of motor behavior bridges the entire 
lifespan from the first fetal movement to the last dying breath.

Although movements fundamentally depend on generating, controlling, and exploiting 
physical forces, managing forces requires more than muscles and biomechanics. At every 
point in development, adaptive control of movement relies on core psychological 
functions1, 2. Perception and cognition are required to plan and guide actions3. Social and 
cultural factors spur and constrain motor behaviors4. Motor behaviors, in turn, provide the 
raw material for perception, cognition, and social interaction5, 6. Movements generate 
perceptual information, provide the means for acquiring knowledge about the world, and 
make social interactions possible.

According to a developmental systems view, motor behaviors cannot be understood in 
isolation, divorced from the bodily, environmental, and social/cultural context in which they 
occur7. Movements are inextricably nested in a body-environment system. The body and the

environment develop in tandem. New or improved motor skills bring new parts of the 
environment into play and thereby provide new or enhanced opportunities for learning and 
doing. Caregiving practices facilitate and constrain motor development. As a consequence, 
differences in the way caregivers structure the environment and interact with their children 
affect the form of new skills, the ages when they first appear, and the shape of their 
developmental trajectory.

New motor behaviors can emerge from a mix of interacting factors, some so pervasive that 
we mistakenly take them for granted, and some so subtle or non-obvious that we fail to 
recognize the link. Developmental changes in one domain can have cascading effects on 
development in other domains, sometimes far afield from the original accomplishment8, 9. 
Moreover, the context in which behavior develops can be very different for individual 
children, resulting in developmental pathways that sometimes converge at the same outcome 
and sometimes veer off in unique directions.

This article is organized around four basic action systems—posture, locomotion, manual 
actions, and movements in the face and head. We focus primarily on the infancy period, 
when basic action systems are acquired.

Posture is the most fundamental of motor actions. It is the foundation upon which other 
actions are built10. The instant that any part of the body breaks from the support surface—
merely raising an arm while supine or lifting the head while prone—torque acting on the 
body part creates disequilibrium. This is why novice sitting and standing infants lose balance 
just from turning their heads or lifting their arms. Posture must be sufficiently stable to allow 
movements of the extremities, and maintaining a stable posture sets up the necessary 
conditions for looking around, handling objects, holding conversations, or going somewhere. 
As such, the emergence of most skills—including those not obviously related to posture—
must await the development of sufficient postural control. Like every action, posture is 
perceptually guided and maintained.

Posture

Overcoming Gravity

Gravity and the surrounding media (e.g., air, water, the ground beneath the feet) are so 
quietly pervasive, so hidden in plain sight, that these important factors are often overlooked 
as causal forces in development. But they are central for motor development. Before birth, 
the buoyant uterine environment supports a variety of postures. Large body movements—
whole body flexion and extension, stretching and writhing, and vigorous leg kicks that 
somersault the fetus through the amniotic fluid—peak at 14 to 16 weeks gestation11, 12. As 
the growing fetus occupies increasingly more space in the uterus, the propensity for 
movement is masked until the fetus can no longer extend its limbs or turn its head. Many of 
the movements practiced by the fetus are present in the repertoire of the neonate12, but after 
birth begins the real struggle against gravity.

Postural development is the attainment of increasingly erect postures poised over an 
increasingly small base of support. Think of a newborn struggling to lift its head, a toddler’s

wide walking stance, and an older child dancing on pointe. Indeed, the most common 
images of motor development are milestone charts of postural development (Figure 1). The 
milestone charts suggest an orderly, age-related march through a series of stages, but 
developmental pathways can differ and individual infants do not strictly adhere to the 
normative sequence derived from average onset ages. Infants can acquire skills in various 
orders, skip stages, and revert to earlier forms13–15. Moreover, the skills highlighted on the 
milestone charts reflect the cultural biases of the initial researchers and samples4. In some 
cultures, for example, many infants do not crawl, or they do so after they learn to walk16.

Generally speaking, infants’ gradual triumph over gravity precedes top down from head to 
feet. The top down progression is especially striking in the development of sitting. At first, 
head and trunk control is so poor that unsupported infants fold in half, falling chest to legs. 
Increasing control moves slowly down the spine—neck, shoulders, waist, hips17, 18. Infants 
eventually “tripod sit” by stabilizing their torso with arms propped between their 
outstretched legs. Finally, around 6 months of age, infants sit independently with hands freed 
from a supporting role19, and over the ensuing weeks gain sufficient stability to manage the 
destabilizing forces caused by turning the head, twisting the torso, and moving the arms. The 
skill progression is not locked to a strict maturational timetable. Differences in childrearing 
practices affect the timing and trajectory of sitting4, 20. In cultures where caregivers 
routinely exercise and massage their infants, the babies sit independently before 5 months of 
age, and they do so with such assured stability that their mothers regularly perch them on 
high furniture and leave the room to do chores.

Like sitting, standing typically begins with manual support of balance. Infants pull to stand 
and hold themselves upright by gripping furniture for support15. Toward the end of the first 
year, they stand freely and cruise holding furniture for support19. Locomotion in prone, 
sitting, crawling, and upright postures appears only after infants can keep balance in one 
place, and transitions between postures (shifting from prone to sitting, sitting to standing, 
and so on) typically emerge last.

Basis for Action

A stable postural base opens up new possibilities for acquiring knowledge and acting on the 
world. The ability to maintain head position while held in caregivers’ arms allows infants to 
look around21 and maintain gaze with caregivers22. The ability to sit and stand upright 
provides new vantage points for visual exploration23. Stability in a sitting posture frees the 
arms for reaching and the hands for manual exploration17, 24–26.

Indeed, reaching and manual exploration have different developmental trajectories for prone, 
supine, and sitting postures25, 27. While prone, bimanual exploration is difficult because one 
arm is occupied in holding the chest off the floor. While supine, infants struggle to raise 
objects against gravity and have difficulty exploring them visually. But while sitting, more 
sophisticated bimanual object exploration is possible because head, arms, and hands are 
more free to move.

Developmental changes in postural control instigate a cascade of far-flung changes: 
Independent sitting facilitates more sophisticated bimanual object exploration such as

fingering, transferring, and rotating, which in turn facilitate learning about the three-
dimensionality of objects28. Improvements in manual skills are also linked with shifts in 
infants’ attention to changes in object appearance29, object size30, multimodal information 
about objects31, and other people’s intentions to grasp objects32, 33. The path from posture to 
prehension to perceptual learning is not immediately obvious, but it is there nonetheless.

Dynamic Postural Control

Movement is ubiquitous in every posture. Even while lying down, the body is in motion. 
Similarly, sitting, crawling, and standing postures may appear stationary to casual 
observation, but they are not. Rather, the body gently sways back and forth within the base 
of support18, 34. A torque-induced sway in one direction must be met by a muscle-induced 
compensatory sway in the opposite direction. Standing infants are sensitive to perceptual 
information for body sway and can control swaying movements with merely a light touch of 
the hand on a support surface35, 36.

Visual information for body sway is extremely powerful. Slight movement of the walls 
around a sitting or standing infant in a “moving room” creates the illusion of postural sway 
(Figure 2), and infants compensate for the visual information for body position by leaning in 
the opposite direction37–39. However, infants do not use visual information for postural 
control as efficiently as older children and adults. Whereas adults rock gently back and forth 
like puppets in tune with the wall oscillations, infants’ compensatory sways are excessive 
and they often stagger and fall.

Summary: Posture

Posture is the core ingredient of motor skill. With no postural control, most motor behaviors 
are impossible. The development of postural control instigates a cascade of new skills and 
opens up new possibilities for looking, social interactions, manual actions, and locomotion. 
Postural development is partly a perceptual accomplishment because even while sitting and 
standing, the body is always slightly swaying and perception plays a key role in keeping the 
body inside the base of support. Postural control emerges from the interaction of a growing 
body dealing with the constraints of the physical environment—gravity, air, the properties of 
the support surface, and so on. Caregiving practices can speed up or delay postural control 
and the cascade of new skills that follow.

Locomotion

Precursory locomotor movements are exhibited during fetal and neonatal periods, but 
locomotion is not reflexive or hardwired. Rather, locomotion is creative and infants must 
learn to control locomotion adaptively. Locomotion improves with practice, and practice can 
lead to extraordinary performance4, 7, 40.

Newborn Reflexes

When newborns are held upright with their feet on a hard surface, they move their legs in an 
alternating pattern that resembles walking. This phenomenon is called the “newborn 
stepping reflex” because the movements appear to be elicited by contact with the ground

surface and do not require cortical control41. Stepping typically disappears by 2 months of 
age and reappears at 8–10 months when infants begin walking with support. The fact that 
newborns produce alternating, upright leg movements led researchers to believe that walking 
is hardwired in the nervous system42–44. Similarly, the curious disappearance and 
reappearance of stepping was attributed to a hardwired developmental mechanism: Cortical 
maturation inhibits the reflex and increased myelination of the corticospinal tract allows 
stepping to return under volitional control.

However, the so-called stepping reflex is not, in fact, reflexive, and alternating leg 
movements do not, in fact, disappear. Newborns “air-step” without an eliciting physical 
stimulus and they step in response to optic flow45, 46. Infants can deliberately modify their 
leg movements47 in various configurations of alternating, simultaneous, and single-leg 
kicks48, 49. They spontaneously kick their legs while supine50 and supine leg kicks are 
kinematically equivalent to upright steps, and are produced by the same muscle 
activations50. Moreover, supine kicking continues unabated throughout the period when 
upright stepping disappears51, and upright steps instantly reappear when infants are held on 
a motorized treadmill52, 53 or when their legs are submerged in a tank of water54. With daily 
practice in an upright posture, the stepping movements never disappear55, 56. Changes in the 
body, not the brain, explain the U-shaped trajectory of upright stepping: Between 2–8 
months of age, gains in leg fat typically outstrip gains in muscle54. In an upright position, 
infants cannot lift their chubby legs against gravity, but in a supine position gravity helps to 
flex the legs; on a treadmill, the moving belt does the work of pulling infants’ legs backward 
and in a tank of water, the medium alleviates the effects of gravity. Upright practice makes 
leg muscles stronger.

Creative Solutions

Individual infants find different ways to solve the problem of moving. Their first success at 
mobility likely involves a prone position with minimal balance constraints. They may log 
roll from place to place or pivot in circles using auditory information to calculate the shortest 
rotational distance to their caregivers57. As shown in Figure 3, some infants belly crawl, 
using limbs, head, and belly in various combinations for support and propulsion58, 59. The 
belly rests continually on the floor or bumps up and down during each cycle. Every form of 
precursory prone movement helps: Infants who pivot, belly crawl, and so on are twice as 
proficient when they begin crawling on hands and knees compared with infants who don't 
display the earlier forms58. In fact, simply spending a few minutes a day in a prone position 
accelerates the onset of rolling and crawling60.

On hands and knees, balance constraints increase because the belly is off the floor. As a 
consequence, most infants quickly settle into a relatively stable, near-trot gait pattern58, 61. 
But they also crawl on hands and feet, and combine hands, knees, feet, and buttocks into 
various forms of hitching and bum-shuffling positions that blur the line between sitting and 
crawling40. Balance constraints are more severe while upright, but learning to walk is 
likewise an exercise in creative problem solving with various falling, twisting, and stepping 
strategies for inducing enough disequilbrium to take steps but not so much loss of stability to 
cause a fall43, 62, 63.

Generating new forms of locomotion can involve cognitive skills such as means-ends 
problem solving, representing goals and spatial locations, and tool use. As illustrated in 
Figure 4, when confronted with challenging obstacles such as steep slopes, cliffs, and stairs, 
infants search for alternative means of descent—scooting, crawling, sliding, and backing 
strategies64–66. Backing is most difficult because it requires infants to initially turn away 
from the goal, coordinate backward movements, and steer without visual guidance. On 
narrow bridges, infants use a sturdy wooden handrail as a tool to augment their balance, but 
they reject the handrail if it is too far from the bridge67–69. With only a wobbly rubber 
handrail for support, they test the potential utility of the rail, and invent various strategies for 
distributing body weight over the bridge and handrail (Figure 4).

Learning to Walk

Infants take their first walking steps at 12 months, on average19, but like all motor 
milestones, onset ages have a wide range (8–18 months). Walking onset awaits sufficient 
strength and balance to support the body on one leg as the other leg swings forward43, 70, 71. 
Both experimental and cross-cultural studies show that experience standing, stepping, and 
moving upright facilitates gains in strength and balance and accelerates the onset of 
walking4, 7, 40. A few minutes of daily practice with upright stepping causes infants to begin 
walking weeks earlier than infants who receive only passive exercise55, 56. Similarly, in 
Caribbean and African cultures where parents deliberately exercise their infants’ upright 
skills as part of daily massage and bathing routines (Figure 5), infants walk sooner than 
those from the same ethnic backgrounds who do not receive practice16.

Infants’ first steps are wobbly and uneven, with a wide side-to-side distance between feet, a 
small front-to-back distance between steps, long periods when both feet are on the floor, and 
short periods when one foot is in the air72, 73. But soon the base of support narrows, step 
length increases, double support periods decrease, and infants are racing across the floor. 
The steep developmental trajectory for walking resembles the negatively accelerated 
performance curves characteristic of most motor learning tasks. Initial rapid improvements 
in the first 3–6 months of walking reflect infants’ discovery of the relevant parameters that 
control upright balance and propulsion72, 74–76. A protracted tapering-off period ending 
between 5–7 years of age reflects subtle fine-tuning of gait parameters70, 77. Practice, not 
merely maturation, underlies improvements72, and infants accumulate immense amount of 
practice. In one hour of free play, the average toddler takes about 2400 steps, travels the 
length of about 8 American football fields, and falls 17 times78.

Sufficient practice can lead to improvements in endurance, strength, coordination, and 
balance far beyond the norm for Western walkers4, 40. Tarahumaran children engage in long-
distance running as part of daily activity. As a consequence, endurance running exceeds the 
abilities of most Western ultra-marathoners: Tarahumaran children routinely run 10–40 km 
in a few hours and adults race 150–300 km over 24–48 hours79. From childhood, East 
African women and Nepalese porters of both genders carry prodigious loads on their heads. 
Adults in these cultures have learned to alter the biomechanics of gait so as to carry loads 
greater than their body weight with reduced energetic cost80, 81.

Obstacle Navigation

Page 7

Perception-action coupling makes locomotion functional. To navigate the everyday cluttered 
environment, children must select the appropriate movements and modify them accordingly, 
whether crawling, walking, or riding a bicycle82. Children generate the requisite perceptual 
information through exploratory movements—looking, touching, and testing various 
options7, 64, 83. The first studies of obstacle navigation tested infants on a “visual cliff,” a 
drop-off covered in safety glass84. But infants in such studies can feel the glass and, after 
one trial, they learn that the drop-off is only illusory—and so they cross85. As shown in 
Figure 6, recent researchers have used real cliffs, bridges, waterbeds, foam pits, water pits, 
slippery surfaces, barriers, apertures, monkey bars, car-filled streets, and other obstacles to 
test the development of prospective control of locomotion65, 66, 82, 86–92. Because visual and 
haptic information are not in conflict on these apparatuses, children can be tested in dozens 
of trials (an experimenter follows alongside to ensure their safety). Many of the apparatuses 
are adjustable, allowing precise assessment of children’s ability to gauge possibilities for 
locomotion.

Prelocomotor infants are sensitive to visual flow for heading93 and depth information for a 
drop-off94, but sensitivity is not enough. Mobile infants must learn to navigate. In their first 
weeks after acquiring a new posture—sitting, crawling, cruising, and walking—infants 
plunge repeatedly over the edge of impossibly steep slopes, high cliffs, and wide gaps. Over 
weeks of experience with each posture, judgments improve so that infants attempt safe 
increments within their ability and avoid risky obstacles beyond their ability7, 40.

A surprising finding is that learning does not transfer from earlier to later developing 
postures. The same infants who perceive that a large gap precludes scooting or leaning over 
the edge in an experienced sitting posture will repeatedly attempt to crawl over the gap in a 
novice crawling posture95. The same infants who perceive that a large cliff or slope is 
impossible to descend in an experienced crawling posture will repeatedly attempt to walk 
when tested in a novice walking posture64–66. In a cruising posture, pre-walking infants 
perceive precisely how large of a gap they can span with their arms, but not with their legs14. 
Clearly, failure to transfer from earlier to later developing postures is not due to fear of 
heights because the gaps, slopes, and drop-offs are high above the ground in every posture96. 
Moreover, infants are not learning fixed facts about the environment or their abilities 
because possibilities for action change from week to week as locomotor skills improve. 
Instead, infants are learning to generate and use perceptual information about the current 
status of their body relative to the environment7, 40. They are learning the relevant 
parameters for each new posture in development and the relevant exploratory behaviors for 
calibrating those parameters in a new situation.

Summary: Locomotion

Fetuses and neonates can produce leg and arm movements that grossly resemble locomotion, 
but locomotion is not hardwired or reflexive. Instead locomotor development is 
tremendously plastic and responsive to caregiving practices. And locomotion is wildly 
creative. Every infant discovers a unique solution for their first crawling, walking, bum 
shuffling, or rolling “steps.” And then they must learn to generate information for perception

and cognition to find the right solution to suit the local constraints of the cluttered, obstacle 
strewn everyday environment.

Manual Action

Manual actions begin prenatally, but outside the womb, infants require a stable postural base 
to support arm movements and perceptual information to guide movements adaptively. Tools 
extend children’s manual abilities7, 97, 98.

Spontaneous Motility

Like all actions, manual actions appear long before birth. Ten-week-old fetuses flex and 
extend their arms, wiggle their fingers, and clench their fists99, 100. By 14 weeks, fetuses 
manually explore their own bodies, the umbilical cord, and the surface of the uterine wall101. 
By 16 weeks, fetuses bring hand to mouth to suck their thumbs102. Even these early actions 
are perceptually guided and planned: Infants open their mouths in anticipation of, not in 
reaction to, the arrival of their thumb103.

Spontaneous arm and hand movements continue after birth. Throughout the first year, 
infants flap their arms, rotate their hands, and wiggle their fingers, and exhibit bouts of 
rhythmical waving, rubbing, and banging while holding objects51, 104, 105. Ironically, such 
so-called “stereotypies” may not be stereotyped at all. Infants’ first banging movements are 
highly variable in terms of arm trajectory. Banging becomes increasingly uniform with the 
arm repeatedly tracing the same upward and downward path98, 106.

Reaching and Grasping

As in locomotion, the contextual influences of infants’ bodies, physical environment, and 
social/cultural environment affect the development of manual skills. And individual infants 
forge their own developmental trajectories. Some infants learn to reach in the context of 
spontaneous arm flaps; they stiffen the arm joints to dampen inertial forces and direct the 
arm more in the direction of the target107. Other infants learn to reach more conventionally, 
by powering up their stationary arms in the presence of a target. In both cases, initial 
attempts are usually unsuccessful.

Goal-directed reaching requires perceptual information about the location of the object vis-
a-vis the hand. Given appropriate postural support, neonates and young infants show 
precursors of visually guided reaching, extending their arms more frequently while looking 
at a toy108, 109. Successful toy contacts appear between 11 and 24 weeks of age110–112, but 
reaches are jerky and crooked; the arm speeds up, slows down, and changes direction several 
times prior to contact. It takes years before children’s reaches become as smooth and straight 
as those of adults110, 113. Infants “reach” with their feet at a slightly younger age than they 
reach with their hands (Figure 7), showing that cephalocaudal (head to feet) development is 
only a rule of thumb, not an obligatory law of development114.

At about the same age that infants contact stationary targets, they show evidence of 
prospective control in dynamic situations by intercepting moving targets. As the toy moves 
along a horizontal path, infants time their arm movements so that their hand arrives at the

Visual information for frontally approaching targets is different: The toy expands in the field 
of view. By 8 to 9 months of age, infants precisely gauge whether balls approaching at 
different speeds are catchable and they initiate interceptive arm movements based on visual 
information for time to contact118.

Older children and adults rely on view of the hand as well as view of the target to guide 
reaching119, 120. However, young infants do not benefit from being able to see their moving 
hand. Researchers can measure the importance of continual visual feedback by turning off 
the lights once a reach begins (the toy glows to mark its location) or by occluding sight of 
the hand and arm with a cloth barrier. Infants begin reaching for objects in the light and dark 
at the same age, and are equally successful in both conditions112. Moreover, the kinematics 
of infants’ reaching trajectories in the light and dark are indistinguishable121 and do not 
require sight of the hand122. In other words, infants’ zigzag reach trajectories do not 
necessarily mean that they visually track their hand because infants display equally jerky 
reaches when they cannot see their hand. Jerky trajectories may result in part from postural 
constraints17 and unanticipated reactive forces110.

Much to infants’ frustration, getting the hand to the right place is only part of the problem. 
Reaching precedes grasping because control of the arms precedes control of the hands. 
Normally, 3-month-olds merely swat at objects because they lack the requisite hand control 
for grasping and do not use perceptual information about object properties to plan the grasp. 
However, with the help of sticky Velcro mittens and Velcro covered toys, swats are sufficient 
to pick up an object, thereby allowing “pre-graspers” to reap some of the benefits of 
grasping objects that only older infants normally experience123. These early benefits have 
both immediate and long-lasting effects on manual skill124–126. With increased hand/finger 
control, infants adapt their grip configuration to object properties, but they do so after 
contacting the object, not prospectively during the reach127. Prospective control of grasping 
based on visual information for object size, orientation, and substance appears months after 
infants begin reaching128–131.

Exploring Objects

An object in hand opens up new opportunities for visual, manual, and oral exploration, and 
with increasing skill, object exploration becomes increasingly multi-modal132, 133. At first, 
infants use their hands only to bring objects up to the face for looking and mouthing134. 
Increased grip strength allows infants to alternate between looking and mouthing, providing 
multimodal information about object properties. Soon, manual skills progress beyond mere 
holding. Infants heft, rub, squeeze, and finger objects31, 133, 135. Later, infants coordinate 
visual and manual exploration by transferring objects from hand to hand and rotating them 
in front of their eyes25. Hands begin to serve complementary functions, one supporting the 
object and keeping it in view, the other generating information about object properties by 
fingering or palpating136. Infants explore the relations between object and surface properties 
by banging a hard block against a rigid surface to make a noise or rubbing a soft block 
against the surface105.

Extending Abilities with Tools

Tool use has its roots in early motor actions and relies on motor actions for its 
execution97, 98, 106. Young infants’ spontaneous banging and rubbing become preschoolers’ 
hammering and drawing. Fetal hand-to-mouth behaviors become self-feeding with a spoon. 
Exploring relations between objects and surfaces sets the stage for using objects as effective 
tools.

Tool use requires infants to perceive that a goal is beyond their abilities, recognize that an 
object can serve as a means to augment their abilities, and execute the necessary movements 
to use the tool. Each of these steps in real time must first be acquired in development. For 
example, very young infants perceive when an object is out of reach137. Months later, they 
use hooks, canes, and rakes to acquire out-of-reach objects, but only if the target object is 
already placed inside the crook of the tool138–140. And still later they perceive the full 
implications of the spatial relations by orienting the tools to place the target in the crook. 
Observing caregivers or other adults use a tool effectively provides a powerful impetus for 
learning140

Implementation often stands in the way of functional tool use. Nine-month-olds grasp a 
spoon filled with applesauce by the bowl end rather than by the handle (getting a handful of 
applesauce), or with a grip that points the food away from the mouth so that they cannot eat 
(Figure 8). Eighteen-month-olds perceive the optimal grasp for delivering food to their own 
mouth and plan their grasp prospectively, but their planning is less efficient when feeding a 
doll141–143. Two-year-olds adapt their grasp to use a spoon with a bent handle144. But even 
4-year-olds fail to realize that they must use an underhand grip to grasp a spoon or hammer 
pointing away from their dominant hand145. Implementing a writing or drawing instrument 
poses similar problems for older children146. Three-year-olds use eleven different grip 
configurations to draw straight lines (including using both hands to hold the pen) and 
individual children vary their grips from trial to trial (Figure 8). Variability decreases by 5 
years of age when most children begin formal schooling, and children converge on one of 
the two common adult grips.

Summary: Manual Action

Beginning prenatally, manual actions are perceptually guided and serve exploratory 
functions. Many of infants’ spontaneous arm and hand movements are co-opted for goal-
directed manual actions and tool use. Infants use vision to locate the target of a reach and to 
preshape their hand for grasping, but they do not require sight of their hand to get it to a 
target. Exploring objects is a multimodal activity involving eyes, hands, fingers, and mouth. 
Boosting up manual skills can jump-start the cascade of opportunities for learning.

Facial Action

All the parts of the face begin moving prenatally, including the eyes while they are still fused 
shut. After birth, infants continue to produce spontaneous facial movements, but facial 
actions become integral to everyday function. The simple ability to swallow is critical for 
suckling, eating, and talking. Vocalizations and facial expressions are fundamental for

environment.

Swallowing, Sucking, and Chewing

Actions like swallowing are normally so innocuous that we don’t recognize the tremendous 
coordination required. Fetuses make swallowing, sucking, and breathing movements, but 
since they do not breathe air or eat, the movements are not coordinated147. However, to 
nurse without choking or swallowing air, newborns must coordinate movements of tongue, 
jaws, and lips to create suction, draw liquid into the mouth, pull the liquid into the pharynx, 
and divert the liquid to the esophagus while pulling air into the trachea148–150. Infants solve 
the timing problem by coordinating suck-swallow-respiration patterns at a ratio of 1:1:1 or 
2:2:1151–153.

Chewing solid food is more complicated because the food must be masticated before it can 
be swallowed. Newborns can mush up a small piece of banana and move it around the 
mouth with jaws and tongue154. However, infants rely on lateral jaw movements to do most 
of the work of chewing, whereas older children and adults use rotary jaw movements and 
incorporate more prospective actions of the lips and tongue155. Infants produce the same 
chewing movements regardless of the type of food, whereas older children select appropriate 
jaw movements and muscle forces based on the food consistency155.

Facial Gestures and Speech

Facial expressions and vocalizations appear long before infants can convey feelings and 
communicate ideas. Fetuses produce smiles, grimaces, and facial movements that resemble 
adult-like expressions of laughter, crying, and pain156, 157. Neonates produce characteristic 
facial gestures to strong stimuli such as nose wrinkling and furrowed brows to noxious 
smells158. Newborns smile most while asleep, about one smile every five minutes159, 160. 
Awake infants begin to display social smiles and laughter by 2 to 5 months of age while 
gazing at caregivers or in response to positive stimulation161. Perhaps because they are so 
critical for social interaction, facial expressions are highly redundant so that muscles 
distributed throughout the face work in concert; eyebrows can convey basic facial 
expressions as effectively as the mouth. In fact, infants who lack the ability to move specific 
parts of their faces due to severe craniofacial anomalies, cleft lip/palate, or hemangiomas 
produce recognizable smiles, cries, and interested expressions162.

The movements needed for speech production are perhaps the most complex movements 
children learn163. The jaws, lips, and tongue must be precisely positioned to shape each 
sound as air travels through the oral and nasal cavities. Both speed and accuracy are major 
challenges in speech development. Adult-like speech is incredibly fast, encompassing up to 
15 sounds per second163. As in the development of chewing, infants discover functional 
strategies to produce speech sounds, but their movements are not adult-like. For example, 
adults use quick simultaneous movements of the jaws and lips to babble (baba, mama), 
whereas infants rely primarily on jaw movements, which are easier to control164. Between 
2–6 years of age, children gain better control over their lips and incorporate those

movements into the previously established jaw movements, allowing them to produce a 
greater variety of speech sounds148.

Looking

Visual perception involves pointing the eyes in the right direction. But looking usually 
involves more than moving the eyes. It involves coordination among body, head, and eyes to 
bring a desired location into view165. For newborns who can barely turn their heads, the 
control problem is simplified: They typically watch whatever happens to be in front of them, 
whether faces, hands, objects, or more complex scenes166–168. Even after posture improves 
and infants can sit, crawl, and walk, much of what they see is opportunistic. Toddlers are less 
likely to tilt their head up to look at mother’s face than to point their gaze straight ahead at 
her knees; they see what’s in their hands or someone else’s hands because the hands are 
already in their field of view23, 169–171.

Like other motor actions, looking is more functional and adaptive when eye, head, and body 
movements are controlled prospectively. To track a moving object, infants must anticipate its 
speed and trajectory to keep their eyes moving at the right pace. Large targets moving in 
predictable ways are easier for young infants to smoothly pursue with their eyes172. When 
the target moves too quickly, the eyes lag behind, so infants often make corrective saccades 
to catch up to the target. Over months of practice, infants track smaller targets at faster 
speeds173, resorting less often to corrective saccades. Initially, infants keep their eyes on the 
target, but their head lags behind. By 4–5 months, infants coordinate movements of eyes and 
head to smoothly follow moving objects174. While watching an object move repeatedly 
behind an occluder, 4-month-olds keep their eyes on the point where the object disappeared 
and then struggle to catch up to its motion after it appears on the other side; 6-month-olds 
visually anticipate the location where the object will reappear, indicating their understanding 
that the object exists even when it is out of sight175.

As in the case of walking, infants amass tremendous amounts of experience while learning 
to look. In one day, infants shift their gaze roughly 50,000 times176. By 2 months of age, 
infants have accumulated 200 hours of visual experience175 and by 3.5 months of age, 
researchers estimate that infants have produced 3–6 million eye movements177. However, 
researchers know very little about what infants actually see outside of the laboratory. Head-
mounted eye tracking provides a new method for observing infants’ eye movements during 
unconstrained, spontaneous activity. As shown in Figure 9, infants wear two small cameras 
that record their eye movements and field of view for real-time gaze processing. Toddlers 
seamlessly distribute visual attention among multiple motor tasks, looking toward obstacles 
to guide crawling and walking, fixating objects to guide the hand while reaching, and 
glancing occasionally at caregivers to initiate or respond to social interactions169. Visual 
guidance becomes increasingly efficient over the course of development. Quick glances 
toward obstacles from a distance elicit more costly types of exploration such as touching83. 
Infants’ short bodies serendipitously contribute to successful obstacle navigation because 
their field of view includes more of the floor compared with older children and adults, who 
primarily guide locomotion with visual information from the periphery178.

Summary: Facial Action

Page 13

Facial actions include many of our most prized and basic social skills—talking, facial 
gestures, eating and drinking, and looking at others and at the environment. And each of 
these skills sets off a new cascade of interactions. Infants’ solutions for moving the various 
parts of their face often differ from those of adults, but they get the job done in that 
developmental niche.

Conclusion

The study of motor development is really the study of behavioral development. As such, it 
can provide a useful window into general processes of development because the topic of 
study—movement—is directly observable. Researchers in motor development have always 
recognized the importance of the bodily context7. How could they do otherwise? Movements 
depend on physical forces and the moment-to-moment changes and developmental status of 
the body affect forces. The developmental systems perspective encourages researchers also 
to consider a larger context that includes the physical and social/cultural environment, and to 
view motor behaviors as potentially both cause and consequence of developmental change in 
other psychological domains. Although prominent developmental theorists have long 
recognized the importance of motor development for psychological development more 
generally5, 6, only recently have researchers begun to systematically map out these 
developmental pathways.

Toddler losing balance in a “moving room.” Child stands on a solid floor surrounded by 
walls that move back and forth along a track. Here, the walls move toward the child creating 
the visual illusion of the body swaying forward; the child compensates by swaying 
backward. Adapted from39.

Variations in infants’ crawling patterns. Left column shows four different crawling styles: 
“army” crawling with the abdomen continually resting on the ground, “inchworm” crawling 
with the belly on and off the ground during each cycle, standard hands-and-knees crawling, 
and hands-and-feet “bear” crawling. Center column represents combinations of arms and 
legs used to propel the body. Right column shows combinations of belly, hands, knees, and 
feet used to maintain balance. Each row shows a unique crawling pattern. Adapted from58.

(A) Some of the strategies infants use to descend slopes: Scooting down in a sitting position, 
crawling on hands and knees, sliding head-first while prone, and turning their bodies to back 
down feet first. (B) Some of the strategies infants use to cross bridges holding a wobbly 
handrail for support. Infants employ a “hunchback” strategy by pushing down on the rail to 
make it taut, walk sideways while leaning backward as if “windsurfing”, walking forward 
and pulling back on the rail as if “mountain climbing”, and “drunkenly” leaning against the 
rail as they staggered forward. Adapted from64, 68.
