Abstract 
Background  Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in patients with terminal illness and multiple chal-
lenges exist with timely and effective care in this population. Several centres have reported that one dose of the sero-
tonergic psychedelic psilocybin, combined with therapeutic support, improves these symptoms for up to 6 months 
in this patient group. Drawing upon related therapeutic mechanisms, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
(MDMA)-assisted therapy may have the potential to achieve similar, positive mental health outcomes in this group. 
Preliminary evidence also supports the tolerability of MDMA-assisted therapy for anxiety and depression in advanced-
stage cancer.

Methods  Up to 32 participants with advanced-stage cancer and associated depression and anxiety will be ran-
domised in a 1:1 ratio into one of two blinded parallel treatment arms. The intervention group will receive 120 mg 
(+ 60 mg optional supplemental dose) MDMA-assisted therapy. The psychoactive control group will receive 20 mg 
oral (+ 10 mg optional supplemental dose) methylphenidate-assisted therapy. For each medication-assisted therapy 
session, participants will undergo two 90-min therapeutic support sessions in the week preceding, and one 90-min 
support session the day after the experimental session. A battery of measures (mood, anxiety, quality of life, mystical 
experience, spiritual wellbeing, attitudes towards death, personality traits, holistic health and wellbeing, connected-
ness, demoralisation, expectations, qualitative data and safety measures) will be assessed at baseline and through to 
the end of the protocol. Participants will be followed up until either 12 months post-randomisation or death, which-
ever occurs first.

Discussion  This study will examine the effect of MDMA-assisted therapy on symptoms of anxiety and depres-
sion in advanced-stage cancer. Potential therapeutic implications include establishing the safety and effectiveness 
of a novel treatment that may relieve mental suffering in patients with life-threatening illness.

Introduction
Background and rationale {6a}
Background

Advanced-stage cancer is associated with a high preva-
lence  of  depression,  anxiety  and  post-traumatic  stress 
disorder  (PTSD)  [1–3].  These  disorders  significantly 
impact  quality  of  life  [4],  contributing  to  the  broad 
term  “existential  distress”,  one  of  the  most  challenging 
problems in palliative medicine [5, 6].

Moreover, several challenges exist in providing timely 
and  effective  care  for  this  population.  These  include 
limited access to specialist psychological and psychiat-
ric input, issues with assessment and accurate diagnosis 
in complex presentations, where addressing psycholog-
ical  issues  may  be  less  prioritised,  limited  training  for 
mental  health  services  for  managing  these  unique  and 
existential  issues  encountered  in  palliative  medicine, 
side effects and interactions in often medically complex 
and comorbid patients, and delayed onset of action for 
psychological  and  pharmacological  interventions  cou-
pled with the limited time available at the end of life [7].
Since  2007,  when  the  National  Comprehensive  Can-
cer Care Network identified “distress” as the sixth vital 
sign  [8],  significant  progress  has  been  made  towards 
defining a new treatment paradigm using a novel class 
of  pharmacological  agents  for  pathological  distress 
associated with life-threatening illness.

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA),  a 
low affinity agonist of the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) recep-
tor  and  a  potent  releaser  and  re-uptake  inhibitor  of 
serotonin, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent dopa-
mine [9], has therapeutic potential for treating psycho-
logical  disorders  prevalent  in  advanced-stage  cancer. 
MDMA’s  qualitative  effects  have  been  described  as 
pro-social  and  include  increased  feelings  of  sociabil-
ity, extroversion, trust, acceptance, communication and 
empathy.  Compared  with  psilocybin,  a  potent  5-HT2A 
agonist,  MDMA  is  less  prone  to  cause  hallucinatory 
effects, fear, disorientation, nausea and ego-dissolution 
[10–17].  Like  psilocybin,  MDMA  increases  measures 
of  the  personality  domain  of  openness  [18,  19].  Trials 
of  single  doses  of  psilocybin  in  advanced-stage  can-
cer  have  shown  promising  results,  significantly  reduc-
ing  anxiety  and  depression,  and  improving  quality  of 
life  in  the  majority  of  participants  [20–22].  This  effect 
profile has also been reproduced in treatment-resistant 
depression  including  in  an  open-label  study  and  phase 
2  study  [23,  24].  A  large  international  multi-centre 
randomised-controlled trial (RCT) of psilocybin in the 
treatment of depression is currently underway [25].

Neurobiological mechanisms of MDMA

The  neurobiological  mechanisms  that  underlie  the  pur-
ported  therapeutic  effects  of  MDMA-assisted  therapy 
are  not  fully  understood.  Current  theories  include  the 
potential  role  of  MDMA  in  increasing  oxytocin  levels, 
which may strengthen bonding with family members and 
significant others, including clinicians, thereby strength-
ening  therapeutic  alliances  [26,  27].  Functional  mag-
netic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI)  studies  suggest  MDMA 
increases  ventromedial  prefrontal  activity  and  decreases 
amygdala activity [28], which may have positive effects on 
emotional regulation, avoidance behaviours and fear [29]. 
Interestingly, MDMA has been found to modulate intero-
ception (how bodily signals are interpreted and received) 
[30,  31],  abnormalities  of  which  have  been  associated 
with  both  depression  and  anxiety  disorders  [30–34]. 
fMRI studies of participants with dysregulated interocep-
tion have shown changes in functional circuitry that cor-
relate  with  regions  of  interest  also  affected  by  MDMA, 
specifically  the  insula  [31].  MDMA  is  also  known  to 
increase  norepinephrine  release  and  circulating  cortisol 
[35],  possibly  leading  to  improved  emotional  engage-
ment and decreased fear responses. These neurobiologi-
cal  mechanisms  are  relevant  to  pain  perception  and  the 
concept of central sensitisation (nociplastic pain) [36–38] 
and may also help explain reports of decreased pain per-
ception in previous uncontrolled studies of MDMA [15, 
39–42].  This  concordance  suggests  a  neurobiological 
basis  for  the  potential  therapeutic  effects  of  MDMA  in 
depression and anxiety in this population.

Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  oral  MDMA  are  complex  but 
relatively well described, showing non-linear characteris-
tics of dose versus plasma concentration [35, 43–45]. Oral 
MDMA undergoes hepatic metabolism and is both a sub-
strate and inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6. The half-life 
of MDMA is 7–8 h with peak effects occurring at 1–2 h. 
The  main  active  metabolites,  3,4-methylenedioxyam-
phetamine  (MDA),  4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethampheta-
mine (HMMA) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-amphetamine 
(HMA)  are  renally  excreted.  Most  pharmacokinetic 
studies  have  used  recreational  dose  equivalents  of  1  to 
1.6  mg/kg.  Prototypical  MDMA  effects  occur  at  doses 
above  80  mg  [46],  with  greater  hallucinatory  effects  at 
higher doses. [NO_PRINTED_FORM].

The role of mystical and spiritual experience in therapeutic 
effect of psychedelics

Psilocybin  has  been  found  to  induce  intense  visual 
and  cognitive  effects,  with  profound  changes  in  con-
sciousness  leading  to  purported  therapeutic  mystical  or 

 Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336 

Page 4 of 29

spiritual  experiences  [11,  47].  Although  MDMA  differs 
from psilocybin in both chemical structure and pharma-
cology  [10],  it  may  have  the  potential  to  achieve  similar 
positive  mental  health  outcomes  without  these  poten-
tially confrontational experiences and perceived psycho-
logical risk associated with high (hallucinogenic) doses of 
psilocybin.

MDMA‑assisted therapy

As  mentioned,  MDMA  directly  reduces  fear-related 
activity  in  the  amygdala  [28].  It  also  stimulates  cortical 
activity  (layer  5  pyramidal  cells),  via   5HT2A  receptors, 
similarly  to  classical  psychedelics  [10],  which  have  also 
been  used  in  the  context  of  end-of-life  distress  [21,  22]. 
With  MDMA  there  is  no  reduction  or  clouding  of  con-
sciousness,  as  often  occurs  with  sedation  in  the  pallia-
tive care setting. Taken together, these mechanisms may 
allow people to address avoided psychic contents such as 
regrets about their life, unfinished business, problematic 
relationships  and  past  traumatic  experiences.  It  is  also 
thought to facilitate revision of existential defences, pro-
viding the opportunity for rediscovering or strengthening 
a sense of meaning and purpose in life.

Previous research, effects and safety

The evidence for MDMA‑assisted therapy  The therapeu-
tic potential of MDMA has been recognised by the Food 
and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  in  the  United  States  of 
America, which granted “breakthrough treatment” desig-
nation to MDMA in 2017 for phase 3 trials to commence 
in 2018 for severe PTSD. The results of this first two dou-
ble-bind,  placebo-controlled,  phase  3  MDMA-assisted 
therapy studies (n = 90  and n = 104 respectively) showed 
significantly  reduced  PTSD  symptoms  and  functional 
impairment  in  the  MDMA  group  compared  to  placebo 
[48, 49]. Prior to these studies, phase 2 randomised-con-
trolled  pilot  studies  for  PTSD  consistently  showed  that 
MDMA-assisted  therapy  improves  symptoms  of  anxiety 
in  participants  with  chronic  treatment-resistant  PTSD, 
with efficacy extending up to and in some cases beyond 
12 months after treatment [46, 50–53].

Other  work  has  included  a  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled  pilot  study  which  explored  the  effect 
of  MDMA-assisted  therapy  for  social  anxiety  in  autism 
spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  [54].  This  revealed  promising 
results with improvements in social anxiety scores being 
significantly  greater  for  the  MDMA  group  compared  to 
the  placebo  group  at  1  month  and  6  months  follow-up, 
and  no  serious  adverse  events—psychological  or  medi-
cally  related.  Further,  multiple  studies  have  included 

depression  scales  as  secondary  endpoints  with  generally 
positive outcomes [46, 50, 51].

Although  MDMA-assisted  therapy  has  not  been  spe-
cifically  investigated  in  the  context  of  advanced  cancer, 
there  has  been  one  phase  2  randomised-controlled  trial 
using  MDMA-assisted  therapy  for  treatment  of  anxiety 
in the setting of life-threating illness. This study showed 
MDMA was well-tolerated and produced a mean reduc-
tion in anxiety compared to placebo, although had a small 
sample (n = 18) and group differences failed to reach sta-
tistical significance [55].

Safety  and  tolerability  Data  from  a  pooled  analysis  of 
six  phase  2  RCTs  for  MDMA-assisted  therapy  in  PTSD 
and  the  two  phase  3  RCTs  for  MDMA-assisted  therapy 
in PTSD showed that MDMA-assisted therapy is gener-
ally and relatively safe and well tolerated [48, 49, 53]. The 
most frequently reported psychiatric adverse reactions in 
these  studies  were  anxiety,  depressed  mood,  insomnia, 
irritability  and  panic  attack.  The  most  common  physi-
cal  adverse  reactions  included  dizziness,  fatigue,  head-
ache,  jaw  clenching/tight  jaw,  muscle  tightness,  lack  of 
appetite,  nausea,  hyperhidrosis,  feeling  hot,  feeling  cold 
and transient rises in blood pressure, heart rate and tem-
perature.  Most  expected  reactions  were  rated  mild  or 
moderate, were transient, and reduced in frequency over 
the 7 days following an experimental session. Moreover, 
no  changes  in  neurocognitive  function  were  detected. 
Positive  suicidal  ideation  and  non-suicidal  self-injurious 
behaviour  were  reported  in  some  participants,  although 
the causal relationship to the psychotherapeutic process, 
study-drug, or to random group differences were unable 
to be determined. There were few serious adverse events 
related  to  suicidal  ideation  in  the  MDMA-assisted  ther-
apy groups, and no recorded suicide attempts. Significant 
cardiovascular  adverse  events  in  the  MDMA-assisted 
groups were few but included an exacerbation of ventric-
ular  extrasystole,  QT  prolongation,  irregular  heartbeats 
and  palpitations.  Additionally,  there  was  no  reported 
abuse  of  externally  sourced  MDMA  during  the  study 
treatments.

Whilst  most  MDMA-assisted  therapy  studies  have 
involved physically healthy participants, importantly, the 
phase 2 RCT in participants with life-threatening illness 
(in those with greater physical health difficulties) showed 
it was well tolerated in this population [55]. In this study, 
there was no serious suicidal ideation or positive suicidal 
behaviour, and elevations in vital signs were self-limiting. 
Other  common  adverse  events  were  similar  to  PTSD 
studies,  and  most  adverse  events  were  deemed  to  be 
related to cancer progression and medical interventions.

Objectives {7}

The  objectives  of  the  current  study  are  to  assess  the 
effect  of  a  single  dose  of  methylphenidate-assisted  vs 
MDMA-assisted  therapy  on  depression  and  anxiety  in 
participants  with  advanced-stage  cancer.  Our  hypoth-
esis  is  that  MDMA-assisted  therapy  will  improve 
depression  and  anxiety  in  participants  with  advanced-
stage  cancer  at  4  weeks  from  baseline  as  measured  by 
changes  in  the  Montgomery  Asberg  Depression  Scale 
(MADRS)  (primary  outcome)  [56],  Hamilton  Anxi-
ety  Rating  Scale  (HAM-A)  and  Hospital  Anxiety  and 
Depression  Score  (HADS)  (secondary  outcomes)  [57, 
58].

The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
MDMA-assisted  therapy  in  participants  with  advanced-
stage  cancer.  This  will  be  assessed  throughout  the 
study  by  reported  adverse  events,  laboratory  tests,  vital 
signs,  physician  supervision,  concomitant  medications 
required,  suicidality  via  the  Columbia-Suicide  Severity 
Rating  Scale  (C-SSRS)  [59]  and  performance  status  via 
the  Australian-modified  Karnofsky  Performance  Score 
(AKPS) [60].

Providing  MDMA-assisted  therapy  in  the  advanced-
stage  cancer  setting  is  a  relatively  novel  intervention. 
Therefore, additional, exploratory objectives will be ana-
lysed  including  measures  about  quality  of  life,  mystical 
experiences, spirituality, attitudes towards death, person-
ality traits, holistic health and wellbeing, connectedness, 
demoralisation, expectations and qualitative data. Analy-
sis or inferential testing of these measures will be consid-
ered exploratory in nature.

Trial design {8}

This  is  a  double-blind,  randomised  study,  testing  the 
superiority  of  MDMA-assisted  therapy  over  a  control 
group,  replacing  MDMA  with  a  psychoactive  placebo—
methylphenidate,  in  advanced-stage  cancer  and  associ-
ated  depression  and  anxiety.  Up  to  32  participants  (16 
per arm) will be enrolled in the study. After screening, all 
participants  will  undergo  two  preparatory  therapy  ses-
sions. Participants will then be randomised in a 1:1 ratio 
into one of the following treatment arms:

•  Methylphenidate  20  mg + 10  mg  optional  supple-

mental dose, or

•  MDMA 120 mg + 60 mg optional supplemental dose

On the day following the experimental session, all par-
ticipants  will  undergo  an  integration  therapy  session. 
Assessments  will  continue  to  be  undertaken  until  the 
28th  day  following  the  experimental  session.  No  treat-
ment arm cross-over will be undertaken.

Methods: participants, interventions and outcomes
SPIRIT reporting guidelines have been used for protocol 
preparation [61].

Study setting {9}

Data  will  be  collected  at  two  sites  in  New  Zealand: 
Dunedin  and  Auckland.  All  study  visits  will  occur  in 
a  comfortable,  monitored  clinical  setting.  During  the 
experimental session, participants will have two qualified 
therapists with them for at least 8 h after receiving their 
dose. The  sites  for  these  experimental  sessions  will  pro-
vide  additional,  comfortable  non-clinical  surroundings 
including  temperature  control,  an  eye-mask,  a  couch, 
blankets,  headphones  and  music.  The  music  played  will 
be  a  standardised  playlist  decided  by  the  study  team,  in 
keeping  with  previous  studies  of  psychedelic-assisted 
therapy  for  novel  indications,  to  manage  the  potential 
role  of  music  as  a  confounding  variable  and  optimise 
experimental  control  for  the  hypotheses  being  tested 
[62].

Eligibility criteria {10}
Population

All  participants  will  be  adults  aged  18  and  over  with  a 
diagnosis  of  life-threatening  or  other  advanced-stage 
cancer  and  associated  depression  and  anxiety.  Table  1 
outlines the full inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Who will take informed consent? {26a}

A participant information sheet (PIS) and informed con-
sent  form  will  be  provided  to  participants  prior  to  their 
screening visit (see Additional File 1). Participants, rela-
tives,  guardians  and,  if  necessary,  legal  representatives 
will be given an opportunity to discuss any details of the 
study  with  study  personnel.  Consent  will  be  obtained 
by a member of the research team at the screening visit. 
The  informed  consent  form  has  been  approved  by  the 
Northern  B  Health  and  Disability  Ethics  Committee 
(NBHDEC)  and  must  be  signed  by  the  participant.  The 
investigator  will  ensure  that  the  participant  has  been 
given  enough  information,  both  written  and  oral,  about 
the  nature,  possible  risks,  benefits  and  procedures  that 
the  study  will  entail,  in  a  language  that  the  participant 
can  understand.  They  will  be  informed  that  participa-
tion is purely voluntary, withdrawal at any time is possi-
ble, and that non-participation in the study will in no way 
affect their ongoing healthcare.

If  any  questions,  concerns,  or  complaints  about  the 
study  arise  at  any  stage,  the  participants  are  invited  to 
contact the investigators. Or, if they wish to talk to some-
one  not  involved  in  the  study,  they  are  invited  to  con-
tact an independent health and disability advocate at the

  a. Are willing to commit to medication dosing, therapy sessions, follow-up sessions, 
completing evaluation instruments, and all necessary telephone contact
  b. Agree to not participate in any other interventional clinical trials during the dura-
tion of this study
Leading up to experimental sessions
  c. Agree to take nothing by mouth except clear liquids after 12:00 A.M. (midnight) 
the night before the experimental session
  d. Refrain from the use of any psychoactive medication not approved 
by the research team from baseline through study termination.
  e. Agree not to use caffeine or nicotine for 2 h before and at least 6 h after the initial 
dose during the experimental session.

f. Are willing to comply with medication requirements per protocol (refer to the sec-

tion on Allowed Concomitant Medications). Medications will only be discontin-
ued after enrollment per clinical judgement of the site physician in consultation 
with the prescribing physician.
  g. Are on a stable dose of allowable opiates (per the section on Allowed Concomi-
tant Medications) for two weeks leading up to the experimental session as determined 
by the study physician. During this period and throughout the study, the participant 
will be allowed to take usual pain medication if needed for breakthrough pain.
   h. Agree that, for 1 week preceding the experimental session to refrain from:

• Taking any herbal supplement (except with prior approval of the research team).
• Taking any nonprescription medications (with the exception of non-steroidal 

anti-inflammatory medications or acetaminophen/paracetamol unless with prior 
approval of the research team).

• Taking any prescription medications (with the exception of contraception, 

thyroid hormones, or other medications approved by the research team).

(1) Pregnancy or lactation
(2) Body mass index (BMI) < 15
(3) Recent (less than 6 months) or current use of illicit drugs including metham-
phetamine, heroin and synthetic cannabis.
(4) Other non-prescribed drugs will prompt exclusion at the discretion of the study 
physician.
(5) Are unable to give adequate informed consent.
(6) Is taking a medication that is exclusionary or has not stopped taking an exclu-
sionary drug for the requisite washout period.
(7) Liver function test > three times the upper limit of normal or creatinine clear-
ance < 30 mL/min
(8) Upon review of medical or psychiatric history must not have any current 
or past diagnosis that would be considered a risk to participation in the study, 
including significant cardiovascular disease (see below).
(9) Any participant presenting current serious suicide risk, as determined 
through psychiatric interview, responses to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS), or clinical judgement of the investigator, will be excluded; however, 
history of suicide attempts is not in itself exclusionary. Any participant likely 
to require hospitalisation related to suicidal ideation and behaviour, in the judge-
ment of the investigator, will not be enrolled. Any participant presenting 
with the following on the baseline C-SSRS will be excluded:

• Suicidal ideation score of 4 or greater within the last month of the assessment 

at a frequency of once a week or more.

• Suicidal ideation score of 5 within the last 6 months of the assessment.
• Any suicidal behaviour, including suicide attempts or preparatory acts, 
within 6 months of the assessment. Participants with non-suicidal self-injurious 
behaviour may be included if approved by the study physician.
(10) Have a history of any medical condition that could make receiving a sympa-
thomimetic drug harmful due to increases in blood pressure and heart rate. This 
includes, but is not limited to, a history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular 
accident, or aneurysm. Participants with other mild, stable chronic medical prob-
lems may be enrolled if the site physician, chief investigator and study physician 
agree the condition would not significantly increase the risk of MDMA administra-
tion or be likely to produce significant symptoms during the study that could inter-
fere with study participation or be confused with side effects of MDMA. Examples 
of stable medical conditions that could be allowed include, but are not limited 
to, diabetes mellitus (type 2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, etc. Any medical disorder judged by the investiga-
tor to significantly increase the risk of MDMA administration by any mechanism will 
require exclusion.
(11) Have uncontrolled essential hypertension using the standard criteria 
of the American Heart Association (values of 140/90 mmHg or higher assessed 
on three separate occasions).
(12) Have a history of ventricular arrhythmia at any time, other than occasional 
premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) 
in the absence of ischemic heart disease.
(13) Have Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or any other accessory pathway 
that has not been successfully eliminated by ablation.
(14) Have a history of arrhythmia, other than occasional PACs or PVCs 
in the absence of ischemic heart disease, within 12 months of screening. Partici-
pants with a history of atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter or paroxysmal 
supraventricular tachycardia or any other arrhythmia associated with a bypass tract 
may be enrolled only if they have been successfully treated with ablation and have 
not had recurrent arrhythmia for at least one year off all antiarrhythmic drugs 
and confirmed by a cardiologist.
(15) Have a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval, for example, repeated 
demonstration of a QTc interval > 450 ms in males and > 460 ms in females. 
For transgender or non-binary participants, QTc interval will be evaluated based 
on sex assigned at birth, unless the participant has been on hormonal treatment 
for 5 or more years.
(16) Have a history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, 
heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome).
(17) Require use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval dur-
ing experimental sessions.
(18) Have any current problem which, in the opinion of the investigator or study 
physician, might interfere with participation.

Facilitator,  or  the  Health  and  Disability  Ethics  Commit-
tee (HDEC). Participants are also invited to discuss with 
their general practitioner (GP), the Cancer Society, other 
healthcare  professional,  or  a  lawyer  for  independent 
advice.

The dated signature of the participant must document 
consent  and  confirms  consent  is  based  on  information 
that  is  understood.  A  copy  of  the  consent  form  and  PIS 
will  be  given  to  the  participant,  with  the  original  forms 
retained in the records of the investigator.

Additional consent provisions for collection and use 
of participant data and biological specimens {26b}

All participants will be informed of, and provide consent 
for, the collection and use of their data and tissue for the 
purposes  of  this  study,  and  for  any  mandatory  second-
ary  uses.  Additional  written  consent  will  be  sought  for 
optional secondary uses of data.

Consent for the collection and use of information may 
be  withdrawn  at  any  time  by  the  participant  informing 
the  study  doctor.  If  consent  is  withdrawn,  study  partici-
pation  will  end  and  the  study  team  will  stop  collecting 
information  from  the  participant.  Information  collected 
up  until  withdrawal  from  the  study  will  continue  to  be 
used and included in the study. If a participant withdraws 
from  this  study,  their  treatment  will  continue  with  their 
usual clinical team.

At  the  end  of  the  project,  any  personal  information 
will be destroyed immediately except, as required by the 
sponsoring universities’ research policy, any raw data on 
which  the  results  of  the  project  depend  which  will  be 
retained in secure storage for 10 years, after which it will 
be destroyed.

Interventions
Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}

The  primary  intervention  will  be  the  standard  MDMA 
dose  of  120  mg,  followed  2  h  later  by  an  optional  sup-
plemental  dose  of  60  mg  in  line  with  previous  studies 
[46]. This fixed dose, rather than dosing by body weight, 
is  based  on  the  lack  of  a  clear,  linear  dose  response  and 
behavioural effects and is in keeping with previous stud-
ies  as  outlined  in  the  Multidisciplinary  Association  for 
Psychedelic  Studies  Public  Benefit  Corporation  (MAPS 
PBC)  MDMA  Investigator’s  Brochure  [63].  The  initial 
120  mg  dose  is  expected  to  produce  all  the  commonly 
reported  effects  of  MDMA,  with  the  supplemental 
dose  controlling  for  inter-individual  differences  in  dose 
response.  The  supplemental  dose  will  prolong  subjec-
tive drug effects without producing physiological effects 
significantly greater than peak effects occurring after the 
initial dose.

The  psychoactive  placebo  control  will  be  methylphe-
nidate 20 mg plus an optional 10 mg supplemental dose. 
The  psychoactive  effects  of  methylphenidate  (increased 
alertness and euphoria) bear some resemblance to some 
of  the  effects  of  MDMA.  Pharmacokinetically,  methyl-
phenidate  is  a  viable  active  placebo  to  MDMA,  with  a 
similar time to peak effects (2 h), a shorter half-life (2 to 
3  h),  and  is  predominantly  renally  excreted  [64].  Whilst 
longer-acting  methylphenidate  formulations  may  have 
a  similar  half-life  to  MDMA,  these  are  often  not  used 
clinically first-line options in stimulant-naïve patients for 
tolerability reasons. Methylphenidate has also been used 
both as an adjunct and as monotherapy for depression in 
advanced-stage cancer at doses ranging from 5 to 30 mg 
daily;  however,  its  antidepressant  effects  may  be  short-
lived [65].

These  considerations  reinforce  the  choice  of  methyl-
phenidate at doses of 20 to 30 mg in this study given its 
likely tolerability in this population (based on these exist-
ing  uses)  and  its  sufficient  psychoactive  effects  to  act  as 
a suitable active placebo, whilst it is unlikely to result in 
enduring positive effects on anxiety and depression when 
administered as a single dose. This will allow for compar-
isons to be made with MDMA-assisted therapy and help 
maintain blinding for participants and study staff.

Intervention description {11a}

Informed  consent  will  be  obtained  at  the  screening 
visit  before  performing  and  testing  to  determine  a  par-
ticipant’s  eligibility.  All  participants,  even  if  found  to  be 
ineligible, will be assigned a three-digit participant iden-
tification  number.  Once  assigned  to  a  participant,  the 
participant  number  will  not  be  reused.  Participants  will 
then  undertake  the  baseline  assessments  scheduled  for 
the screening visit (Visit 1; see Table 2).

For  this  study,  a  separate  study  manual  has  been  devel-
oped based on previous established manuals for MDMA-
assisted  therapy  as  used  in  the  previous  phase  2  trial  for 
participants  with  life-limiting  illness  and  recent  phase  2 
trials  for  treatment-resistant  PTSD  [48,  55,  66–68].  This 
manual  has  been  further  adapted  to  provide  a  structured 
approach for pre- and post- MDMA-assisted therapy and 
psychoeducation,  with  a  therapeutic  approach  tailored 
towards  the  treatment  of  depression  and  anxiety  in  the 
context of advanced-stage cancer and specific to the needs 
of  participants  in  Aotearoa/New  Zealand.  All  therapists 
providing  therapy  in  this  study  will  be  required  to  have  a 
professional qualification in either counselling, social work, 
psychotherapy,  psychology,  nursing,  medicine  or  other 
suitable  behavioural  health  modality  as  approved  by  the 
principal investigator, and have formal training and super-
vision  provided  by  The  Multidisciplinary  Association  for

Psychedelic  Studies  Public  Benefit  Corporation  (MAPS 
PBC) [69].

After  completing  the  screening  visit  and  the  principal 
investigator  has  confirmed  that  all  eligibility  criteria  have 
been  met,  participants  will  be  scheduled  for  two  therapy 
sessions prior to the experimental session—one in the week 
prior  and  one  on  the  second  the  day  before  the  experi-
mental  session.  Safety  data  via  adverse  events  reporting 
and  performance  status  will  be  assessed  during  the  first 
therapy  session  (Visit  2),  and  adverse  events  reporting 
repeated  during  the  second  therapy  session  (Visit  3).  The 
MAPS PBC model for MDMA-assisted therapy will be fol-
lowed: two therapists (preferably one male and one female) 
will be present with each participant for all pre- and post- 
MDMA-assisted therapy sessions and will both be present 
for 8 h during the experimental session.

On the day of the experimental session (Visit 4), partici-
pants will have their last caffeine or nicotine use recorded 
and  complete  their  vital  signs  and  adverse  events  form 
2  h  before  their  scheduled  dose.  Participants  will  be  ran-
domised in a blinded fashion to the MDMA- versus meth-
ylphenidate-assisted  therapy  groups.  All  participants  will 
receive the first dose of either methylphenidate or MDMA, 
each  followed  2  h  later  by  repeat  vital  signs  and  adverse 
events  reporting.  An  optional  supplemental  dose  will  be 
administered at 2 h if eligible. Table 3 outlines the medica-
tion and dose received in each treatment arm.

All  participants  will  undergo  8  h  of  supervised  med-
ication-assisted  therapy  in  a  comfortable  environment. 
Experimental sessions will be audio and video recorded for 
qualitative analysis and to assess therapist adherence to the 
therapy manual.

Safety  data  will  be  recorded  via  vital  signs  and  adverse 
events  reporting  at  4,  6,  and  7  h  post-dosing,  and  perfor-
mance  status  at  7  h  post-dosing.  In  addition,  at  7  h  post-
dosing, the efficacy of blinding will be measured for both 
participants  and  therapists,  followed  by  measures  regard-
ing  subjective  drugs  effects  to  capture  the  extent  of  any 
mystical  and  spiritual  experiences  experienced  during  the 
experimental session.

Post-dosing  support  will  be  given  throughout  the  8-h 
period of the experimental session, with additional support 
available as required for 2 h onsite and via phone contact 
for 24 h post-dosing. There will be a 90-min psychothera-
peutic integration session the day following the experimen-
tal session (Visit 5) with an optional additional integration

session at the discretion of the study therapists. Outcome 
measures and safety data will be repeated as per the study 
schedule during the integration session, and during follow-
up visits on the fourth, eighth, 15th and 28th days following 
the experimental session (Visits 6, 7, 8 and 9 respectively).

Following  this,  brief  follow-up  interviews  will  be  con-
ducted with participants and/or their GP at months 1, 2, 
6 and 12.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated 
interventions {11b}

Only the initial dose is required to be given at the experi-
mental  session.  Supplemental  doses  should  be  offered  if 
both  therapists  agree  and  unless  contraindicated.  Vital 
signs will be measured at 2 h post-dose, prior to offering 
the supplemental dose. If blood pressure (BP) is less than 
160 and heart rate (HR) is less than 110 and/or stabilising 
or trending down after reassessing at 5-min intervals and 
both therapists agree, then the supplemental dose will be 
offered  to  the  participant  as  an  option.  No  other  study 
drug dose adjustments are permitted.

The experimental session will be discontinued if unac-
ceptable  toxicity  occurs,  if  participants  report  signifi-
cant  problems  (for  example,  extreme  distress,  suicidal 
thinking  or  severe  side  effects)  associated  with  study 
medication,  or  consent  is  withdrawn.  Participants  who 
discontinue the study treatment will continue to have the 
final assessments if they consent. Participants will be fol-
lowed up until death or the data cut-off date.

If participants drop out of the study early, the primary 

reason this should be selected from the following:

•  Adverse event
•  Protocol violation
•  Withdrawal of consent
•  Lost to follow-up
•  Death

The  primary  reason  for  premature  discontinuation  of 

the study may be one of the following:

•  Unexpected adverse events
•  Other unexpected events
•  Principal investigator request

Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}

Experimental sessions will be audio and video recorded 
to  assess  therapist  adherence  to  the  therapy  manual. 
Adherence  to  the  treatment  manual  will  be  randomly 
checked  by  review  of  the  video  by  blinded  adherence 
raters  within  the  study  team.  The  site-specific  study 
team will monitor data in real time to ensure complete 
data collection for all participants, including those who 
discontinue  treatment.  Sites  will  be  required  to  make 
and document a specific number of attempts to obtain 
follow-up  data.  To  ensure  that  all  participants  regard-
less  of  group  assignment  are  treated  in  a  similar  man-
ner,  the  sites  will  be  required  to  follow  the  protocol 
and treatment manual delineating the minimum length 
of  time  per  visit  type  and  describing  the  delivery  of 
treatment.

Relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited 
during the trial {11d}

The  principal  investigator  or  designee  will  instruct 
the  participant  to  notify  the  study  team  about  any 
new  medications  the  participant  takes  28  days  prior 
to  randomisation  and  after  the  start  of  the  study  drug 
treatment.  All  medications  and  significant  non-drug 
therapies  (including  physiotherapy  and  blood  transfu-
sions)  administered  28  days  prior  to  randomisation 
and after the start of the study drug treatment must be 
listed on the concomitant medications form. All medi-
cations  will  continue  to  be  recorded  through  7  days 
after  the  experimental  session.  Throughout  the  entire 
protocol,  all  medications  used  to  treat  adverse  events 
will be collected, and all changes including discontinua-
tions or additions to medications will be collected. The 
study  team  will  also  inquire  about  concomitant  medi-
cation adherence and document all information on the 
concomitant medications form. Participants may return 
to taking psychiatric medications and discontinue con-
traception, as required, after the last study visit.

Allowed concomitant medications

The site physician may prescribe necessary and appropri-
ate medications in accordance with New Zealand regula-
tions during the study to treat adverse events that do not 
respond to other management outlined in the treatment 
manual. Examples include concomitant benzodiazepines 
for uncontrolled anxiety (for example, lorazepam at mod-
est  doses  and  occasional  use  only  to  avoid  withdrawal 
effects  of  discontinuation  during  the  experimental  ses-
sion) or sleep aids in compliance with prohibited medica-
tions list. Sublingual nitroglycerin will be available on site 
in case of emergency and chest pain assessed as possibly 
cardiac in origin, in consultation with the site physician.

Gabapentin,  pregabalin  and  certain  opiates  will  be 
allowed  when  prescribed  for  pain  management.  The 
following  opiates  will  be  allowed  during  the  study: 
hydrocodone,  morphine  and  codeine.  Prior  to  enroll-
ment, participants who are taking opiates not included 
on this list such as methadone should be cross-tapered 
to  an  allowable  opiate  under  the  care  of  their  outside 
prescribing  physician.  Opiate  medications  may  reduce 
the  efficacy  of  MDMA  and  may  prolong  QT/QTc 
interval,  but  the  allowable  opiates  have  been  selected 
because  they  have  the  lowest  potential  for  QT/QTc 
interval prolongation. Individuals using opiates for pain 
management  will  be  able  to  continue  their  long-act-
ing  and  breakthrough  pain  regimen  if  they  have  been 
relatively  stable  for  the  preceding  2  weeks.  This  will 
be  agreed  as  part  of  screening  at  the  discretion  of  the 
study physician.

Prescription  and  nonprescription  medications  (psy-
choactive  and  other)  and  herbal  supplements  must  be 
reviewed  by  the  research  team.  Failure  to  comply  with 
protocol requirements for concomitant medications may 
result in withdrawal from treatment, depending on inves-
tigator and study physician judgement.

Prohibited medications

To be enrolled in the study, participants must:

•  Refrain  from  the  use  of  any  psychoactive  medica-
tion  not  approved  by  the  research  team  from  base-
line through study termination (with the exception of 
gabapentinoids or allowed opiates for pain control).
•  Refrain from the use of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC)-containing  cannabis  products,  hypericum 
perforatum  (St.  John’s  Wort),  or  other  herbs  and 
medicines  with  known  serotonergic  effects,  from 
baseline to study termination.

•  Refrain from taking any specified herbal supplement 
(except with prior approval of the research team) for 
1 week preceding each experimental session.

•  Refrain  from  taking  the  following  medications  for 
five  half-lives  of  the  medication  preceding  each 
experimental session:

◦ Any nonprescription medications (with the excep-
tion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications 
or acetaminophen), unless with prior approval of the 
research team.
◦ Any prescription medications, with the exception 
of contraception, thyroid hormones, or other medi-
cations approved by the research team.

If  the  prospective  participant  is  being  treated  with 
psychiatric  medications,  including  antidepressants  and 

 Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336 

Page 12 of 29

stimulants,  they  will  be  encouraged  to  discuss  medica-
tion  tapering  with  their  outside  treating  physician.  The 
medications  should  then  be  tapered  in  an  appropriate 
fashion to avoid withdrawal effects and should be discon-
tinued at least five half-lives plus one additional week for 
stabilisation before the experimental session to avoid the 
possibility of any interaction.

If  a  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor,  serotonin 
and  noradrenaline  reuptake  inhibitor,  monoamine  oxi-
dase  inhibitor  or  other  antidepressant  is  used  between 
the experimental session (Visit 4) and study termination 
(Visit 9), this will be noted by the study staff and the par-
ticipant will continue to be followed up.

If  the  participant  is  prescribed  stimulant  medications 
for  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  at  baseline, 
these  must  be  discontinued  five  half-lives  before  the 
experimental  session  not  restarted  for  10  days  after  the 
experimental  session. They  may  return  to  using  them  at 
the same dose and frequency following this.

Medications will only be discontinued after enrollment 
per  clinical  judgement  of  the  site  physician  in  consulta-
tion with the prescribing physician.

Provisions for post-trial care {30}

Participants will complete and exit the study on the 28th 
day  post-experimental  session  after  the  final  question-
naires  are  completed.  All  participants  will  be  invited  to 
contact  the  research  team  at  any  point  during  the  fol-
lowing  4  weeks  if  there  are  outstanding  questions  or 
concerns  about  the  study.  Participants  will  be  followed 
up  until  either  death  or  12  months  post-randomisation 
(whichever occurs earlier). This follow-up will occur via a 
brief monthly phone call to check-in with the participant 
and no formal measures will be taken. A handover docu-
ment outlining the follow-up procedure will be given to 
the  participant  and  their  general  practitioner  at  study 
completion.

Participants are considered to be on-study until one of 

the following circumstances occurs:

(1)  Death.
(2)  Withdrawal of consent.
(3)  Loss to follow-up.
(4)  Breach  of  study  agreement  including  development 
of  exclusion  criteria  or  if  the  study  physician  has 
new concerns about participant wellbeing.

Participants  whose  treatment  is  permanently  discon-
tinued  due  to  an  adverse  event  or  abnormal  laboratory 
value will be followed up at least once a week for 4 weeks. 
Serious adverse events, or events that have a suspect rela-
tionship to the study drug, will subsequently be followed 

at 4-week intervals, until resolution or stabilisation of the 
event, whichever comes first.

If participants are injured in this study, they would be 
eligible  to  apply  for  compensation  from  the  Accident 
Compensation Corporation (ACC) just as they would be 
if  they  were  injured  in  an  accident  at  work  or  at  home. 
This does not mean that any claim will automatically be 
accepted.  Participants  will  have  to  lodge  a  claim  with 
ACC, which may take some time to assess. If their claim 
is  accepted,  they  will  receive  funding  to  assist  in  their 
recovery.

Outcomes {12}

The outcomes are summarised on Table 4 and their time 
points outlined in Table 2.

Primary outcome

Montgomery‑Asberg  Depression  Rating  Scale  (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-administered outcome 
that  evaluates  the  core  symptoms  of  depression  [56]. 
Core  symptoms  covered  include  sadness,  tension,  lassi-
tude,  pessimistic  thoughts  and  suicidal  thoughts.  Items 
are rated on a 7-point Likert scale (0 = no abnormality to 
6 = severe).  Item  responses  are  summed  to  give  a  single 
score  between  0  and  60,  whereby  higher  scores  indicate 
greater  levels  of  depression. The  scale  is  relatively  quick 
to  complete.  The  MADRS  is  a  reliable  measure  and  has 
good  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s  alpha = 0.89)  and 
good  interrater  reliability  (intraclass  correlation  coef-
ficient  (ICC) = 0.86)  [70,  71].  Compared  with  the  Ham-
ilton  Depression  Scale,  the  MADRS  has  been  found  to 
have  greater  sensitivity  to  treatment-related  changes  in 
depression  severity  [72–74].  Accordingly,  the  MADRS 
is  a  suitable,  primary  endpoint  for  measuring  changes 
in  depression  ratings  for  this  trial’s  intervention.  The 
MADRS will be completed at baseline and at all follow-
up  visits  after  the  experimental  session  to  monitor  for 
trends in this depression score immediately following the 
dosing  and  therapy  sessions  and  over  time.  The  change 
in  MADRS  score  at  4  weeks  after  the  experimental  ses-
sion will serve as the timepoint for analysis of this primary 
outcome.

Secondary outcomes

Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM‑A)  The HAM-A 
is  a  14-item  clinician-administered  outcome  that  meas-
ures  current  anxiety  severity  [57].  Items  are  rated  on  a 
5-point  Likert  scale  (0 = not  present  to  4 = very  severe). 
A  total  score  is  summed  from  the  items  and  can  range 
from  0  to  56,  where < 17  indicates  mild  severity,  18 
to  24  indicates  mild-to-moderate  severity  and  25–30

indicates  moderate-to-severe.  Two  subscale  scores  can 
be  derived  from  the  HAM-A,  a  psychic  anxiety  (mental 
agitation and psychological distress) and a somatic anxi-
ety  (physical  complaints  related  to  anxiety).  Completion 
takes  between  10  and  15  min.  Interrater  reliability  of 
the  HAM-A  has  been  shown  to  be  consistent  and  the 
scale  has  demonstrated  satisfactory  correlation  coeffi-
cients indicating sufficient sensitivity to change [75]. The 
HAM-A  has  demonstrated  good  reliability  (Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.89), and its psychic and somatic subscales have 
also demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.83 and 0.80 respectively) [76]. The HAM-A was 
also a primary outcome in a similar study measuring the 
effects  of  psilocybin  in  cancer  patients  with  life-threat-
ening  diagnoses  and  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depres-
sion [21]. Therefore, the use of HAM-A will also allow for 
comparisons  to  be  made  between  MDMA  and  psilocy-
bin for this indication. The HAM-A will be completed at 

baseline and at all follow-up visits after the experimental 
session.

Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale  (HADS)  The 
HADS is a 14-item participant-reported outcome which 
measures  depression  and  anxiety  in  those  who  are  cur-
rently  physically  unwell  [58].  Items  are  scored  based  on 
severity  on  a  4-point  Likert  scale  from  0  to  3;  however, 
response  option  wording  varies  across  items.  HADS 
has  a  recall  period  of  7  days.  The  scale  consists  of  two 
subscales:  the  HADS-D  addressing  depression  (seven 
items)  and  the  HADS-A  addressing  anxiety  (seven 
items). It takes 2 to 5 min to complete. Each subscale is 
scored  individually,  and  each  has  a  score  ranging  from 
0  to  21.  Scores  less  than  7  represent  non  cases,  whilst 
scores of 8–10 are considered mild, 11–14 moderate and 
15–21  severe.  Reliability  coefficients  suggest  good  reli-
ability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83) [77]. The HADS and its 

 Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336 

Page 14 of 29

subscales,  HADS-D  and  HADS-A,  have  also  been  used 
as primary outcome measures in another study measur-
ing  the  effects  of  psilocybin-assisted  therapy  in  treating 
clinically  significant  anxiety  or  depression  in  patients 
with life-threatening cancer [22]. This will also allow for 
comparisons  to  be  made  between  MDMA  and  psilocy-
bin for treating anxiety and depressive symptoms for this 
indication. Whereas the MADRS and HAM-A are clini-
cian-rated  scales,  the  self-reported  nature  of  the  HADS 
enables  important  subjective  ratings  of  anxiety  and 
depression to be assessed. The HADS will be completed 
at baseline and at the final follow-up visit.

Exploratory outcomes

Integrated  Palliative  Outcomes  Scale  (IPOS)  The  IPOS 
is a 10-item scale which covers the physical, psychologi-
cal  and  spiritual  domains  of  life  within  the  context  of 
palliative  care  and  takes  about  8  min  to  complete  [78, 
79]. There are two versions of the IPOS, a clinician-com-
pleted  and  a  participant-completed  version.  The  latter 
will  be  used  for  this  study. The  IPOS  is  a  valid  and  reli-
able measure, with test/re-test reliability weighted kappa 
values showing good agreement (range 0.50 to 0.8) [80]. 
The IPOS will enable the collection of useful information 
regarding  subjective  changes  in  functioning  and  quality 
of life following this intervention across these important 
domains at the end of life. The IPOS will be completed at 
baseline and at all follow-up visits after the experimental 
session.

Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30)  The MEQ30  
is  a  30-item  self-report  measure  that  evaluates  a  single  
mystical  experience  evoked  by  hallucinogens  [81].  
Participants  are  asked  to  consider  to  what  degree  they 
experienced  a  number  of  phenomena  during  their  ses-
sion on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = none, not 
at  all,  to  5 = extreme. The  MEQ30  was  derived  from  the 
MEQ43 and has a four-factor structure: mystical (includ-
ing  items  from  the  internal  unity,  external  unity,  noetic 
quality and sacredness scales of the MEQ43), transcend-
ence  of  time  and  space,  positive  mood  and  ineffability 
[82].  The  four  factors  have  demonstrated  excellent  reli-
ability  based  on  Cronbach’s  alpha  (mystical = 0.97,  posi-
tive mood = 0.92, transcendence of time and space = 0.86, 
ineffability = 0.9) [81]. The MEQ-30 takes 5 min to com-
plete.  The  MEQ30  will  be  completed  at  7  h  post-dose 
during the experimental session.

Functional  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness  Therapy—Spir‑
itual  Well‑Being; The  12‑item  Spiritual  Well‑Being  Scale 
(FACIT‑Sp‑12)  The  FACIT-Sp-12  is  a  brief  12-item 

self-report scale designed to measure spiritual well-being 
in chronic or life-threatening illness [83]. It is a part of the 
wider  FACIT  measurement  system  that  includes  scales 
assessing  health-related  quality  of  life.  Items  are  scored 
on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all to 4 = very much) 
with a recall period of 7 days. The FACIT-Sp-12 consists 
of  three  subscales:  peace,  meaning  and  faith.  Scores  are 
calculated for each subscale by summing the item scores, 
multiplying by four and dividing by the number of items 
answered.  A  total  score  can  be  calculated  by  summing 
the scores of the three subscales [84]. Internal reliability 
of the subscales has been shown to be good (Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.81 to 0.88) [83]. The FACIT-Sp-12 will be com-
pleted at baseline, 7 h post-dose during the experimental 
session and at the final follow-up visit.

One  of  the  secondary  aims  of  this  study  will  be  to 
explore  the  therapeutic  overlap  of  MDMA  and  psilo-
cybin.  It  has  been  proposed  that  the  improvements 
reported  in  previous  studies  in  mental  health  outcomes 
due  to  psychedelics  such  as  psilocybin  may  depend  on 
the  mystical  or  spiritual  experiences  of  participants  [21, 
22, 47]. As noted earlier, these experiences are less prom-
inent with MDMA [11], and MDMA may achieve similar 
positive mental health outcomes without the potentially 
confrontational experiences and perceived psychological 
risk  associated  with  high  doses  of  psilocybin.  By  using 
validated  measures  for  mysticism  and  spirituality,  such 
as the MEQ and FACIT-Sp-12 respectively, this study will 
explore the possible causal role of mystical and spiritual 
experiences  induced  by  psychedelic  and  related  com-
pounds  in  the  treatment  of  anxiety  and  depression  in 
cancer patients.

Death Attitudes Profile Revised (DAP‑R)  The DAP-R is 
a 32-item self-report scale that measures attitude towards 
death.  It  consists  of  several  statements  related  to  differ-
ent attitudes towards death [85]. Response categories are 
scored  from  1  to  7  (1 = strongly  disagree  to  7 = strongly 
agree). There  are  five  dimensions  in  the  DAP-R,  Fear  of 
Death  (7  items),  Death  Avoidance  (5  items),  Neutral 
Acceptance  (5  items),  Approach  Acceptance  (10  items) 
and Escape Acceptance (5 items). For each dimension, a 
mean  scale  score  can  be  computed  by  dividing  the  total 
scale  score  by  the  number  of  items  forming  each  scale. 
Cronbach’s  alpha  of  the  DAP-R  dimensions  range  from 
0.65  (Neutral  Acceptance)  to  0.97  (Approach  Accept-
ance)  and  stability  coefficients  range  from  0.61  (Death 
Avoidance)  to  0.95  (Approach  Acceptance).  Overall,  the 
scale  demonstrates  very  good  reliability  and  requires 
5  min  for  completion  [86].  The  DAP-R  will  allow  for 
exploration  of  the  changes  in  these  broader  existential 

Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336

concerns faced at the end of life. The DAP-R will be com-
pleted at baseline and at the final follow-up visit.

completed at baseline and at 1 day, 2 weeks and 4 weeks 
post-experimental session.

Big Five Inventory‑2 (BFI‑2)  The BFI-2 is a 60-item scale 
which  takes  about  10  min  to  complete  and  is  based  on 
the  five-factor  model  of  personality  that  includes  the 
following  trait  dimensions:  Neuroticism,  Extraversion, 
Openness  to  Experience,  Agreeableness  and  Conscien-
tiousness  [87].  Further,  this  inventory  operationalises  a 
hierarchical  conceptualisation  of  15  specific  facet  traits, 
three  within  each  domain,  guided  by  previous  research 
on  hierarchical  personality  structure  and  measure-
ment [88–92]. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale 
(1 = disagree  strongly  to  5 = agree  strongly)  with  reverse 
option wording across some items. Scores are calculated 
for each domain and facet trait through item aggregation. 
When tested, the BFI-2 five domain scales had alpha reli-
abilities of 0.83 to 0.85 between samples, and retest reli-
abilities of 0.76, indicating high reliability. The alpha reli-
abilities  for  the  15  facet  scales  ranged  from  0.66  to  0.85 
in each sample, with retest reliabilities ranging from 0.66 
to  0.83  indicating  adequate  to  high  reliability.  Absolute 
correlations between domain scales averaged 0.20 to 0.24 
between  samples.  For  facet  traits,  within-domain  corre-
lations averaged 0.54 to 0.55, whereas absolute between-
domain  correlations  averaged  between  0.16  and  0.19 
between  samples.  Taken  together,  these  results  reflect 
strong  discrimination  between  the  BFI-2  domains  and 
moderate  discrimination  among  the  facets  within  each 
domain [87].

As  outlined  earlier,  like  psilocybin,  MDMA  has  previ-
ously been shown to increase measures of the personality 
domain “openness” [18, 19]. The BFI-2 will allow exami-
nation  of  the  extent  and  possible  causal  role  of  changes 
in personality dimensions, such as openness, induced by 
MDMA  in  the  treatment  of  anxiety  and  depression  in 
cancer  patients  and  enable  comparisons  with  psilocybin 
in  this  regard.  The  BFI-2  will  be  completed  at  baseline 
and at the final follow-up visit.

Hua Oranga  The Hua Oranga is based on the four com-
ponents of Te Whare Tapa Whā, a Māori model of health 
[93–95]. These four components are as follows: Wairua—
spirit,  Hinengaro—mind,  Tinana—body  and  Whānau—
family.  The  components  are  connected  and  contribute 
to Māori holistic health and wellbeing, such that deficits 
in any one area would be viewed as unhealthy. The self-
rated version (tāngata whai ora) will be completed in this 
study and requires 10 min to complete. The Hua Oranga 
will  examine  changes  in  these  broader  health  and  well-
being  outcomes  in  a  culturally  relevant  manner  to  the 
Aotearoa/New Zealand context. The Hua Oranga will be 

Watts  Connectedness  Scale  (WCS)  The  WCS  is  a 
19-item  self-report  scale  that  measures  connectedness 
to  self,  others  and  the  world  [96].  Previous  participants 
of studies investigating psychedelic-assisted therapy have 
reported renewed self-worth, a shift to feeling more con-
nected  with  others  and  a  new  appreciation  of  the  world 
we live in [97]. Given the relevance of these factors at the 
end  of  life,  the  WCS  will  examine  any  changes  induced 
by MDMA and any causal role in the treatment of anxi-
ety and depression in these patients. The scale has been 
adapted  for  the  New  Zealand  context  by  Alesha  Wells 
and  colleagues  at  The  University  of  Auckland  with  the 
addition  of  Māori  terms  and  two  new  items  that  assess 
connection to whakapapa (ancestry) and whenua (land). 
The  WCS  will  be  completed  at  baseline  and  at  1  day, 
2 weeks and 4 weeks post-experimental session.

Demoralization Scale‑II (DS‑II)  The DS-II is a 16-item 
self-report  scale  for  measuring  demoralisation.  The 
original  Demoralization  Scale  was  a  24-item  self-report 
measure to capture the important expression of existen-
tial distress in palliative care [98]. The refined DS-II was 
developed  with  a  reduced  number  of  items  and  simpli-
fied  response  format  to  facilitate  a  more  user-friendly 
measure  of  demoralisation  in  the  advanced  care  setting 
[99,  100].  It  is  based  on  a  2-factor  model,  comprising 
two  8-item  factors:  Meaning  and  Purpose,  and  Distress 
and Coping Ability. Each item is rated on a 3-point Lik-
ert  scale,  scored  from  0  to  2  (0 = never,  1 = sometimes 
and 2 = often). Higher scores are indicative of higher lev-
els of demoralisation. A total score is summed from the 
items and can range from 0 to 32. The DS-II has demon-
strated good internal validity for all patients (Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.89)  and  test–retest  reliability  in  symptomati-
cally  stable  patients  (intraclass  correlation = 0.80).  The 
DS-II  will  therefore  enable  exploration  of  these  impor-
tant  existential  concerns  faced  at  the  end  of  life.  The 
DS-II will be completed at baseline and at 1 day, 2 weeks 
and 4 weeks post-experimental session.

Expectations

It  is  important  to  investigate  participant  expectations 
as  they  are  likely  to  impact  experience.  In  addition,  sig-
nificant  effects  from  the  presence  and  impact  of  the 
research  and  researchers  are  to  be  expected.  The  pla-
cebo  effect,  enhanced  by  expectancy  bias,  is  a  major 
obstacle  to  objective  outcome  measurements  and  the 
scientific  understanding  of  the  causal  mechanisms  of 
any therapeutic effect [101]. To control for such factors, 

 Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336 

Page 16 of 29

participant  expectations  will  be  assessed  using  a  modi-
fied version of an expectancy questionnaire that has been 
previously used in the evaluation of psychedelic therapies 
[102]. This will be completed prior to receiving the dose 
on the day of the experimental session.

Qualitative interview

We  aim  to  gain  a  richer  understanding  of  participant’s 
experience of MDMA-assisted therapy and their experi-
ence of trial participation through a qualitative interview 
with their nominated support person (for example, a fam-
ily member, spouse or close friend). This interview will be 
conducted  by  a  researcher  who  is  independent  from  all 
other  aspects  of  trial  delivery.  Support  has  been  shown 
to  improve  outcomes  for  all  parties  in  cancer  research 
[103].  MDMA  has  also  been  shown  to  elicit  improve-
ments  in  relationships  that  may  provide  additional  ben-
efit  to  participants.  Early  research  on  MDMA-assisted 
therapy targeted couples, demonstrating enhanced intro-
spection  and  communication  between  partners  [15,  16]. 
More recent work has built on these findings, supporting 
general  improvements  in  relationships  with  close  loved 
ones  for  those  with  PTSD  [104–106].  This  qualitative 
interview will comprise a semi-structured interview that 
assesses the experience of both the cancer patient partici-
pant and their support person, relational changes and the 
experience of both parties of being involved in the trial. 
This will be completed at the final follow-up visit.

All primary and secondary outcomes will be measured 
by change from baseline and between treatment groups. 
Regarding  exploratory  outcomes,  the  expectancy  ques-
tionnaire  and  MEQ  30  will  be  measured  only  once  per 
participant, both during the day of the experimental ses-
sion and compared between treatment groups. All other 
quantitative  exploratory  outcomes  will  be  measured 
by  their  change  from  baseline  and  between  treatment 
groups.

Safety measures

Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI)  
As previously outlined, modern clinical trials of MDMA-
assisted  therapy  have  shown  few,  serious  adverse  psy-
chological  effects.  However,  these  trials  have  often 
excluded  patients  with  personal  or  family  histories  of 
other  concerning  serious  mental  health  features  such 
bipolar or psychotic disorders, thereby limiting the abil-
ity to quantify or exclude these potential risks. Therefore,  
careful psychiatric interview will help identify individuals 
at who may be vulnerable or at elevated risk of develop-
ing these adverse psychological effects. This will include  
utilising  the  MINI  [107].  The  MINI  is  a  structured 
diagnostic  interview  for  psychiatric  disorders.  It  takes 

approximately 15 min to complete. It has shown positive 
results regarding validity and reliability in eliciting symp-
toms criteria used in making psychiatric disorder diagno-
ses. Interrater kappa values were above 0.79 for all diag-
noses, with 70% being 0.90 or higher, indicating excellent 
interrater  reliability.  Test/retest  kappa  values  were  over 
0.75  for  14  of  the  23  values,  and  only  one  value  below 
0.45, indicating very good retest reliability. The MINI will 
be completed at the screening visit.

Columbia‑suicide  severity  rating  scale  (C‑SSRS)  Given 
the inclusion of participants with depression and anxiety, 
it  is  important  to  screen  for  and  monitor  suicidal  risk, 
including how MDMA-assisted therapy may impact this. 
The C-SSRS is a clinician-administered measure used to 
identify and assess individuals at risk for suicide. It meas-
ures four constructs including suicide ideation, intensity 
of  ideation,  behaviour  and  lethality.  There  are  different 
scale  versions  available  including  a  Lifetime  version  and 
a Since Last Visit version. The scale is made up of 10 cat-
egories with a binary yes/no answer format and includes 
follow‐up inquiries if a yes answer is given; the measure 
requires  about  10  min  for  administration.  The  C-SSRS 
intensity scale for Lifetime has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.93 
and the Since Last Visit version 0.94, suggesting excellent 
reliability  [59].  The  Lifetime  version  of  the  scale  will  be 
administered at baseline. The Since Last Visit version will 
be administered at the final follow-up visit and whenever 
indicated during the study at clinician discretion if con-
cerns regarding suicidality arise.

Australian‑modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS)  
The  AKPS  is  an  adapted  version  of  the  gold  standard  
Karnofsky  Performance  Status  and  the  Thorne- 
modified  Karnofsky  Performance  Status.  It  is  a  clinician-
rated  measure  assessing  overall  performance  status  or  
ability  to  perform  activities  of  daily  living.  It  is  widely 
used in palliative care settings in Australia and New Zea-
land and is therefore useful to monitor in cancer patients 
during  this  trial.  A  single  score  between  10  and  100  is 
provided based on the clinician’s observations of the par-
ticipant’s ability to perform activities of daily living, work 
and  self-care.  A  score  of  100  indicates  normal  physi-
cal  abilities  with  no  evidence  of  disease  whilst  decreas-
ing  numbers  indicate  reduced  ability  [60].  AKPS  will  be 
recorded  at  baseline,  first  therapy  session,  experimental 
session and all follow-up visits.

Medical evaluation

MDMA is known to transiently increase heart rate, blood 
pressure  and  temperature  in  a  dose-dependent  manner 
that  is  generally  not  problematic  for  physically  healthy 

Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336 

Page 17 of 29

individuals.  However,  clinical  research  into  MDMA 
remains  nascent  and  additional  potential  medical  risks, 
including  risks  to  pregnancy,  are  not  known.  Moreover, 
this  study  will  examine  the  effects  of  MDMA  in  cancer 
patients  who  are  likely  to  experience  associated  physi-
cal  health  symptoms,  underlying  medical  comorbidities 
and  medications  which  may  increase  the  propensity  for 
adverse  effects  and  interactions.  It  is  therefore  impor-
tant to conduct a thorough medical screening to ensure 
participants  at  significantly  elevated  risk  are  excluded. 
The medical evaluation will be completed at the screen-
ing  visit,  as  required  in  response  to  an  adverse  event, 
or  as  clinically  indicated.  This  baseline  evaluation  will 
comprise:

•  Physician assessment of medical and surgical history.
•  A  total  body  examination  including  general  appear-
ance,  skin,  neck,  thyroid,  eyes,  ears,  nose,  throat, 
lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremi-
ties and basic nervous system.

•  Blood  tests  including  full  blood  count,  electrolytes, 
liver  function  tests,  creatinine,  thyroid  function  and 
serum pregnancy test if applicable.

•  Urine  drug  screen  to  assess  for  and  mitigate  risks 
associated with substance misuse or interactions.
•  12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  to  assess  for  any 
pre-existing  evidence  of  cardiac  disease  or  arrhyth-
mia.

•  Vital signs including weight, body temperature, blood 
pressure,  pulse  and  oxygen  saturations  (on  air).  In 
addition to recording these at baseline, these will also 
be  recorded  multiple  times  during  the  experimental 
session  and  once  on  the  day  following  the  experi-
mental session.

•  Concomitant  medications  will  be  recorded  at  base-
line,  experimental  session  and  all  follow-up  visits  to 
assess for and mitigate risks associated with medica-
tion  interactions,  such  as  serotonin  syndrome  and 
QT/QTc prolongation.

Adverse events

All  adverse  events  captured  by  the  above  measures  or 
otherwise  will  be  recorded  on  the  adverse  events  form 
completed  at  each  visit  following  screening,  including 
multiple times during the day of the experimental session 
to closely detect any treatment-emergent adverse events 
during the acute effects of the medication.

Participant timeline {13}

Participant timeline is shown in Fig. 1.

Sample size {14}

The  phase  2  study  on  MDMA-assisted  therapy  for 
patients  with  life-threatening  illness  (mainly  terminal 
cancer)  and  associated  anxiety  reported  a  mean  differ-
ence of 14.7 (standard deviation [SD] = 14) in Spielberger 
Trait  Anxiety  Index,  with  13  treated  with  MDMA  and 
five  treated  with  placebo  [55].  Based  on  these  findings 
and  with  16  subjects  in  each  arm,  we  calculate  that  our 
study has 82% power to detect a difference between treat-
ment arms, with alpha = 0.05.

Recruitment {15}

General  practitioners,  Hospice  New  Zealand,  hospi-
tal  oncology  services  and  palliative  care  doctors  outside 
these settings will be approached and provided informa-
tion, the participant information sheet and a pre-screen-
ing referral form to help identify and refer patients with 
a  diagnosis  of  life-threatening  or  other  advanced-stage 
cancer  and  associated  depression  and  anxiety.  Partici-
pants will be sent study information and given the oppor-
tunity  to  discuss  this  with  the  research  team  prior  to 
recruitment.  There  will  be  no  cost  to  participate  in  this 
research  study.  If  required,  parking  and  travel  costs  will 
be  reimbursed.  Further  strategies  to  promote  recruit-
ment  will  include  a  study  website  for  referrers  and  par-
ticipants, and a press release upon commencement of the 
study.

Assignment of interventions: allocation
Sequence generation {16a}

On the day of the experimental session, participants will 
be  randomised  in  1:1  allocation  in  a  blinded  fashion  to 
the  MDMA-assisted  therapy  group  or  the  methylpheni-
date-assisted therapy group, stratified by clinical site and 
gender.  A  computer-generated  randomisation  schedule 
will be used to assign subjects to treatments in a 1:1 ratio.

Concealment mechanism {16b}

Randomisation  will  be  managed  via  an  Interactive  Web 
Response  System  (IWRS)  based  on  a  centralised  ran-
domisation schedule developed by an independent third-
party  vendor  to  maintain  blinding.  Enclosed  treatment 
assignments will be serially numbered in opaque, sealed 
envelopes and opened sequentially after the participant’s 
name and other details have been written on the appro-
priate envelope [108].

Implementation {16c}

The  principal  investigator  will  enrol  participants  once 
confirming  that  all  eligibility  criteria  have  been  met. 
A  member  of  the  research  team  who  is  independent  to

Page 19 of 29

any  screening,  data  collection,  outcome  measurement, 
therapy  or  clinical  support  will  assign  participants  to 
interventions.

Assignment of interventions: blinding
Who will be blinded {17a}

entered into the database will be coded using the World 
Health Organisation Drug Reference List, which employs 
the  Anatomical Therapeutic  Chemical  classification  sys-
tem. Coexistent disease and adverse events will be coded 
using  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities 
terminology.

Participants,  site  staff  and  the  sponsor-investigator  will 
remain  blinded  to  subject  group  assignment  until  after 
database lock at the end of the study.

During  the  experimental  session  and  all  surrounding 
therapy sessions (Visits 2 to 5), the therapists will collect 
the scheduled outcome measures and safety data.

To  further  minimise  bias  in  measuring  treatment  effi-
cacy,  the  sponsor-investigator  will  use  blinded  staff  not 
directly  involved  in  therapy  to  administer  the  primary 
outcome  measure  via  in-person,  live  video  or  phone 
interviews.  The  raters  are  blinded  to  treatment  assign-
ment  and  will  only  evaluate  participants  at  baseline  and 
at  the  assessments  scheduled  after  their  experimental 
session. Participants will be instructed to withhold their 
opinion  on  treatment  group  assignment  from  raters. 
The  participants,  MAPS  PBC  and  site  staff  will  not  see 
unblinded  primary  outcome  measure  results  until  after 
database  lock  at  the  end  of  the  study.  Changes  in  study 
management  and  analysis,  if  any,  will  be  made  by  the 
primary  investigator,  site  staff  or  study  physician  who 
are  blinded  to  group  assignment  and  primary  outcome 
measure data.

The efficacy of the blinding will be measured by asking 
therapists and participants to rate their opinion on treat-
ment group assignment and the confidence of their guess 
by  using  a  3-point  Likert  scale  at  the  conclusion  of  the 
experimental session.

Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b}

If there is an emergency requiring knowledge of a partici-
pant’s allocation, the blind may be broken for an individ-
ual  participant  through  the  IWRS.  Upon  database  lock, 
the study will be unblinded and participants will be noti-
fied of treatment assignment.

Data collection and management
Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a}

A  registered  nurse  or  research  assistant  at  each  site  will 
conduct  the  12-lead  ECG,  height,  weight,  vitals,  urine 
drug  screen  and  all  baseline  instruments  required  for 
eligibility during the screening visit (Visit 1). Remaining, 
scheduled self-administered instruments will be emailed 
to the participant to complete following this visit. Labo-
ratory samples will be taken and processed by LabTests, 
Auckland and Southern Community Labs, Dunedin. Psy-
chological screening via the MINI and medical screening 
for  previous  medical  and  surgical  history,  concomitant 
medications,  physical  examination  and  interpretation 
of  all  medical  investigations  will  be  undertaken  by  the 
study  physician  at  each  site.  Concomitant  medications 

Scheduled  outcome  measures  and  safety  data  for 
the  follow-up  visits  (Visits  6  to  9)  will  be  collected  by  a 
research  assistant  either  in-person  or  via  audio-visual 
meetings.  Training  on  how  to  use  the  instruments  and 
forms will be provided to site staff at both the Auckland 
and  Dunedin  sites.  Scheduled  self-administered  instru-
ments will continue to be emailed to the participant fol-
lowing each visit.

The  participant  will  be  given  sufficient  space  and 
time  to  complete  the  questionnaires.  The  study  coor-
dinator  will  check  the  questionnaire  for  completeness 
and  encourage  the  participant  to  complete  any  miss-
ing  responses.  The  scoring  of  the  questionnaires  will  be 
handled  as  specified  by  the  instrument  developers.  A 
description of these instruments, including reliability and 
validity, where known, has been provided earlier.

It is the investigator’s or study team member’s responsi-
bility to ensure completion of the case report form (CRF) 
for  each  enrolled  study  participant.  The  staff  member’s 
signature  on  the  CRF,  either  in  writing  on  paper-based 
CRFs  or  via  electronic  confirmation  on  the  electronic 
CRF,  serves  to  attest  that  the  information  contained  in 
the  CRF  is  true,  accurate  and  reliable.  At  all  times,  the 
investigator  has  full  responsibility  for  the  accuracy,  leg-
ibility, completeness and timeliness of all data.

Plans to promote participant retention and complete 
follow-up {18b}

Participants will be supported throughout the study with 
the therapists and clinical support team available by tel-
ephone during business hours. In addition, there will be 
an  on-call  telephone  support  service  from  the  start  of 
the  MDMA-assisted  therapy  session  until  the  following 
morning  (24  h).  Participants  who  discontinue  the  study 
treatment will continue to have the final assessments.

A  participant  is  considered  “evaluable”  and  eligible 
for  the  modified  intention-to-treat  (mITT)  analysis  if 
they have completed the experimental session and three 
MADRS assessments in total. A participant is considered 
“evaluable and completed per protocol” if they have com-
pleted  the  experimental  sessions  and  all  assessments  as 
planned. These participants will be included in the mITT 
analysis  set  and  the  per  protocol  analysis  set.  A  partici-
pant  is  considered  “evaluable  and  early  termination”  if 

 Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336 

Page 20 of 29

they have completed the experimental session and three 
MADRS assessments in total but terminated early. These 
participants  will  be  included  in  the  mITT  analysis.  A 
participant is considered to be in good standing with the 
clinical  site  if,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  and/or 
therapy team, the participant was compliant with proto-
col requirements, even if they were unable to complete all 
study visits.

Data management {19}

Each  participant  will  have  a  study  file  that  contains  the 
paper-based CRF and source documents, whilst the bulk 
of  the  data  capture  and  the  CRF  will  be  managed  via 
the  online  Research  Electronic  Data  Capture  (REDCap) 
software  hosted  at  the  University  of  Auckland  [109]. 
REDCap is a secure, browser-based application for man-
aging online surveys and databases. Paper-based files will 
include  results  from  psychological  and  medical  screen-
ing  and  investigations.  These  will  be  appended  to  each 
participant’s  paper-based  CRF,  and  key  findings  entered 
into REDCap. Relevant data from the participant eligibil-
ity criteria, demographics, height, weight, vitals, adverse 
events, concomitant medications, laboratory tests, blind-
ing  assessment,  expectancy  questionnaire,  MADRS, 
HAM-A,  HADS,  IPOS,  MEQ30,  FACIT-Sp-12,  DAP-
R,  BFI-2,  WCS,  Hua  Oranga,  DS-II,  AKPS,  MINI  and 
C-SSRS will be entered directly into REDCap.

Audio-visual  recordings  of  experimental  sessions 
will  be  transferred  and  stored  using  encrypted,  secure 
technology  in  password-protected  files.  These  record-
ings  will  also  be  shared  overseas  to  USA  to  MAPS  PBC 
using secure encrypted technology platforms strictly for 
certification  of  training  by  specified  MAPS  supervisors. 
Due to the sensitivity of this material, all video data will 
be  held  on  secure  encrypted  databases  and  transferred 
using secure encrypted digital platforms in line with the 
MAPS privacy policy. Shared video content will be pass-
word-protected,  non-downloadable  and  time-limited. 
Qualitative interviews will be audio recorded via zoom to 
a local device, whether the interview is online or in per-
son. These recordings will also be stored on a University 
server  in  password-protected  files  and  deleted  once  the 
interview  has  been  transcribed.  Transcripts  will  be  de-
identified.  Participants  will  be  given  the  opportunity  to 
read  their  transcript  and  request  changes  or  withdraw 
their  data  up  to  14  days  after  being  provided  with  the 
transcript.  Experimental  session  recordings  and  qualita-
tive transcripts will be stored securely on the University 
server in password-protected files and kept for 10 years, 
after which it will be destroyed according to the Univer-
sity research code of conduct guidelines.

Data  management  will  be  carried  out  to  a  standard 
of  security  and  confidentiality  consistent  with  Good 

Clinical Practice (GCP). Data will be handled only by the 
research  team  and  will  be  held  at  the  Faculty  of  Medi-
cal and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, and the 
Department  of  Psychological  Medicine,  University  of 
Otago. An original, unprocessed version of every data file 
will  be  kept  on  the  REDCap  servers  which  may  only  be 
modified  by  a  University  of  Auckland  information  tech-
nology  systems  administrator,  ensuring  the  fidelity  and 
audit capability of all electronic data.

The  investigator  must  ensure  that  the  information 
required by the protocol must be entered onto the CRF. 
The  investigator  must  maintain  source  documents  for 
each  participant  in  the  study,  consisting  of  all  demo-
graphic  information,  medical  and  psychological  screen-
ing,  medical  investigations  and  the  signed  informed 
consent  form.  All  information  on  CRFs  must  be  trace-
able  to  these  source  documents  in  the  participant’s  file. 
All paper-based CRFs and source data documents will be 
scanned and held on servers in password-protected files 
to ensure fidelity of these data and allow future audit of 
extracted data.

Confidentiality {27}

All  identifiable  data  from  paper-based  files  and  source 
documents  will  be  converted  to  a  de-identified  form 
at  the  study  site,  at  which  point  it  is  entered  into  RED-
Cap.  De-identified  data  will  carry  a  unique  trial-specific 
number.  Only  these  unique  study  numbers  will  identify 
participants  on  REDCap.  The  investigator  will  retain  a 
log  linking  participant  code  with  identifiers.  After  the 
database  has  been  declared  to  be  complete  and  accu-
rate,  it  will  be  locked,  and  the  treatment  codes  will  be 
un-blinded  and  made  available  for  data  analysis.  The 
de-identified  database  will  remain  on  the  University  of 
Auckland server for 10 years.

The  paper-based  CRFs  will  be  stored  in  locked  fil-
ing  cabinets  in  locked  rooms,  throughout  the  study.  On 
completion  of  the  study,  scanned  and  electronic  study-
specific source documents will be archived on password-
protected servers, and paper-based CRFs will be archived 
in  sealed  file  boxes  and  locked  in  archive  cupboards. 
Source  documents  will  be  retained  for  at  least  10  years 
then destroyed by secure shredding and deleting of docu-
ments from protected databases.

All  information  generated  in  this  study  must  be  con-
sidered  confidential  and  must  not  be  disclosed  to  any 
persons not directly concerned with the study except as 
outlined below.

Identifiable data and tissue may be accessed by the fol-

lowing groups:

•  The  investigator  and  designated  study  staff  to  fulfil 

protocol requirements.

Rarely,  it  may  be  necessary  for  the  investigator  to 
share identifiable data with people or groups not listed 
above—for example, in the event of a serious threat to 
public  health  or  safety,  to  the  life  or  health  of  the  par-
ticipant or another person, or if the data is required for 
certain legal situations.

The  blood  test  results  are  required  to  be  identifiable 
to  ensure  that  in  the  event  of  major  deficiencies  or 
abnormalities,  the  participant’s  healthcare  providers 
will  have  access  to  relevant  information.  LabTests  and 
Southern  Community  Labs  will  not  be  authorised  to 
share  data  and/or  tissue  with  third  parties.  The  study 
team will advise participants of relevant lab results and 
any incidental findings.

De-identified  data  and  tissue  will  be  accessed  and 

used by the following groups:

•  The  investigator  and  suitably  trained  and  experi-

enced study staff, to conduct the study.

•  The  LabTests  or  Southern  Community  Labs  for 
sample processing, analysis and reporting purposes.

•  HDEC to comply with legal and regulatory duties.
•  Health,  regulatory  or  government  authorities,  to 

comply with legal and regulatory duties.

•  De-identified  anonymised  safety  data  will  be  sent 
overseas  to  MAPS  PBC  for  analysis.  Participants 
will be informed of the potential risks and cultural 
issues  associated  with  sending  and  storing  data 
overseas,  and  that  there  may  be  no  New  Zealand 
representation on overseas governance committees.

De-identified data may be included in published study 
results  including,  but  not  limited  to,  peer-reviewed 
publications,  clinical  trial  registry  websites,  scientific 
meetings and regulatory or marketing submissions.

De-identified  data  may  be  made  available  to  other 
researchers  on  request  for  future  research  as  specified 
above and/or will be added to data from other sources to 
form larger datasets.

The Site Investigator has overall responsibility for data 
privacy  and  confidentiality.  Any  breaches  of  privacy 
would  constitute  a  major  breach  of  protocol  and  would 
be  reported  to  the  NBHDEC. The  breach  would  be  dis-
cussed with any affected participants and they would be 
given an opportunity to withdraw consent for their data 
to be used.

Participants  have  the  right  to  access  and  correct  their 
data. When participants provide informed consent, they 
either  agree  or  disagree  to  their  data  to  continue  to  be 
used if they withdraw or are withdrawn from the study. If 
they do not provide consent, all data collected up to that 
point in the study will be destroyed.

Plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage 
of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis 
in this trial/future use {33}

Data will be collected from the following sources:

•  Direct communication with the participant.
•  Study  assessments,  including  laboratory  test  results, 
biomedical  monitoring,  questionnaires,  interviews 
and examination.

•  Video  recordings  of  MDMA-assisted  therapy  ses-

sions.

•  Audio  recordings  of  qualitative  interviews  with  the 

participant and elected support person.
•  Participant medical records (if indicated).
•  Communications with participant’s clinical care team 

(if indicated).

Tissue will be collected as follows:

•  Urine samples will be collected from each participant 
on screening day. The results of the urine drug analy-
sis will be recorded, and the urine sample will be dis-
posed of as per policy guidelines.

•  Blood samples will be collected to screen for partici-
pant’s health. Participants will be referred to LabTests 
or Southern Community Labs for blood testing. The 
laboratories  are  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP) 
compliant. The facilities are secure with tissue access 
restricted  to  those  staff  directly  involved  in  their 
analysis. The results from these tests will be recorded 
and  the  blood  collected  will  be  disposed  of  as  per 
LabTest or Southern Community Labs policy guide-
lines.

•  Data  and  tissue  will  be  collected  primarily  by  the 
investigator  or  designated  study  staff.  All  study  per-

 Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336

sonnel  involved  in  data  and  tissue  collection  will  be 
trained  in  GCP,  the  study  protocol  and  collection 
requirements.

•  Data  generating  assessments  may  be  performed  by 
external third parties suitably qualified by education, 
training and experience.

De-identified  tissue  will  be  used  for  analyses  as 
described  in  this  protocol  for  screening  purposes  only. 
No  tissue  samples  will  be  kept  for  the  purposes  of  the 
study or for further analysis.

In  all  cases,  the  sponsor  must  be  satisfied  that  appro-
priate data and tissue management plans are in place and 
that ethical approval for use has been obtained in accord-
ance with local laws and regulations.

Study  data  and  tissue  analysis  may  lead  to  discoveries 
and inventions or development of a commercial product. 
The  rights  to  these  will  belong  to  the  sponsor.  Partici-
pants  will  not  receive  any  financial  benefits  or  compen-
sation  from,  nor  have  any  rights  to,  any  developments, 
inventions or other discoveries arising from this analysis.
Consultation  regarding  data  and  tissue  management 
has  been  undertaken  with  the  NBHDEC  and  local  Dis-
trict Health Board locality approval panels including for-
mal Māori consultation.

Statistical methods
Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes 
{20a}

Demographic  and  other  baseline  data  (including  dis-
ease  characteristics)  will  be  listed  in  detail.  Subjective 
and  objective  data  will  be  summarised  by  appropriate 
descriptive statistics for each treatment group.

Change  in  the  primary  outcome  measure,  MADRS 
from pre-dose to the 28th day post-dose, will be assessed 
with  a  mixed  model  repeated  measures  method,  with 
treatment,  time  and  the  interaction  of  treatment  with 
time as fixed effects, subject as random effect and base-
line  MADRS  as  covariates.  The  least  square  mean  dif-
ferences  between  MDMA  and  active  placebo  will  be 
presented along with a 95% confidence interval. The same 
approach will be undertaken for the secondary outcome 
measures  (HAM-A  and  HADS).  A  within-group  mean-
ingful  change  in  MADRS  score  will  be  6  points,  and  a 
between-group  meaningful  difference  in  MADRS  score 
will be 2 points.

Data  will  be  analysed  using  the  Statistical  Package  for 

Social Scientists [110].

Interim analyses {21b}

A  prespecified  interim  analysis  plan  will  be  devel-
oped  and  finalised  separate  from  this  protocol.  This 
will  be  conducted  after  n = 12  and  will  be  included  in 

the  statistical  analysis  plan.  This  will  include  review  of 
unblinded  data  by  a  statistician  not  involved  with  the 
EMMAC study, to assist in resizing the study if necessary. 
The  principal  investigator  will  be  designated  to  receive 
written  communication  of  recommendations  follow-
ing  the  interim  review  of  the  trial.  This  communication 
will  be  limited  to  the  results  needed  for  the  decision  of 
sample size re-estimation. No recommendations for early 
termination  for  efficacy  or  any  other  adaptations  to  the 
study design will be made based on this interim analysis. 
The principal investigator will make the final decision to 
terminate the trial.

Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) 
{20b}

Exploratory  post  hoc  analyses  will  be  completed.  This 
will  include  analysing  the  exploratory  outcomes  includ-
ing the IPOS, MEQ30, FACIT-Sp-12, DAP-R, BFI-2, Hua 
Oranga,  WCS,  DS-II  and  expectations.  A  detailed  sta-
tistical analysis plan for these remaining outcome meas-
ures  will  be  developed  and  finalised  separate  from  this 
protocol.

Self-reported  outcome  measures  and  the  qualitative 
interview  provide  participants  and  investigators  with 
additional  subjective  information  about  the  impact  of 
a  given  treatment  on  various  facets  of  the  participant’s 
life.  These  are  intended  to  assess  symptoms,  function-
ing, health-related quality of life, overall quality of life or 
combinations of these outcomes.

Qualitative  analysis  will  be  conducted  for  emergent 
themes arising via audio-visual recordings of the experi-
mental session and content analysis from the qualitative 
interview  regarding  the  experimental  and  therapy  ses-
sions.  This  will  be  anlaysed  via  thematic  analysis,  a  sys-
tematic  process  for  identifying  patterns  in  qualitative 
data [111].

Methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence 
and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c}

Analyses  of  all  efficacy  endpoints  will  be  based  on  the 
full analysis set (all evaluable randomised participants in 
the study) defined according to the treatment they were 
assigned  to  at  randomisation  in  keeping  with  the  mITT 
principle.

Safety  analysis  will  be  performed  for  the  safety  analy-
sis  population  which  consists  of  all  participants  who 
received at least one dose of any of the study drugs with 
a valid post-baseline assessment. Participants will be ana-
lysed according to the treatment received.

Missing data will be managed by using multiple impu-

tation methods.

Plans to give access to the full protocol, participant-level 
data and statistical code {31c}

The  corresponding  author  will  release  documenta-
tion including the full protocol, consent forms, patient 
information  sheet  and  study  advertisements  on  publi-
cation  of  trial  results.  Access  to  the  final  trial  dataset 
will  only  be  available  to  the  study  investigators,  DMC 
and  any  other  relevant  regulatory  bodies.  Statistical 
code and de-identified databases will be made available 
upon reasonable request.

Oversight and monitoring
Composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering 
committee {5d}

The  Trial  Steering  Committee  (TSC)  will  comprise  all 
authors  listed  and  provide  overall  supervision  of  the 
trial. In particular, the TSC will collaboratively develop 
and approve the final protocol; oversee the progress of 
the  trial,  adherence  to  the  protocol,  participant  safety 
and consideration of new information; and be responsi-
ble for publication and dissemination.

The  study  team  has  expertise  in  relevant  disciplines, 
including  psychiatry,  palliative  care,  psychopharma-
cology,  psychological  therapies,  pharmacy  and  for-
mulation,  safety  assessment,  setting  up  and  running 
clinical trials, database creation and statistical analysis. 
We  believe  this  breadth  of  expertise  is  necessary  and 
appropriate  for  a  safe  and  ethical  study  according  to 
this protocol.

Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role 
and reporting structure {21a}

An internal Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be 
established  to  review  safety  and  efficacy.  The  DMC  will 
act in an advisory capacity to the sponsor-investigator to 
monitor  participant  safety,  data  quality  and  review  out-
comes to ensure the trial is conducted safely and ethically 
and meets endpoint objectives. The DMC will be the only 
group reviewing group-unblinded interim data.

The composition of DMC members and its processes 
will  be  established  in  a  separate  DMC  charter.  DMC 
meetings  will  be  held  at  least  once  every  6  months, 
or  more  frequently  based  on  rate  of  recruitment,  or  if 
there  are  concerns  about  study  conduct,  safety,  data 
integrity or other aspects of GCP.

Adverse event reporting and harms {22}

Comprehensive  study  procedures,  medical  screening 
and  eligibility  criteria  have  been  developed  based  on 
phase  2  clinical  trials  to  exclude  potential  participants 
with  pre-existing  exclusionary  medical  conditions  that 
would exacerbate risk.

Proper preparation and follow-up support will reduce 
the  difficulties  participants  might  have  with  acute  or 
sub-acute  psychological  reactions.  The  potential  for 
destabilising  psychological  distress  will  be  minimised 
by:

•  Psychiatric  screening  and  excluding  people  who 
might be more vulnerable to it (such as people diag-
nosed  with  bipolar  affective  disorder  type  1  or  with 
psychotic disorders).

•  Preparatory sessions of non-drug therapy before the 

experimental session.

•  Creating  an  atmosphere  of  trust  during  the  experi-

mental session.
•  Close monitoring.
•  Phone  contact  with  participants  during  the  week 

after the experimental session.

•  Integrative session(s).

The therapy teams and site physicians will be available 
via  mobile  phone  throughout  the  study  if  any  problem 
occurs when a participant is not at the site. In the event 
of  a  medical  emergency  or  any  other  medical  problem 
during  an  experimental  session,  the  site  physician  will 
be  immediately  available  by  telephone,  and  based  on 
assessment  of  the  situation,  they  will  make  the  decision 
to  either  evaluate  the  participant  themselves  at  the  site, 
have the therapy team call an ambulance to transport the 
participant to the emergency department or instruct the 
therapy  team  to  take  the  participant  to  the  emergency 
department.

Safety will be evaluated using adverse event reporting, 
AKPS,  C-SSRS,  MINI,  vital  signs  and  medical  assess-
ments  and  investigations.  Information  about  all  adverse 
events  will  be  collected  and  recorded  on  the  electronic 
adverse event form and followed up as appropriate.

All  adverse  events  will  be  monitored  by  the  therapy 
team  until  resolution  or,  if  the  adverse  event  becomes 
chronic, a cause can be identified. If an adverse event is 
unresolved when a participant terminates from the study, 
a  clinical  assessment  will  be  made  by  the  site  physician, 
investigator and/or study physician as to whether contin-
ued follow-up of the adverse event is warranted.

Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (new  or  worsen-
ing  from  baseline)  will  be  summarised  by  system  organ 
class,  incidence,  frequency,  severity  based  on  common 
terminology  criteria  (CTC)  grades  [112],  severity  based 
on impact on normal daily activity, type of adverse event, 
relation to the study drug by treatment arm and whether 
the event qualifies as an adverse event of special interest 
(AESI)  and/or  a  serious  adverse  event  (SAE).  Data  from 
other tests (for example, ECG or vital signs) will be listed, 
notable values will be flagged and any other information 

 Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336 

Page 24 of 29

collected will be listed as appropriate. Any statistical tests 
performed to explore the data will be used only to high-
light  any  interesting  comparisons  that  may  warrant  fur-
ther consideration.

All  SAEs  will  be  collected  from  enrolment  through 
study termination. All SAEs which occur during the trial, 
whether considered to be associated with study medica-
tion or not, will be reported to MAPS PBC within 24 h of 
the site staff ’s awareness of occurrence. All SAEs will be 
assessed for relationship, expectedness and any required 
actions  to  address  safety  at  the  time  of  reporting  of  the 
event.  SAEs  will  be  evaluated  by  the  site  physician  and 
study  physician  to  determine  if  it  is  appropriate  for  the 
participant to continue treatment or enter follow-up.

Significant life events that may occur during the study, 
including disease progression, death of a loved one, loss 
of  employment,  or  other  hardship,  may  have  an  impact 
on  treatment  outcome.  Such  events  will  be  entered  as 
comments  in  REDCap,  and  if  appropriate,  described  in 
the case study report for assessing any data outliers.

Frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23}

As mentioned, study monitoring via the internally estab-
lished  DMC  will  review  safety  and  efficacy  and  these 
meetings will occur at least once every 6 months. A mon-
itoring  report  will  be  produced  which  will  be  circulated 
to all study team members, and a copy will be placed in 
the site file.

Medsafe  and  other  regulatory  authorities  may  also 
audit  the  two  study  sites  during  or  after  the  study.  This 
will  be  independent  from  investigators  and  the  sponsor. 
The  Investigator  must  fully  cooperate  with  regulatory 
authority audits.

Plans for communicating important protocol amendments 
to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical 
committees) {25}

Protocol  amendments  will  be  submitted  to  the  DMC, 
Medsafe and the NBHDEC.

Dissemination plans {31a}

The study team recognises the importance of communi-
cating medical research and scientific data and their obli-
gations to participants enrolled in a study and, therefore, 
encourages publication of such material in reputable sci-
entific journals and at professional and/or academic sem-
inars or conferences.

Results will be submitted to national and international 
peer-reviewed  journals  for  publication,  and  presented 
locally, nationally and internationally at psychiatry, oncol-
ogy, palliative care or other relevant conferences. A final 
report will be made available for wider dissemination to 

the  public,  health  care  professionals,  policy  makers  and 
other interested groups.

It  is  understood  by  the  clinical  investigators  that  the 
information  generated  in  this  study  may  be  used  by 
MAPS  PBC  in  connection  with  the  development  of 
MDMA-assisted therapy and therefore may be disclosed 
to  government  agencies  in  various  countries.  To  allow 
for  the  use  of  information  derived  from  the  study,  it  is 
understood that the investigators may be obliged to pro-
vide MAPS PBC with de-identified study data relating to 
safety,  demographics,  dosing  and  outcomes,  and  access 
to all applicable study records, as needed.

Discussion
In New Zealand, the End of Life Choice Act 2019 enables 
assisted  dying  for  patients  in  New  Zealand,  and  came 
into force on 7 November 2021 [113]. This is in keeping 
with the expansion of assisted dying legislation and prac-
tice internationally [114]. Whilst posing professional and 
ethical  challenges  for  the  medical  profession,  this  also 
prompts  discussion  of  the  range  of  issues  experienced 
and  existing  treatment  options  available  for  patients  at 
the  end-of-life  [115,  116].  The  compounded  suffering  at 
the end-of-life and the limitations of existing treatments 
for  depression  and  anxiety  in  this  setting  provides  an 
added impetus to develop and test new treatments.

The  use  of  MDMA  in  the  setting  of  advanced-staged 
cancer is a relatively new area of study that warrants fur-
ther investigation. This study will be the first phase 2 clin-
ical trial to assess the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy 
on  mood  and  anxiety  symptoms  in  advanced-stage  can-
cer participants with an appropriate sample size, placebo 
controls, double-blinded design and validated measures.

Careful  analysis  of  the  efficacy  of  blinding  and  the 
impacts  of  the  expectancy  questionnaire  will  add  to  the 
understanding  of  the  role  of  the  placebo  effect.  Due  to 
the  significant  perceptual  effects  of  serotonergic  psych-
edelics, there is significant potential for de-blinding and 
thereby  confounding  effect  size  estimates.  Moreover, 
previous use of MDMA or methylphenidate may further 
limit the efficacy of the blind. Measurement of de-blind-
ing will allow for adjustment of this potential confound-
ing  effect.  Further,  participants,  therapists  and  all  other 
site staff will not be unblinded until after the completion 
of  the  entire  study,  mitigating  unblinding  and  nocebo 
effects by preventing participants and therapists to share 
their knowledge of whether the experiences were related 
to MDMA or the active placebo.

Media  coverage  of  MDMA-assisted  therapy  adds  to 
expectancy  in  the  general  population  from  which  we 
will  be  recruiting  participants.  By  assessing  expectancy 
at  baseline,  the  effects  of  this  expectancy  on  outcomes 
will  be  examined.  In  addition,  there  will  be  a  website 

Bhagavan et al. Trials          (2024) 25:336 

Page 25 of 29

for referrers and participants and a press release to pro-
mote  recruitment.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  ensure  bal-
ance  in  promoting  recruitment  and  information  sharing 
with neutral and unbiased information about the trial to 
mitigate  undue  or  excess  expectancy.  In  addition,  refer-
rals will only be accepted from medical professionals, not 
directly from participants, to further mitigate the impact 
of referral bias and expectancy.

The  combined  neurobiological  and  psychotherapeutic 
intervention  in  this  study  aligns  with  the  current  para-
digm  of  psychedelic-assisted  therapy  which  has  so  far 
been based on a model whereby a psychedelic substance 
is  used  as  a  catalyst  or  adjuvant  of  psychotherapeutic 
work, in the case of PTSD enabling access to and process-
ing  of  repressed  memories  and  past  traumas  [117,  118]. 
MDMA-assisted  therapy  was  developed  using  the  prin-
ciple of “inner healing intelligence” [67, 68], whereby the 
participant is given non-directive psychotherapeutic sup-
port in order to find their own psychotherapeutic insight 
and meaning from their experience. For this study, a sep-
arate  study  manual  has  been  developed  based  on  previ-
ous established manuals for MDMA-assisted therapy and 
adapted specific to the needs of participants in this end-
of-life setting in New Zealand.

The  study  will  allow  for  assessment  of  the  effects  of 
this  intervention  on  the  primary  and  secondary  out-
comes  of  depression  and  anxiety  symptoms  as  meas-
ured  by  the  MADRS,  HAM-A  and  HADS.  The  wide 
array  of  validated,  exploratory  outcome  measures  and 
across  a  breadth  of  additional  psychological,  physical, 
spiritual and quality of life domains will allow for assess-
ment  of  the  benefits  which  are  related  to  and  extend 
beyond mood and anxiety symptoms. These may include 
improvements  in  physical  symptoms,  including  pain, 
nausea,  fatigue  and  cachexia,  and  holistic  functioning 
and  wellbeing  which  are  intricately  linked  to  and  exac-
erbated  by  pathological  mental  states  in  end-of-life  set-
tings.  Further,  these  outcomes  will  allow  for  exploration 
of the possible causal role of changes in these factors in 
the treatment of anxiety and depression, such as mystical 
and  spiritual  experiences,  connectedness,  broader  exis-
tential concerns, personality traits and expectancy. These 
findings may also inform the utility and design of future 
related  studies,  including  for  depression  and  anxiety  in 
other  life-threatening  illnesses,  and  evaluating  individ-
ual  treatment  components  towards  considering  clinical 
translation and feasibility, such as comparing an MDMA-
only arm vs a therapy-only arm.

Beyond  testing  efficacy  and  assessing  exploratory  out-
comes,  the  comprehensive  eligibility  criteria,  clinical 
screening  and  safety  precautions  will  allow  for  consid-
ered  exclusion  of  participants  with  pre-existing  medical 
or  psychiatric  conditions  that  would  exacerbate  the  risk 

of  harm.  The  regular  safety  reporting  and  availability  of 
therapy  teams  and  site  physicians  throughout  the  study 
will  allow  for  prompt  action  to  address  these  concerns 
and  safety  analysis  for  better  understanding  the  risks  of 
this treatment.

Once  participants  have  completed  the  study,  they  will 
be  eligible  to  participate  in  a  planned  open-label  exten-
sion  study  where  they  will  receive  MDMA-assisted 
therapy.  This  will  ensure  all  participants  are  given  the 
opportunity  to  receive  MDMA-assisted  therapy,  fur-
ther  explore  the  effects  of  any  expectancy  and  blinding 
confounds  through  comparisons  with  their  first  treat-
ment  intervention  and  allow  for  secondary  analysis  of 
the effects of two MDMA sessions on outcome scores in 
individuals receiving MDMA for a second time.

Trial status
The EMMAC protocol is currently on version 1.10, dated 
16  October,  2023.  Recruiting  of  the  trial  commenced 
on  31  July,  2023,  and  is  expected  to  run  through  to  the 
anticipated  completion  of  the  trial  in  the  third  quarter 
of 2025. At the time of this submission, two participants 
have completed the study, and a further two are actively 
enrolled.
