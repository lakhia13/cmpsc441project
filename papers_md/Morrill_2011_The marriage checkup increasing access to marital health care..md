Abstract

Despite the ongoing prevalence of marital distress, very few couples seek therapy. Researchers and 
clinicians have increasingly been calling for innovative interventions that can reach a larger 
number of untreated couples. Based on a motivational marital health model, the Marriage Checkup 
(MC) was designed to attract couples who are unlikely to seek traditional tertiary therapy. The 
objective of the MC is to promote marital health for as broad of a population of couples as 
possible, much like regular physical health checkups. This first paper from the largest MC study to 
date examines whether the MC engaged previously unreached couples who might benefit from 
intervention. Interview and survey data suggested that the MC attracted couples across the distress 
continuum and was perceived by couples as more accessible than traditional therapy. Notably, the 
MC attracted a substantial number of couples who had not previously participated in marital 
interventions. The motivational health checkup model appeared to encourage a broad range of 
couples who might not have otherwise sought relationship services to deliberately take care of 
their marital health. Clinical implications are discussed.

It has been well established that most married couples experience deterioration in their 
relationship. Roughly half of all people in the United States marrying for the first time are 
projected to divorce, a statistic that has remained stable over the last 20 years (National 
Center for Family & Marriage Research, 2009). Research consistently suggests that marital 
distress and dissolution are linked to higher rates of mental disorders, compromised immune 
system functioning, and child emotional and behavioral problems (Berger & Hannah, 1999). 
Fortunately, meta-analyses of the existing treatment outcome literature support the efficacy 
of marital therapy, with an effect size of .84 (Shadish & Baldwin, 2003). Unfortunately, the 
vast majority of people suffering from relationship difficulties do not seek help (Johnson, 
Stanley, Glenn, et al., 2002), and those who do primarily seek assistance in physicians’ 
offices (Russell, 2010).

What prevents couples in need from seeking available therapeutic interventions? Many 
couples appear to regard marital therapy as unnecessary. They may be unaware of risk 
factors in their relationships, failing to seek services even as their “symptoms” multiply 
(Doss, Atkins & Christensen, 2003). Couples who have not yet begun to self-evaluate as 
distressed often have low motivation to seek treatment. On the other hand, severely 
distressed couples often believe their relationship is too far-gone to benefit from help 
(Wolcott, 1986). Thus, couples in need are often caught in the paradox of either believing 
that their relationship is too distressed or not distressed enough to benefit from existing 
treatments.

Other frequently cited barriers include the cost of treatment, lack of confidence in the 
outcome, a preference to solve problems on one’s own, and logistical challenges such as 
lack of time or childcare (e.g. Uebelacker et al., 2006). Negative attitudes toward help 
seeking are particularly strong barriers to underrepresented groups including men (e.g. APA; 
Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, 2004, as cited in Anker, Duncan & Sparks, 2009; 
Roberson & Fitzgerald, 1992). Several recent papers have called for the development of 
nontraditional marital interventions that are more accessible to a greater number of couples 
in need (e.g., Doss, Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2009).

The Marriage Checkup

A primary goal of the Marriage Checkup (MC) is to engage couples across all levels of 
marital functioning, including those who have not sought psychological services in the past.

Advertising to prospective couples for the MC study involved highlighting four unique 
characteristics of the intervention. First, the MC is designed to be the marital health 
equivalent of annual physical or dental health checkups, providing an opportunity for all 
couples to care for the health of their marriage. Until now, marital interventions have 
consisted primarily of relationship education workshops or tertiary therapy for significantly 
distressed couples. In an attempt to fill the gap, the MC offers all married couples an 
opportunity to receive an individualized check up of their relationship health: satisfied 
couples can seek an MC prophylactically, couples experiencing mild to moderate distress 
can address issues before they become severe and without having to self-evaluate as 
“unhappy,” and highly distressed couples who might not otherwise seek tertiary therapy can 
be further motivated to pursue more extensive services. The second highlighted 
characteristic of the MC is that it is not described as therapy. Participants are informed that 
they will receive assessment and feedback with a trained consultant as an informational 
marital health service. This is intended to attract participants who may be suspicious or 
dismissive of marital therapy. Third, the MC is brief, consisting of a few questionnaires and 
two in-person visits, repeated annually. The brevity of the MC diminishes economic and 
time barriers and requires less confidence in the institution of therapy (i.e. can be tried on a 
short-term basis). This also reassures skeptical couples that the MC requires nothing of them 
beyond the assessment and feedback sessions. Fourth, MC advertising makes clear that the 
couple is responsible for deciding what, if anything, to do with the information provided. 
Active and autonomous participation from the couple is encouraged at all phases of the MC 
to promote couples’ sense of self-efficacy for their own marital health.

Following recruitment, MC couples receive an Assessment session consisting of 
questionnaires and an in-person, conjoint interview. The questionnaires assess for variables 
associated with marital deterioration, including intimacy, communication, finances, sex, 
coparenting, etc. Partners are also asked to identify their most significant strengths and their 
most pressing areas of concern. The in-person Assessment session begins with a short 
interview about how the couple met and decided to marry, and then guides the couple 
through a social support exercise and a problem solving discussion, with the therapist as an 
observer. The session concludes with a therapeutic interview, which prompts the couple to 
discuss their most significant strengths and their primary areas of concern. Reviewing their

strengths reinforces the positive qualities of the couple’s relationship and sets a positive tone 
for the session. The discussion of the couple’s concerns uses techniques from Integrative 
Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT; Jacobson & Christensen, 1996) to reframe issues in 
terms of their “softer” emotional content, to compassionately understand reasons underlying 
the partners’ points of contention, and to recognize how the partners may have come to feel 
stuck in a mutual trap. In the current study, the Assessment session also included a brief 
interview about the couples’ “Reasons for Seeking an MC,” as described below.

The third and final phase of the MC is the motivational Feedback session conducted two 
weeks after the Assessment session. The information gathered during assessment is 
consolidated into a feedback report that serves as the centerpiece of the in-person Feedback 
session. The MC therapist guides the couple through the report which summarizes the 
couple’s history, reviews their strengths, lists their questionnaire scores and interpretations, 
and addresses their areas of concern. During this process, the therapist solicits feedback 
from the couple regarding the accuracy of the general interpretations and presents partners 
with a menu of suggestions based on the current treatment and research literature for how 
they might actively address their specific issues. The clinician and the couple work together 
collaboratively to develop individualized action plans for how to best address the issues at 
hand. At the end of the session, each partner receives a copy of the Feedback report updated 
to reflect the work during the session.

Based on Motivational Interviewing (MI; Miller & Rollnick, 2002), the goal of the feedback 
session is to provide partners with objective information about their strengths and concerns 
in order to motivate them to take deliberate care of their marital health. The MC uses MI to 
facilitate partners’ movement through the successive stages of change toward behavioral 
activation (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983). MC couples’ existing strengths are highlighted 
to reinforce their own ability to take care of their relationship. Areas of concern are 
discussed empathically yet objectively by noting discrepancies between the long-term 
effects of detrimental patterns versus the partners’ relationship goals. The key to a successful 
Marriage Checkup is to activate the couple in the service of their own marital health. MC 
therapists are clear that the only efforts that benefit the relationship are those each partner is 
individually motivated to make. (Further description of the MC can be found in Córdova, 
Scott, Dorian, et al., 2005; Córdova, Warren, & Gee, 2001; Gee, Scott, Castellani, & 
Córdova, 2002; and Morrill & Córdova, 2010).

Current Aims

This first paper from the current study aims to evaluate the ability of a marital health 
checkup model to attract couples across the spectrum of marital functioning, as well as 
couples who may not otherwise seek services. Participant interviews and self-report surveys 
were examined to investigate the following hypotheses: 1) The MC will attract couples who 
do not explicitly perceive their relationship as distressed; 2) The MC will attract couples 
who would not otherwise seek traditional tertiary couple therapy; 3) MC couples will have a 
broader range of relationship functioning than couples seeking traditional therapy; and 4) 
The MC will be perceived as having fewer barriers to participation than traditional therapy.

Participants

Measures

Married couples were recruited from the metropolitan area of a large city in the northeastern 
United States using print and broadcast media, flyers, the Internet, and word of mouth. 
Those who contacted the study (N = 334 couples, 668 individuals) were screened for 
eligibility. The MC study used deliberately broad inclusion criteria to facilitate a naturalistic 
sample of all married couples interested in a marital health checkup. Couples were only 
excluded if they were not currently married (7 couples), married but not living together (1 
couple), currently participating in couple therapy (19 couples), or in individual therapy for 
couple issues (7 couples). Thirteen additional couples did not participate because they were 
not interested, lived too far away, or were lost to contact. The 574 remaining individuals 
(86%) were mailed packets of questionnaires and 443 participants or 77% (214 males and 
229 females) returned the questionnaires to the study. Two hundred and fifteen couples 
(75%) returned both partners’ questionnaires and these couples were randomly assigned to 
either the treatment (113 couples) or control group (102 couples) of the MC study.

The 443 partners who returned the questionnaires ranged from 20 to 78 years old with an 
average age of 45.7 years (SD = 11.2). They had been married on average for 15.1 years (SD 
= 12.0), the longest marriage being 56 years and the shortest being 22 days. Ninety-four 
percent of these MC treatment seekers were White, 2.5% were Black, 2.5% were Asian, 
and .7% were American Indian and Alaska Native. On average, couples had two children, 
and a household income between $75,000–99,000. Eighty-eight percent of participants were 
high school graduates, and 43.9% held a bachelor’s degree or higher. Seventy-nine percent 
of treatment seekers were employed (75.4% full-time, 24.1% part-time).

In addition to the demographic information, the questionnaires that were returned by the 443 
participants collected multiple domains of relationship health data, including marital 
functioning as measured by the Marital Satisfaction Inventory – Revised, Global Distress 
Scale (MSI-R GDS; Snyder, 1997). The MSI-R GDS is a well-validated subscale measuring 
overall relationship distress. In this sample, Cronbach’s alpha for the GDS was .93. 
Standardized mean T-scores are grouped by sex into the following categories: scores 
between 39–49 indicate low distress, 50–59 indicate moderate distress, and 60 and above 
indicate severe distress. MC participants’ MSI-R GDS scores were analyzed and compared 
to the scores of both community and clinical samples used in the original validation study of 
the MSI-R (Snyder, 1997).

The 215 randomized couples were also mailed the Mental Health Utilization questionnaire 
(MHU, developed for this study), which assessed their lifetime utilization of a variety of 
mental health treatment services. The MHU also asked about participants’ decision to 
participate in the MC instead of traditional couples therapy; respondents could endorse any 
of eight listed response options (see Table 4), and/or write-in an open-ended “Other” 
response. Seventy-six percent of participants (325 of 430) completed and returned the MHU 
and “Other” responses were given by 137 participants. All of the “Other” responses were

coded by the first author, and 20% were coded separately by another trained coder, with 98% 
inter-observer agreement.

Interviews

The 113 randomized treatment couples were invited for an in-person MC Assessment 
session which included a “Reasons for Seeking an MC” interview. Participants were asked, 
“Tell me a little bit about why you would like to get a Marriage Checkup at this time;” “Tell 
me a little bit about how, logistically, you decided as a couple to get a marriage checkup,” 
and “How do you hope to benefit from your Marriage Checkup?” Responses to the first and 
third questions were coded by five trained graduate students into categories of responses. 
Twenty percent of the coded interviews were double-checked by another set of blind coders 
and assessed for inter-rater reliability (IRR) with Cohen’s kappa. The 11 categories with fair 
to excellent kappas are listed in Table 1. Rarely endorsed items for which Cohen’s kappas 
could not be calculated were not included, nor were codes with low kappa scores. The mean 
reliability coefficient for the 11 items was .62.

Only Veiled Treatment Seeking was included despite a reliability level below fair (.40). The 
low IRR was likely due to the ambiguous nature of the category itself, however the concept 
of Veiled Treatment Seeking remained particularly relevant to couple help seeking. The 
Veiled category encompasses statements implying relationship concerns that are not being 
openly admitted. Responses coded as Veiled Treatment Seeking included, “to create a forum 
for dialogue,” “to correct anything that needs to be corrected,” and “to understand what’s 
going on inside each other.” Veiled statements often appeared intentionally vague to avoid 
explicitly stating concerns, and thus were inherently difficult to judge as reliably as other 
items by definition.

The “Reasons for seeking an MC” responses were coded into the following categories 
(paraphrased responses from couples in parentheses): 1) “Funtresting” (“Because it sounded 
fun/neat/interesting”); 2) Relationship enhancement (“I don’t think there is anything wrong 
in the marriage, but we can always improve”); 3) Altruism (“Contribute to research”); 4) 
Money (“Get paid”); 5) Learn about relationship (“Gain information”); 6) MC health 
rationale, statements that endorse the marital health model (“A way to keep our relationship 
healthy”); 7) Quality Time (“Productive time together”); 8) Fewer Barriers (“It seemed 
easy”); 9) Don’t know/Not sure (“Nothing specific”); 10) Veiled Treatment Seeking 
(“Opportunity to discuss things”); and 11) Overt Treatment Seeking (“Concerned about 
relationship problems”). Each conceptually unique element of participants’ statements was 
coded separately.

Of the 113 randomized treatment couples invited for an in-person Marriage Checkup, twelve 
elected not to attend, citing reasons such as living too far away, being too busy, or the 
husband deciding not to participate. These 12 couples did not differ significantly from the 
101 couples who completed the face-to-face visit on MSI-R GDS scores (t(221)=1.09, p=.
28), nor length of marriage (t(25.40)=1.10, p=.28). However, they were significantly older 
(t(221)=2.28, p<.05), had fewer years of schooling (t(221)=−2.80, p<.01), and their 
household income trended toward being lower (t(26.52)=−1.97, p=.06). Of the 101 
remaining treatment couples, 99 couples’ (198 participants) assessment sessions were

successfully recorded (two couples’ videotapes were unable to be coded due to recording 
errors).

Given the similarity of the in session Reasons interview responses and the MHU “Other” 
responses, both modalities were coded using the same categories to facilitate direct 
comparison.

RESULTS

Hypothesis 1 – The MC will attract couples who do not explicitly perceive their relationship 
as distressed

As shown in Table 2, the top five reasons given for seeking a MC were 1) Veiled treatment 
seeking (47%), 2) Learn about relationship (41.4%), 3) Overt treatment seeking (38.4%), 4) 
“Funtresting” (36.4%), and 5) MC health rationale (35.4%). The same five (although in 
slightly different order) were given by both men and women.

The most frequent answers on the MHU were similar to those from the interviews, although 
“Funtresting” was the most common response, Overt treatment seeking was 6th, and the MC 
health rationale was 7th. When including control participants’ self-report surveys, four of the 
five top responses remained the same as the Reasons interview responses, however Altruism 
was again reported more frequently and Overt Treatment Seeking fell to 8th. Overall, 69.8% 
of responses given during the Reasons interview were non-distressed (nor Veiled) reasons 
for seeking an MC. Seventy-five percent of the treatment participants written-in Other 
responses fell in non-distressed categories, and 82.6% of reasons were non-distressed when 
combining control and treatment self-reported responses.

Several MC participants’ statements given during the interviews demonstrated that they did 
not self-identify as highly distressed in their marriage.

…Like [husband] said, we both feel that we have a good marriage and we just want 
to keep it that way. (Wife)

It just sounded really interesting. I feel like we’re in a really good place, but we 
could always get to a better place. (Wife)

As noted above, the Veiled treatment seeking findings should be considered cautiously given 
the reliability of the code. However, Veiled was consistently in the top three reasons for all 
methods of report (questionnaire and interview, and for both sexes). Several MC participants 
self-identified as relatively happy in their marriage, but implied veiled concerns, and also 
suggested how the MC provided them a rationale to participate despite their “satisfied” 
status.

I think our marriage is in pretty good shape but it doesn’t hurt to check and see 
where we stand…. And see what we need to work on and improve. (Husband)

It’s not that we don’t communicate, but there are some subjects we’re both careful 
about, and I would like to take that out of our relationship or at least open it up so 
we can look at it a little clearer.... (Wife)

By way of comparison, Doss, Simpson, and Christensen (2004) surveyed the main factors 
that led their 147 distressed couples to seek tertiary therapy. Four of the top five reasons 
given would be categorized in our system as overt treatment seeking (emotional affection, 
communication, divorce/separation concerns, arguments/anger) with one possibly classified 
as veiled treatment seeking (improve relationship). Out of the 18 rank-ordered categories of 
reasons given, only two would be coded by us as non-distressed: positive ideation (love for 
spouse, save good part of marriage; ranked 10th and given by 22% of couples), and social 
activities/time together (ranked 13th and given by 8% of couples). No couples reportedly 
endorsed seeking therapy because it seemed fun or interesting.

In contrast, MC participants talked about viewing the intervention as enjoyable.

I thought it’d be fun. No seriously. I’m serious! (Husband)

She approached me with it and it sounded fun and interesting. (Husband)

Hypothesis 2 – The MC will attract couples who would not otherwise seek traditional 
tertiary couple therapy

As displayed in Table 3, 63.7% (207) of respondents had never sought couple therapy before 
the MC, and 46.8% had never participated in individual therapy. One hundred and six 
participants, or 32.6%, reported they had never sought any kind of mental health treatment 
before the MC.

Many MC participants indicated that part of their decision to seek an MC was their belief 
that it was different from traditional therapy.

Well it said checkup, not necessarily therapy. (Husband)

…The idea of a check up and the way it was presented seemed more relaxed. 
(Husband)

It seemed interesting and non-threatening, less like a counseling kind of 
situation…. (Wife)

Sometimes MC couples said they would not be willing to attend traditional therapy.

We don’t really have problems I would actually consider going to therapy for but I 
was like, that’s kind of a neat idea, and that’s all. (Wife)

I wanted to discuss issues without therapy. (Husband)

Although the number of participants who had previously sought therapy is not usually 
included in published couple therapy studies, Doss et al. (2003) reported that 56% of their 
147 distressed couples had attended couple therapy before with their current partner (more 
could have attended couple therapy with previous partners). Only 36.3% of MC couples 
indicated they had ever participated in couple therapy.

Additionally, as displayed in Table 4, 54.2% of MC participants indicated that they “did not 
feel the need for therapy,” 10.5% reported that one partner was not willing to attend couple 
therapy, and 4.9% were uncomfortable with the idea of seeking therapy. In addition, 9.5%

responded that couple therapy was too expensive, and 8.3% said they did not have time for 
traditional couple therapy.

Although roughly 23% of men initiated contact with the MC, this is not very different from 
men in tertiary treatment samples (e.g. Doss et al., 2003). However, anecdotal evidence 
suggested that some men were particularly drawn to the MC.

I saw the ad in the paper and it sounded along the lines of what I was thinking of 
what makes our relationship tick…without it being a true counseling session. 
Because I never thought we needed counseling anyway…. (Husband)

I think I was pretty agreeable to it, and curious and interested…. So I was pretty 
receptive to it and when she showed me the paper it sounded interesting and 
intriguing. (Husband)

My husband saw the ad, and thought it was a good idea. (Wife)

Hypothesis 3 – MC couples will have a broader range of relationship functioning than 
couples seeking traditional therapy

Of the 443 MC respondents, 162 had MSI-R GDS scores in the low distress (i.e. satisfied) 
range, 197 had moderately distressed scores, and 84 scored in the highly distressed range. 
Replicating findings from a previous study (Córdova et al., 2005), we compared the MSI-R 
GDS means and standard deviations to those reported by Snyder (1997) for 100 therapy 
couples (M= 64.9, SD=6.9) and 154 community couples (M=47.4, SD=7.8), used to develop 
norms for the MSI-R. T-tests revealed that the mean GDS score for the MC sample (M= 
52.59, SD=9.29) was significantly lower than the mean couple GDS score in Snyder’s 
therapy sample, t(657)=−16.77, p<.001) and significantly higher than the mean couple GDS 
score in Snyder’s community sample, t(731)= 8.29, p<.001).

Additionally, MC couples’ GDS scores had broader overall variability than that of 
community or therapy couples. The variance of MC couples (86.30) was significantly larger 
than both the variance of community couples (60.84) and of therapy couples (47.61) at levels 
of p < .001. The GDS scores of MC couples spanned the entire range from 39–79 (most 
satisfied possible score to most distressed possible score). The mean and median GDS of 53 
placed these couples just in the moderately distressed range. However, the mode of 47 
indicated that the most frequent MC couple score was in the satisfied range (the second most 
frequent score was 40). The histogram presented in Figure 1 displays the distribution of the 
GDS scores, which depicts both significant numbers of couples with non-distressed scores, 
as well as equal overall coverage of the distressed range from means of 50 and above.

In addition to the many non-distressed statements made by MC couples, other participants 
did express significant strain on their relationship, and stated why they believed the MC 
would be useful for them.

Because there has been a lot of BS the past year. I think we could actually use it. 
(Wife)

We were going through a hard time. I looked at counseling and this seemed like a 
good first step. (Wife)

We’ve been in this relationship a long time and I don’t think we’ve progressed in 
certain areas and to me it’s a little frustrating….We’ve tried to work it out amongst 
ourselves the best we can…. So we’d welcome any feedback. (Husband)

Hypothesis 4 – The MC will be perceived as having fewer barriers to participation than 
traditional therapy

As shown in Table 2, “Fewer Barriers” reasons for seeking an MC were offered by 14.1% of 
participants during the assessment interviews. These included statements that suggested the 
MC was perceived as being convenient, or did not seem as threatening or intimidating as 
traditional therapy.

Furthermore, when responding to the self-report survey about why they chose to participate 
in the MC rather than in traditional couple therapy (as shown in Table 4), 17.8% of the 
responses addressed fewer logistical barriers including expense and time. Additionally, 
fewer barriers was written-in as “Other” by 6.8% of treatment couples and 8.8% of the 
treatment and control couples combined.

Some couples explicitly noted fewer barriers as a reason for seeking an MC.

The main thing was it wasn’t a major time commitment…. I work nights, he works 
days, so scheduling things is kind of tricky. But this wasn’t too bad and it was 
spread over a good amount of time, and the questionnaires we could do from home, 
so that was a main factor. (Wife)

DISCUSSION

The need to develop interventions that can overcome existing barriers to couple treatment-
seeking is an ongoing challenge to the newest generation of researchers. Data from the 
current study indicate that the MC can attract couples with mild to moderate relationship 
distress as well as those naïve to mental health treatment. In order for interventions to reach 
couples who may not know they are at risk, the service must appeal to those who perceive 
themselves as healthy. Because the MC attracted couples who self-identified as satisfied but 
typically had distressed GDS scores, as well as couples who often gave Veiled reasons for 
seeking treatment (although preliminary), it appears possible that the MC does cast this kind 
of broad net.

Additionally, the mismatch between high rates of marital distress and low rates of couple 
therapy utilization has left an urgent, unmet need. Although engaging the first-time mental 
health client is particularly difficult, over 63% of MC participants had never sought a 
couple-level intervention previously, and for over 32% the MC was their first foray into 
mental health services. Furthermore, although it was more often the female partners who 
initiated contact with the MC study, 47.8% of the participants were male. Given that 
research suggests that clients are more likely to re-use mental health services after the first 
time (Bringle & Byers, 1997), participating in the MC could increase future mental health 
utilization by men.

Fifty-three percent of MC participants had previously participated in individual therapy, the 
most common type of mental health treatment in our society today. However, while it has 
been shown that individual treatment can improve marital satisfaction as a result of 
improvements in personal levels of distress, research does not support individual therapy as 
the most effective way to address relationship issues (Atkins, Dimidjian, Bedics, & 
Christensen, 2009). Couples treatment has been shown to be more effective than individual 
treatment for many domains that can influence the relationship (Browne, 1995). 
Unfortunately, 49.7% of MC participants who had previously engaged in individual therapy 
had never participated in couple therapy, again highlighting the need for more attractive and 
accessible couple level interventions.

What mechanisms might enable the MC to attract couples who would not normally seek 
mental health services? Although further research is needed to examine the active 
mechanisms, an important component appears to be the marital health model. Emphasizing 
health and a checkup resonated with many couples, and this trend will perhaps continue to 
rise due to recent mental health parity legislation.

It looked like you were trying to establish a checkup yearly almost like going for a 
physical. I thought it was a good idea. (Wife)

But out of honesty, everyone’s relationship, especially one that’s lasted 22 years…
there’s no harm that can come from a 22,000 mile check up. (Husband)

I’m a physician and I thought it was a neat concept similar to a physical or dental 
example…a psychological exam for couples. (Wife)

The marital health language of the MC also supports the idea of actively taking care of one’s 
marriage like other valued areas in life.

We’re both very proactive; we’re just good about our physical and mental health 
and I was like ‘this makes sense!’ (Wife)

I think it’s healthy that everybody gets a checkup…. Whether you want to call it 
preventative maintenance, it’s good to have a checkup to find out what’s going on if 
there are things going on. (Husband)

There are several potentially useful clinical implications of these findings. Couple therapists 
could utilize a brief checkup model to attract unreached couple populations in various 
communities. Efforts to facilitate dissemination of the checkup are currently underway. The 
checkup model could also be generalizable to other groups. For example, many parents 
could benefit from parenting services but do not seek them because they are not 
experiencing a severe problem (e.g. court mandate, conduct disordered child, etc.). We are 
currently exploring a potential “parenting checkup” which could provide a health frame to 
attract at-risk parents who would not ordinarily seek services.

Additionally, many areas within the mental health field are increasingly emphasizing the 
importance of motivation to successful treatment (e.g. Goldfried, 2011). Behavioral Couples 
Therapy researchers have found a lack of motivation to be the largest single barrier to 
treatment engagement for couples where one partner has a substance abuse disorder 
(O’Farrell & Fals-Stewart, 2006). Adding a couple-level motivational component to a variety

of interventions could increase treatment compliance by engaging and strengthening the 
marital system as support and encouragement.

Although these results are promising, several limitations should be noted. A primary concern 
regarding generalizability is that the current findings occurred in the context of a paid 
research study. A small percentage of participants (8–16%, depending on data collection 
method) indicated that one of their reasons for participation was the research payment. 
About 9% of the sample suggested that they chose the MC because of cost considerations. A 
similar proportion of the population might resist an MC in the community due to cost, but it 
should be noted that the MC would require considerably less time and money than would a 
full course of traditional therapy.

It is encouraging that the MC appears to attract a diverse group of couples in terms of 
marital functioning and previous treatment utilization. Mildly and moderately distressed 
couples have historically been overlooked and underserved by couple interventions, leaving 
many couples vulnerable to accumulating marital deterioration. However, the MC does 
unfortunately appear vulnerable to several familiar barriers to mental health services such as 
attracting a predominantly White, middle-class, educated population, and women initiating 
contact more often than men. Most health services, including medical and dental clinics, 
suffer similar imbalances in terms of participation, a significant problem that remains to be 
addressed. This reminds us again that simply opening the doors to mental health services is 
not enough to attract traditionally underserved populations, but rather that mental health 
providers must actively reach out to diverse communities. Relatedly, although the group of 
12 randomized treatment couples who did not follow through with the in-person MC is too 
small to formulate more than tentative interpretations, indications that these couples were 
significantly older, less educated, and trending toward less household income could imply 
that couples who are more stressed may experience additional barriers to participation in the 
MC. One explanation may be that couples with lower socioeconomic status face greater 
logistical barriers to participating in even a short-term intervention.

Overall, these data suggest that the MC is a promising approach for encouraging a broad 
range of couples who might not otherwise seek services to actively attend to their marital 
health. Previous research indicated that participation in the MC also improves relationship 
outcomes across a range of marital health domains. If the ongoing study replicates previous 
results, the MC model may have the potential to significantly diminish the occurrence of 
marital ill-health for a larger number of couples.
