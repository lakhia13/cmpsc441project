Abstract

Objective—We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and
tolerability trial of Matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract therapy in patients with mild to
moderate Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). We hypothesized that chamomile would be
superior to placebo in reducing GAD symptoms with a comparable tolerability profile.

Materials & Methods—61 outpatients with mild to moderate GAD were enrolled and 57 were
randomized to either double blind chamomile extract (n=28) or placebo (n=29) therapy for 8
weeks. The study was powered to detect a statistically significant and clinically meaningful group
difference in change over time in total Hamilton Anxiety Rating (HAM-A) scores. Secondary
outcomes included change in the Beck Anxiety Inventory score, Psychological Well Being score,
Clinical Global Impression Severity score, and the proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in
baseline HAM-A score.

Results—We observed a significantly greater reduction in mean total HAM-A score during
chamomile versus placebo therapy (p=0.047). Although the study was not powered to identify
small to moderate differences in secondary outcomes, we observed a positive change in all
secondary outcomes in the same direction as the primary outcome measure. One patient in each
treatment group discontinued therapy for adverse events. The proportion of patients experiencing
0, 1, 2, or ≥3 adverse events was not significantly different between groups (p=0.417).

Conclusion—This is the first, controlled clinical trial of chamomile extract for GAD. The results
suggest that chamomile may have modest anxiolytic activity in patients with mild to moderate
GAD. Future studies are needed to replicate these observations.

INTRODUCTION

Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric conditions. (1,2) In particular,
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by a wide array of psychological and
physical symptoms, and usually manifests as a chronic disorder with only 30% of patients
experiencing spontaneous remission. (1) While benzodiazepine (BZ) anxiolytics have been
the mainstay therapy of GAD, these agents are often associated with unwanted side effects
and dependence. (3) More recently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (and other)
antidepressants have been used to treat GAD. (4) However, these agents can produce
unwanted sexual and other side effects that can result in patient dissatisfaction and treatment
discontinuation. (5,6)

Many individuals with mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety do not seek medical attention
because they do not view their symptoms as the result of a medical condition. Rather, many
individuals with self-diagnosed anxiety symptoms will seek non-conventional anti-anxiety
treatment with a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). (7) These remedies have
now become widely available, and have increased in use in recent decades. (8) Common
reasons for individuals choosing CAM therapy may include lack of health insurance,
cultural proscriptions, concern over the stigma of having an anxiety disorder, or the
association of mental illness with mental weakness. Moreover, individuals seeking CAM
remedies often come from vulnerable populations such as the uninsured, or racial and ethnic
minorities. Rigorous testing of candidate CAM therapies of mild to moderate anxiety is
needed to expand available therapeutic options for this disorder (9,10,11).

Matricaria recutita or Chamomilla recutita (chamomile) has been used as a traditional herbal
remedy for its relaxation and calming effect. It is well tolerated and demonstrates
pharmacological activity in animal models of anxiety. (12,13–15) However, despite its
widespread use as a calming agent, there have been no controlled clinical trials of
chamomile’s anxiolytic efficacy or tolerability in individuals with GAD. We present
preliminary results from the first 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel group trial of oral chamomile extract therapy of mild to moderate GAD. We
hypothesized that chamomile would have a superior anxiolytic efficacy versus placebo, and
that chamomile would have a comparable tolerability profile relative to placebo.

MATERIALS & METHODS

Patient Selection

Patients were referred from the Department of Family Medicine & Community Health
outpatient clinic. All were ≥ 18 years old and had a DSM IV Axis I diagnosis of GAD that
was ascertained using the Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM IV (SCID) (16)
interview format. Patients had a minimum baseline total Hamilton Anxiety Rating (HAM-A)
(17) score ≥ 9. Patients with other co-morbid DSM IV Axis I disorders (e.g., minor
depression) were not excluded from the trial if the co-morbid condition did not constitute the

primary disorder. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had a current diagnosis of
major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, phobic disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, substance-induced
anxiety disorder, psychosis, dementia, or substance abuse or dependence within the
preceding 3 months. Other exclusion criteria were an unstable medical condition, hepatic or
renal insufficiency, malignancy, abnormal serum thyrotropin level≥ 5 μIU/ml, or known
sensitivity to chamomile, plants of the asteraceae family, mugwort, or birch pollen.
Concurrent use of anxiolytics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, sedatives, or CAM
remedies (e.g., St. John’s Wort), or other chamomile preparations were not permitted.
Women of child-bearing potential employed a medically proven form of contraception and
had a negative pregnancy test before starting therapy.

Evaluation Procedures

Patients provided informed consent in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Institutional Review Board. The study was conducted using the Principles of Good Clinical
Practice Guidelines, with oversight by the local Office of Human Research and by an
independent Data & Safety Monitoring Board. A psychiatric history was obtained using the
SCID interview format. (16) A medical history, physical examination, and laboratory
evaluation was performed that included complete blood count, electrolytes, hepatic, renal
and thyroid panel, pregnancy test (in women of child-bearing potential), urinalysis, and
urine drug screen. Structured symptom ratings were obtained at each study visit using the
HAM-A rating (17), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (18), the Psychological General Well
Being (PGWB) index (19), Clinical Global Impressions Severity (CGI/S) rating (20), and a
standardized treatment emergent side effects profile. (21) Sitting and standing blood
pressure, pulse, and weight were obtained at each study visit. All evaluations took place at
the Depression Research Unit at the University of Pennsylvania.

Identically appearing capsules containing either pharmaceutical grade German chamomile
extract standardized to a content of 1.2% apigenin (Spectrum Pharmacy Products, New
Brunswick, NJ) or placebo (i.e., lactose monohydrate NF) were prepared. Chamomile was
prepared as 220 mg capsules. Blinding of the characteristic chamomile aroma was achieved
by inserting a disk impregnated with 1 drop of chamomile oil (for placebo) or 1 drop of
neutral oil (for chamomile) into the lid of each air-tight medication container.

Randomization & Blinding Procedures

Randomization was performed using blocked randomization with varying block sizes. First,
we randomly selected a block size from among a small set of block sizes. Then we randomly
permuted the group numbers within that block. We continued this procedure until all
subjects were randomized into each of the treatment conditions. Random numbers were
permuted within each block using the random number generator and user code in Stata
software. All study results were analyzed under blinded conditions.

Chamomile or placebo therapy was initiated at one capsule daily for the first week and
increased to 2 capsules daily during the second week of therapy. Patients with a ≤ 50%
reduction in total HAM-A score (versus baseline) were increased to 3 capsules daily during
week 3, and then to 4 capsules daily during week 4 of therapy. Patients who continued to
have a ≤ 50% reduction in baseline HAM-A score were increased to 5 capsules daily during
study weeks 5 through 8 of therapy. Dose reductions could occur at any time based upon

drug tolerability. Outcome measurements were obtained at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, and 8
weeks of treatment.

Sample Size Justification

The study was powered to detect relatively large statistically significant differences between
treatment conditions in the primary outcome measure of change over time in total HAM-A
score. Using an estimate of power based upon a longitudinal comparison model, the study
had sufficient power to detect an effect size of 0.57 based on a sample size of 30 patients per
group with 5 measurements per patient and an intra-subject correlation of 0.50. The
detectable effect sizes with 80% (90% power) were 0.57 (0.68), 0.51 (0.60), 0.44 (0.52),
0.36, (0.43), and 0.26 (0.30), for correlations of 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, respectively.

Statistical Procedures

All primary and secondary outcome measures were analyzed under blinded conditions.
Primary comparisons implemented quasi-least squares (QLS) with 2-sided tests of
hypotheses and a p-value < 0.05 as the criterion for statistical significance using the xtqls
procedure for Stata 10.0 (22). QLS was chosen to allow for use of the Markov correlation
structure that models the correlation between repeated measures and is appropriate for
unequal measurement times.

Regression models including intercept (β0), chamomile group indicator (β1), time (β2) and
their interaction (β3) were used to test the primary hypothesis that change in HAM-A scores
differed significantly between treatment conditions (H0:β3 = 0). Regression analysis was
also used to examine change in the secondary BAI and PGWB measures. In order to assess
for sensitivity of the results in relation to the choice of correlation structure, we also used the
AR(1) correlation structure and both the model based and robust sandwich estimates of the
covariance matrix were applied. The results did not differ between structures. Results
presented here were based on application of the model based covariance matrix, because this
approach yielded slightly larger p-values and was therefore viewed as more conservative for
this analysis.

A last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis was also conducted to examine change
in total HAM-A scores between treatment conditions.

The Pearson chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of responders (with a ≥ 50%
reduction in baseline HAM-A score) between treatment conditions. We used the intent-to-
treat approach that assumed that patients who withdrew from treatment before the end of the
trial were non-responders.

Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to identify differences in continuous clinical and
demographic values between treatment groups. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare
frequencies of adverse events between treatment conditions. A t-test was used to examine
whether the mean incidence rate of adverse events (i.e., the number of events per individual
in days) was greater at higher chamomile doses (during weeks 5 to 8) versus lower
chamomile doses (during weeks 1 to 4). We also compared the proportion of patients
reporting 0, 1, 2, or ≥ 3 adverse events between treatment conditions using the χ2 test.

61 patients were enrolled in the trial and 57 patients had a baseline visit and at least one
post-baseline measurement: chamomile (n=28) and placebo (n=29). Four patients (6.6%)

were screen failures: 1 for noncompliance, and 3 for withdrawn consent. Eight patients
(14.03%) discontinued treatment before completing the trial: 2 for adverse events, 3 for
withdrawn consent, 2 lost to follow up, and 1 for noncompliance. [Note - One patient with a
baseline measurement withdrew consent to participate in the trial after taking one dose of
study drug. This patient was, nevertheless, retained in all efficacy and safety outcome
analyses]. There were no significant group differences in any of the demographic or clinical
variables (Table 2).

The study was not powered to detect small to moderate group differences in the secondary
outcome measures, but rather to identify non-significant trends in these measures (if
present). There were no statistically significant differences observed between treatment
groups in any secondary outcome measure. However, clinically meaningful change in
secondary outcome measures did occur in the same direction as the change seen in the
primary outcome measure. We observed a somewhat greater reduction in mean total BAI
score for chamomile versus placebo (60β̂3 = −2.09, 95% CI = −6.14 - 1.96) (p=0.411), a
somewhat greater increase in mean PGWB score with chamomile versus placebo (60β̂3 =
6.33, 95% CI = −2.71 – 15.37) (p=0.170), and a somewhat greater reduction in the CGI/S
score for chamomile versus placebo (60β̂3 = −0.43, 95% CI = −1.06 - 0.21 (p=0.187). There
was a somewhat greater proportion HAM-A responders to chamomile (57.13%) versus
placebo (37.93%) (p=0.146). Finally, the overall percentage change was numerically greater
for chamomile (−52.97%) versus placebo (−34.92%) on the HAM-A (p=0.085), for
chamomile (−42.48%) versus placebo (−20.79%) on the BAI (p=0.142), and for chamomile
(27.58%) versus placebo (17.64%) on the PGWB (p=0.344). We again note that although
the change over time for all secondary outcomes occurred in a direction favorable to
chamomile, we also observed statistically significant results for the primary outcome
measure for which the study was originally powered.

Two patients discontinued treatment for adverse events: 1 for allergic reaction (placebo) and
1 for abdominal discomfort (chamomile). There were a total of 33 adverse events rated as
possible, probable, or definite: 11 on chamomile and 22 on placebo (p=ns). The proportion
of patients with 0, 1, 2, or ≥ 3 adverse events was 35.7, 35.7, 10.7 and 17.9 for chamomile
versus 24.1, 31.0, 27.6 and 17.3 for placebo, respectively (p=0.417).

We observed a somewhat greater reduction over time in resting pulse rate during chamomile
versus placebo therapy (60β̂3 = −5.22, 95% CI = −13.64 - 3.20 (p=0.225), but no difference
in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, or weight.

There were no significant differences in mean daily capsule number taken between
treatment groups during any treatment period. There was also no significant difference in the
mean number of capsules taken at each treatment period for chamomile or placebo
responders versus non-responders (with a ≥ 50% reduction in baseline total HAM-A score).

Finally, we examined whether the incidence rate of adverse events (i.e., the number of
events per individual in days) was greater at higher chamomile doses (during weeks 5 to 8)
versus lower chamomile doses (during weeks 1 to 4). This procedure adjusted for the
influence of variable measurement times between treatment periods. We found a lower
incidence rate of adverse events at higher chamomile doses (0.003; 2/717) versus lower
chamomile doses (0.015; 11/734) (p=0.015), -suggesting that there is no increase in adverse
events at higher chamomile doses.

DISCUSSION

This study represents the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
trial of oral chamomile extract therapy of mild to moderate GAD. We observed a
statistically significant superiority of chamomile over placebo in reducing total HAM-A
scores (p=0.047). While the study was not specifically powered to detect statistically
significant differences between treatment groups for the secondary outcome measures, we
nonetheless found clinically meaningful (albeit non-significant) changes over time in the
secondary outcome measures that occurred in a direction favorable to chamomile.
Chamomile also appeared it be exceedingly well tolerated relative to placebo.

Chamomile, in the form of teas and oils, is often used for its relaxation and calming effect.
Its exact mode of action is unknown. However, several lines of evidence suggest that one or
more of its flavonoid constituents may produce anxiolytic activity by affecting γ-amino
butyric acid (GABA), noradrenalin (NA), dopamine (DA), and serotonin neurotransmission
(23,24), or by modulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis function (12,15).
Apigenin, and other constituents of chamomile, have also been shown to bind to BZ
receptors and reduce GABA-activated activity. (13,25,26,27).

Several caveats should be considered in the interpretation of the present findings. For
example, the small sample size may have limited our ability to equally distribute covariates
between treatment conditions during the randomization process. This factor could have
contributed to the favorable outcome of chamomile in the present study. In addition, there
was a slightly higher mean baseline HAM-A score for the chamomile group, which could
suggest the possibility that chamomile’s superiority over placebo was the result of a
regression toward the mean. Similarly, other unrecognized differences between treatment
groups may have contributed to the present findings.

It is possible that chamomile could have resulted in a more robust anxiolytic activity if we
had employed a larger dose of the extract. The selection of the chamomile dose was based
upon authoritative reviews (28) with no published dose range or tolerability studies to guide
our selection of a optimal chamomile dose. Thus, the maximum chamomile dose of 1,100
mg daily may not have been the optimal anxiolytic dose of oral this chamomile extract.
Moreover, the time of chamomile dosing was not standardized. Patients were instructed to
take their study medication once daily or in divided doses, depending upon the time of their
greatest anxiety symptoms. For example, patients may have taken their study medication in
divided doses throughout the day to reduce anxiety symptoms, or may have taken the
majority of their daily dosage at bedtime to reduce insomnia. This non-standardized dosing
regimen may have introduced response variability and may have altered the true efficacy of
the chamomile therapy. However, differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
profiles of the ‘active’ constituents of chamomile extract, together with a paucity of
controlled data on these constituents in humans, made it difficult to determine the optimal
dosing strategy. Furthermore, because we used a dose escalation design, we were unable to
determine whether or not there might be a dose-response relationship for chamomile extract
in reducing anxiety.

It is possible that another chamomile preparation standardized to constituents other than
apigenin may have produced different results. In addition, the use of non-pharmaceutical
grade chamomile or chamomile from a species other than Chamomilla recutita may have
produced different results. It is also possible that other chamomile formulations (e.g., oil,
vapor, tea) may have produced different results with a different tolerability profile.

We did not employ a specific patient or clinician-rated measure to verify the adequacy of the
blinded conditions. Thus, it is possible that unrecognized rater or patient or clinician bias
may have contributed to the superiority of chamomile over placebo.

It is possible that the modest benefit of chamomile was an artifact of limited sample size.
Nevertheless, despite this limitation, we observed a statistically significant, and clinically
meaningful, group difference in the primary outcome measure, and fairly large effect sizes
for change in the secondary outcome measures that occurred in the same direction as that of
the primary measure.

We note that the patients enrolled in the study had more mild GAD symptoms and may have
qualitatively differed from populations of more severely ill GAD patients included in GAD
trials of conventional anxiolytic agents. It is possible that the beneficial effect of chamomile
seen in this study is limited to individuals with mild to moderate GAD, and patients with
more severe GAD would not benefit from chamomile therapy. We would note, however,
that the change in GAD symptoms in the present study was not limited to patients with
milder GAD symptoms.

Finally, the treatment duration of the current study was limited to 8 weeks, and future
studies of longer duration will be needed to more fully assess the durability of chamomile’s
anxiolytic effect.

CONCLUSION

The identification of a safe and effective alternative therapy for GAD would be of relevance
for many individuals unable, or unwilling, to use conventional anxiolytic therapy. The
current double-blind, placebo-controlled trial represents the first controlled clinical trial of
the efficacy and tolerability of oral chamomile extract for mild to moderate GAD. The
demonstration of chamomile’s efficacy and tolerability in patients with milder GAD may
provide a wider acceptability of anxiolytic treatment in the general medical community.
Despite the limitations of this initial study, the present findings suggest that chamomile may
possess modest anxiolytic effect in some patients with mild GAD.
