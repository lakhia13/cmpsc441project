Abstract

Chronic pain in childhood and adolescence has been shown to heighten risk for depressive and 
anxiety disorders in specific samples in adulthood; however, less is known about the association 
between a wider variety of chronic pains and internalizing mental health disorders. Using 
nationally representative data, the objectives of this study were to establish prevalence rates of 
internalizing mental health disorders (anxiety and depressive disorders) among cohorts with or 
without adolescent chronic pain, and to examine whether chronic pain in adolescence is associated 
with lifetime history of internalizing mental health disorders reported in adulthood. Data from the 
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) was used (N = 14,790). 
Individuals who had chronic pain in adolescence subsequently reported higher rates of lifetime 
anxiety disorders (21.1% vs. 12.4%) and depressive disorders (24.5% vs. 14.1%) in adulthood as 
compared to individuals without a history of adolescent chronic pain. Multivariate logistic 
regression confirmed that chronic pain in adolescence was associated with an increased likelihood 
of lifetime history of anxiety (odds ratio (OR): 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09-1.63, 
p=0.005) and depressive disorders (OR: 1.38; CI: 1.16-1.64, p<0.001) reported in adulthood. 
Future research is needed to examine neurobiological and psychological mechanisms underlying 
these co-morbidities.

Pediatric chronic pain is prevalent [18], disabling [14], costly [12], and can carry 
considerable emotional burden for youth and their families [21]. Despite advances in our 
understanding of the lasting impact of pain in childhood on development across 
neurobiological [4; 33], psychological [34], and social [32] domains, epidemiological 
studies spanning adolescence to adulthood are rare. This dearth of research limits 
understanding of the mental health comorbidities associated with pediatric chronic pain, 
which has impeded efforts to effectively prevent and treat pain in these vulnerable youth.

Prior research has documented the negative impact that pediatric chronic pain has on the 
mental health of youth and their families. Indeed, there is a clear link between anxiety, 
depressive, and disruptive behavior symptoms and disorders and pediatric chronic pain [7; 
17; 29; 30]. However, less is known about the relationship of chronic pain in adolescence 
and lifetime internalizing mental health disorders reported in adulthood. Early research 
using birth cohorts (i.e., from 1946 and 1958) from the United Kingdom demonstrated that 
children with abdominal pain and frequent headaches had greater rates of psychiatric 
disorders and symptoms in adulthood [9; 13], but did not find consistent patterns of adult 
chronic pain. However, assessment of childhood chronic and recurrent pain in these cohort 
studies was limited by failure to assess pain frequency.

In arguably the most well designed study on this topic, Shelby and colleagues [27] 
prospectively followed a cohort of pediatric patients with functional abdominal pain (FAP) 
and a control group without FAP into young adulthood. Findings showed that the current 
and lifetime risk of developing anxiety disorders (including PTSD) was significantly higher 
in individuals with a childhood history of FAP as compared to controls. Lifetime, but not 
current, risk of having depressive disorders was also significantly higher among individuals 
with childhood FAP. Risk of current anxiety disorders was higher than controls regardless of 
whether or not chronic pain persisted into adulthood, suggesting that chronic pain in 
adolescence heightens risk for psychopathology, even when pain resolves.

Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, this is the first 
nationally representative study to examine whether a variety of chronic pains in adolescence 
is associated with greater risk of lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders reported in 
adulthood. Our aims were to: 1) establish prevalence lifetime rates of these internalizing 
mental health disorders in individuals with or without chronic pain in adolescence, and 2) 
examine the relationship between adolescent chronic pain status and internalizing mental 
health diagnoses, controlling for sociodemographic factors and clinical covariates. We 
hypothesized that youth with chronic pain would subsequently report higher lifetime rates of 
internalizing mental health disorders as compared to youth without chronic pain. Because 
sleep, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and general health status are related to chronic pain 
and mental health diagnoses [3; 10; 16; 17; 24], we sought to control for the variance 
accounted for by these factors. We hypothesized that beyond these factors, adolescent 
chronic pain status would be linked to increased occurrence of lifetime anxiety and 
depressive disorders.

Page 3

This is a secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to 
Adult Health (Add Health). Add Health is a nationally representative longitudinal study 
conducted in the United States beginning in 1994-95 with adolescents in grades 7-12. 
Participants were selected by first randomly selecting 80 high schools from a frame (26,666 
schools) sorted into 80 clusters based on region, urbanicity, school size, school type, percent 
white, percent black, grade span, and curriculum type (i.e., general, vocational, alternative). 
Students at each of the 80 schools (>90,000 students total) were first administered an in-
school questionnaire. Students were then stratified based on grade and sex and 
approximately 17 students were selected from each stratum, leading to a core sample of 
approximately 200 students from each school (12,105 students total, not including 
oversamples) that subsequently proceeded with the Wave I in-home interview. In addition to 
the core sample, the cohort included oversamples of particular race/ethnic and ability groups 
(Black, Chinese, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and students with disabilities) along with two entire 
schools to ensure representativeness of the sample to the general population. This resulted in 
20,745 adolescents being included in the initial cohort sample. The cohort was followed 
with 4 subsequent in-home interviews, the most recent of which was in 2008 when 
participants were between the ages of 24 and 32 years. The sample size used in this study 
was 14,790 (7866 females, Mage at Wave I = 16.0 years, SE = 0.12), which only includes 
individuals who completed all of the relevant waves and items. The data included in the 
present study were collected during Wave I (conducted in 1994-95, participants in grades 
7-12), Wave II (1996, grades 8-12), and Wave IV (2008, ages 24-32) interviews. Information 
on the sociodemographic background of the cohorts is included in Table 1.

  Classification of Pain Status—Pain variables were extracted from Wave I and II data 
from a self-report survey about adolescent general health. In these interviews, participants 
were asked to rate the frequency of each of the following types of pain occurring over the 
past 12 months: headache, stomachache, and aches, pain, or soreness in muscles or joints. 
These are the most common types of chronic pain in children and adolescents [11; 14; 18; 
22]. The response options included: “never,” “just a few times,” “about once a week,” 
“almost every day,” “every day,” and “refused.” We dichotomized pain as “chronic” or “not 
chronic.” Adolescent chronic pain status was thus computed from pain presence at either 
Wave I and/or Wave II. To avoid overinflating rates and keeping consistent with definitions 
of “high frequency pain” used in previous literature [35], we used a conservative 
classification of chronic pain to include pain occurring “almost every day” or “every day.” 
This is a more conservative definition of chronic pain than definitions used by other 
researchers examining chronic pain in the Add Health cohort [31]. Moreover, prevalence 
rates of chronic pain within this dataset (21.9%) were similar to or even lower than those 
cited in previous epidemiological research [18], providing additional assurance that our 
categorization of chronic pain was conservative.

Internalizing Mental Health Diagnoses—Data on diagnosis of anxiety disorders 
reported in adulthood was extracted from a self-report survey of illness, medications, and 
physical disabilities administered at Wave IV. For comparability to previous research on this 
topic[27] as well as the version of the DSM that was most current at the time of data 
collection, anxiety disorders included diagnoses of PTSD. Participants were asked: “Has a 
doctor, nurse or other health care provider ever told you that you have or had post-traumatic 
stress disorder or PTSD?” They were also asked: “Has a doctor, nurse or other health care 
provider ever told you that you have or had anxiety or panic disorder?” A “yes” response to 
either of these items was required to endorse presence of an anxiety disorder.

Depressive disorders were similarly measured at Wave IV and classified. Participants were 
asked “Has a doctor, nurse or other health care provider ever told you that you have or had 
depression?” Previous research has also used this method in large-scale population health 
surveys to establish mental health diagnostic history. For example, self-report of past 
depression diagnosis from a provider has been found to have adequate concordance with 
later clinician-administered diagnostic interview [26].

  Covariates: Adolescent-Reported Anxiety Symptoms, Depressive 
Symptoms, Insufficient Sleep, and General Health—Anxiety symptoms in 
adolescence were measured at Wave I using 5 items that constituted a physiological 
symptom-based measure of anxiety. This approach has been used in previous Add-health 
studies[15]. Specifically, participants were asked how often they experienced each of the 
following over the past 12 months: 1) felt hot all over suddenly, for no reason, 2) cold 
sweats, 3) chest pains, 4) fearfulness, and 5) trouble relaxing. Responses to each item were 
measured using a 5-point Likert scale (anchors: “never” and “every day”). Similar to 
previous published research using this variable in the Add Health database[15], total anxiety 
symptom scores were calculated as a sum of the 5 items, with a possible range from 0 (no 
anxiety symptoms) to 20 (most frequent/severe anxiety symptoms).

Depressive symptoms were measured using items based on the 20-item Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) that adolescents completed at Wave I. 
Items were scored on the basis of the frequency with which depressive symptoms were 
experienced in the past week using a 4-point Likert scale (anchors: “never/rarely” and 
“most/all of the time”). Similar to previous published research using this variable in the Add 
Health database [25], total scores were calculated as a sum of the 20 items and could range 
from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 60 (most frequent/severe depressive symptoms).

Insufficient sleep was assessed during Wave I using the following question: “Do you usually 
get enough sleep?” with response options including “yes” (coded as sufficient sleep) or “no” 
(coded as insufficient sleep).

General health was measured by the question: “In general, how is your health?” with 5 
response options ranging from “excellent” to “poor.” The general health variable was 
dichotomized as either “good” (responses included “excellent,” “very good,” or “good”) or 
“poor” (responses included “fair” or “poor”).

  Sociodemographic Variables—We included four sociodemographic covariates: 
income (in $1000 increments); age (years); race/ethnicity (1 = white, non-Hispanic, 2 = 
Black, non-Hispanic, 3 = Hispanic, 4 = Other); gender. Data on age, race/ethnicity, and 
gender was collected during the Wave I in-home interviews. Data on household/family 
income was collected from the parent questionnaires that were administered to parents at 
Wave I.

  Data analysis—We analyzed data with Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp College Station, 
TX). Two-tailed P-values of less than .05 were considered statistically significant. According 
to published recommendations [5], we adjusted for the complex sample design of Add 
Health by using sampling weights, regional stratification, and primary sampling unit 
information. Descriptive statistics are presented as means and standard errors or frequency 
and percentages, respectively. We first conducted bivariate analyses to compare 
characteristics between adolescents with and without chronic pain at Wave 1. Continuous 
variables were compared using adjusted Wald testing after the survey estimation. Categorical 
variables were compared using Pearson χ2 analysis.

Our primary outcomes were self-reported lifetime history of internalizing mental health 
conditions (anxiety and depressive disorders) that were diagnosed by a healthcare provider, 
as reported in adulthood (Wave IV). Our primary approaches to the analysis were 
multivariate logistic regression modeling. Our models examined the association between 
chronic pain in adolescence and mental health reported in adulthood, while controlling for 
sociodemographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income) and clinical (anxiety symptoms, 
depressive symptoms, insufficient sleep, and general health in adolescence) covariates. 
Overall, models were judged to be statistically significant based on Likelihood ratio χ2 tests 
of p <.0001. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals.

  Results

  Description of the Sample

The sample included 14,790 participants, who after survey weighting represented 21.95 
million individuals. Of the participants, 3,174 (21.9% of sample) endorsed having chronic 
pain in adolescence at Wave I and/or Wave II, whereas 11,610 (78.1% of sample) did not 
endorse having chronic pain. Sample characteristics are presented in Table 1. Females were 
more likely to report chronic pain than males (25.5% vs. 18.4%; χ2 (128, N = 14,784) = 
108.7, p < .0001). As expected, adolescents with chronic pain reported significantly higher 
concurrent anxiety symptoms (Mpain = 3.5; Mno pain = 2.0; F(1, 128) = 528.9, p < .0001), 
depressive symptoms (Mpain = 14.9 on CES-D; Mno pain = 10.4 on CES-D; F(1, 128) = 
336.8, p < .0001), insufficient sleep (37.6% of chronic pain group reported insufficient sleep 
vs. 23.3% of no chronic pain group; F(1, 128) = 157.2, p<0.001), and poorer general health 
(chronic pain group = 12.1% rated general health as “fair to poor”; no chronic pain group = 
5.6% rated general health as “fair to poor”; χ2 (128, N = 14,781) = 167.5, p < .0001).

  Prevalence of Lifetime History of Internalizing Mental Health Disorders Reported in 
Adulthood and their Association with Pain

Overall, across groups with and without chronic pain, 14.3% of participants at Wave IV 
reported that a health care provider had ever diagnosed them with an anxiety disorder. With 
respect to depressive disorders, across groups with and without chronic pain, 16.4% of 
participants reported being diagnosed with depression by a health care provider. As 
hypothesized, individuals with a history of chronic pain during adolescence reported higher 
lifetime rates of anxiety disorders (21.1%) in adulthood as compared to those without 
adolescent chronic pain (12.4%), χ2 (128, N = 14,781) = 154.5, p < .0001 (See Table 1). 
Lifetime rates of depressive disorders were also significantly higher in individuals with 
chronic pain in adolescence (24.5%) as compared to individuals without chronic pain in 
adolescence (14.1%), χ2 (128, N = 14,781) = 198.7, p < .0001.

  Predictors of Lifetime History of Internalizing Mental Health Disorders Reported in 
Adulthood

Multivariate logistic regressions incorporating probability weights were used to examine the 
relationship between adolescent chronic pain status, covariates at Wave I (sociodemographic 
factors, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, insufficient sleep, general health) and 
adult-reported lifetime diagnoses of internalizing mental health conditions. Two separate 
models were conducted with anxiety and depressive disorder diagnoses as outcomes. In each 
model, the dependent variable was the dichotomous coding for the presence or absence of 
the mental health diagnosis (0 = no anxiety or depressive disorders, respectively for each 
model, 1 = presence of diagnosis). As shown in Table 2, adolescent chronic pain status, 
female sex, white race/ethnic identity, and adolescent anxiety and depressive symptoms were 
significantly associated with increased likelihood of lifetime history of anxiety disorders 
reported in adulthood.

Chronic pain in adolescence was also associated with lifetime history of depressive disorders 
reported in adulthood (Table 3). In addition to chronic pain, several covariates were 
associated with increased likelihood of lifetime history of depressive disorders (female sex, 
white race/ethnic identity, adolescent anxiety and depressive symptoms, and general health).

  Discussion

This is the first prospective study to establish nationally representative prevalence rates of 
internalizing mental health diagnoses (anxiety and depressive disorders) among individuals 
with a history of chronic pain in adolescence, and to examine the association between 
adolescent chronic pain and lifetime history of mental health disorders reported in 
adulthood. Findings revealed that adolescents with, versus without, chronic pain 
subsequently reported higher lifetime rates of anxiety disorders (21.1% vs. 12.4%) as well as 
depressive disorders (24.5% vs. 14.1%) in adulthood. Over and above important 
demographic and clinical covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, depressive and anxiety 
symptoms, insufficient sleep, general health), chronic pain status in adolescence was 
associated with an increase in risk for lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders.

Findings contribute to the limited evidence base on the association between pediatric chronic 
pain and psychopathology. It is the first nationally representative study spanning the 
pediatric and adult periods to examine prevalence rates of internalizing mental health 
disorders among individuals with a wide variety of adolescent chronic pains. These 
prevalence rates reflect those individuals who were reportedly willing and able to access a 
healthcare provider and receive a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, it is possible that elevated 
symptomatology, versus formal mental health diagnoses, may be higher among individuals 
with a history of adolescent chronic pain. Moreover, it is possible that individuals were not 
aware of diagnoses of mental health disorders that were made earlier in childhood and 
adolescence when youth do not access healthcare independently from their parents. 
Therefore, based on the self-reported assessment of mental health disorders conducted in the 
Add Health study, these prevalence rates are likely to be conservative estimates. Findings are 
consistent with those of Shelby and colleagues [27] in individuals with FAP. In both studies, 
chronic pain in adolescence was related to greater lifetime history of anxiety and depressive 
disorders reported in adulthood. However, this research extends the work of Shelby and 
colleagues by demonstrating the link between lifetime internalizing mental health disorders 
and a wider variety of chronic pain types including headache and muscle or joint pain, in 
addition to stomachaches. Moreover, the present sample was not a treatment-seeking group 
of youth with chronic pain who had all been evaluated and diagnosed by a physician, but 
rather represents a larger, national, community sample. Hence, our findings may be more 
generalizable to youth with chronic pain living in the United States.

Having established that adolescent chronic pain is indeed linked to heightened risk of 
lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders reported in adulthood, research is needed to 
examine shared vulnerability and mutually maintaining factors that underlie these 
comorbidities. The high co-occurrence between anxiety disorders and chronic pain in 
adulthood has been explained by the presence of shared vulnerability or mutually 
maintaining psychological factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, attentional biases, lower 
threshold for alarm) that lead to the development and/or maintenance of both conditions[1]. 
Beyond psychological factors, neurobiological correlates and mechanisms also warrant 
future investigation. On an anatomical level, the amygdala is of particular interest, as 
activation in this structure is associated with both chronic pain and fear in pediatric 
patients[28]. Beyond the amygdala, neuroactive steroids acting agnostically with GABA, the 
opioid and endocannabinoid systems, immune factors, and second messenger systems have 
been tied to chronic pain, anxiety and depressive disorders [19]. While there are many 
possible neurobiological linkages between chronic pain and psychopathology, further 
research is needed to characterize these linkages and identify further commonalities.

Findings should be interpreted in light of study limitations. First, chronic pain in adulthood 
was not assessed in the Add Health study; therefore, we were unable to determine whether 
childhood chronic pain remitted or persisted over time. The research of Shelby and 
colleagues [27] suggests that lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders is highest in 
individuals whose functional abdominal pain persists into adulthood; however risk for these 
mental health disorders is still higher among individuals whose abdominal pain remits in 
adulthood as compared to controls. Longitudinal research on the link between specific 
chronic pains in childhood and adulthood has yielded mixed results concerning the

persistence of pain into adulthood[9; 13; 34], which could be the result of methodological 
differences in pain assessment across studies. Future longitudinal research is needed to 
understand the connection between childhood and adult chronic pains and co-occurring 
psychopathology. Second, the Add Health measurement plan did not include a validated 
assessment of chronic pain. Although pain frequency was assessed, which enabled us to 
apply a conservative approach to the categorization of chronic pain (i.e., daily or almost 
daily pain), optimal assessment of chronic pain should incorporate self-report measures of 
frequency, duration, and impairment and physician report of specific pain diagnoses. Third, 
it is unknown whether adolescents received treatment for their chronic pain and if so, what 
this treatment entailed. Existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that 
psychological interventions for pediatric chronic pain [6] do not lead to lasting reductions in 
anxiety and depressive symptoms; thus, childhood treatment of pain may not be effective in 
preventing future psychopathology. Future research is needed to determine what type of 
psychological treatment(s) (e.g., targeted towards anxiety and/or depressive symptoms in 
addition to chronic pain) can reduce pain and internalizing mental health symptoms/
diagnoses.

Another limitation of our study is that internalizing mental health diagnoses were assessed 
using self-report of having ever received a diagnosis of anxiety or depressive disorders by a 
healthcare professional. Self-reported assessment of mental health diagnoses is not as 
reliable or valid as assessment using standardized semi-structured questionnaires and clinical 
interviews, as has previously been used in studies of FAP [27; 34]. Although such an 
approach is not considered feasible in large-scale epidemiological research such as the Add 
Health study, we encourage researchers to conduct formal assessment of mental health 
disorders in future studies in order to provide more accurate prevalence rates and to direct 
services toward identified needs in this population. Diagnostic status of lifetime anxiety and 
depressive disorders was based on retrospective report in adulthood; however, age of onset 
for chronic pain and mental health symptoms/disorders was either not formally or validly 
assessed. Therefore, we could not determine the directionality of the chronic pain-
psychopathology relationship in this study. Recent epidemiological research has shown that 
onset of mental health disorders most often preceded onset of chronic pain in adolescence 
[30]; however, additional prospective research is needed to establish the temporal 
relationship between chronic pain and psychopathology.

In addition, youth with chronic pain are not a homogenous group as they were classified in 
this study. Rather, chronic pain in childhood and adolescence must be understood within the 
context of a multitude of biological, social, and psychological factors interacting to influence 
trajectories of functioning [20]. Walker and colleagues [34] demonstrated that youth with 
abdominal pain could be classified based on pain characteristics (pain severity), activity 
limitations, and psychological factors (pain threat appraisal, pain coping efficacy, 
catastrophizing, negative affect) and these classifications predicted different trajectories of 
pain and psychopathology into young adulthood. These constructs and variables were not 
assessed in the present study. Use of similar classifications to develop clinical phenotypes of 
children with chronic pain may provide valuable information about long-term risk into 
adulthood.

The current study examined specific internalizing mental health disorders known to co-occur 
with chronic pain in child and adult samples (i.e., anxiety and depressive disorders); 
however, there are other mental health disorders that warrant investigation. Recent research 
with adolescents found associations between chronic pain and affective as well as disruptive 
behavior disorders [30]. Additionally, in an epidemiological study spanning part of the 
childhood and adolescent period, Egger and colleagues [8] found gender differences in the 
relationships between pain and psychopathology. In particular, pain was associated with 
emotional disorders in girls whereas it was related to disruptive behavior disorders in boys. 
Future research should examine sex as a moderator of the relationship between chronic pain 
and a wider variety of mental health disorders. Finally, although these data are more recent 
than those used in previous nationally representative studies on pediatric chronic pain and 
psychopathology (initial data collection began in 1994/1995 versus 1946[13] and 1958[9]), 
more contemporary data may yield differing findings.

In conclusion, this is the first nationally representative study to examine whether a variety of 
chronic pains in adolescence are associated with greater risk of lifetime internalizing mental 
health disorders reported in adulthood. Our findings provide compelling evidence that 
indeed, pediatric chronic pain is associated with heightened risk for psychopathology. In 
particular, risk associated with lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders was significantly 
higher in individuals with, versus without, a history of adolescent chronic pain. Future 
research is needed to determine the temporal relationships between chronic pain and 
internalizing mental health disorders, to identify psychological and neurobiological 
mechanisms that may explain this co-occurrence, and to inform how interventions can 
optimally target these symptoms to alter pain and mental health trajectories.
