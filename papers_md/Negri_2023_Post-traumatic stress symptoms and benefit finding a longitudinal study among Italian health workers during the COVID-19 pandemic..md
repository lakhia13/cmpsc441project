Abstract
Purpose  Research has highlighted that the exposure of healthcare professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic for over two 
years can lead to the development and persistence of symptoms characteristic of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), 
with serious consequences on both the individual well-being and the quality of care provided. The present study was aimed 
at investigating the role of benefit finding in moderating post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) over time.
Methods  The longitudinal study, conducted between April and October 2020, involved 226 Italian health workers (44.7% 
nurses and midwives, 35% doctors, 20.3% technical and rehabilitation professionals), who filled out an online survey at the 
beginning of the study  (T1), after three months  (T2), and after six months  (T3).
Participants (77.4% women; mean age = 41.93, SD = 12.06) completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Benefit 
Finding, a 17-item questionnaire measuring the perceived level of positive consequences derived from stressful experiences. 
A hierarchical regression analysis highlighted the moderating effect of benefit finding  (T2) on the association between PTSS 
values at  T1 and  T3.
Results  A buffering effect was observed, with higher benefit finding levels reducing the magnitude of the bivariate associa-
tion between PTSS assessed at the beginning and at the end of the study.
Conclusion  Findings suggest the potential mental health related benefits of interventions allowing health professionals to 
identify positive aspects in the experience of working under prolonged emergency circumstances, such as the pandemic ones.

Introduction

Italy was the first European country to be strongly hit by 
the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The first national lockdown was 
declared on March 8 and lasted until May 3, 2020; a gradual 
decrease in COVID-19 cases was observed between May 
and mid-August, followed by a growing incidence trend and 
a renewed outbreak in October and November 2020 [1].

Worldwide, several studies explored mental health disor-
ders during the pandemic in the general population; results 
showed a high prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Symp-
toms (PTSS), and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), 
together with anxiety and depression [2–8]. Similar results 
were found among healthcare workers (HWs) in different 
countries [9–13]. Especially during the first and sudden out-
break of the pandemic, HWs experienced remarkable strain 
in their frontline role, due to dearth of protective equip-
ment, exposure to high infection risk, and lack of available 
treatment protocols for assisting patients infected by Sars-
Cov-2, especially when the disease progression led to criti-
cal conditions. Not surprisingly, several studies conducted 
across countries identified high levels of PTSS among HWs 
[14–16]. As concerns Italian HWs, in a survey conducted 
during the first pandemic outbreak almost half of the par-
ticipants reported presence of PTSS [17]; in another work, 
26.2% of the sample met the criteria for a provisional PTSD 
diagnosis [18].

According to the International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD-11) [19], PTSD development is strongly associated 
with exposure to a trauma, defined as an extremely threat-
ening or horrific event or series of events. Similarly, the 
current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 
(DSM-5) defines PTSD as a psychological condition that can 
occur after exposure to a potentially traumatic event [20]. As 
highlighted in recent works, the COVID-19 pandemic and 
associated consequences could be considered as a poten-
tially traumatic event in both classification systems [21, 22]. 
According to the DSM-5, a PTSD diagnosis requires the 
presence of PTSS including re-experiencing the traumatic 
event, avoidance of related stimuli, intrusive behaviors, and 
worsening cognition and mood after the traumatic event. 
A large body of research showed that PTSS and PTSD are 
associated with general distress and a higher risk of develop-
ing both physical and mental co-morbidities [23–25].

From a complementary perspective, an increasing number 
of studies have been focused on the individual and environ-
mental resources that can be mobilized or developed to cope 
with or adapt to stressful events and potentially life-threating 
conditions [26–31]. Among these resources, benefit finding 
(BF) is defined as the identification of benefits from adver-
sities. Benefits can be detected at the individual, relational 
and transcendent levels; they include, for example, increased 
appreciation for life, awareness of deepened interpersonal 
relationships, enhanced sense of spirituality, and life pur-
pose [32–36]. Benefit finding has been associated with opti-
mal adaptation to stressful situations, including pandemics 
[37, 38]. Both perception of and active search for benefits 
deriving from stressful events have been accounted for as 
cognitive meaning-making reappraisal strategies promoting 
individual well-being [39–41].

The  identification  and  acknowledgement  of  positive 
contributions from traumatic experiences are an important 
resource in coping with life-threating situations [42, 43]. It 
is also a core component of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) 
[44, 45], defined as the process allowing individuals who 
are coping with trauma or life crises to strengthen their per-
ceptions of self, others, and the meaning attributed to the 
traumatic experience itself [45]. Although similar, PTG and 
benefit finding differ in terms of both predictors and devel-
opment patterns [46, 47]. Concerning predictors, Sears and 
colleagues [47] found a significant longitudinal association 
between BF and the personal characteristics of optimism and 
hope; this relationship was not confirmed for PTG. Research 
works also suggested different timing in the emergence and 
development of these two processes, with BF potentially 
starting immediately after the traumatic experience, and 
PTG requiring more time (i.e. weeks/months/years), due to 
the associated in-depth restructuring process [43, 47]. Over-
all, most studies addressing positive contributions following 
adversities or trauma were focused on PTG and associated 

dimensions, while only limited attention was devoted to ben-
efit finding; efforts within this research area were mainly 
aimed at investigating the relationship between BF and adap-
tation to stress/life-threating events. Results were however 
controversial: While a significant association was identified 
in some studies between BF and lower or decreased levels of 
distress [32], other works did not confirm this relationship 
[47, 48]. The even fewer studies devoted to the investigation 
of the moderating role of BF on psychological distress also 
provided inconsistent results. In some of them, a significant 
interaction emerged between BF and severity of stressors 
in predicting improved psychological adjustment among 
disaster survivors [49] and women living with HIV/AIDS 
[50]; BF was also found to buffer the relationship between 
combat stress and PTSD symptoms among active soldiers 
following a 15-month deployment, but only under conditions 
of supportive officer leadership [51]. Opposite patterns were 
instead detected in other studies, in which the interaction 
between high levels of BF and breast cancer severity pre-
dicted worse mental health outcomes over time [36].

Within the international literature exploring the psycho-
logical correlates of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a lim-
ited amount of studies was aimed at investigating PTG and 
BF, both in the general population and among HWs. Results 
from a large-scale Chinese survey involving nurses showed 
that 39% of participants experienced PTG; further, nurses 
working at COVID-19 hospitals and caring for patients in 
critical care units reported higher PTG scores than nurses 
not engaged in these services [52].

As for BF, results from the general population showed 
that mortality concerns related to COVID-19 were cross-
sectionally associated with higher BF values; BF was, in 
turn, positively correlated with life satisfaction, meaning in 
life, self-esteem, and resilience, while negatively correlated 
with levels of depression and stress [53].

BF was also found to longitudinally mediate the relation-
ship between support seeking and well-being among Chi-
nese participants from the general population during the 
COVID-19 pandemic [37].

To the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal studies 
were yet conducted to jointly monitor PTSS and BF dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic in a population specifically 
exposed to the related strain and traumatic experiences, such 
as health professionals. In particular, no longitudinal studies 
were conducted to investigate the moderating role of benefit 
finding on PTSS development among these workers.

Study aims

The current study was aimed at investigating: (a) PTSS and 
BF development among Italian HWs actively working dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) to test the moderating 
role of BF on PTSS development across time. Due to the 

1 3

1551

unpredictable development of the COVID-19 pandemic, no 
a priori hypotheses were formulated for the first aim (a); 
concerning the second aim (b), the identification of ben-
efits from adversities related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
was hypothesized to buffer the magnitude of the association 
between participants’ PTSS measured at the beginning and 
at the end of the longitudinal study.

Method

Procedures and participants

The present study was conducted between April and Octo-
ber 2020, and consisted in three consecutive waves of data 
collection: April 15 to May 15  (T1), July 6 to August 6 
 (T2), and October 14 to October 30  (T3). Data on levels of 
PTSS were collected at  T1,  T2, and  T3, while perceived BF 
was assessed at  T2 and  T3. Participants were HWs actively 
working in Lombardy, the Italian region in which the high-
est rates of contagion and deaths were recorded during the 
first pandemic outbreak [54, 55]. Potential participants were 
contacted through an e-mail message containing detailed 
information on the study features and the link to the online 
questionnaires, which was sent to HW associations in Lom-
bardy with the invitation to forward it to their members. 
Both acknowledgment and signature of the informed con-
sent form were mandatory to access the questionnaires. 
Anonymity was granted by inviting participants to create an 
individual alphanumeric code, to be used across the three 
assessment waves.

Measures

All participants completed two self-reported measures:

The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 
(PCL-5) [56, 57], a 20-item measure assessing PTSS sever-
ity experienced over the previous month on scales ranging 
from 0 ‘not at all’ to 4 ‘extremely’. A provisional diagno-
sis of PTSD can also be formulated when the PCL-5 score 
is ≥ 33 [57]. The PCL-5 was completed at  T1,  T2 and  T3.

Benefit Finding (BF) [32, 36], a 17-item measure assess-
ing the perception of positive contributions to one’s life 
deriving from stressful and life-threatening experiences. 
Answers are provided through a 1 ‘I disagree a lot’ to 5 
‘I agree a lot’ scale; higher scores reflect higher perceived 
benefit; BF was assessed at  T2 and  T3.

Socio-demographic and work-related data included age, 
gender, profession and job seniority; in addition, at  T2 and 
 T3 participants were also asked to report if they had been 
assigned to a COVID-19 department since  T1.

Data analysis

As a first step, descriptive statistics of the study meas-
ures were calculated. Cochran’ Q was employed to lon-
gitudinally assess changes, across time, in the frequency 
of participants meeting criteria for a provisional PTSD 
diagnosis; differences in PTSS scores at  T1,  T2, and  T3 
were tested using a repeated measures ANOVA followed 
by post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction; BF 
levels  (T2,  T3) were also compared using a Student t-test 
for paired samples. Data were checked for repeated meas-
ures ANOVA and Student t-test assumption violations; 
namely, presence of extreme outliers together with nor-
mality assumption were inspected for both analyses; the 
ANOVA assumption of sphericity was also tested through 
Mauchly’s test.

Subsequently, Pearson correlations were calculated to 
assess the magnitude of associations between PTSS and 
BF  both  cross-sectionally  and  at  different  time  points. 
Regardless of statistical significance, only values ≥|0.30| 
were considered as meaningful. Values between |0.30| and 
|0.49| were interpreted as indices of low correlation, values 
between |0.50| and |0.69| as indices of moderate correlation, 
and values ≥|0.70| as indices of high correlation between 
variables [58].

A hierarchical linear regression analysis using Ordinary 
Least Square (OLS) estimation technique was performed to 
test for the direct effects of PTSS  (T1) and BF  (T2) on PTSS 
 (T3), as well as the moderating effect of BF  (T2) on the rela-
tionship between PTSS at  T1 and  T3. Demographic and job-
specific dimensions were entered in the regression model as 
control variables. Data were checked for violations of regres-
sion assumptions. In particular, linearity and normality of 
residuals were investigated through comparison of residual 
vs fitted values and Q-Q plots visual inspection, respectively; 
the absence of autocorrelation in residuals was assessed 
using the Durbin-Watson test while the Breusch-Pagan test 
investigated heteroscedasticity; as final steps, variance infla-
tion factor (VIF) and leverages inspection were employed 
to detect multicollinearity issues and influential data points, 
respectively. Categorical variables with three or more levels 
were dummy coded; a reference category was selected and 
employed. Significance of regression coefficients was esti-
mated through 95% confidence intervals (CI) from 2,000 
bootstrapped samples. Simple slopes were calculated for the 
16th, 50th, and 84th percentile of the distribution, as sug-
gested by Hayes [59]. All slopes were then plotted and tested 
for significance through Student t-test.

In order to assess the reliability of statistically significant 
results, observed effect sizes were compared with thresh-
old reliability values calculated through sensitivity analysis 
[60]; f and  f2 indices were employed to evaluate reliability of 
ANOVA and regression analyses, respectively [61].

Results

Attrition rate and data handling

A total of 721 HWs completed the longitudinal study at  T1, 
357 (49.5%) at  T2 and 232 at  T3 (32.2%). Demographic fea-
tures and distress levels were compared between participants 
who completed all three data waves and those who dropped 
out after  T1 or  T2. Attrition analysis results indicated that 
there were no significant differences in age, [t(719) = 1.911; 
p = 0.056], gender [χ 2(1) = 2.36;  pFisher = 0.148], job sen-
iority [t(719) = 1.40;  p = 0.162], profession [χ 2(2) = 0.23; 
p = 0.890],  PTSS(T 1)  score  [t(719) = -0.58;  p = 0.562], 
or  percentage  of  provisional  PTSD  diagnosis  at   T1 
[χ2(1) = 0.07; pFisher = 0.807].

Out of the 232 participants completing the three waves, 
four (1.7%) were excluded from the final sample due to miss-
ing answers. Moreover, data from two participants (0.86%) 
were excluded from analyses because they retired from work 
between  T2 and  T3.

Descriptive statistics

The  sample’s  demographic  and  job  characteristics  are 
reported in Table 1. Most participants were women, in their 
forties and working as nurses or midwives; during the over-
all study period, over 60% of the HWs worked in a COVID-
19 department.

Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 2, together 
with Cronbach α reliability indices and percentage of par-
ticipants meeting criteria for a provisional PTSD diagnosis. 
All α coefficients were ≥ 0.90, indicating excellent internal 
consistency. As for PTSD, almost 40% of HWs received a 
provisional diagnosis at  T1.

Cochran’ Q was employed to assess differences in the 
frequency of PTSD diagnosis across time; a significant dif-
ference  was  detected  (Q(2) = 39.22;  p < 0.001).  Post-hoc 
Dunn’s tests with Bonferroni correction showed a higher 
percentage of PTSD diagnoses at  T1 than  T2 (p < 0.001), 
and  T3 (p < 0.001); no differences were found between  T2 
and  T3 (p = 0.82).

Since a violation of sphericity assumption was observed 
for repeated one-way ANOVA testing differences in PTSS 
scores at  T1,  T2, and  T3 (W = 0.953; p = 0.004), robust esti-
mation techniques based on trimmed mean (20%) and boot-
strap sampling (N = 2000) were employed to corroborate 
results of parametric tests. Welch-James (WJ) statistic [62] 
was calculated and used for robust hypothesis testing.

Parametric repeated one-way ANOVA resulted in a sig-
nificant omnibus test  (F(2, 450) = 62.36; p < 0.001), with an 
effect size (f = 0.52) higher than the sensitivity threshold 
(f = 0.21; N = 226; 1-β = 0.80; α = 0.05). Pairwise post-hoc 
comparisons (Bonferroni adjustments) highlighted differ-
ences between  T1 and  T2 (p < 0.001), and between  T1 and 
 T3  (p < 0.001).  No  differences  between  T2  and  T3  were 
observed for PTSS (p = 0.05). The robust alternative con-
firmed parametric results: The omnibus test was significant 
 (WJ(2, 269.9) = 20.47, p < 0.001) with pairwise comparisons 
resulting in both a significant  T1 vs  T2  (WJ(2, 269.3) = 37.49; 
95%CI:  [0.41;  0.82])  and  T1  vs   T3   (WJ(2,  269.3) = 23.22;

95%CI: [0.28; 0.69]) difference; no difference was instead 
observed  between   T2  and   T3   (WJ(2,  270) = 1.83;  95%CI: 
[− 0.34; 0.07]).

All  assumptions  were  met  for  the  paired  Student 
t-test  comparing  BF  at   T2  and   T3;  no  difference  was 
observed between HWs’ means at these two time points 
(t(225) =  − 0.56; p = 0.58).

Table 3 shows correlations among study measures; PTSS 
at  T1,  T2, and  T3 were all positively correlated, with val-
ues > 0.60; a high positive correlation was also observed 
between BF at  T2 and  T3. All remaining correlations did not 
reach meaningfulness threshold.

To test the moderating effect of BF on PTSS develop-
ment,  a  hierarchical  regression  analysis  was  employed. 
PTSS at  T3 was considered as the criterion variable; PTSS 
at  T1 and BF at  T2 were treated as predictor and modera-
tor, respectively, and they were inserted at step 1 together 
with the following control variables: participants’ gender, 
profession (technical and rehabilitation professionals were 
considered as reference category), job seniority, and being 
assigned to a COVID-19 department before or at  T2. The 
cross product between PTSS at  T1, and BF at  T2 followed 
in step 2.

Plot  inspection  excluded  violations  of  assumptions 
related to linearity and normality of residuals; Durbin-Wat-
son (D-W = 1.89; p = 0.36) and Breusch-Pagan (BP = 9.31; 
p = 0.31) tests further excluded any autocorrelation or het-
eroscedasticity issue, respectively. While no influential data 
points were detected through leverages inspection, a high 

level of correlation (VIF values ≥ 10) was observed among 
variables. To reduce multicollinearity, PTSS at  T1 and BF 
at  T2 were centered at their mean values prior to creating 
their product term [63]. No multicollinearity issues were 
detected for the model with centered variables (observed 
VIF values < 2.5).

Results from hierarchical regression analysis are reported 

in Table 4.

The  overall  model  was  significant   (F(8,217) = 21.37; 
p < 0.001) and explained 44% of the variance of PTSS at  T3 
with an effect size  f2 = 0.78 higher than sensitivity threshold 
 (f2 = 0.068; N = 226; 1-β = 0.80; α = 0.05). A significant posi-
tive effect was observed for PTSS at  T1 (p < 0.001), while 
no linear association was found between BF at  T2 and PTSS 
at  T3; a significant negative effect was instead identified for 
the product between PTSS at  T1 and BF at  T2 (p = 0.004). 
The  interaction  term  accounted  for  an  additional  2%  of 
model variance, supporting the moderation hypothesis; the 
associated effect size to  R2 increase was  f2 = 0.044, higher 
than sensitivity threshold  (f2 = 0.035; N = 226; 1-β = 0.80; 
α = 0.05). The interaction was probed by testing the con-
ditional effects of PTSS(T1) at three levels of BF(T2): 16th 
(BF = 2.88), 50th (BF = 3.47), and 84th (BF = 4.04) per -
centile of the distribution [59]. A positive and significant 
association was detected between PTSS(T1) and PTSS(T3) 
for BF(T2) at 16th (t(217) = 11.22, p < 0.001; 95%CI: [0.58; 
0.82]), 50th (t(217) = 11.30, p < 0.001; 95%CI: [0.47; 0.67]), 
and  84th  (t(217) = 6.43,  p < 0.001;  95%CI:  [0.30;  0.58]) 
percentile. The moderation of BF(T2) on the relationship

between PTSS at  T1 and at  T3 is plotted in Fig. 1; a buffering 
effect of BF at  T2 was observed, with higher BF(T2) levels 
reducing the magnitude of the bivariate association between 
PTSS(T1) and PTSS(T3).

Discussion

The present study was aimed at investigating post-traumatic 
stress symptoms (PTSS) and benefit finding (BF) among 
health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic; the mod-
erating role of BF on PTSS development was also inspected 
and longitudinally tested.

The first wave  (T1) took place during the final period of 
the first national lockdown; not surprisingly, and in line with 
other studies [17, 64, 65], almost 40% of the participants 
reported PTSS levels meeting criteria for a provisional PTSD 
diagnosis. This result attests to the strain and difficulties 
HWs were exposed to during the pandemic outbreak. Com-
pared to  T1, a significantly lower percentage of participants 
met a PTSD provisional diagnosis at  T2 (July–August 2020); 
this difference is consistent with the steadily decreasing trend 
of the infection rate during Summer 2020, corresponding to 

the  T2 data collection. Subsequently, however, despite the 
stable rise in COVID-19 cases observed between August and 
October 2020 (when the third data collection took place) no 
significant difference emerged in PTSS values, compared 
to  T2. Individual resources such as benefit finding, effort-
fully mobilized and/or built by health workers during the 
previous months, in order to fulfill their demanding role in 
the community, could have played a significant role in buff-
ering the impact of the pandemic on HWs’ mental health. 
As results show, participants’ benefit finding scores did not 
differ between  T2 and  T3, similarly to what was observed for 
PTSS values. Considering that no clinical threshold score is 
available for BF, it is worth noting that HWs’ mean values at 
both times fell near the central point of the scale with limited 
standard deviation; this result suggests that most participants 
were able to derive positive contributions from coping with 
COVID-19 related difficulties, at least to some extent. The 
absence of a significant difference between BF values at  T2 
and  T3 suggests that the “positive teachings” acquired from 
the pandemic experience had become part of the stable set 
of HWs’ personal resources, and thus they were not nega-
tively impacted by the increase of contagion rates observed 
on October 2020.

As for the relationship between PTSS and BF, no mean-
ingful correlations were found within and across time points. 
The literature addressing this topic is scarce and related find-
ings are controversial; therefore, comparisons can be hardly 
made. In line with our results, the absence of a significant 
relationship with stress or life-threating events was observed 
when BF was longitudinally assessed in patients with early-
stage breast cancer [47] and colorectal cancer [48]. On the 
contrary, a significant negative association emerged in a 
cross-sectional study involving two groups of patients: par-
ticipants with cancer, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
[66]. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a nega-
tive association was detected between BF and stress among 
undergraduate students and adults, but the magnitude level 
was low (r =  − 0.33) and the study design was cross-sec-
tional [53]. Consistent with our findings, instead, in a longi-
tudinal study conducted among Chinese university students 
from February to May 2020 [67] no meaningful associations 
of BF with stress and anxiety were detected.

To get a more detailed understanding of the data col-
lected in the present study, a hierarchical regression analysis 
was performed to investigate the moderating effect of BF 
on PTSS development; results were controlled for partici-
pants’ gender, profession, job seniority, and involvement in 
a COVID-19 department before or at  T2 (July–August 2020). 
BF at  T2 was found to exert a significant moderating effect 
on the relationship between levels of PTSS experienced by 
HWs at  T1 (coinciding with the first national lockdown) 

and at  T3 (October 2020, characterized by a steady increase 
of contagion rates). More precisely, a buffering effect was 
observed, with higher BF levels reducing the magnitude 
of the bivariate association between PTSS assessed at the 
beginning and at the end of the study. As results showed, 
HWs’ PTSS measured at  T3 increased with PTSS measured 
at  T1 for low, medium and high values of BF at  T2. Although 
significant, the strength of this relationship was reduced for 
HWs reporting higher scores of BF at  T2 as a consequence 
of the significant interaction.

Overall, evidence from the present study provides sup-
port to the role of benefit finding in counterbalancing the 
post-traumatic stress symptoms experienced by healthcare 
workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding bears 
promising implications for interventions aimed at promot-
ing mental health among health professionals facing the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and other future emergency events 
[68, 69]. Programs aimed at reducing PTSS through cogni-
tive behavioral therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitiza-
tion and reprocessing (EMDR), and well-being therapy [70, 
71] could be integrated with strategies aimed at actively 
fostering benefit finding through the support of the related 
meaning-making process. As suggested by Lechner [72], 
however, acknowledgment of benefit finding should never 
be “prescribed” by clinicians or therapists, but instead facili-
tated through deep examination and mutual sharing. Spon-
taneous reports of benefits, when recognized and cultivated, 
can be the starting point of the meaning-making process, 

1 31556

potentially promoting greater awareness and, ultimately, 
higher levels of well-being.

Considering both the high levels of PTSS, and the prev-
alence of provisional PTSD diagnoses observed among 
HWs  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  support  of 
benefit finding could be particularly useful for both the 
professionals who did not find any benefit in working dur-
ing the pandemic, and the workers whose self-generated 
perception of benefits could be acknowledged and further 
fostered.

Limitations, strengths and future directions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal 
study jointly monitoring PTSS and BF among HWs fac-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim of testing the 
effect of benefit finding on post-traumatic stress symptoms 
development. Taken together, findings underscored the use-
ful role of perceiving positive contributions to one’s life 
in counterbalancing the negative symptoms derived from 
prolonged exposure to stressful experiences. Besides these 
novel contributions, limitations have to be acknowledged as 
well. First, a high attrition rate was observed along the three 
study waves, with the majority of participants dropping out 
between  T1 and  T2. Caution must therefore be exerted in 
generalizing the implications of the findings, even though 
it is worth noting that participants completing all waves did 
not differ significantly from dropped out ones for any demo-
graphic or psychological variables, and comparable dropout 
rates were observed in other longitudinal studies conducted 
during the pandemic [37]. A second limitation concerns 
the self-report measure employed to formulate provisional 
PTSD diagnoses; in future studies it should be integrated 
with DSM-5 based diagnosis issued by clinicians. Finally, 
cross-cultural differences may exist in perceived benefit 
while facing difficulties of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite limitations, results from this study can offer some 
hints concerning strategies that could be fruitfully imple-
mented to foster the well-being of health workers exposed 
to the COVID-19 pandemic related challenges [73]. While 
results from the present research focused on the first months 
following the pandemic outbreak, future research should 
explore the role of benefit finding in adjusting to conse-
quences of the pandemic evolution.

Overall,  these  findings  could  also  provide  some  sug-
gestions  to  clinicians  and  psychotherapists  supporting 
helping professionals engaged in emergency or rescuing 
interventions.
