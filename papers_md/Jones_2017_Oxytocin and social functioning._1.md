Introduction

  Over the past decade, research has investigated 

impairments  in  processing  of  social  information  in  a 
broad  range  of  illnesses,  including  autism,  schizophre-
nia, anorexia, and social anxiety disorder.1-3 Difficulty in 
social stimuli processing is often evaluated over multi-
ple dimensions and is disease-specific, for instance eval-
uation of social communication in autism or social fear 
in social anxiety disorder.3,4 This review specifically dis-
cusses the role of oxytocin in social anxiety. Although 
disorders that contain an aspect of social anxiety differ 
greatly in symptomatology and etiology, it is important 
to recognize where similarities exist in the development 
and functioning of brain regions specific to processing 
of  social  stimuli.  Thus,  treatment  beneficial  to  social 
anxiety disorder could also be useful for other disorders 
with social processing dysfunction. 
  The  fifth  edition  of  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines social anx-
iety disorder as a “persistent fear of one or more social or 
performance situations in which the person is exposed to 
unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others.”5 So-
cial anxiety occurs on a wide spectrum ranging from mild

Social  anxiety  is  a  form  of  anxiety  characterized  by 
continuous fear of one or more social or performance 
situations.  Although  multiple  treatment  modalities 
(cognitive  behavioral  therapy,  selective  serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors/selective norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors,  benzodiazepines)  exist  for  social  anxiety, 
they  are  effective  for  only  60%  to  70%  of  patients. 
Thus, researchers have looked for other candidates for 
social  anxiety  treatment.  Our  review  focuses  on  the 
peptide oxytocin as a potential therapeutic option for 
individuals  with  social  anxiety.  Animal  research  both 
in  nonprimates  and  primates  supports  oxytocin’s  role 
in facilitation of prosocial behaviors and its anxiolytic 
effects. Human studies indicate significant associations 
between  social  anxiety  and  oxytocin  receptor  gene 
alleles,  as  well  as  social  anxiety  and  oxytocin  plasma 
levels.  In  addition,  intranasal  administration  of  oxy-
tocin  in  humans  has  favorable  effects  on  social  anxi-
ety symptomology. Other disorders, including autism, 
schizophrenia, and anorexia, have components of so-
cial anxiety in their pathophysiology. The therapeutic 
role  of  oxytocin  for  social  dysfunction  in  these  disor-
ders is discussed.

adaptive fear to a maladaptive disorder, severely impact-
ing an individual’s life. Social anxiety symptomology can 
exist  alone  or  as  a  comorbidity  with  other  psychiatric 
disorders,  including,  most  commonly,  eating  disorders, 
major depression, schizophrenia, and other anxiety dis-
orders  (generalized  anxiety  disorder,  panic  disorder).6,7 
However, the connection between symptom and comor-
bidity is often unclear; a comorbidity can result from the 
same disease process as the disorder itself. To add to the 
complexity,  the  causes  of  social  anxiety  are  multifacto-
rial,  involving  genetics,  neurobiology,  the  fetal  environ-
ment, and the postnatal environment.8
  Multiple  neurological  pathways,  neurotransmitters, 
and brain regions, including the amygdala and anterior 
cingulate, have been studied in regard to social anxiety, 
but many remain unknown.9 Current treatment focuses 
on cognitive behavioral therapy as a first-line treatment 
and  on  medications,  such  as  selective  serotonin  reup-
take  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  or  selective  norepinephrine 
reuptake  inhibitors  (SNRIs),  as  a  second-line  treat-
ment. Occasionally benzodiazepines are used for short-
term relief; less commonly, β-blockers are used in order 
to  control  the  sympathetic  nervous  system.8,10 Despite 
multiple treatment options, treatment is ineffective for 
30% to 40% of patients with social anxiety disorder.11 A 
necessity for more effective treatments exists not only 
for social anxiety disorder but other disorders with a so-
cial impairment component, such as schizophrenia and 
autism. This need has led researchers to explore other 
potential mechanisms involved with social anxiety.
  Oxytocin is a neuropeptide synthesized primarily in 
the  magnocellular  neurons  of  the  paraventricular  and 
supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus.12 Oxytocin plays 
a key role in social cognition, in social behaviors, and in 
fear conditioning, which are important in social anxiety 
as well as in other disorders with impaired social func-
tioning. A plethora of studies have uncovered a role for 
oxytocin  in  intimacy,  social  recognition,  pair  bonding, 
and  anxiety,  among  others.13  Oxytocin  acts  centrally 
within the brain to control behavior, as opposed to its 
well-known  peripheral  role  in  parturition  and  lacta-
tion.13  Oxytocin  receptors  are  distributed  throughout 
the brain, including within the amygdala, ventromedial 
hypothalamus,  brain  stem,  and  nucleus  accumbens.14 
This review will focus on oxytocin’s central role on so-
cial anxiety and social processing as a potential target 
for the treatment of social anxiety and other disorders 
with dysfunction in social processing.

Animal studies and social anxiety

Animal  research  investigating  oxytocin’s  role  in  basic 
behavioral processes has set the foundation for investi-
gation of oxytocin in human illnesses, including autism, 
schizophrenia,  and  anxiety  disorders.  Animal  models 
of social anxiety–related behaviors are vital for under-
standing  the  implications  of  oxytocin  in  human  social 
processing and social anxiety. The following sections ex-
amine  nonprimate  and  nonhuman  primate  studies  for 
social behavior and also anxiety components of social 
anxiety. 

Social behavior

Animal studies have examined the role of oxytocin in 
a variety of mammals, including sheep, mice, and rats.15 
Prairie voles have been of particular interest in oxyto-
cin animal research because they demonstrate selective 
social preference in order to survive and reproduce in 
their  habitats.16,17  Early  animal  studies  demonstrated 
oxytocin’s  ability  to  induce  the  prosocial  behavior  of 
bonding,  both  maternal  bonding  with  offspring  and 
pair bonding.18-20 In voles, pair bonding is measured by 
time spent in proximity of a partner versus a stranger, 
in which more time spent with a partner indicates pair-
bond formation.21,22 Pair bonding can be induced in fe-
male  voles  via  intracerebroventricular  oxytocin  injec-
tion,  or  prevented  by  an  oxytocin  receptor  antagonist 
in  the  nucleus  accumbens  and  prefrontal  cortex.20,23 
Maternal/infant  bonding  has  also  been  demonstrated 
in  voles.24  Individuals  with  social  anxiety  disorder,  as 
well as other disorders such as autism, can struggle with 
forming  and  maintaining  interpersonal  relationships. 
Oxytocin has the potential to facilitate human “bond-
ing” and should be considered in future studies investi-
gating its effects on relationships in people with social 
anxiety or autism. 
  Another aspect of social behavior is social memory, 
the  ability  to  recognize  and  differentiate  between  in-
dividuals.25  Central  oxytocin  administration  enhances 
social memory in male rats,26,27 whereas an oxytocin re-
ceptor antagonist blocks social memory in female and 
male  rats.26-28  Oxytocin  affects  social  memory  in  mul-
tiple brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, lateral 
septum, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala, in nonhu-
man  primates.29-34 These  and  other  studies  suggest  the 
potential of oxytocin to also promote prosocial behav-

iors and enhance social cognition in humans. However, 
social behavior in humans is distinctively different and 
more complex than that of nonprimates like voles and 
rats, which will be discussed below.

Anxiety

Animal  research  has  demonstrated  relationships  be-
tween  oxytocin’s  role  in  anxiety  and  social  behaviors; 
for instance, under stress, oxytocin causes rodents to ap-
proach and maintain closeness with familiar rodents.35-37 
Systemic pretreatment with oxytocin before a stressor 
(flooded  cage)  led  to  a  longer  amount  of  time  spent 
with  other  prairie  voles  after  the  event.38 This  finding 
suggests  that  oxytocin  can  change  stress  neural  con-
nectivity  and  promote  social  cohesion  after  a  stressor 
that usually would cause dispersal.38 This relationship is 
not surprising given oxytocin’s involvement in brain re-
gions such as the amygdala and paraventricular nucleus 
of  the  hypothalamus  where  oxytocin  modulates  fear 
and stress responses.39-42 Specifically, anxiety-provoking 
stimuli activate the oxytocin system by increasing oxy-
tocin neuronal activity, oxytocin gene expression in the 
paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothala-
mus, and central and peripheral release of oxytocin.43-48
  The acute and chronic anxiolytic effects of oxytocin 
have  been  demonstrated  in  a  number  of  rodent  stud-
ies.49  One  method  of  evaluation  used  is  the  elevated 
plus  maze  (EPM).  More  time  spent  in  open  space  in-
dicates  a  successful  anxiolytic  response  for  the  EPM. 
Central  amygdala,  prelimbic  cortex,  and  intracere-
broventricular  administration  of  oxytocin  has  demon-
strated  acute  anxiolytic  effects  in  rodents  in  the  EPM 
test,50-53  whereas  administration  of  oxytocin  receptor 
antagonist  induced  anxiogenic  effects.  Similar  effects 
were shown when chronic anxiolysis was evaluated.54,55 
Oxytocin’s involvement in anxiety-modulating regions 
of the brain and rodent studies demonstrate its anxio-
lytic effects and support the potential for using oxyto-
cin in treatment of anxiety disorders. Figure 1 illustrates 
the  human  implications  of  nonprimate  animal  studies 
on social functioning and anxiety. 

Nonhuman primate studies

and  this  has  led  animal  researchers  to  use  nonhuman 
primate  models  of  human  social  behavior. The  rhesus 
macaque has been a central focus of nonhuman primate 
research because of its complex “human-like” social be-
haviors, including social imitation, perceptional under-
standing, and prosocial behaviors.56 Similar to humans, 
the macaque primarily uses audition and vision for so-
cial communication. Oxytocin receptors reside in areas 
of the brain involved with auditory and sensory stimuli 
processing of the macaque. These include the superior 
colliculus, trapezoid body, ventromedial hypothalamus, 
nucleus  basalis  of  Meynert,  and  the  pedunclopontine 
tegmental nucleus in the rhesus macaque.57
  Rhesus macaques have been studied in several so-
cial  domains  including  social  development,  prosocial 
choices, and social attention . Oxytocin expression may 
depend on the presence of a maternal figure in the ear-
ly  stages  of  life  and  influence  later  prosocial  behavior 
development.  Macaques  reared  by  mothers  have  sig-
nificantly  higher  baseline  oxytocin  cerebrospinal  fluid 
levels at 18, 24, and 36 months of age than those raised 
without  a  mother.58  Mother-reared  macaques  also 
spend more time sitting in close contact and allogroom-
ing (prosocial behaviors), with a significant correlation 
between these social behaviors and cerebrospinal fluid

tively  different  social  behaviors  than  that  of  humans,

oxytocin  levels.58  Prosocial  behaviors  have  also  been 
studied  in  adult  rhesus  macaques.  Macaques  increase 
the number of prosocial choices related to “social dona-
tion” after 2 hours of oxytocin inhalation. The macaque 
administered  oxytocin  made  more  prosocial  choices 
(providing  a  juice  box  to  another  macaque)  than  the 
macaque that did not receive oxytocin.59 These studies 
support  that  overall,  oxytocin  enhances  macaque  pro-
social behavior.56-59
  The  effects  of  intranasal  oxytocin  on  gaze  patterns 
and social vigilance in rhesus macaques has been inves-
tigated as a component of social attention.60 After oxyto-
cin administration, macaques shifted their gaze patterns; 
they increased the amount of time spent gazing at eyes 
and faces of macaque images. In addition, they decreased 
species-typical social vigilance for images of emotional, 
dominant, and unfamiliar macaque faces in images. Simi-
lar responses were observed to images of negative faces 
after oxytocin administration, and in addition, there was 
no  observed  change  in  response  to  neutral  faces.61  A 
possible explanation is that oxytocin reduces activity in 
brain regions that involve attention and arousal, includ-
ing the amygdala, which regulates vigilance, properties of 
faces, and emotional expression.60 
  Decreased social vigilance can lead to prosocial be-
havior. These findings are especially relevant to disor-
ders with social-processing dysfunction. Decreased eye 
contact  is  a  common  symptom  of  multiple  psychiatric 
disorders,  including  autism  and  social  anxiety  disor-
der.62,63  Increased  attention  to  social  situations  per-
ceived as threatening is a component of social anxiety 
disorder.64 Oxytocin is a candidate for both enhancing 
eye contact and helping to alleviate social vigilance in 
social  anxiety  disorder,  without  affecting  social  situa-
tions viewed as neutral or nonthreatening.
  Anxiety  has  also  been  investigated  in  nonhuman 
primates.  Multiple  studies  support  that  administration 
of  oxytocin  in  rhesus  macaques  decreases  cortisol,  a 
glucocorticoid released in response to stress.65 Oxytocin 
both  increases  prosocial  behaviors  and  decreases  sali-
vary cortisol in macaque infants.66 In addition, mother-
reared macaques have decreased plasma cortisol when 
introduced to a new cage with a companion compared 
with  non–mother-reared  macaques.58  As  mentioned 
previously, the mother-reared macaques have increased 
oxytocin expression. No significant difference between 
the two groups was found when the macaques were put 
in a novel cage without a companion. These results indi-

cate an anxiolytic effect in the presence of a companion, 
relating also to the social effects of oxytocin. 

Human studies and social anxiety

The  facilitation  of  prosocial  behaviors  and  anxiolytic 
effects  of  oxytocin  observed  in  animal  research  has 
led  scientists  to  investigate  oxytocin’s  role  in  human 
psychiatric  conditions,  such  as  social  anxiety  disorder, 
schizophrenia, and autism. The anxiolytic effects of oxy-
tocin are supported by research demonstrating dimin-
ished  negative  self-judgment  during  a  social  task  and 
decreased  anxiety  in  response  to  social  rejection.67,68 
Functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  studies  impli-
cate underlying anxiolytic neurocircuitry, as decreased 
fear-associated  amygdala  activity  was  observed  in  re-
sponse to threatening faces in individuals with general-
ized  social  anxiety  disorder.69 Research  has  been  con-
ducted at the molecular level, examining oxytocin genes 
and  plasma  levels,  and  at  the  clinical  level,  evaluating 
the  effectiveness  of  intranasal  oxytocin  as  a  potential 
treatment  for  social  anxiety  disorder  and  other  disor-
ders with social dysfunction (Figure 2).  The impact of 
oxytocin  on  social  impairment  in  multiple  psychiatric 
disorders is discussed below.

Genetic and biochemical studies 

Genetic variations in the oxytocin receptor gene have 
been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, includ-
ing  depression,  mood  disorders,  and  autism  spectrum 
disorders.70,71 The polymorphism (rs53576) of the oxyto-
cin receptor gene is located on the third intron in three 
forms: GG, AA, and AG.72 In past studies, the G allele 
was  found  to  be  connected  with  prosocial  traits  like 
empathy, trust, and optimism; whereas the A allele was 
associated with sensitivity to stress, less optimism, less 
social skills, and lower self-esteem.73,74 Oxytocin recep-
tor  gene  methylation  occurs  in  individuals  with  social 
anxiety  disorder,  including  hypomethylation  at  CpG 
chromosome 3:8809437, which is associated with higher 
scores  on  the  Social  Phobia  Scale  and  Social  Interac-
tion Anxiety  Scale  and  a  greater  degree  of  amygdala 
responsiveness  to  social  phobia–related  words.75  It  is 
unclear whether the hypomethylation is a cause or re-
sult of social anxiety disorder. 
  Oxytocin  plasma  levels  have  also  been  analyzed 
in  individuals  with  social  anxiety  disorder,  although 

196

Oxytocin and social functioning - Jones et al 

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 19 . No. 2 . 2017

results have not been consistent. In one study, plasma 
oxytocin levels showed a positive correlation with social 
anxiety symptom severity.76 However, another study did 
not  fully  support  these  results.  In  individuals  in  close 
relationships, they found a positive correlation between 
oxytocin levels and anxiety but not oxytocin levels and 
avoidance scale scores.77 Human genetic and biochemi-
cal  research  on  the  role  of  oxytocin  in  social  anxiety 
disorder  and  other  social  functioning  disorders  is  still 
being  explored. The  studies  above  suggest  an  associa-
tion, but at this time there are no conclusive results.  

Intranasal oxytocin studies 

Social anxiety disorder

Oxytocin  is  a  9-amino-acid    peptide  that  is  unable  to 
cross the blood brain barrier and enter the central ner-

vous  system.13  Intranasal  administration  has  been  the 
primary means of oxytocin delivery in humans thus far. 
Numerous studies have examined the effects of intrana-
sally administered oxytocin on social anxiety symptoms 
and as an adjunct treatment for social anxiety disorder. 
  The  amygdala  has  been  a  specific  focus  of  human 
oxytocin  research  because  of  its  hyperactivity  in  re-
sponse  to  social  threats  and  fear.78,79 Oxytocin  inhibits 
neurons  in  the  amygdala  that  connect  to  other  brain 
regions associated with fear, including the anterior cin-
gulate cortex (ACC) and the medial prefrontal cortex 
(MPC).80,81  Oxytocin  reduces  increased  activation  of 
the  ACC  and  MPC  in  individuals  with  social  anxiety 
disorder in response to sad faces.81 Intranasal oxytocin 
has also been shown to enhance functional connectiv-
ity between the amygdala and the bilateral insula and 
middle  cingulate/dorsal  cingulate  gyrus  in  individuals 
with social anxiety disorder when shown fearful faces.

These  pathways  are  associated  with  social/emotional 
behavior and suggest that oxytocin heightens activity in 
these regions and dampens activity of pathways related 
to fear response, thus “normalizing” both pathways.82 A 
negative correlation has been described between con-
nectivity of the amygdala-anterior cingulate/prefrontal 
cortex pathway with social anxiety severity at rest. Oxy-
tocin  also  increases  activity  in  the  underactive  rostral 
anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal cortex pathway 
in individuals with social anxiety.83
  Oxytocin  has  also  been  studied  as  an  adjunct  to 
other  therapies  for  social  anxiety.  In  a  randomized 
placebo-controlled  study,  individuals  with  social  anxi-
ety  disorder  were  administered  intranasal  oxytocin  as 
an  adjunct  to  exposure  therapy.84  Statistically  signifi-
cant improvement in positive evaluation of appearance 
and speech performance was demonstrated compared 
with placebo. However, both the placebo and oxytocin 
groups showed significant symptom reduction and im-
provement  in  life  impairment  scores,  indicating  a  sig-
nificant placebo effect. Thus, oxytocin as an adjunct may 
enhance improvement of some characteristics of social 
anxiety disorder but not others. 

Other disorders: schizophrenia, autism, and anorexia

Although the focus has been on social anxiety, it is im-
portant to consider the effects of intranasal oxytocin on 
other disorders with impairments in social function, in-
cluding schizophrenia and autism. Anorexia will also be 
discussed briefly because of a high comorbidity with so-
cial anxiety disorder (the lifetime prevalence has been 
reported as 33.9%).85

Schizophrenia  treatment  primarily  addresses  the 
positive symptoms of the disease but not the negative 
symptoms,  such  as  asociality  and  affective  flattening. 
The  severity  of  these  negative  symptoms  is  strongly 
correlated  with  decline  in  social  function  and  quality 
of life, and attempts to diminish this decline have been 
largely unsuccessful.86 Oxytocin is a potential candidate 
for the treatment of these negative symptoms. Intrana-
sally administered oxytocin in patients with schizophre-
nia has demonstrated an overall decrease both in nega-
tive and positive symptomology scores.87 Six published 
clinical  trials  have  reported  improvement  in  negative 
symptoms  with  intranasal  oxytocin  added  as  an  ad-
junct treatment to atypical antipsychotic medication.88 
Specific improvements in social functioning in patients 

with  schizophrenia  include  increased  ability  to  recog-
nize  emotions  and  improvements  in  high-level  social 
functioning, such as detection of sarcasm, detection of 
deception, and empathy.89,90 Individuals with autism also 
have dysfunction across multiple social domains. They 
show decreased social motivation, social aloofness, di-
minished eye contact, decreased social relationship re-
ward,  and  difficulty  maintaining  social  relationships.91 
Multiple  studies  support  the  conclusion  that  adminis-
tration of intranasal oxytocin in individuals with autism 
increases eye gaze, enhances feelings of trust, increases 
recognition of affective speech, and increases scores on 
the  Reading  the  Mind  in  the  Eyes  Test.92-94  Research 
supports  a  strong  association  between  autism  and 
schizophrenia,95 and studies are currently investigating 
the  neurological,  genetic,  developmental,  and  molecu-
lar  similarities  between  these  illnesses.  Oxytocin  and 
other  novel  treatments  beneficial  to  one  should  thus 
also be considered in the other.
  Anorexia  differs  greatly  from  schizophrenia  and 
autism, but one commonality is that social impairment 
can be a marked component of the disorder.6 Oxytocin 
clinical  trials  have  had  mixed  results  in  improvement 
of  anorexia  symptoms,  and  relatively  few  specific  so-
cial  dysfunction  symptoms  have  been  studied.96-98 One 
study found that oxytocin significantly decreased atten-
tion toward “eating” stimuli and “negative body image” 
stimuli in patients with anorexia. Specific to social dys-
function,  these  results  were  most  apparent  in  anorex-
ics with higher levels of autistic-specific traits, indicat-
ing  that  the  potential  benefit  of  oxytocin  in  anorexics 
could be most effective in those with concurrent social 
difficulties.94 It remains unclear whether oxytocin plas-
ma levels are reduced in anorexia nervosa at baseline. 
Some  studies  have  indicated  lower  levels  of  oxytocin; 
however, others have shown increases in plasma oxyto-
cin after eating.99 Future research implications include 
investigation  of  the  role  of  oxytocin  in  anorexics  with 
specific symptoms related to social dysfunction.

Clinical implications for oxytocin in social 
anxiety treatment/discussion

Researchers  investigating  the  neural  impact  of  oxy-
tocin  have  primarily  used  the  intranasal  route  of  ad-
ministration.  Because  oxytocin  is  unable  to  cross  the 
blood-brain  barrier,  intravenous  and  oral  administra-
tion  of  oxytocin  are  ineffective.99 Although  intranasal 

198

 
Oxytocin and social functioning - Jones et al 

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 19 . No. 2 . 2017

administration provides some degree of central access, 
the bioavailability of exogenous oxytocin in the central 
nervous system is limited for a number of reasons. First, 
oxytocin, like any other peptide, will scarcely pass the 
blood-brain barrier and will be subject to degradation 
in the living organism. Second, upon intranasal admin-
istration,  oxytocin  can  be  absorbed  through  the  nasal 
mucosa in multiple compartments, each of which varies 
in their absorption capacity and influences the amount 
of oxytocin that reaches the cerebrospinal fluid versus 
systemic circulation.100 Thus, the prosocial behaviors or 
anxiolysis  after  oxytocin  administration  could  result 
from multiple pathways: a direct pathway through the 
olfactory bulb to the cerebrospinal fluid, an indirect pe-
ripheral pathway that through a possible feed-forward 
mechanism influences central nervous system release of 
endogenous oxytocin, or other routes, such as through 
the oral mucosa and through a gastroenteric route.101,102 
Intranasal  oxytocin  bioavailability  is  likely  to  vary 
widely because of multiple factors. 
  Despite  these  factors,  intranasal  administration  of 
oxytocin has yielded positive results in improvement of 
social dysfunction across multiple psychiatric disorders. 
Until  other  methods  of  delivery  are  developed,  these 
results warrant continuation of intranasal oxytocin re-
search  in  social  anxiety  disorder.  Currently,  research-
ers  are  attempting  to  create  small-molecule  oxytocin-
receptor activators that hold promise for exposing the 
brain  to  high  levels  of  oxytocin  after  oral  administra-
tion. Important to advancement of these future analogs 

and  intranasal  oxytocin  is  evidence  of  target  engage-
ment.  Additional  studies  can  investigate  the  relation-
ship  between  specific  regional  receptor  binding  in  the 
brain and therapeutic outcome at controlled dosages of 
intranasal oxytocin.103 Future research may also include 
investigation of other neurotransmitters and neuropep-
tides implicated in social dysfunction pathophysiology. 
Multiple  such  molecules  have  been  suggested  to  be 
involved  in  the  pathophysiology  of  social  anxiety.  Of 
particular importance is the neuropeptide vasopressin. 
Research also supports the role of vasopressin—closely 
related to oxytocin—in maintaining social relationships 
and pair bonding.104 One consideration for future inves-
tigation of social functioning is whether social dysfunc-
tion in psychiatric disorders results from an imbalance 
in oxytocin and vasopressin neural activity.

In summary, research provides evidence for the role 
of  oxytocin  in  the  pathophysiology  of  social  dysfunc-
tion  across  the  span  of  multiple  psychiatric  disorders 
through  its  impact  on  social  vigilance,  positive  social 
evaluation,  prosocial  behaviors,  and  anxiolytic  effects. 
Future  implications  include  research  supporting  oxy-
tocin target engagement, dose relationship of oxytocin 
with  therapeutic  effects,  and  consideration  of  other 
neural  peptides  and  neurotransmitters  in  social  func-
tioning pathophysiology. o

cial  existen  diversas  modalidades  terapéuticas  (terapia 
cognitivo conductual, inhibidores selectivos de la recap-
tura de serotonina, inhibidores selectivos de la recaptu-
ra  de  serotonina  y  noradrenalina,  y  benzodiacepinas), 
ellas  resultan  efectivas  en  no  más  del  60%  a  70%  de 
los pacientes. Debido a esto, los investigadores han bus-
cado otras opciones de terapia para la ansiedad social. 
Esta revisión se enfoca en el péptido oxitocina como una 
potencial opción terapéutica para sujetos con ansiedad 
social. La investigación animal tanto de primates como 
de no primates da soporte al papel de la oxitocina en la 
facilitación  de  las  conductas  pro-sociales  y  sus  efectos 
ansiolíticos. Los estudios en humanos muestran asocia-
ciones significativas entre la ansiedad social y los alelos 
del gen del receptor de oxitocina, como también de la 
ansiedad  social  y  los  niveles  plasmáticos  de  oxitocina. 
Además,  la  administración  de  oxitocina  intranasal  en 
humanos tiene efectos favorables para la sintomatolo-
gía de la ansiedad social. Otras patologías, incluyendo 
el  autismo,  la  esquizofrenia  y  la  anorexia  tienen  com-
ponentes de la ansiedad social en sus fisiopatologías. En 
este artículo se discute el papel terapéutico de la oxito-
cina para la disfunción social en estas patologías.         

L’anxiété  sociale  est  une  forme  d’anxiété  caractérisée 
par  la  peur  permanente  d’une  ou  plusieurs  situations 
sociales ou de performance. De nombreuses modalités 
de traitement existent pour l’anxiété sociale, (thérapie 
cognitive  comportementale,  inhibiteurs  sélectifs  de  la 
recapture  de  la  sérotonine,  inhibiteurs  sélectifs  de  la 
recapture  de  la  noradrénaline,  benzodiazépines),  mais 
elles ne sont efficaces que pour 60 à 70 % des patients. 
Des  chercheurs  ont  donc  examiné  d’autres  possibilités 
de traitement de l’anxiété sociale. Cet article s’intéresse 
au  peptide  ocytocine  comme  traitement  éventuel  des 
personnes atteintes d’anxiété sociale. La recherche chez 
les  animaux,  à  la  fois  chez  les  primates  et  les  non-pri-
mates,  confirme  que  l’ocytocine  facilite  les  comporte-
ments pro-sociaux et a des effets anxiolytiques. D’après 
des études chez l’homme, il existe des associations signi-
ficatives entre l’anxiété sociale et les allèles du gène du 
récepteur de l’ocytocine ainsi qu’entre l’anxiété sociale 
et les concentrations plasmatiques d’ocytocine. De plus, 
l’administration  intranasale  d’ocytocine  chez  l’homme 
a des effets bénéfiques sur les symptômes de l’anxiété 
sociale. Nous analysons ensuite le rôle thérapeutique de 
l’ocytocine  sur  le  dysfonctionnement  social    dans  l’au-
tisme, la schizophrénie et l’anorexie, des troubles dont 
la physiopathologie présente une composante d’anxiété 
sociale.
