Abstract
Background: Dignity therapy is psychotherapy to relieve psychological and existential distress in patients at the end of life. Little is 
known about its effect.
Aim: To analyse the outcomes of dignity therapy in patients with advanced life-threatening diseases.
Design: Systematic review was conducted. Three authors extracted data of the articles and evaluated quality using Critical Appraisal 
Skills Programme. Data were synthesized, considering study objectives.
Data  sources:  PubMed,  CINAHL,  Cochrane  Library  and  PsycINFO.  The  years  searched  were  2002  (year  of  dignity  therapy 
development)  to  January  2016.  ‘Dignity  therapy’  was  used  as  search  term.  Studies  with  patients  with  advanced  life-threatening 
diseases were included.
Results: Of 121 studies, 28 were included. Quality of studies is high. Results were grouped into effectiveness, satisfaction, suitability 
and feasibility, and adaptability to different diseases and cultures. Two of five randomized control trials applied dignity therapy to 
patients  with  high  levels  of  baseline  psychological  distress.  One  showed  statistically  significant  decrease  on  patients’  anxiety  and 
depression scores over time. The other showed statistical decrease on anxiety scores pre–post dignity therapy, not on depression. 
Nonrandomized  studies  suggested  statistically  significant  improvements  in  existential  and  psychosocial  measurements.  Patients, 
relatives and professionals perceived it improved end-of-life experience.
Conclusion: Evidence suggests that dignity therapy is beneficial. One randomized controlled trial with patients with high levels of 
psychological distress shows DT efficacy in anxiety and depression scores. Other design studies report beneficial outcomes in terms 
of end-of-life experience. Further research should understand how dignity therapy functions to establish a means for measuring its 
impact and assessing whether high level of distress patients can benefit most from this therapy.

What is already known about the topic?

•• DT was recently developed to relieve psychological and existential distress in patients at end of life. Originally was 

conceived for patients with low levels of distress.

•• DT seems to affect several dimensions of patients but the process and the way of measuring the impact of the inter-

vention are not clear.

What this paper adds?

•• This paper provides a critical and comprehensive view about DT including primary and secondary study results, which 

is key to have an overview of the therapy.

•• This review offers for the first time the vision of all the participants in the process: patients, relatives and health 

professionals, showing that they are satisfied and would recommend DT as they find it helpful and useful.

•• This paper points out that DT might be more beneficial for patients with high levels of distress, a group population 

where initially DT was not recommended.

Implications for practice, theory or policy

•• The literature suggest benefits from DT for end of life patients as patients, families and health professionals found it 

helpful and are satisfied with the intervention.
Patients with high levels of distress seem to benefit more from DT, for that reason further research is needed to 
prove this.
Evidence suggests that DT can be adapted for patients with moto neurone disease and for the elderly.

Background

Search strategy

Recent years have seen significant progress towards con-
trolling physical symptoms associated with advanced dis-
ease, but when it comes to related emotional aspects and 
addressing patients’ psychosocial and spiritual difficulties 
progress has been less obvious.1

As a disease progresses and the end approaches, emo-
tional suffering increases and patients’ sense of dignity is 
easily  shaken.2  In  this  context,  Chochinov2  developed  in 
2002 dignity therapy (DT), a brief psychotherapy based on 
an empirical model of dignity that begins with reflection on 
why some patients with advanced disease wish to die, while 
others find serenity and a desire to enjoy their last days.

DT is a brief, individualized psychotherapy and aims to 
relieve  psycho-emotional  and  existential  distress  and  to 
improve the experiences of patients whose lives are threat-
ened by illness. This therapy offers patients an opportunity 
to  reflect  on  issues  that  are  important  to  them  or  other 
things that they would like to recall or transmit to others.

This  psychotherapy’s  protocol  begins  giving  to  the 
patient nine standard questions which are options for the 
patients’ consideration and reflection about what they want 
to say (Figure 1). The questions will guide a conversation 
with  a  DT-trained  healthcare  professional.  Patients  are 
given  the  questions  in  advance  in  order  to  familiarize 
themselves with the possibilities DT provides in terms of 
broaching areas they may wish to discuss. The session is 
recorded, transcribed and edited, after which a legacy doc-
ument is produced and delivered to the patient.

DT  stands  out  for  its  simplicity  and  for  its  ability  to 
enhance  the  meaning,  direction  and  dignity  of  life  for 
patients and their families.3 There is no evidence in how 
DT  really  works.  There  is  lack  of  a  comprehensive  per-
spective  of  the  different  stakeholders  who  participate  in 
the process (patient, family and health professionals) and 
of the cultural context. This article presents a comprehen-
sive  systematic  literature  review  of  studies  in  which  DT 
has been used for patients with life-threatening diseases.

Design

A  comprehensive  systematic  review4  using  PRISMA 
guideline was conducted.5

A sensitive search looking for articles, published in English 
and  Spanish  between  January  2002  and  January  2016, 
including the term ‘DT’ was carried out in PubMed (n = 49 
articles),  CINAHL  (n = 30  articles),  Cochrane  Library 
(n = 15 articles) and PsycINFO (n = 25 articles) (Figure 2). 
Additional studies were identified by contacting experts in 
DT and searching bibliographies.

Selection criteria

The  inclusion  criteria  were  as  follows:  DT  studies  in 
patients  with  advanced  life-threatening  diseases,  regard-
less of the design. Editorials, commentaries and publica-
tions on research protocols were excluded. Articles were 
first selected on the basis of title and abstract and then fil-
tered  after  reading  the  complete  article.  Disagreements 
between  reviewers  were  resolved  by  consensus  among 
four researchers.

Data collection and analysis process

Independent  data  extraction  from  articles  was  made  by 
three authors using predefined data template (aim, type of 
study, sample, data collection, results). The quality of arti-
cles was evaluated through the tools developed by Critical 
Appraisal  Skills  Programme  (CASP)  to  read  and  check 
critically health research. These tools consist of checklists 
with screening questions and hints to assess and interpret 
articles’ quality considering methodological issues.6

Data were synthesized, considering the studies’ objec-

tives and the results, and are presented in thematic areas.

Results

In total, 121 articles were identified. After removing dupli-
cates and the title and abstract screening, 28 articles were 
included. All but five articles7–11 scored above 7/10 with 
the  CASP  critical  reading  process  (Table  1). The  studies 
included  were  conducted  in  the  United  Kingdom  (n = 7), 
the United States (n = 5), Canada (n = 4), Australia (n = 3), 
Denmark  (n = 2),  Portugal  (n = 3),  Sweden  (n = 1),  Japan 
(n = 2) and Spain (n = 2).

Dignity Psychotherapy Question Protocol

1. 

2. 

3. 

 Tell me a little about your life history; particularly the parts that you either remember most or think are the 
most important? When did you feel most alive?

 Are there specific things that you would want your family to know about you, and are there particular things 
you would want them to remember?

 What are the most important roles you have played in life (family roles, vocational roles, community-service 
roles, etc.)? Why were they so important to you and what do you think you accomplished in those roles?

4.  What are your most important accomplishments and what do you feel most proud of?

5. 

 Are there particular things that you feel still need to be said to your loved ones or things that you would want to 
take the time to say once again?

6.  What are your hopes and dreams for your loved ones?

7. 

8. 

 What have you learned about life that you would want to pass along to others? What advice or words of 
guidance would you wish to pass along to your son, daughter, husband, wife, parents, other(s)?

 Are there words or perhaps even instructions that you would like to offer your family to help prepare them for 
the future?

9. 

In creating this permanent record, are there other things that you would like to include?

The results are grouped on effectiveness of DT, satis-
faction, suitability and feasibility, adaptation to other cul-
tures and populations, and each article’s contribution to the 
various themes is shown in Table 1.

identified.11,15,16,19,24,29,33 Chochinov’s group conducted the 
first randomized study on DT with 441 patients receiving 
palliative  care  (PC)  with  advanced  disease  and  a  life 
expectancy equal to or less than 6 months.15 Their research 
aimed to determine whether or not DT (n = 108) is better 
than standard PC (n = 111) and client-centred care (CCC) 
(n = 107)  in  terms  of  reducing  psychological,  existential, 
and spiritual distress. CCC is a type of psychotherapeutic 
support approach that focuses on non-generativity themes, 
that  is,  on  here-and-now  issues.  Different  measurements 
were implemented at the beginning and at the completion 
of the intervention: the Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy–Spiritual well-being (FACIT-Sp), a scale 
that  evaluates  spiritual  well-being;  the  Patient  Dignity

Inventory (PDI), to evaluate distress related to patient dig-
nity  and  the  Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale 
(HADS), to evaluate anxiety and depression in the hospital 
setting. In addition, two quality-of-life measurements, the 
Edmonton  Symptom  Assessment  Scale  (ESAS)  and  a 
scale that measures the will to live, were used.

They found that patients who participated in the study 
had  low  baseline  levels  of  distress,  assessed  by  HADS. 
The  post-intervention  scores  showed  DT  group  had 
decreased depression scores and increased anxiety scores 
although these were not significant15 (Table 2).

Another randomized clinical trial aimed to assess DT’s 
potential  effectiveness  in  reducing  distress  in  advanced 
cancer patients (n = 45) referred to PC teams.16 While no 
part of the DT protocol, this study included interest in dig-
nity as an entry criteria for patients offered DT. The inter-
vention group received DT and standard PC (n = 22) and 
the control group standard PC alone (n = 23).

Different outcomes were evaluated at the baseline and 1 
and 4 weeks after the ‘generativity’ document was deliv-
ered:  PDI,  the  Herth  Hope  Index  (HHI)  for  measuring 
sense  of  hope,  HADS,  EQ-5D  and  a  satisfaction

questionnaire for  measuring  health-related quality  of  life 
and satisfaction with quality of life. No significant differ-
ences  were  identified  on  the  PDI  between  groups  at  any 
time point; observing in the control group an improvement 
in  dignity-related  stress  along  the  follow-up  compared 
with baseline data. In the intervention group, there was a 
slight improvement in the first week which was not main-
tained at fourth week16 (Table 2). Regarding hope, the con-
trol group observed a decrease during the follow-up, and 
the intervention group observed an improvement at weeks 
1 and 4, compared with baseline data.16

A  randomized  clinical  trial  was  conducted  with  60 
elderly  patients  in  nursing  homes.19  The  intervention 
group  was  treated  with  DT  (n = 31)  and  the  control  
group  with  standard  psychosocial  care  group  (n = 29).   
The  following  measures  were  assessed  in  both  groups  
at  the  baseline  and  at  weeks  1  and  8:  PDI,  Geriatric 
Depression Scale (Short Form), HHI and Quality-of-Life 
Questionnaire. Baseline data measured by the PDI showed 
low  distress  levels  related  to  dignity;  hopefulness  and 
quality-of-life levels were high. In both groups, PDI score 
increased after 1 week and decreased at week 8 and hope-
fulness  and  quality-of-life  levels  were  high.  No  signifi-
cant  differences  between  the  intervention  and  control 
groups were found on the evaluation timeline19 (Table 2).
In Portugal, 80 terminal patients were randomized to an 
intervention group receiving DT plus standard PC (n = 39) 
and into a control group receiving only standard palliative 
care (SPC) (n = 41).29 The HADS showed that patients had 
a  high  level  of  distress  at  baseline  (T1;  HADS  depres-
sion > 11 in both groups), and it was measured also 4, 15 
and 30 days after the end of DT (T2, T3 and T4, respec-
tively).  The  preliminary  results  with  60  patients  (DT, 
n = 29;  PC,  n = 31)24  found  decrease  in  depressive  symp-
toms in the DT group after 4 days compared with baseline 
data and 15 days, but not at 30 days (Table 2). They also 
found  a  significant  decrease  in  anxiety  according  to  the 
various measures.24 In a later publication with the results 
of  80  patients  (DT,  n = 39;  SPC,  n = 41),  while  the  DT 
group  always  showed  better  scores  than  at  baseline  for 
both  depression  and  anxiety,  the  control  group  always 
showed worse scores than at baseline. The differences at 
follow-up  (4,  15  and  30 days)  between  DT  and  control 
groups were statistically significant29 (Table 2). In a sec-
ondary analysis, they studied whether DT offered a signifi-
cantly higher survival compared to SPC. The survival time 
for DT group was higher (26.1 vs 20.8 days)33 (Table 2).

The most recent pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
was  carried  out  in  Spain  at  a  home  care  unit  with  64 
patients assigned to two therapy groups: DT (n = 32) and 
counselling  (C)  (n = 32),  although  limited  information  is 
provided  regarding  how  the  therapies  were  conducted.11 
The  measurement  instruments  employed  were  PDI, 
HADS,  Brief  Resilient  Coping  Scale  (BRCS),  GES 
Questionnaire  of  spirituality,  Duke-UNC-11  Functional 

Social Support Questionnaire and 2 items of the EORTC-
QLQ-C30 of quality of life. They report statistically sig-
nificant  differences  with  respect  to  the  dimensions  of 
dignity, anxiety, spirituality and QoL comparing pre–post 
data within DT group. The data provided for counselling 
group compare the post-counselling with DT group’s base-
line data so the comparison is not meaningful. Depression 
increased significantly in the DT group after the interven-
tion,  and  there  were  no  differences  with  respect  to  resil-
ience. They also calculated the differences between groups 
post intervention and found statistically significant differ-
ences  in  anxiety,  with  lower  scores  in  the  counselling 
group DT versus counselling (Table 2). However, there is 
no  comparison  about  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  among 
the interventions.

Nonrandomized  studies.  In  Canada,  a  non-randomized 
study was conducted to evaluate DT’s impact on psycho-
social  and  existential  distress  (n = 100).13  Distress  was 
assessed using the Structured Interview for Symptoms and 
Concerns  (SISC)  –  a  tool  measuring  depression,  dignity, 
anxiety, pain, hope, desire to die, suicide and well-being. 
This also included the ESAS and 2 items to measure qual-
ity of life and a scale measuring will to live. They evalu-
ated  these  pre-  and  post-DT  aspects.  In  addition,  a 
satisfaction questionnaire was used to assess participants’ 
perception of DT.

The  suffering  measure  showed  significant  improve-
ment post intervention, as well as self-reported depression 
(Table 2). No significant changes were found in scores of 
despair,  wanting  to  die,  anxiety  and  suicide. They  found 
that  family  support  correlated  positively  and  moderately 
with  meaning  in  life  and  sense  of  direction  and  weakly 
with  sense  of  suffering  and  will  to  live.  Patients  who 
reported  greater  initial  psychosocial  distress  benefited 
from  therapy,  which  was  reflected  in  weak  correlations 
with quality of life, satisfaction of quality of life and desire 
for death13 (Table 2).

Two pre- and post studies have evaluated DT’s effec-
tiveness with patients suffering from Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis (ALS).27,31 The first one was conducted with 29 
patients  assessing  the  following  aspects  at  baseline  and 
1 week  after  completing  the  DT:  HHI,  FACIT-sp,  PDI, 
ALS  Assessment  Questionnaire  and  ALS  Cognitive 
Behavioural Screen. They were also sent a 25-item ques-
tionnaire  to  explore  DT’s  suitability,  adding  three  items 
about  hope  and  social  support  (5-point  Likert  scale). At 
baseline, the group was hopeful, but experienced low-dig-
nity-related distress and seemed to feel that their spiritual 
well-being was low. No significant changes in hope, dig-
nity and spirituality between the pre- and post-intervention 
assessments  were  found27  (Table  2),  but  participants  and 
families considered DT was very helpful.

The  second  study  was  conducted  with  motor  neuron 
disease  (MND)  patients  (n = 27)  and  their  families 

504 

Palliative Medicine 31(6)

(n = 18).31 The PDI, QoL, FACIT-sp, HHI, HADS for fam-
ily members and Zarit for the caregiver were administrated 
pre–post DT (1 week after handing the DT document). In 
this study, no significant changes were found before and 
after  DT  on  measures  of  dignity-related  distress,  or  in 
quality of life, spiritual well-being or hope (Table 2). No 
differences in measures related to caregiver burden, anxi-
ety  depression  or  hope  were  found,31  but  participants 
reported DT was helpful for them and their families, as in 
other studies.27

A quasi-experimental study with data on the impact of 
DT on advanced cancer patients was carried out in Spain 
(n = 16). Patients’ discomfort and suffering were assessed 
by HADS and visual analogic scales of well-being and suf-
fering  at  the  baseline  and  1 week  after,  as  well  as  some 
questions  about  satisfaction  and  usefulness.  The  results 
show  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  anxiety 
and well-being. However, there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference for depression and serenity10 (Table 2).

Satisfaction, suitability and feasibility of DT

Patients’  general  satisfaction  with  DT.  In  2005,  Chochinov 
et al.13 carried out a DT satisfaction survey, assessed with 
a 0- to 7-point ordinal scale, in 100 hospice patients. Most 
of the patients were satisfied (⩾4 points; 91%) with DT. 
The majority considered it useful or very useful and help-
ful  for  them  and  their  families.  More  than  half  said  it 
increased their sense of dignity, hope, and their sense of 
purpose.  In  all,  47%  of  participants  indicated  that  DT 
increased their desire to live13 (Table 2).

Later Chochinov study results are along the same lines. 
Patients  participating  in  the  first  (RCT  on  DT  (n = 441) 
showed  improvements  in  perception  on  various  dimen-
sions of end-of-life experience.15 The DT group found the 
intervention  more  helpful  and  had  improved  perceptions 
on quality of life, sense of dignity and perceptions of sad-
ness  or  depression  improved.  Perceived  improvements 
concerning quality of life and sense of dignity were greater 
and statistically significant in the DT group. In addition, 
patients  reported  that  it  also  changed  how  their  families 
saw  and  appreciated  them  and  that  it  was  useful  for  the 
family. Patients perceived DT was also significantly better 
than PC at reducing sadness or depression15 (Table 2).

In another RCT on DT,16 patients in the intervention group 
were more positive than the control group on all the scores 
related to self-perceived benefits after 4 weeks: help received, 
greater  sense  of  purpose,  although  greater  meaning  in  life, 
and family support were not statistically significant (Table 2).
Subsequent studies have further examined participants’ 
satisfaction using more qualitative approaches. In one case 
study,21  three  PC  patients  with  high  levels  of  dignity-
related distress were chosen as cases. The patients believed 
that DT was useful for them and would be so for their fam-
ilies.  Levels  of  dignity-related  distress  increased  in  two 

patients 4 weeks after the therapy, but not in the third; but 
scores always remained lower than at baseline (Table 2); 
as it remained below the baseline level, the patients contin-
ued to believe that DT had been worthwhile. Along those 
lines, the three patients reported aspects such as DT help-
ing to become aware that his life has not always been a life 
of illness and disability, allowing to accept limitations and 
providing opportunities to explore feelings and fears and 
reveal suffering to family members (Table 2).

Another  study,22  which  compares  elderly  participants’ 
perceptions  in  a  DT  (n = 25)  and  control  group  (n = 24), 
revealed differences and similarities (Table 2). Some par-
ticipants  considered  the  legacy  document  useful  and  it 
made  them  feel  important,  while  other  comments  were 
quite neutral. Others felt that the legacy document opened 
up their family history, reviewing positive aspects of their 
lives and sharing their stories and would help to be remem-
bered after they died. Participants appreciated their inter-
action with the therapist as a positive change in their daily 
routine  after  the  DT.  Neither  group  thought  that  it  had 
helped  them  with  their  problems  related  to  coping  with 
loss and distress symptoms22 (Table 2).

In a similar study with cancer patients who were being 
treated with PC, similarities and differences between the 
control (n = 23) and DT (n = 22) groups were also found.23 
The legacy document was identified as an opportunity to 
feel that their life was worthwhile and say things that they 
could not say in person. In both groups, patients reported 
feeling  more  positive  and  motivated  to  do  things.  They 
also mentioned the interviewer and therapist’s abilities in 
that they made them feel good. In addition, in both groups, 
but  more  so  in  the  DT  group,  they  noted  that  they  had 
reviewed  their  life  and  improved  communication  with 
their families and that it had influenced their personal rela-
tionships23 (Table 2).

Regarding  possible  distress  caused  by  the  therapy  or 
research, many participants described positive experiences 
regarding  their  participation.  Nobody  mentioned  being 
particularly distressed, but some showed a bit of concern 
with the content of their legacy document and the recipi-
ents’ possible reactions to it.23 The presence of these con-
cerns  raises  the  question  of  how  DT  was  applied,  as  the 
protocol  includes  helping  directly  patients  so  that  they 
shape  their  document  in  a  way  that  will  not  cause  them 
distress  or  problems  or  inflict  harm  to  recipients  of  the 
document.  In  a  small  sample  of  terminally  ill  patients 
(n = 4),  compared  to  baseline,  post-intervention  mean 
depression  and  anxiety  scores  increased  (Table  2). 
However, the majority of patients believed that the therapy 
had been helpful to them and their families.9 Another study 
confirms  patient’s  positive  perception  of  DT  in  patients 
with colorectal cancer.30 More than two-thirds of the par-
ticipants  (n = 15)  reported  that  DT  was  helpful  and 
increased their sense of meaning, sense of dignity and pur-
pose and their will to live30 (Table 2).

Families’ general satisfaction with DT.  One study asked fam-
ily  members  retrospectively  (n = 60)  about  their  percep-
tions of DT’s impact.7 The vast majority considered that it 
had helped the patient. More than two-thirds believed that 
the patient’s perception of dignity and meaning in life had 
increased and more than half that the therapy had helped 
the  patient  in  preparing  for  death  and  emphasized  the 
importance  of  implementing  this  therapy  as  part  of  care 
(Table 2). In all, 43% said DT reduced their loved one’s 
suffering.7  Similarly,  in  a  recent  study,  89%  of  families 
said the therapy was helpful for patients with ALS.31

A qualitative study carried out in Canada in 24 relatives 
pointed that DT was believed helpful to their loved ones, 
and more than half felt that it was an important component 
of their loved ones’ care18 (Table 2). They also stated that 
DT gave them the opportunity to discuss their feelings and 
reflect on their lives.18 In another study, the families of the 
elderly  saw  DT  positively  and  they  mentioned  that  the 
interaction with the therapist was valuable for their elderly 
family member by providing them company and helping 
them  assesses  their  life  positively.  In  addition,  family 
members  highlighted  that  DT  offers  the  opportunity  to 
communicate and get to know new parts of their lives.20

As for the therapy’s influence on the family, no signifi-
cant results in terms of burnout syndrome, anxiety, depres-
sion  or  an  increase  in  hope  are  available  in  the  two 
identified  studies  measuring  DT’s  impact  on  the  family 
using pre–post measurements26,31 (Table 2). However, rel-
atives  of  ALS  patients  appreciated  DT  and  felt  that  it 
would help them during the grieving period26 (Table 2).

The studies coincide in showing that family members 
feel that DT helps them7,9,20 (Table 2). In several studies, 
about 70% of families mentioned that the legacy document 
will  be  of  great  help  to  them  both  at  present  and  in  the 
future.7,26,31 At the same time, some relatives wonder about 
the  possible  negative  impact  of  the  legacy  document,7,20 
depending  on  the  family’s  level  of  acceptance  regarding 
the patient’s death or on the present relationship between 
the  patient  and  his/her  relatives.26  This  underscores  why 
therapists  must  be  skilled  in  helping  patients  navigate 
through  DT,  hence  mitigating  possible  negative  conse-
quences of generativity documents on recipients.

Families  recommend  DT  to  other  patients  and  their 
families  in  the  same  situation,  ranging  from  70%31  to 
95%.7 Other study shows how the 33.3% of families noted 
that  their  stress  was  reduced  and  hopes  raised,  50% 
reported that it was useful in facing death, and 72% agreed 
that DT is and will remain a source of comfort for them.7,31

Professionals’ satisfaction regarding DT.  Health professionals’ 
perceptions regarding DT have been assessed in some arti-
cles,  including  the  views  of  physicians,  nurses,  social 
workers, psychiatrics and chaplains.

In  a  qualitative  study  with  18  PC  professionals,  they 
considered DT worthwhile because it reduced the patient’s 

pain  and  suffering.25  In  addition,  the  majority  of  profes-
sionals felt that it would be helpful for the patient’s family 
in  the  future  and  suggested  therapy  to  patients  because 
they thought that it helped them to reflect on their lives and 
share stories and lessons (Table 2). In all, 50% of profes-
sionals believed DT reaffirmed patients’ beliefs and values 
and gave them meaning in life; they also thought it would 
help their suffering related to dignity and prepare them for 
the future.25 Regarding the influence that the therapy had 
on  professionals,  they  were  able  to  get  to  know  patients 
who  allowed  them  to  read  their  legacy  documents  better 
and to be more in tune with them, increasing their job sat-
isfaction.25 Professionals held that DT had a positive effect 
on  how  they  provided  care  and  how  they  assessed  the 
patient  and  had  helped  them  to  better  understand  the 
patient18 (Table 2).

Suitability  of  DT.  Studies report high participating rates 
(>80%)13,17 and low dropout rate (22%).13 Only a Japa-
nese  study  reports  low  participating  rates  (14%).8  In 
fact,  those  who  refused  to  participate  were  concerned 
that  it  would  make  them  think  about  death  and  won-
dered  why  it  was  offered  to  them  while  they  were 
dying.8  This  raise  questions  about  how  DT  was  pre-
sented, as DT has been done with non-terminal popula-
tions and in those context is presented as an opportunity 
for  reminiscence  and  personal  reflection.  DT  must 
always  be  offered  in  a  way  that  respects  the  patient’s 
healthy  defences  and  is  mindful  of  their  degree  of 
acceptance regarding their prognosis8 (Table 2).

Several studies have analysed the suitability of DT by 
measuring  whether  participants  consider  it  useful  or 
helpful.16,19,26,27,31 One study showed that cancer patients 
who  received  DT  perceived  that  they  were  more  sup-
ported than those receiving standard care, as well as had 
more  purpose  in  their  lives16  (Table  2).  In  a  qualitative 
study in patients with ALS (n = 29), the vast majority of 
them  considered  the  DT  satisfactory  or  helpful.  They 
reported greater benefits in the areas of dignity related to 
unfinished  business,  but  less  in  feeling  like  a  burden, 
increase in will to live and decrease in sadness or depres-
sion.  The  majority  considered  it  useful  for  their  family 
and would recommend it to other ALS patients27 (Table 
2). ALS patients’ relatives identified positive impacts of 
DT on the patient regarding themselves, and more rela-
tives transmitted that DT was helpful to them (n = 9), but 
some did not (n = 4). Relatives reported greater benefits 
in the areas of DT legacy as a source of comfort for them, 
but less in reducing their feelings of stress as a carer or 
helping feel closer to their partner.26

A Swedish study analyses the suitability of DT consid-
ering data and reflections from professionals involved in 
its development with eight patients.34 Professionals believe 
that  many  patients  are  not  suited  for  DT  because  their 
health  deteriorates  so  rapidly  and  because  of  frailty  or 

506 

Palliative Medicine 31(6)

cognitive  impairment.  Professionals  also  pondered  the 
lack of clarity on what kind of patient could most benefit 
from  therapy.  In  addition,  some  patients  (n = 11)  refused 
therapy because they considered it largely ineffective for 
immediate  needs  or  because  they  saw  it  as  difficult  to 
physically or emotionally sustain. The retrospective analy-
sis of the data suggests that they may have overzealously 
followed  the  DT  question  framework  and  at  times  inad-
vertently steered away the patient from her own objectives 
in forming her legacy,34 which raise questions about thera-
pist’s preparation to conduct DT.

Feasibility of DT.  Some studies consider the influence that 
the  patient’s  cognitive  or  physical  condition  has  during 
the  course  of  therapy  on  DT  feasibility.  In  a  Canadian 
study with elderly patients, the results regarding DT were 
positive,18 more than half of patients accepting to partici-
pate.  In  other  study,  it  was  expected  to  systematically 
recruit  patients  to  DT  among  those  enrolled  in  the  spe-
cialized  palliative  home  care  service,  but  this  resulted 
less feasible than expected. Staff deemed DT unsuitable 
for 52 of 62 patients due to patients’ deterioration, frailty 
and cognitive impairment. Besides, 11 of the 19 patients 
who were directly approached choose not to participate.34 
In  a  study  conducted  with  patients  with  early-state 
dementia, participants did not have difficulties to recol-
lect minute details from the past although it is mentioned 
the need for the time between meetings to be fairly short 
to help with memory.32

In  addition,  a  study  of ALS  patients  living  with  their 
families in metropolitan and rural areas in Australia lists 
aspects  that  need  to  be  considered  when  calculating  the 
costs necessary for the completion of this therapy (medical 
training, interviews, document editing and getting to and 
from  appointments).  Considering  these  aspects  on  their 
experience,  they  say  that  therapy  is  unfeasible  in  small 
organizations with limited resources, although still feasi-
ble in larger places.31

Another study of patients treated with PC services pro-
vides the economic cost of DT and argues that the cost is 
reasonable and profitable for the organization17 (Table 2). 
Thus, a majority of healthcare professionals believed that 
despite  the  added  cost,  the  expense  was  worthwhile.25 
Finally, there was a study on DT’s feasibility via telemedi-
cine. In the study, they concluded that telemedical DT is 
feasible  because  the  problems  that  appeared  were  easily 
solved12 (Table 2).

Such differences do not mean that the therapy is not appli-
cable,  but  rather  that  it  needs  some  adjustments  in  its 
application.28

On the one hand, different cultures interpret and accept 
certain words differently. There are terms that can be mis-
interpreted, such as ‘alive’, ‘more alive’, ‘still’ and ‘future’ 
and  others,  such  as  ‘proud  of’,  are  just  inappropriate  in 
some cultures.14 Some of these words, for example, ‘proud 
of’, can be revised to ‘happy with’,14 to avoid conflict with 
cultural  traits  of  modesty  and  privacy.28  Some  reactions 
suggest that confrontations exist between the participants’ 
norms and values at the cultural, hierarchical and individ-
ual levels.34 On the other hand, the way that a population 
faces  terminal  condition  can  in  itself  be  an  obstacle  for 
adapting the therapy because in the Japanese population, 
being ‘unaware of death’ is considered culturally appropri-
ate. If participating in DT is offered in a way that confronts 
them with death and dying, it is likely to be rejected.35 So, 
creating  a  legacy  is  not  something  patients  hope  for,  as 
they avoid talking about their situation.8

There  are  studies  that  show  DT’s  adaptability  among 
populations other than cancer, including the elderly popu-
lation,20,25  cognitively  impaired  patients;18  patients  with 
ALS26,27,31 and patients with early-state dementia.32 Elderly 
participants  indicated  that  DT  positively  impacts  their 
experience during their final days, and that of their fami-
lies,  and  would  recommend  it  to  other  families.18,20 
However, difficulties with patients’ cognition levels were 
seen; since DT requires memory, many patients relied on 
help from their families.18,20 In this case, DT was adapted 
to use family members as proxy informants. In response, 
researches have proposed amending the protocol in cases 
where the family participates20 and continuing to study the 
feasibility of the therapy in the elderly population.18

On  the  other  hand,  studies  about  DT’s  suitability  for 
ALS patients have been conducted.26,27,31 DT was adminis-
tered  in  this  case  with  family  support.  There,  family 
accompanied  patients  during  sessions  and  participated 
when the patient requested help. The studies conclude that 
DT is suitable and beneficial and, therefore, can be adapted 
to such patients. However, these two studies26,27 referred to 
communication difficulties and the increased time the ses-
sions  required  since  family  presence  made  them  longer. 
The number of sessions required to complete the DT was 
lower in the group assisted by their family26 (Table 2).

Discussion

Adapting to other cultures and populations

DT has been largely explored in the Anglo-Saxon contexts 
of  the  United  States,  Canada,  Australia  and  the  United 
Kingdom. In studies on adapting the therapy to other cul-
tures, some have noted cultural influences that may require 
an adaptation on the way that the therapy is offered.8,28,34 

There are five randomized control trials, and the results are 
not conclusive about the effect of DT on anxiety, depres-
sion, well-being, distress related to patient’s dignity, hope, 
quality  of  life  and  symptoms.  Two  randomized  control  
trials have been conducted with patients with high levels 
of baseline psychological distress.11,29 One showed sta-
tistically  significant  decrease  on  patients’  anxiety  and 

Martínez et al. 

507

depression scores measured at 4, 15 and 30 days, compared 
with baseline scores.29 The other comparing measurements 
pre–post DT showed statistical decrease in anxiety scores 
but not in depression.11 Regarding randomised control tri-
als with patients with low base levels of distress, measures 
of depression, distress or hope improved, albeit not signifi-
cantly. Non-randomized studies reported statistically sig-
nificant  improvements  on  existential  and  psychosocial 
measurements,  such  as  suffering  and  depression;13,25 
except for one study that reported increases in depression 
and  anxiety  scores,  based  on  information  from  four 
patients9 (Table 2).

Studies that did not obtain significant results provide a 
variety  of  possible  explanations.12,15,16,24,28,31  On  the  one 
hand, there is reference to the absence of a specific instru-
ment to measure the effectiveness of DT in the literature.36 
The disease’s progression may also influence the percep-
tion of the therapy’s effectiveness. As patients deteriorate, 
they may start to feel worse, and thus, their perception of 
DT’s effectiveness may not endure.13

On the other hand, sampling patients with low levels of 
distress may be the reason why studies show little impact 
from DT, given there is little room for improvement, that 
is,  floor  effects.  Recent  studies  suggest  the  idea  that 
patients  with  higher  levels  of  distress  may  obtain  more 
benefit from DT11,29 than those with low levels.

The  overall  results  on  effectiveness  are  in  line  with  a 
recently published review about DT based on one database 
search including DT studies conducted with different types 
of patients,37 not just patients with life-threating advanced 
illnesses.  They  considered  the  primary  results  of  DT  on 
patients. However, the current review has included recent 
RCTs and also families and health professionals’ perspec-
tives  and  has  carried  out  a  critical  analysis.  As  several 
authors  mention,  DT’s  effect  might  be  multidimensional 
and other possible effects of therapy should be assessed. 
Thus, a comprehensive view is needed. This idea is con-
sistent with other studies that indicate that patients, fami-
lies and healthcare professionals report that DT heightens 
a  sense  of  dignity,  hope  and  sense  of  purpose  and  helps 
them  to  know  the  person  better13,16,22,30  (Table  2).  They 
also  report  that  it  is  useful  for  their  families  and  offers 
opportunities to share things.23

Relatives  considered  that  DT  helped  their  loved  one 
and increased their perception of dignity and meaning in 
life  and  decreased  suffering.31  Family  members  high-
lighted the opportunity DT offers to communicate and get 
to know new parts of their lives.20

The legacy document is especially relevant for both the 
patient  and  his  family  and  for  professional  caregivers. 
Patients and relatives suggest that DT and the legacy docu-
ment help them to share and make sense of things and also 
suggest that it will be useful when the family is mourning. 
In  turn,  healthcare  professionals  note  that  reading  the 
patient’s  legacy  document  helps  them  better  understand 

the person they are caring for, has a positive effect on how 
they provide care as well as on how they assess the patient 
and  it  increases  their  satisfaction  at  work.18,25  However, 
some also suggest the necessity of taking into account the 
family situation, its relationship and dynamics so that DT 
does  not  negatively  impact  those.26  The  protocol  in  fact 
provides  clear  directions  on  how  family  distress  can  be 
mitigated by taking steps to address any content that could 
provoke it.38

This review includes information about adaptations of 
DT to patients with different pathologies and in different 
cultural  contexts  for  where  it  was  originally  developed. 
Regarding the study’s acceptability and feasibility, DT is 
seen in a positive light, but there are challenges in applying 
the  therapy  to  patients  with  cognitive  impairment,18,34 
fragile  patients34  or  people  with  ALS.27  Studies  have 
adapted the protocol and encouraged relatives’ participa-
tion in these cases. However, in the future, it is important 
to  identify  which  patients  are  most  suitable  for  DT  and  
to  pinpoint  adaptations  needed  for  using  DT  in  other 
populations.

DT adaptation studies show that this therapy is applica-
ble in different cultural contexts and in different locations 
and  types  of  patients,14,18,25,27,31  with  small  protocol 
changes. For example, sometimes there are words, phrases 
or concepts that are inappropriate to the context and should 
be reconsidered.8,14,34 We should not forget that the ques-
tion  framework  is  meant  to  guide  the  direction  that  the 
conversation takes; which is why flexibility is so embed-
ded  within  DT  protocol  and  should  be  considered  when 
adapting it in different contexts.

There are few publications on effective psychological 
interventions during PC treatment and those in circulation 
are  limited  to  very  specific  issues,  while  others  are  too 
complex to apply clinically, which sometimes limits their 
usefulness for patients facing death with advanced disease 
and multiple symptoms. DT is a simple intervention that 
recognizes  an  individual’s  need  to  have  closure  and 
improve communication with loved ones.37 Based on the 
evidence, DT should be offered as a choice to patients with 
life-threatening  diseases  and  explore  more  deeply  DT 
effect on patients and their families.

Future research should aim to define the characteris-
tics that make patients suitable for DT, focusing on iden-
tifying  those  who  would  benefit  most  from  it.  Further 
studies are necessary in patients with high levels of dis-
tress and to assess whether it is possible to demonstrate 
DT’s effectiveness in these patients. These studies should 
present sample size and statistical power calculations and 
explain clearly the randomisation process and who con-
ducts the DT and how.

It  is  also  advisable  to  study  ways  of  measuring  DT’s 
effectiveness since the available instruments do not seem 
to  effectively  capture  the  intervention’s  outcomes,  espe-
cially  given  that  interviews  with  patients  and  families 

508

frequently  reveal  high  levels  of  satisfaction  and  a  sense 
that the therapy is useful and effective.

Limitations

One limitation found in this review is related to the pos-
sibility of publication bias since there is a tendency not  
to publish unfavourable data. In psychological interven-
tions,  not  being  able  to  find  significant  data  or  differ-
ences is common for various reasons, such as a lack of 
specific  instruments  to  measure  an  intervention’s  effec-
tiveness which may affect effect size, the heterogeneity 
of groups or the beneficial nature of the therapist–patient 
relationship itself, which can make it difficult to pinpoint 
what exactly has been effective. On the other hand, data 
extraction was difficult in some articles since the text and 
tables did not display all quantitative information. In this 
sense, in spite of the good data collected, more detailed 
methodological  information  is  required  in  some  of  
the articles identified (e.g. sample size calculations, sta-
tistical power and theoretical framework for analysis in 
qualitative studies) in order to facilitate the interpretation 
of  the  results.  This  should  be  taken  into  account  when 
developing future studies on DT. Furthermore, more in-
depth  analysis  such  as  multivariable  analysis  could  be 
done in order to identify factors that might influence the 
effect  of  DT.  The  lack  of  homogeneity  presenting  the 
data complicates the comparison between studies; more 
homogeneity  could  facilitate  new  studies  comparing 
populations,  for  example,  through  meta-analysis  which 
could contribute to improve the evidence in the field.

It  is  noteworthy  that  majority  of  the  studies  do  not 
provide  detailed  information  about  how  DT  was  con-
ducted  and  therapists’  skills.  Most  articles  include 
directly  Chochinov’s  protocol  reference  with  no  addi-
tional information about how it was conducted, prevent-
ing  an  assessment  of  DT  protocol  application  which 
might influence the results.

Strengths

In this comprehensive systematic review of DT’s imple-
mentation with patients suffering from a life-threatening 
disease, we have reviewed all the results obtained from all 
DT studies meeting our defined quality threshold criteria. 
The  articles  have  been  assessed  according  to  methodo-
logical issues and these have been considered when writ-
ing  the  results.  Methodological  shortcomings  have  been 
identified and reported in this comprehensive review.

The review includes an integrated and comprehensive 
view of the therapy, analysing efficiency, effectiveness, 
acceptability  and  feasibility,  family  members’  percep-
tions,  as  well  as  those  of  healthcare  professionals,  and 
the  therapy’s  adaptability  to  different  populations  and 
cultures.

Conclusion

The  available  evidence  suggests  that  DT  is  beneficial. 
Patients and families evaluate it positively, suggesting that 
it has a variety of effects and can go beyond traditionally 
considered  variables  (e.g.  anxiety  or  depression).  The 
results suggest that patients with the highest distress levels 
can  benefit  the  most  from  therapy,  but  more  studies  are 
needed to confirm DT’s outcomes. DT can be adapted to 
different populations.
