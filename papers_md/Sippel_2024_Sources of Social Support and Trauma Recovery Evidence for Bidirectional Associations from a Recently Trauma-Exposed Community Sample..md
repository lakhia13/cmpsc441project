Abstract: Although the association between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social support
is well documented, few studies have tested the causal pathways explaining this association at
several points in the acute post-trauma recovery period or examined whether the association varies
for different sources of social support. To address these gaps, 151 community individuals (mean
age = 37.20 years, 69.5% women) exposed to trauma within the previous 6 months were recruited
to complete measures of PTSD and social support from intimate partners, friends, and relatives
four times in 1 year. In line with recent recommendations for research on social support and PTSD
symptoms, random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling (RI-CLPM) was used to examine dynamic
changes between PTSD severity and social support over time. The pattern of RI-CLPM cross-lagged
coefficients indicated that positive deviations from one’s expected stable level of total social support
(across all sources) sped up the recovery of PTSD symptoms at the end of the post-trauma year, and
more severe PTSD symptoms than expected based on one’s expected stable level of PTSD started
eroding social support midway through the assessment year. When specific sources of social support
were analyzed separately, the association between within-person increases in social support from
friends at any given time point accelerated the recovery from PTSD across the entire year. Among
participants with intimate partners (n = 53), intimate partner support did not predict PTSD symptoms,
but more severe PTSD symptoms at any given time point predicted less support at the following
time point. Results from this longitudinal study provide additional support for the bidirectional
relationship between PTSD and social support over time and suggest that perceived social support
from friends may be especially helpful during trauma recovery.

1. Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an often-debilitating disorder characterized
by intrusive thoughts and memories, avoidance, hypervigilance, negative mood, and
physiological arousal [1]. Between 75 and 90% of the general population is exposed to
potentially traumatic events [2,3]. Most of these individuals experience some post-traumatic
stress symptoms that naturally abate within the first few weeks post trauma [4,5]. However,
approximately 8% of trauma-exposed individuals do not experience this “natural recovery”
and instead go on to be diagnosed with PTSD [2]. Identifying factors that influence the risk
of PTSD after exposure to trauma is critical for early intervention efforts.

Interpersonal factors are increasingly recognized as critical to the onset, mainte-
nance, and treatment of PTSD [6–8]. Post-traumatic social support, in particular, is a
well-documented risk and resilience factor for PTSD outcomes [9–11]. Several theories
have been put forth to elucidate the causal links between PTSD and social support [8].
According to social causation theory [12] and the stress buffering model [13], social support
contributes to the risk of PTSD after trauma, in that stronger social support can buffer
against PTSD and poorer social support increases the risk of PTSD. The social erosion
theory posits that PTSD symptoms degrade social support over time via their negative
impact on relationships [12]. Evidence from prospective and meta-analytic studies supports
both causal directions, indicating a bidirectional relationship [14–16].

This converging evidence of the bidirectional relationship between PTSD and social
support is limited by the heterogeneity in assessment methods between studies [15,16].
Sources of heterogeneity include variation in the timeline of assessment protocols (e.g.,
how soon after trauma social support and PTSD symptoms are measured, the length of
assessment windows) and the types and sources of social support studied. Social support
is a complex and multifaceted construct that can be disentangled into different domains
and functions [8,16]. Perceived emotional social support, defined here as the perception of
one’s emotional needs being supported by close others [17], is most consistently associated
with PTSD-related outcomes across studies [8,18,19], whereas meta-analytic findings show
that negative social reactions have the strongest association with PTSD symptoms [16,20].
The value of social support for promoting trauma recovery may vary according to who
is providing the support and when the support is provided [11]; similarly, PTSD symptoms
may have a greater impact on support provided by some sources than others. In their meta-
analyses, Zalta and colleagues (2021) found that the magnitude of the PTSD–social support
association did not vary by support source after adjusting for covariates, whereas Wang
and colleagues (2021) found that PTSD predicted greater reductions in support from close
others (i.e., family members, friends) than from distant others like units or organizations.
This inconsistency in findings for specific sources of social support may be due to different
coding conventions for types of relationships and the fact that Wang’s meta-analysis was
limited to longitudinal studies, whereas Zalta’s was not.

Most primary studies that have attempted to disentangle the effects of social support
from specific sources have been cross-sectional studies conducted among military veterans,
with inconsistent results. For example, among combat veterans, social support from
intimate partners, family, and military peers (but not friends) negatively correlated with
PTSD [21]. A study of veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan indicated that support
from all sources (immediate family, other family, friends, coworkers, and community) was
associated with lower odds of a positive PTSD screen [22]. Higher perceived support from
family and friends was related to less severe PTSD but support from the general public was
not [23]. Finally, in a study of male veterans being treated for chronic PTSD, more severe
PTSD predicted erosion in support from nonveteran friends but not from relatives [24].

The timing of assessments of PTSD and social support, in terms of how soon after
trauma they are administered and how frequently, vary across studies and the specific
empirical questions being examined. Some have measured PTSD and social support over
intervals of several months within the first 2 years post trauma [12,25,26]. Other studies
have included relatively fewer time points in the more acute post-trauma period (e.g., days

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 284

3 of 13

or weeks; [27]) or several years after trauma exposure [28,29]. Studies that incorporate
frequent assessment of PTSD symptoms and social support across a relatively limited
time frame soon after trauma may be best positioned to capture meaningful and dynamic
changes in associations between perceived social support and PTSD severity during the
acute post-trauma recovery period while minimizing the risk of capturing more chronic
forms of psychopathology that may distort these associations.

To our knowledge, no longitudinal studies have examined the association between
social support from multiple distinct sources of social support and PTSD symptoms in
a community sample of adults soon after exposure to trauma. Such work has important
implications for identifying interpersonal intervention targets in the acute trauma recovery
period that are generalizable to different populations of trauma survivors.

The Current Study

The objective of the current study was to examine the dynamic associations between
PTSD and social support over time in a sample of individuals recruited from the community
within 6 months of trauma exposure. Participants were assessed four times over a 12-month
period to allow adequate time for the many trajectories of post-trauma recovery observed
in the literature (e.g., natural recovery that is most likely within three months, delayed
expression, etc.; [4,5]) to be represented and investigated in relation to social support. As
presented in Monson et al., 2023 [30], a total of 44% of participants met the diagnostic
criteria for PTSD at the first assessment; the rates of PTSD declined over time (23% at Time
2, 18% at Time 3, and 11% at Time 4). In the current study, we addressed previous criticisms
of the designs of longitudinal studies of social support and PTSD symptoms [31] by using
random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling (RI-CLPM) to test pathways between PTSD
symptoms and total social support (i.e., across all types of relationships), followed by an
examination of support from three types of close others (per Wang et al., 2021), intimate
partners, relatives, and friends, using four time-points. In RI-CLPM, significant cross-
lagged effects indicate the extent to which deviations from the trait level in one variable
at a given time point can explain change in the other variable at the following time point.
Throughout the remainder of the manuscript, we refer to such deviations from the trait level
as “deviations from the expected stable level” to disambiguate PTSD and social support
from being interpreted as “traits”.

In RI-CLPM terminology, we hypothesized that one’s stable mean level of social sup-
port would be associated with one’s stable mean level of PTSD symptoms, with PTSD
and social support being negatively associated. Moreover, we hypothesized reciprocal
within-person dynamics over time, again with PTSD and social support being negatively
associated. In other words, both on average and over time, we expected a negative asso-
ciation between PTSD and social support (i.e., greater social support associated with less
severe PTSD symptoms or, vice versa, poorer social support associated with more severe
PTSD symptoms). Based on our literature review, we hypothesized that these bidirectional
associations would hold for all sources of social support but would be particularly strong
for social support from intimate partners and friends compared to relatives. Lastly, we
explored how these dynamics varied across the 12-month study period.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

The current study was derived from a larger longitudinal study examining risk and
resilience factors for PTSD among a sample of 151 recently traumatized adults [30]. To
be eligible for participation, participants had to be: (a) between 18 and 75 years old;
(b) exposed to a DSM-IV-TR Criterion A trauma within six months prior to study enrolment;
and (c) fluent in English. Sample demographics are presented in Table 1 and described
in detail in [30]. Briefly, the majority of participants self-identified as women (69.5%),
single (51.7%), unemployed (54.3%), and had an annual income less than CAD 35,000 per
year (71.6%). The mean age of the sample was 37.20 years (SD = 14.05; men M = 39.91,

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 284

4 of 13

women M = 36.07). The most commonly identified race/ethnicity was white (47.7%). The
majority of participants reported directly experiencing the traumatic event, and the most
commonly experienced traumatic events were accidents (30.5%), sexual assaults (21.9%),
and physical assaults (21.2%). The average time elapsed between trauma exposure and the
initial assessment was 127.9 days (SD = 56.6; i.e., approximately four months).

2.2. Procedure

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Ryerson University (now
Toronto Metropolitan University). Participants were recruited from the Toronto, Canada
area using clinician referrals, newspapers, online advertisements, and flyers posted at uni-
versity campuses, community centers, religious centers, and hospitals with trauma centers.
Following informed consent, eligible participants completed four identical assessments
that consisted of a clinician-administered interview and self-report questionnaires. A full
description of the study procedures is provided in the primary outcomes paper [30].

2.3. Measures

PTSD: As this study commenced prior to the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [32], the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, Fifth
Edition [33] was not yet available. Thus, the current study used the Clinician-Administered
PTSD Scale (CAPS; [34]), a semi-structured clinical interview that assesses for DSM-IV-TR
PTSD diagnostic criteria and symptom severity. In an effort to account for anticipated
changes to the DSM, items that correspond to anticipated DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for
PTSD were also included in the version of the CAPS used in this study. PTSD symptom

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 284

5 of 13

presence and severity were assessed over the past month. The frequency and intensity
of the 20 symptoms comprising the PTSD diagnosis in the DSM-5 were each rated on a
5-point scale, consistent with the original CAPS [34]. Higher scores are indicative of greater
symptom severity.

For the current data set, the internal reliability of the CAPS was excellent at each
assessment point (Cronbach’s α’s = 0.94 to 0.97). To test interrater reliability, a random
sample (8.5%) of all interviews conducted was selected for independent expert assessment
monitoring. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for these ratings was excellent
(ICC = 0.99).

Social support: The Provisions of Social Relations Scale (PSRS; 17) is a 22-item measure
for assessing individuals’ perceptions of the availability of social support from different
potential support providers, including intimate partners, friends, and relatives. The PSRS is
composed of three subscales: Intimate Partner Support (PSRS Partner; six items), Relatives
Support (PSRS Relatives; eight items), and Friend Support (PSRS Friends; eight items).
Each subscale assesses the degree to which the respondent feels close to the target support
provider, perceives the support provider as willing to take the time to talk and have
communication of worth, has confidence that the support source will be there when
needed, and has the belief that the support source has confidence in the respondent.
Respondents rate their agreement using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very much
like my experience) to 4 (not at all like my experience). In the current study, the scale was
reverse-scored for data analytic purposes so that higher scores reflected higher levels of
perceived social support.

All participants were administered the Perceived Family Support and Perceived Friend
Support scales. Respondents who did not have an intimate partner did not complete the
Perceived Partner Support scale. A total score was calculated using the mean of the
appropriate scales [17]. Internal consistency was high for each subscale across time points
(Cronbach’s α’s = 0.90–0.97).

2.4. Analytic Plan

We tested a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM; [35]), a type of
structural equation model (SEM), to examine the stability and reciprocal relationships of
PTSD and social support over time. A benefit of the RI-CLPM over the traditional cross-
lagged panel model (CLPM) is its ability to separate within-person variations from stable,
between-person (i.e., trait-like) variations by including separate time-invariant random
intercept factors that account for between-person mean-level differences in the outcome of
interest. Therefore, in contrast to the traditional CLPM, the RI-CLPM estimates both stable
differences between people as well as within-person variations within (autoregressive) and
between (cross-lagged) measures over time [35]. In the context of the RI-CLPM model,
autoregressive change refers to a temporary deviation from the stable trait level in Construct
X at time t predicting a change in Construct X at time t + 1, and cross-lagged change refers
to a temporary deviation from the stable trait level in Construct X at time t predicting a
change in Construct Y at time t + 1.

In the current study, autoregressive and cross-lagged paths between PTSD symptoms
and social support were examined across the four assessment intervals. Positive autore-
gressive effects denote that a stronger positive deviation from one’s stable level of PTSD
symptoms or social support is associated with a subsequent increase in the respective
measure. Cross-lagged paths were explored to examine bi-directional relationships be-
tween PTSD symptoms and social support over time, with significant cross-lagged effects
indicating the extent to which deviations from the trait level in one variable at a given time
point can explain change in the other variable at the following time point. As previously
noted, we refer to such deviations from the trait level as “deviations from the expected
stable level” to disambiguate PTSD and social support from being interpreted as “traits”.
Analyses were conducted with full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation
to account for missing data. FIML uses all available observed data to estimate coefficients

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 284

6 of 13

and is robust to biased estimates that can occur when data are not missing completely at
random [36].

Descriptive analyses were conducted in SPSS version 25.0 (IBM, 2018). RI-CLPM
analyses were conducted using the Mplus statistical package (Version 7; [37]). A total of
four RI-CLPMs were conducted between PTSD and each of the social support subscales
(total, friends, family, intimate partners). To examine if autoregressive and cross-lagged
associations varied across time, we tested the longitudinal invariance of the autoregressive
and cross-lagged paths in three models: (1) all autoregressive and cross-lagged paths fixed
across time, (2) autoregressive paths freely estimated and cross-lagged paths fixed across
time, and (3) all parameters freely estimated. To determine the model with the best fit, each
model was compared against the most saturated model (i.e., the freely estimated model)
on the Chi-square goodness of fit test (χ2), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; [38]), the Root
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA; [39]) and the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC; [40]) to determine the best fitting model. CFI values greater than 0.95 indicate
good model fit [41]. RMSEA values of 0.01 and 0.05 represent excellent and good fit,
respectively [42]. Smaller AIC values indicate a better fitting model when comparing
competing models [40,41]. The fit was considered to be significantly better if the Chi-square
difference was significant, the change in CFI was <0.01, and the change in RMSEA was
<0.015 [43].

3. Results

Means and standard deviations for PTSD symptoms and social support subscales at
each assessment point can be found in Table 2. Bivariate correlations for PTSD symptoms
and social support subscales at each assessment point are found in Supplemental Table S2.
PTSD symptoms and overall social support were negatively correlated at all time points
(r ranging from −0.16 to −0.42).

Table 3 shows model fit estimates and results of Chi-square difference tests for each
model. For the association between PTSD severity and total social support, the model in
which all paths were freely estimated demonstrated the best fit, indicating that autoregres-
sive and cross-lagged associations varied over time. For the three other models, freely
estimated autoregressive paths and constrained cross-lagged paths demonstrated the best
fit, suggesting that the autoregressive associations of each construct varied over time, but
the cross-lagged associations between them were stable.

Bidirectional Longitudinal Associations between PTSD Symptoms and Social Support

PTSD symptoms and total social support: As shown in Table 3, the fit for the bidirec-
tional model between total PTSD severity and total social support was good. As displayed
in Table 4 and Figure 1, there was a significant and negative correlation between the random
intercepts of PTSD symptoms and total social support, indicating that in terms of stable
between-participant differences, higher total social support was associated with less severe
stable PTSD symptoms. There were significant and positive autoregressive effects for PTSD
symptoms at all three time points, as well as for total social support at time points 1 and
2. There were also significant and negative cross-lagged effects of total social support on
PTSD symptoms from time 3 to time 4, and of PTSD on total social support from time 2 to
time 3. This pattern of cross-lagged coefficients suggests that having more severe PTSD
symptoms than expected based on one’s stable level of PTSD erodes social support midway
through the assessment year and that having more social support than expected based on
one’s stable level of social support promotes the recovery of PTSD symptoms at the end of
the post-trauma year.

social support at time points 1 and 2. There were significant and negative cross-lagged
effects of social support from friends on changes in PTSD severity, as well as of total
PTSD severity on change in social support from friends over all three assessment intervals.
This pattern of cross-lagged coefficients suggests that more social support from friends
than expected based on one’s stable level speeds up the recovery from PTSD and that
more severe PTSD symptoms than expected based on one’s stable level of PTSD predicts
decreasing social support from friends over the entire year post traumatization.

PTSD symptoms and intimate partner social support: The fit for these bidirectional
models was also good (see Table 3). As shown in Table 4, there was not a significant corre-
lation between the random intercepts of PTSD and social support from intimate partners;
one’s stable level of intimate partner social support was not associated with one’s stable
level of PTSD symptoms. There were no significant autoregressive effects for PTSD symp-
toms across the assessment year. There was a significant and positive autoregressive effect
of intimate partner social support at time 2. There were no significant cross-lagged effects
of intimate partner support on PTSD symptoms, but there were significant and negative
cross-lagged effects of PTSD symptoms on intimate partner social support, indicating that
intimate partner social support does not impact PTSD but that higher-than-expected (based
on one’s stable level) PTSD symptoms at any given time point do predict decreased social
support from intimate partners at the following time point.

4. Discussion

The association between PTSD and social support is well established, but there remains
a lack of clarity about the nature of this association at different points in the post-trauma
period and whether it varies according to the source of social support. Given the lack of
longitudinal data in this area, we examined both PTSD symptoms and perceived social
support from multiple distinct support sources in a community sample of adults after
exposure to trauma over time. In line with previous studies [15,16], social support and
PTSD symptoms were negatively associated (i.e., higher stable levels of total social support
were associated with less severe PTSD symptoms and lower levels of support were associ-
ated with more severe PTSD symptoms). However, beyond previous studies, we found
evidence for complex within-participant dynamics, pointing to a bidirectional relationship
between PTSD severity and total social support. Namely, more severe PTSD symptoms
than expected based on one’s stable level eroded subsequent total social support midway
through the assessment year, while having more total social support from all sources than
expected based on one’s stable level sped up the reduction in PTSD symptoms at the end
of the post-trauma year.

In terms of specific sources of support, the pattern of findings was similar for sup-
port from friends, except that the bidirectional relationship between PTSD severity and
support from friends was stable throughout the entire post-trauma year. Intimate partner
support did not predict PTSD severity, but more severe PTSD symptoms than expected
based on one’s stable level of PTSD predicted less support from intimate partners. Most
extant studies of PTSD and social support from specific sources have been cross-sectional
studies with military veterans [21–23]. In these studies, the effect sizes for the PTSD–social
support association were larger than the effect sizes observed among civilians [15,16]. Our
longitudinal research replicates and extends the previous findings in veterans, suggesting
that promoting social support in the post-trauma period is critical to trauma recovery
across populations.

Our findings largely align with those of two recent meta-analyses of PTSD and social
support [15,16] that documented a bidirectional relationship between PTSD and social
support. With respect to total social support, our finding that total social support predicted
PTSD is in line with social causation and stress buffering at the end of the assessment
year. The finding that PTSD predicted social support is in line with social erosion mid-way
through the year. We found that this association differed across sources of support, with
support from friends especially salient in both causal directions, and PTSD predicting

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 284

reductions in support from intimate partners. These findings are consistent with Wang and
colleagues’ conclusion and interpersonal conceptualizations of PTSD that posit that PTSD
degrades support from close others such as friends and intimate partners [6], perhaps via
PTSD’s negative effects on emotional closeness, reactivity, and disclosure, all of which
are highly salient to the quality of close relationships. This important buffering effect of
support from friends on psychiatric outcomes has also been observed in other populations,
such as university students, for whom social support from friends reduced depressive
symptoms [44]. Taken together, these findings suggest that friends may be an under-
appreciated but promising source of social support in the post-trauma period because of
the inherent value of them being intentionally selected and maintained as close others.
Unfortunately, this may not be assumed for relatives and even intimate partners, with
whom relationships may be sustained even if quality is compromised. Successful, high-
quality friendships may be especially valuable for reducing stress and enhancing positive
affect and quality of life.

These findings support the early intervention technique of building and leveraging
social support in the early post-trauma recovery period, as well as mitigating the negative ef-
fects of PTSD on social support and close relationship quality once PTSD is present. Dyadic
and systemic approaches to PTSD intervention have promising evidence for improving
both PTSD symptoms and relationship quality (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy
for PTSD; [45,46]). Educating loved ones about PTSD symptoms and treatment [47] may
serve as a lighter-touch approach for enhancing loved ones’ skills in providing emotional
support to patients while they engage in PTSD treatment. As suggested by our findings,
friends may serve as especially potent sources of support and could benefit from guidance
regarding how and when to provide social support that is best matched to the trauma-
exposed individuals’ needs. For example, friends of trauma-exposed individuals could be
encouraged to promote trauma recovery by providing positive support (e.g., emotional
validation, promoting thoughts and feelings of safety) and avoiding negative reactions such
as treating the survivor differently, rejection, and blaming—reactions that have particularly
detrimental effects on trauma recovery [16,20,48]. Engaging with supportive others could
also promote cognitive changes, in that they could gently challenge overly negative beliefs
and offer alternative interpretations, which in turn can facilitate trauma recovery [49]. From
a public health perspective, as friendship networks tend to degrade in later age [50], it may
be especially important to instill and encourage recognition of the value of friendships
early in life as a strategy for enhancing resilience to stress and promoting overall health
and wellness [51].

This study has several limitations. Although our study addressed previous criticisms
of longitudinal studies of social support and PTSD symptoms by including four waves
and using RI-CLPM [31,35], our statistical models were complex and statistical power was
not adequate to go beyond our key questions to test moderators of this association (e.g.,
trauma type, gender), add covariates to the model (e.g., time since trauma, other forms
of psychopathology that may contribute to perception of social support like depression),
or directly compare sources of social support. Gender differences in the PTSD–social
support association may be particularly interesting to examine given that women are at
double the risk of PTSD than men [3], that patterns of trauma exposure and post-trauma
psychopathology differ for men and women (e.g., with depression more common among
women and substance use disorders more common among men [52]), and that women
have been found to exhibit affiliative responses to stress [53], suggesting that women may
be especially likely to benefit from social support after trauma. Future research could
also examine the interplay between sex and gender differences and different types of
trauma in relation to social support, as well as sex and gender differences in the likelihood
of providing support to trauma-exposed family and friends. We were also not able to
account for co-occurring mental health symptoms that could affect perceptions of social
support, such as depression. The analysis of social support from intimate partners, in which
we found that PTSD predicted reductions in support from intimate partners, should be

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 284

interpreted with caution, as it was limited by only about one third of the sample completing
that subscale. Future research that is specifically designed and powered to examine social
support from intimate partners can inform whether this form of support is differentially
protective or negatively impacted by PTSD relative to support from other sources, as well
as how it can be optimally improved via early intervention.

5. Conclusions

Overall, results from this longitudinal study provide additional support for the bidirec-
tional relationship between PTSD and social support over time in a recently trauma-exposed
community sample and suggest that perceived social support from friends may be espe-
cially helpful during trauma recovery. Future studies could examine the quality of social
support relationships in terms of disentangling positive and negative reactions to trauma
and emotional disclosures, as well as more closely controlling for the time since the trauma
to delineate the directionality of the association between PTSD symptoms and social sup-
port in pre-specified post-trauma recovery periods. This will ultimately improve the health
and recovery trajectory of the many people who are affected by trauma and those who
surround them.
