The infant’s psycho-physiological regulatory system begins to develop
prenatally and continues to mature during the postnatal period. Tempera-
ment is a construct comprising tonic individual differences in dispositional
physiological and behavioural reactions as well as an evolving ability to
regulate to environmental conditions. Theoretical models and research
have shown that neurohormonal and -physiological factors contribute to
individual development and impact infant behaviours as well as the devel-
oping regulatory system. Moreover, prenatal maternal risks such as stress
and depression are thought to programme fetal regulatory tendencies and
that influences neural and behavioural functioning in infancy. The purpose
of this review is to examine the theories and research that link infant tem-
perament to neurohormonal and -physiological development in typically
developing infants and in those exposed to environmental risk. Research
has demonstrated associations between individual variation in physiological
stress responses and regulation (measured with cortisol). Moreover, studies
have noted an association with physiological regulation and socio-emotional
interaction (as measured by the touch–oxytocin link) that may buffer
emotional dysregulation. The interaction between individual differences in
temperamental
tendencies, neurohormonal and -physiological patterns
will be discussed by presenting data from studies that have shown that
infant neurohormonal and -physiological functioning sets an important tra-
jectory for the development of the individual.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Diverse perspectives on diversity:

multi-disciplinary approaches to taxonomies of individual differences’.

1. Introduction
Individual differences in temperament and characteristic styles of interaction
with the environment set the trajectory for development [1,2]. While earlier
theories of development cycled between those emphasizing either the infant’s
influence on the carer’s behaviour, the infant’s genetics and physiology predict-
ing infant behaviour, or how environmental stress or suboptimal parent
behaviour influences infant reactivity, for example, current theoretical views
and recent research paradigms have changed to a more dynamical view of indi-
vidual differences in development that prioritizes nonlinear adaptation of
infant behaviour, physiology and epigenetic factors to environment and vice
versa [3–5]. Moreover, ‘environments’ have been expanded to include the
fetal environment, which has been shown to confer advantages, protective func-
tions,
later development. Seminal
postulates expounded by Greenough’s model of neural plasticity [6], which
recognized both experience-expectant and experience-dependent plasticity,
are the antecedents to current theories. Contemporary research methods (e.g.
latent profile analysis within mixture models,
latent growth models and
growth mixture models for longitudinal data [7]), on the other hand, have expe-
dited progress in unravelling the dynamic interaction between the individual
and their environment beginning at the fetal period. Meaningful, stable infant
traits do exist and persist even as the infant’s ability to self-regulate evolves

interaction of

across development. Yet, contributions to and interactions
with these individual
fetal and infant characteristics by
parent genetics, physiology and hormones, combined with
behavioural responses (and environmental risk) vary exten-
sively. Further,
individual and parental
qualities can confer socio-emotional protection or risk related
to mental health for the developing infant. Multilevel and
multidisciplinary perspectives must be employed to capture
the specific mechanisms by which these interactions lead to
the emergence of the individual and their unique set of
characteristics and skills. Recognition of the complexity of
outcomes, the meaningfulness of individual differences and
parental protections, along with the necessity to intervene
during early development is evident.

The purpose of this review is to highlight theory and
research, including our own, implemented with the concep-
tualization that
fetal and infant neurophysiological and
neurohormonal development undergirds individual differ-
ences in development. Through integrating theory and
research, it is our goal to point out significant accomplish-
ments in understanding development as well as gaps and
directions for progress.

2. Theoretical model of individual variation

(temperament) in fetal and infant
development

Advances in measurement of genetic and neurophysiological
mechanisms and in models of analysis have had a prismatic
effect, bringing to light a plethora of interconnected, yet dis-
tinct perspectives of development, which has led to marked
generation of research in this context. Multidisciplinary
views are common, though they may be difficult to test
empirically because multiple methods are often taxing for
the research subjects (especially for primiparous families
and their infants) and the correspondence between various
behavioural and physiological measures may not be direct.
Nonetheless, the theoretical, methodological and analytical
advances in these models have exposed the complexity
inherent in individual development and the many protec-
tions and risks that
the individual and the
society confer to the individual child.

the family,

Table 1 has been created to simplify and integrate the focus
of each theoretical model, important theoretical positions and
examples of the research conducted in each area are shown in
table 1. Notably each model has added important and scienti-
fically valid insights that must be considered to form a
complete understanding of the relationship between tempera-
ment and neurophysiological and neurohormonal substrates
during fetal and infant development. Furthermore, while
these models are presented in table 1 as distinct theories,
close inspection of the literature reveals that the models are
not diametrically opposed to each other, rather there is a
large amount of overlap between theories and these models
merely highlight distinct processes and/or explain different
mechanisms of influence across development [16].

As a construct and a process, temperament refers to a
person’s unique set of innate reactivity and regulatory predis-
positions [20] as well as those characteristics that evolve in
response to varied environmental input and complex social
experiences. Although temperament has been defined in

several different ways, ultimately there is consensus that tem-
perament has its origins in individual differences underlying
biology and behaviour [21]. Temperament
is intricately
linked to emotion, motor activity and approach/withdrawal
tendencies,
interacts with cognitive processes [22,23] and
underlies unfolding regulatory abilities and socio-emotional
adjustment to the world [24]. Temperament is evident early
in life, measurable even during gestation [25], and generally
remains consistent for the individual, becoming more com-
plex across infancy and childhood with normative patterns
of expansion and change at pivotal junctures [26,27].

From early stages of fetal and postnatal infant develop-
ment, individuals differ immensely in reactivity, which is
defined as both their physiological and behavioural arousal
at a tonic state along with the individual’s responses to the
environment. Reactivity can be maximal for one child and
minimal for another child [7] (i.e. a child with behavioural
inhibition [28] or exuberance [29]). These characteristic pat-
terns of reaction fluctuate in terms of response latency,
duration, frequency and intensity. Notably, the environmental
stimuli themselves can also vary substantially in terms of fre-
quency, duration and intensity of stimuli with a valence that
can be perceived as positive or negative in tone. While the defi-
nition of temperament may sometimes be constrained to a focus
on dispositional arousal responses and/or emotions which are
rooted in differences in sensitivity to sensation, along with
modifying involuntary processes (such as multisensory inte-
gration and orientation), more recent conceptualizations of
temperament have also included variables such as volunta-
rily being able to manage attention, activity and cognition
[20,23,26]. Reactivity has been measured with corresponding
somatic, endocrine, central and autonomic nervous system
activity as well as epigenetic processes.

Regulation, the second key component of temperament, is
often defined as the adaptive process of modulating the
intensity and duration of physiological arousal, attention
and emotional states [21] as well as behavioural, cognitive,
interpersonal or social processes [30]. Newborn infants can
regulate themselves through what are believed to be reflexive
behaviours, such as gaze aversion, rudimentary motor skills
such as head turning, crying and sucking [31], yet may also
use crying as a means of signalling the carer to aid in regu-
lation [32]. In many infants, primitive self-regulation over
arousal state and emotional reactivity begins to emerge by
three months of age [33], with more control and stability
developing over time as infants are better able to regulate
arousal [34], control attention and motor function so as to
visually orient to or disengage from stimuli [35] and/or to
engage in joint attention [36]. Infants vary immensely in regu-
latory ability, and self-skill at regulation evolves through
interaction with environment and carers [37].

Research advances in infant self-regulation have demon-
strated that the infant’s social environment and the quality
of the interactions with carers contribute significantly to its
developing regulatory abilities. Carer sensitivity, in particu-
lar, has been shown to be a powerful predictor of infant
regulation development over the first year of life [38]. Ulti-
the
mately, regulation continues to develop throughout
early school years as the frontal cortex continues to mature,
supporting corresponding improvements in attention and
executive control [35].

Self-regulation has been pinpointed as ‘the single most

development and the potential for the individual to experi-
ence psychopathology’ [39]. In empirical research, Feldman
[18] showed (across a 10 year study) that emotion regulation
in the neonatal period sets the trajectory for later regulatory
ability, resiliency and parent –child interaction dynamics.
Feldman boldly concludes that lifelong regulatory disorder
may be fixed at the neonatal period.

Taken together, future research on the neurohormonal
and neurophysiological factors associated with temperament
that co-mingle and establish a cascade of consequences for
the developing organism is paramount. Owing to the scope
and complexity of individual differences in development,
even during the fetal and newborn period, a multilevel
approach with person-centred designs is required to under-
stand unique individual behaviour, cognition and emotion
and the developmental course of these processes. In particu-
lar, more research is required to understand the progression
from physiological and behavioural regulation in newborn
periods to its impact on normative and mental health out-
comes in childhood and beyond. There is also a need to
understand more about the mechanisms underlying tempera-
ment and their functions associated with physiological and
biological processes, and how the infant/child shapes its
own environment given its particular physiological and
social affordances. Scientific studies furthermore have little
information as to the potential for reorganization of inherent
temperamental qualities that are atypical. Can reorganization
of temperament occur at specific periods of development,
what factors precede any potential changes, and can the indi-
vidual benefit from reorganization? Finally, because we know
that early impacts are more pronounced, as well as adaptable
in setting the trajectory for
[18,40],
research should be conducted to fully grasp how and when
to best intervene in order to attenuate the potential for
psychopathology and promote optimal function [41].

3. Infant neurohormones associated with
temperament: cortisol and oxytocin

What do contemporary scientists know about prenatal and
infant physiological and biological underpinning associated
with individual development? The prenatal period is a cru-
cial time for fetal neurodevelopment wherein an array of
hormonal exposures can lead to potentially long-term
health and mental health effects as well as changes in brain
physiology [42]. In fact, Stuebe et al. [43] delineate more
than 15 different hormones that could potentially be involved
with fetal and infant developmental patterns, including hor-
mones that have to do with birthing, breastfeeding, maternal
psychological conditions and other neuroendocrine and neu-
rophysiological processes occurring during gestation and
infant development. A significant number of neuroendocrine
processes can potentially influence and interact in the devel-
oping fetus and infant during the transition from the fetal
environment to postnatal life [43,44]. Paradoxically, much
of this work is on the dysregulation of neurohormonal factors
and less is known about typical neurohormonal develop-
ment. For example, we [44] showed that neuro-regulatory
behaviours in infants whose mothers were depressed were
associated with higher levels of norepinephrin and cortisol
and lower levels of dopamine, and that cortisol dysregulation
in depressed mothers impacted infant cortisol and gestational

weight [45] as well as fetal activity levels [46]. Subsequent
studies have also supported these findings and have shown
that infants of depressed mothers exhibit lower levels of ser-
otonin and dopamine as well as elevated levels of epinephrin
and cortisol [47]. However, the focus of this review is on the
neurohormonal factors that have been studied more exten-
sively in relation to the individual differences during fetal
and infant development: specifically cortisol and oxytocin.

(a) Cortisol
The hypothalamic –pituitary –adrenocortical (HPA) axis is
considered the central regulatory system for dealing with
both physical and psychological distress [48]. Following
stress, the body responds autonomically by releasing cat-
echolamines and by activating the HPA axis, which initiates
a cascade of stress responses [49]. The key hormonal product
of stress is the glucocorticoid (GC) cortisol [50]. The physio-
logical systems associated with stress develop prenatally,
are manifested in infancy and have a synergistic relationship
with maternal neuroendocrine function. During gestation, the
fetus will encounter direct and indirect threats to homeostasis
in its environment, although their impact on fetal develop-
ment will be dependent on the severity and duration of the
stress, the gestational age when it occurs and the exact type
of stressor [51]. It is of course challenging to tease apart the
contributions of the mother from those of the infant in
the development of physiological reactivity and regulation.
Notably, during fetal development the placenta helps buffer
the fetus from chronic stress, with approximately 20% of
maternal cortisol crossing the placental barrier and thus
accounting for some relationship between mother and fetal
stress [52]. Even after birth infant cortisol profiles are tied
or
[53] with maternal cortisol
(and paternal support) from one month postnatally and
potentially across the first several years of life. The impact
in typical fetal and infant
of the stress hormone cortisol
development is important to understand.

‘biologically embedded’

infants’

studies have demonstrated that

Across fetal and infant development, the neuroendocrine
systems continue to strengthen [49] and are impacted by
their interactions with the postnatal environment. The pattern
of cortisol reactivity and regulation in infancy has also been
shown to differ significantly from that of a child or an adult
[54]. Infants do not seem to have the same circadian patterns
of cortisol release throughout the first few months [55]. Collec-
cortisol
tively,
reactivity, their circadian rhythms and their feeding and sleep-
ing patterns differentially impact their cortisol levels, although
generally reactive cortisol responses are moderate during stres-
sor exposures. An increase in cortisol, followed by a fairly quick
response cessation, is an adaptive event, as cortisol mobilizes
energy in order to provide the periphery with the fuel necess-
ary to increase perceptual awareness and attention to deal with
acute stress [56]. Furthermore, in very young infants, a hypo-
reactive period following stress may protect the infant’s brain
while it is adjusting to postnatal life [50]. Thus, moderate
stress can actually be seen as adaptive as it offers some post-
natal neurodevelopmental benefits for the offspring; extreme
and/or chronic stress has been found to have harmful effects
on the fetus and infant (i.e. maltreatment, malnutrition and
constant maternal distress/anxiety/depression) [57].

It should be noted that hypocortisolism (i.e., a low level of
infants, yet

cortisol responsivity) can exist in individual

that

without the ability for the system to respond with the termin-
ation and return to baseline of the stress response, reactivity
of the infant HPA axis can become dysregulated. With contin-
ual stress or individual deficits in the ability to regulate stress,
the cortisol imbalance/excess may result in physiological dis-
tress, referred to as allostatic load (AL) [58]. Across long
periods of time, increases in AL produce decreases in activity
and energy levels, and inability to attend, and can produce
other long-term cognitive and affective perturbations, includ-
ing internalizing symptoms
lead to anxiety and
depressive disorders [59,60]. For instance, infants that experi-
ence maltreatment or that are reared in institutional settings
that offer little care beyond physical care can have dysregu-
lated patterns, including lower morning levels of cortisol or
a flatter slope of diurnal cortisol pattern [61]. In addition,
research has demonstrated that maternal depression during
gestation may influence fetal cortico-limbic neurodevelop-
ment
childhood
psychopathology [18], predict immune dysfunction in off-
spring during adulthood [63] and negatively impact fetal
growth rates, while increasing the risk of preterm delivery
[64]. Thus, quality and duration of stress as well as the flexi-
bility and coordination of the stress system for the individual
can have either constructive or disruptive effects on the devel-
oping infant’s physiological system. Indeed theorists have
even suggested that the concordance between fetal cortisol
environment and postnatal cortisol environment could be
key to explicating cortisol dysregulation because studies on
younger infants have not found associations between high
cortisol within extremely stressful environments [49].

of

In our own work, we have found that stable infant breast-
feeding patterns, maternal affectionate contact and care
(through skin-to-skin training during the first month postpar-
tum) can impact cortisol reactivity patterns. Specifically,
mothers who were trained in Kangaroo Care felt more
bonded with their infant, were more likely to report self-effi-
cacy in breastfeeding and had lower cortisol reactivity than
mothers who did not practice the KC procedures [54,55]. Simi-
lar to other empirical reports [65], infant cortisol (as well as
contrasting patterns of oxytocin) is affected by maternal
stress and breastfeeding patterns, and this results in changes
in stress reactivity across development. We [66] have further
found that infant cortisol patterns after stress are complex
and depend upon the interaction of both underlying infant
neurophysiology and level of maternal distress. We are conti-
nuing to examine these patterns of maternal mood, cortisol
regulation and oxytocin across development in infant neuro-
physiological and behavioural development. In sum, while
cortisol
is essential for healthy stress management, early
exposure to high levels of cortisol and stress, as well as defi-
cits/dysfunctions in parental care, can lead to maladaptive
biological changes to the developing infant stress management
system, setting the infant up for potentially long-term regulat-
ory issues. By contrast, effective, nurturing care in early
infancy provides a supportive scaffolding for the develop-
ment of robust infant stress management capabilities. The
fledgling infant regulatory system is uniquely influenced by
environment and by the quality of care the infant receives.

(b) Oxytocin
Very few studies have directly examined the association
between fetal/infant oxytocin levels and temperamental

variations in behaviours during infancy.
Instead, most
studies, even recent ones, have measured oxytocin in mothers
[67] or parents [68] or they have collected oxytocin samples at
later stages of development [69]. Moreover, there are a hand-
ful of experimental studies using a neuro-ethological model
[70], and some recent studies on the oxytocin gene (OXTR
[71]) that point to the potentially powerful role that central
and peripheral oxytocin could have on infant development.
Two important issues that have been discussed across these
studies are: (i) whether the most meaningful measure of
oxytocin levels is peripheral, central or genetic and (ii)
whether baseline or stimulus-linked measures of oxytocin
are more reliable and valid approaches for studying individual
differences [67].

Of the studies that have been conducted on human
infants, roles for oxytocin in multisensory processing [72],
socio-emotional adaptions [73] and visual attention [74]
have been noted as impacting the child’s ability to experience
social relationships. Oxytocin is also involved in social –
verbal tempo and endurance in adults [19], a topic that
should be studied during infancy. There is an experience-
dependent sensitive period for setting the trajectory for
neural plasticity. Indeed, fetal and infant development may
be the pivotal period for the neocortex to experience and
use oxytocin as the developmental plasticity that oxytocin
confers is paramount for impacting the social brain early on
and does not function as efficiently later in development [72].
Our own studies have shown some important relation-
temperament and neurohormonal
ships between infant
factors that shape brain development. In particular, we exam-
ined the effects of the infant affective responsivity, dyad
bonding and breastfeeding in full-term infants through the
first six months of life in association with neuroendocrine
functioning prenatally and neonatally. These studies have
provided evidence that KC parent training and breastfeeding
support (compared with a control group) increase oxytocin
levels in full-term infants (and their mothers) but there
is large variation in the individual
levels of responses
[55,73]. Moreover, we have found associations between
higher oxytocin values, breastfeeding and left frontal electro-
encephalogram (EEG) asymmetry as well as changes (to
more optimal; approach style) in infant EEG patterns for
depressed mothers who maintain stable breastfeeding
patterns across the first three months. Although infants of
depressed mothers
frontal
EEG asymmetry, a neurophysiological pattern associated
with negative affect and social withdrawal, instead infants
of depressed mothers who breastfeed show an increase
in affectionate touch behaviours towards their mothers, a
shift towards higher oxytocin levels and left frontal EEG
asymmetry [75].

typically demonstrate right

Thus, our work and others’ demonstrates the interactive
effects of infant neurohormones. Furthermore, the persistence
of this relationship for cortisol [45,53] ( principally for infants
of depressed mothers) and the diverging effect for peripheral
oxytocin on mothers [67,76] and infants [73] have been docu-
mented, though questions endure. So while environmental
stressors like maternal depression and anxiety along with cor-
tisol reactivity confer risk, oxytocin (released in response to
skin-to-skin contact, maternal affectionate touch and breast-
feeding) buffers

environments

The mother’s contribution to fetal development is indisputable
and ubiquitous. As stated previously, total separation of the
mother’s effect on her fetus and infant is impossible so the
goal of this section is to briefly review the findings related to
the effects of the maternal (and paternal) hormones of cortisol
and oxytocin on infants’ temperament in risk and resilient
environments. During gestation, depending on the type,
timing, intensity and duration of maternal hormonal activity,
the placenta may act as either a shield against later risk or
a vehicle of exposure to risk, with negative consequences
possibly manifesting only in later development. Thus, studies
continue to query the degree of influence the maternal prenatal
environment and the associated hormones have on postnatal
development. Furthermore, in infancy and during postnatal
development, questions as to the role of risk, protection and
phenotypic variation in temperament persist, with a handful
of studies also including a paternal role in infant temperament
development. Recent
focus on
parental cortisol and oxytocin need further replication.

research paradigms that

(a) Cortisol
role in synthesizing
The placenta plays an important
maternal hormones for the developing embryo to use
during gestation [77,78], and can serve as a portal. Ulti-
mately, only certain maternal hormones are permitted to
cross the placental barrier, affecting subsequent fetal develop-
ment [45]. During prenatal maternal stress, the maternal
adrenal cortex releases the GC cortisol which is transmitted
to the fetal environment via the placenta, after which point
it can cross the fetal blood –brain barrier and uniquely influ-
ence fetal development. GC receptors are ubiquitous in the
brain and, given that they are involved in regulation of
gene expression [49], GC modulation can have lifelong impli-
cations
for disease vulnerability and for metabolic,
neuroendocrine, cognitive and emotional function [79]. GCs
are necessary for normal brain development [80,81]; how-
ever, abnormal GC levels
can disrupt normal brain
maturation and impair brain function [59].

While maternally released GCs act in a negative feedback
loop so as to re-establish homeostasis in the mother after
stress, maternal cortisol in fact induces a positive feedback
loop within the placenta [82],
triggering corticotropin-
releasing hormone (CRH) gene expression [80]. Exposing
the human fetus to abnormal
levels of CRH can affect
infant temperament. For example, in one study fetuses that
were exposed to lower levels of maternal CRH at 25 weeks
showed less distress behaviour and fear during infancy
according to ratings by their mothers [83]. In another study,
elevated levels of CRH during 31 weeks of gestation were
shown to express a decrease in neuromuscular maturity
[84]. Additionally, elevated maternal stress signals down-
regulate a placental enzyme (11b-hydroxysteroid)
that

catabolizes cortisol, allowing more maternal cortisol
to
reach the fetus [85]. High levels of maternal stress, especially
early in gestation, can lead to abnormally elevated placental
CRH and cortisol levels, resulting in shortened length of
gestation [86,87], delayed fetal maturation [82] and lower
birth weight [88], which is associated with more difficult
infant temperament at three months of age [87]. The amniotic
environment predicts postnatal infant regulation [89], which
in turn is associated with later childhood behavioural reactiv-
ity to stress [90], social skills [30] and cognitive development
[91]. Because the fetus is undergoing rapid growth and the
system is particularly vulnerable,
developing nervous
maternal experience and regulation are thus said to ‘pro-
gramme’, or direct, fetal and future infant development,
with potentially lifelong consequences [49,86,92].

After birth, the remaining direct biological connection
between maternal and infant regulation is the transmission
of GCs through breastfeeding. For example, elevated cortisol
levels in breast milk are associated with more negative effect
in female infants [93]. While maternal influence on fetal regu-
lation is biologically mediated, maternal influence necessarily
shifts after birth to more social pathways [94]. Maternal hor-
mones influence maternal sensitivity and quality of care and,
thus, remain important for infant development and infant
stress responsivity [53,67,76]. Maternal care practices (like
breastfeeding and sleep) are also associated with maternal
sensitivity, which refers to the extent to which mothers
notice, correctly interpret and quickly respond to infant
cues in an appropriate manner [95]. Because regulatory
capacities are not mature at birth, carer sensitivity and effi-
cacy are critical for infant regulation and regulatory system
development
[21,30]. Maternal psychological dysfunction
can lead to dysregulation of mother –infant interaction and
interrupt normal
[96].
Ultimately, infants’ behavioural, psychological and biological
function are inextricably tied to parent– infant dynamics
interaction and the developmental
through patterns of
plasticity of neuro-biological and -physiological systems.

infant self-regulation development

(b) Oxytocin
Elevated maternal oxytocin has also been linked with
increased maternal sensitivity and better quality of care
[97,98]. Oxytocin further appears to play a role in promoting
positive care behaviours in parents, dampening the negative
effects of stress, and in modulating fear and anxiety in
mothers [99]. Studies suggest that both sensitive care-giving
and innate self-regulatory behaviours modulate infant stress
levels [50]. For example, infants of sensitive mothers displayed
more mother-oriented behaviour during a challenging still-
face task [100] and we have found that infants touch their
depressed mothers more if the mother maintains a stable
breastfeeding relationship. Moreover, maternal sensitivity is
related to six-month infant hippocampal volume and to the
connectivity between the hippocampus and various areas in
the brain responsible for emotion regulation [101]. Maternal
sensitivity and mother–infant synchrony along with higher
oxytocin levels in early infancy are associated with better regu-
lation in infancy and toddlerhood [100,102]. It is thought that
when mothers recognize infant coping strategies and respond
appropriately, infants learn that they can influence dyadic
states and eventually learn to regulate themselves [41].

On the other hand, abnormal levels of maternal oxytocin
also have been linked to depression in pregnant women
[99,103], and low basal urinary oxytocin levels are related
to poor maternal–infant bonding and decreases in positive
parenting. Mothers with depression have been found to pro-
vide less emotional support to their children, who in turn
develop more emotional, behavioural and physiological
dysregulation [104,105]. Furthermore, negative infant tem-
perament is associated with maternal antenatal, perinatal
and postpartum depression [106]. Thus, there is a multidirec-
tional relationship between maternal oxytocin, depression,
mother –infant dynamics and infant negativity. Maternal
endocrine function influences maternal behaviour and
positive, appropriate maternal behaviour postnatally aids in
the healthy development of
infant regulatory capacities
and can even somewhat protect infants from the negative
consequences of prenatal stress [92].

It is important to note that there is a growing trend to
include paternal behaviour, hormones and genetics in
studies of infant regulatory development. For example, Feld-
[107–109] have associated both
man and co-workers
maternal and paternal oxytocin with infant neurohormonal
developmental patterns and family emotional bonds. More-
over, the family systems perspective has joined with the
biopsychosocial perspective to examine factors underlying
significant developmental advances in regulatory capacities
across the lifespan [110].

In sum, the parental neurohormonal milieu and its effect
is multi-
on fetal and infant
layered, complex and significant in both typically developing
infants and those at risk due to environmental circumstances.

5. Conclusion and future direction
While research consistently finds individual and maternal
neurohormonal effects on fetal and infant development,
meaningful questions persist. A deeper conceptualization of
the latent and interactive patterns between several interacting
neurohormones, as well as the impact that neurohormones

have on the brain and developmental plasticity, remains
incomplete. As newer ideas emerge, scientists must use
newer methodologies and analyses that focus on multidisci-
for gene (cid:2)
plinary, multilevel paradigms that account
environment interactions in regards to temperamental vari-
ation. Given the overlap that exists across current theories,
we suggest that they be integrated to form a multilevel, over-
temperament, a process that requires
arching theory of
scientists to cross disciplinary boundaries.

Previous studies have successfully linked maternal (and
paternal) neurohormones with developmental outcomes,
yet co-developments need to be examined further. Moreover,
additional work is needed to understand how the infant’s
own neurohormones are impacted and changed in normative
development as well as in different contexts of risk and resi-
in addition to contextual factors, future
lience. Similarly,
study should also account for differences in timing and
level of exposure to risk-related contexts, as efficacy of inter-
ventions may hinge on underlying factors as well as degree of
implementation.

Lastly, while there is growing interest in the genetic basis
for temperament, recent work in adults has demonstrated
that the link between genes and behaviour is sometimes
quite complex owing to the many factors involved especially
in ever-evolving infant temperament: the genes present, the
epigenetic modifications which are dependent on maternal
care and wider social environment, the translation of gene
expression to hormone production, and an individual’s
developmental range of adaptation to hormonal and social
experience. Neuro-ethologists, epigeneticists, developmental
neurobiologists and socio-affective neuroscientists should
work together to elucidate early developmental influences,
thereby uncovering the underlying processes by which indi-
vidual and social factors impact and potentially change
neurodevelopmental trajectories.
