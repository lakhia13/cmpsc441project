Abstract
  Previous studies have shown that experiences of childhood trauma disproportionally impact incarcerated youth and may 
decrease self-regulation skills including identification of emotions and ability to control behaviors.

Purpose:  The  current  study  aimed  to  investigate  changes  in  emotional  state  identified  by  incarcerated  youth  after 

receiving sensory-based occupational therapy treatment.

Methods: A quasi-experimental retrospective chart review design was used in addition to surveys.
Results: Participants had an average ACE score of 5.91 traumatic experiences and at least three mental health diagno-
ses. Results showed a statistically significant change between pre-and post-session emotions via a Likert scale as well as 
a decrease in the frequency of negative words used to identify emotions. When surveyed, participants reported a calmer 
body state after occupational therapy and highlighted the importance of learning coping strategies.

Conclusion: Results suggest that sensory-based occupational therapy may be an effective, trauma-informed interven-

tion to improve self-regulation and support daily function of these incarcerated youth.

Introduction

Incarcerated youth disproportionally experience trauma and 
have high rates of mental health disorders (Baglivio et al., 
2014; Dowdy et al., 2020; Kowalski, 2019). These experi-
ences may change neural development and function, impact-
ing the ability to label emotions and manage emotions in an 
adaptive manner (Chen et al., 2017). Incarcerated youth who 
have experienced trauma also have pervasive difficulties in 
self-regulation which is essential for daily function (Perry 
et al., 2018). Addressing these functional challenges with a 
trauma-informed approach means that providers recognize 
traumatic  experiences,  their  impact  on  function,  and  then 
select interventions that address these experiences (Cutuli et 
al., 2019). Sensory-based interventions are often selected in 
a trauma-informed approach for treatment as they facilitate 
a calm, safe state in which youth can practice adaptive strat-
egies for self-regulation (Fraser et al., 2017). Occupational

therapists are well-positioned to provide these interventions 
due to their training in sensory processing, ability to assess 
daily  function,  and  focus  on  client-centered  care  (Alers, 
2014).  Despite  their  skill  set  and  scope  of  practice,  occu-
pational therapists are being under-utilized in meeting this 
need in the juvenile justice system. The aim of the current 
study was to investigate the impact of sensory-based occu-
pational therapy on participants’ ability to identify a change 
in  emotions  as  well  as  to  document  research  participants’ 
perspectives  of  sensory-based  occupational  therapy.  The 
current study adds to a gap in the literature about the impact 
of  sensory-based  interventions  in  addressing  skill  deficits 
impacted by trauma.

Complex Trauma

Childhood  trauma  was  defined  by  the Adverse  Childhood 
Experience (ACE) study as experiences of physical, sexual, 
and psychological abuse as well as household dysfunction 
which  includes  neglect,  domestic  violence,  separation  of 
parents, substance use, mental illness, suicide, and incarcer-
ation (Anda et al., 2009; Felitti et al., 1998). When trauma 
occurs  frequently  or  for  long  periods  of  time,  especially

in  the  absence  of  safe  adult  relationships,  it  is  referred  to 
as  complex  trauma  (Shonkoff  &  Garner,  2012).  Complex 
trauma  dysregulates  the  neurological  stress  response  sys-
tem at varying levels depending on age of exposure, type of 
trauma, duration, number of adversities, interaction among 
adversities,  pre-existing  conditions,  and  protective  factors 
such  as  supportive  caregivers  (Nelson  et  al.,  2020;  Perry, 
2009). Complex trauma that occurs during sensitive periods 
of development may alter the structure and function of the 
amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus (Shonkoff & 
Garner, 2012; Teicher et al., 2003). The literature associates 
these changes with various maladaptive conditions includ-
ing  propensities  for  mental  health  diagnoses,  increased 
aggression,  poor  impulse  control,  diminished  adaptive 
arousal reactions, and decreased ability to perceive and/or 
express emotions (Ford et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2020; Tei-
cher et al., 2003; Thomason & Marusak, 2017).

Juvenile Justice & Complex Trauma

Young people involved in the juvenile justice system have 
experiences of trauma along with mental health challenges 
at rates higher than individuals not involved in the criminal 
justice system (Chen et al., 2017; Hayes & O’Reilly, 2013; 
Logan-Greene et al., 2017; Baglivio et al., 2014) found that 
incarcerated  youth  are  four  times  more  likely  to  experi-
ence four or more ACEs and 13 times less likely to report 
no  ACEs  than  individuals  from  the  original  Felitti  study 
(1998). Additionally, Kowalski (2019) found that over 80% 
of  incarcerated  youth  with  mental  health  issues  reported 
four or more ACEs while nearly 64% of incarcerated youth 
without mental health diagnoses still reported four or more 
traumatic events from childhood. The high rates of trauma 
and mental illness in this population must be addressed as 
these factors are correlated with a reduction in overall func-
tioning (Duron et al., 2021) and with higher rates of violence 
in criminal activity (Fox et al., 2015; Kowalski, 2019; Perez 
et al., 2016). Many incarcerated youth come from environ-
ments  described  as  “hot  spots”  for  crime,  have  been  vic-
tims of violence, perpetrate violence, and continue to live in 
violent and traumatic environments in the criminal justice 
system  (Roach,  2013). Their  brains  must  adapt  to  survive 
continual trauma and subsequently they appear proactively 
aggressive, replace fear with anger, and have difficulty with 
self-regulation (Ford, 2012; Roach 2013).

Trauma’s Impact on Emotions & Self-Regulation

Complex trauma in early life is associated with changes in 
neural  circuits  that  impact  emotional  intelligence,  defined 
as  one’s  ability  to  recognize,  identify,  and  manage  one’s 
own feelings (Reeves, 2005; Thomason & Marusak, 2017). 

Incarcerated  juveniles  who  have  experienced  trauma  not 
only  have more difficulty naming their emotions (Chen  et 
al.,  2017),  but  may  also  struggle  to  feel  their  suppressed 
emotions, an adaptation which they have learned as a cop-
ing mechanism (Hodgdon et al., 2013; Roach, 2013). These 
may manifest as explosive behavior and difficulty calming 
after  stress.  The  complex  trauma  incarcerated  youth  have 
experienced correlates with an overall disconnection from 
emotional  experiences  including  lack  of  body  awareness, 
misinterpretation of emotions expressed by others, and defi-
cits in the ability to control their own arousal levels (Ardizzi 
et al., 2016; Hart & Rubia, 2012; Pihet et al., 2012; Sharma 
et al., 2015; Hayes & O’Reilly, 2013) compared emotional 
identification  abilities  of  juvenile  offenders  to  adolescents 
with  and  without  identified  mental  health  diagnoses.  The 
results  of  their  study  indicated  that  young  detainees  had 
significantly  lower  abilities  to  recognize  emotions  in  both 
themselves and in other people. Emotional identification is 
important  for  effective  communication,  relationship-build-
ing, and in one’s ability to achieve self-regulation (Reeves, 
2005).

Self-regulation is defined as the ability to control one’s 
emotions  and  actions  in  the  context  of  environmental 
demands and higher goals (Langer et al., 2018; Perry et al., 
2018). Individuals who have experienced complex trauma 
at an early age are easily dysregulated and may not develop 
the  skills  needed  to  modulate  emotions,  inhibit  impulses, 
and redirect attention (Evans-Chase, 2014). This is impor-
tant to note as self-regulation skills start during early peri-
ods of development and as such can be accurately predicted 
as  early  as  the  age  of  five  (Perry  et  al.,  2018).  However, 
research  shows  that  aggressive  and  destructive  behaviors 
often  associated  with  delinquency  can  be  reduced  if  defi-
cits  in  emotional  management  and  inhibitory  control  are 
addressed in treatment (Perry et al., 2018).

Crucial Role of Sensory Input

The  literature  supports  the  premise  that  both  trauma  and 
emotions are processed at a somatosensory level, meaning 
that the sensory input individuals receive from the environ-
ment impacts how traumatic and emotional experiences are 
perceived,  stored,  and  used  to  make  decisions  (Evans  & 
Kim, 2013; Fraser et al., 2017; Mirolli et al., 2010). Chronic 
stress dysregulates sensory processing so significantly that 
it  has  been  correlated  with  sensory  patterns  of  low  regis-
tration and sensory avoidance (Dowdy et al., 2020; Engel-
Yeger  et  al.,  2013).  When  these  patterns  and  preferences 
are  considered,  sensory  input  can  be  used  strategically  to 
help young people reach a state of self-regulation allowing 
them to increase body awareness, connect with their emo-
tions, and increase overall ability to cope with the demands

of their environment in an adaptive manner (Sutton et al., 
2013). Trauma treatment using sensory-based interventions 
to increase self-regulation is gaining momentum with lim-
ited but promising evidence (Fraser et al., 2017; Lynch et 
al., 2021).

Patterned,  repetitive  sensory  activities  can  be  used  to 
facilitate self-regulation by calming the neural system prior 
to  teaching  language-based  skills  or  providing  cognitive 
interventions  (Fraser  et  al.,  2017;  Perry,  2009).  Sensory 
input may be provided using these repetitive activities, e.g. 
games,  or  simply  by  the  input  itself  which  may  include 
calming music, weighted blankets, large muscle activities, 
stretching, guided imagery, colored lights, blowing bubbles, 
deep breathing, and much more (Perry, 2009; Sutton et al., 
2013). After participating in these activities and reaching a 
state  of  calm,  incarcerated  youth  are  better  able  to  appro-
priately participate in treatment groups and are more likely 
to demonstrate the motivation and attention needed to learn 
from language-based interventions (Ford et al., 2012; War-
ner et al., 2014).

Sensory  input  delivered  through  calming  activities  like 
painting or creating music has been shown to be beneficial 
in  helping  young  offenders  recognize,  accept,  and  man-
age  emotions  related  to  trauma  (Woodward  et  al.,  2019). 
Interventions  that  address  self-regulation  with  a  positive, 
activity-based lens are lacking in the treatment of juvenile 
offenders where largely cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
approaches  are  used  (Logan-Greene  et  al.,  2017).  While 
some  cognitive-based  approaches  have  led  to  improve-
ments  in  the  ability  to  identify  emotions  and  self-regulate 
(Brazão et al., 2018), CBT may not be as effective for young 
offenders with extensive trauma histories (Kowalski, 2019). 
In  addition  to  classic  cognitive  approaches,  sensory-based 
activities that facilitate practice in emotional management, 
impulse control, goal setting, and self-efficacy can be used 
to  address  deficits  associated  with  complex  trauma  and 
mental health challenges (Logan-Greene et al., 2017).

Evidence supports the use of trauma-informed approaches 
that utilize sensory-based interventions to improve skills in 
self-regulation  and  emotional  intelligence  (Fraser  et  al., 
2017; Raider et al., 2008). One study showed that incarcer-
ated individuals who participated in a creative arts program 
demonstrated significant improvements in body awareness 
and social competence, two building blocks of self-regula-
tion  (Koch  et  al.,  2015).  Juvenile  offenders  in  a  mindful-
ness  training  program  indicated  they  were  better  able  to 
identify  and  regulate  emotions  as  well  as  control  behav-
iors  after  participating  in  sessions  that  utilized  meditation 
with education and activities (Himelstein et al., 2012; Bar-
rett, 2017) found similar results from a program that used 
meditation  and  yoga  to  reduce  stress  and  improve  emo-
tional  regulation. These  studies  support  the  importance  of 

supplementing  cognitive-based  treatment  approaches  with 
activity-based techniques that target the sensory system in a 
trauma-informed manner (Barrett, 2017; Fraser et al., 2017; 
Himelstein et al., 2012).

Potential for Occupational Therapy Intervention

Occupational  therapy  is  a  profession  that  uses  therapeutic 
activities to build skills and facilitate participation in every-
day life routines such as hygiene or sleep preparation, and 
life roles such as employee, student, and leisure participant 
(AOTA, 2020). Occupational therapists are well-trained to 
provide sensory-based, meaningful activities that are client-
centered and can address the negative impact of trauma and 
self-regulation  deficits  on  everyday  participation  (Alers, 
2014).  In  trauma-informed  care  it  is  important  to  do  this 
using  a  holistic  and  strengths-based  approach  that  builds 
trust, rather than targeting an individual behavior that needs 
to be corrected, such as fighting (Duron et al., 2021; Ford et 
al., 2016). While trauma treatment is complex and should be 
provided  using  an  interdisciplinary  team  approach  (Lynch 
et al., 2021; McGreevy & Boland, 2020), a review of sen-
sory-based approaches to trauma treatment found that only 
6 of 16 articles mentioned occupational therapy as part of 
the team (Fraser et al., 2017). Occupational therapists have 
a  vital  role  to  play  in  the  assessment  of  sensory  patterns, 
impact of trauma on daily function, and implementation of 
interventions that include both meaningful activity and sen-
sory input at levels that promote successful participation in 
life activities (Alers, 2014).

Specifically,  occupational  therapy  is  utilized  in  some 
psychiatric  settings  to  address  trauma  with  sensory-based 
interventions to decrease seclusion and restraint as well as 
improve overall engagement in everyday activities (Cham-
pagne, 2011a; Scanlan & Novak, 2015; Sutton et al., 2013; 
Warner et al., 2013). Treatment interventions may include 
use of sensory rooms for de-escalation (West et al., 2017), 
sensory-based activities such as soothing music and tactile 
mazes (Arnsten et al., 2015), and modifications to the envi-
ronment to facilitate adaptive self-regulation skills (Sutton 
et al., 2013). Despite the large percentage of juvenile offend-
ers  challenged  by  mental  health  disorders  and  histories  of 
trauma  (Baglivio  et  al.,  2014;  Hayes  &  O’Reilly,  2013), 
these  intervention  strategies  and  providing  skilled  occu-
pational  therapy  services  to  decrease  maladaptive  trauma 
responses and increase self-regulation in the criminal justice 
system are rare.

While still uncommon, most occupational therapy inter-
ventions  provided  in  the  justice  system  are  for  adults  and 
focus  on  building  transitional  skills  for  re-entry  into  the 
community (Muñoz et al., 2016). However, recent literature 
documents the effectiveness of sensory-based occupational

therapy treatment services for youth in the criminal justice 
system (Dowdy et al., 2020) found that sensory-based occu-
pational therapy helped youth decrease violence in a correc-
tional facility. Further, the study elicited youth voices who 
verbalized the importance of sensory activities in learning 
to  calm  and  thinking  more  positively  about  their  futures 
(Dowdy et al., 2020; Shea & Siu, 2016) explored the way 
occupational therapists used activities like bracelet making, 
drawing, puzzles, and games as a meaningful and appropri-
ate way to teach youth in detention interpersonal skills, self-
awareness, and life skills. Regardless of the skills taught or 
age-group addressed, occupational therapy shows promise 
in  criminal  justice  settings  in  providing  client-centered 
treatment that offers choices of activity which are motivat-
ing  for  and  valued  by  participants  (Crabtree  et  al.,  2016; 
Dowdy et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2015).

Method

Design and Sample

A quasi-experimental retrospective design (Jackson, 2015) 
was used with a naturally occurring group of incarcerated 
youth  who  were  selected  due  to  their  previous  or  current 
participation in occupational therapy. Lacking was a com-
parison  control  group.  The  participants  were  a  purposeful 
sample (Bowling & Ebrahim, 2005) of incarcerated youth 
ages  12–20  years  old  at  two  Midwestern  juvenile  correc-
tional facilities who had sensory-based occupational therapy 
intervention  focusing  on  self-regulation.  Inclusion  criteria 
for the retrospective chart review portion of the study were 
youth who have been referred to occupational therapy (e.g., 
for  social  skills  or  self-regulation  difficulties)  by  staff  at 
Facility A and Facility B (see Table 1). Inclusion criteria for 
the survey portion of the study was restricted to male youth 
at Facility A who participated in occupational therapy and 
were at least 18 years old and thus did not require parental 
or guardian consent to participate.

Instrumentation

Mental Health Diagnoses, ACE Scores, and the Emotions 
Intervention Tool

Data  collection  tools  included  documentation  of  mental 
health diagnoses, ACE scores, and the Emotions Interven-
tion Tool. For the purposes of this study and according to the 
current  Diagnostic  and  Statical  Manual  (DSM-V),  a  men-
tal health disorder is classified as any clinically diagnosed 
dysfunction  in  cognition,  emotion  regulation,  or  behavior 
(American  Psychiatric Association,  2013). An ACE  score 
is  defined  as  a  measure  of  an  individual’s  total  number 
of  adverse  childhood  experiences  based  on  a  widely  used 
10-category  questionnaire  where  exposure  to  a  common 
adverse experience counts as one point, and these points are 
summed together for a highest possible score of 10 (Anda et 
al., 2009; Kowalski 2019). Higher scores indicate a higher 
prevalence  of  traumatic  experiences’  categories  or  types, 
but the measurement does not account for the frequency or 
duration  of  exposure  to  each  category  of  trauma  (Kowal-
ski, 2019). The ACE score questionnaire has been shown to 
have strong criterion validity (Meinck et al., 2017).

Clinicians  at  the  two  facilities  developed  the  Emotions 
Intervention  Tool,  adapted  with  permission  from  Tina 
Champagne’s  work  (2011b),  for  use  at  the  beginning  and 
end of intervention sessions per normal clinical procedures 
independent of this study. The tool asked youth to answer a 
Likert scale (Joshi et al., 2015) question to rate from zero 
to  ten  how  they  felt  pre-  and  post-session  and  to  write  a 
word  describing  how  they  felt  pre-  and  post-session  (see 
Fig. 1). Youth were also asked to identify the sensory-based 
activity  they  wanted  to  use  during  the  session.  Clinicians 
documented the type of intervention provided and if it was 
conducted  in  an  individual  or  group  setting.  Intervention 
types  included  sensory-based  intervention,  meaningful 
activity,  and  mixed  intervention.  Sensory-based  interven-
tions  focused  on  modulating  one’s  responses  to  external 
sensory stimuli through activities such as listening to music. 
Meaningful activity was an activity selected by youth from 
a set offered by the clinician. The set of activities were age-
appropriate, pro-social, leisure activities valued by the indi-
vidual, such as playing a board game. A mixed intervention 
combined a meaningful activity with an intentional sensory 
component such as listening to music while playing a board 
game during an occupational therapy session. Psychometric 
testing  has  not  been  conducted  on  the  Emotions  Interven-
tion Tool.

participation. The five response options ranged from ‘Bad’ 
to ‘Great’ with each of the five anchor points represented by 
a  correlating  facial  expression  emoji  picture.  Finally,  one 
question asked youth to circle activities they participated in 
during occupational therapy from a list of 14 options. This 
question  was  followed  by  an  open-ended  question  asking 
them to identify their two favorite activities.

Procedures

Record Review

Study  procedures  were  approved  by  the  host  institution’s 
Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  for  the  protection  of 
human subjects and participating facilities. Data were col-
lected using a retrospective chart review and a survey at one 
or both facilities. An occupational therapist, also a member 
of the research team, completed a record review at Facility 
A (see Table 1) to attain youth ACE scores and mental health 
diagnoses, both of which were not accessible to researchers 
from Facility B. From the Fall of 2019 until the Fall of 2020, 
clinician members of the research team at both facilities kept 
records of the Emotions Intervention Tool sheets for clini-
cal  and  documentation  purposes.  The  clinicians  recorded 
youth scores and intervention types from individual Emo-
tions Intervention Tool sheets and converted the information 
into anonymous data points onto a study-specific Data Col-
lection Spreadsheet as part of the retrospective data review 
process. There was no master code sheet linking participant 
identities to the data. Clinicians met quarterly to control for 
treatment fidelity (Krefting, 1991) across facilities by veri-
fying consistency in identifying intervention types.

Survey

During the Fall of 2020, the first author read a recruitment 
script over Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (Zoom) invit-
ing youth at Facility A (see Table 1) who were 18–20 years 
old  and  had  or  were  participating  in  occupational  therapy 
to  complete  a  paper  survey.  Zoom  meetings  were  utilized 
instead of face-to-face interviews due to facility COVID-19 
restrictions  prohibiting  visitors. Youth  who  agreed  to  par-
ticipate completed the survey during the recruitment Zoom 
meeting. A  behavioral  health  staff  member  distributed  the 
survey to the youth in a private room in the facility and then 
waited outside the door until the youth completed the sur-
vey. Via Zoom, the first author read the survey instructions 
and  maintained  presence  to  answer  questions  the  youth 
might have. The youth were instructed to not provide any 
self-identifying information on the survey. The behavioral 
health  staff  member  collected  the  survey  from  the  youth 
to  ensure  confidentiality  of  their  responses.  To  enhance

Survey

Student authors designed a written survey tailored to facili-
tate  youth  comprehension  of  questions  asked.  The  survey 
consisted of 24 questions using four question formats. Half 
(i.e., 12) of the questions were open-ended and asked youth 
to  describe  experiences  related  to  feeling  states  (e.g.,  sad, 
angry,  feelings  pre-  and  post-occupational  therapy);  abil-
ity to and experiences related to controlling emotions; and 
their perceptions about participating in occupational therapy 
(e.g.,  favorite  activities,  how  occupational  therapy  helped 
them, and how they could use skills learned in occupational 
therapy at home).

The  survey  also  included  six  Likert  type  (Joshi  et  al., 
2015)  scale  questions  asking  for  level  of  agreement  to 
statements  about  the  impact  of  participating  in  occupa-
tional therapy. Three response options were provided, i.e., 
strongly agree, somewhat agree, and disagree. A picture of 
a thumb emoji representing the written level of agreement 
was placed under each option to facilitate comprehension. 
Five additional Likert type (Joshi et al., 2015) scale ques-
tions asked youth for their level of agreement to statements 
about emotions identification. Question topics asked about 
typical  emotional  states,  how  well  they  can  name  their 
emotions,  how  well  they  can  control  their  emotions,  and 
their  emotional  states  pre-  and  post-occupational  therapy

Emotions Intervention Tool Likert Scale

Data points were collected from 59 youth ages 12–20 and 
produced 413 Emotions Intervention Tool sheets, each rep-
resenting data from an individual occupational therapy ses-
sion at Facilities A and B. Of the youth, 32.3% participated 
in sensory-based intervention, 25.0% participated in mean-
ingful activity, and 42.7% participated in mixed intervention 
over a one-year period (Fall 2019 – Fall 2020). For youth 
who participated in a sensory-based intervention, the most 
chosen  activities  included  music,  fidgets,  putty,  slime,  or 
talking. For youth that participated in a meaningful activity 
intervention, the most chosen activities were crafts, discuss-
ing zones of regulation, playing games to better understand 
the zones of regulation, or playing a meme emotion game 
to increase awareness of emotions. For the youth who par-
ticipated in a mixed intervention, the most chosen activities 
included music or scented lotion paired with talking, stress

face  and  ten  anchored  by  a  sad  face,  the  average  pre-ses-
sion emotion number was 3.01 (SD = 2.50) and the average 
post-session emotion number was 1.45 (SD = 1.62). Out of 
413  data  points,  245  (59.3%)  showed  a  decrease  between 
pre-session  and  post-session  emotion  numbers.  Data  were 
filtered  to  remove  data  points  that  did  not  show  a  change 
because of the potential to artificially bias the t-test result. 
Among the filtered data set of 254 data points, the average 
pre-session  emotion  number  was  4.31  (SD = 2.10)  and  the 
average post-session emotion number was 1.77 (SD = 1.62).

of data sources through a sample of 11 surveys, a team of 
investigators,  and  expert  review  from  the  first  and  second 
authors (Krefting, 1991).

Analysis

ACE  scores  and  frequencies  of  mental  health  diagnoses 
were  analyzed  using  descriptive  statistics  to  produce  fre-
quency  counts.  The  Emotions  Intervention  Tool  pre-  and 
post-occupational  therapy  Likert  scale  (Joshi  et  al.,  2015) 
question responses were analyzed using Statistical Package 
for the Social Sciences (SPSS®) to conduct a paired samples 
t-test,  with  alpha  significance  level  pre-set  at  0.05.  Likert 
type (Joshi et al., 2015) question responses were analyzed 
to  produce  frequency  counts.  Usable  open-ended  question 
responses were grouped by similarities into categories and 
frequency of responses in each category was reported.

Results

Sample Size, Mental Health Diagnoses, and ACE 
Scores

   Participant demographics were not collected to protect youth 
privacy. General demographics at Facility A as provided by 
Ohio Department of Youth Services (2019) include an aver-
age  age  of  18.1  years,  65%  receiving  services  for  mental 
health  diagnoses,  53%  black,  35%  white,  and  12%  other. 
Mental  health  diagnoses  and  ACE  scores  were  collected 
through record review for 34 male youth ages 12–20 who 
had  received  occupational  therapy  services  at  Facility  A. 
The most prevalent mental health diagnoses were Cannabis 
Use Disorder (moderate to severe; 79.41%), attention defi-
cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 50%), Conduct Disorder 
(unspecified, childhood, or adolescent onset; 35.29%), Post-
Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD;  23.53%),  and  Alcohol

The difference between pre-session emotion and post-ses-
sion emotion number was statistically significant in both the 
complete data set (from M = 3.01 to M = 1.45; t(412) = 17.05, 
p = .000) and the filtered data set (from M = 4.31 to M = 1.77; 
t(253) = 22.79, p = .000). The highest frequencies of emotion 
words stated pre-session were calm (n = 78), happy (n = 41), 
chill (n = 33), irritated (n = 25), and tired (n = 23). Additional 
words stated with less frequency included good, frustrated, 
angry,  agitated,  and  aggravated.  The  highest  frequencies 
of emotion words stated post-session were calm (n = 132), 
happy (n = 69), chill (n = 45), good (n = 35), and tired (n = 17). 
Additional  words  stated  with  less  frequency  included  ok, 
relaxed, cool, excited, less stressed, and optimistic.

Survey

Eleven  youth  aged  18–20  at  Facility A  participated  in  the 
survey.  To  ascertain  emotional  vocabulary  when  asked 
about their most frequent emotions, youth who completed 
the  survey  chose  chill  (n = 6),  annoyed  (n = 5),  focused 
(n = 4), tired (n = 4), frustrated (n = 4), out of control (n = 2), 
and lonely (n = 2) as their most experienced emotions. The 
most frequently reported activities youth participated in dur-
ing occupational therapy included listening to music, talk-
ing  to  someone,  coloring  pages,  playing  repetitive  games, 
and doing arts and crafts.

Open-Ended Question Responses

For  questions  asking  about  perceptions  on  the  impact  of 
their  participation  in  occupational  therapy,  several  youth 
mentioned that it taught them coping strategies, life skills, 
and  how  to  talk  about  their  emotions  before  acting.  One 
youth  stated,  “I  learned  to  talk  about  my  anger  and  emo-
tions  instead  of  letting  it  all  build  up.”  Another  youth 
stated,  “when  I  felt  like  hurting  someone  real  bad  but  I 
remembered my coping methods from my sessions.” With-
out  strategies  to  control  their  emotions,  youth  stated, “my 
feelings  overpower  my  actions  and  judgment.”  Multiple 
youth  reported  meditating,  talking  to  staff,  taking  deep 
breaths,  and  expressing  themselves  creatively  as  methods 
that  help  control  their  emotions.  Participating  in  activities 
during occupational therapy sessions helped youth to “focus 
on something positive,” “forget about my frustrations,” and 
“calm  down.” After  participating  in  occupational  therapy, 
youth felt “focused” and motivated about their future. All 
(100%)  of  the  10  respondents  who  answered  all  10  ques-
tions  reported  they  have  used  something  they  learned  in 
occupational  therapy. This  was  further  supported  by  short 
answer responses, as one participant stated, “I learned a lot 
in OT that I can use in many different situations at home.”

Likert Type Survey Questions

For  questions  about  the  impact  of  participating  in  occu-
pational  therapy,  more  than  half  of  survey  participants 
indicated that occupational therapy helped them “a lot” to 
recognize  their  emotions.  All  of  survey  participants  indi-
cated that occupational therapy helped youth to change their 
behaviors and control their emotions. Further results from 
Likert  type  questions  about  the  impact  of  participating  in 
occupational therapy are summarized in Table 3. For ques-
tions  about  emotion  identification,  youth  responded  typi-
cally feeling “bad /not very good” prior to an occupational 
therapy session and reported feeling “really good/great” at 
the end of the session. Further results from Likert type emo-
tion identification questions are summarized in Table 4.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of sensory-
based  occupational  therapy  implemented  at  two  Midwest-
ern  juvenile  correctional  facilities.  Specifically,  this  study 
showed incarcerated youth to have higher than average ACE 

1 3228

 Journal of Child & Adolescent Trauma  (2023) 16:221–232

scores and/or number of mental health diagnoses, an ability 
to identify a positive change in emotions following occupa-
tional  therapy  interventions  designed  to  promote  self-reg-
ulation, limited emotional vocabulary, and overall positive 
perceptions of the impact of participating in sensory-based 
occupational therapy.

Contributing Personal Factors: ACE Scores and 
Mental Health Diagnoses

The high average ACE score of study participants (5.9) is 
consistent with research showing that traumatic experiences 
are  more  prevalent  in  justice-involved  youth  as  compared 
to  the  general  population  (Baglivio  et  al.,  2014).  These 
findings  agree  with  other  research  which  indicates  that 
early childhood trauma experiences can cause neurological 
changes and functional impairments, resulting in maladap-
tive behaviors such as aggression and risk-taking (Lewis et 
al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2020) seen in juvenile offenders.

Youth presenting with multiple mental health diagnoses 
is not surprising given that early experiences of trauma are 
associated with incurring mental health diagnoses through-
out life as well as higher rates of smoking, alcohol use, and 
cannabis  use  in  adolescence  (Afifi  et  al.,  2020;  Nelson  et 
al.,  2020). A  disproportionate  number  of  youth  within  the 
juvenile  facility  have  at  least  one  mental  health  diagnosis 
(Ohio Department of Youth Services, 2019) as compared to 
16.5% of youth ages 0–17 in the general United States pop-
ulation (Whitney & Peterson, 2019). Higher rates of trauma 
experiences  and  mental  health  diagnoses  among  incarcer-
ated youth points to the need to address the impact of these 
factors on their daily functioning.

Emotions Intervention Tool Data: Emotion Numbers 
and Emotion Words

Recognizing,  labeling,  and  regulating  one’s  emotions  can 
be  difficult  for  individuals  with  trauma  histories  (Cham-
pagne, 2011a; Chen et al., 2017) or mental health concerns 
(Logan-Greene et al., 2017). This study utilized a numerical 
approach with the Emotions Intervention Tool Likert scale 
to aid youth to recognize a change in emotion. Youth in this 
study identified a numerical change in emotional state fol-
lowing occupational therapy sessions. This change between 
pre- and post-session emotion numbers was statistically sig-
nificant, as 61.5% of youth showed a positive change fol-
lowing a sensory-based occupational therapy session. This 
is not surprising as past research showed the effectiveness 
of sensory-based interventions using non-invasive and self-
directed methods to facilitate participation by helping youth 
who have mental health concerns manage their emotions in 
times of distress (Scanlan & Novak, 2015).

The  study’s  findings  showed  youth  used  the  same  four 
words (i.e., calm, happy, chill, and tired) most frequently to 
label both their pre- and post-occupational therapy session 
emotional states. Aside from the four most frequently stated 
emotion words, the wide variety of the remaining pre-ses-
sion words contained a higher frequency of negative words 
(i.e., irritated, frustrated, mad) as compared to the remain-
ing post-session words that contained a higher frequency of 
positive words (i.e., relaxed, cool, excited). Based on both 
the Emotions Intervention Tool Likert scale results and the 
emotion  word  results,  youth  participating  in  occupational 
therapy  sessions  identified  a  change  in  emotional  state  on 
the Likert scale but were inconsistently able to associate the 
change with a change in emotion word.

The Emotions Intervention Tool Likert scale seemed to 
help  youth  identify  their  own  emotional  states.  Research 
suggests  that  youth  with  experiences  of  childhood  trauma 
have  difficulty  understanding  and  effectively  using  lan-
guage  to  label  their  emotional  experience  (Velotti  et  al., 
2017; Warner et al., 2013). Individuals lacking the ability to 
recognize and label emotions cannot appropriately respond 
to  their  emotions  and  regulate  their  behavior  accordingly 
(Roberton et al., 2014), such as when communicating with 
others  during  emotionally  charged  situations  or  managing 
conflict. This emphasizes the importance of providing youth 
with emotion identification and regulation strategies within 
a  safe  and  predictable  environment.  The  Emotions  Inter-
vention  Tool  Likert  scale  was  more  sensitive  to  detecting 
change in youths’ emotional state than asking them to inde-
pendently identify an emotion word. Based on this study’s 
results, using a combination of visual tools and Likert scales 
could  help  youth  understand  the  association  between  a 
change in emotional state and the paired emotion word label 
to describe the emotional state.

Youth Perceptions of Occupational Therapy

Generally, the literature lacks representation of incarcerated 
youth voices. In this study, youth voices support the effects 
of  sensory-based  occupational  therapy  in  enhancing  their 
ability to identify their emotions and implement self-regu-
lation strategies. Specifically, youth in this study recognized 
that  therapy  was  calming  and  beneficial  for  their  future. 
Consistent  with  past  research  (Dowdy  et  al.,  2020; Tan  et 
al.,  2015),  participating  in  occupational  therapy  provided 
youth with an opportunity to express feelings and develop 
tangible  ways  to  process  their  emotions  in  a  predictable 
environment.

A Need for Occupational Therapy

Youth  perceptions  of  occupational  therapy  in  conjunc-
tion  with  Emotions  Intervention  Tool  outcome  data  sup-
port occupational therapy’s value in providing meaningful 
engagement  in  a  correctional  facility.  Youth  in  juvenile 
facilities  have  similar  diagnoses  as  youth  in  psychiatric 
facilities (Hayes & O’Reilly, 2013) yet those in psychiatric 
facilities are more likely to receive occupational therapy as 
part of interdisciplinary team services. Youth in this study 
had  diagnoses  of  substance  use  disorder,  ADHD,  PTSD, 
conduct  disorder,  and  antisocial  personality  disorder,  like 
diagnoses  of  youth  in  a  psychiatric  clinic  which  provided 
services  to  all  the  above  diagnoses  except  antisocial  per-
sonality  disorder  (Hayes  &  O’Reilly,  2013).  Most  youth 
incarcerated  in  juvenile  facilities  do  not  have  occupa-
tional therapy as an available service. The lack of trauma-
informed treatment within juvenile facilities (Fraser, 2017) 
leaves youth without mechanisms to regulate responses to 
effectively  deal  with  changing  emotional  states  and  par-
ticipate  in  daily  activities.  Occupational  therapists  can  fill 
this gap as they consider person factors (AOTA, 2020) such 
as trauma history and mental health diagnoses when using 
sensory-based  treatment  and  active  participation  in  mean-
ingful  activities  to  treat  self-regulation  deficits  (Dowdy  et 
al., 2020; Lynch et al., 2021).

Occupational  therapists  use  a  trauma-informed  lens 
when  providing  sensory-based  interventions  involving 
music,  talking  to  someone,  repetitive  games,  and  arts  and 
crafts,  which  address  the  neurological  impact  of  trauma 
through targeting innervating neural sensory systems (Perry, 
2009).  Like  evidence  of  sensory  input  regulating  sensory 
arousal  and  creating  behavioral  changes  (Sutton  et  al., 
2013; Watling & Hauer, 2015), youth in this study reported 
a calmer body state after occupational therapy. Data showed 
that  youth  themselves  acknowledged  the  importance  of 
learning coping strategies and recognizing behavioral trig-
gers to improve daily functioning with mental health diag-
noses  and  histories  of  trauma.  Occupational  therapists  are 
well-equipped to address self-regulation and the impact of 
trauma on functioning through adapting activities and pro-
viding strategies for emotion identification.

Limitations & Strengths

The survey data was limited to participants who were at least 
18 years old due to the difficulty of obtaining parental con-
sent  for  youth  who  were  minors.  Survey  participants  may 
have been relatively more mature because of their age and 
the amount of time spent in the facility, which makes this 
study less generalizable to a younger age group. The findings 
of  the  study  may  not  be  transferable  to  other  correctional 

facilities  due  to  the  unique  environment  and  services  pro-
vided at each facility as well as the lack of information col-
lected about frequency and duration of treatment. Another 
limitation  of  the  study  included  a  lack  of  a  control  group 
due to unethical implications of withholding treatment from 
youth. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic limited in-person 
treatment and thus the number of data points collected.

Future  studies  might  investigate  a  specific  protocol  for 
frequency  and  duration  of  sensory-based  occupational 
therapy  in  residential  settings.  Additionally,  the  context 
of  the  facility  might  be  examined  to  explore  the  impact 
of  a  trauma-informed  environment  and  the  potential  role 
of  occupational  therapists  training  other  staff  members  in 
trauma-informed care practices.

Strengths of the study included triangulation of data col-
lection through survey and the Emotions Intervention Tool. 
The  sample  size  for  the  Emotions  Intervention  Tool  data 
was relatively large. The research was conducted by a team 
consisting  of  student  researchers  and  a  clinical  tutor  and 
faculty  tutor,  who  provided  expert  review  to  the  students. 
Finally, the study provided youth with a unique opportunity 
to  have  their  voices  heard  as  they  expressed  their  percep-
tions of occupational therapy.

Practice Implications

The  results  of  this  study  highlight  the  importance  of 
addressing  the  neurological  impact  of  trauma  and  mental 
health challenges on the daily functioning of youth within 
juvenile justice facilities. Sensory-based interventions pro-
vided  by  occupational  therapists  have  been  shown  to  be 
effective in treating individuals with experiences of trauma 
(Lynch et al., 2021; McGreevy & Boland, 2020). Occupa-
tional therapy can help youth develop self-regulation skills, 
such as emotion identification, and adjust arousal levels to 
be able to better cope within a stressful environment. When 
utilizing these skills, youth may be able to self-regulate and 
safely return from a heightened state of arousal to be able to 
interact with peers more appropriately as well as attend to 
classroom tasks with greater attention, focus, and impulse 
control. The results of this study point to the effectiveness 
of sensory-based interventions that are client-centered and 
tailored  to  the  arousal  level  and  cognitive  ability  of  the 
youth in the juvenile justice setting. Occupational therapists 
that have training in trauma-informed care can apply their 
professional  assessment,  recommendation,  and  consulta-
tion skills to be valuable assets amongst an interdisciplinary 
mental  health  team. The  presence  of  occupational  therapy 
staff  as  members  of  interdisciplinary  mental  health  teams 
needs to be expanded which requires funding support from 
correctional institutions.
