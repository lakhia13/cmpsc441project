Objective: The prevalence of sleep disorders during the perinatal period is high and large health
administrative database surveys have shown that the use of exogenous melatonin in pregnant
populations is quite common, about 4%. Much of the concern about using melatonin during pregnancy
and breastfeeding stems from animal research. Thus, the objective of this article is to provide a critical
review of human studies related to exogenous melatonin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Methods: The electronic databases Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were
searched using terms and keywords related to melatonin, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
Results: Fifteen studies were included in this review. Eight
focused on melatonin use during
pregnancy and seven focused on melatonin use during breastfeeding. There was a variety of study
designs, including case reports, cohort studies, and clinical trials. There is a lack of randomized,
controlled trials examining the efﬁcacy and safety of melatonin as a treatment for sleep disorders
during pregnancy or breastfeeding and, notably, insomnia was not the primary outcome measure in
any of the studies included in this review. Clinical trials that used exogenous melatonin during
pregnancy and breastfeeding for other clinical conditions have not suggested major safety concerns or
adverse events.
Conclusion: Contrary to what animal studies have suggested, evidence from clinical studies to date
suggests that melatonin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is probably safe in humans. This
review further emphasizes the need for clinical studies on sleep disorders, including exogenous
melatonin, during pregnancy and lactation.

Keywords: Melatonin; pregnancy; breastfeeding; clinical trials

Introduction

Sleep disturbances, including insomnia, are very common
in pregnancy. Prevalence estimates of pregnant women
with sleep disturbances range from 66 to 94%, with higher
rates as pregnancy progresses into later trimesters.1,2
A variety of pregnancy-related hormonal and physiologi-
cal changes could contribute to these sleep disturbances.
Studies have shown that chronic sleep loss in pregnant
women is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes,
including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia,3 and pre-
term birth,4 as well as adverse fetal outcomes.5 Increas-
ing evidence also suggests that sleep disturbances may
have signiﬁcant consequences for mental health during
pregnancy and the postpartum period. Insomnia during
late pregnancy has been associated with co-morbid
depressive symptoms,6 and poor sleep during both late
pregnancy and the postpartum period have been found
to be associated with postpartum depression symptom
severity.7 In a systematic review of
the relationship

between sleep and postpartum depression, seven out
of 10 studies that used subjective sleep assessments
found a relationship between sleep disturbances in the
3rd trimester and the development of postpartum depres-
sion.8 Furthermore, 17 out of 20 studies that used
subjective sleep assessments found a relationship
between sleep disturbances in the postpartum period
and the development of postpartum depression.8
Although the review found evidence for the relationship
between self-reported sleep disturbances and postpartum
depression, the evidence for the relationship between
objectively assessed sleep and postpartum depression
was mixed.8 Most of the research in this area has focused
on postpartum depression, but one study also found an
association between insomnia in late pregnancy and
perinatal anxiety.9 Research on sleep during pregnancy
and the postpartum period is of the utmost importance
due to the high prevalence of sleep disturbances in this
population. Moreover, this has a signiﬁcant impact on
other aspects of health, including postpartum psychiatric

illness, which is one of the leading causes of maternal
morbidity and mortality in the perinatal period.10

There is also evidence that treating sleep disturbances
can prevent postpartum depressive symptoms. A ran-
domized clinical trial treated insomnia during the 3rd
trimester with either trazodone, diphenhydramine, or
placebo, ﬁnding that trazodone and diphenhydramine
signiﬁcantly improved sleep and reduced postpartum
depressive symptoms compared to placebo.11 As such,
studying the safety and efﬁcacy of
treatments for
disturbed sleep during pregnancy and breastfeeding is
critical not only for improving sleep and thus quality of
life in this population, but also for reducing postpartum
depression. In addition, a number of non-pharmacologi-
cal treatment options have been found to improve self-
reported maternal sleep, including massage, exercise,12
and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.13 There
are also various pharmacotherapy options for insomnia
and other sleep disorders, but human data regarding
pregnancy and breastfeeding are largely lacking and,
despite reassuring safety data for certain medications,
potential concerns still include congenital anomalies and
neonatal withdrawal.14

the vast majority of

Melatonin is a hormone released by the pineal gland
primarily to regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Exogenous
melatonin supplementation is often used for short-term
treatment of insomnia and sleep-wake cycle disturbances
and is available over the counter in Canada and the
United States, making it widely accessible. Melatonin
use was reported by 0.9% of pregnant women in a
psychiatrically ill population15 and, more generally, by
about 4% of pregnant women aged 18 to 40 years old.16
Such high rates of use in pregnant populations highlight
the importance of studying the safety and efﬁcacy of
melatonin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. To
date,
the safety concerns about
melatonin use during pregnancy have come from animal
studies. For example, a study of antenatal melatonin
treatment
in pregnant sheep found potential adverse
effects, including decreased birth weight and prolonged
gestation.17 Another study of antenatal melatonin in rat
dams found that it resulted in the mortality of most pups
by 6 weeks of age.18 Conversely, other animal studies
have found no adverse effects from maternal melatonin
administration and instead show evidence of neuropro-
tective effects for offspring.19 Additionally, since endo-
genous melatonin plays a role in the development of
fetal circadian rhythms by transferring information about
maternal circadian rhythms through the placenta or
breast milk,20 there are theoretical, but as yet unproven,
concerns that exogenous melatonin use may alter this
development in humans.21

Due to conﬂicting evidence from animal studies and
the high rates of estimated use in pregnant women,
there is a need to review and synthesize the available
human studies of exogenous melatonin use during
pregnancy and breastfeeding. The objective of this article
is to provide a critical review of clinical studies related
to exogenous melatonin use during pregnancy and
breastfeeding.

Methods

A literature review was conducted by searching the
electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and
Cochrane Library using appropriate Medical Subject
Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords related to mela-
tonin, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. The speciﬁc terms
used for the search strategy included the MeSH descriptors
‘‘pregnancy or breast feeding or prenatal care or postnatal
care’’ or keywords ‘‘pregnan* or prenatal or postnatal or
feed* or breastfeed* or gestation*’’ and MeSH
breast
descriptor ‘‘melatonin’’ or keyword ‘‘melatonin’’. Duplicates
were removed from the database search results, and the
records were screened by a ﬁrst independent reviewer
(TV), followed by a second independent reviewer (BF)
(Figure 1). The selected articles were clinical studies that
focused on melatonin use during pregnancy or breastfeed-
ing. No study designs were excluded, so any relevant case
reports, case series, cohort studies, cross-sectional stu-
dies, open label studies, and randomized controlled trials
were included. The reference lists of articles that received
a full-text review were also examined to identify any
additional references that would be relevant to this review.
Through this methodological approach, a total of 15 articles
were included.

Results

Of the 15 studies included in this review, eight focused
on melatonin use during pregnancy15,16,22-27 and seven
focused on melatonin use during breastfeeding.28-34
Seven of the pregnancy studies and three of the lactation
studies involved exogenous melatonin. The breakdown of
study designs of the included studies is as follows: ﬁve
cross-sectional studies, two randomized controlled trials,
two experimental studies, two Phase I clinical trials, one
case study, one dose-ranging study, one feasibility study,
and one cohort study. Notably, insomnia was not the
primary outcome in any of these studies. Three studies
actively measured congenital anomalies, obstetric, and/or
neonatal complications as outcomes.

Melatonin use during pregnancy

Two of the included studies focused on the epidemiology
of melatonin use during pregnancy.15,16 A large U.S.
national survey of 2,217,213 pregnant women aged 18
to 40 years old found that about 4% reported using
melatonin in the past 12 months.16 Another study that
surveyed 534 pregnant women in a psychiatrically ill
population reported that 0.9% used melatonin.15

Three clinical trials have investigated the use of mela-
tonin as an antioxidant treatment for various conditions
during pregnancy.22-24 A randomized controlled trial
compared the effects of melatonin and quercetin, a

ﬂavonoid supplement,
hyperglycemia.22 Women in the melatonin group recei-
ved 10 mg daily from the 15th week to the 33rd week of
pregnancy.22 Overall, a composite of six neonatal
complications was signiﬁcantly lower in the melatonin

group than the quercetin group.22 Three of the neonatal
complications (hypoglycemia, stillbirth or neonatal
death, and birth injury) were not observed in any
the melatonin group.22 The other three

complications (need for phototherapy, respiratory dis-
tress, and macrosomia) were seen in small percentages

signiﬁcantly better maternal glycemic control in women
treated with melatonin.22 This study concluded that
melatonin is clinically more efﬁcacious than quercetin for
treating pregnant women with hyperglycemia and did not
ﬁnd any safety concerns regarding the use of melatonin
during pregnancy.22

Another study explored the use of melatonin as an
antioxidant treatment for preeclampsia.23 After results
from the in vitro placental explant model showed that
melatonin reduced oxidative stress and enhanced
antioxidant markers, a phase I clinical trial was initiated
for 20 pregnant women with early-onset preeclampsia to
receive 30 mg total of melatonin daily (taken as 10 mg
three times per day) from diagnosis until delivery.23 This
trial
found that melatonin was safe for women with
preeclampsia and their fetuses, and did not report any
adverse events or adverse drug reactions in the
mothers, fetuses, or neonates.23 The women did not

report increased daytime drowsiness, which is another
important safety ﬁnding.23 The trial also found that
melatonin signiﬁcantly extended the mean diagnosis-
to-delivery interval by 6 days and decreased the need
for antihypertensive medications compared to historical
controls.23 The neonates of melatonin-treated women
did have a higher rate of being small for gestational age
at birth than historical controls; however, the fetuses
also had a higher rate of being small for gestational age
at time of recruitment, before the initiation of melatonin
treatment, and no other neonatal outcomes differed from
controls.23

The ﬁnal study using melatonin as an antioxidant
treatment was for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).24
This phase I clinical trial of 12 pregnant women with
severe early onset IUGR involved a melatonin treatment
group and a historical control cohort.24 Women in the
melatonin group received 8 mg total daily (4 mg twice per
day) from recruitment until delivery, and the trial reported
no adverse maternal or fetal effects associated with
melatonin administration.24 Furthermore, the trial found
that in placentae collected at birth, the concentration of
placental malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress,
was signiﬁcantly lower in women treated with melatonin
than controls.24

The three remaining studies of melatonin use during
pregnancy focused on aspects of the placental transfer
of melatonin.25-27 One study obtained placentae from
three normal, term pregnant women at delivery, isolated a
single cotyledon, and perfused it to create an isolated
to investigate the
perfused single cotyledon model
transfer of antioxidants, including melatonin, across full
term normal human placenta.25 Based on values seen in
pregnancy, 200 pmol/L of melatonin was administered to
the maternal compartment, and it crossed the placenta
rapidly and similarly to the freely diffusible comparator
marker.25 Equilibration of melatonin concentration between
the maternal and fetal compartments was reached within
150 minutes, without signiﬁcant metabolism of
the
melatonin.25

A study of serum melatonin concentrations included 30
women with normal singleton pregnancies, as well as 16
women with twin pregnancies, 19 preeclampsia pregnan-
cies, 14 IUGR pregnancies, and seven non-pregnant
controls.26 Nighttime serum melatonin levels were con-
sistently higher than daytime levels throughout preg-
nancy, with nighttime levels of normal singleton pregnant
women gradually increasing after 24 weeks to become
signiﬁcantly higher after 32 weeks, compared to non-
pregnancy, o 24-week pregnancy, and puerperium
values, which returned to non-pregnant
levels by the
2nd day of puerperium.26 In twin pregnancies, nighttime
melatonin levels were signiﬁcantly higher after 28 weeks
and, conversely, in IUGR pregnancies melatonin levels
were generally (but not signiﬁcantly) lower after 36 weeks,
both compared to normal singleton pregnancies.26 In
women with severe preeclampsia, melatonin levels were
signiﬁcantly lower than in women with mild preeclampsia
or women with normal pregnancies after 32 weeks.26
Finally, samples were also collected from the umbilical
arteries and veins after delivery, and melatonin levels
tended to be higher in the umbilical artery than umbilical
vein.26

Looking more speciﬁcally at maternal-fetal transfer of
melatonin near term, another study collected samples
from a maternal vein,
the umbilical artery, and the
umbilical vein at the time of birth.27 This study included
12 women who spontaneously delivered vaginally and did
not receive any melatonin, as well as 33 women who
delivered by elective caesarean section and received
3 mg of melatonin either 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours before the
delivery.27 There was also a third group of pregnant
women at term who received 3 mg of melatonin when
they were not in pain and had blood samples taken every
hour
the next 4 hours, which showed that oral
melatonin administration led to increased serum melato-
reached a maximum 2 hours after
nin levels that
administration and then signiﬁcantly decreased over the
following 2 hours.27 The results from the women who
delivered vaginally showed that serum melatonin levels in
the maternal and umbilical veins did not differ signiﬁ-
cantly, and the concentration in the umbilical vein was
signiﬁcantly and closely correlated with the concentration
in the maternal vein.27 In the women who received
melatonin prior to caesarean section, changes in serum
melatonin levels in the umbilical artery and vein were

correlated with those in the maternal vein, suggesting that
maternally administered melatonin is transferred easily
and rapidly to fetal circulation at term.27

Melatonin use during breastfeeding

Two studies included in the present review investigated
the rhythm of melatonin in human milk.28,29 The ﬁrst study
found that in 10 mothers of neonates sampled 3 to 4 days
after delivery, melatonin was not present at a detectable
level (o 43 pmol/L) in either blood or breast milk during
the day, but the melatonin level rose to 280634 pmol/L in
serum and 99626 pmol/L in breast milk at night.28 The
melatonin concentration in breast milk was on average
the serum concentration.28 Individual
about 35% of
proﬁles of 24-h breast milk melatonin levels collected
within 3 months after delivery also demonstrated a
pronounced daily rhythm, with slight timing differences
between individuals.28 The second study of melatonin
rhythm collected breast milk samples from 42 women at
three different stages of maturity: postpartum day 3
(colostrum), day 10 (transitional milk), and day 30 (mature
milk).29 Results for all
the
melatonin concentration was higher in nocturnal samples
than diurnal samples.29 In diurnal samples, the melatonin
concentration was signiﬁcantly lower in mature milk than
in colostrum or transitional milk.29 In nocturnal samples,
the melatonin concentration was signiﬁcantly higher in
transitional milk than in colostrum.29

three stages showed that

This review included one study that focused on the
stability of melatonin in human milk.30 This study also
found that melatonin levels were signiﬁcantly higher in
nighttime milk than daytime milk.30 Milk samples were
collected from 13 women during the ﬁrst 6 months of
breastfeeding and were immediately
then
defrosted after about 4 months and assayed to mimic
freezing, storing, and defrosting
real-life conditions of
milk.30 Melatonin levels in milk were not signiﬁcantly
different immediately after defrosting or after 1, 2, 3, 4, or
24 hours, although they had increased variability 24 hours
after defrosting.30 This study concluded that melatonin
is stable in breast milk for at least 4 hours (even up to
24 hours) after defrosting.30

frozen,

Another study compared melatonin levels in the breast
milk of 5 women and in 3 artiﬁcial formulas, ﬁnding that
melatonin followed a clear circadian rhythm in breast milk
but was undetectable in all artiﬁcial formulas.31 They also
applied a questionnaire to 94 mothers, ﬁnding that
exclusively breast-fed infants had a signiﬁcantly lower
incidence of colic attacks and a lower severity and
frequency of irritability attacks than formula-fed infants.31
The breast-fed infants also trended toward longer
nocturnal sleep duration, although this was not signiﬁcant,
and they aroused signiﬁcantly more times during the
night.31 Combining the questionnaire and the milk/formula
analysis results, the authors suggested that the reason
breastfeeding was more advantageous than formula
regarding infantile colic may be the role breast milk plays
in melatonin absorption through the infant’s gastrointest-
inal tract.31

Only one included study discussed exogenous mela-
tonin use by a breastfeeding mother.32 This was a case
study of an 18-month-old child who had a history of
bleeding episodes since birth. The episodes were
associated with a reduced platelet aggregation time after
breastfeeding but a normal aggregation time in a fasting
state.32 The child’s mother occasionally used melatonin
during and after pregnancy (unspeciﬁed dose and
frequency), so maternal melatonin intake was suspended.
After 3 months, platelet aggregation returned to normal
and there were no further bleeding episodes.32 The
authors suggested that one potential side effect of
maternal melatonin use was to induce non-fatal bleeding
in infants through breastfeeding.32

The ﬁnal two studies investigated the pharmacokinetics
of melatonin in preterm neonates.33,34 In the ﬁrst study,
18 preterm infants (born with less than 31 weeks of
gestation and less than 7 days old) received intravenous
infusions of melatonin in the following dose regimens:
0.1 mg kg-1 h-1 for 6 hours, 0.1 mg kg-1 h-1 for 2 hours,
0.02 mg kg-1 h-1 for 2 hours, and 0.01 mg kg-1 h-1 for
2 hours, and 0.04 mg kg-1 h-1 for 30 minutes.33 Baseline
melatonin in the infants was largely undetectable, but the
dose regimen of 0.1 mg kg-1 h-1 for 2 hours achieved
melatonin concentrations closest to adult physiological
concentrations.33 Regarding the pharmacokinetic results,
melatonin clearance was 0.045 L/h, the volume of distri-
bution was 1.098 L, and the half-life was 16.91 hours, with
race and sex as signiﬁcant covariates.33 No adverse
events were reported.33 These results revealed that,
compared to adults and older children, both the clearance
and half-life of melatonin are prolonged and the volume of
distribution is decreased in preterm infants, which may have
implications for dosing in this population.33 The second
study administered oral melatonin to 15 preterm infants
(born less than 37 weeks’ gestation and 24-72 hours old) in
the following dose regimens: one intragastric bolus
of 0.5 mg kg-1, three intragastric boluses of 1 mg kg-1
at 24-hour intervals, and three intragastric boluses of
5 mg kg-1 at 24-hour intervals.34 Regarding the pharma-
cokinetic results,
the half-life in plasma ranged from
7.98 to 10.94 hours, the area under the curve ranged from
10.48 to 118.17 mg mL-1 h-1, and the time to reach
maximum concentration ranged from 2.91 to 4.70 hours.34
This study also concluded that the pharmacokinetic proﬁle
of melatonin in premature neonates is different than in
adults, with a prolonged half-life and time to maximum
concentration, and that a single oral melatonin dose
repeated every 12 or 24 hours could be used to obtain
and maintain high serum concentrations for therapeutic
purposes in preterm infants.34

Discussion

Studies investigating melatonin use during pregnancy
have revealed a number of ﬁndings. Firstly, the proportion
of psychiatrically ill pregnant women who report melatonin
use is quite signiﬁcant (approximately 1%)15 and is even
higher in the general pregnant population (approximately
4%).16 This highlights the importance of studying the
safety and efﬁcacy of exogenous melatonin use for both

maternal and fetal outcomes. Secondly, there is evidence
that maternally administered exogenous melatonin
crosses the placenta easily and rapidly at or near term,
similar to a freely diffusible marker and without signiﬁcant
metabolism.25,27 Serum melatonin levels peak 2 hours
after administration27 and maternal and fetal concentra-
tions reach equilibrium within 150 minutes.25 These
ﬁndings about the placental transfer of melatonin demon-
strate that maternal administration can affect the fetus,
and thus this topic should be clinically studied. As for
endogenous melatonin, serum nighttime levels signiﬁ-
cantly increase later in pregnancy before decreasing
postpartum. These levels are even higher
in twin
pregnancies but, conversely, are signiﬁcantly lower in
severe preeclampsia pregnancies.26 Thus, serum mela-
tonin levels vary throughout pregnancy, as well as
between different conditions associated with pregnancy
and, although the mechanism for this is not well under-
stood, it may represent a potential therapeutic target.26

In terms of clinical trials, the present review found no

melatonin as an antioxidant
during pregnancy, speciﬁcally hyperglycemia,22 pree-
clampsia,23 and IUGR.24 Each of these trials reported
that melatonin had some efﬁcacy for each condition,
although sample sizes were relatively small. Importantly,
the three trials reported safety concerns or
none of
adverse maternal or fetal events related to melatonin
administration during pregnancy.22-24 Of note, the dose of
melatonin used in these trials ranged from 8 to 30 mg
daily, whereas over-the-counter melatonin is typically
available in tablets ranging from 1 to 10 mg, with 10 mg
marketed as maximum strength. The lack of safety
concerns in trials with higher doses suggests that safety
concerns might be even less likely in over-the-counter
doses. Furthermore, the trial with the highest daily dose
(30 mg) reported no increased daytime drowsiness, which
is another important safety ﬁnding about sleep disorder
treatments.23 Overall, the results of the eight included
studies on melatonin use during pregnancy revealed that
it is common and that it crosses the placenta easily and
rapidly, although it has not been associated with safety
concerns or adverse events in clinical
trials to date.
However, there is a clear lack of clinical trials investigating
the safety and efﬁcacy of melatonin for sleep disorders
during pregnancy, and this review highlights the need for
well-powered clinical trials in this area.

Regarding melatonin and breastfeeding, melatonin in
breast milk clearly follows a circadian rhythm, with higher
levels at night and lower levels during the day, which has
been reported by multiple studies.28-31 This rhythm is
consistent over the stages of breast milk maturation,
although there are slight differences between stages,
notably that nocturnal levels are higher in transitional milk
than colostrum.29 The concentration of melatonin in
breast milk is about 35% of the serum concentration,28
and melatonin in breast milk is stable in real-life conditions
of freezing, storing, and defrosting.30 Regarding potential
beneﬁts, one study suggested that the melatonin in breast

milk may be associated with lower severity and frequency
of infantile colic.31 Conversely, a case study of a breast-
feeding mother using exogenous melatonin found a
possible association with non-fatal bleeding episodes in
the child.32 The present review found no clinical trials
investigating safety or efﬁcacy as an outcome of
exogenous melatonin use during breastfeeding, revealing
a signiﬁcant gap in the literature. However, studies of
exogenous melatonin administration directly to preterm
infants reported no adverse events.33,34 Furthermore, the
pharmacokinetic proﬁle of melatonin in premature infants
is different than in adults, with prolonged clearance, half-
life, and time to maximum concentration, as well as
decreased volume of distribution.33,34 This highlights why

is critical

Due to the scarcity of clinical trials of melatonin use
during pregnancy and breastfeeding, especially trials with
outcomes related to safety and efﬁcacy in sleep dis-
orders, no conclusions can be drawn from the available
evidence. However, the present review does reveal that
no major safety concerns or adverse events have been
reported in clinical studies, with the exception of one case
report.32 Thus, although we cannot strongly conclude that
melatonin use is safe during pregnancy and breastfeed-
ing, the available evidence from clinical studies suggests
that melatonin use is probably safe in humans. The safety
concerns about melatonin use in pregnancy originated
from animal studies and include decreased birth weight,17

medications that were teratogenic in animal models but
not in humans.35 For example, although corticosteroids
were found to cause oral clefts in mice,36 they are now
commonly used in humans during both early and mid-to-
late pregnancy.37 Therefore, the signiﬁcance of animal
studies should be kept in perspective, especially since the
clinical
literature about melatonin use during pregnancy
and breastfeeding continues to grow. A recent review
revealed that safety and efﬁcacy data are largely lacking
regarding various other pharmacotherapy options for
insomnia during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and
current evidence from animal and human studies is
mixed.14 Ultimately, the current review serves to further
emphasize the need for robust clinical studies of sleep
disorders in pregnant and breastfeeding populations,
including exogenous melatonin, given its prevalent use
in the general population and in individuals with psychia-
tric disorders.
