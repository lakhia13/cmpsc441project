Background: Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is a multi-component cognitive behavioural intervention with 
proven efficacy in treating people with borderline personality disorder symptoms. Establishing benchmarks for 
DBT intervention with both adults and adolescents is essential for bridging the gap between research and clinical 
practice, improving teams’ performance and procedures. 
Aim: This study aimed to establish benchmarks for DBT using the EQ-5D, Borderline Symptoms List (BSL) and 
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) for adults and adolescents. 
Methods: After searching four databases for randomised controlled trials and effectiveness studies that applied 
standard  DBT  to  people  with  borderline  symptoms,  a  total  of  589  studies  were  included  (after  duplicates’ 
removal), of which 16 met our inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis and respective effect-size pooling calculations 
(Hedges-g) were undertaken, and heterogeneity between studies was assessed with I2  and Q tests. Benchmarks 
were calculated using pre–post treatment means of the studies through aggregation of adjusted effect sizes and 
critical values. 
Results: DBT aggregated effect sizes per subsample derived from RCTs and effectiveness studies are presented, 
along with critical values, categorised by age group (adults vs adolescents), mode of DBT treatment (full-pro-
gramme vs skills-training) and per outcome measure (EQ-5D, BSL and DERS). 
Conclusions:  Practitioners  from  routine  clinical  practice  delivering  DBT  and  researchers  can  now  use  these 
benchmarks to evaluate their teams’ performance according to their clients’ outcomes, using the EQ-5D, BSL and 
DERS. Through benchmarking, teams can reflect on their teams’ efficiency and determine if their delivery needs 
adjustment or if it is up to the standards of current empirical studies.   

Introduction 

Dialectical  behaviour  therapy  (DBT)  is  a  multi-component  and 
integrative treatment that synthesises behavioural theory, principles of 
Zen practice and dialectics (Linehan, 1993). This therapy was initially 
designed  to  treat  people  with  chronic  suicidality  who  had  received  a 
diagnosis  of  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD).  It  was  the  first 
treatment to consistently demonstrate clinical efficacy with this client 
group and continues to be the most supported (Stoffers-Winterling et al., 
2012, 2022). 

DBT comprehensive treatment, also referred to as full-programme, 

includes  four  modes  of  treatment:  individual  psychotherapy,  skills 
training,  phone  coaching,  and  consultation  for  therapists  (Linehan, 
2015; Swales &  Heard, 2017). The skills are taught in a group format 
(and  strengthened  in  individual  therapy)  and  include  modules  on 
emotional regulation, mindfulness, distress tolerance and interpersonal 
effectiveness. For less severe clients (without suicide ideation or active 
self-harm),  non-comprehensive  skills  training  can  be  offered  (which 
ideally  should  still  include  a  consultation  team  and  phone  coaching) 
(Linehan, 2015; Valentine et al., 2015). 

BPD is a severe disorder characterised by emotional, interpersonal 
and  intrapersonal  instability,  impulsivity,  self-harm  behaviours  and

feelings of emptiness and abandonment (American Psychiatric Associ-
ation, 2022; Biskin, 2015; D’Aurizio et al., 2023; Zanarini et al., 2011). 
Borderline symptoms usually begin in adolescence and are associated 
with negative affect and a high risk of suicide, which remains as high as 
10 % over a 27-year course (APA, 2022; Videler et al., 2019). This sui-
cide  rate  is  partially  due  to  emotional  dysregulation  (Mirkovic  et  al., 
2021)  and  low  levels  of  quality  of  life  (IsHak  et  al.,  2013).  When 
assessing the efficacy of DBT, researchers have focused on decreasing 
borderline symptomatology, increasing skills use (e.g. emotion regula-
tion), as well as decreasing suicide and self-harm behaviour (Stoffers--
Winterling et al., 2022) and quality of life interfering behaviours, thus 
looking for improvements in quality of life (Carter et al., 2010; Chakhssi 
et al., 2021; van Asselt et al., 2009). 

Scientists, healthcare professionals, and decision-makers worldwide 
recognise  that  evidence-based  clinical  interventions  do  not  translate 
easily into routine practice due to numerous implementation challenges 
(Eldh  et  al.,  2017),  resulting  in  a  research-practice  gap  (Chorpita  & 
Daleiden, 2014; Gotham, 2006; Teachman et al., 2012). One recognised 
barrier is the practitioner’s scepticism (Lilienfeld et al., 2013), partially 
relating to concerns about whether clients and therapists in RCTs are 
representative of those in typical clinical settings (Hunsley & Lee, 2007). 
Delgadillo et al. (2014) conducted a comprehensive examination of 
the widespread implementation of empirically supported treatments in 
routine practice and assessing outcomes in everyday clinical settings. In 
doing  so,  they  identified  notable  challenges  associated  with  the  mea-
surement, definition, and comparative analysis of clinical outcomes. For 
future benchmarking initiatives, the authors emphasised the importance 
of  comparing  effect  size  estimates  derived  from  condition-specific 
measures  with  those  obtained  using  more  generalised  distress  mea-
sures.  Furthermore,  the  authors  emphasised  the  need  for  a  nuanced 
approach to benchmarks, considering contextual, diagnostic, and pop-
ulation factors in specific settings. 

Benchmarking  is  an  outcome  assessment  strategy  used  to  assess 
clinical services (Eisen & Dickey, 1996) by evaluating patients’ data and 
clinical outcomes (Lovaglio, 2012). In clinical psychology, a benchmark 
represents a standard of care or best practice for specific treatments or 
interventions,  working  as  a  reference  point  for  comparison  or  mea-
surement. The key takeaway is that benchmarking fundamentally aims 
to  enhance  practices  and  processes,  ultimately  improving  outcomes 
through establishing care standards, identifying and delivering effective 
treatments, and monitoring care quality (Lloyd, 2004). 

Only one study, to our knowledge, has established benchmarks for 
DBT treatment in adult outpatients with BPD (Washburn et al., 2018). 
However, this study had strict inclusion criteria and focused exclusively 
on RCT studies delivering DBT full-programme measuring depression, 
anger  and  self-harm.  Moreover,  Washburn  et  al.  (2018)  aggregated 
studies that used different instruments to measure the above-mentioned 
outcomes, which has limitations when drawing benchmarks since they 
vary in their specificity and reactivity (Minami et al., 2008). Addition-
ally,  considering  their  database  search  was  done  in  2016,  a  more 
up-to-date review is required, especially one including DBT skills groups 
intervention  and  including  adolescents.  Finally,  for  a  comprehensive 
team performance evaluation, it is crucial to employ measures assessing 
health-related  quality  of  life  to  inform  cost-effectiveness  and  mecha-
nisms of change within the treatment. 

The project was developed as part of an ongoing collaboration be-
tween Bangor University, British Isles DBT Training, and NHS England, 
formerly Health Education England (HEE), to significantly increase the 
number of trained DBT clinicians embedded in active DBT programmes. 
As part of the project, there was an aim to benchmark the clinical out-
comes  of  teams  as  a  means  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  training 
programme in producing a return on the training investment. 

The first challenge faced was the lack of a body of evidence to draw 
from. Due to a general lack of previous studies benchmarking the con-
structs we were interested in assessing, there was a need to first establish 
benchmarks based on empirical studies, including both effectiveness and 

RCT studies, to obtain a suite of benchmarks for teams to use to compare 
against their own routine clinical practice outcomes. 

The current study aims to provide benchmarks for DBT treatment by 
meta-analysing data from quality RCTs and effectiveness studies deliv-
ering standard DBT (full-programme/ or stand-alone skills training) to 
adults and adolescents with BPD symptoms and that used the same in-
struments to measure emotion regulation, health-related quality of life 
and borderline symptoms. 

Methods 

Benchmarking methodology 

In terms of the steps to start benchmarking, we considered the plan 
described  by  Lloyd  (2004)  and  the  considerations  of  Bayney  (2005), 
beginning with the selection of the data collection method and estab-
lishing the measures to act as benchmarks. Furthermore, we reviewed 
specific studies that benchmarked mental health interventions, adopting 
their recommendations and structure (Delgadillo et al., 2014; Minami 
et al., 2007; Weersing & Weisz, 2002). Minami et al.’s (2008) proposal 
to  withdraw  benchmarks  from  clinical  trials  was  followed,  given  its 
clarity  and  high  citation  rate  in  other  studies.  In  order  to  review  the 
published  clinical  trials,  a  thorough  database  search  was  conducted, 
followed by a meta-analysis of the collected data. This analysis included 
published  studies  using  three  selected  measures  (described  below)  to 
measure  DBT  intervention  outcomes  in  adults  and  adolescents  with 
borderline features so that DBT teams can use them to assess their per-
formance.  Weersing  and  Weisz  (2002)  advise  estimating  benchmarks 
based on studies that used an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach; how-
ever, excluding studies without clear ITT information would have led to 
a substantial loss of data, mainly from effectiveness studies, hindering 
the establishment of robust and representative benchmarks. Hence, we 
decided to include studies that described only completers data, report-
ing the used method for all the studies. 

Selection of outcome measures 

The considerations of Delgadillo et al. (2014) on selecting outcome 
measures to benchmark were followed: weighing up the research evi-
dence of the tools, sensitivity to change with the intended population, 
ease of administration and interpretation and measures that are free to 
use and easily accessible. 

Minami et al. (2008) indicated that ideally, the selection of clinical 
trials for inclusion for a benchmark should utilise identical measures to 
ensure they match in specificity and reactivity. Following this guideline, 
we selected three measures to assess: health-related quality of life, which 
in  addition  allows  for  clinical  and  economic  appraisal;  difficulties  in 
regulating emotions, which  is considered  an important mechanism of 
change  in  DBT;  and  a  disorder-specific  measure  for  borderline 
symptoms. 

Selected instruments and rational 

The  EQ-5D-3  L  (EuroQol  Research  Foundation,  2018),  henceforth 
referred to as "EQ-5D" is a widely used generic measure of health status 
consisting of two parts. The first part (the descriptive system) assesses 
health  in  five  dimensions  (mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities,  pain/-
discomfort,  anxiety/depression),  each  of  which  has  three  levels  of 
response (no problems, some problems, extreme problems/unable to), 
providing a health state profile. Each health state is assigned a summary 
index score based  on  societal preference  weights for the  health state. 
These weights, or utilities, are used to compute Quality-Adjusted Life 
Years (QALYs) in health economic analyses. Health state index for the 
United  Kingdom  ranged  from  1  (’perfect’  health  state),  with  higher 
scores  indicating  higher  health  utility,  to  (cid:0) 0.543.  EQ-5D’s  negative 
range in the interval corresponds to health status ’worse’  than death, 
which  has  face  validity  in  suicidal  populations  and  can  vary  slightly

The second part of the questionnaire consists of a Visual Analogue 
Scale (VAS) on which patients rate their perceived health from 0 (the 
worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health). EQ-5D-3 L 
has revealed good test-retest reliability across studies ranging from 0.53 
to 0.83 (Buchholz et al., 2018). The EQ-5D questionnaire is cognitively 
undemanding,  taking  only  a  few  minutes  to  complete.  A  version  for 
adolescents is also available (EQ-5D-3L-Y), with the same components 
and some adjustments to the language only. The anchor points for the 
EQ-5D,  with  0  representing  death  and  less  than  1  a  state  worse  than 
death,  make the  EQ-5D a perfect  measure conceptually for treating a 
client group where a central feature is the desire to die by suicide and in 
whom suicide rates are high. The measure also aligns well with DBT’s 
primary aim to create a life worth living (i.e., utility score is sensitive to 
changes in psychotherapy for people with BPD (van Asselt et al., 2009). 
The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 
2004) measures difficulties in regulating emotions, which is considered 
one of the core problems experienced by people with a diagnosis of BPD 
(Glenn & Klonsky, 2009). This instrument is one of the most widely used 
to  measure  this  construct  (Sloan  et  al.,  2017),  and  it  has  been  used 
effectively to detect changes in interventions for BPD (Stoffers-Winter-
ling et al., 2022). This self-report questionnaire assesses six components 
of  difficulties  in  regulating  emotions:  nonacceptance  of  emotional  re-
sponses, difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviour, impulse control 
difficulties,  lack  of  emotional  awareness,  limited  access  to  emotion 
regulation  strategies,  and  lack  of  emotional  clarity.  The  36  items  are 
rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging between 1 ("almost never") and 5 
("almost always"). The DERS has shown good psychometric properties, 
with high internal consistency, a Cronbach’s α  of 0.93, and test-retest 
reliability  of  0.88.  There  is  a  short  form  with  18  items  (DERS-SF; 
Kaufman et al., 2016), and both versions are validated to use with adults 
and  adolescents  (DERS-36,  Gratz  &  Roemer,  2004;  Neumann  et  al., 
2009; DERS-SF, Weinberg & Klonsky, 2009). 

The Borderline Symptoms List (BSL; Bohus et al., 2009) is a self-report 
questionnaire with 23 items, which aims to assess BPD symptoms. This 
scale’s  items  cover  BPD  diagnostic  criteria  (e.g.,  affective  instability, 
recurrent  suicidal  behaviour  or  threats,  non-suicidal  self-injury,  and 
transient dissociative symptoms) and borderline-typical processes such 
as  self-criticism,  emotional  vulnerability,  self-disgust  and  loneliness. 
Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("very 
strong").  This  instrument  was  chosen  because  it  has  recently  been 
updated in line with the criteria in DSM-5 and was developed based on 
the experiences of both clinical experts and input from people with a 
diagnosis  of  BPD  (Kleindienst  et  al.,  2020).  The  BSL-23  has  a 
single-factor structure and excellent psychometric properties, with high 
internal consistency, a Cronbach’s α of 0.97, and test-retest reliability of 
0.82 (Bohus et al., 2009). Moreover, it is an instrument tested on over 
1000 adults with defined cut-off scores and severity levels (none or low, 
mild,  moderate,  high,  very  high,  and  extremely  high)  that  facilitates 
score interpretation. In their study to propose severity levels, Kleindienst 
et al. (2020) specify that a score of 1.5 is typical for someone with a 
diagnosis of BPD but highly extreme compared to someone without a 
psychiatric diagnosis. 

While many DBT outcome studies focus on suicidal behaviour and 
Non-Suicidal  Self-Injury  (NSSI),  we  decided  against  endeavouring  to 
benchmark these outcomes for several reasons. First, studies use widely 
varying  measures  of  these  constructs,  making  comparison  difficult. 
Second, the most reliable and valid measures of this construct used in the 
literature are typically interview-based and beyond the capacity of many 
routine clinical services. Finally, not all clients within a DBT service will 
necessarily be suicidal or engaging in NSSI. These reasons make mea-
sures  of  these  constructs  less  applicable  to  all  clients  in  a  service. 

Additionally, self-harm benchmarks are already available in Washburn 
et al.’s (2018) study. 

Search procedures 

Our research team performed a literature search in September 2022 
on the efficacy of DBT for the treatment of BPD. The search terms used 
were "dialectical behavior therapy" or equivalent (e.g., "DBT", "dialec-
tical behaviour therapy"), "borderline personality disorder" or related (e. 
g.,  "BPD",  "borderline  symptoms"),  and  "randomised  controlled  trial", 
"systematic  review"  or  similar  (e.g.,  "RCT",  "meta-analysis",  "clinical 
trial"). The search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed/ 
MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science. The study selection 
was then performed in two phases. Firstly, through screening the titles 
and abstracts, and secondly, the full texts, according to the inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria.  We  also  searched  for  systematic  reviews  or  meta- 
analyses  on  DBT  efficacy  or  effectiveness  to  ensure  that  we  had 
included all relevant studies. The search was repeated in May 2023 to 
check if new studies had been published, but no additional articles met 
our inclusion criteria. 

We included only original articles published in journals with peer 
review  and  used  the  PICO  (Population,  Intervention,  Comparison, 
Output) approach, which is depicted in Table 1. To include the articles in 
our review the following characteristics were also confirmed:  

(a)  RCT or effectiveness study design  
(b)  Conducted  in  public  mental  health  and  community  outpatient 

settings  

(c)  Written in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese or German  
(d)  Full text available (either in open access or through subscription - 
database  search  from  Bangor  University  and  University  of 
Coimbra)  

(e)  Good quality of the articles using the JBI critical appraisal tools 

(Joanna Briggs Institute, 2017) 

A similar approach was used for RCTs and effectiveness studies, so 
comparison or control groups were not accounted for comparison. It is 
also important to clarify that the studies selected reported that partici-
pants engaged in pharmacotherapy and maintained the treatment pro-
vided  by  their  psychiatrist  or  GP  (as  usual  in  most  psychotherapy- 
focused  studies).  Participants  were  not  required  to  remain  on  consis-
tent medication; therefore, medication changes may have occurred. 

A  flow  diagram  with  the  identification  and  selection  process  is 
depicted in Fig. 1. A total of 1253 studies were identified and uploaded 
into Rayyan (https://rayyan.ai/), a free web platform that helps expe-
dite the initial screening of abstracts and titles for systematic reviews 
(Ouzzani et al., 2016) and 589 duplicates were eliminated. We included 
only original articles published in journals with peer review. 

A total of 627 studies were excluded after applying our criteria. We 
selected 37 studies for full-text detailed reading and quality assessment. 
Of these, 21 were excluded for the following reasons: sample already 
included in one of the selected studies (5 studies); modified DBT (for 
example, DBT Prolonged Exposure); different length or adaptation for 
non-BPD populations (5 studies); necessary data not reported, namely 
the outcomes M and SD (5 studies); low study quality (according to JBI 
critical appraisal tools) (2 studies); mixed samples (4 studies). 

The main features (e.g.,  study design,  sample size) of the  final 16 
selected studies can be found in Table 2, of which 13 used adult samples 
and  three  adolescent  samples.  These  studies  were  conducted  in  eight 
different countries: USA (4), Ireland (3), Canada (3), Australia (2), UK 
(1), Germany (1), Netherlands (1) and Norway (1).

data, as well as study bias with the JBI critical appraisal tools (Joanna 
Briggs  Institute,  2017).  The  checklist for  randomised  controlled  trials 
(13  items)  was  used  for  RCTs,  and  the  quasi-experimental  studies 
checklist (non-randomised experimental studies; nine items) was used 
for the effectiveness studies. The authors of the JBI tool do not provide a 
cut-off for the scale, stating the result depends on the reason for using 
the scale and how rigorous a user of the scale would like to be with the 
accepting/excluding  criteria.  We  decided  to  accept  RCTs  above  eight 
(from  a  maximum  possible  score  of  13),  considering  that  some  items 
result from methodological choices or blinding related parameters that 
were not relevant considering the benchmark goal for routine practice. 
The  checklist  for  quasi-experimental  studies  includes  four  items 
related to having a comparison group, which depresses the score to a 
maximum  of  five.  Thus,  provided  the  studies  met  the  five  quality 
criteria, we included effectiveness studies without a control group. 

Reliability  was  ensured  by  having  two  independent  assessors  who 
rated the quality of the studies separately. Any discrepancies identified 
were resolved through consensus discussions with all assessors, resulting 
in the final presented score (see Table 2). 

Data extraction process and calculation of benchmarks 

The  pre–post  M  and  SD  for  DERS,  BSL  and  EQ-5D,  as  well  as  the 
sample size of the groups that received DBT, were retrieved from the 
papers. In regards to the EQ-5D, we found three studies which only re-
ported the EQ-5D VAS scores and not the utility scores. Therefore, it was 
decided  to  contact  the  authors  to  request  their  datasets  and  their 
permission to use their outcomes to generate benchmarks. The authors 
Sinnaeve  et  al.  (2018)  and  McMain  et  al.  (2009,  2022)  granted 
permission to use their data and provided the necessary information and 
databases at the beginning of 2023. Once all the necessary information 
from the studies was gathered, an analysis for heterogeneity was per-
formed, followed by aggregated benchmarks for different data group-
ings.  We  found  different  lengths  for  full-programme:  some  studies 
delivered the full-programme for 12 months, and some for 6 months. A 
mean  comparison  was  performed  to  search  for  significant  differences 
(with respect to the instruments we were interested in) for these two 
programme lengths, and none were found in the outcomes of interest. A 
recent  McMain  et  al.  (2022)  study  compared  6  and  12-month  pro-
grammes and while differences were found in suicidality across time and 
in  pre–and 
hospital  admissions,  no  differences  were  observed 
post-outcomes regarding the variables of interest in our study. For that 
reason,  we  decided  to  group  all  the  studies  that  delivered 
full-programme  (6  M  and  12  M),  taking  into  consideration  that  the 
6-month has the same content as the 12-month programme (the content 
of the programme is delivered across six months, and then it is repeated 
in the following six to consolidate treatment gains). The studies were 
then grouped according to the type of trial, the modes of DBT delivered, 
the instrument they used and their age group. 

Heterogeneity  between  studies  was  assessed  with  standard  meta- 
analysis  statistical  methods.  The  percentage  of  effect  size  variability 
was evaluated using the I2 formula (values of 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % 
indicate no observed low, moderate, or large degrees of heterogeneity, 
respectively).  The  Cochran’s  Q-test  was  used  to  determine  whether 
statistical heterogeneity existed. To explore possible sources of hetero-
geneity,  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  according  to  the  type  of 
treatment  (full-programme  vs  skills  programme),  age  (adolescent  vs 
adult) and trial (effectiveness vs RCT). To obtain pooled estimates and 
95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the mean difference (MD) between 
post-treatment  and  baseline  scores  in  each  subgroup,  a  meta-analysis 
was  performed  using  Hedges’  g  method  (Hedges,  1981).  Given  that 
significant  heterogeneity  was  found,  random-effects  models  (Higgins 
et al., 2009) were used with the restricted maximum-likelihood method 
(DerSimonian & Laird, 1986). The inverse variance weighting approach 
was applied to assign weights to studies, giving less weight to smaller 
studies than larger ones. Forest plots were used to represent the pooled

(d+).

obtain a single pre-treatment–post-treatment effect benchmark d + j for 
each  outcome  measure  category  (see  formulas,  Minami  et  al.,  2008). 
Additionally, in order to establish that an effect size estimate obtained 
from  clinical  settings  is  equivalent  to  efficacy  benchmarks,  previous 
literature  suggested  using  a  critical  value  which  is  dependent  on  the 
sample size of the clinical setting data. We adopted the minimum effect 
size of dmin  = 0.2 as the criterion for clinically significant differences 
between  benchmarks  and  the  treatment  effect  size  estimates  for  a 
range-null hypothesis test, (Minami et al., 2008) and we reported them 
only for the aggregated studies (RCT + Effectiveness). 

A total of 673 adult participants were included in these benchmark 
calculations, 534 receiving DBT full-programme and 139 receiving Skills 
group intervention. A total of 173 adolescents receiving full-programme 
were also included. 

Results 

As the Q and I2  statistics for homogeneity indicated that effect size 
estimates were heterogeneous, the reported benchmarks should not be 
considered an estimate of a single population parameter but rather the 
mean of the effect sizes estimates (Shadish & Haddock, 1994). 

Results of the subgroup meta-analyses indicate that DBT significantly 
improved  both  difficulties  in  emotion  regulation  and  BPD  symptoms 
(see Figs. 2–4), for the full-programme (MD = - 34.62, k = 7, 95 % CI 
[(cid:0) 41.71,  (cid:0) 27.53];  MD  = (cid:0) 0.76,  k  = 9,  95  %  CI  [(cid:0) 1.02,  (cid:0) 0.49], 
respectively), versus skills modes (MD = (cid:0) 31.76, k = 2, 95 % CI [- 46.35, 
(cid:0) 17.16]; MD = (cid:0) 0.81, k = 2, 95 % CI [(cid:0) 1.15, (cid:0) 0.48], respectively), and 
effectiveness studies (MD = (cid:0) 30.84, k = 5, 95 % CI [(cid:0) 38.37, (cid:0) 23.32]; 
MD = (cid:0) 0.77, k = 7, 95 % CI [(cid:0) 1.13, (cid:0) 0.41], respectively) vs RCTs (MD 
= (cid:0) 37.69, k = 4, 95 % CI [(cid:0) 47.62, (cid:0) 27.76]; MD = (cid:0) 0.73, k = 4, 95 % CI 
[(cid:0) 0.86, (cid:0) 0.60], respectively). When analysing adolescents and adults 
separately, subgroup analyses indicate that DBT was effective for both 
adolescents and adults, as measured by BSL (MD = (cid:0) 0.72, k = 3, 95 % CI 
[(cid:0) 0.91, (cid:0) 0.54]; MD = - 0.78, k = 8, 95 % CI [(cid:0) 1.08, (cid:0) 0.47], respec-
tively). For the DERS, only one study included adolescents, so it is only 
possible to pool the adults’ results, which were also significant (MD =
(cid:0) 34.43, k = 8, 95 % CI [(cid:0) 40.96, (cid:0) 27.90]). For EQ-5D (USc and VAS), 
subgroup analyses were not performed, given that all the studies found 
were  RCTs,  with  adults,  and  delivered  full-programme.  The  meta- 
analyses showed that DBT full-programme applied to adults in an RCT 
design significantly improves both EQ-5D utility scores (EQ-5D US) and 
perceived health (EQ-5D VAS; MD = (cid:0) 0.06, k = 4, 95 % CI [0.02, 0.09]; 
MD = 7.31, k = 4, 95 % CI [3.52, 11.11], respectively). 

Benchmarks for adults 

The weighted pre and post-treatment (full-programme) M and SD of 
the  RCTs  and  effectiveness  studies  were  aggregated  per  assessment 
measure  (BSL,  DERS  and  EQ-5D)  and  per  type  of  study  (RCTs  and 
Effectiveness studies), as shown in Table 3. 

The  aggregated  treatment  efficacy  benchmarks  for  DBT  full-pro-
gramme’s intervention are displayed in Table 4, grouped by instrument 
and type of trial, and for DBT skills intervention in Table 5 (only RCTs, 
because  there  were  no  effectiveness  studies),  showing  the  overall  ag-
gregation  of  the  means  and  effect  sizes  of  the  studies,  as  well  as  the 
calculated critical value when possible. Additionally, in Figs. 5 and 6, it 
is possible to see the critical values and effect sizes by trial type for BSL 
and  DERS,  according  to  the  sample  size  estimations.  For  studies 
reporting skills-only intervention, only the BSL and DERS studies pro-
duced benchmarks (in adults) because there were no studies using the 
EQ-5D. There were no significant mean differences either in pre- or post- 
outcomes between the effectiveness studies and the RCTs. 

Benchmarks for adolescents 

Only  three  studies  with  adolescents  were  possible  to  include  to 

establish benchmarks, and those studies used either BSL (n = 2) or DERS 
(n = 1), with no studies using EQ-5D. From these studies, we decided to 
include both samples of adolescents (experimental and control group) of 
Gillespie et al. (2019) because they differ only in the treatment length 
(16 vs 24 weeks), with no significant differences between groups in the 
studies using the BSL. The four data samples retrieved from the three 
studies  with  adolescents  are  presented  in  Table  6,  aggregated  per  in-
strument  when  possible.  The  aggregated  effect  sizes  for  BSL  are  pre-
sented in Table 7. We also calculated if from Berk et al. (2018) study, 
which used the DERS and revealed a large effect size (d = 1.095). 

Discussion 

The interest in benchmarking psychological interventions is on the 
rise. This seems to be driven by policy changes and requests from regular 
service  providers  (Delgadillo  et  al.,  2014;  Moroz  et  al.,  2020).  As  a 
result, there is an increased emphasis on recognising the significance of 
setting  global  standards  for  mental  health  systems.  Providing  bench-
marks  for  empirically  supported  treatments  is  essential  to  serve  as  a 
reference point for national implementation efforts. Currently, the main 
challenges  when  benchmarking  any  treatments  are  establishing  com-
mon measures to benchmark against and the lack of consensus on what 
and how to benchmark. This study therefore offers a proposal for com-
mon ground, providing benchmarks to assess standard DBT, based on 
RCTs  and  effectiveness  studies  using  our  three  selected  instruments 
(EQ-5D-3 L, BSL and  DERS).  This will  allow  clinical services that are 
using  these  instruments  to  compare  their  performance  against  these 
standards.  In  mental  health  treatments,  benchmarking  can  play  an 
essential  role  in  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  the  treatments  being 
offered to ensure outcomes are being compared to standards. 

Even though DBT is now a widely used treatment for people with a 
diagnosis  of  BPD,  with  substantial  evidence  of  its  efficacy  (Gillespie 
et al., 2022; Stoffers-Winterling et al., 2022), when performing a broad 
literature search  through four widely used databases, it  became clear 
that a multiplicity of measures are in use with little common ground. 
After applying our inclusion criteria that aimed to find robust studies 
using  our  chosen  measures  (while  delivering  DBT  full-programme  or 
skills),  we  were  only  able  to  select  16  studies  from  the  664  studies 
identified. The small number of studies confirms the difficulties previ-
ously  mentioned  by  other  authors,  making  it  hard  to  compare  their 
outcomes against the literature (Delgadillo et al., 2014). 

The retrieved studies served as the basis for aggregating outcomes for 
the BSL, DERS, and EQ-5D, enabling us to establish benchmarks for both 
the full DBT programme and the skills programme for adults, as well as 
the full-programme for adolescents (using the BSL alone). Meta-analyses 
were performed per instrument and per subgroup (by type of trial, age 
group  and  DBT  mode).  Results  indicated  improvements  in  emotion 
regulation, a decrease in BPD symptoms, and increased health-related 
quality of life (EQ-5D). On the one hand, the significant heterogeneity 
observed across most studies (except BSL in adolescents) emphasises the 
need  for  caution  when  interpreting  and  generalising  these  calculated 
benchmarks. On the other hand, the subgroup analysis proves valuable 
as it reveals that DBT leads to significant improvements in the assessed 
instruments  across  various  contexts  (consider  the  controlled  and 
rigorous nature of RCTs vs effectiveness studies), modes (comprehensive 
DBT  vs skills  only),  and  samples (adolescents  vs  adults).  This  implies 
that the studies used to derive these benchmarks are robust sources of 
data.  They  provide  substantial  support  for  the  efficacy  of  DBT  in-
terventions  and  validate  the  sensitivity  of  the  chosen  instruments  to 
changes within this population and treatment context. 

Until this point, researchers and clinicians applying DBT interven-
tion  with  our  selected  instruments  were  limited  to  comparing  their 
findings with existing studies in isolation, without a clear understanding 
of how representative these studies were of the overall empirical data. 
Our article provides aggregated metrics, allowing for an examination of 
the means, standard deviations and effect sizes of RCTs and effectiveness

Additionally, the following benchmarks for DBT skills for adults in 
outpatient settings should be considered: BSL (d+ = 0.896; CV = 0.62); 
DERS (d+ = 1.489; CV = 88.74). 

Fewer  studies  were  retrieved  with  adolescents,  allowing  only  for 
aggregated benchmarks for standard DBT (full-programme) for BSL (d+

It is important to take into consideration that, unlike the DERS and 
BSL, which are measures with a normal distribution, in the case of EQ- 
5D  utility  score,  mean  scores  and  effect  sizes  need  to  be  considered 
with  caution,  and  a  usable  critical  value  was  not  possible  to  retrieve 
using the calculation proposed by Minami et al. (2008).

treatment is offered under tightly controlled conditions. Even so, clini-
cians should not be dissuaded from striving to attain results similar to 
those  achieved  in  RCTs.  Clinicians  can  consider  these  benchmarks  as 
guidance,  considering  that  the  demographic  and  diagnostic  mix  (for 
example, baseline severity, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity) can 
vary widely across services. 

To develop more representative and generalisable benchmarks in the 
future,  establishing  a  further  body  of  research  using  common  in-
struments is a necessity, and we encourage researchers and DBT teams to 
use  the  instruments  suggested  in  this  article.  In  treatments  of  other 
mental  health  disorders,  there  has  already  been  an  effort  to  create  a 
unified protocol to assess the effects of given treatments (Allen et al., 
2008; Farchione et al., 2012). We believe this article makes a valuable 
contribution by supporting the systematic use of these instruments in the 
future. This, in turn, could facilitate a more consistent and standardised 
way of assessing DBT treatments, and their effectiveness. 

Limitations and future directions 

In the future, we hope to be able to provide peer benchmarks in the 
context of an ongoing project to benchmark teams delivering DBT across

The benchmarks established in this article offer several advantages 
when reflecting on DBT delivery for, and treatment of, people with BPD. 
Firstly, benchmarks provide a standardised framework for assessing and 
evaluating progress throughout the therapy process and help set clear 
and  measurable  therapeutic  aims.  Secondly,  establishing  benchmarks 
enables  regular  assessment  and  monitoring  of  client  progress.  By 
comparing outcomes against predetermined targets, therapists can more 
objectively  evaluate the  effectiveness  of  their  interventions, adjusting 
the  treatment  delivery  and  checking  their  adherence  to  the  model  if 
necessary, to deliver the best possible treatment. 

Results from effectiveness studies potentially align more closely with 
the clients that clinicians may encounter in routine practice, whereas 
RCTs  ideally  provide  benchmarks  for  when  the  highest  quality  of

ferences between routine practice and the provided benchmarks. 

Future RCTs and effectiveness studies should also seek to use an ITT 
approach and a standardised protocol to contribute to a common ground 
for  researchers  and  clinicians.  This  should  include  the  utilisation  of 
consistent assessment tools on a global scale. Such an approach greatly 
simplifies  the  subsequent  analysis  and  comparative  studies  and  is  a 
significant step towards benchmarking within the field of mental health. 
Furthermore,  looking  at  Devlin  et  al.  (2020)  chapter  explaining 
different  approaches  to  assess  clinically  significant  changes  using 
EQ-5D, we believe the use of an anchor measure for BPD, which could 
account  for  a  relevant  improvement  in  this  population,  could  inform 
what would be a significant change. Future studies should investigate 
the use of BSL-23 as a possible anchor measure along with EQ-5D, to 
detect what could be consider a Minimum Important Difference (MID). 
Pickard  et  al.  (2007)  suggested  using  half  of  a  standard  deviation  to 
calculate MID when using EQ-5D in a sample of cancer patients while 
selecting an anchor measure, and its methodology has been used in other 
clinical samples. 

In  terms  of  limitations,  the  studies  we  selected  showed  high  het-
erogeneity,  which  stresses  the  need to  be conservative in  our  conclu-
sions.  Moreover,  we  aggregated  results  from  studies  using  different 
methodologies (ITT and completers) in order to establish more repre-
sentative benchmarks, however, this comes at the cost of some level of 
accuracy  that  could  have  been  attained  with  a  more  homogeneous 
sample. Participants who did not complete a given study may be sys-
tematically  different  from  those  who  did,  their  exclusion  can  alter 
treatment effects, reducing the generalisability of the study’s findings. 
Benchmarks for adolescents were not possible to establish for the EQ- 
5D or DERS, because no studies were found using EQ-5D and only one 
study  used  DERS.  The  last  can  be  used  as  a  reference  but  not  as  a 
benchmark. In addition, we aggregated data from studies which inves-
tigated  programmes  of  different  lengths,  essentially  treating  them  as 
equal in terms of outcomes. Whilst in terms of clinical outcomes at the 
individual level this may be the case, it has a significant limitation. A 
programme  that  produces  the  same  effect  size  in  6  months  as  a  pro-
gramme that is twice the length is twice as productive in health eco-
nomic  terms  provided  other  things  remain  equal  (team  size  and 
training). As DBT is a team-based treatment arguably treating clinical 
outcomes at the individual level may not be the best approach, although 
it  is  the  approach  that  clinicians  are  most  familiar  with.  Few  of  the 
studies that we reviewed and included in this paper systematically re-
ported on ’team’ as a variable or reported on any potential clustering of 
outcomes  by  site  or  in  changes  in  outcome  during  the  study  due  to 
learning  effects  in  therapists,  making  it  impossible  for  us  to  develop 
benchmarks that incorporated a ’team’ factor. As we develop our peer- 
benchmarking platform we aim to address these important aspects of 
outcome  in routine  settings, in consultation with the  teams using the 
platform,  by  systematically  developing  team  ’productivity’  measures, 
that  incorporate  treatment  length,  team  resource  and  skill,  to  bench-
mark against. 

Conclusion 

To assist teams delivering DBT in routine practice and to evaluate the 
impact  of  a  national  training  programme  on  clinical  outcomes,  we 
searched  the  literature  to  compile  benchmarks  for  three  measures  of 
outcome: the EQ-5D measuring health-related quality of life; the BSL, 
measuring borderline symptoms; and the DERS measuring difficulties in 
emotion regulation. We were able to compile aggregated benchmarks 
for teams working with adults delivering both comprehensive DBT (BSL 
d+ = 0.824; CV = 0.67; DERS d+ = 1.423; CV = 81.10; EQ-5D d+ =
1.423; M = 0.71±0.2) and stand-alone skills training (BSL d+ = 0.896; 
CV  = 0.62;  DERS  d+ = 1.489;  CV  = 88.74).  Additionally,  for  teams 
delivering  DBT  full-programme  to  adolescents  with  BPD  features, 
benchmarks were provided for BSL (d+ = 0.800; CV = 0.48). 

A smaller  number of adolescent studies  with  higher  heterogeneity 
limited  the  development  of  definitive  benchmarks  for  all  the  in-
struments,  although  teams  can  still  use  the  findings  for  comparison. 
Subsequent  research  will  focus on  using  these  benchmarks  in  routine 
practice to support the development of a peer network focused on the 
improvement  of  clinical  outcomes  and  the  development  of  peer 
benchmarks.
