Abstract
Purpose of Review Chronic pain is a widespread public and physical health crisis, as it is one of the most common reasons adults seek
medical care and accounts for the largest medical reason for disability in the USA (Glombiewski et al., J Consult Clin Psychol. 86(6):533-
545, 2018; Schemer et al., Eur J Pain. 23(3):526-538, 2019). Chronic pain is associated with decreased functional status, opioid
dependence and substance abuse disorders, mental health crises, and overall lower perceived quality of life (Korff et al., J Pain.
17(10):1068-1080, 2016). For example, the leading cause of chronic pain and the leading cause of long-term disability is low back pain
(LBP) (Bjorck-van Dijken et al. J Rehabil Med. 40:864–9, 2008). Evidence suggests that persistent low back pain (pLBP) is a multidi-
mensional biopsychosocial problem with various contributing factors (Cherkin et al., JAMA. 315(12):1240-1249, 2016). Emotional
distress, pain-related fear, and protective movement behaviors are all unhelpful lifestyle factors that previously were more likely to go
unaddressed when assessing and treating patient discomfort (Pincus et al., Spine. 38:2118–23, 2013). Those that are not properly assisted
with these psychosocial issues are often unlikely to benefit from treatment in the primary care setting and thus are referred to multidis-
ciplinary pain rehabilitation physicians. This itself increases healthcare costs, and treatments can be invasive and have risks of their own.
Therefore, less expensive and more accessible management strategies targeting these psychosocial issues should be started to facilitate
improvement early. As a biopsychosocial disorder, chronic pain is influenced by a range of factors including lifestyle, mental health status,
familial culture, and socioeconomic status. Physicians have moved toward multi-modal pain approaches in order to combat this public
health dilemma, ranging from medications with several different mechanisms of action, lifestyle changes, procedural pain control, and
psychological interventions (Fashler et al., Pain Res Manag. 2016:5960987, 2016). Part of the rehabilitation process now more and more
commonly includes cognitive behavioral and cognitive functional therapy. Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) and cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) are both multidimensional psychological approaches to combat the mental portion of difficult pain control. While these
therapies are quite different in their approach, they lend to the idea that chronic pain can and should be targeted using coping mechanisms,
helping patients understand the pathophysiological process of pain, and altering behavior.
Recent Findings CFT differs from CBT functionally, as instead of improving managing/coping mechanisms of pain control from a
solely mental approach, CFT directly points out maladaptive behaviors and actively challenges the patient to change them in a
cognitively integrated, progressive overloading functional manner (Bjorck-van Dijken et al. J Rehabil Med. 40:864–9, 2008). This
allows CFT to be targeted to each individual patient, with the goal of personalized reconceptualization of the pain response. The end
goal is to overcome the barriers that prevent functional status improvement, a healthy lifestyle, and reaching their personal goals.
Summary Chronic pain is a major public health issue. Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) and cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) are both multidimensional psychological approaches to combat the mental portion of difficult pain control. While these
therapies are quite different in their approach, they lend to the idea that chronic pain can and should be targeted using coping
mechanisms, helping patients understand the pathophysiological process of pain, and altering behavior.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive behavioral therapy has many uses and has recently
been applied to patients with chronic pain in order to alter
thought patterns and coping mechanisms as a method of psy-
chotherapy [1(cid:129), 2]. Like CFT, CBT focuses on maladaptive
cognitions that contribute to emotional distress and functional
limitations that result from painful conditions. As a multimod-
al disorder, pain caused by tissue injury is modulated by the
cognitive maladaptation and emotional strain associated with
it. Previous studies have shown that CBT is effective for de-
pression, anxiety, stress, and chronic pain [3]. While not only
improving chronic pain scores, CBT has been shown to aid
functional life, as it has been reported to improve functional
status, fibromyalgia, and overall quality of life in addition to
changes in self-efficacy, social support, and overall view of
life control [4]. There is abundant evidence for the use of CBT
in the literature, so much so that multiple meta-analyses have
been conducted with frequently positive outcomes.

Chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis,
and chronic musculoskeletal pain are often the most common
disease patterns studied when implementing CBT. Results in
large-scale meta-analyses often show small to medium posi-
tive effect ranges. Specifically for fibromyalgia, Glombiewski
et al. showed that CBT was superior to other psychological
treatments for decreasing pain intensity [1(cid:129)]. Chronic fatigue
syndrome has also been shown to benefit in response to CBT,
as Malouff et al. revealed a medium effect size in post-
treatment fatigue for patients receiving cognitive behavioral
therapy against controls [5].

Some groups benefit more from CBT than others, as Pieh
et al. [6] described women benefiting more from multimodal
pain therapy with a specific focus on CBT-oriented programs
compared to their male counterparts. In addition, the Veteran
Affairs (VA) developed a project to increase the training and
delivery of CBT in their hospitals in 2015. Statistical analysis
on the results of this integration showed significant improve-
ments in pain catastrophizing, interference, and quality of life.
CBT has also been shown to be effective for those with
schizophrenia or those suffering from opiate addiction [7, 8].
With a promising outlook, more research must be done to
develop CBT and identify potential groups that would most
improve in order to increase treatment impact.

Cognitive Functional Therapy

As described above, CFT has a different approach when
attempting to alter the pain response. As a multidimensional
cognitive framework, an individual is interviewed and key

thought patterns and behavioral responses to pain are identi-
fied. Four main methods are employed to change the cognitive
and functional aspects of an individual’s response to pain,
namely “making sense of pain,” “functional integration,” “ex-
posure with control,” and “lifestyle change.” Each individual
pillar of the CFT method has a unique approach to combat
pain and improve healthy thought patterns. The data
supporting CFT is quite promising and reproducible. It has
shown long-term superior efficacy compared to manual ther-
apy, physical therapist-led exercise, and pharmacological in-
terventions. The key outcomes usually identified in studies
tend to stray away from the “pain scores” methodology of
rating pain, rather focusing on functional and lifestyle im-
provement [9, 10(cid:129), 11, 12]. Qualitative data and case studies
support that people benefiting from CFT report that they have
a changed mindset toward a more multidimensional under-
standing of their pain, experience increased pain controllabil-
ity, and enhanced self-efficacy about achieving functional and
lifestyle goals [11].

Making sense of pain often relies on the ability to self-reflect
and the willingness of the patient to put their pain into a story,
using words and metaphors to consolidate and recreate their jour-
ney in a processed form. This process challenges them to re-
evaluate their previously held beliefs about their pain and the
direction they are headed in regards to it. In a non-judgmental,
open manner, patients are assisted in identifying contextual factors,
unhelpful emotional and behavioral responses to pain, and any
cyclical elements that may be causing them to be unable to prog-
ress. Exposure with control is an essential component of behavior-
al change when challenging the pain response. Sympathetic re-
sponses to pain, safety behaviors, and functional tasks are targeted
during this portion of CFT, which allows individuals to understand
the feeling of pain and their physical response to it. As a result,
patients gradually adopt levels of conditioning to mechanical stim-
uli as time goes on, with the goal of ablating fear-avoidance beliefs
and behaviors. A reset of the mind when discussing previous
experiences that were deemed “painful” or “harmful” and
revisiting them after functional conditioning slowly allows patients
to become more active and get back to a more active lifestyle. Pain
flares are a result of returning to increased activity are an opportu-
nity to reinforce the new ways of thinking and responding to pain.
Avoidance of certain tasks or movements due to pain should be
addressed immediately as they occur.

These methodologies of CFT eventually lead to a lifestyle
change. Exercise programs, normalization of movement,
avoidance of sedentary behaviors, and regulating sleep cycles
are all implemented as pain is better understood and ad-
dressed. The scientific literature largely supports CFT in the
treatment of chronic pain, with most trials focusing on chronic
low back pain. One recent RCT showed CFT approaches are

more effective than combining manual therapy and exercise,
although the latter was still recommended as a multimodal
pain approach. Similar results have been reported in patients
with “high-risk” chronic pain, that is, patients with failure of
multiple other pain reduction modalities [13].

CFT has also led to greater reductions in disability compared
to group exercise and education intervention in those with chron-
ic low back pain [13]. Interestingly, the British Military published
a study in 2015 on CFT, as the most common reason for presen-
tation in their armed forces is low back pain. The UK Defense
Medical Rehabilitation Centre developed a CFT approach for
spinal rehabilitation in conjunction with the NIH. A prospective
observational study with 238 participants showed that there were
significant improvements in endurance (MSLT), range of mo-
tion, kinesiophobia, pain-related lifestyle interference (BPI-
Lifestyle), anxiety, and depression (p≤0.001) [12].

Future Directions

With a robust set of data, one can conclude that CBT and CFT
are exceptional therapeutic methods in improving chronic
pain or the overall well-being of our patients. With most of
the therapy being conversational or evaluative in nature and
the therapies themselves being tailorable to the individual, the
options for expanding and modified CBT and CFT are numer-
ous. One particularly interesting development is the creation
of internet-based therapies (iCBT or iCFT). Especially during
these times where the 2019 novel coronavirus has decimated
the world economy and greatly reduced the ability for many to
travel, a remote option for therapy in our chronic pain patients
is greatly needed. In addition, the World Health Organization
estimated that 34 million people suffering from major depres-
sive disorder go untreated in Europe and the Americas alone
[14]. Several studies support the use of iCBT for depression
and other psychiatric conditions. These programs and new-
age methodologies of healthcare and pain relief may help
address barriers that hinder access to effective treatment [14].
A growing movement in the world of pain is focused on in-
creasing functionality and mental status rather than focusing on
pain scores and numerical measures. Perception of pain has be-
come a major target of our clinical focus which aids in potentially
decreasing pharmacologic consumption, invasive procedures, and
unhealthy patient habits that may have led to chronic pain [15].
Future research should focus on these mechanisms of controlling
chronic pain, as we attempt to decrease our healthcare costs as a
country and community. In addition, more conditions should be
considered when implementing CBT and CFT, as these treatment
modalities consistently show positive effect sizes over several dif-
ferent disease mechanisms. Finally, there is a need for an updated,
universally accepted methodology to direct future research as pro-
vider to provider variability is an uncontrolled, possibly trouble-
some variable.
