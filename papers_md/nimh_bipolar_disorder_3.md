## What is bipolar disorder?


Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental illness that causes clear shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. People with bipolar disorder often experience periods of extremely “up,” elated, irritable, or energized behavior (known as manic episodes) and very “down,” sad, indifferent, or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes).

## Why is NIMH studying bipolar disorder?


The symptoms of bipolar disorder can impose serious challenges to a person’s mental and physical health. People with bipolar disorder often have other mental disorders, and some people may experience symptoms ofpsychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions. The symptoms can interfere with everyday activities, relationships, and work or school responsibilities. Some people may also experience stigma related to their symptoms, which can keep them from seeking the help they need.

Bipolar disorder usually requires lifelong treatment, but an effective treatment plan can help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.


## How is NIMH research addressing this critical topic?


NIMH supports research to understand the biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to bipolar disorder. This research includes studies examining how different factors influence when bipolar disorder symptoms appear and how they change over time. Other research focuses on identifying patterns in brain activity that could help predict and track symptom progression.

NIMH also supports research to improve treatments for people with bipolar disorder. This includes research to better understand the relationship between bipolar disorder and co-occurring conditions, likeanxiety disordersandsubstance use disorders. Understanding the relationship between these conditions could lead to more effective treatment approaches.
