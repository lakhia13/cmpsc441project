The positive psychology movement, launched near the start of the twenty-ﬁrst century,
aimed to shift the focus of psychology away from misery, conﬂict, and pathology toward
happiness, human ﬂourishing, and wellbeing. However, there have been few attempts
to gauge whether psychology as a whole has become more positive in its focus. This
study tested this possibility by examining a corpus of 829,701 abstracts from articles
published in 875 psychology journals between 1970 and 2017. Positivity was indexed
by the positive emotion dictionary using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count tool and
a newly constructed positive character dictionary. Both indices showed a steep rise
through the study period, with the positive character index’s rise occurring since 2000.
A Negative Emotion index also rose linearly over the study period, suggesting that the
rise in positive emotion might reﬂect in part a general increase in affective or evaluative
language use. While there appears to have been an increase in psychology’s positivity,
that increase is complex, non-linear, and the degree to which it can be ascribed to positive
psychology remains uncertain.

INTRODUCTION

The positive psychology movement arose at the dawn of the new millennium and set itself the
ambitious goal of changing psychology’s focus. Its early proponents argued that while psychology
may have initially started as a neutral ﬁeld, its emphasis on examining the negative aspects of human
nature introduced a focus on negative over positive topics. While acknowledging the importance of
studying negative phenomena, such as psychopathology, prejudice, and the roots of social conﬂict,
pioneers of the movement argued that psychology was failing to produce enough knowledge to
understand what makes life worth living (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2014). To rectify this
imbalance, the positive psychology movement aimed to promote an increased focus on human
strengths and virtues and began emphasizing research on topics such as gratitude, happiness,
resiliency, and wellbeing.

Martin Seligman’s 1998 Presidential Address to the American Psychological Association
(Seligman, 1998) made the mission of positive psychology clear. He called for the establishment
of positively focused journals to correct psychology’s disproportionate negative focus with a
new emphasis on positive emotion and character strengths - that is, psychological processes
or mechanisms that deﬁne and provide ways to display virtues (Peterson and Seligman, 2004).
Peterson and Seligman (2004) even compiled a handbook of character strengths and virtues as
a counterpoint to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Since its inception, positive psychology has grown

rapidly as a ﬁeld, developing lines of research on character,
happiness, hope, human ﬂourishing, and wellbeing in a wide
variety of contexts, from clinics to schools to work organizations.
To the extent that this work has been inﬂuential, the content of
psychology research should have shifted in a positive direction in
the past two decades.

However, whether such a broad shift has taken place has
yet to be determined, and there are reasons to question it. The
expansive discipline of psychology may render the inﬂuence of
positive psychology limited to speciﬁc subdisciplines and thus be
small in magnitude. In addition, it can be argued that psychology
did not entirely neglect themes of positive human functioning
before the advent of positive psychology. James (1902) was
writing on “healthy mindedness” one century earlier, and Gable
and Haidt (2005) document how literature on such phenomena
as curiosity,
forgiveness, hope, and laughter existed before
positive psychology was launched. Writers in the humanistic
psychology tradition,
in particular, shared with the positive
psychology an emphasis on positive human characteristics
(Allport, 1995), the fully functioning person (Rogers, 1961),
self-actualization, and the study of healthy individuals (Maslow,
1968). If positive phenomena were featuring in psychology before
the rise of positive psychology, the latter’s impact on the ﬁeld’s
focus might be modest.

Research exploring these trends has found limited evidence
that psychology has become more positive over time and
suggested that the culture at large may have become less positive
in some domains. Kesebir and Kesebir (2012) found a decrease in
the use of general and speciﬁc terms related to moral virtues over
the course of the twentieth century in the Google Books corpus,
revealing historical trends in the cultural salience of positive
it remains to be determined
moral concepts. Nevertheless,
whether similar historical trends are found within the discourse
of academic psychology and whether such trends can be observed
in relation to positive phenomena beyond moral virtues, such as
positive emotions.

Several studies have examined trends in emotion categories
within everyday and academic language. Using the emotion-
related dictionaries of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
software (LIWC; Pennebaker et al., 2015), DeWall et al.
(2011) found a decline in the frequency of positive emotion
terms and a rise in negative emotion terms in the most
popular American songs from 1980 to 2007. Focusing instead
on academic psychology, but again using LIWC’s emotion
dictionaries, Sell and Farreras (2017) analyzed 66 introductory
psychology textbooks published from the 1890s to the 1990s and
found a gradual decline in the use of emotionally toned language.
In contrast, Vinkers et al.’s (2015) analysis of abstracts published
between 1974 and 2014 across multiple scientiﬁc ﬁelds revealed
an overall rise in the usage of positive and negative words. These
ﬁndings indicate that emotion categories may display diﬀerent
historical trajectories depending on the context in which they
are examined.

Text corpus-based “culturomic” methods (Michel et al., 2011)
have been used to address historical trends within psychology
and cognate ﬁelds. For instance, researchers used the Google
Books corpus to explore the rise and fall of psychoanalytic

concepts (Haslam and Ye, 2019) and moral foundations (Wheeler
et al., 2019) over time. Vylomova et al. (2019) documented the
increases in the relative frequency of harm-related concepts in
psychology article abstracts over the past half century. Research
of this kind can track shifts in the salience of speciﬁc concepts
or thematic groups of concepts within psychology, indexed by
changes in the relative frequency of pre-deﬁned word sets in
massive historical text corpora. This makes it an optimal but
as yet untapped method to evaluate whether and when any
shifts in the overall positivity of academic psychological discourse
have occurred.

This study evaluates whether academic psychology has
become more positive in focus in recent decades, as indicated
by the rising relative frequency of positive words in a massive
corpus of journal article abstracts over the period 1970–2017.
Such a trend would be consistent with the possibility that
positive psychology has had a substantial impact on the ﬁeld of
psychology as a whole, especially if the rise begins or accelerates
around the turn of the millennium. This investigation indexes
positivity in the following two distinct ways: (1) The relative
frequency of positive sentiment-related terms in the abstracts,
using the established LIWC positive emotions dictionary and
(2) the relative frequency of a new dictionary of positive
character-related terms, representing a moral or ethical sense
of positivity rather than the aﬀective sense captured by the
emotions index. We hypothesize that both indices of positivity
(Positive Emotion and Positive Character) would increase over
the period examined.

METHOD

Materials
Psychology Corpus
To examine positivity trends in academic psychology, we used
a massive corpus of psychology abstracts, ﬁrst described in
Vylomova et al. (2019). The corpus comprised abstracts from
journals in the ﬁeld of psychology, collected from E-Research
and PubMed databases, covering the period 1970–2017, and
represents a substantial majority of English-language psychology
articles published in this period. Abstracts were selected for study
because they distill the essential contributions, ﬁndings, and ideas
of a research paper (Cleveland and Cleveland, 1983). Abstracts
have also been successfully used as relevant sources of text to
research historical trends in scientiﬁc research (Swales and Feak,
2010; Vinkers et al., 2015).

Researchers developed the corpus in 2017 by downloading the
baseline database from PubMed which contained metadata for
over 25 million abstracts across the health sciences. They then
used ISSN numbers for 1,095 journals tagged as “Psychology” in
the SClmago database to ﬁlter PubMed for matches and extracted
entries for 570,857 articles from 758 of the identiﬁed psychology
journals; 439,499 (77%) contained abstracts. After removing
abstracts with copyright notices, corrections, retractions, and
those containing less than 85 characters, there remained 428,936
abstracts published in the period 1975–2017. Researchers then
used the Crossref text mining application programming interface
(API) to gather meta-data for the same set of 1,095 journals by

Has Psychology Become More Positive?

using ISSN numbers and following Crossref links to available
abstracts. This procedure yielded 740,955 abstracts from 803
Psychology tagged journals beginning in 1930, resulting in
718,512 abstracts after removing book reviews, copyright notices,
editorials, and non-English abstracts. The two sets of abstracts
were then merged, after which the identical duplicates were
removed by matching abstracts with formatting diﬀerences found
using Levenstein’s distance metric. This compilation process left
a merged corpus of 871,340 distinct abstracts from 875 journals.
Only the 829,701 abstracts published in 1970–2017 were used in
the present analysis.

The corpus was pre-processed into an analyzable format by
lower-casing letters and removing punctuation. We used the
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker et al.,
2015) software program to compute our variables. LIWC counts
the word frequencies of pre-programmed and custom-made
“dictionaries” (i.e., sets of phrases, terms, and word stems) in
text corpora, and returns percentages of words in a corpus that
represents each dictionary.

Dictionary Development
To assess aﬀective (sentiment-related) positivity, we used the
LIWC 2015 “Positive Emotion” dictionary, which contains 620
words (e.g., “happy”), word stems (e.g., “positivi∗”), and word
phrases [e.g., “(will) like”]. The asterisk in the word stem
items instructs LIWC to ignore successive letters of possible
words to capture all word forms based on a base form or
word stem, whereby the uniquely inﬂected word form is
treated as a single item. This dictionary has previously been
shown to have the internal consistency reliabilities of 0.23
(corrected Spearman Brown’s alpha) and 0.64 (uncorrected
Cronbach’s alpha) (Pennebaker et al., 2015). We also computed
the corresponding LIWC 2015 “Negative Emotion” index,
which uses a dictionary comprising 744 words (e.g., “hurt,”
“nasty,” and “ugly”), and word stems (e.g., “aggravate∗”).
It demonstrates the internal consistency reliabilities of 0.55
(corrected Spearman Brown’s alpha) and 0.17 (uncorrected
Cronbach’s alpha) (Pennebaker et al., 2015).

To assess character-related positivity, we created a custom
dictionary. First, we developed a set of terms distinctive to
positive character, drawn from Peterson and Seligman’s (2004)
handbook of character strengths and virtues. All terms were
examined as nouns only (i.e., no other morphological variants
such as adjectives) because character strengths are usually
presented as names for virtues, and this was the focus of
our positive character dictionary. The initial set of 32 one- to
three-word terms contained the labels of the six proposed core
virtues (e.g., “courage” and “humanity”) and their 26 component
character strengths (e.g., “integrity” and “kindness”). These 32
terms were then independently judged by three authors on
the following exclusion criterion: “Exclude any term used in
psychology in a manner not referring to a character strength
or virtue (i.e., as a positively valued individual diﬀerence
variable).” Nine terms were recommended for exclusion by
a majority of the judges: “beauty”, “citizenship”, “curiosity”,
“fairness”, “humanity”, “innovation”, “love”, “perspective”, and
“temperance”. These terms were excluded because they were

to be used exclusively to refer to character
attributes. For example, “beauty” commonly refers to the
esthetic appreciation of objects, “perspective” often refers to an
intellectual standpoint rather than a kind of wisdom, “fairness”
often refers to a distribution of resources rather than a quality of a
fair-minded person, and “citizenship” often refers to an objective
demographic fact about a person rather than a set of civic virtues.
This left a ﬁnal Positive Character dictionary of 23 terms as
displayed in Table 1. It demonstrated a split-half reliability of
0.41, based on using Spearman Brown’s correction applied to the
median 0.26 correlation between randomly selected halves of the
positive character terms.

Measures
The LIWC Positive Emotion and Negative Emotion indices
represent the summed relative frequency of the words in the
respective dictionaries in each year from 1970 to 2017 (i.e., the
summed count of the positive or negative word set in each year
divided by the total number of words in abstracts from that year).
The Positive Character index, albeit distinct from the emotion-
based sentiment indices, was generated in the same way: The new
custom-made dictionary of 23 terms was inputted into LIWC to
compute the annual relative frequency of the positive character
words as a proportion of all words in that year of the corpus. The
Positive Character dictionary ﬁle for input into LIWC and the
indices output for all dictionaries are publicly available at https://

Emotion index rises from 1.65 in 1970 to 2.44 in 2017, a relative
increase of 48%. Scores on the index correlate 0.95, 95% CI (0.92,
0.97), with year (p < 0.001), supporting our hypothesis that
positive sentiment will increase over the study period. However,
the activity observed in the Negative Emotion index shows a
similar increase, rising from 1.61 in 1970 to 2.27 in 2017, a
relative increase of 41% [r(46) = 0.93, 95% CI (0.87, 0.96), p
< 0.001]. Therefore, rather than a unique increase for positive
emotions, there appears to have been a generalized increase in
emotion-related language in the abstracts over the study period.
However, Figure 1 indicates that the respective time series diﬀer
in the timing of their increases. The Positive Emotion index rises
steadily with a subtle acceleration since the late 1990s, whereas
the Negative Emotion index rises steeply in the 1980s, although it
remains relatively stable in the ﬁnal two decades of the series.

The time series of the Positive Character index is presented
in Figure 2. It shows that the positive character terms appeared
infrequently but rose steeply from the late 1990s to the end of the
period. The index correlated strongly with year [r(46) = 0.82, 95%
CI (0.69, 0.89), p < 0.001], again consistent with our hypothesis
that positive character will also increase over the study period.

These diﬀerential patterns are clariﬁed by Figure 3 which
presents the ratio of the two indices (Positive Emotion/Negative
Emotion). Positive Emotion outweighs Negative Emotion from
1970 to the mid-1980s, after which the pattern reverses until the
late 1990s. Subsequently, the index demonstrates a substantial
upward trend, pointing to a steeper rise in positive emotion terms
over negative emotion terms in the abstracts.

To validate the two positivity indices, we assessed whether
they were elevated in abstracts of the positive psychology articles.
Abstracts from all articles published in the prominent Journal of
Positive Psychology (2006–2017) were extracted from the corpus,
and LIWC was used to compute their Positive Emotion and
Positive Character indices. As expected, the mean annual Positive
Emotion index value for the positive psychology abstracts (6.96)
was much higher than for the corpus as a whole (1.92) or for
the corpus during the same 2006–2017 period (2.19). Likewise,
the mean Positive Character index for the positive psychology
abstracts (1.03) noticeably exceeded the index for the whole
corpus (0.04) or for the equivalent period of the whole corpus
(0.06). These ﬁndings that the LIWC Positive Emotion and
Positive Character indices were more than three times and 17
times higher, respectively, in the positive psychology abstracts
than in all abstracts, strongly supports their validity as indices of
positivity in this study.

DISCUSSION

Our analysis of the abstracts of nearly one million psychology
journal articles oﬀers qualiﬁed support
for our hypotheses
and provides clues to why and when the rising positivity of
psychology may have occurred. The Positive Emotion index was
based on a massive, broad, and well-validated LIWC dictionary
of positively evaluated terms, and the Positive Character index
was newly constructed using character strengths and virtues that
represent a moral and ethical sense of positivity. In support of

our hypotheses, both indices demonstrated a substantial rise in
psychology abstracts over the study period, from 1970 to 2017.

On our ﬁrst hypothesis, the substantial increase in positive
sentiment-related terms over the study period appears to oﬀer
strong support for our prediction that positive emotion has
increased in psychology. However, that support is qualiﬁed by
the almost equally substantial rise in the Negative Emotion
index. One interpretation of this pattern of ﬁndings is that,
in recent decades, psychology research has tended to focus
on emotion and evaluation more than in earlier decades,
perhaps due in part to the rise of aﬀective science (Dukes
et al., 2021). An alternative interpretation is that the pattern
reﬂects stylistic changes in psychology writing, perhaps speciﬁc
to abstracts, in which more expressive language has become
acceptable, desirable, or expected. For instance, Wheeler et al.
(2021) demonstrated a rise in informal writing within academic
psychology abstracts. Although this second interpretation runs
counter to the decreased use of emotionally toned words found
in psychology textbooks by Sell and Farreras (2017), it may be
consistent with the increased use of both positive and negative
words in the scientiﬁc abstracts from 1970 to 2014 documented
by Vinkers et al. (2015). In either case, the ﬁndings indicate that
the rising emotional positivity in psychology abstracts in recent
years may be more consistent with a rise in emotionality than
with a distinctive rise in positivity.

The ﬁndings related to our second hypothesis, based on our
new Positive Character index, are less ambiguous. The index,
representing a moral and ethical sense of positivity, demonstrated
a steep overall rise from 1970 to 2017. There was clear evidence
that the 23 terms had increased substantially in their prevalence
in more recent psychology abstracts, oﬀ a low base. This pattern is
in marked contrast to the decline in the use of character terms in
the Google Books corpus found by Kesebir and Kesebir (2012). By
implication, the growth of positivity in psychology abstracts may
be more evident when positivity is conceptualized in a relatively
narrow moral or normative sense rather than it being understood
as a broad semantic domain of positive evaluation and emotion.
If positive psychology has indeed played a role in the growing
representation of positive concepts in psychology abstracts, that
role may be stronger for character-related positivity than for
emotion-related positivity. It could be argued that by using a
dictionary grounded in positive psychology, we may have tipped
the scales in favor of the predicted rise in positive character
terms. However, as the terms are well-established English words
rather than new coinages by positive psychologists, and articles
that directly examine the VIA taxonomy (Peterson and Seligman,
2004) are rare, we believe this critique is not a fatal one. Although
the dictionary is novel and small, compared to the LIWC
emotion-related dictionaries, it has excellent content validity
through its inclusion in Peterson and Seligman (2004) established
account of character strengths and virtues.

The descriptive approach taken by our research does not
allow us to test whether the positive psychology movement is
responsible for any changes in the salience of positive emotion
or character in the corpus of psychology abstracts. Rather than
directly testing the causal impact of the positive psychology
movement, we merely tested whether a rise in positivity,

consistent with such an impact, has occurred. With these caveats
in mind, we can speculate on how temporal patterns in the data
are or are not compatible with positive psychology’s potential
inﬂuence. Two trends are consistent with that inﬂuence. First,
the Positive Character index shows a steep rise beginning around
1998, around when the positive psychology movement launched.
Second, the Positive Emotion index rises more steeply after
2000 than before. That trend is sharpened when the ratio of
Positive to Negative Emotion is considered. Contrary to the
view that psychology was biased away from positive phenomena
before positive psychology’s emergence, a clear rise in relative
positivity starts in 1999, albeit one that returns the ratio to
levels that prevailed in the 1970s. It is uncertain how much the
earlier peak of positivity reﬂected the inﬂuence of humanistic
psychologists, and how much the relative lack of focus on
negative emotion before the growth of clinical psychology as a
robust profession and an academic ﬁeld of study into the 1980s
(Benjamin, 2005). When considering that academic psychology is
mostly neutral (Gable and Haidt, 2005), it is plausible that speciﬁc
movements within psychology have inﬂuenced ﬂuctuations in its
aﬀective temperature.

Study Limitations
The present research has some limitations. First, although
the abstracts provide dense and standardized summaries of
psychological research, they may not be the ideal medium
for assessing the overall positivity or focus of that research.
Abstracts combine neutral reporting on concepts, ﬁndings, and

methods with an advertising function, and their stylistic aspects,
and requirements may distort the assessment of their content
focus (Wheeler et al., 2021). A more comprehensive assessment
might employ full article texts, although this is prohibitively
diﬃcult due to copyright restrictions. Furthermore, the Positive
Emotion and Negative Emotion dictionaries could be partitioned
into their components (e.g., disappointment and happiness) to
represent the various dimensions present in emotion. Second,
our analysis combined abstracts published in a particular year
into a single text for the purposes of analysis, and future
research might explore changes in language use at the individual
abstract level (e.g., examining proportions of abstracts containing
positive language)—taking care to compute precision and recall
estimates. Third, the new Positive Character dictionary is small
and has yet to be thoroughly validated; therefore, the ﬁndings
based on it must be regarded as provisional. An expanded
dictionary that is not directly based on positive psychology
models of the structure of virtues and character strengths
might also be preferable, potentially combining work from
other researchers (e.g., Buckingham and Clifton, 2001) and
stoic philosophers (Sherman, 2021), and parts of speech other
than nouns might also be included. Fourth, our analyses do
not allow us to answer causal questions about
the extent
to which positive psychology is responsible for changes in
the positivity of psychology as a whole. Such questions are
challenging to address, not least because it is diﬃcult to isolate
a new ﬁeld of study as a causal inﬂuence in big data analyses
while controlling for other possible factors. For instance, it is
diﬃcult to control for the linguistic positivity bias, which holds

that people tend to use positive language more than negative
language (Kloumann et al., 2012; Iliev et al., 2016), and the
negativity bias purportedly instilled by clinical psychology’s focus
on disorder and disease (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2014).
Future research may begin to investigate whether particular
movements have inﬂuenced trends revealed by the positivity
indices used in this study by replicating their patterns in clinical
and positive psychology journals, and journals representing
other areas of psychology and comparing their trajectories.
Articles within the corpus might be grouped by relevant journals,
providing the opportunity for a text-by-text analysis of indices
within areas of psychology (e.g., analysis of article abstracts
within positive psychology journals to represent the positive
psychology movement). Finally, although word count-based
approaches to studying change in text corpora are popular
and often revealing, it is important to acknowledge that word
counts fail
in word
usage (Enﬁeld, 2014). Future research might employ machine
learning techniques that take linguistic context into account
(e.g., where the positivity indices contain thorough information
about the context of word occurrences, including hedging or
negation; Enríquez et al., 2016).

to capture the importance of context

similar in magnitude to a rise in negative emotion. Although
this pattern may represent a general rise in attention to emotion
and evaluation within psychology, rather than a speciﬁcally
positive shift, there is some evidence of a subtle swing toward
positivity at around the time when positive psychology was
founded. Whether positive psychology can be credited for these
subtle changes in the ﬁeld of psychology as a whole remains to
be determined.

CONCLUSION

FUNDING

In conclusion, our study oﬀers the ﬁrst evidence that the
discourse of academic psychology, at least as represented in the
abstracts of journal articles, has become, in some respects, more
positive over the past 50 years. When positivity is understood in
a moral sense, as virtue and character, there has been an upsurge
in attention within the literature beginning around the turn of
the last century. When positivity is understood in a broader and
more aﬀective sense, there has been a more gradual rise that is
