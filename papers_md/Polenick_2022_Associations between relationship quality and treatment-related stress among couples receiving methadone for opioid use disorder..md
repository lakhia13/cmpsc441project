Abstract

Background: Social relationships may buffer or exacerbate stress among patients receiving 
methadone treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Little is known, however, about how 
relationship quality is linked to treatment-related stress among couples in which both partners 
receive methadone. We considered the links between relationship quality and treatment-related 
stress among couples in methadone treatment for OUD.

Methods: Participants for this cross-sectional observational study included 60 heterosexual 
married or cohabiting couples aged 18 and older drawn from two opioid treatment programs 
in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Both partners completed a self-administered survey which 
assessed their sociodemographic information, relationship and treatment characteristics, and 
perceived treatment-related stress. We estimated actor-partner interdependence models to evaluate 
the links between each partner’s perceptions of relationship quality (with their partner and their 
closest family member or friend) and treatment-related stress.

Results: When their partners reported a more positive partner relationship, women had lower 
treatment-related stress. When women reported a more positive relationship with their own closest 
family member or friend, both women and their partners had lower treatment-related stress. 
When men perceived a more positive relationship with their closest family member or friend, 
their partners reported greater treatment-related stress. Negative relationship quality was not 
significantly linked to treatment-related stress.

Introduction

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a critical public health concern in the United States. 
Methadone delivered through opioid treatment programs is a common medication for 
opioid use disorder. Methadone treatment improves health and reduces mortality (Sordo 
et al., 2017; Ward et al., 1999) but it can be stressful due to frequent clinic visits for 
methadone dispensing, regular toxicology screenings, and a high level of persistence needed 
to remain in treatment (Amato et al., 2015; Fei et al., 2016). It is well established that 
social relationships can buffer or exacerbate stress in various contexts including substance 
use disorder treatment (Hostinar, 2015; Ruisoto & Contador, 2019). Yet little is known 
about the role of social relationships in perceptions of stress during methadone treatment for 
OUD. Given that greater perceived stress during treatment has been associated with adverse 
outcomes including increased drug craving (Ilgen et al., 2008; Preston & Epstein, 2011; 
Preston et al., 2017; Preston et al, 2018) and early dropout (Jaremko et al., 2015; Panlilio et 
al., 2019), understanding how social relationships are linked to treatment-related stress may 
inform the clinical care of patients receiving methadone.

Patients in methadone treatment for OUD commonly have a spouse or romantic partner 
with a current or past history of substance use (e.g., Grella et al., 2003; Puigdollers et 
al., 2004; Riehman et al., 2003). When both partners receive methadone at the same time, 
this might be especially stressful because they may differ in their motivation for recovery, 
willingness to change mutually enabling patterns, and ability to remain drug-free (Cavacuiti, 
2004; Simmons & McMahon, 2012; Simmons & Singer, 2006). Partners’ shared stressors 
related to methadone treatment may also impact their coping behaviors and relationship 
functioning (Rusu et al., 2020). Consequently, both partners’ perceptions of the quality of 
their relationship and other close relationships may play a part in shaping the experience 
of treatment-related stress. We evaluated associations between relationship quality and 
perceived treatment-related stress in a sample of heterosexual couples in which both partners 
received methadone for OUD. We considered each member of the couple’s reports of 
relationship quality with their partner and their closest family member or friend.

Partner relationships may be associated with treatment-related stress among couples 
receiving methadone for several reasons. In line with interdependence theory (Rusbult 
& Van Lange, 2008), members of a couple influence one another’s thoughts, feelings, 
and behaviors. Partners often show similarity in their opioid use (Gogineni et al., 2001; 
Polenick et al., 2021; Powers & Anglin, 1996) and in their methadone doses (Huang et al., 
2018) that may facilitate collaborative coping or amplify strain during treatment. Opioid 
use and treatment may also have a negative impact on the emotional well-being of both

partners (Wittenberg et al., 2016). In addition, sexual dysfunction is a common side effect 
of methadone that can have detrimental implications for the partner relationship (Teoh et al., 
2017; Xia et al., 2013; Yee et al., 2016). With this interdependence, the nature and quality 
of couple interactions might be key factors in treatment experiences. For instance, greater 
relationship closeness has been associated with a lower percentage of cocaine-positive and 
heroin-positive urine samples over a 35-week period among married individuals in treatment 
(Heinz et al., 2009). A study of heterosexual couples in which both partners received 
methadone for OUD similarly found that when women reported more positive partner 
relationship quality, they had a lower risk of nonmedical prescription opioid use and their 
partners had a lower risk of street opioid use (Polenick et al., 2021). By contrast, negative 
partner interactions such as arguments about drug use or its consequences may be a common 
source of strain during treatment (Cavacuiti, 2004; Simmons & McMahon, 2012; Simmons 
& Singer, 2006). Collectively, this research suggests that both partners’ views of positive and 
negative partner relationship quality may be linked to treatment-related stress among couples 
receiving methadone.

Other close relationships may also be linked to treatment-related stress during methadone 
treatment for OUD. Having a social network member who can provide emotional support 
and having a close relationship with a social network member are associated with lower 
odds of heroin use in methadone treatment (Shen et al., 2018). Patients receiving methadone 
who have better family relationships and greater social support also report better quality of 
life and are more likely to remain abstinent from drugs (Cavaiola et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 
2017). Moreover, patients with family members who are supportive of methadone treatment 
are less likely to use heroin (Feng et al., 2018). Patients with more negative relationships, 
however, have been found to show poorer outcomes. For example, having more family 
problems is linked to concurrent heroin use (Feng et al., 2018) and greater family criticism 
is associated with higher depressive symptoms and shorter treatment retention (Lee et 
al., 2015). Additionally, patients receiving methadone frequently have one or more social 
network members who use drugs and may be unsupportive of methadone treatment (Day et 
al., 2013; Feng et al., 2018; Gogineni et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2018), potentially intensifying 
stress. Hence, among couples receiving methadone, both partners’ views of positive and 
negative relationship quality with their closest family member or friend may be associated 
with treatment-related stress. Relationships with close others may serve as a joint resource 
that buffers stress for the couple and/or a shared strain that magnifies treatment-related 
stress.

To optimize clinical care and interventions, it is important to understand gender differences 
in the links between relationship quality and treatment-related stress among couples 
receiving methadone. Relative to men, women usually experience greater emotional strain 
from interpersonal problems (Birditt & Fingerman, 2003; Mohr et al., 2003), are more 
likely to report arguments during stressful events when in OUD treatment (Moran et al., 
2018), and rely more on social support to cope with stress in the context of substance 
use (Bonin et al., 2000). Women receiving methadone also typically report greater job 
instability, more interpersonal barriers to treatment (e.g., inadequate family support), and 
greater comorbidity (e.g., Bawor et al., 2015; Grella et al., 2003; Puigdollers et al., 2004; 
Riehman et al., 2003; Vigna-Taglianti et al., 2016). Furthermore, among women but not

men, loneliness has been reported as a major reason for return to substance use (Levy, 2008) 
and is associated with higher odds of illicit opioid use during methadone treatment (Polenick 
et al., 2019). Considering the heightened vulnerabilities and centrality of social support in 
managing stress among women, it is plausible that both partners’ perceived relationship 
quality with partners and closest family members or friends are more strongly linked to 
women’s treatment-related stress.

This study builds on the literature by evaluating the associations between relationship 
quality and treatment-related stress in a sample of heterosexual couples in which both 
partners received methadone for OUD. We hypothesized that both own and partner reports 
of higher positive partner relationship quality and higher positive relationship quality with 
closest family members or friends would be linked to lower treatment-related stress, whereas 
own and partner reports of higher negative partner relationship quality and higher negative 
relationship quality with closest family members or friends would be linked to greater 
treatment-related stress. We further predicted that these associations would be stronger for 
women than men.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Sample and Procedures

The sample included 144 patients who were recruited from two large opioid treatment 
programs in Rhode Island (n = 84) and Massachusetts (n = 60). In these programs, all 
patients received at least one group, individual, or couple therapy in addition to methadone. 
Clinical staff assisted recruiting individuals and their partners aged 18 and older who were 
currently married or cohabiting (i.e., 72 patient dyads). Both partners generally came in 
together for methadone dosing. Clinicians shared fliers with couples who were interested 
in the study. Response rates were not collected for this convenience sample; however, 
we estimate that at least 80% of these couples agreed to participate. Couples in which 
both partners currently received methadone for OUD and consented to participate were 
enrolled. Individuals were excluded if they were under age 18 or not fluent in English. 
Participating partners completed an in-person self-administered questionnaire during their 
scheduled clinic visits. An informed consent document was included with each survey. 
Couples completed the surveys at the same time in separate rooms and both partners 
were asked to keep their responses confidential. Survey completion was monitored by the 
principal investigator (B.P.C.). The survey did not include any identifying information. Upon 
completion of the survey, each participant was given a $20.00 gift card as an honorarium. 
The survey took an average of 20-30 minutes to complete. This study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of the University of Rhode Island.

We removed six individuals in three same-sex couples because their small number precluded 
a meaningful comparison with heterosexual couples and because this paper was focused on 
gender differences within couples. Of the remaining 138 individuals in 69 couples, there 
were nine in which one or both partners had missing data on study variables. The final 
analytic sample included 120 individuals in 60 couples with complete data (see Table 1). 
Relative to those who were removed due to missing data, individuals in this study did not 
significantly differ in their sociodemographic characteristics or scores on study variables.

2.2.  Measures

Page 5

2.2.1.  Treatment-related stress.—Participants were asked: “How stressful is [your/
your partner's] methadone treatment?” Responses ranged from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very 
much). Single-item measures are not ideal; however, previous studies have found that single-
item measures of stress are linked to outcomes including drug craving and exposure to 
drug-use triggers (e.g., Ilgen et al., 2008; Moran et al., 2018; Preston & Epstein, 2011), and 
prior research has shown that single-item measures of psychosocial stress produce responses 
with good reliability and validity (e.g., Arapovic-Johansson et al., 2017; Littman et al., 
2006).

2.2.2.  Relationship quality.—Participants were separately asked about their 
relationship with (a) their partner; and (b) their closest family member or friend after 
reporting who they felt closest to other than their partner. Positive relationship quality was 
assessed with three items. On a scale from 1 (a lot) to 4 (not at all), participants reported 
the extent to which their partner/closest family member or friend: really understands the way 
they feel about things; can be relied upon if they have a serious problem; and can be opened 
up to if they need to talk about their worries. We measured negative relationship quality 
with four items. On a scale from 1 (a lot) to 4 (not at all), participants reported how much 
their partner/closest family member or friend: makes too many demands on them; criticizes 
them; lets them down when counted upon; and gets on their nerves. Prior research has found 
that similar relationship quality items produce valid and reliable responses (Bertera, 2005; 
Schuster et al., 1990; Walen & Lachman, 2000). The items were reverse coded and averaged 
so that higher scores represented greater positive relationship quality (women: α = .77 for 
partner and α = .86 for closest family member/friend; men: α = .70 for partner and α = 
.81 for closest family member/friend) and negative relationship quality (women: α = .87 for 
partner and α = .82 for closest family member/friend; men: α = .74 for partner and α = .88 
for closest family member/friend).

2.2.3.  Covariates.—We controlled for two partner relationship characteristics: 
relationship type (1 = married, −1 = cohabiting) and duration (1 = 5 years or longer, 
−1 = less than 5 years). In post hoc tests, we also controlled for worries about own and 
partner substance use, methadone treatment duration, and risk of nonmedical prescription 
and street opioid use. Participants were asked: “How much do you worry that you will 
abuse substances?” and “How much do you worry that your partner will abuse substances?” 
Responses ranged from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). To account for differences in 
treatment-related stress among patients who have been in treatment long enough to be 
stable on methadone versus those who have not (Ward et al., 1998), we considered whether 
patients received methadone treatment for two or more years (1 = 2 years or more, −1 = 
less than 2 years). We assessed nonmedical prescription and street opioid use risk with 
the widely used 8-item National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified—ASSIST 
(WHO ASSIST Working Group, 2002). We separately created Substance Involvement (SI) 
scores for prescription opioids (fentanyl, oxycodone [OxyContin, Percocet], hydrocodone 
[Vicodin], methadone, buprenorphine, etc.) and street opioids (heroin, opium, etc.) by 
adding the scores for items 2-7. Total scores represented low (0-3), moderate (4-26), or 
high risk (27+).

2.3.  Analytic Strategy

Page 6

We used paired t tests and McNemar tests in preliminary analyses to consider gender 
differences in background characteristics and scores on study variables. In the main 
analyses, we estimated actor-partner interdependence models (APIM; Kenny et al., 2006) 
with the MIXED procedure in SPSS version 27. The APIM integrates a conceptual model of 
interdependence in social relationships with statistical procedures that enable the evaluation 
of mutual influences within dyads. Models permitted correlated errors between women 
and men within the couples using a heterogeneous compound symmetry (CSH) covariance 
structure. Actor effects in this study refer to the extent to which one’s own perceptions of 
relationship quality are linked to treatment-related stress. Partner effects refer to the extent 
to which partners’ perceptions of relationship quality are associated with treatment-related 
stress.

We estimated separate models for positive and negative relationship quality. In Model 1, 
we tested the associations between own and partner reports of relationship quality (with 
partners and closest family members/friends) and treatment-related stress. In Model 2, we 
entered partner relationship characteristics (relationship type and duration) as covariates. We 
included a distinguishing variable (1 = woman, −1 = man) to obtain separate intercepts and 
slopes for men and women within couples (Kenny et al., 2006).

3.  Results

Table 1 presents background characteristics and scores on key study variables for the 60 
couples (120 individuals). On average, couples had been together for 8.51 years (SD = 8.46, 
range = 0.25 to 34.0) and were in their mid to late 30s. Most were non-Hispanic White, 
had a high school education or less, and lived in their own homes; but about one in ten 
were homeless. Less than one-third were married, with the majority living as cohabiting 
partners. Both women and men had a moderate risk of nonmedical prescription and street 
opioid use on average. Overall, there were few differences between women and men within 
couples. Relative to their male partners, women were significantly younger (p < .001) and 
were less likely to work full-time or part-time (p = .043). Women reported significantly 
higher negative partner relationship quality than men (p = .036), but did not differ on any 
other study variables.

Table 2 shows APIM parameter estimates for positive relationship quality. Negative 
relationship quality was not significantly associated with treatment-related stress; thus, the 
estimates for this model are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

3.1.  Associations Between Positive Relationship Quality and Treatment-Related Stress

3.1.1.  Women’s treatment-related stress.—Table 2 shows that when women 
reported a more positive relationship with their own closest family member or friend, they 
perceived lower treatment-related stress (b = −0.72, p < .001). When their partners reported 
a more positive partner relationship, women also had lower treatment-related stress (b = 
−0.68, p = .010). When their partners reported a more positive relationship with their own

closest family member or friend, women perceived greater treatment-related stress (b = 0.47, 
p = .035).

3.1.2.  Men’s treatment-related stress.—As shown in Table 2, when their partners 
reported a more positive relationship with their own closest family member or friend, men 
had lower treatment-related stress (b = −0.53, p = .014). Partners’ perceptions of positive 
partner relationship quality were not significantly linked to men’s treatment-related stress. 
Likewise, men’s own reports of positive partner relationship quality and positive relationship 
quality with their closest family member or friend were not significantly linked to treatment-
related stress.

3.2.  Post Hoc Tests

We estimated models controlling for both partners’ worries about own and partner substance 
use in a reduced sample of 57 couples who had complete data on these variables. The 
findings did not change. We next estimated this model with the addition of own and partner 
SI scores for nonmedical prescription and street opioids as covariates in a reduced sample of 
45 couples with complete data on these variables. All findings remained the same with one 
exception. The link between their partners’ reports of positive partner relationship quality 
and women’s treatment-related stress became nonsignificant in this model. Last, we tested 
this model with the inclusion of own and partner reports of treatment duration in a reduced 
sample of 42 couples who had complete data on these variables. The findings did not change 
from the previous model.

4.  Discussion

This study demonstrates that close relationships appear consequential for treatment-related 
stress among couples in which both partners receive methadone for OUD. The present 
findings add to a growing literature on the distinct implications of relationships with 
partners and other close social ties for treatment outcomes (e.g., Heinz et al., 2009; Feng 
et al., 2018; Polenick et al., 2019). In particular, we found that partners’ views of positive 
relationship quality were associated with lower treatment-related stress among women only, 
whereas women’s perceptions of positive relationships with their closest family members 
or friends were associated with lower treatment-related stress among both members of the 
couple. Taken together, these findings suggest that routine clinical care may be enhanced 
by strategies to strengthen and leverage positive social relationships among partnered 
individuals receiving methadone for OUD.

When their partners reported more positive partner relationship quality, women perceived 
lower treatment-related stress. In line with our hypothesis, positive partner relationships 
might attenuate stress among women in methadone treatment. Notably, men did not report 
lower treatment-related stress when they or their partners perceived more positive partner 
relationship quality. Consistent with our prediction, positive partner relationships may be 
more central to treatment-related stress reduction among women. Relative to men, women 
tend to have more social and family responsibilities that might complicate their response 
to treatment. Positive relationships with partners may be a vital resource that combats 
treatment-related stress and fosters resilience among partnered women receiving methadone.

This link became nonsignificant in post hoc tests controlling for own and partner risk of 
using nonmedical prescription and street opioids, however, which suggests that these risk 
indicators might be more impactful.

Women’s positive relationships with other close social ties might help reduce treatment-
related stress experienced by both members of the couple. More specifically, both 
women and men reported lower treatment-related stress when women had more positive 
relationships with their closest family members or friends. These findings align with 
previous research showing that men may benefit psychologically from their partners’ 
positive social relationships (Polenick et al., 2018). These associations held when controlling 
for both dyad members’ worries about own and partner substance use, nonmedical 
prescription and street opioid use risk, and treatment duration in post hoc tests, indicating 
that they are considerably robust.

Contrary to our hypothesis, women reported more treatment-related stress when their 
partners had a more positive relationship with their own closest family member or friend. 
This somewhat counterintuitive finding may in part reflect the greater influence of friends 
and other network members on men’s obtainment and use of substances (e.g., Back et 
al., 2010; Edwards et al., 2019; Lev-Wiesel & Shuval, 2006; Young et al., 2014). Having 
social network members who use drugs (Day et al., 2013; Gogineni et al., 2001; Feng 
et al., 2018) and join patients in using drugs (Shen et al., 2018) is linked to concurrent 
drug use during methadone treatment for OUD. When men receiving methadone have a 
more positive relationship with their closest family members or friends, they may be more 
tempted to use opioids, which in turn might magnify their partners’ treatment-related stress. 
This association remained even after we controlled for both partners’ worries about own and 
partner substance use, risk of opioid use, and treatment duration, which indicates that it is 
likely explained in part by other factors (e.g., limited support from partners, close network 
members interfering in the partner relationship).

Of note, negative relationships with one’s partner and closest family member or friend 
were not significantly associated with treatment-related stress for women or men. Although 
we hypothesized that negative social relationships may intensify treatment-related stress, it 
appears that positive components of close social ties might play a more prominent protective 
role. Positive relationships with partners and other close network members may buffer 
stress during treatment by providing social support and by facilitating more adaptive, drug-
free strategies for coping with negative emotions. Additional research is needed to better 
understand the potential benefits of positive relationship qualities in managing stress and in 
promoting emotional well-being among individuals and couples receiving methadone.

Treatment-related stress has implications for the well-being of couples receiving methadone; 
but it is important to acknowledge that treatment-related stress is not equivalent to treatment 
outcomes. For instance, methadone treatment may be perceived as highly stressful even 
though it is effective in managing OUD. Future research should consider how partner 
relationships and other close relationships are associated with specific components of 
treatment-related stress such as logistical issues (e.g., scheduling conflicts) or interpersonal

difficulties (e.g., poor rapport with treatment staff) that may hinder treatment adherence and 
increase risk of return to opioid use.

4.1.  Limitations and Future Directions

This study has several limitations. First, we cannot determine causal links in a cross-
sectional study. For example, women may have more positive relationships with their 
partners and their closest family members or friends because they experience less treatment-
related stress that strains these social ties. Second the sample was self-selected, which 
could introduce bias in that couples who participated may have better relationships and 
lower treatment-related stress than couples who did not participate. Third, couples were 
heterosexual and mostly non-Hispanic White, and so the results are not generalizable 
to same-sex couples or couples of different race/ethnicities including interracial couples. 
Finally, the sample size was relatively small but similar to the sample sizes of other studies 
focused on couples in which one or both partners are in substance use disorder treatment 
(e.g., Kelley et al., 2016; Flanagan et al., 2018; Schumm et al., 2019) and had sufficient 
power to detect actor and partner effects (Kenny et al., 2006; Loeys et al., 2014). Despite 
these limitations, this study has numerous strengths including the examination of data from 
both dyad members and statistical procedures to explore mutual influences within couples.

Future studies should investigate how social relationships are associated with treatment-
related stress over time among couples. For instance, longitudinal research might consider 
whether positive social relationships are associated with initial levels of and rates of 
change in perceived stress. Future work should also aim to identify mechanisms that 
explain the findings in this study. Pinpointing short-term processes (e.g., daily positive 
social interactions) and their links to both self-reported and objective indicators of stress 
(e.g., biomeasures) would help to determine potentially modifiable targets for intervention. 
Psychopharmacological interventions targeting stress among people with OUD have shown 
promise, but there is a dearth of research on behavioral interventions (MacLean et al., 
2019). Patients receiving methadone for OUD have been found to report high levels of 
treatment willingness and perceived efficacy of group stress reduction treatments (Barry et 
al., 2011), however, suggesting that psychosocial interventions may be feasible and effective. 
Research is needed to evaluate strategies for stress management in methadone treatment that 
include partners and other social network members. Bolstering this approach, most patients 
receiving methadone report having at least one drug-free social network member, and are 
willing and able to involve these individuals in treatment to support their recovery efforts 
(Kidorf et al., 2018; Kidorf et al., 2005; Kidorf et al., 2016).

4.2.  Conclusions

As a whole, this study suggests that social relationships have important implications for 
treatment-related stress among couples receiving methadone for OUD. Couples in which 
both partners receive methadone may be a particularly vulnerable subgroup of patients 
because they are faced with unique barriers and challenges can erode their emotional 
well-being (Cavacuiti, 2004; Simmons & McMahon, 2012; Simmons & Singer, 2006). The 
present findings highlight the clinical value of developing strategies to promote and sustain 
positive social ties among these couples to support their long-term recovery.
