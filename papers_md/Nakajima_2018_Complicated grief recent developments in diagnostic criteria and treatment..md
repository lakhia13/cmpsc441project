Although grief is a natural response to loss among human beings, some
people have a severe and prolonged course of grief. In the 1990s, unusual
grief persisting with a high level of acute symptoms became known as ‘com-
plicated grief (CG)’. Many studies have shown that people who suffer from
CG are at risk of long-term mental and physical health impairments and
suicidal behaviours; it is considered a pathological state, which requires
clinical intervention and treatment. DSM-5 (2013 Diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders, 5th edn) proposed ‘persistent complex bereave-
ment disorder’ as a psychiatric disorder; it is similar to CG in that it is
a trauma- and stress-related disorder. In recent years, there has been con-
siderable research on the treatment of CG. Randomized controlled trials
have suggested the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy including an
exposure component that is targeted for CG. However, experts disagree
about the terminology and diagnostic criteria for CG. The ICD-11 (International
classification of diseases, 11th revision) beta draft proposed prolonged grief
disorder as a condition that differs from persistent complex bereavement
disorder with respect to terminology and the duration of symptoms. This
divergence has arisen from insufficient evidence for a set of core symptoms
and the biological basis of CG. Future studies including biological studies
are needed to reach consensus about the diagnostic criteria for CG.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Evolutionary thanatology: impacts

of the dead on the living in humans and other animals’.

1. Introduction
Most people will experience the death of a loved one due to disease, disaster,
accident, war, homicide or suicide. Although bereavement is inevitable, it
leads to severe psychological suffering, and it sometimes profoundly changes
one’s way of living. Bowlby [1] stated: ‘Loss of a loved one is one of the most
intensely painful experiences any human being can suffer. And not only is it
painful to experience but it is also painful to witness, if only because we are
so impotent to help. To the bereaved nothing but the return of the lost
person can bring true comfort; should what we provide fall short of that it is
felt almost as an insult’.

Given that death is an irreversible process, people have to withstand the
feeling of sadness and continue living with it. However, in most cases, the
bereaved do not require help from professional therapists; they gradually
recover to normal life on their own. Freud [2] described the reaction to the
loss of a significant other as ‘mourning (Trauer)’. He stated that mourning is
a normal response, and that over time mourners relinquish the bond with the
deceased by accepting their absence and transferring libido to others. The con-
cept of mourning is similar to grief, which is a normal reaction to the death of a
loved one and which has both psychological and physiological manifestations
[3]. Freud [2] also indicated that mourning leads to a sequence of psychological
processes that include reality testing. From the psychodynamic viewpoint, he
explained that this process was susceptible to interference from external and
internal conditions. External conditions include critical situations such as a
severe disease of a family member or violent death. Internal conditions refer

to a hostile or excessive relationship with the deceased and
various psychological defence mechanisms including sup-
pression of emotions and disbelief in the death to avoid
distress. Mechanisms for an impeded grief process as
suggested by Freud [2] have been examined in recent studies.
Simon [4] proposed that the nature of the relationship with
the deceased and the nature of death itself, such as sudden
and violent death, were risk factors for the development of
pathological grief. For Lobb et al. [5], cognitive behavioural
conceptualizations including a negative view of the self and
the world, and avoidance of emotional problems, predicted
pathological grief. Lindemann [6] found that the Cocoanut
Grove fire in 1942 led to delayed grief and distorted perceptions
among some acquaintances of the victims; this pathological
type of grief can be transformed to normal grief by appropriate
intervention. More recently, grief researchers have sought to
conceptualize unusual/pathological grief such as complicated
grief (CG) [7,8], traumatic grief [9] and prolonged grief disorder
(PGD) [10].

In the 2000s, based on empirical studies, the opinion
that unusual/pathological grief represented by CG should be
defined as a psychiatric disorder increased among grief
researchers [8,10]. Accordingly,
the American Psychiatric
Association introduced ‘persistent complex bereavement dis-
order’ (PCBD) in the 2013 Diagnostic and statistical manual of
mental disorders, 5th edn (DSM-5) [11]. At the same time, effec-
tive interventions for CG have been required following major
man-made and natural disasters that have occurred in various
parts of the world, such as the 9/11 incident, synchronized
terrorist attacks and the Great East Japan Earthquake.

This review is based on empirical studies and systematic
reviews from PubMed and Psycho INFO related to CG,
PGD and PCBD mainly in the last two decades. It outlines
the concept of normal grief based on attachment theory,
development and arguments concerning diagnostic criteria
for pathological grief, and recent advances in CG treatment.

2. What is ‘grief’?
Grief is primarily an emotional reaction to the loss of a loved
one through death. A ‘loved one’ refers to a person with
whom an individual shares a particularly strong emotional
bond, including attachment figures and carers. Bowlby [1]
drew parallels between the reaction following the death of
the partner among adults and separation distress in infants
who manifest protest, despair and detachment. He suggested
that grief is essentially a reaction to the loss of an attachment
figure. This ‘attachment theory’ view of grief has influenced
many studies [12], supported by attachment mechanisms in
various species and animals including cats, dogs, goats,
non-human primates and elephants, which manifest grief-
like reactions for a dead peer or family member [13]. In her
book How animals grieve, King [13] describes examples such
as a cat looking for its lost sister with plaintive cries and a
group of elephants encircling the bones of a dead group
leader, as if commemorating the deceased individual.
It appears common for some animals as well as humans to
experience grief due to the loss of an attachment figure.

The presence of grief among animals raises the question
of the pertinence of grief for survival. In the case of an
infant temporarily detached from the mother, it is beneficial
for the infant to experience separation distress and to protest

by crying in order to restore proximity or contact with her.
However, when the separation is permanent, as in the case
of a loved one’s death, grief reactions such as longing and
yearning are in vain; they do not reinstate the deceased indi-
vidual and may interfere with forming new attachments [1].
In addition,
if bereaved animals stay by the dead body
when grieving, there may be increased risks of infection or
predation. King [13] stated that manifestations of grief in ani-
mals indicate the possibility of a strong positive emotion—
‘love’—for another individual, which means that grief itself
may not be beneficial for survival, but an inevitable conse-
quence of the rupture of a bond with a loved one or
attachment figure [1]. According to Archer [14], grief is the
cost of the overall adaptive separation reaction, and Parkes
[15] described grief as a price to be paid for having a
loving bond with another.

By contrast, also within an evolutionary framework,
Nesse [16] proposed that grief has an adaptive function. He
stated that grief is useful for coping with bereavement ‘by
signaling others, by changing goals, by preventing future
losses, by reassessing priorities and plans and other relation-
ships’ [16]. The view that grief promotes the reconstruction of
life after bereavement is common in ‘relearning the world’;
Attig [17] proposed that people who lose a loved one relearn
and experience continuity and meaning in their life in a
narrative manner.

This perspective on grief, wherein a person overcomes the
painful emotions caused by bereavement and reconstructs
their life to adapt to the world without the deceased, appears
similar to post-traumatic growth [18] and resilience [19], and
acknowledges that humans have the strength to recover and
grow following a traumatic event.

3. Normal grief and the mourning process
In 1961, Engel [20] described grief as a deviation from a
healthy or normal condition and argued that people recover
from this pathological state to normal in a manner similar
to the recovery process from a burn. In recent years, however,
fewer grief researchers appear to share Engel’s views. This is
because attachment theory-driven views see grieving reac-
tions,
longing, yearning and
depression, as a typical manifestation of separation distress
rather than a pathological reaction.

intense sorrow,

such as

Many researchers including Parkes [15], Stroebe et al. [3]
and Worden [21] interpret grief as a normal reaction, and
for most people intense separation distress becomes manage-
able, and they gradually adapt to their new life without the
deceased. For these researchers, the most important point
that distinguishes normal grief from pathological grief is
the mourning process. Therefore, it is important to understand
what a normal mourning process entails.

Grief researchers have proposed various theories about
the mourning process, including stage theory [1,15], task
theory [21] and dual process theory [22] (see table 1 for a
summary). The stage theory proposed by Bowlby [1] and
Parkes [15] considered the adjustment to bereavement over
a period of several weeks to a few months. This theory
describes four stages: shock –numbness, yearning–searching,
disorganization –despair and reorganization. This theory has
been widely accepted by clinicians and the general popu-
lation, in part owing to the stage theory of acceptance of

stood as implying that all people should go through all of

to assess consistency with Bowlby’s

In response to such criticisms, Stroebe et al. [3] pointed
out that Bowlby did not imply these stages as a concrete
model, and that his theory might be misunderstood. Macie-
jewski et al. [23] examined the relative magnitudes and
patterns of post-loss changes over time on five grief indi-
cators, including disbelief, yearning, anger, depression and
acceptance,

theory. Their findings indicated that disbelief was the initial,
indicator. Acceptance was the most-fre-
dominant grief
quently selected item, which increased throughout
the
study observation period. Yearning was the dominant nega-
tive grief indicator from 1 to 24 months after bereavement.
The normal stages of grief
following a natural death
showed that negative grief indicators peaked within approxi-
mately six months post loss. This finding was inconsistent
it partly supported the
with the stage theory; however,
peak of negative emotions according to Bowlby’s stage
theory. Holland & Neimeyer [24] also failed to fully corrobo-
rate the stage theory, although their finding was partly
consistent with it in the short time period after the loss.
These studies indicate that grieving emotions, such as yearn-
ing, anger and depression, did not shift stepwise, but their
peaks transferred over time.

Worden [21] partly agreed with the phase or stage theory
proposed by Bowlby [1] and Parkes [15] but suggested using

the term ‘task’ in the mourning process, because whereas
‘phase’ implies a passive process, ‘task’ requires the bereaved
to engage actively. He emphasized that most people faced
and overcame the four basic tasks, namely acceptance of
death, processing the pain, adjustment to the world without
the deceased and acknowledging the continuing bond with
the deceased over time [21]. The idea of the continuing
bond contrasts with Freud’s [2] view that people should
transfer their ‘libido’ from the deceased to someone else
through the mourning process. However, in recent years,
there has been an increasing acceptance of the necessity of
the continuing bond with the deceased for adapting to the
loss [29].

identifies two types of stressors,

Stroebe & Schut [22] proposed another theory to explain
how people accept the death of a loved one and recover
from distress in day-to-day life. They called these modes
the dual process model of coping with bereavement. This
model
loss- and restor-
ation-oriented, and a dynamic, regulatory coping process of
oscillation, whereby the grieving individual at times con-
fronts or avoids the different tasks of grieving. In daily life,
the bereaved experiences both aspects;
in other words,
people repeat confrontation and avoidance with the distress
related to death. This pattern is critical
in accepting the
death and starting a new life without the deceased. This
model
is characterized by recognizing the importance of
avoidance of grief work. The role of avoidance in the recovery
process from acute grief seems to be different from that in
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The emotional proces-
sing theory of PTSD proposed by Foa & Kozak [30] regards
harmless stimuli as a non-functional factor interfering with the
natural recovery process. This means that memories related to

the patient’s traumatic event are seen as in the past, and at
present it is not necessary to avoid them. By contrast, the
bereaved individual is forced to confront the reality of the
loss of the loved one; death cannot be treated as a past
event because it is permanent. Parkes [15] stated that the
reality of death is too catastrophic to be quickly accepted
by the bereaved. Therefore,
the bereaved lower their
distress levels through adaptive avoidance, similar to
protective exclusion and reappraisal of the meaning of
death, while oscillating between avoidance and confronta-
tion. Validity of
the dual model process in different
contexts with various types of bereavement has been
addressed in several studies [26,31,32]. Chen et al. [26] reported
that six mothers who lost their children in the 2008 China
earthquake primarily coped with loss-oriented stressors and
shifted their focus to restoration-oriented stressors to deal
with the situation over time.

4. Is CG a mental disorder?
Usually, grief follows a natural course, and people make a
compromise with their loss and move onto their new life.
However, for some, painful yearning and longing persist.
Freud [2] considered any mourning that deviated from the
usual process as not pathological, and he viewed melancholia
as a distinct disorder from mourning.

At present, the concept of pathological grief is widely
accepted among researchers [3,7–11]. Grief that deviates
from the normal process is variously referred to as delayed
grief [6], distorted grief [6], CG [7,8], traumatic grief [9],
PGD [10] and PCBD [11]. One of these attracted considerable
attention among researchers in the 1990s. Stroebe et al. [3]
identified some of its common features and summarized
CG as follows: ‘a clinically significant deviation from the (cul-
tural) norm in either (a) the time course or intensity of
specific or general syndromes of grief and/or (b) the level
of performance in social, occupational, or other important
areas of functioning’.

The development of a validated scale for CG has stimu-
lated empirical studies. Prigerson et al. [33] developed the
inventory of CG (ICG), which is a self-administered scale
with 19 items. As a result of the availability of a validated
CG scale, epidemiological studies have revealed the clinical
status of CG, including prevalence, risk factors and progno-
sis. Additionally, various scales such as ICG-R [33] and the
brief grief questionnaire [34] were developed and used to
measure the prevalence of CG. In a recent meta-analytic
study [35], the estimated prevalence of CG among mourners
was 9.8% (95% CI: 6.8– 14.0%).

The issue of whether or not CG is a psychiatric disorder
has been discussed in the past two decades. According to Pri-
gerson et al. [10] and Shear et al. [8], CG—which Prigerson
et al. [10] termed ‘PGD’ —is a mental disorder which requires
providing treatment to the patient for the following reasons.

(a) The symptoms of CG are outside the scope of

usual grief

The characteristic symptoms of CG include intense yearning,
longing or emotional pain, frequent preoccupying thoughts
and memories of the deceased person, a feeling of disbelief
or inability to accept the loss and difficulty imagining a

meaningful future without the deceased person. Many of
these symptoms are similar to the acute phase of normal
grief. Acute grief reactions such as yearning, longing and
pangs of sadness usually diminish with time. Maciejewski
et al. [23] reported that in the normal stages of grief following
a natural death, the grief indicators peaked including yearn-
ing, anger and depression within approximately six months
post loss. However, the symptoms of CG continue for a pro-
longed period of time. Among bereaved adults of the 11
September attack in New York, 43% met the criteria for CG
2.5–3.5 years after the event [36]. Some symptoms of CG
such as excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss, constant
preoccupation with the deceased and excessive survivor’s
guilt lead to dysfunctional thoughts, maladaptive behaviours
and emotion dysregulation [8]. Furthermore, CG is associated
with a variety of symptoms of poor physical health, mental
problems and social dysfunction, such as high blood
pressure, heart disease, cancer, headache, flu, suicidal idea-
tion [37,38], low subjective health [39], various psychiatric
symptoms [39,40], poor quality of life [39,41] and reduced
vitality [40].

(b) CG differs from responses to a common stressor and

other mental disorders

The prevalence of CG among the general population world-
wide ranges from 2.4% in Japan [42] to 6.7% in Germany
the
[43]. This means that only a small proportion of
bereaved population develops CG. Studies have reported
that the prevalence of CG rises following traumatic events
such as homicide (22% [44]) and terrorist attacks (43%
[36]). CG often exists with other psychological co-morbid-
ities including major depressive disorder
(MDD) and
PTSD [34,44,45]. The lifetime prevalence of a co-morbid dis-
order among the patients with CG is 84.5%, with the most
prevalent being depression (71.8%) [45]. In recent years,
however,
it has generally been thought that CG is dis-
tinguishable from MDD and PTSD. The bereaved with CG
suffers from intrusive memories of the loved one’s death
and avoids memories and reminders related to the loss.
These symptoms of intrusion and avoidance are also seen
in those with PTSD, particularly in the case of a traumatic
death. However, patients with PTSD do not feel sadness
but are fearful of trauma reminders, and they never seek
proximity to the event-related situations or memories
[8,46]. MDD has some features in common with CG, includ-
ing feelings of sadness, guilt, suicidal ideations, decline in
isolation.
interest
Although symptoms of MDD are widespread across many
aspects of life, CG symptoms are restricted to the deceased
[8,46]. Furthermore, the finding that antidepressants are
not effective for CG [47,48] underlines the difference
between depression and CG. The diagnostic overlap
between CG, MDD and PTSD has been reported to be
modest [34,44].

in daily and social

life, and social

(c) CG is universal across nations and cultures
There has been considerable research on CG among various
cultures and nations, including both Western [43,45,49] and
Eastern countries [26,42].

(d) CG has diagnostic validation in biological studies

and responds to therapy

O’Connor et al. [50], in an fMRI study, suggested that the
brain region related to CG was a reward system including
the nucleus accumbens, which differed in reactivity to grief-
related stimuli between CG and non-CG patients. Treatment
studies have demonstrated that cognitive behavioural thera-
pies designed for CG are more effective than other, non-
specific therapies including interpersonal
therapy [46,47]
and supportive counselling [51].

(e) A diagnosis of CG might have more advantages

than disadvantages

One of the reasons for opposing the view of CG as a mental
disorder is the risk of regarding normal grief as pathological
and stigmatizing the bereaved [3,52]. However, based on
their experience and the results of the study by Johnston
et al. [53], Shear et al. [8] suggested that many people were
relieved to know that their symptoms had a name and were
treatable. A field study by Prigerson et al. [10] found that a
CG diagnosis could relieve the anxiety in bereaved individuals
who feared a total mental and emotional breakdown.

In terms of cost, considering CG as a mental disorder
might be advantageous. In Japan, unless diagnosed as a psy-
chiatric disorder, a mental problem is not recognized for
medical insurance. If CG were included as one of the psychia-
tric disorders, like PTSD, the burden of treatment costs to the
patient with CG would be reduced.

5. Complications regarding diagnostic criteria

for CG

Based on multiple studies on CG, in 2013, the American Psy-
chiatric Association considered ‘CG’ as a psychiatric disorder
and named it ‘PCBD’ in the DSM-5 [11]. PCBD is seen in
other specific trauma- and stress-related disorders, and its
diagnostic criteria were described in the chapter on conditions
for future study [11]. It was also mentioned that grief research-
ers had not reached consensus regarding diagnostic criteria.

Prior to the revision of DSM-IV TR to DSM-5, two sets of
diagnostic criteria were published. Prigerson et al. [54] used
the diagnostic name PGD rather than CG. Shear et al. [8] con-
tinued using the term ‘CG’, arguing that the notion of
‘complication’ implied the nuance of interference with the
natural process of recovery; CG was thus a commonly used
term in the literature.

The diagnostic criteria for CG, PGD and PCBD share core
symptoms of separation distress, including persistent yearn-
ing/longing, emotional pain and preoccupation with the
deceased (table 2). However, the most important difference
among them is the duration of the symptoms. The diagnostic
criteria for PCBD require persistent symptoms for at least
12 months [11], compared with six months in PGD [54] and
CG [8]. In ICD-11, which is scheduled to be revised in
2018, PGD will be defined as a condition that persists for
six months (ICD-11 beta draft, December 2017).

Other aspects of the diagnostic criteria for PCBD have been
debated. Boelen & Prigerson [59] criticized the criteria of
PCBD based on the inclusion of some new items such as ‘dif-
ficulty in positive reminiscing’, which were not included in the

sets proposed for PGD [54] and CG [8], and that there was no
evidence that the 12-month post-loss criterion was effective for
distinguishing CG from normal grief. Many authors have con-
sidered the appropriateness of the diagnostic criteria for ICD-
11 and revising the DSM-5 [55–58,60]. In a study of clinical
and community samples, Cozza et al. [57] found that CG cri-
teria showed higher accuracy than PGD and PCBD, which
excluded non-clinical cases and identified more than 90% of
clinical cases. Maciejewski et al. [58] compared the four pro-
posed criteria for distorted grief, including PGD, PCBD, CG
and PGD of
the ICD-11 beta draft, among community
samples. They reported PGD, PGD of ICD-11 and PCBD
having a high consistency of diagnosis (0.80–0.84) and similar
sensitivity (0.83–0.93) and specificity (0.95–0.98) [58]. They
suggested that CG criteria differed from the others because
CG had a moderate pairwise agreement with the other criteria
(0.48–0.55) and had a high sensitivity (1.0) and moderate
specificity (0.79) [58]. Maciejewski et al. [58] expressed concern
that CG might identify a high rate of false-positive cases and
pathologize normal grief. However, Reynolds et al.
[56]
argued that the sample used in Maciejewski et al.’s study
[58] was biased towards non-clinical and elderly female
subjects, and that CG criteria were superior to PGD for detect-
ing clinical samples. Underlying the controversy about
diagnostic criteria is a lack of consensus regarding the core
concept and biological evidence of the pathology of grief.

6. Recent trends in CG treatment
Despite the lack of consensus regarding diagnostic criteria for
CG, studies on treatment have made progress over the past
decade. In pharmacotherapy, the focus is on the effectiveness
of antidepressants. One study [48] reported that a tricyclic
antidepressant (nortriptyline) was effective for depressive
symptoms, but not for grief symptoms. Studies using other
types of antidepressant, namely serotonin-selective reuptake
inhibitors including escitalopram [61,62] and paroxetine
[63], showed a significant reduction in ICG scores in a
before-and-after procedure without a control group. How-
ever, a randomized clinical trial to examine the efficacy of
citalopram [47] found that it significantly improved depress-
ive symptoms such as suicidal ideation, but was not effective
for CG symptoms. At present, there is no evidence that
antidepressants are effective for treating CG.

Stroebe et al. [64] conducted a systematic review of the
effectiveness of psychosocial and psychological counselling
at three stages including primary, secondary and tertiary pre-
ventive interventions. Primary interventions were effective
for all bereaved individuals including those with higher
levels of mental health problems before intervention. Second-
ary interventions for high-risk bereaved individuals were
effective when associated with stringent risk criteria, showing
the need for further differentiation within groups and tailor-
ing intervention for subgroups. In the tertiary intervention
for bereaved individuals with mental disorders, the specific
individual treatments for CG were effective.

Wittouck et al. [65] reported a meta-analysis of the preven-
tion and treatment of CG. They were unable to establish the
effectiveness of a preventive intervention for CG; however, treat-
ment interventions, especially cognitive behavioural therapy
(CBT) [46,51,66] focused on CG, could effectively reduce CG
symptoms. In addition, it was reported that some randomized

controlled trials of CBT focused on CG including the exposure
components to death situations [47,67] were effective, with a
large effect size. Shear [68] stated that imaginal revisiting—the
name of the exposure strategy in their treatment—was intended
to facilitate the ability to both think about death and set it aside.
Boelen et al. [51] reported that the effect size of the exposure com-
ponent in CBT for CG (0.94) was greater than the cognitive
restriction component (0.44), and exposure appeared effective
in terms of avoidant thoughts and behaviours. Bryant et al.
[67] reported that CBT with exposure therapy was more effective
for CG than CBT alone, and that the exposure component might
promote emotional processing of memories of the death.
Although the method of exposure component varies across
treatment studies, it is commonly used to reduce avoidance of
reminders and memories of the deceased, and to promote the
acceptance of death and restriction of negative thoughts. The
results of these treatment studies are considered to provide
insights into the pathology of CG.

regarding new diagnostic criteria and recent trends in CG
treatment. The loss of a loved one is inevitable, and the psy-
chology of grief, especially pathological grief, has been
increasingly intensively studied in recent years. In the
1990s, a type of pathological grief was studied; it was simi-
lar to CG, characterized by an extended period of acute
grief and impaired physical, psychological and social func-
tioning, and treatment measures were developed. Naming
this condition as PCBD and including it as a psychiatric dis-
order in DSM-5 marked a milestone in CG research. The
prevalence rate of CG is 2.4% [42] to 6.7% [43] among the
general population; this means that many people in the
world suffer from this condition for a long time, especially
in disaster- and conflict-affected regions. Given the impor-
tance of developing effective and convenient treatment
methods for these people, we need to reach a consensus
on diagnostic criteria and continue to develop standardized
assessment tools.

7. Conclusion
This article briefly reviewed progress in our understanding
the debate
of pathological grief as typified by CG,
