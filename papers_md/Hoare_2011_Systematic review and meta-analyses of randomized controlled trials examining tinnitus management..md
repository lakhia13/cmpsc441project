Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of Randomized Controlled
Trials Examining Tinnitus Management

Derek J. Hoare, PhD; Victoria L. Kowalkowski, BA; Sujin Kang, MA; Deborah A. Hall, PhD

Objectives/Hypothesis: To evaluate the existing level of evidence for tinnitus management strategies identified in the

UK Department of Health’s Good Practice Guideline.

Study Design: Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and meta-analyses.
Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Web of Science, and EMBASE (earliest to
August 2010), supplemented by hand searches in October 2010. Only randomized controlled trials that used validated
questionnaire measures of symptoms (i.e., measures of tinnitus distress, anxiety, depression) were included.

Results: Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria, most of which provide moderate levels of
evidence for the effects they reported. Levels of evidence were generally limited by the lack of blinding, lack of power calcula-
tions, and incomplete data reporting in these studies. Only studies examining cognitive behavioral therapy were numerous
and similar enough to perform meta-analysis, from which the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (moderate effect size)
appears to be reasonably established. Antidepressants were the only drug class to show any evidence of potential benefit.

Conclusions: The efficacy of most interventions for tinnitus benefit remains to be demonstrated conclusively. In particu-
lar, high-level assessment of the benefit derived from those interventions most commonly used in practice, namely hearing
aids, maskers, and tinnitus retraining therapy needs to be performed.

Key Words: Tinnitus, Good Practice Guidelines, UK Department of Health, cognitive behavioral therapy, tinnitus

retraining therapy, randomized controlled trial.

INTRODUCTION

The ‘‘phantom’’ auditory experience of

tinnitus
affects 10% to 15% of people in the United Kingdom.1 It
is most clearly associated with noise exposure and age-
ing and can present with comorbid sleep disturbance,
hearing difficulty, social withdrawal, and negative emo-
tional reactions such as anxiety and depression.2,3
Although a majority of tinnitus patients are male and
present with some form of hearing loss and higher-fre-
quency steeply sloping hearing loss in particular, there
is no typical characteristic history or level of distress of
the help-seeking tinnitus patient.4

In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health
issued a Good Practice Guide (GPG) for the commission-
ing of tinnitus services and for the clinical assessment

and management of tinnitus patients.5 It recommends
that
tinnitus severity is assessed using either the
Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)6 or the Tinnitus
Questionnaire.7 It also recommends that psychological
comorbidity is assessed using the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory8 or the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).9 How-
ever, questionnaire use in clinical practice is limited.10

therapeutic

In terms of management,

targets
include the sound itself (i.e., interrupt the neural signal
generating the sound) or the associated symptoms of dis-
tress, anxiety, or depression that
can accompany
tinnitus. The GPG states that tinnitus patients will be
given, as appropriate,
information/education, hearing
aids, counseling and psychological support, relaxation
therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with the
requisite professional supervision, sleep management
(including supervised CBT), sound enrichment therapy,
and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). The use of anti-
depressants, anxiolytics, and night sedation is also
advocated. However, the GPG lacks an evidence base to
support these recommendations and is in part based on
anecdotal evidence and expert opinion.

This review asked the question, how much high-
level evidence exists for the efficacy of
the GPG-
suggested tinnitus management strategies, and was re-
stricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold
standard for evaluating therapeutic interventions.11,12 A
systematic search was used to identify RCTs that

examined tinnitus management strategies and reported
validated measures of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or
depression, therefore providing comparable measures of
change in patient symptoms. Where possible, meta-anal-
yses were conducted. The outcome of
this review
provides high-level evidence that supports some, but not
all, GPG recommended strategies for tinnitus manage-
ment in the United Kingdom, and also highlights where
further RCTs would be of immediate benefit.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

for transparent reporting of a systematic review13 and guided
our reporting.

Systematic Search Strategy and Study Selection
Studies were selected and screened according to the
research question and PICOS criteria. PICOS were: partici-
pants, adult humans with tinnitus;
tinnitus
management strategies proposed by the Department of Health
(GPG); comparisons, a no-treatment group or suitable second
treatment group; outcomes, validated questionnaire measure of
tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, depression; and study design,
randomized controlled trials only. Quasi- and pseudo-random-
izations were excluded from this review.

tion. Search results were screened to remove duplicate, non-
peer reviewed, and review articles. Two authors (D.J.H., V.L.K.)
screened abstracts according to the research question and
PICOS criteria. All
titles selected by either author were
retrieved to screen their full text for final agreement and inclu-
sion. The initial search was complimented with further hand
searches of key journals, Cochrane reviews, and the reference
lists of all included studies. The stages and reasons for exclu-
sions are presented in Figure 1.

Data Extraction

Extracted data comprised participant numbers, baseline
tinnitus severity, age range, the intervention and control, vali-
dated questionnaire measures used, follow-up conducted, the
study design, and study findings. For all studies, data was
extracted independently by two authors (D.J.H., V.L.K.). Any dif-
ferences in reporting were reconciled by jointly revisiting the
relevant publication.

Quality Assessment

Study quality was based on a subset of extracted data.
The quality assessment tool was based on one reported previ-
ously.14 For each criterion, a score of 2 was applied if the study
met the criterion to a high standard, 1 if it partly met the crite-
it was flawed or if the relevant
rion, or a score of 0 if
information was not stated. Two authors scored studies inde-
pendently before agreeing on a final score for each criterion and
each study. The potential overall quality score varied from 0 to
16, giving grades of evidence from very low (0–4), low (5–8),
moderate (9–12) to high (13–16). Qualitative descriptors for
these grades are given in Oxman et al.11 Essentially, the lower
the level of evidence, the more likely further studies are to
impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and are likely

to change that estimate. Only high-level evidence studies pro-
vide conclusive evidence, after which additional research is
unlikely to change the estimate of effect.

Data Synthesis and Meta-Analyses

Where studies were sufficiently similar, a meta-analysis
was performed. Similarity is defined here as the same interven-
tion and outcome measure, and low heterogeneity. The test for
heterogeneity is detailed below. Where studies were not suffi-
ciently

Effect Size Calculation for Individual Studies

For each study, Cohen’s d effect size was calculated for
the primary treatment intervention and primary measure of
change compared to an independent control given by the for-
mula below. An intention-to-treat analysis was used, and
follow-up assessments were not included in this analysis.
Limited by the available data, standard deviation (SD) of pre-
intervention and precontrol (baseline) scores were used as the
group-specific standard deviations of mean change scores
within groups.

Estimating Publication Bias Effects

To search for evidence of publication bias and evaluate the
influence of individual studies on the outcome, funnel plots
were constructed. The estimate of effect (observed outcome)
from each study was plotted against its standard error. If there
is no publication bias, the data-points appear symmetrical
around the mean effect. An asymmetrical plot, however, implies
that studies giving significant results were more likely to be
published than studies giving nonsignificant results.

The ‘‘trim and fill’’ method16 was applied to calculate the
number of studies that would be required to return the plot to
‘‘symmetry,’’ and therefore remove publication bias. This method
estimates summary effect size based on the assumption that all
such studies had been published.

RESULTS

All studies included in this review were RCTs of
tinnitus management interventions mentioned in the
GPG. All participant groups were representative of a
clinically relevant population, and without exception all
studies reported one or more outcomes based on vali-
dated questionnaire measures of tinnitus, anxiety, or
depression. Unless otherwise stated, studies included
adults of all ages, and baseline scores for outcome meas-
ures did not differ
significantly between groups.
Throughout, statistical significance refers to a reliable
numerical difference between group means. Clinical sig-
nificance refers to the specific questionnaire score
change that implies a functional improvement or wor-
sening of the condition in an individual patient.

Test for Heterogeneity Across Studies

Heterogeneity (v2) of aggregated effect sizes were calcu-
lated using Cochran’s Q statistic (significance level ¼ .05) and
I2 index (percentages of around 25% indicates low heterogeneity
and 0 indicates that sampling error only accounts for all the
variability in effect size estimates within studies). Results were
checked for significance with K-1 degrees of freedom, where K
¼ number of studies.

Meta-Analysis: Summary Effect Size and
Confidence Intervals

Fixed-effects meta-analyses of questionnaire measures
were performed, using the standardized mean difference
method. In addition, weighted meta-analysis with fixed-effects
standard errors was performed to get a summary effect size
(and its 95% confidence interval [CI]) for each type of interven-
tion as appropriate. Weighting used the inverse variance
procedure, where studies with a large standard error, typically
with small sample sizes, were given less weight.15 The statisti-
cal significance of the summary effect size was evaluated using
the Z statistic (Zi ¼ Ti/se(Ti)where Ti is the effect measure from
study i).15

Information/Education (Directive Counseling)

Three RCTs were identified that assessed the effi-
cacy of education/information giving. They provide
moderate levels of evidence and report small or moder-
ate effect sizes (Table I). Henry et al.17
found a
statistically significant reduction in Tinnitus Severity
Index18 score at 6-month follow-up in a group receiving
a tinnitus education program delivered by audiologists,
compared to a change in members of a self-help group.
Differences at all other time points were not significant.
In a study of CBT discussed later, Henry and Wilson19
examined the efficacy of group education delivered by a
clinical psychologist versus a waiting-list control. In this
study they found no significant changes in the BDI, Tin-
nitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ),20 or Tinnitus
Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ).21

Two further studies looked at the efficacy of a self-
help book with or without telephone contact with a thera-
pist, compared to a waiting list control.22,23 Kaldo et al.22
reported a significant reduction in TRQ score in their
intervention group compared to controls. Whether benefit
was retained is unclear, as 15 participants tried additional
interventions between the end of intervention and follow-
up. In terms of clinically significant changes in TRQ (i.e.,
a 50% reduction),21 32% of the intervention group and 5%
of the control group improved. In the second study,

tion in TRQ score versus 14% of controls. Because Kaldo

et al.22 used a self-help book with weekly therapist phone
calls and Malouff et al.23 used only the self-help book,
meta-analysis could not be performed.

In summary,

information/education delivered in
the form of a book or therapist-led educational sessions
had significant effects over no intervention or undir-
ected self-help. Furthermore, providing a self-help book
and therapist contact appears to have greater benefit
than providing a self-help book alone. Education alone
is sufficient for some patients because it also makes
them aware of other potential management interven-
tions (i.e., some individuals may use that information to
explore other strategies, as was observed by Kaldo
et al.22).

Hearing Aids

No RCTs investigated hearing-aid use as a primary
intervention for tinnitus and obtained a validated out-
come measure. Stephens and Corcoran24 did include a
subgroup of individuals who received hearing aids (dis-
sound enrichment). Sometimes
cussed later under
hearing-aid provision forms part of TRT, and therefore
these studies are discussed later.

Counseling and Psychological Support

No specific RCTs involved counseling or psychologi-
cal support. When counseling was given, it was more
appropriate to consider it as information/education,
relaxation therapy, CBT, or TRT.

Relaxation Therapy

and

active

relaxation

Three RCTs assessed the efficacy of relaxation
therapies, providing low to moderate levels of evi-
dence, of small to large effect sizes (Table I). Biesinger
et al.25 examined the efficacy of Qigong, a mindful
exercise
technique. They
reported high compliance and a significant mean
improvement in Tinnitus Beeintra¨ chtigungs Fragebo-
gen Questionnaire26 score in the intervention group
versus waiting-list control. However, in this study the
control group reported a significantly higher baseline
tinnitus severity, limiting the interpretative weight of
their finding. In a second study, Ireland et al.27 com-
pared group (progressive muscle) relaxation training
to a waiting-list control. They found no significant dif-
ferences in change on BDI or State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory scores28 between groups. They did, however,
note greater improvement in three participants who
said their tinnitus was stress related. This study was
rated as low-level evidence and did not report a vali-
dated measure of tinnitus distress. The third study of
relaxation therapy from Weise et al.29 used electromy-
ography biofeedback with a waiting-list control. They
found significant improvements in both Tinnitus Ques-
tionnaire (Goebel-Hiller) (TQ) and BDI scores in their
intervention group. The methodologies used in the
three studies of relaxation training were not suffi-
ciently similar to perform meta-analysis.

In summary, there is evidence for the efficacy of
relaxation therapy for tinnitus intrusiveness, mixed evi-
dence of its efficacy for depressive symptoms, and no
evidence for an effect on anxiety.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Eleven RCTs examined CBT for tinnitus, the major-
ity of which provided moderate levels of evidence (Table
I). Three studies examined the efficacy of CBT delivered
via the internet.30–32 Andersson et al.30 examined the ef-
ficacy of internet-based CBT but compared to a waiting-
list control. Attrition was 51% in this study (leaving
fewer participants than their calculated sample size).
They did, however, report significant statistical improve-
ments in TRQ score in the CBT group compared to
controls. Thirty-one percent had a clinically significant
improvement. Andersson et al.30 also reported statisti-
cally significant
improvements in both anxiety and
depression. In a second study from the same research
group, Abbott et al.31 compared internet-based CBT to
internet-based education without CBT elements. They
reported 75% (24 of 32) attrition for the CBT interven-
tion and 21% in controls. Participants reported that the
intervention was not engaging enough. The authors also
suggested that this intervention may be too much of a
commitment and therefore inappropriate for those with
low baseline tinnitus distress levels. Unsurprisingly, no
significant effects on TRQ or Depression, Anxiety and
Stress Scale33 scores were identified. In a third study,
Kaldo et al.32 compared internet-delivered CBT with
therapist-delivered group CBT. This study found no sig-
nificant differences in THI, TRQ, or HADS score
changes between groups (i.e., one mode of delivery was
not superior to the other). In this study, 38% of partici-
pants failed to complete the internet CBT compared to
24% who received the group CBT intervention. Internet
CBT was deemed less credible by participants.

Four studies examined the efficacy of CBT deliv-

Andersson et al.34 made this comparison in elderly tin-

pared
significant
improvements in HADS or Anxiety Severity Index
(ASI)35 scores. In fact, the ASI score increased signifi-
cantly in their control group. In terms of clinical
significance, 42% of CBT participants showed clinical
improvement in TRQ, but this reduced to 25% at 3-
month follow-up. Henry and Wilson36 also reported
statistically significant improvement in TRQ score in
their CBT group compared to controls. They found no
changes in either BDI or THQ scores. Kro¨ner-Herwig
et al.37 reported a significant improvement in TQ score.
In Robinson et al.,38 attrition was 32% in the CBT
group (participants reported that they were not dis-
tressed enough or that participation was too demanding

very chronic cases. A power calculation was conducted
for this study, but again, because of high attrition, the
sample size estimate was not met. Furthermore, as is
unforeseeable with full randomization, the intervention
group had a significantly higher baseline TRQ than
controls, making the groups less comparable. A signifi-
cant effect was also reported for changes in BDI score
in the CBT group compared to controls.

Three studies compared the efficacy of psychologist-
delivered group CBT to education or relaxation training.
Henry and Wilson36 examined group CBT versus educa-
tion alone, as well as waiting-list controls, and reported a
significant reduction in TRQ score in the CBT. However,
the difference between groups was not significant at 12-
month follow-up. THQ score also reduced significantly in
their CBT group versus controls. There was no significant
effect on BDI scores. Kro¨ner-Herwig et al.39 compared
group CBT to a minimal contact education or relaxation
intervention and a waiting-list control. The group who
received CBT were significantly more improved on TQ
score than all other groups. Changes in the General
Depression Scale (ADS)40 were not significant, which the
author attributes to ‘‘floor effects.’’ In this study, the groups
who received either the education or relaxation interven-
tion did not show significant improvement in TQ scores
compared to controls. In the third study, Zachriat and Kro¨-
ner-Herwig41 compared CBT, TRT, and an education-only
intervention. TQ scores were significantly improved in the
CBT group compared to controls. The difference between
groups remained significant 6 months following interven-
tion but was not significant at a subsequent follow-up.

The final study of CBT reviewed here, from Rief
et al.,42 examined the efficacy of one-to-one CBT com-
pared to waiting-list controls. They found a significant
improvement in TQ score for the CBT group compared
to controls. The benefit was maintained after 6 months.

Effect sizes were calculated for each study of CBT
(Table I). Meta-analysis was performed to determine over-
all effect sizes comparing the pre-change versus post-
change, and 95% CIs for CBT when delivered via the
internet (Fig. 2A) or by a therapist (Fig. 2B, 2C). Because
Kaldo et al.32 used standard group-based CBT as a control
group and Robinson et al.38 did not provide postinterven-
tion data, they were excluded from meta-analyses.

There was no significant heterogeneity or degree of
inconsistency between any of the studies grouped for meta-
analysis (P ¼ not significant, I2 index ¼ 0% in all cases).

The overall effect size for internet-delivered CBT
(Fig. 2A) was 0.38 (small effect) with a 95% CI of 0.07–
0.68 (z ¼ 2.41 and P ¼ .016) (i.e., patients undergoing
internet-delivered CBT reported significant improvement
compared to controls).

The overall effect size for therapist-delivered CBT
when measured using THQ scores (Fig. 2B) was 0.54
(medium effect) with a 95% CI of 0.12-0.96 (z ¼ 2.51 and
P ¼ .012) (i.e., the patients undergoing CBT improved).
The funnel plot (Fig. 2D) for these studies suggests that
two additional studies would need to be added to bring
the funnel plot back to symmetry. If these two studies
were added then the estimated treatment effect (fixed-
effect model) would drop from 0.54 to 0.44.

A final meta-analysis was performed for therapist-
delivered CBT when measured using the TQ (Fig. 2C). The
overall effect size was 0.64 (medium effect) with a 95% CI
of 0.31 to 0.98 (z ¼ 3.74 and P < 0.001). Again therefore,
patients undergoing therapist-delivered CBT reported sig-
nificant improvement compared to controls. The funnel
plot for the therapist-delivered CBT with TQ (Fig. 2E)
shows considerable symmetry (i.e., there is no evidence of
bias, and therefore we can be confident of this effect).

In summary, 10 RCTs compared CBT to a non-CBT
control, of which nine reported significant improvements
in tinnitus intrusiveness. Of the seven studies that mea-
sured depression, only two found improvements, and of
the three studies that measured anxiety, just one reported
improvement. CBT is therefore specifically associated with
reductions in self-reported tinnitus severity with little evi-
dence to suggest it has any benefit for tinnitus-related
anxiety or depression. This effect appears to be independ-
ent of whether CBT is compared to an educational or
waiting-list
suggesting that either measure
adequately controls for placebo effects in these studies.

control,

The effect size for therapist-delivered CBT is larger
than that for internet CBT, although the one study that
assessed the relative efficacy of these two methods
(Kaldo et al.)32 did not find any significant differences in
their outcome measures (HADS, THI, or TRQ). Of note
in this study, however, is that email contact, part of the
internet-delivered CBT, was tailored to perceived need,
whereby considerably more email contact was main-
tained with some participants than might have occurred
in other studies. Although internet-delivered CBT might
be accessible and cost effective, it had the highest attri-
tion of all interventions in this review.

the intervention is less indicated for
suggest
patients with milder tinnitus or longer-term tinnitus,
and does not appear to be effective alone for depressive
or anxiety symptoms.

Effective CBT interventions were either delivered
as a software package, or face-to-face by a clinical psy-
chologist
or psychiatrist. Crucially, no RCT was
identified where CBT was delivered by an audiologist or
hearing therapist. Given the limited availability of clini-
cal psychology support in the United Kingdom,10 it is
important that the efficacy of audiologist-delivered CBT,
as advocated by the GPG, is assessed with an RCT. Fur-
thermore, individual studies report delivering CBT for
between 7 and 22 hours in total, over a period of 6 to 15
weeks. The issues of patient and clinician burden, and of
cost benefit, are therefore also important considerations.

Sleep Management

No RCTs specifically examined sleep management
practices for tinnitus patients, beyond those for CBT or
night sedation.

Sound Enrichment Therapy

Three RCTs assessed the efficacy of different forms
of sound enrichment. These studies provide low to mod-
erate levels of evidence, and where calculable, indicate a

ficacy of Neuromonics (customized spectrally modified

with different modules of Neuromonics intervention, but
participants self-adjusted the prescribed treatment for

quality was rated low because of inadequate randomiza-
tion, a lack of blinding, and under-reporting of study
detail, therefore there is significant uncertainty of the
estimated effect. In an earlier study, Stephens and Cor-
coran24 examined the efficacy of maskers, hearing aids
or combination devices, tailored to individual hearing
loss, compared to limited counseling without a sound

device. There were no improvements in this study. In
fact, one group using maskers reported a significant
increase in anxiety (Crown Crisp Experiential Index)44
compared to controls. This study also provided only low-
level evidence of the reported effect, but given the lack
of evidence to suggest otherwise, contraindicates mask-
ing devices for tinnitus patients presenting with anxiety.
An active form of sound enrichment was used by
Herraiz et al.45 Participants undertook frequency dis-
crimination training, after which there was a reduction
in THI score in their intervention groups compared to
waiting-list controls. Although this was statistically sig-
nificant, it was not clinically significant. This finding
may be in part limited by their eligibility criteria, which
excluded those with more severe tinnitus.

Sound enrichment interventions and outcome meas-
ures were not sufficiently similar for us to perform
meta-analysis. It is surprising that so little evidence
exists for the efficacy of sound enrichment given that, in
the United Kingdom at least, prescription of hearing
aids and maskers for tinnitus is commonplace.10 In par-
ticular, it is crucial to establish the efficacy of hearing
aids for patients with mild hearing loss, who may or
may not be offered a hearing aid depending on the clini-
cians’ own personal belief about efficacy. This is quite a
widespread practice in the United Kingdom.10

Tinnitus Retraining Therapy

The aim of TRT is to promote habituation to tinni-
tus through a combination of sound enrichment and
directive counseling.46 In addition to the study reported
earlier (Zachriat and Kro¨ner-Herwig),41
two further
RCTs of TRT were identified, both of which provide low-
level evidence. Caffier et al.47 compared TRT to a wait-
ing-list control, finding a significant reduction in TQ
score in their TRT group versus controls at 12 months.
Interpreting efficacy is difficult. TRT was not delivered
according to a single protocol but was highly individual
between participants, as was the use of prescribed devi-
ces, and additional treatment for anxiety or depression.
Authors indicate that there was more improvement in
participants undertaking (as opposed to rejecting) addi-
it was
tional treatment for anxiety or depression if
indicated. Seydel et al.48 compared TRT (modified to
include psychosomatic treatment, cognitive-behavioral
elements, and relaxation treatment) with a waiting-list
control. After 3 months of treatment, mean TQ score
was significantly reduced in the TRT group compared to
controls. ADS scores, indicating anxiety and depression,
also reduced significantly in the TRT group compared to
controls. The authors noted greater improvement in
individuals with a higher baseline depression score. Fol-
low-up was not well controlled, but the TQ score of the
TRT group remained low after 1 year, whereas ADS
score returned to baseline after 6 months. As in Caffier
et al.47 treatment was tailored to individual need.

The efficacy of TRT may depend on its adaptability
as an intervention rather than as a fixed, protocol-driven
intervention. The two studies of TRT were not suffi-
ciently similar to perform meta-analysis.

Antidepressants

Three RCTs examining the efficacy of antidepres-
sants were identified, providing moderate-to-high level
evidence of negligible to large-effect sizes (Table I). Rob-
inson et al.49 compared paroxetine (up to 50 mg daily, as
tolerated) to placebo. They found no significant changes
in tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression. Fur-
thermore, they noted several significant adverse events:
sexual dysfunction,
excessive drowsiness, and dry
mouth. Sullivan et al.50 compared nortriptyline (up to
100 mg at night, as tolerated) to placebo (lactose). They
reported a significant reduction in Hamilton Depression
Rating Scale,51 score for the intervention group com-
pared to controls. Sub-analysis suggested that those
reporting greatest benefit were women and individuals
reporting insomnia. Zo¨ger et al.52 compared sertraline to
placebo. They reported significant improvements on the
Tinnitus Severity Questionnaire53 and the Hamilton
Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)54 for the group receiving sertra-
line compared to placebo. This
slightly
complicated, as nine participants were given oxazepam
in the first 2 weeks to alleviate expected worsening of
distress. But oxazepam itself is a benzodiazepine, which
may have an effect on tinnitus.55 Zo¨ger et al.52 reported
24% attrition in this study, but none of the dropouts had
received oxazepam, suggesting that it may have affected
their result.

study is

In summary, three RCTS examining antidepres-
sants report three different findings. Meta-analysis was
not performed.

Anxiolytics

One RCT examined the efficacy of an anxiolytic.
Jalali et al.56 compared alprazolam (a benzodiazepine)
with chlorpheniramine (antihistamine), excluding partic-
ipants scoring more than 14 points on the HAM-A
anxiety questionnaire. They found no significant change
in THI score between groups. Changes in anxiety and
depression were not reported.

Night Sedation

Two RCTs were identified that examined the effi-
the neurohormone sedative melatonin. Neri
cacy of
et al.57 compared melatonin (3 mg at night for 80 nights)
to a no-treatment control group. There were no signifi-
cant changes in THI score between groups. Rosenberg
et al.58 compared melatonin (3 mg at night for 30 nights)
to placebo (lactose) and also found no significant effect
on THI score between groups. Anxiety and depression
were not measured in these studies. Meta-analysis was
not performed.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence
base for those tinnitus management interventions rec-
ommended by the Department of Health’s Good Practice
Guide.5 Where possible, we aimed to identify the condi-
tions under which these interventions are efficacious,
and consider whether these interventions are sufficiently

researched or in need of further study. We also asked
which patients benefit most, but report little on this
question due to limited information in those studies
reviewed.

In a previous review of RCTs of tinnitus interven-
tions, Dobie did not find any that demonstrated a
significant benefit of intervention over typically large
placebo effects.12 He concluded that nowhere in the liter-
ature were there studies similar enough to attempt
meta-analysis. Two recommendations from that review
were that future RCTs needed consensus outcome meas-
ures and adequate sample sizes. There is a now
reasonable consensus in the tinnitus research commu-
nity on which validated measures to use.59 In this
review, the most widely used tinnitus questionnaire was
the TRQ. It appeared in 10 of the 28 studies and was
used here in two separate meta-analyses. However, only
seven of 28 studies used a power calculation to estimate
their required sample size. Therefore, more than 10
years on, although we have greater RCT-level evidence
and some opportunities for meta-analysis, there is still
little evidence for the efficacy of most recommended
treatment strategies.

It

trials. However,

is striking that many authors ascribed null
results for changes in depression and anxiety to the fact
that participants have low baseline scores, often quoting
floor effects. It may well be that, as authors suggest,
more distressed individuals are less likely to put them-
selves forward for clinical
it may
equally be that major depression or other comorbidities
are less common than anecdotally suggested. Studies of
the prevalence of comorbid depression or anxiety suggest
it is no more an issues for tinnitus patients than it is for
non-tinnitus ENT patients.60,61 Given that the screening
and management of anxiety and depression is high-
lighted in the GPG, more routine clinical assessment of
anxiety and depression at baseline and outcome is
needed to explore this observation.

Improving the Quality of Tinnitus Research

Of the 28 studies identified, six were rated as low-
level evidence, 17 as moderate, and five as high-level
evidence (Table I). Unsurprisingly, four of the high-level
trials involved drug therapies. Only one high-level trial
of CBT was identified. For therapies involving sound
enrichment or TRT, studies were rated as providing lit-
tle or no evidence above low-level.

The main factor limiting study quality was blinding
of participants to the intervention or expected outcome,
and blinding of investigators to the expected outcome.
There are ethical limitations to blinding that may be
insurmountable; it would be unethical to deliver a psy-
chological intervention such as CBT in a way that is
wrong. Blinding of investigators, however, could be used
more routinely as outcomes can easily be measured by a
researcher who is blind to the intervention received.
Only six of 28 studies reported the use of blinding, five
of which were drug trials.

Use of appropriate controls is an issue. Given the
nature of some tinnitus management interventions, a

three-armed controlled design seems most appropriate
(i.e., a formal
intervention such as CBT or TRT
compared to a simpler intervention such as a self-help
book) and a no-intervention or waiting-list control. This
design was used in some studies reviewed here and
partly controls for placebo/nonspecific effects (e.g., learn-
ing more about
time) and
toward identifying which components of the treatments
are likely responsible for change.

tinnitus, clinical contact

Adequate numbers of participants are also impor-
tant. Only seven of 28 RCTs conducted a power
calculation of their required sample size, and only five
met that sample size. Power calculations represent a
simple way to improve future study quality in tinnitus
research.

By design, all RCTs reviewed here reported vali-
dated measures of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or
depression. Although many authors reported clinically
as well as statistically significant changes, some limited
their reports to the statistical changes only, which may
have no real meaning in the clinic. In similar terms, it is
also important to note the significance of nonspecific
effects. For example, Rief et al.42 reported a 5-point
reduction in TQ score as a significant improvement com-
pared to waiting-list controls. However, elsewhere in the
literature a 5-point reduction in TQ score (from a compa-
rable baseline) was observed between two repeated
measures,62 suggesting that this reduction is within
the expected variability or test-retest value of the mea-
sure. More thorough reporting of clinical and statistical
significance, or the provision of individual scores, is rec-
ommended for transparency and to facilitate future
meta-analyses.

CONCLUSION

Tinnitus care and research has long been and con-
tinues to be a challenge. The efficacy of most tinnitus
management
interventions recommended for clinical
practice remains to be demonstrated conclusively as
there are currently too few studies to make informed
conclusions. Most studies reviewed here provide only
moderate levels of evidence largely due to a lack of
Interventions
power and incomplete data reporting.
most in need of high-level evidence studies are hearing
aids/sound enrichment and TRT, whereas the efficacy of
therapist-delivered CBT appears to be reasonably estab-
lished. If audiologists are to deliver CBT, however, this
will require new investigation. Although the overall
quality of CBT studies is moderate, there is sufficient
consistency within these results to be confident of its
benefit for tinnitus intrusiveness. In terms of pharmaco-
therapy, only antidepressant use shows any evidence of
potential benefit.
