Abstract

Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) frequently experience depression and health care-related 
stigma. Health care satisfaction is important for seeking care, but little is known about SGM 
health care satisfaction, and especially as it relates to depression among rural SGM. From May 
25 to July 2, 2021, we surveyed rural Illinois (IL) individuals aged ≥18 years on the topics 
of demographics, depression, health care satisfaction, past health care experiences, internalized 
stigma, and victimization. Among the 398 respondents, the gender identity distribution included 
cisgender males and females (171 and 203, respectively) and transgender males and females (8 
and 7, respectively), while sexual orientation included heterosexuals (114), gay/lesbians (143), and 
other orientations (141). Analyses were conducted with respect to both identity and orientation 
(and their interaction). In univariate analysis, transgender individuals were more likely than 
cisgender to screen positive for depression and less likely to report feeling accepted by their 
medical provider. Compared to heterosexual respondents, gay/lesbians and other orientations 
were more likely to screen positive for depression. In logistic regression, factors associated 
with increased risk of depression included nonheterosexual orientation and past poor health care 
experiences. In linear regression, factors most commonly associated with the seven satisfaction 
subscales include: sexual orientation, past poor experiences, and employment. There were 
significant differences in depression across both sexual orientation and gender identity, and in 
health care satisfaction by sexual orientation. Rural SGMs are more vulnerable to depression and 
less likely to report satisfactory care. As health care engagement is critical for screening and care 
adherence, engaging rural SGM in a routine and satisfactory fashion is needed.

Individuals with a minoritized identity face an array of health disparities compared 
to their majority peers due to the increased burden of stress caused by stigma and 
discrimination (Bryant et al., 2022; Diaz et al., 2001). These tenets of minority stress 
theory also hold for sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals, who experience bi-/
homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of victimization due to their identity, appearance, 
and expression (Meyer, 1995). Individuals who have a nonheterosexual orientation and/or 
noncisgender identity (collectively referred to as SGMs) face distinct health disparities 
(Beach et al., 2018; Cathcart-Rake, 2018; Conron et al., 2010; Everett & Mollborn, 2013; 
Graham et al., 2011; Grundy et al., 2021; Lund & Burgess, 2021; Operario et al., 2015; 
Talley et al., 2019). Furthermore, disparities may be substantially nuanced, as both sexual 
orientation and gender identification may be complex constructs at the individual level and 
evolve over the life course. The SGM community, moreover, is not monolithic, and there are 
substantial differences in experiences and outcomes based on one’s sexual orientation and 
gender identity. For instance, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (sexual 
minority men; SMMs) are at heightened risk for HIV acquisition; bisexual populations 
face monosexism and are often excluded from both heterosexual and gay communities; and 
transgender individuals frequently experience challenges in accessing hormone replacement 
therapy and constantly face gender dysphoria due to misgendering (Ashley, 2019; Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019; Dodge et al., 2016; Rentería et al., 2022). These 
experiences are only magnified for individuals who are the intersection of multiple minority 
identities (Bowleg, 2008, 2012, 2020; Bowleg et al., 2003, 2013; Lee-Foon et al., 2022).

Stigma itself is a complex process, which may be enacted, internalized, and anticipated 
(Earnshaw et al., 2013; Goffman, 1963; Link & Phelan, 2001). Goffman et al. (1963) 
originally characterized stigma as the link between an attribute and a stereotype that 
“marks” the individual as “tainted and discounted.” Link & Phelan (2001) expanded on 
Goffman’s conceptualization to develop an understanding of how stigma may be enacted 
and anticipated, and how such discriminatory othering impacts the ways in which people 
can lead their lives). According to Link et al., the stigma process involves interconnected 
components: labeling; linking labels to negative stereotypes; a separation by creating an 
“us versus them”; and then ultimately a loss of status and discrimination. Labeling socially 
relevant characteristics (e.g., skin color, sexual orientation, gender identity) and attaching 
negative stereotypes to certain categories of people creates an us/them dichotomy in which 
those who are negatively labeled are seen as inherently different from those who are 
not so labeled. As socially salient differences are negatively labeled, those within the 
bounds of these socially defined categories become subject to separation, status loss, and 
discrimination.

The minority stress model and associated stigma is a useful framework to help explain 
disparities in health outcomes among SGM individuals. These stigmatizing experiences can 
negatively affect both mental and physical health (Castro et al., 2019; Flentje et al., 2022;

Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014; Layland et al., 2020). Adverse mental health outcomes are often 
observed resulting from stressful situations caused by stigma, and SGM individuals are 
more likely to experience substance (ab)use, depression, psychiatric disorders, self-harm, 
and suicide (Baptiste-Roberts et al., 2017; Healthy People, 2020; McLaughlin et al., 2010; 
Meyer, 2003; Pachankis et al., 2020; Remafedi et al., 1998). However, as described, 
SGM individuals are a heterogeneous population, as they also have other characteristics 
and identities. For example, SGM may differ in race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
and gender expression, to name a few. As such, there are potential differences in stigma 
experiences, and resulting health outcomes, across varying sexual and gender identities, and 
their intersections. For example, individuals who are bisexual experience increased rates of 
depression compared to gay and/or lesbian and heterosexual individuals, sexual minority 
individuals are more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexuals, and transgender identity 
is significantly associated with depression symptoms and suicide attempt (Ramchand et 
al., 2022; Ross et al., 2018; Su et al., 2016). In addition, SGM individuals have increased 
rates of pain-related impairment, troubles with sleep, diabetes, and cancer (Flentje et al., 
2022). While many adverse outcomes can be addressed within the context of primary 
medical care, SGM individuals often experience disparities in accessing high-quality and 
culturally affirming health care. Although sexual minority individuals have low uninsurance 
rates similar to heterosexual individuals (e.g., 12.7% vs. 11.4%), there are many differences 
within sexual minority groups and stark differences are seen between transgender and 
cisgender rates (Bosworth et al., 2021; Hsieh & Ruther, 2017). Furthermore, National Health 
Interview Survey data indicate that sexual minority individuals are more likely to delay care, 
less likely to have a usual source of care, and more likely to be concerned about medical 
bills than their heterosexual peers (Bosworth et al., 2021; Kachen & Pharr, 2020). Finally, 
and specific to the rural environment, a study of health care experiences among rural men 
who have sex with men (MSM) in Oklahoma found that care is influenced by religious 
conservative ideologies, clinician knowledge of SGM health issues (Giano, Hubach, et al., 
2020).

In addition to the direct influences of stigma on mental and physical conditions, it also 
impacts the seeking and obtaining of health care by SGM. While increased health-seeking 
behavior is associated with better health outcomes, individuals who identify as SGM 
often experience stigmatization in the health care setting (Hooper, 2016; Lin & Tsang, 
2020; Phelan et al., 2015; Whitehead et al., 2016). This contributes to lesser motivation 
to seek care, and greater delays in receiving care (Bosworth et al., 2021; Kachen & 
Pharr, 2020; Tadele & Amde, 2019). Even medical care engagement and receipt may 
be suboptimal, as SGMs often have concerns regarding confidentiality and acceptance, 
resulting in underreporting of illness and nondisclosure of risk behaviors (Bharadwaj et 
al., 2017; Picco et al., 2016; Tadele & Amde, 2019). Other indications of suboptimal care 
include findings that SGM may be less likely to receive multiple aspects of preventive care, 
such as screening for sexually transmitted infection (STI), cancer, and depression (Jenkins 
et al., 2021; Lee-Foon et al., 2022; Sha & Aleshire, 2021). Stigma thus threatens essential 
health care processes, such as diagnostics, treatment, and successful recovery. Addressing 
health care-related stigma may therefore improve the quality of SGM health care (Nyblade 
et al., 2019; Picco et al., 2016).

An understudied area within minority stress theory and stigma is health care patient 
satisfaction. Increased satisfaction is associated with lower odds of emergency department 
visits and greater adherence to physician recommendations (Fenton et al., 2012; Zolnierek & 
DiMatteo, 2009). Furthermore, addressing SGM health care satisfaction within the minority 
stress model has been described by Baptiste-Roberts et al. (2017); Bleich et al. (2009), and 
multiple care aspects relating to satisfaction (patient experience, patient expectations, and 
type of care) are amenable to intervention at the local/clinic level and among individual 
patients and clinicians. In this light, patient’s satisfaction may be a critical factor in 
increasing: SGM patient engagement with primary care; advocacy for routine and preventive 
services; and care adherence and retention to address identified issues. While it has been 
documented that SGMs are more likely to delay care than their non-SGM peers, there 
has been little examination of SGM health care satisfaction (Bosworth et al., 2021; Fish 
et al., 2021). An analysis of 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 
data, found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) orientation was associated with lower 
health care satisfaction (Blosnich, 2017). This has been complemented by more recent work 
reporting similar dissatisfaction with health care, lesser health care access, and increased 
rates of health care delay (Fish et al., 2021; Tabaac et al., 2020). Tabaac et al. (2020) 
specifically found that SGM care delay was at least partially associated with past poor health 
care experiences. Though unlikely to be a panacea, methods to increase SGM health care 
satisfaction may also address health care-related stigma and increase care access and use.

While the data to this point have discussed SGM stigma, health outcomes, and health care 
engagement in general terms, the focus of our work is in rural areas. The importance of 
addressing rural SGM health and health care is high, as SGMs are estimated to comprise 
3%–5% of the rural population (2.9–3.8 million individuals) (Movement Advancement 
Project [MAP], 2019). As may be intuited, there are substantial differences between rural 
communities and their urban/metropolitan peers. For example, rural SGMs are less likely 
to have explicit nondiscrimination protections and are more likely to live in areas with 
religious exemption laws—both of which may impact aspects of stigma and access to 
medical and social services (MAP, 2019). SGM-associated health care disparities may also 
be compounded as access in rural settings is notoriously low, with one study reporting that 
26% of rural residents had not received needed health care in the past few years (NPR 
et al., 2019). Furthermore, though ~19% of the U.S. population is rural, less than 12% of 
primary care physicians work in rural areas, and the majority of rural counties are primary 
care health professional shortage areas (Agency for Health care Research and Quality, 2018; 
AAMC, 2022; Rural Health Information Hub, 2019).

SGM living in rural areas may be especially impacted by stigma and minority stress. Past 
research has demonstrated that stigmatizing experiences in rural spaces are often more 
intense due to the small town feel and lesser inability to retain anonymity (Ezell et al., 2021; 
Walters et al., 2021). Specific to SGM stigma, research demonstrates that rural spaces have 
harsher social environments, and if a person reveals their SGM identity, they may experience 
higher levels of rejection than their urban counterparts (Giano, Currin, et al., 2022; Swank 
et al., 2012). In the health care environment, while disclosure of SGM identity may lead to 
better care and outcomes, many SGMs are hesitant to do so (Brooks et al., 2018). This may 
be exemplified by a study in rural Oklahoma reporting that “. . . the intersection of medical

care and faith within a clinic setting more often than not led to experiences where their 
sexual orientation was not valued and instead was perceived as problematic (Hubach et al., 
2019).” While many health care-related aspects of stigma may be effectively addressed via 
training and social interventions, they are infrequently implemented on large scales (Grundy 
et al., 2021).

There is relatively little know about health and health care utilization among rural SGM. In 
a general sense, rural SGM individuals may be more susceptible to some health conditions 
that are readily identified and addressed through routine screening (e.g., depression, cancer), 
but such individuals must access health care to be screened and retained in care to 
ensure adherence and more effective outcomes. Given specific health risks and health care 
disparities among SGM, perhaps compounded in rural environments, we sought to explore 
a common and important clinical condition and health care measure in a largely rural 
population. We chose to examine depression as it is: associated with stigma experienced by 
rural SGM; a top health concern for rural SGM; and is assessed with a relatively simple 
screening instrument (Camacho, 2012; Kroenke et al., 2003; Marsack & Stephenson, 2017). 
As depression requires a degree of care continuity for successful treatment, we chose to 
examine health care satisfaction as it is associated with care (Dang et al., 2013; Jacobs et 
al., 2017; Rossom et al., 2016; Thayaparan & Mahdi, 2013; Zolnierek & DiMatteo, 2009). 
To our knowledge, this is the first direct exploration of these factors among a largely rural 
population.

From May 25 to July 2, 2021, the ruralHarmony program utilized REDCap (Harris et 
al., 2009) to survey residents of southern Illinois (IL). Eligibility included age ≥ 18 years 
and residence in one of 25 study counties. The mean population within the composite 25 
counties is 19,406 (19 counties <25,000; range 3,650–66,879). The survey was promoted via 
our Facebook page and various social media by our community partners (The Community 
Action Place and Rainbow Cafe) and members of our Community Advisory Board. 
Participants received a US$20 gift card for their time.

Measures examined among all participants included demographics, depression (Patient 
Health Questionnaire 2 [PHQ-2]), and health care satisfaction (Patient Satisfaction 
Questionnaire 18 [PSQ-18]) (Kroenke et al., 2003; Thayaparan & Mahdi, 2013). The 
PHQ-2 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82) is a two-question instrument measuring the frequency 
of depressed mood and inability to feel pleasure (anhedonia) over the past 2 weeks. Each 
question has a score range of 0–3, and a total score ≥ 3 (of a possible 6) indicates major 
depressive disorder is likely. The PSQ-18 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.73) is an 18-question 
instrument measuring satisfaction across seven subscales (general satisfaction, technical 
quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects, time spent with doctor, and 
accessibility and convenience). Each question has a score of 1–5, scores are summarized 
both within subscales and across the entire instrument, and higher scores indicate increased 
satisfaction. Health care experiences were assessed by asking: Do you currently have health 
insurance or health care coverage? [CurrInsurance] and Have you had bad experiences 
with primary care such that you considered not going anymore? [PastPoorExp]. Additional

measures examined only among SGM included an additional health care experience 
question: Do you feel “accepted” and “nonjudged” during office visits? [Accepted?] and 
assessments of internalized stigma (five questions, range 1–5 from strongly disagree to 
strongly agree; Liu et al., 2009; Puckett et al., 2017) and experienced victimization (eight 
questions, range 0–1, no/yes; D’Augelli & Grossman, 2001). Both scales were modified and 
expanded to individually assess stigma and victimization associated with sexual orientation 
and gender identity (i.e., five questions assessing stigma associated with sexual orientation 
and the same five questions modified to address gender identity). Participants were given 
six options each for gender identity (cisgender male; cisgender female; transgender male; 
transgender female; genderqueer/gender-nonconforming; and another identity) and sexual 
orientation (heterosexual or straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, and other). For the 
purposes of this work and analysis, we examined participants from two perspectives (self-
reported gender identity and sexual orientation).

Descriptive statistics were used to compile and compare participant demographic data across 
categories. Bivariate analyses comparing independent variables to participants included 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square test. We performed multivariable modeling 
to explore the degree to which variables predicted depression, dichotomized as positive 
(score ≥3) or negative (score <3); logistic regression, and health care satisfaction subscales 
(continuous; general linear model). The full model examined all participants and the 
following variables: participant demographics (orientation, identity, orientation and identity 
interaction, race, employment and marital status, and educational attainment), county-level 
characteristics (total population, multidimensional deprivation index (MDI) rate), and two 
health care experiences. The interaction term between orientation and identity was also 
included to test the intersectional effects (Tsai & Venkataramani, 2016; Turan et al., 2019). 
The SGM model was limited to individuals of nonheterosexual orientation or noncisgender 
identity and included the aforementioned variables and others specific to SGM participants. 
While orientation and identity were retained in the models regardless of significance, all 
other variables were subject to backwards selection to obtain the final models presented in 
the results.

This project was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at Southern 
Illinois university School of Medicine (Springfield Committee for Research Involving 
Human Subjects: #21–808).

A total of 624 surveys were initiated. Incomplete surveys were discarded. For surveys with 
identical email addresses and/or participant names, we retained the first completed and 
discarded others, resulting in 398 unique survey responses from 22 counties. Nineteen of 
the counties had no urban population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010), and respondents from 
these counties comprised 83.4% of the total sample. Participants were stratified across two 
broad categories for parallel analysis (gender identity and sexual orientation). Distribution 
across gender identity was: cisgender male = 171; cisgender female = 203; transgender male 
= 8; transgender female = 7; and all others (e.g., genderqueer, multiple identities chosen) 
= 9. Participant distribution across sexual orientation was: heterosexual = 114; gay/lesbian

= 143; and all others (e.g., bisexual, pansexual) = 141 (Table 1). Mean age was 29.3 
(SD = 7.1) and did not significantly differ across either category groups, but there were 
significant differences for the other demographic variables (i.e., race and education across 
both categories, and employment and marital status across sexual orientation only).

We next examined measures and scales of mental health, health care experiences, health care 
satisfaction, internalized stigma (homophobia), and victimization. Transgender individuals 
more frequently reported having current insurance and past poor health care experiences 
(vs. cisgender; p = .003 and <.001, respectively); while gay/lesbian individuals also 
more frequently reported past poor health care experiences (versus heterosexual and other 
orientation; p < .001). Gay/lesbian individuals rated all seven health care satisfaction 
subscales significantly lower than heterosexual and other sexual orientation individuals (all 
p ≤ 0.001), but there were few differences across the gender identity groups (only Technical 
Quality and Access and Convenience). We find significant differences in mean PHQ-2 
scores, with the highest among transgender and nonheterosexual individuals (both p < .001; 
Table 2). The mean score for transgender males was 3.8, and all scored ≥ 3 (considered 
“positive” for depression). Finally, while there were significant differences in internalized 
stigma queries across both categories, the summary score was only significant across sexual 
orientation (higher among gay/lesbian vs. other; p = .002). The summary victimization score 
significantly differed across both categories, with highest scores among transgender females 
and gay/lesbians (both p < .001).

In the multivariable analysis for depression, the only significant variables for the full model 
were sexual orientation, gender identity, and past poor experiences (Table 3). Compared with 
heterosexuals, gay/lesbian and bisexual/other individuals had greater odds of depression 
(odds ratio [OR] = 3.1 and OR = 2.8, respectively). Similarly, elevated odds were seen 
among those reporting past poor experiences (OR = 3.5). Conversely, cisgender female 
participants had lower odds of depression than cisgender males (OR = 0.31). For the SGM 
model, greater odds were observed among those reporting past poor experiences (OR = 3.1) 
and victimization (OR = 1.3; increase for each incremental increase in score), and cisgender 
female identity was again associated with lower odds (OR = 0.22). As all transgender males 
were positive for depression, risk could not be accurately estimated.

In the multivariable analyses for health care satisfaction, sexual orientation was significantly 
associated with 11 of the 14 subscale models (full and SGM models for each of 
seven subscales), while gender identity and the orientation/identity interaction were only 
significant for a few (2 and 1 models, respectively; Table 4). For the full models, sexual 
orientation, past poor experiences and employment status were most frequently significant 
(6, 5, and 4 subscales, respectively), while for the SGM models fewer were significant, 
and the most frequent were feeling accepted and sexual orientation (7 and 5 subscales, 
respectively). The two subscales with the greatest number of significant independent 
variables were technical quality, and accessibility and convenience, each with six variables 
in the full model and five in the SGM model. These two subscales also had the highest R2 
value for full models (both at 0.19), while the highest R2 values for the SGM models were 
for the technical quality and communication subscales (both at 0.37).

Over an approximately 6-week period during the summer of 2021 we surveyed 398 
individuals across rural southern IL, including 110 individuals who identified as cisgender 
heterosexuals and 288 as SGMs. As sexual orientation and gender identity are distinct 
constructs, we utilized categorization methods explicit to each, and performed analyses 
to explore each individually, and their possible intersectionality, in regards to depression 
and health care satisfaction. Across gender identities, we observed differences in racial 
distribution and educational attainment; while across sexual orientation, we observed much 
the same, and also differences in marital and employment status.

Higher depression screening scores were strongly associated with SGM status, with mean 
scores significantly higher for transgender (vs. cisgender) individuals and gays/lesbians 
and others (vs. heterosexuals). The frequency of screening positives (i.e., PHQ-2 score ≥ 
3) for our population is substantially higher than that from other studies. For example, 
an analysis of the statewide Survey of the Health of Wisconsin data reported positives 
among non-LGB cisgender, LGB, and transgender individuals at 12.0%, 19.4%, and 8.9%, 
respectively (Jennings et al., 2019). Recategorizing our participants to match this method, 
we find positive screens at 12.7%, 32.2%, and 70.8%, respectively. Analysis of the 2016 
Minnesota Student Survey reported that 57.9% of noncisgender youth were positive for 
depression (Gower et al., 2018). A Canadian survey of SGM males reported positive screens 
at 12.5% for cisgender MSM (compared to 49.2% here) and 30.1% for transgender males 
and 33.3% for nonbinary (compared to 100% of transgender males here) (Rutherford et 
al., 2021). We thus find substantially higher rates of depression among SGM, and may be 
a reflection of the near-exclusively rural areas from which our participants were drawn. 
However, the relatively small number of transgender individuals in our work (n = 24) is 
a significant limitation to drawing firm comparisons and warrants further exploration. The 
multivariable model confirms increased risk of depression associated with nonheterosexual 
orientation, past poor health care experiences, and increasing instances of victimization.

Regarding health care satisfaction, to our knowledge, this is the first comparison across 
gender identities and sexual orientations. There was little variation across gender identities 
for the seven subscales, with mean scores ranging from 2.8 to 3.5 (possible range of 1–5). 
Only for Technical Quality and Accessibility and Convenience, there was a significant 
difference, with transgender males reporting lower scores. This is perhaps somewhat 
intuitive, as transgender males may seek more specialized care that is less available across 
rural communities. Across sexual orientation, we observed consistently significantly lower 
scores for each subscale reported by gay and lesbian persons. Perceived stigma may be 
a factor, however, the proportion of participants who reported that they had not disclosed 
their nonheterosexual orientation to their provided was nonsignificantly different between 
gay/lesbian individuals and other groups (though high at 44.7% and 40.0%, respectively). 
The multivariable model confirms the pervasive significance of sexual orientation, and 
lesser influence of gender identity, on health care satisfaction. Interestingly, the measure 
associated with rurality (total population) was only significant for Time Spent with Doctor 
and Accessibility and Convenience, possibly due to smaller clinics with fewer clinicians and

longer travel distances. Among the SGM participants, the measure of clinician acceptance 
was universally highly significant across all subscales.

There are several potential actions for consideration given these results. First, there should 
be new/renewed/invigorated efforts among primary care providers in rural areas in making 
their practice environment welcoming and affirming to SGM patients. One way to ensure 
affirming care is through medical education and teaching “structural competenc.” Metzl and 
Hansen (2014) lay out five areas for training that can improve clinicians’ understandings 
of how macro forces influence health outcomes, and as a result of this understanding, 
trains physicians to provide more culturally competent and less stigmatizing care (Metzl & 
Hansen, 2014). As the majority of rural areas are primary care health professional shortage 
areas, there less provider choice for patients, and hence responsibility for welcoming an 
affirming care is incumbent for each. Second, routine mental health screening and care 
should be adopted/maintained, for all patients, but especially for SGM who experience 
greater risk of depression. While screening instruments, such as the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, are 
readily routinized in the clinical environment, provision of care may be more difficult due 
to professional shortages. Clinical providers should continue to explore multiple aspects of 
such care provision, and telehealth-based care has been found effective and acceptable by 
SGM (Hubach et al., 2021). Authors’ previous work has found that telehealth expansion 
due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic increased care options for people who 
inject drugs, another highly stigmatized population, and thus, there is promise that telehealth 
can be expanded as a stigma reduction tool for other stigmatized groups (Walters et al., 
2022). Finally, rural clinician training (e.g., medical school, continuing education, ECHO-
based consultations) should purposefully address SGM health in general as an expected 
part of practice similar to more metropolitan areas, and specifically as it may relate to 
rural-specific implications, such as increase risk of depression and stigmatizing experiences. 
These actions would also likely influence patient satisfaction, thereby increasing the 
likelihood that rural SGM patients will both seek and be retained in care.

There are limitations to this work. First, as a cross-sectional survey, we cannot ascertain any 
temporal association. Second, although we purposively sought participants from a diversity 
of sexual orientations and gender identities, we were only able to survey a small number of 
noncisgender individuals and were limited in our ability to tease out differences between less 
frequently named sexual orientations (e.g., queer, questioning). However, this was one of the 
first studies of this kind in rural IL, and we view our findings as preliminary evidence of 
differences to be explored in future larger-scale studies. As with any survey, our study was 
likely impacted by both recall bias and social desirability bias. The former was addressed 
through time-linking all activities, while the latter was minimized through the anonymity of 
the survey. Finally, several of our measures inquired about general behaviors (e.g., health 
care access) rather than behaviors tied to specific conditions, so that, future research is 
needed to examine the nuances inherit within those behaviors.

To our knowledge, this was the first explicit examination of depression and health care 
access and satisfaction among rural SGM, with a cisgender heterosexual comparison group. 
We found significant differences in depression by sexual orientation and gender identity, 
and while such differences were expected, the rates of depression were significantly higher

than that reported elsewhere. Furthermore, we demonstrated that there are significant 
differences in health care satisfaction associated with sexual orientation, and also strongly 
and consistently associated with past poor health care experiences. We posit that there is 
need to specifically structure the health care encounter to be more respectful and affirming to 
nonheterosexual individuals, and that health care organization work with SGM community 
representatives and organizations to both revise their clinical model and engage in outreach 
to rural SGM who may have had past poor experiences. By changing the nature of how 
health care is provided and SGM patients are engaged, perhaps satisfaction can increase and 
better treatments and outcomes result for those with depression (and other conditions).
