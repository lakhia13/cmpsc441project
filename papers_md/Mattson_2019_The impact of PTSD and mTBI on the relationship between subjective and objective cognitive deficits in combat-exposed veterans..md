Abstract

Objective: Cognitive complaints, such as attentional or memory concerns, are commonly 
reported by veterans diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of mild 
traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The degree to which those complaints actually map on to 
measurable cognitive deficits is unclear and is likely complicated by the severity of trauma-related 
sequelae. In the present study we sought to characterize the degree to which PTSD symptoms and 
mTBI accounted for the relationship of subjective cognitive complaints to objective cognitive 
performance, with the goal of facilitating the accurate assessment of trauma-exposed veterans 
complaining of cognitive decline.

Method: A sample of 203 US military veterans previously deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan 
were assessed for PTSD severity, history of blast and impact mTBI, objective cognitive function, 
and subjective cognitive complaints. Separate mediation analyses were conducted to explore the 
degree that PTSD severity, blast mTBI severity, and impact mTBI severity influenced the 
association between subjective cognitive complaints and objective cognitive performance. Models 
reflecting significant mediation were followed by post-hoc moderated mediation analyses.

Results: Subjective cognitive complaints and objective cognitive performance were significantly 
associated (β [SE]= −6.49[2.85]; p=.03), but this relationship was mediated by PTSD severity (β 
[SE]= −2.95[2.86]; p=.30). PTSD mediation was not moderated by either blast or impact mTBI.

Conclusion: The present results delineate the prominent impact of PTSD symptoms, relative to 
blast and impact mTBI, on cognition following combat. These findings highlight the importance of 
assessing for trauma-related psychopathology in those seeking neuropsychological assessment or 
rehabilitative care for cognitive complaints.

Military personnel who serve in combat areas are at greater risk for both mild traumatic 
brain injury (mTBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than those without such

service (Combs et al., 2015). The incidence of mTBI and PTSD in returning combat 
veterans is roughly similar, around 12%–17% (Hoge, Terhakopian, Castro, Messer, & Engel, 
2007), and both conditions have been associated with cognitive difficulties, including 
impairments in attention, memory, and processing speed (Combs et al., 2015; Spencer, Drag, 
Walker, & Bieliauskas, 2010). The two conditions also frequently co-occur in combat 
veteran samples, with the presence of mTBI often (though not always) linked to worse 
PTSD outcomes, such as higher anxiety, functional limitations, and cognitive impairments 
(cf. Kontos et al., 2013; Ragsdale, Neer, Beidel, Frueh, & Stout, 2013; Brewin, Kleiner, 
Vasterling, & Field, 2007). The frequency and complexity of comorbid PTSD and mTBI 
place considerable burden on clinicians tasked with assessing and treating veterans who 
report cognitive symptomatology.

The difficulty of this task is compounded by the observed differences between subjective 
cognitive complaints (e.g. self-reported symptoms) and objective cognitive performance 
(e.g. results from a neuropsychological battery; Drag, Spencer, Walker, Pangilinan, & 
Bieliauskas, 2012; Vasterling, Brailey, Constans, & Sutker, 1998). Objective assessments of 
cognitive ability are typically time- and resource-intensive, meaning that self-reports are 
often the primary source of information available to clinicians (Spencer et al., 2010). 
However, the reliability of self-reported cognitive complaints has been called into question 
because the relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and objective cognitive 
performance is inconsistent (Spencer et al., 2010). There are many possibilities as to why the 
relationship between objective and subjective cognition remains unclear. Firstly, it is 
possible that unaccounted comorbidity, such as PTSD, depression, or chronic pain, could be 
confounding results (Gervais, Ben-Porath, & Wygant, 2009). There is also evidence that the 
context in which testing takes place (e.g., research vs. forensic) can impact results (Nelson et 
al., 2010). Additionally, while neuropsychological tests have been designed to identify 
cognitive impairment, they are typically administered in quiet environments free from 
distraction and are not designed to predict how individuals’ function in real-world settings 
(Limond & Adlam, 2001). Subjective cognitive complaints that were not corroborated by 
objective cognitive impairment have been observed in a multitude of health conditions, 
including depression (Chamelian & Feinstein, 2006; Srisurapanont, Suttajit, Eurviriyanukul, 
& Varnado, 2017), multiple sclerosis (Middleton, Denney, Lynch, & Parmenter, 2006), 
bipolar disorder (Svendsen, Kessing, Munkholm, Vinberg, & Miskowiak, 2012), and mTBI 
(French, Lange, Brickell, & Psych, 2014; Nelson et al., 2012; Spencer et al., 2010). Similar 
findings have been found in veteran samples, with many who report cognitive complaints 
performing well within normal limits on measures of objective cognition (Drag et al., 2012; 
Spencer et al., 2010; French et al., 2014). These studies support the notion that subjective 
cognitive complaints are tenuously coupled with objective cognitive performance, which 
may undermine rehabilitative interventions targeting cognition (Basford & Malec, 2015).

Understanding the factors that mediate the relationship between subjective and objective 
cognition is a necessary step to help clinicians provide more effective and efficient 
interventions. Growing evidence suggests that trauma-related sequelae, such as the 
symptoms associated with PTSD and mTBI, may play a crucial role. Seal and colleagues 
(2016) found that perceptions of cognitive problems were strongly associated with post-
traumatic cognitions about the self, world, and trauma coping self-efficacy, suggesting that

negative perceptions of cognitive functioning may represent a specific type of post-traumatic 
appraisal. In a sample of Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF/OIF) 
veterans, self-reports of cognitive complaints were significantly correlated with 
psychological distress and were not significantly correlated with overall neurocognitive 
functioning (French et al., 2014). Moreover, in a sample of 167 OEF/OIF veterans, 
psychological distress has been shown to mediate the relationship between injury 
characteristics and subjective ratings of cognition (Drag et al., 2012). These results suggest 
that trauma-related psychopathology can play a prominent role in perceived cognitive 
deficits, though the precise nature of these contributions is not well defined, nor is it known 
what additive role mTBI may play.

The present study aimed to address this uncertainty by examining the role that PTSD and 
history of mTBI have on the equivocal relationship between subjective cognitive complaints 
and objective cognitive performance. Based on the literature that links mTBI to worse 
cognitive symptoms in cases of PTSD, we aimed to establish a mechanism by which mTBI 
and PTSD symptoms may combine to influence subjective and objective cognition. This 
approach will help examine how psychological and physiological processes work 
independently and in conjunction to influence the presentation of cognitive symptoms in 
combat veterans. Identifying a moderating or mediating role in this sample would provide 
clinicians with critical evidence to help in the conceptualization of cognitive impairment, 
particularly when subjective complaints are central to the patient’s presentation.

METHOD

Participants

The study initially enrolled 221 combat exposed OEF, OIF, and Operation New Dawn 
(OND) veterans (mean age= 33.40, SD=0.24, 94% male) who completed study procedures 
at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System (MVAHCS). Overall, 72% of participants 
identified as Caucasian, 3% African American, 3% Native American, 2% Hispanic, and 20% 
Mixed Race/Other. Participants who self-reported experiencing mTBI were specifically 
recruited, alongside a more general population of service members and veterans. Following 
a review of computerized records and a clinical screening (including the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV-TR, First & Gibbon, 2004), participants were excluded if they had 
lifetime history of moderate or severe TBI, a significant non-TBI neurological condition 
(e.g., epilepsy or seizures, history of stroke, neurodegenerative disease), current psychotic 
symptoms, an unstable medical condition that could affect brain function (e.g. diabetes), or 
current substance abuse or dependence. The study protocol was approved by the MVAHCS 
institutional review board.

Measures

Post-traumatic Stress Disorder—PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician 
Administered PTSD Scale for DSMIV (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995). The CAPS was 
administered through a structured clinician-administered interview covering 17 PTSD 
symptoms as outlined in DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Participants 
were asked to identify an index trauma which was not limited to deployment-related events.

Questions corresponding to DSM-IV PTSD symptoms were then asked, with answers scored 
separately for frequency and intensity using a 5-point scale (0–4). Symptom severity for 
each item is determined by summing both frequency and intensity scores. Continuous scores 
of current PTSD severity were used in all analyses. Lifetime vs. current PTSD symptoms are 
reported for descriptive purposes only.

Assessment of mTBI—Symptoms of mTBI across the lifespan were assessed by 
interview using the Minnesota Blast Exposure Screening Tool (MN-BEST; Nelson, Hoelzle, 
McGuire, Ferrier-Auerbach, et al., 2011) to provide a total symptom profile of primary blast-
related and primary impact-related mTBI. An mTBI was considered to be blast-related if it 
followed a direct or indirect exposure to an explosion (e.g., improvised explosive device or 
mortar explosion), whether or not there was a secondary impact with an object (e.g. hitting 
the head on the ground following an explosion). An mTBI was considered impact-related if 
it involved concussive force between the head and an object in the absence of a blast (e.g., 
physical assault or automotive accident). Severity of mTBI was classified based on the rating 
scheme outlined by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM; Kay, 
Harrington, & Adams, 1993) including loss of consciousness (LOC) for no more than 30 
minutes and post-traumatic amnesia for no more than 24 hours. Information was also 
gathered regarding time since injury, approximate proximity to blast, and neurological 
symptoms following injury such as headaches, nausea, and sensitivity to light or noise. 
Trained neuropsychologists then assigned ratings for each possible concussive event ranging 
from 0 (no brain injury) to 3 (severe concussion symptoms). Separate severity scores for 
blast mTBI and impact mTBI were then calculated by summing the three most significant 
blast and impact events.

Subjective Cognitive Complaints—The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF; Gervais et al., 2009) cognitive complaints 
(COG) scale was utilized to assess self-reported cognitive difficulties. The COG scale 
consists of 10 items describing various symptoms such as difficulty with memory, 
concentration, forgetfulness, reading comprehension, frustration, and poor tolerance for 
stress. Scores of 65–80T are associated with reports of diffuse cognitive difficulties, while 
scores at or above 81T indicate more pronounced cognitive complaints such as confusion, 
impaired memory, and poor concentration (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008).

Objective Cognitive Performance—Participants completed a neuropsychological 
battery to evaluate cognitive performance. Assessments in this battery included the 
California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 2000) which 
measures episodic verbal learning and memory, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 
(WAIS-III; Wechsler, 1997) Coding & Digit Span subsets which measure working memory, 
visual processing speed, verbal and performance IQ. The Trail Making Test (TMT; Bowie & 
Harvey, 2006) was included to measure visual attention (TMT-A) and task switching (TMT-
B). Each measure was included in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to form a single 
latent factor of general cognition with excellent overall model fit (RMSEA < 0.001, 
CFI>0.999, SRMR = 0.020).

Validity—Previous studies have shown insufficient effort can account for a significant 
proportion of variance in overall cognitive test performance in OEF/OIF veterans with mTBI 
(Nelson et al., 2010). To assess for engagement during cognitive testing, four effort 
measures were administered, and participants whose performance failed to meet effort 
thresholds on more than one of the tasks were also excluded from subsequent analyses. 
Effort measures and thresholds were as follows: Victoria Symptom Validity Test (43 or 
fewer correct answers; Jones, 2013); WAIS-III Digit Span (scaled score of 5 or lower; 
Babikian, Boone, Lu, & Arnold, 2006; DeJong & Donders, 2009; Young, Sawyer, Roper, & 
Baughman, 2012); CVLT-II Forced Choice measure (raw score of 14 or lower; Moore & 
Donders, 2009; Root, Robbins, Chang, & Van Gorp, 2006) TMT-A task (48 seconds or 
higher; (Iverson, Lange, Green, & Franzen, 2002). In addition, participants were excluded 
from subsequent analyses if their MMPI-2-RF profiles were invalid based on any of the 
following criteria: VRIN-r > 80, TRIN-r > 80, F-r = 120, Fp-r > 100, L-r > 80, K-r > 70 
(Ben-Porath 2012).

Of 221 participants who originally completed the cognitive battery, 13 (5.80%) were 
excluded due to invalid MMPI-2-RF profiles. Five participants (2.37%) were excluded due 
to failing more than one effort measure, with 3 failing two effort measures and 2 failing 
three effort measures. After excluding these 18 participants for invalidity or insufficient 
effort, 203 participants were included in the final analyses.

Analytic Approach—PTSD severity and variables reflecting each participant’s blast 
mTBI and impact mTBI experience were tested separately for possible mediation using 
10,000 bootstrapped samples to assess the indirect effect of mediators on the relationship 
between objective cognitive performance and subjective cognitive complaints. Mediation 
analyses that reached statistical significance were followed by post hoc moderated mediation 
analysis using the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2018) in SPSS, where the remaining variables 
were tested to determine their impact on the mediational relationship. Importantly, the 
present study uses well-validated measures, and all analyses were limited to veterans who 
demonstrated acceptable symptom and performance validity, which increases the reliability 
of the findings.

RESULTS

Assessment Outcomes

Results are based on the 203 valid participants. Based on the CAPS interview, 104 
participants (51%) met criteria for current or lifetime history of PTSD. Based on the MN-
BEST assessment, 156 participants endorsed at least one mTBI, with 22 endorsing two, 42 
endorsing three, and 82 endorsing four or more mTBIs. Both mTBI and PTSD were 
assessed across the entire lifetime, and were not limited specifically to deployment-related 
events. For the MMPI-2-RF COG scale, 63 participants scored above the 65-point cutoff 
(reflecting diffuse cognitive difficulties) and 29 scored above the 81-point cut off (reflecting 
pronounced cognitive problems; Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008). The 18 participants that 
were excluded due to invalidity or insufficient effort did not differ significantly in terms of 
age, race, years of education, CAPS score, or MN-BEST score from those included in the

analyses. See Table 1 for complete summary statistics of participants who were included in 
the analyses.

Mediation Models

PTSD severity, blast mTBI, and impact mTBI were tested as individual mediators of the 
objective - subjective cognition relationship. As depicted in Figure 1, objective cognitive 
performance was significantly associated with PTSD symptoms (Path A) and with subjective 
cognitive complaints (Path C). Participants with greater PTSD severity were likely to report 
greater cognitive complaints (Path B). The indirect effect of objective cognition and 
subjective cognitive complaints through PTSD was significant (Path AB). Consequently, 
when PTSD severity was included in this model, the relationship between objective and 
subjective cognition was no longer significant (Path C′). The overall bootstrap analysis of 
the indirect effect was significant, indicating PTSD severity mediated the relationship 
between objective and subjective cognition.

The same steps were repeated in examining the mediating effect of blast mTBI on subjective 
and objective cognition. The analysis indicated the relationship between objective cognition 
and blast mTBI was not significant (β [SE]= −0.13[0.45], p=.77; 95% CI [−1.18, 0.51]) and 
blast mTBI was not associated with subjective cognitive complaints (β [SE]= −0.18[−0.45], 
p= .69; 95% CI [−14.59, 2.82]). Furthermore, a bootstrap analysis indicated that blast mTBI 
did not have a significant mediating effect (95% CI [−0.54, 1.20]).

The possible mediating effects of impact mTBI between objective and subjective cognition 
was analyzed next. The relationship between objective cognition and impact mTBI was not 
significant (β [SE]= 0.43[0.50], p=.33; 95% CI [−0.50, 1.48]). The association between 
impact mTBI and subjective cognitive complaints was not significant [SE]= 0.23[0.35], p=.
51; 95% CI [−0.46, 0.93]). The bootstrap analysis revealed impact mTBI did not mediate the 
relationship between objective and subjective cognition (95% [−12.51, −0.72]).

We next aimed to examine the hypothesis that the mTBI variables would moderate the 
mediating relationship of PTSD severity on subjective and objective cognition. When blast 
mTBI was added to the model as a moderator (see Figure 2), there was no significant 
interaction between blast mTBI and objective cognitive performance on PTSD severity 
(Interaction 1), nor was there a significant interaction between blast mTBI and PTSD 
severity on subjective cognitive complaints (Interaction 2). These results indicate that blast 
mTBI did not have a moderating effect on the mediating role of PTSD (Paths A and B).

Next, impact TBI was tested for moderated mediation using the same procedure (see Figure 
3). When impact mTBI was added to the model as a moderator, there was no significant 
interaction between impact mTBI and objective cognitive performance on PTSD severity 
(Interaction 1), nor was there a significant interaction between impact mTBI and PTSD 
severity on subjective cognitive complaints (Interaction 2). As such, there is no indication 
that impact mTBI moderated the mediating role of PTSD (Paths A and B).

DISCUSSION

Page 7

The aim of this study was to examine what role common sequalae of combat exposure have 
on the relationship between actual cognitive performance and perceptions of cognitive 
ability in OEF/OIF veterans. We demonstrated that although self-reported cognitive 
symptoms were in fact associated with lower performance on objective measures of 
cognition, this relationship could be accounted for by PTSD symptoms. Even though 
previous studies have found that a history of mTBI may impact the severity of cognition-
related PTSD symptoms (Donnelly, Donnelly, Warner, Kittleson, & King, 2018) we failed to 
identify any significant moderation of mTBI (impact or blast) on the mediating effect PTSD 
severity has between subjective cognitive complaints and objective cognitive performance.

Previous research suggests mTBI may exacerbate PTSD severity, specifically in the 
cognitive domains of concentration, memory, decision-making and processing speed 
(Donnelly et al., 2018; Nelson et al., 2015), but that relationship was not observed in the 
present study. The lack of moderation or mediation involving mTBI indices could be due to 
multiple reasons. It is possible that any cognitive symptoms following an mTBI may 
dissipate in the acute recovery stage and therefore have minimal impact on subjective 
cognitive complaints. Therefore, it is likely that any lingering cognitive impairment may be 
driven more so by psychological, rather than physiological factors. PTSD severity has been 
shown to impact negative self-focused thoughts including self-criticism and beliefs about 
self-efficacy (Samuelson et al., 2017; Spencer et al., 2010) either of which could bias self-
assessment of cognitive ability. Samuelson and colleagues (2017) suggested that negative 
posttraumatic appraisals may influence one’s perceptions of memory and attention 
functioning. Although there is considerable evidence suggesting that the effects of mTBI 
dissipate within approximately 3 months (McCrea et al., 2009), a recent review 
incorporating complicated and uncomplicated mTBI suggests that recovery time may be 
longer in many cases (McInnes et al., 2017). Future research investigating psychological 
processes following mTBI, such as how self-efficacy and self-referential processes influence 
self-reported cognition, could help clinicians understand the etiological factors contributing 
to cognitive complaints, thus improving the efficiency of clinical services by cutting down 
on unnecessary assessments and treatments.

The mediating role of PTSD severity between subjective and objective cognition highlights 
the importance of recognizing the distinction that exists between cognitive symptoms (i.e. 
those that impact an individual’s life) and cognitive impairments (i.e. those assessed by 
neuropsychological battery). By recognizing the mediating role of PTSD severity, we hope 
to emphasize that the two constructs are discrete phenomena that, while frequently 
coinciding, ought not to be conflated. Both symptoms and impairments have a place in the 
clinical conceptualization process. This can serve as an important point of psychoeducation 
for clinicians as they assist veterans to understand their difficulties during the therapeutic 
process. For example, clinicians might encourage patients that they can anticipate 
improvement in cognitive symptoms coincident with greater management of PTSD 
symptoms.

Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, the cross-sectional design of this 
study makes it difficult to infer causality from the relationships presented. Many of the 
reported mTBIs took place during incidents that would meet criteria for a traumatic event, 
thus complicating the ability to retrospectively discern the relative contributions of each 
event. Future longitudinal studies may allow for modeling the impact of both processes over 
time, which could then facilitate more causal interpretations. Second, mTBI data was based 
on retrospective self-report of events that may have taken place many years prior to the time 
of the assessment. Although this limitation was offset by the use of trained 
neuropsychologists, the reliability of self-reported recollections can be compromised, 
particularly when alterations to cognition (such as loss of consciousness) are involved. 
Third, data was not collected reflecting each veteran’s military and post-military experience, 
such as length of service, duty status, age at deployment, and service-connected disability. 
Such factors may plausibly influence cognitive performance, though we expect that any 
cases of exaggerated or underreported symptoms would have likely been excluded based on 
validity criteria. Lastly, information regarding chronicity of PTSD symptoms was not 
collected. Previous research has linked cognitive performance to PTSD duration and course 
(Johnsen & Asbjornsen, 2008; Vasterling et al., 2018) and inadequate termination of stress 
responses may result in biological alterations resulting in long-term consequences (Yehuda, 
2000; Kitayama et al., 2005). However, data on time since deployment was collected, and 
since most index traumas occurred during deployment, this is at least a rough proxy of the 
association we might expect to see between chronicity and cognitive symptoms. When 
examined, however, there was no association between time since deployment and either 
objective cognition (p= .94) or subjective cognition (p= .45). Future research would benefit 
from investigating longitudinal changes in cognitive performance, with emphasis on how 
changes relate to chronicity of PTSD symptoms.

Nevertheless, the present results can play a key role in the assessment and case 
conceptualization of those experiencing comorbid mTBI and PTSD. Such patients 
frequently report cognitive problems, and providers often struggle with how to interpret self-
reports due to potential bias and inconsistencies. Some patients may also be aware of how 
their diagnosis can impact their memory and attention and be especially vigilant of any 
perceived deficits. The present results reaffirm the importance of a broad and comprehensive 
assessment for those reporting cognitive complaints after trauma, with a particular emphasis 
on the diagnosis and treatment of trauma-related psychopathology as a primary intervention.

Public Significance Statement:

This study outlines how the relationship between cognitive complaints and cognitive 
performance may be attributable to trauma-related psychopathology, such as 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), in combat 
veterans. This result emphasizes the importance of assessing for the psychological impact 
of trauma as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, as it may prove to 
be a more salient and promising target for rehabilitative care for those reporting 
subjective complaints.
