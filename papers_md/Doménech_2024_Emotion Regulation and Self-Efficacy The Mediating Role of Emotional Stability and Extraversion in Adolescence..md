Abstract: The feeling of emotional self-efficacy helps people understand how to handle positive
and negative emotions. Emotion regulation is the process that helps people control their emotions
so that they can adapt to the demands of the environment. This study has a twofold aim. First, it
examines the relationships among emotion regulation, the personality traits of extraversion and
emotional stability, and the feeling of emotional self-efficacy for positive and negative emotions in an
adolescent population. Second, it examines the mediating role of personality traits (extraversion and
emotional stability) in the relationship between emotion regulation and emotional self-efficacy for
positive and negative emotions. The participants were 703 adolescents (49.9% male and 50.1% female)
aged between 15 and 18 years (M = 15.86, SD = 0.30). Significant relationships were observed among
emotion regulation, the personality traits of extraversion and emotional stability, and emotional
self-efficacy for positive and negative emotions. The structural equation model confirmed the direct
link between emotion regulation and emotional self-efficacy and mediation by the personality traits
of extraversion and emotional stability. This study confirms that emotional self-efficacy is connected
to the emotion regulation strategies that adolescents use. Effective emotion regulation encourages
self-perception and emotional coping. The results are discussed in connection to previous research.

1. Introduction

In everyday life, people must deal with emotionally charged situations that can cause
stress and a lack of efficacy in decision making. These situations have a particularly strong
impact in adolescence, a period of physiological and associated psychological, emotional,
and behavioural changes [1]. These changes create instability and variations in personality
traits, even potentially evolving towards a negative personality [2]. Such changes can occur
in the process of transition into adulthood and can stay with people for the rest of their lives.
Therefore, the ability of adolescents to manage everyday situations effectively and achieve
the desired outcome will help them in the process of self-management (as agentic beings)
to ensure the sound development of beliefs of emotional efficacy [3]. This emotional self-
efficacy can influence the types of goals people set for themselves and even their professions
as adults [4]. In addition, personality traits play a role in the way in which people deal with
problems. Extraversion and emotional stability (or conversely neuroticism) are the two
personality traits that most greatly enable adaptation to the demands of the environment [5]
and that share the strongest relationship with emotional self-efficacy [6].

In this context, it is considered that emotion regulation, as a process that helps control
emotions, will play a key role. Individuals who are able to regulate their emotional state
will mature in a more adaptive manner in their environment. Overall, it will increase
their degree of personal and social well-being [7]. Consequently, it could be instructive to

conduct an analysis of these aspects during adolescence, a period of change and instability
in personality traits. Specifically, an analysis of the relationships between the ability for
emotion regulation and the development of feelings of emotional self-efficacy, as well as
the mediating role of the personality traits of emotional stability and extraversion, can
provide insight into the importance of encouraging the development of an emotionally
stable personality and the ability to externalise feelings and emotions effectively. This
process can have benefits in terms of interactions with others, given that the belief of being
effective in emotion management can play a role [8,9].

Studies have shown the direct relationships between self-efficacy and positive and
negative emotion regulation strategies [10]. However, the mediating role of emotional
stability and extraversion in this relationship remains unknown. The present study attempts
to fill this gap. The results provide insight into the importance of encouraging strategies
aimed at developing these two personality traits in adolescence, a period of change that
leads to a degree of immaturity in personality traits [11,12] before these traits stabilise and
remain throughout adulthood [13]. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse the role
of emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) as a predictor
of self-efficacy for positive and negative emotions, as well as the mediating role of the
personality traits of emotional stability and extraversion.

1.1. Personality and Emotional Self-Efficacy

Personality traits are defined as relatively stable patterns of thought, feelings, and
behaviour in an individual [14]. However, in early adolescence, an individual’s personality
becomes unstable [15]. Personality traits change in the opposite way, becoming less ma-
ture until adulthood, when they mature again [2,13,16,17]. Adolescence is characterised
by changes in personality traits [11,12]. As a result, behavioural patterns and forms of
temperament gradually establish themselves in relation to the environment [18].

Social cognitive theory suggests that personality traits are shaped by multiple pro-
cesses. These processes include the generalisation of skills and self-awareness, which form
through interactions between a person and the environment, as well as transitions in life.
These traits ultimately become behavioural patterns [19]. The five-factor model refers to
five big traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism (vs. emotional
stability), and openness to experience. There are also superficial traits or expressions of per-
sonality referring to people’s beliefs, abilities, values, and attitudes. These values depend
on core structures, but they are flexible and can be shaped by environmental influences [20].
This superficial group includes self-evaluations of efficacy, which help create awareness of
how to manage positive and negative emotions [8].

Two of the big five personality traits, extraversion and neuroticism (vs. emotional
stability), predict positive and negative emotional states [21]. In this model, neuroticism is
the opposite of emotional stability. Extraversion and emotional stability enable adaptation
to the demands of the environment [5]. Extroverts tend to have positive emotional states
and are satisfied with life. In contrast, neurotic people tend to be in a negative emotional
state, among other reasons because they focus on negativity, which makes them more prone
to stimuli that cause negative emotions [22]. Also, people with high levels of emotional
stability have more resources to tackle negative emotional states [23,24].

Emotional stability and extraversion tend to encourage people to seek a greater con-
nection to their environment. People with high levels of emotional stability have resources
to relate to others via assertive attitudes that help them defend their needs. Extroverts
seek social interactions and others with whom to relate [19,25]. They take an interest in
their company and tend to be assertive [26]. Thus, both of these personality traits can
play a crucial role in social relations and in the search for solutions to day-to-day events
that lead to tension, which are widely present in adolescents’ academic and occupational
environments [5].

Emotional self-efficacy is defined as people’s belief in their capacity to achieve pro-
posed goals efficiently and achieve desired outcomes [27]. Social cognitive theory draws

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 206

on an agentic perspective, in which agency works through a process of causality, involv-
ing personal, behavioural, and environmental factors [3]. In this process, people actively
shape the course of their lives. Hence, they can anticipate the consequences of their ac-
tions to guide them towards plans of action, supported by a process of reflection and
self-regulation [27]. Achieving goals largely depends on self-efficacy, which defines the
course of action in a process of self-management of psychosocial functioning [28]. This
self-efficacy also influences motivation and perseverance in the face of difficulties, as well
as the expectations of outcomes [29]. Beliefs and the process of self-regulation also influence
the sense of achievement or failure [3]. While experiencing achievement, a person’s feeling
of self-efficacy grows, while motivation, capacity, and interest in the task all improve too.
This occurs via cognitive, motivational, affective, and decision-making mechanisms [27].
The experience of failure may have a negative impact on the feeling of self-efficacy and
may reduce interest and motivation to achieve proposed goals [29].

The feeling of efficacy that accompanies achievement or failure Is associated with
positive and negative emotions. Self-efficacy for positive emotions refers to a person’s
perceived ability to express emotions such as happiness, enthusiasm, and pride as a result
of success and pleasurable events. Self-efficacy for negative emotions refers to a person’s
perceived capacity to handle and improve emotions such as anger, distress, irritation,
or dejection, expecting negative results [1]. Authors have noted the need for further
research into connections between personality traits, emotional self-efficacy, and emotion
regulation [8].

Furthermore, the different strategies for handling emotions are related to personality
traits [30] and emotional self-efficacy [6]. Studies have shown that self-efficacy and emotion
regulation link certain personality traits such as extraversion and neuroticism (vs. emotional
stability) to a better quality of life because they are associated with positive emotionality
and more active and dynamic procedures [31].

1.2. Emotion Regulation

Emotion regulation is a process that helps people control their emotions to adapt
to the demands of their environment [32]. It involves handling positive and negative
emotions [33]. The process model of emotion regulation [34,35] divides the strategies
of emotion regulation into two groups: one focusing on antecedents of the emotional
experience and another on responses [33–35]. Antecedent-focused strategies are activated
before the emotional experience occurs, such as cognitive reappraisal. In contrast, response-
focused strategies are to those that are activated once the emotional process has begun,
such as expressive suppression [9].

Cognitive reappraisal is considered an adaptive strategy linked to better social rela-
tions [7], better interpersonal functioning [9,36], and higher levels of positive affect [37].
Conversely, expressive suppression is considered a maladaptive strategy related to greater
difficulties in establishing social relations and a lower level of well-being [38–40]. Some
studies of adolescence have linked expressive suppression to emotional dysregulation and
cognitive reappraisal to adaptive emotional coping [40]. Other studies have linked high
scores in expressive suppression and low scores in cognitive reappraisal to problematic
types of behaviour in an academic environment [41]. Despite these results, expressive
suppression can be adaptive in preschool environments [42], even though it becomes
maladaptive in the long term [43].

1.3. Emotion Regulation, Emotional Self-Efficacy, and Personality

Empirical evidence has confirmed the connections between emotional self-efficacy
and emotion regulation. It has been observed that emotional self-efficacy is related pos-
itively to cognitive reappraisal but negatively to expressive suppression [10]. Moreover,
the way in which self-efficacy is evaluated is important in understanding the process of
emotion regulation [44,45]. Bujor and Turliuc [46] found that, in addition to reducing
the intensity of negative emotions, cognitive reappraisal also boosted positive emotions,

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 206

whereas expressive suppression could be an efficient way of regulating the expression but
not the experience of emotions. High scores in expressive suppression are associated with
greater negative affect and lower positive affect [38,47,48]. Emotional self-efficacy refers to
individuals’ perceptions of their emotional management, while emotion regulation refers
to how individuals manage their emotions [8,9]. Although these variables are both related
to emotions, self-efficacy is a belief about emotional management, whereas regulation is
the way individuals act when faced with their emotions. Emotional self-efficacy distin-
guishes between positive and negative emotions. In contrast, emotion regulation focuses
on the strategies used to manage those emotions. Emotion regulation focuses on cognitive
reappraisal and expressive suppression strategies, while emotional self-efficacy focuses
on emotional management beliefs regarding positive and negative emotions. Therefore, it
is important to understand the relationship between emotional self-efficacy and emotion
regulation [8].

Research into relationships between personality traits and emotional self-efficacy has
confirmed that high scores in self-efficacy are related to high scores in extraversion and
low scores in neuroticism [6]. People with higher scores in neuroticism (or low scores
in emotional stability) are easily irritable and respond unsuitably to stressful factors of
negative affect [49]. Furthermore, they have difficulties in regulating negative emotions [50].
Neuroticism is strongly and negatively correlated with self-efficacy in coping with negative
emotions of anger, irritation, despair, and distress, although it does not appear to have such
a strong link to self-efficacy for positive emotions [45].

In addition, high levels of emotional stability are related to self-efficacy for negative
as well as positive emotions [51]. People with high emotional stability tend to experience
negative emotions of anger, sadness, and emotional distress at lower levels than those with
low emotional stability [46]. Furthermore, emotional stability is positively correlated with
self-efficacy for the negative emotions of despair and distress [52]. Meanwhile, high scores
in extraversion are associated with experiences of positive affect [53]. For instance, Shi
et al. [52] found a significant positive correlation between extraversion and self-efficacy for
positive emotions.

2. Aims and Hypotheses

This study has a twofold aim: (i) to analyse the relationships among emotional self-
efficacy for positive and negative emotions, emotion regulation, and the personality traits
of extraversion and emotional stability in an adolescent population; and (ii) to verify
the mediating role of these two personality traits in relation to emotion regulation and
self-efficacy for positive and negative emotions, following the suggestions of Caprara
et al. [8]. The goal is thus to observe whether extraversion and emotional stability mediate
the relationship between emotion regulation and emotional self-efficacy.

Extraversion and neuroticism were included as mediating variables for two reasons.
First, extraversion and neuroticism have direct effects on positive and negative affect,
whereas openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness may have an instrumental (indi-
rect) effect on positive and negative affect [54]. These findings from the literature justify the
use of these two variables as mediating variables [54]. Additionally, neuroticism increases
during adolescence, especially among girls [2,16]. Moreover, previous studies have used
extraversion and neuroticism as mediating variables [55–57]. Second, personality variables
are unstable during adolescence [12,15], as can also be observed in our research. They have
been found to have standard deviations of 1.28 and 1.20. Thus, if they present variability,
they cannot be considered constants. Based on the previous findings and a review of the
literature, it is hypothesised that the following relationships will hold in adolescence:

H1. Positive relationships will be observed among cognitive reappraisal, the personality traits
of emotional stability and extraversion, and self-efficacy. Cognitive reappraisal will be related to
self-efficacy for both positive and negative emotions.

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 206

H2. Expressive suppression will be negatively related to positive emotional self-efficacy and
positively related to self-efficacy for negative emotions.

H3. Emotion regulation will influence self-efficacy of positive and negative emotions (despair and
distress; anger and irritation).

H4. The personality factors of extraversion and emotional stability will act as mediating variables
between emotion regulation and self-efficacy for positive and negative emotions (despair and distress;
anger and irritation).

3. Methods
3.1. Participants

The participants were 703 adolescents (49.9% male and 50.1% female) aged between 15
and 18 years (M = 15.86, SD = 0.30). The age distribution of the sample was as follows: 35.7%
were 15 years old, 46.2% were 16 years old, 13.9% were 17 years old, and 4.1% were 18 years
old. All the adolescents were studying either in the last year of compulsory secondary
education (49.6%) or in the post-16 baccalaureate (50.4%) in the Spanish province of Valencia.
Finally, 49.5% studied in state schools, and 50.5% studied in private or subsidised schools.

3.2. Instruments

Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) [9] (Spanish adaptation by [36]).
This instrument evaluated the two strategies of emotion regulation: cognitive reap-
praisal and expressive suppression. A seven-point Likert scale was used, ranging from
1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree). Cognitive reappraisal had a Cronbach’s alpha
score of 0.80, and expressive suppression had a Cronbach’s alpha score of 0.74. These
values were similar to those for the Spanish validation (α = 0.79 for cognitive reappraisal
and α = 0.75 for expressive suppression) [36]. The instrument had 10 items. An example
item was “When I want to feel the most positive emotion (such as joy or fun), can I change
what I am thinking?” and “I keep my emotions to myself”.

Ten-Item Personality Inventory, TIPI [57].
This brief measuring instrument was used for the big five domains of personality
traits [57]. It evaluated the personality traits of extraversion (enthusiastic), agreeableness
(affectionate), conscientiousness (reliable and self-disciplined), emotional stability (not
easily irritated), and openness to experiences (inquisitive). A seven-point Likert scale was
used, ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree). It consisted of 10 items. An
example item was “Calm, emotionally stable” for emotional stability and “Extraverted,
enthusiastic” for extraversion. This questionnaire has been widely accepted for use in
scientific research and has provided results comparable to other more extensive personality
questionnaires [57,58]. It was conceptualised in terms of the domains of behaviour from
behaviour domain theory (BDT), estimating the constructs by inference based on generalisa-
tion in the population. The items for each trait were understood to correspond to behaviour,
and their responses did not have to be interrelated [59]. Short personality questionnaires,
which follow the five-factor model, have been shown to have adequate psychometric
criteria and tend to be used for reasons of economy of effort [60]. The Cronbach’s alpha
scores were 0.7 for extraversion and 0.67 for neuroticism (vs. emotional stability). Alpha
scores greater than 0.60 can be considered acceptable [61–63]. The item–total (item–item)
correlation coefficient was r = 0.544 ** for extraversion and r = 0.507 ** for emotional stabil-
ity [64]. Given the variable nature of personality traits during adolescence, the indications
of Wu and Zumbo [65] were followed in this study. Accordingly, the variables of emotional
stability and extraversion were included as mediating variables.

Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy, RESE [8].
This scale examined perceived self-efficacy, geared towards showing or experiencing
positive or negative affect. The scale had 12 items, using a five-point Likert scale ranging

Behav. Sci. 2024, 14, 206

6 of 13

from 1 (incapable) to 5 (completely capable). This scale had two subdimensions: (1) emotional
self-efficacy perceived to express positive affect (POS), with alpha = 0.74; and (2) emotional
self-efficacy perceived to express negative affect. Negative affect had two further subfac-
tors: (1) emotional self-efficacy perceived in handling anger and irritation (ANG), with
alpha = 0.72; and (2) self-efficacy perceived in handling despair and distress (DES), with
alpha = 0.74. An example item was “How well can you: Express joy when good things
happen to you?”

3.3. Procedure

This study was cross-sectional. The sample was selected based on the classification of
secondary schools in the Spanish province of Valencia. The project received permission
from the schools and support from the teaching staff. Group evaluations were carried
out during class time in the adolescents’ classrooms. Two expert evaluators supervised
the entire procedure. For participation, authorisation from the schools, families, and
students themselves was first received. The parents and students completed and signed the
informed consent form. The management team of the schools approved the intervention.
The ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration for this type of research were followed.
Participation was voluntary, anonymous, and confidential. At any moment in the process,
the students could withdraw their participation if they wished. However, no student
decided to withdraw from the evaluation. The evaluations were carried out in sessions of
approximately 45 min. The data were collected between February and May 2019.

3.4. Data Analysis

First, to provide background on the variables, the descriptive statistics and Pearson
correlations were examined for all variables. Second, a predictive structural equation model
was estimated using confirmatory techniques. The dimensions of emotion regulation
(cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) acted as antecedent variables. The
emotional self-efficacy dimensions (POS, ANG, and DES) acted as consequent variables.
The personality variables of emotional stability and extraversion acted as mediator variables.
The statistical analyses were carried out in SPSS 24.0 and Mplus 8 [66].

Table 2 shows the correlations between the variables. The strategies of cognitive
reappraisal were positively correlated with extraversion, emotional stability, self-efficacy for
positive emotions, and self-efficacy for negative emotions (DES and ANG). The correlation
indices with DES (r = 0.408 **, p < 0.01) and with ANG (r = 0.422 **, p < 0.01) were high.

Expressive suppression was negatively correlated with extraversion and positive emotions.
However, the relationships with emotional stability and with self-efficacy for the negative
emotions DES and ANG were positive. The correlation indices were low. Extraversion
and emotional stability were negatively correlated (r = −0.130 **, p < 0.01). In addition,
extraversion was positively correlated with positive emotions and DES. Emotional stability
was positively correlated with DES and ANG. The correlation indices were low, except
between extraversion and positive emotions (r = 0.347 **, p < 0.01) and between emotional
stability and ANG (r = 0.359 **, p < 0.01), whose values were close to the mean.

4.2. Structural Equation Model

A measurement model was tested by analysing full structural equation models using
the full-information maximum-likelihood method. For this method, an estimator was used
for robust quantitative variables (MLR) [67]. The two dimensions of emotion regulation and
the three factors of emotional self-efficacy acted as latent variables. In contrast, emotional
stability and extraversion were the observed variables.

The fit model was evaluated using the chi-square index, comparative fit index (CFI),
Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), and standardised root mean square residual (RMSEA). The fit
was considered satisfactory with values for the CFI and TLI greater than 0.90 and values
for RMSEA and SRMR less than 0.08, depending on the complexity of the model [68]. The
criteria described by Kline and Kenny et al. [69,70] were followed. The model had two
antecedent variables, three consequent variables, and two mediator variables (Figure 1). It
had a satisfactory fit: χ2(232) = 647.282, p < 0.01; CFI = 0.905; TLI = 0.900; RMSEA = 0.050,
90% CI [.046,.055]; SRMR = 0.055. The factor loadings of the latent variables appear in
Figure 2.

The model illustrated a direct, positive, and significant effect of cognitive reappraisal
on the three variables of emotional self-efficacy (POS, DES, and ANG). Expressive suppres-
sion had a negative effect on self-efficacy for positive emotions and a positive effect on
self-efficacy for both negative emotions (DES and ANG).

Emotional stability mediated the relationship between cognitive reappraisal and
self-efficacy for negative emotions (DES and ANG) but not self-efficacy for positive emo-
tions (POS). However, extraversion mediated both positive and negative (DES and ANG)
self-efficacy. The direct relationships of cognitive reappraisal with the three self-efficacy
variables had higher indices than the relationships of mediation.

Expressive suppression had direct, positive relationships with self-efficacy for positive
and negative (DES and ANG) emotions and with emotional stability. However, it had a
negative relationship with extraversion. In this case, the personality trait variables also
mediated the relationship between the antecedent and consequent variables, with slightly
higher beta values. The model predicted 28.9% of the variance of self-efficacy for positive
emotions, 30.1% of the variance for negative emotions of despair and distress (DES), and
40.6% of the variance for negative emotions of anger and irritation (ANG). Associations of
greater than 0.25 between variables indicated medium effects. Associations greater than
0.35 indicated large effects [71].

5. Discussion and Conclusions

This study had a twofold aim: (i) to analyse the relationships among emotion reg-
ulation, the personality traits of extraversion and emotional stability, and the feeling of
efficacy for positive and negative emotions in an adolescent population; and (ii) to verify
the mediating role of the personality traits of extraversion and emotional stability in the
relationship between emotion regulation and self-efficacy for positive and negative emo-
tions. The model, which represents a new line of exploration, is based on an extensive
empirical study. The present study also attempted to overcome the limitations highlighted

by Caprara et al. [8] by including the variables of emotion regulation and personality, as
well as emotional self-efficacy.

The results lead to the following conclusions. The first conclusion is that the analyses
show the positive relationships between cognitive reappraisal and self-efficacy for positive
and negative emotions (Hypothesis 1). They also show that expressive suppression has a
positive relationship with self-efficacy for negative emotions but a negative relationship
with self-efficacy for positive emotions (Hypothesis 2). The analysis thus confirms that
cognitive reappraisal increases the perception of self-efficacy for coping with adolescents’
positive and negative emotions. In other words, in complex situations of everyday life,
adolescents who are able to apply emotion regulation strategies that focus on the antecedent
of the emotional experience can cope more effectively with positive and negative (ANG
and DES) emotions. In contrast, focusing on the emotional response, such as expressive
suppression, negatively affects the self-efficacy for positive emotions and increases feelings
of self-efficacy in the use of negative emotions. Therefore, when faced with an emotional
experience, adolescents who are more capable of focusing on antecedents (such as self-
control or the search for alternatives) will be able to increase their feelings of emotional
self-efficacy and will be more likely to succeed and achieve self-management throughout
their lives [3,27]. Experiencing emotional efficacy increases the belief of efficacy and helps
cope with situations in a potentially successful manner, which will have a multiplying
effect on future situations. Gunzenhauser et al. [10] observed similar findings in a German
population. These findings are also consistent with those of Gross and John [9], confirming
that strategies of expressive suppression are dysfunctional in terms of the regulation
of emotional expression. However, it may initially seem contradictory that expressive
suppression should be positively related to negative emotional self-efficacy (DES and ANG).
Notably, expressive suppression is an emotion regulation strategy, whereas emotional self-
efficacy refers to individuals’ beliefs about their ability to address negative emotions and
cope with these emotions suitably. Hence, although expressive suppression may be a
maladaptive strategy [43], in school contexts, it may be adaptive because it can attenuate
the immediate behavioural response and can help individuals cope with overwhelming
negative emotions [42].

The second conclusion relates to Hypothesis 3, aimed at analysing the effects of emo-
tion regulation on self-efficacy for positive and negative emotions. The results show direct,
positive relationships between cognitive reappraisal and positive and negative (DES and
ANG) emotional self-efficacy. The correlation indices are high for the two dimensions
of self-efficacy for negative emotions (DES and ANG). A similar situation appears with
expressive suppression, which also has direct relationships with self-efficacy for positive
and negative (DES and ANG) emotions. However, in this case, the relationship is weaker.
The relationships are direct and positive in all cases, except between expressive suppres-
sion and self-efficacy for positive emotions, where the relationships are negative. Hence,
emotion regulation strategies that focus on the antecedents of emotional experience enable
the management of positive and negative emotions by regulating behaviour to achieve
more efficient emotional coping [46]. Expressive suppression reduces self-efficacy for
positive emotions [38,48]. In sum, the results support the idea that cognitive reappraisal
reduces the intensity of negative emotions and strengthens positive emotions. This situa-
tion may also lead to positive emotional feelings [37] and an improvement in interpersonal
relationships [7,25,36]. In addition, expressive suppression negatively affects the establish-
ment of smooth, efficient social relations [38,39] and is associated with greater negative
affect [38,47].

The third conclusion is that extraversion and emotional stability act as mediating vari-
ables [21,54] (Hypothesis 3). Extraversion mediates the relationships between the two types
of emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and positive and
negative (DES and ANG) emotions. Emotional stability mediates the relationships between
the two types of emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression)
and self-efficacy for negative emotions (DES and ANG). However, it does not mediate

self-efficacy for positive emotions (Hypothesis 4). People who use antecedent-focused
emotion regulation strategies and who are emotionally stable will tend to feel more self-
efficient in coping with the negative emotions of despair and anger. In summary, emotional
stability provides resources to cope with negative emotions more suitably [19]. Even so, it
does not seem to have an effect on positive emotions. Positive emotions seem to be more
strongly linked to antecedent-focused strategies in emotional experience. One possible
explanation is that people with high emotional stability feel that negative emotional coping
is an achievement and pay less attention to positive emotional coping [45,46]. The results
partially confirm Hypothesis 4 and are consistent with earlier research, although some
studies have considered neuroticism instead of emotional stability (given that they are op-
posites) [45]. In an adult population, scholars have also observed links between neuroticism
and negative emotions but not between self-efficacy and positive emotions [45].

Regarding extraversion, the findings corroborate its relationship with positive and
negative emotional self-efficacy, as well as confirming its mediating role in the relationships
between emotion regulation and positive and negative (DES and ANG) emotional coping.
People with a tendency towards extraversion tend to perceive themselves as more effective
in coping with positive and negative emotions [52]. This perception may be partly because
extroverts easily establish social relationships. Therefore, they have more opportunities to
cope with their emotional state and thus manage it efficiently. They also tend to exhibit more
positive emotional states and to have experiences involving positive affect [53]. Moreover,
extraversion is positively associated with negative emotional self-efficacy (DES), which
refers to handling emotions of despair and distress. Faced with highly emotionally charged
situations, extroverts are more capable of tackling negative emotional states that cause
despair and distress. For instance, a recent study [22] showed links between extraversion
and lower levels of physical symptoms associated with negative emotions.

In sum, adolescents with greater extraversion and emotional stability are more likely to
cope with highly emotionally charged situations more effectively, particularly those with a
negative emotional charge that leads to both externalising and internalising problems such
as aggression, anger, distress, or despair. Likewise, the use of antecedent-focused emotion
regulation strategies, coupled with emotional stability, can act as a strength that helps
adolescents deal with negative emotional burdens. Therefore, they will avoid externalising
problems such as aggression or anger, as well as internalising problems such as distress
or despair.

6. Limitations and Future Research

This study is not free from limitations. First, the results should be taken with some
caution, given that this study was cross-sectional. Data gathering was carried out in a
single evaluation, which may have been influenced by respondents’ degree of willingness to
participate. This study shows the existence of direct relationships, but causal relationships
cannot be established. A longitudinal study would strengthen the results. Second, the
variables included in this study were part of a more extensive study. Therefore, bias
may appear because of participants’ tiredness. Even so, possible tiredness was taken into
account, and the sessions were kept short. Third, this study focused on a general Spanish
adolescent population (15 to 18 years of age). It would be of interest for future studies
to include younger adolescents and, if possible, adolescents from different sociocultural
backgrounds. As noted by Kim et al. [24], extraversion and emotional stability may be
moderated by culture. Finally, some authors have expressed doubts about the use of short
personality questionnaires [72]. However, the TIPI is widely accepted by the research
community [57–60,62].
