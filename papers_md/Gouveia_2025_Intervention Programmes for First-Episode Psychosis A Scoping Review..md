Abstract: The aim of this scoping review was to map intervention programmes for first-
episode psychosis by identifying their characteristics, participants, and specific contexts of
implementation. It seems reasonable to suggest that early intervention may be beneficial in
improving recovery outcomes and reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP).
Despite the expansion of these programmes, there are still some significant variations and
barriers to access that need to be addressed. In line with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)
methodology and the Participants, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework, this review
encompasses studies focusing on individuals grappling with early-stage psychosis and
their caregivers across a range of settings, including hospital and community environ-
ments. The review identified 47 studies from 2002 to 2023, which revealed a great deal
of diversity in programme characteristics and implementation contexts. This reflects a
global perspective. The results showed that there is a great deal of variety in the charac-
teristics of the programmes, with interventions ranging from single-component strategies,
such as cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and cognitive remediation therapy (CRT), to
multicomponent programmes that integrate a number of different approaches, including
psychosocial, pharmacological, and family-focused strategies. The objectives included
attempts to improve cognitive functioning; enhance coping skills; reduce caregiver burden;
and address symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and hallucinations. It is notable that
there was considerable variation in the frequency, duration, and follow-up periods of the
interventions, with some lasting just three sessions over one month and others spanning
five years and 48 sessions. The majority of the programmes were delivered in community
or outpatient settings, although there were also examples of hospital- and home-based
interventions. These findings highlight the value of early interventions and provide a
useful resource for adapting programmes to different social and cultural contexts. It would
be beneficial for future research to explore how these interventions can be tailored to
diverse settings.

1. Introduction

Psychosis is characterized by various signs and symptoms, including changes in
thinking and perception [1]. Common features include delusions, hallucinations, mood
disturbances, cognitive impairments, and behavioural changes [2–4]. The first psychotic
episode generally occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood and is defined as the initial
experience of such symptoms, lasting for at least one week and significantly impacting the
individual’s functioning [3,4].

Early intervention in psychosis is widely recognised as essential for a favourable
prognosis [5–7]. In recent decades, research in the field of early psychosis intervention and
related therapeutic strategies has expanded [8,9], challenging the traditionally negative
outlook associated with psychosis [10].

Three key contributions to the field are particularly significant. Firstly, Birch-
wood’s [11] studies highlight the critical intervention period, identified as occurring within
two to five years after symptom onset, during which intervention is most effective and after
which the effectiveness of intervention diminishes [1,2,11,12]. Secondly, McGorry’s [13]
research on the staging of psychotic illness suggests that appropriate interventions can
delay or even prevent progression to more advanced stages [9,13–15]. Lastly, the duration
of untreated psychosis (DUP) has been recognised as a crucial factor influencing the course
of the illness, with shorter DUPs linked to more positive outcomes [16]. This understanding
has led to the identification of distinct stages within the disorder, facilitating the develop-
ment of targeted interventions and a preventive approach [2,12–14] to halt progression to
more advanced stages [17].

Given the nature of psychosis and developments in the field, early intervention
is considered fundamental [14] and more effective than general care [1,5,18,19]. Early
intervention requires intervention that is appropriate to the stage of the disease, promotes
It aims to achieve
recovery, and delays or prevents deterioration of the person [20].
outcomes not only at the clinical level (such as symptom reduction), but also at the personal
level in terms of developing a productive and meaningful life [19,21,22]. In this context, the
family will play an important role, not only because of the impact that a psychotic break can
have on their dynamics [23], but also by actively supporting the individual in the recovery
process [24,25] and helping to prevent relapse and social isolation. Their involvement is
crucial in addressing the challenges posed by the illness [25].

Since its inception in 1992 in Melbourne, Australia [26], early intervention services
have expanded significantly worldwide [1,8,27]. In 2005, the World Health Organization
and the International Early Psychosis Association came together in the “Early Psychosis
Declaration” to identify the essential components of early intervention services for psy-
chosis, emphasising the need for a broad and eclectic approach [28] to promote recovery
(symptomatic and functional) and empower the individual experiencing their first psy-
chotic episode [9,28]. Early intervention must be accessible and comprehensive, involving
caregivers. This requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates pharmacological
and psychosocial interventions to reduce the severity and impact of the disease [1–3,22,23].
By implementing appropriate interventions, the aim is to minimise the risk of relapse, en-
hance the individual’s functioning, and promote recovery as swiftly as possible [12,29,30].
The number of programmes is growing worldwide [21], and the results are encour-
aging in terms of symptom reduction, overall functioning, quality of life, and relapse
reduction [4,31] by reducing DUP, optimizing treatment response, reducing family burden,

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

treating comorbidities such as substance abuse, and preventing disease progression [32].
Currently, there are guidelines with recommendations for the development of these pro-
grammes like Orygen [2], Health Service Executive (HSE) [4], and the National Association
of State Mental Health Programme Directors (NASMHPD) [33]. Early intervention teams
share common goals, including minimising the DUP, developing integrated treatments,
and involving families [2–4,29,33,34]. However, there is significant variability in how these
programmes are implemented [31]. Despite scientific evidence showing that early inter-
vention is more effective than general care [1,18], its dissemination is limited, particularly
in low- and middle-income countries [35,36]. In these regions, the development of early
intervention programmes is often much slower [33,37] compared to high-income countries,
where such programmes are widely established [38].

In this sense, the unequal development of mental health services gives rise to in-
equalities in access to care, with services often being geographically dispersed [35,36].
Additionally, barriers stemming from health systems or the services themselves reflect in-
consistencies in their implementation [39]. This issue is particularly evident in low-income
countries, where mental health services are frequently underfunded, and the DUP is often
longer, leading to poorer recovery outcomes.

To address these issues, it is essential to create conditions that facilitate the devel-
opment of services [35–37,40]. Improvements in accessibility, equity, and treatment out-
comes can only be achieved through systematic implementation within national health
systems [32]. Furthermore, ethical considerations must be integrated into the development
of care pathways for psychosis, given that access is contingent upon socio-cultural contexts
and the structure of health services [41].

Nevertheless, existing early intervention services show significant variation in their
delivery models [31], leading to uncertainty about how best to adapt and implement them
across different contexts. This variability underscores the need for comprehensive mapping
to ensure that services are effectively tailored to the unique demands of diverse healthcare
settings, calling for context-specific approaches [42]. The heterogeneity of these services,
combined with the complexity of care pathways for first-episode psychosis, often results in a
lack of standardised psychometric data, reflecting the diversity of intervention programmes
and recovery trajectories [43]. To address these challenges and enhance care models, it is
essential to develop fidelity scales that standardise implementation while incorporating
quality indicators into their dissemination. This approach will ensure consistent application
and maintain the effectiveness of these models across diverse settings [42].

A scoping review of early intervention programmes for psychosis is essential given
the considerable variation and lack of standardisation in the way these programmes are
described and structured. Although many interventions are documented, information is
scattered across different sources, making a comprehensive and coherent understanding of
current approaches difficult. This fragmentation hinders a full overview of key programme
characteristics, including the type of intervention, facilitators, objectives, frequency of use,
context of implementation, and evaluation methods. A scoping review will systematically
map the range of existing programmes and provide a broad overview of their structure
and implementation in different contexts. Consolidating this information into a single
document will facilitate a clearer understanding of the diversity of approaches, enabling
future discussion and further research into their adaptability and potential impact in
different settings.

A preliminary search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO,
MEDLINE, and JBI Evidence Synthesis revealed that, although studies on this topic ex-
ist, no systematic review has addressed the specificities and scope of early intervention
programmes for psychosis. It is therefore crucial to map the characteristics of these pro-

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

grammes to support their development and dissemination. In this context, mental health
nurses, with their strong background in evidence-based interventions, play a key role
within multidisciplinary teams, applying a holistic approach that takes into account the
patient’s social and family context. By increasing their involvement, a more collaborative
environment can be fostered, enhancing both the accessibility and comprehensiveness of
mental health care. The objective of this scoping review is to map the features of interven-
tion programmes for first-episode psychosis, including their characteristics, participants,
and implementation contexts, whether in hospital or community settings.

2. Materials and Methods

This review was conducted according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology
for scoping reviews [44]. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was used as a structuring
matrix [45]. The review protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework on 26
February 2022 [46] and was conducted according to an a priori protocol published in
2023 [47]. OSF Registration Doi: 10.17605/OSF.IO/ZY9QM.

2.1. Review Questions

The objective of this study was to map the landscape of early intervention programmes
for individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis. The central review question was:
What early intervention programmes are implemented for service users and their

families experiencing first-episode psychosis?

To address this, the following sub-questions were explored:

i.

ii.
iii.

What are the characteristics of these intervention programmes? (e.g., programme
name, objectives, frequency, type of intervention, facilitators, evaluation methods,
and implementation context)
In what contexts are these programmes implemented?
Who is the target audience for the intervention programmes (patients and/or family
members)?

2.2. Inclusion Criteria

This review follows the methodology proposed by the JBI for scoping reviews, utilising
the Participants, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework to ensure a comprehensive and
structured approach to the collection and analysis of evidence. The key elements of the
PCC relevant to this review are outlined below [44,45].

2.2.1. Participants

This review included studies that included people with symptoms associated with the
early stages of psychosis. Terms such as “first episode psychosis”, “recent onset psychosis”,
“early onset psychosis”, and “early psychosis” may be used to describe participants. The
study will not include individuals diagnosed with organic psychosis.

There are no restrictions on the age or gender of participants, with the only inclusion
criterion being diagnosis. The study will also include caregivers, defined as first- or second-
degree relatives who provide care and support to or live with people with first-episode
psychosis. Participants may be either carers, people with first-episode psychosis, or both.

2.2.2. Concept

This review considered studies that explored intervention programmes specifically de-
signed to address first-episode psychosis and early-onset psychosis. These programmes pro-
vide a variety of interventions, including psychotherapeutic (e.g., cognitive–behavioural),

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

5 of 79

psychosocial, vocational, and psychoeducational approaches, aimed at assisting both indi-
viduals experiencing their first episode of psychosis and their family caregivers.

It is important to note that interventions delivered in a general manner (e.g., “treatment
as usual”) during consultations not specifically designated for first-episode psychosis in
the early phase are excluded from this review.

2.2.3. Context

This scoping review will consider studies from all countries and settings. This includes
both hospital and community environments. There will be no exclusion criteria. We will
include studies conducted in both inpatient and outpatient settings, whether psychiatric
or non-psychiatric. Interventions delivered by trained healthcare professionals within a
clinical intervention context, whether face-to-face, telephone-based, online, or home-based,
will be considered.

2.2.4. Types of Sources

Quantitative, qualitative, and multi-method/mixed-method studies were included in
the scoping review. Quantitative studies comprise observational research with descriptive,
exploratory, and analytical designs. All systematic reviews were included, independently of
the types of methods of search used, as well as experimental designs like quasi-experimental
studies, randomized controlled trials, and non-randomized controlled trials. Grey or
unpublished literature, such as theses, dissertations, reports, government publications,
organizational papers, and guidelines, was included. Sources of information had no
geographical or cultural limitations and were consistent with the author’s proficiency in
English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French.

2.3. Search Strategy

The search strategy was designed to identify relevant studies and reviews, both
published and unpublished. We began with an initial search of MEDLINE (PubMed) and
CINAHL (EBSCO) to identify terms related to the topic. To develop a comprehensive
search strategy for MEDLINE with full-text access via PubMed, we included text words
from the titles and abstracts and their index terms (see Appendix A). This search strategy
was adapted for each information source to include all identified keywords and index
terms according to the inclusion criteria. In addition, we examined the reference lists of the
articles included in the review to identify additional relevant articles.

2.4. Source of Evidence Selection

The search encompassed a variety of databases, including the Web of Science Core Col-
lection (ISI Web of Knowledge), MEDLINE with Full Text, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO
(accessible through EBSCOhost), Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and JBI Evidence Synthe-
sis. Additionally, efforts to identify unpublished studies involved searching OpenGrey, a
European repository, as well as MedNar.

2.5. Study Selection

The search results were imported into EndNote vX9 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadel-
phia, PA, USA), where duplicates were removed. Two independent reviewers assessed
the titles and abstracts to ensure they aligned with the inclusion criteria. Articles were
selected based on the relevance of their titles and abstracts, including those that lacked an
abstract. The reviewers thoroughly analysed any articles that met the inclusion criteria or
raised uncertainties.

After this initial assessment, the full texts of the selected citations that complied with
the inclusion criteria were reviewed by the two independent reviewers. Any disagreements

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

6 of 79

were resolved through discussion, or, if necessary, a third reviewer was consulted. Full-text
citations of eligible studies were uploaded into the JBI System for the Unified Management,
Assessment, and Review of Information (JBI SUMARI), developed by the Joanna Briggs
Institute in Adelaide, Australia.

Full-text articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were documented and pre-
sented in a PRISMA-ScR flowchart diagram [45]. Authors of articles without access were
contacted, and those articles were excluded if access could not be obtained. Due to the
volume of articles, those without detailed information on programme characterisation,
particularly frequency, were excluded. Articles were retained if they provided, at minimum,
general information on the characterisation of the participants (including programme name,
intervention objective, frequency (at least two out of four), type of intervention and evalu-
ation). Although some articles did not always provide clear information on intervention
facilitators or implementation context, they were still included, even if the information
was incomplete.

2.6. Data Extraction

The data from the articles selected for the scoping review were extracted by two inde-
pendent reviewers using a data extraction tool as outlined in the review protocol [47]. The
extracted information included comprehensive specifications regarding the intervention
programmes examined. In the event of any discrepancies between the reviewers, these were
resolved through discussion, and if necessary, a third reviewer was consulted. Furthermore,
the authors of the articles were contacted to obtain any missing information, ensuring that
additional data were acquired as required.

2.7. Data Analysis and Presentation

The text presents the data through visuals, narrative, and tables. It outlines gen-
eral study information, participant characterisation, programme characterisation, and the
implementation context.

General study information includes the author, year of publication, country of origin,
type of study, and study objectives. Participant characterisation covers the diagnosis, age of
participants, and target group. Programme characterisation encompasses the programme
name, intervention objectives, frequency (including the number, duration, and periodicity
of sessions, as well as the follow-up period), intervention type (strategy and content),
facilitators, and evaluation methods.

The data also address the implementation context, specifying the geographical area,
if mentioned, and describing the setting—whether residential, community-based, or out-
patient. Where possible, this section also includes the number of participants, indicating
whether the intervention was delivered in a group or individual setting.

2.8. Study Inclusion

The process of searching and selecting evidence was followed as planned, and the
results were synthesized into a PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) flow chart, which can be
viewed in Figure 1 [48].

3. Results Characteristics of Included Studies
3.1. General Study Information

[49–55], Canada (10.64%)

This section summarises the general characteristics of the reviewed studies, includ-
ing the author, publication year, origin, study type, and objectives (see Appendix B).
The inclusion of 47 studies reflected a global perspective on early psychosis interven-
tions. Publications spanned from 2002 to 2023. Contributions came from Australia
(14.89%)
[56–60], and several other countries: China
(4.25%) [61,62], Croatia (2.13%) [63], Denmark (4.25%) [64,65], France (2.13%) [66], Ger-
many (2.13%) [67], Iceland (2.13%) [68], India (2.13%) [69], Ireland (6.38%) [70–72], Italy
(6.38%) [73–75], the Netherlands and Belgium (2.13%) [76], Norway (2.13%) [77], Sin-
gapore (2.13%) [78], Spain (10.64%) [19,79–82], Switzerland (2.13%) [83], United King-
dom (17.02%) [84–91], and the United States (6.38%) [31,92,93]. Studies originated
from North America (n = 8), Europe (n = 27), Asia (n = 5), and Oceania (n = 7),
with no representation from Africa or South America. Various research designs were
used. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were predominant, including thirty-two stud-
ies [49–51,53–58,61,64,65,68,77,79–81,84,85,87,88,93]. Variations included Pragmatic Cluster
RCT [73], Multicentre RCT [19], and Pilot RCTs [60,67,70]. Other designs were descriptive
studies [52,59,63,66,74,75,78,82,83,92], cross-sectional studies [90], literature reviews [31],
prospective controlled trials [76,86], and comparative studies [71]. Experimental designs
featured quasi-experimental [69] and waiting list-controlled studies [62]. The objectives
varied widely. Some studies explored cognitive interventions, compared therapeutic condi-
tions (e.g., cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) combined with treatment as usual (TAU)
vs. TAU alone), and evaluated multi-component psychosocial interventions by identifying
barriers to feasibility and predictors of treatment effectiveness in first-episode psychosis
(FEP) [19,73]. Others piloted programmes like group-based Integrated Cognitive Remedia-
tion (ICR) [68] or assessed novel interventions such as the Actissist mobile app [84]. The
efficacy of peer-led family support versus traditional family psychoeducation and TAU

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

was also examined [61]. The impact on cognitive functioning, social recovery, depressive
symptoms, self-esteem, and quality of life was assessed [77,87,88]. Studies also investigated
combining pharmacological and psychological interventions [85,86] and explored cost-
effectiveness and satisfaction [50,67]. Additional research evaluated novel psychosocial
interventions combining cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) and CBT [70], and RCTs
assessed CBT for cannabis cessation [79] and cognitive therapy for suicidal patients [54],
while the benefits of cognitive remediation on secondary negative symptoms and social
functioning were also explored [93].

3.2. Participant Characterisation

The diagnoses considered included FEP (equivalent to recent-onset psychosis, early
psychosis, early-onset psychosis, and first episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorder),
which corresponded to studies that primarily focused on FEP patients (87.50% of the arti-
cles). The remaining 12.50% also referred to FEP patients, but the target group exclusively
comprised the caregivers [50,52,55,62,69,90].

The age of the patients ranged from 12 [74] to 65 years [76,77,89], with different
intervals depending on the article. The most common age range was 18–35 years, with
10.42% of articles, followed by 18–45 years, with 8.33%. Twenty-four articles dealt with
the age group below 18 years [31,49,51,53,54,56,59,62,66,67,70,74–76,78,79,81,84–88]. Some
articles did not specify the age (e.g., [63,64,71]), and three articles included the age group
of over 65 years [76,77,89].

Of the selected articles, twenty-three included interventions only for patients, eighteen
included interventions for both carers and patients, and six included interventions only for
carers [50,52,55,62,69,90] (see Appendix C).

3.3. Programme Characterization

The included studies presented different interventions in terms of their objectives,
frequency, intervention types (strategies and content), facilitators, and evaluations (see
Appendix D).

3.3.1. Programme Name/Intervention Objective

Given the high number of articles, an effort was made to group them into single-
component interventions (e.g., CBT, computerised interventions, cognitive remediation,
psychoeducation) or those that integrated multiple components (e.g., CBT + CM + psy-
choeducation). This categorisation was adopted for two primary reasons: to facilitate the
organisation and analysis of the articles and to highlight the programmes’ characteristics.
The classification provides a clear framework for presenting programmes with varying
levels of complexity, which allows us to underscore the depth of focused interventions and
the breadth of integrated programmes without overwhelming the reader with unstructured
details. The included studies encompassed different psychosocial interventions, reflecting
a wide array of cognitive, behavioural, and social approaches tailored to varying objectives
and characteristics. It is acknowledged that some single-component interventions may
have been part of broader programmes; however, they were analysed independently when
the study’s primary focus was on a single component, as specified in the original articles.
Objectives: The core aim of each programme is to address a specific aspect of psychosis,
such as improving cognitive function; enhancing coping skills; alleviating caregiver burden;
or reducing symptoms like anxiety, depression, or hallucinations. These objectives are the
intended outcomes of the intervention, guiding its design and scope.

Appendix E provides a brief overview of the different programmes, including their
names (if assigned), intervention objectives, and whether they are single- or multi-

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

9 of 79

component. Note that there may be selected articles in which only a single isolated
intervention is analysed, which might be part of a broader programme (e.g., [54]).

Single-Component

Single-component interventions primarily focus on cognitive and cognitive–behavioural
therapies. CBT is a prominent feature of numerous studies [51,57,67,71,76,77,79], addressing
a range of objectives, including the reduction in both positive and negative symptoms,
enhancement of overall functioning, support for cannabis cessation [79], and management
of social anxiety [57].

In the realm of cognitive interventions, CRT is a central focus, with several studies
indicating its efficacy in improving cognitive function and supporting functional recov-
ery [78,86,87,93]. The objective of CRT is to enhance cognitive abilities and provide strate-
gies to manage cognitive deficits. In addition to CRT, compensatory cognitive training
(CCT) is a key element of this approach, intending to develop new cognitive habits to adapt
to impairments [60].

Several studies have explored the potential of recovery-focused interventions, includ-
ing bibliotherapy and problem-solving techniques. The use of bibliotherapy has been
demonstrated to provide support to caregivers and alleviate psychological distress [50,55],
and psychoeducation has been shown to assist patients and families in the management
of early-onset psychosis [81]. Furthermore, the Method of Levels therapy [89] seeks to
resolve goal conflicts and enhance self-management, while the Cognitive Recovery Inter-
vention [88] is designed to reduce trauma symptoms and boost self-esteem or detect and
monitor suicide-risk patients [54].

Other interventions include mindfulness-based social cognition training [80], which
promotes a non-judgemental approach to interpersonal relationships, and psychoeduca-
tion [52,62,90], which enhances carers’ understanding of psychosis. A noteworthy innova-
tion is a computerised approach to managing psychosis in real time [84].

Multicomponent

Multicomponent interventions integrate multiple therapeutic strategies to offer a
comprehensive approach to early psychosis management. Programmes such as Cognitive
Adaptation Training (CAT) and Action-Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR) combine
home-based supports with computerised cognitive exercises to address cognitive and
motivational issues [56]. The Cognitive Remediation and Social Recovery in Early Psychosis
(CReSt-R) programme merges CRT with social recovery therapy to improve both cognitive
and social functioning [70].

Integrated approaches are significant in early psychosis management. The NEURO-
COM programme combines cognitive remediation with OPUS treatment, which includes
social skills training, patient psychoeducation, and family interventions [64]. Similarly, the
cognitively oriented psychotherapy for early psychosis—COPE—programme integrates
cognitive/behavioural therapy with psychoeducation and case management to facilitate
patient adjustment and prevent secondary morbidity [49]. The NAVIGATE programme
offers a comprehensive package including family education, individual resiliency train-
ing, and supported employment and education [92]. The Parma-Early Psychosis (Pr-EP)
programme also includes a multi-component psychosocial intervention [74].

Family-focused interventions are crucial, with programmes like the Family-Led Mu-
tual Support Group (FMSG) combining family psychoeducation with support groups to
enhance family functioning and reduce rehospitalisation rates [61]. The Integrated Treat-
ment Programme includes assertive community treatment (ACT), social skills training, and
multifamily groups to address psychotic and disorganised symptoms [65]. The comprehen-

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

10 of 79

sive therapeutic programme (CTP) utilises a range of therapies, including psychodynamic
group psychotherapy, cognitive–behavioural workshops, and occupational therapy, to
achieve remission and recovery [63].

Extensive programmes also play a vital role. The DETECT initiative combines CBT
with occupational therapy and a Carer Education Programme to address early-phase psy-
chosis and improve care [72]. The PEPP programme integrates cognitive skills training,
family support, and individual therapeutic interventions to prevent relapse and support re-
covery [59]. The POTENTIAL programme employs a multidisciplinary approach, including
individual and group therapies, to prevent chronic mental illness [31].

The combination of CBT and psychoeducation targets clinical improvement through
normalising information, problem-solving, and relapse prevention [85] or enhancing func-
tioning, treatment adherence, and illness awareness [19]. The Integrated Need-Adapted
Treatment programme focuses on individual psychotherapy, group therapy, and improv-
ing treatment adherence [82]. Combining CR with CBT aims to enhance cognitive skills
and facilitate effective symptom management [91]. The psychoeducational/psychosocial
management approach targets social support and reduces family burden [69].

The EPPIC programme employs a multi-modal therapeutic approach, including re-
lapse prevention and family-based CBT to prevent relapse after a first episode of psy-
chosis [53]. The NEAR programme (Neurocognitive Educational Approach to Remedia-
tion) incorporates cognitive remediation, CCT, and social cognition and interaction training
(SCIT) [68]. The Re-Arms programme combines CBT, case management (CM), and psy-
choeducation to improve overall treatment outcomes [75]. Additionally, the CBT plus
psychoeducation approach [66] targets a reduction in psychotic symptoms and aims for
a greater improvement in overall functioning, while ACT combined with case manage-
ment [83] enhances continuity of care and reduces inpatient admissions.

Moreover, group treatments such as CBT for psychosis (CBTp) and symptom man-
agement (SM) programmes aim to enhance multiple protective factors, including skills,
social competencies, family and social support, adaptive strategies, self-esteem, stress man-
agement, and medication compliance [58]. The AVEC component empowers families to
support each other and provides information on various aspects of psychosis, contributing
to the holistic approach to treatment and support.

The combination of CBT, case management, and family intervention for psychosis
(FIP) enhances functioning, treatment adherence, and understanding of the condition, with
a more substantial reduction in depressive, negative, and general psychotic symptoms
following treatment [73].

3.3.2. Frequency

The reviewed articles present a wide range of intervention programmes for psychosis,
with considerable variation in the number of sessions (NS), treatment duration (TD), session
frequency (FS), and follow-up (FU). The number of sessions varies significantly, with some
programmes offering as few as 3 sessions [90], while others have up to 48 sessions [93].
Treatment durations also vary greatly, ranging from one month [52] to five years [82]. The
frequency of sessions is similarly varied, ranging from daily [84] to fortnightly [19] or
even monthly [80]. Follow-up periods are also inconsistent, with some studies having
no follow-up (e.g., [52,68,78]), while others extend for up to 24 months or more after
treatment [67].

Due to the wide heterogeneity of values for NS, TD, FS, and FU, the characteristics
were described with a presentation of their amplitudes (minimum and maximum values) to
illustrate the variation in the data, when possible. It is important to note that several articles
did not report all relevant details, such as the duration of the sessions (e.g., [53,76]) or the

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

11 of 79

exact follow-up periods (e.g., [66]), highlighting the need for more consistent reporting in
the literature. In addition, a subset of articles (e.g., [63,89,92]) describes comprehensive
interventions that are highly adaptable, with the number and frequency of sessions tailored
to individual needs. These flexible programmes are common in cognitive–behavioural
(CBT) and metacognitive training settings, emphasising personalised care to address both
clinical and psychosocial concerns.

Given the large number of articles and the variation in the reported data, this sum-
mary provides an overview at a global level. More detailed information can be found in
Appendix D.

3.3.3. Intervention Type—Strategy/Content

Intervention programmes for psychosis include a wide range of strategies to support

people at different stages of their illness.

Strategies and Contents: These refer to the specific therapeutic approaches and tools
used to achieve the intervention’s objectives. For instance, CBTp focuses on the manage-
ment of psychotic symptoms through structured phases, including goal setting and relapse
prevention (e.g., [67]). Alongside CBTp, family interventions provide psychoeducation and
support to families, aiming to enhance their ability to effectively manage psychosis-related
challenges and foster resilience in the home environment (e.g., [61,69,92]). Comprehensive
models, such as the NAVIGATE programme, combine various elements, including family
education programmes (FEP), individual resilience training (IRT), supported employment
and education (SEE), and individual medication management, to create tailored treatment
plans [92]. These strategies promote recovery by integrating personal, social, and vocational
support to address the multifaceted needs of patients. Cognitive remediation approaches
like SCIT and CCT are aimed at improving cognitive functioning and social skills, directly
addressing the cognitive deficits often associated with psychosis and complementing other
therapeutic strategies such as CBTp or family support interventions [68].

The combination of psychoeducation and caregiver support programmes provides
essential information and practical strategies to caregivers, which are critical for managing
the long-term effects of psychosis on both the individual and their loved ones [69,72]. These
strategies aim to reduce caregiver burden and improve overall care. Given the number of
articles, this summary provides a general overview of strategies. More detailed information
can be found in Appendix D.

3.3.4. Intervention Facilitators

Interventions for psychosis involve a wide range of professionals, each with specific
roles and different qualifications. Clinical psychologists are often associated with CBT and
receive regular supervision to ensure the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., [63,67,77]).
Psychiatrists play a crucial role in medication management and therapeutic support, collab-
orating with the team (e.g., [66,72,74]). Mental health nurses are particularly prominent in
community and family therapy interventions. They provide psychoeducation, facilitate
support groups, and manage cases, although they usually do not deliver CBT directly
(e.g., [52,69,75,89]). Occupational therapists and social workers also play an important role
in cognitive rehabilitation and psychosocial support (e.g., [61,64,80]).

Articles focusing on single-component interventions focus on specific techniques
requiring specific training for each approach. In contrast, multi-component interventions
are a combination of different methods and reflect a broader integration of professionals.
Many articles do not fully describe the training or role of facilitators, but when they are
mentioned, they are health professionals, often with specific experiences of psychosis.
Appendix D provides more information about these practices and facilitator training.

3.3.5. Evaluation

The selected articles yielded a considerable number of scales for the assessment of
variables about mental health. Given the considerable diversity and quantity of instruments
encountered, grouping these scales into categories was deemed appropriate, thus facilitat-
ing data analysis and interpretation. The categories were formed based on the key areas
of assessment, which included: psychiatric symptom evaluation, functional assessment,
cognitive assessment, well-being and quality of life assessment, and family and social
support assessment (see Appendix F).

The category most frequently utilised was that of psychiatric symptom evaluation.
The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
(BPRS) were identified as the most recurrent scales within this category. These instruments
were used extensively for the assessment of symptom presence and severity. In the category
of functional evaluation, instruments such as the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)
and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) were employed
with considerable frequency. These tools assess the impact of mental disorders on people’s
daily lives, providing an integrated view of social and occupational functioning.

In the context of cognitive assessment, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were fre-
quently referenced. These scales are used to assess patients’ cognitive abilities. This is an
area of growing interest in psychiatry. Moreover, the domain of well-being and quality
of life was a significant area of emphasis, with the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels (EQ-
5D-5L) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref) being the
most frequently referenced instruments. These instruments are employed to ascertain the
patients’ perceptions of their quality of life. In several articles, the use of any scales was
not specified. Moreover, several studies opted to employ a combination of scales to gain a
more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter, thereby highlighting the intricate
nature of the topic under investigation (See Appendix D).

3.4. Implementation Context

In examining the implementation contexts of various interventions, many studies were
conducted in urban settings [50,51,61,68,71,72,76,85,88,93]. Research in semi-rural and rural
areas comprised five studies [54,57,73,74,84]. Additionally, a substantial number of studies
did not specify their implementation contexts [19,31,49,52,53,55,56,58–60,62–66,69,70,75,77–
83,85–87,89–92].

3.4.1. Setting

The analysis identified three primary settings for interventions. Inpatient settings
involve interventions conducted within hospitals or residential facilities [59,69,83,87].
Home-based settings deliver interventions within patients’ homes [49–51,56,76,84,91].
Community-based and outpatient settings utilise local resources and encompass in-
terventions conducted in clinics, community centres, or other non-residential environ-
ments [19,31,52–55,57–68,71,72,74,75,77–83,85–90,92,93]. Notably, only one review ad-
dressed interventions in both inpatient and outpatient settings [83].

3.4.2. Individual/Group Intervention

Additionally, interventions varied in their session formats. Some were exclusively indi-
vidual [86,89], while others included both individual and group sessions [50,59,81]. Group
sizes ranged from small (4 participants) to larger groups (up to 15 participants) [78,80,86].
Community-based and outpatient interventions often featured group formats but did not
always specify the number of participants [52,90]. Overall, while individual interven-

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

13 of 79

tions were predominant, several studies incorporated both individual and group sessions,
tailored to the needs of participants and the specific setting.

Individual interventions involve therapeutic approaches delivered on a one-on-one basis
between the therapist and the patient [19,49,51,53–56,58,59,62,63,66,67,70,75–81,83–89,93].
Group interventions describe therapeutic approaches delivered to multiple participants
simultaneously in a group setting [52,58,60–63,65,69,71,72,80,86,87,90]. Mixed individual
and group interventions combine elements of both individual and group therapy [31,50,51,
53,58,59,61–65,68,73,74,81,83,88]. Several articles do not specify whether the intervention
is individual or group-based [19,31,52–57,59,63,64,66,67,74,75,77–83,88–92]. For detailed
information, see Appendix D).

4. Discussion

The scoping review provides a detailed overview of early intervention programmes
for first-episode psychosis, revealing considerable diversity in their characteristics, par-
ticipants, and delivery contexts. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review to
map programmes along these lines. Of the 47 articles included, there was variation in
terms of the structure and type of study. On the other hand, their focus—intervention
programmes—also varied in terms of objectives, types of intervention, and implementation
strategies. They therefore reflect the inherent complexity of psychosis [94] and the diverse
needs of individuals and their families, as highlighted in studies on the staging models of
psychosis [13] and on the needs of patients and their families [32].

The findings confirm the importance of a comprehensive and tailored approach to
psychosis treatment, aligning with previous research advocating for interventions designed
to meet specific manifestations of the illness [13,95]. There is widespread agreement in the
literature on the superiority of intensive, team-based interventions for FEP compared to
TAU [18,94]. Throughout our review, we can see that, of the 23 articles identified as single-
component, 16 are integrated into broader therapeutic programmes where, in addition to
the intervention under study, other specific psychotherapeutic or psychosocial interventions
for FEP may already be available [50,51,54,55,57,60,62,78,80,86,88–90,93]. This finding
is supported by recent research highlighting the effectiveness of integrated approaches
in treating complex psychopathology. The analysis by Williams et al. reinforces the
effectiveness of integrated techniques, showing that models that combine a comprehensive
package of treatments are more effective in optimising outcomes and meeting the specific
needs of patients in the long term, suggesting that, although some interventions may appear
isolated, they are often part of more complex and multifaceted therapeutic contexts [94].
Examples include PSBI (problem-solving therapy) [50,55], which is part of the specialist
FEP centres Orygen Youth Health (OYH) and the Recovery and Prevention of Psychosis
Service (RAPPS), or even CRT for psychosis, which is part of the NHS early intervention
services in the UK [86]; CRT is part of the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP)
in Singapore [78].

Among the selected articles, many included interventions aimed at carers. These
family interventions were frequently associated with reported benefits, such as a reduction
in caregiver burden and positive effects over time [96]. Additionally, the studies indicate
that these interventions are linked to potential improvements in outcomes such as reduced
relapse rates, shorter hospital stays, and psychotic symptoms, as well as improved function-
ality in patients with first-episode psychosis up to 24 months following the intervention [97].
It has therefore been suggested that these interventions should be incorporated into mental
health services, as they offer benefits such as reducing the burden on carers and improving
their emotional well-being, as well as helping them to cope with challenges such as the
uncertainty and stigma associated with caring [98]. Despite the emphasis in the literature

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

14 of 79

on the need for a holistic and integrated approach [98], in our analysis, 24 articles focused
on carers, which is consistent with Claxton et al. [99], who suggest that carers’ needs and
the emotional impact of caring remain areas that are often neglected.

In terms of the age groups covered, they vary, but are mainly focused on adolescents
and young adults, with varying ranges, which is in line with McGorry et al. and Fusar-Poli
et al., who inform us about a youth-oriented intervention [32,100]. In our case, the age
range of 14–35 covers the largest number of studies. Some articles cover a wider population,
including ages as young as twelve or as old as sixty-five. This reflects the importance of
early intervention, particularly during the transition from adolescence to adulthood, and is
in line with Addington, who tells us that early intervention for psychosis should take place
from early adolescence to adulthood, with a gradual decline up to the age of sixty [101].
Others do not specify an age, suggesting a more comprehensive or generalist approach
to intervention. Overall, the diversity of age groups highlights the need for intervention
strategies adapted to different phases of life [102]. The health benefits also exist for later
implementation, returning to the example of the UK, where guidelines have extended the
age of eligibility to sixty-five [103].

In terms of interventions, CBT, CRT, and psychoeducational interventions stand out.
CBT was widely used, appearing alone in several articles [51,57,67,71,76,77,79] as well as
in combination with other modalities such as cognitive remediation, psychoeducation, and
case management [19,49,53,58,66,72–75,85,91]. Combinations including elements of CCT
and mindfulness-based therapies have also been identified [68,80]. This diversity reflects
growing evidence in the literature suggesting that integrated approaches are frequently
associated with better management of psychotic symptoms and promotion of functional
recovery, as they address both cognitive and behavioural aspects [98,104].

These data are consistent with Gergov et al., who report that there are benefits to offer-
ing cognitive, behavioural, or CBT and CRT psychotherapeutic interventions to patients, to
carers, or in group settings, especially when psychoeducational elements are included [105].
In addition, multi-component programmes such as NAVIGATE [92] and POTENTIAL [31]
reinforce the importance of comprehensive approaches that integrate multiple therapeutic
techniques and synergistically address the diverse needs of patients.

According to Breitborde et al., optimising interventions in the first psychotic episode
also involves a synergistic combination of interventions [106]. In this sense, psychoed-
ucation is a component of evidence-based intervention, as is case management with a
comprehensive approach to the patient’s needs [101,107]. Interventions such as OPUS [65],
which combines case management with social skills training and multi-family groups, are
examples of this integrated approach. They aim for both clinical stabilisation and social
reintegration. On the other hand, CBT is also effective in reducing positive symptoms,
while family interventions are effective in preventing relapse [108]. Williams et al. suggest
that psychological interventions and case management, together with pharmacotherapy,
are the central components of services for early psychosis to achieve sustained clinical
benefit [94].

These findings suggest that the diversity of interventions reflects the complexity of the
treatment of psychosis. To improve outcomes in a complex and heterogeneous syndrome
such as psychosis, it is necessary to employ complex intervention models globally [32]. This
comprehensive focus is essential given that early intervention services for psychosis are
effective in the broader context of mental health care, which is supported by various guide-
lines such as the Australian Clinical Guidelines for Early Psychosis [2]. At the educational
level, interventions aim to improve knowledge about the disease and its treatment, both
for patients and their carers, to facilitate treatment adherence and promote a supportive
environment [19,31,52,54,58,59,62,63,72–74,81–83,85,89–92]. Finally, at the social level, the

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

15 of 79

aim is to strengthen family and social relationships, improve communication and mutual
support, and reduce the emotionality expressed in family interactions, which is crucial for
successful recovery and maintenance of mental health [50,55,58,59,61,68,69,80,82,92].

In the analysis of the objectives of the interventions, there is an underlying multidi-
mensional basis that aims to promote improvements at different levels. There is variability
between programmes and types of interventions. This is consistent with findings in the
literature that point to the existence of multiple approaches [18,107]. Our findings were
consistent with these findings, with broad aims. Clinically, interventions aim to reduce
positive and negative psychotic symptoms, improve cognitive function, and prevent re-
lapse [19,31,49,51,53,56–61,63–68,70–79,82–87,89,91–93]. Functionally, the focus is on restor-
ing social, occupational, and educational skills to enable meaningful reintegration into
society [19,31,49,51,57,59,64,66,68,70–77,79,84,91,92]. Psychological aims include support-
ing emotional well-being, reducing psychological distress for both patients and carers, and
promoting a more stable and less stressful family environment [31,49,50,54–57,59,67,69,72–
77,80–83,88–90,92]. These goals highlight the importance of a holistic approach to recovery,
which goes beyond symptom reduction and promotes an overall improvement in the
quality of life and functioning of patients and their families. Fusar-Poli et al. refer to
secondary prevention by highlighting the fact that services promote the reduction in SUD.
In terms of interventions, they are based on improving the response to treatment, with
improvements in well-being, functioning, and social skills, and reducing the burden on
the family. They also promote the treatment of comorbid substance use and the prevention
of disease progression [32]. However, although the objectives of the interventions imply
health benefits, it is still unclear how they should be developed to enable their long-term
maintenance [109].

When analysing the frequency and duration of interventions, the programmes varied
considerably in terms of the number of sessions, length of treatment, duration of sessions,
frequency of interventions, and follow-up periods, reflecting the complexity of treating
psychotic illnesses and the need for individualised approaches. Our findings are consistent
with Birchwood’s studies, which indicate the existence of a critical period of intervention,
a period that can last up to 5 years, during which there is a possibility of achieving more
fruitful results [11]. Thus, the existence of variability in frequency is also in line with
Chan et al., who argue that interventions should be culturally adapted and tailored to the
individual needs of patients, highlighting the importance of a personalised approach to
treatment [110].

The variation in follow-up times highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring to
assess the long-term effectiveness of interventions and ensure the sustainability of thera-
peutic gains. However, the variation in follow-up times reflects the lack of a standardised
protocol and points to the need for future studies to explore the long-term effectiveness of
interventions in order to better guide clinical practice [94].

the maintenance of

Although early intervention in psychosis has positive short-term outcomes, there is still
after five years of
uncertainty about
treatment [18,111]. These findings are in line with Hegelstad, who confirmed the ben-
efits of early intervention but highlighted the need to identify strategies to maintain these
benefits in the long term [112]. Favourable outcomes are not always maintained in the long
term [111], especially when a transition to treatment as usual occurs [113].

these benefits

Interventions are delivered by a wide range of professionals, including clinical psy-
chologists, psychiatrists, mental health nurses, occupational therapists, and social workers.
The training and supervision of these professionals vary widely, from specialist training
in CBTp [49,58] to the implementation of intervention models such as NEAR [93,114] or
CRT [86].

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

16 of 79

Most interventions include regular supervision, feedback sessions, and, in some cases,
monitoring of adherence to the protocol (e.g., [85]), which has been associated with im-
proved treatment efficacy [115]. It also suggests that the quality of the intervention may be
directly related to the training and ongoing supervision provided to therapists. Further-
more, the presence of a multi-professional team, as in the ReARMS and OPUS programmes
(e.g., [65,75]), highlights the importance of a collaborative and holistic approach to the
treatment of psychosis. Nevertheless, there is considerable variation in the training of
intervention facilitators. Some studies report intensive and specific training (e.g., [58]),
while others mention minimal training or do not specify training criteria (e.g., [79]).

Regarding assessment, the results show that a wide variety of assessment instruments
are used in early intervention programmes for psychosis. The diversity of scales, covering
areas such as family functioning, quality of life, cognitive assessment, psychiatric symptoms,
social and occupational functioning, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and illness awareness,
highlights the complexity of psychosis treatment [94]. The multiplicity of domains assessed
highlights the need for a multidisciplinary and personalised approach to the quality of care
provided [116]. However, the variability of the instruments used may also indicate a lack
of standardisation, which can make it difficult to compare results between different studies
and programmes [116]. Thus, these results suggest the importance of continuing to explore
which tools offer greater sensitivity and specificity to assess the various dimensions of the
psychotic experience, promoting a better understanding of the illness and interventions
in its trajectory, ultimately improving treatment outcomes and guiding clinical practice.
Regarding implementation contexts, it has been found that inpatient environments can
be more disruptive in various psychosocial aspects, and, in the sense of recovery, it is
advocated that inpatient stays occur as a last measure and for the shortest time necessary,
with a smooth transition to care in the community (whether outpatient or community)
(e.g., [59,83,87,117]), which is in line with the majority of the articles selected where the
implementation context, although varied, takes place in outpatient settings (e.g., [58,64]),
at home (e.g., [49,51]), and in the community (e.g., [66,74]).

Even so, according to Siebert and colleagues, specialised inpatient services can be
an asset to effective global intervention in the event of the need for hospitalisation [118],
and communication between inpatient services and subsequent outpatient follow-up is an
indicator of quality [108].

Several limitations were identified in this review. Access to some full-text articles
was not always possible, potentially excluding relevant studies. Only studies published
in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French were included, as these were the languages
spoken by the authors. This ensured the quality of the review, but may have limited
its scope. Additionally, while some studies lacked detailed information on programme
characteristics, those with sufficient data to meet the review’s objectives were included.
Finally, the decision to exclude interventions not specifically designed for early psychosis
may have omitted broader approaches, though this was a necessary methodological choice.

5. Conclusions and Implications

This scoping review highlights the importance of early intervention in psychosis
and maps the extensive existing research on appropriate interventions in this area. By
identifying the characteristics of current programmes, we reveal a diversity of approaches
and variability in implementation strategies. This mapping provides a valuable resource
for adapting programmes to diverse political, social, and cultural contexts.

The implications of this mapping are considerable.

It provides a solid basis for
researchers and health professionals to explore interventions that can improve access to
mental health care. Furthermore, this review contributes to the development of a specific

Nurs. Rep. 2025, 15, 16

17 of 79

early intervention programme designed specifically for mental health nurses. Such a
programme would enhance their role in multidisciplinary teams and equip them with the
tools to provide timely, patient-centred care. While the findings of this review emphasize the
importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, they also highlight the unique contributions
that mental health nurses can make in supporting holistic and inclusive care. To improve
clinical practice and ensure high-quality mental health care, future research should focus
on exploring the effectiveness of the mapped interventions and how they can be adapted
to different contexts.

The intervention comprises a
self-help manual entitled
Reaching Out: Supporting a
Family Member or Friend with
First-Episode Psychosis. The
manual, based on
problem-solving therapy, is
divided into modules that
may be completed
independently by carers.
The objective is to improve
the well-being of carers and
enhance their caregiving
abilities. The content covers
a range of topics, including
improving physical and
mental health, developing
strategies to access support
services, supporting the
well-being of the person
with FEP, and managing the
effects of the illness. The
modules provide guidance
on addressing
communication challenges,
lack of motivation, social
withdrawal, risky
behaviours, sleep
disturbances, hallucinations,
delusions, weight gain,
medication adherence,
substance misuse,
aggression, and suicidal
behaviour. To support the
implementation of the
material, a research officer
conducts weekly telephone
calls to discuss specific
modules and clarify any
questions. This intervention
aims to empower carers by
equipping them with the
knowledge and practical
skills necessary to manage
their caregiving role while
maintaining their
well-being.

The intervention involved
five modules, each requiring
up to 2 h to complete,
consisting of reading and
exercise materials. The
modules were as follows:
(1) strengthening carer
well-being and coping skills;
(2) getting the best out of
support services;
(3) promoting the well-being
of the person with FEP,
focusing on preventing
relapse and understanding
treatment; (4) dealing with
the effects of the illness Part
A, which included
communication, lack of
motivation, social
withdrawal, risky and
unrestrained behaviour,
disturbed sleep,
hallucinations, and
delusions; and (5) dealing
with the effects of the illness
Part B, covering issues such
as weight gain, reluctance to
take medication, substance
misuse, aggression, and
suicidal behaviour. Carers
completed all modules
independently. Research
officers were trained to
follow a standardized
procedure for
communicating with
participants and collecting
data. To monitor treatment
adherence, a research officer
conducted weekly 10 min
telephone calls, asking
standardized questions
about the content of specific
modules. These calls also
provided an opportunity for
participants to clarify any
material from the modules.

(C-GAS)

The psychoeducational
intervention involves
running two simultaneous
and parallel groups: one for
parents and the other for
adolescents. The therapy is
divided into two main
phases, adapted from W.
McFarlane’s model: the
initiation/alliance phase and
the group phase, following a
Multifamily Therapy (MFT)
format. During the initiation
phase, three individual
sessions are conducted
separately for families and
adolescents. The group
phase consists of twelve
group sessions for patients
and parents, focusing on
problem-solving strategies to
manage daily life difficulties
related to the disease,
mitigate crises, and prevent
relapses. Written
psychoeducational material
is provided to both patients
and families. The structure
of each group session
includes the following
components:
Informal Talk (10 min): A
social conversation aimed at
building alliances and social
networks, avoiding
discussing problems.
Task Review (5 min): The
family targeted in the
previous session reviews the
implementation of
suggested solutions.
Seminar (10 min): A brief
presentation by a group
leader summarizing a
specific educational topic.
Word Round (15 min): An
informal discussion where
all members can share their
difficulties or concerns.
Troubleshooting (40 min):
Leaders select a dilemma or
conflict for group discussion.
Members brainstorm
solutions, which are
recorded and analysed. The
session ends with an action
plan agreed upon by the
group, based on the
preferred solution of the
family or patient involved.
Social and Informal Chat
(10 min): Participants engage
in conversations about
hobbies or personal interests,
intentionally avoiding
problem-related topics.

The intervention utilizes the
CIRCuiTS computerized
CRT programme,
implemented through three
different delivery modes:
intensive CRT, group CRT,
and independent CRT. Each
mode varies in the amount
of therapist contact but
offers the same total
treatment hours.
Intensive CRT: This mode
includes three components:
(1) therapy sessions with a
therapist, (2) in-vivo transfer
work where CRT strategies
are applied to real-life
situations with therapist
support, and
(3) independent CRT
activities set up by the
therapist, either on-site or
off-site during the
participant’s own time.
Group CRT: Participants
engage in group therapy
sessions with a closed
membership of four
participants per group, led
by one therapist. Sessions
start and end with group
activities focused on goal
setting and metacognition.
During the session,
participants independently
work on CIRCuiTS tasks,
with the therapist available
to provide assistance as
needed.
Independent CRT: This
mode involves an initial
individual session with a
therapist for orientation,
followed by sessions where
participants work
independently. Support for
these independent sessions
includes telephone contact
or drop-in sessions, available
on an as-needed basis but
limited to a maximum of one
hour of contact time per
fortnight. Sessions are
considered valid if they last
at least 20 min.

The intervention involves a
structured cognitive
rehabilitation programme
designed to enhance
memory, complex planning,
and problem-solving skills
through graded tasks and
systematic training. The
programme consists of the
following key components:
Therapist Demonstration:
The therapist explicitly
demonstrates information
processing strategies.
Overt Practice: Participants
practised these strategies
openly under the therapist’s
guidance.
Covert Practice: As
proficiency increases,
participants progress to
using these strategies
covertly.
Responsibilities:
Participants engage in
progressively challenging
tasks aimed at developing
cognitive skills.
They apply information
processing strategies and
organisational techniques.
Errors are minimised
through regulated and
monitored task execution.
Participants work towards
increasing their independent
use of cognitive strategies
over time.
Supervision and Monitoring:
Therapist adherence to the
intervention protocol is
ensured through direct
observation.
Regular supervision sessions
are conducted to provide
continuous support and
ensure fidelity to the
programme.

CRT: This intervention
integrates a NEAR with the
Cogpack software to
improve cognitive abilities.
NEAR Approach:
Group Sessions: These
sessions are designed to
promote social interaction
and consolidate learning.
Focus: Emphasises setting
both short- and long-term
goals, encouraging patients
to develop insight and
motivation.
Socio-emotional Context:
Stresses the importance of
understanding the
socio-emotional
environment and its effects
on cognitive performance.

Transdiagnostic Cognitive
Therapy: Based on
Perceptual Control Theory
(Powers, 2005), this
approach addresses goal
conflicts and supports the
reorganization process
through the Method of
Levels (MOL).
MOL:
Sessions: Therapists
facilitate sessions where
individuals discuss
whatever is on their mind,
focusing on
“disruptions”—brief shifts in
awareness. The therapist
encourages elaboration on
these moments to explore
underlying issues.
Consistent Principles:
Unified Approach: The core
principles of MOL remain
consistent across different
issues, streamlining the
training and supervision of
professionals.
User-Determined Focus:
Tailored Therapy: The
therapy is customised to
address the individual’s
specific needs, with the
focus of the sessions guided
by the service user.
User-Led Scheduling:
Enhanced Autonomy:
Service users have
significant control over the
timing and content of their
therapy sessions, promoting
greater engagement and
self-direction.

Programme Overview: The
intervention integrates
formal meditation practices
tailored for individuals with
psychosis and social
cognition exercises inspired
by SCIT. It utilises
mindfulness approaches
including the
Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction (MBSR)
programme,
Mindfulness-Based
Cognitive Therapy (MBCT),
and the Mindful
Self-Compassion (MSC)
programme.

Cognitive Modules: Consists
of eight modules covering:
Core Module: Functional
analysis of suicidality,
reasons for suicide,
hopelessness, and reasons
for living.
Additional Modules:
Problem-solving training,
psychoeducation for
psychosis, emotional pain
tolerance, stress
management, self-esteem
enhancement, help-seeking,
and social skills training.
Final Closure/Handover:
The therapist and patient
review and confirm the
suicidality formulation.
Identification of early
warning signs and triggers
for suicidal ideation or
behaviours.
Reinforcement of
suicide-protective strategies,
including support for
self-esteem and help-seeking
options.

Active Cognitive Therapy
for Early Psychosis (ACE):
This CBT approach involves:
Assessment: Evaluates both
psychotic and non-psychotic
complaints, along with their
relationship to the
participant’s life history.
Formulation and
Prioritisation: Uses a
flowchart to prioritize
treatment areas, focusing on:
Risk Issues: Addressed as a
priority.
Positive Psychotic
Symptoms: If distressing
and present.
Co-morbidities: Managing
additional disorders.
Negative Symptoms:
Addressing impairments in
motivation and emotion.
Issues of Identity and
Relapse Prevention:
Ensuring long-term stability.
Treatment Approach: Each
identified difficulty is
addressed from a broadly
cognitive–behavioural
perspective.

CBT:
Initial Psychoeducation: The
first three sessions focused
on psychoeducation,
conducted early in the
therapy to provide
foundational knowledge.
Relapse Prevention: The
final two sessions, scheduled
towards the end of therapy,
concentrated on strategies
for relapse prevention.
Module-Based Approach:
Post-assessment and
engagement, the therapy
followed a manual with
modules targeting various
symptom areas, including
delusions, hallucinations,
negative symptoms, and
comorbid conditions.
Stabilization and Relapse
Prevention: Offered towards
the end of treatment to
consolidate gains and
prepare for future challenges.
Optional Caregiver
Involvement: If available,
five optional sessions were
provided for parents or
caregivers, with the final
session including both
caregivers and the patient.

CRT Programme:
Computerised Interactive
Remediation of
Cognition-Training for
Schizophrenia (CIRCuiTS):
This web-based CRT
programme focuses on
enhancing metacognition
and cognitive functions such
as attention, memory, and
executive functioning
through massed practice.
The programme involves
collaborative goal setting for
real-world tasks, with
exercises progressively
increasing in difficulty based
on participant performance.
Initial weeks include remote
practice sessions, which
continue alongside in-person
therapy.
Social Recovery Therapy
(SRT): Conducted from
weeks 5 to 10 in conjunction
with the CRT programme,
SRT is informed by
cognitive–behavioural
theory and targets
individual goals. It is
delivered in three stages:
Stage 1: Engagement and
formulation to identify
problems and establish a
therapeutic relationship.
Stage 2: Preparation for new
activities, including
identifying pathways and
collaborating with
community stakeholders.
Stage 3: Engagement in new
activities using behavioural
experiments to encourage
social interaction.

The cognitive training
programme was structured
into four modules, targeting
different cognitive domains.
The first three modules
addressed attention,
executive functions, and
learning/memory. The
fourth module was
customized based on the
participant’s needs,
determined through a
combined evaluation with
the trainer.
Modules Overview:
Modules 1–2: Focused on
computer exercises for
focused, divided, and
sustained attention, as well
as planning, strategy
learning, and
problem-solving. Tasks
progressed in difficulty

everyday tasks such as meal
preparation and
compensatory training.
Module 4: Offered a tailored
combination of computer
exercises and practical tasks
based on the individual’s
specific needs.
Training Approach:
Bottom-Up Approach:
Emphasized repetitive drills
and practice to enhance
cognitive processing and
automaticity.
Top-Down Approach:
Included strategy learning
and guided problem-solving
tailored to individual
resources.
Compensatory Strategies:
Incorporated calendar
training within the
learning/memory module.
Innovative Elements:
Competence Dialogues:
Semi-structured interviews
conducted every other week
aimed at maintaining
motivation and bridging
cognitive training with
real-world skills. These
dialogues focused on work
competencies,
self-experienced cognitive
competencies, and social
skills, facilitating the
application of learned skills
beyond cognitive exercises.

COPE is structured into four
phases, though progression
through these phases is
flexible:
Engagement: Initial phase
focused on building rapport
and setting the stage for
therapy.
Assessment: Lasts 3–4
sessions and involves
creating an agenda or
contract that includes
psychoeducation, addressing
stigma and identity issues,
and tackling problems
related to motivation and
confidence.
Adaptation: Focuses on
adapting strategies to
individual needs and
circumstances.

The comprehensive
intervention package
integrates pharmacological
treatment with a
multi-component
psychosocial intervention,
including CBT-oriented
individual psychotherapy,
psychoeducational sessions
for families, and
recovery-oriented case
management. After the
2-year intervention period of
the Pr-EP protocol, patients
and families may continue
with treatment as usual,
which includes
pharmacological therapy
and general case
management support,
without necessarily being
discharged from mental
health services.
The Pr-EP involves four
main processes:
identification, assessment,
intervention for FEP
patients, and intervention
for UHR individuals (such
as those with Brief Limited
Intermittent Psychotic
Symptoms (BLIPS),
Attenuated Psychotic
Symptoms (APS), and
Genetic Risk and Functional
Decline (GRFD)). Each
process includes specific
procedures carried out in
specialized mental health
settings with defined
durations, timings, and
schedules.
CBT-oriented individual
psychotherapy follows the
model developed by Fowler,
Garety, and Kuipers (1995).
For UHR individuals, an
adapted model designed by
van der Gaag et al. (2012) for
psychosis-risk syndrome is
utilized.

Expert multi-
professional
teams, including
psychiatrists,
clinical
psychologists, and
case managers

period, a
minimum of five
monitoring
assessments (one
every 6 months)
are conducted,
including
re-administration
of the Pr-EP

Individual and Group CBT:
Patients receive both
individual and group CBT.
The first module covers
hypothetical reasoning,
stress management,
self-esteem and mood,
substance consumption,
assertiveness, and
communication skills. The
second module focuses on
developing assertiveness
and communication skills
through role-playing, with
social functioning practiced
in weekly group activities.
Cognitive Remediation
Therapy: Cognitive deficits
are treated with
computerized cognitive
remediation using tools like
Rehacom. The intensity and
duration of treatment are
tailored to the severity of
deficits determined by
neuropsychological
evaluations.
Substance Misuse Support:
Patients with substance
misuse issues are referred to
addiction services, where
they receive motivational
interviews and may be
hospitalized to aid in ceasing
substance use.
Systemic Therapy:
Suggested to address family
functioning disruptions,
either with or without the
patient. Monthly sessions
with the psychiatrist and
close relatives provide
psychoeducative guidance
on symptoms of FEP, daily
functioning, and the
vulnerability–stress model.

In the initial phase of CBT,
patients and therapists
collaboratively identify key
issues and set goals for the
therapy. A personalised
maintenance plan is then
created. The subsequent
phases are dedicated to
implementing change
strategies as detailed in a
published manual,
examining historical factors
contributing to the onset of
first-episode psychosis, and
concluding with a phase
focused on relapse
prevention.

approaches:
SCIT: Begins with group
sessions targeting social
cognition domains,
including emotion
recognition, theory of mind,
and interaction skills. The
training is structured into
three phases:
Phase I (Sessions 1–6):
Focuses on emotion
perception and
self-awareness, including
emotion mimicry and
understanding paranoia.
Phase II (Sessions 7–15):
Addresses theory of mind,
social perception, and
attributional biases, teaching
participants to differentiate
facts from guesses and
gather evidence.
Phase III (Sessions 16–24):
Applies learned skills to
real-life situations,
emphasizing generalization
to daily life.
CCT: Uses a strategy-based
approach to enhance
cognitive functions:
Sessions 1–6: Focus on
prospective memory, goal
setting, and planning.
Sessions 7–12: Target
conversational and task
vigilance, using “self-talk” to
maintain focus.
Sessions 13–18: Improve
verbal learning and memory
through information
reduction and
name-learning.
Sessions 19–24: Enhance
executive functioning and
cognitive flexibility with
brainstorming and
problem-solving techniques.

re-enter school or work receive cognitively oriented skills training.
Family interventions, adapted from Anderson and colleagues’ model,
provide early-phase illness information for younger first-episode patients.
An active support group for families, including parents and relatives,
offers emotional support and collaborates with programme staff on
additional services. Individual therapy includes supportive
psychotherapy and problem-solving to address daily challenges and
psychosis-related trauma, while cognitive–behavioural interventions
target anxiety, depression, and persistent symptoms. All group and
family interventions follow established manuals.

Individual psychotherapy aims to build a strong therapeutic alliance,
enhance insight, and recognise early warning signs and high-stress
situations to prevent future relapse; it also focuses on understanding and
integrating psychotic symptoms with the patient’s experience,
encouraging emotional expression, and improving emotional
management; group psychotherapy seeks to enhance communication
with peers, improve insight and treatment adherence, and foster a sense
of connection through shared experiences. It helps patients find meaning
in their psychotic experiences, express their emotions and feelings about
social and family relationships, and address group dynamics to better
manage daily interactions.

Improve participants’ cognitive skills through CR, thereby facilitating
various CBTp processes beyond symptom reduction, such as developing
a shared understanding of the patient’s problems (an agreed
formulation); additionally, the intervention aims to reduce delusions and
hallucinations more effectively and earlier when CBTp is preceded by CR,
and to enable CBTp to be completed more quickly or achieve greater
progress before completion by enhancing cognitive skills with CR.
