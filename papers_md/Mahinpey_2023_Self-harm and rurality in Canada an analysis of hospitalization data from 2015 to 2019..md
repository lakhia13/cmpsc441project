Abstract
Purpose  The incidence of self-harm is an important indicator in suicide surveillance and a target outcome for suicide preven-
tion. Self-harm rates vary by geographic location and rurality appears to be a risk factor. The objectives of this study were to 
estimate rates of self-harm hospitalization in Canada over a 5-year period by sex and age group, and examine relationships 
between self-harm and rurality.
Methods  Hospitalizations related to self-harm were identified in a national dataset (the Discharge Abstract Database) for all 
patients aged 10 years or older who were discharged from hospital between 2015 and 2019. Self-harm hospitalization rates 
were calculated and stratified by year, sex, age group, and level of rurality, as measured using the Index of Remoteness. A 
Poisson regression was fit to estimate rate ratios for the levels of rurality.
Results  Rates of self-harm hospitalization were higher for females than males across all levels of rurality and increased with 
each level for both sexes, except for among young males. The widest rural-to-urban disparities were observed for the 10–19 
and 20–34-year old age groups. Females aged 10–19 in very remote areas had the highest self-harm hospitalization rate.
Conclusion  The rate of self-harm hospitalization in Canada varied by sex, age group, and level of rurality. Clinical and 
community-based interventions for self-harm, such as safety planning and increased access to mental health services, should 
be tailored to the differential risks across geographic contexts.

Introduction

Self-harm has a complex etiology that includes biological, 
social, psychological, and environmental dimensions [1]. It 
is defined as acts of "intentional self-poisoning or injury, 
irrespective ofthe apparent purpose” [2]. Suicide attempts 
and non-suicidal self-injuries are both forms of self-harm, 
and are risk factors for hospitalization and suicide death [3]. 
Self-harm is a target outcome in suicide prevention [4].

In Canada, the rate of self-harm hospitalization is one 
the  main  indicators  used  in  suicide  and  mental  health

surveillance [5], and is a proxy for suicide attempts [6]. 
Between 1994 and 2014, the self-harm hospitalization rate 
fell from 87 to 50 hospitalizations per 100,000 population 
[7]. In 2018, the rate was about two times higher among 
females than males (60.1 vs. 34.4 per 100,000) [6]. This pat-
tern contrasts with suicide mortality, which has rates that are 
about three times higher among males [8], and is a paradox 
evident in many high-income countries [9]. In 2018, self-
harm was one of the ten leading causes of hospitalization 
in Canada among people aged 15–19 and 20–24 years [6]. 
Identifying populations at elevated risk of self-harm is a key 
goal in suicide prevention strategies [4].

Rurality is an important contextual factor in the epide-
miology of self-harm [10]. In Canada, rural–urban differ-
ences have been observed for many non-communicable 
diseases,  injuries,  and  causes  of  death.  [11].  Much  of 
the research on suicide-related outcomes and rurality in 
Canada has focused on suicide mortality [12–15], specific 
age groups [14,  16–19], or provinces/territories [15– 18,

20], with limited evidence on rural–urban differences in 
hospitalization [16, 17, 21].

A  recent  study  found  that  suicide  was  the  second 
leading cause of preventable death in remote communi-
ties [22]. Other Canadian studies have reported conflict-
ing results [12–17, 19–21, 23]: some found that rates of 
suicide [13,  15,  20,  21] and self-harm [16,  17,  19,  21] 
were  higher  in  rural  regions,  while  others  reported  no 
rural–urban differences [12, 14, 18].

The rural–urban pattern in Canada is different than in 
the United Kingdom and Ireland, where rates of self-harm 
and suicide tend to be higher in urban areas after adjusting 
for socio-economic deprivation [24]. In Canada, there is 
a pronounced gradient in rates of self-harm and suicide 
across  levels  of  deprivation  [25,  26],  though  how  this 
influences rural–urban differences is less clear. A national 
prospective cohort study of adults aged 25 or older found 
that after controlling for individual and area-level factors 
including income and deprivation, rates of suicide among 
males were higher in rural and small urban areas than in the 
largest cities; results for females varied [12]. These findings 
were corroborated by a recent study from one Canadian 
province (Ontario), which reported an increased risk of 
suicide among males, but not females, in rural areas. How-
ever, rural males and females had higher risks for self-harm 
hospitalization than urban populations, even after depriva-
tion and other social factors were taken into account [21].
One of the challenges for epidemiological studies in 
rural health is that rurality is not measured in a consist-
ent or standardized way; this affects the comparability of 
results, especially across settings [24,  27]. Some defini-
tions of rurality use binary rural/urban categories based 
on population density [28]. Another common approach 
is to stratify populations across “metropolitan influenced 
zones,” allowing differentiation between areas outside of 
census metropolitan areas (urban areas with a population 
of at least 100,000) and census agglomerations (areas with 
population of at least 10,000) [29,  30]. A limitation of 
both definitions is that they do not distinguish between 
rural and remote regions. This is particularly important in 
Canada, where many small and low density communities 
are distributed over large geographical areas, notably in 
the Arctic and subarctic or northern regions [31].

The objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate rates 
of hospitalization due to self-harm at a subnational level 
over a five-year period (2015–2019) by sex and age group; 
and (2) assess the impact of rurality on self-harm hospi-
talization rates, by sex and age group. In the context of sui-
cide prevention, evidence about the relationship between 
self-harm and rurality can help inform public health inter-
ventions and social policies.

Methods

Data source and primary outcome

The Canadian Institute for Health Information’s Discharge 
Abstract Database (DAD) was the main source of data in 
this study. The DAD is comprised of demographic, admin-
istrative, and clinical information about patients discharged 
from acute care. Hospital-based care is part of the universal, 
publicly funded healthcare system in Canada. Because acute 
care facilities in all provinces and territories except Quebec 
are required to submit data to the DAD, it is a comprehensive 
and robust dataset of hospital discharges. The DAD does not 
include patients who visited the emergency department but 
were not admitted to hospital. That is, a patient with an epi-
sode of self-harm who presented to the emergency depart-
ment, received an assessment and treatment, and was then 
discharged, would not be included in the DAD. Rather, the 
DAD captures the less frequent, but typically more medi-
cally serious self-harm events that may require interventions 
such as trauma management or involuntary admission for 
safety or for psychiatric care.

For the present study, we used a subnational version of 
the DAD that covered 77% of the 2016 population of Can-
ada. Data from two northern territories, Northwest Territo-
ries and Yukon, were excluded because population estimates 
by sex and age group at the census subdivision level (CSD; 
municipalities or small areas equivalent to a municipality) 
[32], which were needed for stratified analysis by level of 
rurality, were not available.

The DAD is coded with the International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th 
Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) [33]. The primary outcome 
in this study was self-harm hospitalizations, identified by 
ICD-10 diagnosis codes for intentional self-injuries (X60-
X84 and Y87.0). These codes include suicide attempts and 
non-suicidal self-injuries because it is not possible to dis-
tinguish suicidal from non-suicidal forms of self-harm in 
the discharge diagnosis fields. Patients who died in hospi-
tal because of their injuries (n = 897) were excluded from 
all analyses; cases from jurisdictions that provided data 
but lacked record-level CSD information (n = 2137) were 
excluded from the rurality analysis.

We analyzed data on all patients aged 10 or older who 
were discharged from a hospital with a diagnosis of self-
harm between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2020. DAD uses 
fiscal years (April 1 to March 31), rather than calendar years. 
The fivefiscal-year study period was chosen to establish pre-
COVID-19 baseline hospitalization rates.

Rurality

Rurality was measured using the Index of Remoteness [34] 
developed by Statistics Canada. Unlike other measures of 
rurality [35], this index captures geographic remoteness by 
considering population size and distance from points of ser-
vice provision for each census subdivision [36]. By using 
population size and accessibility to other areas, the Index of 
Remoteness attempts to differentiate between urban, rural, and 
remote regions. The Index is based on 2016 Census data and 
geographic boundaries.

Each census subdivision is assigned a remoteness index 
(RI) value ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 being the least remote 
(and most urban) and 1, the most remote. The most remote 
areas are those with the smallest populations and low acces-
sibility to population centers. A previous study categorized RI 
scores according to five natural breaks, while also considering 
the number of census subdivisions and the population distribu-
tion in each category [22, 37]. The categories are: easily acces-
sible (RI score < 0.1500), accessible (0.1500 to 0.2888), less 
accessible (0.2889 to 0.3898), remote (0.3899 to 0.5532), and 
very remote (> 0.5532). The Index of Remoteness is mapped 
to DAD data via the census subdivision of each discharged 
patient’s place of residence.

Analyses

We calculated crude and age-standardized self-harm hospitali-
zation rates overall, and by year, sex, age group, and rurality. We 
used a binary variable for sex (male/female) because the num-
ber of hospitalizations with sex coded as non-binary (including 
transgender, intersex, sex unknown, or other) accounted for less 
than 0.1% of all cases; these cases could not be disaggregated 
and so were excluded from the analyses. We used 5-year age 
groups for the overall and sex-stratified analysis. To avoid small 
cell counts for the rurality analysis, we used four life course 
age groups (10–19, 20–34, 35–64, 65 +). Population data were 
drawn from Statistics Canada’s annual demographic estimates 
for the denominators in rate calculations; the 2011 Canadian 
Census population was used as the standard population. A Pois-
son regression was fit to estimate rate differences and rate ratios 
with 95% confidence intervals for the effect of rurality on self-
harm hospitalization, using the least remote area (easily acces-
sible) as the reference group. Analyses were conducted in SAS 
Enterprise Guide version 7.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results

Self‑harm hospitalization rates by sex and age 
group

We identified 68,378 self-harm hospitalizations between 
2015 and 2019 (Table 1). For the five-year period, the 
overall age-standardized self-harm hospitalization rate 
was 54.4 hospitalizations per 100,000. The annual rate fell 
slightly from 55.4 per 100,000 in 2015 to 52.0 per 100,000 
in 2019, though confidence intervals between consecu-
tive years often overlapped, which suggested that rates 
were not always significantly different. The five-year age-
standardized rate for females was 70.2 per 100,000 (95% 
CI 69.5–70.8); the rate for males was 39.9 per 100,000 
(95% CI 39.4–40.4). Each year during the period, rates 
were higher among females than males (Table 2).

Five-year self-harm hospitalization rates by sex and age 
group are reported in Fig. 1. For both males and females, 
self-harm hospitalization rates peaked in the 15–19-year 
age group. Rates were significantly higher for females than 
males for age groups under 65 years old. In the two old-
est age groups (85–89 and 90 years and older), males had 
higher rates than females.

Populations in very remote areas had a 6.5 times higher 
rate  (an  additional  215.9  self-harm  hospitalizations  per 
100,000), compared with populations in easily accessible 
areas (Table 3). Compared with easily accessible areas, all 
other levels of rurality had higher rates of self-harm hos-
pitalization for females, males, and both sexes combined 
(Table  3).  Among  females,  the  rate  ratio  was  7.5  times 
higher in very remote areas, compared with easily acces-
sible areas; the rate among males in very remote areas was 
5.0 times higher.

Figure 3 shows self-harm hospitalization rates for females 
and males, by age group and rurality. Rates increased with 
each level of rurality for all age groups except 65 or older. 
For both sexes, the largest rate differences were between 
very remote and easily accessible areas among 10–19 year-
olds, followed by 20–34-year-olds (Fig. 3). For females, 
rates decreased with age across all levels of rurality. A simi-
lar pattern was found for males, except in the 10–19-year age 
group, who had similar or lower rates compared to males 
aged 20–35 years.

Discussion

Self‑harm hospitalization rate by rurality

We identified 66,241 self-harm hospitalizations between 
2015 and 2019 that had census subdivision information, and 
so could be used for analyses by rurality. Age-standardized 
self-harm hospitalization rates were highest for males and 
females in very remote areas (Fig. 2). Across all levels of 
rurality, self-harm hospitalization rates were significantly 
higher for females than males. For each additional level of 
rurality, there was a significant increase in the rate of self-
harm hospitalization for both sexes (Fig. 2).

This study examined self-harm hospitalization rates by year, 
sex, age group, and rurality in Canada from 2015 to 2019. 
Age-standardized rates were relatively stable over the study 
period, with females having significantly higher rates than 
males each year. For both sexes, rates were highest among 
15- to 19-year-olds. The age-standardized rate increased 
along a gradient of rurality, with the highest rates in the 
most remote areas. Although rurality affected both males 
and females, rate ratios were higher for females than males 
in more remote areas, compared with easily accessible areas. 
Differences were most pronounced for the 10–19 and 20–34 
age groups.

These results reveal substantial disparities in self-harm 
between rural and urban areas in Canada, which aligns with 
evidence from British Columbia [16] and Ontario [17, 21]. 
The rural–urban gradient in self-harm is also similar to the 
national pattern of suicide mortality [12, 13]. The magni-
tude of the rate disparities in our study may have been exac-
erbated by the lack of adjustment for social and material 
deprivation, which is strongly associated with self-harm and 
suicide [24–26, 38, 39].

Although our results were consistent with several Cana-
dian studies [16,  17, 21], research from Ireland and the 

United Kingdom revealed an inverse association between 
self-harm and rurality [24, 40]. That is, after controlling 
for deprivation, the risk of self-harm was higher in urban 
compared with rural areas. However, deprivation does not 
fully explain the spatial patterning in urban areas [41]. 
The contrasting trends in self-harm across the rural–urban 
continuum in high-income, English-speaking counties in 
Europe compared with Canada and the United States [42] 
suggests  the  influence  of  other  factors  that  may  differ 
between these contexts, such as firearm ownership and 
population density.

Across all levels of rurality, our results showed that 
self-harm hospitalization rates were higher for females, 
especially in rural and remote areas. This finding sug-
gests that females in these communities may experience 
elevated risks compared to males and urban females, pos-
sibly due to factors such as chronic disease multimorbid-
ity [43,  44] and experiences of violence. For example, 

women  in  rural  and  remote  communities  in  Canada 
experience higher rates of police-reported intimate part-
ner violence (IPV) [45, 46]. Although self-reported data 
indicates that the prevalence of IPV is similar across lev-
els of rurality [46], IPV among rural and remote women 
may be more severe and chronic [46,  47]. The associa-
tion between such forms of gender-based violence and 
self-harm [48, 49] may play a role in the elevated rates of

self-harm hospitalizations for females in rural and remote 
areas.

Although  hospitalization  rates  were  higher  among 
females,  males  have  higher  rates  of  suicide  mortality 
[10, 21, 50]. Lower self-harm hospitalization rates among 
males may be due, in part, to males using more lethal 
means (for instance, firearms) in suicide attempts. [51]. 
Examining self-harm case fatality may further disentangle 
possible sex-specific relationships between rurality and 
suicide means. Another possible explanation for the sex 
differences in hospitalization is that cultural norms about 
masculinity may dissuade males in rural communities 
from seeking care for self-harm [52]. Even so, the risk of 
self-harm hospitalization was higher for rural than urban 
males, which may be related to differences in access to 
services between settings [53,  54]. Rural males may be 
more receptive to interventions which are short-term, col-
laborative, and oriented toward problem-solving [55].

In our study, rural adolescents (aged 10–19) had the 
highest rates of self-harm hospitalization and the largest 
rate differences and ratios. Adolescents experience a con-
stellation of risk factors for self-harm including depressed 
mood, impulsivity, conflict with peers and family, child-
hood maltreatment, and psychological distress [56–58]. Our 
results align with other North American studies that have 
found self-harm hospitalization rates to be higher among 
rural than urban youth [16, 17, 59]. Rural adolescents may 
be a particularly vulnerable, owing to limited access to 
mental health services [60], stigma associated with seeking 
help, and lack of awareness of mental health resources [61].
Interventions that may reduce self-harm among rural 
youth include increasing access to mental health services 
[62], public health campaigns that address norms related 
to help-seeking [63], and efforts to encourage participa-
tion extracurricular activities to foster bonds with peers 
[64]. As primary care and emergency departments are 
often the first point of contact for adolescents who self-
harm [65], clinical and system interventions for self-harm 
such as safety planning and increasing access to care, 
should be tailored to the differential risks across geo-
graphic contexts.

Strengths and limitations

A strength of this study is that we used a definition of self-
harm based on an internationally standardized classifica-
tion system and a multifaceted, scaled definition of rurality. 
We chose the Index of Remoteness because it is based on 
population size and accessibility to other regions. Thus, we 
were able to distinguish between rural and remote regions, 
unlike studies of self-harm and suicide using binary meas-
ures of rurality [14, 17, 19, 66], which can obscure differ-
ences between diverse rural contexts. This is an important 

consideration in Canada, one of the least densely populated 
countries in the world, where residents of remote communi-
ties may experience place-specific risks. Another strength of 
our study is that the dataset had comprehensive coverage for 
most provinces and territories.

Several limitations should be considered when interpret-
ing the results. Not all cases of self-harm hospitalization 
were included in our analyses. We did not use data from 
Quebec, Northwest Territories, or Yukon. These three juris-
dictions have proportionately large Indigenous populations 
in remote regions [67], and some rural and northern Indig-
enous communities have high rates of self-harm compared 
with the general population [68]. Consequently, our estimate 
of the national self-harm hospitalization rate for the most 
remote areas may be less representative than our estimate 
of the national rate for urban areas.

The DAD does not include patients who visited the emer-
gency department because of self-harm but were not hospi-
talized. Therefore, we likely captured the more medically 
serious non-fatal incidents, but not all episodes of hospi-
tal-treated self-harm. In the suicide surveillance indicator 
framework used in Canada, self-harm hospitalizations and 
suicide deaths are recognized as less frequent, but more 
harmful, outcomes [5, 68]. Other datasets based on emer-
gency department visits [17] and population surveys [69] 
provide evidence about more prevalent but less severe out-
comes such as suicidal ideation [70]. This “iceberg” model 
[68, 71] requires indicators across a continuum of lethality 
in order to describe the scope and scale of suicidality in 
the population. Our study provides evidence on only one 
outcome in this model.

Owing to the nature of the data, we were unable to ana-
lyze co-variates such as income, marginalization, or dep-
rivation, either at the individual or area level. This meant 
that we could not adjust for the confounding effects of these 
social determinants, which are associated with self-harm, 
especially in high-income countries [38,  39]. Examining 
relationships between self-harm and chronic diseases or 
multimorbidity of physical and mental illnesses was also not 
within the scope of our study. These factors are known to be 
associated with suicidal behaviour [44], increase the odds 
of seeking hospital care [72], and may be more prevalent 
among females and rural populations [43]. Even without 
adjusting for these confounders, our results were consist-
ent with recent evidence from Canada’s largest province 
(Ontario) which indicated that, after controlling for income, 
immigration status, marginalization, and chronic conditions, 
males and females in rural areas were significantly more 
likely to attempt suicide than were their urban counterparts, 
[21]. Future research with national data could clarify rela-
tionships  between  rurality,  socio-economic  deprivation, 
chronic disease status, and sex differences in self-harm.

Another limitation was the difficulty of ascertaining injury 
intent, which may have resulted in misclassifications of those 
who presented to the hospital [73]. This may have led to an 
underestimation of self-harm in the population, particularly 
for self-harm by poisoning, where the intent of an overdose 
may be difficult to determine [74]. To minimize the effects of 
the pandemic on our results, DAD data collected after March 
31, 2020 were not included in this study. Additional analyses 
to understand the impact of the pandemic on self-harm in 
Canada is needed. Early evidence on self-harm-related emer-
gency department visits suggests that the pandemic may have 
had a differential impact on urban and rural populations [70].

Conclusion

This  population-based  study  produced  subnational  esti-
mates of self-harm hospitalization by rurality in Canada. 
A rural–urban gradient in self-harm hospitalization was 
evident—rates were lowest in urban areas and highest in 
the most remote communities. Rates were highest among 
females aged 15–19 and females in very remote areas. These 
findings underscore the need to design population-based and 
targeted interventions for rural and remote contexts. Ongo-
ing public health surveillance is required to understand the 
impact of the pandemic on self-harm, and the contribution 
of different methods of self-harm to risk of hospitalization 
and mortality.
