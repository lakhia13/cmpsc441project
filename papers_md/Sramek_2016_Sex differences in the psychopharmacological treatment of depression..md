Introduction

  There  is  extensive  literature  on  the  topic  of  sex 

differences  in  antidepressant  treatment.1  Sex  differ-
ences  in  antidepressant  efficacy  have  been  linked  to 
sex-related  physiological  differences,  behavioral  char-
acteristics,  comorbid  diseases,  menopause,  pregnancy, 
and adherence, among other factors. Although conclu-
sions are tempered by the variability existing in levels 
and  durations  of  exposure  to  antidepressants,  these 
data do provide a spectrum of intrinsic factors that are 
considered  to  be  prognostically  important.  For  exam-
ple, variance in body fat, hormone levels, and liver me-
tabolism between sexes have been shown to affect the 
pharmacokinetics of a drug when orally administered. 
Sex-specific  factors  have  been  identified  in  the  clini-
cal  presentation,  prevalence,  and  resiliency  of  depres-
sion. This  paper  will  review  the  clinical  literature  and 
research on sex-related differences in the efficacy and 
pharmacokinetics of antidepressants, including female-
specific variables, and how these differences can affect 
the outcome of antidepressant treatment.

Sex differences in the pathogenesis 
of depression

The incidence of depression in women is nearly double 
that in men.2,3 This is independent of diagnostic nomen-
clature, including atypical depression, unipolar depres-
sion, dysthymia, and seasonal affective disorder.4-6 These 

Although  a  number  of  studies  have  observed  that  fe-
males  respond  better  to  serotonergic  antidepressants 
than  males  and  that  postmenopausal  females  have  a 
diminished response to antidepressants compared with 
younger  females,  there  are  also  studies  that  conflict 
with both of these findings, making any generalizations 
regarding sex differences difficult to make. Sex variance 
in antidepressant efficacy and pharmacokinetics profiles 
have been attributed to sex-based physiological differ-
ences,  behavioral  differences,  related  disorders,  and 
sex-specific conditions, including pregnancy and meno-
pause. This paper will review the history and current re-
search on sex effects of antidepressant treatment.

differences have been found across all age groups.7 The 
lifetime risk of major depression in the United States is 
21% in females versus 13% in males.8 Symptom presen-
tation  is  generally  more  severe  in  women.  Depressed 
females  typically  experience  prolonged  or  recurrent 
depression more than depressed males, with a younger 
onset age and lower quality of life.9 Depressed females 
generally  experience  greater  weight  gain,  anxiety,  and 
physical manifestations of their disease than depressed 
men.10-13
  The  causes  of  these  differences  in  clinical  presenta-
tion  and  response  to  pharmacotherapy  between  sexes 
are unknown, but several theories exist. Sex differences 
in the incidence of depression generally materialize dur-
ing adolescence, which has led to suggestions that female 
susceptibility  may  be  linked  to  surges  in  reproductive 
hormones (estrogen and progesterone) during puberty.14 
The incidence of depression in women after menopause 
(when  reproductive  hormones  stabilize)  appears  to  be 
similar  to  that  in  men.15  Levels  of  estradiol  (E2)  have 
also been reported to be lowered in depressed premeno-
pausal and perimenopausal women.16,17 Estrogen and se-
rotonin appear to interact in significant ways. In animals, 
estrogen  induces  changes  in  brain  serotonin  transmis-
sion, binding, and metabolism.18

Sex-related differences in the prevalence of depres-
sion  may  also  be  affected  by  differential  monoamine 
functioning  between  sexes.  Monoamine  tryptophan 
depletion results in a temporary decrease in serotonin 
transmission,  and  this  increased  depressive  symptoms 
in  females  significantly  more  than  males.19  Likewise, 
positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  demonstrated 
decreased  serotonin  synthesis  in  females  compared 
with  males  after  tryptophan  was  depleted.20  Elevated 
levels of serotonin, as well as the serotonin metabolite 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid  (5-HIAA),  were  found  in 
women  compared  with  men,21  which  may  be  related 
to  a  greater  availability  of  the  serotonin  transporter 
in  females.22  The  serotonin  5-HT1A  receptor  subtype 
demonstrates  decreased  binding  potential  with  age  in 
men but not in women, and this receptor subtype is as-
sociated with depression pathogenesis.23 Brain levels of 
serotonin and norepinephrine show greater age-related 
changes in females than in males.24 A study of 75 healthy 
volunteers  of  different  ages  (21  to  80)  and  sexes  (40 
females,  35  males)  found  platelet  monoamine  oxidase 
manifested a significant increase in females compared 
with  males  (P<0.05).25  The  dopaminergic  system  may 

also be involved in depression pathology. Through neu-
roimaging studies, women have been shown to possess a 
higher concentration of synaptic dopamine in the stria-
tum than men do, and age decreases synaptic dopamine 
levels in men more than women.26 Additionally, female 
hormones seem to increase the turnover rate of presyn-
aptic dopamine in preclinical investigations.27,28 Women 
show  a  greater  reduction  in  striatal  dopamine  release 
in response to amphetamines than men.29 Thus, across 
monoaminergic systems implicated in the pathogenesis 
of  depression  (serotonin,  dopamine,  and  norepineph-
rine),  there  is  suggestive  evidence  both  in  preclinical 
and clinical studies in support of a pathophysiological 
basis  for  differential  presentation  and  response  based 
upon sex.

Sex differences in response to 
antidepressants

There is still no clear consensus on whether there are sex-
related efficacy differences in antidepressant treatment, 
despite  decades  of  research  on  this  topic.  Part  of  this 
lack of consensus is related to the diverse diagnostic and 
trial methodology that has been employed across stud-
ies,  introducing  significant  confounds  in  interpretation. 
Studies have shown sex differences in antidepressant ef-
ficacy  while  attempting  to  accommodate  differences  in 
medication, dose, regimen, and compliance (see Table I 
for a list of factors that may contribute to sex differences 
in  antidepressant  efficacy).  See  Table  II30-38 for  a  list  of 
studies where females respond better to antidepressants 
than males and Table III10,31,39-41 for a list of studies where

males  respond  better  to  antidepressants  than  females. 
A  significantly  greater  therapeutic  response  has  been 
shown  for  males  than  females  for  the  tricyclic  antide-
pressant  (TCA)  imipramine.10,31,40,41  These  differences 
existed  even  when  possible  differences  in  antidepres-
sant type and use patterns, including compliance, were 
considered. 
  A  number  of  studies  suggest  women  may  respond 
better  to  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SS-
RIs) than men,30,31,34,35,37,38,42 although the results of one 

of  these  studies  has  been  disputed.43  The  greater  ef-
ficacy  results  for  females  than  males  (studies  cited  in 
Table  II30-38)  remain  variable.  For  example,  examining 
several of the more recent studies, which employed the 
HAM-D  (Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale)  as  the 
primary  efficacy  assessment  for  SSRI  treatment,  fe-
males had a 15%, 23%, and 40% greater improvement 
than males.31,34,35 Younger females exposed to the SSRI 
fluvoxamine  showed  greater  response  than  males  and 
older females as well (>44 years old).36 In a naturalistic

study of 138 depressed patients, Vermeiden et al report-
ed a differential sex response based on the antidepres-
sant used; males responded significantly better to imip-
ramine  than  premenopausal  females,  but  the  females 
responded  better  to  fluvoxamine  than  the  males.44 An 
atypical  depression  study  produced  mixed  findings: 
whereas monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) dem-
onstrated superiority over TCAs in females, the oppo-
site was true in males.45
  On the other hand, many studies have not detected 
sex  differences  in  the  efficacy  of  antidepressants  (see 
Table  IV33,42,46-55).  The  serotonin-norepinephrine  reup-
take  inhibitor  (SNRI)  venlafaxine  and  SSRIs  were 
both shown to produce comparable responses in males 
and  females.47  Likewise, TCAs,  MAOIs,  and  the  SSRI 
fluoxetine showed no sex differences in drug efficacy in 
a large, retrospective study.33 Other studies have shown 
females  do  not  respond  preferentially  to  SSRIs,51  nor 
do  males  respond  preferentially  to  TCAs.49  Further-
more, Hildebrandt et al showed no sex effect on the ef-
ficacy of the TCA clomipramine, the SSRIs citalopram 
and paroxetine, and the MAOI moclobemide.48
  Meta-analyses  perform  a  service  by  aggregating 
clinical  trial  data  into  an  analysis  that  may  help  re-
solve  inconsistent  conclusions.  A  meta-analysis  of  30 
randomized  placebo-controlled  trials  of  imipramine 
or  amitriptyline  as  an  example  found  no  effect  of  sex 

on  TCA  efficacy.50  A  more  compelling  comprehen-
sive  analysis  using  contemporaneous  techniques  cre-
ated  an  “individual  patient  data”  meta-analysis  with 
the primary data of 1766 patients from 14 eligible ran-
domized  trials,  comparing  cognitive  behavior  therapy 
(CBT)  with  pharmacotherapy,  and  comparing  either 
CBT or pharmacotherapy with pill placebo. This study 
is additionally noteworthy in that pharmacotherapy, as 
well  as  other  recognized  therapeutic  modalities  such 
as CBT, were examined. No sex-modulating effects on 
treatment  were  detected  regardless  of  therapeutic  in-
tervention.55 A 2010 analysis by Kornstein et al pooled 
nine clinical trials of outpatients aged 18 years or older 
with major depressive disorder (MDD; 1108 males and 
1805 females) who received desvenlafaxine or placebo 
for 8 weeks. They found that desvenlafaxine generally 
improved  depressive  symptoms  regardless  of  sex.53  In 
2014, Kornstein et al performed a secondary analysis of 
a multiphase, multicenter, double-blind study in which 
adult outpatients (670 females and 377 males) with re-
current MDD were randomly assigned to 10 weeks of 
acute phase venlafaxine extended release or fluoxetine. 
They found no observed sex difference in the response 
to treatment.54
  Although  no  definite  explanation  exists  for  the 
many  contradictions  in  this  data,  numerous  issues  of 
methodology might offer a rationale. Such differences

t-test  to  compare  total  HAM-D17  (17-item  HAM-D) 
baseline scores with scores after treatment,32 equating 
differences  on  this  parameter  as  potentially  clinically 
important  provided  they  were  statistically  significant. 
Another study declared a clinically significant response 
after  a  50%  or  greater  decrease  in  HAM-D21  (21-
item HAM-D) scores.47 Age variation between female 
patients  in  these  studies  may  also  influence  their  out-
comes,  as  levels  of  female  sex  hormones  change  with 
age and menopause and may affect the efficacy and me-
tabolism  of  antidepressants.  More  potential  variables 
include clinical presentation (ie, typical versus atypical), 
previous antidepressant treatment, differing drugs and 
dosages, patient adherence to treatment plans, and the 
type of study conducted (prospective or meta-analysis 
of large data pools).

Side effects of antidepressants can also detract from 
overall efficacy, particularly if they lead to early discon-
tinuation. Most of the literature reviewed above regard-
ing sex differences in antidepressant efficacy fail to take 
adverse events into account. Deleterious effects on sex-
ual drive and satisfaction, but sometimes improvement, 
have been reported in women taking SSRIs, and weight 
gain  may  be  more  problematic  in  women  because  of 
societal expectations, but further research needs to be 
done in this area to determine whether true sex differ-
ences  exist.56  One  study  found  depressed  females  to 
have greater sexual dysfunction than depressed males, 
yet  female  sexual  dysfunction  actually  improved  with 
SSRI treatment, whereas male sexual dysfunction wors-
ened  with  the  same  treatment.57 The  improvement  in 
sexual function for females may be due to the fact that 
any negative sexual side effects of SSRIs in women are 
overshadowed by the drug’s positive effects on amelio-
rating depressive symptoms. As various antidepressants 
have different adverse event profiles, the clinician can 
switch to another class of antidepressant if such side ef-
fects prove problematic.58 For example, Shen and Hsu 
recommended  bupropion  as  an  appropriate  substitu-
tion for SSRIs in patients looking to reduce sexual side 
effects caused by their antidepressant regimen.59
  A clinician must also keep in mind that many atypi-
cal  antipsychotic  drugs  are  used  today  as  adjunctive 
treatment  for  depression  and  can  even  be  employed 
as stand-alone treatment,60 in which case the potential 
for sex differences in either pharmacokinetics or phar-
macodynamics  must  also  be  considered.  In  the  use  of 
atypical antipsychotics for psychotic disorders, sex dif-

ferences in efficacy have generally not been found, al-
though  this  is  an  area  that  deserves  further  study.61,62 
Most  of  the  literature  regarding  sex  differences  with 
antipsychotics relates to side effects experienced during 
treatment. There is general agreement in the literature 
on women’s increased susceptibility to weight gain, dia-
betes, metabolic syndrome, and specific cardiovascular 
risks  of  antipsychotics  compared  with  men.63,64 Atypi-
cal  antipsychotics  can  raise  prolactin  levels,  resulting 
in  more  pronounced  symptoms  in  women  than  men, 
including galactorrhea, atrophic changes in the urethra 
and  vaginal  mucosa,  reduced  vaginal  lubrication,  dys-
pareunia,  decreased  libido,  ovarian  dysfunction,  infer-
tility, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea.65 Not all atypi-
cal antipsychotics produce the same prolactin-elevating 
effects. For example, in a study by Wu et al, ziprasidone 
was associated with greater changes in prolactin levels 
in  women  than  olanzapine.66  Hyperprolactinemia  ap-
pears  to  be  more  common  with  conventional  antipsy-
chotics and risperidone than with clozapine, olanzapine, 
and quetiapine.67 In a study by Findling et al of risperi-
done use in children and adolescents aged 5 to 15 years 
old,  serum  prolactin  levels  rose  in  the  first  months  of 
treatment before decreasing by week 13. In females, el-
evated  prolactin  levels  were  associated  with  galactor-
rhea,  menstrual  disturbances,  and  decreases  in  bone 
marrow  density.68  Amisulpride,  an  atypical  antipsy-
chotic that has been used to treat dysthymia, appears to 
elevate plasma prolactin to a greater degree than other 
atypicals, which can lead to galactorrhea, gynecomastia, 
and sexual dysfunction.69

Pharmacokinetic differences

Different pharmacokinetic profiles exist between men 
and women for several antidepressants. Possible sources 
of these differences include differences in body weight, 
volume  of  plasma,  gastric  emptying  and  acid  produc-
tion,  splanchnic  blood  flow,  plasma  protein  levels,  en-
zyme  activity,  as  well  as  drug  transport  and  clearance 
rate differences between sexes. Higher plasma levels39,70 
and  lower  clearance  of TCAs  have  been  found  in  fe-
males.71  The  higher  percentage  of  adipose  tissue  and 
body fat in women than in men may be a source of these 
differences.  Due  to  their  lipophilic  nature,  antidepres-
sants have an affinity for adipose tissue, often produc-
ing greater drug distribution in women.72,73 Women also 
typically  have  lower  gastric  acid  secretion  and  slower

stomach  emptying  than  men.  Gastric  motility  is  often 
slowed  in  the  presence  of  female  sex  hormones,  de-
creasing the clearance of antidepressants.37,74
  The complexity of determining sex effects is further 
highlighted  by  similar  studies  of  the  same  antidepres-
sant  that  utilized  different  study  methodology.  Unter-
ecker  et  al  examined  a  large  therapeutic  drug–moni-
toring  database  to  determine  the  influence  of  sex  on 
serum  levels  of  venlafaxine  and  its  metabolite  O-des-
methylvenlafaxine in patients treated with venlafaxine 
under  naturalistic  conditions. They  found  that  women 
had  about  30%  higher  dose-corrected  serum  levels  of 
venlafaxine  and  O-desmethylvenlafaxine  than  men 
(P<0.01).75  Despite  this  finding,  the  clinical  report  by 
Kornstein et al found no sex difference between males 
and females treated with venlafaxine.54 Another cross-
sectional  study  of  a  large  therapeutic  drug–monitor-
ing  database  looked  at  sex  differences  in  venlafaxine 
treatment given to elderly patients versus their younger 
counterparts,  and  found  that  the  difference  between 
age groups was independent of sex.76 
  Another  factor  to  bear  in  mind  is  that  antidepres-
sants are noted to cause weight gain, which is variable 
between  men  and  women.  This  is  important  because 
changing the weight gain and distribution of fat can af-
fect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  antidepressant  drugs 
being  administered.  Noordam  et  al  examined  the  as-
sociation  between  antidepressant  use  and  change  in 
body  mass  index  from  the  pharmacy  records  of  7269 
participants and found weight gain was observed only 
in women (not men) who had been treated for at least 
90 days with SSRIs.77
  The 
cytochrome  P450 
superfamily 
(CYP450) is a major drug-metabolizing pathway in hu-
mans.  Several  CYP450  variants  show  sex  differences 
that may affect exposure and pharmacokinetic profiles 
for antidepressants. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
is a highly expressed liver enzyme that helps metabolize 
many drugs, including several SSRIs (sertraline, citalo-
pram, fluoxetine, escitalopram, etc) and TCAs (amitrip-
tyline, imipramine, clomipramine, etc). Drug substrates 
of CYP3A4 often clear faster in women than in men,78 
potentially  caused  by  increased  CYP3A4  enzymatic 
activity  in  females  compared  with  males.79,80  Contrary 
to  this,  drug  substrates  of  cytochrome  P450  2D6  (CY-
P2D6),  a  major  metabolizer  of  xenobiotics,  including 
desipramine  and  mirtazapine,81,82  often  clear  faster  in 
males  than  females.83  Likewise,  cytochrome  P450  1A2 

enzyme 

(CYP1A2)  substrates  have  been  found  to  clear  faster 
in  males  than  females,84-86  although  this  has  been  dis-
puted.87  CYP1A2  may  metabolize  escitalopram  to 
S-desmethylcitalopram and S-didesmethylcitalopram.88 
Also, a study found that race/ethnic differences in cyto-
chrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) genotype and phenotype 
were observed only in women.89 CYP2B6 is important 
for the metabolism of bupropion to its active metabo-
lite hydroxybupropion. 
  The  task  of  deconstructing  how  sex-based  differ-
ences in metabolic enzymes affect the breakdown and 
distribution  of  antidepressants  is  confounded  by  the 
many classes of antidepressants, each affected by differ-
ent enzymes. A complete picture of this interaction may 
require  knowledge  of  the  class  and  structure  of  each 
antidepressant, as well as the duration and repetition of 
exposure, and even concomitant medications.

Adherence differences

Some studies have also found significant sex differences 
noted  in  adherence  to  antidepressant  treatment.  Ad-
herence is defined as compliance with dosage and regi-
men as prescribed for a duration considered sufficiently 
adequate for therapeutic response. A historical cohort 
study  of  310  994  individuals  who  filled  antidepressant 
prescriptions  during  a  4-year  period  found  adherence 
was  significantly  higher  for  males  aged  20  to  40  years 
than  for  females  of  that  age,  but  this  relationship  re-
versed  later  in  life  for  those  aged  50  to  70  years.90 A 
historic cohort study of three Italian local health units 
of  88  755  patients  with  a  prescription  for  antidepres-
sants  found  that  female  sex  was  a  predictor  of  better 
adherence.91  On  the  other  hand,  a  sample  of  3684  pa-
tients  with  long-term  prescription  of  antidepressants 
found compliance rates across sexes were similar, with 
21.4% compliance for males and 22.4% compliance for 
females.92

Female reproductive hormones

Estrogen is believed to be involved in both the patho-
genesis  of  depression  and  the  effectiveness  of  antide-
pressants.  In  vitro  studies  have  shown  that  estrogen 
facilitates  the  formation  of  dendritic  spines  and  also 
influences  neurotrophic  factors.93  Progesterone  has 
also  been  shown  to  decrease  gastric  emptying,  which 
has  the  potential  to  modify  an  antidepressant’s  phar-

macokinetics.73  Estrogen  interacts  with  the  serotoner-
gic system, which is the target of SSRIs. In a challenge 
study  employing  the  serotonin  agonist  meta-chloro-
phenylpiperazine, cortisol and prolactin responses were 
increased in postmenopausal women who were placed 
on 1 month of estrogen replacement therapy.94 Eighty-
six depressed male and premenopausal females (18 to 
40 years old) were given the SSRI citalopram and the 
SNRI reboxetine in a blinded, 8-week clinical trial. Pre-
menopausal  females  were  shown  to  have  a  better  re-
sponse than males to serotonergic antidepressants, im-
plying that female hormones may improve the efficacy 
of antidepressants.35
  These observations were corroborated by studies in 
depressed  postmenopausal  women  receiving  estrogen 
replacement therapy combined with an SSRI. Depressed 
postmenopausal females on supplemental estrogen plus 
SSRIs demonstrated improved response compared with 
depressed postmenopausal females who received only an 
SSRI.95 An open-label, naturalistic, 6-week study exam-
ined  how  premenopausal  and  postmenopausal  females 
with  depression  respond  to  several  antidepressants,  in-
cluding TCAs, SNRIs, and SSRIs. This study demonstrat-
ed that postmenopausal females had a poorer response 
to  antidepressants  than  premenopausal  females.  This 
inferior  response  was  associated  with  elevated  follicle-
stimulating hormone levels.96
  Naturalistic studies of antidepressants in menopause 
also support the hypothesis that reproductive hormones 
may improve the efficacy of antidepressants. One natu-
ralistic study examined 242 females (95 postmenopaus-
al) and 59 males with depression, who began treatment 
using  an  SSRI  (citalopram,  fluoxetine,  paroxetine,  or 
sertraline)  at  primary  care  centers  during  a  6-month 
period.  Menopause  appeared  to  produce  a  poorer  re-
sponse  to  SSRI  treatment  in  depressed  females.52 An-
other study looked at 115 depressed female outpatients 
(separated  by  menopause  status)  and  86  age-matched 
male outpatients who underwent an 8-week treatment 
taking either the SSRI nefazodone or venlafaxine. Pre-
menopausal females demonstrated a better response to 
SSRI treatment that postmenopausal females.97 
  Harvey  et  al  reasoned  that  acute  worsening  of  de-
pression  would  be  found  more  frequently  in  females 
who were postmenopausal than in both premenopausal 
females and males.98 However, after reviewing HAM-D 
scores in 554 patients over 3582 clinic visits, these inves-
tigators  found  the  opposite  was  true—more  episodes 

of  worsening  depression  occurred  in  premenopausal 
females  and  males  than  in  postmenopausal  females. 
Complicating  matters  further,  a  secondary  analysis  by 
Kornstein et al of a 10-week double-blind study of 670 
female and 377 male outpatients with recurrent MDD 
found no difference between venlafaxine extended re-
lease or fluoxetine on the basis of menopausal status in 
the treatment of major depression.54
  Even estrogen’s mechanism of action in ameliorat-
ing  depression  is  unclear.  For  example,  estrogen  may 
play a role as a mood enhancer, separate from any spe-
cific role in enhancing antidepressant efficacy. Support-
ing  this  notion,  estrogen  given  to  perimenopausal  fe-
males who were not taking antidepressants still proved 
to  be  effective  at  treating  depression.99  In  addition, 
stopping estrogen replacement therapy in females over 
40  years  old  who  had  previous  recurrent  episodes  of 
depression rapidly induced a new depressive episode.100 
In contrast, several studies have found no elevated risk 
for depression in females during their postmenopausal 
period, when reproductive hormones such as estrogen 
decrease  dramatically.101,102  Another  study  found  that 
estrogen alone did not relieve depression in most post-
menopausal females.103
  Low luteinizing hormone (LH) levels may also pre-
dict  improved  response  to  antidepressant  therapy  in 
postmenopausal females.104 Levels of serotonin appear 
to  vary  inversely  with  LH  levels.105  Therefore,  lower 
LH  levels  suggest  higher  baseline  serotonin  levels  for 
antidepressants to work upon. A correlation has been 
shown between lower LH levels and hypothalamic-pi-
tuitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis  hyperactivity.106,107  Normal 
HPA activity has been found to be disrupted in MDD,108 
and  antidepressants  have  been  shown  to  reduce  HPA 
activity. Low LH levels may therefore indicate a hyper-
active HPA axis and identify potentially good respond-
ers to antidepressant treatment.109,110

In  young  females,  the  menstrual  cycle  itself  may 
also modulate the effectiveness of antidepressants. The 
menstrual cycle may alter gastric contractions and fluid 
retention, resulting in a dilution of antidepressant levels 
in plasma.73

Conclusion

Although the evidence is not conclusive, there are two 
observations  that  may  be  made  at  this  time.  First,  a 
number of studies suggest that females respond better 

454

to  serotonergic  antidepressants  than  males.  Secondly, 
postmenopausal  females  appear  to  have  a  diminished 
response to antidepressants compared with younger fe-
males. All the issues reviewed in this paper are thought 
to play a role in producing sex-specific differences in re-
sponse to antidepressant therapy, although the discrete 
role of any one variable is far from clear. In those situa-
tions where differences in response related to sex have 
been suggested, the magnitude of that difference is of 
questionable clinical importance. Published studies on 
the  same  class  of  antidepressants  have  produced  con-
flicting results regarding sex effects. Conflicting results 
may stem from various sources, including study-related 
methodological  differences  and  variance  in  the  mea-
surement of treatment responses.
  Clearer  data  exists  regarding  sex  differences  in  an-
tidepressant  metabolism,  related  to  absorption,  distri-
bution,  and  elimination.  Sex-specific  variance  has  been 
identified  in  numerous  biological  functions  influencing 
pharmacokinetic  determinations,  including  plasma  lev-
els, production of gastric acid, gastric emptying times, lev-

els of plasma protein, enzyme activity, and drug transport 
and clearance rates. However, it is not clear that such dif-
ferences translate into clinical practice guidelines, as our 
earlier example of venlafaxine indicates.
  A better understanding of the interactions between 
these  many  complex  systems  is  probably  required  to 
understand  sex  differences  in  depression  prevalence 
and  treatment  response. At  the  present  time,  no  spe-
cific  guidelines  can  be  offered,  thus  the  clinician  must 
remain vigilant to the possibility of sex effects either on 
the levels of exposure achieved with therapeutic dosing 
or on the clinical efficacy when treating depressed pa-
tients. As is true across many types of pharmacotherapy 
for  psychiatric  disorders,  available  guidance  provides 
only  a  framework  for  the  use  of  antidepressant  phar-
macotherapy  for  the  practicing  clinician  rather  than  a 
codified set of instructions applicable to practice. o
