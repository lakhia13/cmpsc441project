Eating Disorders in Male Athletes

Madison Eichstadt, MD,*† Jessica Luzier, PhD, ABBP,‡§ Daniel Cho, MD, MPH,§||  
and Chantel Weisenmuller, PhD‡§

Context: Eating disorders (EDs) in male athletes are potentially debilitating disorders with significant medical, 
psychological, and athletic performance consequences.

Evidence Acquisition: Searches were performed across PubMed, EBSCOhost, and PSYCinfo from 1990 to 2019. Keywords 
searched were eating disorder, male, athlete, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, muscularity, muscle dysmorphia, and 
sports. Search results included articles written in the English language and encompassed reviews, empirical studies, and 
theoretical articles.

Study Design: Clinical review.

Level of Evidence: Level 3.

Results: EDs among male athletes may lead to serious negative outcomes, including increased susceptibility to injury, 
inconsistent performance, problematic recovery, muscle deficiencies, impairment of optimal athletic functioning, and 
medical, social, and emotional problems. Male athletes with EDs may be more difficult to identify and diagnose for a variety 
of reasons related to differential presentation of symptoms, secretiveness or shame around behaviors, and sex-related 
stigma.

Conclusion: Professionals working closely with athletes are uniquely positioned to identify and screen those who may 
require further evaluation and treatment.

Keywords: athletes; eating disorder; male

In February 2018, Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon disclosed 

his battle with a severe eating disorder (ED) in a New York 
Times interview. Although historically understood as occurring 

in Caucasian female adolescents, recent reports suggest that 
cisgender men may represent up to 25% of people with EDs.2 
EDs are not sex-exclusive and, over time, diagnostic criteria have 
been adapted to better fit male patients.44 Among college-aged 
men, common behaviors include binge eating (7.9%), excessive/
compulsive exercise (4.4%), fasting (4%), self-induced vomiting 
(2.7%), and laxative/diuretic abuse (1.6%).16 A number of factors 
contribute to elevated ED risk among men, including 
psychological factors,20 gender role expectations,53 media 
portrayals of dieting and exercise,53 conflation of muscularity and 
masculinity,2 social media messages increasingly targeting body 
shape, and excessive changes in weight.47

Cisgender male athletes demonstrate a higher risk of 

developing EDs than the general male population.52 In many 
historically male-dominated sports, the perception of the male 
athlete as unbreakable, stoic, and self-sacrificing may be part of 

the sport culture that is reinforced overtly and implicitly. This 
conformity to traditional male gender norms (eg, dominance, 
power, status) predicts greater muscle dissatisfaction and 
increased prevalence of muscularity-oriented ED behaviors.23 
Within this context of gender and athlete identity, ED behaviors 
may be unrecognized as problematic, or even encouraged. 
Seeking help may be deterred due to shame about symptom 
experience, general stigma around mental health treatment for 
athletes,37 internal conflict around masculine gender norms and 
athlete identity, or the stereotyping of EDs as a female 
problem.12,46

The significant physical, psychological, and time investment of 

athletic training and competition may increase vulnerability to 
disordered eating behaviors and EDs. Athletes normally adhere 
to rigid diets and strenuous exercise regimens to optimize 
performance.15,29 In this pursuit, athletes may become 
malnourished enough to enter a state of relative energy 
deficiency in sport or low energy availability (LEA) from 
consuming too few calories relative to expended exercise

output for prolonged periods of time.43 Both states can have 
detrimental effects, including damage to multiple organ systems, 
lower bone mineral density (BMD), reduced testosterone, fragile 
joints and muscles, increased risk of injury, and decreased 
athletic performance.26,27,33,43,57 Comorbid “burnout” or 
overtraining syndrome can further predispose athletes to EDs; 
athletes may turn to disordered behaviors to increase 
performance, which can initiate a vicious cycle of maladaptive 
behavior. For instance, a male athlete pursuing muscularity and 
leanness may diet rigidly, excessively train beyond capacity, and 
even abuse anabolic steroids.35 Furthermore, men are more 
likely to control their weight through excessive exercise, 
especially if they have been overweight in the past.53

Specifically, muscularity-oriented disordered eating may 
include “cheat” meals, substance misuse, and supplement 
abuse.35,42,44,45 Recent reports have identified the lifetime 
prevalence of steroid abuse in male athletes to be 6%,28 with 
some data suggesting steroid abuse rates among sexual minority 
(defined as those identifying as nonheterosexual or reporting 
sexual relations with a member of their own sex) men as high 
as 21%.8 The appropriate screening (for steroids, serum or urine 
testing; ED screening options discussed later) can help delineate 
if one or both are suspected.

ED risk is also a function of sport type.4,11,15,30,52,54 Endurance 
sports (ie, distance running15 and cycling21,49) correlate leanness 
with increased performance.59 Other sports such as gymnastics, 
figure skating, and bodybuilding have an esthetic component to 
the overall score.15,54,59 Athletes competing in weight-based 
sports, such as wrestlers or jockeys,65,66 are actually prohibited 
from competing if they are outside the range of their weight 
class.15 These pressures fuel and normalize practices that many 
consider disordered eating (ie, “bulk and cut”).22,35,48,59 Those 
vulnerable to EDs experience significant distress when deviating 
from strict diet regimens or when dissatisfied with either 
muscular or esthetic results.35,59

These factors—coupled with the higher incidence of EDs 
among athletes—suggest that EDs among male athletes are 
multietiological and at risk of being overlooked (or inadvertently 
reinforced) by teammates and sports health professionals.54

Recommendations FoR scReening 
and assessment

EDs are classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, under “Feeding and Eating 
Disorders”; to meet clinical criteria, the conditions must impair 
physical health or psychosocial functioning.3 Although a 
detailed review of diagnostic criteria is beyond the scope of this 
article, knowledge of the most common EDs can inform sports 
health professionals in supporting overall athlete health (see 
Appendix Table A1, available in the online version of this 
article). Additionally, many EDs are associated with co-occurring 
mental health concerns (mood disorders, anxiety problems, 
obsessive-compulsive disorders, substance use, posttraumatic 
stress disorder,1,64 self-harm, and suicidal behaviors13) that may 

negatively affect the individual’s well-being. Behavioral health 
challenges and suicide are significant risks for people with EDs, 
with rates affecting up to 20% of those with anorexia nervosa5 
and 23% of those with bulimia nervosa.14

Clinicians have recognized the vulnerability for EDs among 
cisgender female athletes. However, ED presentations among 
male athletes differ from those common in female athletes (eg, 
“the female athlete triad”—LEA, menstrual dysfunction, and low 
BMD) and thus are less easily recognized by those working 
with this cohort. Also, minimization of symptoms, 
underutilization of behavioral health intervention, and sex-
related stigma contribute to underreporting and 
underdiagnosing.54 Thus, it is imperative for professionals 
working with male athletes to accurately monitor and screen for 
EDs, as they may present differently. Sports health professionals 
are uniquely positioned to identify, guide, and refer male 
athletes with EDs to treatment.

Risk Factors

Several general and sports-related factors have been identified 
that may increase the risk of a male athlete developing an ED. 
For instance, men with a history of obesity are at greater risk of 
ED behaviors.53 Also, behaviors associated with negative body 
image are a risk factor, including body dissatisfaction,16,18,20 
preoccupation or obsession with specific body areas,18 body 
checking,18 and negative body talk, especially “fat talk.”2,61 
Psychological and personality features such as an anxious 
attachment style,18 low self-esteem,16,17 fear of negative 
evaluation,18 depression,24,40,53 impulsivity,34 and tendency for 
internalizing distress40 increase the propensity for an ED. Early 
sports specialization and competing at an elite level can 
exacerbate these risks.59 This intersectionality may increase 
vulnerability to developing an ED for a male athlete beyond the 
general risk faced by male nonathletes.59

Sport Behavior

It is important to monitor specific behaviors related to sport. 
Mealtime isolation, changes in eating behavior, obsessions, food 
rituals, or excessively rigid eating behaviors can all be indicators 
of an ED. Changes in behavior or mood may be red flags. Deficits 
in physical or psychological performance—especially combined 
with changes in body shape or weight—should be carefully 
monitored. Undernourished athletes often struggle to concentrate 
or experience injuries related to overexercising, which also 
warrant monitoring. Finally, excessive exercise should be assessed 
to ensure the function is not to compensate for eating.

Medical Markers

Several objective measures can also help determine whether 
eating behaviors have become problematic. Routine vital signs 
(eg, low pulse rate), marked unaccounted fluctuations in weight/
body mass index, or hypotension (especially orthostatic) are 
markers of malnourishment.1 Also, physical examination findings 
can be helpful (Table 1). Laboratory measures can offer more 
specific indicators of EDs; for instance, multiple low electrolyte

values are suggestive of an ED (Table 2). These changes in 
electrolytes can have adverse health effects, which include 
osteoporosis, impaired production of insulin, altered metabolism, 
fatigue, and seizures.7,32 Cardiac arrhythmias (which can be fatal) 
are caused by the electrolyte abnormalities associated with self-
induced vomiting, diuretic, or laxative abuse.

In contrast to female athletes, the male athlete triad consists of 
LEA, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and low BMD.10,25,56,58,60 
A recent study assessed the incidence of low BMD in adolescent 
male runners, along with risk factors, including low body 
weight, high weekly mileage, history of prior stress fracture, and 
low daily calcium intake.6 These results provided further 
evidence that sports which equate leanness with improved 
performance also have a higher prevalence of athletes who 
exhibit low BMD and who are at greater risk of developing an 
ED.6 Male athletes with LEA in this sport category have been 
found to have lower levels of testosterone as well; however, 
hypogonadism may not be as evident in male athletes as it is in 
female athletes.56

Screening Tools and Methods

The SCOFF is a common and well-accepted 5-item screening 
instrument that may be used to screen for ED symptoms41 (see 
Appendix Table A2, available online). More than 2 affirmative 
responses indicate the need for further assessment of an ED.41 
Preliminary evidence suggests that the SCOFF questionnaire 
may be more specific and sensitive for identifying men with 
EDs than women with EDs.50 Another helpful tool to evaluate 

for unhealthy exercise behaviors in athletes is the 24-item 
Compulsive Exercise Test.55

While we recommend that all athletes be screened for EDs, 
there is some evidence to suggest that clinical interviews may 
yield more sensitive results for men, as athletes were more likely 
to underreport symptoms on some screening instruments.38 
Clinical studies have also obtained greater endorsement of ED 
symptoms and disordered eating behaviors among adult men 
when self-reporting the signs/symptoms verbally compared with 
women.36 Thus, direct questions about ED symptoms and 
behaviors in clinical interview may yield more accurate self-
disclosure, demonstrating the necessity for personal interviews 
by sports health professionals. For a list of screening questions, 
please see Appendix Table A3 (available online).

Recommendations FoR  
clinical tReatment

Once an athlete has been identified with an ED, it is vital to 
refer him to treatment as quickly as possible. Existing evidence 
about treatment outcome suggests that treatment response is 
similar to that of female athletes.51,63,67 Still, a number of barriers 
are in place for male athletes to access treatment. Stigma 
remains significant and contributes to underreporting and delay 
of care for male athletes with EDs. Sports health professionals 
must assuage the shame many athletes carry about EDs, 
especially relating to masculine gender role conflict.12 This shift 
can help men seek treatment not only for EDs but also for other

behavioral health conditions, such as substance use or 
depression.9

Though a comprehensive description of ED treatment is 

beyond the scope of this article, best practice treatment includes 
an interprofessional team (including registered dieticians and 
psychotherapy professionals), explicit focus on food as 
nourishment, close monitoring and management of all medical 
complications, interrupting all ED behaviors (food rituals, 
limited repertoire of foods, body checking, compensatory 
behaviors), and targeting underlying beliefs and attitudes toward 
weight, shape, and control over eating.39,51,62,63,67 Depending on 
severity, athletes may need care ranging from intensive 
inpatient/residential treatment to outpatient treatment. 
Specialized treatment centers offer tracks for athletes and men 
with EDs.

Athletes with EDs who desire to return to sport should do so 

gradually and under close supervision. They should undergo 
stepwise progression from light physical activity to full sport 
participation (if appropriate).19,31 During this process, if ED 
behaviors return or increase in frequency or severity, the steps 
should be regressed.19,31,32 The decision of when/if an athlete 
can return to play is most commonly made by the sports 
medicine physician; this professional should consider both the 

psychological and the physical effects of the ED in consultation 
with treatment team recommendations.

conclusion

Though prevalence estimates vary across sport and context, EDs 
are likely underrecognized, underreported, and underdiagnosed 
among male athletes. Coaches, certified athletic trainers/staff, 
and sports medicine professionals are encouraged to monitor 
male athletes for signs/symptoms of EDs and refer to formal ED 
assessment and treatment services in a timely manner.
