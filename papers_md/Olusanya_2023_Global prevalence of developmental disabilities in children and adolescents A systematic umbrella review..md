Aim: The provisions of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
for disability-inclusive education have stimulated a growing interest in ascertaining
the prevalence of children with developmental disabilities globally. We aimed to
systematically summarize the prevalence estimates of developmental disabilities in
children and adolescents reported in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Methods: For this umbrella review we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO,
and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews published in English between September
2015 and August 2022. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility,
extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We reported the proportion of the global
prevalence estimates attributed to country income levels for speciﬁc developmental
disabilities. Prevalence estimates for the selected disabilities were compared with
those reported in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019.

Results: Based on our inclusion criteria, 10 systematic reviews reporting prevalence
estimates for attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder,
cerebral palsy, developmental
intellectual disability, epilepsy, hearing loss, vision
loss and developmental dyslexia were selected from 3,456 identiﬁed articles. Global
prevalence estimates were derived from cohorts in high-income countries in all
cases except epilepsy and were calculated from nine to 56 countries. Sensory
impairments were the most prevalent disabilities (approximately 13%) and cerebral
palsy was the least prevalent disability (approximately 0.2–0.3%) based on the
eligible reviews. Pooled estimates for geographical regions were available for vision
loss and developmental dyslexia. All studies had a moderate to high risk of bias.
GBD prevalence estimates were lower for all disabilities except cerebral palsy and
intellectual disability.

Conclusion:
Available estimates from systematic reviews and meta-analyses
do not provide representative evidence on the global and regional prevalence

of developmental disabilities among children and adolescents due to limited
geographical coverage and substantial heterogeneity in methodology across studies.
Population-based data for all regions using other approaches such as reported in the
GBD Study are warranted to inform global health policy and intervention.

epidemiology, early childhood development, inclusive education, SDG 4.2

Introduction

The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are
widely embraced, especially in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs), as the priority global agenda for improving population
health and well-being by 2030 (1). The disability-inclusive provisions
of the SDGs have stimulated a growing interest in children and
adolescents (hereinafter reported as “children”) with developmental
disabilities globally (2, 3). The Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities (CRPD) deﬁnes persons with disabilities to include
“those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory
impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder
their full and eﬀective participation in society on an equal basis
with others” (4). Developmental disabilities are frequently deﬁned
as chronic physical, cognitive, speech or language, psychological, or
self-care conditions that typically originate during childhood before
the age of 22 years; are likely to continue indeﬁnitely; and require
additional coordinated services, support, or other assistance for an
extended duration or during a lifetime; and represent a subset of
conditions that aﬀect children with special health care needs (5, 6).
Right from birth, children with developmental disabilities, especially
in LMICs experience stigma along with negative attitudes and beliefs
that place them at increased risk of neglect, exploitation, and violence,
as well as premature death including infanticide (2). These children
also perform signiﬁcantly poorer than children without disabilities
across virtually all indicators of health and educational wellbeing in
early childhood (2).

Up-to-date prevalence estimates are essential to raise awareness
and inform policy initiatives, service planning, resource allocation,
and research priorities (2). Evidence from global health databases
suggests that about 240 million children globally have developmental
disabilities based on parent-reported functional diﬃculties compared
to 290 million children using statistical modeling techniques (3).
Although systematic reviews and meta-analyses are more suited for
evaluating the eﬀectiveness of health interventions and accuracy of
diagnostic tests from clinical trials (7–9), it is not uncommon to
use pooled prevalence estimates from individual primary studies
as proxies for the global and regional prevalence of children with
developmental disabilities (10–13). However, it is unclear how such
prevalence estimates compare with those reported in global health
databases from the World Health Organization (WHO), United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank or the Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) Study published by the Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), USA. Umbrella reviews
are increasingly being used to summarize evidence from systematic
reviews and meta-analyses, especially for health care interventions
(14, 15). We, therefore, set out to conduct an umbrella review of
systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the prevalence estimates of

developmental disabilities for comparison with estimates from other
sources of population data in global health. The primary goal of this
umbrella review was to provide a narrative synthesis of the selected
reviews due to well-documented diﬀerences in the methodological
approaches to disability measurement (3).

Methods

The protocol for this systematic umbrella review was registered
in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
reference number #CRD42022373552 (https://
(PROSPERO),
www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#searchadvanced). We adopted the
Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR)
statement for conducting umbrella reviews (16). This statement was
considered more up-to-date and better suited for an umbrella review
than the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The term “reviews” in this paper is used
for published articles that are systematic reviews and meta-analyses
of primary studies. The term “primary studies” refers to any original
research or investigation conducted to determine the prevalence of
speciﬁc developmental disabilities in a deﬁned population.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and
Cochrane Library in October 2022 using the terms (“prevalence” OR
“incidence”) AND (“disability” OR “impairment” OR “disorder”),
ﬁltered for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, English Language,
and children under 20 years published between September 2015
(when the SDGs were launched) and August 2022. Eligible
systematic reviews were those that were peer-reviewed with a
clearly stated research question, systematic search of at least two
databases and systematic data synthesis. No supplementary search
for primary studies was conducted (16). The GBD Study from
IHME (https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/) is presently the
only global health database that provides global, regional, and
national prevalence estimates of speciﬁc disabilities among children
and adolescents according to the American Psychiatric Association’s
(APA’s) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) (17), or WHO’s International Classiﬁcation of Diseases
(ICD) codes (18). The selection of speciﬁc disabilities for our
umbrella review was therefore guided by those typically reported
by GBD database to facilitate appropriate comparability (3). These
disabilities include attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
autism spectrum disorder (or simply “autism” hereinafter), cerebral
palsy, developmental intellectual disability, epilepsy, hearing loss

and vision loss. We also included developmental dyslexia because
of its relevance to the disability-inclusive education provision in
the SDGs (1). Developmental dyslexia is a speciﬁc impairment
characterized by severe and persistent problems in the acquisition
of reading skills and it is not typically reported by GBD. Two
independent reviewers/authors (BOO and TS) searched titles and
abstracts for eligibility and evaluated the full texts of the eligible
articles for inclusion. Any unresolved conﬂict was to be referred
to a third reviewer/author (FAO) for adjudication. Reviews that
provided pooled estimates with conﬁdence intervals of the selected
disabilities were included. In general, these reviews assessed the
heterogeneity of the eligible primary studies and performed random
eﬀects meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of a disability.
No distinction was made between reviews that evaluated population-
based primary studies and those based on a random sample
of participants. We excluded reviews that focused on a speciﬁc
population group such as children who are born preterm, those
with diﬀerent birth weights, refugees, children exposed to HIV or
malnourished children. We also excluded reviews that reported a
subset of children with a speciﬁc disability such as children with
refractive errors among those with vision loss as well as reviews
that were published before September 2015, that focused on speciﬁc
countries, one geographical region, or had less than 10 primary
studies as such reviews were unlikely to accurately reﬂect the overall
prevalence of disability among all children and adolescents. In order
to minimize the risk of missing other relevant systematic reviews, a
further manual search of PubMed and selected child health journals
was conducted speciﬁcally for each of the eight selected disabilities.
The reference lists of included reviews were also searched for the
identiﬁcation of additional eligible references.

Data extraction

The citations for the retrieved reviews were ﬁrst migrated to
separate spreadsheets based on the standard ﬁelds in each database. A
combined spreadsheet was then created for the selected articles with
the following ﬁelds: source database, year of publication, authors,
title, journal, abstract and journal link to the full text. From the
full text of the selected articles, the following information were
extracted by two authors (BOO and TS): name of disability, citation,
year of publication, databases searched, number of primary studies,
number of countries covered, proportion of countries from LMICs,
overall study size, age group of the reported prevalence estimate,
global prevalence estimate, prevalence estimate for high-income
countries (HICs), prevalence estimate for LMICs, and remarks. The
composition of HICs and LMICs is based on the 2022 World Bank
classiﬁcation (https://data.worldbank.org/country/XO).

Evaluation of the methodological quality

The risk of bias (quality) of included reviews was assessed
independently by two reviewers (BOO and TS). The Assessment of
Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR2) tool (available at https://
amstar.ca/Amstar-2.php) (19) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)
Critical Appraisal Checklist for umbrella reviews (20) were used
as neither tool covered all relevant sources of bias in reviews on
the prevalence estimates of developmental disabilities. For instance,

AMSTAR2 was speciﬁcally designed for health intervention research
but it is more comprehensive than JBI checklist and accounts for
the quality of the primary studies included in the meta-analysis,
without limiting the quality assessment to the technical aspects of
the meta-analysis itself. The AMSTAR2 questionnaire has 16 criteria
and requires reviewers to respond with a “Yes” or “Partial Yes” or
“No” or “No Meta-analysis” option. Overall quality was classiﬁed
as “critically low,” “low,” “moderate,” and “high” (17). JBI consists
of 10 criteria scored as being “met” (1), “not met” (0), or “unclear”
(UC), resulting in an overall quality score of 0 to 10. The scores
were categorized as low (0–4), medium (5–7), and high-quality (8–
10) reviews. Disagreements on risk of bias ratings were resolved
through discussion.

Global Burden of Disease estimates

The latest GBD estimates of developmental disabilities in children
and adolescents in 2019 were obtained from two publications
(3, 21), which were extracted from the substantive GBD 2019
Database (https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/) and the GBD-
WHO Rehabilitation Database or “WHO Rehabilitation Need
Estimator” (https://vizhub.healthdata.org/rehabilitation/). These are
the only sources of global and regional prevalence estimates
of speciﬁc developmental disabilities covering 204 countries and
including the 193 UN Member States. The GBD
territories,
methodology has been extensively reported (3, 21, 22). In summary,
the prevalence estimation for each condition begins with the
compilation of all available data inputs from systematic reviews
of the literature, hospital and claims databases, health surveys,
case notiﬁcation systems, cohort studies, and multinational survey
data. A comprehensive list of the sources of input data for each
condition is publicly available at the Global Health Data Exchange
(https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019/data-input-sources). In the
data preparation, eﬀorts were made to (i) optimize the comparability
of data derived from various sources using diﬀerent methods;
(ii) ﬁnd a consistent set of estimates across prevalence data; and
(iii) generate estimates for locations with sparse or no data by
using available information from other locations combined with
covariates. Prevalence estimates are then generated using DisMod-
MR 2.1, a statistical modeling technique developed speciﬁcally for
the GBD project. This is a Bayesian meta-regression tool that
synthesizes epidemiological data for fatal and non-fatal health
outcomes from disparate settings and sources, adjusting for diﬀerent
case deﬁnitions/diagnostic criteria or sampling methods, to generate
internally consistent estimates by geographical location, year, age
group, and sex. The GBD database contains estimates from 1990 to
2019 and are accompanied by the corresponding 95% uncertainty
bounds intervals (UI). Prevalence estimates are available for seven
of the eight selected disabilities. Developmental dyslexia is presently
not included in the GBD databases. We did a narrative synthesis
of included studies in comparison to the GBD (2019) study and
compared prevalence estimates for the eight selected disabilities.

Results

The initial search of the ﬁve bibliographic databases yielded 3453
articles composed as follows: Scopus (n = 1,788), PubMed (n = 681),
EMBASE (n = 755), PsycINFO (n = 87) and Cochrane Library (n =

142). Three articles were identiﬁed from outside the databases giving
a total of 3,456 articles (Figure 1). A total of 54 articles were selected
for full-text review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After
the review of the full-texts, 44 articles were excluded and the reasons
for their exclusion are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The
most common reason for exclusion was the absence of global and
regional prevalence estimates for children and adolescents. Of the 10
articles selected for inclusion that reported pooled global prevalence
estimates of disabilities (10–12, 23–29), three articles focused on
ASD and the remaining seven articles were each focused on one
disability. A summary of the selected reviews is presented in Table 1.
The primary studies covered by the selected systematic reviews and
meta-analyses ranged from 14 to 88 articles and the vast majority
were from HICs. The reported age groups varied across most reviews
except for cerebral palsy, hearing loss and vision loss. Prevalence
estimates of developmental disabilities in LMICs were only reported
for ASD, cerebral palsy, and developmental dyslexia. Prevalence
estimates for the WHO or World Bank world regions were reported
for developmental dyslexia and vision loss. Since the prevalence
estimates from most of the systematic reviews were derived from
primary studies conducted in HICs, the GBD global estimates
were reported along with the estimates for HICs as prevalence
estimates for LMICs as a group are not reported separately by GBD
(Figure 2).

Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder

Barican et al. reported a pooled prevalence of 3.7% (95% CI:
2.3–5.7) in children aged 4–18 years from 14 primary studies in 11
countries (23). The primary studies covered the period January 1990
to February 2021, and speciﬁcally excluded studies from LMICs. The
GBD estimated the prevalence of ADHD among children 0–19 years
as 1.9% (95% UI: 1.3–2.6) in 2019 (Table 1). The GBD prevalence
estimate of ADHD for HICs is approximately 3.0% (95% UI: 2.0–4.2),
suggesting a far lower estimate for LMICs (Figure 2).

Autism spectrum disorder

Three reviews all published in 2022 reported prevalence estimates
of ASD DHD that ranged from 0.6% (95% CI: 0.4–1.0) to a median
of 1.0% (Interquartile range: 1.1–4.4) (11, 24, 25). One study by
Barican et al. reported estimates for ADHD and ASD, but the
estimate for ASD was not considered as it was derived from only four
primary studies (23). None of the reviews provided pooled estimates
speciﬁcally for children and adolescents. The primary studies covered
ranged from 51 to 71 articles derived from 25 to 41 countries, less
than half of which were LMICs in all three reviews. One of the reviews
by Wang et al. aimed to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal

symptoms in individuals with ASD and reported pooled estimates of
ASD for HICs (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.8–1.2) and LMICs (1.6%, 95% CI:
1.1–2.0) (25). Four of the 51 primary studies in this review involved
individuals older 20 years or older and the selected studies were
published between 2001 and 2022. Regional estimates were reported
for Africa (3.0%, 95% CI: 2.5–3.4), Oceania (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.6–3.8),
the Americas (1.3%, 95% CI: 1.1–1.6), Asia (0.3%, 95% CI: 0.3–0.4)

ASD was 0.4% (95% UI: 0.3–0.5) with a higher prevalence of 0.7%
(95% UI: 0.6–0.8) estimated for HICs (Figure 2), suggesting a lower
prevalence for LMICs compared to HICs.

Cerebral palsy

The included systematic review by McIntyre et al. reported
prevalence estimates for HICs and LMICs separately (10). A
total of 41 primary studies were included in the review derived
predominantly from surveillance registries in 27 countries, six of
which were LMICs. The review covered studies published between
January 2011 and November 2020 and the sample included children
with birth year of 1995 and beyond. The estimated birth prevalence
of cerebral palsy was approximately 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1–0.2) for
HICs and 0.3% (95% CI: 0.3–0.4) for LMICs among children 0–18
years. A pooled global estimate was not reported nor estimates by
geographical world regions. The meta-analysis was based on children

with birth year from 2010. The GBD estimate for cerebral palsy was
0.9% (95% UI: 0.8–2.0) globally based on children with moderate to
severe motor impairment (21). The prevalence estimate for HICs was
0.6% (95% UI: 0.5–0.6) which would suggest a higher prevalence for
LMICs than the reported global estimate.

Developmental intellectual disability

Only one systematic review by McKenzie et al. published in
2016 was identiﬁed for this study (26). The review included primary
studies published between 2010 to 2015 and no meta-analysis was
conducted. There were 18 primary studies covering all age groups
from 9 countries, and all but 2 countries were HICs. Prevalence was
highly variable across studies and ranged from 0.22 % in 2007–2008
(USA) to 1.55 % in 1996 (USA) among children and adolescents. The
GBD global estimate was 3.1% (95% UI: 2.3–3.8) and the estimate for
HICs was 1.5% (95% UI: 1.2–1.8), suggesting a signiﬁcantly higher
prevalence for LMICs than the global estimate (Figure 2).

Epilepsy

One systematic review by Fiest et al. published in 2017 was
eligible for inclusion (27). The review covered the period from
1985 to October 2013 and included 63 primary studies in all age
groups (0–60+ years) from 42 countries, only 8 of which were HICs.

Prevalence estimate was reported separately for children aged 0–9
years (0.5%, 95% CI: 0.4–0.8) and children/adolescents aged 10–19
years (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.7–1.2). Overall pooled estimates for all age
groups were reported separately for HICs and LMICs but not for
children and adolescents. The GBD global estimate was 0.7% (95%
UI: 0.6–0.9) and the estimate for HICs was 0.6% (95% UI: 0.5–0.8),
suggesting a signiﬁcantly higher prevalence for LMICs than the global
estimate (Figure 2).

Hearing loss

The systematic review by Wang et al. published in 2019 was the
only eligible study (28). The review was speciﬁcally conducted for
children aged 0–18 years and included 88 articles published between
January 1996 and August 2017 from 39 countries, 23 (or roughly
60%) of which were LMICs. The review computed pooled estimates at
diﬀerent hearing threshold levels, and the prevalence decreased as the
severity of hearing loss (the threshold cutoﬀ) increased. Prevalence
estimates ranged widely from as low as 0.1% (95% CI, 0.1–0.2) when
hearing loss was deﬁned using a lower frequency average (0.5, 1,
and 2 kHz) with a hearing threshold/level of 40 decibel (40-dBHL)
in both ears to as high as 17.9% (95% CI: 15.9–20.0) when using
a full frequency average (0.5 to 8 kHz) with a 15 dBHL threshold
in 1 or both ears. Two global prevalence estimates using the most
reported thresholds for hearing loss were presented: 13.1% (95% CI:
10.0–17.0) based on >15 dBHL and 8.1% (95% CI: 1.3–19.8) based
on >20 dBHL. As recommended by the WHO, the GBD uses 20
dBHL threshold for all its computations. The global prevalence was
estimated as 4.0% (95% UI: 3.5–4.5) while the estimate for HICs
was 1.9% (95% UI: 1.6–2.1), which suggests a higher prevalence for
LMICs than the global estimate (Figure 2).

Vision loss

One systematic review by Yekta et al. published in 2022 met
our inclusion criteria (12). The review included 80 studies published
between 1971 and 2018 from 28 countries, 19 of which are LMICs. It
is the only systematic review that was speciﬁcally conducted among
children and adolescents below 20 years. It was also the only review
that reported estimates for all WHO regions. The global prevalence of
vision loss was 12.7% (95% CI: 9.3–16.2) based on uncorrected visual
acuity (UCVA) of 20/40 or worse in the better eye, and 7.3% (95% CI:
4.3–10.2%) based on UCVA of 20/60 or worse in the better eye. The
GBD global prevalence was estimated as 1.3% (95% UI: 1.1–1.5) using
visual acuity of less than 6/18 according to the Snellen chart, while the
estimate for HICs was 1.3% (95% UI: 1.1–1.5) (Figure 2).

Developmental dyslexia

One systematic review by Yang et al. published in 2022 provided
the most comprehensive and up-to-date status of children with
developmental dyslexia globally (29). The review covered 58 primary
studies published as far back as the 1950s until June 2021 and
involved school children aged 6–13 years. A total of 58 studies
were selected for the review drawn from 16 countries, 6 of which
were LMICs. The pooled global prevalence was 7.1% (95% CI:

6.3–8.0%). The prevalence estimates for HICs (7.1%, 95% CI:
5.5–8.8%) and middle-income countries (7.1%, 95% CI: 6.1–8.2%)
were similar. Pooled estimates based on WHO regions were also
reported. However, developmental dyslexia is not included in the
GBD database.

summarized in
Supplementary Tables S2, S3. The inter-rater reliability after the
ﬁrst round of independent evaluation was 94.8% for the AMSTAR2
and 98.3% for JBI Checklist. Diﬀerences were resolved by consensus.
For example, the AMSTAR2 required authors to provide a list of
excluded reviews and justify the exclusions. This accounted for
most of the discrepancies between the two raters. It was therefore
agreed that reviews that reported the excluded primary studies in the
PRISMA ﬂow diagram with explanations for the exclusion should be
considered as satisfying this criterion. Based on AMSTAR2, none of
the reviews met the criteria for high quality and the most were either
of low or critically low quality. In contrast, based on JBI checklist,
none of the reviews were of low quality. In fact, 9 of the reviews were
of high quality and 3 of medium quality.

Discussion

We set out to provide an overview of the pooled prevalence
estimates of commonly reported disabilities
in children and
adolescents derived from systematic reviews and meta-analyses,
published approximately midway into the SDGs and to compare the
ﬁndings with estimates from alternative data sources in global health.
To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic umbrella review
on the global prevalence of the selected disabilities in children and
adolescents. The principal ﬁnding was that sensory impairments were
the most prevalent disabilities (13.1% for hearing loss and 12.7%
for vision loss) while cerebral palsy was the least prevalent disability
(approximately 0.2%) globally.

Another important ﬁnding was that most of the global prevalence
estimates were derived from primary studies conducted in HICs and
estimates for LMICs were reported for only three disabilities: autism
spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, and developmental dyslexia. The
highest number of countries providing primary data for any disability
was 56, which is 29% of all UN Member States that signed
the SDGs. Regional prevalence estimates were only available for
autism spectrum disorder, vision loss and developmental dyslexia. In
contrast, the GBD estimates were available for high-income countries
which gave indications on the contribution of LMICs to the global
prevalence for the selected disabilities except developmental dyslexia.
For example, the contributions of LMICs to the global prevalence of
hearing loss and intellectual disability were substantially higher than
those from high-income countries, in contrast to ﬁndings on autism
spectrum disorder and ADHD.

Another notable ﬁnding was that the age groups of children
reported in the reviews varied which makes direct comparison of
estimates challenging. Furthermore, the global prevalence estimates
reported for ADHD, autism, epilepsy, hearing loss and vision loss
in systematic reviews were higher than those reported by the GBD.
In contrast, prevalence estimates for cerebral palsy and intellectual

disability from systematic reviews were lower than those reported
by GBD. Based on GBD data, hearing loss was the most prevalent
disability (4.0%) and autism was the least prevalent (0.4%) disability
in children and adolescents. The modeling techniques used by GBD
for each of the disabilities and the number of countries covered
would have accounted for the diﬀerences in the global prevalence
estimates between the GBD and the systematic reviews. However,
the pooled prevalence estimate for cerebral palsy for LMICs of
approximately 0.3% does not appear to reﬂect the well documented
disproportionately high burden of the risk factors for cerebral
palsy and the reported prevalence estimates in young children in
LMICs, especially in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (21, 30, 31).
For example, in one robust population-based study in India, the
prevalence estimate of up to 2.1% for neuromotor impairments
including cerebral palsy was reported (31).

Another major ﬁnding was the sharp contrast in the quality
rating of the included reviews from two diﬀerent assessment tools.
The major reason for the poor quality rating based on AMSTAR2
were that most of the reviews (8 out of 12) did not provide an
explicit statement that the review methods were established prior to
the conduct of the review which constitutes a major risk of bias in
all included reviews (19). In addition, none of the reviews reported
the sources of funding for the primary studies that were selected.
For these and other reasons we concluded that the available reviews
are generally not of a high quality to inform policy interventions in
global health.

These ﬁndings would suggest that prevalence estimates derived
from systematic review and meta-analyses are unlikely to provide
comparable data for diﬀerent disabilities to satisfy the requirements
for policy and investment decisions in global health, especially
in relation to population-level information for service planning.
Prevalence estimates for geographical world regions were not
available for most disabilities. More crucially, it was diﬃcult to
combine the estimates from the various reviews to determine an
overall global estimate of disabilities in children and adolescents due
to marked variability of study designs, methodological approaches,
sampling strategies, and the diagnostic criteria used in case
ascertainment (32). These limitations have accounted for the growing
reliance by policymakers on alternative approaches and sources of
global estimation of population health metrics including household
surveys and statistical modeling (3, 22, 33). In order to address these
limitations, the GBD for example, utilizes sophisticated statistical
techniques to (i) optimize the comparability of data derived from
various sources using diﬀerent methods; (ii) ﬁnd a consistent set
of estimates across prevalence data; and (iii) generate estimates for
locations with sparse or no data by using available information
from other locations combined with covariates (22). However, it
is important to clarify that GBD estimates are equally associated
with several limitations which have been reported extensively in
the literature (3, 21, 22). For example, The GBD methodology
of estimating the prevalence of disabilities based on sequelae of
the underlying health conditions or surrogates may result in over-
estimation or under-estimation due to the diﬃculty in accurately
accounting for idiopathic impairments. Behavioral conditions such
as ASD and ADHD, continue to rely on sparse data in many regions,
particularly LMICs. In addition, The GBD estimates for disabilities
still do not fully reﬂect the complex and dynamic relationship
between health conditions and contextual personal or environmental

factors under the ICF, as such they provide a limited picture of
disability. It is also important to mention that while cerebral palsy
is least prevalent among the selected developmental disabilities, it
is the leading cause of early-onset physical disability. Considering
that cerebral palsy is lifelong and very disabling for some people,
the impact in terms of disability-adjusted life years makes cerebral
palsy a more signiﬁcant condition from a public health perspective
than its low prevalence might suggest (34). The use of live births as
denominator in computing the prevalence, is also unlikely to reﬂect
the extent of the disability in the population optimally.

this study is that

A major strength of

the ﬁndings from
the systematic reviews were compared with the latest prevalence
estimates in the GBD database, which is novel. We had previously
demonstrated that the prevalence estimate of disabilities in children
and adolescents (<20 years) by GBD and UNICEF were not
statistically diﬀerent and were statistically equivalent (3). The study
also complied with the key quality measures recommended by
AMSTAR2, including prior registration with PROSPERO and the
provision of a separate list of excluded reviews and reasons for
exclusion. Another unique feature was the quality evaluation of
the included reviews using two separate risk-of-bias tools. We also
included developmental dyslexia which is the most common type of
learning disability, accounting for approximately 80% of all learning
disabilities but rarely reported in the global health literature (29, 35).
A few limitations of this umbrella review are worth restating.
First, the electronic databases searched were not exhaustive which
would have resulted in a potential selection bias. For example,
we excluded non-English articles, and we did not search Web
of Science, Google Scholar, and regional databases such as the
WHO Library (WHOLIS), LILACS (formerly Latin America Index
Medicus) and African Index Medicus for additional eligible articles
from LMICs, which could have biased the ﬁndings. Second, no
meta-analysis of the reported estimates was undertaken, primarily
due to heterogeneity in the methods, age groups and the sample
sizes of
the included reviews. However, umbrella reviews in
general are aimed at summarizing the evidence rather than to re-
synthesize primary studies (20). Third, there was wide variation
in the period covered by selected reviews which would have
made comparison of reported estimates across disabilities biased
and inconsistent. Fourth, prevalence estimates reported for HICs
frequently mask the health and social inequalities in rural and isolated
areas designated as medical deserts due to inadequate access to
medical care.

Conclusion

Up-to-date prevalence estimates of disabilities in children and
adolescents are essential to raise awareness and inform policy
initiatives, service planning, resource allocation, and research
priorities. However, available estimates from systematic reviews and
meta-analyses do not provide representative evidence on the global
and regional prevalence of developmental disabilities due to limited
geographical coverage and substantial heterogeneity in methodology
across the primary studies. Population-based data for all regions that
reﬂect and adjust for these limitations such as those reported by
GBD Study periodically are warranted to inform global health policy
and intervention.
