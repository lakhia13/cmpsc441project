Abstract: Iron deficiency (ID) and restlessness are associated with sleep/wake-disorders (e.g., restless
legs syndrome (RLS)) and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention deficit/hyperactivity and autism
spectrum disorders (ADHD; ASD)). However, a standardized approach to assessing ID and restless-
ness is missing. We reviewed iron status and family sleep/ID history data collected at a sleep/wake
behavior clinic under a quality improvement/quality assurance project. Restlessness was explored
through patient and parental narratives and a ‘suggested clinical immobilization test’. Of 199 patients,
94% had ID, with 43% having a family history of ID. ADHD (46%) and ASD (45%) were common
conditions, along with chronic insomnia (61%), sleep-disordered breathing (50%), and parasomnias
(22%). In unadjusted analysis, a family history of ID increased the odds (95% CI) of familial RLS
(OR: 5.98, p = 0.0002, [2.35–15.2]), insomnia/DIMS (OR: 3.44, p = 0.0084, [1.37–8.64]), and RLS (OR: 7.00,
p = 0.01, [1.49–32.93]) in patients with ADHD, and of insomnia/DIMS (OR: 4.77, p = 0.0014, [1.82–12.5]),
RLS/PLMS (OR: 5.83, p = 0.009, [1.54–22.1]), RLS (OR: 4.05, p = 0.01, [1.33–12.3]), and familial RLS (OR:
2.82, p = 0.02, [1.17–6.81]) in patients with ASD. ID and restlessness were characteristics of ADHD and
ASD, and a family history of ID increased the risk of sleep/wake-disorders. These findings highlight
the need to integrate comprehensive blood work and family history to capture ID in children and
adolescents with restless behaviors.

1. Introduction

Iron, classified as a trace element, is present in all of the body’s cells and serves as
a component of hemoglobin and myoglobin. Its primary role involves carrying oxygen
in both the bloodstream and muscles [1]. Recently, iron has received increasing attention
due to its role in sleep disorders [2,3], as well as wake behaviors associated with mental
health (MH) and/or neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as attention deficit hy-
peractivity disorder (ADHD) [4,5], autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and prenatal alcohol
exposure/fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (PAE/FASD) [6].

During development, iron plays a substantial role in several central nervous system
processes, including neurogenesis, the differentiation of brain cells, myelination, and
the neurotransmitter metabolism. Perinatal iron deficiency (ID) in animal models may
alter the neurochemical profile of the hippocampus [7], lead to dysfunction in the striatum
accompanied by behavioral changes [8], and have persistent effects on brain myelination [9].
These proposed mechanisms are derived from iron’s modulating role in the brain and
spinal cord [10], leading us to consider central ID rather than focusing exclusively on brain
ID [11,12].

Iron is present as a trace element in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and mi-
croglia, and plays an essential role in the transfer of electrons and the synthesis of neu-
rotransmitters such as dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. These
neurotransmitters are involved in various functions, including emotions, the sleep/wake
cycle, movement, attention, memory, and learning through its cofactor function for pheny-
lalanine hydroxylase [13] and tryptophan hydroxylase [14]. Furthermore, iron serves as
an important cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase which regulates the dopamine synthesis
pathway by converting tyrosine to dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA) [15,16]. Collectively,
these findings suggest that both perinatal and postnatal ID might play a substantial role in
behavioral medicine, including both sleep and wake behaviors.

Non-anemic ID is associated with multiple sleep/wake disorders; however, a stan-
dardized assessment of iron status in the diagnostic work-up for sleep/wake-disorders has
not been established in clinical practice [3]. The most frequent causes of sleep/wake distur-
bances associated with central ID are sleep/wake disorders presenting with hyper-motor
restlessness, hyper-arousability, restless leg syndrome (RLS) [17–20], periodic limb move-
ments in sleep (PLMS) [21,22], and restless sleep disorder (RSD) [23]. RLS is a neurological
sensorimotor disorder which is a frequently unrecognized and/or underestimated cause
of intractable chronic insomnia [24,25]. The characteristic “urge-to-move” can manifest in
several different body parts and is associated with paresthesias, discomfort, or even pain.
As RLS was first described in adults and has been approached from an adult neurology
perspective [26], the natural history of pediatric RLS has not been thoroughly investigated
and pediatric RLS phenotypes have not yet been described. The role of RLS in neurode-
velopmental disorders such as PAE/FASD [27], Down Syndrome [28], or ASD [29] has
been questioned, but not investigated systematically. Diagnoses are made based on adult
sleep medicine and reporting an “urge-to-move”, which presents as restlessness. This is
alleviated by voluntary movements while awake, but results in disturbances in the onset
and maintenance of sleep. PLMS are believed to be a continuum of RLS symptoms during
sleep that impact sleep quality and are characterized by repetitive small movements of the
toes, leading to larger movements involving the ankle and knee [21,22].

RLS, PLMS, and ADHD share hypermotor restlessness and hyper-arousability as
common factors that lead to non-restorative sleep. While RLS may present with ADHD-like
behaviors during the daytime [18,30], ADHD itself has been associated with a variety of
sleep phenotypes [31] and is considered to be a 24 h disorder. RSD is characterized by
frequent body movements of large muscle groups that disrupt both sleep and wakeful-
ness, and was first described in 2018. Characterizing hyper-motor restlessness during
sleep as a new diagnostic entity supports our understanding that disorders presenting
with hypermotor-restlessness and/or hyper-arousability need an in-depth phenotyping
approach from a pediatric sleep medicine perspective [23].

Given the experimental and clinical evidence of the effects of iron on the central
nervous system and sleep/wake behaviors [2,3,12,32–35], we implemented an iron status
assessment as a standard investigation in our clinical setting. Here, we present findings
on iron status in children and adolescents referred to a Sleep/Wake-Behaviour Clinic at a
tertiary care center with a focus on the common neurodevelopmental disorders, ADHD
and ASD.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Patients

Patient data collection was conducted at the Sleep/Wake-Behavior Clinic in the Divi-
sion of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry of BC Children’s Hospital in Vancouver, Canada.
Patients were referred to the clinic by the hospital and/or community-based general prac-
titioners, pediatricians, or psychiatrists. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the
prospectively collected data via structured intake forms (Supplementary Table S1) and
clinical assessments from our clinic over a time period of 18 months (2021 to 2023).

2.2. Inclusion Criteria

(1) Completion of electronic intake forms independently or with the assistance of the
team prior to the clinical assessment. (2) Full clinical assessment (in-person or via telehealth)
that included the suggested clinical immobilization test (SCIT) of the patient and/or
accompanying biological family member (parent and/or sibling; note that applicability
of the formal SCIT depends on the developmental age and capacity of the participating
patient and the applicability of the informal SCIT on age and ability to move; see Figure 1).
(3) Collection of information on the patient’s most recent iron status and parental ID history.
Furthermore, we collected information on demographics, comorbidities and medications.
Exclusion criteria were any hematologic comorbidities such as thalassemia or sickle cell
anemia. Patients included had a mean age of 10.83 years (median: 12 years; min: 3 months;
max: 23 years).

2.3. Iron Deficiency

Iron status was investigated in 199 patients. Non-anemic ID was defined as normal
hemoglobin with serum ferritin < 50 µg/L, as per the RLS guidelines from the Interna-
tional Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group, with negative CRP and no signs of inflam-
mation/infection in the lab (e.g., elevated CRP or WBC/differential) and/or clinically
(e.g., asthma, eczema, acne, or parasites), and/or a fasting iron status with low fasting
serum iron, low iron saturation, and/or high TIBC [19,24,25]. Additional RBC indices were
reviewed as indicators of anemia, including mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cor-
puscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).
Parents with a clear self-reported history of ID were appropriately identified, and in cases
where the evidence was inconclusive but clinical symptoms of restlessness and/or RLS
were evident, parental serum ferritin values were reviewed using electronic records with
the consent of the individual (no additional data collection). ID in adults was defined
as serum ferritin < 75 µg/L with negative CRP and no clinical or laboratory signs of
inflammation/infection [19].

2.4. Clinical Assessment

The screening and assessment methods for an in-depth assessment of disruptive
sleep/wake-behaviors were developed during an interdisciplinary PhD research endeavor
utilizing qualitative methodologies to optimize clinical best practices, as previously de-
scribed [25,36].

For transparency, an overview of the clinical assessment methodology is described
below (Table 1 and Figure 1) [36–38]. A table version of the electronic intake forms is
shown in Supplementary Table S1. The intake process utilizes REDCap, an electronic data
collection tool [39], since 2021. All patients receive an intake form consisting of qualita-

tive open-ended questions regarding observed/experienced sleep situations utilizing the
bedtime, excessive daytime sleepiness, awakenings, routines, snoring or sleep-disordered
breathing, quality of sleep, and non-specific concerns domains [40]. Furthermore, indi-
vidual goals [41] and concerns [36] of the family and, if applicable, of the patient were
collected. Information regarding daytime functioning and medication information was also
collected. For quantitative information, the following questionnaires were used: the Sleep
Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) [42] and the ADHD Rating Scale-IV [43].

play situations as described in Table 1, which is used in children and individuals who cannot
participate in a formal SCIT. Here we explore the balance between movements and resting from an
RLS perspective together with the caregivers based solely on observations (courtesy of kleanthes
Publishers, Dresden [25,37,44]).

Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 16   Table 1. Suggested Clinical Immobilization Test procedure adapted from Ipsiroglu et al. [25,44]. Instructions for Patients and Accompanying Parents. Ask child and accompanying parent/caregiver(s) to: (①) Remove shoes/socks. (②) Stand up, stretch, and shake out. (③–⑤) Sit down on a height-wise-appropriate chair, barefoot, with feet flat on the floor and sup-press any movements for approx. 2 min.  (⑥) Lean back and take three slow, deep breaths. Now try to relax for approx. 2 min. (⑦) Describe any sensations during each step of the pro-cess in any parts of the body. Sensations related to RLS can also occur in the arms or shoulders. When the test is carried out, participants are allowed to move as much as they want. Instructions for Clinician. Observe movement patterns and review the change in the movement patterns with the patient/caregiver: (①) Provide clean sheets of paper or a mat for the floor to avoid the effects of confounding factors such as a cold or dirty floor, etc. (②) Accompany the patient and their caregiver in standing up, stretching, shaking out, etc.; this reduces stress for the child/ado-lescent and improves the atmos-phere. (③–⑤) Observe the sitting position; patients usually sit under tension in order to suppress any movements and they may express which sit-ting positions help them become more relaxed. If this is helpful, continue for the entire 2 min.  (⑥) Ask the child to now take three deep breaths (you can demonstrate that) during the exercise and observe the position of shoulders and com-ment (“still up” or “moving slowly down—is it difficult to relax?”). Usually, during the three breaths, patients begin to explain their sensa-tions. Suggested monitoring time is 2 min.  (⑦) Observe any movement patterns, including twitches and small jerky movements during each step of the pro-cess and explore why they occurred and whether there were any associated sensations. Review both participants simultaneously and make comparisons; this allows them to reduce stress and make this a fun activity. Note: laugh-ing supports relaxation, and during laughing, characteris-tic movements may happen. Observe the compensatory movements of the participants after the test is officially finished; suppressing movements usually ends in pre-senting with compensatory movements. General comments: Create interactions, e.g., explain to the child that this is a game and that you are trying to understand who is able to sit longer without moving or ‘cheating’ (e.g., increasing tension, making slight movements). Observe the child’s ability to relax and/or increase tension. Make a joke to allow the child to relax and see whether there are any involuntary movements that occur during laughing. Usually, you need to repeat the test so that the child is familiar with the procedure. Ask the child and then the accompanying parent/caregiver(s) if they understand the procedure; try to create a collaborative discussion about words or phrases which describe how the child is feeling. Please do not suggest words to the child and remind them that their legs must be relaxed and not tense; you may check this manually by feeling extrem-ities for any tension—do not forget to ask the child for permission before touching them. FORMAL SCIT: Follow instructions as described above and clinician mark down observed movement patterns and record location and described sensations below: ‘Described sensations’: ……… Sensations in toes/feet/legs Has an urge to move, but unable to specify Sensations in fingers/hands/arms Other (Specify): Nutrients 2024, 16, 3064

2.5. Data Analysis

We performed a comprehensive descriptive analysis to examine neurodevelopmental
conditions, mental health diagnoses, sleep disorders, and medication use, stratified by
ID status (ID versus no ID, and ID with versus without family history). Frequency and
percentage are presented for all categorical variables. We then used unadjusted logistic
regression to investigate the association of ID with family history (versus no ID or ID with
no family history) and various sleep/wake disorders among the two main patient cohorts
of ADHD and ASD. Finally, multivariate logistic regression models were constructed for
the main sleep disorder, RLS (RLS only, familial RLS, and probable painful RLS) with ID
(ID with a family history versus ID without family history versus no ID), ADHD, ASD,
and the clinical RLS-associated symptoms of bedtime resistance, restlessness before falling
asleep, and restlessness during sleep, as well as age and sex. Odds ratios (OR) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) and two-sided p-values are reported.

3. Results
3.1. Descriptive Statistics

Out of 250 patients referred to the Sleep/Wake-Behavior clinic between 2021 and 2023,
199/250 (80%) patients met the inclusion criteria. In total, 21 patients were excluded due
to incomplete intake forms and another 30 patients were excluded because they had only
been screened and not fully assessed at the time of analysis.

Based on the lab findings of the 199 included patients, 188 (94%) patients fulfilled the
criteria for anemic or non-anemic ID, whereas 11 (6%) patients did not have biochemical
evidence of ID. In total, 41% of all patients had a family history of ID. A family history of ID
mainly traced back to birth mothers who experienced chronic or intermittent ID since their
teenage years and/or during pregnancy. Fathers less frequently reported experiencing ID,
but if so, patients had more first-degree relatives with ID. We further explored the history
of ID and sleep in the patient’s siblings. Iron deficiency diagnosis for family members was
typically made by their family doctors or pediatricians and was reported by the parent or
caregiver during the screening and/or assessment.

Based on previous clinical assessments, 100 (50%) patients presented with an external-
izing disorder or disorders of disruptive behaviors, with ADHD being the most common
diagnosis (n = 92; 46%). In total, 84 (42%) patients had an internalizing disorder, with anxiety
disorders being the most common (n = 81; 41%). The most common neurodevelopmental pre-
sentations were ASD (n = 89; 45%), neurologic conditions (n = 38, 19%), global developmental
delay/intellectual disability (n = 26; 13%), and genetic conditions (n = 21; 11%).

Based on the clinical assessment at the Sleep/Wake-Behaviour Clinic, 121 (61%) pa-
tients met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (Third Edition) criteria [45] for
chronic insomnia and had problems with falling and/or maintaining sleep.
In total,
32 (16%) patients fulfilled the criteria for circadian rhythm sleep disorder (CRSD); subtypes
were captured, but as our cohort comprised individuals of various ages and changing
sleep patterns, we are not presenting these data. In total, 43 (22%) patients experienced
parasomnias, and 100 (50%) had signs of sleep-disordered breathing. In total, 148 (74%)
patients had RLS, 103 (52%) had a family history of RLS, and 22 (11%) had probable painful
RLS. Among the 22 patients with painful RLS, 9 (41%) had self-injurious behaviors; among
this group, 6 (67%) had a family history of ID and 3 (33%) had no family history of ID.
PLMS/Restless sleep was noted in 60 (30%) patients.

3.2. Subgroup Analysis ADHD

In sub-analyses of only patients with ADHD (n = 92), a family history of ID significantly
increased the odds of having familial RLS (OR: 5.98, p = 0.0002, 95% CI [2.35, 15.20]), insom-
nia/DIMS (OR: 3.44, p = 0.0084, 95% CI [1.37, 8.64]), and RLS (OR: 7.00, p = 0.0014, 95% CI
[1.49, 32.93]). There was also evidence of increased odds of probable painful RLS (OR: 3.48,
p = 0.053, 95% CI [0.99, 12.30]) and SWTD (OR: 4.41, p = 0.079, 95% CI [0.84, 23.17]). The results
of all of the odds ratio analysis are presented in Supplementary Table S5.

3.3. Subgroup Analysis ASD

In sub-analyses of patients with ASD (n = 89), a family history of ID significantly
increased the odds of having insomnia/DIMS (OR: 4.77, p = 0.0014, 95% CI [1.82, 12.48]),
RLS/PLMS/Restlessness (OR: 5.83, p = 0.0094, 95% CI [1.54, 22.07]), RLS (OR: 4.05,
p = 0.013, 95% CI [1.33, 12.33]), and familial RLS (OR: 2.82, p = 0.02, 95% CI [1.17, 6.81]). The
results of all odds ratios analysis are presented in Supplementary Table S5.

3.4. Multivariate Logistic Regression Analyses

Analysis of RLS only: A family history of ID was associated with over six times the odds
of having RLS, compared to patients with no ID (OR: 6.25, p = 0.013, 95% CI [1.46, 26.74]),
while no family history of ID was associated with over twice the odds, though this was not
significant at p < 0.05 (OR: 2.67, p = 0.158, 95% CI [0.68, 10.39]). Patients with ADHD had
about twice the odds of having RLS (OR: 2.12, p = 0.046, 95% CI [1.01, 4.42]) compared to those
with no ADHD; ASD was not associated with RLS. Bedtime resistance and restlessness did
not appear to be associated with RLS, either. See Supplementary Table S2.

Familial RLS analysis: A family history of ID was associated with over four times the
odds of familial RLS compared to patients with no ID (OR: 4.38, p = 0.048, 95% CI [1.01,
18.94]). ADHD was not associated with RLS, but patients with ASD had about 70% higher
odds of familial RLS, although this was not significant at p < 0.05 (OR: 1.71, p = 0.103, 95%
CI [0.90, 3.24]). Bedtime resistance and restlessness did not appear to be associated with
familial RLS. See Supplementary Table S3.

Probable Painful RLS analysis: Patients without ID were excluded from the analysis,
as none of them had probable painful RLS. A family history of ID was associated with over
twice the odds of probable painful RLS compared to patients with no family history of
ID, although this was not significant at p < 0.05 (OR: 2.20, p = 0.113, 95% CI [0.83, 5.82]).
ADHD and ASD were not associated with probable painful RLS, and neither were bedtime
resistance or restlessness. See Supplementary Table S4.

4. Discussion

This QIQA-study identified ID and family history of ID as being significant risk factors
for sleep problems in patients referred to a Sleep/Wake-Behavior Clinic located in the
Division of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry in a tertiary care hospital. As part of the project
that included a structured intake procedure, all patients completed intake forms, had their
iron status checked, and received clinical assessments. Notably, 94% of patients were
diagnosed with either anemic or non-anemic ID. Among these patients, MH/NDDs, such
as ADHD and ASD, along with sleep disorders such as RLS (76%) and insomnia (61%),
were the most prevalent comorbidities. Prior scoping reviews conducted by our team have
revealed associations between ID in children/adolescents and prevalent NDDs and MH
conditions such as ADHD and ASD [3,6]. Upon reviewing the ADHD and ASD subgroups
in our patient data, we identified specific sleep/wake-disorders that were more likely to
occur in children/adolescents with a family history of ID. In the ADHD sub-group, patients
with family history of ID had an increased risk of familial RLS, insomnia/DIMS, RLS,
probable painful RLS, and sleep-wake transition disorder, compared to patients without ID
or with no family history of ID. For patients with ASD, a family history of ID increased the
risk of insomnia/DIMS, RLS/PLMS, RLS, and familial RLS compared to patients without
ID or no family history of ID.

Interestingly, restlessness, a common symptom of sleep/wake disturbances that can
be associated with ID [38], emerged as a strong risk factor across both the overall patient
population in our review as well as the ADHD and ASD subgroups. Despite its high preva-
lence, restlessness is often missed in pediatric patients, likely due to several reasons. Firstly,
pediatric sleep medicine has historically been derived from adult sleep medicine. Typically,

Nutrients 2024, 16, 3064

10 of 16

pediatric patients are not actively involved in the clinical assessments and the symptom of
restlessness is not explored from the child’s or adolescents’ perspective. In adult neurology,
RLS is based on history-taking and the explicit mentioning of uncomfortable sensations.
However, in pediatric sleep medicine, the proactive and structured involvement of pediatric
patients in the assessment of their sleep/wake behaviors is a recent development [18,25,36].
Another reason restlessness is commonly missed is because the primary method of assess-
ment, verbal communication, may pose challenges for pediatric patients who struggle to
articulate their discomfort and pain, e.g., for young, non-verbal patients, and/or patients
with developmental delays and intellectual disabilities [46]. Most importantly, restlessness
is considered to be an intrinsic characteristic of patients with NDDs and MH-conditions
such as ADHD, ASD, and PAE/FASD, and remains largely unexplored [2,4,29,47]. This is
particularly evident in conditions such as RLS, where symptoms may be underrecognized
due to the patients’ inability to express their discomfort accurately, or because they may
not recognize the ‘baseline’ state [25,36]. Considering these factors, we aimed to ensure
that restlessness was not overlooked. By following the recommendation of the Pediatric
International RLS Study Group to conduct structured behavioral observations [18], we
adapted the formal SCIT and applied an informal SCIT in cases where a formal SCIT
was not applicable. The informal SCIT allows the observer and caregiver to review and
explore movement patterns of the affected individual from an RLS perspective (see Table 1,
Figure 1a,b). The methodology of explorative history-taking, combined with the review of
a family history of RLS and ID among the patient’s parents and siblings helped to collect
additional information in a structured manner and may have created a unique perspective
for our patient population.

While the high percentage of pediatric patients diagnosed with RLS might be explained
by exploratory observations, including the non-formal SCIT and investigation of family
history, diagnosing probable painful RLS involves exploring its potential link with self-
injurious behaviors (SIBs) in a high-risk population whose behaviors might be triggered by
pain. Thus, in British Columbia, all pediatric patients referred to the Provincial SIB-Clinic
receive a sleep/wake behavior assessment, and the frequency and intensity of the SIBs are
explored using the explorative questioning criteria as described (Table 3). While SIBs in
children with NDDs have been associated with frustrations in communication [48], which
may lead to learned SIBs, painful RLS in children has not been described yet. Therefore, we
have used the diagnosis of probable painful RLS retrospectively only in patients whose
behavioral patterns and patterns of falling asleep/sleep maintenance and restlessness
started to change after iron treatment. Our attempt to review restlessness by applying the
formal and informal SCIT and conducting a structured iron status revealed an interesting
new perspective. Out of the 22 patients with painful RLS, only 9 had self-injurious behaviors
and 6/9 had a family history of ID, showing that in the subpopulation with self-injurious
behaviors, ID, and particularly a family history of ID, may act as aggravating factors of
self-injurious behaviors. The clinical conclusion is that the link between ID and SIBs should
be further investigated.

The mother of a two-year-old child: “Not being afraid to go to
sleep”.
The mother of a two-year-old: “My son is able to sleep the
amount he is supposed to get at his age which is 12–13 h. In
evenings, he is max getting 6 h on and off”.
An eight-year-old non-verbal girl with ASD and ADHD
diagnosed with painful RLS: “At night, she does not like feeling
sleepy and has to sleep. She then jumps up, down, screams, and
expresses SIB. . . . . .pulls at her pinky of fingers and toes
throughout day (multiple times a day) or rams pinky into
something hard. She pinches self and stomps toes on floor or
rubs feet. She suddenly sits up and pulling at her pinky and
gets up if she can to stomp feet into the ground. She pinches her
mom when mom prevents SIB”. She kicks toes into floor
causing problems walking. SIB can be associated with
screaming when she is very distressed. SIB started age 3 and a
half and started with rubbing feet. Then started jumping and
slamming knees into ground. She pinches mom when mom
prevents SIB. She always starts with crying. At night, she does
not like feeling sleepy and has to sleep. She then jumps up,

Unusual routines

Restlessness before bedtime,
behaviors, e.g., fidgeting at
breakfast vs. dinner table.

Examples in Children and Adolescents

A 15-year-old boy, non-verbal with ASD and ADHD, developed
his own nighttime routine as described by his parents: “. . . will
run up and down the stairs climbing in and out of the bathtub,
turning the water on while fully dressed in his PJs, until he feels
content to finally retreat back to bed and try to settle for the
night. If we try to help him or disrupt his “routines” it only
escalates the behaviours. He doesn’t seem to tire, and will go on
for an hour or more on nights when it’s really bad. Some school
mornings he simply is too tried to attend school and wake up”.
The 14-year-old sister, speaking about her brother: “he runs up
and down the stairs and when I ask him what he is doing, he
says, he prepares himself for bed”.
The mother of a four-year-old boy: “Understand/treating the
source of . . . crying”.

The mother of a three-year-old female: “That we will rely on too
many medications to help us fall asleep, and or stay asleep. And
for myself to combat that drowsiness a few hours later with
coffee, because I have to be up with my other two children”.
The mother of the 15-year-old boy, non-verbal with ASD,
ADHD: “During the night, his brothers have reported he will
sometimes still be awake, humming, walking around, and or
turning water on and off in the bathroom sinks and or flushing
toilets. . .”

Criteria #5 makes quality control of the probable RLS-treatment strategy necessary; if the treatment
with iron supplementation is successful, then RLS as a main diagnosis has to be considered.

5.

The urge to move the
legs and any
accompanying
unpleasant
sensations are
partially or totally
relieved by
movement, such as
walking or
stretching, at least as
long as the activity
continues.

The urge to move the
legs and any
accompanying
unpleasant
sensations during
rest or inactivity only
occur or are worse in
the evening or night
than during the day.

The occurrence of
the above features is
not solely accounted
for as symptoms are
primary to another
medical or a
behavioral condition
(e.g., myalgia,
venous stasis, leg
edema, arthritis, leg
cramps, positional
discomfort, habitual
foot tapping).

5. Limitations and Strengths

(1) Reviewing a subgroup of patients all presenting with NDDs and MH conditions
and not having a control group may have confounded clinical results. (2) Only a subgroup
of patients were medication-naive, and some of the medications (e.g., stimulants or an-
tipsychotics) may affect sensations associated with RLS and/or ADHD. For example, the
negative association between sensory processing dysfunction (SPD) and a family history
of ID in the ADHD subgroup is not explainable without the data of controls and with-
out reviewing the effects of medications on sensory processing. (3) We have reported a
retrospective analysis of data, despite collecting the data prospectively. A limitation in
retrospectively analyzing data is the absence of a structured categorization for certain data
which may have helped strengthen our analysis. For example, we did not distinguish
between anemic and nonanemic ID in our electronic intake forms. Additionally, data
regarding family history of ID, either of their mother or father, was not separated. Lastly,
the relatively small sample sizes and small number of patients without ID reduced the
statistical power in logistic regression analyses and resulted in reduced precision/wide

Nutrients 2024, 16, 3064

13 of 16

confidence intervals. While all of these limitations raise questions about the generalizability
of our results to the broader pediatric population, the high prevalence of ID (94%) and
family history of ID (43%), and the potential link between self-injurious behaviors with
ID serve as the strengths of our study. The mechanisms of ID in this population are likely
multifactorial with inadequate nutrition, inflammation, and malabsorption being potential
contributors. However, as our analysis was limited, we did not capture information on the
possible causes. These aspects contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse about
how ID and non-anemic ID should be explored [49].

6. Conclusions

While in-depth phenotyping of restlessness has been applied for some time in the field
of sleep medicine [20,50], definitions of pediatric restlessness in sleep have been based on
adult criteria and do not fully acknowledge physiological differences present in children.
Therefore, further phenotyping of pediatric restlessness is necessary to identify these signs
and symptoms in a clinical setting. In the context of ADHD, daytime restlessness has been
considered to be a key diagnostic criterion, but nighttime restlessness and restless sleep
are not included in the current DSM-V criteria [51], despite ADHD being a 24 h disorder.
Interestingly, restless sleep was part of the diagnostic criteria for ADHD in the 1980 DSM-III,
but has since been omitted in subsequent revisions [52,53]. The recent polysomnography-
based descriptions for ADHD [31] and RSD [23] sleep phenotypes ask for a more in-depth
investigation of clinical observations and biochemical imbalances, with ID and other factors
affecting iron homeostasis (such as inflammation) becoming a focus of interest. To apply
this concept, we developed an exploratory observation-based approach to RLS [25,36,44,54]
and investigated ID among patients with NDDs and MH conditions. Our results indicate
that ID and a family history of ID are significant risk factors for restless sleep and wake
behaviors in patients with ADHD and ASD. This finding is critical, as ID can often be
effectively treated with iron supplementation, potentially improving sleep in children and
adolescents affected by these conditions.
