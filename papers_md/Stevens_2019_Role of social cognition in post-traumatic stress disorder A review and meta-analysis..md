Role of Social Cognition in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: A 
Review and Meta-Analysis

Abstract

Social functioning is a key component of recovery after a potentially traumatic experience, and the 
buffering role of the social support in trauma resilience and recovery has been very well 
documented. Factors contributing to resilience and recovery are notable because although most 
people will experience a traumatic event during their lifetimes, only 6–10% are diagnosed with 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The relationship between an individual and their social 
environment is determined both by the quality of the social environment itself, and by the 
individual’s perception and understanding of information conveyed by the other people around 
them. However, little research has considered the contribution of these internal social cognitive 
processes to PTSD risk or resilience. The current review draws on the existing literature on social 
cognitive functioning in trauma exposure and PTSD, identifying key questions and themes for 
future research. We utilized a meta-analytic approach to assess the evidence for alterations in 
social cognition in PTSD, finding a consistent large deficit in social cognitive performance in 
PTSD groups relative to trauma-exposed and healthy controls. We then reviewed the literature on 
the interaction of genes and the social environment, supporting the hypothesis that social cognitive 
deficits are a pre-existing risk factor for PTSD. Finally, we reviewed relevant neuroimaging 
findings, which suggest that alterations in social cognition affect the perception of threat cues in 
PTSD. Overall, research on social cognition and PTSD is still emerging, but existing findings 
suggest this is an important and understudied area for the understanding of PTSD.

Introduction

Alterations in social functioning have long been noted in post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), and are involved in the core symptom profile for PTSD diagnosis (avoiding people 
that remind one of the experience, negative beliefs and blaming self/others, feeling distant 
from others; Association, 2013). Social functioning is also likely a key component of 
recovery after a potentially traumatic experience, and the role of the social environment in 
trauma resilience and recovery has been very well documented (Hostinar, Sullivan, & 
Gunnar, 2014; Jennifer S. Stevens, van Rooij, & Jovanovic, 2016). Factors contributing to 
resilience and recovery are notable because although most people will experience a

traumatic event during their lifetimes, only 6–10% are diagnosed with PTSD (Kessler, 
Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995).

For example, among former child soldiers, all with very high levels of violence and trauma 
exposure, those with higher levels of family acceptance and social support after reintegration 
show better psychosocial adjustment (Betancourt et al., 2013). Adults exposed to natural 
disasters have fewer symptoms of PTSD and depression if they experience or perceive 
positive social support (Arnberg, Hultman, Michel, & Lundin, 2012; McGuire et al., 2018). 
Similarly, perceived social support predicted fewer trauma-related symptoms in adults with a 
history of childhood maltreatment (Evans, Steel, & DiLillo, 2013).

The relationship between an individual and her social environment is determined both by the 
quality of the social environment itself, and by the individual’s perception and understanding 
of information conveyed by the other people around her. However, little research has 
considered the contribution of these internal social cognitive processes to PTSD risk or 
resilience.

The current review draws on the existing literature on social cognition in PTSD, identifying 
key questions and themes for future research. We assess the evidence for alterations in social 
cognition in PTSD, and whether such alterations are specific to the processing of social 
information, rather than being attributable to broader deficits in domains such as attention 
and memory. We also consider whether alterations in social cognition affect the perception 
of threat cues in PTSD. Finally, we assess whether PTSD-related differences in social 
cognition should be considered deficits, and the possibility that traumatic stress may have 
facilitating effects on social cognition.

Social cognition has been defined as including the wide variety of processes that link the 
perception of social information with a behavioral response (Adolphs, 2003), including 
perception, attention, decision-making, memory, and emotion. Although there is also a very 
relevant and broad literature on social attachment processes, we focus the current review on 
the perception and processing of social signals. Links between early attachment and social 
cognition in PTSD have been addressed in detail elsewhere (Sharp, Fonagy, & Allen Jon, 
2012).

1.  Social cognition in PTSD and control groups

We conducted a review of the literature on PTSD and social cognition for studies conducted 
up until May 22, 2018. The literature review focused on tasks involving perception, 
attention, or memory for social information. A search of Pubmed using pairing the term 
“PTSD” with the terms “social cognition,” “empathy,” “theory of mind,” “face processing,” 
“biological motion,” “gaze discrimination,” “others intentions” produced 213 individual 
articles. Of these, 16 studies included a comparison of performance between PTSD, trauma-
exposed controls (TC), and/or healthy control (HC) groups on a social cognitive task, as 
summarized in Table 1. Other studies examining social function in PTSD using survey-based 
measures of empathic traits or social functioning more broadly are considered in this review,

but were not included in Table 1 as they did not involve an experimental test of social 
cognition.

Overall, those with PTSD had lower performance compared to controls across a variety of 
different demographic groups and trauma exposure types. For example, military police 
officers with PTSD related to a terrorist attack showed social cognition deficits relative to 
exposed police officers with no PTSD, and healthy controls (Mazza et al., 2012). The 
specific deficits included poorer performance in emotion recognition on a task involving 
labeling others’ emotional states from facial expressions, and in mentalizing on a task 
involving attributing emotional states to a protagonist in situations depicted in short 
vignettes. The PTSD group also reported lower empathy on a self-report of empathic traits. 
Similar findings have been reported in other populations with PTSD. In studies of civilian 
participants with PTSD related to a wide variety of trauma types, several groups reported 
lower performance in comparable mentalizing, emotion recognition, and empathy tasks, 
relative to healthy controls (Janke et al., 2018; Nietlisbach et al., 2010; Parlar et al., 2014). 
Although the pool of studies investigating this domain of cognition in PTSD is relatively 
small, a previous meta-analysis of the existing literature confirmed that deficits in emotion 
recognition and mentalizing have been consistently observed across studies of PTSD (N=6 
studies included, with effect sizes of d = −1.6 and d = −1.1 respectively), and that these 
deficits are unique to PTSD versus other types of anxiety disorders (Plana, Lavoie, Battaglia, 
& Achim, 2014).

To quantify the support for potential differences in social cognition in PTSD versus control 
groups, we conducted a focused meta-analysis of the studies listed in Table 1. Five of these 
studies were excluded from analysis (Bomyea et al., 2017; Nazarov et al., 2015; Nazarov et 
al., 2014; Palgi et al., 2016; Poljac et al., 2011) because they lacked effect size estimates or 
the descriptive statistics needed to calculate an effect size. For the 11 studies included in the 
meta-analysis, Hedge’s g was used for sample-size-weighted estimates of effect size 
assessing group differences between PTSD, TC, and HC groups. For the majority of studies, 
it was possible to quantify performance on social cognition tasks in terms of “accuracy” by 
calculating the M and SD for the proportion of items correctly endorsed. For studies that 
employed an inversely-poled measure (where higher scores reflected greater inaccuracy or 
poorer performance), the native scale was used to calculate Hedge’s g, and the sign was then 
inverted. To avoid overly weighting the findings toward any particular single study, effect 
sizes were pooled within-study when multiple experimental conditions or multiple domains 
of social cognition were reported. Much like Cohen’s d, A Hedge’s g of >0.5 is considered a 
medium effect size, and g of >0.8 is considered a large effect size. Findings are illustrated in 
Figure 1.

Overall, we found support in the literature for consistent deficits in social cognitive tasks in 
PTSD versus both TC and HC groups, with pooled effect sizes in the moderate to large 
range. These findings suggest that deficits in social cognition were not related to trauma 
exposure per se, but rather to the presence of PTSD. In fact, the largest effect size was for 
the comparison of PTSD and trauma-exposed control groups. Furthermore, the meta-
analysis identified a novel finding that was not hypothesized: studies comparing TC and HC 
groups found a small effect in favor of the TC participants. Taken together, the findings are

consistent with a model in which social cognitive deficits are associated with PTSD risk, and 
that social cognitive ability may on the other hand predict resilience to traumatic stress. The 
advantage in social cognition was driven primarily by a large study of adolescents who were 
exposed to a devastating earthquake, in comparison with a matched unexposed control group 
(Fig. 1B), whereas studies of other types of trauma found no notable differences in TC and 
HC groups’ performance.

These findings suggest that further research on the associations between trauma exposure, 
PTSD, and social cognition is warranted. Longitudinal research is needed to test the 
hypothesis that social cognition may contribute to resilience or risk following a trauma. In 
addition, the existing cross-sectional literature is primarily composed of small to medium 
sample sizes with N=30 or less in the PTSD group, which may be underpowered to detect 
reliable between-group differences in social cognitive performance, particularly given the 
heterogeneous symptom structure of PTSD (Galatzer-Levy & Bryant, 2013). The largest 
study to date was not conducted in adults with PTSD, but was a developmental study of 
children and young adults from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (N=9000+), 
among whom trauma load—the number of traumatic events experienced—was associated 
with lower social cognitive performance (Barzilay et al., 2018). This study was well-
powered for sensitivity analyses addressing the extent to which effects of trauma load might 
be explained by co-variates such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status. In fact, the 
association between trauma load and social cognitive task performance was no longer 
significant after accounting for these factors. Furthermore, trauma load was also associated 
with lower performance in the domains of executive function and complex reasoning, both 
of which may influence task performance on computerized neurocognitive batteries and may 
influence performance in the social cognition tasks. This study did not directly address 
whether PTSD diagnosis was associated with different performance in any neurocognitive 
domain, however, the findings suggest that larger sample sizes may be needed in order to 
draw strong conclusions about potential deficits in social cognition related to PTSD. It must 
be noted that several adult PTSD studies did include executive function or intelligence tests, 
and found PTSD-related deficits in empathy or emotion recognition in the absence of 
executive deficits (Nazarov et al., 2014; Nietlisbach et al., 2010), providing promising initial 
evidence that PTSD may have a specific effect on perception and processing of social 
information. Future investigation in a well-powered adult sample with PTSD, including a 
validated battery of neurocognitive tasks across several domains, would be highly valuable 
for moving this literature forward. In addition, studies that separately examine females and 
males, and those that probe social cognitive development and its interaction with trauma 
exposure timing, would be particularly informative.

2.  How might deficits in social cognition contribute to PTSD symptoms?

Several theoretical accounts have been developed to explain how social deficits may be a 
major underlying contributor to PTSD risk. These primarily focus on the recovery period 
after trauma exposure. Any understanding of the risk factors for PTSD must incorporate the 
recovery period, because this disorder begins with a discrete event, in response to which 
almost everyone has high initial symptom levels. The pathology of the disorder rests within 
a failure to recover from the intrusive memories of the trauma, and high levels of fear and

anxiety elicited by trauma reminders. This has been very clearly illustrated in prospective 
longitudinal studies modeling the course of recovery over the first weeks and months after 
trauma, showing heightened PTSD symptoms in all participants in the first weeks. Whereas 
a majority of people show natural recovery by 3–4 months, a subset of 11–17% maintain 
high symptom levels after a year or more (Andersen, Karstoft, Bertelsen, & Madsen, 2014; 
Bryant et al., 2015; Galatzer-Levy et al., 2013; Galatzer‐Levy, Madan, Neylan, Henn‐Haase, 
& Marmar, 2011). The chronic PTSD diagnosis then focuses on the group of individuals 
who do not recover naturally in the first few months.

Theoretical accounts of social contributions to this failure to recover posit that interactions 
between the self and others can change the structure of the trauma memory to influence 
symptoms (Maercker & Horn Andrea, 2012). This model is consistent with the premise of 
exposure-based behavioral therapies for PTSD, an extremely well-validated treatment for 
PTSD that requires the patient to remember aspects of the trauma by describing the event to 
the therapist over repeated occasions, over which the negative emotional impact of the 
memory is reduced or extinguished. Similar phenomena may be recapitulated in daily life, 
such that through supportive conversations with others, the fear responses associated with 
the trauma memory may be reduced. On the other hand, social interactions may also worsen 
symptoms, such as in the case of children whose disclosure of sexual trauma is rejected or 
belittled by their primary caregivers, which has been associated with poor mental health 
outcomes (Roesler, 1994). More recently, Sharp, Fonagy and Allen (2012) incorporated the 
role of early caregiver attachment in promoting resilience or risk for later PTSD. They 
pointed to findings showing that secure early attachment promotes the development of 
mentalizing, the capacity to take the perspective of another person, and that this capacity 
allows individuals to take advantage of supportive elements of their social environment. 
Finally, DePrince and colleagues focused on evidence relating to re-victimization risk 
(DePrince, 2005), positing that chronic trauma exposure produces deficits in social cognition 
that put individuals in dangerous situations, increasing risk for additional trauma.

These theories are all well-supported by the existing literature showing a key role for the 
social environment in PTSD risk and resilience. However, there is as yet only a shallow 
understanding of the effects of traumatic stress on how social stimuli are perceived, 
understood, and remembered, and the specific components of social cognition that might 
contribute to individual differences in PTSD risk or resilience. One possibility is that social 
cognitive deficits may be particularly linked with certain aspects of the PTSD symptom 
profile. Alterations in social functioning have long been noted in PTSD, and are involved in 
the core symptom profile for PTSD diagnosis. Specifically, social function directly 
contributes to symptoms in cluster D – “Negative Cognitions” - of the DSM-5 PTSD 
diagnostic criteria (and cluster C – “Avoidance and Numbing” -- of DSM-IV-TR) including 
avoidance of social reminders of trauma, negative beliefs about others, and feeling distant 
from others. However, social cognitive alterations may contribute indirectly to symptoms in 
other clusters. Examination of relations between social cognitive task performance and 
specific symptom types supports this possibility. Numbing symptoms, in particular, have 
been consistently associated with deficits in social cognition, even in the absence of 
differences between PTSD and control groups. Numbing symptoms (including feeling 
distant from others) were the strongest predictor of deficits in emotion recognition tasks in

military police officers in Iraq (Mazza et al., 2012), and in refugees (Schmidt & Zachariae, 
2009), and of compassion deficits in PTSD related to combat and motor vehicle accidents 
(Palgi et al., 2016). Numbing symptoms often co-occur with dissociative symptoms and 
childhood trauma history, which have also been associated with lower performance on 
emotion recognition tasks involving facial expressions (Nazarov et al., 2014) and emotional 
prosody (Nazarov et al., 2015). However, socially-related symptoms of PTSD are not the 
only aspect of PTSD symptomatology that appear to be associated with performance on 
social cognition tasks. In the majority of these studies, performance on emotion recognition 
and compassion tasks was also negatively associated with the other symptoms of hyper-
arousal and intrusion, consistent with the fact that social function is not an explicit 
component of these symptom types. Social cognitive function may therefore have a broad 
influence on PTSD pathology.

3.  Genetic contributors to social cognition, and links with PTSD

In addition to the main effects of increasing recovery and resilience, social environment can 
also interact with genotype (G x SE). Some studies have evaluated this G x SE interaction on 
a macro level, using geocoding to examine neighborhood effects, and found that single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) coding for serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) impact 
PTSD symptoms in high crime neighborhoods (Koenen et al., 2009), while SNPs in the gene 
coding for pituitary adenylate polypeptide activating protein receptor (ADCYAP1R1) are 
associated with high depression in high trauma neighborhoods (Lowe et al., 2015). On the 
individual level, hurricane survivors with the short/short form of the 5-HTTLPR gene were 
less likely to develop PTSD if they had high levels of social support (Kilpatrick et al., 2007). 
The candidate gene that has received the most attention with respect to social support is the 
oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), with most studies reporting on SNP at locus rs53576 
(Bradley, Davis, Wingo, Mercer, & Ressler, 2013; Sippel et al., 2017). Studies in military 
cohorts have found that individuals with the minor allele of rs53576 and insecure attachment 
style had the greatest odds of having PTSD (Sippel et al., 2017), while civilian trauma 
populations show a similar interaction with childhood family environment (Bradley et al., 
2013). The significance of the oxytocin system in ameliorating PTSD symptoms is also 
indicated by recent studies showing that administration of exogenous oxytocin can reduce 
symptoms (Flanagan, Sippel, Wahlquist, Moran-Santa Maria, & Back, 2018) or even prevent 
the disorder (van Zuiden et al., 2017). However, other studies have also found that oxytocin 
genes can increase vulnerability in some populations by increasing social sensitivity 
(McQuaid, McInnis, Matheson, & Anisman, 2016). Therefore, there may be caveats to the G 
x SE interactions, and the specific nature of the social environment needs to be considered. 
Further, social cognition may provide more insight into the impact of social environment on 
risk and resilience (McGuire et al., 2018).

When looking at the brain-related intermediate phenotypes that have been identified in 
PTSD, such as activation to face stimuli, several studies have found SNPs that are associated 
with higher amygdala reactivity (Morey et al., 2011; J.S. Stevens et al., 2014). Morey and 
colleagues found that 5-HTTLPR was associated with greater amygdala response to trauma-
related distractor images presented during a face memory task in combat-related PTSD 
(Morey et al., 2011), while Stevens and colleagues found that the risk allele in ADCYAP1R1

gene was associated with more amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in women with civilian 
PTSD (J.S. Stevens et al., 2014). While these candidate gene studies support the G x SE 
research above, it should be noted that imaging genetics studies focusing on amygdala 
reactivity have not shown good replicability in the literature (Avinun, Nevo, Knodt, Elliott, 
& Hariri, 2018). However, genome-wide studies have also identified genes associated with 
PTSD that show increased amygdala activity, as well as thalamus and fusiform gyrus, in 
response to face stimuli (Kilaru et al., 2016). Most imaging genetics studies have not 
specifically examined brain areas related to social cognition—in the next section we 
describe these areas in more detail.

4.  Neuroimaging studies of social cognition in PTSD

Studies probing the neurobiology underlying social cognitive processes can provide a more 
detailed picture of links between traumatic experiences, the processing of social cues, and 
symptoms of PTSD. Neuroimaging studies in healthy participants have identified a set of 
“core” brain regions involved in social cognition (Figure 2). Regions along the ventral and 
dorsal visual streams are implicated in specialized perceptual processing for stimuli 
involving the human body and biological motion. These include the fusiform “face area” in 
face perception, the extrastriate “body area” in perceiving bodies and biological or 
intentional motion, and posterior aspects of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) in a host of 
mentalizing tasks including thinking about the perspective of someone else, making 
judgments about others’ traits, recognizing emotions from facial expressions, and perceiving 
motivated behaviors (Carter & Huettel, 2013; Schurz, Radua, Aichhorn, Richlan, & Perner, 
2014). Similar to the TPJ, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is consistently 
activated across a number of different task demands involving social information, but 
appears closely linked with the capacity to make inferences about stable traits in others, 
whereas the TPJ is more involved in making inferences about transient social information 
(Schurz et al., 2014; Van Overwalle, 2009). Finally, more focused meta-analysis of 
responses to others’ emotional states suggests that tasks involving passive viewing (dubbed 
“affective-perceptual empathy”) activate the bilateral insula, whereas tasks involving 
assessments of others’ emotional states (“cognitive empathy”) activate the mid-cingulate 
cortex (Fan, Duncan, de Greck, & Northoff, 2011). With the large number of neuroimaging 
studies and detailed modeling of social cognition in healthy participants, we are able to draw 
inferences about specific components of social perception and inference that may be altered 
with traumatic stress.

Only a small number of neuroimaging studies have directly investigated social processing in 
PTSD. An interesting series of studies conducted by Steuwe, Lanius, and colleagues (2014; 
2015) used a social threat paradigm, in which participants viewed dynamic video stimuli of 
virtual characters who entered the visual field with an emotional facial expression, and 
directed their gaze directly at the participant, or averted their gaze. 16 adult women with a 
history of childhood abuse and current PTSD were compared with a control group of healthy 
participants without a history of trauma. Relative to controls, the PTSD group showed less 
engagement of brain regions typically involved in perception of facial and bodily motion, 
and mentalizing, including the left TPJ and right temporal pole. The PTSD group also 
showed greater activation in brain regions in the descending sympathetic arousal pathway

including the left superior colliculus/periaqueductal gray, and the locus coeruleus (Steuwe et 
al., 2014). The superior colliculus and locus coeruleus also showed greater functional 
connectivity with a broad network of regions involved in emotion regulation in the PTSD 
versus control groups, including the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, insula, thalamus, 
caudate, and putamen (Steuwe et al., 2015). These findings suggest that women with PTSD 
mobilize a broad network of regions involved in responding to threat, when confronted with 
a social stimulus that is not overtly threatening. Furthermore, women with PTSD did not 
activate the same set of mentalizing-related brain regions engaged by controls (TPJ, 
temporal pole).

One possible interpretation is that activation of midbrain descending arousal pathways may 
reflect a panic response which occurs at the expense of potential perspective-taking, and 
may partly explain the mentalizing and emotion recognition deficits often observed in 
individuals with PTSD. Similarly, Mazza and colleagues (2015) asked survivors of the 2009 
earthquake in L’Aquila, Italy to participate in fMRI using naturalistic scene stimuli 
depicting people with emotional and neutral facial expressions, and to rate their own and the 
others’ feelings. Participants with PTSD reported feeling less emotion than earthquake 
survivors with no PTSD when confronted with others’ emotional expressions, but the groups 
did not differ in their subjective responses to the neutral stimuli. In addition, the PTSD group 
showed greater activation of subcortical emotional brain regions including the anterior insula 
and ventral striatum in a comparison of own > other emotion ratings (Mazza et al., 2015). 
Further examination of the ventral striatum, a region involved in reward and motivation, 
showed that both groups engaged this region more for self- than other-focused emotion 
rating (the PTSD group to a greater extent). For the anterior insula, a region involved in 
representing one’s own and others internal physiological states, the control group showed 
more activation for other- than self-focused emotion rating, and the PTSD group did not. 
Taken together, these initial neuroimaging studies of social cognition in PTSD suggest that 
deficits may not be produced by alterations in the core set of brain regions involved in 
mentalizing or emotion recognition (e.g., TPJ, dmPFC), but may instead be related to 
heightened emotional responses to social signals conveying information about threat, which 
interfere with the ability to reason about others’ internal states. While responses to social 
threat cues appear heightened in PTSD, in contrast, fMRI responses to social reward may be 
impaired. A recent within-subjects placebo-controlled study of intranasal oxytocin 
administration showed that PTSD diagnosis was associated with lower anterior insula 
activation in a social reward task (Nawijn et al., 2017), and that oxytocin administration 
increased anterior insula activation in the PTSD group.

Although neuroimaging-based efforts to investigate social function in PTSD are just 
beginning, a large number of studies of PTSD have investigated arousal- or vigilance-related 
brain activation in response to stimuli that conveyed emotional information using social 
cues. One of the most prolific paradigms in the field of PTSD has been to use symptom 
provocation by presenting threatening and non-threatening social cues in the form of fearful 
or angry facial expressions, and neutral or happy facial expressions. Some of these tasks 
included an explicit emotion-recognition component, whereas others presented emotional 
faces but did not require the performance of any social cognitive task. The great majority of 
these studies find that individuals with PTSD show amygdala hyper-reactivity to threatening

(fearful/angry) versus non-threatening stimuli (neutral/happy/non-face comparison) (e.g., 
Fonzo et al., 2010; Rauch et al., 2000; Shin et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2011; Jennifer S. 
Stevens et al., 2013). Such findings have provided the central narrative for neuroimaging 
research on PTSD, and are thought to reflect heightened fear or vigilance responses to 
threatening environmental cues. Consistent with this idea, amygdala hyper-reactivity in 
PTSD is correlated with the severity of hyper-arousal symptoms, but not re-experiencing or 
avoidance/numbing symptoms (Lieberman, Gorka, DiGangi, Frederick, & Phan, 2017; 
Jennifer S. Stevens et al., 2013).

Importantly, a heightened amygdala response to negative affective face stimuli is not just 
related to current PTSD symptoms, but also appears to be a risk factor associated with 
vulnerability to future symptoms. In a longitudinal study of young adults who participated in 
fMRI at a baseline visit, amygdala reactivity prior to exposure to stressful life events was a 
significant predictor of subsequent anxiety and depression symptoms in individuals with 
high levels of stress exposure (Swartz, Knodt, Radtke, & Hariri, 2015). Similarly, in studies 
of military personnel and adolescents exposed to a terrorist attack, using fMRI with tasks 
that included implicitly social content (e.g., portraits of military personnel or scenes 
depicting interpersonal violence), amygdala reactivity prior to the traumatic event predicted 
subsequent PTSD symptom severity (Admon et al., 2009; McLaughlin et al., 2014). Parallel 
findings also extend to the peri-traumatic period – amygdala reactivity to negative affective 
face stimuli shortly after an Emergency Department trauma has been associated with the 
maintenance of high PTSD symptom levels over the next year (Jennifer S. Stevens et al., 
2017). Interestingly, the PTSD-linked profile of heightened amygdala reactivity to negative 
face stimuli has also been linked with oxytocin. In a placebo-controlled study of police 
officers with PTSD, those with the highest amygdala reactivity to emotional faces under 
placebo had the largest reduction in reactivity with oxytocin, further highlighting that 
neuropeptides central to social processing may be tightly linked with amygdala hyper-
reactivity in PTSD (Koch et al., 2015). Taken together, the neuroimaging literature suggests 
that the processing of emotional information from social cues may be an important 
contributor to later risk and resilience to trauma or other stressful life events.

5.  Are hyper-arousal responses in PTSD greater for social than non-social 

cues?

Interestingly, PTSD-related amygdala hyper-reactivity to threatening or negatively valenced 
stimuli is observed less consistently for classes of stimuli other than faces. For example, 
both Phan (2006), and later Van Rooij (2015), found that war veterans with PTSD did not 
show amygdala hyper-reactivity to negatively-valenced complex scene stimuli. In fact, the 
PET study conducted by Phan and colleagues showed less left amygdala activation than 
healthy or combat control groups in response to negative scenes, whereas Van Rooij and 
colleagues showed no difference between the three groups in their fMRI study. This is also 
the case for negative emotional words (e.g., Thomaes et al., 2009), and for narrative scripts 
prompting participants to recall a trauma during fMRI (Lanius et al., 2001; Shin et al., 
1999). In response to these stimuli, PTSD groups also do not typically show amygdala 
hyper-reactivity relative to controls.

A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies comparing different task types partially confirmed 
a dissociation between different types of tasks involving negative stimuli (Hayes, Hayes, & 
Mikedis, 2012). A subset of studies involving symptom provocation through trauma 
reminders did not show consistent amygdala hyper-reactivity associated with PTSD. In 
contrast, the meta-analysis aggregating cognitive-emotional studies, which used stimuli that 
were negative, but not trauma-related, showed amygdala hyper-reactivity for PTSD versus 
control participants (Hayes et al., 2012). This second analysis included emotional faces, but 
also tasks involving complex scene stimuli, negative words, and other non-social stimuli. A 
similar large-scale comparison of social and non-social stimuli has not been performed, and 
would be useful for testing the hypothesis that individuals with PTSD may preferentially 
engage the amygdala for threat cues involving social stimuli, in contrast with non-social 
stimuli.

If confirmed, this would entail a significant narrowing of the interpretation of amygdala 
hyper-reactivity in PTSD. Amygdala reactivity in this case would not reflect a broad 
increase in threat-related responding or vigilance to environmental threat, but would be 
specifically linked with the processing of social cues. This may be reasonable, as evidence 
from amygdala lesion studies indicates that this region plays a role in face processing which 
is not specific to the emotional content of the faces, as deficits have been observed in 
perceiving eye gaze direction and the ability to learn to recognize new faces post-lesion 
(Young et al., 1995). Furthermore, neurons in the medial amygdala of macaques have been 
shown to be selective for either faces (Leonard, Rolls, Wilson, & Baylis, 1985) or other 
social stimuli such as movies of conspecific behavior (Brothers, Ring, & Kling, 1990), and 
not responsive to negative affective stimuli. Therefore, some aspects of amygdala function 
may be specialized for the processing of social stimuli in particular.

6.  Conclusions

PTSD patients consistently show deficits in social cognitive task performance, particularly 
for emotion recognition and mentalizing (perspective-taking) tasks. Given the consistency of 
these findings, and the clear role of interpersonal relationships in shaping responses to 
trauma, additional resources should be devoted to understanding the role of social cognition 
in PTSD risk and resilience. In particular, further investigation is needed to determine the 
timecourse of social cognitive deficits – whether they exist prior to trauma and contribute to 
a weaker social network less likely to enhance recovery, or whether the deficits are a product 
of the stress reaction to the trauma. Initial evidence from the findings of the meta-analysis 
also suggests that trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD may have an advantage in 
social cognition, and longitudinal research can help determine the extent to which this 
reflects a trait-like resilience factor, or whether the trauma exposure itself can increase social 
cognition in a subset of individuals.

Neuroimaging studies of PTSD suggest that hyper-reactivity of limbic and midbrain arousal 
pathways to even low-level social threat cues may be a primary driver of deficits in emotion 
recognition and mentalizing, interfering with the ability to make inferences about the 
internal states of others. Additionally, findings implicating the amygdala in PTSD symptoms 
of hyper-reactivity to threat may be limited to social stimuli, suggesting that reactivity to

incoming social cues may partly explain hyper-arousal symptoms in PTSD. However, only a 
limited number of neuroimaging studies has directly compared social and non-social stimuli, 
or incorporated tasks designed to probe different aspects of social cognitive processing. 
Further research in this area is needed. Taken together, the findings point to an important 
role of social cognition in PTSD, and suggest that interventions designed to increase social 
cognitive functioning may represent promising new approaches to improving trauma-related 
outcomes.

Figure 1. 
Summary of effect sizes for group differences in performance on social cognitive tasks, 
comparing PTSD, trauma-exposed control (TC), and healthy control (HC) groups. Panel A 
shows the summary across all studies, and Panel B shows the effect sizes broken down by 
type of trauma exposure for the populations examined in each study. Because only a few 
studies examined specific trauma types, the results of Panel B are illustrative only, and a 
statistical comparison of these groups was not performed.

Figure 2. 
An extensive human neuroimaging literature has demonstrated a set of brain regions 
consistently engaged by social stimuli. To provide a schematic example of key brain regions 
involved in social cognition, we created a brain map using the text-based meta-analytic tool 
Neurosynth. The search term “social” aggregated findings from the 1000 published papers in 
the database containing the term, and compared the results against findings of all papers not 
containing the word “social.” Thresholded maps for this analysis are shown above (p<.01, 
FDR-corrected).
