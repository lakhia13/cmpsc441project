Abstract

Objectives:  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave behavioral and 
cognitive therapy that increases psychological flexibility through mindfulness, acceptance, and 
value-driven behavior change. ACT has been successfully used to inform a variety of health 
interventions. Using non-therapists to deliver ACT-based behavioral health interventions offers 
an opportunity to provide cost efficient and integrated care, particularly among underserved 
populations experiencing barriers to mental health care, such as inadequate insurance, mental 
health stigma, and provider shortages. This systematic review aims to: 1) identify ACT-informed 
behavioral health interventions delivered by laypeople and 2) review the specific characteristics 
of each intervention including number and duration of sessions, delivery modality, interventionist 
training, and intervention outcomes.

Methods:  Two databases (PubMed and PsycINFO) were systematically searched for relevant 
literature. To further identify relevant studies, references of included manuscripts were checked, 
the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science’s webpage was examined, and an email was 
sent to the ACBS Health Special Interest Group listserv. Study abstracts and full texts (in English) 
were screened, resulting in 23 eligible articles describing 19 different interventions.

Results:  A total of 1,781 abstracts were screened, 76 were eligible for full-text review, and 23 
were included in a narrative synthesis. There were 19 unique interventions identified and delivered 
by the following: general healthcare workers (n= 7), trained researchers (n = 5), women/mothers 
(n= 2), municipal workers (n= 2), and teachers (n = 3). Eleven studies were RCTs and eight 
utilized alternative study designs. Study quality varied, with two rated as high risk for bias and 
eight rated to have some concerns. Target populations included clinical and non-clinical samples. 
There was some consistency in the effects reported in the studies: increases in pain tolerance,

Introduction

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave behavioral and cognitive 
therapy that emphasizes mindfulness, acceptance, and value-driven behavior change (Hayes, 
Luoma, Bond, Masuda, & Lillis, 2006; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2011; Wilson, Bordieri, 
Flynn, Lucas, & Slater, 2011). ACT is informed by Relational Frame Theory and 
experimental work regarding the influence of language on behavior (De Houwer, Barnes-
Holmes, & Barnes-Holmes, 2016; Zettle, 2005). ACT has been described as targeting 
internal experiences related to: Thoughts, Emotions, Associations, Memories, Sensations 
(TEAMS) (Robinson, Gould, & Strosahl, 2010) and works to enhance psychological 
flexibility (Hayes et al., 2006). ACT employs six core therapeutic processes: acceptance, 
cognitive defusion, mindfulness, self-as-context, committed action, and valued living (Hayes 
et al., 2006). The combination of these processes facilitate behavior change through helping 
individuals define and plan realistic and effective behaviors congruent with their own values. 
There are four properties of psychological flexibility fundamental to mental and physical 
health, as well as overall well-being: (1) recognizing/adapting to situational demands, 
(2) shifting perspective when functioning is compromised, (3) balancing competing life 
domains, and (4) being aware, open, and committed to behaviors that are congruent 
with personal values (Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010). These properties of psychological 
flexibility fuel behavioral maintenance to healthy living (Kwasnicka, Dombrowski, White, 
& Sniehotta, 2016). When long term values are ignored, health outcomes and quality of 
life can suffer (Spleen, Lengerich, Camacho, & Vanderpool, 2014). Delaying preventive 
healthcare, medication nonadherence, and denial about behavioral risk are associated with 
poor health (Byrne, 2008). ACT increases willingness to experience unpleasant TEAMS to 
allow individuals to engage in meaningful and healthy behaviors (Hayes et al., 2006).

ACT has been successfully used to inform a variety of mental health conditions including 
anxiety (Swain, Hancock, Hainsworth, & Bowman, 2013), depression (Bai, Luo, Zhang, 
Wu, & Chi, 2020) and psychosis (Yıldız, 2020). Although initially developed for the 
treatment of psychopathology (Hayes et al., 2006), ACT has been found to also be beneficial 
in addressing health behaviors, adjustment to chronic illness, and other life conditions. ACT 
has been used to address physical health conditions and health behavior change including: 
smoking cessation (Zeng, Heffner, Copeland, Mull, & Bricker, 2016), chronic pain (Lin 
et al., 2017; Trompetter, Schreurs, Heuts, & Vollenbroek-Hutten, 2014), diet and physical 
activity (Goodwin, Forman, Herbert, Butryn, & Ledley, 2012), weight control (Lillis, Hayes,

& Levin, 2011), health anxiety (Hoffmann, Rask, Hedman-Lagerlof, Ljotsson, & Frostholm, 
2018), and diabetes (Nes, Van Dulmen, Eide, Finset, Kristjansdottir, Steen, & Eide, 2012).

A global priority to help eliminate mental health treatment gaps is to improve access to 
high-quality and evidence-based mental health services through sustainable public health 
systems (Wainberg et al., 2017). The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended 
talking therapies as a first-line treatment for many mental health concerns, which can 
easily be delegated to laypersons. Task-shifting in mental health is when aspects of therapy 
are delegated to non-specialists, such as laypersons. Existing evidence supports the use 
of task-shifting in mental health (Winiarski, Rufa, & Karnik, 2019). For example, the 
Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) was created to provide treatment via 
laypersons for adults with depression, anxiety, substance use and trauma and stress related 
disorders in low- and middle-income countries (Murray et al., 2014). Similar interventions 
have been successful in the United States (US). One study found that, when provided 
training, laypeople with a bachelor-level education could successfully deliver effective 
cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (Stanley 
et al., 2014). Another intervention successfully employed empathetic listening, delivered 
through laypersons, to address loneliness, depression, and anxiety (Kahlon et al., 2021). 
In 2020, a video-conferenced behavioral activation intervention, delivered by laypersons, 
decreased loneliness, depression, and disability among an older population (Choi, Pepin, 
Marti, Stevens, & Bruce, 2020). Task-shifting interventions show global promise even when 
administered via diverse modalities (in-person, phone, video calls).

Using non-clinicians or laypeople to deliver ACT-based health interventions offers an 
opportunity to provide cost-efficient and integrated care, particularly among underserved 
populations experiencing barriers to mental health care such as inadequate insurance 
coverage (Mongelli, Georgakopoulos, & Pato, 2020). Additionally, ACT interventions 
incorporating laypeople as interventionists may address other barriers to mental health 
care including stigma (Mongelli et al., 2020). Utilizing laypersons within a community 
creates an opportunity to eliminate language barriers, enhance rapport and willingness to 
seek mental health services, and decrease biases held by individuals from different cultures. 
For example, recruiting members of the LBGTQ+ community alleviates antigay prejudices 
among providers. Further, many individuals prefer to seek mental health treatment from 
non-clinicians (Iheanacho et al., 2021). Offering mental health services from laypersons, 
such as clergy, enhances willingness to seek services and addresses racial disparities in 
mental health. Furthermore, community-level barriers, including mental health workforce 
shortages, geographical clustering of providers, and few community-based interventions 
reinforces gaps in treatment that could be attenuated by training laypeople to deliver ACT-
based interventions (Mongelli et al., 2020).

Training laypeople as interventionists for ACT-based counseling could allow medically 
underserved populations to access care in the community and at venues within easy 
geographic reach. ACT has been applied in a variety of intervention modalities, including 
one day workshops, in-person sessions, and telephone or video conferencing (Dindo, Van 
Liew, & Arch, 2017) and has been effectively delivered by laypeople who are not mental 
health professionals (e.g. physical therapists (Godfrey et al., 2019), parents (Y. Y. Chong,

Y. W. Mak, S. P. Leung, S. Y. Lam, & A. Y. Loke, 2019), correctional officers (Zarling 
& Berta, 2017), and counselor/nurse/occupational therapists (Gaudiano & Herbert, 2006; 
Moitra, LaPlante, Armstrong, Chan, & Stein, 2017). This positions ACT as a potentially 
useful and cost-effective treatment to deploy within communities as it applies to a wide 
range of mental health and physical health conditions and can be effectively delivered by 
those without professional mental health training.

Many prior non-ACT interventions delivered by laypersons have a protocol for the 
intervention, including training and supervision needed for interventionists. For example, 
to become a CETA counselor, laypersons must complete a protocoled brief training and 
receive ongoing supervision (Murray et al., 2014). Little is known about what ACT-based 
interventions delivered by laypersons currently exist or the training necessary for successful 
implementation. Understanding the delivery of ACT interventions by laypeople in different 
community settings will inform future successful protocol development for ACT-based 
interventions both in the US and internationally. To date, we are not aware of systematic 
reviews specifically evaluating ACT-based behavioral health interventions delivered by 
laypeople. Therefore, the current investigation aims to address this gap in the literature 
by systematically reviewing published literature to date for ACT-informed behavioral health 
interventions delivered by non-mental health professionals. We define behavioral health 
interventions as interventions that target human actions that impact health. Our aims were 
to: 1) identify ACT-informed behavioral health interventions delivered by laypeople and 2) 
review the specific characteristics of each intervention including number and duration of 
sessions, delivery modality, interventionist training, and intervention outcomes. Knowing the 
characteristics of impactful interventions will inform future research and implementation 
efforts.

Methods

An extensive systematic literature review was conducted, according to the guidelines 
proposed by the PRISMA-S (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
Analyses literature search extension) checklist (Rethlefsen et al., 2021). The PRISMA-S 
provides guidelines for authors to verify that each component of a literature search is 
reported and reproducible.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

The Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study (PICOS) formulation is 
an accepted mechanism used in systematic reviews to frame a review question about 
interventions, in this case layperson delivered ACT informed interventions (Brown et 
al., 2006; Fineout-Overholt & Johnston, 2005; Higgins et al., 2019). Our inclusion and 
exclusion criteria were developed using PICOS guidelines, which helped operationalize 
a systematic and consistent approach for selecting appropriate studies. Table 1 outlines 
the PICOS criteria. The title, abstract, and methods sections of citations attained from 
initial searches and via secondary examination of reference lists were subjected to the 
below inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full papers of retained citations were retrieved and 
re-subjected to the below full inclusion and exclusion criteria. To enable maximum breadth

of the review, no inclusion restrictions were placed on study design, age of participants, 
health concern of interest, setting, control/comparison condition, or duration of follow-up.

Exclusion criteria included the following: 1) study types including literature reviews, 
meta-analyses, measure validation studies, qualitative studies, theoretical articles, and book 
chapters; 2) studies with experienced or novice mental health professionals (psychiatrist, 
psychologist, counselor, therapist, social worker, psychiatry nurse, behavior analyst, clinical 
or counseling fellows, clinical psychology or counseling grad students, etc.) delivering the 
intervention; 3) studies with technological delivery of the intervention (online, app, gaming, 
etc.) with no supplementary interventionist meetings; or with self-administered intervention 
(i.e., self-help guidebooks, workbooks, diaries) without a supplementary interventionist 
meeting; and 4) articles not prepared in English.

Search and screening procedures

Database Search.—Electronic searches of the PsycInfo and PubMed databases were 
undertaken; see Table 2 for search terms. The search was conducted in March 2021 and 
included any published literature meeting search criteria up to that date.

Literature Review Reference Search.—The Association for Contextual Behavioral 
Science webpage (ACBS) (http://contextualscience.org/) is an international online learning 
and research community for professionals with an interest in ACT. We searched the 
published articles on this site for recently published relevant literature reviews. We identified 
four comprehensive literature reviews and reviewed their reference lists for additional 
articles (Brown, Glendenning, Hoon, & John, 2016; Coronado et al., 2020; Dochat, 
Wooldridge, Herbert, Lee, & Afari, 2021; Graham, Gouick, Krahé, & Gillanders, 2016).

ACBS Listserv Search.—An email requesting ACT based interventions delivered by 
non-mental health professionals was sent to the ACBS Health Special Interest Group (SIG) 
ACT for Health SIG.

Data extraction, synthesis and quality assessment

All potential articles were uploaded into the web-based software, Covidence (Babineau, 
2014), for review. Three reviewers independently reviewed the title, abstract, and methods 
section against inclusion and exclusion criteria. A separate reviewer double checked at 
random 30% (~500) of the articles. Studies included for full text review were then 
independently reviewed by two reviewers to determine which articles to include. Reference 
lists of identified studies were examined for additional articles. The final list of studies was 
discussed as a team to ensure consensus was reached. The following data elements were 
extracted from selected manuscripts: (1) information specific to publication (e.g., year of 
publication, authors, title, journal), (2) sample characteristics (e.g., demographics, clinical 
condition), (3) study design features (e.g., randomization schema, exposures, comparators, 
and analyzed sample sizes), (4) specific characteristics of ACT based interventions delivered 
by laypeople including number and duration of sessions, group size, delivery modality, 
assignment of home practice, interventionist training, and intervention fidelity, and relevant 
primary outcomes (e.g., treatment satisfaction, mental and physical health outcomes).

After the removal of duplicate articles, 1,736 abstracts were screened at Stage 1, 76 full text 
articles were reviewed at Stage 2, of which 23 were included in the narrative synthesis. See 
Figure 1 for a complete breakdown of reviewed articles.

Overview of Included Studies

Table 3 provides an overview of all included published articles. We included 23 articles 
which covered 19 different interventions. Publications on the same intervention were 
reported together. There was a broad range of ACT interventionists, which we categorized 
in the following five subgroups: general healthcare workers (n= 7), trained researchers (n = 
5), women/mothers (n= 2), municipal workers (n= 2), and teachers (n = 3). Across studies, 
session frequency and length ranged from one session to 24 sessions of ACT with the 
majority of studies offering between 4–6 sessions. Intervention delivery formats were varied 
and included individual, group, phone, virtual, or some combination of these modalities.

Narrative Synthesis

A Narrative Synthesis of the 19 included ACT interventions is presented in Table 4. This 
includes a summary of the original authors’ reported results. The number of participants 
included in each study ranged from one (a case study) to over 3,000. Many of the studies 
focused on adult populations with a few focusing on caregivers and teachers. Most of the 
studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Target populations included a broad range 
of individuals experiencing mental health distress, patients with physical illnesses (e.g., 
cancer, pain, obesity), and caregivers. The amount of ACT training and supervision provided 
to the interventionists, as well as formal assessment of interventionists’ adherence to the 
ACT intervention, varied greatly and was not always specified. Interventionist ACT training 
ranged from two-day workshops to 8-month courses. However, most studies offered a few 
days of ACT training and ongoing supervision from an ACT expert.

There was little overlap in measurements or constructs used to evaluate the interventions 
and few effect sizes reported. Thus, we were unable to complete a formal meta-analysis. 
Two of the included studies were protocol only publications and had no intervention results 
published (Stapelfeldt, 2015; March, 2020). One study did not yield any differences in the 
ACT group compared to the control group among a sample of 5th graders (Van der Gucht, 
2017). The remaining 16 studies all showed promising results for ACT interventions with no 
differences observed in interventionists’ previous education, ACT training or supervision, 
session frequency and length, or session delivery modality. ACT-informed behavioral 
health interventions were successful in addressing pain tolerance, psychological inflexibility, 
psychosocial outcomes, anxiety, work attendance, food cravings, and body image concerns.

Risk of bias assessment

Risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized 
trials (RoB 2; Sterne et al., 2019;J. A. C. Sterne et al., 2019) (Brantstetter-Rost, 2009; 
Chong, 2018; Hawkes, 2013; Hawkes, 2014; Jolley, 2020; Moradi, 2019; Walseth-Hara, 
2018; Godfrey, 2020; Hulbert-Williams, 2017), the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for

cluster-randomized trials (RoB 2 CRT; Sterne et al., 2019) (Tol, 2018; Tol, 2020; Van der 
Gucht, 2017), or the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I; 
Sterne et al., 2016;J. A. Sterne et al., 2016) (Makki, 2018; Zarling, 2019), based on study 
type. These analyses are described in Table 5. Eight of the studies were rated as meriting 
“some concerns” for bias in outcome measurement due to using participant self-report 
measures. Participants were likely aware of their intervention condition given that the 
control was treatment as usual or no intervention, which may have influenced their reports 
(Godfrey, 2020; Hawke, 2013; Hawke, 2014; Jolley, 2020; Moradi, 2019; Tol, 2018; Tol, 
2020; Van der Gucht, 2017). The next most identified domain for risk of bias in the included 
studies was missing data. Five studies were missing outcome data for more than 5% of 
participants. Missing data may have been associated with the outcome (Godfrey, 2020; 
Hawkes, 2013; Hawkes, 2014; Jolley, 2020; Moradi, 2019). For one other study, more than 
5% of participants were excluded from analyses due to missing data for covariates (Zarling, 
2019). We were unable to assess risk of bias in seven of the included studies due to their 
study design or reported information (i.e., single-arm study, protocol only).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review assessing ACT-informed behavioral 
health interventions delivered by laypeople. Understanding best practices in the delivery of 
ACT interventions by laypeople in different settings have numerous benefits. It will help 
task-shift, eliminate the international mental health treatment gap, and improve access to 
high-quality and evidence-based mental health services (Wainberg et al., 2017). Overall, 
findings indicated that effective ACT-informed behavioral health interventions can be 
successfully delivered by a large variety of non-mental health professionals through a 
broad range of delivery modalities (e.g., phone, in-person, group sessions). There were no 
observed differences in effectiveness by modality, including one day workshops, in-person 
sessions, and telephone or video conferencing. Effects reported in the studies included: 
increased overall pain tolerance, increased acceptance of TEAMS related to body image 
and physical pain, increased ability to identify and engage in value driven behavior (e.g., 
reentering work or serving as caretaker), improved cognitive flexibility, and reduced overall 
psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depression). Thus, using laypeople to deliver 
ACT-based behavioral health interventions through a variety of modalities offers a unique 
opportunity to provide cost efficient integrated care and address barriers to mental health 
care (Mongelli et al., 2020). Additionally, the use of laypeople may have the added benefit 
of avoiding many of the barriers to implementation of evidence-based practices within the 
context of a mental health care system.

Training laypeople to deliver ACT-based interventions and provide task-shifting seems like 
a promising strategy to increase overall access to interventions targeting mental health 
distress; however more research is needed. For example, there are limited interventions 
focused on each health condition/behavior. Thus, future studies should aim to replicate these 
findings for each population, to ascertain that layperson delivered ACT works for each target 
group.

Additionally, these duplicate studies should utilize different delivery modalities and session 
lengths and frequencies to determine which is the best method per target population. Most 
interventions did not specify which ACT core therapeutic processes (acceptance, cognitive 
defusion, mindfulness, self-as-context, committed action, valued living) they implemented 
or which TEAMS were targeted (Hayes et al., 2006). Future studies are needed to further 
assess which processes should be pursued. In addition to further research on the efficacy 
of layperson-delivered ACT interventions, there is a need for investigations on structural 
and organizational barriers that facilitate or impede the implementation of these programs 
in specific settings. For example, in the United States healthcare system, concerns regarding 
the eligibility of lay-delivered ACT interventions for insurance reimbursement may limit the 
ability of medical centers to enact such programs, even in the presence of strong support for 
their efficacy. Cost effectiveness analyses should also be conducted in various environments 
when combining treatments to determine the overall cost benefit for each intervention. 
More longitudinal studies are needed to determine cause-effect relationships between the 
intervention and outcomes. Lastly, future studies should more systematically assess and 
determine what amount of training and supervision is needed for treatment delivery with 
fidelity and competency.

This review has limitations that should be considered. We were only able to include 
interventions that were published. This may have prevented us from including less effective 
ACT based intervention delivered by laypeople and ongoing studies that have yet to publish 
their protocol or study results. Additionally, many studies did not specify the educational 
background or training of their interventionist in their titles or abstracts. This barrier 
prevented us from including studies from conference abstracts or clinicaltrials.gov. Our 
study procedure included the review of titles, abstracts, and methods sections as part of 
the initial review; however, we anticipate that some studies meeting inclusion criteria may 
have been missed during initial screening. Many of the studies did not explicitly report 
which ACT processes were targeted through the intervention and we are unable to report 
which processes should be targeted in future interventions. Similar to other reviews, the 
results from this synthesis may be limited by the selected search procedures and the 
inability to identify/include all potentially relevant studies, including non-English language 
publications. Lastly, five of the included studies were missing data from more than 5% of 
the study participants, thus conclusions drawn from the studies should be considered with 
caution (Godfrey, 2020; Hawkes, 2013; Hawkes, 2014; Jolley, 2020; Moradi, 2019).

Limitations

Conclusions

This systematic review identified and appraised the existing ACT based behavioral 
health interventions delivered by non-mental health professional interventionists and their 
effectiveness. Overall, findings indicated that ACT interventions can be successfully 
delivered by a variety of laypeople (e.g., teachers, caregivers) and show promise in 
being effective at addressing psychological distress and increasing health behaviors. More 
research is needed to determine the most effective modalities and ACT processes for each 
intervention.

PICOS Criteria for Study Inclusion

Table 1.

Population

All participants currently engaged in a behavioral health ACT based intervention. The review included all age ranges, races, 
ethnicities, and genders.

Intervention

ACT informed behavioral health interventions (e.g., chronic pain, stress management, medication uptake/adherence) delivered 
by non-mental health professionals. Intervention studies that specified they used ACT to inform the intervention or ACT as 
part of the building process. Studies with laypeople delivering the intervention or someone not typically delivering mental 
health services. Those who practice general medicine (doctors, nurses, etc.) not previously trained in ACT were included.

Comparison

Anyone not currently engaged in the ACT intervention undergoing testing including waitlist controls, active control, 
superiority, enhanced usual control, treatment as usual (TAU) and no intervention. The review was not limited by comparison 
studies.

Outcome

There were no specific outcomes of interest. Interventions examining a variety of health conditions and behaviors were 
included

Study Design

Both single and multiple arm study designs including non-randomized, quasi-experimental, waitlist control, quasi-
experimental designs and randomized control trials. This review was not limited by study design.

Summary of Article’s Reported 
Results

Physical therapy informed 
by ACT (PACT) 
showed significantly greater 
improvements in secondary 
measures of pain-related 
interference compared to physical 
therapy alone at 3 but not at 12 
months.

No results reported.

The ACT group had significantly 
fewer visits to clinics and fewer 
days and nights with asthma 
symptoms. ACT parents had less 
psychologically inflexible, fewer 
negative emotional experiences, 
and fewer symptoms of stress and 
better quality of life.

Group 1: ACT-based 
intervention

ACT informed evidence-based 
intervention can be implemented 
to adolescents during brief 
inpatient treatment. Adolescents’ 
skills in line with ACT 
processes: accepting thoughts, not 
suppressing feelings, focusing on 
present, mindfulness, emotional 
regulation, and stress reduction 
techniques.

The ACT intervention was highly 
acceptable and effect sizes across 
outcomes ranged from very 
small to large, mostly favoring 
ACTnow.

The different types of exercises 
in the intervention were suitable 
for learning a variety of self-
regulation skills. The ACT-based 
intervention provided tools for 
dealing with problematic thoughts 
and feelings that are often a 
barrier to life-style changes, 
assistance in identifying personal 
values and in setting concrete 
goals, and encouraged taking 
value-based actions.

Summary of Article’s Reported 
Results

Acceptance and acceptance 
plus values intervention had 
a significant impact on pain 
tolerance, but not on threshold. 
The incorporation of values 
showed significantly greater pain 
tolerance than acceptance alone.

Caregivers showed a large 
reduction in anxiety symptoms 
immediately after intervention 
and were maintained at 3- and 
6-month follow-up. Psychological 
suffering and caregiver burden 
decreased at 6-month follow-up.

Intervention group had higher 
odds of reentering work and more 
days paid work compared to the 
control group.

Each intervention out-performed 
control in respect of consumption, 
but not cravings. These 
techniques may be helpful in 
managing food cravings.

Improved cognitive flexibility 
from pre to post with no 
change from post to follow-up; 
decreased cognitive fusion pre 
to post, pre to follow-up and 
post to follow-up; change of 
time for values (increases) in 
the following domains: family, 
marriage, parenting, friends, fun, 
community life, self-care.

Overall, the Self-Help Plus 
intervention can be rapidly 
deployed to large numbers 
of participants and reduce 
psychological distress among 
South Sudanese female refugees.

The ACTV group had 
significantly fewer charges during 
treatment and at 12-month 
follow-up. This study offered 
evidence for the feasibility and 
effectiveness of an ACT-based 
group for men who have been 
arrested for domestic assault.

counselors.
