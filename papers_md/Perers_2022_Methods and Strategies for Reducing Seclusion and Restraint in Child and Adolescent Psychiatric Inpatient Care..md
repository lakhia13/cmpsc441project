Abstract
Restraints  and  seclusions  are  restrictive  interventions  used  in  psychiatric  inpatient  units 
when  there  is  an  imminent  risk  of  harm  to  the  patient  or  others.  Coercive  measures  are 
controversial  and  can  lead  to  negative  consequences,  including  negative  emotions,  re-
traumatization,  injuries,  or  death.  The  article  summarizes  the  last  10  years  of  literature 
regarding methods and strategies used for reducing seclusions and restraints in child and 
adolescent  psychiatric  inpatient  units,  and  reports  on  their  outcomes.  The  literature  was 
reviewed  by  searching  PubMed  and  PsycInfo  for  English-language  articles  published 
between  May  2010  and  May  2020.  Eighteen  articles  were  found  that  described  methods 
or  strategies  aimed  at  reducing  restraint  or  seclusion  utilization  in  child  and  adolescent 
psychiatric inpatient units. The following interventions were evaluated: Trauma-Informed 
Care  (TIC),  Six  Core  Strategies,  Child  and  Family  Centered  Care  (CFCC),  Collabora-
tive  &  Proactive  Solutions  (CPS),  Strength-Based  Care,  Modified  Positive  Behavioral 
Interventions  and  Supports  (M-PBIS),  Behavioral  Modification  Program  (BMP),  Autism 
Spectrum  Disorder  Care  Pathway  (ASD-CP),  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT),  sen-
sory  rooms,  Mindfulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  Training  (MBSR)  of  staff,  and  Milieu 
Nurse-Client  Shift  Assignments.  Most  of  the  interventions  reduced  the  use  of  seclusions 
and/or restraints. Two child-centered and trauma-informed initiatives eliminated the use of 
mechanical restraints. This review shows that the use of coercive measures can be reduced 
and should be prioritized. Successful implementation requires ongoing commitment on all 
levels of an organization and a willingness to learn. To facilitate comparisons, future mod-
els should evaluate different standardized parameters.

Introduction

Psychiatric Quarterly (2022) 93:107–136

Restraints  and  seclusions  are  restrictive  interventions  used  in  psychiatric  inpatient  units, 
including  units  for  children  and  adolescents,  when  there  is  an  imminent  risk  of  harm  to 
the patient or others [1]. These methods are controversial. Restraints have been associated 
with many adverse effects, and put both patients and staff at risk of injury and death [2, 3]. 
In 1998, reports in the Hartford Courant revealed that 142 patients in the U.S. had died in 
the previous 10 years as a result of restraint [4]. Many of these were children who had died 
of asphyxiation [5]. A recent systematic review on the effects of coercive interventions in 
adult psychiatry estimated an incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder after seclusion or 
restraint varying from 25 to 47% [6]. Other consequences were revival of previous trauma-
tism,  hallucinations,  and  negative  emotions,  particularly  feelings  of  punishment  and  dis-
tress. Restraint reduction can lead to reduced costs, reduced sick time among staff, fewer 
injuries to adolescents and staff, and reduced staff turnover [7].

The  definition  of  restraint  varies  between  countries,  but  refers  broadly  to  an  involun-
tary  restriction  of  movement  through  manual  holds,  mechanical  devices,  or  medication. 
Mechanical restraint involves some form of restrictive device, such as belts or a specially 
designed bed [2]. Chemical or pharmacological restraint refers to an intramuscular injec-
tion  of  a  sedative  medication.  Seclusion  is  defined  as  an  involuntary  confinement  of  a 
patient in a room where the patient is physically prevented from leaving.

Legislation regarding coercive measures differs between countries. There is a movement 
towards less coercion and, as attitudes change, legislation revision follows. As an example, 
The Compulsory Mental Care Act in Sweden was recently updated, reducing the maximum 
duration  of  bed  restraints  for  children  from  4  h  to  1  h  and  seclusions  from  8  to  2  h  [1]. 
This development is in alignment with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, which states that, in all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child is 
to be a primary consideration [8].

Mechanical  restraints  are  probably  the  least  accepted  containment  measure,  and  have 
been  described  as  distressing  and  inhumane  by  Finnish  adolescents  [9].  In  an  American 
study, children and adolescents aged 12–15 reported that they associated fear, anger, and 
re-traumatization with the use of physical restraint [10]. Adult patients and staff in emer-
gency care mental health services in England also reported strong disapproval of any form 
of mechanical restraint [11]. Seclusion seems to be slightly more accepted among adoles-
cents, when compared to mechanical restraints [9, 12]. However, a systematic review cov-
ering adult psychiatric inpatients’ experience of seclusion revealed that, during seclusion, 
patients felt vulnerable, neglected, and abused, disconnected from the experience, and felt 
it was dangerous to their mental health [13].

The  experience  of  seclusions  and  restraints  varies  among  individuals.  A  systematic 
review on the effects in adult psychiatry reported that some patients described feelings of 
safety, help, and clinical improvement, or evaluated the intervention as necessary [6]. Nev-
ertheless, the review concluded that the interventions were mostly associated with negative 
emotions, particularly feelings of punishment and distress. Therapeutic interaction seemed 
to influence the perceptions of coercion and reduce negative effects when coercive meas-
ures  were  not  avoidable.  Similar  results  were  found  in  a  review  on  adults’  perspectives 
of  being  physically  restrained.  Although  some  patients  described  feelings  of  safety  and 
being helped, and experiencing concern from the nurses while being restrained, they still 
reported more negative feelings overall [14]. Common themes included anger, fear, humili-
ation, and powerlessness.

In interviews with psychiatric nurses in Ireland, restraint and seclusion were interpreted 
as  a  last  resort  in  the  management  of  client’s  aggression  and  violence  [15].  The  nurses 
experienced significant emotional distress when compelled to engage in the interventions 
and, as a way to get through the incidents, the nurses appeared to suppress their distressing 
emotions. The harsh nature of these interventions also conflicted with the caring aspects of 
the nursing role. In a recent systematic review, nurses viewed coercive measures as unde-
sirable but necessary to maintain safety on psychiatric wards [16]. They also expressed a 
need for less intrusive interventions.

A high proportion of psychiatric patients have a history of trauma. In one review, 90% 
of people seeking treatment for a variety of psychiatric conditions had been exposed to sig-
nificant emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse in childhood [17]. Patients with a history 
of  trauma  can  experience  re-traumatization  during  coercive  interventions  [6,  14].  Adult 
patients  report  that  experiences  of  being  restrained  brought  back  memories  of  previous 
trauma, including rape and child abuse [14]. Trauma has also been suggested to increase 
the  risk  of  being  secluded  or  restrained.  In  a  study  from  Iowa  (2011),  70%  of  the  adult 
inpatients who experienced the most instances of seclusions or restraints had experienced 
childhood abuse [18]. Another study found that children with post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) and/or a history of physical abuse had a significantly higher risk of being secluded 
or restrained in a U.S. pediatric day hospital [19].

In a previous review, Valenkamp et al. (2014) searched for empirical studies that aimed 
to  reduce  restraints/seclusions  in  child  and  adolescent  psychiatric  inpatient  units,  with  a 
pre-post  design  between  2006  and  2013  [20].  Three  articles  met  their  inclusion  criteria. 
Two of the studies evaluated Collaborative & Proactive Solutions, formerly Collaborative 
Problem  Solving  (CPS),  Ross  Greene’s  cognitive-behavioral  approach  for  working  with 
aggressive children [21, 22]. The third study covered a milieu-based comprehensive behav-
ioral  management  program,  where  the  interventions  aimed  at  changing  patient  behavior 
[23]. All studies reported reduction in the number of restraints.

The prevalence of seclusion and restraint use between 2000 and 2010 in child and ado-
lescent psychiatric settings was examined in a systematic review by De Hert et al. (2011) 
[24].  The  baseline  rates  of  seclusions  were  26%  of  patients  or  67  per  1000  patient  days, 
and  the  baseline  rates  of  restraints  were  29%  of  patients  or  42.7  per  1000  patient  days. 
Recent studies on child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units reported rates of restraint 
between 6.5 and 29% of admitted patients; 6.5% restraint, Norway [25, 26], 12% restraint 
or  seclusion,  the  U.S.  [19],  26.9%  restraint  or  seclusion,  Australia  [27],  29%  restraint  or 
seclusion,  the  U.S.  [28],  16.9%  restraint  or  seclusion,  the  U.S.  [29],  6.9%  mechanical 
restraint only, Finland [30]. A review by Beghi et al. (2013) reported a 3.8–20% prevalence 
of restraint utilization in adult psychiatric units [31].

The purpose of this review was to summarize the last 10 years of literature regarding 
methods  and  strategies  currently  used  for  reducing  seclusions  and  restraints  in  child  and 
adolescent psychiatric inpatient units.

Methods

This review began with a search of PubMed and PsycInfo for papers in English published 
between May 15th 2010 and May 15th 2020, searching for the following key words in the 
title/abstract  or  as  MeSH-terms:  “(Restraint  OR  chemical  restraint  OR  pharmacological 
restraint OR physical restraint OR mechanical restraint OR seclusion OR restraint MeSH) 

1 3110

AND (Child OR adolescent OR child MeSH OR adolescent MeSH) AND (Inpatient OR 
inpatient  MeSH)  AND  (Psychiatry  OR  psychiatric  OR  mental  OR  adolescent  psychiatry 
MeSH  OR  child  psychiatry  MeSH)”.  The  inclusion  criteria  were  published  articles  that 
described methods or strategies aimed at reducing restraint or seclusion utilization in child 
and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units, with full text articles in English. The exclusion 
criteria were unpublished material, articles focusing on adult psychiatric units, and articles 
about  other  settings  than  child  and  adolescent  psychiatric  inpatient  units,  e.g.  residential 
facilities. We also excluded articles that focused solely on pharmacological approaches to 
aggressive  behavior.  Using  an  integrative  approach,  studies  were  not  otherwise  excluded 
due to methodology (e.g. experimental or non-experimental).

We initially considered 73 abstracts in PsycInfo and 79 papers in PubMed. There was 
a  fairly  large  overlap  and  many  articles  focused  on  adults  only.  Thirteen  articles  were 
selected for our review. We also found five additional studies that met our inclusion crite-
ria, through scrutinizing the reference lists of other articles, resulting in a total of 18 papers 
in the review. Four of the articles described the same two facilities but were included since 
the evaluations in the studies were made months/years apart [32–35]. Data extracted from 
the articles included type of interventions, study design, setting, context, and outcome. The 
studies were then categorized according to identified themes.

Results

The 18 articles are described in Table 1. Studies were conducted in the U.S. (n = 15), Aus-
tralia (n = 1), New Zealand (n = 1), and Canada (n = 1). The reviewed articles displayed a 
wide range of study designs, interventions, and outcome measures, and could be divided 
into six themes or groups.

Trauma‑Informed Care

The concept of Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) emerged as an effort to address and increase 
the understanding of trauma, and the importance of identifying it early, in multiple systems 
of care [50]. Trauma-informed care seeks to understand the connection between present-
ing  symptoms/behaviors  and  the  individual’s  trauma  history  [50].  TIC  focuses  on  doing 
no further harm or reactivating past traumatic experiences, but instead on promoting heal-
ing and growth [50]. Trauma-informed care should be distinguished from trauma-specific 
treatments  (like  Trauma-Focused  Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy)  and  is  a  much  broader 
concept, aimed at transforming entire systems of care by embedding an understanding of 
traumatic  responses  at  all  levels.  Trauma-informed  care  should  be  compassionate,  non-
coercive, nonviolent, learning, and collaborative [13, 50]. Clients need to feel connected, 
valued,  informed,  and  hopeful  of  recovery.  The  connection  between  trauma  and  psycho-
pathology is understood by all staff, and staff work in mindful and empowering ways with 
individuals, families, and social services to promote and protect the autonomy of the indi-
vidual [17].

In the U.S., following  national  media reports in  1998 on  deaths and  abuses related  to 
coercive  interventions,  efforts  started  to  reduce  the  use  of  seclusions  and  restraints  [51]. 
The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) devel-
oped the Six Core Strategies, an evidence-based practice designed to prevent conflict and 
violence  and  the  use  of  seclusion  and  restraint  [17,  32,  51].  The  Six  Core  Strategies  are

Psychiatric Quarterly (2022) 93:107–136

based  on  child-centered,  trauma-informed,  and  strength-based  care,  focusing  on  primary 
prevention  principles  [32,  36].  They  include:  1)  active  leadership  towards  organizational 
change, e.g. engagement in trauma-informed principles, 2) use of data to inform practice, 
e.g.  data  collection  of  seclusions  and  restraints,  3)  workforce  development,  e.g.  trauma-
informed education of staff, 4) use of restraint/seclusion prevention tools, 5) involvement 
and inclusion of consumers at all levels of care, and 6) debriefing techniques [17, 32]. The 
Six Core Strategies have been taught throughout the U.S., showing profound results on the 
use of restraints/seclusion, and are also spreading internationally, adult units included [51].

Outcome

In  this  review,  four  papers  (but  three  facilities)  described  multi-component,  trauma-
informed initiatives [32, 33, 36, 37], of which three papers referred to the Six Core Strate-
gies described in the introduction [32, 33, 36]. Azeem et al. (2015) [33] reported a 100% 
decrease  in  mechanical  restraints  in  a  52-bed  U.S.  pediatric  psychiatric  hospital  during 
a  10-years  period  and  an  88%  decrease  in  physical  restraints  (statistical  significance  not 
mentioned).  This  facility  was  also  evaluated  in  a  previous  article  by  Azeem  et  al.  2011 
(Table 1) [32]. These articles could serve as an example of the broad variety of interven-
tions that could be included in a trauma-informed and strength-based multi-component ini-
tiative, aligning with the Six Core Strategies.

Azeem  et  al.  described  how  the  leadership  on  all  levels  supported  restraint  reduction. 
The hospital encouraged the use of verbal de-escalation techniques and a focus on primary 
prevention. The topic of restraint reduction and prevention was a standing agenda item in 
executive meetings. Every restraint was reviewed on the day following the event. Use of 
the mechanical restraint bed was prohibited unless both the physician and the supervising 
nurse  were  present  at  the  unit.  The  unit  collected  data,  such  as  the  number  of  restraints 
per  month,  average  time  in  restraints,  number  of  youths  involved  in  these  interventions, 
injuries to staff/youth, etc. These data were shared with staff and leadership. All staff were 
offered  education  on  trauma-informed  care.  Training  initiatives  were  also  undertaken  for 
staff  to  learn  and  implement  the  principles  of  DBT,  Attachment  Regulation  and  Compe-
tency (ARC) framework, and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

A  team  was  set  up  to  immediately  support  staff  who  were  assaulted  or  traumatized. 
There were also regular team building activities, health education opportunities, and yoga 
groups to support staff. Families were welcome to visit the hospital before the arrival of a 
youth to tour the facility. Individualized treatment plans were drawn up with individualized 
goals, triggers, early warning signs, coping tools, safety plans, interests/hobbies, skills, etc. 
Staff  were  informed  about  the  youth’s  trauma  history  and  family  dynamics.  An  occupa-
tional therapy consultant was utilized to assess the sensory needs of the youths, offering 
appropriate tools, like sensory brushes or weighted blankets. The unit offered sports and 
recreational activities like music therapy, art or cooking, and staff worked closely with the 
youths to build skills. A special team was set up with members particularly skilled at con-
flict  resolution  and  de-escalation  techniques,  to  be  dispatched  when  necessary.  The  unit 
implemented debriefing both immediately after a restraint event and in complex situations 
again after a few days, for problem solving and planning. The hospital also implemented 
different youth and family activities to enhance their participation at the facility [33].

In the other trauma-informed initiatives, statistically significant reduction in seclusions 
and restraints was reported by Wisdom et al. (2015) [36] in three New York-based facili-
ties (patients up to 17 years old), after implementation of the Six Core Strategies (Table 1).

Regan et al. (2017) [37] described the implementation of Child and Family Centered Care 
(CFCC) in a U.S. inpatient unit for children 2–12 years old, where a trauma-sensitive per-
spective was a part of the initiative, as well as CPS (see below).

CPS and CFCC

CPS is a psychosocial treatment model for behaviorally challenging youths, based on the 
assumption that “children do well if they can” [52]. The method was developed by Ross 
Greene, PhD, and conceptualizes challenging behavior as the byproduct of lagging cogni-
tive skills, particularly in the domains of flexibility/adaptability, frustration tolerance, and 
problem solving [21, 52]. In CPS, children’s challenging behaviors are said to appear when 
the  expectations  placed  on  the  child  outstrip  the  child’s  skills  [52].  Behavior  -  whether 
crying, withdrawing, screaming, hitting, biting - is simply the means by which a child com-
municates that there is incompatibility between expectations and skills. The model involves 
engaging  caregivers  in  the  process  of  identifying  a  child’s  lagging  skills  and  unsolved 
problems, and helping caregivers and youths solve those problems collaboratively and pro-
actively [52].

According to Regan et al. [37], CFCC is a philosophy of care, based on treating people 
with  dignity  and  respect,  sharing  information  with  patients/families,  supporting  them  to 
build  on  their  strengths  and  independence  and  to  collaborate  in  policy/program  develop-
ment. CFCC recognizes that parents themselves need emotional support and acknowledges 
that a child’s hospitalization is a stressful event in the life of a family. The development of 
trust is a primary component, and the re-traumatizing potential of procedures must be con-
sidered. Evoking feelings of victimization and powerlessness runs counter to the goals of 
CFCC, which instead promote a nurturing, collaborative approach.

Outcome

Four units implemented CPS, either as a separate intervention [38], or as part of a multi-
component  initiative  [37,  39,  40].  Ercole-Fricke  et  al.  (2016)  [38]  evaluated  a  slightly 
modified CPS approach in a U.S. adolescent emergency psychiatric inpatient unit, patients 
12–17  years  old.  The  5-year  study  showed  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  punitive 
strategies  and  techniques,  such  as  a  room  restriction  procedure  (Table  1).  Restraint  epi-
sodes  were  already  low  according  to  the  authors.  and  continued  to  trend  downward  (not 
statistically significant).

Sams et al. (2016) [39] evaluated CPS as a part of a multi-component initiative towards 
strength-based care in a U.S. child and adolescent inpatient unit, patients 5–18 years old. 
According  to  the  authors,  strength-based  care  is  founded  on  the  premise  that  a  person’s 
skills,  interests,  and  support  systems  are  vital  to  developing  an  effective  treatment  plan. 
Implementing CPS and strength-based care led to a 75% reduction in total hours of seclu-
sion  and  restraint  over  the  course  of  1  year  (statistical  significance  not  mentioned).  The 
initiative  also  included  interventions  such  as  a  mindfulness  group  for  adolescents,  DBT-
group, animal assisted therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Patients 
and families reported overall improvement in satisfaction, perception of safety on the unit, 
helpfulness of group therapy, and involvement in decisions regarding their care. The unit 
also showed the hospital’s highest staff engagement and satisfaction level.

As noted in the section about Trauma-Informed Care, Regan et al. (2017) [37] included 
CPS in their CFCC initiative. After the implementation, the unit reported no mechanical 

1 3124

Psychiatric Quarterly (2022) 93:107–136

restraints since 2001, no locked-door seclusions or chemical restraints since 2002, marked 
reduction  in  physical  holds  (under  5  min)  from  over  100  per  month  to  less  than  10  per 
month, significant decrease in staff and patient injuries (p value not mentioned), reduced 
staff turnover, and increased job satisfaction.

Weldon  Bonnell  et  al.  (2014)  [40]  studied  an  inpatient  psychiatric  facility  in  Canada, 
patients’  mean  age  14–15  years.  External  reviewers  had  assessed  the  unit  due  to  marked 
escalation in physical aggression, constant observation, security, and staff sick leave. As a 
consequence of this, the unit implemented CPS, together with debriefing sessions, repre-
sentation of multidisciplinary team members, and restructuring of unit staffing. The study 
reported  statistically  significant  decrease  in  constant  observation  each  month.  There  was 
also a decrease in incidents (verbal or physical aggression, errors by staff and accidents), 
sick leave, security, and seclusion, but these results were not statistically significant. How 
CPS was implemented is not outlined in the article, except from staff learning and practic-
ing the model.

Behavioral Management Programs

Behavioral  management  is  a  general  category  of  interventions,  grounded  in  social  learn-
ing theory and applied behavior analysis. According to social learning theory, people learn 
within a social context, primarily by observing and imitating the actions of others. Learn-
ing  is  also  influenced  by  being  rewarded  or  punished  for  particular  behaviors.  The  gen-
eral aim is to reduce the  child’s  expression  of  problem behavior,  increase the  expression 
of prosocial behavior, increase the ability to relate to others, and thereby increase overall 
wellbeing [53].

However, point and  level systems, which  are  integral parts of  behavioral  modification 
programs, have been criticized for being counterproductive and sometimes even destruc-
tive or punitive in psychiatric milieus, and not considering the child’s capacity to exhibit 
certain behaviors [54]. Some articles in the review describe going from a behavior manage-
ment program to another intervention [37–39]. These authors express that the traditional 
behavioral approach with rewards and consequences based on patients’ behavior often led 
to  increased  conflicts  between  patients  and  staff  [39]  or  frustration  and  exacerbated  epi-
sodes of acting-out behavior [38] and that the staff was seen as “rule-enforcers” and “point-
tallyers”, feeling undervalued and unappreciated [37].

There is no universal ‘BMP’ – different behavioral programs include different compo-
nents or treatment ingredients. As mentioned in the introduction, a previous study reported 
significant restraint reduction following the implementation of a comprehensive behavioral 
management program in a child and adolescent inpatient unit [23].

Three types of Behavioral Management were used in three different reviewed articles: 
Modified Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (M-PBIS) [41], Behavior Modifi-
cation Program (BMP) [42], and “behavioral modification plans” [43]:

1.  The M-PBIS involved a three-tier approach: 1) Universal interventions, such as estab-
lishing staff commitment, a defined set of positively worded expectations and descrip-
tions of how to meet these expectations, reward system for positive behavior, 5:1 positive 
to negative adult-child interaction ratio, feedback to staff. 2) Targeted problem-solving 
conversations with selected patients. 3) Functional behavior assessments and individual-
ized behavior plans for a small minority of patients who continued to have problematic 
behavior after problem-solving conversations [41]

1 3Psychiatric Quarterly (2022) 93:107–136

125

2.  The BMP was modeled for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and included a points system, social reinforce-
ment, time-out, and parent training [42].

3.  The behavioral modification plans addressed issues like problem behavior, replacement 

behavior, positive rewards, and negative consequences [43].

Outcome

Reynolds et al. (2016) [41] studied  the use  of  M-PBIS  in  a  psychiatric inpatient unit for 
high-risk  youths.  There  was  a  significant  decrease  in  mean  seclusion  rate,  percentage 
of  patients  placed  in  seclusion  or  restraint,  mean  duration  of  seclusion  or  restraint,  and 
percentage of patients who received any PRN, i.e. pro re nata or as needed medications. 
(Table 1).

Carlson et al. (2020) [42] studied the effects of discontinuing the use of a BMP in an 
inpatient unit for children aged 5–12. The authors reported that the subsequent intervention 
after discontinuation of the BMP focused on talking the child down or distracting him/her 
from intensely emotional situations so that restrictive interventions would not be needed. 
Coping skills were still taught and the points system remained but no limits were set, and 
the  new  intervention  did  not  provide  a  comprehensive  treatment  approach  with  an  evi-
dence-based theoretical framework. Five cohorts of children were studied over a 10-years 
period. Significantly more children had events of seclusions/restraints/physical holds when 
BMP was absent. Agitation (measured by PRN use) increased after the discontinuation of 
BMP.  (Table  1)  The  authors  mention  that  during  the  BMP-present  period,  time-outs  and 
“the quiet room” (open-door seclusion) were used, neither of which counted as a seclusion. 
This might have introduced some degree of bias, artificially reducing the use of seclusions/
restraints/physical holds during the BMP-present period.

Eblin  (2019)  [43]  evaluated  the  implementation  of  a  decision-making  algorithm  for 
initiation of seclusions or restraints, behavioral modification plans for patients at risk for 
seclusions or restraints, and a patient-debriefing tool to be used after a restrictive episode 
in  an  inpatient  behavioral  health  unit  for  children  aged  6–17.  Post-implementation,  data 
was collected over a 3-month period and showed a 55% decrease in the total seclusion and 
restraint rate compared to preintervention data (statistical significance not mentioned). The 
data also showed an overall 29% decline in total time spent in seclusion and restraint, per 
episode. (Table 1).

Smaller Interventions (Sensory Rooms, MBSR, Milieu Nurses)

Sensory Rooms

A sensory room, sometimes called comfort room or Snoezelen, is a space that contains a 
variety of tools used to stimulate the senses, e.g. fidget tools, weighted blankets, colored 
lights, or relaxing music [44]. The aim of a sensory room is to help patients self-regulate, 
particularly  at  times  of  escalation  in  anxiety  and/or  aggression,  and  to  offer  a  safe  space 
for  a  distressed  patient  to  decompress  while  preserving  autonomy  [44].  Three  studies  in 
the review evaluated sensory rooms as a stand-alone intervention [44–46]. Sensory rooms 
or sensory tools provided by an occupational therapist were also included in some trauma-
informed, multi-component initiatives [32, 33, 36]. In the three studies evaluating sensory 
rooms only, the implementation included educating and training staff in the theory behind 

1 3126

Psychiatric Quarterly (2022) 93:107–136

sensory  modulation,  how  to  conduct  a  sensory  room  session,  and  how  to  decide  which 
patients might need it and also remain safe in the room [44–46]. One session was designed 
as a 1:1 patient-staff intervention.

Outcome

Seckman et al. (2017) [44] studied a U.S. inpatient unit for adolescents aged 12–17 with 
emotional  and  behavioral  disorders,  measuring  seclusion/restraint  rate  6  months  pre/post 
sensory room initiation. Statistical significance was not reported, but the results suggested 
a  reduction  in  the  incidents  of  restraint  (26.5%)  and  seclusion  (32.8%)  and  reduced  fre-
quency of patient aggression (Table 1). However, the duration of seclusions and restraints 
increased,  something  the  authors  suggested  might  be  attributed  to  a  few  patients  being 
“high users”.

West et al. (2017) [45] studied an Australian inpatient unit for adolescents 12–18 years 
old, comparing 56 sensory room users and 56 non-users. The results showed statistically 
significant distress reduction following sensory room use and the greatest reduction among 
adolescents with a history of aggression. There was no significant difference in seclusion 
rates.  Female  gender  and  having  an  anxiety  disorder  were  associated  with  sensory  room 
use.

Bobier et al. (2015) [46] studied a child and adolescent inpatient unit in New Zealand, 
with patients up to 18 years old. The study was a pilot investigation introducing a sensory 
room in the unit. Patients used the room for both activation and deactivation, with statisti-
cally significant effect. There was a statistically significant decrease in seclusion episodes 
6 months before vs 6 months after the introduction of sensory rooms, and a slight decrease 
in full restraint episodes, but not statistically significant. There was a statistically signifi-
cant increase in partial restraints. (The authors’ definition of partial vs full restraint was not 
included in the article.)

Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction

In a review of ecological factors affecting inpatient psychiatric unit violence, Hamrin et al. 
(2009)  described  how  violence  on  an  inpatient  unit  resulted  from  a  multitude  of  factors, 
including  complex  interactions  among  patients,  staff,  and  the  culture  of  the  specific  unit 
[55]. Staff who demonstrated compassionate attitudes toward patients, gave of themselves, 
showed empathy for patients’ suffering, related authentically to patients, and treated them 
with dignity and respect had fewer violent encounters [55]. In addition, nurses who were 
attuned  to  patient’s  fears  and  interactions  with  other  people  had  an  opportunity  for  early 
intervention  if  they  observed  intrusive  and  threatening  behavior,  and  could  respond  in  a 
violence-lessening  way  to  patients  [55].  Thus,  it  is  likely  that  interventions  that  enhance 
the  staffs’  listening  skills  and  presence  are  important  in  creating  a  safer  environment  for 
patients and staff [47]. Being truly present with patients has also been reported to improve 
staff’s ability to provide good care [56].

Mindfulness  Based  Stress  Reduction  (MBSR)  is  a  structured  therapy  package,  rooted 
in  Theravada  Buddhism  and  westernized  by  Jon  Kabat-Zinn  at  the  University  of  Massa-
chusetts Medical Center in 1979 [56]. MBSR combines mindfulness-based meditation and 
Hatha yoga, and includes exercises like body scanning, meditation, and gentle yoga pos-
tures. According to a literature review by Praissman (2006) focusing on adults, MBSR is 

1 3Psychiatric Quarterly (2022) 93:107–136

127

an  effective  treatment  for  reducing  stress  and  anxiety  for  patients,  as  well  as  healthcare 
providers [56].

Outcome

In the present review, Hallman et al. (2014) [47] evaluated the implementation of a brief 
MBSR  training  program,  8  days  instead  of  the  traditional  8  weeks,  for  interprofessional 
staff in a U.S. child and adolescent psychiatric acute care unit. The aim was stress reduc-
tion and increased unit safety. Two months after the MBSR training period, there was sta-
tistically significant stress reduction and increased mindfulness among staff. The increase 
in mindfulness was seen immediately after the 8-day training period. There was also a pos-
itive trend towards increased patient and staff safety with a decreased number of staff call-
ins, decreased need for 1:1 staffing episodes, and decreased restraint use 2 onths after the 
training period (significance not reported). (Table 1).

Milieu Nurses

Creating clearer staff roles can have a positive influence on psychiatric violence [55]. Rae 
Magnowski  and  Cleveland  (2020)  [48]  described  how  an  inpatient  child  and  adolescent 
psychiatric  unit,  patients  5–18  years  old,  with  no  additional  resources  or  costs,  managed 
to reduce monthly restraint rates through the implementation of “milieu nurse-client shift 
assignments”,  compared  with  individual  nurse-client  shift  assignments.  The  intervention 
was  an  innovative  change  in  nurse  staffing  structures.  Instead  of  dividing  up  clients  and 
tasks equally among all nurses without regard to client acuity, the nurses were assigned the 
role as a “task nurse” or a “milieu nurse”. The “task nurse” was responsible for administer-
ing  scheduled  medications  and  conducting  client  check  ins/safety  checks,  while  the  two 
“milieu  nurses”  were  responsible  for  providing  an  environment  of  structure,  safety,  con-
sistency and empathy, as well as administering PRN medications and executing/updating 
client treatment plans.

Outcome

The milieu nurse-client shift assignment enabled early intervention and de-escalation of sit-
uations with clients who displayed aggressive behaviors. The individual nurse-client shift 
assignments (the control variable) focused on meeting individual client needs, whereas the 
milieu nurses focused on the needs of the group as a whole. There was a statistically sig-
nificant decrease in average monthly restraint rate during the intervention, from 72.9 to 7.5 
restraints per 1000 client days [48].

Autism Spectrum Disorder Care Pathway

According to Kuriakose et al. [35], the Autism Spectrum Disorder Care Pathway (ASD-CP) 
was developed as an approach to improving care in psychiatric units through autism-specific 
intervention strategies. Individuals with autism may have limited ability to communicate their 
symptoms, due to difficulties with social communication or intellectual deficits. They are also 
typically  hospitalized  for  externalizing  problem  behavior,  such  as  aggression  or  self-injury. 
Without  sufficient  understanding  and  clinical  experience  of  autism  in  psychiatric  units,  this 
can lead to an increased risk of harm for both patients and staff. This in turn can increase the 

1 3128

Psychiatric Quarterly (2022) 93:107–136

risk of inappropriate crisis intervention, like seclusions, restraints, or PRN medication admin-
istration [35].

The ASD-CP in the study by Kuriakose et al. emphasized input from caregivers regarding 
communication skills, early warning signs of agitation, and activity/item preferences. It also 
included implementing a structured schedule with extensive use of visual supports, teaching 
patient coping skills, and training staff in the features of ASD [35].

Outcome

Kuriakose et al. (2018) implemented the ASD-CP in a public hospital child psychiatric ser-
vice,  patients  4–17  years  old  [35].  The  proportion  of  children  experiencing  a  hold/restraint 
was significantly smaller after the ASD-CP initiation. The number of holds/restraints, intra-
muscular medication administrations delivered, and the length of stay trended downward (not 
significant). These results were described as clinically relevant. The stability of the results was 
later evaluated by Cervantes et al. (2019) [34]. (Table 1).

Dialectical Behavior Therapy

Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT)  is  an  evidence-based  treatment  that  directly  addresses 
suicidal behavior and self-injury [49]. Tebbett-Mock et al. (2020) [49] evaluated DBT versus 
treatment as usual (TAU) in a U.S. acute-care psychiatric inpatient unit for adolescents (age 
12–17). The DBT milieu treatment in the study included: DBT coaching, a token economy 
including an egregious (outside limits of the unit) behavior protocol requiring chain and solu-
tion analyses for egregious behaviors on the unit, therapeutic environment, resources for use 
of coping skills, DBT vocabulary, DBT skills groups (focusing on Mindfulness, Distress Tol-
erance, Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness and Middle Path), additional thera-
peutic and leisure groups (e.g. pottery making or pet therapy), and intensive psychotherapy, 
including both individual and family/collateral therapy sessions.

TAU consisted of milieu treatment comprising a token economy system, cognitive-behav-
ioral therapy, skills groups, activity groups focused on general coping skills and mental health 
wellness,  and  intensive  individual  and  family/collateral  psychotherapy.  Treatment  provided 
was  cognitive-behavioral  therapy,  family  systems,  psychoeducational,  and/or  supportive  in 
nature [49].

Outcome

Patients who received DBT had significantly fewer constant observation hours for self-injury, 
incidents  of  suicide  attempts  and  self-injury,  restraints,  and  days  hospitalized  compared  to 
patients who received TAU. No statistically significant differences were found for seclusions 
or constant observation hours for aggression, incidents of aggression toward patients or staff, 
or readmissions [49].

Discussion

Coercive  measures  in  psychiatric  care  are  controversial  and  have  the  potential  to  cause 
injuries, feelings of victimization, re-traumatization, and PTSD [6, 10]. It is therefore par-
amount  that  psychiatric  units  implement  preventive  measures.  The  present  review  of  18 
papers  published  in  the  recent  decade  identified  a  number  of  methods  used  in  child  and 
adolescent  psychiatric  inpatient  care  to  reduce  the  use  of  coercive  measures.  Although  a 
variety of theoretical backgrounds were seen, common mediating factors could be observed 
in many of the studies.

First,  on  an  organizational  level,  the  units  agreed  upon  a  specific  method  and  imple-
mented it systematically. The management and staff shared the same aim, ethical and theo-
retical framework, and most of the studies described a positive attitude towards change and 
learning  new  skills.  Education  of  staff  ensured  that  they  had  the  competence  needed  for 
their work. All studies collected data, but only two methods involved sharing data regularly 
with staff to motivate change [32, 36, 41]. One article provided a cost-savings analysis [49] 
and some studies briefly mentioned the program costs, e.g. “compensation for a 50% psy-
chologist” [41] or “no additional resources” [48], but most of the studies did not provide a 
cost analysis.

Second, at a clinical level, all methods included preventive efforts, e.g. early interven-
tions, de-escalation techniques or safety plans. Most interventions were aimed at improving 
communication skills and affect regulation [32, 33, 35–47, 49], several encouraged patients 
and  parents  to  be  involved  in  the  care  [33,  35–37,  39,  44–46],  some  included  debriefing 
after a coercive intervention [32, 33, 36, 43] or interventions promoting the wellbeing of 
staff  [33,  39,  47,  49].  Behavior  was  often  viewed  as  a  consequence  of  some  factor,  e.g. 
trauma (TIC), lagging skills (CPS), difficulties with emotion regulation (DBT) or autism 
(ASD-CP).  Although  all  methods  aimed  to  reduce  the  use  of  coercive  measures,  many 
studies  had  other  variables  as  their  primary  target,  e.g.  suicidal  ideation  [49],  distress 
reduction [45–47], number of PRNs given for agitation [42], or improved care for children 
with autism [35]. The Six Core Strategies was presumably the method with the most direct 
and broad focus on restraint reduction, but the studies on CPS, CFCC, M-PBIS and “the 
milieu  nurse  client-shift  assignment”  also  aimed  directly  at  reducing  the  use  of  coercive 
measures.

The material could be divided into six groups or themes: TIC, CFCC and CPS, BMP, 
smaller interventions, ASD-CP, and DBT. The purpose was to provide insight into the dif-
ferent theoretical backgrounds. The distinction between the first two groups was whether 
trauma  was  an  essential  part  of  the  method  or  not.  Apart  from  that,  the  interventions  in 
both  groups  were  multi-modal  and  shared  core  values,  e.g.  collaboration  and  a  compas-
sionate, child-centered care. The Six Core Strategies and CPS were evidence-based meth-
ods, whereas TIC, CFCC, and strength-based care were more frameworks or philosophies 
of care. The third group consisted of methods building on behavioral management, but the 
M-PBIS  was  the  only  full  BMP  being  implemented  and  evaluated  systematically.  BMPs 
in general and the “point and level system” in particular, have been problematized for not 
taking  patients’  skills  at  performing  certain  behaviors  into  account,  potentially  resulting 
in a negative dynamic between staff and patient [54]. The M-PBIS included several ingre-
dients that possibly reduced the risk of these negative side-effects, such as a 5:1 positive 
to negative adult-to-child interaction ratio, regular feedback to staff, weekly staff training 
sessions, and individualized plans for certain individuals [41]. The fourth group consisted 
of smaller interventions: MBSR aiming at reducing perceived levels of staff stress by an

increase in mindfulness, sensory rooms aiming at reducing patient distress, and the milieu 
nurse-client shift assignment attempting to reduce restraint rates through a change in nurse 
staffing structures. The last two groups were more specific to the needs of certain groups 
of  patients:  the  ASD-CP  seeking  to  improve  care  for  patients  with  autism  in  psychiatric 
units  and  the  DBT  primarily  focusing  on  decreasing  suicidal  ideation,  self-injury,  and 
aggression.

Comparing the efficacy of the interventions is challenging, due to the heterogeneity of 
study designs and outcome measures. It is also difficult to determine whether some com-
ponents in the methods were more critical to the outcome than others. The mere fact that a 
unit put restraint reduction on the agenda and agreed upon a method could have an impact. 
With that said, it appears as if the larger collaborative and trauma-informed interventions 
like  the  Six  Core  Strategies  [32,  33,  36]  and  CPS  in  combination  with  either  CFCC  or 
strength-based care [37, 39] showed the most prominent results. Interestingly, these stud-
ies  reported  the  strongest  support  from  their  leadership  and  had  restraint  reduction  as  a 
primary  target.  These  methods  also  acknowledged  psychiatric  inpatient  violence  as  a 
complex phenomenon that must be viewed in a context, as a result of interactions among 
patients, staff, and the unit culture [55]. Apart from reducing the use of coercive measures, 
the methods increased job satisfaction [37, 39], reduced staff turnover [37, 38], increased 
satisfaction among patients and families, and led to an increase in overall creativity in the 
unit [39]. Two of these initiatives [33, 37] had been in place for many years and reported a 
complete and lasting elimination of mechanical restraints, which is often seen as the most 
distressing  coercive  measure.  However,  most  studies  reported  a  reduction  in  the  use  of 
seclusion or restraint and the methods could be considered, depending on the needs of the 
unit [35, 38, 40–43, 47, 49]. The only exception were the studies on sensory rooms, which 
showed mixed results [44–46].

For  a  unit  with  strong  resources  seeking  to  reduce  the  use  of  coercive  measures,  all 
interventions  in  group  1–2  seem  to  be  good  options,  e.g.  TIC,  Six  Core  Strategies, 
strength-based care, CFCC, and CPS. Since the Six Core Strategies and CPS were the only 
evidence-based methods while the others represented philosophies of care, they are prob-
ably preferable and easier to implement. Behavioral management also seems to be effective 
in reducing the use of coercive measures, and for units preferring this, M-PBIS could be an 
option. For units with a smaller budget, the “milieu nurse-client shift assignment” exempli-
fies an inexpensive intervention, which also seemed to be effective and could be a candi-
date for further studies [48].

Six Core Strategies, CPS and behavioral management have also been evaluated in pre-
vious research. CPS resulted in a 99% reduction in the number of restraint episodes in a 
psychiatric unit for children aged 3–14 [21], and a significant reduction in restraints (97%, 
p < .001) and seclusions (69%, p < .001) in a psychiatric unit for children aged 4–12 [22]. 
CPS has been shown to be effective in many different settings, summarized in a review by 
Greene et al. [52], including one randomized control trial examining the efficacy of CPS 
in treating patients with ODD [57]. The Six Core Strategies have shown statistically sig-
nificant reduction in the use of restraint and seclusion in the U.S. and internationally, adult 
units included [51, 58, 59]. Finally, a behavioral management program implemented in a 
psychiatric facility for children and adolescents age 4–18 resulted in a significant decrease 
in the number of restraints [23].

Implementing new interventions can be a challenge, calling for an extended and inclu-
sive  decision-making  process  based  on  principles  of  a  learning  organization,  shared 
visions,  and  team  learning  to  make  it  possible  [60].  Processes  like  these  are  often  slow 
and  organic,  involving  many  individuals  who  need  to  prioritize  the  same  goals  and  start 

1 3Psychiatric Quarterly (2022) 93:107–136

moving in the same direction. Wisdom et al. noted that the Six Core Strategies were not 
“golden keys”; successful implementation required major and continuous commitment on 
all levels, collaboration and a willingness to learn [36]. Similar factors were found to be 
important  when  implementing  TIC  in  child  and  adolescent  units,  e.g.  commitment  from 
leadership,  sufficient  staff  support,  family  involvement,  aligning  policies  with  the  princi-
ples of TIC, and continuous evaluations to motivate change [61].

Several  of  the  findings  in  the  present  review  could  also  be  put  in  the  context  of  salu-
togenesis. Antonovsky, the founder of the theory, argued that pervasive stressors are inevi-
table in life, and what promotes health is our ability to experience life as comprehensive, 
manageable  and  meaningful,  the  cornerstones  of  his  concept  Sense  of  Coherence  (SOC) 
[62]. Adolescents admitted to psychiatric inpatient care are often traumatized, come from 
poor socioeconomic backgrounds, and describe a dysfunctional family situation indicating 
a weak SOC.

We believe that many of the methods in the present review can have a positive impact on 
the patients’ SOC. TIC strives to increase their understanding of the connection between 
past trauma and current symptoms. CPS helps the patient to feel understood in challenging 
situations. BMP places emphasis on social learning and behavioral analysis. These meth-
ods are likely to strengthen the comprehensive component of SOC. TIC also teaches con-
flict resolution and de-escalation techniques. In CPS, cognitive skills and problem-solving 
techniques are taught, in BMP different reward systems are practiced, increasing the man-
ageability component of SOC. Several of the reported methods in the present review e.g. 
CPS, CFCC, TIC and MBSR, may also strengthen the staff’s experience of comprehensi-
bility and manageability. Linked to the comprehensibility and manageability components 
of  SOC  is  the  concept  of  locus  of  control  (LOC).  Feeling  control  over  one’s  life  events 
is  referred  to  as  internal  LOC;  conversely,  when  feeling  that  chance,  luck,  fate,  or  pow-
erful  others  are  in  charge,  LOC  is  considered  more  external  [63].  Psychiatric  symptoms 
and  adverse  life-events  are  associated  with  external  LOC  [64]  while  patients  with  lower 
levels of psychiatric symptoms present more internal LOC [62]. Several of the measures in 
the present review, e.g. TIC, CPS, DBT and BMP, focus on manageable problem-solving 
methods  that  can  probably  increase  the  patient’s  internal  LOC.  Through  increased  SOC 
and LOC among both patients and staff, conditions are likely to be created for a care envi-
ronment with fewer coercive measures.

There was a clear dominance of articles of U.S. origin in this review. Some studies from 
other  countries,  such  as  Norway  [25,  26],  Finland  [9,  30]  and  Israel  [12],  covered  other 
aspects of the subject, e.g. prevalence, characteristics of patients frequently restrained, or 
patients’ attitudes towards restrictive measures, but none of these studies met our inclusion 
criteria. We also excluded non-English language articles. An assumption could be that the 
issue of restraint has been of greater concern in the U.S. Even though comparing practices 
between countries is challenging, the lack of studies from other parts of the world is diffi-
cult to explain, and more research in this field has been called for [20, 24, 65].

Psychiatric  care  in  child  and  adolescent  inpatient  units  should  always  strive  to  be  as 
respectful and empowering as possible, maintaining a safe and trustful environment, while 
respecting the child’s integrity. This implies keeping interventions that have the power to 
leave patients feeling shameful, angry, or victimized to a minimum. However, there might 
always  be  situations  when  a  restrictive  intervention  is  unavoidable,  and  the  only  way  to 
protect a child or adolescent in a psychiatric unit from hurting him/herself or others. Con-
sidering the possible negative consequences of such interventions, they can only be ethi-
cally defendable if psychiatric organizations work continuously and systematically to pre-
vent them. This review shows that effective and lasting restraint reduction is possible and 

1 3132

that  it  can  be  combined  with  and  achieved  through  a  child-centered,  compassionate,  and 
empowering psychiatric care.

Limitations

There was a wide range of study designs in the present review, and four papers were of a 
more descriptive character. Some authors labelled the method and the implementation pro-
cess in detail, others more briefly. There was a lack of controls and not necessarily causal 
effect.  The  intervention  components  that  were  most  instrumental  in  achieving  outcomes 
could not be identified. Because of the design heterogeneity we did not use a scoring sys-
tem  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  the  included  studies,  which  is  a  limitation.  The  findings 
should be seen as trends rather than generalizable results, due to the different quality of the 
studies and various age spans and characteristics of the patients. A majority of the articles 
were of U.S. origin, which might affect the generalizability. The generalizability was also 
challenged by the lack of standards when it comes to the definition of restraint and how to 
report the results.

Strengths

The present review is based on a systematic search identifying the most recent studies on 
how to reduce the use of coercive measures in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient 
care, involving 18 studies published in the last decade. To our knowledge, the last review 
in the field covered three articles published 2006–2013 [20]. Since this is a subject where 
important  research  might  be  done  in  the  form  of  smaller  studies  or  quality  improvement 
projects, our decision to include all types of study designs adds to previous reviews with an 
updated and broad description of the field.

Research Implications

This article shows that reducing the use of restraints and seclusions is possible and should 
be prioritized. To facilitate comparisons, future models should evaluate different standard-
ized parameters, including patient satisfaction.
