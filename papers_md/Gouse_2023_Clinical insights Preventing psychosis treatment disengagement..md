Abstract

Many patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders disengage from treatment, with negative 
impacts on prognosis and recovery. This commentary provides an overview of common reasons 
underlying treatment dropout and strategies for overcoming obstacles and enhancing patient 
engagement. Basic clinical skills such as open-ended questions and reflective listening can be 
powerful tools in unmasking structural and attitudinal barriers to psychosis care.

Keywords

Treatment; Engagement; Dropout; Psychotherapy; Clozapine; Motivational interviewing

Disengagement from psychosis care is common, with one-third of individuals living with 
a schizophrenia spectrum disorder disengaging from outpatient treatment over the course 
of illness (Kreyenbuhl et al., 2009; Solmi et al., 2018; Doyle et al., 2014). Many patients 
stop attending treatment unexpectedly, some even shortly after initial evaluation. Treatment 
interruptions in outpatient care, especially those early in the course of psychotic illness, can 
negatively impact prognosis and long-term functioning (Turner et al., 2009).

To provide recovery-oriented care and shorten the duration of untreated psychosis, we 
must improve the quality and acceptability of our intervention while also thoughtfully 
engaging reluctant patients in treatment. This thoughtfulness begins with curiosity: why is 
this individual reluctant to seek or continue psychiatric care? Below are some reasons why 
many individuals may avoid, discontinue, or engage only sporadically with treatment, along 
with potential strategies for promoting engagement in each situation.

1.  Direct interference of symptoms

The positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms that are hallmarks of schizophrenia 
spectrum disorders (SSD) (Kahn et al., 2015) can interfere with sustained engagement in 
treatment across care settings. Among the most common is lack of insight into illness (or 
anosognosia) (Buckley et al., 2007). An individual’s level of insight may fluctuate over the 
disease course (Brown et al., 2020). During periods of limited insight, a lack of perceived 
need to engage in care can be a barrier to ongoing treatment. Lack of motivation (avolition), 
emotional blunting, and other negative symptoms may impede care engagement. Further, the 
severity and nature of an individual’s positive symptoms may directly impact engagement in 
care. For example, paranoia involving the treatment team may make it difficult for a patient 
to trust providers or the larger mental health system. Finally, both marked disorganized 
thinking, and cognitive deficits (e.g., difficulties with planning and prioritizing tasks) may 
make the logistics needed to attend appointments in-person or over telehealth exceptionally 
difficult for many patients without a high level of social support.

1.1.  Suggested strategies to mitigate the impact of symptoms on engagement in care

Solutions for positive symptoms often depend on the nature of the delusion or other 
symptoms. Often the best course is not to challenge patients directly around delusional 
content. Instead, it can be helpful to offer empathy and leverage open-ended questions 
to find a middle ground that you and the patient can align around (e.g., reframing 
treatment goals as decreasing time spent thinking about distressing thoughts or managing 
the dysphoria that they cause rather than eradicating them). For patients with limited 
insight and marked negative symptoms, open-ended questions, reflective listening, and other 
motivational interviewing techniques can also help build rapport and define treatment goals. 
For example, asking patients about what in their lives could be improved (e.g., loneliness 
and unemployment) can be more productive than insisting that patients learn and use terms 
such as “delusions” to describe their symptoms. Connecting patients limited insight to 
individual or group peer support can also be a powerful strategy to aid in defining mutual 
treatment goals and fostering trust in care. For patients with highly disorganized thinking 
or cognitive symptoms, a clear, concise, and multifaceted approach to communication (e.g., 
using both written and verbal directions) can be helpful. Additionally, encouraging family 
involvement and specialized services such as case management can be paramount to helping 
patients with significant cognitive symptoms or disorganized thinking.

2.  Structural barriers

Many risk factors for the development of an SSD are associated with early and persistent 
socioeconomic adversity (Radua et al., 2018). Additionally, the onset of a psychotic disorder 
can very often derail academic attainment and interfere with occupational functioning, 
resulting in socioeconomic disadvantage (Lin et al., 2022). As a result, many of our patients 
disengage from outpatient care due to structural barriers. For example, parking and public 
transportation costs may make attending appointments difficult. Many patients may also not 
have a reliable connection to the internet or the technological means to attend telehealth

appointments. Many patients may be uninsured or underinsured, which may cause them to 
ration appointments or medications to meet their basic needs.

2.1.  Suggested strategies to reduce structural barriers to care

Prioritize asking patients about any obstacles they foresee to accessing outpatient care 
and be ready to problem solve during visits. Ask directly about access to food, safe 
housing, and the ability to meet other basic needs. Leverage the expertise of colleagues 
in resource social work and case management where available. Treatment teams can also 
work together to compile commonly used community resources such as local transportation 
assistance, prescription vouchers, subsidized internet services, and other supports to mitigate 
the socioeconomic disadvantage faced by many of our patients living with an SSD.

3. 

Impact of culture on help-seeking and trust in psychiatry

Cultural factors can impact patient engagement in psychosis care in a multitude of ways. 
Cross-culturally, individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups have experienced 
persistent discrimination on a societal level and, more specifically, within the mental 
healthcare system (Harnett and Ressler, 2021). A climate in which discrimination is 
normalized or historically entrenched can impact patient expectations and negatively affect 
patient-provider relationships and healthcare utilization (Benkert et al., 2006). Further, 
perceived public, family, and self-stigma can all negatively impact help-seeking behavior 
(Clement et al., 2015). Concerns about stigma and privacy may lead patients and families 
to prefer help from informal supports (e.g. family, friends, and religious leaders) over 
formalized medical institutions (Aggarwal et al., 2020). Lastly, the majority of psychosocial 
interventions for psychosis is designed and studied in Western cultures and may have limited 
face validity for patients outside of this context (Degnan et al., 2018).

3.1.  Potential strategies to improve psychosis care across cultures

On an individual provider level, humility, empathy, perspective-taking, and consistency are 
foundational strategies for providers to work to build trust. Incorporating elements of the 
Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) from the DSM-5 in initial psychiatric evaluations and 
throughout subsequent visits may increase engagement in psychosis care (Aggarwal et al., 
2020). Across treatment settings, the CFI can aid providers in identifying the impact of 
a patient’s culture on treatment, improve patient-provider rapport, and help patients and 
providers align treatment goals (Aggarwal et al., 2020). On an organizational and systems 
level, the clinical workforce should mirror the patient population as much as possible so as 
to minimize cultural gaps.

4.  Preference for autonomy

Through mechanisms such as involuntary hospitalization and involuntary medication 
administration, patients may experience a profound loss of perceived autonomy following 
the onset of psychosis. Further, many transitional-aged youth living with an SSD may 
experience a sudden loss of autonomy due to increased monitoring by family and other 
supports during a time when their peers are rapidly gaining independence. For these reasons,

many patients may prefer to handle problems on their own without the help of ongoing 
mental health care. Some patients may prefer to seek treatment only as needed during times 
of crisis.

4.1.  Potential solutions to optimize autonomy in care

Utilize motivational interviewing and a shared-decision-making approach to offer choices 
and emphasize autonomy throughout treatment consistently. Ask patients what solutions 
they believe they would find most helpful in recovery (e.g., reducing stress or talking with 
friends) and take a collaborative approach around including these elements in the treatment 
plan. Engagement with peer support services also may increase sense of autonomy by 
promoting self-efficacy and mitigating self-stigma (Vayshenker et al., 2016).

5.  Limited efficacy and tolerability of available treatment

Antipsychotics are largely only effective for positive symptoms and approximately 30 % of 
patients have positive symptoms largely refractory to non-clozapine antipsychotics (Kahn et 
al., 2015; Correll et al., 2019). To the extent that psychosocial interventions for negative and 
cognitive symptoms exist, they tend to be time-intensive with significant patient burden 
(Munson et al., 2022). Further, many patients disengage from care due to intolerable 
medication side effects. It is not surprising that many patients who experience persistent 
symptoms and/or intolerable side effects may disengage from care after multiple medication 
trials.

5.1.  Potential solutions for limited efficacy and tolerability of available treatment

On an individual provider level, showing humility around the limitations of current treatment 
options may build rapport and strengthen trust. Early psychoeducation with patients and 
families can help set realistic expectations around the efficacy of antipsychotics for negative 
and cognitive symptoms and may increase the acceptability of psychosocial interventions. 
As a field, we need to continue investing in high-quality research to improve the efficacy, 
tolerability, and acceptability of existing treatments. Through targeted education efforts, we 
need to increase provider comfortability around clozapine, social skills training, cognitive 
enhancement training, and other effective but often under-utilized treatments.

Engaging reluctant patients requires a careful analysis of the precipitating factors interfering 
with sustained treatment for psychosis. A survey of the impact of a patient’s positive, 
negative, and cognitive symptoms on the ability to engage in care can provide insight 
into interventions to prioritize to facilitate engagement in care. Open-ended questions and 
reflective listening can be powerful tools in unmasking structural and attitudinal barriers to 
psychosis care across treatment settings.
