Suicide prevention

We agree with Eggertson and Patrick that 
suicide prevention needs attention.1 How-
ever, we cannot agree that another strat-
egy  is  the  solution.  Strategies  do  exist; 
now is the time to put them into action.

We  aren’t  lacking  in  guidance  — 
we have a roadmap, arrived at through 
extensive  consultation.  Suicide  pre-
vention  is  an  integral  component  of 
Changing  directions,  changing  lives: 
the mental health strategy for Canada2 
and  its  companion  piece,  The  mental 
health  strategy  for  Canada:  a  youth 
perspective.3 Most Canadians who die 
by  suicide  are  confronting  mental 
health problems or illnesses and share 
many common risk factors.

We  cannot  effectively  address  sui-
cide  prevention  in  isolation  from  the 
broader  context,  which  includes  a 
commitment  to  early  identification, 
timely  access  to  services,  treatment 
and  support,  and  the  reduction  of  the 
stigma  associated  with  mental  health 
problems and illnesses — all of which 
figure prominently in the strategy.2 We 
cannot  in  good  conscience  let  a 
thoughtful  document  that  contains 
such collective wisdom, gather dust.

That is why the Mental Health Com-
mission  of  Canada  has  put  forward  an 
evidence-based,  action-oriented  pro-
gram  to  address  suicide  prevention  at 
the  community  level.  This  far-reaching 
project  accounts  for  fiscal  reality  and 
maximizes  the  use  of  community 
resources.  It  offers  a  multi-faceted 
approach to a complex problem — but 
its  actions  are  simple.  It  will  provide 
key community members (from coaches 
and  barbers  to  educators,  health  care 
providers and spiritual leaders) with the 
knowledge and tools to identify those at 
risk  of  suicide  and  connect  them  to 
help.  It  will  enhance  specialized  sup-
ports  for  crises  situations  and  restrict 
access  to  methods  or  places  where  a 
high  number  of  suicides  occur.  The 
project  will  improve  public  awareness 
and foster bolder research to expand our 
knowledge about suicide prevention. 

Examining  this  challenging  public 
health  issue  through  a  holistic  lens  is 

why Inuit Tapiirit Kanatami (ITK), the 
national Inuit political association, has 
released  the  National  Inuit  Suicide 
Prevention  Strategy.4  ITK  and  other 
indigenous  communities,  like  the 
Thunderbird  Partnership  Foundation, 
have  taken  ownership  of  the  stagger-
ing challenge facing its communities.

When  it  comes  to  saving  the  lives 
of  4000  Canadians  every  year,  we 
don’t have time to reinvent the wheel. 
The tools and resources, including the 
94  calls  to  action  outlined  in  the  final 
report of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission of Canada, are there.2–5

Doing any test is not better 
than doing no test

Murray’s letter repeats a common mis-
take  in  thinking  about  screening,  that 
“doing  any  test  is  better  than  doing 
nothing  at  all.”1  In  fact,  sometimes 
doing  nothing  is  better  than  doing 
something: more is not always better.2 
There  are  risks  and  harms  with  all 
medical  interventions  including 
screening.3  It  is  imperative  not  only 
that  cancer  screening  programs  find 
malignancies  early  but  also  that  they 
yield  more  benefit  that  harm:  harm 
generally  arises  from  false-negative

results, false-positive results and over-
diagnosis.4

Although  the  risk  of  a  false-nega-
tive result may be mitigated by repeat 
screening, it may also lead to harm.4 A 
person falsely reassured may continue 
an  unhealthy  lifestyle  and  be  less 
likely  to  return  for  repeat  screening.5 
A false-positive result often leads to a 
cascade of increasingly invasive medi-
cal  interventions,  as  well  as  the  psy-
chological  distress  of  becoming  a 
patient and being labeled as “ill.”4,5

Specific  to  colonoscopy  are  a  num-
ber of risks. Murray correctly states that 
a 1:1000 risk of perforation is rare,1 but 
rare events add up quickly when numer-
ous  people  are  screened.  With  millions 
of  Canadians  eligible  for  colon  cancer 
screening, rare risks are not negligible.6
It  is  true  that  people  with  “symp-
toms … will need to be investigated.”1 
However,  these  people  are  not  being 
screened.6 Screening is meant to catch 
disease  early  and  is  carried  out  on 
apparently  well  asymptomatic  people. 
Though  the  current  evidence  does  not 
support  the  use  of  colonoscopy  for 
population-based  primary  screening 
—  hence,  colonoscopy  is  not  recom-
mended  as  a  primary  population 
screening  test6  —  colonoscopy  does 
have other roles in health care.
