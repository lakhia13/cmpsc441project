Abstract

Difficulties with both executive functions and language skills are common but variable in autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD). Executive functions and language skills are related to one another, such 
that vocabulary, syntax, and pragmatics are related to domains of working memory, shifting, and 
inhibition in ASD, although the directionality of these relationships remains unclear. Moreover, 
interventions that target pragmatic ability have been found to improve executive function skills, 
and conversely, executive function interventions are linked with improvements in social skills in 
children with ASD. We review the literature on executive functions, language skills, and their 
relationship in ASD, discuss factors that may be driving inconsistent findings, and explore clinical 
applications from the research thus far.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is behaviorally 
diagnosed and is characterized by deficits in social communication and the presence of 
restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior1. Recent estimates from the Center for Disease 
Control indicate that this disorder affects approximately 1 in 59 children2. Children, 
adolescents, and adults with ASD often exhibit deficits in various aspects of executive 
function, although numerous review articles and meta-analyses indicate variability in 
executive function performance in this population, depending on the tasks and comparison 
groups included in the study3–7. Executive functions are defined as cognitive processes that 
underlie goal-directed behavior, and include skills such as shifting or cognitive flexibility, 
inhibition, and working memory, as well as higher-level functions such as planning8–10. 
Executive functions have a vast impact on daily life, and are closely related to the ability to

communicate with others3,11–13. Understanding the relationship between communicative 
skills and executive function skills is important because both domains have impacts on 
learning, scholastic achievement, and social development14–16. Additionally, various 
theories have proposed that language mediates executive functions, while others have 
proposed that executive functioning underlies communication skills11,17,18. This paper 
reviews empirical studies that examined executive functions (e.g., shifting, inhibition, 
working memory, planning) and language (e.g., semantics, syntax, and pragmatics) in ASD, 
and discusses clinical implications drawn from existing evidence.

Language overview in ASD

Social communication impairments are a core characteristic and required to obtain a 
behavioral diagnosis of ASD. Pragmatic language is one component of social 
communication and includes a variety of skills. Children with ASD have challenges with 
topic maintenance, greetings and farewells, appropriate turn taking, and using conversational 
repair strategies. These deficits are associated with challenges with perspective-taking and 
theory of mind19. Due to the pervasiveness of pragmatic language deficits, this area has been 
extensively studied in ASD20–22. Children with ASD are impaired in their pragmatic skills 
compared to peer groups with typical development (TD), intellectual disability, or other 
disorders23–25.

While deficits in pragmatics and social communication are a hallmark feature of ASD, 
structural language abilities, specifically semantics and syntax, vary and result in marked 
individual differences. Several studies indicate a discrepancy in expressive and receptive 
vocabulary scores, such that expressive vocabulary scores are higher than receptive 
vocabulary scores26–28. Other studies have noted no difference, or reported higher receptive 
vocabulary scores than expressive vocabulary scores, and the discrepant findings appear to 
depend on the measures and ages of participants28–30. In addition to deficits in standardized 
vocabulary scores, children with ASD present with unique deficits in specific subdomains of 
vocabulary, including the production and comprehension of personal pronouns, mental state 
terms, and prepositions23,31,32. These subdomains of vocabulary may be particularly 
impacted because they require perspective-taking, which is often a challenge for individuals 
with ASD. For example, use and understanding of mental state terms, which refer to one’s 
emotional or cognitive state, require theory of mind33. Similarly, correct use of personal 
pronouns requires the speaker to know if the communication partner is aware of the referent. 
If not, a communication breakdown can occur.

Within the domain of syntax, children and adolescents with ASD are variable in their 
deficits. Several studies have suggested that children with ASD exhibit syntactic delays in 
comparison to peers with intellectual disability or TD34–37. These syntactic abnormalities 
can include challenges with verb phrases, regular and irregular past tense, present tense, and 
regular third person singular verbs35,36. However, like deficits in semantics, challenges in 
this domain of language are not universal among individuals with ASD; several studies have 
reported intact syntactic skills in individuals with ASD when compared to TD peers38. In 
fact several studies have proposed that there exists a sub-group of children with ASD who 
have grammatical impairments that mirror those of children with developmental language

disorder (DLD), which is a disorder characterized by deficits in language without a known 
etiology39,40. However, general patterns have indicated that while some children with ASD 
have challenges with certain aspects of syntax, this is not true for all children with ASD.

Executive function overview in ASD

Similar to structural language, many children and adolescents with ASD have difficulties 
with executive functions, although unlike pragmatic language, this is not a hallmark deficit 
of this population. Many studies have found that executive functions are generally impaired 
at the group level in children and adolescents with ASD, particularly in comparison to peers 
with TD41–43, although this is not always the case44. It is important to be mindful of 
individual differences, though, as some children with ASD do not exhibit deficits in 
executive function, indicating that these deficits are not a core impairment in this 
population45. It is also particularly difficult to draw conclusions about children with ASD 
because studies vary in group matching criteria, as well as inclusionary and exclusionary 
criteria. However, some studies that have conflicting findings report similar ages for their 
participant groups, as well as similar matching criteria, comparison groups, and 
covariates42–44. Two common comparison groups are children with attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and children with (DLD). Specifically, comparisons between 
ASD and ADHD are frequent because these two disorders share phenotypic overlap, and 
understanding their respective executive function skills can shed light on similarities and 
differences in these groups. On the other hand, comparisons between children with ASD to 
children with DLD inform the relationship between language skills and executive functions. 
These groups are commonly compared when examining language development in ASD.

Executive function domains, as noted above, include shifting, inhibition, and working 
memory (commonly referred to as updating). These domains, although related, are separable 
and unique constructs, as indicated by a factor analysis completed by Miyake and 
colleagues9. We will define these domains and summarize the literature on executive 
function skills in children and adolescents with ASD. We delve into more detail for the 
domain of planning, which is regarded as a higher-level cognitive skill, given that it is 
inherently more complex than shifting, inhibition, and working memory9. Notably, some 
methods used to measure executive functions are verbal or linguistic in nature, while others 
are nonverbal or do not have a linguistic component. We will identify the verbal or linguistic 
nature of the tasks, as this feature may impact the interpretation of the findings. After 
examining executive functions in ASD, we will discuss studies that have specifically linked 
shifting, inhibition, working memory, and planning to language abilities.

Shifting.

Shifting is the ability to switch between mental states or tasks and is also commonly referred 
to in the literature as cognitive flexibility. There is some evidence that shifting is impaired in 
ASD in comparison to peer groups with DLD46 and ADHD42,43, as well as TD peers47. 
However, other studies have not found differences in shifting between children with ASD 
and children with TD, intellectual disability, or ADHD44,48. A number of studies have used 
the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST49) to examine shifting. In this task, participants are

expected to shift between sorting cards based on one of three dimensions, including color, 
number, and shape. Although the WCST does not require a verbal output, linguistic skills 
can help the participant to verbally encode and rehearse the shapes or colors of the targets 
for sorting. A perseverative error occurs if an individual does not shift to the new sorting 
expectation and responds based on the previous sorting expectation. Children with ASD tend 
to make more of these perseverative errors during this task in comparison to peer groups 
with TD, ADHD and DLD46,50. For example, Liss and colleagues46 compared shifting 
abilities between school-age children with high-functioning ASD and children with DLD 
matched on IQ, age, and SES. Notably, the children with DLD had an average verbal IQ 
score that was 10 points higher than the children with ASD. Shifting was measured using the 
WCST. They found that the children with ASD made more perseverative errors on the 
WCST, but the difference in perseverative errors was no longer significant when accounting 
for verbal IQ. The authors ultimately proposed that there were not unique shifting deficits in 
ASD, and that verbal IQ played a key role in shifting performance.

A 2014 meta-analysis5 of shifting focused on reported data from a large sample of 
individuals with ASD and TD. Across a range of performance measures, the authors found 
that participants with ASD and participants with TD were not different on shifting 
performance overall, although they did find a difference between groups on the Shift 
subscale of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF51,52). The authors 
of this meta-analysis advise that performance measures of cognitive flexibility may lack 
ecological validity, as these measures were not as sensitive as the BRIEF in distinguishing 
between clinical and control groups. Overall, they suggest that their results are not surprising 
given that cognitive inflexibility, or difficulty with shifting, is not a core characteristic of 
ASD. However, the authors reported that the majority of the studies included in the meta-
analysis had compared individuals with ASD to age-matched controls, but the authors did 
not consider group matching status in their inclusionary criteria5. Therefore, results from 
this meta-analysis may not generalize to all individuals with ASD; comparison groups 
should be considered in future work.

Response inhibition has been a focus of several studies that compare participants with ASD 
to various peer groups, often participants with ADHD and TD. This aspect of executive 
function involves suppressing information that may interfere with the task goal at hand. Like 
results for shifting, findings related to response inhibition in children and adolescents with 
ASD are varied. Some studies have reported no differences between children with ASD and 
their peer groups with ADHD and TD44,48,53, while others have reported marked 
impairments in this domain42,43.

Several studies have compared verbal response inhibition performance in children with ASD 
to that in children with TD. For example, Yang and colleagues44 examined this skill using 
the Stroop task54 in children with ASD (mean age = 8.1 years) in comparison to children 
with TD (mean age = 8.0 years) and children with ADHD (mean age = 8.2 years). Children 
were all statistically similar on age, and nonverbal IQ scores were controlled in their 
analyses. The Stroop task requires participants to provide a verbal output while suppressing

other verbal information. For example, in this task the participant may see the word BLUE 
printed in green ink, and they must name the color of the ink instead of the printed word. 
The authors found no significant differences between the three groups in performance on the 
Stroop task as a measure of inhibition44. Corbett and colleagues42 examined response 
inhibition in similar groups of children, including children with high functioning ASD 
(mean age = 9.44 years), TD (mean age = 9.56 years), and ADHD (mean age = 9.40 years). 
They controlled for IQ in their analyses, and measured inhibition with various tasks, 
including one verbal task that was similar to the Stroop test. On the Stroop-like task, they 
found that children with ASD performed worse on measures of inhibition compared to the 
children with TD, but they performed similarly to the children with ADHD. There were no 
differences between the children with ADHD and the children with TD on this task. The 
authors also measured response inhibition with a task in which participants pressed a button 
when they saw or heard a number “1” but not a number “2.” Thus, this task did not require a 
verbal output, although the input was linguistic in nature. Children with ASD performed 
worse than children with TD on both tasks, but they only performed worse than children 
with ADHD on the visual number presentations42.

One study by Johnston and colleagues55 examined verbal response inhibition in adults with 
ASD (mean age = 27.8 years) compared to adults with ADHD (mean age = 27.3 years), and 
TD adults (mean age = 27.3 years). The groups were matched on verbal IQ (all participants 
had verbal IQ scores within the normal range), age, and gender. The authors used verbal 
tasks, including the Stroop task54 and the Hayling Sentence Completion test56, which 
requires participants to complete a sentence using either a relevant, connected word, or an 
irrelevant, unconnected word. Participants with ASD had typical response inhibition but 
slow response latencies. The authors suggested that this was likely due to deficits in 
response initiation. That is, adults with ASD were slower and more accurate, while adults 
with ADHD were more impulsive in the manner in which they completed the task55.

Working memory.

Updating of working memory is the ability to revise recalled information as task goals 
update or change14. Similar to the domains of shifting and inhibition, results from working 
memory tasks are variable: some studies have reported that children with ASD are impaired 
when compared to peer groups such as children with TD and children with ADHD42,43, 
while others have reported no differences in working memory performance between 
individuals with ASD and peer groups with TD, ADHD, and intellectual disability43,44,48.

Roelofs and colleagues48 did not find differences in working memory among adolescents 
and young adults with ASD and intellectual disability, compared to age- and IQ-matched 
individuals without ASD. Updating of working memory was measured using a verbal 
fluency task and a verbal backwards digit span test. Kado and colleagues43 reported similar 
working memory performance between children with ASD and children with ADHD, but 
both groups had impaired working memory compared to chronological age- and IQ-matched 
school-age children with TD. In this study, the authors used a modified Japanese version of 
the WCST49 which included fewer cards57. The test was purported to measure aspects of 
inhibition, shifting, and working memory. They presented several scores for this task,

Planning.

including the number of sorted sets of six consecutive cards. The authors found that children 
with ASD and ADHD sorted fewer sets and had a higher number of total errors than the 
children with TD, indicative of inadequate working memory43.

To tease out verbal demands of executive function tasks, some studies deliberately separate 
working memory into two domains: spatial or visual working memory and verbal working 
memory. For example, Hill and colleagues58 assessed working memory in five to eight-year-
old children with ASD and children with DLD. The children with ASD were divided into 
two groups: children who had co-occurring language impairment and children who had 
typical or normal language abilities. They found that children with ASD and language 
impairment performed worse on verbal working memory tasks than the children with ASD 
and normal language. The children with ASD and language impairment and children with 
DLD performed similarly on most verbal working memory tasks except for a nonword 
repetition task, in which the children with DLD produced more errors. However, there were 
no group differences on the visual working memory tasks, indicating that the increased 
demands associated with a verbal working memory task may impact performance and 
differentiate ASD groups with and without language impairment58.

Planning is considered to be a higher-level cognitive process, and requires sequences of 
planned actions to be monitored and updated when given additional knowledge or when a 
preceding action occurs6. Generally, children with ASD demonstrate marked deficits in 
planning compared to TD peers, as well as peer groups with ADHD and Tourette’s 
syndrome,47,50,59 although children with ASD may have similar planning skills to children 
with a language disorder46.

Kimhi noted differences in planning ability between preschool children with ASD and 
chronological- and mental age-matched children with TD47. Older children with ASD may 
also exhibit deficits in planning, as a longitudinal study examining executive function in 
adolescents with ASD relative to adolescents with learning disability found that adolescents 
with ASD have deficits in planning compared to the children with TD; notably, these deficits 
did not improve over a three-year time period59. In contrast to these findings, Liss and 
colleagues did not find differences between boys with ASD and boys with DLD on the 
Mazes subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Revised, which is a task 
that measures aspects of planning, shifting, and inhibition46. Also, Corbett and colleagues42 
did not find significant differences in planning between children with high functioning ASD, 
children with ADHD, and children with TD when they used the Cambridge 
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Stockings of Cambridge task, 
which is a spatial planning task.

Generally, it appears that some individuals with ASD exhibit deficits in areas of executive 
functions, but findings seem to be dependent on several factors. First, outcomes may be 
dependent on the ages of the participants. For example, studies that include adolescents or 
adults generally find that participants with ASD do not perform differently than TD peers or 
peers with ADHD or intellectual disability,44,48,53 whereas studies that only include school-
age or younger participants are more likely to reveal differences42,46. Secondly, verbal and

nonverbal tasks can yield differences, such that tasks which require verbal responses 
generally differentiate groups, while tasks that are more visually-based do not58. This 
pattern of findings suggests that executive function skills by themselves may not impacted in 
ASD, but group differences may emerge when executive function tasks include verbal or 
linguistic demands. While language deficits in the domains of vocabulary and syntax are not 
hallmark features of ASD, some children do experience delays in these domains39. 
Therefore, it is important to include language-matched groups of children if selecting 
executive function tasks that require verbal output. For example, Hill and colleagues 
reported that groups of children with ASD and DLD matched on language ability performed 
similarly on verbal working memory tasks58, highlighting the importance of language 
matching.

Many studies, however, do not include language-matched groups of children. Rather, groups 
are often matched on chronological age, mental age, or IQ43,46,48,53. Selection of 
comparison groups and matching criteria are important to consider. For instance, comparing 
children with ASD to children with DLD may yield different results than comparing 
children with ASD to children with ADHD or other intellectual and developmental 
disabilities. A comparison of age- and IQ-matched children with ASD and DLD suggests 
similarities in inhibition, and shifting, and planning46. Age-matched children with ASD and 
children with DLD do not differ in performance on visual working memory tasks, and 
children with ASD+language impairment and children with DLD perform similarly on 
verbal working memory tasks58. In comparison to age- and IQ-matched children with 
ADHD, children with ASD either perform worse42,43 or similarly44 on shifting, inhibition, 
and working memory measures. Additionally, comparisons of individuals with ASD
+intellectual disability and individuals with intellectual disability without ASD do not yield 
differences in shifting, inhibition, or working memory48. Ultimately these findings suggest 
that, when controlling for linguistic abilities and task demands, individuals with ASD are 
likely not uniquely experiencing executive dysfunction. Further, language skills, along with 
co-morbid diagnoses, such as ADHD, must be considered when assessing and targeting 
executive functions in children with this heterogeneous disorder.

To elucidate the interplay between executive functions and language, several studies have 
explored the relationship between these two domains in children and adolescents with ASD. 
We will review studies that have examined executive functions in relation to vocabulary, 
syntax, and/or pragmatic abilities.

The relationship between executive function and language in ASD

Studies examining executive functions and language in children with TD have found 
correlations between these two domains. One particularly relevant model for conceptualizing 
the relationship between executive functions and language is the Hierarchical Competing 
Systems Model (HCSM)18. This model suggests that there is a habit system which is 
influenced by previous experience, and a representational system which is influenced by 
conscious reflection on behavior. These two systems are hierarchically arranged, and they 
compete to guide goal-directed behavior; thus, the representational system can override the 
habit system. While the habit system may lead an individual to be influenced by perceptual

information, the representational system, or language-guided reflection, overrides 
perceptually driven behaviors in favor of more mature goal-directed behavior. This model 
serves to explain the relationship between executive functions and language throughout the 
lifespan.

Vocabulary.

Given the HCSM’s claims regarding the importance of verbal ability for executive function 
performance18, it is probable that vocabulary, in particular, is important. Cascia and Barr60 
reported on expressive and receptive vocabulary in relation to executive functions in children 
and adolescents with ASD, ranging in age from 9 to 18 years (mean age = 14.65 years). 
They found that receptive and expressive vocabulary standard scores were related to parent 
and teacher ratings of executive functions. Specifically, expressive and receptive vocabulary 
scores were related to parent ratings of attention, emotion regulation, and inhibitory control. 
Based on the teacher ratings, receptive vocabulary was related to attention and organization, 
and both expressive and receptive vocabulary scores were related to emotion regulation, 
flexibility, inhibitory control, initiation, and self-monitoring. The goal of their study was to 
examine how executive function mediates the relationship between vocabulary and empathy; 
they found that both vocabulary and executive functioning ability were important for 
empathy. The authors discussed how more advanced vocabulary can support social 
interactions. The same logic/argument can be extended to executive functioning skills, such 
that better executive functioning ability can support social interactions. Therefore, not only 
are vocabulary and executive functions related to one another, but they both underlie 
important social outcomes60.

Joseph and colleagues41 studied executive function and lexical skills in 34 school-age 
children with ASD and 31 children without ASD who were matched on age, verbal IQ, and 
nonverbal IQ. Children with ASD had poorer expressive and receptive vocabulary raw and 
standard scores. Unlike the comparison group, vocabulary scores for the children with ASD 
were not correlated to measures of inhibition or planning. Moreover, language and working 
memory were not related in either group. The authors posited that children with ASD did not 
use their language to internally maintain rules or to verbally encode steps to complete the 
tasks. These findings may suggest that children with ASD present with a deficit in verbal 
mediation, or the ability to use language skills internally to facilitate accomplishing goal-
directed behavior.

In order to examine lexical processing skills in relation to executive functions, Haebig et al.
61 used a lexical decision task and executive function tasks that targeted shifting and 
updating. Groups included 30 TD children, 27 children with ASD, and 28 children with 
DLD. The groups were matched on receptive vocabulary growth scores. The authors found 
that both shifting and updating abilities predicted accuracy and reaction time on the lexical 
processing task. The authors posited that children, regardless of diagnosis, process language 
with the aid of nonlinguistic mechanisms. Therefore, they argue that, consistent with the 
HCSM, there exists a relationship between language and executive functions, such that 
executive function supports language processing. The directionality of this relationship 
cannot be determined from this study, however, given its cross-sectional design61.

Syntax.

Page 9

The HCSM also leads to the hypothesis that better syntactic skills would benefit 
performance on executive function tasks. Some studies have used the Clinical Evaluation of 
Language Fundamentals (CELF62) to examine expressive and receptive language ability, 
including syntactic ability. For example, Akbar and colleagues assessed children with ASD 
between the ages of 8–19 years (76% male). Children completed the CELF, Fourth Edition62 
to obtain a receptive, expressive, and core language score. The Children’s Communication 
Checklist63 was used as a parent report measure of language. The authors assessed working 
memory, organization, shifting, and inhibition using the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function 
System (DKEFS64), the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY-II65), and 
the Wechsler Intelligence Scales For Children (WISC66). The CELF-4 core language score 
was a significant predictor of working memory. Nonverbal IQ scores predicted organization 
and shifting; ASD severity predicted shifting as well. There were no predictors for 
inhibition. The authors suggested that working memory deficits in ASD may be the result of 
weak language ability, as working memory is also a deficit for kids with DLD. The authors 
also proposed that this connection between working memory, syntax, and semantics could be 
due to a limitation in the ability to develop and utilize verbal mediation strategies during 
these executive function tasks11.

Ellis Weismer and colleagues67 also used the CELF-462 to specifically look at associations 
between receptive and expressive language scores and executive functions (i.e., shifting, 
inhibition, and updating of working memory). Their participant groups included children 
with TD and children with ASD, who were all between the ages of 8 and 12 years. There 
were several associations between receptive and expressive language skills and executive 
functions in children with ASD. However, when the children with ASD were split into 
groups with typical language and language impairment, receptive language abilities were 
associated with different executive function domains. In the group with language 
impairment, receptive language was correlated with shifting; in the group with normal 
language, receptive language was correlated with inhibition. The authors proposed that the 
association between language and executive functioning skills support the HCSM, but they 
caution that this finding does not answer the question of directionality67.

Durrleman and Delage32 studied 5 – 16 year-old children and adolescents with ASD (mean 
age = 9;07) and DLD (mean age = 9;07) compared with age-matched controls and younger 
controls matched on expressive grammar abilities. They assessed expressive grammar and 
specifically examined pronoun production. They used a backward digit span task to assess 
working memory. When they controlled for nonverbal reasoning, they found correlations 
between third person pronoun production and backward digit span for both the children with 
ASD and the children with DLD; however, they did not look at these relationships in the 
children with TD. The authors suggested that the production of complex grammar recruits 
working memory ability in children with ASD and DLD32.

Pragmatic language.

Widespread and pervasive deficits in pragmatic language skills in children and adolescents 
with ASD make this area of language particularly interesting and important to study. Several

studies have reported connections between pragmatic language and executive functions. For 
instance, in addition to studying the relationship between executive functions and structural 
language, Akbar and colleagues used the pragmatic judgment subtest of the Comprehensive 
Assessment of Spoken Language (CASL68) to examine the relationship between executive 
functions and pragmatic language in their group of 8–19 year-old participants with ASD. 
They found that the pragmatic judgment score of the CASL predicted working memory in 
children with ASD as measured by a letter and number sequencing task, but it did not 
predict other aspects of executive functions, including shifting and inhibition11. The authors 
proposed that syntactic skills and pragmatic skills both contribute to the ability to perform 
well on tasks of working memory.

Other studies have examined the expressive pragmatic skills in children and adolescents with 
ASD. For example, McEvoy and colleagues21 assessed preschool age children with ASD, 
developmental delay, and TD. Children completed a battery of executive function tasks, and 
the Early Social Communication Scales69 was used to measure joint attention and social 
interaction. The authors found that the children with ASD had lower scores in social 
interaction compared to the other two groups. The children with ASD were also not able to 
flexibly change sets on the spatial reversal task, and they had more perseverative errors than 
the two other groups, meaning that the children with ASD persisted in using a previously 
reinforced strategy even though this strategy no longer resulted in a reward. In addition, a 
significant relationship was observed between social interaction behaviors and executive 
functioning skills across groups. The social interactions had specific goals (e.g., rolling a 
ball back and forth with the examiner), and the ability to maintain and achieve these goals 
may be reflected by the relationship between social interaction behaviors and executive 
function skills. Finally, there was a relationship between social interaction behaviors and 
joint attention, suggesting that this relationship may account for the link between social 
interaction and executive functions, as joint attention was also related to perseverations on 
the spatial reversal task21.

Gilotty and colleagues13 examined executive function skills in relation to adaptive skills in 
children and adolescents with ASD, ranging in age from 6 to 17 years. They found 
relationships between executive functioning skills and the communication and socialization 
domains of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Specifically, poor communication 
domain scores and social domain scores were related to less initiation and worse working 
memory skills. This supports the hypothesis that working memory and aspects of language 
and communication are associated in this population13. Pugliese et al.70 reported similar 
findings, such that parent reports of executive functioning skills predicted socialization and 
communication scores on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS71) in school-age 
children with high-functioning ASD70.

In sum, language abilities (overall language and pragmatic language, specifically) appear to 
be particularly important for working memory in this population11,13,32,67. It is also possible 
that working memory underlies performance on language-based tasks, such as a lexical 
decision task61. Findings regarding the relationship between executive functions and 
expressive and receptive vocabulary knowledge appear to be mixed41,60. Given these 
findings, and the premise of the HCSM, executive function and language certainly appear to

be related; however, it is difficult to determine the directionality of the relationship between 
these two skills. Regardless, deficits in these domains in children with ASD warrant further 
research, particularly in how clinical practice can improve these two skills.

Impact of intervention

The relationships between executive functions and domains of language ability (e.g., 
vocabulary, syntax, and pragmatics) in ASD raise questions surrounding the impact of 
intervention. Specifically, if structural and/or pragmatic language skills are in fact associated 
with executive functions, one could argue that an intervention that targets one domain would 
lead to generalized improvements in the other domain. The HCSM would purport that 
improvements in language ability would lead to improvements in executive functions, 
although results reported by Haebig and colleagues61 would imply the opposite, such that 
executive function would support language performance. In line with the HCSM, a few 
studies have looked at executive functions as an outcome after administering a social-based 
pragmatic intervention.

Stichter and colleagues examined the effectiveness of a social competence intervention for 
elementary school students with high-functioning ASD72. They used the Social Competence 
Intervention-Elementary (SCI-E72) program for participants with ASD between 6 and 10 
years of age (mean age = 8.77 years). IQ scores ranged from 72–124. This intervention 
targeted social communication areas including turn-taking, recognizing feelings and facial 
expressions in others, sharing ideas, and problem solving. They obtained several 
measurements pre- and post-intervention, including the parent-report and teacher-report 
Social Responsiveness Scale73 as a measure of social functioning, and tasks that measured 
emotion recognition, executive functions, and theory of mind. Executive functions were 
measured through parent report and direct assessment. The intervention resulted in 
improvements in theory of mind, as well as better problem-solving abilities as measured 
through the direct assessment. Parent perceptions of social functioning and executive 
functions also increased74.

Morgan and colleagues conducted a cluster randomized trial to examine the effects of 
classroom Social, Communication, Emotional Regulation, and Transactional Support 
(SCERTS75) intervention in comparison to a school-based education that included ASD 
training modules. Specifically, they were interested in executive functions and social 
outcomes, in addition to active engagement in the classroom and adaptive behaviors, for 
children with ASD. One hundred-eighteen children with ASD were in the classroom 
SCERTS intervention group (mean age = 6.82 years), and 79 children were assigned to the 
ASD training modules group (mean age = 6.77 years). Participants in these groups were not 
significantly different on age, race, ethnicity, gender, ASD severity, or pre-test IQ measures. 
They found that the group receiving the classroom SCERTS intervention had better 
outcomes in social skills and executive functions. One explanation for these findings is that 
the SCERTS model is inherently social, in that the main goal is to increase the student’s 
engagement and social communication. However, it is important to note that the outcome 
measures for social skills and executive functions were teacher-report scales, which may 
have biased the results as the teachers knew which treatment they were administering76.

One study examined an executive function intervention and its impact on social skills. 
Kenworthy and colleagues77 conducted a randomized control trial of Unstuck and On Target 
(UOT), which is an executive function intervention. Forty-seven children with ASD were 
assigned to the UOT intervention, while 20 children with ASD were assigned to a social 
skills intervention. Children were between 7 and 11 years old and all had IQ scores above 
70. The children who received the UOT intervention had greater improvements in domains 
of executive function, including flexibility and planning, compared to the children who 
received the control social skills intervention, although both groups demonstrated 
improvements on pre- and post-intervention assessments. Children in both groups also made 
improvements in social skills, indicating that treatments targeting executive function may 
also help pragmatic language skills77.

Clinical implications

Extending the complex and often contradictory findings of both empirical and clinical 
research to practice is difficult given the heterogeneity of ASD. This is also complicated by 
the differences between studies in terms of the tasks used for assessment, particularly the use 
of verbal- or visual-based tasks; the comparison groups selected, including children with 
ADHD, DLD, or TD; and the methods used for group-matching. Specifically, groups 
matched on language do not yield differences in executive function performance between 
children with TD and ASD61, but matching on IQ or age inconsistently yields differences 
between groups42–44,46,48,53. Despite the variability in findings, some key patterns do 
emerge from these studies.

Social communication-based interventions appear to have a positive impact on executive 
function.

Several studies that targeted social skills in elementary school children found improvements 
in executive functions after treatment. One theory for this is that children in social-based 
interventions learn to self-reflect, and they also learn to observe the behaviors of peers. If 
children strengthen their ability to observe and understand their own behaviors and the 
behaviors of their peers, it is likely that they will use these self-reflection skills during 
executive function tasks. If verbal mediation does play a role in executive function tasks, 
then perhaps this skill is enhanced during a social-based intervention, and increased practice 
translates to executive functions. Conversely, just as social-based interventions can result in 
improvements in executive functions, there is evidence that executive function-based 
intervention can result in improvements in social skills77.

Structural language ability is important for performance on tasks of executive functions.

Connections between structural language (lexical and syntactic skills) and executive 
functions support the HCSM, such that language guides reflection on behavior and 
ultimately impacts performance on these cognitive tasks. For instance, several studies note 
that working memory and syntax are related11,32 and lexical abilities appear to be important 
for shifting and inhibition60,61. These relationships support the hypothesis that the ability to 
use linguistic skills to drive one’s behavior is important for tasks of executive functions. 
Thus, if this hypothesis is correct, the clinical implications are that focusing on the

development of vocabulary and syntax may ultimately benefit children with ASD both 
academically and socially. However, further research is needed to test this hypothesis.

Consideration of ASD symptom severity.

ASD symptomatology and severity impacts the presence of both restricted and repetitive 
behaviors as well as social deficits, which are the two core deficits in ASD. Several studies 
have found connections between executive function and ASD symptomatology and/or 
severity. Thus, ASD symptomatology and/or severity is an important factor to consider in 
both research and clinical practice. However, it is challenging to disentangle these features, 
and it is not clear if increased severity impact performance on executive function tasks, or if 
impairments in executive function result in presentation of more severe symptoms. For 
example, children with ASD tend to make more perseverative errors on tasks measuring 
shifting in comparison to children with DLD or ADHD46,50, and these errors are potentially 
positively correlated with ASD severity and symptomology. A treatment approach must be 
carefully selected, knowing that these errors and behaviors are likely a product of this core 
deficit of ASD. It is challenging to draw direct conclusions from present work, however, 
because the majority of studies examining executive functions and language include children 
with high-functioning ASD.

In addition to considering ASD severity and symptomology, it is still important to 
comprehensively account for an individual’s profile, including strengths, weaknesses, and 
motivators, before administering treatment. Consideration of the individual’s profile, use of 
clinical expertise and judgment, and implementation of research-based treatment need to be 
integrated in order to perform evidence-based practice.

Conclusions

There are large variations in findings and contradictory reports of executive function 
performance and its relation to language ability in children and adolescents with ASD, and 
future work should aim to carefully characterize the participant samples to aid in presenting 
clear conclusions within a heterogeneous disorder. It remains evident that language and 
executive function are important for several aspects of daily life, impacting outcomes such 
as scholastic achievement, peer victimization, and reciprocal relationships14–16. Given that 
both executive functions and language ultimately have profound effects on daily life, and 
that one can be influenced by targeting the other in intervention, it is important that future 
research continues to examine the interplay between these two domains.

Learning objectives:

The reader will be able to (1) explain the relationship between executive functions and 
language in ASD, (2) describe how targeted interventions may impact executive function 
or language performance in ASD, and (3) explain how various executive function task 
features and inclusion of different comparison groups may yield distinctive findings.
