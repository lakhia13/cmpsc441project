Summary

Transgender people are a diverse population affected by a variety of negative health indicators 
across high, middle, and low income settings. Studies consistently document high prevalence of 
adverse health outcomes in this population, including HIV and other sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs), mental health distress, and substance use and abuse. However, many other health 
areas remain understudied, population-based representative samples and longitudinal studies are 
lacking, and routine surveillance efforts for transgender population health are scarce. The absence 
of survey items with which to identify transgender respondents in general surveys often limits 
availability of data to estimate the magnitude of health inequities and characterize transgender 
population-level health globally. Despite limitations, there are sufficient data highlighting the 
unique biological, behavioral, social, and structural contextual factors surrounding health risks and 
resiliencies for transgender people. To mitigate these risks and foster resilience, a comprehensive 
approach is needed that includes gender affirmation as a public health framework, improved health 
systems and access to healthcare informed by high quality data, and effectively partnering with 
local transgender communities to ensure responsiveness of and cultural specificity in

Introduction

Transgender people have an assigned sex at birth different from their current gender identity 
or expression and represent a diverse population across regions and within countries 
worldwide (Sidebar 1).12 Although accurate data concerning the size of the transgender 
population globally are lacking, and population prevalence depends on transgender “case” 
definition, estimates suggest transgender identity prevalence of 0.3%−0.5% (see also White 
and colleagues Paper 1 of this issue).3 Despite small numbers, transgender people are a 
population burdened by substantial adverse health indicators across high, middle, and low 
income settings.4,5 Health inequities for transgender people are hypothesized to be 
multifactorial with risks including systematic social and economic marginalization, 
pathologization, stigma, discrimination, and violence, including healthcare systems and 
settings.6 The purpose of this data synthesis is to characterize the global health burden 
facing transgender populations, including the specific contexts and multiple determinants of 
health affecting them. Data from the peer-reviewed scientific literature were reviewed to 
characterize the burden and distribution of disease in transgender populations globally. This 
synthesis of information describes transgender population health and leverages data from 
different regions of the world to highlight the unique sex- and gender-related biological, 
behavioral, social, legal, and structural factors surrounding health risks and resiliencies for 
this underserved population. The review further seeks to inform future advocacy, funding, 
health surveillance, public health policy, monitoring, and reporting processes, and research 
initiatives to not only address and improve health, but also to promote health equity, social 
justice, and human rights, including the right of all people to self-determination.

Review and Synthesis

A review and synthesis of peer-reviewed recent literature (2008–2014) in transgender health 
was conducted. “Transgender” and associated terms (e.g., hijra, waria, travesti, trans 
masculine, MTF) were searched alongside health terms (e.g., HIV, disease, illness, mental 
health), related concepts (e.g., wellbeing), social factors (e.g., discrimination, stigma). 
Search databases included: Pubmed, Embase, OVID, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and 
ProQuest.

Inclusion criteria were: (1) any study design that included quantitative data on disease 
burden in transgender people of any age; (2) studies published between January 1, 2008-
December 20, 2014 (inclusive) to limit information to the current context for this population; 
(3) studies in English, French, and Spanish. Primary exclusion criteria were: (1) studies 
published before 2008; (2) studies appearing online ahead of print; (3) qualitative studies; 
(4) studies focused on intersex individuals; (5) studies focused on neuroanatomy or

neuropsychology; (6) clinical studies focused on gender reassignment outcomes including 
studies of sexual satisfaction and quality of life with surgical outcomes given recent reviews 
on these topics7,8; (7) studies where lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) or men who 
have sex with men (MSM) participants were not disaggregated by gender identity (unless 
data were analyzed separately and meaningful inferences could be made about transgender 
people). Due to the overall objective of obtaining epidemiological trends among transgender 
people, sources were not excluded on the basis of quality provided that they met all the 
inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria as defined above (Sidebar 2).

First and second reviewers (RM, CH) conducted parallel screening of titles found in the 
search. If either one or both reviewers selected the abstract for full article review, the article 
was pulled for full article review. If at the full article review there was a disagreement 
between the first two reviewers regarding data extraction, a third reviewer (SR) resolved the 
disagreement.

A codebook was created and refined to guide data abstraction using a collaborative 
consensus-based process among members of the author team. Health-related outcome 
categories were identified to synthesize and further organize the literature reviewed. The 
team incorporated principles from grounded theory,9 whereby codes were iteratively 
grouped into concepts and concepts into categories. Six health-related outcome categories 
emerged. Through this process in became apparent that stigma and discrimination were not 
only determinants of health (illness), but also critical outcomes in and of themselves for 
transgender populations globally.

An expert consultation with selected transgender health researchers was also conducted, and 
additional articles recommended that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included for data 
abstraction. The unique number of studies were captured, as well as the number of data 
points—for example, if an article reported on four health outcomes, it contributed four data 
points to the review. Similarly, if data were reported for specific subgroups (e.g., mental 
health prevalence estimates for trans feminine and trans masculine people separately), these 
were counted as unique data points and extracted accordingly (Sidebar 3).

Overall Research Trends

A total of 116 studies in 30 countries were identified. Table 1 presents the health outcome 
studies and key data extracted from each study (the table is organized by region, country, 
and then author). Table 2 presents health-related data on stigma, discrimination, violence/
victimization, and sex work. A map of the geographic distribution of current studies in 
transgender health is shown in Figure 1. The vast majority of research is in the United 
States. Several countries have a single study (e.g., Mexico) or between two and five studies 
(e.g., Canada, Australia, Iran). No other country except for the United States has six or more 
studies reporting data in transgender health. Indeed, for the majority of countries no data are 
available at all and for many including the content of Sub-Saharan Africa, only a single 
study exists. This gap in research is important to consider in terms of the generalizability of 
current health research across regions and geographic settings. We note a growing interest in 
transgender health research over time, particularly in most recent years in 2013 and 2014 as

shown in Figure 2. We also note a dearth of research on transgender children, adolescents 
and youth with only 15 studies.

Distribution of Studies by Sex and Gender

The distribution of studies by natal sex (e.g., sex assigned at birth) are depicted graphically 
in Figure 3. The majority of studies focus on natal males. Operationalization of 
“transgender” is inconsistent making generalization of scientific findings difficult by gender 
identity. Specifically, we found 95 distinct operationalizations of “transgender” across the 
116 studies. These can be summarized into two approaches to measuring transgender 
populations: identity-based measures (i.e., identify as transgender, FTM, MTF, trans 
masculine, trans feminine, transsexual, genderqueer; n=75/95, 78.9%) or psychiatric clinical 
diagnostic criteria such as gender identity disorder (GID) or gender dysphoria (GD) 
(n=20/95, 21.1%). The predominance of identity-based research is consistent with the trend 
toward de-pathologization of gender diversity in transgender health research.10

Summary of Methodological Limitations in Current Research

The most common study design is cross-sectional (90/116, 77.6% of studies). We note the 
dearth of longitudinal data (7/16, 6.0% of studies), and identified only a single randomized-
controlled efficacy trial of an intervention to improve the health of transgender people 
globally; two studies utilized a pre-/post-intervention design. Only three studies were 
identified that used probability-based sampling methods (3/116, 2.6%). Many studies use 
convenience sampling methods and deploy multiple sampling strategies simultaneously 
(e.g., online, venue-based, peer referral, snowball sampling). Some sampling schemes are 
more focused, for example clinic samples (29/116, 25.0%), exclusively Internet-based 
samples (17/116, 14.7%), or respondent-driven samples (8/116, 6.9%). Most studies 
(95/116, 81.9%) are descriptive, only presenting prevalence data (predominately unadjusted 
prevalences) and do not present any measures of association to examine the relationship of 
risk factors(s) and/or social determinant(s) with health outcomes. Few studies compare 
transgender and non-transgender people (e.g., offer comparative data); most are within-
group focused not allowing for documentation of health inequities.

Data Points Categorized By Health Outcome Domain

Overall 981 unique health-related data points were identified from the 116 studies. Figure 4 
presents these data points grouped into six health-related outcome categories by frequency: 
(1) mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety), (2) sexual and reproductive health (e.g., HIV, 
STIs), (3) substance use (e.g., alcohol, drugs), (4) violence/victimization (e.g., sexual, 
physical abuse), (5) stigma/ discrimination (e.g., internalized stigma, fired from 
employment), and (6) general health (e.g., diabetes, cancer). High burden of adverse health 
and disease outcomes face transgender populations globally where data are available. We 
briefly summarize data on each of the health areas below.

(1)  Mental Health

Page 5

Mental health is the most commonly studied area of transgender health (n=303 data points; 
30.9%). The majority of data points focus on mood disorders (n=96, 31.6%), suicidal and 
non-suicidal self-injury (n=50, 16.5%), and anxiety disorders (n=44, 14.5%). Mental health 
outcomes are inconsistently operationalized across studies. For example, within mood 
disorders (n=96), there are 80 data points focused on depression. Many studies of depression 
use diverse clinical screening cut-points for clinical syndromes (e.g., past week depressive 
distress assessed via Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) with 
differing cut-points), differing timeframes of assessment (e.g., lifetime depression, past week 
depressive distress, clinical diagnosis of current major depressive episode), and 
heterogeneous subpopulations of transgender people (e.g., MTF, hijra, FTM). Despite these 
limitations, data consistently show that transgender adults are burdened by mental health 
concerns. For example, depression prevalence estimates are as high as 64.2% (CESD 16+) in 
a sample of 573 transgender women11 and 63.0% (operationalized as CESD 20+) in a 
sample of 230 MTF.12 Studies using clinical diagnosis of depression rather than screeners 
show lower prevalences. For example, 31.4% in 207 MTF (% in clinical range of MMPI) in 
Amsterdam13 and 36.2% experiencing a current major depressive episode in 253 transgender 
people (both MTF and FTM) in Australia.14

Understanding risk factors for mental health problems is critical to decreasing global mental 
health morbidity, yet remarkably few studies have done so in transgender people. The 
majority of mental health research (n=161/981 data points, 53.2%) report prevalence data 
only. Measures of association between risk factors and mental health conditions are an 
important area for future research efforts. Additional gaps in mental health research include 
few studies examining PTSD or traumatic stress (n=3 data points), surprising given many 
transgender people experience violence and/or victimization (see below for summary); and 
little data on eating disorders (n=3 data points), despite body image concerns15 and the 
hypothesized relation between body image and sexual risk.16

(2)  Sexual and Reproductive Health

Sexual and reproductive health is the second most frequently studied area of transgender 
health (n=219/981 data points; 22.3%). The number of STI data points compared to other 
sexual and reproductive health data points is inflated because many studies of STIs tested for 
multiple specific organisms (e.g., gonorrhea and chlamydia), thereby creating multiple data 
points for that study. Transgender women are disproportionately impacted by HIV and other 
STIs, therefore it may not be surprising that 75% (163/219) of the sexual and reproductive 
health outcomes in the published literature include HIV or STI prevalence. However, when 
examined by assigned sex at birth, it becomes clear that this focus on HIV/STIs reflects a 
focus on transgender people assigned a male sex at birth. This also demonstrates that other 
sexual and reproductive health concerns receive little attention in research among 
transgender populations. For example, only 15 data points addressed non-infectious 
reproductive health concerns, and none addressed fertility or pregnancy.

(3)  Substance Use

Page 6

Substance use is the third most frequently studied health indicator (n=193/981 data points). 
Data more commonly focus on alcohol (n=35 data points, 18.2%), marijuana (n=25 data 
points, 13.0%), any illicit drug use (type not specified, n=16 data points, 8.3%), and tobacco 
use (n=14 data points, 7.3%). A noteworthy finding is that research on substance abuse, 
dependence, or disorder only comprises 5.2% of substance use data (n=10 data points). 
Substance use outcomes are heterogeneous and inconsistently operationalized across data 
points, including time of recall (e.g., last 30 days, last 3 months, past 6 months, last year, 
lifetime) making comparison across studies difficult. Substance use has been conceptualized 
as a coping mechanism to manage minority stress;17 however, scarce are data examining this 
association among transgender people.

(4)  Violence/Victimization

Research on violence and/or victimization experiences among transgender people faces 
methodological challenges, most commonly use of unstandardized and often non-validated 
measures of violence and victimization. Despite these limitations, research demonstrates a 
high burden of violence and/or victimization experiences in transgender people globally. 
Overall, 105 data points were identified examining violence and/or victimization in 
transgender people, 80 data points (76.2%) presenting prevalence data only. The median 
prevalence estimate for violence and/or victimization experienced is 44.0%. Violence and/or 
victimization data points were sexual (34.3%), physical (17.1%), psychological/ emotional 
(6.7%), verbal (3.8%), or type not specified (38.1%). Verbal and psychological/ emotional 
violence and victimization appear under-researched highlighting the need for studies to 
include multiple dimensions of abuse.

(5)  Stigma/ Discrimination

Only 14 articles (93 data points) in the published literature included stigma/discrimination as 
health outcomes. Of these 14 studies, the majority (n=10) were conducted in North America. 
Chile, Argentina, and Iran are the only other countries that published data on stigma/
discrimination against transgender people as health outcomes, leaving notable gaps in data 
from regions outside of North and South America. A little over half (54%) of outcomes 
specifically address stigma and discrimination in healthcare, including denial of care and 
postponement of care due to stigma. However, there remains a dearth of literature on the 
outcomes of interventions designed to reduce anti-transgender stigma and discrimination. 
Clearly, more research is needed to better understand how to address stigma and 
discrimination in order to improve healthcare access and utilization for transgender 
populations (Sidebar 4).

(6)  General Health

The general health of transgender people is the least researched aspect of the transgender 
global burden of disease. The general health category (e.g., mortality, diabetes, hormone use, 
metabolic syndrome, cancer) has the fewest data points (n=68/981 data points) with 40 
distinct health indicators (28 health indicators have only a single data point). The majority of 
research (76.5%, n=52) reports unadjusted prevalence estimates only.

Current Gaps and Opportunities

For transgender people, health inequities are hypothesized to arise from systematic exposure 
to multiple, intersecting social stressors, including legal and other structural factors that are a 
result of being part of a socially marginalized group.18 Social and economic exclusion are 
therefore conceptualized as causal pathways to adverse health—however, we found very few 
studies actually linking these social stressors to health indicators. Further, study designs are 
largely cross-sectional, limiting causal inference. Also scarce are intervention studies 
examining changes in health status alongside implementation of heath behavior or other 
social and structural change interventions to improve the lives of transgender people. Studies 
of legal issues and their impact on transgender health are needed, including research on 
structural factors relating to human rights like criminalization (related to gender identity and 
expression as well as sex work) and legal recognition.

The Way Forward: Recommendations

Below we offer recommendations based on our research synthesis to guide future health 
research focused on transgender populations.

“Count” Transgender Populations

Social determinants (e.g., age, sex, gender, race, socioeconomic status) shape health status of 
people across the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines social determinants 
of health as “the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age” and states 
explicitly that “these circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and 
resources at global, national and local levels.”19 Social inequalities resulting from social 
determinants are conceptualized as driving health inequities.20 Health inequities refer to 
avoidable, remediable, unfair health inequalities between populations.20 A social 
determinants perspective explicitly links reductions in health inequality to achievement of 
health equity.21

Health inequality monitoring refers to the systematic tracking of health inequalities over 
time, including the magnitude of disparities in the face of interventions such as policies, 
programs, and practices.22 Equity stratifiers refer to dimensions of social inequalities being 
monitored (i.e., place or residence, race or ethnicity, etc.).22 Few population-level data exist 
to monitor the health of transgender people worldwide. This is because routine national and 
international health surveillance efforts in the vast majority of countries do not assess gender 
identity as an equity stratifier. This is a major gap in furthering understanding of the health 
inequities burdening transgender people (Sidebar 5). It is also a missed opportunity to 
understand intersecting social statuses (e.g., disability status, caste) and health. There is a 
need for surveillance definitions of transgender people for global use. Studies restricting 
samples to people with diagnosed gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria do not 
capture the range of transgender people who comprise the overall population (e.g., non-
binary transgender identities).

As White and colleagues described in Paper 1 of this issue, a recommended approach to 
capturing health-related data by transgender status is to use a two-step method.3,23–25 This

method uses assigned sex at birth and current gender identity to cross-classify respondents 
as transgender (discordant sex/gender responses) or non-transgender (concordant sex/gender 
responses). It also allows for diverse gender identities to be captured. Researchers have 
operationalized the two-step method using a variety of questions and response options 
(Sidebar 6). There have also been differences in the order of question asking (sex followed 
by gender identity, or vice versa) and whether gender identity is assessed using “check one” 
or “check all” instructions. The strength of a two-step method is that it explicitly captures 
dimensions of both natal sex (sex at birth) and gender (current gender identity). It also 
permits categorization of subpopulations of transgender people by natal sex and gender 
identity. A two-step method has not been used widely across the world. Studies are needed 
in different contexts and settings that implement this approach using consistent definitions of 
transgender. We recommend that special care be taken in designing instructions and lead-in 
text for the two-step method, including adaptations for the specific geographic context in 
terms of language and cultural understandings of sex and gender. Training of interviewer 
staff and research teams are also recommended, as well as a process to confirm transgender 
responses in order to minimize misclassification bias.

Put the “Gender” Back into Transgender Health

Sex and gender are determinants of health across a wide variety of geographic contexts.
19,26–31 Causal mechanisms for poor health are both sex- and gender-related; however, sex 
and gender are commonly conflated in research.26 For example, terms referring to assigned 
sex at birth (“male” and “female”) and gender identity (“men” and “women”, respectively) 
are commonly used interchangeably in the scientific literature, including in transgender 
research. This leads to a lack of attention as to whether health differences are due to sex, 
gender, both, or neither,26 which affects understanding of health inequities. Synthesizing 
research on the health of transgender people reveals gaps in the specificity and 
operationalization of sex and gender differences in population research more broadly.

Developing new conceptual models and integrating and testing existing frameworks is 
needed to guide research in transgender population health. Several conceptual models have 
been applied to transgender health, including social determinants and social ecological 
models,19,32 gender affirmation,33 gender minority stress,17,34,35 syndemic production,36 
and health and human rights.2,37 These models overlap in their shared recognition that 
multiple and intersecting levels of risk and resiliency shape the health of transgender people 
and that, therefore, multilevel contextually-relevant interventions are necessary. However, 
these models do not apply a gender analysis,26 a social epidemiologic approach that 
explicitly considers socially derived gender exposures and outcomes, sex-linked 
physiological or biological differences, and the interplay of both gender and sex.26,38–40 
Transgender people share many of the same risks and social and structural determinants of 
disease, health, and wellbeing as non-transgender people (e.g., socioeconomic status). 
However, transgender people also experience unique biological, behavioral, social, and 
structural contextual factors surrounding health risks and resiliencies—including those 
related to challenging the congruence or conflation of sex and gender such as legal 
recognition of gender identity. We therefore recommend that future research in transgender 
population health use a gendered situated vulnerabilities framework to investigate whether

Gendered situated vulnerabilities refer to the ways in which health is shaped by the 
distribution of power along lines of gender.41,42 The vulnerabilities transgender people face 
vis a vis health are related to challenging gendered relations of power and policing of gender 
by social structures. We refer to these as situated because the health risks and resiliencies 
facing transgender populations cannot be understood devoid of the multilevel sexed and 
gendered contexts which shape them. We use the term vulnerabilities to describe the ways 
that these contexts put transgender people “at risk for risk.”43,44 We do not conceptualize 
transgender people as an inherently vulnerable population; but rather, view this community 
as a population facing sex- and gender-related situated vulnerabilities for different health 
conditions. As shown in the synthesis of current research, some of the health conditions 
differentially distributed by transgender status include mental health, infectious diseases, and 
substance use and abuse.

Integrate Health and Human Rights and Multi-Sectorial Approaches

Transgender people have the right to legal recognition of their gender identity, access to 
gender affirmation, and a right to self-determination and autonomy.45–48 Although the Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights denounces widespread discrimination against 
transgender people,6 systematic social and economic marginalization, stigma, 
pathologization, discrimination, violence, and other human rights violations, including in 
healthcare, continue to drive and/or exacerbate health inequities. Improving the health and 
access to healthcare of transgender people globally requires a wide array of stakeholders and 
mobilizing diverse multi-sector partnerships. Many barriers to healthcare and adverse health 
risks are addressable through law and policy, which some countries have begun to address 
through gender identity laws, legislation regarding gender affirmative care, anti-
discrimination and protective measures. For example, in 2012 the Argentinian Senate passed 
the first gender identity law in the world authorizing transgender people to change their legal 
gender markers with the only requirement being a simple administrative process, with 
improved access to hormonal treatments and/or surgical procedures that only requires 
informed consent (as per standards of care endorsed by the World Professional Association 
for Transgender Health; WPATH),49,50 and under governmental coverage.51 Evaluation of 
the effect of these legal changes and improvements on the health of transgender people is 
needed. Implementation science, an emerging domain of methods aiming to harness 
generalizable information that can inform the effectiveness of programs and policies,52 is 
well-suited for such evaluations.

Transgender health research is not without challenges. Public health researchers must work 
together with policymakers, healthcare providers, and communities and their political 
organizations to address systematic institutionalized marginalization. In general, social, 
ethnical, and psychological aspects of research are not considered “high” on the hierarchy of 
evidence-for-practice.53,54 This is compounded by challenges of researching a discriminated 
population where there is institutionalized censure, and in some cases criminalization, of not 
only transgender communities themselves, but the researchers and clinicians who engage

with them. In most countries, transgender is not included in formal training curricula for 
medicine, epidemiology, public health, education, legal, and social service systems, shaping 
a poor foundation for research and core competency in transgender health. Integrating public 
health practice, research, education, advocacy, and funding is critical to address the health 
needs of transgender people and their allies seeking to understand and ameliorate 
transgender health disparities.

Engage Transgender People: A Participatory Population Perspective

Within transgender communities, immediate survival needs may supersede perceived health 
risks and undermine traditional research approaches—i.e., research may seem to have little 
meaning and relevance to people’s lives. Poverty, food insecurity, mobility, and security 
issues may affect research participation and attrition rates, as may intersectional issues of 
sex work, refugee status, and homelessness. Inclusion of transgender people in public health 
efforts and working with the local community and its political organizations in each 
geographic area to advance transgender health and human rights agendas is essential. The 
use of a “participatory population perspective”55 and community-based participatory 
research principles56 represent an important future step to ensure health-related research and 
interventions are responsive to the real-life issues transgender people face. This means 
conducting research “with” and not “on” transgender populations,57 as well as being 
transparent in methodological sections of research articles about whether and how 
transgender communities were engaged in the research process. Meaningful engagement of 
transgender people will ensure research is culturally specific to local community needs, 
research questions and surveys are gender-affirming, and the science (e.g., study design, 
sampling) is appropriately aligned with and feasible for the study population.

Limitations of the Review

Given the lack of definitional consistency within research among transgender populations, 
conducting a synthesis of transgender population health requires a complex set of diverse 
search terms and key words to accurately identify the current health research (See Web 
Appendix for protocol). Notably, the term “transgender” was only recently added to 
PubMED as a MeSH term in 2013. From 2001–2012, “transsexualism” was the index term. 
In the U.S., the phrase gender minority has been used to describe transgender people to be 
inclusive of a broad array of diverse gender identities, not just people who self-identify as 
transgender.1 “Gender minority” is currently not indexed. We recommend that it be added as 
a MeSH term.

Some data characterizing transgender populations did not satisfy the objectives of the 
review. Data describing sexual satisfaction or quality of life were not included because these 
measures are often reported in clinical studies of gender reassignment surgical outcomes. 
While the focus here was on public health studies, we refer readers to recent review papers 
of gender reassignment outcomes.7,8 Studies examining neuroanatomical or 
neuropsychological differences between transgender populations were excluded. These data 
are critical, especially as new surgical procedures are developed, but they are also outside of

the scope of the current review on the global burden of disease in transgender people from a 
public health perspective.

A noteworthy limitation of this synthesis pertains to reporting data at the level of data points 
in some instances, rather than reporting at the study level. This could inflate some estimates 
reported (i.e., studies with more data points contribute more data). Thus, the count of data 
points presented in this review is not to be interpreted as a measure of the quality of data. We 
also excluded qualitative studies which are a rich source of inquiry.

This review was limited to peer-reviewed literature. Many non-peer reviewed sources from 
the World Health Organization, Pan American Health Organization, Public Health Agency 
of Canada, UNAIDS, Centers for Disease Control, and additional health agencies and 
organizations including grassroots community-based needs assessments provide invaluable 
data. Partnerships between community members and researchers to collect data represent an 
important step in improving future transgender health research worldwide.

Conclusions

The global disease and health burden of transgender people remain understudied, 
particularly in relation to the impact of stigma, discrimination, social, and structural factors 
that affect the health of this underserved population.48 Lack of standardized survey items to 
identify transgender respondents limits existing health surveillance efforts. Lack of 
consistent operationalization of transgender status across studies limits generalizability of 
findings. Using a two-step approach to standardize data collection in health—modified for 
the specific geographic context, language, and locale—will allow researchers, policymakers, 
and transgender people themselves to add to monitor and evaluate efforts to achieve health 
equity. Measuring sex and gender dimensions in health research will contribute to 
understanding and ameliorating health inequities for all.

Despite substantial gaps in empirical research, there are sufficient actionable data 
highlighting unique biological, behavioral, social, and structural contextual factors 
surrounding health risks and resiliencies for transgender people that need interventions.48 
Studies are needed that conceptually integrate and examine transgender-specific social 
determinants of health, including incorporating a framework of gendered situated 
vulnerabilities. A comprehensive public health approach including access to gender 
affirmation (social, medical, legal), improved health systems informed by high quality data, 
and effectively partnering with local transgender communities to ensure responsiveness of 
and cultural specificity of programming represents an important next step. Dedicated 
funding to ensure consistency of definitions for health surveillance and research initiatives 
involving transgender people are essential to inform evidence-based decisions regarding the 
scale and content of programs. Multisector partnerships that integrate health and human 
rights represent a critical next step to advance social justice and ultimately the health of 
transgender people worldwide.

Sidebar: Gender Affirmation is Multi-Level

Gender affirmation is not just individual-level—it is a concept that can be applied to 
healthcare systems and structural, macro-level factors through a social ecological model.
26 For example, gender affirming healthcare refers to care that is sensitive, responsive, 
and affirming to people’s genders. Healthcare systems and models of care need to 
consider social, psychological, medical, and legal dimensions of people’s lives in 
delivery of care.

Sidebar: Gender Affirmation and Health and Human Rights

Gender affirmation is a human right.27,28 According to Sevelius (2013), outcomes from 
lacking gender affirmation can take the form of violence (including sexual violence), 
experiences of discrimination, and harassment.8 The International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights adopted in 1966 by the United Nations General Assembly, with170 state 
parties, has been a foundation of global human rights law,29 with the main objective that 
“all peoples have the right of self-determination,” the right to human dignity, and equality 
under the law. Two decades prior, in 1948 United Nations adopted the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), widely recognized as one of the most influential 
statements on human rights.30 The 2011 Annual report of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and 
the Secretary-General acknowledges that transgender people experience high rates of 
violence, discrimination and denial of rights as a result of their gender identity or 
expression.31 The UN report further describes instances of discriminatory laws including 
state-sponsored violence against transgender people across the globe.

Despite clear inclusion of transgender people in the UN, nations outside the UN, the 
Vatican, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the United States have routinely

opposed global measures to protect sexual orientation and gender identity.32 In the 
United States, only eighteen states plus the District of Columbia have non-discrimination 
policies, and eight states have interpreted these protections to prohibit discrimination of 
transition-related healthcare in private and/or state-sponsored health insurance.33 In 
contrast, as early as 1972, Sweden became the first in the world to allow transgender 
people to legally change their gender, and access accessible hormone therapy. In a more 
sweeping decision, in 2006, the European Union recast its definition of sex equality to 
include transgender people,34 whereby it was formerly only implicitly covered via legal 
precedent. With denial of human rights leading to discrimination, stress, sexual risk-
taking, codified gender affirmation may result in reduced discrimination, and better 
health outcomes for transgender and other gender minority people.32 Integrating health 
and human rights is essential for transgender public health.35,36

Sidebar: A Call for Health Equity

Health differences are not necessarily inequities.37–39 In a social determinants of health 
framework, health inequities involve a health difference produced by injustice or social 
oppression—by a power differential between groups with less disadvantage compared to 
groups with advantage. Documenting and understanding population-level health 
inequities by transgender status necessitates having comparative data. Without 
comparative data, it is inaccurate to state that “transgender people are disproportionately 
burdened by or experience an inequity in depression.” A study consisting of a sample of 
exclusively transgender people allows examination of within-group health indicators. 
Thus, findings can indicate that “transgender people bear a high burden of depression” or 
that “depression is highly prevalent among transgender people sampled.” Without a 
comparison group, such within-group data are not sufficient evidence of a health inequity 
per say (particularly when prevalence estimates are not age-adjusted). Monitoring health 
inequities requires comparative data to understand the distribution of disease in 
transgender people relative to non-transgender people, as well as the opportunity to 
unpack the mechanisms and pathways (i.e., mediators and potential intervention points) 
that cause poor health differentially by gender identity.

Sidebar: Sex and Gender as Social Determinants of Population Health

Understanding sex and gender pathways to health means attending to the biological, 
psychological, social, structural, and behavioral dimensions that shape embodied sex and 
gender differences—assigned sex at birth, gender identity, gender expression, 
embodiment, gender roles, and other relevant dimensions that may influence individual 
health and wellbeing and contribute to population-level health inequities. Gender is 
multidimensional.40 Gender pathways to health are multilevel, socio-historically and 
culturally-dependent, and dynamically change over time. Dimensions of gender affect 
people’s health and wellbeing at multiple levels of influence.41 Understanding gender as 
a population determinant of health for ALL people, means not only conceptualizing and 
measuring different dimensions of gender—including the gendering of the actual material 
body itself—but also considering the dynamic nature of gender, including that: 1) sex and

gender are not the same, a distinction particularly important in examining transgender 
people’s health;42 2) gender is relational (i.e., “a person’s gender is not simply an aspect 
of what one is, but, more fundamentally, it is something that one does, and does 
recurrently, in interaction with others” (p. 140);43 and 3) gender is fundamental to the 
social structuring of power and privilege.44,45 A social ecological model integrating 
gender analysis examines how sex and gender influence individual, interpersonal, 
organizational, community and public policy levels can shed light on sex- and gender-
related embodiment pathways producing population-level health inequities.

Sidebar: Gender Minority Stress

Building on social stress theories,46−49 a gender minority stress framework has been used 
to conceptualize adverse health outcomes that burden transgender people.50−52 This 
framework posits that experiences of social stress disproportionately affect transgender 
people relative to non-transgender people due to a disadvantaged social status and are 
largely responsible for health inequities. Such a framework integrates vulnerabilities at 
multiple levels of influence through which social processes become embedded in, and 
fundamentally shape, biological health outcomes. The distribution of power and capital 
along lines of gender as well as the social, economic, and psychological consequences of 
making visible the false conflation of sex and gender situate transgender people in 
stigmatized minority group. Stressors such as experiences of discrimination, stigma, 
violence and victimization, social and economic exclusion are all too common among 
transgender people.

Sidebar: Resilience: A Public Health Opportunity

Health-promoting, salutogenic, and resilience-related factors that may be protective for 
health risks in transgender populations are grossly under-studied.53 Deficits-based 
models permeate existing public health research. Positive growth-fostering coping 
processes may mitigate health inequities by transgender status. Health promotion will 
benefit from integrating salutogenic and resilience-focused (i.e., strengths-based 
frameworks) into public health approaches for transgender people. Multi-level strategies 
that integrate evidence-based biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions, and 
that attend to the gender minority stressors that lead to health risk and vulnerability, as 
well as resiliencies, are required to successfully address the health needs of transgender 
people.

Definitions: Transgender People

Transgender people have a current gender identity or expression that is different from 
their sex assigned at birth. Gender minority was introduced in 2011 as part of the 
landmark Institute of Medicine report commissioned by the U.S. National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) entitled, The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People: 
Building a Foundation for Better Understanding.1 Gender minority is meant to be an 
inclusive umbrella term which includes people who may identify as transgender or have 
other diverse genders. Transgender people have diverse sexual orientation identities, 
attractions, and behaviors.

Differentiating Transgender People from People Who are Intersex

Intersex people/people with Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) [or in community 
terms Diverse Sexual Development (DSD)2] are those born with bodies that vary from 
both male and female bioanatomies, including chromosomes, gonads, genitals and/or 
other secondary sex characteristics. Some intersex/DSD people consider themselves to be 
transgender; however, most do not. This research synthesis does not include a review of 
intersex/DSD research. This is because many primary issues in intersex/DSD health are 
different from those of transgender people (i.e., infant genitoplasty and gonadectomy, 
ongoing care for intersex/DSD adults, iatrogenic effects of genital surgery and gonad 
removal, etc.).3−7 The heterogeneity and complexity of Intersex/DSD health warrants its 
own research synthesis which is beyond the scope of the current paper.

Evolving Terminologies

In public health research, transgender populations are categorized according to assigned 
sex at birth and gender identity. This is because some health indicators (e.g., prostate 
health), are only applicable for people assigned a male sex at birth. Trans feminine refers 
to transgender people assigned a male sex at birth who are on the transgender spectrum—
identifying as women, female, male-to-female (MTF), transgender women, trans women, 
and many other diverse gender minority identities across the world (e.g., hijra, kathoey, 
travestis, waria). Trans masculine describes transgender people assigned a female sex at 
birth who are on the transgender spectrum—identifying as men, male, female-to-male 
(FTM), transgender men, trans men, and many other diverse gender minority identities 
(genderqueer, stud, aggressive, Sadhin). Greater attention to non-binary genders is 
needed in research, including transgender people who do not identify as feminine or 
masculine, or who integrate both. Transgender people exist all over the world. Definitions 
and terminology continue to dynamically evolve to describe the population across 
different local, national, and global contexts.

Gender Affirmation: A Key Determinant of Transgender Health

A key social determinant of health for transgender populations worldwide is gender 
affirmation. Gender affirmation has been defined as an interpersonal and shared process 
through which a person’s gender identity is socially recognized.8−10 However, gender 
affirmation is not only social—social recognition of gender also involves other 
institutions such as healthcare and law. Gender affirmation can thus be conceptualized as 
having four core facets: social (e.g., name, pronoun), psychological (e.g., internal, felt 
self), medical (e.g., cross-sex hormones, surgical intervention, other body modification), 
and legal (e.g., legal gender markers, name change). Gender affirmation depends on a 
variety of factors—including context and setting (i.e., country and region) and issues 
relating to accessibility of cross-sex hormones (in terms of availability of medications, 
accessibility to culturally competent healthcare providers), socioeconomics and poverty, 
criminalization of sexual and gender minorities, legal barriers to changing gender 
markers and identity recognition, etc. There is not a single path to gender affirmation—
no “one size fits all” approach describes how transgender people affirm and embody their 
gender.11 Some people may socially, but not medically, affirm their gender; others may 
socially and medically but not legally do so. Gender affirmation sometimes, but not 
always conforms to binary categories of being female or male. Non-binary refers to 
having a transgender identity that does not utilize female or male dichotomies as 
reference points.

The Right to Inclusion in Health Surveillance

A first-line argument made for non-inclusion of measures to identify transgender people 
in routine health surveillance efforts has been the small population size. How large is the 
transgender population globally? It depends how the population is measured. Over the 
past 15 or so years there has been a paradigm shift in transgender health from a disease-
based model (transgender as disorder or mental health “diagnosis”) to an identity-based 
model (transgender as identity).11,12 (Please see Paper 1 for history and details). 
Conceptualizing transgender people as having diverse, non-pathological genders rather 
than as “disordered” re-defines how a “case” is operationalized and measured in health 
research.13 Such re-definition of a “case” also necessarily affects prevalence estimates as 
to the number of transgender people in the world and, potentially, estimation of the 
distribution, burden, and magnitude of disease inequity in the population. Still, most 
conservative estimates suggest 0.1%−0.5% of the world population may be transgender.
14,15 Assuming the world population is approximately 7 billion people,16 this is an 
estimated 7 to 35 million transgender people globally. That said, does the number of 
transgender people matter in a population so grossly underserved worldwide?

Example of Two-Step Method in Data Collection

Standardization of data collection to routinely monitor health and disease distribution 
among transgender people represents a critical step. A two-step method is recommended,
17−20 including by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).
21 Appropriate adaptations to the two-step method are needed in different geographic 
regions, cultures, and languages.

Reisner and colleagues (2014) implemented the two-step method in the Growing Up 
Today Study (GUTS), a U.S. prospective cohort of >16,000 youth enrolled in 1996.22 
Step 1 asked: “What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate? 
(check one)” with response options “female” and “male.” Step 2 asked: “How do you 
describe yourself? (check one)” with response options “female”, “male”, “transgender”, 
“do not identify as female, male, or transgender.” Cross-tabulating these questions gives a 
two by four (2×4) contingency table with eight cells demonstrating different sex and 
gender combinations. Overall, 0.33% of the cohort self-identified as transgender or 
another gender minority in 2010.

Table.

Data on Transgender People from the U.S. Growing 
Up Today Study (GUTS).

Adding these cells results in overall prevalence of Transgender.

The two-step approach can help to not only understand population size and health 
inequities facing transgender people, but can also aide in explicit consideration of sex and 
gender differences more broadly—and health inequities that may be due to assigned sex, 
current gender, both, or neither. The two-step method thus facilitates a gender analysis in 
population health.23−25

Key Messages

A comprehensive public health approach to address the health of transgender 
people requires ensuring access to gender affirmation, evidence-based 
healthcare delivery systems, and effective partnerships with local transgender 
communities.

The health-related vulnerabilities among transgender people underscore the 
need to explicitly consider sex and gender pathways and mechanisms in 
epidemiologic research and public health surveillance more broadly.

Multi-sector partnerships linking health with advocacy, social justice, and 
human rights are critical to address the public health needs of transgender 
people across the world.

Lack of standardized survey items on population-based surveys to identify 
transgender respondents limits existing public health surveillance efforts and 
availability of representative samples.

The global disease and health burden of transgender people remains 
understudied, particularly the impact of stigma, discrimination, violence, and 
other social and structural factors that affect the health of this underserved 
population, as well as interventions to mitigate stigma.

Despite substantial gaps in empirical research, there are sufficient actionable 
data highlighting unique biological, behavioral, social, and structural 
contextual factors surrounding health risks and resiliencies for transgender 
people that need interventions.

Consistency of definitions for health surveillance and research initiatives that 
include transgender people are essential, including dedicated funding to 
support these efforts.
