Despite   a  general   decline   in   late  life   suicide   rates   over   the   last  30   years,   older   people   have   the   highest   rates
of  suicide   in  most   countries.   In  contrast,   non-fatal   suicidal   behaviour   declines   with   age   and   more   closely
resembles   suicide   than   in   younger   age   groups.   There   are   difﬁculties   in   the   detection   and   determination
of   pathological   suicidal   ideation   in   older   people.   Multiple   factors   increase   suicide   risk   ranging   from   distal
early   and   mid-life   issues   such   as   child   abuse,   parental   death,   substance   misuse   and   traumatic   life   expe-
riences   to  proximal   precipitants   in   late   life   such   as   social  isolation   and   health-related   concerns.   Clinical
depression   is   the   most   frequently   identiﬁed   proximal   mental   health   concern   and   in   many   cases   is  a  ﬁrst
episode   of  major   depression.   Recent   studies   have   identiﬁed   changes   on  neuroimaging   and   neurocogni-
tive   factors   that   might   distinguish   suicidal   from   non-suicidal   depression   in   older   people.   Strategies   for
suicide   prevention   need   to  be  ‘whole   of  life’  and,   as   no   single   prevention   strategy   is   likely   to  be   suc-
cessful   alone,   a  multi-faceted,   multi-layered   approach   is  required.   This   should   include   optimal   detection
and   management   of   depression   and   of  high   risk   individuals   as  available   evidence   indicates   that   this   can
reduce   suicidal   behaviour.   How   best   to  improve   the   quality   of   depression   management   in   primary   and
secondary   care   requires   further   research.

Research 

In  2013  it  was  estimated  that  8.2%  of  the  world  population  was
aged  65  years  and  over,  yet  around  17%  of  suicide  deaths  reported
to  the  World  Health  Organization  were  recorded  in  this  age  group
[1,2].  However,  suicide  only  accounts  for  a  small  proportion  of
deaths  in  older  people;  in  contrast  it  is  among  the  three  leading
causes  of  death  in  those  aged  15–44  [1].  Self  harm  was   ranked  13th
in  the  all-age  global  causes  of  death  in  the  2010  Global  Burden  of
Disease  study,  but  in  old  age  it  was  ranked  much  lower  to  be  17th
at  age  60–64  and  by  age  80  years  and  over  it  was  ranked  32nd  [3].
treatment  and  prevention  of  suicidal
behaviour  in  old  age  is  limited  but  there  has  long  been  broad  agree-
ment  about  many  risk  factors  [4].  Depression  and  social  isolation
are  the  most  consistent  ﬁndings  as  independent  risk  factors  for  sui-
cidal  behaviour  and  these  are  often  the  factors  that  contribute  to
older  people  having  problems  in  coping  with  the  impacts  of  physi-
cal  ill  health  and  functional  impairment,  particularly  in  individuals
who  are  challenged  in  their  adaption  to  ageing  due  to  rigid,  obses-
sional,  or  anxious  personality  traits  [5].  Rapid  population  ageing
worldwide  and  the  recognition  that  factors  associated  with  sui-
cidal  behaviour  vary  across  the  life  cycle  are  drawing  attention  to
this  deﬁcit.

the 

This  review  examines  suicidal  behaviour  in  late  life  with  a
focus  on  recent  research  developments.  Systematic  reviews  and
book  chapters  on  late  life  suicidal  behaviour  published  since  2007
were  supplemented  by  a  search  of  Medline,  PsycInfo  and  Embase
databases  from  2007  to  2013  using  keywords  (suicide,  deliberate
self  harm,  suicide  ideation,  attempted  suicide,  old,  elderly,  old  age).

2.  Epidemiology  of  suicidal  behaviour  in  late  life

Over  the  last  30  years  an  overall  reduction  in  suicide  rates  in
older  people  has  been  recorded  [6].  Non-fatal  suicidal  behaviour
declines  with  age  and  more  closely  resembles  suicide  than  in
younger  age  groups,  having  high  levels  of  lethal  intent,  less  impuls-
ivity,  and  clinical  features  that  are  similar  to  those  found  in  suicide
[7,8].

The  prevalence  of  suicidal  ideation  in  old  age  varies  across
studies  with  the  distinction  between  normal  thoughts  of  death
associated  with  ageing  and  common  life  events  not  adequately
delineated  from  those  that  reﬂect  psychopathology  and  increased
suicide  risk  [4].  Recent  studies  illustrate  this.  In  a  study  of  general
practice  patients  aged  60  years  and  over,  the  presence  of  suicidal
ideation  was  associated  with  nearly  34  times  increased  risk  of
attempted  suicide  in  the  previous  year  [9].  A  study  of  97-year  olds
found  that  77%  of  those  acknowledging  suicidal  feelings  did  not
meet  criteria  for  depression  [10]  and  a  qualitative  study  found  that
older  people  with  a  wish  to  die  originally  developed  thoughts  about
death  as  a  positive  solution  to  life  events  or  adverse  circumstances
[11].  There  is  also  evidence  that  suicidal  thoughts  in  older  people
are  associated  with  increased  risk  of  mortality  by  natural  causes
[12].

Some  pathways  for  late  life  suicidal  behaviour  begin  early  in
life  and  it  is  often  the  interaction  of  distal  with  proximal  factors
that  provides  the  lethal  mix.  There  is  limited  understanding  of  how
factors  interact  to  determine  risk  in  an  individual  [13].  The  motiva-
tions  that  drive  the  ﬁnal  suicidal  act  are  quite  varied  and  access  to
an  acceptable  lethal  means  plays  a  critical  role  [14].

3.  Demographic  factors

Males  have  higher  suicide  rates  than  females  across  the  life-
span  and  with  advancing  age  the  male  to  female  ratio  increases
[14].  Females  are  at  higher  risk  of  non-fatal  suicidal  behaviour  than

males  but  rates  tend  to  converge  with  advancing  age  [5].  The  evi-
dence  is  inconsistent  about  whether  suicidal  behaviour  is  more
common  in  those  that  are  divorced  or  widowed  [6,14].

There  is  heterogeneity  of  suicide  rates  between  countries  and
ethnicity  appears  to  be  a  factor  with  different  suicide  rates  of  eth-
nic  groups  within  multicultural  societies  [6].  There  is  also  regional
variation  within  countries  with  higher  rates  reported  in  rural  areas
of  some  countries  [13].

4.  Early  life  factors

Childhood  adversity,  which  includes  physical  and  sexual  abuse,
parental  neglect  through  death,  separation  and  inadequate  care,
and  traumatic  life  experiences  such  as  the  Holocaust,  increases  the
risk  of  suicidal  behaviour  and  mental  disorders  across  the  life  cycle
[6,7,13].  Genetic  factors  contribute  to  suicide  risk  by  mediating
transmission  of  impulsive  aggression  or  neuroticism  and  neurocog-
nitive  deﬁcits  [15].

5.  Personality  traits

Personality  traits  are  associated  with  increased  suicide  risk
with  the  most  consistent  ﬁnding  being  increased  neuroticism  [13],
although  this  is  less  than  in  middle-aged  suicides  [16].  Neuroticism
might  be  a  proxy  for  undetected  depression  in  some  individuals
and  this  is  supported  by  one  study  which  found  that  the  high
level  of  neuroticism  in  older  suicide  attempters  did  not  remain
after  adjustments  were  made  for  major  depression  [17].  Anankas-
tic  (obsessional)  and  ‘low  openness  to  experience’  traits  have  also
been  reported;  such  individuals  are  comfortable  with  the  familiar
and  have  a  constricted  range  of  interests  leading  to  difﬁculties  in
coping  with  the  challenges  related  to  ageing  [13].

6.  Neurobiological  factors

Earlier  studies 

in  older  people  reporting 

increased  sui-
risk  with  serotonergic  neurotransmitter  abnormalities,
cide 
non-suppression  of  the  dexamethasone  suppression  test,  and
(cid:2)4  (ApoE4)  carrier  status  have  not  been  replicated
apolipoprotein  E 
[13].

Older  depressives  with  a  history  of  suicide  attempts  are  more
likely  to  show  cerebral  atrophic  changes  than  those  without  a  his-
tory  of  suicide  attempts,  with  one  case–control  MRI   study  ﬁnding
widespread  but  discrete  cortical  and  subcortical  volume  reduction
[18]  and  a  second  study  showing  more  discrete  striatal  lesions,
particularly  in  the  putamen  [19].  More  recently  a  functional  MRI
case–control  study  reported  that  impulsivity  and  a  history  of  sui-
cide  attempts  were  associated  with  a  weakened  expected  reward
signal  in  the  paralimbic  cortex  [20].  Larger  studies  are  required  to
further  elucidate  these  ﬁndings.

7.  Neurocognitive  factors

Impulsive  suicide  attempts  have  long  been  reported  in  older
people  with  frontal  executive  dysfunction  secondary  to  early
dementia  or  mild  cognitive  disorders  [13].  Most  research  into  cog-
nitive  function,  however,  has  focussed  on  older  people  with  major
depression  with  and  without  a  history  of  suicide  attempts.  In  a
preliminary  investigation  for  a  series  of  case–control  studies,  poor
performance  on  tests  of  executive  function,  attention,  and  mem-
ory  were  found  to  be  associated  with  suicidal  behaviour  in  older
people  with  major  depression  [21].  Subsequent  ﬁndings  distin-
guishing  older  depressed  suicide  attempters  from  those  without
a  history  of  suicidal  behaviour  included  a  perception  of  life  prob-
lems  as  threatening  and  unsolvable  and  an  impulsive  approach  to

problem  solving  [22]  and  a  tendency  to  ignore  past  experiences
and  neglect  outcome  probability  when  making  decisions  that  are
overly  present-focused  [23,24].  A  second  research  group  found  that
older  depressed  suicide  attempters  have  worse  cognitive  inhibi-
tion  performance,  especially  on  the  motor  component,  than  their
non-suicidal  depressed  counterparts  and  this  inability  to  inhibit
intrusive  information  may   predispose  to  suicide  attempts  [25].
There  is  also  an  inability  to  inhibit  neutral  information  access  to
working  memory  and  delete  irrelevant  information  which  may
impair  the  capacity  to  respond  adequately  to  stressful  situations
[26].

These  cognitions  may   also  interact  with  perceived  burdensome-
ness,  a  component  of  the  interpersonal-psychological  theory  of
suicide,  which  mediates  the  relation  between  depression  and  sui-
cide  ideation,  accounting  for  over  two  thirds  of  the  variance  in
suicide  ideation,  even  after  predictors  such  as  depressive  symp-
toms,  hopelessness,  and  functional  impairment  are  controlled
[27,28].  Together  these  cognitive  factors  may   precipitate  and  per-
petuate  a  suicidal  crisis  in  depressed  older  people.

8.  Physical  health  and  disability

Physical  health  is  a  contributory  factor  in  most  cases  of  late
life  suicidal  behaviour  [13].  Vascular  disease  may   predispose  to
late  onset  depression  and  this  often  has  midlife  antecedents  such
as  hypertension,  smoking,  diabetes  and  metabolic  syndrome.  A
case–control  of  suicides  over  age  50  years  found  that  cerebrovas-
cular  risk  factor  scores  were  signiﬁcantly  higher  in  suicide  cases
[29].  It  is  unclear  whether  physical  illness  has  an  independent  effect
upon  suicide  risk  and  studies  are  inconsistent  about  the  role  of
speciﬁc  illnesses  [13].  Some  physical  illnesses  including  cancers
and  thyroid  disorders  can  cause  depression  and  these  might  not  be
detected  until  after  a  suicide  attempt.  Chronic  pain,  breathlessness
and  functional  impairment  are  frequently  reported  health  fea-
tures  [13],  with  one  study  ﬁnding  that  the  risk  of  suicidal  ideation
increased  with  pain  severity  and  lack  of  pain  control,  particularly  in
men   [30].  Psychological  reactions  may   result  in  some  people  feeling
overwhelmed  by  their  health  problems.  Physical  vulnerability  also
increases  the  risk  that  an  older  person  will  succumb  to  a  suicide
attempt.  For  example,  an  analysis  of  suicide  attempts  recorded  in
the  National  Trauma  Data  Bank  in  the  United  States  from  1995  to
2002  found  that  mortality  was  higher  in  older  people  [31].

Medications  such  as  anticonvulsants  and  sedative/hypnotics  are
also  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  self-injurious  behaviour
[32,33].

9.  Psychosocial  factors

Loss  of  social  connectedness  increases  suicide  risk  independent
of  the  presence  of  mental  disorders  [5,34].  Family  discord  is  per-
haps  the  most  important  factor  [14].  In  many  cases  the  problems
are  chronic  and  males  may   be  more  vulnerable  [14].  Other  life
events  particularly  those  involving  loss  including  recent  bereave-
ment  and  ﬁnancial  problems  have  been  implicated  in  late  life
suicidal  behaviour  [7,14,35].  Low  socio-economic  status  is  a  risk
factor  worldwide  [14,35].

Living  alone  has  consistently  been  identiﬁed  and  this  is  often
regarded  as  a  proxy  for  loneliness,  social  isolation,  and  lack  of
perceived  social  support  [5,7,14].  It  has  been  suggested  that  sui-
cide  rates  are  lower  in  Western  European  countries  where  older
people  live  with  their  families  more  often  and  where  there  are  less
ageist  societal  attitudes  than  exist  in  Eastern  European  countries
[36].  Spending  too  little  time  with  children  and  grandchildren  is
associated  with  suicide  attempts  [37].

Accommodation  issues  including  fear  of  nursing  home  place-
ment  and  dissatisfaction  with  living  arrangements  are  also  reported
[7,14].  It  is  unclear  whether  the  suicide  rate  in  nursing  homes  is
different  to  the  general  population  but  the  main  clinical  features
of  depression  and  physical  disability  are  the  same  [13,14].  Indirect
self  destructive  behaviour  including  refusal  to  eat,  drink,  or  take
medications  is  common  in  nursing  home  residents  and  while  most
cases  appear  to  be  associated  with  severe  dementia  rather  than
depression  with  suicidal  intent,  there  are  some  suicidal  individuals
[13].

10.  Previous  suicidal  behaviour

Compared  with  younger  age  groups,  a  history  of  suicidal
behaviour  is  less  frequent  in  older  persons  but  follow  up  studies  of
older  suicide  attempters  have  found  high  rates  of  repetition  [14].
For  example,  a  prospective,  population-based  self-harm  cohort  of
1177  older  adults  presenting  with  self-harm  to  six  general  hospi-
tals  in  three  cities  in  England  found  12.8%  repeated  self-harm  and
1.5%  died  by  suicide  within  12  months.  Independent  risk  factors  for
repetition  were  previous  self-harm,  previous  psychiatric  treatment
and  age  60–74  years.  The  risk  of  suicide  was   67  times  that  of  older
adults  in  the  general  population  [38].

11.  Psychiatric  disorder

Although  psychiatric  disorder  is  prominent  in  late  life  suicide,
with  one  review  of  controlled  psychological  autopsy  studies  ﬁnd-
ing  that  the  presence  of  any  Axis  I  disorder  being  associated  with
an  elevated  risk  of  suicide  in  older  persons  with  signiﬁcant  odds
ratios  ranging  from  27.4  to  113.1  [5],  absence  of  psychiatric  disor-
der  appears  to  increase  with  age  [39–41].  It  is  unclear  whether  this
represents  an  accurate  ﬁnding  as  an  alternative  possibility  is  that  it
reﬂects  difﬁculties  in  identiﬁcation  of  depression  in  older  people.
Major  depression  is  the  main  psychiatric  disorder  found  and
although  many  cases  are  recurrent  episodes,  ﬁrst  episode  major
depression  is  prominent  [5,7,13,41,42].  Late  onset  depression  may
have  more  life  events  and  less  psychiatric  comorbidity  including
alcohol  misuse  than  in  early  onset  depression  [43].  Other  types  of
depression  often  occur  in  association  with  comorbid  chronic  phys-
ical  ill  health,  cognitive  impairment  and  disability  [7,13,14].

Although  suicide  risk  associated  with  psychoses  such  as
schizophrenia  and  bipolar  disorder  is  increased  in  late  life  [44],
the  risk  is  lower  than  in  younger  adults  [42].  The  role  of  anxi-
ety  disorders,  including  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  is  unclear
with  some  studies  ﬁnding  an  increased  risk  though  it  seems  usu-
ally  in  the  context  of  mixed  anxiety/depressive  states  [5,13,45].  In
one  large  population-based  study  from  Denmark,  the  highest  risk
of  suicide  was  in  those  hospitalised  with  a  reaction  to  stress  and
adjustment  disorder  [42].  This  is  consistent  with  the  observation
that  the  increased  suicide  rate  in  older  people  in  Hong  Kong  dur-
ing  the  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  epidemic  was
related  to  their  stress  over  fears  they  would  be  a  burden  on  their
family  [46].  Alcohol  abuse  is  less  frequently  implicated  in  old  age
compared  to  younger  suicides  and  often  has  comorbid  depression
[7,13].  Personality  disorders  are  less  common  in  suicidal  behaviour
in  late  life  compared  with  younger  cohorts  [7,13].  There  appears  to
be  a  slight  increased  risk  associated  with  dementia  and  this  mainly
happens  in  people  under  the  age  of  70,  with  comorbid  depression
and  within  three  months  of  diagnosis  [42,47].

12.  Strategies  for  suicide  prevention  in  late  life

tional  Research  Group  on  Suicide  among  the  Elderly  noted  that

evidence-based  ﬁndings  are  scant  on  the  prevention  of  suicide
and  suicidal  behaviour  in  older  people  [48].  It  recommended  a
range  of  universal  (entire  population),  selective  (high  risk  popu-
lations),  and  indicated  (symptomatic  individuals)  strategies  that
could  be  considered.  As  no  single  prevention  strategy  is  likely  to
be  successful  alone,  a  multi-faceted,  multi-layered  approach  to
suicide  prevention  is  required.  Consistent  with  this,  an  evaluation
of  national  suicide  prevention  programmes  in  21  OECD  countries
concluded  that  suicide  rates  declined  after  government-led  suicide
prevention  programmes  were  introduced  and  that  this  was  more
pronounced  in  youth  and  older  people  [49].

A  systematic  review  of  suicide  prevention  programmes  in  late
life  identiﬁed  19  studies  with  an  empirical  evaluation  of  a  suicide
prevention  or  intervention  programme  [50].  The  identiﬁed  studies
mainly  addressed  depression  screening  and  treatment,  and  reduc-
tion  of  social  isolation,  with  largely  positive  outcomes  of  reduction
in  suicidal  ideation  or  suicide  rates  of  participating  communi-
ties.  These  studies  included  a  series  of  quasi-experimental  studies
in  rural  Japanese  communities  with  high  suicide  rates,  which
involved  community-based  depression  screening  in  older  people
and  psychoeducation  with  follow  up  of  screen  positives  by  GPs  or
psychiatrists,  demonstrated  reduced  suicide  rates  in  women   but
not  men   [51].  Recently  a  multimodal  intervention  which  included
involvement  of  local  government  leadership,  education  of  the
general  public  to  reduce  stigma  and  increase  awareness,  train-
ing  programmes  for  community  gatekeepers  and  screening  and
increased  support  for  individuals  at  high  risk,  was  found  to  be  effec-
tive  in  reducing  suicidal  behaviour,  particularly  suicide  attempts  in
males  and  older  people  in  rural  areas,  but  was  ineffective  in  highly
populated  regions  [52].

A  second  group  of  studies  involved  the  evaluation  of  telephone
programmes  of  two  types  [50].  The  ﬁrst  type  was  designed  to
support  older  disabled  people  at  home  rather  than  as  a  suicide
prevention  programme,  but  a  ten  year  evaluation  found  lower
than  expected  suicide  rates.  The  second  type  was  of  the  more
characteristic  emergency  suicide  hotlines  where  evaluations  did
not  speciﬁcally  include  suicidal  behaviour.  These  results  empha-
sise  that  successful  interventions  need  not  be  designed  speciﬁcally
designed  for  suicide  prevention.

It  has  long  been  recognised  that  older  people  have  frequent  con-
tact  with  general  practitioners  (GPs)  before  suicide  [13,14].  A  third
group  of  studies  focused  on  the  identiﬁcation  and  management  of
depression  and  suicide  risk  in  primary  care,  with  two  enhanced
primary  care  studies  involving  collaboration  with  ‘depression  care
managers’  to  treat  late  life  depression  showing  beneﬁts  over  rou-
tine  care  [50].  Subsequently,  a  clustered  randomised  controlled  trial
involving  practice  audit  with  personalised  automated  audit  feed-
back  and  targeted  printed  educational  material  to  373  GPs  and  over
21  thousand  patients  aged  60  years  or  over  was  found  to  reduce  the
two  year  prevalence  of  depression  and  self  harm  behaviour  by  10%
compared  with  controls  [53].  One  important  component  of  health
professional  education  is  the  assessment  and  management  of  sui-
cide  risk,  with  one  programme  involving  132  multidisciplinary  staff
of  two  Veterans  Affairs  Medical  Centers  attending  a  6.5  h  work-
shop  demonstrating  improvements  in  the  quality  of  case  notes  and
recognition  of  suicide  risk  categories  [54].

The  management  of  high  risk  older  patients  with  a  history  of
recent  suicidal  behaviour  has  been  a  focus  of  evaluation  in  Hong
Kong.  The  Elderly  Suicide  Prevention  Programme  (ESPP)  of  the  Cas-
tle  Peak  Hospital  reported  on  1230  older  people  at  high  risk  of
suicide  managed  over  an  8  year  period.  There  were  only  eight  sui-
cides  (0.65%)  and  all  occurred  within  the  ﬁrst  6  weeks  of  treatment
on  the  programme  [55].  A  second  regional  ESPP  with  a  two-tiered
multifaceted  care  management  model  of  older  suicide  attempters
compared  the  two-year  suicide  and  suicide  attempt  outcomes  with
the  pre-intervention  observational  phase  of  the  study  [56].  It  found

that  the  ESPP  was  associated  with  a  reduced  rate  of  suicide  in  the
suicide  attempters  although  it  did  not  reduce  the  rate  of  reattempts.
Universal  prevention  strategies  that  concentrate  upon  posi-
tive  ageing,  ageism,  stigma,  social  connections  and  prevention  of
depression  in  late  life  could  potentially  decrease  suicide  risk  but
have  yet  to  be  tested  [34].  As  such,  suicide  prevention  would  not
be  the  main  focus  of  the  strategy  but  rather  it  would  be  one  of  the
potential  outcomes.  There  is  still  a  perception  that  it  is  ‘normal’
for  older  people  to  be  depressed  and  that  ‘nothing  can  be  done’
about  it.  Two  qualitative  psychological  autopsy  studies  found  that
suicidal  older  people  are  more  likely  to  give  warnings  to  relatives,
but  few  of  these  warnings  are  passed  on  to  health  care  providers
and  even  when  they  are,  preventive  measures  are  not  often  being
implemented  [57,58].  From  these  studies  efforts  to  improve  general
population  knowledge  of  late  life  depression  and  suicide  remains  a
key  consideration  for  suicide  prevention.

13.  Conclusion

in 

late 

Suicidal  behaviour 

life  has  complex  aetiology  and
involves  factors  that  arise  from  the  entire  lifespan.  In  terms  of  better
understanding  suicidal  behaviour,  work  in  recent  years  has  made
progress  in  identifying  the  neurocognitive  differences  between
suicidal  and  non-suicidal  depressed  older  people  along  with  asso-
ciated  structural  differences  on  neuroimaging.  It  is  unclear  whether
these  neurocognitive  factors  also  play  a  role  in  suicidal  behaviour  in
the  absence  of  depression.  This  holds  promise  for  future  research.
There  is  evidence  that  optimal  management  of  depression  and
of  high  risk  individuals  can  be  effective  in  reducing  depressive
symptoms  and  suicidal  behaviour.  How  best  to  improve  the  qual-
ity  of  depression  management  in  primary  and  secondary  care
requires  further  research.  Further  work  is  also  required  to  exam-
ine  if  enhancement  of  social  connections  is  beneﬁcial.  Currently  the
Senior  Connection,  a  randomised  trial  of  volunteer  peer  compan-
ionship  for  older  people  involving  community-based  social  services
agencies  and  primary  care  practises,  is  underway  in  the  United
States  [59].  Effective  suicide  prevention  in  a  population,  however,
is  likely  to  require  a  multi-layered  multi-faceted  approach.  Further
research  is  required  regarding  the  optimal  way   of  delivering  such
interventions  particularly  in  urban  populations  and  for  males.
