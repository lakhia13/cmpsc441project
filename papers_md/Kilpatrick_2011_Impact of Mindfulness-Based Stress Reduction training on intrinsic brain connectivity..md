Abstract

The beneficial effects of mindful awareness and mindfulness meditation training on physical and
psychological health are thought to be mediated in part through changes in underlying brain
processes. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) allows identification of functional networks in
the brain. It has been used to examine state-dependent activity and is well-suited for studying
states such as meditation. We applied fcMRI to determine if Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
(MBSR) training is effective in altering intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Healthy women
were randomly assigned to participate in an 8 week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
training course or an 8 week waiting period. After 8 weeks, fMRI data (1.5 T) was acquired while
subjects rested with eyes closed, with the instruction to pay attention to the sounds of the scanner
environment. Group independent component analysis was performed to investigate training-
related changes in functional connectivity. Significant MBSR-related differences in functional
connectivity were found mainly in auditory/salience and medial visual networks. Relative to
findings in the control group, MBSR subjects showed (1) increased functional connectivity within
auditory and visual networks, (2) increased functional connectivity between auditory cortex and
areas associated with attentional and self-referential processes, (3) greater anticorrelation between
auditory and visual cortex, and (4) greater anticorrelation between visual cortex and areas
associated with attentional and self-referential processes. These findings suggest that 8 weeks of
mindfulness meditation training alters intrinsic functional connectivity in ways that may reflect a
more consistent attentional focus, enhanced sensory processing, and reflective awareness of
sensory experience.

1. Introduction

Mindfulness meditation is an attention-training technique that is receiving increased
research and public interest in the West (Ludwig and Kabat-Zinn, 2008; Lutz et al., 2008b).
It consists of training practitioners in how to be mindful, an attentional stance of openly and
non-judgmentally observing one’s moment-by-moment experiences. A growing body of
evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation training may reduce stress and improve some
aspects of physical and psychological health in patient populations (Brown et al., 2007;
Chiesa and Serretti, 2009, 2010; Creswell et al., 2009). Moreover, new neuroimaging studies
suggest that mindfulness meditation training, such as that offered in the standardized and
manualized 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention (Kabat-Zinn,
1990), can alter functional neural responding to affective tasks in healthy individuals (Farb
et al., 2010).

A major component of mindfulness meditation training is focusing and refocusing
awareness on present moment internal and external experience (e.g. breathing, thoughts,
ambient sounds, interoceptive sensations) as opposed to mind wandering or active problem
solving. MBSR training includes breath awareness, body awareness, attention to the
transient nature of sensory experience, and shifting attention across sensory modalities. It is
therefore hypothesized that meditation practice should lead to altered functioning of brain
networks involved in attention and sensitivity to internal and external sensations and
emotions. To date only a small number of studies examined brain mechanisms involved in
mindfulness meditation using functional brain imaging. Although the results across these
small studies are not completely consistent they do suggest mindfulness meditation leads to
increased activations in frontal brain regions involved in attention (Farb et al., 2007; Goldin
and Gross, 2010; Holzel et al., 2007) and increased activations in temporal regions during
processing of sounds (Lutz et al., 2008a). In addition, mindfulness meditation experience is
associated with increased cortical thickness in anterior insula (involved in interoception),
frontal cortex (Brodmann’s area 9/10; involved in the integration of emotion and cognition)
and sensory cortices (Lazar et al., 2005). Thus there is evidence that mindfulness meditation
is associated with changes in attention and perceptual processing circuits, perhaps reflecting
the emphasis on conscious direction and redirection of attention to present moment
experience and increased awareness of sensory stimuli.

The examination of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), sometimes referred to as resting
state networks (Seeley et al., 2007), provides information about the integrity and
organization of major functional systems of the brain. Even in the absence of explicit, phasic
changes induced by a sensory or cognitive task, intrinsic brain activity is characterized by
slow fluctuations in the BOLD signal (<0.1 Hz) which exhibit a high degree of spatial
structure reminiscent of task-related activation maps (Damoiseaux et al., 2006; Smith et al.,
2009). Coherent functional networks most consistently identified by fcMRI include: the
default mode network (DMN) associated with episodic memory and self-referential
processing; the executive control network associated with salience processing; lateralized
fronto-parietal networks associated with working memory and attentional processes; and
sensory-related networks (medial visual, lateral visual, auditory, sensorimotor) (Damoiseaux
et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2009).

Intrinsic connectivity fMRI has been used to characterize neural networks in healthy and
patient populations (Buckner et al., 2008; Greicius, 2008), and it may be also particularly
relevant for the study of changes in functional connectivity that are hypothesized to result
from regular practice of mindfulness meditation. Intrinsic connectivity reflects both
anatomically constrained spontaneous fluctuations and state-dependent activity (Gopinath et
al., 2010) and is well-suited for studying states such as meditation. Intrinsic activity has been
shown to be modulated in terms of connectivity, amplitude or spectral power distribution by
various conditions such as rest with eyes open or closed, sleep, transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation, muscle fatigue and by pharmological manipulations (Bianciardi et al.,
2009; Esposito et al., 2010; Gopinath et al., 2010; Horovitz et al., 2008; Peltier et al., 2005;
Rack-Gomer et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Also, intrinsic connectivity changes have been
found following intense training on a difficult visual discrimination task (Lewis et al., 2009).
Thus, fcMRI provides a tool for examining training-related plasticity and neural
mechanisms underlying states such as meditation. The aim of the present study was to
determine if Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training alters the functional
connectivity of intrinsic connectivity networks during mindful awareness of auditory
sensation. Given that the formal practice of MBSR highlights attention to sensory
experience, we hypothesized that ICNs associated with attention and sensory processing
would show training-related changes.

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Subjects

32 healthy, meditation-naïve women (ages 21–55; mean = 34.1; standard deviation = 9.8)
were recruited by advertisement. Subjects were screened via medical exam for absence of
significant health or psychiatric conditions. All study protocols were performed after
approval by UCLA and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Subjects were
compensated for participation by the provision of the MBSR training program free of
charge. One additional subject completed the MBSR training; however, due to scanner
technical difficulties, her fMRI data was excluded from all analyses.

2.2 Behavioral Measures

To ensure that the MBSR program was indeed increasing mindfulness (compared to wait-list
controls), a 15-item measure of trait mindfulness was administered at baseline and after the
8-week treatment period (Brown and Ryan, 2003). Trait mindfulness, defined as an open or
receptive awareness to present moment experience, was assessed by the Mindfulness
Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) (Brown and Ryan, 2003). The MAAS is a 15-item self-
report measure that asks participants to rate the frequency of their mindful states in day-to-
day life. In addition, subjects completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) as a
measure of state and trait anxiety (Spielberger et al., 1970).

2.3 Procedures

Subjects were randomly assigned to participate in an 8 week Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction (MBSR) training course (n=17) or to an 8 week waiting period (n=15). The two
groups did not differ in age (t(30)=1.48, p>.05) or state anxiety (t(30)=.647, p>.05) and trait
anxiety (t(30)=.05, p>.05) as measured by the State Train Anxiety Inventory (Table 1).
Subjects in the MBSR group immediately participated in the 8 week MBSR training course.
Subjects in the wait-list control group had an 8 week waiting period before receiving MBSR
training. The wait-list condition was intended to control for subjects’ level of interest in
meditation training and general motivation to participate in the study, while keeping their
current meditation experience at a baseline (zero) level. After the 8 week training/waiting
period, subjects completed intrinsic connectivity fMRI scans. Subjects in the wait-list group

were then provided MBSR training. Subjects completed questionnaires at the randomization
visit and the fMRI visit.

2.4 MBSR Training

MBSR training consisted of eight weekly 150-minute group sessions, a day-long retreat in
the sixth/seventh week, and daily home practice. During each group session, an instructor
lead subjects in different guided meditations, awareness exercises, mindful movement, and
group discussions, with the intent of fostering mindful awareness of how one responds to
stress. The day-long retreat (7 hours) focused on integrating and elaborating on exercises
learned during the course. Participants were expected to do 30 minutes of daily home
practice six days a week during the course with guided meditations on tape and to keep a
record to allow assessment of level of compliance to this aspect of the training. The training
was conducted by two experienced MBSR instructors (http://www.insightla.org/).

2.5 fMRI Acquisition

MRI scanning was performed using a 1.5T MRI scanner (Siemens Sonata; Siemens,
Erlangen, Germany). A high resolution structural image was acquired from each subject
with a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence, repetition time
(TR) = 2300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.85 ms, slice thickness = 1 mm, 160 slices, 128 × 128
voxel matrices, and 13 mm voxel size. Subjects completed two mindfulness state scans in
which functional blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) images were acquired for 5.5
minutes each in 38-slice whole brain volumes, slice thickness = 3 mm, TR = 3000 ms, TE =
28 ms, flip angle = 90°.

Prior to entering the scanner, subjects completed the MAAS questionnaire. Subjects
completed two 5.5 minute mindfulness state scans; one with ambient scanner noise only and
one with modulated white noise presented through headphones in addition to the ambient
scanner noise, counterbalanced for order. The modulated white noise scan was originally
included to potentially aid in the development of a novel analytical technique but this was
not attempted in the current analysis. During the mindfulness state scans all subjects
received the following instructions: “During this baseline scan of about 5 min, we would like
you to again stay as still as possible and be mindfully aware of your surroundings. Please
keep your eyes closed during this procedure. Continue to be mindfully aware of whatever
you notice in your surroundings and your own sensations. Mindful awareness means that
you pay attention to your present moment experience, in this case the changing sounds of
the scanner/changing background sounds played through the headphones, and to bring
interest and curiosity to how you are responding to them.” Following the mindfulness state
scans, subjects completed additional fMRI scans involving a pain-related task; these data are
not included in the current report, and will be reported elsewhere.

2.6 fMRI Preprocessing

Using SPM5 software (Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), data
were slice-time and motion corrected, spatially normalized to the MNI template using the
structural imgaes, and spatially smoothed with a 5 mm3 Gaussian kernel. The first two
volumes were discarded to allow for stabilization of the magnetic field. In addition, the last
8 scans were excluded from analyses as movement in the scanner increased towards the end
of the acquisition for several subjects. Therefore, fMRI analyses were based on two 5
minute runs (100 timepoints each) of state fMRI data.

2.7 Statistical Analyses

Page 5

Group independent component analysis (gICA) was performed to investigate training-
related changes in functional connectivity among ICNs during mindful rest. All 32 subjects
were entered into the gICA implemented in GIFT (http://icatb.sourceforge.com). The
number of independent components was estimated to be 18 using the MDL criteria (Li et al.,
2006). Eighteen independent components were extracted by ICA decomposition using the
infomax algorithm (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995). Multiple runs (20 iterations) of ICA were
performed using ICASSO to determine the reliability of the ICA algorithm (Himberg et al.,
2004). ICASSO outputs a final set of independent components representing the centroid of
the results from the multiple iterations. Each independent component consists of a spatial
map and an associated timecourse. The component containing the default mode network
(DMN) was identified by spatial correlation with a weighted template provided in GIFT
(Franco et al., 2009). Additional components were selected that displayed spatial correlation
with the SPM grey matter template greater than 0.15 and the majority of power spectral
distribution in the lower frequencies (<.08 Hz). In total, eight components were selected for
second-level analyses (Figure 1). Individual subject maps were back-reconstructed. These
maps contained z-score values that represented the degree of correlation between the voxel
signal and the timecourse of the component (Greicius et al., 2007).

Subject maps were entered into SPM random-effects analyses. For each component, single
group maps were created by performing one-way repeated measure (Ambient Noise Only;
Modulated White Noise) ANOVAs. To detect possible regional differences in ICN
functional connectivity, a Group (MBSR; controls) × Scan (Ambient Noise Only; White
Noise) Mixed Model ANOVA was performed for each component with an explicit mask
created from the single group maps (|T-value|≥3.0 on one or both single group maps).
Results were thresholded at a corrected cluster significance level of p=0.05. No significant
differences were found between the white noise and ambient noise scans on any component
(i.e. no main effect for scan or interaction); thus, only group effects are reported. Behavioral
data was analyzed by mixed linear model analysis using PASW 17 (Chicago, IL). All
functional data were overlaid on the MNI template available in MRIcro
(http://www.sph.s.c.edu/comd/rorden/mricro.html) for presentation purposes.

Additional post hoc, seed-based correlation analyses were performed on significant clusters
reported in 3.3.1 using the CONN fMRI connectivity toolbox (v12.1,
http://web.mit.edu/swg/software.htm). The toolbox removes confounding effects related to
white matter/CSF signal as well as motion parameters (six dimensions with first order
derivative). Functional data was bandpass filtered (0.01 to 0.10 Hz). Fisher transformed
maps of the bivariate correlation between the seed ROI time-course and all other voxels
were created and contrasted at the group level in SPM5 using an explicit mask from the
identified ICN. Results were thresholded at a height of p<.001 uncorrected and extent > 10
voxels.

3.2 MAAS

Page 6

MAAS scores for three of the wait-list control subjects were not collected at the fMRI visit
due to an oversight. A mixed linear model demonstrated a significant interaction between
Group (MBSR; Control) and Visit (Randomization; fMRI) (F(1,30)=4.982, p=.033). At the
randomization visit, subjects assigned to the MBSR group did not differ from wait-list
controls in trait mindfulness as assessed by the MAAS (p=.718). However, at the fMRI visit,
the MBSR subjects had significantly greater MAAS scores compared to wait list controls
(p=.009). Estimated means and standard errors are presented in Table 2. These results show
the effectiveness of MBSR training in increasing mindfulness while the wait-list group
maintained baseline mindfulness.

3.3 Intrinsic Connectivity Networks

Of the eight selected components of interest (Figure 1), six displayed significant MBSR-
related changes in the strength of regional functional connectivity (Table 3). The
components with the most widespread differences (in terms of spatial extent) included the
auditory/salience ICN and the medial visual ICN.

3.3.1 Auditory/salience ICN—The identified auditory/salience ICN (Figure 1a) included
primary auditory (BA41/42), superior temporal gyrus (BA22/38), and posterior insula, (p<.
05, corrected), similar to an ICN identified in a previous study as corresponding to task co-
activation maps in the auditory domain (Smith et al., 2009). In addition, the ICN included
regions of the anterior cingulate (BA24/32) and lateral frontal cortex (BA46), which are
typically associated with salience and executive control networks (Seeley et al., 2007).
Therefore, the ICN was labeled as “auditory/salience”. It is unclear why the components
split differently in our sample, perhaps the instructions that brought attention to auditory
input altered the covariance structure somewhat. Chang & Glover (2010) demonstrated high
variability during resting scans in the coherence of salience/executive control regions with a
DMN seed in the posterior cingulate. In addition, visual inspection of the supporting
information from Smith et al (2009) shows sACC to be present in multiple components,
either in the resting state or in the BrainMap-derived components, including the executive
control, right frontoparietal, somatosensory, and cerebellar. We might therefore speculate
that the connectivity of salience/executive control regions with other networks shows
variability and sensitivity to state.

Results from the single group analyses and two-group comparison are presented in Figure 2.
MBSR subjects, compared to wait list controls demonstrated significantly increased
functional connectivity with the auditory/salience ICN in two regions: (1) right dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and (2); the left medial parietal operculum (extending into
posterior insula; Table 3). The parietal operculum cluster may be localized to OP 2 or OP 3
(Eickhoff et al., 2006). The left parietal operculum had a positive correlation with auditory/
salience ICN intrinsic activity in both groups, but was significantly more correlated in the
MBSR subjects. The right dmPFC had a negative correlation with auditory/salience ICN
intrinsic activity in wait list controls and a positive correlation in MBSR subjects (see Table
3). Although intrinsic connectivity networks are largely nonoverlapping, some areas of
overlap can be found (Seeley et al., 2007). The right dmPFC cluster overlapped with the
DMN and demonstrated a significant positive association with the DMN in both subject
groups.

In addition, visual regions (bilateral BA 18/19) demonstrated significantly decreased
functional connectivity with the auditory/salience ICN in MBSR subjects relative to
controls. These visual regions overlapped the medial visual ICN and had a negative
correlation with auditory/salience ICN intrinsic activity in MBSR subjects and a positive/

zero correlation in wait list controls (see Table 3). Thus, significantly greater anticorrelation
between medial visual cortex (BA 18/19) and the auditory/salience ICN was seen in the
MBSR subjects compared to controls.

Ad hoc analyses were performed to aid interpretation of the results. The four regions
displaying group differences in functional connectivity with the auditory/salience ICN (the
left BA 19, bilateral BA 18, right dmPFC, and left OP) were used as seed ROIs in seed-
based correlation analyses. The primary purpose of the ad hoc analyses was to determine
which regions within the auditory/salience ICN showed the greatest change in functional
connectivity with each of the seed ROIs. Although the visual regions (BA 18, BA 19)
showed significantly greater anti-correlation with the auditory/salience ICN in MBSR
subjects, the difference was most robust in auditory region left BA 22 for both BA 18 and
BA 19 seed ROIs (coordinates: −64 −38 8; −62 −46 18, respectively), right inferior parietal
BA 40 for the BA 19 seed ROI (coordinates: 60 −36 28) and right ACC (BA 24) for the BA
18 seed ROI (coordinates: 6 36 10; located within the identified DMN). Although OP and
dmPFC showed significantly greater correlation with the auditory/salience ICN in MBSR
subjects, the difference was most robust in right BA 22 and dorsal ACC (dACC; BA 32) for
the OP seed ROI (coordinates: 58 8 −6; 8 12 48, respectively); and right BA 22/39 and left
dACC (BA 24) for the dmPFC seed ROI (coordinates: 46 −52 8; −4 2 40, respectively). The
dACC clusters did not overlap with the DMN.

3.3.2 Medial Visual ICN—The identified medial visual ICN (Figure 1b) included visual
cortex (BA 17/18/19), retrosplenial cortex (BA 30; p<.05, corrected) and was well-matched
to an ICN identified in a previous study as corresponding to task co-activation maps in the
visual domain (Smith et al., 2009). Results from the single group and two-group comparison
are presented in Figure 3. MBSR subjects, compared to wait list controls demonstrated
significantly increased functional connectivity with the medial visual ICN in bilateral
calcarine retrosplenial cortex (BA 30; Table 3). The retrosplenial cortex demonstrated
positive correlation with medial visual ICN intrinsic activity in both groups, but was
significantly more correlated in the MBSR subjects. This portion of the retrosplenial cortex
was more posterior to retrosplenial cortex in the DMN and did not overlap with the DMN
(p>.05). In addition, the right supragenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC; BA 24/32)
demonstrated significantly decreased functional connectivity with the medial visual ICN in
MBSR subjects compared to controls. The right sACC was negatively correlated with
medial visual ICN intrinsic activity in MBSR subjects and was not correlated in control
subjects. Thus, significantly greater anticorrelation between the right sACC and medial
visual ICN intrinsic activity was seen in the MBSR subjects compared to controls. This
portion of the ACC was positively correlated with DMN intrinsic activity in both groups
(p<.05, corrected).

An ad hoc analysis was performed to evaluate group differences in the overall level of
within-network functional connectivity of the medial visual ICN. The average ICA score
within a spatial template containing the positively weighted voxels common to the MBSR
and control ICN maps was computed across runs using Marsbar (Brett et al., 2002). A two-
sample t-test demonstrated a significant increase in the overall network functional
connectivity in the MBSR subjects compared to wait list controls (t(30)=2.298, p=.029).

3.3.3 Additional ICNs—Table 3 includes information about significant differences in
functional connectivity between MBSR trained subjects and wait list controls for executive
control (Figure 1f), sensorimotor (Figure 1d) and lateral visual networks (Figure 1c). These
differences are not as extensive as those seen in the auditory/salience and medial visual
networks. The default mode network (Figure 1e) and two frontoparietal networks (Figure
1g, h) did not show any significant training-related differences in functional connectivity.

4. Discussion

Page 8

The results indicate that a course of MBSR training in healthy subjects impacts regional
functional connectivity within auditory-related and medial visual intrinsic connectivity
networks during instructed mindful awareness to auditory stimuli. MBSR subjects, relative
to wait list controls, displayed increased functional connectivity of the parietal operculum
and the dmPFC (BA9/32) in the auditory/salience ICN and increased functional connectivity
of retrosplenial cortex in the medial visual ICN. In addition, MBSR subjects displayed
stronger differentiation (greater anticorrelation) between the auditory/salience ICN and
portions of medial visual ICN and between the medial visual ICN and the sACC. The results
are discussed below in terms of four main hypotheses.

4.1 Increased connectivity among auditory and salience/control regions in MBSR subjects
during mindful awareness of sounds

The parietal operculum was functionally correlated with an auditory/salience network in
both MBSR and control groups. However, MBSR subjects demonstrated significantly
increased functional connectivity of this region with the auditory/salience network,
especially with BA 22 (auditory association cortex) and dorsal ACC (involved in salience).
The parietal operculum contains auditory-related cortex and plays a role in auditory function
(Celesia, 1976; Galaburda and Sanides, 1980). The parietal operculum is strongly activated
by nonvocal sounds and may mediate processing of fine-grained, temporal acoustic features
(Binder et al., 1996; Meyer et al., 2005). Our results demonstrate that MBSR-trained
subjects during mindful awareness of sounds have greater synergy/positive coherence
between a region involved in fine-grained perceptual processing of auditory information and
other auditory-related regions as well as salience/control regions.

Although ICNs are mostly distinct, they are not completely independent (Seeley et al.,
2007). Nodes that are present in two networks may be involved in information transfer,
facilitate switching between the networks or underlie another key interaction process (Seeley
et al., 2007). The dmPFC was functionally correlated with the DMN network in both MBSR
and control groups. However, MBSR subjects demonstrated significantly increased
functional connectivity of this anterior DMN region with the auditory/salience network,
especially with BA 22/39 (associated with auditory processing) and dorsal ACC (involved in
salience). Anterior cortical midline structures such as dmPFC are considered crucial in
transforming simple sensory processing into more complex self-referential processing
(Northoff et al., 2006). Dorsomedial PFC is involved in the process of attending to mental
states (Walter et al., 2009) and has been previously implicated in studies of mindfulness.
Trait mindfulness has been associated with increased dmPFC activation during reappraisal
of negative emotion (Modinos et al., 2010) and during affect labeling (Creswell et al., 2007).
The increased functional connectivity between dmPFC and auditory/salience ICN suggests
greater synergy/positive coherence between self-referential, attention, and auditory sensory
processing and may underlie a greater attention and reflective awareness of auditory
experience in MBSR trained subjects.

4.2 Increased connectivity of the medial visual network in MBSR subjects during mindful
awareness of sounds

Retrosplenial cortex (BA 30) was functionally correlated with a visual-related network in
both MBSR and control groups, yet MBSR subjects demonstrated significantly increased
functional connectivity of this region. Spontaneous BOLD oscillations of the retrosplenial
cortex are sensitive to whether the subject is resting with eyes closed or eyes open, with
increased oscillations and functional connectivity during eyes closed (McAvoy et al., 2008).
The retrosplenial cortex is activated by scene viewing and imagery and is involved in

placing a scene within a broader spatial environment by integrating egocentric spatial
information into an allocentric environmental representation (Burgess, 2008; Epstein, 2008;
O’Craven and Kanwisher, 2000). Our results show that MBSR training affects the functional
connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and the medial visual system even when the
subject is mindfully meditating with eyes closed.

Spontaneous BOLD oscillations in the visual cortex are increased during light sleep and are
correlated with an inverse measure of wakefulness (Horovitz et al., 2008). Also, the within
network functional connectivity of the visual cortex is increased during sedation and alcohol
consumption (Esposito et al., 2010) (Kiviniemi et al., 2005). Thus, arousal/vigilance level
can affect the overall intrinsic functional connectivity of the visual cortex. An ad hoc
analysis revealed a significant global increase in medial visual ICN functional connectivity
in MBSR subjects compared to wait list controls, perhaps indicating a greater degree of
relaxation in MBSR subjects.

4.3 Greater differentiation between auditory and visual intrinsic activity in MBSR subjects
during mindful awareness of sounds

Reciprocal modulation/attenuation between cortical regions is a common phenomenon and
has been observed between visual and auditory cortex (Laurienti et al., 2002; Northoff et al.,
2004). Laurienti et al (2002) observed simultaneous activations in auditory cortex and
deactivations in visual cortex during auditory stimulation and an opposite pattern during
visual stimulation. MBSR subjects had significantly greater anticorrelation between visual
areas and the auditory/salience ICN, especially in auditory region BA 22 (and sACC,
discussed in section 4.4) suggesting greater cross-modal inhibition and less intrusion of the
two forms of processing on each other.

A stronger anticorrelation between intrinsic connectivity networks has been associated with
improved, less variable performance on cognitive tasks, improved perceptual learning and
may reflect processing efficiency (Deco et al., 2009; Kelly et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2009).
Thus, stronger reciprocal modulation between auditory and visual areas may reflect a more
consistent focus in MBSR subjects and be part of previously shown increase in attentional
ability following meditation practice (Chambers et al., 2008; Jha et al., 2007; Valentine and
Sweet, 1999). Alternatively, auditory information may have become increasingly dominant
in the condition of poor visual stimulation (eyes closed) in the MBSR subjects compared to
controls, reducing attentional resources devoted to the visual domain. Improved allocation of
attentional resources both within and across sensory modalites has been demonstrated in
mindfulness meditators (Slagter et al., 2007; van den Hurk et al., 2010a; van den Hurk et al.,
2010b). Previous studies have shown that during eyes closed compared to eyes open,
increased functional connectivity has been found in auditory, somatosensory, and visual
cortex and decreased functional connectivity has been shown in default mode and attention
networks (McAvoy et al., 2008; Nir et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2009). Similarly, activation
studies have shown increased activity in auditory, somatosensory, lateral visual and
frontopolar areas during eyes closed compared to eyes open and increased activity during
eyes open compared to eyes closed in attention and ocular motor regions (Marx et al., 2003).
Since eyes closed was used throughout this study it is not clear if the group differences
found would also hold for eyes open.

4.4 Increased anticorrelation between visual cortex and anterior DMN in MBSR subjects
during mindful awareness to sounds

In addition to increased connectivity in MBSR subjects between a region within the anterior
DMN (dmPFC) and the auditory/salience network (discussed in section 4.1), a neighboring
cluster (sACC) demonstrated increased anticorrelation with visual cortex (see Figure 4).

This increased anticorrelation with the aDMN in MBSR subjects was reflected in both the
medial visual ICN (main ICA analysis) and in the auditory/salience ICN (ad hoc seed-based
correlation analysis). The same portion of the sACC was significant in both analyses. The
sACC is involved in monitoring and control functions (Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004). Thus,
the stronger anticorrelation may reflect greater inhibitory control in MBSR subjects
necessary to maintain mindful awareness of sounds and may be related to the previously
demonstrated increase in attentional ability as mentioned in section 4.3. Alternatively,
reduced attentional resources may be devoted to the visual domain in conditions of poor
visual stimulation (eyes closed) in the MBSR subjects compared to controls as mentioned in
section 4.3.

4.5 Comparison to training-related connectivity studies

Previous studies of training-related changes in intrinsic connectivity have demonstrated that,
in general, brain networks recruited during training show robust changes in intrinsic
connectivity (Albert et al., 2009; Lewis et al., 2009). MBSR training is thought to recruit
attention and sensory-related networks; thus the current results demonstrating training-
related changes in functional connectivity among regions associated with sensory and
attentional processes are consistent with previous studies in terms of this general
supposition. Similar to a previous study investigating changes in intrinsic connectivity
following training on a difficult visual perceptual task (Lewis et al., 2009), the current study
demonstrated training-related changes in connectivity between sensory cortex, DMN regions
and regions involved in attention/salience. However, the direction of training-related
changes was very different. Following training, Lewis et al (2009) found greater
anticorrelation between trained regions of the visual cortex and attention areas; possibly
reflecting an active decoupling of the two systems allowing for more automatic processing
and less top-down control as training progressed. In the current study, MBSR subjects
demonstrated increased positive connectivity between auditory and salience/attention areas;
possibly reflecting less automatic, mindless processing and more top-down control,
consistent with the goals of MBSR training. In addition, Lewis et al (2009) found less
anticorrelation following training between untrained regions of the visual cortex and DMN
regions; possibly reflecting an attenuation of a filter for unattended sensory information that
became less important as training progressed. In the current study, MBSR subjects
demonstrated greater anticorrelation between visual and DMN regions; possibly reflecting
increased filtering of the unattended visual information, consistent with the goals of the
focused attention instruction.

4.6 Limitations and future directions

In this study, subjects were specifically asked to be mindful of sounds. Open monitoring,
defined as monitoring present moment experience without any particular emphasis or
explicit focus, is another form of attention-focusing meditation central to MBSR. It would
be useful to examine intrinsic connectivity networks without mindful instruction or without
a particular emphasis (open monitoring instruction) as well as with mindful emphasis on
interoception (such as awareness of breath) to see if findings are similar but more related to
the emphasized domain. For example, we hypothesize that mindful awareness of breath in
MBSR trained subjects may increase intrinsic functional connectivity within a frontoparietal
ICN or between anterior DMN regions and a frontoparietal ICN. Futhermore, future studies
should examine the relationship between MBSR-related changes in functional connectivity
and task-related activations.

5. Conclusions

Page 11

Intrinsic connectivity fMRI allows for an examination of the functional connectivity of basic
brain processing systems during meditation states. The current findings extend the results of
prior studies that showed meditation-related changes in specific brain regions active during
attention and sensory processing by providing evidence that MBSR trained compared to
untrained subjects, during a focused attention instruction, have increased connectivity within
sensory networks and between regions associated with attentional processes and those in the
attended sensory cortex. In addition they show greater differentiation between regions
associated with attentional processes and the unattended sensory cortex as well as greater
differentiation between attended and unattended sensory networks. If greater differentiation
between networks reflects processing efficiency as previously hypothesized (Deco et al.,
2009; Kelly et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2009), our data could indicate enhanced sensory
processing, better attentional resource allocation and a more consistent attentional focus in
MBSR trained subjects. In addition, MBSR trained subjects displayed altered connectivity
between anterior DMN regions involved in self-referential processing and sensory cortex
that may indicate greater reflective awareness for sensory experience in MBSR trained
subjects.

Figure 4.
Two regions in the anterior DMN displayed altered functional connectivity with sensory-
related ICNs in MBSR subjects compared to controls. The red cluster (dmPFC) had
increased functional connectivity with the auditory/salience ICN. The blue cluster (sACC)
had greater anticorrelation with the medial visual ICN. The DMN across all subjects is
outlined in dark grey.
