Abstract

Both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are 
effective for chronic low back pain (CLBP), but little is known regarding who might benefit 
more from one than the other. Using data from a randomized trial comparing MBSR, CBT, 
and usual care (UC) for adults aged 20–70 years with CLBP (N = 297), we examined baseline 
characteristics that moderated treatment effects or were associated with improvement regardless of 
treatment. Outcomes included 8-week function (modified Roland Disability Questionnaire), pain 
bothersomeness (0–10 numerical rating scale), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8). 
There were differences in the effects of CBT vs. MBSR on pain based on participant gender (P = 
0.03) and baseline depressive symptoms (P = 0.01), but the only statistically significant moderator 
after Bonferroni correction was the nonjudging dimension of mindfulness. Scores on this measure 
moderated the effects of CBT vs. MBSR on both function (P = 0.001) and pain (P = 0.04). Pain

control beliefs (P < 0.001) and lower anxiety (P < 0.001) predicted improvement regardless of 
treatment. Replication of these findings is needed to guide treatment decision-making for CLBP.

Trial Registration:  The trial and analysis plan were preregistered in ClinicalTrials.gov 
(Identifier: NCT01467843).

Perspective:  Although few potential moderators and nonspecific predictors of benefits from 
CBT or MBSR for CLBP were statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons, 
these findings suggest potentially fruitful directions for confirmatory research while providing 
reassurance that patients could reasonably expect to benefit from either treatment.

Introduction

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective and widely recommended for chronic 
pain.24,93 CBT teaches patients skills for managing pain and for appraising pain less 
negatively, resulting in increased self-efficacy and decreased catastrophizing.9,78,81 There 
is also growing evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions for chronic 
pain,15,65,68,89 which are believed to decrease patient reactivity to pain through awareness 
and nonjudgmental acceptance of current moment experience.27,30,32,65,78 In the Mind-body 
Approaches to Pain (MAP) randomized controlled trial (RCT), we found both CBT and 
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to have benefits for pain and function among 
individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP).13 These two interventions had generally 
similar benefits, suggesting that both are reasonable options for adults with CLBP. This 
conclusion has been corroborated by a recent comparative trial.8

Although the group-level treatment effects may be similar, there is substantial individual 
variability in treatment response to CBT and MBSR.19,51 Patient sociodemographic 
factors,5,88 clinical characteristics (e.g., pain diagnosis),5,81 and psychological or behavioral 
variables5,19,51,56,81 predict differential treatment response in some studies, but the evidence 
is mixed5,6,55,81 and may be influenced by study sample characteristics, length of follow-up, 
and other study design features.28,56 Understanding which treatments work for whom is 
critical for matching patients with the most effective treatment and efficiently using limited 
resources.75 Currently, data are insufficient to guide the choice for a given patient of a 
specific psychosocial treatment among the multiple available; in particular, there is a paucity 
of RCTs that examined which patient characteristics predict differential benefit from CBT 
vs. MBSR for CLBP.18,88 Knowledge concerning patient characteristics that are nonspecific 
predictors (i.e., predict outcomes irrespective of treatment) is also needed. This can help 
identify patients at elevated risk for poor outcomes who may require more intensive or 
targeted interventions, as well as patients who may do well regardless of treatment.

Our primary objective in this study was to use data from the MAP RCT to identify baseline 
participant characteristics associated with differential benefit from MBSR or CBT, vs. each 
other and vs. usual care (UC). We hypothesized a priori that, relative to UC, the effects

of CBT and MBSR on function, pain bothersomeness, and depressive symptoms at 8 
weeks would be greater among participants with clinically meaningful levels of depression 
and anxiety, and greater pain bothersomeness and functional limitations, at baseline. We 
further hypothesized that the treatment benefit of CBT vs. MBSR would be greater among 
individuals with these characteristics. We reasoned that both interventions would have 
greater benefits than usual care, but that participants with low baseline scores on these 
measures would have little room to improve and hence be less likely to show treatment 
benefits. We also reasoned that CBT might be more effective than MBSR for those with 
higher levels of depression, anxiety, pain, and functional limitations because it was designed 
to treat these problems (and our CBT intervention was specifically designed for chronic 
back pain), whereas MBSR was designed for stress management for individuals with 
a wide variety of illnesses. Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of CBT for 
depression,17,21 anxiety,87 and pain and pain-related disability.93 At study initiation, MBSR 
had been little-studied for these problems, especially among patients with chronic back pain.

A secondary objective was to identify baseline characteristics associated with improvement 
regardless of treatment. Based on previous research on predictors of chronic pain 
outcomes, we hypothesized a priori that expectations of improvement,84,91 higher levels of 
education,7,84 less widespread pain,2,52,81,84 and lower baseline levels of pain and functional 
limitations2,7,22,52,84 would be associated with better outcomes. Finally, we conducted 
exploratory analyses to examine other possible moderators and nonspecific predictors of 
treatment response.

Materials and Methods

Setting, Participants, and Procedures

Study participants were enrolled in the MAP RCT comparing group MBSR, group CBT, 
and UC for non-specific CLBP between September 2012 and April 2014. We previously 
reported details of the MAP trial methods,14 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
(CONSORT) flow diagram,13 outcomes,12,13 and findings regarding relationships and 
changes among the study measures of putative therapeutic mechanisms.78 In brief, 
participants were recruited from Group Health (now Kaiser Permanente Washington), 
an integrated healthcare system in Washington State, and from mailings to residents of 
communities served by Group Health. Eligibility criteria included age 20 to 70 years, back 
pain for ≥3 months, patient-rated pain bothersomeness during the past week ≥4 (0–10 
scale), and patient-rated pain-related activity interference during the past week ≥3 (0–10 
scale). Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM)64 diagnostic codes from electronic health records of visits in the previous 
year and telephone screening, we excluded patients with specific causes of low back pain. 
Other exclusion criteria were pregnancy, spine surgery in the previous 2 years, disability 
compensation or litigation, fibromyalgia or cancer diagnosis, other major medical condition, 
plans to see a medical specialist for back pain, inability to read or speak English, and 
participation in a “mind-body” treatment for back pain in the past year. The Group 
Health institutional review board approved the study, and all participants provided informed 
consent.

Measures

We randomized 342 participants to MBSR, CBT, or UC. We stratified randomization 
based on the baseline value of the primary outcome, a modified version of the Roland 
Disability Questionnaire (mRDQ), which we categorized as moderate (mRDQ score ≤12 
on the 0–23 scale) vs. high (mRDQ scores ≥13) back pain-related functional limitations.63 
Trained survey staff, masked to treatment group, administered study measures to participants 
in computer-assisted telephone interviews. Participants were paid $20 for each interview 
completed. For the analyses reported here, we include the 297 participants who completed 
both the baseline and 8-week follow-up assessments.

Participants provided descriptive information at the screening and baseline interviews 
(including age, gender, education, and pain duration [<1 year vs. ≥1 year since experiencing 
1 week without low back pain]) and completed measures at baseline (before randomization) 
and 4, 8, 26, and 52 weeks post-randomization. For the purposes of this study, we focused 
on change in outcome at 8 weeks (post-treatment for those randomized to MBSR or CBT).

Outcome Measures—Outcomes of interest for the current study were the two 
primary outcomes of the parent RCT (back pain-related functional limitations and pain 
bothersomeness) and one secondary outcome from the parent trial (depressive symptom 
severity).

Back Pain-Related Functional Limitations: Participants completed the modified Roland-
Morris Disability Questionnaire (mRDQ).63 The original RDQ, a widely-used measure of 
back pain-related functional limitations, asks whether 24 specific activities are limited today 
by back pain (yes or no).66 We used a modified version that included 23 items63 and asked 
about the previous week rather than today only (score range 0–23; higher scores indicate 
greater limitations).

Back Pain Bothersomeness: Participants rated how bothersome their back pain was during 
the previous week on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (0 = ‘not at all bothersome’ and 10 = 
‘extremely bothersome’).

Depressive Symptoms: Participants completed the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-8), a widely-used, validated measure of depressive symptom severity (score range 
0–24; higher scores indicate greater depressive symptom severity).49

Potential Moderators and Nonspecific Predictors—Moderators (treatment effect 
modifiers) are baseline characteristics of individuals that are associated with differential 
treatment response. Moderators influence the relationship between treatment and outcome 
(i.e., the effect of treatment on individuals depends on their value of the moderator, which 
precedes treatment and is not associated with treatment).45 To examine treatment effect 
modification, we dichotomized continuous baseline measures using pre-specified cut points 
based on clinically meaningful criteria because cut points are advantageous for future 
clinical decision-making. When there were not established clinical cut points for a given 
instrument, we used logical cut points based on possible item responses and the distribution

in our sample in order to avoid very small subgroups. All dichotomization decisions were 
made prior to conducting analyses.

For the moderation analyses, we categorized the baseline mRDQ as scores <14 vs. ≥14 
based on the prior definition of scores of 14 or higher as a poor outcome.66 Previous studies 
have suggested different cut points on 0–10 numerical rating scales for severe pain, with 
the minimal score typically being either 7 or 8.36,40,80,94 We categorized baseline pain 
bothersomeness scores as <8 vs. 8–10. We categorized PHQ-8 scores in 2 pre-specified ways 
to reflect differences between minimal, mild, and moderate to severe depressive symptom 
severity based on standard interpretation: <5 vs. ≥5 (minimal vs. mild or more severe) 
and <10 vs. ≥10 (minimal or mild vs. moderate or more severe).49 In models examining 
nonspecific prediction, we analyzed the continuous-scale measures on their original scales. 
In addition to demographic characteristics such as age and gender, which have been 
identified as potential moderators in some prior studies of CBT and mindfulness,5,86 and 
baseline measures of study outcomes, we also tested nonspecific predictor/moderator effects 
for the baseline values of the measures listed below based on previous research suggesting 
their potential importance in chronic pain problems.5,23,28,31,52–54,84

Expectations.: Participants were asked, “One year from now, do you expect your back pain 
to be: completely gone (1), much better (2), somewhat better (3), a little better (4), about 
the same (5), a little worse (6), or much worse (7)?”. Participants were then asked, “Both of 
the back pain programs we are studying address the mind as well as the body. How helpful 
do you think such a program would be for your back pain, using a 0 to 10 scale, where 
0 is ‘not at all helpful’ and 10 is ‘extremely helpful’?”. For the moderator analyses, we 
categorized the back pain improvement expectations scores as 1–2 (pain completely gone or 
much better) vs. 3–7 (pain somewhat better to much worse) and the treatment helpfulness 
expectation rating as 0–7 (not helpful to neutral) vs. 8–10 (helpful).

Widespread Pain: Participants rated how much they had been bothered (not at all [0], 
a little [1], or a lot [2]) by pain in 9 different body sites during the past 4 weeks: 
abdominal pain; pain in arms, legs, or joints other than spine or back; headache; chest 
pain; neck pain; pelvic or groin pain (both genders) or painful prostatitis (males only); 
pain in face or jaws; head pain other than headaches; and ‘widespread pain, pain in 
most of your body, or fibromyalgia.’ The first four items were from the Patient Health 
Questionnaire 15 (PHQ-15),46 and the other pain items were developed and used in previous 
research.84,85 Research has consistently demonstrated more widespread pain to predict 
worse pain outcomes.52,84 Scores could range from 0–18, with higher scores indicating 
greater widespread pain bothersomeness. Based on the distribution of scores in this sample, 
for the moderator analyses, we categorized scores as <4 vs. ≥4.

Anxiety: Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-2, a widely-
used, validated 2-item measure of anxiety with high sensitivity and specificity for 
detecting anxiety disorders in primary care (score range 0–6; higher scores indicate greater 
anxiety).47,48 Using the recommended cut point for clinically significant anxiety disorders,47 
we categorized scores as <3 vs. ≥3 for the moderator analyses.

Pain Beliefs: Participants completed the 2-item versions of 4 scales from the Survey of 
Pain Attitudes (SOPA): Disability (belief that one is disabled by pain), Harm (belief that 
pain is a sign of damage and that therefore activity should be avoided), Control (belief 
in one’s personal control over pain), and Emotions (belief that emotions affect pain).34,39 
These scales have good test-retest stability, validity, and internal consistency.33,35,39,69 Each 
item is rated on a 0–4 scale, where 3 and 4 indicate ‘somewhat true for me’ or ‘very true for 
me,’ respectively. The total score for each scale is the mean of the 2 item responses, with 
higher scores indicating stronger beliefs in the construct. For the moderator analyses, we 
categorized scores on each scale as 3–4 vs. <3 (very or somewhat true vs. not).

Pain Catastrophizing: Participants completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), a 13-
item measure assessing pain-related catastrophizing, including rumination, magnification, 
and helplessness.61,71 Participants rated the degree to which they had certain thoughts and 
feelings when experiencing pain, using a scale from 0 = ‘not at all’ to 4 = ‘all the time.’ The 
total score is the sum of the item responses (possible range = 0–52; higher scores indicate 
greater endorsement of catastrophic thinking in response to pain). The PCS user manual70 
suggests a total score of 30+ is clinically relevant (75th percentile); therefore, we categorized 
scores as <30 vs. ≥30 for the moderator analyses.

Pain Acceptance: The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire-8 (CPAQ-8), an 8-item 
version of the 20-item CPAQ, has been shown to be reliable and valid.25,26 It has 2 scales: 
Activity Engagement (AE; engagement in life activities in a normal manner even while pain 
is being experienced) and Pain Willingness (PW; disengagement from attempts to control or 
avoid pain). Participants rated each of the 8 items on a 0–6 scale (0 = ‘never true,’ 1 = ‘very 
rarely true,’ 2 = ‘seldom true,’ 3 = ‘sometimes true,’ 4 = ‘often true,’ 5 = ‘almost always 
true,’ 6 = ‘always true’). For the current study, we examined only the total score (sum 
of item responses; possible range 0–48). Higher scores indicate greater activity engagement/
pain willingness/pain acceptance. For the moderator analyses, we categorized the CPAQ-8 
total score as <32 vs. ≥32 (an average of at least ‘often true’ for each item).

Pain Self-Efficacy: Based on prior research that identified self-efficacy as a moderator 
of benefit from CBT,51 we included the Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), which 
consists of 10 items assessing individuals’ confidence in their ability to cope with their pain 
and engage in activities despite their pain. The questionnaire has been demonstrated to be 
valid, reliable, and sensitive to change.60 Each item is rated on a scale from 0 = ‘not at 
all confident’ to 6 = ‘completely confident’ and these ratings are summed to yield a total 
score (possible range 0–60; higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy). For the moderator 
analyses, we categorized scores as <50 vs. ≥50 (average score of 5 on each item).

Mindfulness: Mindfulness has been defined as the awareness that emerges through 
purposeful, non-judgmental attention to the present moment.43 Although increased 
observing, awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity are thought to be important 
mechanisms of change in mindfulness-based interventions,30 baseline mindfulness may 
also predict or moderate outcomes.19,67 Participants completed 4 subscales of the Five 
Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form (FFMQ-SF; one FFMQ-SF scale, Describing,

was not administered due to the need to reduce participant assessment burden and its 
questionable relevance to this study): Observing (noticing internal and external experiences; 
4 items); Acting with Awareness (attending to present moment activities, in contrast to 
behaving automatically while focusing attention elsewhere; 5 items); Nonreactivity (the 
tendency to allow thoughts and feelings to arise and leave without attachment or aversion; 
5 items); and Nonjudging (high scores reflect a nonevaluative acceptance of one’s thoughts 
and feelings; 5-item scale, although inadvertently one question [‘I make judgments about 
whether my thoughts are good or bad’] was not asked).4 Using a 5-point Likert scale (1 
= ‘never or very rarely true’ to 5 = ‘very often or always true’), participants rated what 
generally is true for them in terms of their tendency to be mindful in their daily lives. For 
each scale, the score was calculated as the mean of the answered items (possible range 
= 1–5; higher scores indicate higher levels of the construct). The FFMQ-SF has been 
demonstrated to be reliable, valid, and sensitive to change.4 For the moderator analyses, 
scores on each scale were categorized as <4 vs. ≥4 (average response of ‘often true’ or ‘very 
often or always true’).

Opioid Use: Participants were asked whether or not they had used prescription opioid 
medication for pain in the week before the baseline assessment.

Covariates—The covariates for these analyses were the same as those in our prior analyses 
of the interventions’ effects on the outcomes13: age, gender, education, and pain duration 
(<1 year vs. ≥1 year since experiencing 1 week without low back pain). We decided a priori 
to control for these variables given their potential to affect participant response to treatment 
and likelihood of obtaining follow-up information. We also examined each of these variables 
as a potential moderator or nonspecific predictor. In the moderation analyses, we categorized 
participant age as <60 vs. ≥60 years based on the distribution of age in the sample and the 
need to avoid very small subgroups. There are known differences between middle-aged and 
older adults in pain-related variables.58,59 We categorized education as college graduate vs. 
less than college education, similar to prior studies5 and balancing the subgroup sizes. In the 
nonspecific predictor analyses, we modeled age in 5-year units.

Interventions

We developed structured, detailed therapist/instructor manuals for each intervention. The 
two interventions were comparable in format (group), duration, frequency, and number of 
participants per group cohort. Each intervention consisted of 8 weekly 2-hour sessions, 
home activity assignments, materials to read between sessions, and CDs with relevant 
content for home practice (meditation, body scan, and yoga in MBSR; relaxation and 
imagery exercises in CBT). Consistent with the standard MBSR program, our MBSR 
intervention included an optional 6-hour retreat between the 6th and 7th sessions. We 
previously published detailed descriptions of both interventions,14,78 session attendance 
rates (56.6% and 50.9% of randomized participants attended at least 6 sessions of CBT 
and MBSR, respectively), and retreat attendance rate (26% of participants randomized to 
MBSR),13 but describe the intervention components briefly here.

MBSR—The MBSR intervention was modeled closely after the original program developed 
by Kabat-Zinn41 and based on the 2009 MBSR instructor’s manual.3 Participants were given 
the book Full Catastrophe Living42 and handouts. The intervention included experiential 
training in mindfulness meditation and mindful yoga. All sessions included mindfulness 
exercises (e.g., body scan, sitting meditation) and mindful movement (most commonly, 
yoga).

CBT—The group CBT protocol included the techniques most commonly applied in CBT 
for CLBP10,24,62,73,83 and used in prior studies50,77,79,82,90. The intervention included: (1) 
education about (a) chronic pain, (b) maladaptive thoughts (including catastrophizing) and 
maladaptive beliefs (e.g., inability to control pain, hurt equals harm) common among 
individuals with chronic pain, (c) the relationships between thoughts and emotional 
and physical reactions, (d) sleep hygiene, and (e) relapse prevention and maintenance 
of gains; and (2) instruction and practice in identifying and challenging unhelpful 
thoughts, generating alternative appraisals that are more accurate and helpful, setting and 
working towards behavioral goals, abdominal breathing and progressive muscle relaxation 
techniques, activity pacing, thought-stopping and distraction techniques, positive coping 
self-statements, and coping with pain flare-ups. None of these techniques were included 
in the MBSR intervention, and mindfulness, meditation, and yoga techniques were not 
included in the CBT intervention. CBT participants were also given a workbook developed 
for this study and the book The Pain Survival Guide,76 and were asked to read specific 
chapters between sessions. During each session, participants completed a personal action 
plan for between-session home activities.

Usual Care—Patients assigned to UC received no MBSR training or CBT as part of the 
study and received whatever health care they would customarily receive during the study 
period.

Instructors/Therapists and Treatment Fidelity Monitoring—Details of instructor 
training and supervision and treatment fidelity monitoring were published previously.13 In 
brief, all 8 MBSR instructors received formal training in teaching MBSR from the Center 
for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts or equivalent training and had extensive 
previous experience teaching MBSR. The CBT intervention was conducted by 4 Ph.D.-level 
licensed psychologists with previous experience providing individual and group CBT to 
patients with chronic pain.

Statistical Analysis

To test whether baseline variables were moderators of treatment effects, we constructed 
separate linear regression models for each outcome (mRDQ, pain bothersomeness, and 
PHQ-8). The dependent variable was the change from baseline to 8 weeks in the outcome 
measure and the independent variable was treatment group. A separate model was fit to 
evaluate each potential moderator. To test whether intervention effects differed by subgroup, 
each model included an indicator for subgroup defined by the binary moderator variable and 
an interaction between subgroup and the 3-level treatment group. A finding of a statistically 
significant interaction effect indicates that the effect of the intervention differs by subgroup.

We computed separate P-values to test for differences by subgroup for the following 
treatment effects: CBT vs. UC, MBSR vs. UC, and CBT vs. MBSR. Models adjusted for 
age, gender, education, pain duration (<1 year vs. ≥1 year since experiencing 1 week without 
low back pain), and the baseline value of the outcome measure. We used the Bonferroni 
method57 within each pairwise treatment group comparison to control family-wise error 
rates due to testing for treatment interactions of 23 potential moderators. Specifically, 
we defined statistical significance for a given moderator as a P-value < 0.002 (0.05/23). 
Although the Bonferroni method is conservative compared to other approaches, in our data 
it yielded conclusions similar to those of other (sequential) methods.92 Given the exploratory 
nature of these analyses and the fact that the trial was not powered to detect treatment effect 
moderators, our primary focus is on effect size and results should be interpreted accordingly. 
We used a “complete case” sample for the analyses.

To examine nonspecific predictors of improvement in outcomes, we constructed linear 
regression models with the change in outcome as the dependent variable and the potential 
predictors (including the baseline value of the outcome measure) as independent variables. 
Each potential predictor was evaluated in a separate model, which was also adjusted for age, 
gender, education, pain duration, and the baseline value of the outcome measure. Using the 
Bonferroni method, we defined statistical significance for a given nonspecific predictor as a 
P-value < 0.002 (0.05/22 to adjust for family-wise error rate over 22 comparisons).

Results

Moderators of treatment effects

Table 1 shows the numbers and proportions of participants in each of the three study groups 
with each baseline characteristic we examined. Results for each outcome are summarized 
below.

Moderators of Intervention Effects on Back Pain-Related Functional 
Limitations—Table 2 shows the results of analyses examining the effects of treatment 
on back pain-related functional limitations (as measured by the mRDQ) for the pre-specified 
subgroups of interest. Among the baseline variables examined, the largest differences 
observed were for the nonjudging subscale of the FFMQ-SF mindfulness questionnaire 
and pain self-efficacy. Comparing the effects of CBT vs. MBSR on functional limitations, 
CBT was superior to MBSR among participants who reported being less nonjudging of 
their thoughts and feelings (adjusted mean change from baseline to 8 weeks on the 0–23 
mRDQ −3.84 in CBT vs. −1.70 in MBSR; difference between treatments −2.14 [95% CI, 
−3.91, −0.37]), whereas MBSR was superior to CBT among those who reported being more 
nonjudgmental (adjusted mean change: −2.77 in CBT vs. −4.69 in MBSR; difference 1.92 
[0.29, 3.56]) (interaction P = 0.001, statistically significant with Bonferroni correction). 
The effect of CBT vs. UC on function was greater among participants with higher pain 
self-efficacy (adjusted mean change: CBT −4.40 vs. UC −1.42; difference −2.98 [−4.76, 
−1.20]) than among those with lower self-efficacy (adjusted mean change: CBT −2.18 vs. 
UC −1.89; difference −0.29 [−1.87, 1.29]) (P = 0.03), but this difference was not statistically 
significant with Bonferroni correction. No other comparisons were statistically significant.

Moderators of Intervention Effects on Pain Bothersomeness—Table 3 shows 
the results of analyses examining the effects of treatment on pain bothersomeness for 
the pre-specified subgroups of interest. The largest differences observed were for gender, 
depression, conviction that pain is a sign of physical harm, pain self-efficacy, and the 
nonjudging mindfulness subscale. Although none of these comparisons were statistically 
significant after Bonferroni correction, we describe below the effects for these subgroups 
given the potential fruitfulness of examining them in future confirmatory research.

The effect of CBT vs. MBSR on pain bothersomeness was greater among men (adjusted 
mean change on the 0–10 rating: CBT −1.51 vs. MBSR −0.93; difference −0.58 [−1.38, 
0.22]), whereas MBSR was superior to CBT among women (adjusted mean change: CBT 
−0.93 vs. MBSR −1.50; difference: 0.56 [−0.09, 1.22]) (P = 0.03). MBSR was superior to 
UC among women (adjusted mean change: MBSR −1.50 vs. UC −0.36; difference −1.13 
[−1.74, −0.53]) but not men (adjusted mean change: MBSR −0.93 vs. UC −1.15; difference 
0.21 [−0.71, 1.13]) (P = 0.02).

Baseline level of depressive symptoms was a potential moderator of the effects of CBT 
and MBSR on the 0–10 pain bothersomeness rating when using a PHQ-8 cut point of 5 
(mild level of symptoms or greater) but not when using a cut point of 10 (moderate or 
greater level of symptoms). CBT had greater benefit than MBSR among those with mild or 
greater depressive symptom severity (adjusted mean change: CBT −1.30 vs. MBSR −0.81; 
difference: −0.49 [−1.19, 0.20]), but MBSR had greater benefit than CBT among those 
with minimal or no depressive symptoms (adjusted mean change: CBT −0.99 vs. MBSR 
−1.76; difference: 0.77 [0.03, 1.51]) (P = 0.01). MBSR was superior to UC among those 
with minimal depressive symptoms (adjusted mean change: MBSR −1.76 vs. UC −0.31; 
difference: −1.45 [−2.16, −0.73]) but not among those with mild or greater depressive 
symptoms (adjusted mean change: MBSR −0.81 vs. UC −0.83; difference: 0.02 [−0.68, 
0.72]) (P = 0.004). The effect of CBT vs. UC on pain did not differ based on baseline 
depressive symptom severity.

Conviction that pain is a sign of bodily damage and the need to avoid activity, as measured 
by the SOPA Harm scale, was a potential moderator of the effects of CBT vs. UC on pain 
bothersomeness. CBT was superior to UC among participants with low conviction that pain 
is a sign of physical harm (adjusted mean change: CBT −1.54 vs. UC −0.39; difference: 
−1.14 [−1.84, −0.45]) but not among those with greater conviction that pain is a sign of harm 
(adjusted mean change: CBT −0.62 vs. UC −0.72; difference: 0.10 [−0.62, 0.83]) (P = 0.02). 
The effects of MBSR on pain did not differ by SOPA Harm scores.

MBSR was more beneficial than UC among participants with greater pain self-efficacy 
at baseline (adjusted mean change: MBSR −1.63 vs. UC −0.28; difference: −1.35 [−2.14, 
−0.56]) but not among participants with lower pain self-efficacy at baseline (adjusted mean 
change: MBSR −1.02 vs. UC −0.77; difference: −0.25 [−0.90, 0.40]) (P = 0.03). Pain 
self-efficacy did not modify the effects of CBT on pain bothersomeness.

Finally, the tendency to engage in a non-evaluative stance towards thoughts and feelings, 
as measured by the FFMQ-SF nonjudging subscale, was a potential moderator of the

effects of CBT vs. MBSR on pain bothersomeness. The benefit of CBT was greater among 
participants who reported being less nonjudging of their thoughts and feelings (adjusted 
mean change: CBT −1.31 vs. MBSR −0.86; difference: −0.46 [−1.22, 0.30]), whereas 
the benefit of MBSR was greater among those who reported being more nonjudgmental 
(adjusted mean change: CBT −1.04 vs. MBSR −1.65; difference: 0.61 [−0.09, 1.31]) (P = 
0.04).

Moderators of Intervention Effects on Depressive Symptoms—When examining 
depressive symptoms as the outcome, we observed the largest differences for the baseline 
depressive symptom subgroups (see Table 4), but no comparisons were statistically 
significant after Bonferroni correction. When using a PHQ-8 cut point of 10 (moderate 
or greater level of symptoms), CBT had greater benefit than UC among participants with 
moderate or severe baseline depressive symptoms (adjusted mean change on the 0–24 
depressive symptom scale: CBT −5.96 vs. UC −1.78; difference: −4.18 [−6.40, −1.97]) 
but not among those with mild or minimal symptoms at baseline (adjusted mean change: 
CBT −1.45 vs. UC 0.20; difference: −1.65 [−2.62, −0.68]) (P = 0.04). The benefit of 
MBSR vs. UC for depressive symptoms was greater among participants with moderate or 
severe baseline depressive symptoms (adjusted mean change: MBSR – 5.83 vs. UC −1.78; 
difference: −4.04 [−6.34, −1.75]) than among those with mild or minimal symptoms at 
baseline (adjusted mean change: MBSR −0.70 vs. UC 0.20; difference: −0.90 [−1.87, 0.08]) 
(P = 0.01). When using a cut point of 5 (mild level of symptoms or greater) to create 
baseline subgroups, improvement in depression was greater with CBT than with UC among 
participants with mild or greater baseline depressive symptoms (adjusted mean change: CBT 
−3.95 vs. UC −0.86; difference: −3.09 [−4.34, −1.84]) than among those with minimal 
symptoms at baseline (adjusted mean change: CBT −0.43 vs. UC 0.74; difference: 1.17 
[−2.47, 0.13]) (P = 0.04).

Post-Hoc Analysis for Moderators—Although the different treatment effects based on 
baseline pain self-efficacy were not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction, given 
the sizes of the treatment effects and the fact that differences were found for both functional 
limitations (CBT vs. UC) and pain bothersomeness (MBSR vs. UC), we conducted a post-
hoc analysis to examine whether those with high vs. low baseline pain self-efficacy differed 
in CBT and MBSR class attendance. We speculated that those with higher pain self-efficacy 
at baseline might have been more likely to attend more treatment sessions (due to belief 
that they could successfully apply the techniques taught to manage their pain) and thus 
benefit more from treatment. We previously reported that among the participants randomized 
to CBT or MBSR, those who completed at least 6 sessions had significantly higher pain 
self-efficacy scores at baseline.78 Our additional analyses revealed that, among those with 
high self-efficacy, 63% attended 6 or more classes vs. 47% of those with lower scores 
(chi-square = 6.10, P = 0.01).

Nonspecific Predictors of Improvement

predictors and baseline to 8-week change in outcomes, adjusting for treatment allocation

Control; P = 0.002) and greater endorsement of catastrophic thinking in response to pain 
(PCS; P = 0.005) were associated with greater improvement in functional limitations 
for participants regardless of assigned treatment group. Stronger belief in one’s personal 
control over pain (P = 0.03) was also associated with greater improvement in pain 
bothersomeness, as was college education (P = 0.049). Nonspecific baseline predictors of 
greater improvement in depressive symptoms were older age (P = 0.007), less widespread 
pain (P = 0.009), lower anxiety (GAD-2; P < 0.001), greater belief in one’s control over 
pain (SOPA Control; P < 0.001), and greater endorsement of mindfulness on the FFMQ-SF 
Acting with Awareness (P = 0.008) and Nonjudging (P = 0.008) scales. After Bonferroni 
correction for multiple comparisons, only anxiety and belief in one’s control over pain were 
statistically significant predictors of improvement in depression. No predictors of function or 
pain were statistically significant after correction.

Summary

Table 6 summarizes the baseline patient characteristics examined, and those hypothesized 
and observed (before and after Bonferroni correction) to be moderators and nonspecific 
predictors across the three outcomes examined. It can be seen that few characteristics 
were statistically significant after adjustment for the familywise error rate and there were 
inconsistencies in findings across outcomes examined.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first report from a large RCT of moderators and nonspecific 
predictors of treatment response to CBT vs. MBSR vs. UC for CLBP. After adjusting for 
multiple comparisons, only one baseline participant characteristic was associated with a 
statistically significant difference in response to CBT vs. MBSR. Below we discuss this 
finding, as well as results that, although not statistically significant after adjustment, may 
merit further study given their size and the possibility that Bonferroni correction may have 
resulted in defining as non-significant some effects that were “real.”

The only potential moderator that was statistically significant after correction was the 
nonjudging dimension of mindfulness. Although differences in effects of CBT vs. MBSR 
based on nonjudging were observed for both function and pain, the difference was 
statistically significant after correction only for function. Among participants who reported 
being less nonjudging of their thoughts and feelings, benefits were greater from CBT; among 
those who reported being more nonjudging, benefits were greater from MBSR. If confirmed 
in further studies, this finding suggests the potential clinical utility of this measure for 
guiding patients to MBSR vs. CBT.

In a trial of treatments for CLBP similar but not identical to those in our trial,19 participants 
reporting high levels of another dimension of mindfulness, mindful nonreactivity, showed 
greater improvement in physical function with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy than 
with mindfulness meditation. Consistent with our results, a moderating effect was not 
found for the FFMQ-SF Observing scale.19 Nonjudging was not examined. Although we 
did not find a moderating effect for nonreactivity, taken as a whole, these results support

the potential importance of mindfulness dimensions in selecting patients for mind-body 
interventions and in future research regarding moderators and treatment mechanisms.

As hypothesized, participants with greater depressive symptoms at baseline showed greater 
improvement in depressive symptoms with CBT and MBSR vs. UC, and with CBT vs. 
MBSR, although no comparisons were statistically significant after correction. These results 
suggest that the finding in the MAP RCT of CBT having greater benefit than MBSR for 
depression post-treatment13 may have been due largely to treatment differences among those 
who were more depressed. A meta-analysis of mind-body treatments for individuals with 
chronic pain found that mindfulness-based interventions are less effective for depression 
as compared with acceptance and commitment therapy, a type of CBT.89 Another meta-
analysis found that MBSR was not effective for mental health among patients with back 
pain.1 Further research is needed to confirm the possibility that more depressed individuals 
with chronic pain may show greater improvement in depression with CBT for pain than with 
MBSR.

Our hypotheses that the effects of CBT and MBSR vs. UC, and of CBT vs. MBSR, would 
be greater among participants with higher baseline levels of anxiety, pain, and disability 
were not confirmed. At the time we planned the study, little research had evaluated the 
effectiveness of MBSR for these problems. Subsequent research has provided more support 
for the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions as a group for depression and anxiety,29 
but not for benefits of MBSR for mental health or long-term benefits for pain and function 
among patients with back pain.1

Two exploratory psychological variables were identified as potential moderators: pain self-
efficacy and belief that pain is a sign of physical harm. Prior studies have found both to 
predict pain outcomes.20,37 Participants with higher pain self-efficacy benefited more from 
CBT vs. UC for functional limitations and from MBSR vs. UC for pain bothersomeness, 
although neither finding remained statistically significant after correction. A study of CBT 
for temporomandibular disorder pain also found greater benefits for those with higher pain 
self-efficacy.51 If individuals believe they can self-manage their pain, they may be more 
likely to engage in, and hence benefit from, treatment.72 This hypothesis is supported by 
our finding that participants with higher pain self-efficacy were significantly more likely to 
attend 6 or more classes of either intervention.

Participants with a low baseline belief that pain is a sign of physical harm improved more in 
pain bothersomeness from CBT vs. UC, although the effect was not statistically significant 
after correction. If this finding is confirmed in future studies, we speculate that patients 
with low harm beliefs, like those with greater pain self-efficacy, may be more receptive to 
engaging in CBT and practicing the skills taught, and hence more likely to benefit. Those 
with greater harm beliefs may be more focused on correcting the perceived biological causes 
of pain. Harm beliefs did not moderate any MBSR effects or any effects on functional 
limitations.

An exploratory demographic variable was identified as a potential moderator, although it 
was not statistically significant after correction: CBT improved pain bothersomeness more

than did MBSR among men, whereas MBSR was more effective for pain than was CBT 
among women. We are unaware of any prior research regarding gender differences in effects 
of mind-body treatments on pain. If this finding is confirmed, it has potential to be a fruitful 
area for future research. Treatment outcome did not vary substantially by other demographic 
characteristics examined, including age, which was found in a prior study to moderate 
effects of CBT for CLBP on function (greater response among younger patients).86

A secondary objective of this study was to identify participant characteristics associated 
with improvement regardless of treatment. Such knowledge may help inform clinical 
decision-making and covariate selection in clinical trials. Consistent with our hypothesis 
and prior studies,16,84 college-educated participants showed greater improvement in pain 
bothersomeness than did those with less education, although this was not statistically 
significant after correction. Given the potential for inequity in pain outcomes based on 
education level, it may be important to incorporate literacy-adapted CBT, which has been 
shown to be effective for low literacy populations.74,88

Among our other hypothesized nonspecific predictors (widespread pain, pain 
bothersomeness, functional limitations, expectations of improvement), only less widespread 
pain predicted improvement, and this association was not statistically significant after 
correction. Contrary to our hypotheses and past research,52,56,81,84,91 we did not find that 
higher expectations of improvement or lower levels of pain or disability at baseline predicted 
better outcomes at 8 weeks.

In exploratory analyses, lower anxiety and greater perceived control over pain were 
significantly associated with better depression outcomes irrespective of treatment. Multiple 
studies have reported similar findings for perceived control;11,20,38 as a group, these findings 
support the importance of perceived control and the potential benefit of interventions 
designed to increase patients’ confidence in their ability to control their pain.

A number of findings in our moderator and predictor analyses were statistically 
significant prior to, but not after, correcting for familywise Type I error rate. Previous 
studies provide conflicting evidence for pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, depressive 
symptoms, and treatment expectations as moderators and predictors in behavioral trials for 
pain.5,19,51,56,81,86 Differences in findings may reflect differences in sampling, interventions, 
measures, and statistical power to detect effects. It is possible that some of our findings 
were originally statistically significant due to chance, but we note that the RCT was not 
powered to detect moderator effects and we applied a conservative correction. Further 
research is needed to replicate our findings, which may be useful in generating hypotheses 
for confirmatory studies.

We acknowledge other study limitations. Approximately half of the participants randomized 
to MBSR or CBT attended at least 6 of the 8 sessions. Results could differ in studies with 
different numbers of sessions or treatment adherence rates. Study participants volunteered 
for a study of mind-body treatments for pain, had generally high expectations of benefitting, 
and had fairly low levels of psychosocial distress. The extent to which these findings 
would generalize to more highly distressed and disabled patients or those less receptive to

psychosocial treatments for pain is unclear. Finally, CBT was delivered in a group format in 
our study and results could differ for CBT delivered individually.

Despite these limitations, our study, by leveraging data from a large RCT, offers 
unique insights into potential moderators and nonspecific predictors of improvement with 
two evidence-based treatments for chronic pain, CBT and MBSR. Although only one 
potential moderator was statistically significant after applying a conservative correction 
for familywise error rate, other subgroup differences could indicate potentially clinically 
meaningful differences. Our findings point to specific patient characteristics that show 
promise for further investigation. If confirmed in future studies, such findings could have 
utility for patient-treatment matching, which could lead to improved allocation of limited 
resources and more cost-effective care, as well as to enhanced understanding of treatments 
mechanisms and potential ways to increase efficacy.

In conclusion, when considering our findings in the context of other studies, consistent, 
strong associations have not been found between any patient baseline characteristic and 
differential response to psychosocial interventions for chronic pain.5,19,81,86,88 Our findings 
are reassuring that patients with CLBP, regardless of these baseline characteristics examined 
to date, could reasonably expect to benefit from either CBT or MBSR.44 At least at 
this time, it appears reasonable for patient preference and treatment availability to guide 
treatment selection. Yet further research has the potential to shed light on variability in 
treatment response, optimal patient-treatment matching, and therapeutic mechanisms.

Few patient characteristics predicted benefits of CBT vs MBSR

Nonjudging of one’s thoughts/feelings predicted greater benefit from MBSR 
vs CBT

Less nonjudging of thoughts/feelings predicted greater benefit from CBT vs. 
MBSR

Pain control beliefs and lower anxiety predicted improvement regardless of 
treatment

Treatment effect defined as the difference between the two treatment groups in the 8-week change on the outcome measure within a given 
subgroup. Treatment effect estimates are coded such that negative treatment effects favor CBT and MBSR in their comparisons with UC, and CBT 
in the comparison of CBT and MBSR

†
P-value for test of differences between subgroups in treatment effects at 8 weeks

Bold font indicates P < 0.05; only comparisons with P < 0.002 were statistically significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Treatment effect defined as the difference between the two treatment groups in the 8-week change on the outcome measure within a given 
subgroup. Treatment effect estimates are coded such that negative treatment effects favor CBT and MBSR in their comparisons with UC, and CBT 
in the comparison of CBT and MBSR

†
P-value for test of differences between subgroups in treatment effects at 8 weeks

Bold font indicates P < 0.05; only comparisons with P < 0.002 were statistically significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Adjusted regression coefficients and 95% CIs were estimated using regression models that included the predictor of interest and adjusting for an 
indicator of treatment allocation and age, gender, education, pain duration, and baseline value of the outcome measure. The dependent variable 
was the change from baseline on the outcome measure. Regression coefficients reflect the average effect across all study arms. Negative regression 
coefficients indicate that higher values of the baseline characteristic were associated with greater improvement on the outcome measure; positive 
regression coefficients indicate that lower values of the baseline characteristic were associated with greater improvement on the outcome measures. 
For binary variables, the coefficient is the difference in adjusted mean change on the outcome measure between the two groups (e.g., for females, 
the decrease in mRDQ scores was 0.17 points more than it was for males; i.e., greater improvement in functional limitations). For continuous 
variables, the coefficient is the difference in adjusted mean change on the outcome measure associated with a 1-unit change in the predictor.

†

Coefficient for age represents the change in outcome associated with a 5-year difference in age Bold font indicates P < 0.05; only associations 
with P < 0.002 were statistically significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.
