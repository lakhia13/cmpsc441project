Background. Preliminary evidence suggests that psychological trauma, especially childhood trauma, is a risk factor for the onset of
fbromyalgia (FM). Objective. Te main objective of this study consisted of evaluating the prevalence and detailed characteristics of
psychological trauma in a sample of patients with FM, the chronology of trauma across the lifespan, and its clinical symptoms. We
also calculated whether childhood trauma could predict the relationship with diferent clinical variables. Method. Eighty-eight
females underwent an interview to assess sociodemographic data, psychiatric comorbidities, level of pain, FM impact, clinical
symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, quality of life, and psychological trauma. Results. Te majority of participants (71.5%)
met the diagnostic criteria for current post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants reported having sufered traumatic events
throughout their lifespan, especially in childhood and early adolescence, in the form of emotional abuse, emotional neglect, sexual
abuse, and physical abuse. Traumatic events predict both poor quality of life and a level of pain in adulthood. All patients showed
clinically relevant levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, and pain, as well as somatic comorbidities and poor
quality of life. Pain levels predicted anxiety, depression, dissociation, and insomnia symptoms. 84% of the sample sufered one or
more traumatic events prior to the onset of pain. Conclusions. Our data highlight the clinical complexity of patients with FM and the
role of childhood trauma in the onset and maintenance of FM, as well as the high comorbidity between anxiety, depression, somatic
symptoms, and FM. Our data also supports FM patients experiencing further retraumatization as they age, with an extremely high
prevalence of current PTSD in our sample. Tese fndings underscore the need for multidisciplinary programs for FM patients to
address their physical pain and their psychiatric and somatic conditions, pay special attention to the assessment of psychological
trauma, and provide trauma-focused interventions. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04476316. Registered on July 20th, 2020.

1. Introduction

including psychological

Fibromyalgia (FM) is considered the second most common
rheumatic disorder [1] and afects between 2% and 4% of the
population worldwide, in the majority of cases females [2].
In addition, FM is often diagnosed alongside chronic fatigue
syndrome (CFS), due to the overlap between their symptoms
and their underlying biological mechanisms [3]. Although
the etiology of FM remains unknown [4], several explana-
tions have been proposed for the onset of FM, including
genetic factors [5, 6], hormonal and immunological alter-
ations [7], nutritional aspects [4], and abnormalities in
central pain processing [4, 8] linked to the sensitization of
the central nervous system (CNS) [4, 5, 9]. In fact, the
sensitization of the CNS has been suggested as one of the
main pathophysiological changes involved in FM, involving
neurotransmitter imbalances, altered functional connectiv-
ity, and changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis, which infuence the autonomic nervous sys-
tem [5, 10, 11]. Interestingly, exposure to diferent chronic
or acute stressors,
trauma, has
a signifcant impact on the dysregulation of the HPA axis
[12]. Psychological trauma is defned as a stressful life event
that causes distress and exceeds an individual’s ability to
integrate the emotions and cognitions involved in the ex-
perience [13]. Tese events happen in an unexpected and
uncontrollable manner, putting the individual’s physical and
psychological integrity at risk, exceeding their coping re-
sources and leading to responses of helplessness and fear
[14]. In some cases, exposure to one or more traumatic
events can result in a diagnosis of PTSD [15, 16] or the
presence of traumatic symptoms that cause discomfort
without meeting the necessary criteria for a PTSD diagnosis
[17]. Trauma exposure can happen throughout the entire
lifespan of a person, but if it occurs during childhood, its
psychopathological and somatic consequences are severe
due to the vulnerability of the CNS during infancy and
adolescence [18,19]. In this sense, childhood trauma or
adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) encompasses various
forms of physical and emotional abuse or neglect, sexual
abuse, bullying, or household dysfunction experienced in
childhood. Along these lines, several studies have in-
vestigated the relationship between childhood trauma and
FM [5, 20–22], and have found a strong association. More
specifcally, these studies have shown that women diagnosed
with FM score higher on the childhood trauma question-
naire (CTQ) as compared to controls [23, 24] or other
medical conditions such as migraine, rheumatoid arthritis,
and myofascial pain syndrome [23, 25–27]. Further studies
showed a higher prevalence of emotional abuse [24, 25] and
physical neglect [23] in patients with FM compared with
controls, and higher scores in emotional abuse [25, 27],
emotional neglect [27], physical neglect [27], and physical
abuse [26], in comparison with patients afected by rheu-
matoid arthritis and migraine. All this data seems to indicate
that childhood trauma can be considered a risk factor for the

Pain Research and Management

development of unexplained physical pain [28, 29], espe-
cially for FM.

Despite all the studies that highlight the relationship
between childhood trauma and FM, few studies have col-
lected in detail the chronology of the traumatic events to
which these patients are exposed throughout their lifespan,
from infancy to adulthood, as well as information on
whether these events occurred mainly before or after the
onset of pain. Likewise, many studies have focused on
studying the correlation between trauma and pain. However,
there is a lack of studies on possible predictor variables that
explain the relationship between childhood trauma, pain,
and the presence of psychiatric comorbidities, which are
highly prevalent in this population and signifcantly afect
the functionality and quality of life of the patients.

Our study aimed to analyze the prevalence and clinical
characterization of traumatic events present in women with
a principal diagnosis of FM and to what extent these events
can predict pain levels, the presence and intensity of afective
symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, insomnia, and quality
of life.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Participants of the Study. Te study sample consisted of
90 female participants diagnosed with FM, who were con-
secutively derived from the rheumatology service (n � 42)
and from the adult mental health services (n � 30) of the Parc
de Salut Mar in Barcelona, Spain. Further participants
(n � 18) from the catchment area learnt about the study
through word of mouth or from local FM associations and
contacted researchers to voluntarily enroll. Te study was
conducted between January 2020 and January 2021. All
women were evaluated through an individual clinical in-
terview that lasted approximately 1.5 hours and was con-
ducted by two psychologists from the forum center research
unit. In some cases, the assessments were carried out in
person, but when participants were not able to attend the
interviews because of COVID-19-related restrictions, clin-
ical evaluations were carried out online.

Participants had to fulfll the following inclusion criteria:
(1) women with an FM diagnosis based on a clinical in-
terview aligned with the American college of rheumatology
criteria [30], and (2) aged between 18 and 70 years. Te
exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) comorbid chronic in-
fammatory or autoimmune disorders; (2) neurodegenera-
tive disorders, which can interfere in the development of the
clinical interviews; (3) severe mental disorders, namely bi-
polar disorder, schizoafective disorder, or schizophrenia. Of
note, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders were
not excluded as exclusion criteria due to the high prevalence
of these disorders in patients with FM; (4) present active
suicidal ideation; and (5) dependence or substance abuse
(except nicotine) in the previous month before the study
enrolment. Taking into account these criteria of the 90
participants, two women were excluded because of the

Pain Research and Management

diagnosis of an infammatory or autoimmune disorder;
therefore, the fnal sample consisted of 88 women.

Te investigation was developed in accordance with the
latest version of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved
by the ethics committee “Comit´e ´Etico de Investigaci´on
Cl´ınica del Parc de Salut Mar” (reference number: 2020/
9158). All participants gave written informed consent fol-
lowing a full explanation of the study before enrolling.

2.2. Clinical Outcomes and Assessment. In the clinical in-
terview, the evaluators gathered the data following a pre-
viously designed case report form (CRF) for the study. Te
CRF collected sociodemographic variables such as age, race,
educational level, marital status, employment status, psy-
chiatric and somatic comorbidities, and pharmacological
treatment. A series of validated scales were also administered
for the evaluation of pain and FM impact, psychological
trauma and associated symptoms, comorbid psychiatric
disorders, clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety,
insomnia, and quality of life. Te scales are detailed as
follows:

2.2.1. Pain and FM Impact

(1) Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain [31]: Tis scale
consists of a straight horizontal line, ranging from
0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain), which assesses
the pain severity at the moment of the clinical in-
terview. Scores are interpreted as “no pain” (0–2),
“mild pain” (2–4), “moderate pain” (4–6), “severe
pain” (6–8), and “maximum pain” (8–10).

(2) Pain disability index (PDI) [32]: Tis scale comprises
7 items referring to diferent aspects of life that can
be afected by chronic pain: home and family re-
sponsibilities, recreation, social activities, occupa-
tion, sexual activity, and life support activities. Each
item can be rated from 0 (no disability) to 10 (total
disability), and the total score is obtained by sum-
ming all the answers. Since there is currently no
validated Spanish version, this scale was translated
from the English version by a bilingual researcher.
(3) Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire [33], Spanish
validation (S-FIQ) [34]: Tis 10-item scale assesses
the impact of FM over the previous 7 days. Te frst
item contains 11 questions, which are related to
physical functioning; items 2 and 3 ask the person to
answer the number of days they have been unable to
work because of FM; and items from 4 to 10 are
scaled items (0–10), in which the person rates work
difculty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, rigidity,
anxiety, and depression. Higher scores signify lower
levels of functioning.

2.2.2. Psychological Trauma and Associated Symptoms

(1) Chronology of traumatic events: Tis tool consists of
a table, which gathers all the traumatic events re-
lifespan
ported by the participants over

their

according to their age when each occurred. Te table
is divided into fve-year segments spanning from 0–5
up to 65–70 years. For each segment, participants are
asked, “Do you remember having any traumatic or
stressful experiences when you were in this age
group?”. Answers are then coded using thematic
analysis. Traumatic events were then subsequently
categorized as one of the following: emotional abuse;
physical abuse; sexual abuse; emotional neglect;
physical neglect; parental violence; drug abuse by
a family member; parental mental disorder; parental
mental disorder; accident; physical violence in
adulthood; rape, abuse or sexual attack; harassment
or psychological maltreatment in adulthood; death
of a loved one; abortion; surgery; imprisonment,
detention, or kidnapping; illness of a frst-degree
relative; personal illness; pregnancy itself or preg-
nancy complications; personal separation or divorce;
familiar conficts;
mobbing; economic problems;
others (such as bullying, natural disasters, eviction,
or migration processes), or no traumatic event.

(2) Global assessment of post-traumatic stress ques-
tionnaire (EGEP-5) [35]: Tis 55-item scale assess
PTSD according to DSM-V criteria over the month
prior to the evaluation, based on the event from the
chronology currently causing the greatest level of
distress. It evaluates symptoms of intrusion, avoid-
ance, alterations in cognition, mood, arousal, and
reactivity, as well as duration and impact on func-
tioning, and determines the presence or absence of
PTSD, as well as specifying if depersonalization,
derealization, and/or delayed expression are present.

(3) Subjective unit of distress (SUD) [36]: this scale,
ranging from 0 (no distress) to 10 (maximum dis-
tress), evaluates the level of subjective perturbation
a person experiences when they bring to mind the
traumatic event chosen in the EGEP-5 scale.

(4) Holmes and Rahe social readjustment scale [37],
Spanish validation [38]: Tis scale lists 43 possible
stressful events, and participants must mark the
events that have happened to them in the previous 12
months. Each event has a diferent score, and the
global score is reached by summing all the scores of
the events selected. Scores under 150 indicate low
levels of stress, scores between 150 and 299 are
suggestive of a 50% risk of stress-related disorders,
and scores above 300 mean an 80% risk of sufering
stress-related disorders.

(CTQ)

[39],
(5) Childhood trauma questionnaire
Spanish validation [40]: Tis
self-applied scale
evaluates the presence of childhood trauma with 30
items (CTQ-T), which can be answered on a 5-point
Likert scale. Te CTQ measures 5 types of childhood
maltreatment: emotional (CTQ-EA), physical (CTQ-
PA), sexual abuse (CTQ-SA), emotional (CTQ-EN),
and physical neglect (CTQ-PN). Te numerical
answers correspond with responses ranging from

4

“never true” to “very often true”, and the fnal score
of each factor indicates severity in terms of “none to
minimal”, “low to moderate”, “moderate to severe”
and “severe to extreme”.

(6) Dissociative experiences scale (DES) [41], Spanish
validation [42]: Tis 28-item scale assesses the fre-
quency of the presence of diferent dissociative expe-
riences, excluding acute intoxication by substances.
Items are rated from 0% to 100%. Te total score is
obtained by summing all item answers and dividing
this result by 28. Tere are three diferent subscales,
such as amnesia (DES-A), depersonalization/de-
realization (DES-DP), and dissociation (DES-D). A
total score (DES-T) equal to or higher than 30 is
interpreted as a dissociative disorder.

(7) Somatoform dissociation scale-20 (SDQ-20) [43],
Spanish validation [44]: Tis questionnaire evaluates
the presence and intensity of 20 somatoform
symptoms or experiences that happened during the
last year. Participants are asked to rate the intensity
of each experience on a 5-point Likert scale and
whether there is a medical explanation for it. Te
total score is reached by summing the scores for each
item, while the symptoms with no known cause are
summed to reach the total of symptoms with no
known cause.

2.2.3. Diagnosis

(1) FM diagnosis: FM diagnosis based on a clinical in-
terview aligned with the American college of rheu-
matology criteria [30], which was carried out in all
participants.

(2) Psychiatric comorbidities: MINI neuropsychiatric in-
ternational interview [45], Spanish validation [46]: Te
MINI structured interview evaluates the presence of
psychiatric comorbidity according to DSM-IV criteria.
In the present research project, only the following parts
of the scale have been used for the assessment: major
depressive episode, dysthymic episode, manic/hypo-
manic episode, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social
phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and generalized
anxiety disorder. Te remaining MINI components
were not used because the data were covered by the
inclusion and exclusion criteria (substance dependence,
substance abuse, psychotic disorders, anorexia nervosa,
and bulimia nervosa), were collected during the clinical
interview (suicidality), or were assessed more exhaus-
tively by other specifc psychometric scales (PTSD).

2.2.4. Clinical Symptoms, Insomnia, and Quality of Life
Evaluation

(1) Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) [47],
Spanish validation [48]: Tis self-administered scale
measures the presence and intensity of anxious and
depressive symptoms in the previous 7 days. It
contains 14 items, seven for each of the subscales

(HADS-A for anxiety and HADS-D for depression),
which can be rated from 0 to 3. Te sum total of the
scores gives the overall score. Scores equal to or over
8 for each subscale can represent the presence of an
anxiety or depressive disorder.

(2) Athens insomnia scale (AIS) [49], Spanish validation
[50]: Tis scale evaluates the presence of insomnia
according to ICD-10 criteria. It evaluates distur-
bances in sleep over the previous week and consists
of 8 items. Te frst fve assess sleep induction,
awakenings at night, fnal awakening, total sleep
duration, and sleep quality, and the last three items
refer
functioning capacity, and
sleepiness during the day. All items can be rated from
0 to 3, providing a total score when summed between
0 and 24.

to well-being,

(3) Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) [51], Spanish
validation [52]: Tis self-applied scale consists of 5
items evaluating the self-perception of satisfaction
with one’s life. Each item can be rated from 1 (totally
disagree) to 5 (totally agree). Higher scores represent
higher levels of satisfaction.

3. Data Analysis

3.1. Sample Size Calculation. Given that the main objective
of this study was to investigate the relationship between
childhood trauma (CTQ) and FM pain (VAS pain), we
calculated the sample size needed to conduct a regression
analysis between CTQ and VAS pain. According to the
standard formula, the sample size required to detect
small correlations (R � 0.30) with 80% statistical power is
84. However, researchers decided to include all candi-
dates who were recruited between January 2020 and
January 2021 who signed the informed consent and met
inclusion criteria, even if the calculated number was
exceeded.

3.2. Statistical Analysis. All analyses were performed using
STATA statistics/data analysis, version 16.1 (StataCorp LLC,
Texas, USA). Fitness to parametric assumptions was checked
for all variables. To assess the normality of data distribution,
the Shapiro–Wilk test was used.

First, regarding the descriptive analysis of the socio-
demographic, medical, and clinical data (Tables 1 and 2), the
arithmetic mean was used for quantitative variables and the
proportion for categorical variables. In both cases, the
standard error and confdence
(95%) were
calculated.

interval

Second, simple linear regression has been used to analyze
whether diferent types of child maltreatment (CTQ mea-
sures) could predict diferent clinical variables, namely
anxiety and depression.

Tird, we also used the simple linear regression model to
analyze whether the scores obtained on the fbromyalgia
pain and impact scales (VAS, PDI, and S-FIQ) could predict
the clinical variables discussed above (HADS and AIS) and
the patients’ quality of life (SWLQ).

4. Results

4.1. Sample Characteristics. Te mean age of the 88 par-
ticipants in the sample was 51.41 years, with the majority
being married or in a couple, and Caucasian. According to
their employment status, a high number of them were on
sick leave (n � 31, 35.2%), unemployed (n � 31, 15%), or
unable to work due to mental health problems or other
problems (n � 23, 26%) (see Table 1).
Regarding the medical data of

the sample, other
comorbid axis III diagnoses were common, with the most
prevalent being chronic fatigue syndrome (60.2%), followed
by osteoarthritis (30.6%). Participants were prescribed
various pharmacological drugs, with the most frequent being
serotonin-
(60.9%);
anxiolytics/hypnotics
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (49.4%), par-
acetamol (36.7%), opioids (mainly tramadol and tapentadol,
22.7% and 9.1%, respectively) and anti-infammatory drugs
(35.2%) (see Table 2).

then,

According to the MINI, anxiety disorders (87.5% for
generalized anxiety disorder, 63.6% for panic disorder, and
29.5% for social phobia/agoraphobia) and mood disorders
(76.1% for major depressive disorder and 11.3% for dys-
thymia) were the most frequent psychiatric comorbidities.
Tese results were confrmed by higher current scores in the
HADS (anxiety MD � 14.34; SD � 0.39 versus depression
MD � 12.04; SD � 0.46). Participants showed marked scores
in the AIS (MD � 14.14; SD � 0.52) suggestive of sleep dis-
turbances and an important degree of dissatisfaction with
their lives according to the SWLS scores (MD � 11.78;
SD � 0.49). In terms of suicidal behavior, 82.9% of the
participants reported having had thoughts of suicide at some
point in their lives, and 32.9% had carried out at least one
suicide attempt in their lifetime, of which 4.5% used violent
methods (e.g. physical self-harming) and 27.2% nonviolent
methods (e.g. drug over-ingest), 13.6% sufered severe

consequences (e.g. hospitalization or physical lesions), and
18.18% nonsevere consequences (resolved without the need
to go to health services) (see Table 2).

As expected, subjective pain perception, measured
with the VAS, revealed high levels of pain (MD � 6.57;
SD � 0.23). Furthermore, we also found a marked degree
of disability (PDI MD � 46.12; SD � 1.21) with a generally
large negative impact of FM on daily functioning and
quality of life (S-FIQ MD � 55.58; SD � 1.06). Te average
number of years between the onset of pain and the di-
agnosis of FM in the sample was 9.10 (onset of pain:
M � 35.44,
FM diagnosis: M � 44.55,
SD � 11.93;
SD � 8.50) (see Table 2).

Te EGEP-5 scores revealed that 71.5% of the par-
ticipants met the criteria for PTSD in the last month. In
relation to the event chosen by each participant for the
administration of this scale, 34 women selected an event
that occurred in their childhood, 47 an event that oc-
curred in adulthood, and this data was missing for 7
participants. Te average score of subjective distress,
measured via SUD, was 8.23 (from 0 to 10, SD � 0.26),
indicating great psychological distress in relation to that
event (see Table 3). Total DES scores revealed low-to-
moderate levels of dissociative symptoms in our sample
(MD � 24.72; SD � 1.34); however, the dissociation sub-
scale of dissociative experiences obtained scores above
the cut-of point (MD � 36.26; SD � 1.86). Somatoform
dissociative symptoms, measured by the SDQ-20, con-
frmed the presence of a strong somatization tendency in
the sample (SD � 39.45; SD � 1.11), having an average of
4.76 symptoms with no known cause (SD � 0.3) (see
Table 3).

Our FM sample experienced low-to-moderate levels of
all types of child maltreatment in the CTQ, with both
emotional abuse (63.6%) and emotional neglect (62.5%)
being the most frequent maltreatment, followed by sexual

abuse (48.8%), physical neglect (40.9%), and physical
abuse (31.8%). Of note, minimization and denial in the
CTQ were controlled for. Furthermore, patients showed
an average of 7.64 (SD = 0.42) stressful events that hap-
pened during the last year and a high total score on the
Holmes and Rahe scale (MD = 224.52; SD = 13.16), which
is suggestive of a 50% risk of developing stress-related
disorders (see Table 3).

the exposed traumatic event

Regarding the chronology of traumatic events, the
highest number of these events occurred in the stages of
second childhood and early adolescence. However, a high
number of traumatic events were also reported during the
frst year of life (see Figure 1(a)). From Figure, it can also
be gathered that traumatic events in this population begin
to occur at very early ages and continue throughout all
lifespans, well into late adulthood or older age, changing
the typology of
(see
Figure 1(b)). Te most prevalent traumatic events to occur
between 0 and 15 years were physical abuse (n � 39),
sexual abuse (n � 32), and emotional abuse (n � 29) (see
Figure 2(a)), while the most prevalent type of traumatic
event in the sample after childhood and adolescence was
the death of a loved one (n � 71), followed by harassment
or psychological abuse in adulthood (n � 57), and other
experiences grouped in the category “other traumatic
events” (n � 39) (see Figure 2(b)). Interestingly, 84% of the
sample sufered from one or more types of traumatic
events prior to the onset of pain.

4.2. Simple Linear Regression. All linear regression results
can be gathered from Table 4. Hereby, 3 types of child
maltreatment (emotional abuse (CTQ-EA : F (1, 85) = 6.30;

p � 0.0140), emotional neglect (CTQ-EN : F (1, 86) = 12.94;
p � 0.0005), and physical neglect (CTQ-PN : F (1, 85) = 6.10;
p � 0.0155) predicted low quality of life (high scores on the
SWLS) in our sample. Te same was true for the total score
obtained on the CTQ (CTQ-T; F (1, 85) = 8.27; p � 0.0051)
and two measures of pain, the PDI and S-FIQ (F (1, 85)
= 8.69; p � 0.0041 and F (1, 85) = 8.08; p � 0.0056),
respectively.

In addition, linear regression analysis also showed that
higher scores in physical neglect signifcantly predicted
higher levels of pain in the VAS (CTQ-PN: F (1, 86) = 4.12;
p � 0.0455).

On the other hand,

linear regression showed that
higher scores in the pain measures and FM impact on
quality of life (VAS, PDI, and S-FIQ) signifcantly pre-
dicted the presence and intensity of depressive and
anxious symptomatology. More specifcally,
the VAS
signifcantly predicted both depressive (HADS-D: F (1,
86) = 3.99; p � 0.0489) and anxious (HADS-A: F (1, 86)
= 10.08; p � 0.0021) symptomatology, which was also true
for the PDI (HADS-D: F (1, 86) = 31.14; p � 0.0000);
HADS-A: F (1, 86) = 22.58; p � 0.0000) and S-FIQ scales
(HADS-D: F (1, 85) = 12.39; p � 0.0007); HADS-A: F (1,
85) = 27.16; p � 0.0000).

Likewise, the scores in the pain and in the FM impact
(VAS, PDI, and S-FIQ) also signifcantly predicted the
degree of dissociative experiences (DES). VAS signif-
cantly predicted both the total score (DES-T: F (1, 86)
= 4.31; p � 0, 0410) and the scores obtained in dissociation
(DES-D: F (1, 84) = 4.30; p � 0.0412). Te PDI signif-
cantly predicted the total score (DES-T: F (1, 84) = 10.50;
p � 0.0017) and the scores obtained in amnesia (DES-A: F

the S-FIQ (DES-T: F (1, 83) = 11.83; p � 0.0000), DES-A: F
(1, 83) = 8.61; p � 0.0043), DES-DP: F (1, 83) = 5.08;

Furthermore, linear regression analysis was also sug-
gestive that patient scores on pain and FM impact (VAS,
PDI, and S-FIQ) also signifcantly predicted sleep distur-
bance (AIS: F (1, 86) = 19.18; p � 0.0000; F (1, 86) = 8.94;
p � 0.0036; and F (1, 85) = 7.69; p � 0.0068, respectively).

5. Discussion

Te present study evaluated 88 patients with FM in detail
with regard to their sociodemographic and clinical data and
focusing on the prevalence and
biographical history,

characterization of psychological trauma across their life-
span and how it can predict the relationship with diferent
clinical variables.

To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few
studies that has assessed the characteristics of the traumatic
events sufered by a sample of women with FM in a sys-
tematic and chronological way. Te results have shown that
the most prevalent traumatic events categorized by age
occurred during childhood and adolescence, especially in the
form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional abuse,
but have continued into adulthood, modifying their typol-
ogy and presenting themselves mainly in the form of deaths
of loved ones, harassment and physical abuse, rape, abuse, or
sexual assault. Tese data are clinically relevant as they
suggest that female FM patients are chronically and re-
currently exposed to diferent types of stressful or vital
events throughout their lives, favoring the appearance of

than in mental disorders

a process of continuous retraumatization that would explain
the very high percentage of PTSD diagnoses in our sample.
In fact, 100% of the participants reported having sufered at
least one major traumatic event at some point in their lives,
and 84% had sufered one or more types of these traumatic
events prior to the onset of pain. Likewise, 71.5% of the
whole sample met the criteria for current PTSD, adding
a further comorbidity in this complex population. Tese data
are far higher than the prevalence data found in the general
population, which range from 0.2% to 3.8% [53], and also
such as depression
higher
(48–49%) [54], bipolar disorder (4% to 40%) [55], or sub-
stance use disorder (20.67%) [56]. It is important to note that
almost half of the sample (n � 34) was selected for the ad-
ministration of the EGEP-5, an event that occurred in
childhood that was the most signifcant traumatic event in
their lives. Tese data, therefore, once again highlight the
strong and enduring impact that childhood trauma can have
on health in adulthood. Our data not only reafrm the
existence of high comorbidity between PTSD and FM but
also confrm that individuals with comorbid pain and PTSD
report greater pain, PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety,
disability, and opioid use than people who only have one of
these conditions [57].

Regarding the results of the CTQ, our participants
presented low to moderate levels of all types of childhood
maltreatment, especially emotional abuse and emotional
neglect, followed by sexual abuse, physical neglect, and
physical abuse. Tese results are in line with other studies
which compared FM patients to controls or patients with
other pain conditions, where they found higher CTQ scores
in the FM group, with emotional abuse and neglect rep-
resenting the most frequent subtypes [24–27, 29, 58–60].
Other studies reported physical abuse and physical neglect as
being the frst [23] or the second most prevalent types of
maltreatment in patients with FM [24, 25, 27, 58]. Tese
were less frequent in our sample’s CTQ scores. Interestingly,
despite this, physical abuse and neglect were the most fre-
quently reported types of maltreatment in the chronological
evaluation of traumatic events in our participants. One
possible explanation for this phenomenon is that, although
physical maltreatment has been more present in the lives of
these women, emotional abuse and neglect have had
a greater impact from a psychological point of view. Tis
hypothesis would corroborate previous research that has
found not only that a lack of emotional warmth from pri-
mary caregivers is one of the greatest risk factors for the
development of both physical and mental disorders in both
that parental
adolescence and adulthood [61, 62], but
individual
is the most signifcant predictor of
support
resilience [63], quality of life in adulthood [64], and mental
health stability in any stage of life [65]. In fact, our results
show how the presence of child abuse, in particular emo-
tional abuse and emotional and physical neglect, predicts
a poorer quality of life in the women of our sample. In
addition, our results also emphasize that childhood trauma
is associated with greater severity of anxious and depressive
symptoms and sleep disturbances in adulthood. Terefore,
regardless of the order in which the diferent types of

maltreatment occurred, all these results underline the high
prevalence of childhood maltreatment in patients afected by
FM, supporting previous research that found childhood
trauma is not only a risk factor for developing several mental
disorders in adulthood, such as depression [66], but also for
the onset and maintenance of several chronic pain condi-
tions [61, 67]. Our data also showed that only physical
neglect could explain the pain reported by patients. A
possible explanation for these results could be that early
exposure to traumatic events may have long-term efects on
the developing nociceptive system. More specifcally,
physical and emotional stress could provoke alterations not
only in the proper functioning of the HPA axis, favoring
a hyperactivation of it, but also in the pain processing
system, favoring a lack of inhibition of nociceptive stimuli by
descending pain control mechanisms [68].

According to the Holmes and Rahe social readjustment
scale, we found a high prevalence of major stressors that
happened over the last year, compounding the prior pres-
ence of trauma-related stress and increasing its negative
impact on participants’ well-being. In fact, people with FM
sufer from more major life stressors than patients with
migraine [26], rheumatoid arthritis, and healthy controls
[69], which can be explained by the increased sensitivity to
stressful conditions and the high risk of retraumatization
they are exposed to. A recent study has found that cumu-
lative trauma and somatoform disorders increase the impact
of FM [70], which is in line with our work. Taking into
account the devastating efects of chronic stress on physical,
cognitive, and mental health [71], continued exposure to
trauma would increase the vulnerability of these women to
the development of diferent pathologies,
including the
appearance of pain and, consequently, psychological/psy-
chiatric comorbidities.

Although our results showed that scores on pain scales
predicted the occurrence of dissociation, participants
showed generally low dissociation scores on the DES scale,
with the exception of the dissociation subscale, where our
patients scored highly. Te general low scores in dissociation
are surprising, taking into account the aforementioned
trauma load and high prevalence of PTSD in our sample, and
also considering that dissociation is a very common phe-
nomenon in people sufering from PTSD. A possible ex-
planation for this could be that psychotropic medication
improves dissociative symptoms by exerting an inhibitory
efect on the central nervous system. However, this hy-
pothesis needs further data because pharmacological studies
available in this feld are scarce and inconclusive [72].
Another explanation could be that patients with FM tend to
express physically traumatic memories. Te appearance of
medically unexplained symptoms could occur due to the
disconnection between mind and body because of the im-
pact of traumatic experiences, followed by an amplifcation
it is in-
of subthreshold body sensations [70]. Hereby,
teresting that our FM patients scored high on the SDQ-20,
which represents somatoform dissociative disorders. Other
studies has demonstrated that FM is associated with high
levels of somatoform dissociation [58], in comparison with
controls [70] and other functional somatic syndromes (FSSs)

12

Pain Research and Management

[73]. Furthermore, previous results suggested a direct as-
sociation between childhood trauma and somatoform dis-
orders [58, 70, 73, 74], showing childhood trauma can
predict the impact and the severity of FM.

Additionally, we detected a very high prevalence of
psychiatric comorbidities such as generalized anxiety dis-
order (87.5%), major depressive disorder (76.13%), and
panic disorder (63.6%), and a lower but still important
prevalence of social phobia/agoraphobia (29.5%), followed
by dysthymia (11.3%), and fnally obsessive-compulsive
disorder (3.4%). Tis underlines the complexity and mul-
tidiagnostic nature of FM patients and is in line with pre-
vious literature, which reports that psychiatric comorbidity
among FM, anxiety, and mood disorders is common and is
a factor that can complicate medical prognosis [23,75]. Of
note here, we excluded bipolar disorder, schizoafective
disorder, and schizophrenia, whereas we cannot provide
prevalence data accordingly. Furthermore, we observed that
FM patients received a number of psychotropic drugs, most
frequently anxiolytics/hypnotics (60.9%), antidepressants
(SNRI: 49.4%; SSRI: 20.6%; others: 37.9%), followed by
various
anti-in-
analgesics
fammatories: 35.6%), opioids
(mainly tramadol and
tapentadol, 22.7% and 9.1%, respectively) and antipsychotic
medication (9.1%), indicating again the high comorbidity
between FM and mental sufering. Some of the medications
used, such as duloxetine, have the ofcial indication to be
prescribed for FM patients.

(paracetamol:

36.7%;

Our results not only confrm the high anxiety and de-
pression scores in our sample but also that the scores ob-
tained by the participants in the pain and fbromyalgia scales
(VAS, PDI, and S-FIQ) signifcantly predict the presence and
intensity of depressive and anxious symptomatology. Tis
bidirectionality has been reported in previous literature
showing that mental disorders, such as depression or anx-
iety, can be a consequence of living with chronic pain [76], as
well as a history of a mental disorder being considered a risk
factor for developing chronic pain [77].

Of note, 82.9% of the participants in the present study
reported suicidal ideation in their history, while 32.9% re-
ported suicide attempts. Tese data confrm the high
prevalence of suicidal behaviors in patients sufering from
chronic pain compared to the general population [9].
According to previous literature, there is a whole set of risk
factors that could favor suicidal behaviors, such as psy-
chological stress, sleep disturbances, the experience of fa-
tigue, dizziness, and weakness, depression, female gender,
and physical comorbidities like headaches and gastric dis-
eases [9, 78–81]. Terefore, as suicidal behavior is highly
prevalent due to clinical manifestations of FM and its
psychiatric comorbidities, it needs to be assessed routinely in
patients with FM. Te same is true for sleep alteration in FM
patients. Our results are in agreement with other studies,
which have shown a high prevalence of sleep disturbances [6,
23, 82], which can be explained not only by pain and the
direct impact of FM, but also by the presence of other axis III
diagnoses, and mood and anxiety comorbidities [83, 84].
Our data revealed that 93.2% of our sample sufered from
sleep alterations, which is higher than in previous studies,

estimating that almost 80% of patients with FM present poor
sleep [85]. Interestingly, poor sleep is strongly and dose-
dependently associated with pain symptom severity in FM
patients [86], at the same time as interfering with the ability
to cope with pain [87], resulting in tiredness and poor
quality of life [82, 88].

Finally, our sociodemographic characteristics provide
insight into the high co-occurrence of various axis III di-
agnoses, including CFS (60.2%), confrming the overlap
between both diagnoses [3,89], osteoarthritis (30.6%), spinal
disc herniation (11.3%), low back pain (10.2%), and chronic
migraine (10.2%). In addition, we also detected thyroid
diseases (9%) and restless leg syndrome, rheumatoid ar-
thritis, and chemical sensitivity syndrome (all of them be-
tween 5% and 6%) as somatic comorbidity. Tis confrms the
high prevalence of physical comorbidity in FM patients and
the challenges of fnding adequate treatment for two or more
somatic disorders [75]. Similar to previous studies, partic-
ipants reported severe levels of both pain and disability [24,
27, 90, 91], which was entirely expected given that FM is
characterized by severe widespread musculoskeletal pain
throughout the body that ends up having repercussions in
diferent areas of the person’s life and, consequently, afects
their quality of life. Moreover, the delay between the onset of
pain and the clinical diagnosis of FM of the participants was,
on average, almost 10 years, which may have afected their
functioning and recovery processes. In fact, FM patients
consider the lack of a clear explanation of the etiology and
their doubts about the authenticity of the illness to be key
factors in the delay in receiving a diagnosis. Both aspects are
related to the lack of understanding and support from family
and friends due to a lack of understanding of the nature of
the illness and stigma [9], something that frequently occurs
in mental disorders [92].

Several limitations have to be considered when translating
our results into clinical reality. Te frst limitation is that we did
not include a matched control group to compare our results
with those of the FM group, which needs to be taken into
account when interpreting and generalizing our results. Sec-
ond, we did not control for possible psychiatric drug efects that
could be interfering with the clinical manifestations reported by
the participants. Tird, the sample comprised solely female
participants, so we do not know whether these results can be
extrapolated to the male population. However, previous data
shows that mainly female patients are afected by FM [30].
Fourth, the participants were recruited mainly from two ser-
vices of our hospital, with the constraints that this entails: we
might have missed FM patients who are attended by their
general practitioner with lower levels of pain, clinical severity,
and disability. Fifth, the method for assessing trauma varied
between trauma-specifc scales and an individual’s chrono-
logical interview by self-report, meaning it can be afected by
recall bias and an individual’s subjective interpretation [93].
However, a prior study emphasizes the importance and clinical
relevance of subjective memories in a recent natural human
behaviour publication [94]. Te authors compared in a cohort
of 1196 children both objective, court-documented evidence of
maltreatment and subjective reports of their childhood mal-
treatment histories, and found psychopathology in adulthood

to be associated with subjective rather than objective measures
of experience of childhood maltreatment. Furthermore,
amnestic dissociation might alter the recall process;
in-
terestingly, we detected very low scores in amnestic dissocia-
tion, which further underlines the consistency of subjective
recalls. Finally, we did not evaluate nonpharmacological in-
terventions in FM, such as physical exercise or others, which
can exert a positive efect on anxiety and depression.

Te strengths of our work included the exhaustive
evaluation of psychosocial and clinical data; a detailed
evaluation of psychological trauma and its impact on par-
ticipants by using validated psychometric tools; and a de-
tailed knowledge of the chronology of traumatic events,
allowing us to sequence the appearance of pain in their lives.
Furthermore, the homogeneity between raters has helped to
obtain data, reducing observational bias.

6. Conclusions

Our data highlight the complex comorbidity of FM patients
with somatic disorders, psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety,
depression and PTSD, highly prevalent suicidal behavior, and
sleep alterations. Patients with FM, who are usually treated by
rheumatologists, receive multiple psychotropic and analgesic
medications, with often unsatisfactory results [95]. Our data
specifcally emphasize the importance of psychological trauma,
especially childhood trauma, in the onset and maintenance of
pain. However, close monitoring and treatment of psycho-
logical trauma are also indicated across the lifespan of FM
patients. Tis should encourage clinicians to assess psycho-
logical trauma routinely and to include trauma-focused ther-
apies within established multidisciplinary health care
professionals, following existing FM guidelines [96]. Future
research lines should test the trauma-focused intervention in
FM and could also clarify the trauma-based etiology of FM in
comparison to other FSSs, medically unexplained symptoms,
somatic symptoms, and related disorders following the DSM-5.
