Abstract 
Background:  Low personal agency is the concept of attributing successes and failures to external factors rather than 
personal characteristics. Previous research supported links between low personal agency and symptoms of borderline 
personality disorder (BPD). The present research followed patients in an outpatient dialectical behavioural therapy 
(DBT) group from intake to 12 months follow up to examine the impact of personal agency on outcome.

 57, age 18–72, 91.5% female) were assessed at intake, after three months of DBT treatment, 

Methods:  Patients (N 
and 12 months follow up on measures of symptoms and personal agency. Three separate measures were used to 
assess treatment outcomes: the BPD Checklist, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5), and the Mental Health 
Inventory (MHI-5).

=

Results:  Mixed model analyses found BPD symptoms significantly reduced as a result of DBT treatment and were 
maintained at follow-up. However, 47% of participants continued to meet BPD criteria 12 months later, despite treat-
ment. Regression analyses indicated that low personal agency at intake was associated with higher BPD symptom 
severity at post-treatment and 12 month follow up. In addition, low personal agency at intake was associated with 
greater levels of negative affectivity at post-treatment. Personal agency did not relate to levels of depression and 
anxiety.

Conclusions:  Despite the reductions in BPD symptomology, personal agency did not significantly change over time. 
Those with lower agency at intake continued to do more poorly at follow up. We speculate that poor outcomes may 
be contributed to by patients’ lack of engagement in recovery due to poor agency and an external locus of control. As 
such, therapeutic approaches, like DBT, may require additional strategies to appropriately target low personal agency. 
Further research is needed to understand if other treatment protocols may facilitate positive change in personal 
agency.

Background
Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  is  a  psychologi-
cal  disorder  characterised  by  impairments  of  self  and 
interpersonal  functioning  [1].  Individuals  with  BPD 
tend  to  experience  and  display  pervasive  patterns  of

instability  [1].  Particularly, 

interpersonal 
individuals 
with BPD may experience fears of abandonment, intense 
interpersonal relationships, identity disturbances, impul-
sivity, self-harm or suicidal behaviours, emotional lability, 
emptiness,  difficulty  controlling  anger,  and  dissociation 
[1].  Previous  research  highlighted  that  depression  and 
anxiety  were  highly  comorbid  with  the  presentation 
of  BPD  [2–4].  Previous  research  found  that  individu-
als with BPD demonstrate greater severity of depression 
and  anxiety  symptoms  compared  to  those  with  other

personality  disorders  and  those  with  a  mood  disorder 
only  [4],  whereas  others  [2,  3]  found  no  significant  dif-
ferences  in  depression  severity  for  those  with  comorbid 
BPD and depression.

The  evidence  base  for  treating  BPD  has,  over  time, 
demonstrated  modest  reductions  in  symptoms  follow-
ing treatment BPD [5–7]. Dialectical behavioural therapy 
(DBT)  is  considered  a  good  psychotherapeutic  treat-
ment  for  BPD  targeting  four  key  areas  –  mindfulness, 
interpersonal  effectiveness,  distress  tolerance,  and  emo-
tion  regulation  [6].  A  review  examining  the  efficacy  of 
psychotherapy  for  BPD  found  that  DBT  and  psychody-
namic  approaches  were  moderately  more  effective  than 
control  interventions  (e.g.  CBT,  supportive  therapy)  [7]. 
Authors  further  note  high  levels  of  publication  bias  and 
significant  differences  in  duration  and  type  of  follow-up 
design. In addition, meta-analytic reviews note there are 
some  reported  benefits  in  reduced  suicidality  and  self-
harm, increased emotion regulation and problem-solving 
abilities  [8].  Studies  of  75  RCTs  have  shown  DBT  and 
mentalization-based treatment (MBT) were the primary 
interventions  studied  and  results  found  significant  dif-
ferences  in  the  reduction  of  BPD  symptoms  using  both 
of  these  approaches  compared  to  treatment  as  usual 
(TAU) [9]. It was further explained that these therapeutic 
approaches may reduce depression symptoms compared 
to TAU but this finding was uncertain [9].

Personal agency

Personal agency represents the type of effortful behaviour 
a person makes towards maintaining and improving their 
circumstances  and  may  relate  to  the  experience  of  BPD 
and the degree to which people engage in treatment and 
recovery from mental health challenges. It can be opera-
tionalized  on  a  continuum,  where  high  personal  agency 
relates  to  an  internal  locus  of  control  (LOC)  focus,  and 
low  personal  agency  corresponds  with  external  LOC 
focus.  Locus  of  control  (LOC)  refers  to  the  degree  that 
individuals attribute successes and failures to themselves 
or others [10]. Research has showed that individuals pre-
senting  with  high  personal  agency  tended  to  attribute 
outcomes as dependent on their own personal character-
istics (e.g., the effort that they put into a task), while those 
who  presented  with  low  personal  agency  often  believed 
outcomes  were  a  direct  result  of  external  factors  (e.g., 
luck, chance, or fate) [11, 12]. There has been conflicting 
evidence  on  the  stability  of  personal  agency  over  time. 
Some  studies  [13–15]  suggested  that  personal  agency  is 
a trait that is stable over life, while other studies [16, 17] 
proposes that this may change over time.

Previous research suggested that individuals with low 
levels  of  personal  agency  tend  to  experience  greater 

psychopathology  [18–23].  Scant  research  expands 
this  knowledge  into  the  relationship  between  personal 
agency  and  BPD  specifically  [24–28].  A  recent  study 
found that greater personal agency was associated with 
lower levels of BPD symptoms [29]. Two studies exam-
ined  changes  in  personal  agency  following  therapeutic 
intervention  in  clinical  samples  [30,  31].  Both  studies 
found  that  following  treatment,  individuals  reported 
significant changes in personal agency and greater con-
trol over their emotions. In a community sample, lower 
personal agency was associated with greater BPD symp-
tomology,  as  well  as  with  insecure  adult  attachment 
styles [24]. An association was also found between low 
personal agency and high BPD symptomology in stud-
ies  utilising  community  samples  [26],  while  Watson 
[25] found an association between low personal agency 
and personality disorders symptoms in general.

The  relationships  between  personal  agency  and 
broader  symptoms  beyond  BPD  such  as  pathologi-
cal  personality  traits  and  mood  and  anxiety  symptoms 
have been less explored. An older study suggested that 
greater  self-regulation  (which  is  related  to  higher  per-
sonal agency) can mediate the effects of negative affect 
[32].  Understanding  the  impact  of  personal  agency  on 
pathological  personality  traits  and  mood  and  anxiety 
may be relevant as previous studies indicate that both of 
these factors may negatively impact treatment outcome 
[33–37]. Despite the previous literature examining BPD 
and personal agency [24, 26, 28, 29, 31], little is known 
about  how  these  two  constructs  interact.  In  addition, 
there  is  minimal  knowledge  regarding  the  influence  of 
personal agency on treatment outcomes within a clini-
cal  sample.  The  present  study  addressed  these  gaps  in 
the  literature  by  examining  personal  agency  within 
individuals  with  BPD  undergoing  a  DBT  program  and 
assessing the role of personal agency in treatment out-
comes. First, it was expected that BPD symptom sever-
ity will significantly reduce over the course of the DBT 
treatment.  Previous  longitudinal  studies  have  shown 
changes in BPD symptom severity following treatment; 
however,  there  were  inconsistencies  on  whether  these 
changes remain over time [29, 38]. Secondly, consistent 
with  previous  research  [24–28],  it  was  expected  that 
there  will  be  a  relationship  between  personal  agency 
and  BPD,  such  that  low  personal  agency  will  be  asso-
ciated  with  greater  BPD  symptomology.  Finally,  given 
research  suggesting  that  personal  agency  may  be  rel-
evant  to  the  experience  of  BPD,  it  was  hypothesized 
greater  personal  agency  may  be  associated  with  more 
marked  changes  in  BPD  symptomology  after  therapy 
and  at  12-month  follow-up.  No  previous  studies  have 
examined the impact of personal agency on BPD symp-
toms over time and in response to therapy.

Method
Aim and study design

The  present  study  was  structured  as  a  pilot  study  and 
aimed to address gaps in the literature by examining per-
sonal  agency  within  individuals  with  BPD  undergoing  a 
DBT program and assessed the role of personal agency in 
treatment outcomes.

Treatment

Patients  with  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  attended 
a  three-month  outpatient  DBT  group  at  a  local  hospital 
where they gave written informed consent to participate. 
The  psychiatrist  conducted  an  initial  assessment  with 
the  patient  and  provided  a  diagnosis  prior  to  attending 
the DBT program. Following this, the treating psycholo-
gist  and  the  researcher  worked  together  to  confirm  or 
amend  the  diagnosis  based  on  clinical  symptoms  pre-
sent during the program along with results of self-report 
questionnaires.  From  this,  the  psychiatrist,  psycholo-
gist,  and  researcher  together  finalised  a  diagnosis.  The 
group  was  semi-open,  where  new  participants  entered 
every  four  weeks  during  a  mindfulness  session.  Stand-
ard  DBT  protocols  were  administered  in  the  outpatient 
program [6, 39]. The program was run by a clinical psy-
chologist and an intern psychologist once a week for five 
and a half hours. The breakdown of the program was as 
follows:  1)  morning  session  for  an  hour  and  a  half  for 
homework review, 2) 30-min break, 3) middle session for 
an hour and a half for didactic learning and skills train-
ing,  4)  30-min  lunch  break,  5)  afternoon  session  for  an 
hour and a half for skills training and homework setting. 
Mindfulness  skills  were  used  in  each  session.  Manuals 
were followed for adherence to validated DBT protocols, 
and  two  DBT  trained  authors  lead  the  groups.  In  addi-
tion,  therapeutic  alliance  checks  were  independently 
made to ensure treatment was well received by patients. 
Therapeutic  alliance  was  assessed  using  a  brief  form  of 
the  Penn  Helping  Alliance  Questionnaire  [40].  At  post-
treatment,  results  showed  that  93%  of  participants  felt 
their  therapists  were  warm,  supportive,  and  helpful  and 
92% of participants felt as though they worked well with 
their therapists.

Participants
The sample consisted of 57 adults (Mean age = 35.86 years, 
SD = 13.61,  Range = 18–72).  Patients  all  had  current  or 
lifetime  BPD  and  various  comorbid  diagnoses.  Comor-
bid  diagnoses  included  depression,  anxiety,  PTSD,  and 
bipolar  disorder,  diagnosed  by  the  treating  psychologist 
and  psychiatrist.  The  sample  was  predominately  female 
(91.5%  at  intake,  92.1%  at  post-treatment,  and  90.5%  at 
follow-up).  The  study  had  an  attrition  rate  with  23.37% 
of  the  sample  withdrawing  from  intake  to  follow-up. 

Post  treatment  assessment  retained  37  adults  (mean 
age = 34.81,  SD = 11.65,  range = 19–56),  and  41  adults 
(mean  age = 37.80,  SD = 13.32,  range = 20–72)  were 
assessed  at  12-month  follow-up.  Four  were  unable  to 
be assessed at post treatment were able to be assessed at 
12  months,  leading  to  a  slightly  higher  follow-up  rate. 
Those who dropped out of the study or were unable to be 
assessed  did  not  significantly  differ  when  compared  on 
intake  clinical  characteristics  to  those  who  were  retained 
according  to  independent  samples  t-tests  on  measures  of 
personal  agency  (p = 0.57),  BPD  (p = 0.20),  and  MHI-5 
(p = 0.95)  or  on  demographic  details  such  as  gender 
(p = 0.06) and age (p = 11.13). Further demographic details 
are indicated in Table 1.

Depression and anxiety

The  Mental  Health  Inventory  (MHI-5)  [41]  was  used  to 
assess  current  depression  and  anxiety  symptoms.  The 
MHI-5 was a five-item measure and is one of the domains 
of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) [42]. It asked how partici-
pants have been feeling over the past two weeks. Exam-
ples of questions include, “Have you been a very nervous 
person?”  Each  item  had  six  alternative  answers,  ranging 
from “all of the time” to “not at all”, with a sum score from 
5  to  30.  The  scores  were  then  transformed  to  a  0–100 
scale with high scores indicating good mental health [41]. 
Previous  researchers  [43]  reported  the  internal  consist-
ency  in  their  community  sample  to  be  high  at  α = 0.84 
in a community sample. In the current study, the MHI-5 
was used as a continuous variable and reliability analyses 
were α = 0.74 for intake, α = 0.82 for post-treatment, and 
α = 0.83 for follow-up.

Personal agency

The  Mental  Health  Locus  of  Control  Scale  (MH-LOC) 
[44]  measured  personal  agency.  Scores  (22–132)  can 
be  understood  as  indicating  internal  locus  of  control  or 
external  locus  of  control,  with  scores  of  77  at  the  mid-
point. Low scores reflected a more internal locus of con-
trol (greater personal agency) and high scores reflected a 
more external locus of control (poorer personal agency). 
In the original study (44), the mean scores of participants 
was  74.14  (SD = 11.19),  α = 0.84.  Reliability  analyses  of 
the  MH  LOC  for  the  current  full  sample  were  α = 0.56 
for  intake,  α = 0.76  for  post-treatment,  and  α = 0.70  for 
follow-up.

BPD symptoms

Presence  and  severity  of  BPD  symptoms  were  assessed 
using  the  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  Checklist 
(BPD CL) [60]. A cut-off score of 7 or higher on the MSI-
BPD  indicated  a  likely  diagnosis  of  BPD  and  suggested 
high  sensitivity  (0.81)  and  specificity  (0.85).  Reliability

Pathological personality traits

The  Personality  Inventory  Brief  Form  for  the  DSM-5 
(PID-5-BF)  [45]  was  used.  It  comprises  25  items  that 
assess  maladaptive  personality  traits.  Items  were  rated 
based  on  how  accurately  they  describe  participants 
from  0  (very  false  or  often  very  false)  to  3  (very  true 
or often true). Each subscale consists of five items and 
are:  negative  affectivity  (e.g.,  “I  worry  about  almost 
everything”),  detachment  (e.g.,  “I  don’t  like  to  get  too 
close  to  people”),  antagonism  (e.g.,  “It’s  no  big  deal  if 
I  hurt  other  peoples’  feelings”),  disinhibition  (e.g.,  “I 
feel  like  I  act  totally  on  impulse”),  and  psychoticism 
(e.g., “I have seen things that weren’t really there”) [45]. 
Higher  total  scores  were  indicative  of  greater  overall 
personality  dysfunction,  ranging  from  0  to  75  [45].  In 
addition,  each  subscale  ranged  in  scores  from  0  to  15, 
with  higher  scores  indicating  greater  dysfunction  in 
the specific personality trait domain [45]. All subscales 
demonstrated  high  reliability.  At  intake,  reliability 
estimates  were:  negative  affectivity  α = 0.77,  detach-
ment  at  α = 0.62,  antagonism  at  α = 0.78,  disinhibition 
at  α = 0.81,  and  psychoticism  at  α = 0.9.  At  post-treat-
ment,  reliability  for  negative  affectivity  was  recorded 
as  α = 0.86,  detachment  at  α = 0.76,  antagonism  at 
α = 0.52,  disinhibition  at  α = 0.82,  and  psychoticism  at 
α = 0.86.

Data analysis

Data  was  collected  at  three  time  points  –  intake,  post-
treatment  and  at  follow-up.  Intake  data  was  collected 
prior  to  participants  first  treatment  session,  post-treat-
ment collected 12 weeks after intake, and follow-up col-
lected  12  months  after  intake.  Data  were  de-identified 
and  inputted  into  SPSS  statistical  analysis  software. 
Patients  were  grouped  into  two  classifications  of  cur-
rently  meeting  BPD  criteria  (scores  of  100  or  greater) 
or  not  currently  meeting  BPD  criteria  (scores  of  99  or 
lower)  using  the  BPD  CL.  Mixed  model  analyses  were 
performed including all data across the time points, with 
BPD symptoms as the dependent variable. Linear regres-
sion  analyses  were  used  to  examine  the  role  of  personal 
agency  on  treatment  outcome  measures.  A  Bonferroni 
correction  of  the  p-value  was  used  to  correct  for  mul-
tiple  testing.  For  each  correlation,  seven  possible  tests 
were  conducted  (BPD  symptoms,  MHI-5  scores,  and 
PID-5  domains:  negative  affect,  detachment,  disinhibi-
tion, antagonism, psychoticism. The adjusted p-value was 
0.007 with the α of 0.05 and the level of comparisons as 7. 
Using this adjusted p-value, personal agency at intake is 
still correlated with BPD symptoms. In addition, personal 
agency  at  intake  did  not  correlate  with  any  post-treat-
ment or follow-up measures using the adjusted p-value.

Results
A  mixed  model  analysis  was  used  to  determine  changes 
in  BPD  symptoms  over  time.  Data  were  reformatted 
based  on  three  time  points  with  BPD  symptoms  as  the

dependent  variable  and  time  as  the  factor  [46].  Results 
found significant reductions in BPD scores over the course 
of  the  DBT  group  program.  Results  suggest  a  significant 
reduction  of  BPD  scores  on  the  BPD  Checklist  by  17.04 
points from intake to post-treatment (b = -17.04, t = -2.25, 
p = 0.03, 95%CI[-32.02, -2.05]). Results remained stable at 
follow-up, with a reduction of 17.21 points from intake to 
follow-up  (b = -17.21,  t = -2.37,  p = 0.02,  95%CI[-31.60,-
2.82]).  Results  suggest  that  BPD  symptom  severity  sig-
nificantly decreased as a result of treatment and remained 
stable over 12 months.

In  addition,  the  distribution  of  participants  meeting 
BPD  criteria  over  time was explored using  the  full sam-
ple.  Results  demonstrated  across  the  entire  sample,  at 
intake, approximately 65% of participants met criteria for 
BPD based on scores of 100 or greater on the BPD CL. At 
post-treatment, 40% of the sample meet criteria for BPD 
and  at  follow-up,  47.5%  meet  criteria  for  BPD.  When 
looking at only the participants who met criteria for BPD 
at intake, approximately 71% still met criteria for BPD at 
post-treatment and 78% still met criteria for BPD at fol-
low-up. These results showed that over time, the number 
of  participants  meeting  criteria  for  BPD  reduced,  with 
less  than  half  of  the  sample  still  meeting  criteria  at  fol-
low-up. In addition, the majority of participants who met 
criteria  at  intake  continued  to  meet  criteria  over  time, 
supporting  previous  research  that  has  demonstrated 
challenges in achieving remission over time [47].

To  assess  whether  personal  agency  influenced  treat-
ment  outcomes,  specifically,  BPD  symptoms,  a  hierar-
chical  regression  analysis  was  used  to  examine  the  role 
of personal agency on BPD symptom severity over time. 
The first block was BPD scores at intake, as this variable 
was  controlled  for  and  the  second  block  was  personal 
agency  at  intake.  Personal  agency  at  intake  was  used  as 
the  independent  variable  and  BPD  scores  at  post-treat-
ment was the dependent variable. The results of the first 
block  revealed  that  BPD  scores  at  intake  was  signifi-
cant  and  explained  49%  of  the  variance  [(R2 = 0.49,  F(1, 
33) = 31.88,  p = 0.00)].  The  second  block  also  revealed 
a  significant  model  and  explained  50%  of  the  variance 
[(R2 = 0.50, F(2, 32) = 15.98, p = 0.00)]. These results sug-
gest  that  when  controlling  for  intake  BPD  severity,  per-
sonal agency at intake was associated with BPD scores at 
post-treatment.

Next,  a  hierarchical  regression  analysis  was  also  used 
to  examine  the  role  of  personal  agency  on  BPD  symp-
tom severity at follow-up. The first block was BPD scores 
at  intake,  as  this  variable  was  controlled  for  and  the 
second  block  was  personal  agency  at  intake.  Personal 
agency  at  intake  was  used  as  the  independent  variable 
and  BPD  scores  follow-up  was  the  dependent  variable. 
The results of the first block revealed that BPD scores at 

intake was significant and explained 30% of the variance 
[(R2 = 0.30, F(1, 38) = 16.04, p = 0.00)]. The second block 
also  revealed  a  significant  model  and  explained  32%  of 
the variance [(R2 = 0.32, F(2, 37) = 8.65, p = 0.00)]. These 
results  suggest  that  when  controlling  for  intake  BPD 
severity, personal agency at intake may also be associated 
with BPD scores at 12 month follow-up.

Pathological personality traits and levels of depression 
and anxiety were also used as treatment outcomes. A lin-
ear  regression  was  used  to  examine  the  role  of  personal 
agency on anxiety and depression symptom severity over 
time. All assumptions specific to each statistical test were 
checked  prior  to  analyses.  All  variables  displayed  viola-
tions of normality. No outliers were detected and tests for 
assumptions  of  linearity,  multicollinearity,  and  homoge-
neity of variance were satisfied. Personal agency at intake 
was  used  as  the  independent  variable  and  the  MHI-5 
scores  at  post-treatment  was  the  dependent  variable. 
Results indicated that personal agency at intake was not 
associated with depression and anxiety symptom severity 
at  post-treatment  [(R2 = 0.03,  F(1,  25) = 0.82,  p = 0.38)]. 
Next,  a  linear  regression  analysis  examined  personal 
agency  at  intake  with  depression  and  anxiety  symptoms 
at follow-up. Results similarly found that personal agency 
at intake was not associated with BPD symptom severity 
after  12  months  [(R2 = .-0.02,  F(1,  38) = 0.41,  p = 0.53)]. 
These regression analyses suggest that personal agency at 
intake  was  not  associated  with  levels  of  depression  and 
anxiety.

Furthermore,  a  linear  regression  was  also  used  to 
examine  the  role  of  personal  agency  on  the  severity  of 
pathological personality traits over time. Personal agency 
at  intake  was  used  as  the  independent  variable  and  the 
PID-5  total  scores  at  post-treatment  was  the  depend-
ent  variable.  Results  indicated  that  personal  agency  at 
intake was not associated with the severity of pathologi-
cal  personality  traits  at  post-treatment  [(R2 = -0.01,  F(1, 
34) = 0.64,  p = 0.43)].  Next,  further  regression  analyses 
were  used  to  examine  the  role  of  personal  agency  on 
the  specific  domains  of  personality  pathology  at  post-
treatment.  Results  indicated  personal  agency  at  intake 
was associated with negative affectivity at post-treatment 
 [R2 = 0.12,  F(1,  34) = 5.96,  p = 0.02)].  Personality  pathol-
ogy  was  not  assessed  at  follow-up  and  thus  no  associa-
tions can be made.

To understand the cross-sectional relationship between 
intake personal agency and other measures, correlational 
analyses were undertaken. Personal agency at intake cor-
related  with  the  following  intake  measures:  BPD  symp-
toms  (r = 0.32,  p = 0.01)  and  negative  affect  (r = 0.26, 
p = 0.05). Personal agency at intake did not relate to BPD 
symptoms  (r = 0.18,  p = 0.31)  or  the  MHI-5  (p = 0.38)  at 
post-treatment. Personal agency at intake correlated with 

 Hashworth et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:566 

Page 6 of 9

negative affect (r = 0.39, p = 0.02) at post-treatment. Per-
sonal  agency  at  intake  correlated  with  BPD  symptoms 
(r = 0.33,  p = 0.04)  at  follow-up  but  did  not  correlate 
with  the  MHI-5  (r = 0.10,  p = 0.53).  The  PID-5  was  not 
assessed at follow-up.

Does personal agency change during treatment?

Personal  agency  did  not  change  over  time,  with  mean 
scores  at  intake  of  80.19,  post  treatment  78.19,  and  fol-
low  up  81.93  (Table  2).  Statistical  analysis  showed 
no  change  from  intake  to  post-treatment  (M = -0.17, 
SD = 11.64,  t = -0.09,  df = 35,  p = 0.93)  or  intake  to  fol-
low-up  (M = 2.35,  SD = 13.62,  t = 1.09,  df = 39,  p = 0.28) 
(Table  2).  Overall,  no  significant  shifts  occurred  in  per-
sonal agency, despite changes in BPD severity, suggesting 
in this sample it was stable and resistant to change.

Discussion
This  pilot  study  followed  patients  attending  group  DBT 
intake  through  three-month  termination  and 
from 
12 month follow up. As expected, DBT therapy led to sig-
nificant  reductions  in  BPD  symptoms  over  time,  which 
were maintained at follow up. In addition, depression and 
anxiety symptoms did not significantly reduce as a result 
of  treatment.  Given  these  results,  it  is  possible  that  this 
form of outpatient DBT group may be successful in reduc-
ing BPD symptoms but may not be as effective in treating 
depression and anxiety symptoms. The lack of significant 
change in mood disorder symptoms from this study were 
contradictory  to  previous  research  [48,  49].  This  may  be 
explained by the large focus on BPD symptoms in group 
settings, as individual mood and anxiety symptoms would 
not be explored and targeted.

When  controlling  for  BPD  scores  at  intake,  personal 
agency  showed  a  significant  relationship  to  BPD  symp-
tom  scores  at  post-treatment  and  follow-up.  Personal 
agency at intake was not however associated with depres-
sion  and  anxiety  symptoms  at  any  of  the  three  time 
points. Personal agency at intake was also associated with 
higher  levels  of  PID-5  negative  affectivity  at  post-treat-
ment. These  results  highlight  the  important  role  of  per-
sonal agency, not only at the start of treatment, but also 
throughout  the  intervention,  and  suggest  this  may  be  a 
key  factor  influencing  therapeutic  change.  These  results 
were  consistent  with  previous  research,  which  indicated 
that  low  personal  agency  was  associated  with  greater 
BPD  symptom  severity  [29].  In  addition,  these  results 
were  consistent  with  studies  indicating  high  personal 
agency is associated with successful treatment outcomes 
[50–52].  It  is  important  to  note  that  these  correlational 
results  may  also  be  due  to  an  underlying  third  variable, 
for example, adverse childhood experiences, schemas, or 
comorbid diagnoses. As a result, the correlational analy-
ses should be interpreted with caution.

Almost half of the sample still met criteria for BPD at 
follow-up (47%). In addition, the majority of participants 
who met criteria at intake continued to meet criteria over 
time.  A  recent  systematic  review  found  that  approxi-
mately  half  of  the  sample  did  not  respond  to  treatment 
for BPD, which may be consistent with the results of this 
study [47]. It was unclear if the participants in the study 
did not respond to DBT protocols or if they did respond 
but  were  not  yet  recovered.  As  discussed,  the  definition 
of recovery in BPD was unclear and needs further explo-
ration [53–57]. In this study, it is possible that DBT may 
have  be  reducing  symptoms  of  BPD  but  three  months

of  treatment  may  not  be  effective  enough  to  obtain  full 
recovery  from  the  diagnosis.  In  addition,  since  personal 
agency has been identified as one of the key factors that 
supports  recovery  from  BPD  [54],  further  research  may 
be  needed  to  understand  the  role  of  personal  agency  in 
BPD recovery if personal agency is resistant to change.

Strengths and limitations

There are a number of limitations worth noting. First, due 
to hospital requirements, it was not possible to conduct 
independent clinical or diagnostic interviews on patients 
prior  to  their  participation  in  the  study.  To  account  for 
this  limitation,  the  diagnostic  presentations  and  suit-
ability  were  verified  with  the  treating  psychologist  and 
referring  psychiatrist,  as  described  in  the  Method  sec-
tion.  Second,  as  indicated  in  previous  research  [11,  24], 
the  MH  LOC  has  limited  research  around  its  use,  par-
ticularly in clinical populations. Despite this, it was reli-
able  and  the  face  validity  was  acceptable.  Third,  it  was 
unclear  whether  participants  sought  additional  medi-
cal or psychological support over the 12 months follow-
ing treatment. It is possible that results at follow-up may 
be  influenced  by  further  care.  Fourth,  the  small  sample 
size may impact the generalizability of the results of this 
study.  Fifth,  the  nature  of  the  DBT  protocols  adminis-
tered may not be comparable in an inpatient and outpa-
tient  setting.  Additionally,  BPD  symptoms  may  present 
as  more  severe  in  an  inpatient  setting  along  with  lower 
psychosocial  functioning.  As  a  result,  it  is  possible  that 
the  results  of  this  study  may  not  be  generalizable  to  an 
inpatient sample of individuals with BPD. Finally, though 
this  sample  consisted  of  clinical  treatment-seeking  indi-
viduals, a control group was not utilised. As a result, find-
ings should be interpreted with caution and may not be 
generalisable to other samples and other treatments.

Clinical implications and future research

The novelty of these findings can assist in filling a gap 
in  the  literature  and  may  benefit  clinicians  treating 
people with BPD. We suggest that clinicians may ben-
efit from assessing personal agency at different points 
throughout  therapy  while  also  making  conscious 
efforts  to  increase  their  patient’s  sense  of  autonomy, 
self-responsibility,  and  self-control.  Regular  assess-
ment  will  further  determine  whether  personal  agency 
is stable over time and this needs additional study. Par-
ticular clinical strategies that may be useful in identify-
ing  and  increasing  personal  agency  include  work  that 
suggests  increasing  mindful  awareness  of  strengths 
and  limitations,  and  cognitive  restructuring  can  be 
helpful  [58,  59].  From  the  results  of  the  study,  clini-
cians may find that understanding personal agency lev-
els in the early stages of treatment may assist in being 

able to anticipate degree of change over time. This may 
be an asset for clinicians to be able to approximate the 
duration  or  frequency  of  treatment  needed,  according 
to levels of personal agency.

It  may  be  beneficial  for  future  research  to  examine 
whether  ongoing  treatment  over  time  would  impact 
personal agency and BPD symptoms compared to those 
who do not continue longer term treatment. In addition, 
future  research  may  consider  developing  a  treatment 
protocol  for  individuals  with  BPD  that  specifically  tar-
gets levels of personal agency. To conclude, low personal 
agency  can  be  understood  to  be  related  to  greater  BPD 
but may not be related to mood and anxiety symptoms. 
In addition, personal agency may be a stable variable and 
may be resistant to change. The results of this study sug-
gest  that  personal  agency  may  be  associated  with  BPD 
symptom severity over time, which may clinically inform 
the  duration  and  frequency  of  treatment  for  individuals 
with  BPD.  The  authors  highlight  the  preliminary  nature 
of  these  results  and  recommend  further  replication. 
Future research is needed to further understand the link 
between low personal agency and BPD.

Conclusions
Low  personal  agency  at  the  start  of  treatment  appeared 
to  inhibit  treatment  progress  over  12  months.  Within 
this study, personal agency was stable and did not signifi-
cantly change as a result of treatment. This suggests that 
personal  agency  may  be  resistant  to  change  following 
DBT  treatment.  It  may  be  beneficial  for  future  research 
to develop a treatment protocol that may be able to target 
and  increase  personal  agency  more  specifically.  Though 
DBT has been shown to be effective in treating BPD [7–
9], no known research illustrates whether it may be effec-
tive  in  improving  personal  agency.  In  the  present  study, 
participants level of personal agency did not significantly 
increase or decrease as a result of treatment.
