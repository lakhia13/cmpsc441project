Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented threat to global mental health. Children
and adolescents may be more susceptible to mental health impacts related to their vulnerable developmental
stage, fear of infection, home conﬁnement, suspension of regular school and extracurricular activities, physical
distancing mandates, and larger scale threats such as global ﬁnancial recessions and associated impacts. Our
objective was to review existing evidence of the COVID-19 pandemic’s global impact on the mental health of
children and adolescents <19 years of age and to identify personal and contextual factors that may enhance
risk or confer protection in relation to mental health outcomes. Methods: We conducted a search of peer-
reviewed and preprint research published in English from January 1, 2020, to February 22, 2021. We included
studies collecting primary data on COVID-19-related mental health impacts on children and adolescents. We
graded the strength of included articles using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine rating scheme.
Results: Our search and review yielded 116 articles presenting data on a total of 127,923 children and adoles-
cents; 50,984 child and adolescent proxy reports (e.g., parents, healthcare practitioners); and >3,000 chart
reviews. A high prevalence of COVID-19-related fear was noted among children and adolescents, as well as
more depressive and anxious symptoms compared with prepandemic estimates. Older adolescents, girls, and
children and adolescents living with neurodiversities and/or chronic physical conditions were more likely to
experience negative mental health outcomes. Many studies reported mental health deterioration among chil-
dren and adolescents due to COVID-19 pandemic control measures. Physical exercise, access to entertainment,
positive familial relationships, and social support were associated with better mental health outcomes. Conclu-
sions: This review highlights the urgent need for practitioners and policymakers to attend to and collaborate
with children and adolescents, especially those in higher risk subgroups, to mitigate short- and long-term
pandemic-associated mental health effects.

mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and response measures.
In this review, children and adolescents were found to experience more depressive and anxious symptoms
than reported prepandemic rates, speciﬁcally with high levels of fear and concern regarding the impact of
COVID-19 on their lives.
Factors associated with worse COVID-19 mental health outcomes were older adolescent age, female gen-
der, neurodiversity, and the presence of chronic physical conditions.

(cid:129) While this review captures emerging data, study designs that utilize validated measures and undertake lon-

gitudinal data capture will greatly improve understanding of impacts.

(cid:129) Pandemic-associated negative impacts on child and adolescent mental health are clear and must be moni-

tored and addressed as societal restrictions are lifted to mitigate short- and long-term impacts.

Introduction

Pandemics and other large-scale emergencies have the
potential to negatively affect mental health during the
event and long after. In response to the COVID-19 pan-
demic, mitigation measures have interrupted in-person
learning, social and community networks, recreational
activities and access to health care, challenging access
to important routines, social structures, resources, and
supports. While these measures are necessary to pre-
vent an escalating public health emergency, prolonged
isolation and home conﬁnement may lead to
social
immediate and long-term mental health and well-being
challenges (Kaufman, Petkova, Bhui, & Schulze, 2020;
Wang, Zhang, Zhao, Zhang, & Jiang, 2020). Short-term
factors contributing to mental distress during the
COVID-19 pandemic include concerns about SARS-
CoV-2 infection and subsequent health impacts, social
isolation, and worsening social determinants of mental
health such as socioeconomic stressors resulting in
stress and increased mental illness (Aknin et al., 2021).
For instance, a longitudinal survey in the United King-
dom of over 50,000 individuals found that the propor-
tion reporting clinically signiﬁcant levels of mental
distress rose from 19% in 2018 to 27% in April 2020, one
month into the COVID-19 lockdown (Pierce et al., 2020).
Mental health impacts of disasters, such as depres-
sion, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance
use disorder, as well as domestic violence and child
abuse, have been identiﬁed in settings such as the after-
math of the SARS epidemic, 9–11, Hurricane Katrina,
and other humanitarian emergencies (Furr, Comer,
Edmunds, & Kendall, 2010; Galea, Merchant, & Lurie,
2020; Purgato et al., 2019; Sprang & Silman, 2013; B.
Tang, Liu, Liu, Xue, & Zhang, 2014; Tang, Deng, Glik,
Dong, & Zhang, 2017; Tol et al., 2011). The cumulative
effect of multiple risk factors and inadequate protective
factors can reduce mental well-being and increase vul-
nerability to mental illness emergence (World Health
Organization, 2014). Individuals at risk may experience
new onset of mental illness, while those with pre-existing
mental health conditions may experience symptomatic
worsening, especially if mental health service access is
impeded (Moreno et al., 2020). The unprecedented reach
of COVID-19 pandemic impacts necessitates urgent
population-level monitoring of mental health to optimize
efforts for prevention and mitigation of its effects.

Pre-existing vulnerabilities, such as socioeconomic
disadvantage, neurodiverse needs, or disability may
increase risk of poor mental health outcomes during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Organizational closures and phys-
ical distancing requirements have reduced social contact
and support, compromising food security in some cases
and secondary oversight of child and adolescent emo-
tional and physical safety (Poole, Fleischhacker, & Ble-
ich, 2021; Salt et al., 2021; Swedo et al., 2020). Students
who rely on special education, lack digital access or
tools, or live in unstable home settings risk falling
behind their (peers) as schools move online. In the
rapidly evolving context of the pandemic as well as litera-
ture and evidence-generation elucidating mental health
impacts of the pandemic on children and adolescents,
we seek to build on reviews capturing early pandemic
impacts (Ara(cid:1)ujo, Veloso, Souza, Azevedo, & Tarro, 2020;
et al., 2021; Nearchou, Flinn, Niland,
Meherali

Subramaniam, & Hennessy, 2020) and report on child
and adolescent mental health impacts one year into the
COVID-19 pandemic. Our systematic review aims to
summarize population-level impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on global child and adolescent mental health
as captured in the year following its onset, contextual
factors inﬂuencing impacts, as well as to identify protec-
tive factors that may mitigate these impacts.

Methods

Search strategy
In this review, we searched for peer-reviewed and preprint arti-
cles describing COVID-19-related mental health changes
among children and adolescents (<19 years of age) made avail-
able in English from January 1, 2020, to February 22, 2021. We
registered a protocol for this review (https://doi.org/10.17605/
OSF.IO/B94AC) with the Open Science Framework (Snell &
Samji, 2021). We searched nine electronic databases: MED-
LINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science,
medRxiv, PsyArxiv, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
Health Literature (CINAHL). We used a predeﬁned search strat-
egy (Table S1) to extract articles from MEDLINE, PsycINFO,
PubMed, and EMBASE. This strategy did not use available
database ﬁelds to ﬁlter results by language. We modiﬁed these
keywords and patterns as necessary to identify articles using
search engines offered by CINAHL, Web of Science, medRxiv,
PsyArxiv, and Scopus.

Selection criteria
We included studies which assessed stratiﬁed mental health
outcomes for young people 0-18 years of age related to the
COVID-19 pandemic. We deﬁned mental health outcomes as
broadly as possible, including studies which measured changes
in the prevalence or symptoms of mental illness, overall mental
health or well-being, mental health service utilization, and other
emotional or behavioral characteristics. Mental health out-
comes could be (a) quantitatively or qualitatively measured,
and/or (b) derived from child and adolescent self-report or from
caregivers, caretakers, teachers, or other adults reporting on
the mental health of young people they supervise. Gray litera-
ture and non-English language articles were not eligible for
inclusion and were thus removed during screening. Studies
focusing exclusively on the direct or indirect effects of COVID-
19 on physical health or on mental health service adaptation in
response to the pandemic were excluded. Controlled trials
exclusively assessing mental health interventions and sec-
ondary analyses of primary data such as reviews, editorials,
and letters were also excluded. Figure 1 describes the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) ﬂowchart of our literature search.

Article screening and extraction
We used Covidence systematic review software (https://www.
covidence.org/) to remove duplicate entries and coordinate arti-
cle screening. In a two-stage process, a team of ﬁve coders ﬁrst
reviewed article abstracts and then full-text manuscripts for eli-
gibility. Two coders completed a data extraction template for
each article screened for inclusion. This template included ﬁelds
for study location, period, design, target population and sample
size, measurement tools, and mental health outcomes. When
possible, coders extracted relevant outputs of quantitative anal-
yses, including any reported effect sizes, descriptions of mea-
surement uncertainty, and results of signiﬁcance tests. Coders
also assigned keywords to each study to identify common fac-
tors and outcomes, which included protective and resilience
factors. Resilience was conceptualized as a process, rather than
a trait or outcome, and deﬁned as an individual’s ability to cope
with a crisis mentally or emotionally; to move forward in a posi-
tive manner despite adversity; or to adapt successfully to a pan-
demic that threatens their viability, function, or development
(de Terte & Stephens, 2014; Southwick et al., 2014). We

assessed evidence quality using a rating scheme modiﬁed from
the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine ranging from
one to ﬁve, with lower scores denoting higher-quality evidence
(Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, n.d.). We graded qualita-
tive studies at ‘4’ on this scale to denote that they collected
cross-sectional data. We descriptively summarized results of
data extraction considering high heterogeneity in study designs,
populations, mental health outcomes, and measurement tools
represented in included articles.

Results

Study design and quality
A total of 116 articles representing more than 127,923
children and adolescents met inclusion criteria and were
included in the systematic review. Using the Oxford
quality scoring system, four articles were given a rating
of two (prospective cohort design) (Gassman-Pines, Ana-
nat, & Fitz-Henley, 2020; Munasinghe et al., 2020;
Shek, Zhao, Dou, Zhu, & Xiao, 2021; Xiang, Yamamoto,
& Mizoue, 2020) and 24 were given a rating of three

88 articles were given a rating of four, indicating cross-
sectional or qualitative study design. A variety of stan-
dardized tools were used across studies to assess mental
health, psychological and psychiatric diagnostic out-
comes. The most commonly used tools included the
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) (15/116),
the Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire (SDQ) for

mental well-being (14/116), and the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (13/116), and the Centre for Epi-
demiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) for depres-
sive disorder (7/116).

Study populations
The 116 articles presented data on a total of 127,923
children, and adolescents; 50,984 child and adolescent
proxy reports (i.e., parents, guardians, healthcare prac-
titioners); and over 3,000 charts were reviewed across
seven articles (although speciﬁc chart numbers reviewed
were not reported in many studies frequently many did
not specify the number of charts reviewed). The majority
of studies described general population ﬁndings while a
third of studies focused on speciﬁc population sub-
groups including those with neurodiverse conditions
such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deﬁ-
(ADHD), and obsessive-
cit hyperactivity disorder
compulsive disorder (OCD)
(Amorim et al., 2020;
Asbury, Fox, Deniz, Code, & Toseeb, 2020; Breaux et al.,
2021; Colizzi et al., 2020; Conte, Baglioni, Valente,

et al., 2020; Graziola et al., 2020; Jefsen et al., 2020;

Theis, Campbell, De Leeuw, Owen, & Schenke, 2021;
Zhang, Shuai, et al., 2020). Other studies focused on
speciﬁc populations such as children and youth with
inﬂammatory bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic respiratory
conditions, and neuromuscular disorders (Alshahrani
et al., 2020), and LGBTQ-identifying adolescents (Fish
et al., 2020).

Eight studies contained results on child and adoles-
cent populations accessing psychiatric services during
the pandemic (Bothara et al., 2021; Cheek et al., 2020;
Chen, She, et al., 2020; Diaz de Neira et al., 2020; Fer-
rando et al., 2020; Leeb et al., 2020; Leff et al., 2021; Tro-
mans et al., 2020).

All of the data collection in the studies included in this
review was undertaken between January and November
2020. By key phases in the progression of the pandemic,
studies collected COVID-19-related data from January
to February (20/116), March to May (91/116), June to
August (25/116), and September to November (2/116).
The greatest number of studies were conducted in Eur-
ope (39/116), followed in diminishing order by East Asia
(28/116), North America (21/116), South Asia (7/116),
Australasia (7/116), West Asia (6/116), South America
(2/116), South-East Asia (2/116), Sub-Saharan Africa
(1/116), and North Africa (1/116). Two studies involved
multiple countries or were international in focus. Study
period, sample size, gender distribution, population,
mental health-related assessment tool, and location for
each included study are further detailed in Table S2.

Age distribution
The majority of articles focused entirely on child and
adolescent populations ≤18 years of age. However, 24
studies also included populations ≥18 years (Alamrawy,
Fadl, & Khaled, 2021; Banati, Jones, & Youssef, 2020;

Thirteen studies targeted primary school populations
(<12 years) (Alonso-Mart(cid:1)ınez et al., 2021; Chen, Chen,

2020; Zhou, Yuan, et al., 2020; Zhou, Wang, et al.,
2020), while 16 studies did not report the range or
grades of their child and adolescent population (Abawi
et al., 2020; Alivernini et al., 2021; Amorim et al., 2020;
Amran, 2020; Colizzi et al., 2020; Ezpeleta et al., 2020;

2020; Yue, Zang, Le, & An, 2020; Zorcec, Jakovska,
Micevska, Boskovska, & Cholakovska, 2020). The
remaining 60 articles targeted a combination of children
and adolescents in primary, middle, and/or high school.

Factors and outcomes
The following factors and outcomes emerged in our
review and were used to categorize ﬁndings: mental
health-related outcomes (depressive symptoms; self-
harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide; anxiety symptoms;
COVID-19-related fear, concern, and worry; general
mental health; mental health service utilization; other
mental health outcomes); demographic factors (age, gen-
der); contextual factors (pandemic control measures;
social connection; family relationships; technology use
and media consumption; and population factors (neuro-
diverse children and adolescents; chronic physical con-
ditions; additional resilience and protective factors)). We
used frequency of reporting and strength of ﬁndings to
organize the mental health-related outcomes section.

Mental health-related outcomes
COVID-19-related fear, concern, and worry. Thirty-ﬁve
articles discussed COVID-19-related fear, concern, or
stress in children and adolescents (Abawi et al., 2020;

Zhou, Yuan, et al., 2020). The most reported COVID-19-
related fear was fear of infection of either themselves or,
more commonly, fear of infecting a vulnerable loved one
(Abawi et al., 2020; Abdulah et al., 2020; Adibelli &
Sumen, 2020; Alshahrani et al., 2020; Anbarasu & Bhu-
vaneswari, 2020; Asbury et al., 2020; Banati et al.,

2021; Xie et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2021; Zhang, Zhang,
et al., 2020; Zhou, Yuan, et al., 2020). An Indian
study noted that 23% of children kept a daily count of
deaths and hospitalizations from COVID-19 (Shah et al.,
2021).

Other reported reasons for fear and concern during
the COVID-19 pandemic included fear of not being able
to cope with academic workload and worries about the
impact of COVID-19 on the school year and future plans
(Anbarasu & Bhuvaneswari, 2020; Ellis et al., 2020;
Kılınc(cid:1)el et al., 2020; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Scott et al.,
2021). For example, a study in Canada showed that 73%
of adolescents surveyed in April 2020 were ‘very con-
cerned’ about the impact of COVID-19 on their school
year (Ellis et al., 2020). Young people in two studies also
reported fear of becoming socially isolated from their
friends (Kılınc(cid:1)el et al., 2020; Scott et al., 2021).

Increased feelings of

fear and concern regarding
COVID-19, measured via the ‘Fear of COVID-19 Scale’
and other COVID-19-speciﬁc questionnaires, were
found to be cross-sectionally associated with higher
levels of depressive and anxious symptoms, measured
via separate questionnaires used to screen for those dis-
orders (Chi et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2020), post-traumatic
stress (Guo et al., 2020), lower emotional well-being (Adi-
belli & Sumen, 2020; Commodari & La Rosa, 2020), and
insomnia (Chi et al., 2021). COVID-19-related cognitive
preoccupation, worries, and anxiety were
cross-
sectionally associated with current use of mental health-
related apps (Rauschenberg et al., 2020). In contrast, Qi,
Liu, et al., (2020) observed that adolescents who were
more concerned about COVID-19 experienced fewer
anxious symptoms. The authors speculate that this rela-
tionship may be explained by a positive correlation
between concern and knowledge of COVID-19, a factor
which could protect against more severe fear and anxiety
regarding the pandemic. In line with this hypothesis,
Zhou, Zhang, et al., (2020) observed that those with
more knowledge of the local COVID-19 epidemic and

associated control measures reported fewer anxious
symptoms.

Depressive symptoms
A majority of studies measured depressive symptoms as
a mental health outcome. Of these, twenty-ﬁve articles
identiﬁed a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in
children and adolescents during the pandemic com-
pared to the prepandemic period (Abdulah et al., 2020;
Breaux et al., 2021; Chen, Chen, et al., 2020; Crescen-
tini et al., 2020; Duan et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2020;
Giannopoulou et al., 2021; Glynn et al., 2021; Gotlib
et al., 2020; Janssen et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021; Lu
et al., 2020; Magson et al., 2021; Matovu et al., 2021;
Oosterhoff et al., 2020; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Rogers
et al., 2021; Sama et al., 2021; Scott et al., 2021; Secer &
Ulas, 2020; Xie et al., 2020; Zhang, Ye, et al., 2020;
Zhang, Zhang, et al., 2020; Zhou, Yuan, et al., 2020;
Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2020). In contrast, a small minority
of studies detected a decrease in depressive symptoms
(Ezpeleta et al., 2020; Tso et al., 2020; Xiang, Zhang, &
Kuwahara, 2020). Ezpeleta et al., (2020) suggested that
differences between parent and child self-report may
have accounted for the decrease they observed among
adolescents in Barcelona. On the other hand, Xiang,
Zhang, et al., (2020) proposed that high ownership of
digital devices, rapid implementation of remote learning,
and a reduction in stresses experienced by some stu-
dents at school may explain the decline in depressive
symptoms they noted in a sample of 6- to 17-year-old
students in Shanghai. Studies conducted at the height
of the epidemic in China (January–May 2020) reported
depression prevalence estimates ranging from 11% to
45% (Duan et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Murata et al.,
2021; Sama et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2020; Zhou, Zhang,
et al., 2020), with one study of adolescents after
extended lockdown reporting a prevalence of 64% (Zhou,
Zhang, et al., 2020), compared with prepandemic esti-
mates in similar populations ranging from 13% to 17%
(Stewart & Sun, 2007; Xu et al., 2020).

Anxiety symptoms
The majority of studies measured anxiety symptoms in
young people; among these, 17 found increased levels
of anxiety symptoms in comparison with prepandemic
estimates (Amorim et al., 2020; Asbury et al., 2020;
Breaux et al., 2021; Chen, Chen, et al., 2020; Conti
et al., 2020; Duan et al., 2020; Giannopoulou et al.,
2021; Lee et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2020; Magson et al.,
2021; Meherali et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021;
Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2021; Sama
et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2020; Zhang, Ye, et al., 2020;
Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2020). No studies reported a
decrease in anxiety symptoms; however, Zhang, Zhang,
et al., 2020 reported no change in anxiety symptoms
among middle and junior high school students in a lon-
gitudinal cohort comparing prepandemic (November
2020) and subsequent to school reopening (May 2020)
surveys. Prevalence of anxiety in cross-sectional stud-
ies ranged from a low of 8% (China) (Yue et al., 2020) to
as high as 74% (Egypt) (Alamrawy et al., 2021). Studies
with lower estimates of anxiety (8%–25%) tended to
only include younger children and adolescent popula-
tions (<12 years) (de Avila et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020;
Xue et al., 2021; Yue et al., 2020) and/or take place

Child Adolesc Ment Health 2022; 27(2): 173–89

approximately more than six weeks after the initial
enactment of regional lockdown measures (Cao et al.,
2021; Shitao Chen, Cheng, & Wu, 2020; Li et al., 2021;
Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2021; Tang, Xiang, Cheung, &
Xiang, 2021; Zhang, Ye, et al., 2020; Zhang, Zhang,
et al., 2020). Mid-to-high estimates of anxiety (34%–
74%) were more frequently observed in studies con-
ducted within six weeks of the initial lockdown restric-
tions in the region (Giannopoulou et al., 2021; Qi,
Zhou, et al., 2020; Yeasmin et al., 2020; Zhou, Wang,
et al., 2020; Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2020) and/or in stud-
ies that focused on older adolescents (>15 years) (Chi
et al., 2021; Giannopoulou et al., 2021; Lu et al.,
2020), as well as during periods of high local COVID-19
case counts (Alamrawy et al., 2021).

General mental health
Eight cross-sectional studies assessed changes in chil-
dren and adolescents’ overall mental health related to
the COVID-19 pandemic (Amran, 2020; Cusinato et al.,
2020; Gadermann et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020; Pons
et al., 2020; Scott et al., 2021; Theis et al., 2021;
Vallejo-Slocker, Fresneda, & Vallejo, 2020). Four arti-
cles noted that a majority of included children retro-
spectively reported that they had worse overall mental
health than before the pandemic (Amran, 2020; Pons
et al., 2020; Theis et al., 2021; Vallejo-Slocker et al.,
2020), while participants in two studies described no or
positive changes among most participants (Cusinato
et al., 2020; Gadermann et al., 2021; Patra et al.,
2020).

Self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide
Prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide, and nonsuicidal
self-injury (NSSI) during the COVID-19 pandemic was
reported in eight articles (Banati et al., 2020; Ellis et al.,
2020; Jefsen et al., 2020; Matovu et al., 2021; Murata
et al., 2021; Tanaka & Okamoto, 2021; Theis et al.,
2021; Zhang, Zhang, et al., 2020). Three studies exam-
ined the prevalence of NSSI during the pandemic (Jefsen
et al., 2020; Theis et al., 2021; Zhang, Zhang, et al.,
2020), with Zhang, Zhang, et al. (2020) observing a sta-
tistically signiﬁcant increase in NSSI from 32% to 42%
after the enactment of school closures in a cohort of Chi-
nese students.

Six studies reported occurrence of pandemic-related
suicidal ideation in children and adolescents (Banati
et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Jefsen et al., 2020; Matovu
et al., 2021; Murata et al., 2021; Zhang, Zhang, et al.,
2020). Of the six studies, three reported increased esti-
mates of suicidal ideation in comparison to prepandemic
estimates (Ellis et al., 2020; Murata et al., 2021; Zhang,
Zhang, et al., 2020). For example, in Canada, 18% of
adolescents surveyed from April 4–6, 2020, reported
having thoughts of ending their life, a notable increase
from 2017 reports of 6% (Ellis et al., 2020). Similarly in
the United States, rates of suicidal ideation in adoles-
cents rose from 17% in 2017 to 37% during the pan-
demic (Murata et al., 2021). An increase in suicidal
ideation among Chinese adolescents from 23% to 30%
(Zhang, Zhang, et al., 2020) was also reported. Lastly,
monthly suicide rates in Japan increased by 49% among
children and adolescents during the second wave of the
pandemic (July–October 2020)
(Tanaka & Okamoto,
2021).

Mental health service utilization
Eight studies measured longitudinal changes during the
COVID-19 pandemic in child and adolescent utilization
of mental health services (Bothara et al., 2021; Cheek
et al., 2020; Chen, She, et al., 2020; Diaz de Neira et al.,
2020; Ferrando et al., 2020; Leeb et al., 2020; Leff et al.,
2021; Tromans et al., 2020). Of the studies analyzing
emergency department (ED) data, two studies noted an
increase in pediatric mental health-related presenta-
tions (Cheek et al., 2020; Leeb et al., 2020) and four
studies observed a decrease (Bothara et al., 2021; Diaz
de Neira et al., 2020; Ferrando et al., 2020; Leff et al.,
2021). Self-injurious behaviors were the most predomi-
nant reasons for consultation at an ER in Spain (Diaz de
Neira et al., 2020), and rates of pediatric self-injurious
behavior were found to increase at a tertiary ED during a
lockdown period in New Zealand (Bothara et al., 2021).

In two studies in the United Kingdom, child and ado-
lescent secondary referral rates to mental health services
remained the same (Chen et al., 2020) or declined (Tro-
mans et al., 2020). Diaz de Neira et al., (2020) found that
hospitalization rates related to child and adolescent
mental health diagnoses rose, but average length-of-stay
fell compared to 2019 in an ED located in Madrid, Spain.
Additionally, Ferrando et al., (2020) reported that pedi-
atric ED presentations with substance use, mania, and
psychosis had increased, and that presentations with
suicide attempts, aggression/agitation, and among
those with a previous psychiatric history had decreased.

Other mental health outcomes
Studies included in this review investigated additional
outcomes related to mental health such as conduct
problems and prosocial behaviors (Alonso-Mart(cid:1)ınez
et al., 2021; Cusinato et al., 2020; Ezpeleta et al., 2020;
Gassman-Pines et al., 2020; Luthar et al., 2020; Mallik
& Radwan, 2021; Nonweiler et al., 2020; Romero et al.,
2020; Spinelli, Lionetti, Pastore, & Fasolo, 2020; Tso
et al., 2020; Wiguna et al., 2020), attention deﬁcits and
hyperactivity (Cusinato et al., 2020; Mallik & Radwan,
2021; Nonweiler et al., 2020; Ravens-Sieberer et al.,
2021; Spinelli, Lionetti, Pastore, et al., 2020; Tso et al.,
2020; Wiguna et al., 2020; Zhang, Shuai, et al., 2020),
loneliness (Abdulah et al., 2020; Esposito et al., 2020;
Rogers et al., 2021; Sciberras et al., 2020), anger (Patra
et al., 2020; Sama et al., 2021), positive and negative
affect (Janssen et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2021), grief
(Murata et al., 2021), somatic symptoms (Crescentini
et al., 2020), eating problems (Alamrawy et al., 2021),
and substance use (Dumas et al., 2020).

Demographic factors affecting child and
adolescent mental health outcomes

Age
Overall, older children and adolescents exhibited more
depressive symptoms (Ademhan Tural et al., 2020; Fitz-
patrick et al., 2020; Ren, He, Bian, Shang, & Liu, 2021;
Tang et al., 2021) and higher levels of stress, worry, con-
cern, and fear related to COVID-19 (Buzzi et al., 2020;
Commodari & La Rosa, 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Liebana-
Presa et al., 2020; Matovu et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2021;
Xie et al., 2020) than younger children. In contrast,
Xiang, Zhang, et al., (2020) longitudinally observed both

that all student participants experienced a decline in
depressive symptoms from January to March 2020 and
that middle school students experienced a more pro-
nounced decrease than primary school students. The
authors hypothesized that older students may have
experienced a stronger drop in depressive symptoms
due to postponement of middle school examinations.
Romero et al., (2020) found that 3- to 6-year-old children
experienced more hyperactivity and conduct problems
related to COVID-19 than 7- to 12-year-old children.
Additionally, Tso et al., (2020) observed that 6- to 12-
year-old children experienced a stronger correlation
between more screen time during the COVID-19 pan-
demic and worse mental and emotional well-being than
2- to 5-year-old children.

Gender
In most studies, girls reported higher levels of worry,
concern, and fear regarding COVID-19 (Buzzi et al.,
2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Gotlib et al., 2020; Liebana-
Presa et al., 2020; Magson et al., 2021; Matovu et al.,
2021; Xie et al., 2020), as well as more notable declines
in general mental health during the pandemic based on
retrospective self-report (Gotlib et al., 2020; Pons et al.,
2020) compared with boys. Only one study found that
girls experienced lower deterioration in general mental
health compared to boys (Mallik & Radwan, 2021). How-
ever, girls exhibited equivalent changes in depressive
symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic compared
with boys (Ren et al., 2021; Xiang, Zhang, et al., 2020).
Additionally, Scott et al., (2021) observed that gender
diverse students described more mental health chal-
lenges related to the pandemic than either girls or boys.

Contextual- and population-level factors
affecting child and adolescent mental health
outcomes

Pandemic control measures
The effect of public health pandemic control guidelines
on child and adolescent mental health was examined by
numerous articles. Contact-restriction procedures such
as physical and social distancing were the most fre-
quently reported control measures. Many studies
reported the occurrence of negative emotions or mental
health deterioration due to COVID-19 pandemic control
measures (Abdulah et al., 2020; Adibelli & Sumen,
2020; Alshahrani et al., 2020; Amran, 2020; Cacioppo
et al., 2020; Esposito et al., 2020; Evans et al., 2020;
Fitzpatrick et al., 2020; Gadermann et al., 2021; Gian-
nopoulou et al., 2021; Glynn et al., 2021; Gotlib et al.,
2020; Idoiaga et al., 2020; Magson et al., 2021; Mallik &
Radwan, 2021; Masi et al., 2021; Munasinghe et al.,
2020; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Ravens-Sieberer et al.,
2020, 2021; Ren et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2021; Sama
et al., 2021; Saurabh & Ranjan, 2020; Sciberras et al.,
2020; Scott et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021; Theis
et al., 2021; Mi Xiang, Zhang, et al., 2020; Yeasmin
et al., 2020; Zorcec et al., 2020). For instance, 71% of
surveyed German youth reported feeling burdened by
measures reducing social contact during the pandemic
(Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally, children and
adolescents were unhappy about lower levels of
in-
person interaction resulting in a sense that their rela-
tionships with others were deteriorating (Alshahrani

et al., 2020; Amran, 2020; Cacioppo et al., 2020; Espos-
ito et al., 2020; Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2021; Rogers
et al., 2021; Scott et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021), cance-
lation of in-person activities and events (Abdulah et al.,
2020; Esposito et al., 2020; Evans et al., 2020; O’Sulli-
van et al., 2021; Scott et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021),
not enough time outside (Idoiaga et al., 2020; Rogers
et al., 2021), and too much family time (Rogers et al.,
2021; Yeasmin et al., 2020). However, more lenient
COVID-19 pandemic control policies were also found to
be cross-sectionally associated with greater internaliz-
ing and externalizing problems in children and adoles-
cents (Fitzpatrick et al., 2020). Additionally, compliance
with public health guidelines and beliefs that restric-
tions were appropriate were cross-sectionally correlated
with a greater number of positive feelings since the pan-
demic began in one study (Commodari & La Rosa,
2020).

Some young people or their parents reported that, as a
result of stay-at-home orders and increased time at
home, children were found to ﬁght more frequently with
their siblings (Amran, 2020; Evans et al., 2020; Zorcec
et al., 2020), to have more conﬂicts with parents (Amran,
2020; Evans et al., 2020; Gadermann et al., 2021;
Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2020, 2021; Zorcec et al., 2020),
and to lack a daily routine (O’Sullivan et al., 2021). How-
ever, participants in some studies also noted positive
effects of the lockdown measures for young people such
as increased family time (Gadermann et al., 2021;
Sciberras et al., 2020) and more time to relax (Sciberras
et al., 2020). Families and individuals that employed
daily routines during lockdown were found to experience
fewer adverse mental health outcomes (Glynn et al.,
2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2021).

Changes to school systems to facilitate physical dis-
tancing, such as the transition to online schooling dur-
ing the early stages of
the pandemic, were most
commonly noted to contribute to an increasingly stress-
ful environment for many children and adolescents (Shi-
tao Chen, et al., 2020; Giannopoulou et al., 2021;
Magson et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Ravens-
Sieberer et al., 2020, 2021; Rogers et al., 2021; J. Zhou,
Yuan, et al., 2020). In one study, 65% of German middle
and high school students found school and learning to
be more exhausting during the pandemic (Ravens-
Sieberer et al., 2020). However, several studies noted
that some students had experienced improved mental
health because school closures had alleviated usual
school stress (Patra et al., 2020; Sciberras et al., 2020;
Xiang, Zhang, et al., 2020).

Social connection
Multiple studies reported social isolation due to COVID-
19 restrictions to be negatively associated with child and
adolescent mental health outcomes. Many children felt
they were missing out on usual daily activities and had
lost relationships with peers, leading to increased anger,
worry, helplessness, annoyance, post-traumatic stress
symptoms, grief, depression, and loneliness (Abdulah
et al., 2020; Cacioppo et al., 2020; Evans et al., 2020;
Fish et al., 2020; Janssen et al., 2020; Murata et al.,
2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Ravens-Sieberer et al.,
2020; Rogers et al., 2021; Saurabh & Ranjan, 2020;
Scott et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021), as well as lower
levels of happiness and positive emotions (Munasinghe

et al., 2020). Similarly, one study found evidence of a
cross-sectional dose–response relationship between
increased

and

psychological

isolation

Many children found online learning to be difﬁcult
interaction with teachers, school-
due to a lack of
mates, and friends (Esposito et al., 2020; Evans et al.,
2020; Fontenelle-Tereshchuk, 2020; Ravens-Sieberer
et al., 2020). Esposito et al.,
(2020) observed that
younger children (aged 11-13) had greater negative
mental health outcomes due to this change in routine
and supports compared to older children (aged 14–19).
Oosterhoff et al., (2020) additionally noted that those
who were practicing physical distancing to avoid judg-
ment or falling ill reported greater anxiety symptoms
and those who practiced distancing because of
friends’ recommendations reported greater depressive
symptoms.

In contrast, Esposito et al., (2020) noted that 25% of
girl and 19% of boy adolescents surveyed stated that
their relationships had improved throughout the pan-
demic. Moreover, some adolescents said they were able
to rebuild their social habits and maintain contact with
friends
communication
despite physically isolating at home (Buzzi et al., 2020;
Janssen et al., 2020).

through increased online

Family relationships
Family impacts related to the pandemic were frequently
associated with mental health changes among young
people during the pandemic. Children of parents who
reported poorer current mental health or declining men-
tal health in response to the pandemic exhibited more
negative COVID-19-related mental health changes in
four cross-sectional studies (Ademhan Tural et al.,
2020; Evans et al., 2020; Romero et al., 2020; Spinelli,
Lionetti, Pastore, et al., 2020). Similarly, higher parental
worry about the threat posed by COVID-19 and its
impact on their families was negatively correlated with
child and adolescent mental health in three cross-
sectional studies (Spinelli, Lionetti, Setti, et al., 2020;
Spinelli, Lionetti, Pastore, et al., 2020; Waller et al.,
2021). Spinelli, Lionetti, Setti, et al., 2020 noted that
parents who described more parenting difﬁculties dur-
ing the pandemic noted higher emotional negativity and
more problems with emotional regulation among their
children. In addition, Ademhan Tural et al., (2020) found
that parents who placed greater pressure on their chil-
dren to protect themselves from COVID-19 reported that
their children had experienced a larger increase in
depressive and anxious symptoms.

Additionally, family relationships emerged as a poten-
tial modiﬁer of child and adolescent mental health
changes during the pandemic. In several cases, parents
and children reported that the pandemic had encour-
aged higher levels of family intimacy (Evans et al., 2020;
Gadermann et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020; Rogers et al.,
2021; Xiang, Zhang, et al., 2020). Guo et al., (2020)
found evidence that an interaction between adverse
childhood experiences—including family abuse, neglect,
and household dysfunction—and COVID-19 exposure
was cross-sectionally associated with higher self-
reported post-traumatic stress symptoms. Meanwhile,
Shek et al., (2021) observed that stronger parent–child
relationships before the pandemic was longitudinally

associated with fewer post-traumatic stress symptoms
related to COVID-19.

Technology use and media consumption
Recreational technology use such as checking social
media, smartphone and Internet use, watching TV, and
gaming during physical distancing and lockdown mea-
sures was reported in a large proportion of articles (Adi-
belli & Sumen, 2020; Amran, 2020; Chen, Chen, et al.,
2020; Commodari & La Rosa, 2020; Duan et al., 2020;
Evans et al., 2020; Fish et al., 2020; Fontenelle-
Tereshchuk, 2020; Janssen et al., 2020; Jiao et al.,
2020; Kılınc(cid:1)el et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Magson et al.,
2021; Masi et al., 2021; Munasinghe et al., 2020; Murata
et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020;
Ren et al., 2021; Sciberras et al., 2020; Shah et al.,
2021; Tso et al., 2020), with one study reporting a dou-
bling of time spent on smartphones and social media
platforms during the pandemic (Chen, Chen, et al.,
2020). Greater youth Internet, social media, gaming,
and smartphone use exhibited signiﬁcant positive cross-
sectional correlations with anxiety (Duan et al., 2020; Li
et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021)
and depression (Li et al., 2021; Murata et al., 2021; Ren
et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021) scores, as well as overall
mental and psychological problems (Adibelli & Sumen,
2020; Magson et al., 2021; Murata et al., 2021; Sciber-
ras et al., 2020) This negative correlation between tech-
nology use and mental health outcomes was found to be
especially pronounced in younger age groups, even if
usage was for learning purposes (Tso et al., 2020).

A study in China reported children at higher risk of
anxiety and PTSD spent much more time on COVID-19
related media reports (Yue et al., 2020). Similarly, chil-
dren and adolescents who consumed COVID-19 news
and used social media the most during the pandemic
experienced the highest levels of depression and stress
(Ellis et al., 2020; Kılınc(cid:1)el et al., 2020; Yue et al., 2020).
Conversely, use of social media to stay connected with
friends and relatives was hypothesized to act as a buffer
for feelings of loneliness, and may have even bolstered
mental well-being during the pandemic (Janssen et al.,
2020). Notably, LGBTQ-identifying adolescents high-
lighted the importance of online text-based platforms to
allow for continued connection with peers and support-
ive individuals (i.e., staff from LGBTQ organizations,
‘chosen family’), without fear of parents overhearing
their conversations (Fish et al., 2020).

Neurodiverse children and adolescents
Nineteen studies described the experience of neurodi-
verse children and adolescents during the COVID-19
pandemic (Amorim et al., 2020; Asbury et al., 2020;
Breaux et al., 2021; Colizzi et al., 2020; Conte et al.,

(ADD/ADHD) (Asbury et al., 2020; Breaux et al., 2021;
Jefsen et al., 2020; Masi et al., 2021; Nonweiler et al.,
2020; Sciberras et al., 2020; Zhang, Shuai, et al., 2020),
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
(Jefsen et al.,
2020; Masi et al., 2021; Secer & Ulas, 2020; Storch
et al., 2021), Tourette syndrome (Conte et al., 2020;
Graziola et al., 2020; Masi et al., 2021), and other neuro-
diverse conditions (Conti et al., 2020; Evans et al., 2020;
Masi et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020; Paulauskaite et al.,
2021; Theis et al., 2021).

Neurodiverse populations reported more severe emo-
tional and anxious symptoms during the pandemic com-
pared with non-neurodiverse populations in both
surveys (Amorim et al., 2020; Nonweiler et al., 2020) and
qualitative data (O’Sullivan et al., 2021). In particular,
increases in anxiety (Amorim et al., 2020; Asbury et al.,
2020; Breaux et al., 2021; Conti et al., 2020; O’Sullivan
et al., 2021; Sciberras et al., 2020; Secer & Ulas, 2020)
and worsening symptoms (Asbury et al., 2020; Breaux
et al., 2021; Colizzi et al., 2020; Conte et al., 2020; Conti
et al., 2020; Graziola et al., 2020; Jefsen et al., 2020;
Masi et al., 2021; Secer & Ulas, 2020; Zhang, Shuai,
et al., 2020) were frequently observed across neurodevel-
opmental conditions. Participants in several studies
cited disruptions to daily routines such as lack of access
to schools, routine health care, and other specialized
facilities as a contributing factor to the observed behav-
ioral, emotional, and mental health changes (Amorim
et al., 2020; Asbury et al., 2020; Conte et al., 2020; Masi
et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Sciberras et al.,
2020; Theis et al., 2021).

Chronic physical conditions
Five studies presented results on children and adoles-
cents with chronic physical health conditions including
chronic respiratory conditions (Ademhan Tural et al.,
2020; Zorcec et al., 2020), cancer (Alshahrani et al.,
2020), inﬂammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) (Martinelli,
Strisciuglio, Fedele, Miele, & Staiano, 2020), and other
physical disabilities (Cacioppo et al., 2020). The majority
of studies found a marked decrease in mental health
during the pandemic (Ademhan Tural et al., 2020;
Alshahrani et al., 2020; Cacioppo et al., 2020; Zorcec
et al., 2020). In particular, children and adolescents with
chronic respiratory diseases reported greater mental
health deterioration than those without respiratory dis-
ease (Ademhan Tural et al., 2020), and children and ado-
lescents with cancer were more likely to experience
anxiety surrounding COVID-19 infection than general
population estimates (Alshahrani et al., 2020).

Additional resilience and protective factors
Notably, coping methods were reported by children and
adolescents, including activities such as engaging in
hobbies (Banati et al., 2020; Commodari & La Rosa,
2020; Li et al., 2021; O’Sullivan et al., 2021; Shah et al.,
2021), listening to music (Janssen et al., 2020; Shah
et al., 2021), praying (Alamrawy et al., 2021), and main-
taining a routine (O’Sullivan et al., 2021). In particular,
higher levels of physical activity (Alonso-Mart(cid:1)ınez et al.,
2021; Banati et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2021; Ellis et al.,
2020; Jiao et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021;

et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2021; Sciberras et al., 2020; Shah
et al., 2021; Zhou, Yuan, et al., 2020) and time playing

outside (Banati et al., 2020; Gadermann et al., 2021;
Patra et al., 2020) were commonly correlated cross-
sectionally with better mental health outcomes. Increas-
ing knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 prevention
and control measures were also cross-sectionally associ-
ated with reduced anxiety and depression, and overall
better mental health (Alamrawy et al., 2021; Asbury
et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2021; Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2020).
Children and adolescents who looked to the future opti-
mistically and conﬁdently were also found to have a
life (Ravens-Sieberer
higher health-related quality of
et al., 2020) associated with fewer depressive symptoms
(Xie et al., 2020).

Discussion
This review identiﬁed studies describing mental health
of children and adolescents during the ﬁrst year of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional design was used
in 76% of the studies and almost a third focused on
speciﬁc subgroups rather than general population sam-
ples. The greatest number of studies were undertaken in
Europe, followed by East Asia and North America, which
may reﬂect the geography of the pandemic’s earliest
studied impacts. Notably, fewer than 15% of all available
studies used validated instruments, which can lead to
challenges in interpreting the clinical relevance of men-
tal health impacts and differentiation of adaptive symp-
toms and mental illness.

Most studies observed increases in the number of
depressive and anxious symptoms reported by partici-
pants, as well as a worsening trend in general mental
health, since before the pandemic. In general, govern-
ment pandemic control policies that limited social inter-
actions were associated with more depressive and
anxious symptoms (Chen, Chen, et al., 2020; Duan
et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Gotlib et al., 2020; Jiao
et al., 2020; Oosterhoff et al., 2020; Secer & Ulas, 2020;
Xie et al., 2020; Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2020). These symp-
toms were more common among older children and ado-
lescents and girls, which parallels prepandemic
distributions (Chen, Chen, et al., 2020; Gotlib et al.,
2020; Jiao et al., 2020; Leff et al., 2021; McElroy
et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Spinelli, Lionetti, Setti,
et al., 2020; Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2020). Neurodiverse
children and adolescents and those with pre-existing
mental illness have also experienced higher levels of psy-
chological distress, depression, anxiety, and behavior
problems since the start of the pandemic (Asbury et al.,
2020; Breaux et al., 2021; Colizzi et al., 2020; O’Sullivan
et al., 2021; Secer & Ulas, 2020; Zhang, Zhang, et al.,
2020); similarly, those with chronic physical health con-
ditions including chronic respiratory conditions (Adem-
han Tural et al., 2020; Zorcec et al., 2020), cancer
(Alshahrani et al., 2020) also experienced greater nega-
tive mental health impacts than those without those
conditions. Preliminary ﬁndings suggest an increased
prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide, and nonsuicidal
self-injury among children and adolescents during the
pandemic (Ellis et al., 2020; Murata et al., 2021; Zhang,
Zhang, et al., 2020). However, these ﬁndings should be
interpreted with caution as it is important to consider
the timing and context of studies (e.g., undertaken dur-
ing lockdown vs. return to school setting) that can
inform trends for these outcomes and others.

Factors associated with anxiety ranged from fear of
oneself or loved ones contracting COVID-19, to concern
about the economic and social repercussions of the pan-
demic (McElroy et al., 2020). A rise in anxiety symptoms
was frequently matched to an increase in depressive
symptoms, consistent with previous research on comor-
bid patterns of anxiety and depression (Hirschﬁeld,
2001; Lamers et al., 2011). Furthermore, estimates of
anxiety prevalence were higher in the periods shortly
after enactment of regional lockdown measures (Cao
et al., 2021; Chen, Cheng, et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021;
Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2021; Zhang,
Ye, et al., 2020; Zhang, Zhang, et al., 2020) than in esti-
mates taken several months after (Giannopoulou et al.,
2021; Qi et al., 2020; Yeasmin et al., 2020; Zhou, Wang,
et al., 2020; Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2020) and may indicate
gradual acclimation to lockdown restrictions by children
and adolescents. Additionally, children and adolescents
reported high rates of COVID-19-related fear, concern,
and stress, suggesting that a preoccupation with the
threat posed by COVID-19 may markedly impact young
people’s mental well-being (Buzzi et al., 2020; Ellis et al.,
2020; Jiao et al., 2020; Masuyama et al., 2020; Saurabh
& Ranjan, 2020; Xie et al., 2020).

Emerging evidence provides rationale for increased
mental health concerns for children and adolescents
during the pandemic. School closures and physical dis-
tancing may result in increased loneliness, which a
review of 63 studies found was correlated with anxiety
and depression (Loades et al., 2020). With increased
time at home during lockdown, some children are
exposed to spillover effects from stressful home environ-
ments, including family violence and parental substance
use disorders, as adult family members experience
adverse economic impacts, increased stress, reduced
access to respite, and mental health concerns them-
selves (Ademhan Tural et al., 2020; Brown, Doom,
Lechuga-Pena, Watamura, & Koppels, 2020; Ciofﬁ &
Leve, 2020; Evans et al., 2020; Romero et al., 2020;
Maria Spinelli, Lionetti, Pastore, et al., 2020). Pandemic
control measures such as restrictions on recreational
spaces and activities may also limit options for physical
activity, time spent outside the home, and respite care
(Phillips et al., 2020; Tison et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020). Lastly, excess Internet and social media use has
been correlated with mental distress for children and
adolescents (Chen, Chen, et al., 2020; Moore et al.,
2020; Pietrobelli et al., 2020; Mi Xiang, Zhang, et al.,
2020). These stressors add to concerns about the risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and an uncertain future.

Despite the likely need for greater mental support dur-
ing lockdown, restriction measures may discourage and
decrease support-seeking behaviors. In all six studies
examining ED data, decreases in emergency mental
health presentations were observed immediately after
enforcement of national
lockdown measures in four
countries (Bothara et al., 2021; Cheek et al., 2020; Diaz
de Neira et al., 2020; Ferrando et al., 2020; Leeb et al.,
2020; Leff et al., 2021). Similar decreases in total ED
presentations during lockdown periods have been
observed in other populations (Hartnett et al., 2020; Jef-
fery et al., 2020), likely reﬂecting strong public adher-
ence to national and international-level risk messaging
to avoid public spaces and other high-transmission
areas (Jeffery et al., 2020; Rosenbaum, 2020). However,

delay of appropriate support and treatment for mental
health concerns, particularly in the earlier stages of life,
often exacerbates frequency and severity of mental
health symptoms, ultimately resulting in poorer health
outcomes and greater need for treatment later on (Kisely,
Scott, Denney, & Simon, 2006; Malla et al., 2018;
McGorry, Purcell, Goldstone, & Amminger, 2011).
Indeed, pediatric mental health presentations to the ED
steadily increased in the months following the initial
lockdown period, surpassing prepandemic rates by
October 2020 (Leeb et al., 2020), and suggests pro-
longed duration of lockdown procedures may result in
continuous mental health deterioration for children and
adolescents.

Notably, greater consumption of COVID-19-related
news coverage during the pandemic was positively corre-
lated with depressive and anxiety symptoms (Duan
et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Zhou, Wang, et al., 2020).
Conversely, children and adolescents who felt better
informed about the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
control measures were associated with fewer symptoms
of depression and anxiety during the pandemic’s early
stages (Masuyama et al., 2020; Qi, Liu, et al., 2020;
Zhou, Zhang, et al., 2020). This ﬁnding highlights that
while traditional and social media may offer effective
ways to share up-to-date news and communicate public
health messaging, prolonged exposure may be detrimen-
tal for child and adolescent mental health.

Fostering positive mental well-being may have
important impacts in promoting resilience and prevent-
ing poor mental health outcomes (Keyes, 2002). Physi-
cal exercise, access to entertainment, positive familial
relationships, and social support were associated with
better mental health outcomes in several studies (Buzzi
et al., 2020; Duan et al., 2020; Gadermann et al.,
2021; Jiao et al., 2020), suggesting they may con-
tribute to mental health resilience during the pan-
demic. Notably, protective health behaviors for children
and adolescents which have declined during the pan-
demic (Moore et al., 2020; Pietrobelli et al., 2020; Mi
Xiang, Zhang, et al., 2020)—such as sufﬁcient move-
ment, routines, sleep, and nutrition—are favorably
associated with social and emotional health for chil-
dren and adolescents (Rollo, Antsygina, & Tremblay,
2020) and may be important targets for intervention.
In particular, social support was associated with signif-
icantly fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and
insomnia. Social connectedness is an important deter-
minant of child and adolescent mental well-being
(Jose, Ryan, & Pryor, 2012; Shochet, Dadds, Ham, &
Montague, 2006). Children and adolescents need
access to meaningful social support in the absence of
usual opportunities for face-to-face interaction. Virtual
resources connecting isolated peers and phased school
restarts with controlled opportunities for in-person
contact could mitigate effects of prolonged social
isolation.

Directions for future research
Few studies have explored personal and contextual fac-
tors which may contribute to young people’s mental resi-
lience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the
impact of socioeconomic disadvantage and race, key
social determinants of mental health, did not emerge as
key themes in our review due to a dearth of papers

addressing these subjects, both have been associated
with poor mental health outcomes related to social
marginalization (Priest et al., 2013; Reiss, 2013) and are
important areas for future work. A better understanding
of these factors, as well as parental mental health and
reporting of dual perspectives (child self-report and par-
ent report on child) which may diverge, would be illustra-
tive. Better insight would enable universal, selective,
and indicated prevention and treatment strategies to
buffer children and adolescents against negative mental
health outcomes not only in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, but also during future crises. Given the per-
vasiveness of economic impacts due to the pandemic
globally, a focus on universal prevention interventions
for children and adolescents that targets social determi-
nants of health (e.g., food security, secure and safe hous-
ing, access to education) is warranted (Purgato et al.,
2020).

Research studies with longitudinal designs and with
deﬁned comparison groups are needed to investigate
possible risk and protective factors, as well as other
long-term mental health impacts on child and adoles-
cent mental health. The current evidence base consists
primarily of cross-sectional data; additional longitudinal
ﬁndings will allow improved evaluation of causal rela-
tionships between pandemic pressures and mental
health outcomes, as well as identify which groups con-
tinue to need mental health care and treatment or would
beneﬁt from prevention measures as pandemic condi-
tions and associated control measures ease. Addition-
ally, longitudinal data allow measurement of prolonged
exposure to the threat of infection and concurrent efforts
to contain the pandemic that may create ‘allostatic load’,
accumulated physiological wear and tear resulting from
repeated stress responses (Evans, Li, & Whipple, 2013).
Similarly, ‘sleeper effects’, mental health ramiﬁcations
that manifest after a speciﬁc developmental period of
neurobiological maturation, may only become apparent
after a period of time (Wade, Prime, & Browne, 2020). To
investigate these potential long-term and dose–response
relationships and identify subpopulations at increased
risk now and in future, research with ongoing follow-up
to assess mental health of children and adolescents dur-
ing and after the pandemic is needed.

Standardized measurement tools and repositories of
COVID-19-related research would facilitate comparison
of the evidence on COVID-19’s mental health impact.
The studies reviewed in this paper did not employ con-
sistent measurement tools to evaluate depression, anxi-
ety, and other mental health outcomes. Methodological
heterogeneity across studies precludes comparison to
detect potential geographic and cultural inﬂuences. In
order to enhance comparability of results, researchers
should consider using one of the well-validated instru-
ments which have recently emerged to measure COVID-
19’s mental health impacts, such as the Coronavirus
Anxiety Scale (S. A. Lee, 2020), CoRonavIruS Health and
Impact Survey (CRISIS) (Nikolaidis et al., 2020), or the
Fear of COVID-19 Scale (Ahorsu et al., 2020). Addition-
ally, growth of databases such as COVID-MINDS (Home,
2020) which aim to collate longitudinal mental health
research related to COVID-19 will coordinate efforts to
assess the global impact of the pandemic and potentially
future crises.

Limitations
Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic,
this review primarily captures studies undertaken dur-
ing the ﬁrst pandemic ‘waves’, without the ability to cap-
ture population-level mental recovery as the pandemic
wanes in certain settings. Many studies were cross-
sectional in design and undertaken during disparate
pandemic conditions that could impact population men-
tal health (e.g., full lockdowns vs. settings of minimal
studies which
restrictions). Additionally,
included individuals >18 years of age failed to separately
report results for their child and adolescent samples,
limiting efforts to disentangle adult mental health
impacts from those on children and adolescents. Thus,
the evidence concerning the COVID-19 pandemic’s
effects on child and adolescent mental health is relatively
nascent. Moreover, heterogeneity of populations, pan-
demic conditions, mental health outcomes, and the tools
used to assess impact in included studies precluded
quantitative meta-analysis.

several

Conclusion

Mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
children and adolescents are signiﬁcant and should be
of tremendous concern to policymakers and practition-
ers globally. As the pandemic continues,
innovative
approaches that increase access to mental health ser-
vices, as well as promote resilience and mental well-
being such as maintaining social connection despite iso-
lation and renewing social ties during the recovery phase
may be explored. Similarly, increasing identiﬁcation and
supports for children, adolescents, and families experi-
encing disproportionate impacts as well as implementa-
tion of preventive measures more broadly may reduce
long-term mental health sequelae in children and ado-
lescents. Lastly, the pandemic may offer opportunities to
identify prepandemic gaps in mental health service pro-
vision, adapt systems, and ‘build it back better’ (Moreno
et al., 2020).
