Abstract
Purpose  This study aimed to explore the perceived changes in sexual behaviour during COVID-19 lockdown, anxiety 
symptoms, and couple relationship of patients with infertility.
Methods  We performed an observational cross-sectional study between 20 November 2020 and 15 January 2021. We used 
stratified analysis of different stress levels and Quality of Marriage Index (QMI) scores to compare the perceived changes 
in sexual behaviour, anxiety symptoms, and couple relationship. The logistic regression model was performed to assess 
factors correlated with couples’ relationship quality during the lockdown. Furthermore, we performed pathway analyses to 
assess whether the changes in sexual behaviour, stress level, or psychological anxiety during the lockdown could predict the 
quality of couple relationship.
Results  A total of 940 patients with infertility were included in this study. When we conducted a stratified analysis of the 
participants, significant differences were found between the changes in their sexual behaviour, stress levels, and couple 
relationship quality. The logistic regression model showed that sex, anxiety symptoms, decreased sexual satisfaction, sexual 
activity frequency, and income levels were closely related to couple relationship quality. Pathway analyses indicated that 
changes in their sexual behaviour, anxiety symptoms, and stress levels could all predict the quality of couple relationship.
Conclusions  The perceived changes in sexual behaviour with different stress levels and couple relationship quality showed 
significant differences. Analysing the related factors that affect the quality of couple relationship, especially in times of 
crisis, is of great significance as this information can contribute to the improvement of treatment for patients with infertility.

Introduction

The  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic 
has brought unprecedented challenges to the world. Cur-
rently, researchers are mainly focussing on health hazards 

associated with COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 treatment, 
and vaccine development [1–3]. Nevertheless, we must not 
ignore the effect of the pandemic on different aspects of 
people’s lives. Many studies have confirmed that COVID-
19 has severely affected people’s mental and psychological

health [4–10]. Sexual activity is an essential part of life [11], 
and sexual health is an important indicator of the quality of 
life, which is a vital aspect of well-being [12–14]. Anxiety, 
lack of privacy, fear of health conditions, and psychoso-
matic symptoms caused by lockdown can affect the qual-
ity of sexual life [15]. Studies based on changes in sexual 
activity due to the lockdowns enforced in different popu-
lations and countries have reported different conclusions. 
One study showed that overall sexual activity, sexual activ-
ity frequency, and risky behaviours declined significantly 
among young populations in China [16]. Some female par-
ticipants in Italy reported a decrease in pleasure, satisfac-
tion, desire, and arousal during lockdown [16]. However, 
a survey conducted among the individuals of three south-
east Asian countries revealed that the frequency of sexual 
activity of couples had increased considerably when com-
pared to the frequency before the lockdown [17]; similar 
results were found among Turkish women [18]. Based on 
the above observations, an investigation into the changes in 
sexual behaviour of patients with infertility during lockdown 
could be meaningful because sexual health issues of couples 
with infertility need to be given increased attention due to 
the societal implications of the condition. However, there 
is currently no research documenting changes in the sexual 
behaviour of couples with infertility during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Infertility is defined as failure to achieve a successful 
pregnancy after 12 months, or more, of regular, unprotected 
sexual intercourse [19]. Infertility is a multidimensional 
stressor, and the treatment itself and the unpredictable treat-
ment outcomes are likely to evoke feelings of psychological 
distress [20]. Indeed, one study found that 56% of patients 
with infertility scored in the clinical range for depression 
and 76% for anxiety [21]. Patients with infertility may be 
more sensitive and vulnerable in the face of stress and crisis 
[22]. Published data indicate that the interruption of fertil-
ity care due to COVID-19 led to psychological distress in 
patients with infertility [22–24]. A recent study indicated 
that 64% of the participants experienced psychological dis-
tress during treatment suspension; feeling helpless following 
the suspension of treatment was also associated with higher 
distress [22]. Based on the psychological symptoms caused 
by lockdown, it is expected that sexual behaviour would also 
be affected [25].

Several studies have verified the correlation between psy-
chological health and couple relationship quality [26–28]. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with poor 
couple relationship quality were more burdened than those 
with good couple relationship quality, and the prevalence of 
depression increased from 13% up to 35% based on couple 
relationship quality [27].

Based  on  the  above  research,  our  specific  hypothe-
ses are that the COVID-19 pandemic may aggravate the 

psychological  anxiety  and  stress  level  of  patients  with 
infertility, resulting in changes in sexual behaviour, thereby 
further affecting the couple relationship quality. However, 
to date, no study on the changes in sexual behaviour and 
the quality of couple relationship of patients with infertil-
ity during the COVID-19 pandemic has been conducted. 
Thus, this study aimed to determine whether the COVID-
19 pandemic has had an impact on the changes in sexual 
behaviour and couple relationship of patients with infertility 
and investigate the related factors that affect couple relation-
ship quality.

Materials and methods

Procedure

This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Centre of 
Reproductive Medicine, Shenyang, China. Patients diag-
nosed with infertility were invited to participate in the study 
when they visited the outpatient clinic of the Reproductive 
Medicine  Centre.  The  research  process  was  as  follows: 
First, the patients provided consent to participate in this 
anonymous research; then, the nurse led the participants to 
a private room of the clinic reserved for filling out question-
naires. All participants provided written informed consent 
prior to starting the study.

Participants

All participants were recruited from the Centre of Reproduc-
tive Medicine and were undergoing infertility treatments. 
Of the 1158 respondents in this study, 218 failed to com-
plete all questions and were excluded. Thus, the responses 
of 940 participants were included in the analyses (response 
rate, 81.17%). Table 1 shows the participants’ demographic 
characteristics. The average age was 32.73 ± 4.55 years for 
female participants and 33.57 ± 4.44 years for male par-
ticipants. The average infertility duration was 4.12 ± 3.06 
years for female participants and 3.70 ± 2.88 years for male 
participants (Table 1).

The  inclusion  criteria  were  as  follows:  female  or 
male diagnosed with infertility or sterility and has not 
yet  undergone  assisted  reproductive  technology  treat-
ment, such as in vitro fertilisation-embryo transfer; aged 
between 21 and 45 years; married and are living with 
their spouses. This study is part of a large-scale cross-
sectional  study  on  the  sexual  health  of  patients  with 
infertility during the COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid the 
bias caused by age and endocrine factors on sexual func-
tion and sexual health, this study only included people 
younger than 45 and excluded some causes of infertility 
that were reported to have affected sexual functions. The

exclusion criteria were as follows: females diagnosed with 
endometriosis and premature ovarian failure; male with 
severe male infertility, such as azoospermia; patients with 
diabetes and high blood pressure; patients with genital 
tract abnormalities and genitourinary infections; ingesting 
drugs that may affect sexual function and/or mental state

pressants, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors) [28]; 
clinically diagnosed sexual dysfunction prior to infertil-
ity diagnosis; and psychiatric conditions (that can cause 
sexual dysfunction).

patients with infertility during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
All questionnaires were validated in the Chinese language.

Demographic information

The following baseline information was collected: age, body 
mass index, economic level, infertility duration, education 
level, and smoking status. An additional question on income 
changes during the COVID-19 pandemic was also included: 
How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected your annual 
income? Answer as increased, unchanged, or decreased.

Perceived changes in sexual behaviour

Measures

We used a self-designed questionnaire and three standard-
ised questionnaires (Supplementary 1 and 2) to evaluate 
the perceived changes in sexual behaviour, stress levels, 
anxiety symptoms, and quality of couple relationship of 

A self-designed questionnaire focused on changes in sexual 
behaviour during the COVID-19 lockdown was adminis-
tered. The following questions were included: (1) Compared 
with that before the COVID-19 pandemic, how has your sex-
ual desire changed? (item 1); (2) Compared with that before 

1 3496

the COVID-19 pandemic, how has your sexual intercourse 
frequency changed? (item 2); (3) Compared with that before 
the COVID-19 pandemic, how has your sexual satisfaction 
changed? (item 3) (The options to answer the above three 
questions were set as increased, unchanged, or decreased.); 
(4) How has your frequency of masturbation changed com-
pared  with  that  before  the  COVID-19  pandemic?  (item 
4); (5) How has your frequency of watching pornography 
changed compared with that before the COVID-19 pan-
demic? (item 5) (The answers to the above two questions 
were set as none, increased, unchanged, or decreased).

Psychological anxiety

Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the 7-item General-
ized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). The items are scored on 
a 4-point scale, from 0 to 3, and the total score ranges from 0 to 
21. The cut-off score of ≥10 was used to assess the presence of 
anxiety [29]. A question on COVID-19-related anxiety was also 
included: Has the COVID-19 pandemic increased/affected your 
anxiety levels? (answer as no, mildly, or extremely).

Stress levels

Stress levels were evaluated using the 14-item Perceived 
Stress Scale (PSS-14) [30]. The items are scored on a 5-point 
scale, from 1 to 5, and the total score ranges from 14 to 70. 
The perceived stress level was based on the PSS-14 score, 
with the severity of stress represented as follows: 14–28, 
low; 29–42, general; 43–56, high; and 57–70, very high. The 
Cronbach alfa values were set between 0.81 and 0.86 [30].

Couple relationship quality

The third part was the Quality of Marriage Index question-
naire, a 6-item scale designed to evaluate couple relationship 
quality. The first five items were scored on a 7-point scale 
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The 
sixth item was scored on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 
(extremely low) to 10 (extremely high). The total score ranged 
from 6 to 45 points. A QMI cut-off value of <34 indicated 
poor quality of relationship, with sensitivity of 88% and speci-
ficity of 85%. The QMI demonstrates good item characteris-
tics and excellent reliability (α = 0.94) [31, 32]. A question 
regarding changes in couple relationship during the COVID-
19 pandemic was also included: Compared with that before 
the COVID-19 pandemic, how has your relationship as a cou-
ple changed? (answer as better, unchanged, or deteriorated).

Statistical analyses

Data analysis was performed using the statistical software 
SPSS (version 22.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and 

the package of Lavaan [33] in R. The chi-square test, inde-
pendent t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and 
logistic regression model were performed using SPSS. The 
principal component analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor 
analysis (CFA), and pathway analyses were performed in 
R. Results were presented in a tabular format. Categorical 
variables were summarised as counts and percentages, and 
continuous measures were summarised as counts, means, 
and standard deviations (SDs).

We used a PCA to test the validation of changes in sexual 
behaviour. Factorability of the polychoric correlation matrix 
was assessed by Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity [34] and KMO 
value ≥0.70 [35]. A CFA was used to validate the struc-
ture of changes in sexual behaviour. To assess model fit, 
Chi-square divided by its degree of freedom (χ2/df), Tucker 
Lewis Index (TLI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Root 
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) were used. 
Model fit was considered adequate according to the follow-
ing criteria: χ2/df ≤3; CFI and TLI ≥0 .90 (preferably ≥0.95); 
RMSEA ≤0.08 [36, 37].

The chi-square test, independent t-test, and ANOVA 
were used to compare the changes in sexual activity, stress 
level, anxiety symptoms, and couple relationship quality 
during the lockdown. Moreover, a stratified analysis was 
performed according to stress levels and QMI score, and 
the differences among the groups were compared. Effect 
size was calculated to evaluate the strength of each sta-
tistical  analysis  and  measured  with  Cohen’s  d  for  the 
independent t-test, Cramer’s V for the chi-squared test, 
and η2 for the ANOVA. A logistic regression model was 
employed to explore the factors that were related to couple 
relationship quality by adjusting for all possible confound-
ers during the lockdown. The p-value, odds ratio (OR), 
and 95% confidence interval (CI) were evaluated, and a 
two-tailed p-value of <0.05 indicated statistical signifi-
cance. We performed pathway analyses to assess whether 
the  changes  in  sexual  behaviour  during  the  lockdown, 
stress levels, and psychological anxiety could predict the 
quality of couple relationship.

Results

Principal components analysis and confirmatory 
factor analysis

We conducted the CFA with five items, as listed in “Per-
ceived changes in sexual behaviour.” All items loaded 
sufficiently, ranging from 0.79 to 0.91, and we divided 
the five items into two factors: factor 1 (item 1, item 2, 
and item 3) and factor 2 (item 4 and item 5). Factor 1 
accounted for 45.06% of the common variance; factor 2 
accounted for 29.58% of the common variance; the total

variance was 74.64% (Table 2). Following these results, 
a two-factor solution with five items was accepted as an 
adequate representation of the factor structure for changes 
in sexual behaviour. The goodness-of-fit of the two-factor 
solution was acceptable, χ2/df = 4.68, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 
0.98, RMSEA = 0.06. These results show that the CFA 
confirmed the factor structure of the scale of sexual behav-
iour. The Cronbach’s alpha for each factor was 0.83 and 
0.65, respectively.

Changes in sexual behaviour, stress levels, anxiety 
symptoms, and couple relationship quality 
of patients with infertility during lockdown

The GAD-7 score for females was significantly lower than 
that for males (p < 0.05). Regarding COVID-19-related anxiety 
symptoms, 3.44% females and 5.17% males reported extreme 
COVID-19-related anxiety, while 16.69% females and 33.13% 
males reported mild COVID-19-related anxiety (p < 0.01). 
The QMI score for females was significantly lower than that 
for males (p < 0.01). Regarding couple relationship during 
the lockdown, 17.18% females and 17.93% males reported an 
improvement in couple relationship during the lockdown, while 
3.11% females and 4.56% males reported a deterioration of cou-
ple relationship (p > 0.05). The PSS-14 score for females was 
significantly lower than that for males (p < 0.01), and males had 
higher stress levels than females (p < 0.01) (Table 3).

Among the participants, 4.75% females and 4.26% males per-
ceived an increase in sexual satisfaction during the lockdown, 
while 5.89% females and 10.33% males perceived a decrease 
in  sexual  satisfaction;  there  was  a  significant  difference 
between the two groups (p < 0.05). Also, 4.42% females and 
5.78% males experienced an increase in sexual desire, while 
10.31% females and 9.42% males experienced a decrease in 
sexual desire during the lockdown (p > 0.05); 5.73% females 
and 5.78% males reported an increase in sexual activity fre-
quency, while 10.64% females and 13.07% males reported a 
decrease in sexual activity frequency (p > 0.05). Moreover, 
males experienced an 11.85% increase and a 19.45% decrease 
in changes in masturbation frequency, while females experi-
enced a 10.47% increase and a 9.49% decrease in changes in 
masturbation frequency in comparison with the pre-lockdown 
period (p < 0.01). For changes in pornography use, males 
experienced a 9.42% increase and a 10.64% decrease, while 
females experienced a 7.36% increase and a 7.36% decrease 
(p < 0.01). The above results revealed that the overall sexual 
behaviour of most participants had not changed significantly 
(Table 3).

Stratified analysis of stress levels and QMI 
score for the changes in sexual behaviour, 
anxiety symptoms, and couple relationship 
during lockdown

We divided the participants into four groups according to the 
PSS-14 score: very high (n = 67), high (n = 188), general (n 
= 499), and low (n = 186). For changes in sexual activity, the 
chi-square test showed that the changes in sexual satisfaction, 
sexual desire, sexual activity frequency, and pornography use 
demonstrated significant differences among the four groups 
(p < 0.01). The changes in the frequency of masturbation had 
no significant differences among the four groups (p > 0.05). 
The GAD-7 score and QMI score were significantly different 
among the four groups (p < 0.01) (Table 4).

On  the  other  hand,  we  divided  the  patients  into  two 
groups according to the QMI score: QMI ≥ 34 (n = 296); 
QMI < 34 (n = 644). The PSS-14 score in the low-quality 
relationship group was significantly higher than in the high-
quality relationship group (p < 0.01). The changes in sex-
ual behaviour, including sexual satisfaction, sexual desire,

revealed that female gender (OR 10.74, 95% CI: 6.21–18.57, 
p < 0.01), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7) (OR 1.50, 95% CI:

(OR 11.52, 95% CI: 2.37–55.89, p < 0.01) were risk factors 
related to poor couple relationship quality. However, high 
sexual activity frequency (OR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.49–0.60, p < 
0.01) and high income levels (OR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.43–0.62, 
p < 0.01) were protective factors for high couple relationship 
quality (Table 6).

Pathway analyses

Pathway analyses indicated that GAD-7 (β = −0.44, p < 
0.01), PSS-14 (β = −0.10, p < 0.01), and factor 2 (β = 
−0.07, p < 0.05) significantly, negatively predicted QMI. 

However, the variable of factor 1 (β = 0.15, p < 0.01) posi-
tively predicted the QMI (Table 7).

Discussion

This is the first study to report changes in sexual behaviour 
and couple relationship quality of patients with infertil-
ity during the lockdown. In this large-scale observational 
cross-sectional study, most of the participants reported no 
change in their sexual behaviour, anxiety symptoms, or cou-
ple relationship quality during lockdown; however, when 
we conducted a stratified analysis of the participants, sig-
nificant differences were found between changes in sexual 
behaviour compared to different stress levels and couple

relationship quality. The sexual activity frequency, anxiety 
symptoms, changes in sexual satisfaction during the lock-
down, and income levels were all associated with couple 
relationship quality. Pathway analyses indicated that anxiety 
symptoms, stress levels, and changes in sexual behaviour can 
all predict the quality of couple relationship. Our findings 
are important, especially with respect to the consultations 
with patients with infertility.

Due to individual differences, context, and relational 
characteristics, people’s stress responses to the pandemic 

vary.  Some  people  lose  interest  in  sex  completely, 
whereas others show an increase in sexual desire and 
sexual activity frequency [18, 38–41]. In our study, the 
participants with high stress levels had significant per-
ceived changes in sexual behaviour compared to those 
with low stress levels; we also observed a high incidence 
of decreases in sexual satisfaction, sexual desire, and 
sexual activity frequency in the very high stress level 
group compared to other groups. Evidence from national 
surveys  of  sexual  life  show  that  the  decline  in  sexual

activity frequency was related to increased use of por-
nography [42]. This supports our findings that pornog-
raphy use increased among patients with high stress lev-
els. Pornography use has increased worldwide during the 
COVID-19 pandemic [43]; it has been used mainly to 

relieve stress, loneliness, boredom, and other pandemic-
related negative emotions [44,  45]. The higher GAD-7 
scores  and  a  high  rate  of  COVID-19-related  anxiety 
reported among patients with high stress levels in our 
study also confirm this point.

We found that female participants had lower QMI scores than 
male participants. A previous study reported that women have 
poorer couple relationship quality than men during the COVID-
19 pandemic, which is related to psychological distress [26]. 
Research also found that females have more psychological distress 
than males during the COVID-19 pandemic [46]. Investigations 
have shown that women experience higher levels of depression 
symptoms and other emotional distress related to infertility than 
men [47–49]. The aforementioned may explain why women had 
lower couple relationship quality than men in our study.

Higher rates of decreases in sexual satisfaction, sexual desire, 
and sexual activity were observed in patients with poor relation-
ship quality than in those with high relationship quality. Further-
more, the logistic regression model revealed that the increases 
in the frequency of sexual activity and sexual satisfaction were 
protective factors for high relationship quality. This is consist-
ent with the findings of Mollaioli et al. who also found that 
frequency of sexual activity can positively predict relationship 
quality [50] and was also confirmed in our pathway analysis.

Anxiety symptoms were a risk factor for poor relation-
ship quality and negatively predicted QMI. The association 
between couple relationship quality and psychological health 
has been confirmed by several studies [51–53]. One study 
conducted during lockdown found that poor relationship 
quality led to a deterioration of mental health and well-being 
[54]. Another study also showed that couple relationship 
quality was related to mental health during the COVID-19 
pandemic [27]; these studies support the connection that we 
have observed in patients with infertility.

Our research found that increased sexual desire, sexual 
activity  frequency,  and  sexual  satisfaction  can  positively 
predict couple relationship quality. The increased changes in 
sexual satisfaction are also a protective factor for couple rela-
tionship quality of patients with infertility and vice versa. The 
observed result is very interesting and meaningful because the 
sexual health of patients with infertility needs to be given more 
attention due to the societal implications of the condition. It is 
of great significance as this information can contribute to the 
improvement of treatment for patients with infertility, espe-
cially in times of crisis. The focus of future research should 
be on a longitudinal study to investigate infertility patients’ 
sexual health, mental health, and couple relationship quality. 
Future studies should also aim to assess the influencing factors 
of couple relationship quality and sexual health of patients with 
infertility in a multi-centre controlled study.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of our study are the large sample size of patients 
with infertility and that it investigates a sensitive topic of which 
there are currently few studies published. This is the first study 

to report changes in sexual behaviour and couple relationship 
quality of patients with infertility during the COVID-19 pan-
demic. Analysing factors that correlated with the quality of 
couple relationship, especially in times of crisis, is of great 
significance as this information can contribute to the improve-
ment of treatment for patients with infertility.

The main limitation of our study is the cross-sectional 
study design. The results relied on participants self-report-
ing changes in their sexual behaviour; thus, any changes 
recorded were subject to recall bias. Furthermore, these 
participants may have been in a relationship that was not 
controlled; this may have introduced a bias to the results 
due to the dyadic interdependence of the outcomes. Further 
large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to understand the 
impact of the lockdown on changes in sexual behaviour in 
different types of patients with infertility.

Conclusion

Perceived changes in sexual behaviour with different stress 
levels and couple relationship quality were significantly 
different during the lockdown. Sexual activity frequency, 
changes  in  sexual  satisfaction,  anxiety  symptoms,  and 
income levels were closely related to couple relationship 
quality. Pathway analyses indicated that anxiety symptoms, 
stress level, and changes in sexual behaviour can all predict 
the quality of a couple’s relationship. Analysing the factors 
that correlate with couple relationship quality, especially in 
times of crisis, is of great significance as this information 
can contribute to the improvement of treatment for patients 
with infertility.
