Abstract

Background: The general public, treatment professionals, and healthcare professionals have 
been found to exhibit an explicit negative bias towards substance use and individuals with a 
substance use disorder (SUD). Terms such as “substance abuser” and “opioid addict” have shown 
to elicit greater negative explicit bias. However, other common terms have yet to be empirically 
studied.

Methods: 1,288 participants were recruited from ResearchMatch. Participants were assigned into 
one of seven groups with different hypothesized stigmatizing and non-stigmatizing terms. 
Participants completed a Go/No Association Task (GNAT) and vignette-based social distance 
scale. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to analyze the GNAT results, and one-way 
ANOVAs were used to analyze vignette results.

Results: The terms “substance abuser”, “addict”, “alcoholic”, and “opioid addict”, were strongly 
associated with the negative and significantly different from the positive counterterms. “Relapse” 
and “Recurrence of Use” were strongly associated with the negative; however, the strength of the 
“recurrence of use” positive association was higher and significantly different from the “relapse” 
positive association. “Pharmacotherapy” was strongly associated with the positive and 
significantly different than “medication-assisted treatment”. Both “medication-assisted recovery” 
and “long-term recovery” were strongly associated with the positive, and significantly different 
from the negative association.

Conclusions: Results support calls to cease use of the terms “addict”, “alcoholic”, “opioid 
addict”, and “substance abuser”. Additionally, it is suggested that “recurrence of use” and 
“pharmacotherapy” be used for their overall positive benefits. Both “medication-assisted recovery” 
and “long-term recovery” are positive terms and can be used when applicable without promoting 
stigma.

Introduction

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a major public health concern in the United States, with 
over 21 million individuals aged 12 and older having a diagnosable SUD, yet fewer than 3.8 
million of these individuals receive treatment each year (Center for Behavioral Health 
Statistics and Quality, 2017). An estimated 28% of the individuals who do not receive 
treatment but perceive a need for treatment, report reasons related to stigma for not 
accessing or engaging in care (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2017). In 
addition to the impact on help-seeking behaviors, stigma is also thought to impact the 
quality of healthcare services delivered by medical professionals (van Boekel et al., 2013), 
as well as the services suggested in a treatment plan by substance use treatment 
professionals (Kelly and Westerhoff, 2010). Thus, stigma presents as a formidable barrier to 
engaging with SUD treatment (Stringer and Baker, 2015; Clement et al., 2015; Stone, 2015), 
the recommendation of SUD treatment services (Kelly and Westerhoff, 2010), and the 
quality of services delivered once engaged (van Boekel et al., 2013).

The general public also has been found to hold stigmatizing perceptions of individuals with 
substance use and mental health disorders. McGinty et al., (2015) and Barry et al. (2014) 
found that public support of policy initiatives, funding levels, and desired social distance 
were impacted when describing behavioral health disorders as either treated or untreated. 
Not surprising then, that of the specific reasons related to the stigma that individuals do not 
seek out treatment annually, the negative perception of neighbors and co-workers is often 
given (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2017). Thus, stigma interacts 
with three different stakeholder groups in the substance use arena: 1) those individuals with 
substance use concerns or disorders, 2) treatment and healthcare professionals, and 3) the 
general public.

Stigma is a multidimensional construct that can manifest in myriad ways (Goffman, 1963). 
Link and Phelan (2001) define stigma in such a way that involves two primary components - 
a label and a stereotype. The label (e.g., addict) links the person to a set of undesirable 
characteristics that work to form the stereotype (i.e., beliefs held about a group of people 
with a substance use disorder). When people link a certain label to a person, and they believe 
the stereotype, they react negatively to the person which in turn leads them to place a more 
social distance from the person, engage in discriminatory ways, or support potentially 
harmful activities to the stereotyped individual.

Previous research has identified commonly used labels that have been used to stereotype 
individuals with a SUD. For instance, substance abuser has been found to invoke negative 
explicit behaviors in treatment professionals (Kelly and Westerhoff, 2010), while “opioid 
addict” elicited greater explicit bias among those in the general population (Goodyear et al., 
2018). Positive counter-terms were also examined, with “person with a substance use

disorder” and “person with an opioid use disorder” eliciting more positive explicit bias. 
Other terms have been put forth as likely to elicit stigma, though they have yet to be 
empirically explored. These terms, such as “clean”, “dirty”, “medication-assisted treatment”, 
“medication-assisted recovery”, “untreated”, and “alcoholic”, also have the potential to 
invoke greater explicit bias (Kelly et al., 2016; Kelly, 2004; Wakeman, 2017).

Stigma is not only experienced and exerted through explicit mechanisms; implicit bias 
mechanisms are also present. Implicit bias is rooted in the assumption that subconscious 
associations exist towards the characteristics of individuals (e.g., race (Greenwald et al., 
1998), body type (Buhlmann et al., 2011), gender (Lemm and Banaji, 1999), and sexual 
orientation (Morrison and Morrison, 2008). These characteristics can also be seen as the 
same characteristics that make up the stereotype described by Link and Phelan (2001). 
Within the substance use field, implicit bias remains a largely unexplored concept. Two pilot 
studies completed by the authors (Ashford et al., 2018a, 2018b), pioneered the use of the 
Go/No-Go Association Task (GNAT; Nosek and Banaji, 2001) in an effort to capture the 
negative and positive implicit associations with the term “substance abuser” and “addict”. 
Results mirrored the previous explicit bias work, with both “substance abuser” and “addict” 
being strongly associated with the negative, and the positive term “person with a substance 
use disorder” being less associated with the negative and significantly different than the 
negative terms.

The use of public awareness and educational campaigns has been found to reduce bias 
related to mental health (Clement et al., 2013), suicide (Dumesnil and Verger, 2009), and 
SUD (Livingston et al., 2012). For substance use bias interventions, Luty et al., (2008) found 
that depicting individuals with an opioid use disorder or alcohol use disorder in positive 
ways resulted in decreased social stigma among the general public. Though public 
awareness and educational interventions can have a positive effect on stigma, it is likely they 
can be improved through the modification of language used within the campaign. Though 
currently not empirically validated, campaigns that aim to reduce SUD social stigma through 
positive depictions of humanity may be of increased benefit from showing individuals as 
having an alcohol use disorder, rather than alcoholism. Thus, identifying the language that 
should be targeted for change is then an important next step.

Building upon the work of the methodology in the two previously completed pilot studies on 
implicit bias (Authors, In Press; Authors, In Review), the objectives of the current study are 
to capture the explicit and implicit bias elicited in commonly used negative (substance 
abuse, addict, alcoholic, opioid addict, relapse, medication assisted-treatment, and 
medication-assisted recovery) and positive terms (person with a substance use disorder, 
person with an alcohol use disorder, person with an opioid use disorder, recurrence of use, 
pharmacotherapy, and long-term recovery) related to substance use, misuse, and disorders 
among members of the general public.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Participants

Page 4

A total of 1,288 participants enrolled in the study. Participants were mostly female (75.8%), 
white (88.8%), and had a mean age of 43.18 years (SD =16.16 years). Most participants 
were married (52.7%), had post-graduate degrees (40.5%), were employed (65.0%), and had 
a household income of over $50,000 (64.1%). Full demographic characteristics are available 
in Table 1. Of the 1288 participants enrolled, 1126 completed all portions of the study 
(demographics, vignette and social distance, GNAT); 162 participants completed all portions 
of the study except the vignette and social distance portion. Participants that completed all 
portions of the study and those that did not complete all portions of the study did not differ 
on any demographic variable.

2.2.  Procedure

Following institutional review board from the lead author’s university, participants were 
recruited through ResearchMatch, a national health volunteer registry that was created by 
several academic institutions and supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health as part 
of the Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) program. ResearchMatch has a large 
population of volunteers who have consented to be contacted by researchers about research 
studies that they are eligible for. An initial interest email was sent to 98,000 random 
volunteers from the ResearchMatch registry. Volunteers that elected to receive more 
information about the study (N = 7500) were then provided a separate email that described 
the study in detail and provided a URL link to the informed consent. Participants that 
consented to participate in the study were sequentially placed into 7 groups representing 
each word pair option of the study (e.g., substance abuser and the person with a substance 
use disorder, addict and person with a substance use disorder, etc.). Each group of 
participants then completed a Go/No Go Association Task, vignette-based social distance 
measure, and provided basic demographics in a randomized order. In addition to the 
randomized order of study tasks, each participant was randomly assigned to one of three 
vignettes within their group; a control vignette, a stigmatizing word vignette, and a non-
stigmatizing word vignette. All data were managed and collected through Qualtrics in an 
anonymous protocol. No IP addresses or geolocation information was collected. Following 
completion of all study items, participants could elect to complete a second survey, not tied 
in any way to the first, in which they provided their contact info to be eligible for a $100 
department store gift card.

2.2.1.  Go/No Go association task—Administration of the Go/No Go Association 
Task (GNAT) began with four practice blocks to introduce each participant to the task, 
asking the participant to classify the objective categories (e.g., substance abuser, addict, etc.) 
with no evaluative category used, and to classify the evaluative categories (e.g., good or bad) 
with no objective category used. Following the practice blocks, each participant completed 
four GNATs, consisting of two blocks each (practice and test). Each block appeared in 
partially randomized order, measuring automatic attitudes towards the hypothesized 
stigmatizing term, as well as measuring automatic attitudes towards the hypothesized non-
stigmatizing term. Following the recommendations of Nosek and Banaji (2001), the

response deadline for the practice blocks was 1000 ms, and the test blocks used response 
deadlines of 750 ms first and 600 ms second. Each practice block consisted of 20 practice 
trials, while test blocks began with 16 practice trials, followed by 60 test trials that were 
used in the final analysis.

2.3.  Measures

2.3.1.  Vignettes—Three vignettes were used for each group of participants in the study, 
for a total of 21 vignettes across the entire study. Examples of vignettes are available in 
Table 2.

For each participant group, the first vignette served as a control and did not portray a person 
with any language related to substance use, treatment, or recovery. The second vignette for 
all groups portrayed the same person (e.g., the white female, Mary), but included 
hypothesized negative terminology (i.e., stigmatizing terms: addict, alcoholic, relapse, etc.) 
related to substance use, treatment, or recovery. The third vignette for all groups portrayed 
the same person but included hypothesized positive terminology (i.e., non-stigmatizing 
terms: a person with a substance use disorder, recurrence of use, etc.). After reading the 
randomly assigned vignettes, participants were asked to complete the Bogardus Social 
Distance Scale (BSDS) in relation to the person described in the assigned vignette.

2.3.2.  GNAT—The GNAT (Nosek and Banaji, 2001) is an implicit association measure 
that is related to the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998). The GNAT 
involves participants classifying objects (i.e., words) into subordinate categories and then 
examining both the speed (response time) and correctness of the classification (signal 
detection theory (SDT; Green and Swets, 1966)). The GNAT provides a d-prime score (from 
the evaluation of response time and correct responses), which is a standardized metric of the 
strength of implicit association. This is an important difference from the IAT and the 
primary reason for the election of the use of the GNAT in the current study. The IAT requires 
a comparison of two categories in the scoring procedure, whereas the GNAT’s d-prime 
scoring procedure allows for analysis and scoring of only one category or multiple 
categories, via the standardized d-prime.

The GNATs administered in this study were a modified version of the GNAT designed by 
Nosek and Banaji (2001) for the Millisecond Inquisit web application. The GNAT requires a 
participant to classify two objective categories (e.g., “Substance Abuser” and “Person with a 
Substance Use Disorder”) with two evaluative categories (e.g., “Good” and “Bad”) via a 
computer software application. For the current study, 7 different GNATs were used; 1) 
substance abuser and person with a substance use disorder, 2) addict and person with a 
substance use disorder, 3) alcoholic and person with an alcohol use disorder, 4) relapse and 
recurrence of use, 5) opioid addict and person with an opioid use disorder, 6) medication-
assisted treatment and pharmacotherapy, and 7) medication-assisted recovery and long-term 
recovery.

The GNATs in the current study were scored using the d-prime (d’) method described by 
Nosek and Banaji (2001), originally defined by Green and Swets (1966). This method 
calculates sensitivity, indexed by d’, by first converting the proportion of correct “go”

responses for signal items and incorrect “go” responses for noise items into z-scores and 
then calculating the difference between the z-score values. Of importance is that d’ values of 
0 or below (negative) indicate that participants were either not performing the task as 
instructed or were unable to identify signal items from noise items correctly. As such, test 
blocks with d’ scores of 0 or below are removed from the final analysis. This resulted in less 
than 8% of participants being excluded from the final analysis in the current study. 
Participants not included in the final GNAT analysis did not differ from those that were 
included on any demographic variable.

2.3.3.  Bogardus social distance scale—The Bogardus Social Distance Scale 
(BSDS) (Bogardus, 1925, 1933) is used to assess the comfort level of participants in 
response to individuals that differ from them across a predetermined set of characteristics 
(i.e., race, ethnicity, etc.). The BSDS was originally developed to assess comfort towards 
individuals of different ethnicity and racial identities; however, it has also been used in 
recent years to assess comfort of doctors towards nurses (Pearlin and Rosenberg, 1962), 
among college students with and without intellectual disabilities (Dent, 1966), and of nurses 
towards patients who are terminally ill (Kalish, 1966). Most recently, we used the BSDS in a 
pilot study prior to completing the current study, to assess the comfort level of the general 
public towards individuals with a substance use disorder - using both stigmatizing and non-
stigmatizing labels (e.g., substance abuser or person with a substance use disorder) (Authors, 
In Review).

The original BSDS studies conducted by Bogardus in 1925 have been replicated multiple 
times in the last 70 years, and though criticism exists questioning the reliability and validity 
of the measure (Krech and Crutchfield, 1947; Sartain and Bell, 1947), the replication studies 
have provided evidence of the measure as a reliable and valid measure (Hartley and Hartley, 
1952; Newcomb, 1950; Sherif and Sherif, 1956).

The BSDS asks participants to answer 7 questions in an effort to measure the desire of the 
participant to allow the described person to: a) marry into immediate family; b) exist within 
immediate social circle; c) be a neighbor; d) be a co-worker; e) be a citizen in participant’s 
country; f) be a visitor to participant’s country; and g) comfort of participant to exclude the 
described person from participant’s country. The BSDS was administered following the 
reading of a randomly assigned vignette describing an individual.

BSDS results in the current study were scored cumulatively, with “yes” responses for 
questions 1–6 given one-point (“no” responses given negative one-point), and “yes” 
responses to question 7 given negative one-point (“no” responses given one-point). Higher 
participant scores on the BSDS correlate with a greater willingness to have less social 
distance between the participant and the described individual in the assigned vignette.

2.4.  Data analysis

All data analysis was completed via IBM SPSS V.23. Statistical significance for all tests was 
defined a priori at 0.05. Analysis of the BSDS scores was completed for each participant 
group using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests with social distance as the DV and 
assigned vignette as the IV. Analysis of the GNAT d’ prime scores was completed for each

DV (term + evaluative category (good/ bad)) measured at the one-time interval. Each level of 
the DV was measured via the GNAT, with each level representing either the hypothesized 
stigmatizing term evaluated towards good and bad or the hypothesized non-stigmatizing 
word evaluated towards good and bad.

3.  Results

3.1.  Social distance

Total social distance scores were not significant for the substance abuser and person with a 
substance use disorder participant group (F (2,125) =1.286, p =.280), the alcoholic and 
person with an alcohol use disorder participant group (F(2,197) =1.001, p =0.369), or the 
medication-assisted recovery and long-term recovery group (F(2, 173) = 1.501, p =0.226).

Scores for the addict and person with substance use disorder participant group were 
significant; F(2, 102) = 7.384, p =0.001. Post-hoc tests using the Sidak correction method 
found a significant difference between the control and addict group (p = 0.001), with the 
addict group having, on average, a 1.27 lower total social distance score. No other post-hoc 
comparisons were significant.

Scores for the relapse and recurrence of use participant group were also significant; F(2, 
166) = 13.686, p <.001. Post-hoc tests using the Sidak correction method found a significant 
difference between both the control and relapse group (p < .001) and the control and 
recurrence of use group (p = .001). On average, the relapse group had a 1.79 lower total 
social distance score than the control group; and the recurrence of use group had a 1.33 
lower total social distance score than the control group. No other post-hoc comparisons were 
significant.

Scores for the opioid addict and person with an opioid use disorder participant group were 
also significant; F(2, 178) =5.559, p =.005. Post-hoc tests using the Sidak correction method 
found a significant difference between both the control and opioid addict group (p = 0.038), 
and the control and person with an opioid use disorder group (p = 0.007). On average, the 
opioid addict group had a 0.88 lower total social distance score than the control group; and 
the person with an opioid use disorder group had a 1.15 lower total social distance score 
than the control group. No other post-hoc comparisons were significant.

Scores for the medication-assisted treatment and pharmacotherapy participant group were 
also significant; F(2, 173) =4.917, p = 0.008. Post-hoc tests using the Sidak correction 
method found a significant difference between both the control and medication-assisted 
treatment group (p =0.024) and the control and pharmacotherapy group (p = 0.019). On 
average, the medication-assisted treatment group had a 1.28 lower total social distance score 
than the control group; and the pharmacotherapy group had a 1.37 lower total social distance 
score than the control group. No other post-hoc comparisons were significant.

Implicit associations

For all participant groups, within-subjects repeated measures ANOVA tests, using 
Greenhouse-Geisser results due to the violation of sphericity for all groups, found significant 
differences (all groups, p < .001). Full ANOVA results are available in Table 3.

Post-hoc tests (full results available in Tables 3–9) were completed for all pairwise 
comparisons using the Sidak correction method. For the substance abuser and person with 
substance use disorder group, “substance abuser” + bad (d’ = 2.169) was the strongest 
association, and significantly different from “substance abuser” + good (d’ =1.222, p < 
0.001), ‘person with a substance use disorder” + good (d’ =1.337, p < 0.001) and “person 
with a substance use disorder” + bad (d’ =1.862, p =0.007). (See Table 4)

For the addict and person with a substance use disorder group, “addict” + bad (d’ =2.395) 
was the strongest association, and significantly different from “addict” + good (d’ = 1.584, p 
< 0.001), “person with a substance use disorder” + good (d’ =1.584, p <0.001), and “person 
with a substance use disorder” + bad (d’ = 2.069, p =0.001). (See Table 5)

For the alcoholic and person with an alcohol use disorder group, “alcoholic” + bad (d’ 
=2.436) was the strongest association, and significantly different from “alcoholic” + good 
(d’ = 1.548, p < 0.001), “person with an alcohol use disorder” + good (d’ =1.624, p < 0.001), 
and “person with an alcohol use disorder” + bad (d’ = 2.031, p <0.001). (See Table 6)

For the relapse and recurrence of use group, both “relapse” + bad (d’ =1.940) and 
“recurrence of use” + bad (d’ =2.016) were the strongest associations and were not 
significantly different from each other (p =0.833). Additionally, “relapse” + bad and 
“recurrence of use +bad were significantly different than “relapse” + good (d’ =0.900, p < .
001), and “recurrence of use” + good (d’ =1.426, p <0.001). Of note is that “recurrence of 
use” + good, though not the strongest association overall, was significantly different than 
“relapse” + good (p <0.001). (See Table 7)

For the opioid addict and person with an opioid use disorder group, “opioid addict” + bad 
(d’ =2.413) was the strongest association, and significantly different from “opioid addict” + 
good (d’ =1.681, p <0.001), “person with an opioid use disorder” + good (d’ = 1.740, p 
<0.001), and “person with an opioid use disorder” + bad (d’ =2.218, p =0.010). (See Table 
8)

For the medication-assisted treatment and pharmacotherapy group, “pharmacotherapy” + 
good (d’ = 1.990) was the strongest association, and significantly different from 
“pharmacotherapy” + bad (d’ =1.770, p = 0.015), “medication-assisted treatment” + good 
(d’ =1.701, p < 0.001), and “medication-assisted treatment” + bad (d’ =1.775, p = 0.009). 
(See Table 9)

For the medication-assisted recovery and long-term recovery group, “medication-assisted

4.  Discussion

Results from the current study provide the first analysis of both implicit and explicit bias 
elicited from multiple hypothesized stigmatizing terms and hypothesized non-stigmatizing 
terms. Previous studies have found that greater explicit negative bias results from using 
terms such as “substance abuser” over terms such as “person with a substance use disorder” 
(Kelly and Westerhoff, 2010), as well as the term “opioid addict” over terms such as “person 
with an opioid use disorder” (Goodyear et al., 2018). Similar to these studies, the results 
here show that “substance abuser” and “opioid addict” are indeed mostly strongly associated 
with the negative, and significantly different from the positive counter terms “person with a 
substance use disorder” and “person with an opioid use disorder” respectively. While it has 
already been suggested in previous work that these negatively associated terms ceased being 
used, the current results provide further empirical evidence that the terms should indeed be 
removed from the lexicon and replaced with the positively associated terms.

Previous editorial publications have also theorized that terms such as “alcoholic”, “relapse”, 
“addict”, “medication-assisted treatment”, and “medication-assisted recovery” may also 
elicit negative bias and should potentially be replaced by less stigmatizing terms (Wakeman, 
2017; Kelly et al., 2016; Kelly, 2004). Results from the current study have also validated a 
number of these previous theories, with “alcoholic”, “relapse”, and “addict”, all being most 
strongly associated with the negative. However, a few important distinctions should also be 
made.

Only the terms “addict” and “alcoholic” were higher and significantly different than the 
hypothesized positive counter terms “person with a substance use disorder” and “person 
with an alcohol use disorder” respectively; and suggest that using “person with a substance 
use disorder” and “person with an alcohol use disorder” could decrease elicited negative 
implicit bias. “Relapse” being associated with the negative was not significantly different 
than “recurrence of use” being associated with the negative, however, the strength of the 
“recurrence of use” association with the positive was higher and significantly different than 
that of the “relapse” positive association; this suggests that while both terms are negatively 
associated, there does exist potential benefit of using “recurrence of use”.

Interestingly, the association of “medication-assisted treatment” was not significantly 
different among the positive or negative. However, the association of “pharmacotherapy” to 
the positive was the strongest association, and significantly different from the positive 
association to “medication-assisted treatment”; while this does not support the notion that 
“medication-assisted treatment” is likely to elicit stronger negative implicit bias, it does 
suggest that using “pharmacotherapy” in its place is more likely to elicit stronger positive 
implicit bias. Similarly, “medication-assisted recovery” was associated with higher levels of 
positive bias and was significantly different than the positive association to “long-term 
recovery”. While this does seem to suggest that using the term “medication-assisted 
recovery” is likely to elicit stronger positive implicit bias than “long-term recovery”, the

primary conclusion should be that “medication-assisted recovery” is not likely to elicit 
stronger negative implicit bias (and thus can be used without promoting stigma), and that 
both recovery terms (e.g., medication-assisted recovery” and “long-term recovery”) are in 
fact positively associated terms.

The current study sampled from the general public, and while additional study is needed on 
the levels of bias among individuals with a SUD and health care professionals, the results 
provide support for practical applications of language use in interventions designed to 
reduce bias and stigma among the general public. For example, public awareness campaigns 
designed for any channel of distribution (e.g., print, video, social media) should use the 
more positive variants discussed here. SUD Public awareness campaigns have been found to 
decrease social stigma among the general public (Luty et al., 2008), and it is likely that 
similar campaigns designed with language that elicits less negative bias will show improved 
results.

Results from the Bogardus Social Distance Scale provide initial evidence that an explicit 
bias effect is produced when using different labeling and identifying terms in text-based 
vignettes. However, the results do not support that explicit negative bias can be reduced by 
using hypothesized positive terms. Reviewing previous vignette-based explicit bias studies 
(Kelly and Westerhoff, 2010; McGinty et al., 2015; Goodyear et al., 2018), we believe that 
our current sample size, though supported through a power analysis to capture medium 
effect sizes, was ultimately too small to capture any significant differences between the 
positive and negative terms. It is plausible that any term that is associated with substance use 
disorder invokes an overall negative affect, supported by many of the vignette results having 
lower total social distance and significant differences compared to the control, but not 
between substance use related terms. It is also possible that the use of the Bogardus Social 
Distance Scale was too broad and confounded the results and our initial power analysis; 
other more defined measures of explicit bias towards addiction, such as the Perceived 
Stigma and Addiction Scale (PSAS; Luoma et al., 2010), could have proved a better choice. 
Overall, while the social distance scales do not support using the hypothesized positive 
terms over the hypothesized negative terms, they do suggest that any language used to 
describe substance use and related topics can elicit stronger negative explicit bias - including 
hypothesized negative terms.

4.1.  Limitations

Though the sampling and recruitment methodology from ResearchMatch provided certain 
strengths to the current study, it also resulted in an oversampling of female and white 
participants. This is a known limitation of the volunteer participant pool enrolled at 
ResearchMatch, and future study should strive to recruit a truly representative sample. 
Additionally, the use of the Bogardus Social Distance Scale should be avoided in a future 
study as it is likely too broad to capture explicit biases related to addiction accurately. 
Measures such as the Perceived Stigma of Addiction Scale are likely better options to 
capture the construct. A recently published study (Goodyear et al., 2018) also found that the 
portrayal of gender in vignettes can affect reported biases, thus suggesting that our use of 
only the female gender in all vignettes may have confounded the explicit bias results.

4.2.  Future directions

Page 11

Future research into the domain of language and stigma, as it pertains to the substance use 
and recovery communities, should continue to explore positive counter-terms. While two of 
the results from the current study were overtly positive, the remaining positive terms were 
simply less negative. While this is an improvement, it suggests that the field must continue 
to evaluate its language and find better replacements. Additionally, previous research has 
suggested that health professionals may experience greater levels of biases, and the terms 
studied here should be further studied with samples drawn from those employed in the 
health professions. Future exploration of the ability to predict future behaviors (e.g., policy 
support, funding support, treatment recommendations, success in treatment) from levels of 
implicit and explicit bias may also prove useful. Though trending evidence suggests that at 
the public health and clinical level, negative terms should not be used, more research is 
needed specific to policymakers, organizations, and criminal justice professionals.

While language choice can be used to modify the elicited biases, it is also possible that the 
perception of language can be modified through other interventions. Theories such as 
priming and language reclamation should be applied to linguistics research in the substance 
use domain, attempting to find interventions or practices that can help reduce negative bias 
or improve positive bias.

Finally, all of the proposed language as perceived by individuals in recovery is also a critical 
area of exploration. Self-identifying as an “addict” or “alcoholic”, done primarily in mutual-
aid programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous, is used as an act of catharsis (Goffman, 1963; 
McIntosh and McKeganey, 2001; Hughes, 2007), facilitating a type of identity reclamation, 
similar to other marginalized groups who have reclaimed stigmatizing labels as an act of 
social empowerment (Gaucher et al., 2015). Promoting language change among this milieu 
of the recovery community will require additional evidence that this catharsis and identity 
reclamation is also achievable using more positive language.

5.  Conclusion

The language used in describing substance use, substance use disorders, and other related 
topics affect the types of explicit and implicit bias that individuals experience. Terms such as 
“substance abuser”, “addict”, “opioid addict”, “alcoholic”, and “relapse” should be used 
sparingly, if at all. More positive terms can be used in their place, such as “person with a 
substance use disorder”, “person with an opioid use disorder”, “person with an alcohol use 
disorder”, and “recurrence of use”, and are likely to elicit stronger positive implicit bias and 
minimize any negative explicit or implicit bias. Additionally, though the term “medication-
assisted treatment” is not likely to elicit stronger negative biases, replacing the term with 
“pharmacotherapy” elicits stronger positive implicit biases and may serve clients in more 
empowering ways. Finally, both “medication-assisted recovery” and “long-term recovery” 
elicit strong positive implicit associations and either can likely be used without promoting 
stigma when applicable.
