Abstract
Background  The ability to regulate one’s emotional state is an important predictor of several behaviors such as 
reframing a challenging situation to reduce anger or anxiety, concealing visible signs of sadness or fear, or focusing 
on reasons to feel happy or calm. This capacity is referred to as emotion regulation. Deficits in this ability can adversely 
affect one’s adaptive coping, thus are associated with a variety of other psychopathological symptoms, including but 
not limited to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance use disorders, eating disorders, and somatoform 
disorders.

Methods  The present study examined emotion regulation in relation to the virtue-based psychosocial adaptation 
model (V-PAM). 595 participants were clustered based on their Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) score, 
producing two clusters (i.e., high functioning vs. low functioning). Then, emotion regulation group membership was 
discriminated by using five V-PAM virtue constructs, including courage, integrity, practical wisdom, committed action, 
and emotional transcendence.

Results  Results show that five virtues contribute to differentiating group membership. Practical wisdom was the 
strongest contributor, followed by integrity, emotional transcendence, committed action, and courage. Predictive 
discriminant analysis was conducted and 71% of cases were correctly classified. A discussion of the relationship 
between emotion regulation and virtues was elaborated.

Conclusion  The concept of virtue holds significant importance in the comprehension of an individual’s capacity to 
regulate their emotions, meriting future study.

Introduction
Emotion  regulation  and  virtues  are  two  important  pro-
tective  factors  for  positive  psychosocial  adaptation  to 
life  adversity.  While  the  exploration  of  virtue  is  a  rela-
tively recent endeavor within the context of psychosocial 
adaptation, emotion regulation is well-established. Emo-
tion  regulation  refers  to  the  ability  to  control  emotional 
responses  and  behaviors  including  thinking  through  the 
situation.  Theoretical  connections  between  emotional 
regulation and virtue emerge from perspectives in physi-
cal and behavioral medicine. Di Giacomo and colleagues 
[1] examined the impact of psychological aspects within 
the scope of hypertension management via the lens of the 
relationship  between  emotion  regulation  and  self-care 
skills.  Similarly,  Leukel  et  al.  [2]  investigated  the  role  of 
emotion regulation in relation to diabetes-related distress 
management.  Both  studies  found  the  significant  influ-
ence  of  emotion  regulation  on  enhancing  self-care  skills 
and  promoting  improved  psychological  outcomes.  This 
evidence is further corroborated by an integrative review 
study conducted by Wierenga, Rebecca, Lehto, and Given 
[3], which underscores the impact of emotion regulation 
on behaviors in healthy individuals.

In  contemporary  counseling,  virtue  is  operationalized 
as  the  consistent  practice  of  personally  important  val-
ues.  Although  universally  valued,  such  as  honesty,  may 
not be consistently practiced by all people. The explora-
tion of virtues within the areas of health and behavioral 
medicine  has  been  a  growing  area  of  study.  Hanks  and 
colleagues’  research  showed  that  virtues  play  a  predic-
tive  role  in  fostering  greater  life  satisfaction  and  per-
ceived  community  engagement.  However,  a  relatively 
weaker association was found between virtues and objec-
tive  well-being  [4].  Additionally,  a  strong  relationship 
between  the  virtues  of  honesty  and  integrity  and  the 
lower risk of depression was also found in a 2021 study by 
Weziak-Bialowolska  and  colleagues  [5].  Given  that  both 
emotion regulation and virtues involve behavioral action 
and contribute to overall well-being, a theoretical linkage 
between these two constructs exists. Therefore, the pres-
ent study aims to identify this relationship.

Emotion regulation and well-being

Emotion  regulation  involves  positive  and  negative  emo-
tions [6]. This process of emotion regulation enables the 
recognition of antecedent conditions that trigger specific 
emotions as well as the emotion themselves, thus its pro-
cess  has  received  attention  from  various  disciplines  due 
to the extensive impact of emotions on human behavior 
and  well-being.  Numerous  empirical  studies  have  dem-
onstrated that emotion regulation plays a significant role 
in  fostering  adaptive  cognitive  style,  decision-making 
abilities,  and  behavioral  intentions  in  response  to  social 

and  situational  demands,  ultimately  impacting  an  indi-
vidual’s well-being [7].

The  emotion  regulation  strategies  further  involve 
situation  selection/modification  (i.e.,  active  coping), 
attentional  deployment  (i.e.,  distraction  and  rumina-
tion),  cognitive  change  (i.e.,  cognitive  reappraisal),  and 
response-modulation  (i.e.,  expressive  suppression)  in 
response to stressful situations, while emotion dysregula-
tion  often  leads  to  maladaptive  behaviors.  For  example, 
according  to  Folkman  and  Lazarus  [8],  two  critical  fac-
tors  that  determine  an  individual’s  coping  behaviors  are 
their perceived appraisal of stressful situations and their 
own  capacities  to  respond  to  these  situations.  When 
faced  with  stressful  situations,  individuals  can  use  cog-
nitive  reappraisal  or  restructuring  as  their  emotional 
regulation  strategy  to  moderate  their  perception  of  the 
situation. This reappraisal leads to more adaptive ways of 
interacting  with  the  situation.  Conversely,  poorly  regu-
lated  emotions  are  associated  with  maladaptive  cogni-
tions such as repetitive rumination and rehearsal [9, 10]. 
In  sum,  emotion  regulation  can  contribute  to  increased 
psychological well-being by helping individuals to evalu-
ate and use more adaptive coping strategies to effectively 
address  stressful  situations  rather  than  relying  on  mal-
adaptive coping behaviors to avoid stressors or suppress 
negative  emotions  simply.  Previous  literature  also  has 
supported  the  beneficial  impacts  of  emotion  regulation 
strategies  associated  with  solution-focused  coping  and 
elevated  psychological  well-being.  In  contrast,  dysregu-
lation has been strongly related to psychological distress 
and maladaptive behaviors [11, 12].

Virtue and well-being

Virtue  is  an  emerging  area  of  study  in  the  context  of 
well-being  and  life  thriving  [13].  In  the  early  history  of 
psychology,  it  was  once  a  popular  topic,  but  it  became 
disfavored  with  the  rise  of  empiricism  in  psychological 
science.  This  was  due  to  the  perception  that  virtue  was 
more  moral  and  philosophical  concepts,  making  them 
difficult  to  investigate  empirically  [14].  However,  the 
importance  of  virtue  in  behavior  science  was  reclaimed 
with  the  growth  of  positive  psychology.  It  was  because 
founders  of  positive  psychologists  such  as  Peterson  and 
Seligman  were  able  to  provide  theoretical  definitions  of 
virtues  from  a  character  perspective  [13,  14].  This  was 
achieved  by  distinguishing  virtue  from  value.  Value  is 
what  an  individual  thinks  is  important,  while  virtue  is 
the  value  a  person  practices.  For  example,  while  many 
people may consider honesty to be important, not every-
body  lives  upon  the  value  of  honesty.  When  a  person 
constantly practices honesty or other values, it becomes 
integrated  into  their  character  that  represents  who  the 
individual  is.  Thus,  the  value  of  honesty  is  difficult  to 
measure.  But,  when  it  became  one’s  character  through 

Kim et al. BMC Psychology           (2024) 12:11 Page 3 of 11

the constant practice of honesty, it becomes measurable 
in  modern  psychology.  In  that,  a  character  is  a  behav-
ior  manifestation  of  virtue.  This  operational  distinction 
between virtue and value enabled empirical investigation 
of  virtue. This  theoretical  distinction  has  also  had  a  sig-
nificant  impact  on  the  counseling  field  as  it  sparked  an 
empirical investigation of the relationship between virtue 
and  life-thriving.  The  following  section  highlights  some 
of the recent research evidence in this area.

Positive  psychology  study  conducted  in  the  early  21st 
century  found  that  hope,  zest,  love,  gratitude,  and  curi-
osity  were  to  be  substantially  related  to  life  satisfaction, 
while  modesty,  appreciation  of  beauty,  creativity,  judg-
ment, and love of learning were found to have a weaker 
association  [15].  Peterson  and  colleagues  [16]  extended 
their  study  to  examine  the  relationship  between  char-
acter  traits  and  recovery  from  illness.  They  found  that 
individuals  who  had  recovered  from  a  serious  illness 
exhibited higher levels of appreciation of beauty, bravery, 
curiosity,  fairness,  forgiveness,  gratitude,  humor,  kind-
ness, love of learning, and spirituality compared to those 
who had never experienced such an illness. In 2009, Park 
and  Peterson  [17]  replicated  their  study  with  a  young 
population and found love, gratitude, hope, and zest are 
relevant  to  adolescents’  life  satisfaction.  In  2011,  Proyer 
and  colleagues  [18]  reconfirmed  that  hope,  gratitude, 
love, zest, and curiosity are important in life satisfaction, 
and  hope  and  spirituality  were  the  strongest  predictors 
of life satisfaction. In 2016 and 2018, Kim and colleagues 
[19, 20] also conducted research on whether virtue could 
differentiate  adaptation  and  resilience  levels  following 
the  onset  of  disability.  The  finding  was  that  one’s  long-
term  commitment  and  emotional  transcendence  were 
the  most  significant  contributors  in  differentiating  their 
adaptation to chronic illness and disability.

Purpose and research questions

Given  the  role  of  emotions  and  virtue  in  regard  to  the 
individuals’  life  and  well-being,  it  is  important  to  con-
sider  how  a  person’s  ability  to  effectively  manage  and 
respond  to  an  emotional  experience,  known  as  emotion 
regulation, is related and integral to the development and 
maintenance  of  virtues.  However,  few  studies  have  con-
ducted  the  relationship  between  virtues/character  traits 
and emotion regulation. Thus, the purpose of this study 
was to examine the role of virtues in emotion regulation. 
The  following  research  questions  were  of  interest  of  the 
current study:

1.  Is it possible to categorize participants into two or 

more groups that reflect one’s ability to regulate their 
emotion, conceptualized in terms of difficulties in 
emotion regulation? Then, what are the unique group 
characteristics?

2.  Do virtues have a contributory effect in 

differentiating participants’ group membership 
determined based on their ability to regulate 
emotion?

Method
Participants and procedure

A  total  of  845  Koreans  aged  between  20  and  59  partici-
pated in the present study with 595 cases being retained 
after data-cleaning procedures. The survey took approxi-
mately 30 min to complete, and the participants received 
online  credit  points  as  compensation.  The  online  sur-
vey was conducted using a secure internet-based survey 
company,  which  utilizes  a  firewall  (WAF)  and  the  Digi-
Cert security service, a reputable digital certificate asso-
ciation.  The  online  survey  system  is  regularly  scanned 
for  vulnerabilities  by  automated  systems  that  network 
environment,  operating  system,  is  periodically  tested. 
Additionally,  all  survey  responses  are  collected  through 
encrypted  Secure  Sockets  Layer  connections  (SSL:  the 
standard  technology  for  establishing  an  encrypted  link 
between a web server and a browser), ensuring the secu-
rity of private information. After the survey is completed, 
the  company  ensures  that  all  data  was  securely  erased 
and destroyed.

Among  595  adults  who  participated  in  the  research, 
325 (54%) were male and 270 (44%) were female. The larg-
est age group was individuals in their 40s (31%), followed 
by those in their 30s (28%), 20s (21%), and 50s (20%). The 
majority  of  participants  were  heterosexual  (494,  83%) 
characteristics with middle (380, 64%) and upper middle 
class (138, 23%). When asked about self-identified mental 
illness  (i.e.,  ever  hospitalized  or  consider  hospitalization 
due  to  mental  illness),  most  participants  answered  no 
(520, 87%). Of the total sample, 106 (18%) indicated hav-
ing a chronic illness or a disability (CID). CID in the pres-
ent  study  refers  to  any  illness  that  lasts  over  a  6-month 
period. Among those 106 people with CID, 93 individu-
als  (83%)  were  receiving  disability  related  benefits  from 
South Korean government. Other disability related char-
acteristics were summarized in Table 1.

Instruments
Difficulties in emotion regulation scale

Difficulties  in  Emotional  Regulation  Scale  (DERS)  [21] 
translated by Cho [22] was used to operationalize partici-
pants’  ability  to  regulate  their  emotions.  DERS  includes 
36  items  designed  to  ask  respondents  how  they  relate 
to  their  emotions  to  produce  scores  on  six  subscales: 
(1)  nonacceptance  of  emotional  responses,  (2)  difficulty 
engaging  in  goal-directed  behavior,  (3)  impulse  control 
difficulties,  (4)  lack  of  emotional  awareness,  (5)  limited 
access  to  emotion  regulation  strategies,  and  (6)  lack  of

emotional  clarity.  DERS  utilizes  a  five-point  rating  scale 
(1 = almost  never,  2 = sometimes,  3 = about  half  the  time, 
4 = most of the time, and 5 = almost always), with a higher 
score  indicating  more  difficulties.  Based  on  a  sample  of 
427  adults  presenting  at  an  outpatient  clinic  diagnosed 
with  one  or  more  DSM-5  disorders,  Hallion  and  col-
leagues [23] found that the DERS had good internal con-
sistency,  particularly  when  the  Awareness  subscale  is 
excluded.  This  indicates  that  Awareness  may  be  a  sepa-
rate construct. Thus, in the Korean version of DERS, the 
Awareness subscale was not included.

Adapted inventory of virtues and strengths

Adapted Inventory of Virtues and Strengths (AIVS) [20] 
is a 46-item measure with five subscales that operational-
izes five virtue factors of V-PAM (i.e., courage, integrity, 
practical wisdom, committed action, and emotional tran-
scendence)  in  terms  of  corresponding  character  traits. 
Utilizing  a  7-point  semantic  differential  scale  with  pairs 
of  opposing  adjectives  or  short  phrases  anchoring  the 
two  extremes,  AIVS  can  be  administered  in  10–15  min. 
To reduce response bias, the polarities of some items are 
reversed  and  the  higher  score  of  each  item  indicates  a 
positive  self-perception  of  the  testing  item  (e.g.,  coward 
– bravery). Reported alphas of AIVS in previous studies 
range  from  0.70  to  0.90,  indicating  acceptable  to  strong 
reliability [20, 24, 25]. The alpha coefficients of AIVS fac-
tors in the current samples ranged from 0.77 to 0.86.

Data analysis

Cluster analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and dis-
criminant  analysis  were  employed  for  the  current  study. 
Cluster  analysis  was  used  to  divide  the  sample  into 
smaller  subgroups,  based  on  the  levels  of  difficulties  in 
emotional  regulation.  Then,  ANOVA  was  performed  to 
examine the distinct characteristics in terms of emotional 
regulation  between  the  subgroups,  identified  from  the 
cluster  analysis.  Finally,  discriminant  analysis  was  con-
ducted  to  identify  the  contributory  effects  of  five  virtue 
subconstructs on group membership.

Results
Cluster analysis followed by ANOVA

To address research question 1, cluster analysis followed 
by  ANOVA  was  employed.  To  determine  the  proper 
cluster  solution,  changes  in  agglomeration  coefficient 
and  scree  plot  were  inspected.  Concerning  changes  in 
agglomeration  coefficients  (Table  2),  there  was  a  sig-
nificant  change  from  1  cluster  to  2  clusters,  but  small 
changes  after  2  cluster  solutions. This  suggests  the  two-
cluster solution. The elbow of the scree plot (Fig. 1) was 
also  examined,  confirming  that  2-cluster  solution  was 
optimal.  To  identify  group  characteristics,  a  univariate

to  emotion  regulation  strategies,  difficulty  engaging  in 
goal-directed  behavior).  Group  1  was  labeled  as  lower 
functioning in emotion regulation (i.e., higher score indi-
cating  more  difficulties  in  emotion  regulation),  while 
Group  2  was  labeled  as  higher  functioning  in  emotion 
regulation.

Discriminant analysis

To  examine  the  contributory  effect  of  virtue  in  differ-
entiating  emotion  regulation  levels  (research  question 
2),  group  memberships  (lower  functioning  vs.  higher 
functioning)  were  discriminated  by  five  V-PAM  virtues. 
And,  λ = 0.811,  F  (5,  590) = 123.51  p = .00,  indicating  vir-
tue  contributes  to  differentiating  emotion  regulation 
membership.  Structure  matrix  that  shows  the  correla-
tion  between  discriminant  variables  and  discriminant 
function  revealed  that  Practical  Wisdom  was  the  stron-
gest predictor (0.844) followed by Integrity (0.836), Emo-
tional Transcendence (0.827), Committed Action (0.678), 
and  Courage  (0.445).  Utilizing  predictive  discriminant 
analysis,  group  members  of  the  original  case  were  pre-
dicted and 71% of original cases were correctly classified. 
The  results  of  discriminant  analysis  are  summarized  in 
Table 4.

Discussion
In light of the fact that both emotion regulation and vir-
tue are considered to be protective factors for enhancing 
human  flourishing,  theoretical  linkage  exists  between 
the two constructs. However, limited literature indicates 
the needs of scientific examination of two constructs and 
it  was  the  aim  of  the  present  study.  Emotion  regulation

was  operationalized  in  terms  of  impulse  control  diffi-
culties,  nonacceptance  of  emotional  response,  lack  of 
emotional  clarity,  limited  access  to  emotion  regulation, 
difficulty  engaging  in  goal-directed  behavior.  595  adults 
were first classified into low- and high-functioning emo-
tional regulation groups. Then, group memberships were 
discriminated based on five virtues. Results revealed that 
practical wisdom is the greatest contributor in differenti-
ating emotion regulation functioning (0.844), followed by 
integrity (0.836), emotional transcendence (0.827), com-
mitted  action  (0.678),  and  courage  (0.445).  Discussions 
on the relationship between emotion regulation and each 
of virtue construct were elaborated.

Practical wisdom and emotion regulation

Practical Wisdom, a construct of the five V-PAM virtues, 
was found to be the most significant contributor to indi-
viduals’ ability to regulate their emotions and determine 
group  membership.  Practical  wisdom  has  been  concep-
tualized  as  a  set  of  skills  that  involves  making  best  situ-
ational  decisions  based  on  knowledge,  experience,  and 
moral  virtues  [19,  26].  In  addition,  practical  wisdom  is 
linked to self-awareness and one’s ability to set situation-
ally realistic goals [19]. Individuals with practical wisdom 
are  adept  at  evaluating  their  strengths  and  limitations, 
identifying areas for improvement, and establishing goals

that  align  with  their  values  and  interests.  They  are  also 
capable of adapting to changing circumstances and mak-
ing  informed  decisions  based  on  their  knowledge  and 
experiences. Practical wisdom encompasses several com-
ponents,  including  self-reflection,  decisiveness,  accep-
tance  of  uncertainty,  empathy,  and  compassion  [26]. 
Notably, emotion regulation is considered as one of these 
components and the relationship between emotion regu-
lation and practical wisdom has been documented in var-
ious studies [27–30]. Practicing practical wisdom enables 
individuals  to  make  appropriate  situational  decisions, 
especially  when  faced  with  emotionally-charged  life  cir-
cumstances,  and  helps  ensure  that  emotional  responses 
are not excessive or misleading [14, 27]. As such, individ-
uals  who  can  reevaluate  their  emotional  experiences  or 
take  constructive  measures  to  handle  difficult  situations 
are more adept at adjusting to life’s fluctuations [31, 32]. 
Taken  together,  based  on  our  findings  on  the  differen-
tial impact of virtue on emotion regulation, it is evident 
that  practical  wisdom  is  vital  for  individuals  to  navigate 
through the challenges of life and cultivate the ability to 
control their emotional state. Therefore, cultivating prac-
tical  wisdom  could  facilitate  positive  adaptation  to  life 
adversity.

Integrity and emotion regulation

The  present  study  found  integrity  was  the  second  most 
significant  virtue  factor  that  influences  one’s  ability  to 
regulate  emotion.  This  finding  is  relatively  new  in  cur-
rent literature, as there has been a lack of research on the 
direct  relationship  between  integrity  and  emotion  regu-
lation.  However,  there  exist  studies  that  explored  these 
two constructs from a social and relational factors asso-
ciated  one’s  well-being.  For  instance,  integrity  is  a  criti-
cal factor of trust, commitment, and honesty pertaining 
to relational aspects of one’s life, and it is associated with 
the individual’s ability to manage and maintain individual 
relationships  [33].  According  to  V-PAM,  integrity  is  a 
communal aspect of virtue that is highly related to ability 
to build trust with others. Thus, integrity influences one’s 
inter- and intrapersonal growth, and helps individuals to 
be mindful in their commitment and honest in their deci-
sion-making  process  [25].  Therefore,  the  current  study 
provides an evidence that individuals with a high level of 
integrity have an ability to better establish and maintain 
mutual relationships and support network, thus, in turn, 
it  positively  promotes  one’s  ability  to  regulate  and  man-
age emotions adaptively [34–36]. This finding aligns with 
previous studies that have highlighted the importance of 
social  factors  in  shaping  emotion  regulation  processes, 
warranting future research that examines the relationship 
between integrity and emotion regulation.

Transcendence and emotion regulation

The  current  study  confirmed  that  transcendence  had 
the  third  contributory  factor  to  emotional  regulation. 
In  V-PAM,  transcendence  is  conceptualized  in  terms  of 
character  traits  like  loving,  meaningfulness  of  life,  for-
giveness,  optimism,  thankful/gratefulness,  enthusiasm, 
caring, and spirituality [25]. Cultivating these characters 
might act as a buffer against cognitive vulnerabilities that 
can  exacerbate  negative  psychological  symptoms  [37]. 
From  this  perspective,  transcendence  allows  an  individ-
ual’s  experience  of  psychological  adversity  to  be  under-
stood as a stage of growth and to transform that situation 
into a positive perspective, such as by bringing hope into 
emotional  challenges  [13].  These  traits  also  have  been 
shown  in  the  relationship  with  emotional  regulation. 
For example, having a religion leads to greater emotional 
regulation  [38],  and  gratitude  is  an  effective  emotion-
regulation  intervention  that  involves  tuning  in  to  what 
works well in our environments and savoring the positive 
[39]. The relationship between transcendence and regula-
tion in the emotional aspect can also bring benefits that 
extend  the  autonomy  of  the  client  as  it  promotes  self-
reflection  and  further  allows  an  individual  to  redefine 
their  life  experience  from  more  constructive  lens.  Self-
reflection is one’s ability to examine, concentrate on, and 
assess  one’s  cognitive,  emotional,  and  behavioral  pro-
cesses, as well as the individual’s desire to gain a deeper 
understanding of their goals, purposes, and authentic self 
[40].  Through  this  reflective  transcendence  mechanism, 
individuals  can  navigate  complex  emotional  situations, 
discerning the differences between subjective and objec-
tive  aspects  of  life  circumstance.  Therefore,  promoting 
emotional  transcendence  can  assist  people  in  autono-
mously recognizing, using, and evaluating relevant their 
character assets to overcome challenging situations [13].

Commitment and emotion regulation

Adversity  comes  in  all  different  forms  for  people  in  life. 
Personal  experiences  might  include  things  like  disease, 
the death of a loved one, abuse, acquiring a disability or 
illness,  losing  a  job,  and  financial  difficulty.  Tragic  news 
stories about terrorist attacks, mass shootings, and natu-
ral  disasters  are  a  common  reality.  Humans  must  learn 
how  to  deal  with  and  get  through  difficult  life  circum-
stances.  Yadav  and  Hooda  [41],  with  147  osteoarthritis 
patients,  examined  the  relationship  between  resilience 
and  psychological  flexibility.  Psychological  flexibility  in 
their  study  was  conceptualized  in  terms  of  pain  accep-
tance,  activity  engagement,  pain  willingness,  values, 
mindfulness,  cognitive  fusion,  decentering,  rumination, 
self  as  context,  and  committed  action.  Results  showed 
that pain acceptance, values, decentering, self as context, 
and committed action had a significant positive correla-
tion to pain-related resilience while cognitive fusion and 

rumination  had  a  significant  negative  relationship  with 
resilience.

Committed action refers to a person’s long-term striv-
ing  or  deliberate  action  to  overcome  any  difficulties  in 
order to achieve goals, even in the face of obstacles [33]. 
This  long-term  pursuit  of  excellence  is  a  key  factor  that 
promotes ultimate psychosocial adaptation to life adver-
sity  as  it  helps  individual  maintain  lofty  goals  driven  by 
intrinsic  interests  and  motivations  [33].  Motivation  is 
the  foundation  for  human  learning  and  development 
[42].  Human  can  be  motivated  by  various  extrinsic  and 
intrinsic  factors,  but  intrinsic  motivation  is  the  most 
optimal form of motivation as it is associated with vari-
ous  benefits  such  as  personal  enjoyment,  psychological 
well-being, and the promotion of behavior [43, 44]. Com-
mitted  long-term  action  is  a  behavior  manifestation  of 
one’s motivation, but, most of time, it is difficult as chal-
lenging life situations will turn down individual’s motiva-
tion at any time. In such a situation, strong commitment 
helps an individual manage, regulate, and modulate one’s 
emotions  to  be  able  to  adapt  to  different  situations  and 
environments.

Courage and emotion regulation

Current findings support that courage plays a significant 
role in emotion regulation. While limited empirical stud-
ies  have  investigated  the  relationship  between  courage 
and  emotion  regulation  directly,  existing  literature  on 
courage in relation to resilience provides valuable insight. 
Courageous  individuals  willingly  confront  and  actively 
cope with life difficulties to achieve their goals in stress-
ful situations, and the ability to regulate emotions in such 
situations is critical for maintaining resilience. Therefore, 
courage  can  be  a  powerful  tool  in  helping  individuals 
regulate their emotions, and being courageous in the face 
of adversity requires emotional regulation to respond to 
challenging life circumstances in an adaptive manner.

Courage in counseling is often discussed in the context 
of  fear-related  emotion  regulation.  From  Adler  perspec-
tive, fear is central to inferiority and courage is the essen-
tial  component  required  to  overcome  inferiority  [45]. 
Adler [46] states that “a good compensation will be made 
only  where  there  are  courage  (p.16)…,  by  courage,  dis-
abilities  may  be  so  compensated  that  they  even  become 
great  abilities  (p.44).”  Recent  research  supports  the  idea 
that courage plays a significant role in psychological well-
being  through  emotion  regulation.  Magnano  et  al.  [47] 
found that people with higher levels of courage are better 
able  to  manage  emotions  like  fear  and  use  greater  cop-
ing skills, contributing to psychological well-being. Cour-
age  is  also  associated  with  life  satisfaction  [48],  elevated 
psychological capitals such as optimism, hope, and resil-
ience  [49,  50],  and  reduced  psychological  distress  [51]. 
Furthermore, with courage, individuals can acknowledge 

Kim et al. BMC Psychology           (2024) 12:11 Page 8 of 11

difficult  emotions  such  as  fear  and  anxiety  and  allow 
them  to  confront,  regulate,  and  process  these  emo-
tions  more  effectively,  instead  of  suppressing  or  avoid-
ing  them.  In  disability  and  health-related  study,  courage 
helps individuals cope with chronic illness and disability 
and overcome destructive habits as people gain the nec-
essary power to execute their will despite the fears asso-
ciated with CID [13]. In a nursing-related study, Norton 
and Weiss [52], courage is a trait that enables a nurse to 
regulate  fear  in  a  high-risk  emergency  that  requires  fast 
decisions critical to one’s life [53]. In a study on anxiety, 
courage,  and  resilience  among  nursing  students  caring 
for  COVID-19  patients,  the  researchers  found  a  signifi-
cant and indirect correlation between courage and resil-
iency [54].

Counseling implications

The  concept  of  emotion  regulation  encompasses  cogni-
tive  and  attentional  processes  that  facilitate  the  modu-
lation  of  emotional  states  in  response  to  life  challenges. 
Effective emotion regulation strategies may vary depend-
ing on the situation and can be adaptive or maladaptive 
for individuals. In the context of health-related counsel-
ing,  it  is  evident  that  emotional  dysregulation  contrib-
utes  to  reduced  mental  health  and  overall  quality  of  life 
in the face of life stressors. Factors such as instability in 
emotion  and  behavioral  regulation,  interpersonal  rela-
tionships,  and  self-image  have  been  identified  as  key 
contributors  [55].  Furthermore,  research  indicates  that 
maladaptive  emotion  regulation  strategies  may  increase 
the risk of chronic illness, such as chronic pain [56–58]. 
Notably,  maladaptive  emotion  regulation  patterns  are 
often  observed  in  individuals  on  the  autism  spectrum 
who have comorbid anxiety due to greater nonacceptance 
of emotions and difficulties with goal-directed behaviors 
[59].

The 

integration  of  emotion  regulation  strategies, 
including situational selection/modification, active emo-
tion  change,  emotion  acceptance,  attentional  deploy-
ment,  and  emotional  resilience,  emerges  as  a  valuable 
approach  in  assisting  individuals  to  manage  symptoms 
of  disabilities.  These  strategies  prove  beneficial  in  cop-
ing with negative emotions and stress associated with the 
adaptation  process.  A  randomized  controlled  trial  high-
lighted  the  efficacy  of  combined  exposure  therapy  with 
emotion-regulation  techniques  for  those  with  comorbid 
chronic  pain  and  emotional  issues.  This  approach  dem-
onstrated  greater  effectiveness  in  reducing  pain-related 
negative  thoughts,  depression,  and  the  impact  of  pain 
on  daily  activities  compared  to  a  Cognitive  Behavioral 
Therapy  (CBT)-based  guided  Internet  pain  manage-
ment program [60]. Moreover, the integration of emotion 
regulation  with  virtue  appears  to  facilitate  the  adapta-
tion  process  by  increasing  cognitive  diffusion,  informed 

situational  decisions,  goal-oriented  behavior,  and  com-
mitted  action.  This  holistic  approach  acknowledges  the 
interconnectedness  of  emotion  regulation  and  virtues 
in  promoting  overall  well-being  and  adaptive  coping 
mechanisms.

The  strong  association  of  emotion  regulation  with 
the  use  of  adaptive  coping  strategy  provides  important 
insight into the study of psychosocial adaptation to CID. 
Having CID often brings a unique task to shape an indi-
vidual’s  perspective  on  themselves,  their  health  condi-
tions,  and  their  way  of  interacting  with  environments 
in  the  context  of  disability.  Also,  it  often  leads  to  great 
changes across a variety of life domains and is frequently 
associated with a societal stigma and disadvantages. Con-
sequently, the process of psychosocial adaptation to CID 
can  be  a  demanding  and  stressful  process  that  requires 
major  emotional  regulation  and  coping  capacity  to 
adjust one’s attitudes, values, roles, and goals in changing 
environments  due  to  CID.  In  this  regard,  scholars  have 
highlighted  the  importance  of  coping  in  psychosocial 
adaptation  [61,  62].  Empirical  research  also  has  focused 
on  the  role  of  emotion  regulation  in  coping  behaviors 
and  provided  valuable  implications  on  how  emotion 
regulation  is  associated  with  adaptive  coping,  resilience, 
increased  psychosocial  functioning,  and  well-being  [63, 
64]. The current findings add empirical value to the body 
of  psychosocial  adaptation  research  by  identifying  how 
emotional regulation is associated with virtue.

In a recent qualitative study by McGee and colleagues 
[65],  the  expression  of  virtues  among  individuals  in  the 
early  stages  of  dementia  was  examined,  highlighting  a 
gap  in  the  literature  regarding  interventions  that  lever-
age these factors to address the psychological well-being 
of  persons  living  with  dementia.  The  study’s  findings 
suggest  that  virtues  such  as  transcendence,  wisdom, 
and  courage  play  essential  roles  in  improving  psychoso-
cial well-being. Within the framework of transcendence, 
religious  faith  was  found  to  assist  participants  in  navi-
gating  difficult  life  circumstances  and  overcoming  dev-
astating  emotions.  Additionally,  participants  viewed  the 
early stage of dementia as a positive opportunity for early 
intervention and management due to their awareness of 
the  heightened  risk  of  developing  the  disease  with  age. 
Finally,  participants  encouraged  themselves  by  actively 
engaging  in  programs  that  provided  specific  cognitive 
exercises. Overall, virtues can assist individuals in finding 
meaning and purpose in their lives, which they may have 
been searching for [65].

Counselors are able to better support people with dis-
abilities  on  emotion  regulation  by  understanding  their 
virtue  and  related  strengths.  Since  individuals  tend  to 
show different levels of ability to regulate their emotions 
based  on  their  virtues,  counselors  may  examine  clients’ 
virtue  to  understand  how  such  virtue  influences  their 

Kim et al. BMC Psychology           (2024) 12:11 Page 9 of 11

emotion regulation, which is closely related to their well-
being. For example, counselors can provide interventions 
by  assessing  how  clients  have  established  their  virtue 
(e.g., practical wisdom, integrity) and how they currently 
perceive  their  virtues  influencing  emotion  regulation. 
Such  exploration  may  promote  the  clients  to  develop 
their  virtues  as  strengths.  In  addition,  counselors  can 
offer more tailored interventions on how to better regu-
late emotion by understanding clients’ virtue.

Emotion  regulation  can  be  viewed  from  V-PAM  tran-
scendence  perspective.  Emotional  transcendence  is  a 
construct that describes the ability to rise above difficult 
circumstances  and  experience  positive  emotions  despite 
negative life events. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurologi-
cal  disorder,  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  a  person’s 
emotional well-being, leading to symptoms such as anxi-
ety,  depression,  and  mood  swings.  Individuals  with  MS 
may  face  a  range  of  challenges  and  stressors  related  to 
the  disease,  including  physical  symptoms,  social  isola-
tion,  and  uncertainty  about  the  future.  Emotional  tran-
scendence  may  allow  individuals  with  MS  to  cultivate  a 
sense  of  hope,  resilience,  and  positive  emotion,  even  in 
the face of these challenges. Some research has suggested 
that mindfulness-based interventions, which involve cul-
tivating present-moment awareness and non-judgmental 
acceptance of thoughts and emotions, may be helpful for 
individuals  with  MS  in  developing  emotional  transcen-
dence  and  improving  emotional  well-being.  Addition-
ally, social support and other forms of  therapy  may also 
be beneficial in promoting emotional transcendence and 
reducing  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression  [66,  67]. 
Although  more  research  is  needed  to  fully  understand 
the  relationship  between  emotional  transcendence  and 
emotional  regulation,  findings  of  the  present  study  war-
rant future study.

The present research suggests that virtue may serve as 
a  crucial  factor  for  intervention  in  promoting  the  psy-
chosocial  adaptation  of  individuals  with  disabilities  who 
face challenges and difficulties due to their disability sta-
tus.  Previous  research  has  shown  that  lack  of  emotional 
regulation is a significant predictor of maladaptive reac-
tions  to  life  adversities,  including  post-traumatic  symp-
toms,  addictive  behaviors,  and  clinical  mental  health 
symptoms.  In  this  regard,  the  current  study  proposes 
that practitioners can help consumers develop resilience 
by  focusing  on  the  various  virtues  within  themselves. 
Practitioners  can  use  standardized  assessment  tools, 
such  as  the  AIVS  [20],  to  identify  clients’  virtue  profiles 
and  provide  psychosocial  education  on  how  each  virtue 
can  enhance  emotional  regulation.  Engaging  consum-
ers in discussions about how their virtues can be used to 
overcome challenges provides a valuable opportunity for 
them to take an active role in their psychosocial adapta-
tion  process.  In  summary,  the  current  research  findings 

may  inform  the  practitioners  that  paying  attention  to 
consumers’  virtues  in  connection  with  emotional  regu-
lation  could  potentially  advance  the  implementation  of 
an  empowering  and  strength-based  service  approach  to 
facilitate the psychosocial adaptation of individuals with 
disabilities.

Conclusion
The  present  study  examined  emotion  regulation  from 
V-PAM  perspective.  V-PAM  explains  one’s  adaptation 
to  life  adversity  in  terms  of  five  virtues,  including  cour-
age  (i.e.,  ability  to  execute  will),  integrity  (i.e.,  ability  to 
hold on to values they think important but help an indi-
vidual  build  trust  with  others),  practical  wisdom  (i.e., 
ability  to  make  a  best  situational  decision),  committed 
action  (i.e.,  ability  to  deliver  long-term  constant  action), 
and  emotional  transcendence  (i.e.,  ability  to  transform 
adversity  experience  into  insight  and  renewal).  In  com-
parison  to  previous  findings  in  the  V-PAM  study,  the 
current  study  proposes  an  interesting  finding  relevant 
to  the  counseling  field.  When  V-PAM  was  examined  in 
relation  to  resilience  and  adaptation  to  chronic  illness 
and disability, committed action and emotional transcen-
dence  are  often  identified  as  the  strongest  contributors 
that  distinguish  resilience  and  adaptation  level.  Then, 
the  contributory  virtue  effect  may  vary  depending  on 
sample characteristics. For example, integrity, a measure 
of  social  connectedness  in  V-PAM,  was  an  important 
contributor to adolescents’ well-being while courage was 
more  important  than  practical  wisdom  and  integrity  in 
a  sample  of  college  students  [68].  However,  the  present 
study revealed that, when V-PAM was applied in the con-
text of one’s ability to control emotion, practical wisdom, 
integrity,  and  emotional  transcendence  were  stronger 
contributors  than  committed  action  and  courage  in  dif-
ferentiating emotion regulation. In that, practical wisdom 
and  transcendence  are  cognitive  and  emotional  factors 
and integrity is relational factor associated with life thriv-
ing in V-PAM, the results warrant future study concern-
ing relative importance of cognitive and social aspects of 
virtues in regulating one’s emotion.
