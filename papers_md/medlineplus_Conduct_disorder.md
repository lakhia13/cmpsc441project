Conduct disorder is a set of ongoing emotional and behavioral problems that occurs in children and teens. Problems may involve defiant or impulsive behavior, drug use, or criminal activity.

Conduct disorder has been linked to:

- Drugoralcoholuse in the parents

- Family conflicts

In the United States, the diagnosis is more common among men (12%) than women (7%).

Conduct disorder is often linked toattention-deficit disorder. The symptoms of conduct disorder also can be an early sign ofdepressionorbipolar disorder.

Children with conduct disorder tend to be impulsive, hard to control, and apparently not concerned about the feelings of other people.

Symptoms may include:

- Breaking rules without clear reason

- Cruel or aggressive behavior toward people or animals (for example: bullying, fighting, using dangerous weapons, forcing sexual activity, and stealing)

- Not going to school (truancy, beginning before age 13)

- Heavy alcohol or drug use

- Intentionally setting fires

- Lying to get a favor or avoid things they have to do

- Vandalizing or destroying property

These children often:

- Make no effort to hide their aggressive behaviors

- Lack guilt and empathy

- Don't care about their poor performance in school and work

- Don't express emotions

- Use false emotions for gains

- Have a hard time making real friends


## Exams and Tests


There is no real test for diagnosing conduct disorder. The diagnosis is made when a child or teen has a history of conduct disorder behaviors.

A physical exam and blood tests can help check for medical conditions that are similar to conduct disorder. In rare cases, a brain scan helps check for other disorders.

For treatment to be successful, it must be started early. The child's family also needs to be involved. Parents can learn techniques to help manage their child's problem behavior.

Some therapies used are:

- Parental management training (PMT)

- Functional family therapy

- Parenting- or school-based training

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

In cases of abuse, the child may need to be removed from the family and placed in a less chaotic or damaging home. Treatment with medicines or therapy may be used for symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, attention-deficit disorder, or other diagnosed conditions.

Many behavioral modification schools, wilderness programs, and boot camps are sold to parents as solutions for conduct disorder. There is no research to support these programs. Research does suggest that treating children at home, along with their families, is more effective.

Children who are diagnosed and treated early usually overcome their behavioral problems.


## Outlook (Prognosis)


Children who have severe or frequent symptoms and who are not able to complete treatment tend to have the poorest outlook.


## Possible Complications


Children with conduct disorder may go on to develop personality disorders as adults, particularlyantisocial personality disorder. As their behaviors worsen, these individuals may also develop problems with drug use and the law.

Depression and bipolar disorder may develop in the teen years and early adulthood. Suicide and violence toward others are also possible complications.


## When to Contact a Medical Professional


See a health care provider if your child:

- Regularly gets in trouble

- Has mood swings

- Is bullying others or cruel to animals

- Is being victimized

- Seems to be overly aggressive

Early treatment may help.

If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide or hurting others, call or text 988 or chat988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.

You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.

If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.

Always take suicide attempts and threats seriously.

The sooner treatment is started, the more likely the child will learn adaptive behaviors and avoid potential complications.
