Abstract: Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) are a distinct class of sleep disorders 
caused by alterations to the circadian time-keeping system, its entrainment mechanisms, or a mis-
match  between  the  endogenous  circadian  rhythm  and  the  external  environment.  The  main  clinical 
manifestations are insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness that often lead to clinically meaning-
ful distress or cause mental, physical, social, occupational, educational, or other functional impair-
ment.  CRSWDs  are  easily  mistaken  for  insomnia  or  early  waking  up,  resulting  in  inappropriate 
treatment.  CRSWDs  can  be  roughly  divided  into  two  categories,  namely,  intrinsic  CRSWDs,  in 
which sleep disturbances are caused by alterations to the endogenous circadian rhythm system due 
to chronic changes in the regulation or capture mechanism of the biological clock, and extrinsic cir-
cadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, in which sleep disorders, such as jet lag or shift-work disorder, 
result from environmental changes that cause a mismatch between sleep-wakefulness times and in-
ternal circadian rhythms. Sleep diaries, actigraphy, and determination of day and night phase mark-
ers (dim light melatonin onset and core body temperature minimum) have all become routine diag-
nostic methods for CRSWDs. Common treatments for CRSWD currently include sleep health edu-
cation, time therapy, light therapy, melatonin, and hypnotic drug therapy. Here, we review the pro-
gress in the epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of in-
trinsic  CRSWD,  with  emphasis  on  the  latter,  in  the  hope  of  bolstering  the  clinical  diagnosis  and 
treatment of CRSWDs. 

Keywords: Circadian rhythm, sleep-wake disorders, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, treatments, melatonin. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Biological  organisms  have  strict  organization  and  regu-
larity  in  time  and  space.  Molecules,  cells,  organs,  systems, 
and  behaviors  all  undergo  oscillating  changes  in  a  specific 
time  sequence,  called  the  biological  rhythm.  According  to 
the length of the cycle, the biological rhythm can be divided 
into  three  main  types,  namely,  infradian  rhythm,  ultradian 
rhythm,  and  circadian  rhythm.  The  latter  is  inherent  to  the 
body and has endogenous manifestations; consequently, un-
derstanding related disorders has become the focus of inten-
sive  research  [1].  The  circadian  rhythm,  also  referred  to  as 
the  near-24-hour  rhythm,  is  widespread  in  the  biological 
world, with most organisms exhibiting circadian rhythms of 
behavior and physiology. The circadian rhythm requires dai-
ly  adjustment  of  the  internal  clock  because  the  endogenous 
frequency of human physiological cycle oscillations is slight-
ly longer than 24 hours, which is not consistent with the 24-
hour  environmental  cycle.  This  coordination  is  achieved 
through  a  central  pacemaker  located  in  the  suprachiasmatic 
nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus [2].

sity,  Hefei  238000,  Anhui  Province,  P.R.  China;  Tel/Fax  :+86-551-

The  circadian  clock  system  plays  an  important  role  in 
maintaining physiological functions, including the sleep-wake 
cycle, body temperature, metabolism, and organ functions [3]. 
The sleep-wake cycle is the most prominent of these circadian 
behavioral functions. The confinement of sleep to the night or 
day  in  diurnal  and  nocturnal  species,  respectively,  is  directly 
controlled  by  the  SCN,  the  main  circadian  clock.  The  SCN 
projects  to  sleep-regulating  brain  regions,  such  as  the  ven-
trolateral  preoptic  nucleus,  the  lateral  hypothalamus,  and  the 
locus coeruleus, via the sub-paraventricular zone and the dor-
somedial hypothalamus [4]. The circadian clock subsequently 
regulates  sleep  timing,  leading  to  early  (lark)  and  late  (owl) 
chronotypes.  Clock  gene  polymorphisms  are  associated  with 
sleep disorders (e.g., delayed sleep phase disorder) [5-7]. Be-
sides sleep timing, the SCN clock also affects sleep architec-
ture; for example, REM sleep predominantly occurs during the 
nadir  of  the  SCN-controlled  circadian  rhythm  of  core  body 
temperature [8, 9]. 

The sleep and wake cycle is the classic example of circa-
dian rhythm systems, the generation, maintenance, and con-
solidation  of  which  depend  on  the  interaction  between  en-
dogenous  circadian  rhythms  and  processes  that  regulate  the 
homeostasis  of  the  internal  environment.  Internal  circadian 
rhythms  determine  the  amount  of  sleep,  while  homeostasis

generally determines the quality of sleep. When the two sys-
tems  are  in  a  state  of  balance,  the  individual  can  remain 
awake  for  a  long  time  during  the  day  (approximately  16 
hours) and maintain a long and stable sleep at night (approx-
imately 8 hours) [10]. Alterations to either of these process-
es, or to the interaction between them, can result in insomnia 
and (or) excessive sleepiness [11]. The International Classi-
fication of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3), released 
by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine in 2014, refers 
to  such  sleep  disorders  as  circadian  rhythm  sleep-wake  dis-
orders  (CRSWDs),  that  is,  sleep  disorders  that  occur  due  to 
disturbances  in  the  individual’s  own  circadian  rhythm  or 
those that arise due to inconsistencies between the latter and 
the external circadian rhythm. According to the ICSD-3 clas-
sification criteria, CRSWDs can be roughly divided into two 
categories:  one  is  caused  by  alterations  in  the  endogenous 
circadian  rhythm  system  resulting  from  chronic  changes  in 
the regulation or capture mechanism of the biological clock, 
while  the  other  results  from  a  mismatch  between  the  sleep-
wake  time  and  the  internal  circadian  rhythm  attributable  to 
environmental changes [12]. 

2. DATA SOURCES 

A  systematic  review  approach  was  utilised  to  provide  a 
comprehensive overview of existing research evidence about 
the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. 

A  comprehensive  search  strategy  was  conducted  in the 

PubMed database from its inception to 31 March 2021.  

The search strategy involved the primary keyword “Circa-
dian  rhythm”,“Sleep-wake  disorders”,  “Delayed  sleep-wake 
phase  disorder”,  “Advanced  sleep-wake  phase  disorder”, 
“Non-24-hour  sleep-wake  rhythm  disorder”,  “Irregular  sleep-
wake  rhythm  disorder”,  “Diagnostic  evaluation”,  “Treat-
ments” and the total yield is 724 papers. At the same time we 
also  reviewed  the  reference  lists  of  relevant  primary  papers 
and reviews to identify studies that may have been missed in 
the  search.  Finally,  119  articles were  adopted. Because  each 
section of the article has duplicate content, the specific number 
of papers cannot be determined for each section. 

3. DELAYED SLEEP-WAKE PHASE DISORDER 

3.1. Definition  

Delayed  sleep-wake  phase  disorder  (DSWPD),  also 
called  delayed  sleep  phase  syndrome,  is  a  common  form  of 
CRSWD.  It  is  mainly  manifested  as  a  delay  in  an  individu-
al’s  sleep  onset  and  wake  time  of  2  hours  or  more  beyond 
what  is  considered  ideal  and  compared  with  a  normal  indi-
vidual  [13].  DSWPD  can  lead  to  sleep-onset  insomnia  at 
night  or  difficulty  waking  up  in  the  morning.  Individuals 
with this disorder exhibit significant daytime functional (e.g., 
excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, low mood) and cogni-
tive  (e.g.,  concentration,  memory,  and  attention)  impair-
ments. However, when their sleep schedules are not restrict-
ed by social requirements, they show normal sleep structure 
and sleep duration [5]. 

3.2. Epidemiology 

As the overall prevalence of DSWPD varies according to 
the  type  of  population  being  evaluated,  its  exact  prevalence 

is  unclear.  In  an  early  study  encompassing  10,000  Norwe-
gian adults aged 18–67 years, the prevalence was found to be 
0.17%, with an average age of onset of 15.4 years [14]. In an 
epidemiological study based on Japanese students, the preva-
lence of DSWPD was estimated to be 0.48%, without gender 
differences.  Moreover,  in  universities,  DSWPD  prevalence 
was  reported  to  be  higher  among  senior  students  (1.66%) 
than junior students (0.09%) [15]. In a large-scale population 
study  conducted  in  Hordaland  County  in  Norway  in  2012, 
the  prevalence  of  DSWPD  among  10,220  adolescents  aged 
16–18  years  (54%  girls)  was  3.3%  and  was  significantly 
higher among girls (3.7%) than boys (2.7%) [16]. In a recent 
population study of adults in New Zealand, the prevalence of 
sleep delay types ranged from 1.5% to 8.9%, declining with 
age [17]. 

3.3. Etiology  

The  exact  etiology  of  DSWPD  is  unknown,  and  many 
factors  are  thought  to  contribute  to  its  development,  includ-
ing  genetic,  environmental,  and  behavioral  factors.  Approx-
imately  40%  of  DSWPD  patients  have  a  family  history  of 
CRSD or sleep phase delay. It has been reported to be inher-
ited in an autosomal dominant manner and is strongly asso-
ciated with mutations in period circadian regulator 3 (PER3) 
and other clock genes [5]. A recent study further showed that 
the  inheritance  of  DSWPD  is  associated  with  a  dominant 
coding  variation  in  the  core  circadian  clock  gene  crypto-
chrome 1 (CRY1), which produces a transcriptional inhibitor 
with an enhanced affinity for the rhythm-activating proteins 
CLOCK  and  BMAL1.  This  allele  is  found  in  0.6%  of  the 
population  and  may  play  an  important  role  in  DSWPD  by 
lengthening the circadian period [18]. Environmental factors, 
including a lack of daylight in the morning and an increase in 
light  exposure  at  night,  are  thought  to  contribute  to  the  de-
velopment of delayed sleep stage types [19]. Behavioral fac-
tors  such  as  night-shift  work,  excessive  caffeine  consump-
tion, poor sleeping habits, reduced amounts of morning light, 
or  heavy  exposure  to  bright  lights  or  electronic  screens  at 
night  can  also  cause  a  shift  in  sleep  patterns  [20].  Auger  et 
al. showed that people with DSWPD received more light at 
night and less in the morning compared with unaffected con-
trols. The authors further suggested that DSWPD individuals 
may have a behavioral tendency to avoid light in the morn-
ing [21]. Additionally, recent studies have highlighted that a 
causal relationship may exist between DSWPD and individ-
ual personality characteristics [22]. 

3.4. Diagnostic Evaluation 

rhythm  marker  measurement, 

The  diagnosis  of  DSWPD  is  mainly  based  on  clinical 
symptoms. The assessment tools that can be used to diagnose 
DSWPD in the clinic include sleep diaries, actigraphy, circa-
dian 
the  morningness-
eveningness  questionnaire  (MEQ),  and  polysomnography 
(PSG),  each  with  its  strengths  and  weaknesses.  The  sleep 
diary  can  record  some  of  the  patient’s  sleep  parameters,  in-
cluding when lights are turned out when the patient goes to 
bed, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and wake time in 
the morning and wake up in the morning to objectively eval-
uate the patient’s sleep [12]. In addition, the sleep diary can 
contain  subjective  data  about  daytime  functions  (such  as 
fatigue  and  drowsiness)  and  factors  that  can  affect  sleep 
(such  as  drug  use,  alcohol,  and  caffeine  intake)  to  allow  a 

1024    Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 6 

Sun and Chen 

full understanding of the factors affecting the patient’s sleep-
wake  time.  However,  this  tool  is  not  suitable  for  use  with 
patients that cannot complete the sleep diary, such as elderly 
people  with  cognitive  impairment  [23].  An  actigraph,  com-
monly  worn  on  the  patient’s  wrist,  records  the  patient’s  ac-
tivities and light exposure, supplementing the objective data 
of the sleep diary. Both activities and light exposure are rec-
orded  for  at  least  7  consecutive  days,  preferably  14  days, 
including both working and non-working days [24]. For the 
determination  of  circadian  rhythm  markers,  the  most  com-
monly used method is the measurement of the timing of dim 
light melatonin onset (DLMO); however, the cost and burden 
of collecting DLMO data significantly limits the use of this 
method in many clinical settings [25]. The MEQ can also be 
used to assess whether an individual’s sleep habits conform 
to  a  morning-type  or  a  night-type  preference;  however,  its 
clinical  value  is  yet  to  be  evaluated  [26].  DSWPD  is  often 
misdiagnosed  as  chronic  insomnia  due  to  problems  with 
sleep initiation. Unlike insomniacs, however, when DSWPD 
patients are allowed to sleep as they wish, the sleep structure 
will be basically the same as that of the normal population of 
the  same  age  group.  In  such  cases,  PSG  can  be  selectively 
used as an evaluation method for DSWPD but is not done so 
routinely [12]. 

3.5. Diagnostic Criteria 

The diagnosis of DSWPD requires that the following five 

main criteria are met [12]:  

1)  There  is  a  significant  delay  in  the  phase  of  the  major 
sleep episode in relation to the desired or required sleep on-
set time and wake-up time, as evidenced by a chronic or re-
current complaint by the patient or a caregiver of the inabil-
ity  to  fall  asleep  and  difficulty  awakening  at  a  desired  or 
required clock time; 2) the symptoms are present for at least 
3  months;  3)  when  patients  are  allowed  to  choose  their 
schedule ad libitum, they will exhibit improved sleep quality 
and duration and maintain a delayed phase of the 24-h sleep-
wake pattern; 4) sleep logs and, whenever possible, actigra-
phy monitoring for at least 7 days (preferably 14 days) con-
sisting  of  work/school  days  and  free  days,  demonstrate  a 
delay  in  the  timing  of  the  habitual  sleep  period;  and  5)  the 
sleep  disturbance  is  not  better  explained  by  another  current 
sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental dis-
order, medication use, or substance use disorder. 

3.6. Treatments 

If the sleep pattern of the patient is consistent with their 
work  or  social  time,  treatment  is  unnecessary.  The  overall 
goal  of  DSWPD  treatment  is  to  readjust  the  biological 
rhythm  to  the  ideal  24-hour  day/night  cycle.  The  current 
main treatment methods for DSWPD are shown in Table 1. 

3.6.1. Melatonin Treatment 

Melatonin  is  a  “darkness  signal”  secreted  by  the  pineal 
gland  and  serves  as  an  endogenous  zeitgeber  that  regulates 
the circadian rhythm of certain physiological functions of the 
body, thereby promoting sleep. Melatonin secretion is higher 
during  the  night  than  in  the  morning  or  in  the  light.  Using 
melatonin  at  the  right  time  can  change  the  sleep  cycle  [27, 
28].  Rahman  et  al.  reported  that  the  administration  of  5  mg 
of  melatonin  to  patients  with  DSWPD  and  depression  for  4 

weeks  significantly  reduced  their  depressive  symptoms  and 
improved  sleep  [29].  Nagtegaal  et  al.  undertook  a  placebo, 
double-blind cross-over trial on 30 patients, and found that 5 
mg melatonin administration could advance the endogenous 
melatonin secretion time by 1.5 hours. PSG analysis indicat-
ed that the sleep onset time of patients was advanced, and the 
sleep  latency  was  shortened;  in  contrast,  the  sleep  structure 
was not affected. During the treatment, the clarity of patients 
after  waking  up  in  the  morning  was  significantly  improved, 
as was their quality of life [30]. Similarly, in 2010, a meta-
analysis  of  the  effects  of  melatonin  on  DSWPD  by 
Geijlswijk  and  colleagues  showed  that  melatonin  treatment 
advanced  the  secretion  of  endogenous  melatonin  by  1.18 
hours on average, reduced sleep onset latency by 23 minutes, 
and advanced sleep onset time by 0.67 hours. Moreover, the 
authors  recommended  that  small  doses  (0.3~5.0  mg)  of 
melatonin should be given 3–6 hours before DLMO to avoid 
high  melatonin  levels  late  at  night  or  early  in  the  morning 
[31]. A recent study showed that 0.5 mg of melatonin com-
bined with behavioral wake-up scheduling can advance sleep 
onset  time,  improve  sleep  quality,  and  reduce  sleep-related 
disorders and daytime dysfunction. This was the largest pla-
cebo-controlled  trial  to  date  evaluating  the  clinical  efficacy 
of  melatonin  in  improving  sleep  initiation  and  sleep  quality 
in DSWPD [32]. Unfortunately, if melatonin is stopped, pa-
tients  with  DSWPD  may  experience  a  recurrence  of  symp-
toms  [33,  34],  the  time  of  recurrence  being  related  to  the 
severity of the preconditioning circadian rhythm delay [35]. 
Recently, a statement from the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine highlighted the lack of available melatonin-related 
evidence regarding CRSD treatment. A systematic review of 
existing  research  indicated  that  melatonin  given  to  children 
and  adolescents  to  treat  DSWPD  elicited  only  moderate  ef-
fects when administered alone [36]. In general, melatonin is 
well  tolerated  and  has  few  side  effects,  the  most  commonly 
reported  being  headache  and  nasopharyngitis.  Nevertheless, 
owing to a lack of safety data, melatonin should be avoided 
during  pregnancy  and  breastfeeding,  and  should  also  be  ad-
ministered with caution in patients with liver injury. To date, 
no  serious  adverse  reactions  to  melatonin  administration 
have been reported. Two observational, long-term studies on 
children and adolescents (average follow-up of 4 years) also 
did not document any safety issues [37, 38]. 

Several  studies  have  evaluated  the  combined  effects  of 
light  and  melatonin.  In  one  study,  subjects  took  0.5  mg  of 
melatonin 5 hours before bedtime and received 30 minutes, 1 
hour,  or  2  hours  of  intense  light  (5,000  lux).  Subjects  ex-
posed to strong light for 2 hours showed the greatest advance 
in  sleep  onset  time  (2.4  hours  vs.  1.7  and  1.8  hours  for  the 
30-minutes and 1-hour groups, respectively) [39]. Similarly, 
in  another  study,  melatonin  was  administered  5.75  hours 
before the habitual bedtime, and 3,000 lux of intensive light 
was given 3 hours before the habitual waking up time, with 
the results showing that bright light plus melatonin was more 
effective than either treatment alone [40]. 

3.6.2. Chronotherapy 

First reported by Czeisler and colleagues, chronotherapy 
is a method used to reset the circadian rhythms and thereby 
restore the normal circadian clock in DSWPD patients [41]. 
The strategy involves gradually postponing their time to fall

asleep until the sleep-wake time is consistent with the tradi-
tional social schedule. Specifically, the patient is required to 
postpone  going  to  bed  or  getting  up  for  3  hours,  and  then 
postponing it again for another 3 hours every 2~5 days until 
the  ideal  sleep  schedule  is  reached;  subsequently,  this  sleep 
schedule  should  be  strictly  followed.  One  case  report  on  5 
adults  with  DSWPD  (age:  24–37  years)  [41]  and  a  study 
involving adolescents with subclinical DSWPD have shown 
that  this  method  elicits  positive  results  [42];  however,  no 
randomized  controlled  trial  has  been  undertaken  to  date  to 
evaluate the efficacy of time therapy on DSWPD patients. A 
large number of small studies have also reported on the suc-
cess of time-varying therapy, which seems to be well tolerat-
ed  in  typical  DSWPD  patients  [41,  43,  44].  Nevertheless, 
chronotherapy  is  widely  thought  to  be  impractical  as  it  re-
quires  a  significant  time  commitment  by  the  patient  and  is 
not  constrained  by  external environmental conditions  during 
the  treatment.  One  study  reported  that  DSWPD  developed 
into  free-running  CRSWDs  in  one  patient  following  the 
sleep scheduling intervention [45]. 

3.6.3. Photic Treatment 

Light  is  a  zeitgeber  of  circadian  rhythms.  Studies  have 
found  that  light  interventions  can  alter  the  phase  of  the 
body’s circadian rhythm and change its direction and ampli-
tude  according  to  time,  intensity,  spectral  properties,  and 
duration of the light signal [46–48]. Studies have also shown 
that morning light can advance, while evening light or light 
before  bedtime  can  delay  the  phase  of  the  circadian  rhythm 
[49].  The  effect  of  light  is  related  to  its  intensity  and  dura-
tion. Additionally, attention should be paid to individualiza-
tion  in  clinical  application.  A  phase  response  curve  (PRC) 
has  been  generated  to  describe  the  magnitude  and  direction 
of  the  phase  shift  of  the  circadian  rhythm  according  to  the 
time, duration, and intensity of light exposure [49]. It is dif-
ficult to estimate the optimal time of light exposure based on 
the habitual sleep-wake time because the timing of the core 
body temperature minimum (CBTmin) has a large degree of 
interindividual  variability  relative  to  the  time  of  the  sleep-

wake  cycle  [25].  Consequently,  a  circadian  rhythm  assess-
ment  should  be  undertaken  before  light  treatment  to  ensure 
the  best  results.  According  to  the  light  PRC,  light  has  the 
greatest  phase-advancing  effect  when  administered  shortly 
after  CBTmin  [50,  51].  Because  the  best  source  of  light  is 
natural  light,  patients  are  usually  allowed  to  be  exposed  to 
sunlight  for  30  minutes  in  the  morning  after  waking  up. 
When  this  is  not  possible,  sitting  next  to  a  well-lit  window 
will  be  the  most  effective.  In  the  winter  months,  or  for  pa-
tients  who  do  not  have  access  to  outdoor  light,  artificial 
bright light therapy can be used, and a variety of light boxes 
are  available  for  this  purpose  [52].  The  effects  of  treating 
DSWPD with different light wavelengths was recently eval-
uated,  with  early  morning  blue  light  (light-emitting  diode, 
470-nm  peak  wavelength,  irradiance  =  65  µW/cm2)  being 
found to exert a better effect on increasing the secretion time 
of endogenous melatonin and changing the waking up time, 
but  not  the  sleep  onset  time  [53].  An  effective  method  for 
avoiding  light  at  nightfall  or  in  the  evening  may  be  to  in-
struct patients to wear blue light-filtering goggles or glasses 
with amber lenses from sunset to bedtime [54]. The side ef-
fects of most light therapies (eye irritation, nausea, headache, 
dizziness, and excitement) are fairly mild and usually disap-
pear over time. For patients with glaucoma, macular degen-
eration,  cataracts,  or  diabetes-related  eye  conditions,  light 
therapy may need to be performed under the guidance of an 
ophthalmologist [52]. 

3.6.4. Cognitive-behavioral Therapy 

Adverse treatment results or recurrence are common after 
various  DSWPD  treatment  programs  [55,  56].  The  overlap 
between  DSWPD  and  insomnia  is  large,  especially  when 
patients try to go to bed earlier [16]. Consequently, interven-
tions  for  insomnia,  such  as  cognitive-behavioral  therapy 
(CBT),  may  also  affect  the  sleep  delay  of  DSWPD  patients 
[57].  Studies  have  shown  that  adolescents  diagnosed  with 
CRSD  have  many  symptoms  of  cognitive  insomnia  [58]. 
Moreover, recent studies have reported that the combination 
of CBT and phototherapy has produced better long-term ef-

 
1026    Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 6 

Sun and Chen 

ficacy for adolescents and young patients with DSWPD [59, 
60].  This  suggests  that  patients  with  DSWPD  may  benefit 
from CBT for insomnia. Nevertheless, many issues remain to 
be  resolved  regarding  CBT  treatment  for  DSWPD,  such  as 
the number of treatment courses, how experienced the thera-
pist should be, and the form of treatment. More clinical trials 
are  needed  to  evaluate  and  perhaps  improve  the  efficacy  of 
CBT in the treatment of DSWPD. 

3.6.5. Other Treatments 

Aripiprazole  (APZ)  is  a  second-generation  antipsychotic 
drug  that  acts  as  a  partial  agonist  of  both  D2  and  seroto-
ninergic  5-HT1A  receptors  and  as  an  antagonist  of  5-HT2A 
receptors  [61].  Depression  is  the  most  common  mental  ill-
ness  associated  with  DSWPD  [62],  and  low-dose  APZ  is 
reported  to  be  effective  as  an  adjunct  therapy  in  major  de-
pression  [63].  In  addition,  low-dose  APZ  can  prolong  the 
total  sleep  time  (TST)  and  advance  the  sleep-wake  phase 
[64].  These  observations  indicate  that  this  drug  will  likely 
become  a  new  treatment  option  for  patients  with  DSWPD. 
Several  studies  have  shown  that  nocturnal  exercise  delays 
the circadian rhythm of the human body [65-67]. This find-
ing may have particular relevance for many adolescents, and 
young people who undertake physical activities such as part-
time work, exercise, and social activities before going to bed, 
as doing so may increase their risk of DSWPD. Other treat-
ment  options,  such  as  health  education  and  behavior  guid-
ance, will also reduce the delay of the circadian rhythm. It is 
recommended to patients that they reduce their bad sleeping 
habits (such as using electronic devices in bed and drinking 
alcohol or coffee after 16:00 hours) and develop good sleep 
habits (e.g., go to bed when sleepy) [68, 69]. 

4. ADVANCED SLEEP-WAKE PHASE DISORDER  

4.1. Definition  

Advanced  sleep-wake  phase  disorder  (ASWPD),  also 
known as advanced sleep phase syndrome, is a relatively rare 
circadian rhythm sleep disorder. It is mainly manifested in an 
individual’s main sleep period, during which sleep onset and 
wake  times  usually  occur  at  least  2  hours  earlier  than  the 
societal  norm  compared  with  normal  individuals  [70].  Pa-
tients with ASWPD usually fall asleep from between 6 and 9 
in  the  evening  and  wake  up  from  between  2  and  5  in  the 
morning. The main complaints include drowsiness and diffi-
culty  in  staying  awake  in  the  evening,  waking  up  before 
dawn, and difficulty falling asleep after waking up often re-
ferred  to  as  the  “nightingale”  chronotype  [71].  Unlike  other 
sleep  maintenance  disorders,  early  morning  awakenings  oc-
cur  after  a  normal  period  of  undisturbed  sleep,  that  is,  the 
sleep  cycle  is  normal  for  the  age.  In  addition,  unlike  exces-
sive  sleepiness  due  to  other  reasons,  the  daytime  work  or 
learning ability of people with this disorder is not affected by 
sleepiness.  However,  because  affected  people  fall  asleep 
much earlier than what is considered normal, activities in the 
evening are usually shortened [12]. 

4.2. Epidemiology 

The  prevalence  of  ASWPD  is  much  lower  than  that  of 
DSWPD, possibly because ASWPD has little impact on day-
time  functioning,  learning,  work,  and  social  activities,  such 

that  patients  rarely  seek  medical  advice.  The  prevalence  of 
ASWPD  is  estimated  to  vary  from  1%  to  7%  according  to 
the different populations evaluated, while the overall preva-
lence is higher in men and the elderly [17]. A large survey of 
a  middle-aged  and  elderly  population  (40~64  years  old) 
showed  that  the  prevalence  of  ASWPD  was  approximately 
1%, and increased with age; however, no gender differences 
were  found  [72].  In  a  multi-center  survey  of  9,000  elderly 
people  aged  65  years  and  older,  early  waking  was  reported 
by 20% of participants [73]. 

4.3. Etiology  

The  etiology  of  ASWPD  is  unclear.  In  recent  years,  nu-
merous studies have reported that ASWPD has a strong her-
itability  component.  Familial  studies  have  suggested  that  it 
displays an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, while 
one variant of ASWPD has been associated with a mutation 
in the circadian clock gene PER2 [74]. Familial ASWPD has 
been  reported  to  result  in  a  shorter  circadian  rhythm  cycle, 
leading to an earlier circadian rhythm [75]. Mutations in the 
casein kinase I delta gene (CKIδ) have also been reported to 
lead to a shorter physiological cycle [76]. A missense muta-
tion  in  the  human  cryptochrome  2  (CRY2)  gene  was  also 
identified  in  a  study  on  familial  ASWPD  [77].  In  addition, 
behavioral  factors  may  also  play  a  role.  If  an  individual  re-
ceives less light in the afternoon or evening, or is premature-
ly  exposed  to  morning  light  following  early  awakening,  the 
circadian  rhythm  can  be  advanced,  leading  to  an  increased 
risk of an early sleep phase [78]. 

4.4. Diagnostic Evaluation 

The  diagnosis  of  ASWPD  is  mainly  based  on  clinical 
symptoms. A sleep diary and actigraphy are two established 
methods  for  determining  ASWPD.  Both  methods  should 
record  at  least  7  consecutive  days  (including  rest  days),  but 
preferably 14 days [79]. The MEQ can provide further diag-
nostic value for ASWPD, with most patients presenting with 
ASWPD being rated as "early morning type" [80]. Determin-
ing  the  timing  of  DLMO,  a  circadian  rhythm  marker,  can 
identify an advance in the circadian rhythm phase, especially 
in  cases  of  familial  ASWPD  [80].  When  it  is  necessary  to 
distinguish between ASWPD and other types of sleep disor-
ders, a PSG examination can be performed. If the patient is 
allowed  to  sleep  according  to  his  wishes,  the  PSG  results 
show  a  normal  sleep  structure.  If  the  patient  is  required  to 
sleep on the traditional sleep schedule, however, PSG results 
show that the sleep latency is shortened while both TST and 
rapid eye movement sleep are reduced. PSG is not currently 
used as a routine diagnostic method for ASWPD [12]. 

4.5. Diagnostic Criteria 

The diagnosis of ASWPD requires that the following five 
main  criteria  are  met  [12]:  1)  There  is  an  advance  (occurs 
earlier) in the phase of the major sleep episode in relation to 
the  desired  or  required  sleep  onset  and  wake-up  times,  as 
evidenced  by  a  chronic  or  recurrent  complaint  of  difficulty 
staying awake until the required or desired conventional bed-
time,  together  with  an  inability  to  remain  asleep  until  the 
required  or  desired  time  for  awakening;  2)  symptoms  are 
present for at least 3 months; 3) when patients are allowed to 
sleep in accordance with their internal biological clock, sleep 

Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake Disorders 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 6    1027 

quality  and  duration  are  improved  with  a  consistent  but  ad-
vanced timing of the major sleep episode; 4) sleep logs and, 
whenever possible, actigraphy monitoring for at least 7 days 
(preferably  14  days),  including  work/school  days  and  free 
days,  demonstrate  a  stable  advance  in  the  timing  of  the  ha-
bitual sleep period; and 5) the sleep disturbance is not better 
explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neu-
rologic  disorder,  mental  disorder,  medication  use,  or  sub-
stance use disorder. 

4.6. Treatments 

The treatment recommendations are shown in Table 1. 

4.6.1. Melatonin Treatment 

In  theory,  melatonin  can  delay  the  circadian  rhythm 
phase, which can delay the sleep onset time of patients with 
ASWPD. According to the melatonin PRC, to delay the cir-
cadian rhythm phase of ASWPD, melatonin should be given 
in the early morning. However, there is a lack of clinical data 
and  information  regarding  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of 
melatonin  [81].  In  addition,  melatonin  has  a  sedative  and 
hypnotic  effect,  so  taking  melatonin  in  the  morning  may 
make  it  difficult  to  stay  awake,  making  it  more  difficult  for 
individuals to stick to the scheduled sleep and wake-up times 
[82].  Accordingly,  the  American  Medical  Association  does 
not currently recommend taking melatonin or melatonin ag-
onists in the morning to treat ASWPD [36]. The side effects 
of melatonin at low doses (0.5~5.0 mg), which include head-
ache, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness, are often mild [83]. 

4.6.2. Chronotherapy 

The  purpose  of  chronotherapy  is  to  reschedule  the  rest 
schedule.  The  time  to  fall  asleep  and  get  up  is  gradually 
shifted  backward,  i.e.,  the  sleep  onset  time  is  delayed  by  3 
hours every 2 days until the sleep time is consistent with the 
desired  later  bedtime.  In  one  case  study  in  which  a  patient 
with  ASWPD  was  instructed  to  go  to  bed  3  hours  earlier 
every 2 days until reaching the goal of falling asleep at 23:00 
hours, the 5-month follow-up after treatment showed that the 
patient could maintain a bedtime of 23:00 hours and a wak-
ing  up  time  of  07:00  hours.  Notably,  this  patient  had  mild 
obstructive sleep apnea, but did not specify whether or not it 
had  been  treated.  Having  this  information  would  have  been 
very useful for fully understanding the effect of chronothera-
py treatment. Further studies are needed to support the use of 
time therapy for the treatment of ASWPD [44]. 

4.6.3. Phototherapy 

The  occurrence  of  ASWPD  is  related  to  the  early  phase 
of  melatonin  secretion.  Consequently,  exposure  to  bright 
light every night can delay the phase of melatonin secretion, 
thereby  delaying  sleep.  Phototherapy  is  usually  performed 
between  19:00~21:00  hours,  which  can  improve  sleep  effi-
ciency  and  delay  the  circadian  rhythm  [84].  However,  the 
intensity of the light applied is currently not uniform across 
studies. A patient was given 2,500 lux of bright light irradia-
tion at night and continued treatment for 17 months such that 
the sleep phase returned completely to normal, an effect that 
could  subsequently  be  maintained  by  only  sporadic  bright 
light  application  [85].  The  latest  AASM  guideline  recom-
mends  the  use  of  night  bright  light  therapy  in  the  treatment 
of  ASWPD  [36].  To  delay  the  circadian  rhythm  time,  it  is 

recommended  that  individuals  are  exposed  to  at  least  5,000 
lux of bright light at night for 2 hours [86]. Multiple studies 
have  shown  that  the  circadian  rhythm  phase  is  delayed  in 
elderly  patients  exposed  to  bright  light  at  night;  however, 
these  patients  reported  that  they  could  not  tolerate  light, 
which resulted in poor compliance [87, 88]. Palmer and col-
leagues  found  that  compared  with  patients  receiving  en-
hanced  intensity  bright  light  treatment  in  the  evening,  those 
who received dim light treatment were more compliant, and 
their symptoms also improved [88]. The side effects of pho-
totherapy,  which  include  eye  fatigue,  nausea,  restlessness, 
and headaches, are minimal and usually disappear spontane-
ously [89, 90]. 

4.6.4. Other Treatments 

Health education and behavioral guidance can be given to 
patients, including the avoidance of bright light in the morn-
ing,  taking  a  nap  at  noon,  trying  to  postpone  bedtime  at 
night,  performing  physical  activities,  and  walking  in  the 
evening  under  bright  light.  Any  possible  anxiety  or  frustra-
tion should be treated. In addition, no study has assessed the 
use  of  hypnotic  drugs  and  CBT  as  adjuvant  therapy  for 
ASWPD. 

5.  NON-24-HOUR  SLEEP-WAKE  RHYTHM  DISOR-
DER  

5.1. Definition  

Non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), al-
so known as free-running type sleep disorder, over 24 hours 
of  sleep-wake  syndrome,  or  non-induced  sleep-wake  syn-
drome, is a type of sleep disorder characterized by a chronic 
and  stable  sleep-wake  pattern  [12].  The  characteristics  are 
mainly the long-term, constant l–2-h delay in the time to fall 
asleep and awaken, which cannot be disrupted or affected by 
a  natural  and  social  exogenous  24-h  cycle.  When  a  patient 
tries  to  follow  the  traditional  sleep-wake  time,  insomnia, 
daytime  sleepiness,  or  both  will  occur;  however,  when  the 
patient’s  sleep-wake  time  is  consistent  with  the  light  and 
dark  cycle  and  social  activities,  the  sleep  quality  and  dura-
tion are normal [91]. Consequently, the patient may alternate 
between  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  phases.  When  the 
patient  tries  to  establish  a  consistent,  traditional  sleep–
awakening time for reasons of study or social activities, they 
have  to  force  themselves  to  awaken  from  the  sleep  phase 
(sleep deprivation). Over time, this will aggravate the symp-
toms of insomnia or daytime sleepiness, leading to the occur-
rence  of  physical  symptoms  such  as  dizziness,  headache, 
fatigue,  and  emotional  disturbances,  such  as  cognitive  im-
pairment. 

5.2. Epidemiology 

N24SWD  is  very  rare  in  the  general  population  and  is 
more  common  in  blind  people.  It  is  estimated  that  approxi-
mately 50% of blind people have N24SWD, while 70% have 
chronic  sleep  disorders;  thus,  N24SWD  is  also  called  blind 
sleep  patterns  [92].  A  questionnaire  survey  on  the  sleep 
problems of blind people found that sleep problems are more 
frequent  in  blind  people  than  in  sighted  people  (83%  vs. 
57%),  while  18%  of  blind  people  exhibit  a  periodic  pattern 
of  sleep-wake  disturbance  compared  with  8%  for  sighted 
people  [93].  The  onset  of  N24SWD  does  not  occur  only 

1028    Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 6 

Sun and Chen 

when vision is lost. N24SWD may also occur in individuals 
with  congenital  blindness  and  adults  with  complete  vision 
loss,  sometimes  after  many  years.  In  a  large  case  series  of 
sighted people with N24SWD (57), 72% were men, and most 
first showed symptoms in their teens or twenties. Similar to 
DSWPD patients, those with N24SWD seem to have greater 
comorbidity  of  psychiatric  disorders,  with  28%  displaying 
premorbid  mental  disorders  before  N24SWD  symptom  on-
set, and another 34% exhibiting symptoms of severe depres-
sion  after  the  appearance  of  N24SWD  symptoms  [91].  In  a 
recent study investigating blind female patients with or with-
out light perception, the incidence of N24SWD was reported 
to be as high as 63% [94]. Little is known about the preva-
lence of N24SWD in children or adolescents, and its natural 
process has not been described. 

5.3. Etiology 

N24SWD  patients  without  light  perception  may  show  a 
completely free-running endogenous circadian rhythm due to 
a lack of light zeitgeber input into the SCN [91]. Important-
ly,  if  blindness  is  due  only  to  an  outer  retinal  (cones  and 
rods)  disease  and  the  function  of  the  photosensitive  retinal 
ganglion  cells  and  the  hypothalamic  pathway  of  the  retina 
are still preserved, the circadian rhythm can still be synchro-
nized with the outside environment [95]. This explains why 
not all blind people have N24SWD. However, the pathogen-
esis of N24SWD in sighted patients remains unclear. Possi-
ble  reasons  include  reduced  light  exposure,  reduced  sensi-
tivity  to  light,  or  reduced  social  and  physical  activity.  An 
abnormal  sleep-wake  rhythm  can  be  induced  or  aggravated 
by changes in sleep habits (night-shift work, unemployment), 
social  isolation,  and  physiological  factors  that  cause  behav-
ioral  changes.  Several  studies  have  found  that  patients  with 
mental  illness  (such  as  depression  or  personality  disorder) 
can  still  develop  N24SWD  due  to  social  time  suggestive 
factors change or eliminate [91]. 

5.4. Diagnostic Evaluation  

The diagnostic criteria for N24SWD mainly include sleep 
disturbance, daytime symptoms, and disruptions in work and 
daily  life.  Patients  may  present  different  main  complaints 
that range from insomnia or early waking to excessive day-
time  sleepiness.  A  detailed  medical  history,  a  sleep  diary, 
and actigraphy are essential for diagnosis. A sleep diary and 
actigraphy covering 14 days can show that a patient’s sleep-
wake rhythm cycle is prolonged daily, representing a lack of 
stability  between  the  patient’s  sleep-wake  cycle  and  the  24-
hour light-dark cycle [12]. In addition, the continuous meas-
urement of DLMO as a circadian rhythm marker can indicate 
a change in DLMO timing over time can also help N24SWD 
diagnosis  [80].  MEQ  has 
little  application  value  for 
N24SWD, while PSG is mainly used for differential diagno-
sis and the elimination of other types of sleep disorders, not 
as a routine examination. 

5.5. Diagnostic Criteria 

The  diagnosis  of  N24SWD  requires  that  the  following 
four  main  criteria  are  met  [12]:  1)  There  is  a  history  of  in-
somnia,  hypersomnia,  or  both,  which  alternate  with  asymp-
tomatic  episodes,  due  to  misalignment  between  the  24-h 
light-dark cycle and the non-entrained, endogenous circadian 
rhythm of sleep-wake propensity; 2) symptoms persist for at 

least 3 months; 3) daily sleep logs and actigraphy for at least 
14  days,  preferably  longer  for  blind  people,  demonstrate  a 
pattern  of  sleep  onset  and  wake  times  that  typically  delay 
each day, with a circadian period that is usually longer than 
24 h; 4) the sleep disturbance is not better explained by an-
other  current  sleep  disorder,  medical  or  neurological  disor-
der, mental disorder, medication use, or substance use disor-
der. 

5.6. Treatments 

The  purpose  of  N24SWD  treatment  is  to  reconstruct  a 
stable 24-hour sleep-wake rhythm consistent with the exter-
nal  environment,  thereby  improving  sleep  quality  and  day-
time function. The recommendations for N24SWD treatment 
depend  on  the  light  perception  of  the  patient  (Table  1).  For 
N24SWD  patients  without  light  perception,  only  non-
photoinduced  methods  can  be  used  to  adjust  the  circadian 
phase of sleep. The treatments mainly use sleep hygiene ed-
ucation,  adjusted  sleep  time,  and  melatonin  treatment.  Spe-
cifically, these treatments aim to educate patients on how to 
adjust  their  sleep  and  re-establish  a  sleep-wake  schedule 
synchronized  with  the  external  environment,  society,  and 
their occupation, to improve the circadian rhythm. According 
to  the  2015  AASM  guideline,  melatonin  therapy  is  recom-
mended  for  blind  people  with  N24SWD  [36].  In  addition, 
tasimelteon,  a  selective  agonist  of  the  melatonin  receptors 
MT1 and MT2, was the first medication approved by the US 
Food  and  Drug  Administration  in  2014  for  the  treatment  of 
N24SWD.  Tasimelteon  is  safe  and  well-tolerated  for  long 
periods, and is not associated with withdrawal or dependency 
symptoms [96]. For the blind, some studies have shown that 
taking a low dose of melatonin (ranging from 10 mg [97] to 
0.5  mg  [98])  at  a  fixed  time,  i.e.,  approximately  1  hour  be-
fore the desired bedtime, can effectively guide and improve 
sleep.  For  people  with  normal  sight,  light  exposure  can  be 
used  to  enhance  the  light  and  dark  cycles,  and/or  melatonin 
can be administered to regulate circadian rhythms. In a case 
report of a sighted woman with free-running sleep-wake and 
melatonin  rhythms,  the  entrainment  effect  was  achieved  by 
performing  conventional  bright  light  treatment  for  2  hours 
immediately  after  waking  up  [99].  In  another  individual,  a 
24-hour  melatonin  profile  was  restored  after  entrainment 
with  a  combination  of  bright  morning  light  for  2  hours, 
bright  light  avoidance  before  bedtime,  and  strict  darkness 
while  sleeping  [100].  In  a  separate  case,  a  sighted  patient 
with N24SWD received a 3-hour-long morning light therapy, 
and  PSG  results  showed  an  improvement  in  the  24-hour 
sleep pattern of the patient [101]. Meanwhile, a combination 
of  light  and  melatonin  treatment  has  also  been  tried.  Alt-
hough long-term compliance is often challenging, some ini-
tial  successes  have  been  achieved  [102].  Yanagihara  et  al. 
reported  that  the  symptoms  of  two  sighted  patients  with 
N24SWD  were  improved  by  tasimelteon  (8  mg  at  20:00 
hours) and triazolam or methylcobalamin combination thera-
py [103]. Moreover, the sleep-wake rhythm of an N24SWD 
woman with depressive symptoms was restored to a 24-hour 
pattern when taking low-dose valproic acid, and her depres-
sive  symptoms  also  tended  to  improve  as  a  result  of  syn-
chronization  without  antidepressant  medication.  Low-dose 
valproic acid appears to be an effective means of enhancing 
the circadian rhythm in patients with N24SWD and may also 
improve  related  depressive  symptoms;  however,  its  specific 

Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake Disorders 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 6    1029 

safety  remains  to  be  explored  [104].  Overall,  N24SWD  pa-
tients with or without sight must have good compliance and 
adhere to treatment, or they may easily relapse. 

6. IRREGULAR SLEEP-WAKE RHYTHM DISORDER 

6.1. Definition 

Irregular  sleep-wake  rhythm  disorder  (ISWRD),  also 
known as no circadian rhythm, grossly disturbed sleep-wake 
rhythm,  and  chaotic  sleep-wake  rhythm,  manifests  as  a  dis-
ordered sleep-wake cycle that shows no clear pattern. In the 
24-hour cycle, the sleep-wake phase can be divided into 3 or 
more  additional  phases,  with  each  phase  lasting  from  be-
tween  1  to  4  hours.  As  a  result  of  disturbed  night  sleep 
maintenance  and  an  increase  in  daytime  napping,  patients 
often  complain  of  night  insomnia  or  excessive  daytime 
sleepiness.  Relative  to  age,  the  individual  TST  is  normal, 
whereas the biological clock is out of balance. Twenty-four-
hour  PSG  records  frequently  indicate  short  sleep  periods, 
reduced sleep spindles, and reduced or absent non-rapid eye 
movement sleep [105]. 

6.2. Epidemiology 

Although the incidence of ISWRD in the general popula-
tion  is  unknown,  it  is  estimated  to  be  very  low  [106].  The 
disease  can  occur  in  any  population,  and  there  is  no  known 
gender difference. However, this disease is more common in 
the elderly, especially in those with age-related neurological 
diseases  such  as  dementia.  A  few  individuals  with  normal 
cognitive  functions,  but  irregular  work  and  rest  schedules, 
long-term bed rest, or who frequently doze off, and especial-
ly those who lack a regular life, are more susceptible to this 
disorder. ISWRD can also be seen with brain trauma and in 
children with mental retardation [80, 107]. 

6.3. Etiology 

The  etiology  of  ISWRD  is  not  well  understood,  and 
many  factors  may  contribute  to  its  development.  Poor  sleep 
hygiene  (such  as  in  people  with  extremely  irregular  lives) 
and the lack of a zeitgeber (lack of light, exercise, and social 
cues)  can  induce  or  worsen  the  development  of  ISWRD 
[108].  Elderly  people  in  nursing  homes  and  patients  with 
dementia tend to be less exposed to outdoor light and partic-
ipate in fewer social activities, and also suffer vision loss and 
age-related SCN changes. These factors are speculated to be 
related  to  the  occurrence  and  maintenance  of  ISWRD  [109, 
110].  ISWRD  symptoms  have  also  been  found  in  people 
with Angelman syndrome and Williams syndrome. The con-
centration  of  melatonin  and  its  metabolites  in  these  patients 
was  reported  to  decrease  at  night  and  increase  during  the 
day, except for the abnormal melatonin rhythm, and its am-
plitude  is  also  significantly  reduced.  This  may  be  related  to 
polymorphism in melatonin synthesis pathways or mutations 
in the genes encoding melatonin receptors [111, 112]. 

6.4. Diagnostic Evaluation 

The most useful methods currently available for the eval-
uation of ISWRD are the sleep diary and actigraphy, both of 
which  can  show  whether  a  patient  lacks  a  clear  sleep-wake 
circadian  rhythm.  ISWRD  mainly  manifests  as  multiple  ir-
regular  sleep-wake  episodes  within  24  hours.  If  possible, 
patients  should  be  continuously  monitored  for  14  days.  For 

patients with cognitive impairment, however, the objectivity 
of the evaluation method is affected to a certain extent [80]. 
Although  24-hour  PSG  can  assess  sleep-wake  patterns,  it  is 
not  routinely  used.  There  is  insufficient  evidence  regarding 
the use of DLMO and MEQ for the diagnostic evaluation of 
ISWRD.  Importantly,  this  sleep  disorder  must  be  distin-
guished from other sleep disorders. 

6.5. Diagnostic Criteria  

The diagnosis of ISWRD requires that the following four 
main criteria are met [12]: 1) The patient or caregiver reports 
a  chronic  or  recurrent  pattern  of  irregular  sleep  and  wake 
episodes  throughout  the  24  hours,  characterized  by  symp-
toms of insomnia during the scheduled sleep period (usually 
at  night),  excessive  sleepiness  (napping)  during  the  day,  or 
both; 2) symptoms are present for at least 3 months; 3) sleep 
logs  and,  whenever  possible,  actigraphy  monitoring  for  at 
least 7 days (preferably 14 days), demonstrate no major sleep 
period  and  multiple  irregular  sleep  bouts  with  at  least  three 
brief sleep periods during 24 hours; and 4) the sleep disturb-
ance  is  not  better  explained  by  another  current  sleep  disor-
der, medical or neurologic disorder, mental disorder, medica-
tion use, or substance use disorder.  

6.6. Treatments 

The  main  goal  of  ISWRD  treatment  is  to  consolidate 
night sleep and maintain daytime wakefulness by enhancing 
the intensity of the endogenous circadian rhythm to make it 
consistent  with  the  circadian  rhythm  of  the  external  envi-
ronment (Table 1). 

6.6.1. Melatonin 

Melatonin  is  currently  used  as  a  treatment  for  ISWRD. 
For children and adults with psychomotor retardation, mela-
tonin  at  a  dose  of  2~20  mg  can  improve  and  consolidate 
sleep  patterns  and  reduce  daytime  sleep  [113].  Similarly, 
taking  2  mg  of  melatonin  before  going  to  bed  can  improve 
the  sleep  of  patients  with  schizophrenia  [114].  In  the  treat-
ment of patients with Angelman syndrome and ISWRD, the 
administration  of  1  mg  of  melatonin  between  18:00  and 
19:00 hours significantly increases sleep time at night com-
pared with that in the daytime [111]. A large-scale random-
ized controlled trial showed that light could improve cogni-
tive function in people with dementia while melatonin short-
ens the sleep onset latency, causing depression in the elderly; 
however,  melatonin  combined  with  phototherapy  improves 
sleep efficiency [115]. In the elderly, therefore, phototherapy 
or phototherapy combined with melatonin therapy is recom-
mended, whereas melatonin treatment alone is not. 

6.6.2. Phototherapy 

Bright light exposure is used to strengthen the light-dark 
cycle.  Strong  daytime  light  exposure  can  reduce  daytime 
napping, consolidate nighttime sleep, and ultimately improve 
the  circadian  rhythm  of  sleep  and  wakefulness  in  patients. 
There  is  evidence  that  ISWRD  patients  with  dementia  re-
ceiving  strong  light  exposure  for  2  hours  (3,000~5,000  lux) 
every  morning  for  more  than  4  weeks  have fewer  daytime 
naps and increased nighttime sleep time [116]. Additionally, 
exposure to bright light, either in the morning or evening, is 
beneficial  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  patients.  Bright  lights  in 
the morning (2,500 lux) have been shown to increase noctur-

1030    Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 6 

Sun and Chen 

nal sleep time by 20~30 minutes, while bright lights at night 
have  been  shown  to  improve  rest-activity  rhythms  [117]. 
Similarly,  bright  morning  light  (4,500  lux)  treatment  was 
shown to normalize the sleep-wake pattern of approximately 
half  of  a  small  group  of  children  with  neurodevelopmental 
delay [118]. 

6.6.3. Behavioral Therapy 

Patients  should  be  encouraged  to  perform  appropriate 
physical  activities  and  exercises  during  the  day  to  increase 
the  amount  of  outdoor  light  they  receive.  During  the  treat-
ment period, patients need to be urged to strictly abide by the 
work-rest schedule. Even when sleepy and fatigued, a patient 
should try his best to stay awake during the prescribed awak-
ening  period  and  gradually  adjust  and  establish  the  regular 
sleep-wake cycle [36, 105]. 

6.6.4. Combination Therapy 

When  a  single  treatment  is  not  effective,  combined 
treatments can be used, such as combining phototherapy with 
behavioral  intervention  (regular  exercise,  adjusting  sleep 
time,  reducing  night  light  exposure,  and  reducing  night 
noise)  [106].  A  combination  of  phototherapy,  time  therapy, 
and drug therapy (vitamin B12 and sedative-hypnotics) elicit-
ed a 45% success rate [119]. Therefore, the treatment of such 
patients should be individualized. For elderly patients, how-
ever, any adverse conditions, especially mental states, should 
be closely monitored during medication. 

CONCLUSION 

CRSWDs encompass a wide spectrum of disorders, all of 
which  are  associated  with  the  dysregulation  of  the  internal 
circadian  system  with  respect  to  the  external  environ-
ment. This  dysregulation  can  have  a  significant  impact  on 
physical and mental health, and there is a high comorbidity of 
psychiatric disease with many of these disorders. This review 
provided an update on recent findings and developments relat-
ed to the epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, diag-
nostic criteria, and treatment of CRSWD. This understanding 
has  promoted  the  application  of  basic  research  on  biological 
rhythms  in  clinical  sleep  medicine  practice.  For  instance,  the 
measurement of biomarkers of endogenous biological rhythms 
has become a clinical diagnostic method, while the restoration 
of normal biological rhythms has become the goal of clinical 
treatment. We believe that further in-depth research on circa-
dian  rhythms  will  lead  to  the  identification  of  new  research 
directions  and  better  solutions  for  problems  related  to  sleep 
disorders. It is foreseeable that the development of new drugs 
to  treat  CRSWDs  will  be  targeted  toward  sleep-  and  wake-
promoting signals of the biological clock.
