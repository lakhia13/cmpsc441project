Background: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislations are being modiﬁed
around the world to allow patients to receive mental health services through telehealth.
Unfortunately, there are no large clinical trial available to reliably document the efﬁcacy
of delivering videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP) for people with panic disorder and
agoraphobia (PDA) and whether basic psychotherapeutic processes are altered.

Methods: This 2-arm intent-to-treat non-inferiority study reports on a clinical trial
on VCP and documents how therapeutic working alliance and motivation toward
psychotherapy are associated to treatment outcome. We hypothesized that VCP would
not be inferior to standard face-to-face (FF) cognitive behavior therapy for PDA. No
speciﬁc hypothesis was stated to address working alliance and treatment mechanisms.
VCP was compared to a gold-standard psychotherapy treatment for PDA, which was
delivered either in person or in videoconference, with a strict tolerance criterion of about
2 points on the primary outcome measure. Seventy one adult patients were recruited.
Measures of working alliance were collected after the ﬁrst, ﬁfth, and last session.
Motivation toward therapy at pre-treatment and working alliance after the ﬁfth therapy
session were used as predictors of treatment outcome and compared with change in
dysfunctional beliefs toward bodily sensations.

Results: Panic disorder, agoraphobia, fear of sensations and depressed mood all
showed signiﬁcant improvements and large effect-sizes from pre to post-treatment.
Gains were maintained at follow-up. No signiﬁcant differences were found between
VCP and FF, and effect sizes were trivial for three of the four outcome measures. Non-
inferiority tests conﬁrmed that VCP was no less effective than FF therapy on the primary
outcome measure and two of the three secondary outcome measures. Working alliance
was very strong in VCP and did not statistically differ from FF. Working alliance and
motivation did not predict treatment outcome, which was signiﬁcantly predicted by the

reduction in dysfunctional beliefs. The strength of the therapeutic bond was correlated
with change in dysfunctional beliefs.

Conclusion: Mental health professionals can use VCP to provide services to patients
with PDA. Building and maintaining a sound working alliance should not be a source
concern. Practical recommendations are formulated.

INTRODUCTION

Telemedicine and telepsychotherapy have long been considered
solutions to provide health services to people living in rural
areas, but legislations are now being modiﬁed around the world
to allow people to receive services from home due to measures
implemented to face the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many
people are sensitive to these measures, including some anxious
patients and those fearful of physical distancing and conﬁnement.
In this context, there is a need for accessible empirical evidences
about the eﬃcacy and predictors of outcome of telehealth for each
speciﬁc mental disorder.

People suﬀering from PDA are vulnerable in a pandemic
crisis, such as the one associated with COVID-19. By deﬁnition
(American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013), people with
PDA experience recurrent unexpected and spontaneous panic
attacks, worry about recurring attacks, and fear of physical
symptoms, such as chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of
breath, dizziness, or abdominal distress. PDA is accompanied
with signiﬁcant anxiety about being in places or situations in
which it would be diﬃcult to escape or receive assistance if
panic attacks were to occur (American Psychiatric Association
[APA], 2013), including being conﬁned. The lifetime prevalence
of PDA is estimated at 4–6% of the adult population. PDA
is chronic, associated with very signiﬁcant emotional distress,
signiﬁcant fear of body sensations and frequent medical visits
(Barsky et al., 1999; Teismann et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2019).
The psychological processes at the core of PDA rest on the
dysfunctional association between body sensations (interoceptive
cues) experienced during panic arousal and perceived threat,
which is maintain by avoidance of stimuli or places that elicit
feared body sensations or potential panic attacks (Clark, 1986;
Barlow, 1988; Taylor et al., 2007). Preliminary reports have
suggested that COVID-19 may have an impact on panic disorder
(Bhatia et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020). People with PDA, or
at risk of developing PDA, may be more sensitive to the
apprehension of suﬀering from harmful diseases, experiencing
symptoms associated with COVID-19 (e.g., shortness of breath,
dizziness), wearing facial masks that may induce the feeling
that breathing is diﬃcult, being restricted in mobility because
of rules for conﬁnement and physical distancing, having panic
attacks induced by the increase in arousal caused by adapting
to this situation or by co-morbid anxiety disorders, etc. As an
eﬀective treatment for PDA, CBT involves strategies targeting
dysfunctional beliefs and avoidance behaviors (Sánchez-Meca

et al., 2010). The key treatment mechanism of CBT for PDA is
considered to be reappraisal of interoceptive sensations, and to
some extent increase in self-eﬃcacy (Clark, 1986; Barlow, 1988;
Bouchard et al., 2007; Smits et al., 2012; Gallagher et al., 2013).

is one of

Videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP)

the
various telehealth modalities that can improve access to mental
health professionals trained in evidence-based strategies such
as cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) or with other specialized
expertise (Nelson and Duncan, 2015; Liu et al., 2020). The eﬃcacy
of CBT is well established in the treatment of anxiety disorders
when delivered face-to-face, when compared to no treatment or
to a placebo (Hofmann et al., 2012; Carpenter et al., 2018), and
is recommended as the gold-standard form of psychotherapy for
PDA in clinical guidelines (e.g., Katzman et al., 2014). Several
outcome studies have been conducted on VCP, but systematic
reviews on anxiety disorders have always concluded that more
rigorous research is needed (Rees and Maclaine, 2015; Berryhill
et al., 2019).

The most recent systematic review (Berryhill et al., 2019)
demonstrated that studies on VCP for panic disorder and
agoraphobia (PDA) are scarce. Only three studies have been
published so far (Bouchard et al., 2000, 2004; Cowain, 2001;
Lindner et al., 2014) and are of moderate methodological quality.
One additional study has been published, only in French, not
indexed in major databases, and before the entire study was
completed (Allard et al., 2007). The largest outcome study on
PDA (Bouchard et al., 2004) reported in reviews and meta-
analyses (Rees and Maclaine, 2015; Berryhill et al., 2019) was
conducted with 21 participants, and showed that CBT delivered
by videoconference was eﬀective.

If mental health professionals are to conduct VCP for PDA,
it is urgent to share knowledge that demonstrate its eﬃcacy
based on larger samples that includes follow-up data. It is
also essential to better understand the processes involved in
telepsychotherapy, such as the role of working alliance and
motivation toward therapy.

Indeed, working alliance is an important part of any
psychotherapy and involves
three factors: agreement on
in-sessions tasks, agreement on treatment goals, and the
development of a mutual
therapeutic bond (Bordin, 1979;
Horvath and Greenberg, 1989). In a systematic review on VCP,
Backhaus et al. (2012) found that only 16 out of 47 studies
examined the patient-provider relationship in therapy, and
14 out of 16 concluded that patients and providers perceived
a strong working alliance. However, a more recent review

Videoconferencing Psychotherapy for Panic Disorder Agoraphobia

using diﬀerent criteria (Norwood et al., 2018) highlighted the
need for more studies,
including for PDA, and considered
that the working alliance was slightly lower in VCP than in
FF therapy. Psychotherapists may be apprehensive toward
using videoconferencing for fear of disrupting the working
alliance (Rees and Stone, 2005; Richardson et al., 2009; Connolly
et al., 2020). Two remaining key questions are how the three
factors that contribute to working alliance could be aﬀected
by VCP and how,
in turn, alliance inﬂuences treatment
mechanisms and outcome.

Another important process that can aﬀect therapy is patients’
motivation. Motivation inﬂuences how patients engage in
therapeutic work,
integrate learning, change their behavior
(Deci and Ryan, 2000), and can inﬂuence treatment outcome
(Orlinsky et al., 1994). Ryan and Deci (2008) proposed that, when
individuals are more autonomously engaged in a therapeutic
undertaking, they are more likely to integrate learning and
to change their behavior, resulting in more positive outcomes.
However, to the authors’ knowledge, no study has examined if
motivation toward psychotherapy diﬀers when oﬀered in VCP
versus face-to-face.

The aims of this paper are to disseminate results on a non-
inferiority trial of VCP at post-treatment and follow-up and
document factors associated with treatment outcome for PDA.
The main hypothesis of the ﬁrst aim was that VCP would not
be inferior to standard face-to-face CBT for PDA according
to the primary measure of outcome (severity of PDA). Similar
hypotheses were formulated for the three broader measures of
generalization (agoraphobic avoidance, fear of sensations and
depressed mood). Non-inferiority was deﬁned by a strict and
small margin of tolerance for non-inferiority. The second aim was
to document the impact of VCP on alliance and how alliance and
motivation inﬂuenced treatment outcome. No a priori hypothesis
was stated. First, we compared measures of alliance at the
beginning of the treatment, after the ﬁrst third of the treatment,
and the end of the treatment. Second, we assessed and compared
the contribution of alliance, motivation, and cognitive changes
in dysfunctional beliefs toward body sensations to the primary
measure of treatment outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Procures to Meet Standards in Ethics
and Research
The project was approved by the research ethics boards of the lead
university and all hospitals involved and was conducted following
the ethical standards of
the Canadian Tri-Council policy
statement for ethical conduct for research involving humans and
the Declaration of Helsinki. No monetary compensation was
provided. All patients were fully informed of the nature of the
study and provided free written consent.

This article was written following CONSORT (Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines for trials assessing
non-pharmacological treatments and for non-equivalence trials.
There was no modiﬁcation to the trial’s methods once the
study started. Modiﬁcations from the grant proposal application

were done to respect the budget, ensure feasibility and take
into account requests from the ethics committees. Patients and
therapists were aware (not blind) of the assigned treatments
and study objectives due to the explicit nature of the treatment
provided (VCP or FF). The clinical trial was designed as a within-
between trial (i.e., pre/post/f-up comparing VCP to FF) without
random assignment of participants to the treatment modalities.
Random assignment in VCP studies has mixed pros and cons
that must be considered. If a study is to replicate the factual
and subjective eﬀects due to patients being in a remote location
isolated from their therapist, randomly assigning patients to
meet online a therapist that is nearby in an adjacent room of
the clinic is not an ecologically valid option. This is especially
relevant for CBT of PDA, as patients feel reassured by the
presence of the therapist during exposure. To use a randomly
controlled design, the alternative is to allocate participants to
both conditions and, for those in the FF treatment modality,
to either have the participants or the therapists commute to
the FF therapy site. This solution entails enormous research
costs and challenging funding issues. In addition to reducing the
representativeness of the study, this solution also signiﬁcantly
increases the risk of drop-out, as experienced by Mitchell et al.
(2008) in their study, with a drop-our rate of 40% during therapy.
Finally, because remote rural communities are less populated, this
approach precludes the recruitment of a large sample. For this
study, in order to maximize generalization of results to patients
who are unable to receive psychotherapy in FF, participants from
a rural (Maniwaki) and an urban (Montréal) distant sites were all
allocated to VCP and patients in the local urban site (Gatineau)
were all allocated to FF. As per the grant proposal, the study was
stopped when funding was exhausted.

Conducting non-inferiority trials is associated with important
methodological requirements that must be explicitly stated and
justiﬁed (Powers and Fleming, 2013; Mauri and D’Agostino,
2017), such as the choice of the reference treatment (to ensure the
experimental treatment is not compared with a barely eﬀective
one), the selection of the non-inferiority margin, the statistical
approach, and the use of an intent-to-treat approach that does
no impede the eﬀectiveness of the reference treatment. In the
current study, the reference treatment was a gold standard for
PDA that has shown its eﬃcacy and superiority over placebo
and several other alternatives (Hofmann et al., 2012; Carpenter
et al., 2018), and that has been successfully used before by our
research group in its traditional FF format (Bouchard et al.,
1996). Non-inferiority was deﬁned by a small margin of tolerance
operationalized as a Cohen D of 0.20, which represents a
diﬀerence in change between the two conditions of no more
than 2 points on the primary outcome measure. The same
criterion was applied to the secondary outcome measures. The
statistical approach was to document treatment outcome based
on repeated-measures ANOVAs, focus on the eﬀect sizes of both
conditions’ outcome and the Condition by Time interactions, and
interpret the diﬀerences in eﬀectiveness based on non-inferiority
analyses. Structural equation modeling of latent growth curve
model was not use because it requires very large sample size
as well as numerous measurement points, and to allow for
consistency with the non-inferiority testing approach described

above. The trial was analyzed with intent-to-treat design because
it is the most conservative approach.

Sample
Upon contact
following publicity and medical references,
each participant received the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-IV (SCID; First et al., 1997) to ascertain eligibility
(presence of PDA and other mental disorders). The intake
interview was realized face-to-face. The exclusion criteria were:
(1) primary diagnosis other than PDA (American Psychiatric
Association [APA], 2013); (2) duration of illness of less than
6 months; (3) diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia
or psychotic disorder, organic mental disorder,
intellectual
disability, substance use disorder, or severe personality disorders;
(4) below 18 or above 65 years of age; (5) currently receiving
a psychological treatment (i.e., no concurrent psychotherapy
allowed);
(6) presence of a medical condition precluding
participation in the treatment for methodological or clinical
(e.g., cardiovascular disease, Meuniere syndrome,
reasons
asthma, history of
seizures, uncontrolled hypoglycemia,
pheochromocytoma, hyper- or hypothyroidism, and brain or
lung tumors); (7) if taking antidepressants, using them for less
than 6 months or, if taking benzodiazepines, using them for less
than 3 months. People on medication who corresponded to the

selection criteria were included only if they agreed not to change
their medication or to increase its dosage during the study. The
vast majority of candidate excluded at the recruitment stage (see
Figure 1 for the CONSORT ﬂow chart) were not eligible because
PDA was not their principal diagnosis.

The sample size and power were established a priori based on
results from a previous and separate study (Bouchard et al., 2004)
and 124 participants were initially recruited (Figure 1). After
intake, the sample consisted of 71 adults who met the selection
criteria. Participants from the remote sites were all allocated to
VCP (n = 40) and patients from the local site all received face-to-
face (FF) treatment (n = 31). A chi-square analysis was conducted
in order to identify diﬀerences in dropout rates between VCP and
FF and the result was not signiﬁcant [χ2(1) = 0.06, ns].

Treatment
Treatment consisted of 12 weekly 60-min sessions of CBT and
was delivered according to a standardized treatment manual
(Clark and Salkovskis, 1987; Barlow and Cerny, 1998; Bouchard
et al., 2004; Allard et al., 2007). The treatment was provided
without delay, as soon as a participant was deemed eligible for
the study. The 12-session written treatment manual was based on
target objectives that must all be addressed in a ﬁxed sequence
of ﬁve modules within a predetermined number of sessions.

Videoconferencing Psychotherapy for Panic Disorder Agoraphobia

This allowed some clinical ﬂexibility in treatment pace while
protecting ﬁdelity of the delivery of a reproductible validated
clinical
intervention. The target objectives of the treatment
were: building rapport and developing a case formulation
(module 1, session 1), sharing a common understanding of
information on PDA and the role of appraisal and avoidance of
physical sensations (module 1, session 2), conducting cognitive
restructuring focused on the core dysfunctional beliefs of PDA
as revealed by the case formulation (module 2, sessions 3 and
4), engaging in interoceptive exposure (e.g., hyperventilating,
spinning, breathing through a straw) of stimuli and avoidance
behaviors identiﬁed as relevant in the case formulation (module
3, sessions 5–8), planning and reviewing agoraphobic exposure
exercises to be conducted between sessions (module 4, sessions
9–11), and wrapping-up the treatment with relapse prevention
(module 5,
session 12). The three psychotherapists who
conducted all CBT sessions were two female graduate students
in clinical psychology and a male psychologist, with previous
experience in CBT and trained for the use of VCP. They
were weekly supervised by the ﬁrst author. Treatment integrity
(Moncher and Prinz, 1991) was ensured by blind ratings of a
subset of video recordings of therapy sessions for adherence to
the treatment manual (Allard et al., 2007). Thirty items rated on
a 0–3 scale measured therapist’s attitude, general skills, delivery
of cognitive restructuring techniques, delivery of exposure, and
management of homework assignment. The analysis revealed no
diﬀerence between the two conditions on the respect of treatment
integrity [t(1,10) = 1.161, ns]. No adverse eﬀects were reported.

Equipment and Locations
Two remote cities (Maniwaki and Montreal) were linked
at 384 kbps with a local site (Gatineau) with Tandberg
2000 videoconference systems set up in psychologists’ oﬃces.
Participants in the VCP condition were all located in the remote
sites, treated by therapists located at the local site, and never
met their therapist face-to-face. The height of the 32-inch
video monitor and the distance between the monitor and the
chair were positioned to replicate a face-to-face psychotherapy
context. Patient and therapist could see each other from the
head to the hips. Therapists in VCP were encouraged to keep
the picture-in-picture function activated so they could see their
own video image and ensure that they remained visible to their
patients. All therapy sessions were video recorded using the
videoconference equipment (i.e., using only the camera in the
FF condition and turning the monitor oﬀ) to assess adherence to
the treatment protocol. If documents needed to be shared, email
or fax was used.

Measures
The outcome variables were assessed after the intake diagnostic
interview: at pre-treatment, at post-treatment, and at a 12-
month follow-up. The duration of
the follow-up was set
as for 12 months because it is considered as a reasonably
in
long in CBT and by granting agencies [in comparison,
their meta-analysis Carpenter et al. (2018) reported a mean
follow-up duration of 5.5 months]. All
instruments have
been validated and extensively used to assess PDA (see

Bouchard et al., 1997 for a review and details of psychometric
properties and information). Higher scores represent more
severe symptoms. The primary outcome was a measure
addressing the severity of PDA globally and was complemented
with three secondary outcome measures addressing more
broadly the impact of the treatment (agoraphobic avoidance,
fear of body sensations, and depressed mood). Additional
measures were administered to document predictors of treatment
outcome that may be inﬂuenced by VCP. They included two
variables considered as common factors in all psychotherapies
(working alliance and motivation) and two measures speciﬁc
to CBT of PDA (change in dysfunctional beliefs toward
body sensations and in perceived self-eﬃcacy). To maintain
an adequate ratio of participants per predictor variables,
only change in dysfunctional beliefs toward body sensations
were analyzed in the regression analyses reported in the
article. The role of perceived self-eﬃcacy was explored in the
Online Supplementary Material only. The two measures of
working alliance were administered after sessions 1, 5, and
12. All
three measurement points were compared to ﬁnd
diﬀerences between VCP and FF. To reduce the risks of social
desirability biases on measures of working alliance, participants
were assured their therapist would not have access to their
results; once completed, patients sealed the questionnaires
in an envelope and mailed the envelope to the provincial
board of psychologists. The envelopes were only returned
to the researchers when treatments for all participants were
completed. Only ratings of working alliance obtained at session
5 were used in the analyses of the predictors of outcome,
as recommended to provide a fair assessment of alliance
unbiased by treatment success (Ardito and Rabellino, 2011;
Buchholz and Abramowitz, 2020).

Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS; Bandelow, 1995)
The PAS was selected as the primary outcome measure because
it assesses the global severity of PDA. This self-report has 13
items, rated on a 0 to 4 rating scale measuring: (1) panic attacks
(frequency, severity, duration); (2) avoidance; (3) apprehension;
(4) impairment in familial and professional relationships; and (5)
worries about health. The average score reported for a clinical
sample of people with PDA was 24.7 (SD = 9.8) and Cronbach’s
alpha was 0.88. The PAS is a sensitive and well validated global
outcome measure.

Mobility Inventory When Alone (MI; Chambless et al.,
1985)
This measure of agoraphobia uses 27 items to rate how frequently
a person avoids various situations when not accompanied by
someone else. Agoraphobic avoidance is a very important feature
of PDA and was selected as one of the three secondary measures
of the generalization of treatment outcome. The average clinical
score reported by the authors was 3.22 (SD = 1.01), and
an average score of 1.5 (SD = 0.45) has been reported for
a community sample. The MI-Alone has a Cronbach’s alpha
between 0.94 and 0.96.

Bouchard et al.

Videoconferencing Psychotherapy for Panic Disorder Agoraphobia

The Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ;
Chambless et al., 1984)
The BSQ measures the fear of 17 diﬀerent body sensations
and was used as a secondary outcome measure.
In the
validation study, the average score of the clinical sample was
3.05 (SD = 0.85), and an average score of 1.8 (SD = 0.59)
had been reported in a community sample. The BSQ has a
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.87.

Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et al., 1996)
The BDI is a well known 21-item self-report measure of
symptoms of depression. As a measure of depressed mood, it is
used in several CBT trials to document treatment eﬀects that are
broader than core PDA features. The BDI has a Cronbach’s alpha
of 0.92. Scores below 10 are in the normal range and scores above
20 are associated with probable or mild depression.

The Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ;
Chambless et al., 1984)
The Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ; Chambless
et al., 1984) is a well validated measure of the core psychological
change processes involved in the CBT of PDA (Clark, 1986). It
was administered as a measure of treatment process speciﬁc to
the CBT of PDA. It consists of 14 items measuring dysfunctional
beliefs related to possible catastrophic consequences of having a
panic attack. The average score was 2.42 (SD = 0.64) in the clinical
validation sample, and 1.6 (SD = 0.47) in a community sample.
The Cronbach alpha is 0.80.

Working Alliance Inventory (WAI; Horvath and
Greenberg, 1989)
Patients completed the self-rated version of the WAI. This
widely used questionnaire measures working alliance with three
subscales (agreement on goals, agreement on tasks, and the
therapeutic bond). The long 36-item version oﬀers an excellent
general measure of working alliance, but it is recommended to
analyze the shorter 12-item version if one wants to measure the
three ﬁrst-order unique aspects of the alliance that are the Goal,
Task and Bond subscales (Tracey and Kokotovic, 1989). The
Cronbach’s alpha are 0.90, 0.90, and 0.92 for the Goal, Task, and
Bond subscales, respectively.

California Psychotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS;
Marmar et al., 1986)
The CALPAS is another self-rated measure of alliance. This 24-
item instrument was also administered to provide a diﬀerent and
complementary perspective on the working alliance (Bachelor
and Salamé, 2000; Buchholz and Abramowitz, 2020).

The Client Motivation for Therapy Scale (Pelletier
et al., 1997)
The CMOTS was used to provide a global measure patient’s
motivation. The 24 items assess assessing intrinsic motivation
for therapy, the four forms of extrinsic motivation (integrated,
identiﬁed,
introjected, and external regulation) for therapy,
and amotivation for therapy. These factors were derived from
Deci and Ryan (2000)’s theory of the self-determination and

motivation. This questionnaire was administered at the pre-
treatment and the alphas for internal consistency vary between
0.70 and 0.92). The total score was calculated as recommended
by the authors and used in this study.

RESULTS

Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 25. Table 1 presents
the descriptive variables for VCP and FF conditions. Chi-
square analyses and Student’s t-tests did not reveal pre-existing
diﬀerences between the two conditions on these variables.
Note that there was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence when
comparing participants from the diﬀerent recruitment sites on all
of these variables or on outcome variables at pre-treatment.

Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to document
treatment eﬃcacy, and non-inferiority was tested using Wellek
(2010) procedures and tables using a strict margin of tolerance
for non-inferiority of 0.20 at the signiﬁcance level of 0.05. All
assumptions were respected for the analyses. Mauchly’s test for
sphericity was signiﬁcant and the Greenhouse–Geisser correction
was applied. However, the correction was small and yielded the
exact same F values as when uncorrected.

Table 2 presents results for the PAS, MI, BSQ, and BDI.
The ANOVAs revealed signiﬁcant Time eﬀects for each measure
and no signiﬁcant diﬀerence for the Condition and the
Condition × Time interactions. Contrasts for Pre to Post
Time eﬀects were all signiﬁcant and very large [for PAS
[F(1,69) = 79.98, p = 0.000, η2
p = 0.52), for MI [F(1,69) = 43.97,
p = 0.000, η2
p = 0.39], for BSQ [F(1,69) = 52.68, p = 0.000,
η2
p = 0.43], and for BDI [F(1,69) = 13.99, p = 0.000, η2
p = 0.17].
Contrasts for Pre to Post by Condition interaction were all non-
signiﬁcant and trivial for all measures, except for the fear of body
sensations which was very small [for PAS (F(1,69) = 0.2, p = 0.63,
η2
p = 0.003), for MI (F(1,69) = 0.08, p = 0.78, η2
p = 0.001), for BSQ
(F(1,69) = 1.65, p = 0.2, η2
p = 0.023), and for BDI (F(1,69) = 0.098,
p = 0.76, η2
p = 0.001)]. Gains were all maintained at the 12-mo
follow-up. All posttreatment to follow-up contrasts were non-
signiﬁcant [for PAS (F(1,69) = 1.97, p = 0.17, η2
p = 0.028), for MI
(F(1,69) = 0.02, p = 0.87, η2
p = 0.000), for BSQ (F(1,69) = 3.32,
p = 0.07, η2
p = 0.046), and for BDI (F(1,69) = 0.007, p = 0.93,
η2
p = 0.000)]. Applying Bonferroni corrections with a signiﬁcance
level set at 0.01. did not change the interpretation of the results.

The analyses were repeated for gender (17% were males) and
for presence of none versus at least one comorbid disorder (46%
did not report a comorbid disorder) to document the potential
impact of these variables. Some impact of gender was found to
be statistically signiﬁcant on three outcome variables, but gender
did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the impact of VCP on treatment
outcome on any variable. For the PAS, the Time X Gender
interaction was signiﬁcant [F(2,134) = 5.1, p < 0.01, η2
p = 0.07],
suggesting that males beneﬁted more from CBT than females. For
the MI, the main eﬀect of Gender was signiﬁcant [F(1,67) = 10.25,
p = 0.002, η2
p = 0.13], suggesting more severe avoidance in
females overall. A similar gender diﬀerence was found on the BSQ
[F(1,67) = 10.1, p = 0.002, η2
p = 0.13]. The impact of Comorbidity

was not statistically signiﬁcant for any outcome measure. In sum,
the treatment was eﬀective, and no diﬀerence was found between
VCP and FF. Figure 2 illustrates the pattern of results with 95%
conﬁdence intervals.

The non-inferiority tests revealed that VCP was statistically
no less eﬀective than FF on the primary outcome variable
(see Table 2), and two of
the three secondary outcome
measures (agoraphobia and depressed mood). However, the non-
inferiority test did not reach statistical signiﬁcance for the fear of
body sensations.

Repeated measures ANOVAs were also conducted for the
measures of working alliance (see Table 3 for the results with
patients as treated). A signiﬁcant Time eﬀect was found with
each measure, while no Condition or Time × Condition eﬀects

were statistically signiﬁcant. The quality of working alliance
improved during treatment in both conditions and according
to both measures. In all comparisons, the alliance was strong
but lower in VCP compared to FF, with diﬀerences that were
not signiﬁcant and associated with very small eﬀect sizes (partial
eta-squared ranged between 0.03 and 0.06). The analyses were
repeated with gender and presence of at least one comorbid
disorder to document the potential impact of these variables.
None of those analyses revealed a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect
of gender or of presence of comorbidity. Despite the lack of
signiﬁcant main eﬀect for Condition in all ANOVAs, a posteriori
contrasts were performed to scrutinize the impact of VCP on
working alliance. The eﬀect sizes of contrasts comparing VCP
and FF were between trivial and small at Session 1 (partial

for WAI-Goal, and 0.01 for CALPAS), and between trivial and
small at Session 12 (partial eta-squared of 0.05 for WAI-Task,
0.04 for WAI-Bond, 0.00 for WAI-Goal, and 0.01 for CALPAS).
Further analyses reported in the on-line supplement explored the
possibility that a strong working alliance in VCP was obtained
because therapists put more eﬀorts than in FF (see Online
Supplementary Material). This alternative explanation was not
conﬁrmed. The online supplement also reports results of the
repeated measures ANOVAs performed with imputed values for
missing data on working alliance. These additional analyses did
not change the statistical signiﬁcance of any of the ﬁndings
pertaining to working alliance.

Motivation toward therapy was high and self-determined in
participants in the VCP (Mean = 13.26, SD = 3.77) and the
FF (Mean = 12.30, SD = 4.65) conditions. The diﬀerence in
motivation across conditions at pre-treatment was not signiﬁcant
[t(67) = 0.96, p = 0.34; η 2

p = 0.01].

Finally, two regression analyses were performed to identify
the predictors of treatment eﬃcacy based on the PAS. The
ﬁrst multiple regression looked at the predictors of outcome
with the working alliance (WAI-Task, WAI-Bond, WAI-Goal,
CALPAS total score) measured after the ﬁfth therapy session
and motivation measured at pre-treatment. Change in pre
to post treatment outcome was measured using residualized
change score. A second regression was performed to assess
the relative role of working alliance and motivation compared
to the predictor of change assumed by the CBT model to be
the core treatment mechanism, change in dysfunctional beliefs.
Residualized change in dysfunctional beliefs were added in the
second step of a hierarchical regression, after controlling for
the other predictors and residualized change on BDI. Depressed
mood was included in the analysis to be more conservative
and reduce the percentage of variance left to explained at
the second step of the hierarchy (i.e., the impact of change
in beliefs was higher when not controlling for the depressed
mood). Note that scores on the ACQ signiﬁcantly decreased
following therapy [F(2,138) = 41.23, p < 0.001; Mean for VCP
at pre-treatment = 2.28 (SD = 0.59); Mean for VCP at post-
treatment = 1.84 (SD = 0.47); Mean for VCP at follow-up = 1.75
(SD = 0.45); Mean for FF at pre-treatment = 2.48 (SD = 0.64);
Mean for FF at post-treatment = 1.90 (SD = 0.66); Mean for FF at
follow-up = 1.88 (SD = 0.72)]. The Condition main eﬀect was not
signiﬁcant [F(1,69) = 1.23, p = 0.27]. The Time by Condition was
not signiﬁcant [F(2,138) = 0.047, p = 0.63, η 2

p = 0.007].

The ﬁrst regression equation was not signiﬁcant (see Table 3).
Result suggested that strength of the working alliance and
motivation did not signiﬁcantly predict treatment outcome.
Robustness of our result was assessed by testing a posteriori
additional regression models. Including the treatment condition
in the regression did not change the results. Performing the
regression with ratings of the working alliance after the ﬁrst
session, instead of the ﬁfth one, did not change the signiﬁcance of
the regression equation or the predictors, except for agreement on
the tasks (t = −2.26, p < 0.05, semi-partial correlation = −0.29).

Using measures of working alliance collected at the last therapy
session did not change the signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst regression
equation or the predictors.

The second regression tested the relative contribution of
working alliance, motivation, and the changes in dysfunctional
beliefs. After controlling for working alliance (three subscales of
the WAI, CALPAS), motivation and change in depressed mood,
the addition of residualized change scores on the ACQ lead to a
signiﬁcant regression model [F(7,52) = 3.89, p < 0.002, R2 = 0.37,
adjusted R2 = 0.28; F change (1,45) = 7.54, p = 0.009]. All
parameters that were non-signiﬁcant in the previous regression
remained non-signiﬁcant, change in BDI was signiﬁcant (std
Beta = 0.36, t = 2.45, p = 0.014, semi-partial correlation = 0.30)
but, most importantly, change in dysfunctional beliefs was
signiﬁcant (std Beta = 0.37, t = 2.75, p = 0.009, semi-partial
correlation = 0.32). Of note, the correlation between the bond
subscale of the WAI at session ﬁve was signiﬁcantly correlated
with change in dysfunctional beliefs (r = −0.29, p < 0.025),
which was not the case for the other measures of alliance
and motivation. The online supplement reports results with
imputed values for missing data and for self-eﬃcacy. Analyses
with imputed values did not change the interpretation of
the results, and the role of self-eﬃcacy was found to be
statistically signiﬁcant.

DISCUSSION

This study provides important information to guide the delivery
of mental health services via teleconference technologies during
and after the COVID-19 crisis. Results found no evidence of
CBT for PDA being signiﬁcantly less eﬀective when delivered in
VCP compare to FF on all outcome measures. The treatment
was eﬀective at post-treatment and gains were maintained at
follow-up based on measures of panic disorder, agoraphobia,
fear of sensations and depressive mood. Conﬁrming the main
hypothesis of the ﬁrst aim of the study, the non-inferiority
analysis demonstrated that VCP was signiﬁcantly non-inferior to
FF therapy for the primary outcome measure of PDA. Two of the
secondary hypotheses were also conﬁrmed, showing signiﬁcant
non-inferiority for agoraphobic avoidance and depressed mood.
However, one of the secondary hypotheses was not supported
for the measure of
fear of physical sensations. There was
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in treatment outcome on the fear
of sensations, but study lacked suﬃcient power to reach the
signiﬁcance level of non-inferiority with a strict
tolerance
criterion. The experimental design retained for the study reﬂects
the situation of patients who are unable to meet the therapist
to receive face-to-face care and could not feel reassured by her
or his physical proximity during therapy sessions. A gender
diﬀerence in treatment response, regardless of the treatment
modality, was observed. This is likely to be related to the small
number of males in the study, which is consistent with the
gender distribution of PDA, and the impact of a few strong male
responders in each condition.

The second signiﬁcant ﬁnding is that CBT can be conducted
in VCP with an excellent working alliance. The use of

instruments measuring working alliance from two diﬀerent
theoretical perspectives provides an interesting perspective. The
CALPAS has been used less frequently in studies on CBT
(Buchholz and Abramowitz, 2020) and provides information that
complements the WAI, such as patient working capacity, patient
commitment and therapists understanding and involvement.
This is reassuring for mental health professionals who may worry
that using technology to remotely deliver psychotherapy may
pose signiﬁcant threat to the working alliance and the therapeutic
relationship (e.g., Rees and Stone, 2005). Motivation at pre-
treatment was also not a source of concern. Working alliance,
when measured globally with the CALPAS and at the speciﬁc
component level with the subscales of the WAI, was not a
signiﬁcant predictor of outcome, which is consistent with other
studies on CBT for PDA (see Buchholz and Abramowitz, 2020 for
a more elaborated discussion). Consistent with the CBT model,
the key factor associated with treatment outcome was change in
dysfunctional beliefs. Change in beliefs was correlated with the
possibility to build a strong bond with the therapist at session
5, even when therapy was delivered remotely. This is clinical
meaningful, as it supports the notion that: (a) a strong alliance
can be built in VCP, including the development of a strong
therapeutic bond, (b) a strong bond is necessary in CBT to
engage in the key behavioral techniques that lead to cognitive
change, which (c) is the key factor leading to improvement and
treatment success.

Our results conﬁrm with a larger sample and methodological
improvements the eﬃcacy of delivering CBT in VCP for PDA
(Bouchard et al., 2000, 2004; Cowain, 2001; Allard et al.,
2007; Lindner et al., 2014). In addition, they contribute to the
growing body of evidence that using videoconference does not
signiﬁcantly compromise the quality of the three factors of
working alliance, or the alliance measured globally (Bouchard
et al., 2004; Allard et al., 2007; Germain et al., 2010; Backhaus
et al., 2012). Motivation before initiating therapy was slightly
higher in VCP participants, but this was not signiﬁcant and
did not inﬂuence treatment outcome. Our study used a global
motivation score, and it would be worthwhile to examine the
role of individual motivation subtypes in future studies. When
considering whether or not using VCP, some professionals and
patients may have experienced low levels of telepresence in
their professional or social use of videoconference. In VCP,
telepresence refers to the impression of really being in therapy
with the provider, rather than being in a physically diﬀerent
location (Bouchard et al., 2011). The feeling of telepresence in
VCP could have an impact on the quality of working alliance,
especially on the bond between patient and therapist, and may
indirectly inﬂuence treatment outcome. Telepresence (Draper
et al., 1998) is expected to diﬀer when comparing psychotherapy
to common applications of videoconference, such as business
meetings, classes and social events. An experimental study
(Bouchard et al., 2011) showed that videoconference exchanges
involving emotions, akin to those observed in psychotherapy,
compared to more neutral ones, led to stronger telepresence.
More research on the role of telepresence and working alliance on
psychotherapy processes is required. However, in the meantime,
some tentative suggestions can be formulated to build and

manage a working alliance using e-mental health delivery
methods during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, therapists must
focus more on the general felling of telepresence occurring
during the session than on small communication glitches that
can occur during VCP. Second, it is important to be aware
and address explicitly breaks in acceptance of the technology
settings (Haddouk et al., 2018; situations when patients become
frustrated toward the use of VCP). Third, therapist may want
to look directly at the camera to establish direct eye contact
with their patient, instead of looking at the eyes of the patient
on the video monitor. Fourth, therapist may need to use more
non-verbal cues (e.g., nodding or thumbs up) and allow longer
pauses between verbal exchanges with their patient to reduce the
risks of talking over each other. Finally, therapists can explore
the literature on ways to communicate empathy in computer-
mediated interactions (Grondin et al., 2019). More research is
also required to extend our results to other mental disorders,
including those for which building and maintaining a strong
working alliance is more challenging than for anxiety disorders
(e.g., addictions, personality disorders).

The study has limitations that must be acknowledged. First,
participants were not randomly assigned to both conditions,
for practical reasons that allowed to replicate situations where
patients are remote and isolated from their therapist. Conducting
exposure to interoceptive cues in a context where the patient
is far away from the therapist is an important asset for the
generalization of the current study to the situation imposed
by the COVID-19 and public health rules related to physical
distancing and conﬁnement. Actually, most past VCP studies did
not conduct randomized control trials (Berryhill et al., 2019).
The 12-month follow-up must be interpreted in the context of
an intent-to-treat analysis where some patients could not be
reached to collect information. Finally, participants were aware
they would receive VCP when they volunteered for the study.
Volunteers for the study may thus have had a more positive
attitude toward VCP than the general population. However,
in situations where telemedicine is a viable solution, or the only
solution, the impact of attitude toward technology may be less
important than actually having access to services.
In the light of our results, three clinical

issues deserve
comments regarding the application VCP for PDA in the
context of COVID-19: (a) fear of the disease, (b) conﬁnement,
and (c) deconﬁnement, physical distancing and other public
health measures. Dysfunctional
thoughts and beliefs about
diseases, health conditions or treatments, can be addressed
eﬀectively in VCP by cognitive restructuring techniques and
exposure to interoceptive cues.
In the current study, all
CBT interventions were based on an individualized case
conceptualization. In the context of COVID-19, it would be
important to consider exploring with patients if the virus, the
disease, the potential treatments (including intubation), the
potential vaccines, information from the Internet and peers,
or the rules imposed by public health services, contribute to
PDA (e.g., Bhatia et al., 2020). Cognitive restructuring and
exposure should be adapted accordingly. Some patients may
avoid going to hospitals and clinics to receive relevant physical
care or exams by fear of contracting the virus. Therapists

must also pay attention to subtle avoidance behaviors that
may be hidden under good intentions (e.g., staying home may
be recommended as a preventive measure, but it may also
be a justiﬁcation for not wearing a facial mask and venture
outside). Conﬁnement imposed by public health authorities, or
self-imposed by house bound PDA patients, can be a sound
justiﬁcation for opting for VCP. The current study shows that
it is an excellent solution and illustrates that interoceptive
exposure is feasible in VCP, including hyperventilation, breathing
through a straw, doing aerobic exercises, spinning, Valsalva
maneuver, etc. (Clark and Salkovskis, 1987; Barlow and Cerny,
1998). The therapeutic bond was excellent
in the current
study when these exposure exercises were introduced, and it
remained high until the end of a treatment that relied heavily
on exposure. However, at some point, VCP must encourage
patients with agoraphobia to actively leave the comfort of
locations where they feel safe and reassured. With smartphones
and other communications devices, VCP sessions can even be
conducted when patients are exposing themselves in feared
locations. Whenever possible, exposure to agoraphobic situations
must be targeted and addressed. When not possible, therapists
must use alternative strategies (e.g., imaginal exposure, videos,
virtual reality) or postpone exposure. However, technology must
not become a way to foster avoidance in anxious patients.
Finally, measures imposed by public health authorities to cope
with COVID-19 are much more diverse than conﬁnement
and each of them may impact the clinical management of
PDA. For example, wearing facial masks may induce sensations
feared by PDA patients (e.g., diﬃculty breathing). Long lines
and queue to access stores and services can be feared and
avoided by people with PDA. Physical distancing and other
deconﬁnement rules may limit the techniques the therapist
could apply in the oﬃce (e.g., hyperventilating is very likely to
have a diﬀerent impact on the spread of respiratory droplets
compared to talking 2-m away from each other), and coping
with the changes imposed by public health and safety may
increase the daily arousal that facilitate the onset of panic
attacks in people with PDA. Finally, therapists and patients
may want to consider an option that has not yet been explored
in clinical trials, which is alternating between VCP and FF
every few sessions.

To conclude, additional general practical guidelines for use
of VCP are summarized. To start with, not all
telehealth
services need to use videoconference. Telephone, web-based
treatments and other options are worth considering given each
patient’s and therapist’s contexts. When it comes to VCP, the
selection of the software to use for VCP must be considered
carefully. In addition to practical and ergonomic issues, their
use must respect the rules and regulations implemented by the
regulatory bodies of each country, province, or state. Even in
open markets (e.g., European Union, Canada - United States -
Mexico Agreement), there are constraints and limitations to the
use of titles such as psychotherapist or psychologist, rights to
practice psychotherapy, and established best practices to protect
conﬁdentiality. Psychotherapy and behavioral change are not
limited to the VCP session; for patients it is a process that requires
personal engagement, emotional processing, time, perspective

taking, and between sessions exercises. For therapists, it also
implies using the right software. Some software needs a password
to conﬁrm the identity of the patient and restrict access on
the users’ computer, oﬀers robust encryption of the therapy
session and uses servers that protect conﬁdentiality. In terms of
psychotherapeutic context, it remains important at the start to
deﬁne and agree with patients on the psychotherapeutic frame.
For example, setting rules for appropriate physical space on
both ends (e.g., privacy, not being disturb while in session),
interactions (e.g., no emergency calls outside
interpersonal
oﬃce hours, keep VCP interactions similar to face-to-face),
management of distractors (e.g., no email alerts during session),
communication strategies (e.g., use of non-verbal interactions to
signal approval instead of speaking over each other, connect a few
minutes before the session to replicate the experience of settling
down in the waiting room), and a contingency management plan
if the sessions fails abruptly (e.g., rescheduling versus calling back
on the telephone or without video feed). For health care agencies
and regulatory board, results of this study should encourage
them to guide and inform their mental health professionals
on the relevance and potential of VCP. The publication of
telehealth guidelines, consent form examples and which software
to recommend should be among their list of key priorities during
and after the COVID-19 crisis.
