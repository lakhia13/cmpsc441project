Abstract

Objective:We conducted a systematic review of the literature to explore the longitudinal course of PTSD in DSM-5-defined
trauma exposed populations to identify the course of illness and recovery for individuals and populations experiencing
PTSD.

Methods: We reviewed the published literature from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010 for longitudinal studies of
directly exposed trauma populations in order to: (1) review rates of PTSD in the first year after a traumatic event; (2) examine
potential types of proposed DSM-5 direct trauma exposure (intentional and non-intentional); and (3) identify the clinical
course of PTSD (early onset, later onset, chronicity, remission, and resilience). Of the 2537 identified articles, 58 articles
representing 35 unique subject populations met the proposed DSM-5 criteria for experiencing a traumatic event, and
assessed PTSD at two or more time points within 12 months of the traumatic event.

Results: The mean prevalence of PTSD across all studies decreases from 28.8% (range = 3.1–87.5%) at 1 month to 17.0%
(range = 0.6–43.8%) at 12 months. However, when traumatic events are classified into intentional and non-intentional, the
median prevalences trend down for the non-intentional trauma exposed populations, while the median prevalences in the
intentional trauma category steadily increase from 11.8% to 23.3%. Across five studies with sufficient data, 37.1% of those
exposed to intentional trauma develop PTSD. Among those with PTSD, about one third (34.8%) remit after 3 months. Nearly
40% of those with PTSD (39.1%) have a chronic course, and only a very small fraction (3.5%) of new PTSD cases appears after
three months.

Conclusions:Understanding the trajectories of PTSD over time, and how it may vary by type of traumatic event (intentional
vs. non-intentional) will assist public health planning and treatment.

Introduction

Longitudinal studies of responses to traumatic events document
the course of illness and recovery in trauma-exposed populations
confirming, as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) has
written, that posttraumatic stress disorder has a variable course
that can be acute or chronic, remitting after only three months,
delayed after six months, or lasting for years. Other studies have
longitudinally examined the effectiveness of treatment interven-
tions [1,2], which highlight the advantage of early intervention to
shorten the time to remission of symptoms. Data from control
groups in these intervention studies often also reveal the natural
course of PTSD. Studies using DSM-IV criteria have followed

subjects to examine the epidemiology of PTSD after disasters
[3,4,5,6], other traumatic events [7,8,9], and military deployment
[10,11], again finding substantial variability across different
populations, traumatic events and community contexts. Knowing
patterns of response after traumatic events can inform health
system interventions after a disaster or traumatic event.

The proposed DSM-5 criteria highlight the importance of direct
exposure as a specific category of traumatic experience and serve
to narrow variation in the application of
this criterion [12].
Experiences

witnessing a traumatic event [13]. A number of studies have
examined broad classifications of trauma exposures,
including
natural vs. human-made and intentional vs. non-intentional
[14,15,16,17]. The importance of differences between intentional
and non-intentional traumatic events has been explored when
examining treatment efficacy and attrition. Intentional traumas
are those that involve the deliberate infliction of harm, and those
exposed to intentional
traumatic events had worse health
outcomes than those who experienced harm that was inadvertent
[18,19,20].

In order to better understand the course of PTSD during the
first year after exposure, we conducted a systematic review of the
empirical literature. We identified longitudinal studies reporting
the prevalence of untreated PTSD in the same cohort or in a
nationally representative sample, at two or more points in time
within one year after direct exposure to a traumatic event that met
the proposed DSM-5 criterion. We examined the longitudinal
prevalence of PTSD in exposed populations, as well as the course
of illness and recovery for individuals experiencing PTSD (early
onset, later onset, chronicity, remission and resilience) in the first
year after trauma exposure. This paper provides PTSD prevalence
in prevalence between
estimates,
intentional and non-intentional traumas, which may inform our
understanding of both prognosis and recovery, as well as have
implications for public health treatment needs.

Search Criteria

We reviewed the published literature from January 1, 1998 to
December 31, 2010 for longitudinal studies of populations directly
exposed to traumatic events. We chose 1998 to begin our review in
order to update the literature since the review by Breslau et al
(1998). We used the DSM-5 criteria for direct exposure PTSD to
define a traumatic event and included studies published in English
that measured PTSD prevalence using validated measures at two
or more time points within twelve months post-trauma. Because
we sought to identify patterns in the natural course of responses
and recovery, we excluded studies
received
treatment or other interventions, unless data from a control group
were available. In addition, studies were excluded if they failed to
meet the one-month duration criterion,
if they measured only
PTSD symptoms and not disorder, if the population of interest was
children or adolescents under 18 years old, or if
the study
identified pregnancy or childbirth as a traumatic event (unless it
was specified as a complicated or extraordinary event such as
miscarriage). Finally, studies were excluded if the PTSD preva-
lence was not reported directly or was reported in a way that could
not be calculated.

Our search strategy for this review involved three stages. First,
we used PubMed and PILOTS databases to find abstracts using
keyword combinations that
the
following: ‘longitudinal’, ‘acute’ and ‘chronic’, and key authors
known to have conducted extensive research on the course of
PTSD. Second, the citations were cross-referenced to eliminate
duplicates prior to reviewing abstracts. Third, 2537 unique
abstracts were reviewed. Those that explicitly stated inclusion
criteria or provided information suggesting that the article may
meet inclusion criteria were marked for further review.

Analysis

In some studies, the desired information (prevalence of PTSD in
the same cohort or in a representative sample at two or more time
points) was not directly presented in the article. When possible,

PTSD Prevalence and Trajectories

that information was calculated using other data presented in the
article. In some cases, approximations were used to estimate time.
For example, if a range of 4–8 months was provided for a time
point, the midpoint (6 months) was used as the time point for the
purpose of examining the course of illness for PTSD. Different
articles with the same subject populations were combined as single
studies. We grouped the data for each study into categories of 1, 3,
6, and 12 months post-trauma to allow comparison across studies
and over time. Because the data are not symmetrically distributed,
medians better represent the average values and were calculated at
each of these time points.

All of the studies met the proposed DSM-5 criterion A. That is,
the subject experienced ‘‘…one of the following event(s): death or
threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or
threatened sexual violence...’’ [12]. To better understand the
relationship between the nature of the traumatic event and the
course of PTSD, we classified the traumatic events into either
intentional (e.g., assault, war) or non-intentional (e.g., earthquake,
motor vehicle accident). This classification yielded 14 intentional
and 21 non-intentional traumatic event studies.

Of

(N = 7), and serious,

the 2537 identified articles, 58 articles representing 35
unique subject populations met criteria of being assessed for PTSD
at two or more time points within 12 months of a traumatic event
and met the proposed DSM-5 criteria for experiencing a direct
traumatic event. Those 35 populations were analyzed for this
review (Table S1). The trauma exposures include: motor vehicle/
plane crash (N = 8 studies), assault (N = 4), terrorism (N = 7), war
as a combatant or civilian (N = 3), natural disaster (N = 4), severe
injury warranting a hospital visit
life-
threatening medical condition (N = 2). For our analysis of
trajectories, we identified studies that included a report of PTSD
assessed in individual subjects in at least two time points within a
year. This made possible identifying the course of PTSD in
individual subjects. Among our examined studies, five of the 14

calculation of the trajectories of PTSD within individuals. These
studies reported PTSD at two different time points, where Time 1
was 1 to 1.5 months (4–6 weeks) post-trauma, and Time 2 was 3 to
12 months post trauma. Data was not sufficient to perform parallel
analyses for non-intentional trauma. We calculated the percent of
individuals who were never diagnosed with PTSD (were resilient),
achieved remission during the first year, had a late onset of PTSD,
and those who experienced chronic symptoms of PTSD.

Results

Longitudinal Prevalence of PTSD by Trauma Type

We examined medians of the PTSD prevalence at each time
point (Table 1). In general, the trend of the means and medians
are similar. The median prevalence of PTSD across all studies
decreases from 28.8% (range = 3.1–87.5%) at 1 month to 17.0%
(range = 0.6–43.8%) at 12 months (see Table 1). There is a drop
in PTSD median prevalence between month 1 (28.8%) and month
3 (17.8%), after which the median prevalence appears to stabilize.
These prevalences are similar to previously published rates across
different types of traumatic events [14,15,21,22].

Examination of PTSD prevalence across time (1, 3, 6 and
12 months) in the different traumatic event categories shows some
differences by category (see Table 1). The trend in PTSD
prevalence among those exposed to a non-intentional trauma is
decreasing over time (30.1% at month 1 and 14.0% at month 12).
The intentional trauma group shows a different course with the
median prevalences increasing from 11.8% to 23.3%. This is

time (Figure 1).

Trajectory of PTSD

Of

individuals exposed to intentional

traumatic events, a
median of 37.1% (range 6.5–87.5%) developed PTSD in the first
year after exposure (Table 2). Therefore, 62.9% (range 12.5–
93.5%) never developed PTSD. Among the exposed, a median of
12.9% (range 1.7–43.8%) had PTSD only at Time 1. This
represents 34.8% of those ever diagnosed. Similarly, a median of
14.5% had PTSD at both Time 1 and Time 2 (39.0% of those
diagnosed with PTSD) and 1.3% had PTSD onset after Time 1
(3.5% of those diagnosed with PTSD).

Discussion

Overall, we found that when we separated intentional and non-
intentional trauma, two population courses were suggested for the
prevalence of PTSD across time. The prevalence of PTSD
increased over
traumatic events and
decreased after non-intentional traumatic events, indicating the
overall public health burden of PTSD was greater in those exposed
to intentional traumatic events. Of note, at one month, non-

time after

and 21 studies, respectively).

intentional traumatic events had a higher median prevalence of
PTSD than intentional
trauma. For public health planning,
recognizing that the type of the traumatic event may mean a
different natural course of
the disorder can affect resource
planning and treatment.

In order to examine the trajectory of PTSD, we examined
studies of populations that had directly experienced traumatic
events as listed in DSM-5, which are the most studied in the
existing literature. Other proposed A criteria (i.e., witnessing an
event,
learning of an event, or experiencing repeated indirect
exposures) may yield other courses and trajectories. There were
only a small number of studies that met our criteria for addressing
individual trajectories of PTSD over time, and all of these were for
intentional
traumatic events. The trajectories of PTSD after
intentional traumatic events show wide variability, but on average,
approximately one-third of those exposed developed PTSD in the
first year. Importantly, nearly two-thirds did not. Among those
with PTSD, about one third remitted within 3 months, while 39%
of those with PTSD had a chronic course, supporting the notion
that PTSD can spontaneously resolve or continue as a persistent
disorder. Onset of PTSD after 3 months represented a small
fraction (3.5%) of the total PTSD cases. Nevertheless, a ‘‘delayed
expression’’ specifier to the diagnosis is supported by the data.

Our study did not examine predictors or risk factors that may
modulate the different courses of PTSD in populations related to
intentional and non-intentional exposures. These include genetic,
dispositional, and recovery environment factors. Specifically, the
types of populations exposed to intentional and non-intentional
traumas can differ substantially in characteristics and contextual
issues, due to socioeconomic factors, employment, cultural
differences, and available resources. These factors can substan-
tially contribute to the different courses of PTSD. A recent study of
PTSD that examined multiple studies across different disaster
types similarly found differences in rates of PTSD between
intentional and non-intentional disasters (26% in ‘‘intentionally
caused’’ disasters compared to 10% and 16% in ‘‘technological’’
and ‘‘natural’’ disasters, respectively). However, the differences
were not present after controlling for pre-disaster conditions and
sample characteristics [22]. This is consistent with our findings and
suggests that the difference in outcomes between intentional and
non-intentional traumatic events is mediated by the severity of
exposure, the characteristics of the populations exposed, and the
recovery environment.

Few studies have followed participants for more than a year and
with more than two assessments. This is unfortunate since it limits

what one can investigate. For example, in the 20-year longitudinal
study of Israeli veterans of the Lebanon War, which delineates the
diagnostic patterns of 214 veterans at 1, 2, 3, and 20 years [23], a
fluctuating course of PTSD (e.g., a variable pattern of remissions
and relapses) was detected along with the remitting, persistent and
delayed courses observed in the present study. In addition, studies
of different disaster types and across cultures may yield different
PTSD trajectories [24,25,26].

This study is limited by the relatively few studies available with
longitudinal data. Our study is also focused only on directly
experienced traumatic events. The broad set of categories
originally delineated by the 1996 Detroit-area survey studying
trauma and PTSD in the community [14] grouped events as
‘‘assault,’’ ‘‘other injury or shocking experience,’’ ‘‘learning about
trauma to others,’’ or ‘‘sudden unexpected death of a close friend
or relative.’’ The latter two categories exemplify indirect traumatic
exposure and, therefore, were not included in this review. In
contrast, the two former categories map onto our broader terms of
intentional and non-intentional traumatic events so they were
included. This study also examined the literature from a specific
13-year period when the DSM-IV definition of PTSD was in use.
We considered possible bias in the data in the studies we
examined. Psychiatric epidemiology studies consistently report a
lifetime prevalence of PTSD of approximately 8% [15,16,17],
however, post-disaster rates of PTSD vary widely [27,28,29], and
are similar to those found here. One could expect measurement
bias in our study because of the different instruments used to
obtain data in the different studies. However, this would not

further explore our finding of an increasing rate of PTSD in

tics, the degree of exposure and the context would be helpful.
Systematically including this information in future studies will be
required to address these issues.

Our results indicate that the type of events, whether being
intentional or non-intentional, appear to affect both the prevalence
of PTSD and its trajectories over time. Our findings reinforce the
importance of longitudinal research in understanding the course,
prognosis, and severity of PTSD. Such information is valuable for
planning and implementing appropriate individual and population
level interventions.
