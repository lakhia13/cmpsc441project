Abstract

Background: Neuroimaging studies reveal structural and functional including neurochemical 
brain abnormalities in individuals with substance use disorders compared to healthy controls. 
However, whether and to what extent such dysfunction is reversible with abstinence remains 
unclear, and a review of studies with longitudinal within-subject designs is lacking. We performed 
a systematic review of longitudinal neuroimaging studies to explore putative brain changes 
associated with abstinence in treatment-seeking individuals with substance use disorders.

Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we examined articles published up to May 2021 that 
employed a neuroimaging technique and assessed neurobiological recovery in treatment-seeking 
participants at a minimum of two time-points separated by a period of abstinence (longer than 24 
hours apart) or significant reduction in drug use.

Results: Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria. Encouragingly, in this limited but growing 
literature, the majority of studies demonstrated at least partial neurobiological recovery with 
abstinence. Structural recovery appeared to occur predominantly in frontal cortical regions, the 
insula, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Functional and neurochemical recovery was similarly 
observed in prefrontal cortical regions but also in subcortical structures. The onset of structural 
recovery appears to precede neurochemical recovery, which begins soon after cessation 
(particularly for alcohol); functional recovery may require longer periods of abstinence.

Conclusions: The literature is still growing and more studies are warranted to better understand 
abstinence-mediated neural recovery in individuals with substance use disorders. Elucidating 
the temporal dynamics between neuronal recovery and abstinence will enable evidence-based 
planning for more effective and targeted treatment of substance use disorders, potentially 
preempting relapse.

1. 

INTRODUCTION

Substance use disorders (SUD) are chronically relapsing disorders. They are characterized 
by compulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors despite a decrease in the pleasure 
derived from the drug and harmful or even catastrophic consequences. Impairments 
in response inhibition and salience attribution, functions of the prefrontal cortex, are 
hypothesized to contribute to the cycle of addiction (Goldstein and Volkow, 2002, 2011). 
Indeed, neuroimaging studies provide reliable evidence for structural and functional 
including neurochemical abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and numerous other cortical 
and subcortical brain regions with chronic exposure to substances of abuse, irrespective of 
the specific drug consumed (Chang et al., 2007; Ende et al., 2013; Ersche et al., 2013; Fritz 
et al., 2014; Luijten et al., 2017; Moselhy et al., 2001; Sullivan and Pfefferbaum, 2005). 
Importantly, these alterations often parallel changes in cognitive functioning (Chanraud 
et al., 2007; Moreno-Lopez et al., 2012), affective symptoms (London et al., 2004), and 
treatment outcomes (Rando et al., 2011) implying a clinically significant impact.

However, whether these neurobiological changes associated with long-term substance use 
are permanent or recover with abstinence has been a matter of debate. Commonly, studies 
investigating the potential for human brain recovery with abstinence compare data from 
a group of current substance users with those from abstainers (i.e., former users) as well 
as to those from healthy volunteers. Although necessary (to explore such between-group 
effects), these cross-sectional studies are often confounded by between-subject variability 
(e.g., comorbid drug use or mood symptoms) and preclude the possibility of teasing 
apart pre-existing vulnerabilities (e.g., traits and/or environmental insults associated with 
greater likelihood of drug consumption) from the effects of chronic drug use. Moreover, 
cross-sectional studies have a propensity for both Type I (reporting false positives) and Type 
II errors (driven by lack of power/statistical sensitivity to detect subtle changes) due to small 
sample sizes. In contrast, designs that use longitudinal data can control for within-subject 
variability (each subject serves as their own control while their brain outcomes are measured 
repeatedly over time) and provide greater statistical power. These designs allow for a more 
direct examination of change while accounting for (at least some of) the extraneous variables 
that may contribute to results.

Although changes in brain structure and function including neurochemistry during 
abstinence have previously been reviewed (see Charlet et al., 2018; Moeller and Paulus,

2018 for recent reviews), the current manuscript uniquely focuses on longitudinal 
neuroimaging studies that examined within-subject brain changes between early and 
protracted abstinence in treatment-seeking humans with SUDs. Appropriate within-subject 
modeling of brain changes with abstinence is critical for a better understanding of the 
neurobiological trajectory that may help identify mechanisms associated with sustained 
long-term abstinence or with the propensity for relapse. Importantly, these results may also 
help to identify vital individualized predictors of, and targets for, timely prevention and 
treatment to enhance recovery and reduce the chronically relapsing nature of drug addiction.

2.  METHODS

We performed a systematic literature search to identify neuroimaging studies investigating 
the effects of alcohol/drug abstinence on brain structure, function, and neurochemistry. 
First, we searched Pubmed using a search term that included (“magnetic resonance 
imaging” OR “MRI” OR “functional magnetic resonance imaging” OR “fMRI” OR 
“diffusion tensor imaging” OR “DTI” OR “positron emission tomography” OR “PET” OR 
“electroencephalography” OR “EEG” OR “magnetic resonance spectroscopy” OR “MRS” 
OR “single photon emission computed tomography” OR “SPECT”). These terms were 
combined with a term related to SUDs (“substance use disorder” OR “addiction” OR 
“dependence” OR “drug abuse” OR “alcohol” OR “cocaine” OR “crack” OR “speed” OR 
“methamphetamine” OR “amphetamine” OR “opioids” OR “heroin” OR “hallucinogens” 
OR “MDMA” OR “ecstasy” OR “mushrooms” OR “ketamine” OR “sedative” OR “tobacco” 
OR “nicotine” OR “cannabis” OR “marijuana”) as well as with a term referring to 
abstinence or treatment (“abstinence” OR “cessation” OR “treatment” OR “recovery”; note 
we did not use the term “relapse” because our focus was on the effects of recovery based 
on abstinence or significant reduction in drug use). The initial search was limited to full text 
articles and studies published in English, in a peer-reviewed journal in any year and were 
assessed using Endnote X9 following the PRISMA guidelines.

This initial database search yielded 7,749 records, and included studies published up to 
May 2021. Titles and abstracts from all articles identified through the search were screened. 
Articles were excluded for being non-relevant (i.e., not related to SUD), case studies, 
reviews (i.e., literature or systematic), clinical trials (since they examine the impact of 
a treatment intervention and not of abstinence-mediated recovery, which is the focus of 
this review), meta-analyses and/or non-human research. A total of 106 articles remained 
and were assessed more closely for eligibility. Full text articles and studies adhering to 
the following criteria were included; (1) employed a neuroimaging technique; (2) assessed 
participants at a minimum of two time-points with an inter-scan duration of greater than 
24 hours, separated by a period of abstinence or significant reduction in drug use; (3) SUD 
sample at the first follow-up was at least n=10; and (4) participants were defined as seeking 
treatment for SUD. Forty-five studies met eligibility criteria (Figure 1). We summarized the 
imaging modalities, brain regions, abstinence period prior to any of the scans, statistical 
analysis thresholds, and within-subject changes in structural, functional, and neurochemical 
outcomes (emerging during the defined abstinence period) in Table 1.

3.  STRUCTURAL STUDIES

Abnormalities in brain structure are well documented in individuals with SUD (Mackey et 
al., 2019). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the detection of subtle variations 
in the volume and shape of cortical and subcortical regions as well as cortical thickness, 
area and folding patterns (Ashburner and Friston, 2000). Voxel-based morphometry is a 
technique that segments brain images into gray matter (GM) volume, white matter (WM) 
volume, and cerebrospinal fluid to index neuroanatomical abnormalities (Ashburner and 
Friston, 2000). Although both GM and WM can be assessed using this method, changes 
in WM integrity are evaluated more accurately using imaging techniques, such as diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI), which provides more subtle information about tissue microstructure 
and organization (Jones et al., 2013; Whitwell, 2009). Common measures computed from 
DTI are fractional anisotropy, an indicator of WM track myelination (Nucifora et al., 2007), 
radial diffusivity, a marker of myelin integrity (Harsan et al., 2006), mean diffusivity, a 
marker of the magnitude of (isotropic) water diffusivity, and axial diffusivity, a marker of the 
magnitude of diffusion parallel to the fiber tracts.

3.1  Alcohol

3.1.1  Gray Matter—Structural changes have reliably been reported in individuals with 
alcohol use disorders (AUD) who have achieved abstinence. Using a regions of interest 
(ROI) approach in 49 alcohol-dependent patients, van Eijk et al., (2013) revealed GM 
volume increases in several brain regions including the cingulate gyrus, insula, temporal 
gyrus, precuneus, parietal lobule, and cerebellum following 2 weeks of abstinence (van Eijk 
et al., 2013). These results were partially supported by a more recent study that used a 
whole-brain approach to investigate GM volume recovery in 62 individuals with AUD (Bach 
et al., 2020). Here, GM volume increased in the middle and inferior frontal gyri, middle 
cingulate gyrus, insula, supramarginal gyrus, and precuneus from approximately 12 days of 
abstinence to 27 days. Cortical thickness measures show a similar pattern (Wang et al., 2016; 
Bach et al., 2020). Specifically, in the first 2 weeks of abstinence in 49 alcohol-dependent 
individuals increased cortical thickness was observed in the medial orbitofrontal cortex 
(OFC), middle frontal, superior frontal, rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), cuneus, and 
inferior parietal and lateral occipital regions; greater cortical thickness recovery in sulci 
compared to gyri, particularly for frontal regions, suggested that sulci may be more sensitive 
than gyri to excessive alcohol consumption and abstinence-induced recovery (Wang et al., 
2016). The Bach et al., (2020) study similarly reported increases primarily in frontal regions 
encompassing the superior frontal cortices, lateral OFC, and rostral middle frontal cortex, 
and in the insula and lateral occipital cortex in 62 alcohol-dependent individuals. In general, 
in these studies, GM (volume and/or thickness) increased in brain regions that showed 
reductions when individuals with AUD were compared to healthy controls.

When studies investigated abstinence durations of a least 4 weeks, increases in frontal 
regions became more apparent. For example, increased frontal GM volume (but not parietal, 
temporal or occipital) was found in 42 individuals with AUD following 4 weeks of 
abstinence (Durazzo et al., 2017). A study from the same group showed that differences 
between individuals with AUD and controls in GM volume in frontal regions, such as

the OFC (but not the rostral anterior cingulate cortex or insula) observed at one week of 
abstinence dissipated following 4 weeks of abstinence; yet within-subject frontal changes 
did not achieve significance when examined longitudinally (Durazzo and Meyerhoff, 2020). 
Interestingly, following 5 weeks of abstinence, Mon and colleagues (2013) reported that in 
41 alcohol-dependent individuals, GM volume increases in the frontal lobe were genotype-
specific for a polymorphism (Val66Met) in the neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) (Mon et al., 2013). Given that BDNF supports the survival of neurons and 
promotes neurogenesis in the brain (Lu and Chow, 1999), it has clear relevance to GM 
volume recovery. Specifically, relative to Val/Val carriers, Met carriers have a significant 
reduction (~30%) in BDNF secretion, which may compromise their potential for GM 
volume recovery (Chen et al., 2008). Indeed, while some GM changes were observed with 
abstinence in alcohol-dependent individuals who were Val/Met carriers (n=15) (increased 
GM volume in the cerebellum exclusively in this group and increases in the temporal lobe 
in both genotype groups), only those who were Val/Val carriers (n=26) had increased frontal 
GM volume following abstinence (Mon et al., 2013). There were also GM volume increases 
in the parietal lobe and the thalamus, and decreased GM volume in the caudate, again 
exclusive to Val/Val carriers. Of note, collapsed across genotype group, increases in frontal 
and parietal GM volume were related to improvement in working memory, with the latter 
also associated with improvement in processing speed, and increases in all cortical and 
subcortical GM were related to improvement in visuospatial learning (Mon et al., 2013).

Significant recovery in frontal GM volume, including in the OFC, was observed in 
investigations following 4 and 7 months of abstinence. Demirakca et al., (2011) showed 
increases in GM volume in the OFC, as well as the cingulate gyrus, and insula after 4 
months of abstinence in 14 alcohol-dependent individuals (Demirakca et al., 2011), while 
Cardenas et al., (2007) demonstrated increased GM volume in the OFC and parietal lobes 
following 7 months of abstinence in 17 alcohol-dependent individuals (Cardenas et al., 
2007).

Many studies have adopted an ROI approach to specifically examine the hippocampus, 
a structure that is highly susceptible to neuronal injury (Geddes et al., 2003) but also 
possesses high potential for neuronal plasticity and regeneration (Leuner and Gould, 2010). 
Studies have reported increased hippocampal GM volume following 2 weeks (Kuhn et al., 
2014), 4 weeks (Gazdzinski et al., 2008), and 7.5 months of abstinence (Zou et al., 2018). 
Interestingly, similarly to Mon et al., (2013), Hoefer et al., (2014) reported a trend towards 
increased hippocampal volume following 7 months of abstinence in Val/Val but not Met/Val 
carriers or controls (Hoefer et al., 2014). Differences from healthy control participants even 
after this abstinence duration (reduced hippocampal volumes in the AUD) suggest only 
partial recovery of the hippocampus (Hoefer et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2018). Encouragingly, 
better visuospatial processing (Hoefer et al., 2014) and visual short- and long-term memory 
(Gazdzinski et al., 2008) were observed even with only partial hippocampal recovery. In 
contrast, other studies have reported no change in hippocampal volume early in abstinence 
[2 weeks (van Eijk et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016)] or with longer periods of abstinence 
[4 months (Demirakca et al., 2011)]. Similarly no significant changes in GM volume 
were found in several other subcortical regions examined as ROIs, such as the amygdala 
(Demirakca et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2018) and putamen/lenticular nucleus

(Durazzo et al., 2015; Mon et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016) following abstinence; results 
observed in the caudate were mixed (Durazzo et al., 2015; Mon et al., 2013; Wang et al., 
2016).

Investigations that include more than two time-points provide a window into the trajectory/
slope of brain volume recovery over abstinence. Overall, results in individuals with AUD 
suggest that over protracted abstinence (~ 1 year), the majority of GM volume recovery 
occurs within the first month of abstinence (Durazzo et al., 2015; Gazdzinski et al., 
2005; Pfefferbaum et al., 1995). A large cohort scanned over three time-points (n=82 at 
1 week and 1 month; and n=36 at 7.5 months) demonstrated increased GM volumes in 
the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes, thalamus, caudate, and cerebellum over 7.5 months 
of abstinence with greater increases occurring between 1 week and 1 month of abstinence 
compared to 1 month and 7.5 months of abstinence (specifically for frontal and parietal 
lobes, thalamus, and cerebellum) (Durazzo et al., 2015). With the exception of GM volume 
in the thalamus, these changes over the 7.5 month of abstinence were associated with better 
processing speed, a relationship that was only evident in non-smoking individuals (n=18) 
and did not extend to smokers with AUD (n=18) (Durazzo et al., 2015). Interestingly, a 
follow-up study in a similar cohort and similar time points (n=65 at 1 week; n=82 at 1 
month; and n=36 at 7.5 months; 23 participants had no/unusable data from 1 week of 
abstinence and thus were first assessed at 1 month of abstinence) revealed that the rate of 
recovery may be region-specific (Zou et al., 2018). Specifically, whereas the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), OFC, and insula showed greater increases in GM volume within 
the first month of abstinence relative to 1 week and 7.5 months, the ACC increased only 
between 1 month and 7.5 months of abstinence. Together, these studies indicate that GM 
volume recovery follows a nonlinear trajectory (i.e., steeper slope earlier in recovery) that 
may vary region by region (Durazzo et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2018).

3.1.2  White Matter—Studies using voxel-based morphometry to index morphological 
abnormalities in WM have reported mixed results, perhaps because of this technique’s 
limited sensitivity to quantifying WM volume. Mon et al., (2013) observed increased WM 
volume in the frontal lobes (and trends for the parietal and temporal lobes) in Val/Met 
carriers of the BDNF gene following 5 weeks of abstinence. Given the GM findings and 
BDNF’s contributions as described above, this unexpected finding remains to be replicated 
in larger sample sizes. Following 4 months of abstinence, two studies reported increased 
total WM volume (Demirakca et al., 2011; Shear et al., 1994), while following 7.5 months 
of abstinence, another study demonstrated increased WM volume specifically in the parietal, 
temporal, and occipital lobes, with the predominance of recovery occurring between 1 and 
7.5 months (Durazzo et al., 2015). In contrast, other studies have reported no changes in 
regional WM volume following 7 months of abstinence (Cardenas et al., 2007) or in total 
WM volume following 2 weeks (van Eijk et al., 2013), 4 weeks (Durazzo et al., 2017) and 
12 months of abstinence (Pfefferbaum et al., 1995).

Using diffusion tensor imaging, the pattern of results is more consistent. Following one 
month of abstinence, Gazdzinski et al., (2010) observed increased fractional anisotropy in 
the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and a decrease in mean diffusivity in the 
temporal lobe in non-smoking in alcohol-dependent individuals (n=10), an effect not present

in alcohol-dependent smokers (n=11) (Gazdzinski et al., 2010), suggesting that smoking 
may selectively affect WM microstructure and recovery in alcohol-dependent individuals. 
Increased fractional anisotropy and reduced radial diffusivity were seen in the genu and 
body of the corpus callosum during the first year of abstinence in 15 alcohol-dependent 
individuals (Alhassoon et al., 2012). Although not directly correlated with the diffusion 
metrics, significant improvements in working memory at follow-up were noted in these 
subjects. Increased fractional anisotropy in multiple brain areas (20 out of 27 ROIs assessed, 
including the corpus collosum, the fornix, and corona radiata) was also observed over a 
follow-up period of up to 8 years in individuals with alcohol dependence (Pfefferbaum et al., 
2014).

3.2  Stimulants and Opioids

A study from our group investigated regional GM volume recovery in 19 abstinent 
individuals with cocaine use disorder who either achieved abstinence or significantly 
reduced their cocaine use from baseline (≥ 3 weeks after last drug use) to 6 month follow-up 
(Parvaz et al., 2016a). Using a whole-brain approach, we demonstrated that GM volume 
increased in the ventromedial PFC, OFC and inferior frontal gyrus with the latter increases 
associated with improvements in cognitive flexibility and decision-making measured by the 
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Iowa Gambling Task, respectively (Parvaz et al., 2016a). 
In another whole-brain study examining individuals with methamphetamine use (n=29), 
cerebellar GM volume increased, but the cingulate gyrus GM volumes decreased, from 6 
months to 12 months of abstinence (Ruan et al., 2018). Over a similar timeframe, Zhuang et 
al., (2016) showed that compared with baseline (at a 6 months abstinence), individuals with 
methamphetamine use had continued fractional anisotropy reductions in the internal capsule 
and superior corona radiata at 13 months of abstinence (Zhuang et al., 2016).

To date only two studies used a longitudinal design to investigate structural recovery 
in individuals with an opioid use disorder. Employing a whole-brain approach, Wang 
et al., (2012b) examined the effects of one month of abstinence (compared to a 3 day 
abstinent scan) in 20 treatment-seeking males with heroin use disorder. While there were 
no significant longitudinal improvements, the superior frontal gyrus GM abnormalities (as 
compared to healthy controls) that were documented after 3 days of abstinence were not 
detectable following one month of abstinence (abnormalities in the other cortical regions, 
including the middle frontal gyrus, persisted) (Wang, X. et al., 2012). Similarly, although 
white matter showed no within-subject longitudinal changes with abstinence, abnormalities 
in fractional anisotropy in the frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus that were evident after 3 
days of abstinence were no longer detectable following one month of abstinence (Wang, X. 
et al., 2013).

3.3 

Interim Summary

Among individuals with AUD, GM volume recovery following abstinence was 
predominantly assessed via an ROI approach with findings generally indicating increased 
GM volume in cortical regions spanning the frontal (Cardenas et al., 2007; Demirakca et 
al., 2011; Durazzo et al., 2017; Durazzo et al., 2015; Gazdzinski et al., 2005; Mon et al., 
2013; Pfefferbaum et al., 1995; van Eijk et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2018) and temporal, parietal,

and occipital lobes (Cardenas et al., 2007; Durazzo et al., 2015; Mon et al., 2013; van Eijk 
et al., 2013) as well as the insula (Bach et al., 2020; Demirakca et al., 2011; van Eijk et 
al., 2013; Zou et al., 2018). Increases were also noted in the hippocampus (Gazdzinski et 
al., 2005; Gazdzinski et al., 2008; Hoefer et al., 2014; Kuhn et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2018), 
thalamus (Durazzo et al., 2015; Mon et al., 2013), and cerebellum (Durazzo et al., 2015; 
Gazdzinski et al., 2005; Mon et al., 2013; van Eijk et al., 2013) but not in the caudate 
[where mixed results were reported (Durazzo et al., 2015; Mon et al., 2013; Wang et al., 
2016)] and lentiform nucleus/putamen (Durazzo et al., 2015; Mon et al., 2013; Wang et al., 
2016). Encouragingly, GM recovery occurred as early as 2 weeks post-cessation in select 
regions (Kuhn et al., 2014; van Eijk et al., 2013) and multi-time point studies suggest that 
the majority of GM recovery occurs within the first month of abstinence (Durazzo et al., 
2015; Gazdzinski et al., 2005; Pfefferbaum et al., 1995; Zou et al., 2018). These changes 
are associated with improved cognitive function and may be more discernable in certain 
subgroups of individuals (e.g., with select genes and/or non-smokers).

Given the paucity of studies investigating WM, the general pattern of its recovery remains 
unclear. While studies using non-DTI methods report both regional and global increases 
(Demirakca et al., 2011; Durazzo et al., 2015; Mon et al., 2013; Shear et al., 1994), as well 
as some mixed findings, DTI studies more consistently point to increased WM integrity (as 
measured by fractional anisotropy) of the corpus collosum following abstinence (Alhassoon 
et al., 2012; Pfefferbaum et al., 2014).

The majority of the above reviewed studies have been conducted in individuals with 
AUD following abstinence. Only a handful of studies have examined structural recovery 
in individuals with substance use disorders other than alcohol including stimulant and 
opioid use disorder, and no study has investigated structural recovery in treatment-seeking 
marijuana users. Future research that addresses structural changes associated with these 
substances following abstinence is clearly warranted.

4.  FUNCTIONAL STUDIES

Human brain function is commonly assessed using imaging modalities such as functional 
MRI (fMRI) and psychophysiological tools such as electroencephalography (EEG). 
Functional MRI measures local changes in cerebral blood flow and brain metabolism 
using the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is an indirect measure of 
neural activity that relies on a cascade of physiological events linking neural activity in 
specific brain regions to the MRI signal. Electroencephalography assesses electrical signals 
with high temporal resolution, allowing to track human brain function in almost real time, 
although it is limited by poor spatial resolution. These techniques provide an evaluation 
of how the brain works dynamically, its physiology, regional connectivity and functional 
architecture either during rest or in response to specific stimuli. Accordingly, these tools can 
index neural changes and reorganization that are associated with cessation of or reduction in 
substance use in individuals with SUD.

Page 9

In contrast to the numerous structural neuroimaging studies, to date there have only been 
a few neuroimaging studies that examined longitudinal changes in brain function during 
abstinence in AUD. Mon et al. (2009) used arterial spin labeling to examine longitudinal 
cerebral blood flow changes after 1 month of sobriety relative to baseline (one week of 
abstinence) in individuals with AUD (n=41) as compared to light social drinkers (n=13). 
Similarly to the GM volume results reported above, at baseline and compared to the light 
drinkers, individuals with AUD showed lower cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal 
GM. Longitudinally, although there were no significant changes with abstinence in the entire 
sample of individuals with AUD, recovery (i.e., increase to the level of light social drinkers) 
in frontal and parietal GM cerebral blood flow was observed only in non-smoking AUD 
(n=19) but not in the smokers (n=22) (Mon et al., 2009). A subsequent study from the 
same group divided the 41 individuals with AUD to those who remained abstinent (n=19) 
vs. those who relapsed (n=22) at 12-months follow-up; here again, although there were no 
longitudinal changes across the entire group, recovery in cerebral blood flow was observed 
in those who maintained abstinence but not in those who relapsed (Durazzo et al., 2010). 
Taken together, these two studies suggest that longitudinal recovery between 1 week and 1 
month of abstinence in cerebral blood flow can be observed in non-smoking AUD and/or 
those who can maintain abstinence.

Further evidence of functional recovery in abstaining alcohol users (n=15) is provided by 
an EEG study that reported recovery of sleep evoked potentials, recorded from frontal 
electrodes, after a longer-term (>12 months) abstinence (Colrain et al., 2012). These sleep 
evoked potentials (mainly the K-complex comprised of the N550 and P900 amplitudes), 
previously reported to be reduced in individuals with AUD as compared to healthy controls 
by the same group (Colrain et al., 2009), reflect the functional integrity of the underlying 
cortex (Colrain, 2005; Tononi and Cirelli, 2006), also representing memory consolidation 
(Poe et al., 2010).

4.2  Nicotine and Cocaine

In a longitudinal fMRI cue-reactivity study, Janes et al, (2009) reported an increase in fMRI 
BOLD activity in prefrontal, temporal and parietal regions in response to smoking-related 
relative to neutral pictures in 13 tobacco-dependent individuals from a pre-cessation baseline 
to about 1–2 months of abstinence (52 ± 11 days). These results suggest that reactivity to 
substance-related cues increased during the early phase of abstinence, which is consistent 
with the trajectory of incubation of cue-reactivity (or craving) as has previously been shown 
in individuals with other types of SUD using self-reported (Bedi et al., 2011; Li et al., 2015; 
Wang, G. et al., 2013; Wang, G.B. et al., 2012) and EEG correlates of (Parvaz et al., 2016b) 
cue-induced craving.

Two fMRI studies investigated longitudinal changes as a function of abstinence duration in 
individuals with cocaine use disorders, both reporting improved activation in the midbrain 
and the thalamus. In the first study we used a monetarily rewarded drug Stroop task and 
showed decreased fMRI BOLD activation (overall task versus baseline) in the midbrain 
of 15 treatment-seeking cocaine-addicted individuals compared to 13 non-addicted healthy

controls at baseline (after detoxification; ≥ 3 weeks after last drug use). After about 6 
months of mostly abstinence/substantially reduced drug use, the fMRI BOLD signal in 
cocaine-addicted individuals was comparable to that in non-addicted healthy controls at 
baseline. We interpreted these results to suggest a restoration of dopaminergic activity, 
supported by correlations with reduced drug-seeking behavior in these subjects (Moeller 
et al., 2012). The later study by Balodis et al. (2016) used the Monetary Incentive Delay 
task (Knutson et al., 2000) in a larger sample of cocaine-addicted individuals (n=29) and 
non-addicted healthy controls (n=28), to show similar increases from approximately 2 to 5 
months of abstinence in the midbrain and the thalamus, and in the posterior cingulate cortex 
and the precuneus. Notably, the increase in midbrain activity correlated positively with 
abstinence duration at follow-up (Balodis et al., 2016). Taken together these results suggest 
that recovery in the midbrain and thalamus in response to salient reward-relevant tasks is 
associated with better clinical outcomes (i.e., reduced drug seeking and longer abstinence 
duration).

Using EEG, our group focused on the late positive potential (an event-related potential 
observed typically at centroparietal recording sites and indicative of bottom-up attentional 
change) to report that motivated attention to pleasant cues, which was lower at baseline 
(after detoxification; ≥ 3 weeks after last drug use) in 19 treatment-seeking cocaine-addicted 
individuals compared to healthy controls, increased with six months of significantly reduced 
cocaine use (Parvaz et al., 2017). This increase in reactivity to pleasant cues correlated 
with longer duration of abstinence at baseline and with decreased craving at follow-up. 
Nevertheless, reactivity to pleasant cues in the cocaine-addicted individuals at follow-up was 
still lower than that in healthy controls at baseline, suggesting only a partial recovery with 6 
months of significant reduction of cocaine use. Notably, motivated attention to drug-related 
cues, which was increased in the cocaine-addicted individuals at baseline as compared to 
the healthy controls, did not change at follow-up, highlighting the protracted nature of the 
disproportionate attention attributed to drug-related cues in drug addiction (Parvaz et al., 
2017). Similarly, a previous study investigating the EEG power in delta band frequency 
[that reflects frontal cortical regulation of behavioral impulses or concentration/attention 
allocation to extraneous cues (Fernandez et al., 1995)] also did not show abstinence-related 
recovery in 17 cocaine addicted individuals from 5 – 10 days to 1 or 6 months of abstinence 
(Alper et al., 1998). Taken together, these results suggest that while motivated attention to 
non-drug-related reinforcers may partially recover with 6 months of abstinence or significant 
reduction in cocaine use, the processes that underlie heightened attention allocation to 
drug-related cues and maladaptive impulse control may persist. The plasticity in reactivity to 
salient (including drug) reinforcers could therefore serve as an important target for long-term 
interventions.

4.3  Heroin and Other SUD

In a resting-state fMRI study, Wang et. al., (2011) showed higher BOLD fMRI signal 
in the OFC and lower activity in the cerebellar tonsil in 15 individuals with heroin use 
disorder at 3 days of abstinence compared to 16 non-addicted healthy controls; the activity 
in the cerebellar tonsil continued to decline as assessed after 1 month of abstinence when 
activity of frontopolar and subgenual ACC regions was also decreased (Wang et al., 2011).

Although, no longitudinal changes were observed in the OFC, the absence of significant 
cross-sectional differences with the non-addicted healthy controls at 1-month suggests that 
the OFC activity may have recovered during the first month of abstinence.

In an fMRI study that employed the Balloon Analogue Risk task, 21 treatment-seeking 
individuals with SUD (12 AUD, four polysubstance dependence, two opioid dependence and 
one each sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic dependence, cannabis dependence, and amphetamine 
dependence) were scanned first at 1 – 4 weeks (baseline) and then at 3 months of abstinence 
(follow-up) (Forster et al., 2016). Compared to baseline, at follow-up there were increased 
activations in the dorsal premotor cortex to decision events (when participants are deciding 
whether or not to inflate the balloon) and in the caudal anterior and posterior cingulate 
cortices for the success feedback (when participants are informed whether they succeeded 
and the balloon did not explode on that trial), while the inferior frontal gyrus and the 
caudal anterior cingulate cortex showed decreased activations to the failure feedback (when 
the balloon exploded) (Forster et al., 2016). Together, findings were interpreted to reflect 
an increased surprise signal to unexpected outcomes (i.e., high risk successes and low 
risk balloon explosions) in recovery, suggestive of the formation of stronger expectancies 
(Alexander and Brown, 2010, 2014). This study is unique in combining treatment-seeking 
individuals across different alcohol/drug classes potentially enhancing generalizability of 
results if replicated in additional samples of individuals with SUDs.

4.4 

Interim Summary

There is a paucity of neuroimaging studies examining changes in brain function with 
abstinence in individuals with SUD. Studies in AUD point to a general recovery in frontal 
brain regions, showing increased cerebral blood flow in non-smoking and/or abstinent AUD 
(Durazzo et al., 2010; Mon et al., 2009) and increased amplitude of the EEG-derived 
auditory sleep evoked potentials (Colrain et al., 2012). In nicotine users, increased reactivity 
to smoking-related cues during the first 2 months of abstinence (Janes et al., 2009) supports 
the notion of incubation of cue-reactivity/craving during earlier phases of abstinence (Li et 
al., 2016). Reports of abstinence-mediated recovery in cocaine use disorder paint a more 
complex picture with a pattern of recovery that may depend on context. Within the first 
six months of abstinence, midbrain and thalamic responses to salient stimuli (including 
money) recover (Balodis et al., 2016; Moeller et al., 2012) with a similar, albeit partial, 
recovery in reactivity to pleasant cues as documented using an EEG-derived marker of 
bottom-up/automatic processing (Parvaz et al., 2017). In contrast, heightened reactivity to 
drug-related cues (Parvaz et al., 2017) or dysregulated attention allocation to extraneous cues 
(Alper et al., 1998) may be more protracted. In heroin users, however, some evidence for 
recovery in the OFC resting activity within the first month of abstinence (Wang et al., 2011) 
warrants replication and further validation. Overall, these studies point to both cortical and 
subcortical functional recovery during the first year of abstinence in alcohol and cocaine use 
disorders. More studies are needed to explore functional (cognitive and emotional) recovery 
in drug addiction (across all drugs of abuse and alcohol) and the effects of context and time 
in this non-linear multi-layered process. A drug related context may be a crucial variable 
predisposing addicted individuals to relapse especially at specific times in abstinence as 
potentially amenable for timely interception.

5.  NEUROCHEMICAL STUDIES

In humans, chemical and molecular integrity of brain cells and tissue are quantified using 
either nuclear imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single-
Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 
(MRS). The two nuclear imaging modalities provide a quantitative assessment of regional 
distribution and kinetics of chemical compounds labeled with short-lived positron (in PET) 
or gamma (in SPECT) emitting isotopes in the living body. The molecules labeled with 
these isotopes bind to specific proteins (i.e., receptors and transporters) and can be measured 
in the tissues of interest as a function over time; PET is also used to assess the cerebral 
metabolic rate of glucose utilization as well as regional cerebral blood flow. Magnetic 
Resonance Spectroscopy is also a molecular neuroimaging technique, but does not use 
ionizing radiation of PET and SPECT, instead leveraging magnetic fields to localize a 
specific volume of tissue for spectral analysis. Each frequency in the spectrum corresponds 
to a metabolite nucleus, and the amplitude represents its concentration within the volume. 
This technique is typically used to study neuronal integrity, most reliably quantifiable via 
N-acetylaspartate [NAA; a surrogate marker for neuronal density and integrity (Licata and 
Renshaw, 2010)], choline-containing compounds [Cho; a marker of cell membrane integrity, 
increased in diseases with increased membrane turnover or axonal injury (Lin et al., 2012)], 
Creatine [Cr; a metabolite that provides a measure of cellular energy storage (Rackayova et 
al., 2017)], and myo-inositol [mI; a marker of glial cell density and therefore a measure 
of inflammation (Brand et al., 1993)], together providing a snapshot of the chemical 
environment of the selected brain region.

5.1  Alcohol

Most longitudinal studies employed MRS in AUD, showing partial recovery within the 
first three months of abstinence (Bartsch et al., 2007; Durazzo et al., 2006; Mon et al., 
2012; Parks et al., 2002) of the deficits documented in this population within one month 
of abstinence as compared to light drinkers, encompassing reduced NAA in the ACC (Mon 
et al., 2012), medial temporal lobe (Gazdzinski et al., 2008), the cerebellum (Ende et al., 
2005; Parks et al., 2002) and parietal (Durazzo et al., 2006) and frontal WM (Ende et 
al., 2005), as well as reduced Cr in the cerebellum and frontal WM (Ende et al., 2005). 
The partial nature of the recovery is evident in both a differential pattern of results for 
the different neurochemicals within different ROIs and their different recovery trajectories 
whereby, for example, cerebellar NAA levels increased from 3 weeks to 3 months of 
abstinence (n=11), whereas cerebellar Cho levels as well as frontal NAA remained below 
that of controls during this time frame (Parks et al., 2002). Adding to the evidence for 
partial neurochemical recovery, Ende et al. (2005) showed increased Cho levels in frontal 
WM, cerebellar cortex and vermis in AUD individuals following 3-months of complete 
abstinence (n=14), but reported no change in NAA levels over 3 (n=14) or 6 months (n=11) 
of abstinence (Ende et al., 2005). These measures of neurochemical recovery correlated with 
both cognitive function and brain structure. For example, increased levels of fronto-mesial 
NAA and cerebellar Cho from baseline (<1 week abstinence) to 6 – 7 weeks of abstinence 
in 15 individuals with AUD were associated with global volumetric brain gain as well as 
improved attention (Bartsch et al., 2007). In another study, Mon et al (2012) observed lower

concentrations of glutamate and glutamate + glutamine in the ACC in treatment-seekers 
with AUD (n=20) at approximately nine days of abstinence, which normalized (compared to 
healthy controls, n=16) over four weeks of sustained abstinence but were not associated with 
cognitive improvement (Mon et al., 2012).

Similarly to the above reviewed structural and functional studies, the lack of consistency of 
results between these studies may reflect diverse subject characteristics including comorbid 
cigarette smoking. For example, Durazzo et al. (2006) reported significant increases in NAA 
(frontal GM and WM), Cho (frontal and parietal GM & WM, and occipital WM), and mI 
and Cr (frontal WM) concentrations in 25 individuals with AUD following approximately 
one-month of abstinence. However, when further stratified based on cigarette smoking 
status, the results diverged between non-smokers (n=11) and smokers (n=14) such that the 
former drove most of these changes with the latter showing increased NAA and Cho only in 
frontal GM and a decrease in NAA in parietal and occipital WM, suggesting that cigarette 
smoking may adversely affect metabolite recovery in AUD (Durazzo et al., 2006). A later 
study from the same group reported a similar trend for a partial recovery in Cho and NAA 
in non-smokers but not in smokers (Gazdzinski et al., 2008). Taken together, studies using 
MRS present an encouraging, albeit not entirely consistent, pattern of results with respect 
to changes in Cho and NAA recovery with abstinence in AUD. Low sample sizes may be 
another source contributing to this discrepancy.

In a PET study Ceccarini et al (2014) reported a global deficiency (−16.1%) of the 
endocannabinoid signaling pathways, especially in the availability of the type 1 cannabinoid 
receptor (CB1R), in individuals with AUD (n=26) as compared to healthy controls (n=17). 
Such blunted CB1R availability in the cerebellum and parieto-occipital cortex, the ventral 
striatum and the mesotemporal lobe did not recover after one month of abstinence (−17.0%), 
highlighting persistent deficits in the endocannabinoid signaling pathways, at least within 
the first month of abstinence in AUD (Ceccarini et al., 2014). In a recent PET study, the 
same group showed reduced corticolimbic metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) 
availability in AUD at baseline (<2 weeks post-detoxification), which recovered up to the 
levels observed in healthy controls across 2 and 6 months of abstinence in most cortical 
and subcortical regions, except for the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and thalamus. 
Interestingly, lower striatopallidal mGluR5 availability at baseline was associated with 
higher propensity to relapse at 6 months and its longitudinal normalization was associated 
with lower craving. Together, these results suggest that, unlike deficits in CB1R, those in 
mGluR5 availability normalize with abstinence in AUD (Ceccarini et al., 2014; Ceccarini et 
al., 2020), and such normalization, especially in the mGluR5 availability, is associated with 
decreased craving in this population (Ceccarini et al., 2020).

5.2  Nicotine, Methamphetamine and Heroin

Using 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA)-PET, Rademacher et al (2016) compared 
presynaptic dopamine function between 15 nonsmokers and 30 nicotine-dependent smokers 
studied before and after 3 months of abstinence. Results revealed a 15% to 20% lower 
capacity of dopamine synthesis in the dorsal and ventral regions of the caudate nuclei 
of sated smokers as compared to non-smokers, which normalized during three months of

abstinence to the level of non-smoking controls. Interestingly, this time course is consistent 
with earlier research suggesting that the cholinergic system takes approximately three 
months to normalize in abstinent tobacco smokers (Cosgrove et al., 2009).

Using MRS, Burger et al. (2018) showed lower NAA and NAA with n-acetyl-aspartyl-
glutamate concentration in the DLPFC and lower Cho concentration in frontal WM in 31 
individuals with a methamphetamine use disorder compared to 22 non-addicted controls. In 
contrast to the results of partial NAA recovery with abstinence in the AUD population, a 
longitudinal examination (n=22) from acute (up to 2 weeks) to short-term (up to 6 weeks) 
abstinence revealed further reduction in NAA and NAA with n-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate 
concentrations in the ACC and frontal WM. Over time, there were also decreased levels of 
myo-inositol in the left frontal WM, while an increase in myo-inositol was seen in the ACC 
(Burger et al., 2018).

Treatment-seeking heroin users (n=55), randomly assigned to receive either Placebo or 
Jitai (a traditional Chinese medicine that has been approved by the China Food and 
Drug Administration for treatment of opioid addiction), were scanned with SPECT using 
[99mTc]TRODAT-1 to examine longitudinal changes in dopamine transporter concentration 
from baseline (almost 20 days abstinent), to three, six, and 12 months of abstinence (Xu 
et al., 2015). At baseline, compared to healthy controls (n=20; scanned once), the heroin 
addicted individuals showed lower dopamine transporter concentrations in the striatum 
(by 30%). Longitudinal analyses showed that the individuals assigned to the Jitai group 
had a steady increase in the dopamine transporter concentrations, while in the placebo 
group results were mixed, such that there was an increase from baseline to three months, 
a slight decrease from three to six months and then an increase from six to 12 months 
follow-up. Importantly, both groups showed a longitudinal increase in dopamine transporter 
concentrations from baseline to 12 months follow-up (by 20%) (Xu et al., 2015).

5.3 

Interim Summary

Neurochemical techniques, especially MRS in alcohol use, have been predominantly used 
to quantify molecular recovery as a function of abstinence in individuals with SUD. Most 
studies in AUD have shown consistent increases in NAA concentration within the first 
3 months of abstinence (Bartsch et al., 2007; Durazzo et al., 2006; Parks et al., 2002). 
The frontal cortex and the cerebellum have been the most studied ROIs, whereas some 
studies have also examined the parietal cortex and the medial temporal lobe. Early recovery 
(within one month of abstinence) shows increased NAA in the frontal cortex and the medial 
temporal lobe and increased Cho in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, driven by 
non-smoking individuals with AUD (Durazzo et al., 2006; Gazdzinski et al., 2008). During 
more protracted abstinence (2 to 6 months) studies show conflicting results. For example, 
whereas some show increase in the cerebellar Cho (Bartsch et al., 2007; Ende et al., 2005), 
others do not (Parks et al., 2002), and whereas some show no change in frontal NAA (Ende 
et al., 2005; Parks et al., 2002), others do (Bartsch et al., 2007). Thus, in AUD, variability 
of results was observed based on length and status of abstinence, the metabolite and ROI 
under investigation, and cigarette smoking. In methamphetamine use disorder there was no

recovery as a function of abstinence, with results instead suggesting continued reduction in 
NAA in the ACC and frontal WM up to 5 weeks of abstinence (Burger et al., 2018).

Nuclear imaging results suggest a dopaminergic recovery with abstinence. For example, a 
PET study in nicotine users showed increased dopamine synthesis in the dorsal and ventral 
caudate with over 5 weeks of abstinence (Rademacher et al., 2016). A study in heroin users 
showed recovery in dopamine transporter concentration in the striatum after 6 – 12 months 
of abstinence (Xu et al., 2015). In AUD, although mGluR5 availability showed overall 
recovery in both cortical and subcortical regions during the first 6 months of abstinence 
(Ceccarini et al., 2020), CB1R availability did not recover, at least within the first month of 
abstinence (Ceccarini et al., 2014).

6.  DISCUSSION

Longitudinal studies that assess within-subject changes in brain morphology and function 
including neurochemistry following sustained abstinence are optimal for identifying the 
potential for and the trajectory of neural recovery in individuals with SUD. Overall, the 
reviewed research suggests that neural deficits dissipate following a period of sustained 
abstinence from substance use in individuals with SUD. In each of the three reviewed 
sections, sustained abstinence was predominantly associated with (at least partial) recovery, 
such that over time deficits in select regions appeared to normalize, implying that these 
abnormalities are likely consequences of substance consumption rather than premorbid or 
risk factors for SUD. Importantly, these neural substrates may serve as potential biomarkers 
that can be targeted for treatment of SUDs.

Structural recovery occurred predominantly in frontal cortical regions, the insula, 
hippocampus, and cerebellum. In addition to prefrontal cortical regions, functional recovery 
was also observed in subcortical structures (midbrain, striatum, thalamus). While reversal 
of neural damage was evident across studies and modalities used, numerous instances 
of regional specificity and variability/inconsistencies in time-course and pattern of these 
changes were noted. These discrepancies may reflect between-study differences in the use 
of ROI versus whole-brain approaches (with the former increasing the susceptibility to 
selection biases), inter-scan intervals and clinical characteristics (e.g., concurrent substance 
use, severity of SUD), calling for more and larger studies of this type. A question to explore 
is whether specific brain regions may be faster or more amenable to recovery, particularly 
the frontal cortex, while other regions may show a slower trajectory or be more impervious 
to change.

For structural studies, where recovery was primarily indexed as GM volume increases in 
individuals with AUD, greater changes occurred relatively early in the course of abstinence 
(i.e., within the first month of cessation), while relatively less change occurred with longer 
abstinence [i.e., post 6 months (Durazzo et al., 2015; Pfefferbaum et al., 1995; Zou et al., 
2018)] indicating that GM structural recovery may follow a nonlinear trajectory (Gazdzinski 
et al., 2005). More longitudinal multi-interval studies that assess WM integrity are needed 
to determine the trajectory of WM recovery, particularly studies that employ DTI, rather

than voxel-based morphometry, to more sensitively index changes in WM microstructure 
and organization following abstinence.

Similarly, early recovery was observed in neurometabolite levels in individuals with AUD 
(Ende et al., 2005; Parks et al., 2002). However, such early recovery was not observed 
in CB1R availability (Ceccarini et al., 2014) and the recovery in mGluR5 availability 
was most evident several months post-cessation (Ceccarini et al., 2020), suggesting a 
heterogeneous functional molecular recovery profile. An exception was noted for individuals 
with a methamphetamine use disorder, where studies generally demonstrated that neural 
abnormalities may worsen with abstinence, even up to a year (Burger et al., 2018; Ruan 
et al., 2018; Zhuang et al., 2016), raising the possibility that neurotoxic effects are not 
only associated with current methamphetamine use, but also with withdrawal from the 
drug, and/or with premorbid factors. Similar maladaptive longitudinal change was seen in 
chronic cigarette smokers who showed increased reactivity to smoking related cues during 
the course of early abstinence (Janes et al., 2009). Such an increase in (or incubation of) 
drug cue-reactivity during the initial phase of abstinence has been consistently seen in 
animal models of addiction, and is now being observed in human studies as well (Li et 
al., 2016). Overall, evidence suggests that recovery is not a uniform process but instead 
may occur along a non-linear trajectory (i.e., different phases of recovery). This non-linear 
trajectory mirrors findings from a mega-analysis that demonstrated the absence of substance-
specific linear effects on brain volume where both the impact of the drug and GM recovery 
may be more complex than can be elucidated by a simple linear analysis (Mackey et al., 
2019). While speculative, it is plausible that functional recovery may be dependent, to 
some degree, on initial structural recovery, which may explain its delayed onset. More 
specifically, because GM volume reductions in specific regions may be related to alteration 
in functional response (Fu et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2010), improvement in brain function 
may be subsequent to neural repair of structural networks (Crews et al., 2005). However, it 
is also possible that structural imaging is simply more sensitive and hence can detect effects 
earlier compared to functional imaging (Johansen-Berg, 2012).

It is important to note that the dynamic brain changes observed within the first few days 
following cessation may be associated, in part, with withdrawal and compensatory actions 
in response to drug removal [e.g. (Wang, X. et al., 2012)]. Thus, any damage associated 
with excessive drug use needs to be teased apart from that associated with the sub-acute, 
residual, effects of the drug (Fernandez-Serrano et al., 2011). It has been suggested that a 
minimum of two weeks of abstinence must be maintained to make this distinction (Schulte 
et al., 2014), which indeed has been undertaken by all but three studies reviewed here 
[(Kuhn et al., 2014; van Eijk et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016)]. Considering the other end of 
the time spectrum, only one study (Pfefferbaum et al., 2014) assessed an abstinence period 
greater than 13 months, prohibiting the examination of the long-term trajectory of recovery, 
which clearly awaits future studies. Studies examining relationships between protracted 
abstinence length and neural outcomes suggest that recovery is ongoing and not the result 
of a single neural process (He et al., 2018; O’Neill et al., 2001). Future studies employing 
multiple assessments at different time-points and combining different imaging modalities 
over extended abstinence periods (>13-months), are warranted to accurately capture the 
precise recovery time-course associated with protracted abstinence in individuals with SUD.

A goal of this body of neuroimaging research is to leverage these data to improve prognostic 
outcomes in individual with SUDs, thus linking neural recovery to clinical improvements is 
fundamental. Findings from the reviewed studies demonstrate that structural (Durazzo et al., 
2006; Gazdzinski et al., 2008; Hoefer et al., 2014; Mon et al., 2013; Parvaz et al., 2016a) and 
functional (DeVito et al., 2012; Forster et al., 2016) including neurochemical (Bartsch et al., 
2007; Durazzo et al., 2006) improvements correlate with enhanced cognitive performance, 
indicating putative neurobiological substrates for cognitive recovery following abstinence 
in individuals with SUD. While not assessed in every study or across every substance, 
these findings are encouraging given that cognitive dysfunction is a vulnerability factor for 
relapse (Stevens et al., 2014) and better cognitive function is associated with achieving more 
favorable treatment outcomes in recovering individuals (Sofuoglu et al., 2013). Further, 
while not assessed in any of the reviewed studies, predictors of relapse beyond cognition, 
such as craving, have been associated with changes in GM volume (Makris et al., 2004). 
Thus, the full breadth of improved clinical outcomes and their relation to neural regeneration 
over abstinence remains to be discerned. Lastly, demonstrating that better brain health is 
achievable with abstinence may serve as a powerful motivational tool to encourage cessation 
and inspire treatment engagement among individuals with SUD and treatment providers.

The prevalence of cigarette smoking among individuals with SUD is high (John et al., 
2003; Weinberger et al., 2018; Weinberger and Sofuoglu, 2009; Zale et al., 2015) and 
evidence suggests that cigarette smoking negatively affects neural recovery. Compared 
to non-smokers, heavy cigarette smokers have lower GM volume (Brody et al., 2004; 
Gallinat et al., 2006), lower global cerebral blood flow (Domino et al., 2004), and altered 
neurochemistry (Ashok et al., 2019; Moffett et al., 2007). Functional MRI studies suggest 
that nicotine may modulate task-induced BOLD responses and have performance enhancing 
properties (Hahn et al., 2009). Collectively, this evidence underscores the importance 
to control for the confounding effects of cigarette smoking on results. While some of 
the studies in individuals with AUD prospectively parsed smokers from non-smokers to 
determine if recovery differed as a function of cigarette smoking [e.g., (Durazzo et al., 2006; 
Durazzo et al., 2015; Gazdzinski et al., 2008; Mon et al., 2009)], this was not done for any 
other SUD. Some studies did, however, include baseline cigarette smoking as a covariate in 
longitudinal analyses when differences between the control and SUD group emerged (Mon 
et al., 2013). Given that it is common for individuals in treatment for SUD to also quit 
smoking cigarettes (Orleans and Hutchinson, 1993), future studies may consider modeling 
the trajectory of cigarette consumption over SUD abstinence to appropriately disassociate 
the effects of the primary substance from cigarette use on the changes in neural outcomes.

Several limitations of this review are worth noting. First, this review included studies 
that employed behavioral and/or other interventions [e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy 
(Balodis et al., 2016; DeVito et al., 2012) and traditional Chinese medicine (Xu et al., 
2015)] to facilitate abstinence. These treatments may have induced positive neural or 
neurochemical changes over abstinence (DeVito et al., 2017; Seminowicz et al., 2013). 
Disassociating the intervention effects from those related directly to abstinence is yet to be 
achieved. Second, a caveat of this research is that treatment-seekers in general, or those 
who successfully achieve abstinence, might possess less neurobiological vulnerability and 
be more apt to neural recovery compared to those who are unable to quit or maintain

abstinence (e.g., non-treatment-seekers and/or relapsers) (Martinez et al., 2011; Wang, 
G.J. et al., 2012). Third, methodologies varied across studies (e.g., sample characteristics, 
abstinence length (see Figure 3 for the distribution of inter-scan interval in structural, 
functional, and neurochemical studies), treatment administered, imaging techniques, specific 
ROIs examined, statistical thresholds) making direct between-study comparisons difficult. 
In addition, while within-study paradigms offer benefits over cross-sectional designs, these 
studies must still ensure that adequate control groups are enrolled and assessed at equivalent 
time-points to the SUD group and the influence of potential confounders are controlled 
for in the analyses (e.g., age, comorbid substance use, baseline SUD severity). Fourth, our 
inferences are based on a limited number of studies, and most studies had limited sample 
sizes, primarily due to high attrition rates. High attrition rate has been a major limitation 
in conducting longitudinal studies in human drug addiction, partially because of the highly 
mobile, unstable, and transient lifestyles of many study participants (BootsMiller et al., 
1998). Lastly, there is a predominance of studies examining recovery in treatment-seeking 
individuals with AUD, while recovery in other SUD (e.g., opiates and cannabis) has been 
generally overlooked, representing a critical gap in this area of research as seen in Figure 
2. Nevertheless, the literature is growing, and we anticipate that future studies, with larger 
sample sizes, and longer follow-up periods will help clarify these issues.

The use of imaging techniques in addiction research has increased substantially in the 
last decade and many of these studies have been instrumental in providing evidence that 
structural and functional including neurochemical deficits may recover with even short 
periods of abstinence. Beyond providing hope for individuals with SUD and encouraging 
them to seek treatment, and providing evidence-based treatment, characterizing these 
neurobiological processes may help to identify novel biomarkers that can be targeted 
for SUD timely intervention. Capturing the trajectory of neural changes over abstinence 
(or even using a harm-reduction approach) may help establish a neuroscience-informed 
framework for developing pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, and/or neuromodulatory 
interventions that can mimic and/or enhance the brain’s ability to repair itself, restoring 
cognitive function, and contributing to positive long-term treatment outcomes in individuals 
with SUD.

Structural recovery occurred predominantly in frontal cortical regions, the 
insula, hippocampus, and cerebellum.

In addition to prefrontal cortical regions, functional recovery was also 
observed in subcortical structures (midbrain, striatum, thalamus).

A question to explore is whether specific brain regions may be more 
amenable to recovery, particularly the frontal cortex, while other regions may 
be more impervious to change.

Characterizing these neurobiological processes may help to identify novel 
biomarkers that can be targeted for timely intervention for substance use 
disorders.

Results provide hope for treatment-seeking individuals with substance use 
disorders and encourage them to seek treatment.

Figure 2: Summary of the number of longitudinal comparisons (for participants with Substance 
Use Disorder) in the collected studies for each imaging modality and substance.
The bubble plot summarizes the number of substance using participants in the collected 
studies for the individual imaging modalities (structural MRI, functional MRI, MRS, PET, 
SPECT, and EEG) and is grouped by the substance (alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, 
heroin, nicotine, and other SUD). Each bubble represents the intersection between the 
imaging modality and the substance, the bubble size corresponds with the number of 
longitudinal comparisons, and the number of collected studies is represented by the number 
within each bubble.

Figure 3: Distribution of inter-scan interval in structural, functional, and neurochemical studies.
The violin plot shows the distribution of the interval between scans (in days) grouped by 
structural, functional and neurochemical studies. Each violin plot shows the distribution of 
the duration of abstinence in substance using samples for each drug represented by the black 
dots, as well as the interquartile range (IQR) as a white box, the median as the black line 
within the white box and 95% confidence interval as a thin black line.

studies are group by the substance (alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, nicotine, and other SUD) and within each substance the studies are 
arranged by the increasing duration of abstinence at the final scan. Sample sizes are reported for only those individuals who were abstinent on the 
study day. Default longitudinal comparison is between the first and the last scan, unless specified otherwise.
