Abstract

Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of ADHD, and related comorbidities, mor-

tality, and type of health service use among children and young adults, using

different case definitions.

Methods: We conducted a population‐based retrospective cohort study between

2000 and 2018, using the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System

(QICDSS) database. All residents aged less than 25 years eligible for health insur-

ance coverage were included. We compared outcomes of

three indicators

(morbidity, services use and mortality) according two different algorithms of ADHD

definitions, to the general population.

Results: The cumulative prevalence of ADHD has risen steadily over the past

decade, reaching 12.6% in 2017–2018. People with ADHD have a higher prevalence

of psychiatric comorbidities, make greater use of medical, mental health services,

and are hospitalized more often. The comparison of prevalence between the two

algorithms and the general population for the three indicators showed that the

cohort having one claim was very close to that with two or more, and statistically

significant higher to that of people without ADHD.

Conclusion: This finding support that a single claim algorithm for ADHD can be used

for case definition. More research is needed on the impact of potentially effective

treatments in improving consequences of ADHD.

monitoring tool for identifying temporal trends among treated cases.

Finally, it is difficult to affirm generalizability of our results because

we studied only Quebec residents. However, a cross‐provincial

comparison of annual prevalence using their linked health adminis-

trative databases showed the feasibility of the case definition, and

study could serve as a reference for other Canadian provinces and the

countries with linked health administrative databases.

5 | CONCLUSION

Our study confirms that the prevalence of ADHD has risen steadily

over time with significant variations by sex and age group. This study

also allowed to identify the comorbidities associated with ADHD and

the measurement of health service utilization across the life trajec-

tory, but also shed light on the specific needs of people with ADHD

and on possible discontinuity of care in the service offer and a higher

mortality rate. It also demonstrates the QICDSS's capacity to reliably

monitor diagnosed and those possibly medically treated with ADHD

medication. The current study showed that no matter the case

definition used to identify treated ADHD cases, the QICDSS con-

stitutes a useful database for health outcomes monitoring. Our re-

sults may have implications for future research. This includes

exploring the underlying reasons for somatic comorbidities and their

interaction with ADHD. Further research questions may also

examine the impact of potentially effective treatments, such as

ADHD medications, on the co‐morbidities and long‐term harmful

consequences of ADHD.
