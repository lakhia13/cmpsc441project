Abstract In this article, I address the experiences of family members of people
with dementia, as they expressed the sensation of gradually losing the person with
dementia. Based on ethnographic ﬁeldwork in nursing homes in the Netherlands,
and contributing to the anthropology of grief, I explore the co-existence of expe-
riences of anticipatory grief and manifestations of care to maintain meaningful
relations. I show how my interlocutors adapted to changing circumstances as the
disease progressed, and in so doing found new ways to relate, as well as prepared for
future losses and the expected end of life. I argue that anticipatory grief is temporal
and relational, encompassing both present and future losses, and involving a con-
tinuous negotiation between the loss and the continuing relationship. I underscore
the entanglement of loss and connection, showing how both exist parallel to, and
may emerge from one another, and demonstrating how an anthropological approach
to anticipatory grief can reveal the nuanced and equivocal character of experiences
of illness and at the end of life.

Introduction

‘‘Often it feels as if I already lost her, as if she is not my mother anymore. It is a
process of grief that started a long time ago,’’ said Patrick, who visited his mother
with dementia in the nursing home every Sunday. During the one and a half year I
spent doing ﬁeldwork in nursing homes in the Netherlands, family members, like

Patrick, often expressed the feeling that they had already lost or partly lost their
relative with dementia, actively addressing their experiences as ‘‘already grieving’’
while the person with dementia was still alive. Such experiences resonate with
popular discourses and imaginaries in Western societies that frame people with
dementia in terms of a loss of life and of the person, and in which both the
relationship with the person with dementia and their subjectivity are at risk.
However, while the narratives of family members often revolved around experi-
ences of loss, ethnographically, I also saw that they cultivated ways to maintain
meaningful relations with the person with dementia. Facing loss, they continuously
tried to ﬁnd what was ‘‘still possible’’ to share meaningful moments and keep the
person with dementia connected to the world. Such ambiguity of experiencing loss
while at the same time maintaining a relationship, emerged during the trajectory of
dementia, when my interlocutors witnessed the cognitive and physical capacities of
their relatives diminish, and changes in the relationships between them.

In this article, I explore this co-existence of efforts to maintain meaningful
relations and experiences of what has been referred to in the literature as pre-death,
or anticipatory grief in dementia (Blandin and Pepin 2015; Large and Slinger 2015;
Lindauer and Harvath 2014; Moore, et al., 2020; Peacock, et al., 2018). While
public discourses tend to address dementia in terms of loss, using metaphors of
absence and disappearance, there is also an increasing number of studies that
address the possibilities of a good life with dementia (Driessen 2018; Grøn and
Mattingly 2018), the relational, as opposed to biomedical, practices through which
the person with dementia is held in relations (Moser 2011), and arts-focused moral
experiments to engage the person with dementia (Jeong 2020; Taylor 2017). My
contribution to this growing body of literature is to demonstrate the ways in which
loss and connection interweave and sometimes come apart. I am interested, in other
words, in demonstrating how family members navigate ambiguous attachments by
continuously adapting to, and anticipating, changing circumstances. While this
recent attention for alternative and more positive perspectives on dementia is
valuable and much needed, there is an equally pressing need to understand the
experiences of grief that may accompany illness and dementia. Indeed, others have
cautioned for the risk of romanticizing dementia when addressing it (only) in terms
of ‘‘living well’’ and have called for a nuanced view on the suffering involved,
reinforcing the negative tropes associated with the disease (Grøn
without
forthcoming; Bartlett et al. 2017). Hence, my aim in this article is to acknowledge
and create space for ambiguous experiences and seemingly contradictory emotions,
narratives, and practices. By focusing on the experiences of grief and loss of family
members as well as their efforts to maintain meaningful relations, I argue that in
caring for a person with dementia, loss and connection are interwoven.

Anthropologists have demonstrated extensively that mourning rituals can be
understood as social expressions of grief. In the anthropology of death, many studies
have considered the social meaning of funerary rituals, which can be traced back to
Hertz (1907), Van Gennep (1909), Radcliffe-Brown (1922), and Huntington and
Metcalf (1979) in their delineations of funerary rituals as transitory and transfor-
mational. Considering that death causes an interruption in the social order, rituals
are seen as restoring this gap in the social body and reintegrating the bereaved into

123

Cult Med Psychiatry (2023) 47:701–721

703

society (Howarth 2007; Robben 2004; Shohet 2018). In addition to this long-
standing and continuing interest in death rituals, anthropologists have increasingly
sought to understand the emotional aspects of grief. Particularly the work of
Rosaldo (1989, 2014), who reﬂected on the subjectivity of the experience and
emotional ‘‘force’’ of grief, signaled a need to study the affective aspects of grief
anthropologically. Scheper-Hughes (1993), in turn, has shown how the experience
of grief is also subject to politics and structural inequalities. These works continue
to resonate in recent additions in the anthropology of death and grief, such as the
work of Silverman et al. (2020), who further elaborate on the cultural dynamics of
emotions in grief, and the normativities in the relationship between the living and
the dead. Contributing to this ﬁeld of grief research, I discuss in this article the lived
experiences of anticipatory grief—grief that occurs before, and in anticipation of
death. How do people experience and engage with grief for a person who is alive?
Psychological and psychiatric literature has, since the term was coined by Erich
Lindemann (1944), long conceived of anticipatory grief as an ‘early start’ to the
process of grief work. Grief work, for Freud (1917), referred to the process through
which the bereaved subject was supposed to detach itself from the lost object. As
grief work became commonly understood to consist of ‘stages’ that the bereaved
person passes through (Bowlby 1980; Ku¨bler-Ross 2009), anticipatory grief has
been suggested to allow the bereaved to ‘complete’ the grief work quicker (Ponder
and Pomeroy 1997; Rando 1983). Rando (1983), for example, has argued that there
is an ‘‘optimum amount’’ of anticipatory grief of six to eighteen months for it to
have such therapeutic value. Countering such causal and normative thinking in
which anticipatory grief is considered to facilitate adaptation to bereavement, Fulton
and Gottesman (1980:51; Fulton 2003:348) argue that ‘‘anticipatory grief is not
simply grief begun in advance; it is different from post-death grief in both duration
and form.’’ Still, this debate, on whether anticipatory grief facilitates, problematizes,
or does not relate at all to adaptation to loss after death occurs, has been persistent in
clinical psychology and psychiatry, without any clear consensus reached (Moore
et al., 2020; Ponder and Pomeroy 1997).

My anthropological approach moves this discussion into a different direction, in
that I do not make claims about the relation between anticipatory grief and the grief
that follows death, but rather take its ‘anticipatory’ character to reﬂect the future-
oriented character of grief, and particularly to the ways in which future loss
inﬂuences actions and affects in the present. This temporal dynamic, as I will go on
to demonstrate, is twofold. On the one hand, family members, as well as people with
dementia themselves, experience losses in the present as the disease progresses.
With each change, they grieve for the abilities or aspects of their relationships that
have been lost, adapt to the new circumstances, ﬁnd new ways to relate, and revise
their expectations of the trajectory ahead. Gradually, these experiences bring the end
of life into view as an increasingly tangible and imminent prospect. On the other
hand, then, they become oriented toward the end of life. They anticipate this
moment, drawing it into the present, prepare for it practically and emotionally, and
grieve for future losses that are expected and loom in the present. Anticipatory grief,
then, is temporal and relational, encompassing the experience of losses in the
present alongside losses that are still to come.

Further, as a form of grief in life, anticipatory grief infuses interpersonal relations
and everyday interactions. Anthropologist Susan Hemer (2017:11) criticizes the
concept for theoretically dividing experiences of grief into distinctive categories,
countering the presumption that grief before death would be conceptually different
from grief after death. However, essential to understanding anticipatory grief is that
the person with dementia is present and alive, which means the grieving person
continues to engage with them. ‘‘To mourn someone who is still alive brings a
particular, complicated pain’’ (Gerrard 2019:208; see also Ponder and Pomeroy
1997), but it also shows that care and (anticipatory) grief are not incompatible. To
the contrary, as Kleinman (1988:32) notes, ‘‘care becomes an opportunity to
grieve,’’ while, in the words of Garcia (2010:194), ‘‘forms of care emerge, not in
spite of, but
through experiences of loss.’’ In anticipatory grief, relationships
continue, albeit in different form, underscoring that it is a relational phenomenon
that takes shape in, emerges from, and produces social interactions (Dragojlovic and
Broom 2018). Hence, I suggest that it involves a continuous negotiation between the
loss and the continuing relationship.

In my efforts to understand the dialectic in which my interlocutors both
experienced the loss of a person and simultaneously maintained meaningful
relations with them, it is helpful to better understand how people ‘continue bonds’.
Initially coined to account for the ways in which the bereaved can maintain ongoing
relationships with a deceased person, a continuing bonds perspective recognizes this
ongoing attachment as an integral part of the process of grief—thus countering the
classical notion that grief involves undoing this attachment (Klass et al. 1996). This
perspective draws attention to the ‘‘strategies of connection’’ (Silverman and
Nickman 1996:76) through which the deceased continues to be part of the social
reality of the bereaved. These include the memorialization of the deceased through
material objects, altars, and site visits, as well as conversations with inner
representations of the deceased. Here, I ﬁnd the concept of continuing bonds useful
to provoke recognition of precisely the continuation and adaptation of
the
relationship in the face of loss. The term ‘continuing’ refers to a relationship that
remains after a disruption, which is commonly assumed to be caused by death.
However, in the context of dementia, as with many other illnesses, the disruption
may be experienced earlier and in a protracted, gradual, or fragmented form.
Connecting this perspective to studies in dementia, which have shown approaches to
dementia wherein relations are central
(Taylor 2017; Moser 2011; Buch
2013, 2015), I illustrate below how family members put great effort in securing a
bond with the person with dementia. They continuously reafﬁrm the relationship,
interacting with the person and keeping them present in everyday life.

In this article, I focus on accounts of family members who were concerned with
the advancing decline of their relative with dementia, and who were in different
ways anticipating further losses toward the end of life. This is not to say that the
experiences of those who refrain from anticipation, are to be dismissed, as this too,
as Flaherty (2019) notes, can be a temporal commitment and moral project. In the
context of dementia, as I will further elaborate below, gradual cognitive and
physical decline often provoke the uncanny feeling of ‘‘already losing’’ the person
with dementia during the illness trajectory. Moreover, experiences of loss and

123

Cult Med Psychiatry (2023) 47:701–721

705

uncertainty in everyday life with dementia tend to relate to an overdetermined
image of the future. The strong negative imaginaries of the future with dementia
play an important role in anticipatory grief, whereby the changing capacities of the
person with dementia form both a confrontation with loss in the everyday and a
further decline. While these
confrontation with a preconceived scenario of
characteristics may be speciﬁc to the context of dementia, the understanding of
anticipatory grief that I present in this article also extends to other contexts,
particularly other illness trajectories, such as ALS and different forms of cancer, in
which patients and their families are confronted with changing capacities and might
come to expect future decline and ﬁnitude (see, for example, Olson 2014). Pushing
this even further, grief is also not limited to illness or the end of life, but can be
experienced in relation to other anticipated and experienced ruptures and losses.
More generally, then, a nuanced view on anticipatory grief can highlight the
intricate layered-ness of grief, loss, and connection—a form of grief of which its
emotional force is protracted, and characterized by continuous adaptation to
changing circumstances as well as the uncertainty of how the situation will unfold.
The point in writing about loss, then, is not to reproduce an image of dementia as
consisting only of deprivation and hurt, but to disentangle and do justice to the
nuances in the experiences of my interlocutors, for whom loss and grief were at
times overwhelming, but also embedded in relationships of care and connection.
Following Lisa Stevenson’s call for an anthropology ‘‘that makes room for
hesitation’’ and takes ‘‘the uncertain,
the confused—that which is not clearly
understood—as a legitimate ethnographic object’’ (2014:2), and with reference to
Kierans and Bell’s (2017) plea to cultivate an analytic of ambivalence, I draw
attention to how people live and cope with anticipatory grief in everyday life when
loss is ongoing, how they relate to future losses in the present, and how they reach
out and share time as they navigate the ambiguities of this experience.

Methodology

The discussion presented is based on 18 months of ethnographic ﬁeldwork in 2014
and 2015, where I took part in everyday life in nursing homes in the Netherlands.
This research focused on the end of life with dementia, asking how people with
dementia,
their family members, and professional caregivers become oriented
toward death, and strive to achieve a ‘good’ death. The nursing homes consisted of
closed wards with kleinschalig wonen (small-scale living) units, arranged to
resemble households. Through participant observation in these units, I gained
insight into everyday life with dementia, the social response to perceived and
projected receding capacities, and how the end of life was discussed, negotiated, and
experienced. I participated in social activities, drank coffee with residents in the
living room, and sat by their bedsides. I was present at medical consultations and
accompanied professional caregivers, psychologists, and chaplains in their work
with residents. During the afternoons I would often write down ﬁeld notes in the in-
house cafe´ on the ward.

123

Throughout the ethnographic ﬁeldwork in the nursing home, I had informal
conversations and conducted semi-structured interviews with professional care-
givers, family members, and with people with dementia. I also held forty in-depth
interviews with family members in their home setting. Family members were often
more at ease when they were at home, and would thus elaborate on sensitive topics
such as experiences of loss or their outlook on the end of life. To recruit participants
for these interviews I posted a call for participants on the website of the Dutch
Alzheimer’s Society (Alzheimer Nederland). Toward the end of my ﬁeldwork, I
held a series of three focus groups—one consisting of care workers, one with family
members, and one multidisciplinary group of nursing home staff—to discuss
insights that had emerged from the ﬁeld.

Institutionalization at old age is common in the Netherlands, and especially in the
context of dementia is often considered inevitable at some point. Nonetheless,
institutionalization is a key aspect of negative stereotypical views of a future with
dementia, and moving to a nursing home is seen by many as a large and deﬁnitive
step in the process of decline and loss (van Wijngaarden et al. 2015). In particular,
values that are central to the Dutch context, such as autonomy, independence and
control, are considered to be at risk when developing dementia. This is also visible
in how the future with dementia is often portrayed in popular discourses and media
images in the Netherlands. A loss of independence and autonomy are, then, often
connected to a perceived loss of dignity (Kennedy 2002; The 2009; van
Wijngaarden et al. 2015).1

During ﬁeldwork, I usually opened conversations and interviews by asking
‘‘What do you ﬁnd important?’’ or ‘‘Can you tell me your story?’’ This allowed my
interlocutors to start with the subjects they valued, struggled with, or were eager to
share, as well as choose where they wanted their story to start. Family members
often talked about how their relative with dementia had declined. After having spent
an extended period of time in the nursing home, I was able to see for myself how
residents’ conditions changed,
through which I also gained a more in-depth
understanding of the experiences, practices and narratives of family members.

Consent was approached as a process (Dewing 2002; McKillop and Wilkinson
2004) and sought from people with dementia, family members, professional
caregivers, and the nursing home management. Access to the nursing homes was
granted by the boards of directors and client councils. A letter was sent out to
families of all residents to inform them of the research and my presence in the
nursing home, as well as their right not to be involved in the project. Consent was
further acquired verbally and was veriﬁed repeatedly. During recorded interviews,
consent was asked on record. Throughout this article, the names and descriptions of
the nursing homes and the people who lived, worked, and visited there have been
anonymized.

1 Autonomy and control play an important role in the framing of a good death in the Netherlands. The
legal possibility of euthanasia, in particular, is indicative of the centrality of these values in Dutch
discourses and practices at the end of life. In some cases, a reorientation to the end of life with dementia
involves exploring the possibilities of euthanasia. I have written about such reorientation toward the
future through a euthanasia request elsewhere (see Lemos Dekker 2021).

In what follows, I will ﬁrst elaborate on the ambiguous experiences of family
members of people with dementia, who experienced grief even while the person was
still alive. Moving on to discuss the ways in which my interlocutors sought to
maintain meaningful
loss and
connection, showing how both exist parallel to, and may emerge from one another.
Then, I highlight the ways in which relationality is enacted through objects and
activities that are considered to be of signiﬁcance to the person with dementia, thus
forming also an effort to uphold their subjectivity. I will end by returning to the
future-oriented character of anticipatory grief, and show how my interlocutors
prepared for the end of life, suggesting that anticipatory grief thus relates to future
as well as present losses.

Ambiguities in Dementia

Many family members referred to dementia in terms of loss, as descending in steps,
with intervals between the losses. Patrick, who I introduced above, for example,
said: ‘‘From her 80th year onwards my mother crumbled in phases. She crumbled,
then a status quo. Then another step, status quo. And so on.’’ Similarly, Irene, whose
mother had been living in the nursing home for four years, told me:

‘‘She is changing. The familiarity, the way I used to know her, I feel I am
losing that little by little. We see so many changes, and it’s not coming back.
Sometimes there is a rare moment, but it all goes gradually. But then,
sometimes as steps on a staircase, at once three steps down. It’s a tough
process.’’

I asked her what kind of moments these ‘‘steps’’ encompassed.

‘‘For example, one of these moments was when I saw that she couldn’t take
her medicine anymore. Even though she had always taken that very seriously,
she couldn’t oversee that anymore. That was a moment I realized it was going
the wrong way.’’

Such concrete moments formed a confrontation with particular losses, but also
pointed at the larger trajectory of decline and losses yet to come. Decline was a
recurring subject of everyday conversation in the nursing home among family
members and care staff, as well as in more formal meetings between family and
elderly care physicians. By discussing capacities that were deemed lost, family
members and care professionals tried to come to an understanding of how the
disease was progressing and how they could adapt to the emerging situation. As
dementia does not follow a linear trajectory (Moreira 2010; Swallow 2019), loss did
not concentrate in a single event but was experienced as a process that occurred in
steps or episodes and that could ﬂuctuate. Some days were perceived by family
members as better than others, and referred to as ‘‘clear moments.’’ As it cannot be
predicted how exactly the disease will manifest, this is an uncertain process, for
family members as well as for care workers, who have to adapt to changing care
needs, and gerontologists, who may experience difﬁculties in establishing a

123

708

diagnosis and a prognosis (Carter, et al., 2015; Leibing 2014; Leibing and
Schicktanz 2020; Swallow 2019). Despite these uncertainties, the future trajectory
was often narrated with some certainty, projecting further decline and with a
prospect of the eventual dying process. In this sense, while glimpses of ‘‘clarity’’
occur, the ‘‘downward steps’’ of loss are, as Irene expressed, also experienced as
irreversible and inevitable as they bring the end of life into view. The intervals
between losses were often referred to as moments to readjust to the newly unfolding
changes; moments of reorientation in which family members sought to understand
the lifeworld of the person with dementia, made practical arrangements, and looked
for what forms of contact were still possible.

Although my interlocutors tried to adapt to these changes, at some point, many
expressed ﬁnding it difﬁcult to make contact with their relative with dementia. Els,
whose mother had become bedridden and unable to communicate verbally, told me:

‘‘You know, you don’t have your mother anymore. So for example things in
my life I’d want to talk about with her, I can’t. In that sense she is completely
gone. At ﬁrst, when you notice she’s losing her memory you try to introduce
some memory games, but it becomes less and less. The entire process I have
been saying goodbye. You are left with a fragment, a kind of mother,
something that remains. Because she is still here.’’

The family members I spoke with thus expressed the uncanny feeling that they
were losing the person with dementia (‘‘she is completely gone’’) while they
continued to be a part of their lives (‘‘she is still here’’). Researcher and therapist in
family studies Pauline Boss (1999, 2011) has termed this ‘‘ambiguous loss,’’ which
refers to an experience of loss that is uncertain, partial, and indeﬁnite, yet that may
immobilize and ‘‘freeze people in place so that they can’t move on with their lives’’
(1999:20). Further, this experience has been conceptualized in a variety of ways.
Sharon Kaufman, for example, has suggested that the categories of life and death
can become blurred, and refers to this as a ‘‘zone of indistinction’’ (2005:62) or a
‘‘gray zone’’ (2005:1, 2006:40). She emphasizes that not only the person with
dementia themselves may experience a ‘‘dislocation of the self,’’ but also relatives
and others involved may encounter a form of dislocation from the person with
dementia (2018:556). In so doing, she builds on the work of Janelle Taylor, who
observes that people with dementia are often not granted recognition in society, and
who advocates a different way of looking at people with dementia, focused on care,
so as to involve them ‘‘as fully social persons and members of a community’’
(2008:315).

This ambiguous experience has also been debated extensively in terms of
personhood, as early conceptualizations of personhood revolved around cognitive
aspects such as memory, control, and rationality, effectively excluding people with
dementia (Sweeting and Gilhooly 1990). Challenging the idea that dementia
the concept has been reframed to include
constitutes a loss of personhood,
relationality and the capacities of people with dementia (Kitwood 1993, 1997).
Since then, acknowledgement for how personhood is maintained through relations
and recognition of the particular care needs and preferences of the person with
dementia have become central in these debates (Moser 2011; Buch 2015; Grøn

123

Cult Med Psychiatry (2023) 47:701–721

709

forthcoming). Others have described the ambiguity of absence and presence in terms
of ‘‘social death’’ (Sweeting and Gilhooly 1990; see also Kra´lova´ 2015; Mulkay
1993; Sudnow 1967) or ‘‘bare life’’ (Leibing 2006), which have been used to reveal
and challenge the normative frames through which life with dementia is
apprehended. These conceptualizations, in other words, reveal the social exclusion
of people with dementia from the normative and social frames that make for a
meaningful life (Kaufman 2006), and counter dominant biomedical approaches that
individualize dementia in the brain and body and that focus solely on the
progression of decline (Moser 2011). It thus becomes apparent that dementia can
challenge the normal order of things at the end of life. Trying to bring her own
experience into words, Els said:

‘‘It is a very strange sadness. It’s grief. Because she is there, but also isn’t.
That’s what is so difﬁcult. I visit every week, and then I am very happy to have
come, because it makes her so happy. That is wonderful. But well, I don’t have
my mother anymore.’’

Tears began to well up in her eyes as she continued:

‘‘Actually, it is terrible. So many emotions, but you know you have to keep
going. You keep it in to keep it manageable. I try not to give in to that too
much, not to think about the sadness of it all. And certainly not to treat her as
if she is not there, to the contrary. I want to keep alive what we still have. And
when that succeeds, it makes me happy.’’

Hence, while Boss has theorized that ambiguous loss ‘immobilizes’ and prevents
people from adjusting (1999), I rather show that in the experience of ambiguity,
family members of people with dementia experience grief and simultaneously ﬁnd
ways to cope with this,
to continue life by searching for ways to maintain
meaningful relations.

Moments of (Dis)connection

As I described above, Patrick told me he was aware of the gradual, ‘‘stepwise’’
decline his mother went through and struggled with the ambiguous sense that he was
already grieving while she was still alive. On his Sunday afternoon visits, he always
brought a bottle of white wine. At that time, Patrick’s mother was bedridden and
unable to verbally communicate. In the wine, he seemed to have found a way to
make contact. ‘‘I felt the pain of seeing her declining,’’ he continued, ‘‘but you could
also see that she was still able to enjoy certain things. So I brought a good bottle for
the two of us, to enjoy together. She loved a nice Sauvignon. I would let her smell
the wine ﬁrst. And then we would just ﬁnish the bottle together.’’ Even though at
times it felt as if he already lost her, Patrick was able to recognize and conﬁrm his
mother’s presence and their relationship through a meaningful object—the wine. He
put great effort in ﬁnding ways to sustain the relationship between them, creating
moments they could share that make a continuing bond possible. In his experience
of disconnection, Patrick found moments of connection.

Through such efforts of care, family members negotiated the ambiguity of
absence and presence they experienced. Repeatedly, they looked for opportunities in
light of what is lost and what is still possible. For example, in the second month of
my ﬁeldwork, Paul moved into the nursing home. He was in his mid-eighties and
had been an organ player and teacher. His wife, Annemiek, sang in a church choir.
Music played an important part in their lives. Paul was a very gentle man but was
often restless and demanded much attention, which he expressed by yelling at others
every other minute, ‘‘Hey, you! Come over here! Sit down here,’’ pointing at the
chair next to him. Annemiek had compiled a playlist on an iPod with music and
sounds that she considered part of his biography. The motivation for this was
twofold: it allowed Paul to listen to music that he enjoyed, while it was also an
attempt to calm him down.2

Annemiek visited him several times per week. She said: ‘‘You know, every time I
am on my way here I feel a certain anxiety, a tension, and it is because I never know
in what mood he will be.’’ One afternoon, she brought a small keyboard with her
and played it in the living room, while Paul and other residents listened. After a
couple of songs she placed the keyboard in front of Paul. In his attempt to play, his
ﬁngers moved stifﬂy across the keys and created a fragmented melody. Annemiek
turned toward me with a sad look and said ‘‘he is not as good as he used to be.’’
Annemiek, like many family members, was concerned with how he was changing
and the uncertainties this involved. And like many others, she tried to make the best
of the situation by seeking ways to connect. However, while she had brought the
keyboard to generate a way of being together that reﬂected activities they used to
share, Paul’s inability to play as he used to also made his receding capacities visible:
a confrontation with loss in seeing what was no longer possible.

Such a sense of coinciding connection and disconnection also came to the fore
when Annemiek told me that she and Paul used to listen to Radio 4, a channel for
classical music. Now that Paul lived in the nursing home, she had asked the care
staff to turn on the radio in his room. Oftentimes when she was listening to the radio
at home, she wondered: ‘‘Does he have the radio on at this moment? Is he also
listening to this piece?’’ Simultaneously listening to the same music, created the
idea of being connected while apart. For Annemiek and Paul, then, music allowed
the bond between them to continue in several ways: as something they could share,
listening and playing together, or that made Annemiek relate to Paul when they
were away from each other. But it also painfully underscored the several losses.

Gerda, too, was confronted with what was no longer possible precisely in her

attempt to connect with her mother who lived in a nursing home. She told me:

‘‘I had bought peas. We used to shuck them together, so when I was at the
market I thought, oh peas, yes that will be nice, like we used to do. But when I
gave them to her she had no idea what to do with them. Even after I showed
her, she couldn’t.’’

2 While the effect of music on people with dementia is beyond the scope of this article, there have been
lively public and academic debates on music as a way of making contact with, and stimulating the
capacities of people with dementia. See, for example, McDermott et al. (2014).

Similar to Patrick, who brought wine, and Annemiek, through music, Gerda
brought peas with the intention to create a shared activity that reﬂected their past,
and continuing relation. However, while she looked for a way to maintain a
connection through a meaningful object (the peas), the seeming failure of this
attempt made the loss tangible. Anticipatory grief and meaningful relations, or loss
and connection, then, do not stand in dual opposition to each other. Rather, they ﬁt
together and can emerge simultaneously or from each other.

In this way, the relationship with the person with dementia can oscillate between
connection and disconnection. Family members continuously readjust how to
connect, as they care for, and move along with the process of dementia. They look
for what the person is still capable of, and what forms of connection are still
possible. Inspired by the work of Elinor Fuchs (2005, in Taylor 2008), who referred
to this as ‘‘stills,’’ Janelle Taylor (2008:316) writes that ‘‘the ‘stills’ are paralleled by
‘ﬁrsts’.’’ An attunement to ‘‘stills,’’ in other words, also involves moments at which
it becomes clear for the ﬁrst time that the person with dementia is unable to do
something she was capable of doing earlier in life. Both ‘‘ﬁrsts’’ and ‘‘stills’’ can be
painful and joyful (Taylor 2008). For Gerda, the ﬁrst time she realized her mother
was unable to shuck peas came as a confrontation with loss. Her sister, Monica,
shared a very different experience. She told me about a dancing afternoon organized
in the nursing home, where, for the ﬁrst time in her life she had danced with her
mother. In some cases, then, ‘‘ﬁrsts’’ referred to new ways of making contact. It is
thus vital to understand that ‘‘grief can also constitute ways of relating, of giving,
and of receiving’’ (Danely 2014:105), and be seen as a constant negotiation between
moments of loss and joy.

Maintaining (Inter)subjectivity

In these moments of connection and disconnection, wherein my interlocutors sought
to maintain their relationship with the person with dementia, not only the
intersubjective bond was considered to be at stake and re-emphasized, but also the
subjectivity of the person with dementia. This resonates with scholarship that has in
recent years focused on various practices and dynamics of care through which the
subjectivity of the person with dementia is maintained (Buch 2015; Seaman 2020;
Taylor 2008). In her work on a closed dementia ward in Norway, Ingunn Moser
presents what she calls a ‘‘relational approach to life and dementia’’ (2011:708),
demonstrating how professional caregivers would maintain the person with
dementia in relations through practices involving music and food. Similarly, in
her study of home care for older adults in the United States, Elana Buch
(2013, 2018) explores how the embodied practices of care workers may sustain the
personhood, ways of life, and sense of self of the elders. Also primarily working in
the United States, Janelle Taylor (2017) writes on dementia and friendship, and
suggests that friends, family, and health professionals of people with dementia are
actively involved in moral and social experimentation with art and relationships, so
as to maintain connections and personhood. These studies have thus elucidated, in

123

712

various ways, how care practices for older adults and people with dementia, may be
oriented toward sustaining their subjectivity and relationality.

In a similar vein, I observed that family members placed much emphasis on who
the person with dementia was. They sought to conﬁrm continuity, that this person
was ‘‘still here.’’ Patrick told me that, after his father had passed away, his mother
started studying and traveling. He described her as a ‘‘petite madame, like a
Franc¸aise’’ who had always loved a good glass of wine. Hence, he linked the wine
he brought on his visits speciﬁcally to his mother’s person. It represented an aspect
of her life in the past that she valued and enjoyed. Bringing a bottle of wine with
him on his visits to his mother in the nursing home, then, was not only a way to
create an activity together and maintain the bond between them. Doing so also
conﬁrmed the person she had been and still was.

In a different case, I brought Ms. Kortrijk to the hairdresser, which was located
downstairs in the nursing home complex. While the hairdresser washed Ms.
Kortrijk’s hair and put hair curlers in, she told me that she knew Ms. Kortrijk well.
‘‘How often people come here differs per person,’’ she said. ‘‘Some people I see
every week, others only once a month or even less. It very much depends on the
family.’’ In Ms. Kortrijk’s case, her family had agreed with the nursing home that
she would be brought to the hairdresser every other week. When I later spoke to Ms.
Kortrijk’s sister, she brought this up herself, and said:

She always looks presentable, which I ﬁnd very important. These are things
she has always cared about. She was a real fashion doll, later she became a
model. She always looked amazing, with high heels, tightly dressed, and her
hair in tip-top shape from the hairdresser. If you look at pictures of her, you
will see how she was, really a beautiful woman. So we ﬁnd it important to
continue this aspect of her.

In this sense, family members were actively involved in cultivating situations
through which to nurture the activities, objects, and environment that had been of
importance to the person with dementia in the past. The objects and practices
through which they did so, were thus also considered signiﬁcant to the relationship
and the person, as carrying the potential of connection and to uphold subjectivity. In
many cases, this involved bringing material objects that had been of signiﬁcance in
the past, into the present, as in Patrick’s case with the wine.

Just as family members found it important to share moments with the person with
dementia, and were involved in the maintenance of subjectivity, people with
dementia themselves were also concerned with upholding a sense of self when they
felt this was slipping away from them. Bob, for example, a 60 year old man who
had dementia and lived at home with his wife, was passionate about old cars, and
was helping a friend to ﬁx his 1959 Mercedes. Together, they were taking apart and
reassembling the vehicle. ‘‘What I ﬁnd difﬁcult,’’ Bob said, was that ‘‘I used to just
throw all those parts in a box, and I would easily remember what it contained.’’
Now, his friend had prepared and labeled small storage boxes for all the different
parts and bolts. As they were reassembling the car, his friend would hand Bob the
right parts, allowing Bob to exert his knowledge of how to assemble them and get
the car running again. ‘‘I told him, if you mess with these boxes, that car is never

123

Cult Med Psychiatry (2023) 47:701–721

713

going to be back in one piece.’’ While writing, typing, reading, making phone calls,
had all become increasingly difﬁcult, his ability to work with mechanics largely
remained, and so he proudly told me that he had recently ﬁxed a neighbor’s
dishwasher. ‘‘I then take pictures of it to remind myself how to put it back
together.’’ He was aware of the gradual diminishing of certain abilities, and knew
that he had become unable to do things by himself as he used to. ‘‘My handwriting
was always terrible, but now I can’t even read it myself,’’ he commented. Yet
together with others he was able to practice his hobbies and to continue to exercise
his long-standing insights in mechanics. These were important moments for Bob,
which allowed him to keep his world going through practices and objects that
mattered to him, in relation to others.

Family members and people with dementia themselves thus responded to a
perceived loss through objects and practices that were considered important to the
person with dementia. Also professional caregivers in the nursing home, I observed,
continuously sought to provide care in ways that matched with each particular
resident. They often insisted on explicitly addressing people by their name, and it
was quite common for them to attribute choices they made in providing care to the
preferences of residents, for example by helping a resident who was ‘‘not a morning
person’’ to get out of bed only after the others had been helped.

There may be a risk of ﬁxating the person with dementia by attempting to
maintain subjectivity in this way. Hilde Lindemann (2014) describes how the
maintenance of personhood in interaction with others can occur through holding on
and letting go of aspects of their identity. She emphasizes that being ‘‘held’’ in
personhood may not be a positive experience but rather may be a site of friction
between the different actors involved—an insight that rings especially true when
family members hold on to aspects of the identity of the person with dementia that
may have changed through the course of the illness. In some cases, as described
above, my interlocutors experienced loss not just when the person became unable to
participate in a certain activity, but when this inability represented a loss of their
supposed identity. Still, the efforts of family members and people with dementia
themselves to uphold a sense of identity, even if sometimes faltering, may be
understood as attempts to cope with the ambiguous experiences of loss and
connection. As I will describe next, these experiences are not only a response to
present changes, but also anticipatory—as in relating to, and preparing for, the
future.

Grieving in Anticipation

Patrick emphasized that the bottle of white wine he brought on his weekly visits to
his mother in the nursing home should be ‘‘a good one, since every glass could be
her last one. I even stopped buying wine at the nursing home restaurant. I don’t want
her to have bad wine as her last.’’ His preoccupation with the quality of the wine
reﬂected his awareness that his mother’s death was approaching, even if it was
uncertain when this would be. His efforts to maintain a connection, then, were not
only framed by the losses he had already experienced—the wine being one of the

123

714

Cult Med Psychiatry (2023) 47:701–721

few things they could still enjoy together—but also by the anticipation of losses to
come. ‘‘Emotionally, you want to keep your mother with you as long as possible,’’
Patrick said, ‘‘and I can see that she was still able to experience pleasure. But on the
other hand, the nursing home, as I see it, is the last station. I have been calling it
death’s waiting room for a reason.’’ Like Patrick, many of my interlocutors expected
further degeneration, and the eventual death of their relative with dementia. Even as
they found moments of connection and enjoyment, their experiences were also
colored by this looming horizon. Their grief, then, related both to present and future
losses. It indeed involves anticipation, in that it pertains to the expectation of, and
preparation for, losses to come. And even as many of them felt they had ‘‘already
lost’’ their relative with dementia, death increasingly came into view as an imminent
prospect, and as an object of grief in the present.

I suggest that the anticipatory character of this grief lies in that it relates to a
projected future with tangible implications in the present.
I build here on
anthropological explorations of the future that have shown that past, present and
future are interwoven and mutually constituted (Mattingly 2014; Munn 1992;
Bryant and Knight 2019). Anticipation, as I have elaborated elsewhere (Lemos
Dekker 2021), can be understood as a temporal orientation that draws the future into
the present, while also keeping it at bay, as being ‘‘not yet.’’ It involves the creation
of future imaginaries, which may then inform and legitimize actions and affects in
the present (Adams et al. 2009; Bryant and Knight 2019) and is grounded in lived
experiences (Stephan and Flaherty 2019). Anticipatory grief, then, is to grieve a loss
that is still to occur; to already feel it, prepare for it, and act upon it. Simultaneously,
these losses that are expected to happen, are folded into the experience of losses that
occur in the present or that have already happened (see also Olson 2014). The
‘‘stills’’ and ‘‘ﬁrsts’’ that, as I described above, are part of the experience of ‘‘going
down a staircase,’’ whereby each step is accompanied by uncertainties that may
trigger grief, also point at changes that are yet to come. The experience of grief
becomes iterative, accumulative, and prelusive, all at once.

Many of my interlocutors indicated that they were preparing themselves, in one
way or another, for the expected death of their relative with dementia. This was also
the case in Sonja and Ina’s situation. Their mother had been living in the nursing
home for a number of years and, at the time that I interviewed them, she was
bedridden. The sisters took turns in visiting her, and were additionally involved in
volunteering at the nursing home, by making pancakes for the entire unit every few
weeks. When I interviewed Sonja for the ﬁrst time, she admitted to being quite
nervous for our conversation, ﬁnding it difﬁcult to talk about her mother without
becoming ‘‘too emotional.’’ It could often be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a quiet spot to talk on
the ward, so from time to time I could use the small ofﬁce of the nursing home
manager for interviews. Being able to close the door behind us, allowed for more
privacy and to talk more at ease. During our conversation, Sonja reﬂected on the
different ways in which she was preparing for her mother’s death. ‘‘I want to give a
speech at my mother’s cremation. But when I sit down, only tears come up and I get
nothing on paper. So now I think, maybe I will think of something once she has
passed away.’’ Sonja and Ina had been looking through pictures of their mother for
the funeral card, had selected clothes they thought their mother should be dressed in

123

Cult Med Psychiatry (2023) 47:701–721

715

at the funeral, and had discussed what to do with her ashes afterward. ‘‘All these
things to think about,’’ Sonja sighed, ‘‘but perhaps it’s easier now. So that, when the
moment is there, we can say goodbye and just be sad, not having to arrange all this.
Because we can do all of these things in advance.’’ Sonja pointed at being able to
make arrangements for her mother’s funeral, already weeks and months before she
eventually passed away. This involved making meaningful preparations for the end
of life, as well as anticipating the loss itself. ‘‘I really like the song Mama, by Il
Divo, and we want to play this at the cremation ceremony,’’ Sonja explained with
watery eyes. ‘‘So now I am already practicing to listen to it without bursting into
tears. I often listen to it while making dinner, but then I can’t hold myself and start
to sob.’’

Two weeks after this conversation with Sonja, I spoke to her sister Ina, about
their mother’s end of life. She said that she thought she was ready for it, knowing
that ‘‘it will happen anyway. It’s like a dark cloud hanging over me.’’ She continued:

‘‘I take this possibility into account in everything I do. A few weeks ago, I
took a little vacation, but we decided not to go too far. Because what if we get
called and would have to get back here in the middle of the night? Then we
wouldn’t be able to return on time. It’s very tiring, to constantly have to take
this into account. I do everything I would normally do, but it’s always on my
mind. It’s like being in a waiting room.’’

Like many other interlocutors, Sonja and Ina were attuned to their mother’s
approaching death. Being moved by this anticipated loss, then, also meant being
moved toward it (see also Ahmed 2004). To anticipate is directional, oriented
toward a particular future. In preparing for this moment, by making a funeral card,
trying to write a speech, and making decisions in everyday life, or, as in Patrick’s
case, by bringing a good bottle of wine because each time it could be the last one,
they acted upon a loss that had not occurred yet. Also the experience of waiting, of
being ‘‘on hold,’’ which many of my interlocutors brought up, shows how they were
focused on a moment that had not arrived yet but which they knew was going to
occur. Further, anticipation is affective, as others have pointed out (Ahmed 2004;
Adams et al. 2009). After my initial conversations with Sonja and Ina, it would take
another couple of months before their mother eventually passed away. Nevertheless,
in their experience, this future moment had been very near and concrete, almost as if
it was a reality already. It involved hurt, sadness, and frustration. And at the same
time, Ina also indicated that she was thankful for having the time to prepare for her
mother’s death, being able ‘‘to just be with her, to touch her.’’

Conclusion

In this article, I have shown that, in the experiences my interlocutors shared with
me, loss and connection are continuously interwoven, that efforts to maintain a
relationship with the person with dementia in the face of loss are also aimed at
sustaining their subjectivity, and that anticipatory grief pertains to accumulating
losses experienced in the present together with expected, future losses.

With this, I have asked what we can learn from grief in life, and how to account
for this anticipatory grief anthropologically? An anthropological approach to
anticipatory grief can reveal the nuanced and equivocal character of experiences of
illness and at the end of life. From my interlocutors’ experiences, it becomes
apparent how they struggled with this ambiguity. I was repeatedly struck by their
expressions of having ‘‘already lost’’ the person with dementia, but was impressed
equally so by their persistence in ﬁnding ways to care and connect with the person
and uphold their subjectivity. For my interlocutors, who cared for a family member
with dementia, or who had dementia themselves, this was indeed an experience of
grief. But
togetherness and potentiality. In some
instances, the search for connection precisely formed a confrontation with loss,
while at the same time implied that there was still room for adaptation and
negotiation. This experience shows that loss and connection are not opposites, but
revolve around one another, whereby one may emerge from the other and both may
combine into a single experience. Without reinforcing stereotypical representations
of dementia, I have sought to do justice to both the grief—it’s loss, sadness, and
frustration—and the joy and creativity with which my interlocutors found ways of
being together and going through life. This entanglement, I suggest, is essential to
understanding anticipatory grief.

it was also one of contact,

Anticipatory grief is by no means limited to dementia. At the same time,
reﬂecting on dementia as I have done here, reveals some of the workings of
anticipatory grief, and may be suggestive to how it develops in other circumstances.
Grief can take place in relation to losses that occurred in the past and that are
expected to happen in the future. This may involve changes in selves and
relationships, as well as the (anticipated) grief for the loss of a person. Preparing for
loss can take many different forms, which may include planning activities, adapting
expectations, and recalling past experiences. The experiences and practices of my
interlocutors show how anticipatory grief can play an important role in preparing for
changes that are yet to come. I have shown that understanding the grief for a loss
that is yet to occur, requires bringing into view how present and future relate to one
another. Grief for what has been lost, and grief for what will be lost, then become
woven into a single experience.

In these everyday negotiations of loss and connection, future and present thus
become entwined, in that these experiences relate both the current situation and to
expected changes. In anticipatory grief, then, the loss itself is both experienced and
projected. The end of life did not suddenly or unexpectedly present itself to my
interlocutors, but gradually came into view as dementia progressed. While dementia
can be a confrontation with loss, the possibility to enjoy life and to create shared,
meaningful moments also remains. And whereas certain situations may seem
unbearable beforehand, once they occur people may learn to cope with them (Pols
and Limburg 2016). Hence, as the condition of the person with dementia changed,
my interlocutors time and again sought new ways to adapt and secure the bond
between them. And even though it would remain uncertain how exactly the person
with dementia would change or how fast the disease would progress, they were
already looking ahead for what might then still be possible. ‘‘That means, doing
everything that’s possible. Looking at old photographs, bringing sweets and fruits

she loved, letting her enjoy the wine,’’ Patrick said, showing that, infused in loss,
was a commitment to presence.
