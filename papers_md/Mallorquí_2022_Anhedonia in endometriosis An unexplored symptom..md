Anhedonia is the diminished motivation and sensitivity to pleasurable stimuli. 
It  has  been  reported  to  be  more  prevalent  in  patients  with  chronic  pain  as 
compared  to  healthy  controls.  Endometriosis  is  a  chronic  inflammatory 
systemic  disease  with  a  significant  psychosocial  impact  that  compromises 
wellbeing  and  the  day-to-day  life  of  patients.  Women  with  endometriosis 
show  significant  psychological  distress,  even  more  pervasive  when  chronic 
pelvic  pain  is  present.  In  the  current  review  we  will  discuss  the  role  of 
anhedonia in endometriotic chronic pelvic pain. We will also present new lines 
of research that could lead to more fully clarifying the psychological impact of 
endometriosis and its detrimental repercussions to quality of life and mental 
health.

Introduction

Anhedonia is traditionally defined as the diminished ability to experience pleasure 
derived from sensory experiences or social interactions. Historically, it has been considered 
a required symptom for the diagnosis of Depressive Disorders and a residual symptom of 
Schizophrenia  (Berrios  and  Olivares,  1995;  American  Psychiatric  Association,  2013). 
However, since its first definition by Ribot in 1897, anhedonia was claimed to be present in 
“organic situations” as well as in cases of “deep melancholia.” The first scholars interested 
in anhedonia observed that it could be a temporary state triggered by depression or an 
enduring trait that characterizes an individual in a stable manner (James, 2003). More 
recently, some authors have proposed an endophenotype role for anhedonia (Hasler et al., 
2004; Pizzagalli et al., 2005; Auerbach et al., 2019), considering it a vulnerability marker 
present before the onset of depression with the potential to lead to a more pervasive form 
of the disorder (Shankman et al., 2010).

In 2008, the American Psychiatric Association launched the RDoC (Research Domain 
Criteria)  framework  in  mental  health  (Insel  et  al.,  2010).  This  research  framework 
transitions away from the traditional diagnostic categories to a dimensional approach 
focused on the analysis of psychological processes and symptoms (Cuthbert, 2014). In this 
context, anhedonia has been considered in the RdoC framework matrix as a behavioral

correlate  of  the  negative  valence  system,  which  is  the  system 
responsible  for  responding  to  aversive  situations,  such  as  fear, 
anxiety, or loss.
Anhedonia 

it  summarizes 
is  not  unitary,  contrarily 
multifaceted reward-related deficits with distinctive behavioral 
and affective manifestations (Franken et al., 2007; Auerbach et al., 
2019).  Traditionally,  it  comprised  two  distinctive  aspects:  (i) 
physical  anhedonia,  which  is  the  blunted  hedonic  response  to 
physical rewarding stimuli, and (ii) social anhedonia, which is the 
inability to experience pleasure derived from social interactions 
(Chapman et al., 1976; Snaith et al., 1995). The Physical Anhedonia 
Scale  and  Social  Anhedonia  Scale  were  the  first  psychometric 
instruments used for measuring anhedonia. Interestingly, some 
items included in gold-standard depression instruments, such as 
the  Beck  Depression  Inventory  or  the  Hospital  Anxiety  and 
Depression  Scales,  have  also  been  used  to  assess  anhedonia 
(Pizzagalli et al., 2005; Langvik et al., 2016).

More recently, anhedonia has been parsed in two distinctive 
components comprising anticipatory and consummatory aspects 
of the pleasure experience. Anticipation of pleasure refers to the 
motivation  of  the  individual  toward  rewarding  stimuli  that 
activate goal-directed behavior (also known as “wanting states” in 
the neuroscientific literature; Berridge and Kringelbach, 2011). 
Consummation refers to the liking experience, or the positive 
emotions  elicited  by  satiation  (“liking  effects”  using  Berridge 
terminology). This dual distinction of the hedonic capacity has 
been well captured in humans using psychometric measures and 
neuroimaging techniques (Mallorquí et al., 2014).

At  the  neural  level,  pleasurable  and  hedonic  experiences 
recruit  an  extended  neural  network  of  cortico-subcortical 
structures involved in the regulation of motivational and reward 
processing. Over the last decade, the use of various neuroimaging 
techniques has enabled a better understanding of the neural bases 
at  work  in  the  reward  system  (Wise,  2002;  Panksepp,  2004; 
Robbins  and  Everitt,  2006;  Berridge  and  Kringelbach,  2008; 
Camara et al., 2009; Haber and Knutson, 2010), mostly regions in 
the  mesocorticolimbic  circuits:  the  ventral  striatum  (a  core 
structure  in  reward  processing),  the  amygdala,  the  prefrontal 
cortex (including the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex or the anterior cingulate cortex), as well as the hippocampal, 
hypothalamus and insular cortex (Knutson et al., 2001; Yacubian 
et al., 2006; see for a recent meta-analysis Sescousse et al., 2013). 
Most importantly, midbrain neurons from the substantia nigra 
and ventral tegmental area provide dopaminergic input through 
the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways to the ventral striatum 
and prefrontal cortex, regulating the impact and anticipation of 
hedonic experiences (see Figure 1).

In  recent  years,  anhedonia  has  gained  interest  in  health 
beyond psychiatric disorders (Assogna et al., 2011; Treadway and 
Zald, 2011; Loas, 2014; Mallorquí et al., 2014; Ritsner, 2014a,b). Its 
transdiagnostic  features  and  presence  in  non-clinical  samples 
(Harvey et al., 2007) have stimulated new lines of clinical research 
that  highligh  the  crucial  role  of  anhedonia  in  chronic  health 
conditions,  such  as  chronic  pain.  Importantly  for  the  present 

review, Garland and colleagues (Garland et al., 2020) have recently 
shown for first time that individuals with different types of chronic 
pain reported greater levels of anhedonia compared to a well-
matched and large sample of healthy controls. More specifically, 
this  association  was  independent  from  a  clinical  diagnosis  of 
Major Depressive Disorder, showing a more complex relationship 
than the traditional pairing of anhedonia with a subjacent mental 
health disorder. Subsequently, Carpinelli and colleagues found a 
significant positive correlation between anhedonia and chronic 
abdominal  pain  sufferers,  with  this  relationship  not  being 
mediated  by  depression  (Carpinelli  et  al.,  2019).  Both  studies 
highlight the scarcity of studies addressing anhedonia in chronic 
pain and suggest an urgent need for more research in this arena.

Endometriosis  is  a  highly  prevalent  chronic  inflammatory 
disease where endometrial-like tissue is found outside the uterus, 
commonly around pelvic areas (Taylor et al., 2021). Rarer cases 
can present endometrial implants in extrapelvic sites, such as the 
gastrointestinal and urinary tracts or in more distant areas like the 
thorax,  the  central  nervous  system  or  even  the  nasal  cavity 
(Mignemi et al., 2012). Usual symptoms include cyclic or chronic 
pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, dyspareunia and infertility. 
Moreover,  quality  of  life,  psychological  wellbeing,  and  mental 
health are significantly compromised (Facchin et al., 2015; Vitale 
et al., 2017). In the present review we will address the psychological 
impact of endometriosis with special attention to chronic pelvic 
pain and the associated decline of hedonic tone. Finally, we aim to 
present a new hypothesis on the possible role of anhedonia in 
endometriosis  in  order  to  provide  a  more  fine-grained 
psychological perspective that could help in developing new lines 
of intervention.

Psychosocial  impact  of 
endometriosis

Recently  recognized  as  a  chronic,  systemic  inflammatory 
disease,  endometriosis  is  estimated  to  affect  between  1  in  10 
women of reproductive age, globally (Taylor et al., 2021). Pelvic 
pain and infertility are usually mentioned as common symptoms; 
however, endometriosis is mostly characterized by a plethora of 
multifactorial chronic and disabling effects on the body. Symptoms 
include pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual pelvic pain, 
infertility, dyspareunia, dyschezia, dysuria, fatigue, and depression, 
with a considerable variability in the clinical presentation and level 
of  affectation  in  patients.  Moreover,  some  severe  forms  of  the 
disease present alterations of bladder and bowel function with a 
clear significant reduction in quality of life (Spagnolo et al., 2014).
The pathogenesis of endometriosis is still unknown. Given the 
substantial comorbidity of endometriosis with autoimmune diseases 
and the described malfunctioning of many autoimmune cells in 
women with endometriosis, some authors suggest a possible causal 
association (Mignemi et al., 2012; Riccio et al., 2018). Thus, a putative 
abnormal immune response in the peritoneal environment would 
allow  the  proliferation  of  endometrial  cells  in  peripheral  sites

contributing to the development of the disease (Riccio et al., 2018). 
In this sense, endometriosis should be considered multifactorial in 
its etiology, similarly to other autoimmune diseases where emotional 
stress can act both as a trigger and as a consequence of the disease. 
This can result in a vicious cycle that ultimately increases the risk of 
developing a mood disorder (Stojanovich and Marisavljevich, 2008; 
Benros et al., 2013).

Diagnosis delay and misdiagnosis are one of the problems 
consistently reported by endometriosis patients (Hudelist et al., 
2012; Taylor et al., 2021). The scientific literature is starting to 
point out to social normalization of dysmenorhea as one of the 
main reasons behind the average 10-year delay for the diagnosis 
(Culley  et  al.,  2013;  Taylor  et  al.,  2021).  From  the  Health 
Psychology  literature,  it  has  already  been  demonstrated  that 
normalization in chronic health diseases not only hinders medical 
diagnosis and treatment, but also has an impact on the person’s 
cognitive construction of the disease and deters the person from 
adopting  positive  health  behaviors  and  appropriate  coping 
strategies.  Moreover,  when  normalization  is  enacted  by  close 
family and friends, it yields unsupportive social interactions that 
undermine how the person perceives, appraises, and adapts to the 
disease (Helgeson and Zajdel, 2017).

Beyond  its  physical  symptoms  and  body  systemic  impact, 
endometriosis  presents  a  substantial  comorbidity  with  mental 

health symptoms and disorders (Laganà et al., 2015, 2017a,b). 
Currently, depression and anxiety have been the psychological 
outcomes most often discussed in the endometriosis literature 
(Delanerolle  et  al.,  2021).  Studies  consistently  report  a  higher 
prevalence  of  depression  in  women  with  endometriosis  as 
compared with other groups. As has been reported in a recent 
meta-analysis,  this  effect  increases  significantly  when  the 
comparison comprises exclusively well-matched, healthy controls 
(Gambadauro  et  al.,  2019).  Interestingly,  in  2021,  another 
systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  reported  a  prevalence  of 
28.9%  for  depression  and  31.8%  for  anxiety  (Delanerolle 
et al., 2021).

Besides the symptom-quantitative approach, in 2016, Chen 
and  colleagues  (Chen  et  al.,  2016),  using  the  Taiwan  National 
Health Insurance Research Database comprising 10,439 women, 
reported an increased risk in developing major depressive disorder 
(hazard  ratio:  1.56,  95%,  CI:1.24–1.97)  and  anxiety  disorders 
(hazard  ratio:  1.44,  95%  CI:  1.22–1.70).  Utilizing  the  same 
methodology, the same research group also published an increased 
prevalence  of  bipolar  disorder  in  patients  with  endometriosis 
(Chen et al., 2020). However, neither study presented quantitative 
data supporting the clinical psychiatric diagnosis. This lack of 
objective  measurement  of  the  symptomatology  as  well  as  the 
neglect of the chronic health context compelled by endometriosis

itself has been criticized in the literature (Vitale et al., 2016; Laganà 
et  al.,  2017a,b),  Further  limitations  such  as  the  absence  of 
information regarding endometriosis severity, stage of disease and 
symptom  profile  compromise  obtaining  a  more  nuanced 
understanding  of  the  relationship  between  endometriosis  and 
psychiatric disorders (Vitale et al., 2016). Another relevant factor 
to unravel this relationship is the impact of long-term hormonal 
contraceptives, which are the first line of medical treatment for 
endometriosis (Barbara et al., 2021). Despite the general patient 
satisfaction with treatment and the reported increase in quality of 
life  and  emotional  wellbeing  in  women  with  endometriosis, 
combined  oral  contraceptives  have  been  associated  with  a 
subsequent use of antidepressants and a first depression diagnosis, 
with  progestin-only  products  presenting  the  highest  risk 
(Skovlund et al., 2016).

Endometriosis impacts assumptions about the self and the 
world held by patients, disrupting perceptions of continuity that 
are  necessary  to  guide  individuals  in  their  everyday  lives. 
Symptoms can affect a female’s sense of identity, education, work 
plans, sexuality and social functioning among others (Facchin 
et al., 2017; Vitale et al., 2017). Enhancing different areas of the 
self, such as self-esteem, body image or self-efficacy, which are 
necessary to cope with any chronic disease, could have a positive 
impact in reducing psychological distress (Helgeson and Zajdel, 
2017).  Notably,  in  2017,  in  a  study  looking  for  predictors  of 
psychological distress in endometriosis, Facchin and colleagues 
(Facchin  et  al.,  2017)  demonstrated  that  patients  with  a  more 
preserved self, as measured by a compound of variables, showed 
better  mental  health  outcomes.  These  results  highlight  the 
necessity to apply multimodal treatments to endometriosis and to 
move away from the biomedical approach. In the same vein in 
2020,  O’Hara  and  colleagues.  Published  the  results  of  a  cross-
sectional survey of women with endometriosis in the Australian 
National Action Plan for Endometriosis that highlighted the need 
to engage with a multidisciplinary team of health practitioners to 
manage  the  disease  (O’Hara  et  al.,  2020).  Consistently,  this 
multidisciplinary approach has been suggested elsewhere in the 
specialized  literature  as  well  (Buggio  et  al.,  2017;  Chapron 
et al., 2019).

However, given the variability in the clinical presentation of 
symptoms,  the  deleterious  effects  of  endometriosis  on  mental 
health cannot be understood without considering the role of pain 
and  its  behavioral  consequences.  Henceforth,  we  will  focus 
exclusively  on  chronic  pelvic  pain  (CPP),  a  symptom  directly 
related to reward processing.

Chronic  pelvic  pain  in 
endometriosis:  Psychological 
distress  and  anhedonia

Chronic  pelvic  pain  is  the  most  prevalent  presentation 
symptom of endometriosis (Coxon et al., 2018). More than 60% 
of  women  with  endometriosis  report  CPP  (Maddern  et  al., 

2020). As has been highlighted by some authors, chronic pain 
can  be  considered  a  repeated  stressor  (Coxon  et  al.,  2018). 
Interestingly,  pain  and  stress  show  significant  conceptual, 
physiological  and  neuroanatomical  commonalities.  Both  are 
adaptive in protecting the individual from, for example, physical 
injury or exhaustion; however, when they become chronic, they 
lead  the  individual  toward  long-term  physiological  and 
psychological changes that can severely compromise health and 
quality of life (Abdallah and Geha, 2017). Opioid misuse, abuse 
and addiction have been consistently associated with chronic 
pain as well as suicidality. In 2015, a systematic review of 38 
studies reported rates of misuse ranging from 21% to 29% and 
rates  of  addiction  from  8%  to  12%  (Vowles  et  al.,  2015). 
Regarding suicide, in 2006, an integrative review of the literature 
conducted by Tang and Crane reported a lifetime prevalence of 
suicide  attempts  that  ranged  between  5%  and  14%  and  a 
prevalence  of  suicidal  ideation  of  20%  among  individuals 
suffering from chronic pain (Tang and Crane, 2006). These data 
confirm the irrefutable relevance of chronic pain as a global 
public health concern.

In  the  case  of  Endometriosis,  when  CPP  is  present,  the 
prevalence of depression can increase up to 86%, demonstrating 
a steady relationship between both conditions (Lorençatto et al., 
2006).  Interestingly,  some  studies  point  out  that  CPP, 
independently from endometriosis, is the main contributor to 
the mental health and quality of life detriment (Facchin et al., 
2015). Sustained inflammation has been proposed as the main 
mechanism associated with poor mental health (Facchin et al., 
2015;  Taylor  et  al.,  2021);  however,  further  top-down 
psychological processes that impact motivation, learning, and 
decision  making  could  also  be  significant  mediators  of  this 
relationship  highlighting  the  need  to  carry  out  research  in 
this regard.

Biomedical perspectives of chronic pain have been insufficient 
to  understand  the  myriad  of  lifestyle  problems  that  patients 
encounter (Crombez et al., 2012). Thus, adopting a biopsychosocial 
approach has become a plausible way to overcome the limitations 
of  the  former  perspective.  From  a  biopsychosocial  view, 
we recognize that the origins and maintainers of pain are complex 
and  also  that  a  comprehensive  understanding  requires  an 
integration of psychological and social variables that shape the 
way in which pain is experienced.

Catastrophizing  is  a  cognitive  and  emotional  coping 
response  to  chronic  pain  that  encompasses  the  tendency  to 
focus  on  pain  symptoms  and  feelings  of  helplessness  and 
pessimism  (Sullivan  et  al.,  2001;  Martin  et  al.,  2011).  It  is  a 
negative mindset consistently associated with heightened pain 
experience. In 2011, Martin and colleagues demonstrated in a 
sample of 115 women with endometriosis that catastrophism 
predicted  a  diminished  improvement  in  pain  response  in 
endometriosis treatment at 1 year follow-up. Consistently with 
these  results,  in  2014,  Carey  and  colleagues  showed  that 
catastrophism  and  young  age,  were  both  correlated  with 
persistent  pain  following  specific  endometriosis  surgery,

reinforcing the importance of patients’ beliefs and attitudes held 
about their pain (Carey et al., 2014).

A  full  understanding  of  chronic  pain  should  consider  a 
developmental perspective. A huge body of research conducted 
with infants and adolescents has demonstrated that the repeated 
experience of pain at a very young age is a significant factor that 
increases the odds of suffering chronic pain during the lifetime. 
Furthermore, the influence of early life experiences, like stress, 
trauma or peripheral insult has also been reported to influence 
visceral  pain  (Fuentes  and  Christianson,  2018).  During 
adolescence, the central nervous system is highly plastic and 
long-lasting  changes  often  occur  in  light  of  chronic  pain. 
Therefore, suffering acute and cyclic menstrual pain episodes 
associated with undiagnosed endometriosis could pave the way 
to chronic pain as a young adult, leading to a challenging life 
where decisions about education, career or choosing a partner 
could be constrained.

At  the  present  time,  no  data  exist  on  the  capacity  to 
experience  pleasure  or  hedonics 
in  patients  suffering 
endometriosis. In light of the findings discussed in this review 
and  having  in  mind  the  high  prevalence  of  chronic  pain  in 
endometriosis,  the  clinical  screening  of  anhedonia  in  this 
population seems relevant to help us clarify the mechanisms by 
which  mental  and  behavioral  health  could  be  compromised. 
Firstly, anhedonia could be playing a role in the elevated rates of 
depression  among  endometriosis  patients  by  maintaining 
depression and negative affective states over time or even leading 
to more pervasive forms of depression. Secondly, the attention-
grabbing quality of pain could contribute in moving attentional 
resources  away  from  alternative  or  compensatory  hedonic 
experiences,  hindering  reward-related 
learning  processes 
(Garland,  2020).  Thirdly,  it  is  already  known  that  pain  could 
result  in  reward  devaluation  (Porcelli  and  Delgado,  2017), 
affecting the engagement of motivational processes involved in 
approach  and  engagement  in  pleasurable  experiences.  The 
complex interaction between these factors, (i) negative attitudes 
to the illness (catastrophizing), (ii) elevated negative affect, (iii) 
pain  attentional  overfocus  and  (iv)  decreased  motivation  to 
engage in pleasurable activities, could lead to the progressive and 
silent development of a blunted hedonic system (see Figure 2).

Therefore,  therapeutic  interventions  for  pain  release  and 
endometriosis would be more challenging in patients with higher 
anhedonia,  as  this  condition  might  prevent  patients  from 
exploring and discovering compensatory experiences that might 
help  them  defocus  from  persistent  pain.  Besides,  engaging  in 
rewarding  and  meaningful  activities  has  been  associated  with 
increased analgesia, which could contribute to the amelioration of 
chronic pain (Thompson et al., 2018; Thorn et al., 2018). Finally, 
as recent proposals of cognitive treatments for chronic pain are 
based on the idea of pain defocusing and attention reorienting 
(i.e., removing the mental contents associated to pain from the 
spotlight of attention), the chance of engaging in new rewarding 
and meaningful experiences might promote the reorientation of 
attention, improving the chances of therapeutic success.

Discussion

Endometriosis is a chronic systemic disease with a significant 
psychosocial  impact  that  compromises  the  wellbeing  and 
day-to-day life of patients. Given its heterogeneity, symptomatic 
patients  should  be  treated  by  means  of  a  patient-centered 
approach with a lifelong management plan (Chapron et al., 2019). 
Psychological and mental health comorbidities of endometriosis 
have been identified in the scientific literature. Unfortunately, 
despite the current amount of psychological data regarding the 
disease, no model has integrated in a coherent manner all of the 
correlates  found  in  the  literature,  and  therefore,  the  resulting 
psychological perspective is partially fragmented. Clarifying the 
role of anhedonia in endometriosis could be a helpful step in 
correcting this, by contributing to design more individualized 
psychological interventions, clarifying which patient needs them, 
as well as when and at what doses.

As has been highlighted throughout this review, there are no 
data available clarifying the role of anhedonia in endometriosis, 
thus many significant questions remain unanswered. Anhedonia 
could indeed be a consequence of pain, as it has been observed 
that  chronic  pain  may  alter  reward  processing  by  disrupting 
opioid signaling in the brain (Martikainen et al., 2013). However, 
further  top-down  cognitive-behavioral  processes  involved  in 
goal-setting  and  decision  making  (see  Figure  1)  could  also 
be playing a significant role; CPP could potentially distance the 
individual  from  natural  and  previously  acquired  resources  of 
pleasure  and  positive  experiences. This  could  then  result  in  a 
looping and long lasting deteriorating effect, which continues to 
worsen symptoms and illness adaptation. Ultimately, the presence 
of  anhedonia  in  healthy  individuals  independently  from 
depression should be considered in cases of endometriosis. It is 
also important to consider its associations with further disease 
symptoms, such as pelvic organ malfunctioning, which could also 
disrupt hedonic capacity.

Endometriosis has also an impact in interpersonal aspects 
such as sexual and social functioning (Vitale et al., 2016). In this 
regard, the presence of CPP and dyspareunia could be associated 
with higher levels of social anhedonia leading patients to social 
avoidance, lack of satisfaction derived from social interactions, 
and in the specific case of dyspareunia, compromised sexuality, 
partner intimacy and marital adjustment.

Finally,  a  preserved  hedonic  functioning  is  essential  to 
maintaining  wellbeing  and  directing  behavior  toward  positive 
experiences. Current scientific literature has demonstrated that 
women  with  endometriosis  show  significant  psychological 
distress,  which  is  even  more  pervasive  when  CPP  is  present. 
Research that associates chronic pain with anhedonia has been 
published recently, indicating a significant role of anhedonia in 
chronic pain, although the relationship is still not fully understood. 
Therefore, we think that it is imperative to explore anhedonia in 
endometriosis  in  order  to  guide  us  in  designing  more  precise 
interventions aimed at optimizing health and wellbeing in women 
with endometriosis.

Scheme of the interrelation of the different factors affecting the capacity to experience pleasurable experiences in endometriosis (adapted 
following the model presented in Garland, 2020). Yellow boxes illustrate the motivational processes involved in increasing hedonic and meaningful 
experiences. The increase in reward and positive hedonic experiences might decrease negative affective states that characterize endometriosis 
(pink boxes), diminishing anhedonia and in turn indirectly potentiating analgesia.
