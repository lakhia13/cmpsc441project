Abstract
Although DSM‐5 stipulates that symptoms of attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are

the same for adults as children, clinical observations suggest that adults have more diverse defi-
cits than children in higher‐level executive functioning and emotional control. Previous psycho-

metric analyses to evaluate these observations have been limited in ways addressed in the

current study, which analyzes the structure of an expanded set of adult ADHD symptoms in three

pooled US samples: a national household sample, a sample of health plan members, and a sample

of adults referred for evaluation at an adult ADHD clinic. Exploratory factor analysis found four

factors representing executive dysfunction/inattention (including, but not limited to, all the
DSM‐5 inattentive symptoms, with non‐DSM symptoms having factor loadings comparable to
impulsivity, and emotional dyscontrol. Empirically‐
those of DSM symptoms), hyperactivity,
derived multivariate symptom profiles were broadly consistent with the DSM‐5 inattentive‐only,
hyperactive/impulsive‐only, and combined presentations, but with inattention including
executive dysfunction/inattention and hyperactivity‐only limited to hyperactivity without high
symptoms of impulsivity. These results show that executive dysfunction is as central as DSM‐5

symptoms to adult ADHD, while emotional dyscontrol is more distinct but nonetheless part of

the combined presentation of adult ADHD.

Adult attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a commonly‐
occurring childhood‐onset disorder that often persists into adulthood

(Kessler et al., 2006). Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM‐5) requires fewer symptoms

among adults than children (American Psychiatric Association, 2013),

the symptoms are stipulated to be the same for adults as children

despite the fact that clinical observations suggest that the frank hyper-

activity of childhood ADHD manifests more as a sense of internal rest-

lessness among adults (Adler & Cohen, 2004) and that adults have a
more diverse set of deficits than children in higher‐level executive

This problem could have been avoided by carrying out the
WRAADDS factor analyses on the symptom‐level data rather than
introducing the intermediate step of creating rationally‐constructed

and impulsivity factors in our earlier study, and the fourth factor
representing problems with self‐concept. However, another CAARS
replication study in Germany found a 6‐factor solution after excluding
CAARS items with high cross‐loadings or low loadings on any factor

subscales, but this was not done in the WRAADDS studies because

than the sample size used in the factor analysis of the self‐report ver-

that emotional dyscontrol is a feature of adult ADHD would require
a further person‐level analysis that might involve a factor analysis

tor analysis of the clinician‐administered version of the WRAADDS that

carried out separately among cases (e.g. patients diagnosed with adult
ADHD) and controls (e.g. a community sample), with factor structure‐

combined data across three clinical trial samples (with a combined
sample of 717) would have been large enough to evaluate a 4‐factor
model, although not a 7‐factor model (Marchant et al., 2015).

Other published factor analyses of expanded adult ADHD symp-
tom sets were based on symptom‐level analyses. Our own previous

scores compared across the two samples to demonstrate similar struc-

ture and higher emotional dyscontrol among cases than controls. An
alternative person‐level analysis would be a person‐level cluster analy-
sis or latent class analysis of previously‐derived factor scores to docu-

ment the existence of one or more distinct adult ADHD presentations

attractive one due to the fact that the DSM system specifies that

patients with ADHD can be divided into those with presentations

2.1 | Samples

2.1.1 | NYU Langone sample

The patient sample was a mix of patients seeking treatment at the

adult ADHD program of the New York University (NYU) Langone

Medical Center (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2004b; NYU School of

Medicine, 2015) and a convenience sample recruited through print,

radio, and referral from health care professionals to receive a free eval-
uation for adult ADHD through that program. Blinded semi‐structured
diagnostic interviews described later were administered face‐to‐face

to these patients and controls as part of their intake evaluation. No

incentive for participation was provided to patients and only the free

evaluation to controls. Study purposes and procedures were described

to patients and controls and signed informed consent obtained before

The health plan sample was of participants in a telephone survey of

subscribers to a large managed health care plan (Brod, Johnston, Able,

& Swindle, 2006) that included the ASRS screening scale for adult

ADHD (Kessler, Ames, et al., 2004a). A subsample of these respon-
dents over‐sampling screened positives was re‐interviewed six months
later and a third‐stage sample over‐sampling stably screened positives
was then telephonically administered the same blinded semi‐
structured diagnostic interview as in the NCS‐R using recruitment,

consent, and quality assurance procedures identical to those in the
NCS‐R (i.e. verbal informed consent over the telephone, a $25 incen-

tive, tape recording of interviews with respondent consent for quality

control review). These procedures were approved and a HIPAA waiver

granted by the Institutional Review Board of NYU Langone School of

Medicine. The completed interviews were weighted to adjust for
over‐sampling of screened positives. Study design is described else-

where (Kessler et al., 2007). We focused on the 161 respondents
classified by the diagnostic interview as having at least one DSM‐5

Criterion A1 or A2 symptom of adult ADHD in the six months before

interview.

were approved and a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act) waiver granted for de‐identified data analysis by

the Institutional Review Board of NYU Langone School of Medicine.

These interviews were not weighted. We focused on the 191 individ-
uals classified by the diagnostic interview as having at least one DSM‐5

(American Psychiatric Association, 2013) Criterion A1 (AD) or A2 (HD)

symptom of adult ADHD in the six months before interview.

2.1.2 | NCS‐R

The national general population sample was based on the subsample of
respondents in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS‐R)

Adult ADHD was assessed in these samples with version 1.2 of the

Adult Clinician ADHD Diagnostic Scale (ACDS; Adler & Cohen, 2004;
Adler, Shaw, Kovacs, & Alperin, 2015), a semi‐structured research diag-

nostic interview used in a number of prior clinical studies of adult

ADHD (Spencer et al., 1995; Spencer et al., 1998; Spencer et al.,

2001). The interview began with a retrospective assessment of all

symptoms of childhood ADHD and then assessed an expanded set of
recent (past six months) symptoms including all nine DSM‐5 Criterion

A1 (AD) symptoms, all nine Criterion A2 (HD) symptoms, and 14
non‐DSM symptoms believed relevant to adult ADHD based on clini-
cal experience and the research literature, including deficits in higher‐

tional items are similar to symptoms proposed in the Utah Criteria

for adult ADHD (Wender, 1998).

The ACDS uses childhood and adult specific prompts to ensure

adequate exploration of the severity and breadth of DSM ADHD

symptoms and additional symptoms of executive dysfunction and

emotional dyscontrol. The items related to executive function and

emotional dyscontrol are distinct from the DSM symptoms of inatten-

tion and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Selected examples of executive

function symptoms include: wasting or mismanaging time, trouble

planning ahead or planning for upcoming events, having a hard time

keeping track of several things at once and unable to complete tasks
in the allotted time – needs extra time to finish satisfactorily. Selected

examples of emotional dyscontrol symptoms include: mood changes

frequently, feels easily hassled or feels frequently overwhelmed and
difficulty expressing anger appropriately at others – does not stand
up for self. These non‐DSM symptoms were established and validated

by similar mechanisms as the basic ACDS v1.2 by investigators at

Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU School of Medicine.

DSM‐5/ACDS diagnoses of adult ADHD require respondents to
have 6–9 childhood and 5–9 current adult DSM‐5 Criterion A1 or A2
symptoms (DSM‐5 Criterion A), at least one Criterion A symptom prior
to age 12 (Criterion B), some ADHD‐related impairment in at least two

domains of functioning in the past six months (Criterion C), and clini-
cally significant ADHD‐related impairment in at least one domain of

functioning over the same time period (Criterion D). Criterion E (that

the symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of a perva-

sive developmental disorder or psychotic disorder and are not better

accounted for by another mental disorder) was not operationalized

and ADHD not otherwise specified was not diagnosed. None of the
14 non‐DSM symptom items was used in making diagnoses. The
DSM‐5 requirement of impairment before age 12 was not operational-
ized. Adult ADHD cases were further divided into AD‐only (inattention
symptoms), HD‐only (hyperactive/impulsive symptoms), and combined
(i.e. AD and HD). The AD‐only and HD‐only cases were further divided
into restrictive (0–2 Criterion A symptoms of the other type) and non‐

restrictive (3+ Criterion A symptoms of the other type).

The ACDS interviews were administered in the NYU Langone

sample by two clinical psychology trainees (a PhD candidate with an

MA and an MA candidate with a BA) trained by one of the investiga-

tors (LA). Quarterly calibration meetings were used to review rating
guidelines and prevent drift. A random 20% of NCS‐R and health plan

interviews were reviewed by a supervising psychiatrist and agreement

was over 95% in each of these samples. Validity of the NYU Langone

Analysis of de‐identified data was approved by the Institutional

Review Board of NYU Langone School of Medicine. Participants pro-

vided written informed consent. A tetrachoric correlation matrix was

estimated for the 32 ACDS symptoms within each sample and pooled

across samples. Exploratory factor analysis was used to analyze these

data within and across samples. Our main focus is on pooled analysis

that combines data across all the samples due to the fact that simula-

tions described in the introduction show that the numbers of respon-

dents in the individual samples are too small to recover a stable

factor structure involving the anticipated number of factors with their

anticipated number of items per factor (Pearson & Mundfrom, 2010).

In carrying out that analysis, the parallel analysis simulation method

(Preacher, Zhang, Kim, & Mels, 2013) was used to determine the

number of factors. Oblique (promax) rotation was used to improve

factor interpretation.

Regression‐based factor scores were generated retaining the
correlations among factors. K‐means cluster analysis of standardized

(to a mean of 0 and variance of 1) factor scores was used to estimate

empirical symptom profiles. The optimal number of clusters was

defined as the number that maximized explained variance in factor

scores without producing small splinter clusters. Clusters were

interpreted by inspecting mean factor scores and distributions of
DSM‐5/ACDS adult ADHD presentations classified according to
DSM‐5 criteria. K‐means cluster analysis was used rather than latent

class analysis based on evidence that cluster analysis produces clusters
with lower within‐cluster variation and higher between‐cluster varia-

tion than latent class analysis (Eshghi, Haughton, Legrand, Skaletsky,

& Woolford, 2011). These desirable features are due to cluster analysis

being designed to minimize distance between cluster centroids and

observed cases within clusters (Chaturvedi, Green, & Caroll, 2001),

whereas latent class analysis requires that the variables used to define

the clusters are uncorrelated within clusters (Goodman, Hagenaars, &

McCutcheon, 2002).

The NYU Langone patient sample was the youngest (66.5% of respon-

board certified psychiatrists specializing in adult ADHD research (LA,

general population (i.e. of people with health insurance) without age
restriction. The ratio of respondents in the age range 18–30 versus
31–40 (54.8%) in the health plan sample was similar to the NCS‐R

loadings were higher than those on the second unrotated principal

factor. These results suggest that all ACDS items are part of a single

universe of content representing adult ADHD (Table 3). Importantly
in this regard, the non‐DSM‐5 symptoms had loadings comparable
to the DSM‐5 symptoms (range 0.32–0.84 versus 0.30–0.86; inter‐
quartile range 0.74–0.82 versus 0.56–0.82). The single DSM‐5 symp-
tom with a loading lower than 0.40 (“talks excessively”) was one of
three DSM‐5 symptoms with lower loadings on the first (0.30) than
second (0.54) un‐rotated principal factor, the others being “fidgeting”
(0.41, 0.44) and “difficulty remaining seated” (0.50, 0.54). The two

non‐DSM‐5 items with loadings less than 0.40 on the first unrotated
factor (“difficulty expressing anger”, “sensitive to criticism”) both had
higher loadings on the first (0.33–0.38) than second (−0.03‐0.14) factor.

The existence of one dominant unrotated principal factor does not

mean that the factor structure among items is unidimensional. In fact,

simulation based on the parallel analysis method found four reliable

factors in the pooled correlation matrix. Promax rotation showed that
Factor 1 (20 items with loadings above 0.40) included all nine DSM‐5

AD symptoms (with standardized regression coefficients in the range
0.47–0.97) and 11 of the 14 ACDS symptoms not in DSM‐5, including

aAnalysis was based on a matrix of tetrachoric correlations among dichotomized symptom classifications. Correlations among factors in the promax solution
were Factors 1–2 0.49, Factors 1–3 0.40, Factors 1–4 0.37, Factors 2–3 0.36, Factors 2–4 0.22, and Factors 3–4 0.30. Factor loadings (unrotated first
principal factor) and standardized partial regression coefficients (promax‐rotated 4‐factor solution) greater than 0.40 are bolded. Eigenvalues for the first
four unrotated factors were 15.3, 2.7, 2.0, and 1.5.

all the ACDS symptoms of difficulties with planning and organization
(0.49–0.96) and two (“easily bored” [with prompting for resulting emo-
tionality]; “easily overwhelmed”) indicating mood lability (0.40–0.51).
The two mood lability symptoms, but none of the planning‐organiza-

restrictive (0.0% AD‐only; 2.2% HD‐only) or combined (6.1%) cases.

It is important to note in this regard that the characterization of C6

as not being high on any dimension is a comparative statement, as
60.6% of C6 respondents met DSM‐5 criteria. More detailed analysis

tion symptoms, had meaningful loadings on other factors, leading us

showed, though, that most of these cases had the bare minimum of

to interpret Factor 1 as executive dysfunction/inattention. The nine
DSM‐5 HD symptoms all had loadings greater than 0.40 on either Fac-
tor 2 (hyperactivity; five items; 0.63–0.84) or Factor 3 (impulsivity; four
symptoms; 0.62–0.86). Only one other symptom loaded on Factor 2:
the non‐DSM‐5 symptom “being easily bored”, with a higher loading

on Factor 2 (0.56) than Factor 1 (0.40). No symptoms other than those
of the DSM‐5 impulsivity symptoms had loadings as high as 0.40 on

Factor 3. The three symptoms with loadings of 0.40 or higher on Fac-
tor 4 (0.76–0.81), finally, were all symptoms of emotional dyscontrol:
“frequent mood changes”, “difficulty expressing anger”, and “sensitivity
to criticism”. Correlations among factors were all positive and in the

range between 0.22 (Factors 2 and 4) and 0.49 (Factors 1 and 2).

3.4 | Cluster analysis

Respondents were assigned standardized factor‐weighted scores on
each of the four factors. K‐means cluster analysis was used to examine
the multivariate associations among these four factor scores. A 6‐clus-

ter solution was optimal
in increasing explained variance in factor
scores without producing small splinter clusters, with R2 values in the
range 0.55–0.80 across factors and each cluster containing between

12.5% and 28.4% of respondents (Table 4). Three of the clusters fea-

tured respondents who were high on only one factor: executive dys-

function/inattention (C1; 12.4% of respondents), hyperactivity (C2;

15.9%), or emotional dyscontrol (C3; 28.5%), while the other three

clusters included respondents either high on all factors (C4; 17.6%),

on all but emotional dyscontrol (C5; 12.6%), or high on no factor (C6;

13.0%). The most prevalent cluster was C3 (high only on emotional

dyscontrol).

Cross‐classification of cluster membership with DSM‐5/ACDS

diagnoses showed that virtually all respondents in three of the clusters

(C1, high only on executive dysfunction/inattention; C4 and C5, high
either on all factors or on all but emotional dyscontrol) met DSM‐5
criteria for adult ADHD and that 40.6–51.9% of those in two other

clusters (C2, high only on hyperactivity; C6, high on none) did so.

The remaining cluster (C3, high only on emotional dyscontrol), while

having the highest prevalence in the sample, had by far the lowest pro-
portion of cluster members with DSM‐5 adult ADHD (0.5%). Cluster

C1 cases (high only on executive dysfunction/inattention) were made
up exclusively of DSM‐5 AD‐only cases. Cluster C4 (high on all factors)

and C5 (high on all other than emotional dyscontrol) cases,

in

comparison, almost entirely had the combined presentation. Some-

what more than half the respondents in two clusters C2 and C6 also

met diagnostic criteria.

The 51.0% of respondents in C2 (high only on hyperactivity) who
met diagnostic criteria consisted mostly of AD‐only cases, with smaller
numbers of HD‐only cases, and very few cases with the combined pre-

sentation (0.7%). The 60.6% of respondents meeting diagnostic criteria
in C6 (low on all factors), in comparison, were primarily non‐restrictive
AD‐only (24.4%) or non‐restrictive HD‐only (27.8%), with far fewer

the five AD or HD symptoms required to meet diagnostic criteria.

3.5 | Comparison of cluster‐based profiles across
samples

Cross‐classification of DSM‐5/ACDS diagnostic presentations with

clusters documented substantial differences across the three compo-

nent samples (Table 5). The most striking difference, and the only one

that was statistically significant, was that the majority of NYU Langone
cases had a DSM‐5 combined presentation (63.3%), while that presen-
tation was considerably less common in the NCS‐R (29.0%; t = 2.9, p =

0.002) and health plan (16.3%; t = 4.8, p < 0.001) samples. The vast

majority of combined presentation cases in all samples were either in

C4 (high on all factors) or C5 (high on all but emotional dyscontrol).
Nearly all (95.4%) of the remaining NYU Langone cases had the DSM‐
5 AD‐only profile. The proportion of AD‐only cases did not differ signif-
icantly across samples (t = 0.1–1.7, p = 0.10–0.88). Cluster C1 (high only

on executive dysfunction/inattention) was the most common cluster
among DSM‐5 AD‐only cases in all three samples (43.0–60.3%).

The DSM‐5 HD‐only profile was the most common one in the NCS‐
R (47.7%). A somewhat lower proportion of cases had the HD‐only pro-

file in the health plan sample (32.6%) while this profile was very rare in
the NYU Langone sample (1.7%), suggesting a help‐seeking bias. Yet

none of the higher proportions in the two general population samples

was statistically different from the extremely low proportions in the
NYU Langone patient sample (NCS‐R: t = 1.5–1.7, p = 0.08–0.14; health
plan: t = 1.2–1.5, p = 0.13–0.23) due to the comparative rarity of the
HD‐only profile. Cluster C6 (high on none of the factors) was by far
the most common cluster among HD‐only cases in the NCS‐R (82.0%).

In the health plan sample, in comparison, C2 (high only on hyperactivity,
54.3%) was the most common symptom profile among HD‐only cases
followed by C6 (34.3%). The DSM‐5 AD‐only profile was the most

common one in the health plan sample (51.1%), with insignificantly
lower proportions of cases having this profile in the NCS‐R (23.3%)
and NYU Langone (35.2%) samples (t = 0.3–1.7; p = 0.09–0.79). Cluster

C1 (high only on executive dysfunction/inattention) was the most com-
mon cluster among AD‐only cases in all three samples (43.0–66.3%).

Our factor analysis showed clearly that adult ADHD is characterized by
a broader set of symptoms than in DSM‐5. This conclusion is based on
the observations that all but a handful of non‐DSM‐5 symptoms had

factor loadings of 0.40 or higher on the first unrotated principal factor,
that these loadings were similar to those of DSM‐5 symptoms, and

that these loadings were consistently much higher on the first than

second unrotated principal factor. We are aware of no previous factor

analysis of expanded adult ADHD symptoms that made these compar-

isons. These results suggest that symptoms of executive dysfunction

bThe numbers of respondents with ADHD in the NCS‐R and health plan samples are considerably more than the numbers expected by multiplying the
prevalence estimates in Table 2 by the total sample sizes, as respondents who screened positive for ADHD in the first phases of those samples were

these four factors have an intuitive interpretation, they are inconsistent

As noted in the introduction, the finding of a 2‐factor structure in stud-

should not be considered in this comparison, as this was a methodolog-

(C5), and the last (C6) by below‐average scores on all factors.

It is noteworthy that the 20.9% of respondents meeting DSM‐5/
ACDS criteria for adult ADHD who had an AD‐only symptom profile
is not dramatically higher than the 13.9% of DSM‐5/ACDS cases who
had an HD‐only profile. This finding is inconsistent with the widely‐
accepted view that the AD‐only presentation is much more common
than the HD‐only presentation in adult ADHD. An important reason

for this discrepancy can be seen in Table 2, where we showed that
the DSM‐5 AD‐only presentation was as common as the HD‐only pre-
sentation in the community samples (i.e. the NCS‐R and health plan
samples), but much less common than the AD‐only presentation in the

treatment sample (i.e. the NYU Langone sample), suggesting that there
is a treatment selection bias in favor of AD‐only cases. This observation
is worthy of future examination of the prevalence of narrowly‐defined
HD‐only in unrestricted population samples of adults. Narrowly‐defined
HD‐only has low prevalence among youth, but it might be that the results

of our cluster analysis are due to a much higher proportion of these
youth retaining their symptoms in adulthood than youth with an AD‐only

cluster analysis was based on standardized factor scores in which stan-

dardization was normed to the distribution of symptoms among people

with adult ADHD symptoms. This means that our characterization of
symptoms as high versus low was not based on DSM‐5 thresholds

but rather on the distributions in the sample. In addition, we gave equal

weight to the symptoms in each of the four observed factors. The
DSM‐5 distinctions, in comparison, reflect threshold decisions using

reduced sets of symptoms in which symptoms of hyperactivity and
impulsivity are down‐weighted (in the sense that they are combined

into one dimension rather than two) relative to symptoms of inatten-
tiveness. It is unclear whether the cluster‐based profiling approach
would have any advantages over the DSM‐5 approach in predicting

differential treatment response or in improving understanding of the

underlying pathophysiology of adult ADHD, but this question could

be the subject of future study, possibly in the context of more elabo-

rate and objective characterizations of executive dysfunction (Barkley,

2012; Brown, Reichel, & Quinlan, 2009; Dehili, Prevatt, & Coffman,

2013) and emotional dyscontrol (Surman et al., 2013; Surman et al.,

2015; Vidal et al., 2014).

Although our analysis had a number of strengths, including a large

the combined presentations featuring high factor scores met DSM‐5/

ing that high HD is less specific to adult ADHD. And virtually none of
the respondents in the emotional dyscontrol‐only cluster met DSM‐5/

ACDS criteria for adult ADHD, suggesting that high emotional

dyscontrol in the absence of high AD and high HD is strongly sugges-

tive of the absence of adult ADHD.

differentiated than the assessments in other recent studies. It would

be valuable to determine the sensitivity of our results to an expanded

assessment of emotional dyscontrol. Second, our assessment did not
include any of the performance‐based measures of neurocognitive

functioning used in a number of other recent studies of adult ADHD
(e.g. Dehili et al., 2013; Micoulaud‐Franchi et al., 2016; Surman et al.,
2015). It is important to note in this regard that the concept of “exec-
