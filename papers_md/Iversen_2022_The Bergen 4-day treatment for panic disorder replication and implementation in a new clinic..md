Abstract 
Background:  Bergen 4-day treatment (B4DT) is a concentrated exposure-based treatment (cET), where the patient 
receives concentrated, individually tailored cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) during four consecutive days. Previous 
findings have indicated that B4DT could be a promising treatment for panic disorder (PD).

Aim:  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the implementation of B4DT for panic disorder with- and without 
agoraphobia, at a new clinic. This is the first replication study for B4DT on panic disorder.

Method:  Thirty consecutively recruited patients with PD were included in an open trial design. Assessment of 
symptoms of panic disorder were measured with Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), while symptoms of general-
ized anxiety were assessed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and depressive symptoms by Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Treatment satisfaction was measured 
with Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) post-treatment.

 4.32), and at 3-month follow-up (d 

Results:  The results showed a significant reduction in symptom severity from pre-treatment to post-treatment 
 4.91). The proportion of patients classified as fulfilling the criteria for remis-
(d 
sion was 80.0% at post-treatment and 86.7% at follow up. There was a significant reduction in symptoms of depres-
sion and generalized anxiety. Treatment satisfaction was high and none of the patients dropped out.

Conclusion:  The current study replicated the results from the original study and indicate that the treatment can be 
successfully implemented at new clinics. B4DT may be a promising treatment for panic disorder and comorbid symp-
toms of generalized anxiety and depression. Larger and more controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy 
of B4DT for panic disorder.

Background
Panic disorder (PD) is characterized by the presence or a 
fear of panic attacks, with rapid onset and intense anxi-
ety. It includes symptoms like shaking, sweating and rac-
ing  heart  [1].  PD  has  a  lifetime  prevalence  ranging  up

to  4%  [2]  and  a  median  age  of  onset  was  32  [3].  Studies 
have shown that PD is associated with comorbid anxiety 
disorders,  mood  disorders,  and  psychotic  disorders  [4, 
5].  Patients  with  PD  report  reduced  quality  of  life,  poor 
sense  of  health,  more  frequent  use  of  medical  services 
and more marital issues [6].

Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  is  regarded  as 
a  first-line  treatment  for  panic  disorder  with  or  with-
out  agoraphobia  [7,  8].  CBT  based  treatment  for  panic

disorder have been found to be effective in a diversity of 
treatment formats. Brief, intensive or concentrated (BIC) 
treatment is characterized by prolonged therapy sessions 
over  a  very  short  period  of  time,  but  the  total  number 
of  sessions  is  often  relatively  similar  to  standard  CBT 
[9–11].  Concentrated CBT  may have the  advantage that 
it can make a positive change in a shorter timeframe [9, 
12].  A  recent  meta-analysis  of  brief,  intensive  and  con-
centrated (BIC) treatment for anxiety disorders in adoles-
cents indicated that BIC had higher rate of response and 
remission, compared with standard CBT for a [13].

The Bergen  4-day treatment  (B4DT) is  a  concentrated 
exposure  treatment  (cET),  where  the  patient  receives 
individually tailored CBT delivered during four consecu-
tive days. B4DT can be categorized as an individual treat-
ment delivered in a group setting, since the treatment is 
delivered in groups with 3 to 6 patients with a therapist-
patient ratio of 1:1. The B4DT has proven highly accept-
able for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder, with very 
low drop-out rates and the results show that almost 70% 
were classified as recovered at 12-month follow up [14]. 
A follow-up study demonstrated that the treatment out-
come was stable 4 years after completing treatment [15].

There  has  only  been  published  one  study  of  B4DT  for 
PD.  The  pilot  study  (N = 29)  found  promising  results. 
The  proportion  of  treatment  responders  was  72.4%  at 
both  post-treatment  and  at  3-month  follow-up  [16]. 
They also found very high treatment satisfaction, with a 
mean  Client  Satisfaction  Questionaire-8  (CSQ-8  [17];) 
score of 30.2, where the maximum score is 32. Although 
the results are promising, there has not yet been demon-
strated  whether  the  results  can  be  replicated  or  imple-
mented at a new site with other clinicians.

The aim of this study was to examine if the promising 
effects from the pilot study on the B4DT for PD with or 
without  agoraphobia  is  transferable  to  a  new  clinic.  We 
hypothesized  that  there  would  be  no  significant  differ-
ences between the current study and the previously pub-
lished  pilot  study  on  B4DT  for  PD,  based  on  previous 
studies on implementation of B4DT on OCD in new clin-
ics [18, 19].

Method
Participants and procedure

The study was conducted at an outpatient clinic in Molde, 
which  is  a  part  of  the  specialist  health  care  in  Helse 
Møre og Romsdal Hospital Trust in Middle Norway. The 
patients in the study were consecutively referred to their 
local  outpatient  specialist  health  care  unit  by  their  gen-
eral practitioner, and if the condition were considered to 
grant  them  treatment  in  the  specialized  health  care,  the 
patients  were  referred  to  the  anxiety  clinic.  All  patients 
were assessed by an experienced therapist using the Mini 

International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI  [20];). 
MINI is a short structured diagnostic interview used for 
screening axis-I DMS-IV disorders. Patients who fulfilled 
criteria  for  PD  or  agoraphobia  were  considered  for  par-
ticipation.  Patients  were  excluded  if  they  did  not  speak 
Norwegian, were suicidal, or suffered from ongoing sub-
stance abuse, psychosis, or bipolar disorder (See Fig. 1 for 
Flow Chart). Most of the patients had symptoms of both 
panic disorder and agoraphobia (76.7%, n = 23). See Fig. 1 
for patient flow in the study.

In total, 20 of the patients (66.7%) had a comorbid psy-
chiatric  disorder..  The  comorbid  disorders  were  as  fol-
lowing:  56.7%  (n = 17)  had  comorbid  depression,  16.7% 
(n = 5) had GAD, 6.7% (n = 2) had PTSD, 3.3% (n = 1) had 
SAD, 3.3% (n = 1) had OCD, and 3.3% (n = 1) had health 
anxiety.  Patients  using  pharmacotherapy  were  on  medi-
cation before they were referred to the anxiety clinic and 
they  had  to  be  on  a  stable  dose  4  weeks  before  starting 
the B4DT. Use of medication was registered at the initial 
interview.  Of  the  patients,  18  (60.0%)  were  using  psy-
chotropic  medication.  Eleven  (36.7%)  used  SSRI,  eight 
(26.7%) used benzodiazepines, and one (3.3%) used med-
ication for ADHD. Patients on SSRI (36.6%, n = 11) were 
informed to maintain the same medication doses prior to 
and during the treatment period. The patients who used 
benzodiazepines  (26.7%,  n = 8)  were  encouraged  to  not 
use  these  medications  during  the  exposures  or  directly 
afterwards.  All  patients  adhered  to  this  instruction,  but 
some used it in the evening to help them sleep. No with-
drawal effects were reported by the patients.

There  was  a  majority  of  female  patients  (70.0%, 
n = 21),  and  the  mean  age  of  the  patients  was  38.0 years 
(SD = 13.10,  range = 21–64).  The  mean  duration  of  PD 
was  13.43  (SD = 14.60)  years,  with  a  range  from  1  to 
48 years.  None  of  the  patients  were  in  an  acute  phase, 
as  all  patients  had  suffered  from  panic  attack  for  more 
than  3  months  before  starting  treatment.  The  mean  age 
of  onset  for  panic  disorder  was  13.43 years  (SD = 14.60, 
range = 3 months – 47 years). Six of the patients had suf-
fered from PD for less than a year. See Table 1 for a sum-
mary of sample characteristics.

The patients who met inclusion criteria were assigned 
to  a  treatment  group,  and  requested  to  participate  in  a 
voluntarily,  written  consent-based  quality  register.  All 
patients  in  the  study  agreed  to  take  part  of  the  quality 
register and none of the patients’ withdrew their consent. 
One patient did not agree to take part of the quality reg-
ister, but were offered and completed treatment.

Measures

Assessments  were  carried  out  pre-  and  post-treatment 
and  at  3-month  follow-up.  Patients  completed  online 
generalized 
self-report  questionnaires 

concerning

anxiety,  depression,  and  client  satisfaction.  If  patients 
did  not  complete  self-report  questionnaires  according 
to a pre-set time limit, they received a reminder in form 
of  an  automatic  text  message.  An  independent  assessor, 
who were not involved in the treatment conducted PDSS 
interview at post-treatment and follow-up, while the pre-
treatment interview was conducted by the therapist that 
did the assessment before treatment.

Panic disorder severity scale

(PDSS [21];) is an interview for assessing panic disorder 
severity,  and  is  used  as  the  primary  outcome  measure. 
The seven items are rated on a scale from 0 to 4. The max-
imum score of PDSS is 28. High scores indicate increased 
severity. For patients without agoraphobia, scores from 0 
to 1 correspond to “Normal”, scores from 2 to 5 to “Bor-
derline”,  6  to  9  to  “Slightly  ill”,  10–13  to  “moderately  ill”,

and 16 and above is considered as “Markedly ill”. Accord-
ing to symptom reduction, a reduction in PDSS between 
100  to  75%  was  considered  as  “Very  much  improved”,  a 
reduction  between  74  to  40%  as  “Much  improved”,  and 
a  reduction  between  39  to  10%  was  considered  “Mini-
mally  improved”  [22].  The  Furukawa  et  al.  [22]  criteria 
defined response when the PDSS is reduced with at least 
40%  from  pre-treatment  to  post-treatment.  Remissions 
is  accomplished  when  the  post-treatment  is  also  under 
the category “borderline ill”, which is 5 for PD and 7 for 
PD with agoraphobia. PDSS has previously showed good 
psychometrical properties [21].

Generalized anxiety disorder

(GAD-7  [23];)  is  a  questionnaire  for  measuring  symp-
toms  of  generalized  anxiety  disorder.  The  questionnaire 
contains seven items, and the total scores range from 0 to 
21. Scores from 0 to 4 correspond to “Minimal anxiety”, 5 
to 9 correspond to “Mild anxiety”, 10 to 14 correspond to 
moderate  anxiety,  while  15  to  21  correspond  to  “Severe 
anxiety” [23].

Patient health questionnaire 9

(PHQ-9  [24];)  is  a  questionnaire  for  measuring  depres-
sive  symptoms.  It  contains  nine  items,  and  each  item 
is  reported  on  a  four-point  Likert  scale  (0 = not  at  all, 
3 = almost  every  day).  The  total  scores  range  from  0  to 
27, where 0 to 4 correspond to “None”, 5 to 9 correspond 
to  “Mild”,  10  to  14  correspond  to  “Moderate”,  15  to  19 
correspond to “Moderate-Severe, and 20 and above cor-
respond to “Severe” [25].

The client satisfaction questionnaire

(CSQ-8)  [17]  is  an  eight-item  questionnaire  used  to 
measure  the  patients’  degree  of  satisfaction  with  the 
treatment.  The  total  score  ranges  from  8  to  32,  and 

higher scores indicates higher level of treatment satisfac-
tion [17].

Therapists
The  therapists  (n = 8)  were  either  clinical  psychologist 
or psychiatrists. The two group leaders had eight and 10 
years of experience. The therapists had attended at least 
three  B4DT-groups,  whereas  at  least  one  was  on  panic 
disorder.

The therapists worked as a team and had daily therapist 
meetings. The function of the meetings was to make sure 
that  the  therapists  knew  about  the  progress  and  chal-
lenges  for  each  patient.  The  group  leader  would  decide 
which therapist and patient that would work together in 
the next session and would supervise and assist if needed.

Treatment

The B4DT for panic disorder [16] is inspired by the B4DT 
model  for  OCD  [14,  26,  27],  the  cognitive  model  of  PD 
[28]  and  the  inhibitory  learning  approach  to  exposure 
therapy [29]. The B4DT treatment for panic disorder was 
delivered  during  four  consecutive  days  and  included  a 
booster  session  3  months  after  treatment  (45 minutes). 
The  treatment  was  delivered  as  individual  treatment  in 
a  group  setting,  as  the  groups  consisted  of  three  to  six 
patients, where the therapist-patient ratio was 1:1.

The  main  focus  of  the  B4DT  is  the”  LEaning  in  Tech-
nique”  (LET),  which  is  an  approach  for  exposure  that 
emphasizes that the patient attempt to actively shift from 
avoiding  unpleasant  bodily  symptoms,  thoughts  and 
emotions,  to  instead  actively  approach  whatever  elicits 
relevant  anxiety/discomfort  and  “lean”  into  the  bodily 
symptoms, thoughts and emotions that are awoken in the 
exposure.

The content of the first day (3 hours) of treatment was 
psychoeducation about PD and the treatment. The infor-
mation was delivered in a group setting, and the patients 
were  introduced  to  each  other  and  the  therapists.  The 
patients  also  prepared  their  individual  exposure  tasks, 
and  the  tasks  were  evaluated  in  the  group  setting.  The 
first day of treatment was dedicated to psychoeducation 
about  PD  and  the  treatment.  The  second  and  third  day 
(7 hours  each)  were  dedicated  to  exposure  and  behavio-
ral experiments based on a CBT rationale. The treatment 
involved  both  interceptive  exposure  that  targets  to  the 
bodily sensations that each patient report that they fear, 
and in vivo exposure to the external situations where they 
experience  fear  or  that  they  tend  to  avoid.  The  longer 
therapy sessions allowed sufficient time for the therapist 
to do exposure tasks together with the patients in a wide 
range  of  themes  and  settings  that  the  patient  reported 
as  most  challenging  and/or  important.  The  group  met 
three  times  on  day  two  and  three  to  report  back  to  the 

Iversen et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:728

group and to share experiences. On the second and third 
day,  exposure  plans  for  the  evening  were  made  and  the 
patients reported to their therapist with a SMS at the end 
of the evening. The patients were also told that they could 
call  their  therapist,  if  there  was  anything  they  struggled 
with. On the afternoon the third day, friends and family 
were invited to a psychoeducation meeting to learn more 
about the disorder and the treatment (1 hour).

The focus on the fourth day (3 hour) The focus on the 
last  day  was  to  teach  the  patients  how  to  maintain  and 
continue  treatment  effects..  The  patient  and  therapist 
made  a  plan  for  continued  exposure  for  the  3  weeks 
after  treatment.  The  patients  were  encouraged  to  regis-
ter the progress online each day of the first 3 weeks. They 
received  no  feedback  from  therapist  during  this  period. 
Three  months  after  the  treatment,  patients  were  offered 
an  individual  session  for  treatment  consolidation.  This 
session did not include exposure.

Statistical analyses

The  expectation-maximization  method  of  SPSS,  ver-
sion  24,  was  used  to  implement  missing  values  on  the 
self-report  scales  (PHQ-9,  GAD-7).  The  total  amount 
of  missing  data  was  5.0%.  Little’s  MCAR  test  indicated 
that the self-report data were missing completely at ran-
dom,  χ2(12) = 14.263,  p = 0.284.  This  allowed  the  use 
of  repeated  measures  ANOVA  to  investigate  change  in 
symptoms  from  pre-  to  post  and  follow-up.  Repeated 
measures  ANOVA  for  PDSS,  GAD-7,  and  PHQ-9  were 
conducted  using  Greenhouse–Geisser  corrections  when 
Mauchly’s  test  of  sphericity  was  significant.  For  post-
hoc  analysis,  Bonferroni  corrections  were  used.  Cohen’s 
d, defined as (M pre-treatment – M post-treatment)/SD 
pre-treatment, was used to calculate effect sizes [30]. The 
results  were  compared  with  the  results  from  the  pilot 
B4DT for PD in Bergen [16] with a t-test for independent 
samples.

Results
Primary outcome measure

There were no dropouts from the treatment. All patients 
reported symptoms using the PDSS at pre-treatment and 
at  post-treatment,  while  only  one  patient  (3.3%)  missed 
the PDSS interview at follow-up.

There  was  a  significant  reduction  in  symptoms  of 
panic disorder over time,  F(1.591, 44.546) = 281.815, p < .001, 
partial  eta  squared = .910.  The  improvement  from  pre-
treatment  to  post-treatment  was  significant  (p < 0.001, 
d = 4.32),  as  was  the  improvement  from  pre-treatment 
to follow-up (p = 0.01. d = 4.91). There was also signifi-
cant  improvement  from  post-treatment  to  follow-up 
(p = 0.03, d = 0.43). See Table 2 for details on changes in 
symptoms following treatment. There were no significant

differences  with  respect  to  treatment  outcome  between 
those who had suffered from PD for less than a year and 
those with longer illness duration,  F(1,63) = 1.344, p = .856.
Three  repeated  measures  ANOVAs  tested  whether 
using  pharmacotherapy  was  associated  with  treatment 
outcome.  The  first  analysis  compared  treatment  effects 
for patients using benzodiazepines and/or SSRIs (n = 15) 
with  the  remaining  sample.  There  was  no  significant 
interaction  effect,   F(1,57) = 0.938,  p = .379.  The  second 
analysis  investigated  treatment  effects  for  patients  using 
SSRIs  (n = 11),  and  found  no  significant  interaction 
effect,   F(1,57) = 1.273,  p = .284.  The  third  analysis,  inves-
tigated  treatment  effects  for  patients  using  benzodiaz-
epines (n = 8), and found no significant interaction effect, 
 F(1,63) = 0.097, p = .870.

The  response  and  remission  rates  based  on  Furukawa 
[22]  criteria  for  PDSS  were  high.  At  post-treatment, 
56.7% (n = 17) had “Very much improvement” (75–100% 
reduction),  40.0%  (n = 12)  had  “Much  improvement” 
(40–74%),  while  3.3%  (n = 1)  had  “Minimally  improve-
ment” (10–39%). At follow up, 83.3% (n = 25) had “Very 
much  improvement”,  10%  (n = 3)  had  “Much  improve-
ment”,  3.3%  (n = 1)  had  “Minimally  improvement”  (10–
39%), while 3.3% (n = 1) had missing data (see Table 3).

Secondary outcome measures

There  was  also  a  significant  reduction  in  depressive 
symptoms  over  time,  =   F(1.059,  30.699) = 42.632,  p < .001, 
partial eta squared = .595. There was a significant reduc-
tion  from  pre-treatment  to  post-treatment  (p < .001,

d = 1.26), and from pre-treatment to follow-up (p < .001, 
d = 1.19),  but  not  from  post-treatment  to  follow-up 
(p = .435, d = 0.18). There was also a significant reduction 
in symptoms of generalized anxiety,  F(1.568,45.485) = 50.454, 
p < .001, partial eta squared = .635, d = 1.70. There was a 
significant  reduction  from  pre-treatment  to  post-treat-
ment  (p < 0.01,  d = 1.65),  and  from  pre-treatment  to  fol-
low-up  (p < .001,  d = 1.70),  but  not  from  post-treatment 
to follow-up (p = .435, d = 0.12). Patients scored high on 
treatment  satisfaction,  as  indicated  by  a  score  of  30.71 
(SD = 1.61) on the CSQ-8.

Comparisons with the pilot study on B4DT for panic 
disorder

The  current  study  had  a  significant  higher  pre-score  on 
PDSS (p < .001, d = 1.09) compared to the pilot study on 
B4DT  for  PD  at  the  original  site,  but  there  were  no  dif-
ferences on post-treatment (p = .352, d = 0.24). However, 
the  PDSS  score  at  3-month  follow-up  was  significant 
lower  (p = .23,  d = 0.58).  The  current  study  had  signifi-
cant  higher  scores  on  pre  PHQ-9  (p = .030,  d = 0.58), 
but not at post-treatment (p = .941, d = 0.02). There was 
no  significant  difference  is  CSQ-8  score  post-treatment 
(p = .341, d = 0.25). For details, see Table 4.

Comparisons with standard CBT for panic disorder

standard  CBT  for  panic  disorder  with  and  without  ago-
raphobia,  we  compared  it  to  standard  CBT  studies  that 
have used PDSS as outcome measure. This included nine 
studies with a total of 517 patients. For further details on 
the procedure, see [16].

The  current  study  had  a  significant  higher  pre-score 
on PDSS (p < .001, d = 1.57) comparing the current study

with standard CBT. Further, the current study had signifi-
cantly lower scores on post-treatment (p < .001, d = 0.69) 
and at 3-month follow-up (p = .003, d = 0.60).

Discussion
This is the first replication of the promising results from 
the pilot study. The results indicate that the B4DT can be 
replicated at other clinics using other therapists and still 
obtained the same promising results. This is in line with 
previous studies with implementing the B4DT-treatment 
for OCD to new sites [19, 31] and countries [32]. In the 
current  study,  we  found  that  there  were  significantly 
higher  PDSS  scores  before  treatment,  and  significant 
lower scores at follow-up in the current study compared 
to  the  previous  study  on  B4DT  for  PD.  There  were  no 
significant  differences  between  the  studies  at  post-treat-
ment.  Comparing  the  current  study  with  standard  CBT, 
we  found  significantly  higher  scores  on  PDSS  pre-treat-
ment,  but  significantly  lower  scores  at  both  post-treat-
ment and follow-up.

There  was  a  significant  reduction  in  symptoms  of  PD 
from  pre-treatment  to  post-treatment  and  from  post-
treatment  to  follow-up.  This  is  in  line  with  the  findings 
from  the  original  study  [16].  This  may  imply  that  the 
patients  continue  to  use  the  skills  that  they  practiced  in 
treatment.  The  secondary  measures  also  showed  a  sig-
nificant  reduction  in  symptoms  of  anxiety  (GAD-7)  and 
depression (PHQ-9) from pre-treatment to post- and fol-
low-up. This is in line with previous findings on B4DT for 
PD [16] and for B4DT treatment for OCD [14, 15, 18, 19, 
27].  It  should  also  be  noted  that  all  patients  completed 
the  treatment.  This  is  in  line  with  the  findings  from 
Hansen et al. [16]. The low dropout rate may be a result 
of  the  treatment’s  concentrated  format.  This  is  interest-
ing given previous findings that drop-out is found to be a 
challenge in exposure based treatment for PD [33].

The scores on CSQ-8 showed high levels of satisfaction 
with  the  treatment.  The  patients  reported  their  experi-
ence of the length and the format of the treatment as pos-
itive;  they  reported  feeling  understood  by  the  therapist 
and  that  the  treatment  was  relevant  for  their  problems. 
The patients would recommend the treatment to a friend 
with PD, and they would return to the clinic if needed.

There  are  several  factors  thought  to  be  important  for 

the promising results observed.

The  concentrated  format  does  not  mean  reducing  the 
amount of therapy given. The format also gives an advan-
tage to therapists as they have a lot of time together with 
the patient and have the possibility to do exposure exer-
cises  in  several  different  settings  that  are  most  relevant 
for the patient. The concentrated format could also make 
it easier for the patient to focus and prioritize the treat-
ment.  In  addition,  the  treatment  is  conducted  within  a

group setting, so the patients have the possibility to share 
their experiences and learn from each other.

The  study  had  some  obvious  limitations.  The  study 
was  an  open  trial  with  no  control  condition.  Since  the 
treatment  was  delivered  as  a  part  of  the  public  health 
service,  the  treatment  was  not  videotaped,  so  the  com-
petence  and  adherence  to  the  protocol  was  not  evalu-
ated. There was no evaluation of the amount of exposure 
tasks completed by patients during the follow-up period. 
Although the results suggested that use of SSRIs and/or 
benzodiazepines was not associated with treatment out-
come, it remains unclear whether there could have been 
any  potential  late-onset  gains  of  pharmacotherapy  for 
some patients. The potential efficacy of the B4TD for PD 
should also be tested also in samples with acutely-ill and 
medication-free patients. Further, the effect sizes should 
be  interpreted  with  caution  because  of  the  open  label 
design (not including a control group), the lack of rand-
omization  of  patient  or  therapists,  and  consequently  no 
double-blinded  assessments.  This  limits  the  generaliza-
tion of the results. The comparisons with standard CBT 
are  not  straightforward  because  effect  sizes  could  differ 
due to different study designs. The results are promising, 
but larger and controlled studies are needed to conclude 
about the treatment’s efficacy. Although the current study 
was  conducted  at  a  new  clinic,  the  study  should  also  be 
replicated in other sites and cultures.

Conclusion
The study is the first replication of B4DT for panic disor-
der. The results indicates that the concentrated treatment 
format panic disorder is transferable and can be effective 
in treating panic disorder also at other sites using differ-
ent  therapists.  The  results  indicated  that  the  treatment 
is  also  associated  with  symptom  reduction  regarding 
comorbid symptoms of depression and generalized anxi-
ety. This also strengthen previous findings that BIC treat-
ment  may  be  a  valuable  supplement  to  more  standard 
formats  of  CBT.  Larger  and  more  controlled  studies  are 
needed.
