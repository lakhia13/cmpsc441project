Introduction

Homo Developmentalis proposes an evolutionary perspective on child development
and psychopathology. It reﬂects the dynamics of recent changes in Homo Sapiens: from
hunter-gatherer to megalopolis city dweller; from attachment to the tribe to equality
among all; from the discovery of writing to that of artiﬁcial intelligence. All of these
changes show the importance of early environmental interactions and contexts for
the baby’s development. They have favored during evolution bidirectional interactions
between the brain and environment creating a complex interplay. By coupling this
evolutionary perspective to a categorization of the environmental factors into micro
(e.g., alcohol during pregnancy, child abuse) and macro (e.g., cultural background,
group aﬃliation), we discuss in this essay its relevance for child and adolescent
mental health. To do so, we focus on two psychopathologies – externalizing disorders
and borderline personality disorders – exploring causality from an evolutionary
developmental perspective and suggesting that life history strategies may correspond to
intermediate normal phenotypes.

Characteristics of Homo Sapiens in the mammal
order

Homo Developmentalis proposed as a term and concept that reﬂects the dynamics
of recent changes that Homo Sapiens has encountered [1]. These recent changes cannot
be explained by evolutionary changes relying on classic natural selection theory (e.g.,
pressure on our genes). We have ∼22,000 genes, which is an insuﬃcient number to
organize a social thought as accomplished as that of humans [2]. Genetics is not the only
mode of transmission in humans since many non-genetic factors also associated with
issues of inheritance or heredity have been described [3]. Novel perspectives regarding
evolution consider that interactions with the environment are also crucial [4].

Let us recall some of the characteristics of the human species whose emergence
has been favored by evolution. Physically, human morphology when compared
(monkey) presents many distinctions:
to that of
facial and
standing position, hand and foot morphology, and disappearance of

the non-human primates

body hair, which probably favors taking in information in
terms of
facial expression, and noticeably increased brain
size [5]. The counterpart of this standing position and the
growth of the brain forced the delivery of babies to advance
because of the physical limits of the pelvic bone constitution
(estimations suggests that deliveries should take place at
approximately 21 months and not at 9 months). The brain is
particularly immature at birth, continues to have fetal brain
characteristics and develop after birth. The human baby is
therefore in a position of great dependence; it develops slowly,
cannot move on its own, nor can it cling to its mother
like its primate cousins. For some authors, this necessary
motor separation between the baby and its mother in the ﬁrst
humans may have favored the appearance of an audio channel
to communicate the baby’s distress (e.g., crying), parental
comfort (e.g., motherese), and therefore favor the appearance of
language [6].

At the same time, communities authorized a sharing of
food and techniques to obtain nutrients that probably promoted
both learning and mobility. Moreover, unlike non-human
primates, gestational gaps in humans shorten as the lifespan
increases. Thus, despite the increase of infant’s dependence
(compared to non-human primates), this change favors the
large families, and mutual aid among
presence of fathers,
family members; ultimately, this gestational gap may promote
learning by proximity and imitation, transferring behaviors and
cultural heritage. Indeed, inheritance and transmission cannot
be reduced to genes. There are at least three other modes of
transmission: epigenetic transmission, behavioral transmission,
and symbolic/cultural transmission [3]. The latter has extremely
powerful eﬀects,
such as cultural biases and stereotypes
associated with social aﬃliation groups [7]. The aﬃliation group
deﬁnes a territory as a security zone. During evolutionary
time, the aﬃliation group was the small group in which each
individual evolved. Despite very early abilities showing infant’s
altruism, rejection of the other (or racism) has long been an
evolutionary advantage because it has fostered cohesion within
an aﬃliated group such as the tribe for early Homo. During our
cultural evolution and in parallel with changes in our lifestyles
(overcrowding in megacities), we have developed values of
humanism and tolerance that have enabled changes. However,
the stereotypes remain powerful. Thus, amorous behaviors
are mainly experienced in aﬃliation groups. In other words,
humans are naturally racist. Adopting opposing cultural values
during development runs counter to the natural order [8].
These changes during evolution have also profoundly modiﬁed
development (schooling and the acquisition of reading) and
(learning civic principles and human
social
rights). Thus, based on all aforementioned changes, we have
proposed to call contemporary man Homo Developmentalis.
This evolution also continues in our contemporary world
with the observation of a humanistic metamorphosis of
European civilization.

interactions

The child’s environment: An
ecosystem in interaction

From the above, we understand that the child develops in an
environment of extreme variety. From a systemic perspective,
environmental factors are considered in a gradient of distance
from the child [9]. At the most proximal, we isolate the
contribution of toxic environmental factors that will have a
direct eﬀect on brain development during pregnancy or the
ﬁrst years of life (e.g., alcohol, air pollution). The second
type of environmental factor is the microenvironment, which
includes individual and family factors (e.g., abuse). The third
type of environmental factor is the macroenvironment. In the
latter, a further distinction is made between the exosystem or
extended environment (e.g., school, peers, extended family) and
the macrosystem or social frame of reference (e.g., culture,
law, religion) [10]. At the very beginning of life, a baby is
immediately part of this ecosystem with few emerging functions
with which to interact (e.g., imitation, gazing, “speech turn”).
The quality of early interactions is decisive [11–13]. The baby’s
brain is a sponge toward environmental stimulation and cues.
Indeed, the environment can act on the brain and inﬂuence
its future development through many mechanisms: statistical
learning [14], stress regulation [15], epigenetic mechanisms
and transgenerational transmission of behavioral patterns [16],
gene/environment interactions [17], synchronous interactive
signals taking on the valence of a social signal ampliﬁed by
certain hormones (e.g., oxytocin) [18], and cultural recycling of
brain areas to promote learning [19].

Early interactions are a cornerstone of the modern evolution
of Homo sapiens [20]. Compared to non-human primates,
modern humans have late development and an intense need for
social contact. In addition to meeting the basic needs of infants
(e.g., food) or being a condition for early learning (e.g., mother
tongue), the quality of the parent–child relationship plays a
role in the child’s social, emotional and cognitive development.
Interactions between infants and their partners occur on four
diﬀerent levels: behavioral, embodied, aﬀective, and imaginary.
They contribute to the emergence of intersubjectivity and the
construction of the self [21]. In the majority of situations, the
result is a child with a harmonious development who, upon
entering school, presents a certain number of qualities that
are protective vis-à-vis the later vicissitudes of life: feelings of
inner security, positive self-esteem, and a capacity for cognitive
inhibition and aﬀective resilience.

Dialogue between learning and
environment: The effect of culture

The learning of language explains a great deal about how
the environment contributes to the intimate development of the
brain. It is spontaneous for oral language and cultural for written

language. Language is one of the most fabulous and complex
human cognitive abilities. It provides us completely unique
possibilities of reﬂection and communication simultaneously at
the cognitive and interactive levels. However, it is wrong to
imagine that animal species are not capable of communication
since we ﬁnd capacities for perceptual categorization in monkeys
and birds, capacities for learning species-speciﬁc vocalizations in
monkeys and birds, and a form of motor babbling has even been
described in monkeys [22].

Oral language is a function that arises in humans from
early exposure to a language. A human cannot develop this
function if, as a baby, he or she is not spoken to. At the
same time, this development occurs over time and does not
require formal learning. In this regard, it diﬀers from learning
written language or reading, which requires being taught at
home or at school. Babies deprived of language interactions
during infancy cannot develop oral language. Thus, we can see
that this function in humans arises in the dynamics of early
language interactions and does not occur on a tabula rasa or
an exclusive genetic determinism [14]. One of the elements that
can be identiﬁed early is the specialization for the phonemes
of the mother tongue at the age of 6 months. At this age, we
see that babies are more attentive to the phonemes of their
language and that, moreover, in their vocalizations, they will
begin to use the speciﬁc vocalizations of their mother tongue
much more frequently. This specialization in the phonemes of a
language responds to statistical learning rules. The child explores

the frequency properties of language to which he is exposed.
This early experience will constrain the perceptual system at
the neural level. Mere exposure to language is insuﬃcient, and
alongside the aspects of language perception and production,
there is also a dimension of social and emotional interaction that
strongly inﬂuences this learning [14].

Learning to read is also an extraordinary example of
cerebral plasticity and an illustration of the way in which
education can “recycle” cerebral structures and modify them
for the appearance of a new function. From an evolutionary
point of view, it is a recent cultural learning (∼6,000 years
ago). Without speciﬁc teaching whether at school or at
home, the child does not learn to read. Learning to read
involves visual, auditory and motor functions. With most adult
readers, these tasks are fully automated. Many factors can
inﬂuence learning to read, such as oral language skills, context
and psychosocial support, educational strategies, and certain
cognitive or developmental aspects (attention, phonological
skills, visual-spatial discrimination, cognitive processing speed),
which in some cases will lead to dyslexia [23]. Even in recent
years when exclusively biological and genetic views have been
dominant, studies have shown the decisiveness of cultural and
social factors [24]. School education modiﬁes the visual cortical
areas and those of language according to a gradient proportional
to the intensity of this learning and its practice [25].

The development of mathematics (Figure 1) gives us an
example of cultural constraints on innate aptitudes involving

the adult

the ecosystem. Concerning the acquisition
all
levels of
of numeration,
is able to manipulate diﬀerent
representations that can be symbolic (Arabic numeral and
written word) or non-symbolic (estimate of size or subitizing).
From an evolutionary point of view, humans are not the only
animal to be able to compare sizes, since we can ﬁnd this
ability in monkeys. It responds to a logarithmic law, i.e., it
is particularly eﬃcient for the most distant quantities. The
baby also has this estimation of quantity. This very early
knowledge in the baby is also present in adults who have
not received any education or training in mathematics. In
educated adults, the representation in Arabic numerals becomes
very strongly associated with the non-symbolic processing
of quantity, which ends up creating a completely automated
second-order intuition [26]. In Western societies, this second
order of intuition follows a linear representation in base 10
favored in schools. Intensive mathematics education therefore
transforms the initial logarithmic representation into a linear
representation. It is a ﬁne example of cultural inﬂuence (here,
the exosystem represented by the school) on a faculty, which
is not only increased during development but also transformed
in its very nature [26]. Learning math skills also gives us an
example of the importance of the macrosystem because of very
strong gender stereotypes toward mathematics (“girls are less
good at math than boys”). In all Western societies, the vast
majority of engineers and mathematicians are men (e.g., only
one woman has received the Fields Medal since its creation),
with the exception of Korea and Singapore that do not value
these stereotypes. In other Western societies, these stereotypes
are transmitted by families and teachers. Since the launch of
programs to combat these stereotypes, we have observed that the
performance of girls in math tends to approach that of boys in
societies where gender equality is promoted [27].

The development of executive
functions and secure attachment

Executive functions include working memory, attention and
inhibition skills, and cognitive ﬂexibility. These are determining
cognitive functions for learning but also for adapting to the
world and for most complex cognitive functions such as
reasoning or problem solving. However, these do not have a
continuous progression until adulthood, and they depend on the
maturation of the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is the
last region of the brain to evolve and takes the longest to reach
full maturity. Thus, in children, working memory is quickly of
good quality, but inhibitory control is much less so [28]. This
inhibitory control involves being able to control one’s attention,
behavior, thoughts and/or emotions to overcome strong internal
stimulation or external lures and achieve what is expected of
oneself. In other words, it is a question of inhibiting the ﬁrst
heuristics to enter into new learning [29]. It is only around the

age of six that the child has enough capacity for inhibition. It is
for this reason that in most Western countries, schooling begins
at this age. For some authors, the epidemic of children with
attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is partly linked
to changes in schooling methods and current societal constraints
vis-à-vis young children [2]. However, it is now accepted that
education inﬂuences the development of inhibition capacities as
do many other environmental factors, which not only aﬀect the
development of executive functions but also are risk factors for
externalized disorders (see below).

If the development of executive functions is a pivot of
early development on a cognitive level, its counterpoint on the
psycho-aﬀective level is the development of attachment. If we
take an evolutionary perspective on how aﬃliation relationships
and the construction of attachment behaviors are organized, we
can better understand the following signiﬁcant changes [30].
(1) During evolution, we move from conditions of attachment
based on promiscuity, olfaction and nesting in rodents to
conditions of attachment based on exclusivity, multisensoriality,
partnership and culture in humans. Indeed, in humans, an
evolution of parental behavior has allowed the phenomena of
synchrony to overcome the olfactory and touch senses, thus
increasing the distance while keeping the link possible. (2)
Over the course of evolution, positive emotional investment
in aﬃliate bonds and in building a secure attachment have
become more important. In rodents, the negative emotional
valence is prevalent and constitutes a determining element of
alarm for the sharing of danger and the response to stress. In
humans, the repertoire of so-called negative emotions is much
more subtle, but these remain associated with fear and danger
or cultural avatars (taboos, prohibitions). However, we see in
monkeys that facial expressions exist and can be invested in a
mode of non-verbal communication between conspeciﬁcs and
even with diﬀerent meanings depending on the culture of the
group within the same species [31]. In humans, the fact of being
able to increase the distance of early bonds is contemporaneous
with the appearance of a verbal/audio channel that from the
start of early mother-baby relationships is an intentional mode
of communication. The distress signal then becomes the crying
of the baby [6]. At the same time, the mother will develop
a way of talking to the baby called motherese, which is very
rich in emotional valence [32]. Early exchanges are therefore
not only multisensory but also emotionally embodied positively
and/or negatively.

At a less intimate level of interaction between individuals,
we can also look at how interest in others (or empathy in
its broadest sense) may have become more complex during
evolution. We readily distinguish between emotional empathy,
which corresponds to concern for others and is found in
mammals and perhaps birds, and cognitive empathy, which
concerns certain large mammals and primates. There is also
a tendency to sometimes oppose competitive behaviors and
support cooperative behaviors at the level of 2-on-2 interactions

and within or between social groups. However, it is clear that this
behavioral opposition is also an emotional valence opposition
that is positive for cooperation and negative for competition.
Likewise, the way in which group ties are formed through
identity, political, religious, and artistic representations can also
be understood through the emotional valence associated with
them. In an emotionally negative way, the binding and the
cohesion of the group arise from fear of the other in the political
(nationalism and populism), religious (fundamentalism) or
artistic (art qualiﬁed as primitive or degenerate) spheres,
or positively when binding and cohesion relate to openness
to others and fulﬁllment through sharing and respect for
diﬀerences. To put

mental health

The “life history style” theory

Homo sapiens is part of the long evolutionary history
mentioned above. The Life History Theory is part of
this perspective, and makes it possible to account for the
inter-individual diﬀerences in the developmental timing and
expression of evolutionarily inﬂuenced traits. It addresses why
and how individuals distribute their limited metabolic resources
between growth, survival and reproduction, which are three
major challenges of evolution. The longer developmental period
of homo developmentalis allows him to more ﬂexibly adapt
to environmental conditions. Life History Theory is thus
a particularly relevant framework to explain inter-individual
diﬀerences in contemporary humans’ traits that are highly
inﬂuenced by the environment, as mentioned above.

Depending on the level of adversity experienced during
infancy and childhood (harsh and unpredictable environment
vs. soft and predictable environment), the theory distinguishes
two adaptive styles called “fast” and “slow” characterized by
a series of oppositions both at the level of personality traits
as well as mental and physical health risks. The fast style is
characterized by greater motivation for short-term beneﬁts,
frequent insecure attachments, earlier puberty and sexuality,
an unstable emotional
life, more anxiety and depression
pathologies, and more cardiovascular issues. In contrast, the
slow style is characterized by opposite cues. These styles,
which are not pathological themselves, illustrate how, from
an evolutionary point of view, individuals subjected to more
adversity will favor adaptive methods that make it possible to
respond to the immediate dangers perceived as more numerous
and to expose them to greater risk of learning aggressive
behaviors [33].

Contribution for conditions with
aggressiveness

From birth, a child knows how to show his displeasure even
before he becomes angry. There is a continuum between his
or her reactions to lack, frustration and the manifestation of
more or less aggressive demands regarding asking, claiming,
and demanding. The ﬁrst directly aggressive behaviors occur
at the end of the second year and during the third year.
toddlers may present rage reactions. At ∼2–3

years, the child frequently adopts opposing or angry behaviors.
At this time, he or she attacks, claws, pulls hair, and bites
children of his own age during play. These reactions fade at
approximately 4 years old: the child expresses his aggressiveness
verbally but no longer in behaviors. At
the
child’s aggressive fantasies are often rich and numerous, as
evidenced by his or her games, and at the same time, dreams
of anxiety and aggression make their appearance. However,
violence is minimal as inhibitory processes help the child to
socialize [23].

this stage,

Some children continue to be violent, hitting their
classmates, even adults or their parents, breaking other people’s
things or their own. These children often belong to the fast
style of the “life history style” theory and may enter into violent
anger or even real reactions of rage [34]. They tend to use others
and especially their parents as mere instruments placed at their
disposal: they do not tolerate any delay in the satisfaction of
their requests. Sometimes this attitude is selective, occurring
only in the presence of certain people: one or the other parent
or teachers. To a greater degree, the reaction of intolerance
to frustration can appear for the most minimal reasons even
outside of any relationship with a person. The sequence of
anger/agitation/kicking or punching in all directions/ﬁnal self-
aggression shows the importance of aggressive impulses, the
poor distinction between the self and the external world, and
the diﬃculties of emotional regulation and cognitive inhibition.
In mental health nosography, pathological aggressiveness as a
symptom appears in several clinical pictures. For some children,
aggression/irritability can be considered a manifestation of
depression; as a cardinal symptom, aggression appears mainly
in childhood externalizing disorders: ADHD, oppositional
disorder with deﬁant behavior (ODD), conduct disorder
(CD) and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD).
Figure 2 summarizes how to determine these main pathologies
during development in the context of the developmental and
micro/macro perspectives mentioned above. In terms of age
of onset, pathologies are part of a developmental agenda,
with binomial ADHD/ODD appearing in childhood, then as
CD in preadolescence, and ﬁnally as antisocial personality in
adults. Transitions are not systematic during development and
depend on modulating factors such as level of impulsivity,
lack of empathy or prosocial
aggression and hyperactivity;
low self-esteem,
emotion; capacity for inhibition or guilt;

insecure attachment, or diﬃculty with emotional regulation;
and very importantly environmental factors such as hostile
critical parenting. Environmental factors are numerous, diverse
and aﬀect all micro/macro levels [35]. It should be noted
that the causal valence of most of them is non-speciﬁc since
several of them are associated with an increased risk of learning
aggression pathologies but also of anxiodepressive, borderline or
neurodevelopment pathologies [36].

Contribution to borderline
psychopathology

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and
frequent disorder in adolescents characterized by a pervasive
instability aﬀecting impulse control, emotional
pattern of
regulation, cognitive processing, sense of self and agency and
interpersonal relationships. Patients’ personal histories are often
marked by stressful or traumatic experiences, often repeated.
Clinical signs of the disorder include both chronic and acute
features, with acute features being mostly triggered by acute
stressful situations. Such features include transient cognitive
distortion, intense anger, uncontrollable impulsivity, and self-
harm behaviors (including suicide) and contribute to the burden

of the disease [37]. Many aspects, including epidemiological,
clinical, and physiological aspects, contribute to the relationship
between BDP and stress as an adaptation to adversity. Although
the pathogenesis of BDP remains uncertain, the literature
reﬂects a speciﬁc biological and neural pattern of altered stress
perception and regulation in BPD.

forward the idea that

Figure 3 addresses the poorly characterized relation between
self-disturbances and adverse life conditions encountered early
in life in BDP. We highlight the potential relevance of “life
history style” theory (the aforementioned major framework
in evolutionary developmental biology) to make sense of
this association. We put
the eﬀect
of early life adversity on BPD symptomatology depends on
the way individuals trade their limited resources between
competing biological
functions during development. The
available literature supports this hypothesis, as BDP seems
to share the main characteristics found in the fast style of
the “life history style” theory [38]. However, in contrast to
externalizing disorders such as conduct disorder,
in which
impulse control and executive functions may be altered, it
appears in BDP that interpersonal hypersensitivity, insecure
attachment, identity disturbance, emotion dysregulation are also
signiﬁcant psychological dimensions. To add another layer of
complexity, some authors argue that emotional dysregulation is
in fact an aﬀective instability or an issue related to inhibitory
control of aﬀective impulse.
