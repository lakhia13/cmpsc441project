The present paper aims to provide the latest perspectives and future directions on 
the association between emotions and eating behavior. We discussed individual 
differences  in  the  impact  of  negative  emotions  on  eating,  emotional  eating  as 
disinhibited eating decisions with heightened reward values of and sensitivity to 
palatable foods in response to negative emotions and social isolation, in addition 
to emotional eating as maladaptive coping strategies under negative emotion and 
stress, hedonic (pleasure-oriented) eating decisions mediated by the brain reward 
system,  and  self-controlled  (health-oriented)  eating  decisions  mediated  by  the 
brain control system. Perspectives on future directions were addressed, including 
the development of early eating phenotypes in infancy, shared neural mechanisms 
mediated  by  the  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex  and  the  dorsolateral  prefrontal 
cortex in emotion and eating decision regulation, possible roles of interoception 
incorporating  hunger  and  satiety  signals,  gut  microbiome,  the  insula  and  the 
orbitofrontal cortex, and emotional processing capacities in hedonic eating and 
weight gain.

Introduction

Emotions  affect  human  behavior  in  various  ways,  such  as  motivating  goal-directed 
behaviors,  anticipating  future  outcomes,  and  supporting  reward  learning  (Dolan,  2002). 
Emotions also can influence our food consumption and eating decisions regarding how much 
and when to eat certain foods (Meule and Vogele, 2013). Research has shown that the interplays 
across different types and intensity of emotions (e.g., negative vs. positive), eating styles (e.g., 
emotional eating—a tendency to eat in response to negative emotions; restrained eating—
cognitive and behavioral restriction of food intake to control body weight; external eating—high 
susceptibility to food cues that results in craving for high-caloric, palatable foods), weight status, 
and types of foods (e.g., energy-dense, low-nutritious, unhealthier foods vs. nutritious, healthier 
foods) lead to different eating behaviors. Yet, emotion-eating mechanisms have not been fully 
identified.  The  mechanisms  underneath  emotion-related  changes  in  eating  behavior  are 
multifaceted due to high variabilities across individuals and emotions (Macht, 2008). We focused 
on current findings exploring the impact of negative emotions on eating behavior and the 
decision-making  mechanism  in  emotional  eating,  which  provided  perspectives  on  future 
research directions.

Emotions and their impacts on eating 
behavior

More often than not, negative emotions tend to decrease food 
consumption, while positive emotions increase it (Evers et al., 2018; 
Reichenberger et al., 2018). However, negative emotions can evoke 
external eating in high-emotional eaters than in low-emotional eaters 
(Blechert  et  al.,  2014).  Negative  emotions  can  increase  food 
consumption in restrained eaters as well due to disturbed cognitive 
inhibition of food intake (Evers et al., 2018). Furthermore, negative 
emotions do not necessarily induce increased eating among emotional 
eaters or individuals with overweight or obese (Evers et al., 2018; Zhou 
and Tse, 2020).

To  explain  the  inconsistency  and  varying  impacts  of  negative 
emotions on eating, recent studies have proposed the importance of 
individual  differences  including  individualistic  emotion-eating 
experiences and the impact of discrete emotions (Altheimer and Urry, 
2019).  They  emphasized  a  learned  association  between  discrete 
negative emotions and eating, rather than general negative emotions, 
which can vary across individuals (Altheimer and Urry, 2019). People 
who have previously formed an association between emotion and 
eating (food consumption or restriction) are more likely to engage in 
emotional  or  restricted  eating  in  response  to  discrete  negative 
emotions like depression and anxiety. For example, sadness increased 
food consumption more than joy in women high-emotional eaters, 
while sadness and joy did not differently influence food intake in 
low-emotional eaters (van Strien et al., 2013). Moreover, depression 
was related to weight gain regarding body mass index (BMI) change 
in only women emotional eaters, but not in men emotional eaters as 
well as external eaters and restricted eaters in either sex (van Strien 
et al., 2016).

Recent  research  has  elucidated  individual  differences  in  how 
emotions impact hedonic eating (i.e., taste-oriented intake of high-
caloric and low-nutrient food with high sugar, salt, and fat for pleasure 
without  hunger)  and  homeostatic  eating  (i.e.,  food  intake  with  a 
hunger for regulating energy balance) in different contexts (Lutter and 
Nestler,  2009;  Reichenberger  et  al.,  2018;  Devonport  et  al.,  2019). 
Induced  anger,  fear,  and  sadness  increased  consumption  of  sweet 
foods (Salerno et al., 2014). But when sensitivity to long-term risks of 
hedonic eating was primed, sadness restricted hedonic eating, which 
may be relevant to the function of sadness to become more vigilant to 
a loss or harm (Salerno et al., 2014).

Both  adults’  depression  and  emotional  eating  were  related  to 
hedonic eating and a higher BMI (Konttinen et al., 2010). More severe 
depressive symptoms were linked to less consumption of fruits and 
vegetables and more consumption of non-sweet energy-dense foods, 
but not was not related to more consumption of sweet foods when 
emotional eating was controlled. When depression was controlled, 
higher emotional eating was linked to more consumption of sweet and 
non-sweet energy-dense foods. Results demonstrate that experiencing 
sadness or depressive moods does not necessarily decrease energy 
intake. Negative emotions are likely to increase overeating of energy-
dense  foods  and  decrease  consumption  of  healthier  options. 
Furthermore,  the  interaction  between  negative  emotions  and 
emotional eating matters. When emotional eating was examined using 
ecological  momentary  assessments  (EMA)  where  people  reported 
their emotions and eating behavior for 10 days, emotional eating and 
BMI influenced hedonic and homeostatic eating (Reichenberger et al., 

2018).  High  negative  emotions  increased  hedonic  eating  in  high-
emotional  eaters  but  decreased  it  in  low-emotional  eaters;  high 
negative emotions increased homeostatic eating in people with higher 
BMI. In addition, emotional processing capabilities may be linked to 
emotional eating in individuals with obesity. Similar to individuals 
with  anxiety  disorders  or  depression  who  often  demonstrate 
difficulties in recognizing negative emotions (Demenescu et al., 2010), 
individuals  with  obesity  are  more  likely  to  show  difficulties  in 
recognizing fearful and angry facial expressions (Scarpina et al., 2021) 
and  describing  and  regulating  emotions  (Fernandes  et  al.,  2018). 
Challenges in emotional processing may reflect emotional avoidance 
to  cope  with  negative  emotions  related  to  body  dissatisfaction  or 
weight stigmatization in individuals with obesity (Fernandes et al., 
2018), which could lead to emotional eating.

Findings suggest that emotional eating is prone to unhealthier, 
taste-oriented  food  choices  under  negative  emotions.  Negative 
emotions tend to focus on short-term gratification at the expense of 
long-term health risk considerations. Given the relationship between 
emotional eating and less adaptive coping strategies like emotion-
oriented  (i.e.,  coping  through  regulating  negative  emotional 
responses)  and  avoidant  coping  (i.e.,  avoiding  or  distracting  from 
negative stress responses) (Spoor et al., 2007), hedonic eating could 
reflect less adaptive coping attempts for mitigating negative emotions 
in emotional eaters (Goossens et al., 2009).

Food-evoked emotions, reward 
values, and food decisions

Food consumption is most likely to elicit positive emotions like 
satisfaction and enjoyment rather than negative emotions (Desmet 
and Schifferstein, 2008). Conceptually, people associate sweet taste 
with  positive  emotion-laden  words  like  happiness,  love,  grateful, 
acceptance, hug, and kiss, and bitter taste with negative emotion-laden 
words like sad, disgust, and rejection (Zhou and Tse, 2020). Sensory 
experiences can be embodied in psychological states and emotions 
through  repeated  associations  between  taste  and  emotion  (e.g., 
associations between sweet taste and happiness) from early on in our 
lives (Zhou and Tse, 2020, 2022).

Individualistic  food  experiences  from  prenatal  periods  may 
impact sensory preferences. Infants are predisposed to like sweet and 
salty tastes and dislike sour and bitter tastes (Birch and Fisher, 1998). 
It has adaptive values that allow infants to find safe food sources like 
the  sweet  taste  of  breast  milk.  However,  in  the  most  modern 
obesogenic societies of food abundance, a preference for sweet, salty, 
and fatty foods is more likely to result in poorer nutritious choices and 
weight gain (Birch and Fisher, 1998). Developing less predisposed-
taste-oriented food choices can be critical for physical and mental 
health. Accepting more nutritious foods (e.g., leafy vegetables and 
beans) and learning to regulate emotions adaptively could prevent 
disinhibited overconsumption of sweet, high-caloric, low-nutritious 
foods  in  response  to  negative  emotions  and  stress.  Nevertheless, 
challenges lie in that we are inclined to “eat” palatable and energy-
dense foods rather than reject foods for secure energy intake (Ha et al., 
2016). Anticipating and consuming palatable foods are associated 
with pleasure mediated by the brain reward system (Kringelbach et al., 
2012; Berridge and Kringelbach, 2013; Volkow et al., 2013; Alonso-
Alonso  et  al.,  2015).  Moreover,  food  taste  preference  is  a  major

determinant of eating decisions (Raghunathan et al., 2006; Gutjar 
et al., 2015; Ha et al., 2019).

People make eating decisions based on subjective reward values 
of food attributes, specifically, food taste and health. Decision values 
of food taste and health attributes are encoded in the ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that involved in reward value computation 
(Hare et al., 2009; Clithero and Rangel, 2013; Bruce et al., 2016; Lim 
et al., 2023). Hedonic, pleasure-oriented decisions that predominantly 
incorporate food taste attributes lead to less nutritious, unhealthier 
eating and/or weight gain (Lim et al., 2018, 2023). To make more 
nutritious, healthier decisions, the health attributes of food need to 
be  considered.  In  health-oriented,  self-controlled  decisions  (i.e., 
refusing  tasty  but  unhealthy  foods  or  eating  not-tasty  but  healthy 
foods) mediated by the brain control system (Chib et al., 2009; Hare 
et  al.,  2009;  Lim  et  al.,  2016,  2023),  food  health  attributes  are 
incorporated early and significant enough during decision process 
(Sullivan et al., 2015; Lim et al., 2018), which allows people to pursue 
long-term  health  benefits  rather  than  immediate  pleasure  from 
palatable, but less nutritious and unhealthier foods (Ha et al., 2016, 
2021; van Meer et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2018).

Emotional  eating  is  related  to  impulsive,  less  self-controlled 
decisions  in  response  to  negative  emotions  or  stress  (Elfhag  and 
Morey, 2008; Verstuyf et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2014). Emotional eating 
tends to be associated with external eating (e.g., overconsumption in 
response  to  external  food  cues  like  the  smell  of  food  and  food 
advertisements)  (van  Bloemendaal  et  al.,  2015;  van  Strien,  2018), 
which supports lapses of self-control in emotional eating. Overriding 
immediate pleasure for long-term health goals becomes arduous for 
emotional eaters when emotional distress increases reward values of 
palatable, high-caloric foods and sensitivity to those food cues in the 
brain reward system including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and 
ventral striatum (Wagner et al., 2012; van Bloemendaal et al., 2015). 
Under negative emotions or stress, heightened sensitivity to food cues 
and reward values lead to increased cravings for palatable foods and 
disinhibited eating in people with obesity as well (Jastreboff et al., 
2013). Craving, or motivations for seeking palatable foods are encoded 
in  the  mesolimbic  dopamine  reward  system,  especially  in  the 
substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Meye and 
Adan,  2014).  Intranasal  oxytocin  administration  reduces  the 
consumption of palatable foods and decreases activations in the VTA 
in response to high-calorie food cues in men with overweight and 
obesity (Plessow et al., 2018). These findings suggest that associations 
between negative emotion and hedonic eating are linked to changes 
in the brain reward system, which make people more prone to craving 
and overconsumption of palatable foods, especially among emotional 
eaters and people with excessive weight.

Hedonic eating is also linked to affection and social needs. Sweet 
taste often forms an association with warmth and love (Chan et al., 
2013; Ren et al., 2015). Sweet taste and a romantic partner activate 
similar  neural  responses  in  the  anterior  cingulate  cortex  that  are 
involved in the reward system (Bartels and Zeki, 2000; Araujo et al., 
2003).  When  people  are  lacking  warmth  and  love,  deprivation  of 
positive emotions and social connection could result in compensatory 
reward-seeking behaviors, including craving and over-consumption 
of low-nutritious sweet foods (Henriksen et al., 2014; Tomova et al., 
2020;  Doan  et  al.,  2022).  Loneliness  increased  craving  for  sugar-
sweetened beverages measured using an EMA in adolescents (Doan 
et al., 2022). Loneliness increased the consumption of sweet beverages, 

while perceived social connection decreased the consumption of sweet 
beverages  in  pregnant  women  (Henriksen  et  al.,  2014).  In  young 
adults,  deprivation  of  social  connection  and  food  evoked  similar 
behavioral and neural responses (Tomova et al., 2020). Acute social 
isolation resulted in increased negative emotions and increased social 
craving,  and  fasting  resulted  in  increased  negative  emotions  and 
increased food craving and hunger (Tomova et al., 2020). The level of 
self-reported cravings for social connection and cravings for food after 
deprivation  were  strongly  correlated.  Further,  both  types  of 
deprivation  evoked  similar  responses  in  dopaminergic  midbrain 
regions involved in craving and seeking palatable foods, specifically in 
the SN and VTA.

In  sum,  food  evokes  positive  emotions.  Learned  associations 
between food and negative emotions may heighten emotional eating 
that is prone to disinhibited eating decisions of seeking palatable foods 
in  response  to  negative  emotions,  social  isolation,  and  stress.  For 
better mental and physical health, it will be crucial to develop more 
adaptive emotion regulation, coping strategies, and health-oriented, 
self-controlled eating decisions.

Discussion

While much is yet to unfold, recent advances may shed light on 
new perspectives in understanding the relationship between emotion 
and eating behaviors.

Exploring pleasure-seeking and eating phenotypes in early life 
may provide important knowledge about the development of hedonic 
eating. Food preferences and appetite traits begin to develop from 
prenatal periods influenced by genetic predispositions and maternal 
food  choices  (Ventura  and  Worobey,  2013).  Given  that  infants 
transition to adult foods during the first 2 years (Carruth et al., 2004), 
early food experiences could lay the foundation for food preferences 
(Domel et al., 1996; Gibson et al., 1998; Howard et al., 2012; Mura 
Paroche  et  al.,  2017).  One  of  the  prominent  obesogenic  eating 
phenotypes is sensitivity to external food cues, which often results in 
overeating that potentially leads to obesity (Carnell et al., 2013). One 
study demonstrated that 6- to 12-month-olds with rapid weight gain 
showed  higher  responsivity  (touching)  to  foods  over  nonfoods, 
suggesting  that  early  heightened  sensitivity  to  food  cues  could 
influence rapid weight gain (Buvinger et al., 2017). Moreover, 9- to 
18-month-old  infants  with  more  rapid  weight  gain  (i.e.,  greater 
weight-for-length z scores) found a favorite food was more rewarding 
than nonfood alternatives (a toy and DVD) compared to lean infants. 
Interestingly, reward values of nonfood alternatives were significantly 
lower among infants with more rapid weight gain than lean infants. 
These  findings  suggest  that  infants  with  rapid  weight  gain  have 
developed  heightened  food  reward-seeking  along  with  a  lack  of 
alternative sources for pleasure-seeking, which could contribute to 
hedonic eating and weight gain in their later lives. It will be worth 
examining  how  early  preferences  to  food  and  other  objects  are 
associated  with  the  development  of  hedonic  eating  and  risks 
for obesity.

A more holistic understanding of shared neural mechanisms of 
emotion and eating behavior may shed light on the intervention of 
hedonic  eating.  Common  neural  mechanisms  of  emotion  and 
eating  behavior  regulations  have  been  identified  (Godet  et  al., 
2022). The vmPFC mediates valuations of emotional food stimuli

considering  people’s  current  goals  and  contexts  (Ochsner  et  al., 
2012; Lim et al., 2023). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) 
mediates  both  emotion  regulations  (Ochsner  and  Gross,  2005; 
Ochsner  et  al.,  2012)  and  eating  regulations  (Hare  et  al.,  2009; 
Hutcherson et al., 2012) by incorporating long-term goals into value 
representation in the vmPFC (Hare et al., 2009; Hutcherson et al., 
2012). Recent research has demonstrated the positive effect of the 
dlPFC modification using transcranial direct-current stimulation 
(tDCS)  on  emotion,  such  as  reduced  emotional  reactivity  to 
negative emotions (Clarke et al., 2020), enhanced cognitive control 
of emotion regulation (Feeser et al., 2014), and decreased anxiety 
and stress responses measured by cortisol levels (Mehrsafar et al., 
2020).  Similarly,  some  research  demonstrated  that  the  dlPFC 
modulation  using  tDCS  reduced  food  craving,  liking,  and/or 
consumption  in  healthy-weight  adults  with  higher  food  craving 
(Jauch-Chara et al., 2014; Kekic et al., 2014; Lapenta et al., 2014; 
Anderson et al., 2023), in adults with overweight and higher food 
craving (Ljubisavljevic et al., 2016), and adults with obesity and 
binge eating disorder (Burgess et al., 2016). However, other studies 
did  not  find  significant  changes  in  food  cravings,  choice,  and 
consumption (Georgii et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2017; Beaumont et al., 
2021). Individual differences in eating and psychological aspects 
could  play  a  role  in  inconsistent  findings,  given  results  vary 
depending on the level of susceptibility to hedonic eating, types of 
eating behaviors, and psychological traits (Ray et al., 2017). For 
example,  the  dlPFC  modulation  via  tDCS  did  not  change  food 
cravings  and  consumption  in  healthy-weight  adults  with  lower 
hedonic  eating  (Beaumont  et  al.,  2021).  The  dlPFC  modulation 
reduced food liking (pleasure) but not unhealthy food choices in 
healthy-weight adults with higher food cravings (Anderson et al., 
2023). Further research is necessary to determine the effectiveness 
of neural modulation in food craving and consumption.

Recently,  individual  differences  in  interoception  and  gut 
microbiome have been considered to provide an insight of the 
association  between  emotion  and  eating.  Interoception  is  the 
ability to accurately sense internal body signals (Garfinkel et al., 
2015; Khalsa et al., 2018). Poorer interoception is linked to worse 
emotion regulation (Füstös et al., 2012), higher emotional eating 
and BMI (Robinson et al., 2021), and disordered eating (Ahlich 
and  Rancourt,  2022).  Hypersensitivity  to  interoceptive  hunger 
signals and less accurate detection of satiety and energy balance 
signals are prone to hedonic eating and obesity (Simmons and 
DeVille, 2017). The variation in gut microbiome consisted of 1013 
to 1014 microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal system (Le 
Chatelier et al., 2013) including reduced bacterial diversity and 
altered composition may contribute to delayed satiety setpoint 
(Yatsunenko  et  al.,  2012),  food  craving  (Alcock  et  al.,  2014), 
dysregulated energy balance and weight gain (Le Chatelier et al., 
2013; Davis, 2016; Torres-Fuentes et al., 2017), and disordered 
eating  (Terry  et  al.,  2022).  Via  the  vagus  nerve,  some  gut 
microbiota and gastrointestinal signals are delivered to the brain, 
which bidirectionally influence emotional experiences like anxiety 
and  stress  (Breit  et  al.,  2018).  The  insula  integrates  projected 
interoceptive signals with emotional, cognitive, and motivational 
signals that result in explicit experiences of positive and negative 
emotions  (Namkung  et  al.,  2017).  The  anterior  insula  relays 
saliency signals associated with emotions (e.g., pleasure, pain) to 

dlPFC for initiating attentive control (Menon and Uddin, 2010) 
and represents past emotional experiences in similar contexts to 
vmPFC to evaluate outcomes for future decisions (Namkung et al., 
2017).  The  anterior  insula  is  a  part  of  the  primary  taste  and 
olfactory cortex (Rolls, 2016), along with the OFC involved in the 
modulation of taste reactions, affective representation of rewards 
(e.g., pleasure from palatable foods), and food-evoked emotion 
(Kringelbach,  2005).  Research  reported  that  higher  emotional 
eating was linked to greater activations of the insula and the OFC 
(Bohon et al., 2009; van Bloemendaal et al., 2015) but see Bohon 
(2014). These findings may account for the multifaceted role of 
the insula and the OFC across interoception, emotion generation 
and  modulation,  taste  perception,  and  responses  to  food  cues, 
which suggests overlapping mechanisms under emotion and food 
processing (Frank et al., 2013).

Altogether, we have addressed commonalities across emotion and 
eating, while emphasizing the importance of variability and individual 
differences in understanding the association between emotion and 
eating behaviors. Further investigations on neural, physiological, and 
decision-making  mechanisms  of  emotional  eating  and  effective 
intervention  and  prevention  of  hedonic  and  emotional  eating 
are warranted.
