Abstract: Perinatal mental health issues in women can lead to a variety of health complications
for both mother and child. Building resilience can strengthen coping mechanisms for pregnant
women to improve their mental health and protect themselves and their children. The study aims to
develop and validate the contextual and cultural appropriateness of the Safe Motherhood-Accessible
Resilience Training (SM-ART) intervention for pregnant women in Pakistan. A three-phase approach
was used to develop and validate an intervention that promotes resilience in pregnant women.
Phase I comprised a needs assessment with stakeholders (pregnant women and key informants)
to elicit opinions regarding module content. In Phase II, an intervention to build resilience was
developed with the help of a literature review and formative assessment ﬁndings, and Phase III
involved the validation of the intervention by eight mental health experts. The experts assessed
the Content Validity Index (CVI) of the SM-ART intervention on a self-developed checklist. The
resultant SM-ART intervention consists of six modules with strong to perfect CVI scores for each of
the modules. Qualitative responses endorsed the strengths of the intervention as having innovative
and engaging activities, contextual and cultural relevance, and a detailed, comprehensive facilitator
guide. SM-ART was successfully developed and validated and is now ready for testing to promote
the resilience of pregnant women at risk of perinatal mental illness.

1. Introduction

Perinatal mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and postpar-
tum psychoses have a signiﬁcant impact on maternal and infant morbidity [1–3]. Meta-
analyses of studies conducted on samples of pregnant women reveal that one-ﬁfth of
women experience a mental health issue during their pregnancy [4–6] with 10–20% of
women encountering symptoms of depression or anxiety, or both depression and anx-
iety [7]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of forty-three studies revealed that in
Pakistan, the pooled prevalence of antenatal depression and postnatal depression were 37%
and 30%, respectively [8].

Perinatal mental illnesses are strongly associated with a range of physical (con-
genital malformations, undernourishment, low birth weight, and stunting) problems in
infants [9–13]. For example, a retrospective Australian study concluded that infants of
depressed pregnant women had lower birth weight and shorter gestational ages, whereas
signiﬁcant birth complications were noticed in babies of women who experienced anxiety

during pregnancy. Low Apgar scale scores (a 1–10 scale representing how well the baby is
doing after birth, with 10 being the best) were common in both the depression and anxiety
groups [7]. Evidence of decreased cephalic circumference and challenging cognitive issues
in infancy is also related to mothers’ disturbed mental health during pregnancy [14]. Chil-
dren born to mentally disturbed mothers can face numerous developmental issues related
to cognition, speech, and behavior [15], as well as autism and attention deﬁcit disorder [16].
Epigenetic research explains the association between the poor mental health of mothers and
their children. Babies born to such mothers have emotional dysregulation due to disturbed
fetal programming and increased stress sensitivity [17]. A study by Send et al., 2014 [18]
showed that maternal stress and anxiety are negatively correlated with fetal longevity.
Moreover, telomere length (a proxy for biological aging) is signiﬁcantly shorter in a fetus
with a depressed mother compared to a relatively healthier mother [18].

Perinatal mental illness and coinciding elevated levels of cortisol in the perinatal
period can lead to a variety of mental and physical health problems in mothers and their
children. Issues such as pre-eclampsia, premature and difﬁcult births, increased risk of fetal
growth restriction, and bonding and attachment problems can all be directly correlated
with mental health problems during pregnancy [19]. As these issues can lead to lifelong
health concerns that span across generations, the World Health Organization strongly
emphasizes the need to allocate greater attention to the prevention of mental illness during
pregnancy and the promotion of mental health in healthcare systems across the globe [20].
Many organizations are helping create a space where expectant mothers can express their
worries [21–23].

During the perinatal period, women who demonstrate resilience attributes such as
moderate to high levels of self-efﬁcacy, sense of mastery, self-esteem, and optimism can
deal effectively with stressors in the environment [24]. The concept of resilience varies
among authors. One simply states that it is an ability to cope with shocks and continue life
as a routine [25]. Southwick et al., 2012 [26], on the other hand, described it as an ongoing
process of positive adaptability regardless of the hardships of life [26], wherein it is viewed
as a buffer to stress and a sign of greater emotional regulation [27,28]. Resilience has also
been considered a personality trait, although it is currently viewed as a learned skill that
develops with the adversity of life [29]. Higher resilience is associated with reduced anxiety
and depression [30], and women who possess resilience traits are better able to handle
environmental challenges. Low resilience has been associated with poorer pregnancy
outcomes, and higher resilience increases coping ability [31]. One study highlighted
resilience as a mediating factor in smooth pregnancy [28], while another study conducted
in Spain examined hair cortisol levels and found an inverse relationship between resilience
and cortisol levels (an indicator of stress) [32].

Thus, promoting perinatal mental wellbeing via enhancing pregnant women’s inner
strength, building resilience, and adopting healthy coping skills could prevent and address
perinatal mental illness [33,34]. Such strategies show promise as early interventions, for
mothers and their children’s mental well-being, are being based on a paradigm shift from a
disease-based to a strengths-based approach.

Previous studies have shown that Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) [35] and
Positive Psychology interventions [36] are effective in enhancing the mental wellbeing
of women during the perinatal period. A trial conducted in Iran used CBT as an inter-
vention to reinforce mental wellbeing during pregnancy. Scores for depression, anxiety,
and stress were found to be signiﬁcantly lower in the intervention group compared to
the control group [37]. Similarly, another study conducted in Turkey reported that CBT
during pregnancy results in a decline of post-intervention anxiety scores [38]. A RCT
conducted in Australia on mindfulness intervention (meditation and cognitive exercises)
to reduce depression and anxiety in the perinatal period reported signiﬁcant decreases
in depression, anxiety, and stress scores in the intervention arm [39]. To date, there was
only one trial conducted in Pakistan that tested the effectiveness of a ’thinking healthy’
program in pregnancy; however, no change was observed post-intervention [40]. Yet to

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5517

our knowledge, interventions enhancing resilience to prevent and/or address perinatal
mental illness have neither been created nor tested for pregnant women in Pakistan. Hence,
resilience, or the capacity for strength, positivity, optimism, competency, and capability to
be able to cope with daily life stressors, may be a useful focus for pregnant women [41].

The pregnancy period is considered a window of opportunity to foster resilience and
adaptation in mothers and their newborns [42]. Programs that promote resilience in the
perinatal period aim to improve mental well-being in a way that is individual-focused,
cost/time effective, and encourages self-motivated practices [35,36]. Our literature search
shows that there is a scarcity of research on positive psychological interventions in Pakistan,
especially for pregnant women. We expect to bridge this gap by adding to the evidence-
based literature on enhancing the individual strengths and positive mental well-being
of women during their perinatal period, through the development and validation of a
strengths-based resilience-building module. This paper reports the development and
validation of the Safe Motherhood-Accessible Resilience Training (SM-ART) intervention
for pregnant women in Pakistan.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design

The study was conducted in three phases: Needs Assessment; Development of Re-
silience Building Intervention; and Validation of Intervention. Ethics approval (ERC-2020-
1197-10212) was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the Aga Khan University,
Pakistan, before the commencement of data collection. Written consent was obtained from
all participants.

2.1.1. Phase I: Needs Assessment

To develop the intervention’s content, a review of the literature and interviews with
25 pertinent stakeholders (17 pregnant women and 8 key informants, including psycholo-
gists, psychiatrists, and nurses) were conducted.

All the women were married and aged 18 years or older, with a 12-week and above
gestational age. The key informants were mental health experts with more than ﬁve years of
ﬁeld experience. All the experts were well-versed in the Pakistani cultural and clinical context.
Moreover, both government and private representation were ensured while recruiting.

The semi-structured interview questions ascertained pregnant women’s views on the
role of resilience-building skills and their attribution to the management of mental health
issues. They were asked about their own experiences managing everyday challenges. The
interview guide developed especially for these women has explored the resilience attributes
incorporated within Wagnild and Young’s resilience framework [43,44]. The concepts
explored during the interview were purpose/meaning of life; perseverance/determination;
existential aloneness/friendship with oneself; equanimity; and self-reliance. On the other
hand, KIs interview questions focused on their opinions about the module’s content,
structure, and approach as well as their opinions about its applicability/relevance in
a Pakistani context. They were asked for their availability to validate the intervention
after its development. Both the stakeholders (participants and KIs) were asked about the
acceptability of the proposed intervention. Their interview guide was developed by the
research team after a thorough literature review and based on their prior experiences.

In order to avoid outside noise and distractions, interviews with key informants were
conducted and recorded in a private space. The facilitator kept ﬁeld notes to record the
participants’ non-verbal responses—such as eye contact, facial expressions, tone and pitch
of voice, and body language. The interviews with the pregnant women lasted between
40 and 60 min, and 35 and 50 min for the mental health experts. Interview sessions were
continued until data saturation was reached—that is, when the participants delivered little
or no new information.

The responses that were conducted and transcribed into Urdu were translated into
English and then translated back into Urdu. The back-translation into Urdu was compared

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5517

4 of 16

with the original transcription to establish coherence between the English and Urdu versions
of the interview and to detect any discrepancies in translation. The data were manually
analyzed using thematic analysis. Verbatim transcriptions were coded openly and merged
into categories and themes. Themes were generated, and each theme was named using a
content-characteristic description. For data analysis, a variety of sources (ﬁeld notes, audio
recordings, transcriptions, and the researcher’s reﬂections) were considered. The detailed
analysis steps we used are described in our initial project publication [45].

2.1.2. Phase II: Development of the Intervention

It emerged from Phase I that an intervention would need to be adaptive and engaging
given the variety of issues faced by Pakistani women, including cultural factors, domes-
tic responsibilities, academic difﬁculties, dropout risk, husband approval, and a lack of
enthusiasm for learning. Additionally, Phase I ﬁndings highlighted the need to create
a comprehensive yet accessible approach because of the anticipated variety of personal
characteristics related to educational background, ethnicity, age, and gestational age. There-
fore, the research team members having expertise in mental health, maternal and perinatal
health, and intervention development have carefully and thoroughly reviewed, discussed,
and developed the content of the intervention based on the feedback and responses from
stakeholders. The consensus from numerous team discussions led to the development of
contextually appropriate activities and approaches. The principal investigators explored
teaching and learning engagement strategies appropriate for the target audience. The
content of each module was delivered through a combination of multiple innovative and
creative strategies (reﬂective stories, culturally relevant pictures, eye-catching ﬂashcards,
soothing poetry, interactive discussion, roleplay, etc.) on the theme. This is to avoid a
monotonous approach and ensure that all participants can understand and feel involved,
engaged, and retained. We, therefore, want to create material and have also worked
on a method for delivering and communicating the content in the most appealing and
effective way.

Considering the low literacy rate of Pakistani women, the Gunning Fog Index (GFI)
was applied to each sentence, paragraph, and module to verify that the language used
was simple, easy, and comprehensive [46]. The GFI employs a six-step process to extract a
quantitative measurement of the grade level of education to which a speciﬁc section of text
pertains. Speciﬁcally, sentence and word length are calculated, and it is recommended that
the index score be in the single digits in order to increase readability and accessibility [46].
This index allows us to scientiﬁcally prove that our intervention is understandable.

In order to use a more stringent process to test quality, which was only available in
English, the module was developed in English before being translated into the local Urdu
language by a professional linguist.

The intervention comprised six modules based on six different themes. Each theme
contained innovative activities designed sequentially. Comprehensive directions and
systematic guidelines were developed for facilitators to ensure the consistent conduct of
the modules. It also contains all the training resources that can be used by trainers. Each
module was structured in the same way, including the aim, learning objectives, required
material according to the list of activities, and notes to aid facilitators in communicating
the content and minimize facilitator variances.

2.1.3. Phase III: Validation of the Intervention

To validate the appropriateness and relevance of the intervention, a panel of profes-
sional mental health experts was assembled. Our expert panel included two mental health
nurses, two psychiatrists, two psychologists, and two maternal and child health experts.
The selection of these eight content experts was performed deliberately to capture diverse
feedback based on their different specializations [47].

Based on a thorough review of the literature [48–53], a 15-item checklist was developed,
which included four items on Content and Resource Material, two items for Illustrations,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5517

5 of 16

and three items each on Scientiﬁc Accuracy, Legibility and Printing Characteristics, and
Literary Presentation. The checklist was given to the eight experts to rate each module on a
scale of 1 for “strongly disagree”; 2 for “disagree”; 3 for “agree”; and 4 for “strongly agree”.
The content validity index (CVI), which is the most widely utilized method for content
validation, was calculated using the following formula: I-CVI = (agreed item)/(number
of experts), and S-CVI/Ave = (sum of I-CVI scores)/(number of items). The CVI ranges
from 0 to 1, representing the measure of agreement between experts. A CVI value > 0.83 is
considered acceptable [54].

To learn more about the areas that require further improvement, two open-ended
questions were added to the checklist. The experts, who agreed to take part, were sent
a Google Drive link with all the necessary materials via email. These resources included
their consent and a brief description of the project, a Google Form link with a checklist for
the content’s relevance and clarity, a SM-ART intervention, and a Voiceover PowerPoint
presentation (VOPP) to help participants understand the intervention more thoroughly.
The participants were invited to share their feedback within 4 weeks.

3. Results
3.1. Phase I: Need Assessment

Seventeen pregnant women from diverse socio-economic backgrounds were enrolled.
Six themes emerged from their in-depth interviews as a part of the SM-ART intervention.
These include: Finding the Purpose in life; Dealing with Emotions; Believing in Yourself;
Adapting an Optimistic Approach; Strengthening Support Systems and Relationships;
and Internalizing Spirituality and Humanity. Details about themes, the content of the
intervention, and the socio-demographic characteristics of these participants are published
in another paper on this project [45].

A total of eight KIs (four mental health nurses, two psychologists, and two psychia-
trists) were interviewed. The mean age of KIs was 36.37 years (SD ± 6.72). Fifty percent of
the KIs were literate up to the master’s level, and the remaining had either a bachelor’s
(25%) or doctorate (25%) level education. They had an average of ten years of work ex-
perience, with a range of 6–18 years. Notably, all KIs were female, with 62.5% married,
25% single, and 12.5% divorced. The majority of the KIs were employed in the private
sector (62.5%). Findings from the KIs interviews were congruent with those of the pregnant
women in terms of intervention content like coping strategies, optimism, interpersonal
communication skills, social support, emotional regulation, self-awareness, self-worth, rela-
tionship management, sense of humor, and hope. They also included spirituality, helping
and supporting others, and self-reﬂection.

Regarding the acceptance of the intervention, all participants recommended that it be
carried out in a casual, participative, and relaxed setting to promote the greatest possible
interaction and involvement between participants and the facilitator. Some also express
their lack of desire to pursue further education, having been removed from the university
environment. Most of them expressed a preference for group training. Several potential
barriers to the intervention were highlighted relating to Pakistani culture, including getting
family approval (from husbands and in-laws); managing household duties and childrearing
to make time for sessions; transportation costs for commuting; and ﬁnding childcare.
However, they also provided some alternatives, suggesting that if childcare, food, and
transportation were provided, more people might be persuaded to attend sessions.

3.2. Phase II and III: Development and Validation

The in-depth interviews with participants resulted in six themes that became the basis
of our intervention development. Results from the pregnant women’s interviews were
published earlier [45].

The SM-ART intervention takes the form of a booklet with front and back covers, a
table of contents, descriptions of activities for each module, and the facilitator’s resources.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5517

A signiﬁcant effort went into the design of the cover page, ﬁrst page, and last page of the
intervention (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. (a) The cover page of SMART Intervention; (b) The ﬁrst page of SM-ART intervention;
(c) The last page of SM-ART intervention.

All images were drawn by hand by a hired illustrator with public health nursing
experience. On the ﬁrst page, the pregnant woman holding an umbrella symbolizes how
SM-ART training can assist women in coping with all types of hardships and extreme
weather, and on the last page, it shows how, after six weeks of training, the entire house or
family can be empowered with resilience through one woman’s education. The facilitator’s
guide provides direction for the conduct of the exercises as well as potential responses to
discussion questions after each activity. The intervention was designed to be delivered in a
group setting to give participants a relatively secure and safe space in which they could
learn about and discuss the concepts, express their thoughts and experiences, and give and
receive support from one another. Each module was delivered once a week with a duration
of 60 to 90 min and an overall of 8.5 h in total. This was based on the needs assessment,
which showed participants preferred weekly sessions that lasted no longer than 1.5 to
2 h. Each module is unique in its purpose, distinct from the others, and can stand alone.
Two activities are shared across all modules: (1) the meet and greet period with a mood
assessment that was expressed using emoji stickers (excited, happy, confused, sad, and
anxious) before and after each module; and (2) module evaluation at the conclusion of
the session.

Table 1 provides an overview of the module theme, purpose, objectives, activities, and
time duration of each module of the SM-ART intervention, while Table 2 details each of the
activities targeted to achieve these module objectives.

Two or three rounds of GFI were conducted for each module. In the ﬁrst round,
modules with a GFI greater than 13 were targeted. The index of individual sentences was
calculated, and speciﬁc words were changed in the sentences. These changes were then
applied to the full transcript of the page. In the second round, changes within the transcript
were made rather than targeting individual sentences. Recurring words were changed to
synonyms that were simpler to understand or removed if unnecessary. Trial two decreased
the index to around seven or eight; if this was not achieved, a third round was conducted.
This round included revisiting the transcript and determining if sentences or phrases could
be shortened without losing their meaning. The index calculations after the ﬁnal trial varied
between modules, with the highest index being nine and the lowest index being seven
(Table 3).

Out of the 12 content experts who were approached, eight of them participated in
the validation of the SM-ART intervention. The mean age of participants was 42.5 years
(SD ± 4.98), with a range of 36 to 53 years. Most of the experts held a doctorate (62.5%),
and the rest had a master’s degree (37.5%). There were six experts from within the country
and one each from Australia and Canada. All were originally from Pakistan and have an
average of 14.5 years (SD ± 7.2) of working experience in Pakistan (range: 5–25). The total
number of years of their ﬁeld experience ranges from 10 to 25, with an average of 17.5 years
(SD ± 5.4). The CVI scores for modules and their components ranged from very high to
perfect (Table 4).

CVI (Content Validity Index): the number of expert panel members who rated the item (index of 3 or 4) divided
by the total number of expert panel members (n = 8); CVI is higher than 0.79, the item is appropriate. If between
0.70 and 0.79, the item needs revision. If the score is less than 0.70, the item is eliminated.

Additionally, thoughts and suggestions regarding the intervention, in general, were
requested from the experts. Amendments were made to some aspects of the evaluation,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5517

such as general formatting and paragraphs, sentence structure, and the proposed duration
of the training module. A limited number of categories were discovered from the two open-
ended questions (strengths and suggestions). The written statements of the experts support
the ﬁndings of intervention strengths.

3.3. Content Expert Feedback
3.3.1. Innovative and Engaging Activities

One of the strengths highlighted by the experts was the module activities. The content
experts felt that the activities that were included were well conceived, engaging, creative,
innovative, and well-connected with the purpose. In the experts’ words: “All are activity
based and seem engaging. It will provide an opportunity to the participants to share their
thoughts and ideas.”. . . “I must appreciate the creativity”. . . “I am very impressed how
activities are articulated”. . . “. . . the activities, simple yet serve the purpose”. . . “All the
activities are aligned to the topic”. . . “Activities are creatively designed”. . . “This module is
very impressive, especially the Grafﬁti wall of coping”.

3.3.2. Contextually and Culturally Relevant

Overall, the experts believed that everything was culturally and contextually relevant
to the population for which the intervention was designed. Responses included: “The
relatability to our local context and different activities which keeps the whole experience
engaging”. . . ”local examples of daily living are best to make it understanding and relat-
able”. . . “Wisely designed module with the cultural norms and values”. . . “Each image/
picture has been carefully drawn while taking in mind Pakistan’s setting and culture”.

3.3.3. Comprehensive Facilitator Guide

The facilitation guide was seen as a valuable asset by some experts. According to them,
the facilitators and trainers should greatly beneﬁt from the instructions and guidelines
offered in each module, as they will help to standardize the intervention. Comments
included. “To prevent errors and ensure consistency, the module includes very speciﬁc
instructions for facilitators” and “It’s great to read the thorough guide, and the facilitators’
notes are very useful in these modules”.

3.3.4. Consideration of Different Learning Styles

The experts appreciated that the authors considered various learning styles when
preparing activities. One expert “loved the combination of activities in each model. I am
sure, this will be useful for all types of learners”, another appreciated “the careful planning
that went into the preparation of the activities. Every type of learning (auditory, visual,
etc.) was considered”.

3.3.5. Formatting and Language

Some of the content experts’ comments focused on the modiﬁcations of language and
overall formatting for better understanding, organization, and clarity. For example: “Possi-
bly, language could be made even simpler” . . . “objectives could be simpliﬁed further for
better understanding”. . . “Font of a poem in Urdu can be changed, for headings, consistent
font size and style should be used”.

3.3.6. Content and Delivery Recommendations

The experts provided some recommendations for the module content and its execution
in the future. Their comments included: “In module 5, connect lizard story with ‘rescue’
fantasy concept”. . . “In the truck of relationship, it can also be interpreted as taking turns
(e.g. driver or passenger) ensure sustaining and strengthening relationships”. . . “In all the
modules, you will need to keep time for feedback”. . . “In ‘Gup shup’ area, you can place a
whiteboard or chart where participants can write (if they can) regarding their immediate

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5517

reaction or feeling”. . . “I would suggest that you should plan to test the effectiveness of
each module”.

4. Discussion

The major outcome of this study was the development and validation of the resilience-
building intervention SM-ART, which was designed for pregnant Pakistani women. To
ensure face, content, and cultural validity, qualitative data were obtained from stakeholders
and pregnant women, while ensuring that this tailored intervention was consistent with
socioeconomic status and the context of the participants’ lives. To be ‘state-of-the-art’, a
formative phase is considered essential—paying attention to stakeholders concerns so that
they can be addressed in the development of the intervention [55]. For example, there are
high levels of illiteracy in Pakistan, so many people are unable to comprehend written
health-related material [56]. Understanding the underlying issues and being mindful of the
limited availability of mental health care for pregnant women, the SM-ART intervention
encompasses rigorously designed modules by creating an Urdu version with simplistic
language to increase the degree of comprehension and address the range of likely occurring
mental health issues with appropriate group and self-care interventions.

Using the GFI increases the rigor of the language content by challenging initial per-
spectives about which phrases and words are generally used and ultimately facilitating
communication skills useful in participants’ daily lives. Gills 2012 [57] advocate this index
as a solution to the accessibility problems of language faced by the public, as it builds
the capacity of a person to ﬁnd access to, contextualize, and comprehend the information
required for making healthcare decisions [57]. Insights from the Gunning Fog process
included the accessibility of storytelling, the removal of unnecessary words, and applica-
tion to daily life. The stories within the modules always had lower and better GFI scores
compared to the instructions or insights because stories often had simple dialogue and
were straight to the point, indicating that they were an accessible form of transmitting
the information.

Additionally, CVI is an important measure for validating the results and assessing the
appropriateness and practicability of the intervention [3,58]. The validation of our SM-ART
modules has good to perfect CVI scores, which is evident from the high applicability and
relevance of this intervention.

In line with the literature, which advocates involving experts at the development
and validation stages, this study involved experts in the needs assessment phase and the
content development, validation, and accuracy. The participation and involvement of
experts at every level contributed to high to perfect CVI scores and increased the relevance
of the content.

The methodology and adaptation based on the suggestions of the reviewers allowed
the module to be improved and tailored to the needs of the target population. Additionally,
SM-ART contains appealing language, eye-catching images, and engaging activities that
may match the reader’s mindset and improve readiness to learn. Research shows that
using a variety of strategies for engaging participation, helps participants stay focused,
understand concepts, have productive debates, and behave properly as a group [59]. An-
other study that looked at adult learners found that there should be more actions than
just listening to engage participants and make them active learners. They must engage
in discussion, debate, writing, problem-solving, and higher-order thinking activities [60].
Another systematic review emphasized that Resilience Training should also involve experi-
ential learning, which may be accomplished through role-playing, demonstration, different
skill-based training, and reﬂection [61]. Our intervention, therefore, attempted to include a
variety of activities to encourage their involvement and commitment.

The essence of SM-ART arises from its cultural relevance to pregnant Pakistani women,
its contextual connection with Pakistani society, and its implications for pregnant women.
Considering the socio-economic structure of Pakistan, SM-ART traverses the everyday
problems faced by pregnant women and how these adversely affect their mental and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5517

12 of 16

physical health. Learning from this, SM-ART creates a set of intuitive and appealing
activities that address the issues these women might face. Research shows that interventions
that are understandable and culturally appropriate, have the best likelihood of being
effective [62].

In addition, the suggested face-to-face approach of the sessions ensures that there is
a high chance of better understanding of knowledge and skills amongst users, and since
the frequency of these sessions is only once per week, it also makes sure that these users
are not being overburdened in an already demanding stage of their lives. Additionally,
doing these sessions in a group may create a sense of community for these women, where
they can meet other women facing similar issues and talk out their concerns. This not only
creates a support group on which these women can rely but also a place where they can
freely express themselves. Studies also found that the most effective preventative measure
against prenatal depression is social support [63,64].

Moreover, addressing the language barrier, running numerous ﬁeld tests with Pak-
istani women from a variety of social backgrounds, and content validation by expert panels
maximize the chances that the SM-ART covers content that is often missed by other sources
available either through television, textbooks, or social media. Studies have shown how
language barriers can be precursors for inequality in perinatal healthcare, especially among
groups of migrant women for whom the native language is a foreign one [65]. Similarly, a
large part of the Pakistani population, speciﬁcally those in Karachi, are migrants with an
array of different cultures and languages. This high diversity meant that it was essential to
use one commonly understood language (i.e., Urdu). Another study conducted in Pakistan
concluded that to maximize the effect of healthcare teachings, it was imperative to keep
into account the social settings and the cultural relevance [66]. Therefore, SM-ART was
developed with a strong emphasis on maintaining its teachings within the cultural aspects
of Pakistan.

The different learning styles adopted by the modules allow users to choose their pre-
ferred way of learning: audio, visual, group, or a mix of these styles. Finally, the facilitator’s
guide offers a platform for instructors to improve their training delivery while establishing
a level of facilitation that is as consistent as possible across the team of instructors. Addition-
ally, this will offer instructions that the general public can utilize to learn to communicate
effectively in their daily lives. The experts concurred that the facilitator guide is necessary
for these sessions and that it was carefully crafted with the facilitators in mind.

Resilience-building interventions already exist for the following populations: cancer
patients [67], school-based adolescents [68], military [69], immigrant children [70], transgen-
der [71], diabetic fatigue patients [72], adolescents with psychiatric symptoms [73], medical
residents [74,75], youth at high risk of HIV [61,76], mothers of cancer patients [77], and
nursing students [78]. However, there are no resilience-based interventions that are aimed
at the perinatal period. The ﬁrst contextual and culturally appropriate intervention for
pregnant women was developed in our study. Moreover, the literature supporting resilience
theory strongly supports the themes of our modules, which offers us some assurance that
we are moving in the direction of positive psychology [68,77–82].

This study is the ﬁrst of its kind to be conducted in Pakistan. The SM-ART interven-
tion is the result of in-depth research, resulting in a contextually and culturally relevant
intervention program. Furthermore, having a panel of experts review the module content
ensured the validity of the prepared intervention by allowing for further iterations and
reﬁnement. The study also provides a basic framework for any future research in this
domain. Moreover, the name Safe Motherhood “ART (Accessible Resilience Training)” may
help diminish the stigma associated with mental illness in this Pakistani context. Further,
the intervention has a training manual for facilitators to add to enhance reliability over
time. In addition, the intervention is also translated into the national language (i.e., Urdu),
so it can be used in any area of Pakistan.

Along with its strengths, this study also has some limitations. Firstly, it has limited
generalizability as it was only conducted focusing on married pregnant women from

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5517

13 of 16

a low socioeconomic background. It can be generalized to a population with similar
characteristics only, with modiﬁcations to the examples and images necessary before it
can be applied to a different population, thereby, enhancing contextual relevance for the
targeted users. Secondly, the involved KIs and experts were all female, which omitted male
perceptions and insights that could be included in future module development.

5. Conclusions

This study marks an important step in the development of the novel resilience-building
intervention, which consists of six theme-based modules. The SM-ART offers a road map
for fostering resilience among pregnant women. A valid resilience-building module can
also provide reference material to guide midwives as facilitators of resilience-building
during the perinatal period. Future testing in a rigorously controlled research study is
necessary to further test the impact of SM-ART as a whole or as a separate module on
building resilience, coping, self-worth, and the management of anxiety and depression in
local pregnant women. In a healthcare landscape where access to quality mental health
care is difﬁcult, if not impossible, this self-care approach is hypothesized to be not only
empowering but also effective.
