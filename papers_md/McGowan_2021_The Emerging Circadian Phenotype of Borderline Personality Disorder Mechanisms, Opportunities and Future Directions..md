Abstract
Purpose of Review We review the recent evidence suggesting that circadian rhythm disturbance is a common unaddressed
feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD); amelioration of which may confer substantial clinical benefit. We assess
chronobiological BPD studies from a mechanistic and translational perspective and highlight opportunities for the future devel-
opment of this hypothesis.
Recent Findings The emerging circadian phenotype of BPD is characterised by a preponderance of comorbid circadian rhythm
sleep-wake disorders, phase delayed and misaligned rest-activity patterns and attenuated amplitudes of usually well-characterised
circadian rhythms. Such disturbances may exacerbate symptom severity, and specific maladaptive personality dimensions may
produce a liability towards extremes in chronotype. Pilot studies suggest intervention may be beneficial, but development is limited.
Summary Endogenous and exogenous circadian rhythm disturbances appear to be common in BPD. The interface between
psychiatry and chronobiology has led previously to novel efficacious strategies for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. We
believe that better characterisation of the circadian phenotype in BPD will lead to a directed biological target for treatment in a
condition where there is a regrettable paucity of accessible therapies.

Introduction

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychiatric
disorder characterised by persistent mood instability, im-
pulsivity, identity disturbance and interpersonal dysfunc-
tion. Among clinical populations BPD is the most com-
monly diagnosed personality disorder affecting 10% of
psychiatric outpatients and between 15-25% of inpa-
tients [1]. Functional impairment is substantial, involv-
ing turbulent interpersonal relationships, poor psychoso-
cial and occupational outcomes [2, 3] and reckless and

potentially dangerous behaviours (e.g. substance abuse)
[4]. Recurrent self-harm and suicidality are core symp-
toms, with up to 10% of individuals with BPD dying by
suicide [4]. Treatments for BPD are limited. There are
no medications specifically licenced for its treatment
[5]. Long-term psychotherapies are efficacious [6], but
not consistently available [7]. The biological phenotype
of BPD has been largely neglected, hindering the inno-
vation of novel translational interventions.

Sleep disturbance and insomnia are common in BPD
[8(cid:129)(cid:129)] but are under-appreciated compared to mood disor-
ders where they form part of the diagnostic criteria.
Consequently, the specific sleep complaints of people
with BPD are often overlooked and thus untreated [9].
An important process governing sleep that remains
under-investigated in BPD is that of the circadian clock.
Circadian rhythms are 24-h physiological oscillations that
sustain a temporal architecture of sleep/wake behaviour
[10]. Circadian rhythm disturbances in behavioural and
endocrine measures are implicated in the pathophysiology
of several psychiatric disorders and are appreciated clini-
cally as a driver of sleep disturbance [11–13]. Moreover,

dimensional traits that also constitute core symptoms of
BPD, such as mood instability and impulsivity, are asso-
ciated with disturbance of circadian rest-activity patterns
[14, 15]. A role for altered circadian rhythm function has
been proposed in BPD [16(cid:129)], but to date, this hypothesis
has not been elaborated further.

In this review, we apply a chronobiological perspective to
the extant BPD sleep literature and review recent studies that
specifically examine circadian rhythm function. First, we pro-
vide a brief primer on the circadian timing system for a general
psychiatry audience. We examine the literature supporting the
presence of physiologic circadian rhythm abnormalities in
BPD, which consists of studies addressing comorbid circadian
rhythm sleep-wake disorders, actigraphy monitoring, heart-
rate variability and endocrine measures and a small evidence
base supporting chronotherapy for BPD. Given recent calls to
articulate borderline pathophysiology dimensionally, we also
discuss the association between chronotype and personality
traits and the implication this raises for future BPD studies.
Finally, we offer recommendations for future research devel-
opment and clinical practice.

The Circadian System

Circadian Entrainment and Circadian Rhythm Sleep
Wake Disorders

A schematic overview of circadian clock function is presented
in Fig. 1 and a glossary of circadian terminology from this
section (italicised terms in text) is presented in the
‘Supplementary Information’ section. The circadian system
comprises a network of endogenously oscillating 24-h
rhythms known as circadian rhythms that operate across mul-
tiple physiological and behavioural domains [18]. This system
consists of multiple autonomous and self-sustaining oscilla-
tors throughout the brain and periphery. Hierarchical control
over the circadian network is exerted by the central circadian
pacemaker or ‘master clock’ in the suprachiasmatic nuclei
(SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus [19]. The master clock
aligns the phase of peripheral oscillators to a stable phase
throughout the body, establishing a coordinated internal day
of the circadian clock. Phase and amplitude are primary char-
acteristics of the circadian rhythm. Phase measures the timing
of the peak (or trough) of a circadian rhythm relative to a fixed
event and is used to situate the rhythm within local time (or
relative to sunrise, bedtime, etc.). Amplitude measures the dif-
ference between peak and trough, and thus quantifies the
strength of the circadian output signal.

Entrainment is the process by which the circadian system
synchronises its internal day relative to that of the environ-
ment [20]. Environmental agents that synchronise the circadi-
an system are called zeitgebers. In absence of a zeitgeber

signal, the internal day of the circadian clock oscillates with
an intrinsic period that is close to, but deviates slightly from,
24-h; a condition known as free-running. Thus, in order to
confer a functional advantage of anticipating environmental
change, the circadian system establishes a stable phase rela-
tion or ‘phase of entrainment’ with the environment. Light is
the predominant zeitgeber of the human circadian clock [21].
Several qualities of the light/dark cycle determine the expres-
sion of circadian rhythms such as the intensity, duration of
exposure and time of day of exposure. The output circadian
parameter signal may undergo modification of its amplitude
(suppression/enhancement) and/or shift its phase (resulting in
phase delay or phase advance).

According to the two-process model of sleep regulation,
circadian rhythms interact with homeostatic factors to in-
fluence sleep onset time and consolidate a continuous sleep
episode [10]. Sleep pressure (homeostatic process) accu-
mulates during wake but is counterbalanced during the
day by the circadian process, which exerts an opposing
wake-promoting signal. Due to the circadian drive being
rhythmic, this wake-promoting signal diminishes in the
late evening, a time when homeostatic drive is also high,
and in doing so facilitates sleep. Sleep promoting circadian
signals involve rhythmic oscillations in core body temper-
ature (CBT), autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity
and endocrine rhythms (e.g. cortisol and melatonin) [22,
23], all of which are parameters that exhibit robust circa-
dian rhythmicity even when free-running.

Recurrent abnormal phase relations between the circadian
clock and the light/dark cycle produce a misalignment be-
tween sleep times and societal and physical 24-h schedules,
extremes of which give rise to Circadian Rhythm Sleep Wake
Disorders (CRSWDs) [24]. Advanced Sleep Wake Phase
Disorder (ASWPD) and Delayed Sleep Wake Phase
Disorder (DSWPD) refer to abnormally early and late timing
of the sleep-wake interval relative to the socially desirable
pattern, respectively. Individuals with DSWPD present with
chronic sleep-onset insomnia and difficulty waking in the
morning, resulting in excessive day-time sleepiness and
educational/occupational impairment [25]. Conversely, indi-
viduals with ASWPD experience sleepiness in the late
afternoon/early evening interfering with social activities, and
may experience early-morning awakening insomnia or sleep-
maintenance insomnia [25]. Non-24-h sleep-wake disorder
(N24SWD) is a condition where a person is unable to entrain
their circadian clock to the 24-h light/dark cycle; instead, the
clock runs at its intrinsic period, which is typically longer than
24-h [26]. This results in a circadian pattern of sleep/wake
scheduling that progressively and perpetually delays
each day. N24SWD usually emerges through compro-
mised retinohypothalamic signalling to the SCN and is
common in blind people, but assumed very rare in
sighted individuals [26, 27].

Fig. 1 Schematic of the circadian timekeeping system. The circadian
time-keeping system is governed by the central clock of the SCN.
Efferent SCN signals (blue) coordinate time-keeping among other circa-
dian oscillators in the brain and peripheral organs, establishing a stable
phase relation between endogenous circadian oscillators. This network
generates an internally stable 24 h cycle that represents the internal day of
the circadian system. Circadian signals used to determine the phase of the
circadian clock involve robustly oscillating rhythms in core body temper-
ature (CBT), inter-beat interval heart-rate variability (HRV) and plasma
melatonin and cortisol. To impart a functional advantage of anticipating
time related changes in the environment, the circadian clock is entrained
to the external light-dark cycle which serves as the primary zeitgeber to
the circadian clock. Retinal photic zeitgeber input signals (red) are trans-
duced to the SCN via a dedicated non-visual circuit known as the
retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Hence, through entrainment, the SCN

synchronises its period to that of the 24 h day. Interaction between the
24 h period of the external day (T) and that of the endogenous internal day
(tau) generates the circadian phase of entrainment (ψ). The phase range at
which the internal day coalesces with the external 24 h day gives rise to
different ψ expressed as earlier or later chronotypes. Chronotype assessed
via the midsleep time displays an approximately normal distribution in
the population and is a trait that influences behavioural routines of rest
and activity. Manipulation of zeitgeber exposure can produce phase shifts
in ψ. Early morning exposure to bright light produces a phase advance of
the circadian clock, whereas evening exposure produces a phase delay of
the circadian clock. Using agents that adjust the phase of the circadian
clock is the basis of chronotherapy. Endocrine and temperature reference
ranges shown in figure are adapted from Hickie et al. [17] or based on
laboratory estimates. RMSSD ranges are based on ambulatory ECG
recordings

Assessment of Circadian Rhythms

The activity of the circadian clock of the SCN cannot be ob-
served directly in humans but its phase and amplitude can be
assessed through strongly endogenous circadian rhythms such
as are present in CBT and secretion of melatonin and cortisol
[28]. Controlled laboratory studies involving constant routine
or forced desynchrony protocols are used to observe circadian
rhythms in absence of sleep and environmental masking, but
are not common in psychiatric populations. Moreover, in situ

monitoring is desirable in order to capture circadian processes
that pertain to the ecological experience of psychiatric disor-
der. Several non-invasive and ambulatory methods facilitate
assessment in a normal day-to-day environment. Dim-light
melatonin onset (DLMO) is the gold standard metric for de-
termining the phase of the circadian clock and can be derived
from saliva samples obtained from home at regular intervals
under dim-light conditions [29]. Physiologic circadian
rhythms can also be observed in cortisol secretion, and passive
ambulatory methods such as distal/proximal temperature

rhythms, and ANS activity assessed via 24-h ECG [28, 30,
31]. Furthermore, these measures can also be used to reflect
the amplitude of the circadian rhythm, which melatonin pro-
files derived using the DLMO method do not capture.

Circadian rest-activity patterns can be monitored using
actigraphy, which is a method widely used in psychiatry
research where continuous monitoring of other circadian
biomarkers may be prohibitive. A clear advantage of this
method is assessment over multiple days, allowing longitu-
dinal monitoring and parallel estimation of sleep [32]. The
circadian phase of entrainment can be estimated using
actigraph assessed acrophase, midsleep time or non-
parametric circadian rhythm parameters [32, 33]. However,
these methods are also susceptible to masking effects where
activity that is used to infer properties of the underlying
circadian rhythm is partially confounded by non-circadian
phenomena (e.g. socially enforced schedules, abnormally
high or low activity levels, device removal). Despite this
caveat, actigraphy provides a useful objective estimate of
circadian rhythm function where laboratory routines that
examine endogenous clock parameters and eliminate
masking effects are unavailable. Study design factors
such as appropriate sampling and the use of simulta-
neous sleep dairies and device removal
logs can im-
prove the quality of actigraphy data.

Perhaps the most straightforward instantiation of the circa-
dian phenotype is the emergence of circadian typologies or
chronotypes, a trait reflecting either diurnal preference or self-
selected sleep scheduling that is used to estimate the time of
entrained circadian phase [20, 34]. Chronotype is a dimen-
sional trait ranging from morningness to eveningness, alterna-
tively measured by early to late midsleep time. Chronotyping
of individuals can be achieved quickly via questionnaires that
enquire about daily habits and sleep. Instruments such as the
Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) [35] and
Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) [36] are both
self-reported methods for assessing chronotype that are vali-
dated against sleep diary data and objective measures of the
circadian phase.

Circadian Rhythm Disturbance in Borderline
Personality Disorder

Several lines of evidence from sleep studies suggest that circa-
dian rhythm disturbance is a likely contributor to sleep distur-
bance in BPD. The most recent meta-analytic review of sleep
findings in BPD identifies 32 studies [8(cid:129)(cid:129)]. The most common-
ly employed method of objectively monitoring sleep in these
studies was polysomnography (PSG) with 14 studies published
since 1980. Overall, these reviewed findings indicate that sleep
disturbance in BPD is characterised by longer sleep onset la-
tency, reduced total sleep time and poor sleep efficiency. Self-

reported sleep characteristics using questionnaire instruments
also highlight sleep onset latency as a key problem [37–39].
Qualitative examination of BPD experiences reveals com-
plaints of unstructured sleep patterns, and difficulty maintain-
ing a stable sleep-wake routine with associated distress and
occupational impairment [9]. The character of sleep distur-
bance is BPD is concordant with that of circadian phase delay
(i.e. the nature of insomnia applies to sleep initiation rather than
maintenance). Recently, Fitzpatrick et al. elaborated on these
findings using the MEQ to assess chronotype [40(cid:129)]. In addition
to describing greater insomnia severity in BPD compared to
healthy controls, their study found greater trait eveningness in
BPD compared to healthy controls and clinical controls (gen-
eralised anxiety disorder). Controlling for depressive symp-
toms and medication use suggested that chronotype differences
in BPD may also depend on symptom severity.

People with BPD may have a higher risk of being diagnosed
with a CRSWD. Dagan et al. reported in two studies a higher
prevalence of DSWPD among individuals with personality dis-
order (including borderline) and vice versa [41, 42]. Early clin-
ical reports describing sighted N24SWD cases have implicated
borderline and schizoid psychopathology with the disorder [43,
44]. Reciprocally, individuals with DSWPD and N24SWD ex-
hibit personality traits concordant with borderline personality
features [45, 46]. We are unaware of any reported association
between ASWPD and BPD. Mechanistic understanding of
how CRSWDs might relate to personality disorders is not yet
elucidated. Poor entrainment to social zeitgebers, irregular
work schedules or unemployment might contribute to
DSWPD risk in BPD. For example, shift-work and unemploy-
ment may impact the clock by producing a recurring state of
circadian misalignment and insufficient/mistimed zeitgeber ex-
posure. Similarly, while the character and pathogenic mecha-
nisms of N24SWD in sighted individuals remain poorly under-
stood, social withdrawal and personality disorder are
hypothesised pre-morbid factors [47, 48]. Accordingly, a
disrupted sleep phenotype in BPD that is consistent with
CRSWD may be overlooked by clinicians, considered second-
ary to personality disorder psychopathology and social/
functional impairment.

Cross-sectional studies directly monitoring circadian
rhythms in BPD are limited in number. Verkes et al. were
the first to describe abnormal rest-activity rhythms in a sample
of majority BPD patients recruited from emergency depart-
ment admissions [49]. Periodogram analysis of actigraphy
data obtained over 5–7 consecutive days revealed a periodic-
ity divergent from 24-h in almost two-thirds of participants.
Non-24 h period was associated with worse borderline symp-
toms, suicidal ideation and disinhibition. Non-24 h activity
periods are unusual outside of N24SWD, and in the case of
normal day-to-day actigraphy assessment probably reflect be-
tween day variability of rest-activity timing rather than an
abnormal rhythmic component per se [15]. Indeed, parallel

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2021) 23: 30

sleep diary results found that improvement in bedtime regu-
larity was associated with symptom improvement [49].

Huynh et al. examined actigraph patterns in an adolescent
sample comprised of BPD and bipolar disorder (BD) [50(cid:129)].
Data were obtained over 9 consecutive days, containing two
weekends to capture free-day versus school/work-day differ-
ences in behaviour. Overall, BPD participants exhibited more
variable night-to-night sleep times compared to healthy con-
trols. On free-days, BPD participants spent more time in bed
and had a rise time over an hour later than controls. These
findings suggest compensatory oversleeping on free-days
consistent with social jetlag; a phenomenon that arises as a
function of circadian rhythm misalignment with societal
schedules [51]. However, given that the circadian clock is
phase delayed during adolescence and social jetlag is more
pronounced during school-age, caution is necessary when ex-
trapolating these findings to adults. BPD is also not routinely
diagnosed during adolescence.

One of the longest consecutive actigraphy assessment pe-
riods recorded in BPD was obtained during the Automated
Monitoring of Symptom Severity (AMoSS) study [52].
BPD, BD and healthy control groups were monitored using
actigraphy for 28 days. BPD participants exhibited phase de-
layed rest patterns over 1:30 h later than BD and HC, and
phase delayed daytime activity patterns over 2 h later than
HC [53(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Cosinor analysis of distal skin temperature
reflected similar delayed patterns in BPD. Furthermore, symp-
tom severity in BPD was strongly associated with circadian
rhythm disturbance [54(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Impulsivity correlated with lower
circadian rhythm amplitude and interdaily stability. Mood in-
stability was associated with later activity onset, lower rhythm
stability and amplitude, and greater rhythm fragmentation.
Notably, mood instability in this study was derived from pro-
spectively reported mood ratings collected for up to 12 months
after initial actigraphy recording. Thus, unresolved circa-
dian disturbance may be a predictor of enduring symp-
tom severity. Due to the observational nature of these
data, experimental studies are necessary to determine a
causal relation between sleep/circadian disturbance and
worsened symptom severity in BPD.

An earlier report on a sub-sample of AMoSS participants
examined circadian patterns of heart-rate (HR) and activity
over a 4 day assessment period using torso mounted holter-
like devices containing accelerometer sensors [55(cid:129)]. Cosinor
acrophase of HR, total motor acceleration and vertical accel-
eration (estimating sleep) revealed desynchrony between HR
and activity/sleep in BPD that was greater than BD and absent
in controls. These findings suggest internal desynchrony be-
tween circadian oscillators in BPD, over and above BD.
Moreover, in BPD, mood instability was associated with daily
acrophase variability in HR, activity and sleep [56].
Limitations of this approach involve the sampling frequency;
inter-beat intervals could not be assessed, and thus, standard

time and frequency domain measures of heart-rate variability
(HRV) could not be ascertained. Previous studies have exam-
ined HRV via ECG in BPD as a measure of ANS activity, but
these have focused on short-term resting state recordings [57].
We are aware of only one study that examined 24-h ambula-
tory ECG in BPD [58]. However, to date, no studies have
quantified the circadian rhythm of HRV in BPD.

A number of studies in BPD have examined endocrine
parameters, which suggest circadian rhythm abnormality.
Rausch et al. and Lieb et al. describe elevated salivary cortisol
awakening response (CAR) in female BPD patients [59, 60].
The latter study also demonstrated diurnal elevation until the
evening. Wingenfeld et al. report elevated overnight urinary
free cortisol in BPD compared to controls [61]. Jogems-
Kosterman et al. describe lower morning-to-evening salivary
cortisol ratio in BPD compared to controls [62]. These find-
ings suggest greater amplitude of cortisol secretion in re-
sponse to awakening, and an attenuated 24-h rhythm in the
context of elevated diurnal and nocturnal secretion. However,
CAR and 24-h cortisol levels are not unambiguous measures
of circadian phase or amplitude. The underlying circadian
rhythm of cortisol is masked by an ultradian pulsatile secretion
pattern that is likely activated further in individuals with alter-
ations in hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis function, as in
BPD. The aforementioned cortisol pattern findings may be
gender specific (female) and importantly have been shown
in medication-free volunteers and controlling for comorbid
depression and trauma [59(cid:129)].

We are aware of only one study that examined melatonin
circadian phase in BPD. Bromundt et al. examined melatonin
secretion via consecutive saliva sampling during waking
hours in a small sample of women (14 BPD compared with
10 healthy controls) [63(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Melatonin onset time and the
phase angle between melatonin onset and bedtime did not
differ between groups. Non-parametric indicators of cir-
cadian rest-activity function assessed through parallel 3-
week actigraph monitoring also showed no differences.
As far as we know, no studies have used DLMO as a
circadian phase marker in BPD.

Two studies have examined bright light therapy (BLT) in
BPD, a treatment modality targeting circadian rhythm func-
tion. The aforementioned Bromundt et al. study used a 3-week
cross-over design treatment of morning 8000 lx for 30–40 min
daily [63(cid:129)(cid:129)]. BLT led to earlier rise-time, shorter sleep dura-
tion and increased nocturnal proximal skin temperature (a cir-
cadian measure of vasodilation indexing preparedness for
sleep). Daytime alertness and symptoms of atypical depres-
sion also improved with treatment. Prasko et al. examined 13
treatment resistant BPD patients with comorbid depression
using BLT to augment antidepressant treatment [64(cid:129)]. The
treatment consisted of 6-week application of 1-h morning
10,000 lx BLT added to SSRI treatment. Symptoms of depres-
sion and anxiety improved with treatment. However, no

30    Page 6 of 11

measures of sleep or circadian function were employed. To
date, there has been no randomised controlled trial of BLT or
any other chronotherapeutic or sleep intervention in BPD.

Dimensional Models of Borderline
Personality, Symptoms and Chronotype

The diagnosis of BPD is a categorical one made if five or more
of nine behavioural criteria are present [65]. This variety of
potential combinations contributes to variability in symptom
aetiology, clinical course, and treatment response. That a cat-
egorical system may not be optimal for researching or diag-
nosing personality disorder is a long-standing issue in psychi-
atry [66]. Personality pathology can also be characterised di-
mensionally on a continuum, and the majority of the individ-
ual diagnostic criteria have been shown to be continuously
distributed [67]. The move towards dimensional over categor-
ical approaches to personality disorder classification is
reflected in the hybrid dimensional-categorical model includ-
ed for further study in DSM-5 and the dimensional approach
taken in ICD-11. These developments have implications for
how circadian rhythm differences may be expressed in BPD
and their meaning with respect to symptom severity and man-
agement. Evidence from personality studies in the field of
chronobiology suggest an association between circadian clock
function and traits that predominate in BPD.

Normative personality traits reflected in the five-
factor model of personality (FFM) are among the most
widely validated psychological phenotypes [68] and
have been suggested as analogous dimensions in the
study of maladaptive personality traits [69]. Meta-
analytic studies of FFM traits in personality disorders
highlight that BPD is characterised by high neuroticism,
low agreeableness and low conscientiousness, resem-
bling closely core symptoms of mood instability, inter-
personal dysfunction and impulsivity, respectively [70,
71]. The overlap between these associations with de-
layed phase of entrainment suggested by chronotype
studies is substantial. Two meta-analytic reviews con-
clude broadly similar
findings. Later chronotype/
eveningness is associated with low conscientiousness
and low agreeableness [72, 73(cid:129)]. Furthermore, when
morningness is considered a separate dimension on the
MEQ (reflecting advanced phase of entrainment), a neg-
ative association with neuroticism emerges [73(cid:129)].

Cloninger’s Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI)
[74] is an alternative personality model also commonly used
in both BPD and chronobiology research. The TCI assesses
four temperament dimensions (novelty seeking, harm avoid-
ance, reward dependence and persistence) and three character
dimensions (self-directedness, cooperativeness and self-tran-
scendence). In BPD, temperament dimensions emphasise

increased harm avoidance, increased novelty seeking and de-
creased reward dependence, and character dimensions empha-
sise decreased self-directedness and decreased cooperative-
ness, reflecting the clinical impression of the disorder [75,
76]. Chronotype studies indicate that eveningness is positively
associated with novelty seeking with mixed findings for harm
avoidance [77–81]. Furthermore, character findings suggest
that eveningness is negatively associated with self-directed-
ness, cooperation and persistence [77, 79–81].

In healthy populations, symptoms of BPD such as mood
instability and impulsivity are both associated with circadian
rest-activity pattern disturbance [14, 15]. Eveningness/later
chronotype is also a predictor of core BPD symptoms such
as dissociative experiences [82], impulsivity [83], anger [84]
and suicidal ideation [85]. Hypothesised mechanisms for
these relations involve incompatibility between societal de-
mands and chronotype (i.e. social jetlag) and the resultant
detriment to sleep. However, there are no studies investigating
chronotype and symptom dimensions in BPD and it is not
clear how well findings from healthy participants can be ex-
trapolated to BPD. Future chronotype and multimodal circa-
dian phenotyping studies are needed in BPD with a focus on
interrogating its polythetic personality and symptom domains.

Future Research Opportunities and Clinical
Recommendations

The studies reviewed here indicate that circadian rhythm dis-
turbance may be an important unmet treatment need for people
with BPD and a factor that likely exacerbates the core symp-
toms of the disorder. It is our view that there is an unexploited
opportunity to characterise and therapeutically address circadi-
an rhythm disturbance in BPD, and that doing so may produce
significant benefits for those with the diagnosis. We predict that
interventions that stabilise circadian rhythm function in BPD
will confer benefit for its treatment, particularly in those that
exhibit delayed and disrupted sleep patterns. Studies examining
the circadian phenotype in unipolar depression and bipolar dis-
order have demonstrated that circadian rhythm disturbances are
a cardinal feature of the chronic sleep disturbance in both dis-
orders [17, 86]. Accordingly, chronotherapeutic interventions
(such as BLT) and therapies designed to stabilise 24-h behav-
ioural patterns (such as interpersonal and social rhythm thera-
py; IPSRT) have been deployed successfully for the treatment
of both [17, 87, 88]. Circadian rhythm treatment represents a
future directed biological target for intervention in BPD. In
contrast to the prolonged nature of psychotherapeutic ap-
proaches, chronotherapeutic treatment response is achievable
within weeks, and interventions are scalable and can be mod-
ified to be delivered remotely. Adjunctive to recommended
psychotherapies, chronotherapeutic treatments may widen the
treatment options that are available to people with BPD.

Technological advances over the past decade have resulted
in enthusiastic support for digital phenotyping in psychiatry;
that is in situ monitoring and momentary quantification of
individual-level phenotypes from smartphones and personal
digital devices [89]. Behavioural circadian patterns are an ad-
ditional target for future digital phenotyping studies and may
be passively monitored using moment-to-moment digital de-
vice signals akin to actigraphy use in the field of chronobiol-
ogy. Examining the impact of circadian rhythm disturbance
and misaligned phase on symptom course, decompensation
risk and impending crisis presents a novel opportunity for
digital phenotyping studies in BPD.

There is also a yet unexplored opportunity to examine the
association between dimensions of maladaptive personality
and circadian phenotypes, notably chronotype, as has been
richly described in the case of normative personality traits.
Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorder [65] pro-
poses a five factor dimensional maladaptive personality trait
system that should be used in future studies. We suggest that
future studies use a dimensional framework for understanding
the impact of circadian rhythm disturbance upon BPD psy-
chopathology. Based on the presentation of BPD and previous
chronotype studies among clinical and general populations, it
seems likely that domains such as negative affect and disinhi-
bition are more severely impacted by circadian rhythm distur-
bance than symptoms involving complex interpersonal inter-
actions. Delineation of susceptible features is necessary to
innovate targeted approaches for symptom management.

We propose recommendations for future research of circa-
dian clock function in BPD (Table 1) and highlight some
clinical recommendations (Table 2). There is preliminary ev-
idence of association between circadian rhythm disturbance
and BPD diagnosis and psychopathology. However, this topic
needs greater research attention and the causal direction of this
relationship has yet to be determined. Future experimental and
longitudinal work is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms

Table 1

Future research recommendations

(cid:129) Obtain circadian parameters beyond actigraphy in BPD, focusing

explicitly on physiologic markers of circadian phase and especially
DLMO

(cid:129) Design experimental medicine chronotherapy studies to examine causal

hypotheses and provide clinical pilot data for future trials

(cid:129) Determine the course of BPD symptomatology and how it relates to
circadian rhythm disturbance via longitudinal ecological momentary
assessment studies

(cid:129) Delineate symptom features and dimensional pathological personality
traits that are adversely affected by circadian rhythm disturbance in
BPD

(cid:129) Sleep studies should at a minimum employ parallel measures of

chronotype to capture information about the phase of sleep/wake
patterns in BPD

Table 2 Clinical recommendations

(cid:129) Sleep should be routinely assessed in personality disorders and detailed
psychiatric interview should be conducted to screen for comorbid
CRSWDs

(cid:129) Consider sleep disturbance and circadian rhythm misalignment as

perpetuating and exacerbating factors of core borderline symptoms,
especially in the context of occupational and social impairment
(cid:129) Emphasise sleep hygiene and social rhythm stabilisation as strategies

supplementary to treatment as usual

involved and to track the evolution of symptom severity. An
experimental medicine approach will be useful for both estab-
lishing the impact of circadian clock function on core BPD
symptoms and assessing the efficacy of chronotherapeutic in-
terventions in the disorder. Appreciation for a role of circadian
rhythm disturbance in BPD may enable translational therapies
for its treatment as has been demonstrated for bipolar disorder
[88], a condition with considerable symptom overlap.
Feasibility studies in BPD have demonstrated that BLT may
be a promising therapeutic avenue [63, 64] that should be
further interrogated in a randomised controlled manner.

Fundamental questions concerning the character of circa-
dian function in BPD remain unaddressed. Most studies have
used actigraphy to assess rest-activity rhythms but assessment
of other circadian parameters is required. Endocrine and ANS
activity measures are variables of interest in BPD studies and
express a circadian rhythm that should be examined explicitly.
Chronobiological studies have established the DLMO phase
of the circadian clock in other psychiatric disorders but this
has not yet been examined in BPD. As the purported gold
standard marker of clock function, its characterisation will
allow important questions to be clarified involving internal
phase angle coordination and internal day representation that
may be interrupted in BPD.

Clinical practice points should involve routine assessment
of sleep disorder in BPD with a particular focus on CRSWDs
given their preponderance and reciprocal nature. Sleep com-
plaints from people with BPD should not be considered sec-
ondary to core psychopathology. Treatment of sleep distur-
bance and abnormal sleep/wake phase should be explicit and
above usual symptom management for BPD. Until specific
evidence-based chronotherapeutic interventions for BPD be-
come available, sleep hygiene and IPSRT inspired approaches
with psychoeducation regarding appropriate zeitgeber expo-
sure and social rhythm regularity should be emphasised.

Conclusions

There is a growing evidence base suggesting circadian
rhythm dysregulation in BPD. Recent findings indicate that
rest-activity patterns are phase delayed and possibly

30    Page 8 of 11

desynchronised internally from other oscillating autonomic
parameters. Reduced circadian rhythm amplitude and daily
stability of rest-activity and endocrine rhythms have also
recently been reported and these perturbations appear to
be associated with worsened core symptoms of the disor-
der. Chronotype studies in normative samples show consis-
tent associations between later chronotype and traits asso-
ciated with borderline psychopathology but this trend re-
quires further examination in those with a confirmed diag-
nosis of BPD. Taken together, the emerging circadian phe-
notype of BPD suggests a phase delayed clock comporting
with earlier clinical reports that describe a greater preva-
lence of a delayed sleep-wake phase syndrome among peo-
ple with the disorder. However, further development of this
hypothesis is necessary using unambiguous endogenous
measures of the clock function (e.g. DLMO). Better classi-
fication of the circadian rhythm phenotype in BPD will
permit a full characterisation of the impact on patient im-
pairment and enable the development of targeted interven-
tions. Pilot studies find some initial support for BLT but the
feasibility of other chronotherapies is not yet clear.
