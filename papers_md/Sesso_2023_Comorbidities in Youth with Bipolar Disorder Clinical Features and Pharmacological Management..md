Abstract:  Background:  Bipolar  Disorder  (BD)  is  a  highly  comorbid  condition,  and  rates  of  co-
occurring disorders are even higher in youth. Comorbid disorders strongly affect clinical presenta-
tion, natural course, prognosis, and treatment.  

Methods: This review focuses on the clinical and treatment implications of the comorbidity between 
BD and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, disruptive behavior disorders (Oppositional Defi-
ant Disorder and/or Conduct Disorder), alcohol and substance use disorders, Autism Spectrum Dis-
order, anxiety disorders, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and eating disorders.  

Results: These associations define specific conditions which are not simply a sum of different clini-
cal pictures, but occur as distinct and complex combinations with specific developmental pathways 
over  time  and  selective  therapeutic  requirements.  Pharmacological  treatments  can  improve  these 
clinical pictures by addressing the comorbid conditions, though the same treatments may also wors-
en BD by inducing manic or depressive switches.  

Conclusion: The timely identification of BD comorbidities may have relevant clinical implications 
in terms of symptomatology, course, treatment and outcome. Specific studies addressing the phar-
macological  management  of  BD  and  comorbidities  are  still  scarce,  and  information  is  particularly 
lacking  in  children  and  adolescents;  for  this  reason,  the  present  review  also  included  studies  con-
ducted on adult samples. Developmentally-sensitive controlled clinical trials are thus warranted to 
improve  the  prognosis  of  these  highly  complex  patients,  requiring  timely  and  finely  personalized 
therapies.

chotics. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Although  diagnostic  criteria  for  Bipolar  Disorder  (BD) 
provided  by  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental 
Disorders (DSM) can be extended to youth, as indicated in the 
multisite, collaborative study on BD, the Course and Outcome 
of  Bipolar  Illness  in  Youth  (COBY)  [1],  clinical  phenotypes 
and  boundaries  in  youth  are  still  debated,  given  the  possible 
developmentally  different  presentation  of  early-onset  forms, 
compared  to  adult  standards,  including  the  rates  and  patterns 
of comorbidity [2]. Comorbidity, indeed, is the rule rather than 
the  exception  in  early-onset  BD,  particularly  with  Attention-
impulse  control  
Deficit/Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD), 
disorders - including disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) and 
substance use disorders (SUD) - anxiety disorders, Obsessive-
Compulsive  Disorder  (OCD),  Autism  Spectrum  Disorder 
(ASD) and other neurodevelopmental conditions [3-7]. A de-
velopmentally  based  approach  to  comorbidities  may  allow  to

explore the co-occurrence of disorders according to develop-
mental trajectories to bipolarity, using both retrospective and 
prospective study designs [8].  

Furthermore, early-onset impaired regulation of emotion-
al  states,  including  low  threshold,  rapid  increase,  excessive 
intensity,  inappropriate  expression,  and  slow  normalization 
of  emotionality,  resulting  in  mood  lability  and  instability, 
severe  irritability,  low  tolerance  to  frustration,  temper  out-
burst,  and  hyper-arousal,  is  currently  defined  as  Emotional 
Dysregulation [9-11], and is related to the cyclothymic tem-
perament [12]. This condition can be interpreted as a neuro-
developmental disorder of emotion regulation, and a transdi-
agnostic  prodrome  of  different  mental  disorders,  including 
not  only  mood  disorders,  but  also  ADHD  [13,  14],  Opposi-
tional  Defiant  Disorder  (ODD)  and  Conduct  Disorder  (CD) 
[15, 16], anxiety disorders [17, 18], OCD [5, 19], ASD [20, 
21]  and  eating  disorders  (ED)  [22],  resulting  in  individuals 
with  more  complex  and  unstable  clinical  expression,  and 
increased  sensitivity  and  vulnerability  to  environmental  and 
interpersonal stimuli [23].

Among the different comorbidities, we will address here 
seven  partially  overlapping  clinical  conditions,  with  related 
treatment implications: a) BD and ADHD, b) BD and DBD 
including  ODD/CD;  c)  BD  and  SUD;  d)  BD  and  ASD;  e) 
BD and anxiety disorders; f) BD and OCD; g) BD and ED. 
The present review will mainly focus on the pharmacological 
treatments  for  BD  comorbidities.  Several  other  therapeutic 
options, including psychosocial interventions, are also avail-
able, though they will not be extensively discussed here; for 
a review on this topic, the authors may refer to [24-27]. 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

A  narrative  review  of  the  literature  was  conducted.  Due 
to the broad extent of the topic and the wide range of comor-
bid conditions considered in the article, a systematic review 
of the literature was not feasible. Moreover, given the pauci-
ty  of  controlled  studies  available  for  youth  samples,  it  was 
also necessary to take into account relevant adult studies that 
could  help  inform  clinicians  dealing  with  children  and  ado-
lescents.  Studies  were  identified  through  multiple  searches 
on PubMed from date of inception to December 2021. First, 
search  terms  included  ‘bipolar  disorder’  cross-referenced 
with  ‘children’  or  ‘adolescents’,  along  with  the  specific 
comorbid  condition  (e.g.,  ‘ADHD’).  Secondly,  ‘treatment’ 
was added to the search line. Finally, adult studies were re-
trieved including only ‘bipolar disorder’, ‘treatment’, and the 
specific comorbid condition in the search line. Previous sys-
tematic  and  narrative  reviews  were  also  considered  eligible 
for  revision.  Reference  lists  from  all  identified  publications 
were carefully searched for additional relevant studies.  

3.  ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY  DISOR-
DER 

ADHD and BD are highly prevalent conditions that share a 
chronic  course  and  lead  to  significant  impairment  in  educa-
tional, occupational and social functioning [28-30]. They often 
co-occur [30, 31], particularly in the combined presentation of 
ADHD  [32].  Indeed,  several  studies  reported  high  rates  of 
ADHD  comorbidity  in  pediatric  BD,  ranging  from  11%  to 
98%,  with  an  average  rate  of  62%  [33].  At  later  ages,  lower 
but still rather high rates of ADHD have been also reported in 
up  to  23  -  25%  of  clinically  referred  adult  patients  with  BD, 
though  most  studies  consistently  account  for  a  comorbidity 
rate  between  15%  and  20%  [34-36].  Across  the  age  groups, 
ADHD is three times more prevalent among individuals with 
mood disorders compared to individuals without mood disor-
ders, while among people with mood disorders, ADHD is 1.7 
times  more  common  in  people  with  BD  compared  to  people 
with Major Depressive Disorder [37].  

Interestingly, ADHD has been found to increase the risk 
of  transition  from  unipolar  depression  to  BD  [37,  38]  and, 
according  to  a  recent  meta-analysis  of  prospective  studies 
conducted  by  our  group,  more  than  10%  of  ADHD  patients 
are  expected  to  be  later  diagnosed  with  BD  [7].  Even  more 
impressively, a nine-fold increase in the risk to develop BD 
can  be  observed  in  ADHD  patients  compared  with  healthy 
controls  [7].  These  findings  are  consistent  with  the  five-to-
ten-fold increase of risk found in patients with ADHD com-
pared to healthy controls in nation-wide register-based stud-
ies [39,40]. Interestingly, among ADHD patients, emotional 

dysregulation has been found to predict greater rates of sub-
sequent  diagnoses  of  BD,  possibly  representing  a  specific 
manifestation pertaining to the bipolar spectrum in neurode-
velopmental disorders [9].  

Importantly, comorbid ADHD-BD patients exhibit higher 
severity of core ADHD symptoms, greater rates of external-
izing disorders and addictive behaviors, including substance 
abuse, poorer educational functioning, more psychiatric hos-
pitalizations, and higher rates of additional psychopathology 
[32,  35,  41-44].  They  also  show  a  more  severe  and  chronic 
course of mood disorder with shorter euthymic intervals and 
more  frequent  mood  episodes,  higher  rates  of  atypical  and 
mixed depressions, greater affective instability and behavior-
al  impulsivity,  more  non-suicidal  self-injurious  behaviors 
and suicide attempts [45, 46], and an overall reduced quality 
of  life  [44,  47-51].  Finally,  a  younger  age  of  BD  onset  in 
ADHD patients compared to non-ADHD ones, with a mean 
difference  of  approximately  five  years,  is  one  of  the  most 
replicated  findings,  and,  among  ADHD-BD  patients,  more 
than a half showed a pre-adult onset of BD (< 18 years) and 
more than a fourth a pre-pubertal onset (< 12 years) [50, 52].  

Recent genome-wide association studies have implicated 
shared  genetic  factors  across  ADHD  and  BD  suggesting  a 
common genetic vulnerability, though shared environmental 
factors may also contribute to the high rates, including mal-
treatment,  poverty  and  social  adversities  [53].  However,  a 
recent  population-based  study  found  that  there  was  no  evi-
dence  for  cross-transmission  of  BD  and  ADHD  in  first  de-
gree  relatives,  which  may  suggest  that  the  comorbidity  be-
tween ADHD and BD could instead represent a distinct BD 
subtype  with  childhood-onset  symptoms  -  an  “early-onset 
type” of BD [54].  

Despite  the  high  prevalence  of  ADHD-BD  comorbidity 
and  the  particularly  great  severity  of  this  condition  [44], 
there are very few clinical trials addressing pharmacological 
interventions for ADHD in the BD population, the few exist-
ing trials being limited by small sample size and short-term 
follow-up. Since comorbid ADHD in BD is associated with 
negative  outcomes  both  in  children  and  adults  [36,  55],  a 
prompt  and  effective  treatment  is  essential.  Nonetheless, 
ADHD frequently goes untreated in people with mood disor-
ders as it is often misrecognized or underestimated [29]. In-
deed, individuals with comorbid ADHD and mood disorders 
may  not  receive  proper  treatment  for  ADHD  due  to  clini-
cians’ focus on mood symptoms. This is supported by a pre-
vious  investigation  which  found  that  only  9%  of  patients 
with BD and comorbid ADHD had been properly diagnosed 
with  and  received  treatment  for  ADHD  [56].  Furthermore, 
the comorbidity is associated with reduced ADHD treatment 
responsiveness  and  lower  chance  to  recovery  [42],  while 
higher  rates  of  antidepressant-induced  switch,  poorer  re-
sponse  to  mood  stabilizers  and  less  treatment adherence  are 
among  the  major  treatment  challenges  of  the  clinical  man-
agement of these patients [44, 57, 58].  

Preliminary  results  suggest  that  psychostimulants  and 
other  ADHD  medications  may  be  particularly  effective  in 
treating ADHD in people with mood disorders, while future 
research  should  be  aimed  to  explore  different  treatment  op-
tions, as well as acceptability, safety and efficacy of treating 
ADHD  along  with  mood  symptoms  [59].  As  for  the  effec-

tiveness  in  the  adult  population,  the  Canadian  Network  for 
Mood  and  Anxiety  Treatments  (CANMAT)  group  drew  a 
ranking  based  on  levels  of  evidence  and  Methylphenidate 
(MPH)  and  mixed  amphetamine  salts  (MAS)  received,  re-
spectively,  levels  1  and  2  of  evidence  for  the  treatment  of 
ADHD  in  adults  with  comorbid BD.  Level  3  was  attributed 
to  Bupropion  and  Atomoxetine  (ATX),  while  level  4  to 
Modafinil,  Venlafaxine,  Desipramine,  Nortriptyline  and 
Lisdexamphetamine [59].  

In children and adolescents, MPH may be considered as 
an  effective  treatment  for  comorbid  ADHD-BD.  Findings 
from  the  Multimodal  Treatment  Study  of  Children  suggest 
that children with ADHD and BD respond robustly to MPH 
during the first month of treatment without significantly ad-
verse effects [60]. Indeed, ADHD children with manic symp-
toms - identified using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for 
Children or the Child Behavior Checklist as proxies of pedi-
atric  BD  -  showed  an  equivalent  response  to  a  one-month 
MPH titration trial as compared to ADHD peers without BD 
[60].  

Similarly,  pediatric  patients  with  BD  and  concurrent 
ADHD can also be effectively treated with MAS after manic 
symptoms  are  stabilized.  An  8-week  open-label  trial  of  Di-
valproex  Sodium  followed  b-y  a  4-week  randomized,  dou-
ble-blind,  placebo-controlled  crossover  trial  with  MAS  has 
been  conducted  on  30  youths  aged  6  to  17  years  [61].  The 
authors found that, while Divalproex Sodium alone was not 
an effective treatment for ADHD in the context of BD, MAS 
was  instead  significantly  more  effective  than  placebo  for 
ADHD  core  symptoms,  with  no  significant  side  effects  or 
worsening  of  manic  symptoms  [61].  More  recently,  other 
authors,  based  on  case  reports,  proposed  that  ADHD-BD 
may be effectively treated with stimulants - e.g., MAS - even 
without mood-stabilizing agents [62]. 

Though,  limited  supporting  evidence  exists  for  non-
stimulant  medications.  A  consecutive  retrospective  case  se-
ries on seven patients with comorbid ADHD-BD, who were 
treated  with  ATX  and  -  all  but  one  -  mood  stabilizers, 
demonstrated  significant  improvements  in  core  ADHD 
symptoms;  main  adverse  effects  included  sedation,  nausea, 
and decreased appetite [63]. The same authors later conduct-
ed  an  open-label  prospective  study  on  twelve  6  to  14  years 
old patients with comorbid ADHD-BD with ongoing mood-
stabilizers,  and  found  that  ATX  was  effective  in  improving 
ADHD core symptoms and behaviors but not BD symptoms 
[64].  ATX  may  thus  be  prescribed  in  individuals  with 
ADHD  and  comorbid  BD,  though  limited  supporting  evi-
dence is available so far [65, 66]. Furthermore, the use of a 
combination  of  Amantadine  and  either  Clonidine  or  Pro-
pranolol has been suggested to control symptoms of comor-
bid  ADHD-BD  by  a  recent  case  series  conducted  on  three 
pediatric patients [67].  

One of the major issues to consider when treating comor-
bid children and adolescents is the risk of mood switch. Indi-
viduals  with  comorbid  ADHD-BD,  particularly  those  with 
BD  type  1,  are  at  high  risk  for  mood  destabilization  with 
most ADHD treatments and should thus be prescribed mood-
stabilizing medications prior to initiate specific ADHD ther-
apies  [68].  Indeed,  a  previous  retrospective  study  found  an 
association  between  a  past  history  of  treatment  with  stimu-

lants and an earlier onset of BD in adolescents with ADHD, 
suggesting  that  stimulants  could  accelerate  the  onset  of  BD 
[69].  Similarly,  a  retrospective  study  found  that  the  odds  of 
ADHD youths developing BD are significantly and positive-
ly  associated  with  longer  treatment  with  MPH  and  MAS 
prior to first diagnosis of mania [42].  

Nevertheless, more recent encouraging evidence is avail-
able for MPH. In the Swedish National Registry, more than 
two  thousand  BD  patients,  who  initiated  a  treatment  with 
either  MPH  alone  or  with  concomitant  mood-stabilizers, 
were followed-up for 12 months [70]. The authors found that 
the risk of manic switch was initially increased in those pa-
tients  assuming  MPH  monotherapy  though  at  a  non-
significant level, and was unchanged in the successive peri-
od.  By  the  contrary,  in  patients  assuming  both  MPH  and 
mood  stabilizers,  the  risk  was  reduced  in  the  first  3  months 
and unchanged in the successive period. Besides, stimulants 
do not seem to increase the risk of suicidal and non-suicidal 
self-injurious  behavior  in  patients  with  ADHD,  but,  rather, 
may  reduce  such  risk  [71-73].  Similar,  though  limited  find-
ings  are  available  also  for  patients  with  comorbid  ADHD-
BD.  For  instance,  within  six  months  after  stimulants  initia-
tion, the rate of suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury 
events  decreased  significantly,  both  in  terms  of  numbers  of 
suicidal  patients  and  numbers  of  events  experienced;  nota-
bly, these effects were preserved two years later [74]. Stimu-
lant treatment may thus reduce the risk of suicidal events in 
patients  with  ADHD-BD.  Thus,  based  on  available  studies, 
clinicians  should  not  withhold  stimulant  treatment  from 
ADHD  patients  for  fear  of  deterioration  of  the  concomitant 
BD,  though  mood  stabilizer  treatment  and  close  monitoring 
remain warranted to minimize the risk of manic switches.  

On the other hand, mixed evidence is available for the as-
sociation  between  ATX  and  risk  of  both  manic  switch  and 
suicidal ideation. Manic switch in ADHD patients without a 
prior history of psychotic illness or mania can  be caused by 
ATX,  though  it  is  more  common  in  patients  with  comorbid 
BD [75]. In a first retrospective chart review of seven pediat-
ric patients with ADHD-BD already treated with mood stabi-
lizers, no hypomania or mania was reported with the use of 
ATX for up to 18 months [63], while a worsening of mood 
symptoms  was  found  in  a  minority  of  patients  in  an  open-
label  prospective  study  [64].  In  an  Italian  study  on  781 
young  people,  ATX  induced  a  hypomanic  episode  only  in 
one  exposed  patient  [76],  whereas  in  a  Taiwanese  registry 
study,  short-term  treatment  with  ATX  in  145  children  with 
ADHD did not correlate with a higher risk of BD onset [77]. 
An association between ATX and increased risk of suicidali-
ty has not been reported in ADHD patients, being such risk 
mostly related to comorbid conditions such as BD [64]; nev-
ertheless,  all  patients  treated  with  ATX  should  be  carefully 
monitored  for  the  emergence  or  worsening  of  suicidality 
[75].  

Finally, since emotional dysregulation in ADHD patients 
has  been  found  to  possibly  represent  a  specific  predictor  of 
subsequent  diagnoses  of  BD  [9],  another  major  issue  in  the 
treatment  of  ADHD-BD  comorbidity  would  be  to  directly 
address emotional dysregulation as a core manifestation per-
taining to the bipolar spectrum in ADHD. Recently, a meta-
analysis  was  conducted  on  clinical  studies  assessing  the  ef-

914    Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4 

Sesso et al. 

fects  of  psychostimulants  on  emotional  dysregulation  [78], 
showing  that  MPH  was  significantly  more  effective  than 
placebo  in  reducing  symptoms  severity  with  small-to-
medium  effect  size.  Additional  evidence  included  a  low  ef-
fect  size  for  Atomoxetine  and  a  small-to-medium  one  for 
Lisdexamfetamine,  though  the  paucity  of  studies  conducted 
with  these  drugs  did  not  allow  for  definite  conclusions. 
However,  the  three  compounds  were  significantly  effective 
in reducing emotional dysregulation symptoms in addition to 
the core symptoms of ADHD. 

In our opinion, in most of the cases, a two-step treatment 
approach is advisable, with mood stabilization preceding the 
treatment  of  ADHD  symptoms.  Stimulants  are  the  most  ef-
fective medications for ADHD, but their use may be contra-
indicated in the presence of a comorbid drug abuse or in pa-
tients that simulate or exaggerate ADHD symptoms in order 
to  obtain  stimulants  for  diversion  or  abuse  [66].  Evidence 
supports  positive  effects  on  suicide  prevention  in  ADHD 
patients treated with MPH, particularly when mood disorders 
are associated. ATX can be used in patients who do not re-
spond  to  stimulants,  or  when  stimulants  are  contraindicated 
(i.e.,  worsening  of  tics  in  Tourette  Syndrome,  evidence  of 
negative effects on growth and weight). Based on empirical 
evidence,  the  low  use  of  ADHD  medications  in  BD  youths 
may have negative short- and long-term implications on out-
come. 

4. DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS 

A  bidirectional  association  between  BD  and  DBD,  in-
cluding ODD and CD, has been consistently reported in clin-
ical, epidemiological, and research samples [79]. Comorbidi-
ty rates according to data from a large, unselected sample of 
referred  children  and  adolescents  were  estimated  as  high  as 
40% of CD youths with BD and 41% of BD youths with CD 
[80],  Biederman  and  colleagues  closely  explored  the  phe-
nomenology of youths with comorbid CD-BD using a struc-
tured interview, and found that the presence of one disorder 
did  not  affect  the  presentation  of  the  other,  except  aggres-
siveness  being  higher  in  those  children  with  both  disorders 
[80].  Conversely,  a  more  recent  study  showed  that  the 
comorbidity between BD and ODD/CD is featured by higher 
rates  of  impulsive  aggression  and  higher  risk  of  substance 
abuse [81]. Regarding the type of aggression in CD and BD, 
Vitiello  and  Stoff  previously  suggested  that  aggression  is 
more  frequently  impulsive,  non-predatory  and  disorganized 
in  BD,  and  purposeful,  predatory  and  organized  in  CD,  alt-
hough both subtypes can be present in both disorders particu-
larly when they are associated [82]. Furthermore, BD youths 
with comorbid CD manifest poorer recovery from first manic 
or  mixed  episodes  as  well  as  greater  number  of  mood  epi-
sodes [83]. Further studies on this association may be useful, 
given  the  prevalent  role  of  psychosocial  variables  in  affect-
ing this risk in different countries. 

Interestingly,  such  comorbidity  frequently  overlaps  with 
the  concomitant  occurrence  of  ADHD  [84].  In  a  study  on 
boys  with  ADHD,  55%  of  those  with  CD  also  had  BD  and 
71% of the boys with BD also had CD [85]. Indeed, the rate 
of CD is significantly greater in children with comorbid BD 
and  ADHD  compared  to  children  with  ADHD  alone  [32], 
with comorbid ADHD-BD representing a major risk for the 

development  of  subsequent  ODD/CD  and  substance  abuse 
[42].  Vice  versa,  comorbid  ADHD-CD  is  a  risk  factor  for 
developing  subsequent  mood  disorders  [39].  Youths  with 
comorbid BD, CD and ADHD were most severely impaired 
according  to  the  number  of  hospitalizations  and  character-
ized  by  an  acute  and  explosive  type  of  aggression,  mainly 
explained by the manic component, beyond the basic impul-
sive  aggressiveness  of  CD;  rates  of  alcohol  and  substance 
dependence are also higher [81]. 

Negative  prognostic  implications  including  a  poorer  re-
sponse  to  treatments  are  frequently  found  in  youths  with 
comorbid  CD-BD.  Both  naturalistic  studies  and  open-label 
trials  found  that  DBD  comorbidity  is  a  major  predictor  of 
poor treatment response for manic symptoms in monothera-
py  with  mood  stabilizers  [86,  87].  However,  a  randomized 
controlled  trial  indicated  that  youths  with  comorbid  DBD-
BD  experienced  greater  improvement  in  manic  symptoms 
when  treated  with  antipsychotics  versus  mood  stabilizers, 
whereas  youth  with  non-comorbid  BD  experienced  similar 
symptoms improvement with both medications [88].  

There is a shared consensus on the relative usefulness of 
medications in ODD/CD directly targeting core symptoms of 
the  disorders,  though  prescription  of  certain  psychotropic 
drugs,  especially  antipsychotics,  increased  considerably  in 
the last decades, particularly second generation antipsychot-
ics [89]. Lithium may be effective on aggression in the con-
text of CD with a high level of evidence though provided by 
studies  with  limited  sample  sizes  and  short  follow-up  [90, 
91].  Nonetheless,  no  medications  are  currently  approved  in 
the US to treat CD, while in Europe, the evidence supporting 
Risperidone  treatment  for  CD  and  aggression  has  been 
judged  sufficient  to  warrant  its  approval.  Treatment  with 
psychostimulants  is  also  highly  recommended  for  patients 
who have both comorbid ADHD and conduct problems. 

While  only  few  pharmacological  treatments  for  CD  are 
available,  BD  can  be  successfully  treated,  and  its  treatment 
may even mitigate symptoms of CD in children affected by 
both disorders [79]. Considering the high morbidity and dis-
ability associated with CD and the limited treatment options 
available, these findings would have very important clinical 
and public health significance. Nevertheless, the presence of 
comorbid  CD  is  among  the  predictors  of  non-response  to 
both  Lithium  and  Valproic  Acid  [86,  87],  while  Quetiapine 
and Risperidone, instead, may be promising agents with po-
tential use in young patients, with similar efficacy in reduc-
ing  manic  symptoms  and  aggression  [92,  93].  Quetiapine 
was  more  effective  in  improving  anxiety  and  depressive 
symptoms, including suicidality, while changes in body mass 
index  (BMI)  and  prolactin  levels  were  more  evident  with 
Risperidone [94]. Long-acting intramuscular injectable prep-
arations  of  second-generation  antipsychotics  (SGAs)  have 
also  been  tested  in  patients  with  BD  and/or  CD,  who  were 
non-compliant to oral antipsychotic drugs, with global clini-
cal  improvement  both  in  comorbid  and  non-comorbid  pa-
tients,  but  with  weight  gain,  extra-pyramidal  symptoms  and 
galactorrhea frequently reported [95]. So far, controlled stud-
ies  with  larger  sample  size  aimed  at  looking  for  long-term 
side effects and for the impact of treatment dropout are miss-
ing.

Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4    915 

In summary, the co-occurrence of CD and other DBD is a 
negative predictor of response to medication, with more fre-
quent  need  for  antipsychotic  agents,  which  are  more  effec-
tive but also show heavier side effects. However, improving 
manic or mixed symptoms can ameliorate the aggressiveness 
and  impulsivity  of  bipolar  patients,  with  positive  effects  on 
the short- and long-term outcome. 

5. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS 

The association between BD and SUD, including alcohol 
and  drugs  use  disorders,  has  long  been  established  in  adult 
populations,  both  in  clinical  and  epidemiological  settings 
[96-98]. However, only in the last two decades, several stud-
ies on the mutual relationships between youth BD and SUD 
have  emerged.  Indeed,  youth-onset  BD  was  early  recog-
nized as a risk factor for SUD in retrospective studies show-
ing  higher  SUD  comorbidity  rates  in  early-onset  than  in 
adult-onset  BD  [99,  100],  and,  among  BD  youths,  in  those 
with  adolescent-onset  compared  to  those  with  child-onset 
[101-103].  Subsequent  cross-sectional  clinical  studies  re-
vealed  a  SUD  point  prevalence  of  approximately  20% 
among adolescents with BD [104], but up to 45-48% of BD 
adolescents were diagnosed with comorbid SUD at baseline 
and/or  at  follow-up  in  longitudinal  studies  [105,  106].  In-
deed,  prospective  studies  conducted  on  BD  youths  revealed 
that  up  to  one  third  of  non-comorbid  patients  are  likely  to 
develop  a  SUD  during  clinical  follow-up:  an  incidence  of 
SUD of 32% has been reported in a sample of children with 
BD type 1 followed for about 8 years [107]; similarly, 32% 
of  adolescents  with  bipolar  spectrum  disorders,  mostly  re-
cruited from outpatient clinics, and followed for on average 
4  years,  developed  a  first-onset  SUD  [105].  Impressively, 
almost  one  fourth  of  non-comorbid  patients  hospitalized  for 
first-episode mania developed a SUD after approximately 40 
weeks  from  hospital  discharge  [106].  In  accordance  with 
these findings, higher rates of comorbid SUD were repeated-
ly observed in BD youths compared to control subjects with-
out mood disorders [103, 108, 109], and significantly higher 
rates of drug abuse were also found in adolescents with BD 
compared with those with Major Depressive Disorder, while 
a  non-significantly  higher  rate  of  Alcohol  Use  Disorder 
(AUD) was encountered in one study [110]. 

Both drug abuse and alcoholism, together with psychosis, 
suicide  attempts  and  social  impairments,  were  retained  as 
phenotypic  features  of  BD  showing  familial  aggregation 
among  40  candidates  in  a  sample  of  1246  adults  from  172 
multiplex that families [111]. Clinical studies confirmed that 
youth  with  BD  show  higher  rates  of  SUD  among  family 
members  compared  to  major  depressive  youths  and  non-
affected  controls,  independently  from  SUD  or  CD  in  pro-
bands  [104].  Moreover,  the  SUD-BD  phenotype  has  been 
related to a higher familial load for BD in families of youth 
with BD type 1 in one study [112]. In the same sample, the 
SUD-BD  type  1  phenotype  has  also  been  shown  to  run  in 
families, since the comorbidity between mania and SUD was 
found  to  be  overrepresented  among  first-degree  relatives  of 
SUD-BD  type  1  adolescents  [112].  Nevertheless,  a  recent 
study  on  adolescent  and  young  adult  relatives  of  patients 
with  BD,  showed  that  the  increased  risk  of  SUD  associated 
with  BD  family  history  was  no  longer  significant  when  ac-
counting  for  youth  psychopathology,  particularly  mood  and 

externalizing  disorders  [113].  Conversely,  in  another  study, 
additive  effects  of  parental  SUD  and  offspring  BD  on  the 
risk of alcohol use disorder were observed [114]. 

Among adolescents with BD, several features, other than 
family  history  of  SUD,  may  help  identify  those  patients  at 
higher risk of developing a SUD. A later onset of BD [101, 
106], low family cohesiveness [105, 115], comorbidity with 
DBD  [106,  115],  particularly  ODD  [101,  105],  and  anxiety 
disorders  [101],  particularly  panic  disorder  [105],  were  all 
repeatedly  found  predictive  of  SUD  onset  in  longitudinal 
studies, while a greater (hypo)manic symptom severity in the 
12  weeks  preceding  SUD  onset  was  reported  in  one  study 
[105].  Comorbid  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD) 
was also significantly associated with developing a SUD in a 
prospective evaluation of adolescents with first-episode ma-
nia [106], while impactful child life events have been associ-
ated with regular drug use at follow-up in a sample of chil-
dren  enriched  for  elevated  manic  symptoms  [115].  In  addi-
tion,  in  a  previous  retrospective  account,  significantly  more 
SUD was reported in BD youth with comorbid PTSD than in 
those  without  or  with  subthreshold  PTSD  [116].  In  five 
comorbid cases PTSD preceded SUD, while  in the remain-
ing  two  cases  the  coincident  onset  of  BD  and  SUD  led  to 
trauma and subsequent PTSD [116]. Two additional BD fea-
tures  showed  a  bidirectional  longitudinal  relationship  with 
SUD.  First,  psychotic  symptoms  were  among  the  strongest 
predictors  of  SUD  development  in  a  study  on  patients  with 
first-episode  mania  [106].  Conversely,  in  a  sample  of  BD 
offspring, psychotic symptoms were predicted by first-onset 
SUD,  mostly  Cannabis  Use  Disorder,  independently  from 
the  diagnosis  of  BD  [117].  Although  most  research  on  the 
association  between  cannabis  and  psychosis  has  been  con-
ducted  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  spectrum  disorders,  a 
positive relationship between cannabis use and the presence 
of  psychotic  symptoms  in  BD  patients  was  repeatedly  ob-
served  in  adult  studies  [118].  Secondly,  a  history  of  suicide 
attempts has been found to strongly predict the onset of SUD 
in  a  retrospective  longitudinal  evaluation  of  patients  with 
youth-onset  BD  [101].  On  the  other  hand,  several  cross-
sectional  adult  studies  observed  a  positive  association  be-
tween SUD and a history of suicide attempts [119], especial-
ly  in  patients  with  AUD  [120-122]  or  cannabis  use  [118, 
123],  while  a  case-control  study  including  96  adolescent 
suicide attempters found other illicit drug use disorders (i.e., 
inhalants, cocaine and hallucinogens) to be significantly pre-
dictive of suicide attempts [124]. 

While several studies reported on the onset of SUD in pa-
tients  with  youth  BD,  Duffy  and  colleagues  suggested  that 
SUD  may  also  precede  major  depressive  or  full-blown  (hy-
po)manic  episodes  in  those  with  genetic  risk  for  BD  [117]. 
Indeed, minor mood disorders (i.e., cyclothymia, dysthymia, 
adjustment  disorder  with  depressive  symptoms,  depression 
or mood disorders not otherwise specified) and non-affective 
psychopathology prospectively predicted SUD occurrence in 
BD offspring, while a mutual longitudinal relations between 
full-blown BD and SUD were observed [117]. A peak hazard 
of  developing  SUD  was  found  between  the  ages  of  14  and 
20, especially in subjects with BD or minor mood disorders 
[117]. These findings are in line with a previous representa-
tive community study of 1709 adolescents, showing a similar 
prevalence of SUD both in subjects with full-blown BD (N = 

916    Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4 

Sesso et al. 

18)  and  in  those  with  subsyndromal  manic  symptoms  (N  = 
97)  [125].  From  a  longitudinal  perspective,  subsyndromal 
manic  symptoms  have  been  found  to  significantly  increase 
the risk for later onset of alcohol abuse/dependence, cannabis 
abuse/dependence, and benzodiazepine abuse/dependence in 
a  representative  sample  of  young  adults  [126],  and,  more 
recently, a high and rising 24-month manic symptoms trajec-
tory  significantly  predicted  regular  alcohol  use,  though  not 
regular drug use, over a 6-year follow-up of children recruit-
ed  in  the  Longitudinal  Assessment  of  Manic  Symptoms 
(LAMS)  study  [115].  Similarly,  childhood  severe  affec-
tive/behavioral  dysregulation  has  been  associated  with  an 
increased risk for SUD in young adults [127]. 

Unfortunately,  effective  treatments  for  SUD-BD  comor-
bidity are still an area of unmet needs, since comorbid condi-
tions  have  been  systematically  excluded  from  BD  and, 
somewhat less, from SUD trials, especially in youth popula-
tions [104, 128]. Indeed, only one 6-week, double-blind pla-
cebo-controlled pilot trial has been conducted in adolescents 
with SUD-BD [129]. The study compared Lithium to place-
bo in a small group of patients with bipolar spectrum disor-
ders  and  secondary  substance  dependence,  mainly  alcohol 
and  cannabis  [129].  Lithium  monotherapy  at  a  therapeutic 
blood  level  of  approximately  0.9  mEq/L  was  well  tolerated 
and  was  associated  with  improved  global  clinical  impres-
sion  and  with  more  negative  urine  drug  tests  compared  to 
placebo [129].  

More  randomized-controlled  studies  are  available  in  the 
adult population, especially in patients with AUD-BD. How-
ever, only Valproic Acid preparations, as an add-on to Lithi-
um  treatment,  repeatedly  improved  alcohol  use  outcomes, 
including  a  greater  reduction  of  drinking  days,  a  lower  rate 
of  relapse  to  heavy  drinking,  and  lower  gamma  glutamyl 
transpeptidase compared to placebo [128, 130]. Conversely, 
Quetiapine  has  been  tested  in  three  randomized-controlled 
trials but proved useless for alcohol-related outcomes [128], 
though being effective on depressive symptoms in a sample 
of  outpatients  with  AUD-BD  [131].  A  similar  finding  was 
recently reported for Ondansetron in a sample of adults with 
bipolar  spectrum  disorders  and  comorbid  early-onset  AUD 
[132].  Aripiprazole, 
instead,  showed  some  superiority 
against  placebo  on  secondary  outcomes,  including  marginal 
effects on the number of drinks per drinking day and a time-
limited  decrease  in  percent  carbohydrate-deficient  transfer-
rin,  possibly  suggesting  that  low  doses  may  be  preferred 
[133].  Among  anti-craving  medications,  Naltrexone  was 
effective in decreasing drinking days and alcohol cravings in 
AUD-BD  patients  [134],  while  only  limited  benefits  over 
placebo  were  provided  by  Acamprosate  [135].  As  for  other 
substances,  promising  results  are  available  for  Citicoline  in 
BD  patients  with  cocaine  dependence,  in  terms  of  negative 
urine tests and cognitive outcomes, though differences from 
placebo  declined  over  time  [136,  137].  Finally,  a  recent  1-
week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, magnetic 
resonance  imaging  pilot  study  found  that  Gabapentin  was 
well tolerated in 22 adults with comorbid CUD-BD and may 
be  considered,  based  on  the  observed  modulation  of  brain 
GABA/glutamate levels, as a candidate adjuvant medication 
for cannabis use warranting further investigation [138]. 

Since  only  limited  treatment  strategies  are  available  for 
SUD-BD  comorbidity,  the  treatment  of  BD  before  SUD 
comorbidity  occurrence  has  been  proposed  as  a  secondary 
prevention  strategy  worth  of  study  [104].  Based  on  results 
from  naturalistic 
longitudinal  studies,  pharmacological 
treatment  of  BD  and  its  comorbidities  may  help  reduce  the 
risk of subsequent SUD. Indeed, a higher number of medica-
tions  prescribed  significantly  decreased  the  risk  of  regular 
drug use over a 6-year follow-up in a cohort of children en-
riched for symptoms of mania [115]. In another study, anti-
depressant treatment was negatively associated with SUD at 
follow-up  in  a  sample  of  adolescents  with  bipolar  spectrum 
disorder [105]. More importantly, in the same study, the ab-
sence  of  Lithium  exposure  in  the  12  weeks  preceding  pre-
dicted  SUD  onset,  increased  the  likelihood  of  comorbidity 
[105].  Finally,  adolescents  treated  with  psychostimulant 
treatment before their first manic episode were significantly 
less  at  risk  to  develop  a  SUD,  independently  from  ADHD 
diagnosis [106]. Although these findings are likely to be sub-
ject to referral bias and should be interpreted with caution, it 
seems  reasonable  that  prompt  treatment  of  BD  and  related 
comorbidities  may  lower  the  risk  of  developing  a  SUD,  at 
least in some patients prone to self-medication [139]. 

In  summary,  as  previously  proposed  by  Goldstein  and 
Bukstein,  BD  should  be  considered  a  modifiable  risk  factor 
for SUD, especially in the adolescent population  [104]. Ac-
cordingly, all BD youths should be carefully and repeatedly 
screened for substance use. When multiple risk factors apply, 
mood stabilization should be improved. Importantly, in high-
risk patients (e.g., SUD-BD family history, DBD and/or anx-
iety  disorders,  substance  use),  a  mood-stabilizing  treatment 
may be considered right after the onset of minor mood symp-
toms, before the first occurrence of full-blown affective epi-
sodes. Moreover, SUD can also be considered a prodrome of 
BD  in  those  with  genetic  risk  and  may  thus  warrant  mood 
stabilization.  

6. AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER 

It  is  increasingly  recognized  that  comorbid  psychiatric 
disorders may significantly contribute to the morbidity asso-
ciated with ASD [140]. Among mood disorder comorbidities 
in ASD, BD has been found to represent the vast majority of 
cases,  up  to  75%  [20,  141].  The  overall  prevalence  of 
comorbid BD in ASD clinical cohorts has been estimated at 
4-7% with no significant gender-related difference [142], as 
also confirmed by a large national registry study [143], while 
higher rates have been reported in adult patients [144]. Con-
versely,  ASD  prevalence  in  BD  is  estimated  to  range  from 
1.4% in population-based studies up to 30% in clinical sam-
ples  [140,  145].  High-functioning  ASD  seems  more  closely 
related  to  BD  and,  among  the  relatives  of  these  patients,  a 
high prevalence of mood disorders has been found [144].  

Moreover,  even  without  a  clearcut  diagnosis  of  BD,  the 
prevalence of subclinical manic symptoms, including elation, 
expansive mood, and racing thoughts, is rather high in ASD 
youths [146]. Notably, some authors consider BD to be often 
underestimated  in  ASD  samples,  especially  because  of  the 
communication  difficulties  and  low  intellectual  functioning 
that  complicate  the  identification  of  comorbid  clinical  pic-
tures [147]. To further increase the complexity of the issue, 

Pharmacotherapy of Bipolar Disorder and Comorbidities 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4    917 

BD in ASD is often characterized by atypical characteristics, 
such  as  irritability  and  behavioral  disturbances,  which  are 
frequently associated with several other potentially comorbid 
conditions, including, above all, ADHD [147].  

Overall  severity  of  mood  episodes  in  youths  with  ASD-
BD  is  similar  to  that  of  youths  with  non-comorbid  BD, 
though an increased functional impairment related to comor-
bid  ASD  has  been  reported  [145,  147].  A  highly  episodic 
course characterized by manic episodes with mixed features 
including  irritable,  unstable,  and  dysphoric  mood,  and  sub-
syndromal  mixed  symptoms  during  inter-episode  intervals, 
are  frequently  observed,  while  depressive  episodes  may 
show milder features and chronic course [144, 148]. During 
mania,  grandiosity,  hallucinations,  psychotic  interpretations 
and  delusional 
ideas  are  dominant  features  of  high-
functioning ASD, while aggressive behavior, irritability, and 
overactivity  are  common  in  low-functioning  ASD  [140, 
144].  Indeed,  symptoms  of  aggression  in  ASD  children  are 
more  likely  to  correlate  with  limited  verbal  skills  and  intel-
lectual  disability  [149].  Overall,  early  onset  of  BD,  mixed 
presentations, and greater functional impairments are evident 
in youths with ASD-BD [4]. 

BD comorbidity has also been linked with the occurrence 
of  catatonia  in  subjects  with  ASD,  since  catatonia  is  often 
due  to  an  exacerbation  of  mood  symptoms,  being  in  some 
patients the easiest clinical signs to detect mood disturbances 
[150]. Lifetime prevalence estimates of catatonia in hospital-
ized psychiatric populations range from 0.6% for adolescents 
to between 6-10% for adults [150], but in clinical practice, it 
is common to misinterpret catatonic symptoms as features of 
ASD due to the partial overlap of core symptoms. Neverthe-
less,  a  high  prevalence  of  catatonic  symptoms  is  reported 
among ASD individuals, up to 17%, when catatonia is con-
sidered  based  on  changes  in  functioning  and  psychomotor 
activity  [150,  151].  Patients  with  autism  and  catatonia  pref-
erentially  show  features  such  as  echolalia  and  echopraxia, 
stereotypies and mannerisms, mutism, negativism, and repet-
itive  psychomotor  behaviors  [151].  A  difficult  differential 
diagnosis between catatonia and Neuroleptic Malignant Syn-
drome  (NMS)  after  antipsychotic  treatment  may  occur  in 
ASD  patients,  and  should  be  always  considered  in  this  spe-
cific  population,  considering  the  effectiveness  of  catatonia 
treatments on the NMS symptoms [152]. The intrinsic diffi-
culties  of  exploring  NMS  in  ASD  in  controlled  studies  ac-
count for the subsequent lack of available information. 

Finally,  suicidal  behaviors  are  also  frequently  observed 
in ASD-BD patients, and may confer a greater risk of hospi-
talization concerning non-comorbid subjects [149, 153]. No-
tably,  ASD  is  an  independent  risk  factor  for  suicide  [154] 
with a probability to die by suicide which is 10 times greater 
than in the general population, both due to the tendency to a 
higher  vulnerability  to  stressors,  possibly  related  to  impair-
ments  in  interpreting  social  relationships,  and  to  a  high  le-
thality and violence of suicidal methods used by individuals 
with ASD [155]. This latter evidence may be at least in part 
explained  by  a  less  impulsive  nature  of  suicidality  in  ASD-
BD compared to BD, which implies a colder transition from 
ideation  to  a  suicide  attempt  and  subsequent  more  lethal 
planned  strategies  [154,  155].  Suicidality  is  especially  fre-
quent in those with high-functioning ASD as high cognitive 

competencies  may  drive  an  increased  self-consciousness  of 
one’s disability leading to feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and 
exclusion by peers [155]. 

The  pharmacological  treatment  options  available  for 
ASD  are  not  directed  to  core  symptoms  of  the  disorder  but 
rather  target  challenging  behaviors  associated  with  comor-
bidities [156]. Second-generation antipsychotics Risperidone 
and  Aripiprazole  are  currently  approved  by  Food  and  Drug 
Administration in the USA and European Medicine Agency 
in  Europe  in  treating  irritability  and  aggression  in  ASD 
youths,  with  no  significant  difference  in  effectiveness  and 
tolerability [157-159]. These agents are also commonly used 
in youth with BD, and are particularly indicated in comorbid 
ASD-BD,  namely  when  impulsive  aggression  is  prominent 
[159].  Despite  an  increased  severity  of  BD  symptoms  in 
ASD  youths,  the  presence  of  this  comorbidity  does  not  im-
pact  the  relative  rate  of  response  to  irritability.  Indeed,  ap-
proximately  65%  of  ASD-BD  patients  treated  with  SGAs 
showed  a  greater  than  30%  improvement  in  irritability, 
which is similar to the non-comorbid BD peers [145]. Given 
the high risk of side effects, firstly weight gain and metabolic 
disorders,  increased  serum  prolactin  and  sedation,  antipsy-
chotics should be used cautiously [160].  

Although  controlled  trials  are  substantially  lacking,  nu-
merous case reports and series support the efficacy of Lithi-
um  for  mood  instability,  impulsivity  and  cyclicity  in  ASD 
subjects  [144].  Lithium  is  often  recommended  as  the  first 
choice  for  the  treatment  of  manic  symptoms,  especially  in 
those  with  positive  family  history  of  BD.  Lithium  seems  to 
be  effective  in  controlling  aggression  and  overactivity,  as 
well as in reducing manic symptoms and mood swings. In a 
recent  retrospective  chart  review,  73.7%  of  patients  with 
ASD experienced significant clinical improvement after add-
on Lithium salts to their treatment regimen, thus representing 
a reliable alternative to antipsychotics and other psychotropic 
medications [161]. Valproic Acid is the anticonvulsant with 
the  largest  evidence  in  comorbid  ASD-BD,  with  particular 
efficacy  in  alleviating  hyperarousal  symptoms,  irritability, 
dysphoria  and  anxiety  [162].  As  a  conclusion,  mood  stabi-
lizers  may  be  thus  preferable  to  antipsychotics,  especially 
when  aggression  and  hostility  are  not  prominent,  and  anti-
psychotics  should  be  used  at  the  lowest  effective  dose  and 
for strictly necessary periods to minimize adverse effects. 

7. ANXIETY DISORDERS 

The  comorbidity  between  BD  and  ADHD  or  DBD  has 
received  greater  attention  in  children  and  adolescents, 
comorbid anxiety in pediatric BD is a neglected but frequent 
and  clinically  relevant  phenomenon.  According  to  a  recent 
meta-analysis,  44.7%  of  patients  with  pediatric  BD  show  at 
least  one  lifetime  comorbid  anxiety  disorder,  with  General-
ized  Anxiety  Disorder  (GAD)  being  observed  in  27.4%  of 
patients,  Separation  Anxiety  Disorder  (SeAD)  in  26.1%, 
Social Anxiety Disorder (SoAD) (formerly known as Social 
Phobia)  in  20.1%,  and  Panic  Disorder  (PD)  in  12.7%  [3]. 
Since early studies, Multiple Anxiety Disorders (MAD) have 
also  been  often  observed  in  pediatric  BD  samples  [8,  163, 
164].  Consistently,  among  446  youths  with  BD  recruited  as 
participants  for  the  COBY  study,  18%  met  the  criteria  for 
MAD  [17].  A  similar  prevalence  of  MAD  (22%)  has  also 

918    Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4 

Sesso et al. 

been  confirmed  in  a  large  epidemiological  cohort  of  8,129 
youths with BD [165].  

ities  in  a  recent  study  conducted  on  9,720  adolescent  inpa-
tients with bipolar depression [185]. 

The high prevalence of anxiety disorders in pediatric BD 
is consistent with the finding that the offspring of adult bipo-
lar  probands  often  initially  receive  anxiety  disorder  diagno-
ses  [163,  166].  Anxiety  disorders  may  represent  a  correlate 
or an early precursor of pediatric BD as suggested by longi-
tudinal  prospective  studies  [167,  168].  Indeed,  based  on  re-
cent meta-analyses, the comorbidity of any anxiety disorder, 
SoAD,  GAD  and  SeAD,  with  pediatric  BD,  is  higher  than 
the  comorbidity  found  in  adult  cases,  while  only  PD  shows 
higher  rates  in  adults  [3,  169].  Similarly,  the  offspring  of 
parents  with  BD  usually  show  SoAD,  GAD  and  SeAD  in 
early  or  middle  childhood,  while  PD  and  BD  are  more  fre-
quently observed in adolescence [170]. 

Significant differences between SoAD and PD have been 
observed when examining the temporal relationship between 
(hypo)mania and anxiety comorbidity in adult patients [171]. 
On one hand, the onset of SoAD is almost invariably preced-
ed  by  years  by  the  onset  of  BD  and  never  overlapped  with 
the first (hypo)manic episode. Complete remission of SoAD 
was  found  during  (hypo)manic  episodes  in  almost  all  cases 
[171],  consistently  with  the  common  occurrence  of  (hy-
po)mania  in  patients  remitting  from  SoAD  after  antidepres-
sant treatment [172]. Consistently, patients with SoAD with 
good  response  to  antidepressants  have  been  found  not  to 
differ  in  terms  of  clinical  features  from  patients  diagnosed 
with  BD  type  2  during  mild/moderate  hypomanic  episodes 
[173].  Therefore,  it  is  possible  to  hypothesize  that  SoAD 
may  represent  itself,  at  least  in  a  subgroup  of  patients,  the 
precursor  of  an  atypical  bipolar  spectrum  condition,  where 
depressive  inhibition  is  manifested  by  social  inhibition  and 
anxiety,  and  hypomanic  episodes  are  usually  drug-induced 
[172-174].  

On the other hand, instead, PD has been found to precede 
BD in 27-33.3% of cases [171, 175, 176], while overlapping 
with the first (hypo)manic episode in 28.6% of cases  [171]. 
Moreover,  PD  has  been  associated  with  short  hypomanic 
episodes in adults with recurrent brief depressions [177] and 
with a higher number of hypomanic episodes in patients with 
BD type 2 [178]. Anxiety sensitivity, a known risk factor for 
PD  which  consists  of  excessive  fear  of  anxiety  sensations 
and beliefs that these sensations are harmful, may explain the 
interaction between BD and PD, since a state-dependent in-
crease  in  anxiety  sensitivity  has  been  observed  during  (hy-
po)manic and mixed states [175]. 

Besides  theoretical  issues,  comorbid  anxiety  disorders 
show relevant clinical and prognostic implications in patients 
with  BD.  Indeed,  they  have  been  associated  with  female 
gender,  younger  age  at  onset,  higher  depression  severity, 
somatic  complaints  during  depression,  poorer  global  func-
tioning and quality of life, shorter euthymia, slower recovery 
from  depression,  and  higher  risk  of  early  relapse  both  in 
adults [178-182] and in children and adolescents with BD [8, 
17, 165, 176, 183-186]. Several studies have also repeatedly 
highlighted  the  association  between  comorbid  anxiety  or 
anxious  symptoms  and  suicidal  ideation,  suicidal  behavior, 
and past suicide attempts in youths with BD [110, 184, 185]. 
Notably,  this  association  was  still  significant  when  control-
ling for demographic confounders and psychiatric comorbid-

Despite the clinical importance of BD-anxiety comorbidi-
ty, no randomized-controlled studies have been conducted so 
far  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  pharmacological  treatments  of 
anxiety  disorders  in  children  and  adolescents  with  BD.  The 
same issue applies to adult BD, in which, to the best of our 
knowledge,  only  four  randomized-controlled  trials  on  the 
treatment  of  BD  and  comorbid  anxiety  disorders  have  been 
conducted. On one side, two 8-week, double-blind, placebo-
controlled  trials  failed  to  support  the  anxiolytic  effects  of 
Risperidone  and  Ziprasidone  monotherapy,  respectively,  in 
111  and  49  adult  patients  with  co-occurring  PD  or  GAD 
[187, 188].  Conversely, significant improvements in anxiety 
were observed in a 12-week, single-blind trial of 47 Lithium-
treated euthymic patients with current anxiety disorders ran-
domized to add-on treatment with Olanzapine or Lamotrigi-
ne [189]. Both medications significantly reduced anxiety, but 
Olanzapine  exceeded  Lamotrigine  in  specific  analyses.  Fi-
nally,  patients  with  BD  and  comorbid  PD  or  GAD  treated 
with  Quetiapine  extended-release  were  found  to  achieve 
greater  improvements  in  anxiety  than  patients  treated  with 
Valproic Acid or placebo in an 8-week, double-blind, place-
bo-controlled trial including 149 patients [190].  

Based on these findings, Olanzapine and Quetiapine may 
have some beneficial short-term effects on anxiety symptoms 
in  adult  BD  patients,  when  compared  with  antiepileptic 
mood stabilizers (Lamotrigine and Valproic Acid), likely due 
to their sedative properties related to the blockade of a wide 
range  of  receptors,  including  histamine  H1  receptors  [191]. 
Indeed,  several  other  randomized-controlled  trials  on  the 
efficacy  of  atypical  antipsychotics  for  anxiety  symptoms  in 
adults  with  BD  have  been  conducted,  with  multiple  studies 
showing  modest  efficacy  of  Quetiapine  over  placebo  [192]. 
However, only a few studies are available overall, and most 
are limited by using outcome measures focusing on any type 
of  anxiety  morbidity,  while  none  was  directed  at  specific 
anxiety syndromes. 

Further  information  on  treatment  response  in  children 
and  adolescents  with  BD  and  comorbid  anxiety  disorders 
comes from longitudinal observational studies. In naturalistic 
settings,  children  and  adolescents  with  BD  and  comorbid 
anxiety disorders have shown higher rates of treatment with 
antidepressants than BD patients without anxiety [8, 186]. In 
a  longitudinal  study,  the  persistence  of  anxiety  disorders  in 
the  long-term  was  weakly  though  significantly  associated 
with  less  follow-up  time  receiving  antidepressant  medica-
tions [193]. While these results may support the use of anti-
depressants in adolescents with BD and comorbid anxiety, a 
specific  increase  in  treatment-emergent  (hypo)mania  in 
comorbid  patients  has  been  repeatedly  reported.  In  an  early 
study on 43 adolescent outpatients with BD, 36% of subjects 
with comorbid anxiety disorders, but none of those without, 
reported a history of treatment-emergent (hypo)mania [164]. 
A subsequent study confirmed that early-onset anxiety disor-
ders  were  predictive  of  treatment-emergent  (hypo)mania  in 
pediatric  BD  [194].  The  frequent  use  of  antidepressants  in 
comorbid patients could also be mediated by the association 
between  anxiety  comorbidity  and  BD  type  2  [8,176],  given 

Pharmacotherapy of Bipolar Disorder and Comorbidities 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4    919 

that  patients  with  BD  type  2  spend  more  time  with  syndro-
mal or subsyndromal depressive symptoms [1].  

These findings suggest the need to be cautious when con-
sidering antidepressant pharmacotherapy in youths with anx-
iety disorders and BD. Close monitoring of possible worsen-
ing  after  antidepressant  monotherapy,  such  as  irritability, 
behavioral  dyscontrol,  substance  abuse,  and  suicidality,  is 
warranted.  Whenever  possible,  a  more  conservative  ap-
proach  may  be  preferred,  including  considering  the  anti-
anxiety properties of antiepileptic mood stabilizers. Based on 
adult  studies,  Gabapentin  may  have  beneficial  effects  in 
SoAD and PD [195, 196], while Valproate may be effective 
in PD and anxious symptoms of BD [197]. Divalproex Sodi-
um  has  also  proved  useful  in  reducing  anxiety  in  a  small 
sample  of  adolescent  inpatients  with  BD  [198],  and,  in  a 
sample  of  158  (hypo)manic  youths  initially  treated  with 
Valproate monotherapy, comorbidity with GAD, SeAD, and 
Simple Phobias were associated with a lower rate of switch 
to polypharmacy, while GAD was also associated with better 
response [87].  

Considering  the  high  risk  of  side  effects  after  antipsy-
chotic  treatment,  mood  stabilizers  with  higher  anti-anxiety 
properties  (Valproate,  Gabapentin)  may  be  first  considered. 
In treatment-resistant patients, Quetiapine may be considered 
in  monotherapy  or  as  an  add-on  treatment.  Antidepressants 
should be avoided in monotherapy, and cautiously prescribed 
as  an  add-on  treatment  with  stabilized  mood  and  persisting 
anxiety, with discontinuation of a few weeks or months after 
the improvement of the anxiety symptomatology.  

8. OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER 

The  comorbidity  between  BD  and  OCD  has  been  early 
proposed  as  a  clinically  relevant  condition  in  adult  patients. 
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the classical authors 
in French psychiatry debated the relationship between obses-
sive  symptoms  and  affective  syndromes,  especially  empha-
sizing the prevalence of obsessive phenomena in the context 
of melancholic and mixed depressive phases and subsuming 
episodic  obsessive  syndromes  under  the  manic-depressive 
domain  [199,  200].  More  recently,  Chen  and  Dilsaver  first 
highlighted  a  specific  link  between  OCD  and  BD  [201]. 
Based  on  the  Epidemiological  Catchment  Area  database, 
they  reported  that  21%  of  adult  patients  with  BD  presented 
lifetime comorbidity with OCD. In addition, the odds ratios 
of subjects with BD meeting the criteria for OCD relative to 
subjects  with  unipolar  depression  or  with  any  other  major 
disorder  were,  respectively,  2.0  and  3.2  [201].  A  meta-
analysis of 46 studies confirmed similar estimates of comor-
bidity, showing a 17% pooled prevalence of OCD in BD and 
a similar rate of BD in OCD (18.4%) [202]. Notably, a lower 
mean  age  predicted  a  higher  prevalence  of  OCD  in  BD  pa-
tients  and  higher  OCD  prevalence  rates  were  found  in  chil-
dren  and  adolescents  (24.2%)  compared  to  adult  patients 
(13.5%)  [202].  According  to  a  more  recent  meta-analysis, 
16.7% of patients with pediatric BD show OCD comorbidity 
[3].  Even  in  this  case,  the  comorbidity  of  OCD  was  higher 
than that observed in adult cases (9.7%) by the same authors 
[169] and higher comorbidity rates were reported by adoles-
cent-onset studies than by childhood-onset studies [3].  

thoughts,  poorer 

While  mutual  interactions  between  OCD  and  BD  have 
been  highlighted  in  adult  subjects,  fewer  studies  were  con-
ducted in youth samples. Based on adult data, comorbid BD 
in  adults  with  OCD  has  been  associated  with  an  episodic 
course  of  OCD,  with  obsessions  usually  worsening  during 
mixed  and  depressive  episodes  and  improving  during  (hy-
po)mania;  higher  rates  of  aggressive,  sexual  and  religious 
obsessions,  forbidden 
insight,  greater 
comorbidity  with  body  dysmorphic  disorder,  tic  disorders 
and panic disorder, less favorable response to antidepressants 
and  more  frequent  need  for  multiple  pharmacological  inter-
ventions  were  also  observed  [19,  203-212].  Compulsions  of 
hoarding have been also repeatedly linked to BD comorbidi-
ty in adults [19, 206] and, more consistently, in children and 
adolescents [5, 213-215]. On the other hand, OCD comorbid-
ity has been associated with a more chronic course of BD, a 
greater  comorbidity  with  panic  and  other  anxiety  disorders, 
impulse control disorders and tic disorders, a higher number 
of  depressive  episodes  and  a  history  of  treatment-emergent 
mania in adults with BD [204, 216-218]. Overall, comorbid 
OCD-BD  patients  show  more  frequent  hospitalizations, 
greater impairments of functioning and lower quality of life 
compared non-comorbid counterparts both in adult [204] and 
youth samples [213, 214, 219]. 

While adult studies are not conclusive with respect to age 
at  onset  [204],  more  evidence  comes  from  studies  on  chil-
dren  and  adolescents  and  longitudinal  investigations.  Early 
studies  from  our  group  indicated  that  OCD  in  children  and 
adolescents  with  co-occurring  BD  was  associated  with  an 
earlier onset compared to non-comorbid OCD, while the age 
of onset of BD was not affected by comorbidity [213, 219]. 
Accordingly, OCD symptoms usually antedated the onset of 
BD  in  comorbid  patients  [213,  219].  A  more  recent  study, 
instead,  found  no  differences  in  age  at  onset  of  both  BD  or 
OCD between comorbid and non-comorbid subjects [5]. In-
terestingly, these discrepancies may be explained by the rela-
tionship  between  the  primary  disorder  of  ascertainment  and 
earlier  onset  suggested  by  Joshi  and  colleagues  [214].  Ac-
cording to their study, in comorbid patients, the disorder that 
emerged  first  was  associated  with  worse  impairment.  As  a 
consequence, those primarily referred for BD more frequent-
ly showed an earlier onset of BD, while among those primar-
ily ascertained for OCD, BD had a later onset and followed 
OCD.  

Nevertheless,  a  substantial  progression  from  OCD  to 
BD  has  been  recently  suggested  based  on  two  large  longi-
tudinal  studies.  In  a  Swedish  register-based  study,  indeed, 
subjects  with  OCD  showed  a  12-fold  increased  risk  of  re-
ceiving a later diagnosis of BD, with a median of 2.7 years 
between  the  two  diagnoses  [220].  Even  when  controlling 
for  the  use  of  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors 
(SSRIs),  the  risk  of  BD  was  still  increased  by  almost  9 
times  [220].  In  addition,  a  longitudinal  community  study, 
including 3021 adolescents and young adults prospectively 
followed for up to 10 years, found prior OCD to be associ-
ated  with  a  7-fold  increased  risk  of  BD  [221].  These  find-
ings  are  supported  by  previous  studies  indicating  that  the 
association  of  co-occurring  MAD  (formerly  including 
OCD),  usually  preceding  the  onset  of  bipolarity,  may  rep-
resent a possible pathway to specific bipolar phenotypes [8, 
164, 170]. Indeed, significantly higher rates of comorbidity 

920    Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4 

Sesso et al. 

with  MAD  have  been  reported  in  comorbid  OCD-BD  pa-
tients  (65-74%)  compared  to  non-comorbid  BD  and  OCD 
youths (35-37%) [214].  

At  the  same  time,  BD  comorbidity  in  children  and  ado-
lescents with OCD has been repeatedly associated with high-
er  rates  of  ADHD  and  DBD  [5,  213,  214,  219].  Similarly, 
comorbid patients with ADHD and OCD have shown signif-
icantly  higher  rates  of  BD  comorbidity  than  non-comorbid 
OCD  youths  [215,  222,  223].  Importantly,  both  BD  and 
DBD comorbidity, especially CD, have been associated with 
a poorer response to treatment, as well as with a higher need 
for  polypharmacy,  in  patients  with  OCD  [213,  224]  and, 
among  comorbid  OCD-BD  patients,  conduct  disorder  has 
also been associated with a poorer response [5]. Notably, in 
one study, both ODD/CD, together with hoarding symptoms, 
have  been  found  to  predict  treatment  non-response  in  OCD 
patients,  while  BD  comorbidity  was  found  to  be  irrelevant 
[213]. The negative effect of BD on treatment response may, 
thus,  be  mediated,  at  least  in  a  subgroup  of  patients,  by  the 
comorbidity with DBD.  

Interestingly,  a  clinically  distinct  juvenile  behavioral 
phenotype of BD characterized by obsessive fear about harm 
to  self  or  others,  as  well  as  excessive  anxiety,  oppositional 
behavior, aggressive tendencies, and frequent suicide threats, 
has been proposed by Papolos and colleagues [225], and has 
been associated with an early age of onset, severe manic and 
depressive  symptoms,  early  and  frequent  psychiatric  hospi-
talizations,  significant  social  impairment  and  school  prob-
lems  [226].  According  to  these  authors,  a  specific  develop-
mental  sequence  of  fear-based  behaviors  could  be  clinically 
delineated in these patients, including night sweats, recurrent 
night-terrors and vivid nightmares, obsessive bedtime rituals, 
nyctophobia,  separation  anxiety,  hypervigilance,  mispercep-
tion  of  neutral  stimuli  as  threatening,  reactive  aggression  in 
response  to  limit-setting  or  perceived  threat  or  loss.  When 
treatment  resistance  to  mood-stabilizing  agents  and  atypical 
antipsychotics is demonstrated, intranasal Ketamine every 3-
4 days at sub-anesthetic doses may be a beneficial and well-
tolerated  treatment  for  these  patients,  according  to  a  retro-
spective chart review of 45 patients followed for 3 months to 
6.5 years [227].  

Though  augmentation  with  other  medications  acting  on 
the  glutamatergic  system,  such  as  Memantine  and  Topir-
amate, have proved some efficacy on obsessive and compul-
sive symptoms in adult manic patients recruited by two ran-
domized  placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  [228,  229],  most 
studies on the treatment of OCD-BD comorbidity focused on 
mood-stabilizing,  antidepressant  and  antipsychotic  agents 
[230,  231].  According  to  naturalistic  studies,  mood  stabi-
lizers  are  virtually  required  in  all  patients,  both  in  adults 
[207]  and  youths  [5].  Among  adult  patients,  up  to  42%  of 
patients have been reported to require a combination of mul-
tiple  mood  stabilizers,  usually  Lithium  plus  antiepileptics 
[207].  Accordingly,  comorbid  youths  are  more  frequently 
prescribed  with  mood  stabilizers  and  less  frequently  with 
antidepressant  monotherapy  with  respect  to  non-comorbid 
OCD patients [213]. Indeed, BD comorbidity in adults with 
OCD  has  been  associated  with  high  rates  of  drug-induced 
(hypo)  manic  switch  under  antidepressants  (39-61%)  [207, 
232],  especially  in  subjects  not  receiving  mood  stabilizers, 

with  greater  risks  posed  by  Clomipramine  compared  SSRIs 
[207]. Despite this, it is still not clear whether OCD comor-
bidity  in  BD  patients  directly  contributes  to  an  increase  in 
the risk of destabilization or whether only an increased expo-
sure  to  antidepressants  is  responsible  for  such  high  rates  of 
(hypo)manic switch.  

As  previously  hinted,  OCD-BD  comorbidity  in  children 
and  adolescents  has  been  related  to  non-response  to  usual 
treatment,  both  compared  to  non-comorbid  BD  and  OCD 
counterparts  [5,  233],  and  SGAs  are  required  in  more  than 
half of patients to manage comorbidity, suggesting a specific 
severity and treatment refractoriness [5]. Importantly, in two 
open-label trials, a greater efficacy of a combination of sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors with SGAs, namely Olanzapine and 
Risperidone,  was  observed  in  adult  patients  affected  by 
treatment-resistant  OCD  with  comorbid  BD,  respectively 
compared  to  non-comorbid  treatment-resistant  OCD  [234] 
and  subjects  affected  by  treatment-resistant  OCD  and 
comorbid  major  depression  [235].  Moreover,  two  random-
ized  controlled  trials  on  OCD-BD  comorbid  adult  patients, 
demonstrated that Aripiprazole and Quetiapine augmentation 
widely  exceeded  placebo  in  treating  obsessive  and  compul-
sive symptoms during manic episodes [228, 236].  

Based on these findings, mood stabilization should be the 
primary  focus  when  treating  OCD-BD  comorbidity.  When 
mood  stabilizing  treatment  has  been  titrated,  OCD-specific 
treatments  (i.e.,  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors)  may  be  em-
ployed, preferably at the lowest effective dose and carefully 
monitoring for (hypo)manic symptoms and affective instabil-
ity.  In  case  of  non-response  or  reduced  tolerability  (e.g., 
drug-induced  switch),  or  whenever  patients  show  unfavora-
ble  prognostic  features,  such  as  DBD  comorbidity  and/or 
compulsions  of  hoarding,  SGAs,  such  as  Aripiprazole, 
Risperidone  and  Quetiapine,  may  be  preferred,  respectively 
as  third-  or  second-choice  options.  Finally,  a  limited  sub-
group  of  comorbid  patients  may  require  a  combination  of 
multiple  treatments,  including  mood  stabilizers,  antidepres-
sants, and SGAs. 

9. EATING DISORDERS 

A  growing  literature  shows  that  ED  are  common  in  BD 
patients,  and  individuals  with  BD  have  an  increased  risk  of 
developing  ED  compared  to  the  general  population  [237]. 
Lifetime  prevalence  of  ED  in  the  general  population  is  ap-
proximately 3.8%, with lower rates (0.3-0.6%) for Anorexia 
Nervosa (AN), intermediate rates (1.5%) for Bulimia Nervo-
sa (BN), and slightly greater rates (2.3-2.8%) for Binge Eat-
ing  Disorder  (BED)  [238,  239].  A  higher  prevalence  of  ED 
was found by a recent meta-analysis in patients with BD: AN 
was reported in 3.8% of patients, BN in 7.4%, and BED oc-
curred in 12.5% [22]. On the other hand, a diagnosis of BD 
was  reported  in  2%  of  patients  with  AN,  6.7%  of  subjects 
with  BN,  and  9.1%  of  patients  with  BED.  Moreover,  com-
bined  results  from  five  studies  comparing  ED  rates  in  BD 
type  1  versus  type  2  suggested  that  ED  rates  are  similar 
across  BD  diagnoses  [22].  Of  note,  in  a  study  considering 
DSM-5  criteria  for  ED  and  BD  in  a  consecutive  sample  of 
1,092  bipolar  patients,  higher  rates  of  comorbidity  were  re-
ported,  as  27%  of  the  sample  satisfied  criteria  for  current 
ED, 12% for BED, 15% for BN, and 0.2% for AN [240].  

Pharmacotherapy of Bipolar Disorder and Comorbidities 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4    921 

According  to  adult  studies,  ED  with  binging/purging 
symptoms, such as BED, BN and binging/purging AN, show 
the  highest  prevalence  in  patients  with  BD  [241,  242].  In 
adolescents, subthreshold symptoms of binge eating or bing-
ing/purging are often reported, and, similarly, subsyndromal 
mood  symptoms  are  frequently  associated  with  ED  [243], 
underscoring the need to examine the full spectra of BD and 
ED  when  assessing  the  co-occurrence  of  these  syndromes. 
Indeed,  as  previously  observed  for  anxiety  disorders  and 
SUD, ED may precede the onset of BD in up to 41.4% of the 
ED-BD  cases  [244],  particularly  among  females  [245].  Im-
portantly,  depression  and  (hypo)mania  are  often  associated 
with changes in appetite and weight, partially mimicking the 
fluctuations  seen  among  people  with  ED.  However,  these 
fluctuations  should  be  distinguished  from  true  comorbidity 
between  BD  and  ED.  BD  patients  with  comorbid  ED  are 
more  frequently  females,  younger,  with  an  earlier  onset  of 
BD,  and  present  with  more  anxiety,  suicidality  and  mood 
instability,  higher  BMI,  more  frequent  obesity,  and  higher 
general medical burden [240]. The comorbidity is associated 
with worse illness course and outcome, and an increased risk 
of  additional  clinical  comorbidities,  including  alcohol  and 
substance use disorders [246, 247]. 

The etiological mechanisms of the overlap are relatively 
unknown  and  possibly  include  common  genetic  factors 
[248], as well as exposure to certain psychotropic medication 
inducing  ED  [249].  Importantly,  trait  impulsivity  and  emo-
tional  dysregulation  may  be  considered  shared  underlying 
traits  stemming  from  a  common  pathophysiological  basis, 
influencing the symptom expression of both disorders [246], 
closely related to the development of binging/purging behav-
iors [241], but also to comorbid alcohol/substance use disor-
der and suicidality [22, 246]. In this respect, BD and ED may 
be  viewed  as  part  of  the  same  neurodevelopmental  process 
affecting  emotional  regulation  and  impulse  control  abilities 
[22].  Further  research  is  warranted  to  evaluate  the  role  of 
emotional dysregulation as a precursor of ED-BD comorbidi-
ty and as a mediator of the relationship between each condi-
tion  across  the  lifespan.  Moreover,  differences  in  emotional 
dysregulation may help explain differences between BD pa-
tients  with  and  without  comorbid  ED,  including  those  ob-
served  in  gender,  personality  disorders  comorbidity,  mala-
daptive traits, rapid-cycling course, and suicidality, and may 
have relevant implications for future interventions [22, 245]. 

Patients  presenting  with  ED-BD  comorbidity  require 
specific treatment considerations [241]. Failure to recognize 
and treat BD comorbidity in patients with ED may negative-
ly  affect  the  management  of  their  conditions,  as  the  under-
treated BD symptomatology, including affective lability and 
impulsivity,  can  worsen  ED  symptoms  and  decrease  adher-
ence  to  treatments.  The  stabilization  of  affective  symptoms 
may  have  a  beneficial  impact  on  the  management  of  ED, 
improving  the  compliance  with  non-pharmacological  treat-
ments (i.e., familial-based interventions, psychotherapy, die-
tary interventions). While available evidence from RCT sup-
ports  the  efficacy  of  pharmacological  treatments  in  adoles-
cents  with  BD  [250],  the  evidence  of  the  efficacy  of  drug 
treatments  for  ED  has  been  mostly  weak  [251].  Hierarchy 
and treatment strategy should be based on symptom severity, 
although often ED may be hardly effectively managed with-

out improving clinically relevant depressive or manic symp-
toms.  

Starting  from  these  basic  considerations,  treatment  strate-
gies  should  consider  approaches  effective  for  each  syndrome 
without adversely impacting the other, by avoiding treatments 
having iatrogenic effects. SGAs are increasingly used in ado-
lescents  with  BD  [252,  253],  despite  significant  concerns  re-
garding  their  metabolic  side  effects  [250].  These  compounds 
are  also  often  used  in  AN,  although  empirical  evidence  is 
scarce  [254,  255].  Moreover,  in  patients  with  BN  or  BED, 
SGAs,  can  worsen  binge  eating  behaviors  and  favor  weight 
gain.  Antipsychotic  medications  may,  indeed,  disrupt  signal-
ing  of  neurotransmitters  (e.g.,  serotonin)  and  hormones  (e.g., 
leptin  and  ghrelin)  associated  with  the  regulation  of  hunger, 
raising  appetite  and  increasing  the  risk  of  weight  gain  [256, 
257].  Weight  gain,  by  itself,  may  worsen  eating  behaviors 
both in BN/BED and AN. Both BN and BED are often associ-
ated  with  obesity,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  related  metabolic 
disorders,  hampering  the  management  of  comorbid  BD  with 
SGAs [258]. Finally, the significant cardiovascular risk asso-
ciated  with  antipsychotic  treatment  should  be  carefully  con-
sidered  when  these  medications  are  administered  to  patients 
with ED and deteriorated physical conditions [259]. 

On  the  other  hand,  antidepressants,  particularly  Fluoxe-
tine, have been widely used in the treatment of BN and BED 
in  randomized,  placebo-controlled  trials  [260,  261],  while 
low  evidence  supports  their  efficacy  in  AN  [262].  In  these 
patients,  who  frequently  present  with  associated  osteoporo-
sis,  the  increase  in  fracture  risk  observed  in  youths  treated 
with  antidepressants  should  be  taken  into  account  [263]. 
Moreover, these medications should be considered very cau-
tiously in patients with BD, given the risk of emergent (hy-
po)manic  switch  or  acute  worsening  of  manic  symptoms  
[264], even when associated with mood stabilizers [265].  

Failure to recognize hypomanic symptoms in patients with 
ED, especially in BD type 2 patients with comorbid BN, may 
result  in  the  prescription  of  antidepressant  monotherapy,  ex-
posing  to  a  further  increase  of  affective  lability,  excitement 
and  impulse  dyscontrol,  often  co-occurring  in  BN  and  BED 
[266]. As for anxiety disorders, differentiating BD from major 
depressive disorder in adolescents is critical, since the recogni-
tion  of  previous  (hypo)manic  episodes  may  prevent  the  risks 
associated  with  the  use  of  antidepressants  (e.g.,  increased 
mood instability, impulsivity, and suicidality). 

Unfortunately,  mood  stabilizers  and  anticonvulsants  have 
not had a large role in the treatment of ED, and only limited 
evidence  is  available,  mostly  from  adult  studies.  Lithium  re-
sulted effective in a small placebo-controlled trial in the treat-
ment of AN [267], while both Lithium [268] and Carbamaze-
pine  [269]  failed  to  exceed  placebo  in  BN.  However,  add-on 
Lithium  to  Topiramate  resulted  in  improvement  of  affective 
symptoms,  weight  loss  and  binge  frequency  in  BED  patients 
[270]. Topiramate was found effective in the treatment of BN 
[271]  and  BED  [272],  but  its  efficacy  in  BD  is  still  poorly 
supported by evidence, both in adolescents [273], and in adults 
[274].  In  addition,  treatment-emergent  (hypo)manic  switches 
have  been  reported  in  adult  patients  treated  with  Topiramate 
[275].  Finally,  Zonisamide,  an  anticonvulsant  agent,  showed 
positive  effects  on  BED  and  obesity  [276,  277],  though  its 
efficacy in BD has not been supported [278].

Table 1.   Summary of review findings. 

Comorbid Condition 

Main Recommendations 

MPH is greatly effective in improving ADHD core symptoms and emotional dysregulation with non-significant adverse ef-
fects, low risk of (hypo)manic switch and possible beneficial effects on suicidality 

ATX is effective in improving ADHD core symptoms with ongoing mood stabilizers (e.g., with Valproic Acid), but has the 
potential but still debated risk of inducing (hypo)manic switches and suicidality  

ADHD 

A two-step treatment approach is recommended with mood stabilizers prescription preceding the treatment of ADHD symp-
toms to prevent mood destabilization, especially in BD type 1 

MPH should be considered as first-line treatment option, followed by ATX when MPH is ineffective or contraindicated; other 
stimulants can be also effective after mood stabilization 

ADHD medications may be contraindicated in youths with comorbid substance use disorder, especially when ADHD symp-
toms are simulated or exaggerated to obtain stimulants for diversion or abuse 

No medications are currently approved in US for CD, while Risperidone is approved in Europe for aggression; evidence favors 
antipsychotics over mood stabilizers for treating mania 

DBD 

Lithium may be effective on aggression in CD, and the successful treatment of BD can mitigate CD symptoms, though comor-
bid CD is a predictor of non-response to both Lithium and Valproic Acid 

SGAs show similar efficacy in treating mania and aggression, but Quetiapine is more effective on anxiety, depression, and 
suicidality, while metabolic changes are more evident with Risperidone 

Lithium is the only treatment with positive results in a randomized-controlled study of adolescents; Valproic Acid add-on may 
be considered for AUD, based on adult trials 

SUD 

Quetiapine and Aripiprazole showed limited benefits in adult AUD; Citicoline and Gabapentin are promising options, respec-
tively, for cocaine dependence and CUD 

ASD 

Prevention of SUD should be the focus of treatment in patients with multiple risk factors; in high-risk patients a mood stabi-
lizer may be introduced before the onset of full-blown BD 

Pharmacological treatment does not address ASD core symptoms but rather targets challenging behaviors; the presence of 
comorbidity does not impact the rate of response to irritability 

Lithium may be effective for mood swings, (hypo)manic symptoms, impulsivity, and irritability, while VPA is the anticonvul-
sant with the largest evidence in the comorbid condition 

Risperidone and Aripiprazole are currently approved for treating irritability and aggression and are particularly indicated when 
impulsive aggression is prominent 

Mood stabilizers may be preferable especially when aggression is limited; antipsychotics should be used at the lowest effective 
dose and for the strictly necessary periods to minimize adverse effects 

The use of antidepressants is supported, though with associated specific increased risk of (hypo)mania, which requires closely 
monitoring of irritability and suicidality 

Anxiety Disorders 

Mood stabilizers with anxiolytic properties should be first considered in youths (Valproic Acid, Gabapentin) 

OCD 

ED 

In the short-term Quetiapine and Olanzapine may exhibit greater beneficial effects on anxiety compared to antiepileptics  

Antidepressants should be given at the lowest effective dose with careful monitoring of (hypo)manic symptoms due to high 
rates of switches, especially with Clomipramine 

Mood stabilizers, even in combination (e.g., Lithium and antiepileptics), are required in virtually all patients; BD should be the 
primary focus of pharmacological treatment 

SGAs are required in case of complex comorbidity, high severity, and refractoriness in more than half of patients; Olanzapine, 
Risperidone, Aripiprazole and Quetiapine are available treatment options 

A combination of mood stabilizers, antidepressants and SGAs may be indicated for selected patients 

Stabilization of affective symptoms may have a beneficial impact on eating behaviors, but the choice of effective approaches 
for each syndrome should consider avoiding iatrogenic effects on the other 

Antidepressants (i.e., Fluoxetine) should be given with caution due to increased risk of (hypo)manic switch, affective instabil-
ity, impulsivity, and suicidality, even when prescribed with mood stabilizers 

Among mood stabilizers, Lithium may be effective in AN; Topiramate and Zonisamide have shown some efficacy for treating 
BED, but their use in BD is controversial 

SGAs should be avoided for their disruptive effects on hunger regulation, increased weight gain and dysfunctional eating be-
haviors, along with negative metabolic and cardiovascular effects

CONCLUSION 

BD  is  a  highly  comorbid  condition,  and  rates  of  co-
occurring disorders are even higher in youth. Comorbid disor-
ders strongly affect clinical presentation, natural course, prog-
nosis, and treatment. Associations between BD and comorbid 
disorders  define  specific  conditions  which  are  not  simply  a 
sum  of  different  clinical  pictures,  but  rather  occur  as  distinct 
and complex combinations with specific developmental path-
ways  over  time.  These  conditions  require  close  attention  to 
pharmacological treatments, with positive and negative impli-
cations (Table 1). The positive implications are related to the 
possible improvement of the whole clinical picture by address-
ing the comorbid condition rather than BD itself. The negative 
implication  is  the  possible  worsening  of  BD  following  phar-
macological  treatment  of  comorbidities  (e.g.,  manic  switches 
after antidepressants, depressive episodes or emotional flatten-
ing after antipsychotic treatments). Specific studies addressing 
the pharmacological management of BD and comorbidities are 
still scarce, and information is particularly lacking in children 
and  adolescents.  For  this  reason,  this  review  included  also 
studies with adult patients. Unfortunately, treatment strategies 
are  often  based  on  personal  experiences  or  expert  opinions. 
Developmentally  sensitive  controlled  clinical  trials  are  thus 
warranted  to  improve  the  prognosis  of  these  highly  complex 
patients, requiring timely and finely personalized therapies.
