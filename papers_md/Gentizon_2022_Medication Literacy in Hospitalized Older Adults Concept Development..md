Medication Literacy in Hospitalized Older Adults:  
Concept Development

Jenny Gentizon, MSc; Emilie Bovet, PhD; Elise Rapp, MSc; and Cedric Mabire, PhD

ABSTRACT

Background:  Medication  literacy  encompasses  the  cognitive  and  social  skills  necessary  for  individuals  to 
obtain,  comprehend,  communicate,  calculate,  and  process  medication-related  information  necessary  to 
make informed decisions. Personal and contextual factors are widely recognized to influence the way that 
individuals acquire and maintain medication literacy skills. Despite a growing number of studies on medica-
tion literacy, current definitions remain general, lacking consideration for the specificities of older adults and 
hospitalization. Objective: The project was conducted to identify, compare, and summarize the attributes, 
antecedents, and consequences of medication literacy in hospitalized older adults and to propose a refined 
definition. Methods: A three-phase hybrid model of concept development was performed that included a 
literature review and focus groups with hospital nurses. In the final analytic phase, findings from the literature 
and focus groups were compared, and a refined definition of the concept was elaborated. Key Results: From 
the synthesis of 24 publications and the narrative data of 14 hospital nurses, 19 themes were described: 4 
related to attributes, 8 to antecedents, and 7 to consequences. Medication literacy of hospitalized older adults 
has been further defined as the degree to which older adults and/or their natural caregivers can develop and 
maintain multidimensional skills, namely functional, interactive, and critical medication literacy skills. Adjust-
ment of these skills is characterized by a dynamic and potentially complex process. In practice, optimal medi-
cation literacy might be achieved through control of and involvement in the medication regimen and the 
decisions related to it, and/or by using practical means to facilitate medication self-management (e.g., using 
lists, notes, reminders). Conclusions: The proposed refined definition might enhance professionals’ common 
understanding of the concept and its application in practice, policy, and research. Managing a medication 
regimen is a complex activity that requires a high level of integration and coordination of cognitive and social 
skills. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2022;6(2):e70–e83.]

Plain  Language  Summary:  Based  on  the  literature  on  medication  literacy  and  the  experiences  of  nurses 
working in hospitals, this article defines medication literacy in hospitalized older adults. This definition will 
help  professionals  to  better  understand  challenges  related  to  medication  literacy  in  older  patients  and  to 
propose adequate support (i.e., provide education, simplify medication prescriptions, propose practical aids 
such as a pillbox).

People who take medications must deal with a group of 
medication-related information and instructions from nu-
merous  sources  that  vary  in  quality  and  reliability  (Ng  et 
al.,  2017).  Medication  literacy  encompasses  the  cognitive 
and  social  skills  necessary  for  individuals  to  obtain,  com-
prehend, communicate, calculate, and process medication-
related information necessary to make informed decisions 
(King et al., 2011; Pouliot et al., 2018). Frequent synonyms 
include  “pharmacotherapy  literacy”  (King  et  al.,  2011; 
Krajnovic  et  al.,  2019a;  Krajnovic  et  al.,  2019b;  Pouliot  & 

Vaillancourt, 2016; Pouliot et al., 2018; Ubavić et al., 2018), 
“pharmacy  health  literacy”  (O’Neal  et  al.,  2013;  Pouliot  & 
Vaillancourt, 2016; Pouliot et al., 2018) and “pharmaceuti-
cal literacy” (Krajnovic et al., 2019a; Vervloet et al., 2018). 
Derived from health literacy, medication literacy specifical-
ly targets medication-related skills: how to interpret medi-
cation  dosing  and  measurements,  how  to  read  labels  and 
understand  instructions,  and  what  actions  to  take  in  case 
of a missed dose or the occurrence of side effects (Sauceda 
et al., 2012; Yeh et al., 2017). With sufficient medication lit-

eracy skills, people can understand and follow through with 
medication information, which in turn may positively influ-
ence therapeutic adherence and prevent medication-related 
problems (Bailey et al., 2013; Chesser et al., 2016; Mira et 
al., 2015; Sauceda et al., 2012; Shrank et al., 2007). 

Although medication literacy is considered a research 
priority  in  medication  safety  internationally  (Sheikh  et 
al., 2019), findings of recent systematic reviews on exist-
ing  definitions  of  this  concept  and  instruments  used  to 
measure  it  revealed  inconsistencies  across  studies  con-
cerning the essential skills of medication literacy (i.e., at-
tributes) (Gentizon et al., 2021; Pantuzza et al., 2020). 

Despite  a  recent  and  important  definition  that  ad-
opted  an  international  perspective  (Pouliot  et  al.,  2018), 
additional  research  is  necessary  to  clarify  the  core  char-
acteristics  of  medication  literacy  and  to  propose  a  more 
operational definition. Moreover, the current definitions 
of medication literacy fail to consider the specificities of 
older adults and/or multimorbidity, as the co-occurrence 
of multiple chronic health conditions within one person 
(Gentizon  et  al.,  2021;  Koroukian  et  al.,  2015;  Pantuzza 
et  al.,  2020).  Individual  factors  that  potentially  interfere 
with  older  adults’  performance  in  using  medication  and 
that have been shown to be associated with worse medi-
cation management include poor vision and declining at-
tention, working and prospective memory, and executive 
functions (Advinha et al., 2017; Elliott et al., 2015; Leat et 
al., 2016; Stilley et al., 2010). In addition, multimorbidity 
adds  a  layer  of  complexity  to  the  capacity  of  patients  to 

understand,  manage,  and  monitor  their  health  (Shippee 
et al., 2012). 

Yet, these individual factors are not the only contribu-
tors  to  the  acquisition  and  maintenance  of  sufficient 
medication  literacy  skills,  as  these  skills  are  also  influ-
enced by the way that health care services are organized 
and  delivered  (King  et  al.,  2011;  Raynor,  2009).  Periods 
of transition of care, namely, hospital admission and dis-
charge are also points of considerable weakness regarding 
these  skills.  During  the  hospital  stay,  rather  than  being 
simplified, medication prescriptions are often made more 
complex;  patients’  orders  are  rewritten,  new  medicines 
are  initiated,  and  medication  handoffs  remain  incom-
plete  (Nobili  et  al.,  2011;  Shelton  et  al.,  2012;  Verloo  et 
al., 2017). After discharge, patients typically feel insuffi-
ciently  informed  about  their  medications  (Elliott  et  al., 
2015; Hain et al., 2012; Holland et al., 2011). It is there-
fore  essential  to  move  beyond  an  individual  focus  and 
recognize  the  importance  of  the  health  care  context  in 
the acquisition and maintenance of sufficient medication 
literacy  skills  (King  et  al.,  2011;  Raynor,  2009).  Despite 
widespread recognition of the contextual factors that in-
fluence these skills (King et al., 2011; Raynor, 2008, 2009), 
a summary of the antecedents and potential consequences 
related to medication literacy remains to be undertaken. 
Therefore,  in  this  study,  we  aimed  to  identify,  com-
pare,  and  summarize  the  attributes,  antecedents,  and 
consequences of medication literacy in hospitalized older 
adults, as well as to propose a refined definition.

(i.e.,  attributes,  antecedents, 
consequences).  Therefore,  we 
excluded  conference  abstracts 
and  posters.  In  addition,  pub-
lications exploring medication 
literacy  in  health  care  profes-
sionals were not considered for 
this study. An expert librarian 
was  consulted  for  the  search 
strategy,  including  the  choice 
of  key  words  and  databases. 
The  search  was  conducted  in 
Embase,  MEDLINE  via  Ovid, 
PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO 
via  Ovid,  Web  of  Science  Core  Collection,  and  Google 
Scholar with following key words: “literacy” or “illiteracy” 
in combination with “medication,” “pharmacy,” “pharma-
ceutical,”  “drug,”  “treatment,”  “medicine,”  “prescription,” 
and  “pharmacotherapy.”  The  main  investigator  (J.G.) 
screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to select relevant 
literature by using Rayyan software (Ouzzani et al., 2016). 
The search was updated through March 23, 2020.

Fieldwork Phase: Focus Groups 

Empirical  data  were  collected  to  complete  the  litera-
ture  and  to  expand  the  concept  of  medication  literacy 
to  the  target  population  (i.e.,  older  adults  in  the  context 
of  hospitalization).  Focus  group  data  collection  method 
with  nurses  was  chosen  because  it  allows  several  pro-
fessionals  in  permanent  contact  with  older  patients  to 
discuss  situations  and  concepts  together.  Therefore, 
three consecutive focus groups with nurses were held in 
2018  in  a  university  hospital  and  a  regional  hospital  in 
French-speaking Switzerland. Hospital nurses involved in 
information  and/or  education  of  older  patients  for  self-
medication  management  were  invited  to  participate.  A 
purposeful  sampling  approach  was  used  to  select  nurses 
with  maximum  variation  in  terms  of  experience,  educa-
tional status, professional role, and field of practice. The 
moderator (J.G.) began each focus group by presenting a 
vignette  that  illustrated  challenges  in  medication  litera-
cy  faced  by  an  older  male  patient  admitted  to  hospital. 
An  open-ended  interview  guide  was  then  used,  moving 
from broader questions to those that targeted medication 
literacy  attributes,  antecedents,  and  consequences.  Data 
collection was conducted until no new substantive infor-
mation was found. The dialogue in each focus group was 
recorded  (±60  minutes)  and  transcribed  verbatim.  Prior 
to each focus group, information about the research and

METHOD 
Study Design

The design was a hybrid method of concept develop-
ment that aims to dissect a concept into simpler elements 
(i.e.,  attributes,  antecedents,  consequences)  to  promote 
clarity  and  mutual  understanding  among  health  profes-
sionals and researchers (Schwartz-Barcott, 2000). In this 
method,  findings  from  the  literature  and  empirical  data 
are combined to refine a definition of the concept of in-
terest.  As  nurses’  viewpoints  and  their  understanding  of 
the meaning of medication literacy have never been pub-
lished, in this study, we aimed to perform a literature re-
view  and  to  conduct  focus  groups  with  hospital  nurses. 
Three  phases  were  undertaken  as  a  recursive  process: 
theoretical, fieldwork, and analytical (Figure 1). 

Data Collection

The  data  collection  phase  corresponded  to  Points 
1  and  2  of  the  theoretical  and  fieldwork  phases,  as  de-
scribed in Figure 1.

Theoretical Phase: Literature Review 

The first part of this study was conducted as a litera-
ture review. A preliminary scoping search was conducted 
to explore the most applicable keywords. It appeared the 
literature  specific  to  older  adults  and/or  the  context  of 
hospitalization  was  limited  to  three  publications  (Miner 
et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2016). Thus, 
a  comprehensive  literature  search  focused  on  the  adult 
population older than age 18 years, regardless of type of 
medication.  No  restriction  was  placed  on  the  setting  or 
on  the  year  of  publication.  Inclusion  criteria  concerned 
any  published  manuscripts  of  primary  research  studies 
and  theoretical  reports  written  in  English.  All  included 
publications had to provide a definition of medication lit-
eracy and/or valuable content about its internal structure

Data Extraction and Analysis 
Theoretical Phase: Literature Review  

The  use  of  qualitative  research  techniques  to  analyze 
literature  has  the  potential  to  increase  transparency  and 
reduce  bias  (Whittemore  &  Knafl,  2005).  Thus,  the  main 
investigator  (J.G.)  performed  an  in-depth  examination 
of  the  full  text  of  each  publication.  Words  or  phrases  that 
represented  antecedents,  attributes,  and  consequences  of 

medication  literacy  were  coded  in  accordance  with  a  pre-
determined  coding  scheme  (Table  1)  (DeCuir-Gunby  et 
al., 2011). The information was reported on a standardized 
form  that  included  (1)  study  design  or  publication  type, 
(2)  concept and definition, (3) target or  study  population, 
(4) setting/context, (5) country, and (6) attributes, anteced-
ents, and consequences. A second investigator (E.R.) inde-
pendently  coded  10%  of  the  literature,  and  discrepancies 
were  discussed  to  reach  agreement.  The  data  corpus  was 
then subjected to thematic analysis (J.G.) followed by cross-
checking  by  a  second  investigator  (E.R.),  and  preliminary

themes were adjusted until agreement was reached (Braun 
& Clarke, 2006).

Fieldwork Phase: Focus Groups 

From  the  semantic  level,  the  main  investigator  (J.G.) 
coded  the  transcribed  data  in  MAXQDA  software  in  ac-
cordance  with  the  predetermined  coding  scheme  (Table 
1). A second investigator (E.B.) independently coded 10% 
of  transcripts  from  each  focus  group,  and  discrepancies 
were discussed until agreement was reached. The extract-
ed  verbatim  transcripts  related  to  attributes,  antecedents, 
and  consequences  were  subjected  to  thematic  analysis  by 
the  main  investigator  (J.G.).  The  initial  subthemes  and 
themes were discussed and refined with a second investi-
gator (E.B.) until consensus was achieved (Braun & Clarke, 
2006).

Analytical Phase: Synthesis of the Findings 

In the analytical phase, we compared the initial themes 
derived from the literature and from the focus groups (J.G., 
E.R.,  E.B.).  Similar  themes  from  both  data  sources  were 
clustered into common themes and renamed to accurately 
reflect the data set as a whole. This article presents a syn-
thesis of the findings; each theme is supported by a selec-
tion of relevant segments from the literature and verbatim 
transcripts from focus groups. In addition, we elaborated 
a refined definition of medication literacy in hospitalized 
older patients that was driven by the essential elements of 
the definition that we identified, namely its attributes. 

The  scientific  rigor  of  this  research  was  supported  by 
the prolonged engagement of different investigators (J.G., 
E.R., E.B.) with the data corpus. To enhance the sense that 
we made of the statements and to favor credibility, we pre-
sented  and  discussed  the  findings  with  five  nurse  scien-
tists  who  had  expertise  in  hospital  discharge  preparation 
(Lincoln & Guba, 1986). 

RESULTS 
Theoretical Phase: Literature Review

Among  the  388  publications  identified  after  dedupli-
cation,  77  were  selected  for  full-text  screening.  After  we 
screened them for eligibility criteria, 24 publications were 
included in the final analysis (Figure A). Publication dates 
ranged from 2008 to 2020. Detailed characteristics of the 
included  publications  and  the  definitions  found  in  each 
are reported in the supplementary material (Table A). The 
coding of words or phrases found in the publications ac-
counted for 481 segments that were clustered into 15 pre-
liminary themes.

Fieldwork Phase: Focus Groups

Fourteen nurses, with a median professional experience 
of 15 years (minimum-maximum = 3-14), from two hospitals 
in French-speaking Switzerland participated in the study. The 
individual  characteristics  of  the  participants  were  collected 
at  the  beginning  of  each  focus  group  (Table  2).  Coding  of 
the transcribed data led to 490 verbatim extracts, which were 
clustered into 19 preliminary themes.  

Analytical Phase: Attributes, Antecedents, and 
Consequences Across Both Data Sources

The  comparison  of  preliminary  themes,  respectively,  15 
from the literature and 19 from the focus groups, converged 
toward 15 similar themes while four additional themes only 
emerged from the analysis of focus groups (i.e., two attributes, 
two consequences). Therefore, a synthesis of the findings in-
tegrated 19 themes, 4 related to attributes, 8 to antecedents, 
and 7 to consequences (Table 3). The results are displayed in 
the form of concept mapping (Figure 2). 

Attributes  

One  common  theme  was  predominant  across  both  data 
corpora: the presence of functional, interactive, and critical 
medication literacy skills, as derived from Nutbeam’s dimen-
sions  of  health  literacy  (2000).  Functional  medication  lit-
eracy skills encompass the skills to prepare, self-administer, 
and monitor the effects of medication, and having a grasp on 
medication  names  is  an  important  indicator  of  these  skills, 
as  reflected  by  hospital  nurses:  “the  name  of  the  medicines 
… very often they don’t know the name, they only know the 
box,  the  color,  the  color  of  the  pill”  (Focus  Group  [FG]  1, 
university hospital [UH]). In the literature, functional skills 
rely on the ability not only to know medication information 
(Zhong et al., 2016), but also to comprehend what was read 
or said about a medication (i.e., instructions) (Sauceda et al., 
2012;  Vervloet  et  al.,  2018)  and  to  remember  it  (Shi  et  al., 
2019;  Zhong  et  al.,  2016),  to  calculate  the  correct  dose  and 
dosing intervals (Pouliot et al., 2018; Sauceda et al., 2012; Yeh 
et  al.,  2017),  to  follow  through  on  medication  instructions 
(Sauceda et al., 2012), and to observe adverse reactions (Shi 
et al., 2019). Interactive medication literacy skills refer to the 
ability of a patient to actively interact with health care provid-
ers,  which  includes  asking  for  information  when  questions 
arise or expressing concerns (Pouliot et al., 2018; Vervloet et 
al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2017), discussing their health condition 
(Raynor, 2009), and engaging in shared decisions (Vervloet et 
al., 2018). During hospitalization, “some people are interest-
ed, asking what we are preparing as a treatment, what is it for, 
if it is new, why it is being introduced” (FG1, UH). Critical

medication literacy skills apply to analyzing information and 
using it to exert greater control and to solve problems. This 
continuous actualization of knowledge is an important step: 
“If you’re a little up-to-date on things, you get critical, too” 
(FG1, UH). Patients with critical skills are able to seek addi-
tional information (Shreffler-Grant et al., 2013; Ubavić et al., 
2018) from reputable sources (Shreffler-Grant et al., 2013), to 
critically  evaluate its quality  (Zhang et  al.,  2021), to handle 
contradictory information (Vervloet et al., 2018), and to ana-
lyze whether it is applicable to one’s own situation (Vervloet 
et al., 2018). Consequently, people can make informed medi-
cation and health decisions (Shi et al., 2019; Shreffler-Grant 
et  al.,  2013),  such  as  selecting  appropriate  products  when 
choosing  over-the-counter  medication  (O’Neal  et  al.,  2013) 
and taking appropriate actions when a problem arises (e.g., 
in case of a missed dose) (Pouliot et al., 2018; Ubavić et al., 
2018). 

The  development  of  medication  literacy  skills  is  chal-
lenged by a constellation of medication information present-
ed  to  patients,  notably  basic  information  (e.g.,  medication

cautions  (i.e.,  contraindications,  potential  side  effects,  in-
teractions) (King et al., 2011). In addition, hospital nurses 
expect  patients  “to  link  the  medication  to  the  symptoms” 
(FG2,  UH).  Medication  information  concerns  prescribed 
(Zhong et al., 2019) and nonprescribed medication (Sayek-
ti et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021), such as over-the-counter 
(Sayekti  et  al.,  2018;  Zhang  et  al.,  2021)  and  complemen-
tary medicine (Shreffler-Grant et al., 2013) used by patients 
in various galenic forms, and it includes measuring devices 
(e.g.,  syringe,  cup,  measuring  spoon)  (King  et  al.,  2011; 
Sauceda et al., 2012; Stilley et al., 2014; Ubavić et al., 2018). 
Specific to medication information is the presence of num-

Attributes are the defining characteristics of medication literacy in hospitalized older adults. Antecedents precede the instance of medication 
literacy or are associated with it. Consequences are the outcomes of sufficient or insufficient medication literacy skills.  

bers (e.g., units, number of tablets, dosing intervals, dosing 
by weight (Sauceda et al., 2012; Yeh et al., 2017). All of this 
information  is  conveyed  in  a  broad  range  of  material  and 
documents, such as prescription lists, educational materials, 
and leaflets (Sauceda et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2021; Zheng 
et al., 2017); through different formats (e.g., oral; written; vi-
sual images, symbols, and pictograms (Pouliot et al., 2018; 
Zhong et al., 2016); and from multiple sources that may vary 
in quality and reliability (Ng et al., 2017; Ubavić et al., 2018). 
More specific to older adults, hospital nurses emphasized 
the  importance  of  considering  informal  caregivers,  often  a 
family member who provides care in the home environment 
usually without payment, to someone with whom they have 
a personal relationship (i.e., aging parent, spouse, or unre-
lated person) (National Research Council, 2010). The hospi-
tal nurses recognized the importance of medication literacy 
skills in the informal caregivers who are responsible for the 
preparation  of  medicine  and/or  its  administration  to  their 
relative:  “Often  the  wife  is  found  to  follow  the  treatment 
better; even without [patient’s] cognitive problems, the wife 
will manage everything and knows” (FG3, regional hospital 
[RH]).  When  providing  information  and  counselling,  hos-
pital  nurses  acknowledge  the  importance  of  their  involve-
ment: “If the wife is in charge, then we discuss it together; we 
inform them of the changes, with the patient as well” (FG2, 
UH).

In practice, hospital nurses relied on observable and sub-
jective  indicators  of  medication  literacy  such  as  the  mani-
festation of control and involvement and the use of practical 
means to facilitate medication self-management. The greater 

the  degree  of  control  and  involvement  of  older  patients  in 
the medication management process during hospitalization, 
the more nurses perceive a high level of medication literacy. 
“The one that shows hyper-control [high level of control]: ‘I 
don’t take generics because it works less well. It is my medi-
cation, take my box, it is my brand and not Torasis [brand-
name  medication]  instead  of  Torasemide  [generic  medica-
tion]”  (FG1,  UH).  In  contrast,  lower  medication  literacy 
may manifest as passiveness: “We try to explain the changes 
in the treatment plan; they say: ‘you’re the one who knows’” 
(FG1, UH). In addition, the practical means (i.e., using lists, 
notes, reminders) that are developed by patients to facilitate 
their  medication  self-management  routine  are  regarded  by 
nurses as indicators of their level of medication literacy and 
autonomy:  If  “they  arrive  at  the  hospital  with  their  [own] 
medication, if they have a routine … how they bring them 
(medicines), if it is in a pillbox, who is preparing it. I would 
worry about that”; “they have their list [of medicines]; “they 
write down on their [medication] boxes (FG2, UH).

Antecedents

Analysis  of  the  literature  and  of  the  focus  groups  con-
verged toward the same emerging antecedents, which were 
classified as characteristics of individuals, of the medication 
regimen, and of the health care system (Figure 2). 

At  the  individual  characteristics  level,  the  knowledge 
base  acquired  through  formal  education,  occupation,  and 
experiences, such as familiarity with medical issues (Miner 
et al., 2018) and background health knowledge (Sayekti et al., 
2018; Shi et al., 2019), influence the way that people engage 

e76

HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice • Vol. 6, No. 2, 2022

in updating their medication literacy skills: “My mother is a 
medical doctor, she is engaged because she trusts her knowl-
edge and wants to take charge of her medication” (FG2, UH). 
Notably,  confidence  in  reading,  writing,  and  speaking  (i.e., 
literacy) (King et al., 2011; Raynor, 2009; Shi et al., 2019; Yeh 
et al., 2017), the time an individual requires to learn (Min-
er  et  al.,  2018),  and  his/her  memory  abilities  (Zhong  et  al., 
2019)  pave  the  way  for  the  cognitive  efforts  that  a  patient 
must  demonstrate  to  acquire  sufficient  medication  literacy 
skills (King et al., 2011). Focus groups revealed that illiteracy 
is  still  observed  in  practice  “[the  wife  said]:  You  know  my 
husband,  he  can’t  read”  (FG1,  UH).  Other  personal  factors 
(e.g.,  age,  gender,  location  of  residence,  socioeconomic  sta-
tus)  were  commonly  found  in  studies  to  describe  patients’ 
profiles associated with medication literacy (Ma et al., 2020; 
Miner  et  al.,  2018;  Niehaus,  2014;  Raynor,  2009;  Sayekti  et 
al., 2018; Shi et al., 2019; Shreffler-Grant et al., 2013; Yeh et 
al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 
2016). These factors were grouped together under life story 
and  background  to  underscore  existing  interindividual  dif-
ferences in adjusting medication literacy skills: “We don’t all 
have the same baggage” (FG3, RH); “there’s the person’s [life] 
story too, who he is. Basically, as a farmer [in reference to the 
vignette presented], maybe he wasn’t used to asking anyone 
more questions than that” (FG1, UH); “the future generation 
will be much more invested, involved in their health” (FG3, 
RH). Hospital nurses underlined that social background, and 
the demographic, economic and cultural factors may inter-
fere with older adults’ attitudes towards medication, and their 
confidence to interact with healthcare providers.

Although some previous antecedents remain more stable 
over the life course, others may fluctuate by means of advanc-
es and setbacks, particularly in older adults. As people age, 
they  change  in  a  myriad  of  ways,  both  biological  and  psy-
chological. The decline in capacities and resources with aging 
explains how changes in cognition (e.g., speed of information 
processing, attention, memory) (Stilley et al., 2014; Zheng et 
al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2016), a decline in sensory and percep-
tual abilities (Sayekti et al., 2018), and fatigue prevent older 
individuals  from  enhancing  their  medication  literacy  skills: 
“We  are  talking  about  the  elderly  who  may  have  cognitive 
problems  that  set  in,  with  memory  problems,  forgetting  to 
take medication or taking twice the medication” (FG3, RH). 
Moreover, the health and illness trajectory describes how the 
presence  of  comorbidities,  side  effects  of  medication,  and 
deterioration  in  clinical  condition  alter  cognitive,  physical, 
emotional,  and  social  functioning  (Niehaus,  2014;  Pouliot 
& Vaillancourt, 2016; Shi et al., 2019; Shreffler-Grant et al., 
2013),  more  often  found  during  hospitalization:  “He’s  got 

heart  failure,  there’s  chronic  fatigue  that  followed  that,  and 
the Metoprolol that slows [you] down and makes you tired” 
(FG2,  UH).  Thus,  hospitalization  hinders  patients’  capacity 
to acquire new medication information “because you’re dis-
tressed by the hospitalization; on top of that you’re also a little 
bit cognitively impaired, so you have to restart all this” (FG1, 
UH). 

At  the  level  of  the  medication  regimen  characteristics, 
medication  prescription  complexity,  characterized  by  the 
number  of  prescribed  medications  at  discharge  (Zhong  et 
al.,  2019),  potentially  taken  several  times  a  day  and  requir-
ing  multistep  directions  (Miner  et  al.,  2018;  Stilley  et  al., 
2014; Vervloet et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2019), was a notable 
antecedent  that  interfered  with  patient  attempts  to  achieve 
appropriate  their  medication  literacy  skills.  Particularly 
found  during  hospitalization,  medication  revisions  lead  to 
the  introduction  of  new  medicines  and  the  suppression  of 
existing  medications,  contributing  to  the  complexity  of  the 
medication regimen: “That’s another flag, it’s the medication 
changes. . . .when you change a lot of things, they are lost” 
(FG1, UH). Moreover, the perceived adequacy of the medi-
cine  prescription,  namely  the  importance  of  taking  medi-
cines in relation to one’s own health situation and life goals, 
acts as a precondition for individuals to take steps to adjust 
their skills. Individuals are more likely to adopt new practices 
when they feel that this will also benefit them (O’Neal et al., 
2013),  if  they  perceive  the  necessity  of  the  medication  (Shi 
et al., 2019), and if it corresponds to their cultural and reli-
gious rationales (Miner et al., 2018; Niehaus, 2014). For older 
adults, their clinical situation is also an important feature in 
making sense of their medicine: “Calcium, is that really nec-
essary? Does it make a difference at my age?” (FG2, UH); “the 
patient  can  say  ‘me  with  what  I  am  experiencing  [cancer], 
the prevention of osteoporosis I do not care, I do not want it 
[medication] at all’” (FG1, UH).

The  health  care  system  characteristics  underline  that 
medication  literacy  becomes  relevant  only  if  patients  are 
presented with information that can be interpreted and un-
derstood. Promoting a better literacy for all (Raynor, 2009) 
relies on competencies and practices of health care providers 
in terms of training skills and experience to deal with differ-
ent levels of medication literacy (Zhong et al., 2016), commu-
nication across a variety of challenging scenarios (O’Neal et 
al., 2013), and education of vulnerable patients (Miner et al., 
2018).  Good  practices  include  literacy-sensitive  techniques 
(e.g., Teach Back, AskMe3 program, plain language) (Pouliot 
& Vaillancourt, 2016), partnership and exchange (O’Neal et 
al.,  2013;  Raynor,  2008),  easy-to-read-and-navigate  written 
material (i.e., larger font size, shorter sentences written at the

fifth-  to  eight-grade  levels)  (Vervloet  et  al.,  2018;  Zheng  et 
al., 2017), and individualized educational strategies (Miner et 
al., 2018; Vervloet et al., 2018): “That’s what real therapeutic 
education is: you start from what the patient needs, how he 
sees his life, how he has built it, how it fits into his life” (FG1, 
UH). Beyond professional competencies, medication literacy 
is influenced by the way the healthcare system is organized 
and how health services accommodate individuals who are ill 
(Niehaus, 2014). Findings converged toward constraints and 
opportunities related to the hospitalization. During hospital-
ization, healthcare professionals engage with patients at mul-
tiple levels, in various ways, and at various times (Stilley et al., 
2014). On the one hand, hospital routines, coordination, and 
discharge  preparation  are  considerable  points  of  weakness 
(i.e., information delivered at a highly stressful time; (Stilley 
et al., 2014): “We bring the medication in trays or small cups, 
it’s nothing like what they do at home … the hospital is not 
a propitious climate for learning” (FG1, UH). On the other 
hand, hospitalization is an opportunity to identify individu-
als in need of additional support: “The hospital stay should 
also be a key, pivotal period to evaluate, monitor and assess 
the  person’s  capacity.  .  .it’s  the  key  moment  when  the  real 
analysis of the person, the context of life and resources can 
be made” (FG3, RH). For instance, medication review under-
taken  during  hospitalization  is  an  opportunity  to  ask  ques-
tions, talk about problems, and support patients’ best use of 
medicine (Raynor, 2008). 

Consequences

With sufficient medication literacy skills, individuals are 
willing to revise their cognitive patterns and behaviors, suc-
cessfully  adapt  themselves  toward  medication  self-manage-
ment, and achieve better health outcomes. In the case of dis-
cordance—insufficient  medication  literacy  skills—negative 
consequences might emerge, affecting the individuals as well 
as the healthcare system outcomes. Findings from this study 
converged toward five common consequences, and our study 
with hospital nurses brought forward specific content for two 
others (Figure 2). Although most consequences might be ap-
plicable to the overall adult population concerned by medica-
tion utilization, hospital nurses emphasized that medication 
literacy skills in older adults may influence interpersonal re-
lationships with informal caregivers and home maintenance.
Medication  literacy  is  expected  to  act  as  a  predictor  of 
adequate  medication  use  and  safety,  including  using  medi-
cine  regularly  and  correctly  over  the  long  term  (Raynor, 
2008;  Zheng  et  al.,  2019),  preventing  medication  errors  af-
ter discharge (i.e., overuse, misuse, underuse) (Zhong et al., 
2016), nonadherence (Stilley et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2019; 

Zhong et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2016), along with reducing 
adverse  events  “the  elderly  patient  on  Benzodiazepine  with 
three  glasses  of  wine  a  day  …  the  adverse  events  you  don’t 
want  to  see,  such  as  falls  [fall-related  hospital  admissions]” 
(FG1,  UH).  Consequent  to  adequate  medication  literacy, 
achievement of health outcomes and of successful treatments 
(Raynor, 2008) is reached through effective control of symp-
toms  and  prevention  of  disease  progression  (Liang  et  al., 
2018; Zheng et al., 2019). Thus, appropriate medication liter-
acy maximizes “comfort [of older adults]” (FG1, UH) and the 
benefits patients derive from their medicines (Raynor, 2009).
In  relation  to  individual  autonomy,  higher  medication 
literacy  promotes  empowerment  and  self-determination  in 
decisions  concerning  health  and  medicines  (O’Neal  et  al., 
2013;  Raynor,  2009),  operationalized  through  a  wider  vari-
ety of self-care option considerations (Shreffler-Grant et al., 
2013) and endorsement of responsibility in medication self-
management (Raynor, 2009). Optimal medication literacy re-
flects a process of growth, coping, and control and may pre-
vent patients from being victims of swindles in unscrupulous 
sales practices (Shreffler-Grant et al., 2013). Notably, greater 
self-determination could mean “[patients] can decide to take, 
or not to take [medicine] and run the risk of not taking [it]” 
(FG1, UH).

High  medication  literacy  in  patients  supports  involve-
ment  in  medication  self-management  and  decisions,  along 
with  capabilities  in  seeking  information  from  healthcare 
providers (i.e., less reticence in asking for assistance) (O’Neal 
et al., 2013; Pouliot & Vaillancourt, 2016). Consequences at 
a  social  interaction  level  were  found,  such  as  effects  on  in-
terpersonal relationships with the health care providers and 
process  of  care.  As  patients  communicate  their  preferences 
and  provide  prescribers  with  adequate  feedback  (e.g.,  signs 
and symptoms experienced), they facilitate the adaptation of 
the  medication  regimen:  “They  become  real  actors  in  their 
care  and  real  partners”  (FG1,  UH).  Advanced  medication 
literacy  may,  however,  challenge  collaboration  with  health-
care professionals: “Patients who are self-determined in their 
choices.  .  .this  could  generate  tension  within  the  clinical 
team” (FG1, UH), possibly leading to conflicts, as “it makes 
patients more assertive … it’s not sure that all the healthcare 
workers  appreciate  this”  (FG1,  UH).  In  addition,  effects  on 
interpersonal  relationships  with  informal  caregivers  during 
the daily management of medicines may also occur. Hospital 
nurses described how this shared responsibility between the 
older adult and their informal caregiver may result in “issues 
of power” (FG1, UH) or conflicts: “Did you take your insu-
lin? Did you see your blood sugar level? I’ll do it later. No, you 
do it now!” (FG1, UH)

At  a  health  care  system  level,  suboptimal  medication 
literacy  influences  health  care  service  utilization,  that  is, 
medication-related hospital admissions, re-hospitalizations, 
and emergency visits (Vervloet et al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2017; 
Zheng  et  al.,  2019;  Zheng  et  al.,  2017;  Zhong  et  al.,  2016). 
Hospital nurses mentioned “we often see the same people” 
(FG3,  RH).  In  contrast,  patients  with  adequate  medication 
literacy receive the best from a health care system (Raynor, 
2009) in terms of preventive service utilization (King et al., 
2011) and timely, relevant visits to specialists and the emer-
gency department. More specific to older individuals, home 
maintenance or “to be able to stay at home as independently 
as possible” (FG1, UH) was found to be a desirable objective. 

Refined Definition 

From  the  essential  elements  of  the  definition  that  we 
found  (i.e.,  the  attributes),  we  elaborated  the  following  re-
fined definition of medication literacy in hospitalized older 
patients. 

Medication  literacy  in  hospitalized  older  adults  and/or 
their  informal  caregivers  is  the  degree  to  which  they  can 
develop and maintain multidimensional skills that are func-
tional, interactive, and critical. These skills are necessary to 
understand, prepare, and self-administer medication, as well 
as to monitor effects (functional dimension), actively inter-
act  with  healthcare  providers,  express  concerns,  and  take 
part in decisions (interactive dimension), critically analyze 
information (i.e., relevance, quality, contradictory informa-
tion), use the information to exert greater control, and solve 
problems (critical dimension). In practice, optimal medica-
tion literacy might be observed by a manifestation of control 
and  involvement  in  the  medication  regimen  and  the  deci-
sions  related  to  it  and/or  the  use  of  practical  means  to  fa-
cilitate medication self-management (e.g., using lists, notes, 
reminders). 

Adjustment  of  medication  literacy  skills  appears  to  be 
embedded  in  a  dynamic  and  potentially  complex  process, 
consisting of a continuous stream of interactions with health 
care providers and the health care system. The process is:

• Complex, because patients are presented with a constel-
lation of medication-related infor-mation that is made avail-
able  in  various  ways  and  at  various  times  and  that  is  vari-
able in terms of quality and reliability, and this information 
changes along the continuum of care

• Dynamic, because patient engagement in achieving suf-
ficient medication literacy skills is likely to change over time, 
becoming stronger or weaker, balancing the many changes 
in  their  own  health  status,  personal  resources,  health  re-
quirements, and medication regimen complexity

DISCUSSION

The concept development described in this study reveals 
that medication literacy in hospitalized older adults is mul-
tidimensional and that adjustment of these skills is embed-
ded in a dynamic and potentially complex process. Although 
the  presence  of  different  typologies  of  cognitive  and  social 
skills—functional,  interactive,  and  critical  medication  liter-
acy skills—is congruent with the findings of previous work 
(Emmerton et al., 2012; Pantuzza et al., 2020; Vervloet et al., 
2018),  in  our  study,  we  proposed  a  more  detailed  and  in-
clusive understanding of medication literacy skills than has 
previously  been  presented  in  discussions  on  the  topic.  The 
range of skills related to medication literacy reported in the 
literature  is  extensive,  but  the  exact  nature  of  these  skills  is 
still  debated  (Gentizon  et  al.,  2021;  Pantuzza  et  al.,  2020). 
However, this diversity of views can to a large extent be re-
duced  through  the  adoption  of  the  three  main  dimensions 
described herein: functional, interactive, and critical medica-
tion literacy.

Across  publications,  several  core  skills  were  widely  ad-
mitted  as  being  defining  attributes  of  medication  literacy 
(e.g., information accessing and understanding, calculation, 
decision  making),  but  our  proposed  definition  expanded 
the  meaning  to  information  remembering  (i.e.,  memory), 
communicating, medication effect monitoring, and problem 
solving. Notably, our study did not reveal that older patients 
needed medication literacy skills that differed from those of 
other  adult  populations.  Nevertheless,  to  date  few  studies 
have been conducted exclusively with older adults (Pantuzza 
et al., 2020). Thus, the medication literacy skills outlined in 
the current study should not be interpreted as a definitive list, 
but rather used to open avenues for further research that in-
cludes older individuals.

Congruent  with  the  present  study,  subjective  indicators 
of involvement and routines have been described as funda-
mental  features  in  exerting  agency  and  controlling  for  self-
management  of  medication—developed  either  by  patients 
or informal caregivers (Maidment et al., 2020). To promote 
a  more  systematic  identification  of  individuals  with  lower 
skills,  medication  literacy  could  become  a  variable  that  is 
formally  assessed  by  hospital  practitioners,  so  that  recom-
mendations and plan of care can be adapted accordingly (i.e., 
educational  strategies,  medication  prescription  simplifica-
tion, medication aids). 

In  the  same  perspective,  this  study  recognized  the  im-
portance of medication literacy skills in informal caregivers 
when they are responsible for preparing and/or administer-
ing  medication  to  their  older  family  member.  Medication 
management  was  found  to  be  the  most  common  task  re-

ported  by  informal  caregivers  (Reinhard  et  al.,  2014),  both 
in direct activities such as obtaining medications, preparing 
pillboxes, and assisting with medication administration and 
in more complex indirect activities that require cognitive ef-
fort (i.e., organizing and tracking medications, gathering in-
formation, and making treatment decisions (Look & Stone, 
2018).  Nevertheless,  a  recent  systematic  review  underlines 
greater  efforts  are  needed  in  strengthening  involvement  of 
informal caregivers in medication management at transitions 
of care, through designated family meetings, clinical bedside 
handovers, ward rounds, and admission and discharge con-
sultations (Manias et al., 2019). Thus, the utilization of a stan-
dardized measurement instrument of medication literacy in 
informal  caregivers—when  they  share  medication  manage-
ment responsibility or became surrogate decision makers—
could provide guidance to select the most appropriate initia-
tives for strengthening informal caregivers’ knowledge, skills, 
and resources. 

To ensure optimal transition to home and to reduce post-
discharge  medication-related  adverse  events,  instruments 
that  measure  medication  literacy  in  hospitalized  older  pa-
tients  and/or  their  informal  caregivers  should  allow  early 
risk  identification,  that  is,  disruption  in  the  imbalance  be-
tween the individual capacity and the level of demands (i.e., 
tasks and responsibilities) (Maidment et al., 2020; Pleasant, 
2014; Shippee et al., 2012). As medication-related demands 
change over time, along with individual resources and health 
and illness status, evaluation approach must regularly gather 
contextual information, namely perceived complexity of the 
medication  prescription,  needs  and  preferences.  In  future, 
longitudinal  work  may  enhance  insight  into  the  temporal 
and evolving trajectory of medication literacy skills in older 
patients and/or their informal caregivers. 

Another key contribution of this study is the clarification 
of  antecedents  and  consequences  related  to  medication  lit-
eracy. Despite the widespread recognition of contextual fac-
tors that influence the acquisition and maintenance of medi-
cation  literacy  (King  et  al.,  2011;  Raynor,  2008,  2009),  this 
work  presents  a  more  detailed  and  nuanced  understanding 
of antecedents and consequences than has been provided in 
previous  discussions.  Concept  mapping  (Figure 2)  outlines 
personal and contextual features that result in interindividual 
differences in achieving adequate medication literacy, which 
is congruent with theories in health literacy (Paasche-Orlow 
& Wolf, 2007; Sørensen et al., 2012; Squiers et al., 2012) and 
a substantial body of evidence in medication management in 
older adults (Maidment et al., 2020). Health literacy tends to 
decrease with advancing age and an insufficient level is more 
commonly  noted  in  certain  demographic  groups  (i.e.,  with 

lower  educational  background,  lower  income,  migrants). 
Low  health  literacy  was  found  to  be  associated  with  many 
negative  outcomes,  such  as  greater  emergency  care  use,  in-
creased  rates  of  hospitalization,  and  a  decreased  ability  to 
demonstrate  appropriate  self-administration  of  medication 
(e.g.,  medication  misuse  and  errors)  (Berkman  et  al.,  2011; 
Sørensen et al., 2012; Zamora & Clingerman, 2011). Similar 
to health literacy rooted in the health promotion movement 
(Crondahl & Eklund Karlsson, 2016; Sørensen et al., 2012), 
medication  literacy  is  probably  critical  to  patient  empow-
erment  (Niehaus,  2014;  O’Neal  et  al.,  2013;  Raynor,  2009). 
Higher medication literacy therefore aims to empower peo-
ple as consumers and patients so that they can make better 
decisions about their health and improve their skills in man-
aging themselves. 

Our  combined  analysis  of  the  literature  and  narrative 
data  in  relation  to  medication  management  in  older  adults 
corroborates  how  cognition,  prior  experience,  personal 
background,  and  health  priorities  and  goals  are  important 
individual  features  that  condition  the  way  that  patients  ac-
quire  new  information  (Maidment  et  al.,  2020).  Although 
practitioners  have  the  opportunity  to  enhance  appropriate 
decisions and actions  in older adults, the perceived  burden 
of  medication  regimen  and  complexity,  along  with  discon-
nected care pathways within and across services (Maidment 
et al., 2020), remain significant barriers. 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to com-
bine analysis of the literature with narrative data from hospi-
tal nurses. As a general observation, the findings highlighted 
a different and complementary contribution from both data 
sources, and many themes of the literature review coincided 
with  the  descriptions  by  the  interviewed  nurses,  indicat-
ing  the  probable  validity  of  the  concept  in  other  locations. 
Nevertheless, to date few studies have been conducted exclu-
sively with older adults and/or the context of hospitalization. 
Consequently,  we  acknowledge  a  challenge  to  differentiate 
between  medication  literacy  antecedents,  attributes,  and 
consequences in the whole population concerned by medica-
tion utilization and the specificities of medication literacy of 
hospitalized  older  adults.  Thus,  antecedents,  attributes,  and 
consequences outlined in the current study should not be in-
terpreted as definitive, but rather guide further research. The 
concept mapping presented in this study, provide a prelimi-
nary  conceptual  framework  for  medication  literacy,  which 
may  guide  future  research  and  the  formulation  of  research 
hypotheses.  The  magnitude  and  direction  of  potential  rela-
tionships remain to be empirically validated, and further in-

vestigation is needed to establish how different factors, such 
as  coping  strategies,  self-efficacy,  motivation,  and  relation-
ship  continuity  with  professionals  influence  the  acquisition 
and maintenance of medication literacy skills. As the studies 
in  this  field  increase,  it  is  likely  future  studies  will  allow  to 
conduct a realist evaluation (Pawson et al., 2005) focusing on 
medication literacy in older adults, articulating assumptions 
regarding  linkages  between  structures,  processes,  and  out-
comes. Moreover, the fieldwork phase was confined to health 
care professionals; the inclusion of older adults and their in-
formal caregivers is an avenue of pursuit in the development 
of the concept. 

CONCLUSION

Managing  a  medication  regimen  is  a  complex  self-care 
activity that requires a high level of integration and coordi-
nation between cognitive and social skills. The present study 
provides an operational definition of medication literacy in 
hospitalized older adults and/or their informal caregivers, as 
they may become surrogate decision makers. 

Health care professionals need to be aware, however, that 
beyond  individual  patient  characteristics,  the  medication 
regimen and the way that health care services are organized 
and delivered have a potential relationship with medication 
literacy.  This  possibility  underlines  the  collaborative  efforts 
that are required at every level: motivation and involvement 
from  patients  and  their  informal  caregivers  to  develop  and 
update their medication literacy skills, engagement of health 
care professionals to take responsibility in balancing patient 
capacities and demands, and the political will and drive from 
hospital  settings  to  support  “better  medication  literacy  for 
all.”
