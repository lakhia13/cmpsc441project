Background

A B S T R A C T

Chronic venous ulcer healing is a complex clinical problem that requires intervention from skilled, costly, multidisciplinary wound-care
teams. Compression therapy has been shown to help heal venous ulcers and to reduce recurrence. It is not known which interventions
help people adhere to compression treatments. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interventions designed to help people adhere to venous leg ulcer compression therapy, to improve
healing and prevent recurrence after healing.

Search methods

In June 2015, for this first update, we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials  (CENTRAL)  (The Cochrane Library);  Ovid  MEDLINE;  Ovid  MEDLINE  (In-Process  &  Other  Non-Indexed  Citations);  Ovid  EMBASE  and
EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched trial registries, and reference lists of relevant publications for published and ongoing trials. There were
no language or publication date restrictions.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that aim to help people with venous leg ulcers adhere to compression
treatments compared with usual care, or no intervention, or another active intervention. Our main outcomes were ulcer healing, ulcer
recurrence, quality of life, pain, adherence to compression therapy and number of people with adverse events.

Data collection and analysis

Two  review  authors  independently  selected  studies  for  inclusion,  extracted  data,  assessed  the  risk  of  bias  of  each  included  trial,  and
assessed overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main results

One randomised controlled trial was added to this update making a total of three. One ongoing study was also identified.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

One  trial  (67  participants)  compared  a  community-based  Leg  Club®  that  provided  mechanisms  for  peer-support,  assistance  with  goal
setting and social interaction with home-based care. There was no clear difference in healing rates at three months (12/28 people healed
in Leg Club group versus 7/28 in home-based care group; risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 3.71); or six months (15/33
healed in Leg Club group versus 10/34 in home-based care group; RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.93); or in quality of life outcomes at six months
(MD 0.85 points, 95% CI -0.13 to 1.83; 0 to 10 point scale). The Leg Club may lead to a small reduction in pain at six months, that may not
be clinically significant (MD -12.75 points, 95% CI -24.79, -0.71; 0 to 100 point scale, 15 point reduction is usually considered the minimal
clinically important difference) (low quality evidence downgraded for risk of selection bias and imprecision).

Another trial (184 participants) compared a community-based, nurse-led self-management programme of six months' duration promoting
physical activity (walking and leg exercises) and adherence to compression therapy via counselling and behaviour modification (Lively
Legs®) with usual care in a wound clinic. At 18 months follow-up, there were no clear differences in healing rates (51/92 healed in Lively
Legs group versus 41/92 in usual care group; RR 1.24 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.67)); rates of recurrence of venous leg ulcers (32/69 with recurrence
in Lively Legs group versus 38/67 in usual care group; RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.14)); or adherence to compression therapy (42/92 people
fully adherent in Lively Legs group versus 41/92 in usual care group; RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.41)). The evidence from this trial was also
downgraded to low quality due to risk of selection bias and imprecision.

A single study compared patient education delivered via video with education delivered by text (pamphlet). However, no outcomes relevant
to this review were reported.

We found no studies that investigated other interventions to promote adherence to compression therapy.

Authors' conclusions

It is unclear whether interventions designed to help people adhere to compression therapy improve venous ulcer healing and reduce
recurrence. There is a lack of trials of interventions that promote adherence to compression therapy for venous ulcers.

Interventions for helping people adhere to compression treatments to aid healing of venous leg ulcers

Background

Venous  leg  ulcers  take  weeks  or  months  to  heal,  cause  distress,  and  are  very  costly  for  health  services.  Although  compression
using  bandages  or  stockings  helps  healing  and  prevents  recurrence,  many  people  do  not  adhere  to  compression  therapy.  Therefore,
interventions that promote the wearing of compression should improve healing and prevent recurrence of venous ulcers.

Study characteristics

This updated review (current to 22 June 2015) included three randomised controlled trials. One study conducted in Australia compared
standard wound care (venous ulcer treatment, advice and support, follow-up management and preventive care) in a community clinic
called 'Leg Club' (34 participants) with the same wound care in the home by a nurse (33 participants). Another study (184 participants)
compared  a  community-based  exercise  and  behaviour  modification  programme  called  'Lively  Legs'  for  promoting  adherence  with
compression therapy and physical exercise plus usual care (wound care, compression bandages at an outpatient clinic) with 'usual care'
alone  in  11  outpatient  dermatology  clinics  in  the  Netherlands.  A  third  small  study  (20  participants)  compared  a  patient  educational
intervention to improve knowledge of venous disease and ulcer management. The intervention was delivered via video or via written
pamphlet for people attending a wound healing research clinic in Miami, USA. Participants in all studies were aged 60 or more, with a
venous leg ulcer.

Key results

The Leg Club®, a community-based clinic, did not improve healing of venous leg ulcers or quality of life any more than nurse home-visit
care, but may result in less pain after six months. Seventeen more people out of 100 were healed after participating in Leg Club (46/100
people in Leg Club healed compared with 29/100 people having usual home care); this difference was not statistically significant and could
have occurred by chance. Leg Club participants rated their quality of life 0.85 points better than those receiving home care, assessed on a
10 point scale. Leg Club participants rated their pain at six months 12.75 points lower than the home care group, assessed on a 100 point
scale. This trial did not report whether Leg Club clinics improve adherence to compression, time to healing, or prevent recurrence more
than home care.

It  is  not  clear  whether  Lively  Legs®,  a  community-based  self-management  programme,  improves  ulcer  healing  or  recurrence  after  18
months compared with usual care. It is not clear whether Lively Legs® influences adherence to compression therapy. The trial did not report
whether the Lively Legs self-management programme clinics improve time to healing of ulcers, reduce pain, or improve quality of life any
more than usual care in a wound clinic.

It is unclear if patient education delivered by video or via a pamphlet improves healing or recurrence, as the study did not measure any
outcomes relevant to this review.

Quality of the evidence

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

It is unclear whether community-based clinics to promote adherence to compression therapy either promote adherence or improve ulcer
healing or recurrence. The available evidence is low quality due to the risk of bias in the included studies and their small sample sizes which
lead to great imprecision and uncertainty. One single small trial that evaluated an education intervention failed to measure the outcomes
we considered important for this review such as ulcer healing and recurrence, and adherence. Further high quality studies are likely to
change the outcome of this review.

We know that compression therapy is effective, but do not know which interventions improve adherence to compression therapy.

Description of the condition

Venous  leg  ulceration  represents  the  most  prevalent  form  of
difficult  to  heal  wounds,  and  these  problematic  wounds  require
a significant amount of health care resources for their treatment.
Typically, venous leg ulceration is a chronic, relapsing condition (de
Araujo 2003). The most common cause of venous leg ulceration is
venous insufficiency, which accounts for nearly 80% of all ulcers.
People with chronic venous insufficiency are prone to development
of  venous  leg  ulcers  on  the  ankles  and  legs.  A  venous  leg  ulcer
can  be  defined  as  'an  open  sore  in  the  skin  of  the  lower  leg  due
to high pressure of the blood in the leg veins' (British Association
of  Dermatologists  2010).  By  definition,  chronic  venous  ulcers  are
defects in the skin, usually below the knee, that have been present
for  more  than  four  to  six  weeks  (Walker  2002).  Ulcers  of  long
duration  and  greater  size  are  known  to  be  markers  of  a  poor
prognosis  (Margolis  2004).  They  are  typically  painful  and  heal
slowly, resulting in an impaired quality of life, social isolation and
reduced work productivity (Persoon 2004; Vowden 2009).

Venous  leg  ulcers  are  the  most  common  cause  of  lower  limb
ulceration in the western world, with prevalence estimated to be
1%  in  the  adult  population  and  reported  to  be  as  high  as  3%  in
adults  aged  65  and  over  (Donnelly  2009)  with  a  higher  incidence
in  women  than  men  (ratio  1.25:1)  (Henke  2010;  Margolis  2002).
Some prevalence estimates have been as high as 4.3% (Baker 1991;
Margolis  2002;  Moffatt  2007;  Stacey  2001;  Vowden  2009).  These
variations can probably be explained by the different survey and
sampling  methods  used  (e.g.  whether  only  those  people  whose
ulcers are known to health services are identified, and whether case
validation  is  employed).There  are  several  underlying  pathologies
associated  with  leg  ulceration,  including  venous,  arterial  and
rheumatoid disease, and ulcers may occur in the presence of one, or
a combination, of underlying conditions (Baker 1992; Henke 2010).

This review focuses on venous leg ulcers that occur when damage
to the deep, or superficial veins, or both (e.g. from a thrombosis)
result in a high ambulatory venous pressure; the communicating
veins between the superficial veins may also be incompetent. The
high venous pressure is thought to cause leakage in the associated
capillaries,  with  the  resultant  deposition  of  red  blood  cells  and
other  protein  molecules  that  cause  fibrosis  and  staining  of  the
subcutaneous  tissue  and  skin,  which  leads  to  relative  ischaemia
(lack  of  oxygen),  poor  nutrition  of  the  surrounding  tissues,  and
breakdown of the skin.

Despite  improvements  in  treatments  for  venous  ulcers  and
the  widespread  introduction  of  compression  bandaging  as  the
mainstay  of  current  conservative  management,  a  significant
proportion  of  venous  leg  ulcers  remain  unhealed  or  recur  after
a  period  of  time.  At  least  28%  of  people  affected  by  this  will
experience more than ten episodes of ulceration in their lifetimes,
with  recurrence  rates  estimated  at  between  45%  and  87%  and
up  to  20%  of  leg  ulcers  being  active  at  any  point  in  time
(Abbade  2005;  Nelson  2006;  Vowden  2006).  Reasons  for  variable
healing  and  recurrence  rates  are  multifactorial.  Early  diagnosis
and  treatment  are  important,  although  patient  adherence  to
compression  treatment  is  also  an  important  factor,  not  just  for
healing but also for preventing recurrence.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Current treatments for venous ulcers

Venous  leg  ulcers  that  have  been  present  for  a  prolonged  period
of  time  pose  a  substantial  management  challenge  for  clinicians
(Simon  2004).  Treatments  that  are  used  to  heal  and  prevent
recurrence  of  venous  ulcers  include  compression,  local  wound
care,  surgery,  physical  therapy,  systemic  (whole  body)  drug
treatments and attendance at community clinics for leg ulcer care.
Management  guidelines  have  identified  compression  therapy  as
the  cornerstone  in  the  treatment  of  venous  leg  ulcers  (Cullum
2001; Nelson 2012; O'Meara 2012), and, in view of the high rate of
recurrence, compression hosiery is also current standard practice
for the prevention of recurrence (Nelson 2012).

We  know  from  previous  Cochrane  reviews  that  compression
increases ulcer healing rates when compared with no compression
(O'Meara 2012); that adherence to high levels of compression after
healing  reduces  the  rate  of  recurrence  (Nelson  2012);  that  multi-
component  systems  are  more  effective  than  single-component
systems, and that multi-component systems containing an elastic
bandage are more effective than those containing mainly inelastic
bandages  (O'Meara  2012).  Compression  acts  by  reducing  the
abnormally high pressure seen in the superficial veins, and reduces
lower limb swelling and oedema.

The efficacy of compression therapy depends mainly upon exerted
pressure  and  stiffness  of  the  bandage  (Partsch  2006).  Lowest
recurrence rates are reported in people who are treated with the
highest degree of compression, and it is recommended that people
wear the highest level of compression that is comfortable (Nelson
2012); but it is also reported that many patients cannot tolerate, or
do not adhere to, compression bandaging therapy (Bale 2003).

Adherence  can  be  defined  as  the  extent  to  which  patients  follow
the instructions they are given for treatments (Haynes 2008). The
term, adherence, is intended to be non-judgemental, a statement
of fact rather than of blame attributable to the patient, prescriber,
or  compression  treatment.  Adherence  rates  are  influenced  by
people's beliefs about how worthwhile the treatment is (Jull 2004).
There is a need for better understanding of the methods that might
improve  adherence  to  inform  clinical  practice,  and  to  improve
healing rates and reduce recurrence of venous ulcers.

Description of the intervention

Educational  interventions,  support  group  interventions,  nursing
and  medical  interventions,  multidisciplinary  interventions  and
healthcare  system  interventions,  either  alone,  or  in  combination
may improve adherence. Community models of care, which include
'leg  clubs',  offer  a  setting  where  people  with  similar  problems
can  socialise  in  a  supportive,  information-sharing  environment
(Brooks 2004; Edwards 2005a). Leg clubs provide a room or space
for  social  activities  and  refreshments,  and  separate  areas  where
wound  care  is  provided  at  'dressing  stations'  where  participants
are still able to communicate with each other. Healthcare system
interventions  such  as  educational  programs  that  may  include  a
combination  of  cognitive,  behavioural  or  affective  components,
or  both,  may  also  improve  adherence  to  compression  therapy
(Van  Hecke  2008;  Van  Hecke  2009).  Specific  interventions  may
comprise verbal instruction, written instruction, or both, as well as
counselling about the patient's underlying disease, the importance
of compression therapy and adherence to therapy.

Another  model,  'Lively  Legs'  provides  counselling  sessions  in
an  outpatient  setting.  The  programme  provides  evaluation  of
patient  lifestyle  and  heath  beliefs;  identification  of  barriers  and
facilitators for behaviour change; and education materials. The aim
of  the  programme  is  to  encourage  behaviour  change  to  promote
adherence to exercise and compression treatment (Heinen 2012).

How the intervention might work

There  is  little  evidence  from  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)
about adherence rates to compression therapy, or patients' views.
There is some suggestion that nursing interventions result in the
patient 'more consciously following advice', including performing
exercise  and  wearing  compression  bandages;  it  is  assumed  that
adherence to the gold-standard of compression treatment results
in  improved  healing  (Van  Hecke  2011).  Another  study  indicates
that  patients  do  not  adhere  to  compression  treatments  due  to
pain,  discomfort  and  lack  of  valid  lifestyle  advice  (Van  Hecke
2009).  Interventions  designed  to  increase  adherence  to  wearing
compression  bandages  should  improve  healing  and  recurrence
rates for people with chronic venous ulcers.

Why it is important to do this review

Chronic venous ulcer healing remains a complex clinical situation
and  often  requires  the 
intervention  of  skilled,  but  costly,
multidisciplinary  wound  care  teams.  Recurrence  is  often  an
ongoing issue for people who experience venous ulcers. If the gold-
standard  of  treatment  (compression)  is  adhered  to,  we  believe
that healing rates will improve. It would be useful to know which
interventions  help  people  adhere  to  compression  treatments  to
heal ulcers and to prevent recurrence.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  or  cluster-randomised
controlled  trials  (cluster-RCTs)  of 
interventions  designed  to
improve adherence with compression therapies.

Types of participants

Adults  (as  defined  in  trials)  undergoing  treatment  for  venous  leg
ulceration or prevention of recurrence of venous leg ulcers.

Types of interventions

We included studies that assessed interventions designed to help
people adhere to compression treatments for venous leg ulceration
and  prevention  of  recurrence.  The  study  had  to  state  that  the
aim of the intervention was to increase adherence to compression
treatments  for  the  study  to  be  eligible  (regardless  of  whether
adherence was reported as an outcome). We searched for any type
of intervention including educational interventions, support group
interventions, nursing and medical interventions, multidisciplinary

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

interventions and healthcare system interventions either alone or
in combination aimed at people with venous leg ulcers.

All  possible  comparison  interventions  were  eligible  for  inclusion.
These  included  sham  or  control  intervention,  usual  care  or  no
intervention,  one  intervention  compared  with  another,  or  single
interventions compared with complex interventions. We excluded
trials designed to assess knowledge of caregivers, topical dressings
used as adjunct to compression and trials of compression bandages
only, as these are topics of other reviews.

Types of outcome measures

We included outcomes at all time points.

Primary outcomes

Since adherence to compression treatment should result in more
rapid healing of venous ulcers and a reduced rate of recurrence, the
primary outcomes considered for this review were:

• venous ulcer healing (e.g. proportion of ulcers healed within trial

period, as defined by the trial authors);

• time to complete healing;
• recurrence of venous ulcer (as reported in the trials);
• adherence  to  compression  therapy,  e.g.  proportion  reporting

adherence to compression.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes considered for this review included:

• quality of Life (QoL);
• adverse events;
• pain;
• economic outcomes.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

In June 2015 we updated the searches of the following electronic
databases to find reports of relevant randomised clinical trials:

• The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (searched 22 June

2015)

• The  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL)

(The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 5);
• Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 22 June 2015);
• Ovid  MEDLINE  (In-Process  &  Other  Non-Indexed  Citations,

(searched 22 June 2015);

• Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 22 June 2015);
• EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 23 June 2015).

trials 

The  search  strategies  used  for  these  databases  can  be  found
in  Appendix  1.  The  Ovid  MEDLINE  search  was  combined  with
the  Cochrane  Highly  Sensitive  Search  Strategy  for  identifying
in  MEDLINE:  sensitivity-  and  precision
randomised 
maximizing  version  (2008  revision)  (Lefebvre  2011).  The  Ovid
EMBASE and Ovid CINAHL searches were combined with the trial
filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network
(SIGN 2015). There were no restrictions with respect to language,
date of publication or study setting.

We also searched the following trial registries:

• The  Australian  New  Zealand  Clinical  Trials  Registry

(www.anzctr.org.au/);

• ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/);
• The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  International  Clinical
(www.who.int/

Trials  Registry  Platform  Search  Portal 
trialsearch);

• ISRCTN registry (www.controlled-trials.com/).

Searching other resources

The bibliographies of all studies eligible for inclusion identified by
the above strategies were searched for further studies not identified
through searches of electronic databases.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two  review  authors  (CW,  RJ)  independently  assessed  the  titles
and  available  abstracts  of  all  studies  identified  by  the  initial
search,  excluded  any  clearly  irrelevant  studies,  and  assessed  full
copies of reports of potentially eligible studies using the inclusion
criteria. The authors resolved disagreements regarding inclusion by
consensus.

Data extraction and management

Two  review  authors  (CW,  RJ)  independently  extracted  data  from
the  included  trials  on  source  of  funding,  study  population,
interventions,  analyses  and  outcomes,  using  standardised  data
extraction forms. We contacted trial authors, as required, to obtain
more information.

In order to assess efficacy, we extracted raw data for outcomes of
interest (means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes,
number of events for dichotomous outcomes, and hazard ratio and
95% confidence intervals for time-to-event data) where available
in  the  published  reports.  We  also  recorded  wherever  reported
data  were  converted  or  imputed  in  the  notes  section  of  the
Characteristics of included studies table.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each
included trial against key criteria recommended by the Cochrane
Collaboration (Higgins 2011), namely:

• random sequence generation;
• allocation concealment;
• blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors;
• incomplete outcome data;
• selective outcome reporting; and
• other  sources  of  bias  (such  as  whether  groups  were  similar  at
baseline  for  important  prognostic  indicators,  such  as  wound
size  and  severity,  and  duration  of  ulcer;  and  whether  co-
interventions were avoided, or similar, within the treatment and
control groups).

We judged each of these criteria as low risk of bias, high risk of bias,
or unclear (due to either a lack of information or uncertainty over
the potential for bias), and also gave an overall impression of the
risk  of  bias  for  the  entire  study,  based  on  the  judgement  that  an

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

unclear or high risk of bias for one or more key criteria weakens our
confidence in the estimate of effect (Higgins 2011). This meant that
if any of the above criteria were rated as having a high or unclear risk
of bias individually, we assigned the trial a high risk of bias overall.
We assigned a trial a low risk of bias overall only if all of the above
criteria were judged to be at low risk of bias individually.

Review  authors  resolved  disagreements  by  consensus,  and
consulted  a  third  review  author  to  resolve  disagreements,  if
necessary.

Measures of treatment effect

The results of the included studies were plotted as point estimates,
that  is,  relative  risks  (RR)  with  corresponding  95%  confidence
intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD)
and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We planned to extract hazard
ratio (HR) data for time to healing, but this was not reported by any
study.

Unit of analysis issues

For trials presenting outcomes at multiple time points, we extracted
data at all time points (three months, six months, 12 months, 18
months), as subgroups.

Dealing with missing data

If  data  were  missing  from  the  trial  reports,  we  contacted  trial
authors to try to obtain the relevant information.

We used number randomised as the denominator for dichotomous
outcomes  that  assessed  a  benefit  (healing,  adherence),  on  the
assumption that any participants missing at the end of treatment
did not have a positive outcome (e.g. for healing, we would have
assumed  that  missing  participants  did  not  have  a  healed  ulcer).
We  used  number  available  at  follow-up  as  the  denominator  for
dichotomous outcomes that assessed a harm, and data as available
to analyse continuous outcomes.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We had planned to assess statistical heterogeneity by Q test (chi-
square)  and  I2  and  to  interpret  a  chi-square  test  resulting  in  a
p-value  <0.10  as  indicating  significant  statistical  heterogeneity.
In  order  to  assess  and  quantify  the  possible  magnitude  of
inconsistency (i.e. heterogeneity) across studies, we had planned to
use the I2 statistic with a rough guide for interpretation as follows:
0%  to  40%  might  not  be  important;  30%  to  60%  may  represent
moderate  heterogeneity;  50%  to  90%  may  represent  substantial
heterogeneity; 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity and likely
unsuitable for meta-analysis (Deeks 2011). The trials we included
reported  different  interventions,  comparators  and  outcomes,  so
statistical heterogeneity was not assessed.

Assessment of reporting biases

We had planned to assess publication bias by constructing funnel
plots  if  at  least  10  studies  are  available  for  the  meta  analysis  of
a primary outcome, but this was not possible, as we had too few
included studies.

and  using  the  same  outcome  measure,  we  had  planned  to  pool
outcomes  in  a  meta-analysis.  We  planned  to  use  a  fixed-effect
model for meta-analysis, but in the presence of heterogeneity that
may  have  been  important  (I2  of  40%  or  more)  we  would  have
used a random effects model as a sensitivity analysis to see if the
conclusions  differed,  and  presented  the  results  from  the  random
effects  model.  For  time-to-event  data,  estimates  of  hazard  ratio
(HR) and 95% CI if presented in the trial reports, would have been
converted into the log rank observed minus expected events and
variance  of  the  log  rank,  and  these  estimates  would  be  pooled
using a fixed effect model (as only a fixed-effect model is available
in RevMan for this analysis) (Deeks 2011). However, meta-analysis
was precluded because the trials reported different interventions,
comparators and outcomes.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

If  there  were  sufficient  data  (e.g.  stratified  data  presented  in  the
trials),  we  planned  to  perform  separate  subgroup  analyses  to
determine whether healing is influenced by the following factors:

• severity of ulcers at baseline determined by size (>5cm 2 or ≤5cm
2)) or ulcer duration (>6months or ≤ 6 months) at baseline;
• different geographical locations/settings (rural versus urban);
• community versus home care; and
• specialist multidisciplinary clinic versus nurse led clinic.

We  anticipated  that  trials  may  have  presented  outcomes  by
baseline  severity  and  duration  of  ulcers.  The  other  analyses  may
have  come  from  data  from  separate  trials.  We  had  planned  to
informally  compare  the  magnitudes  of  effect  to  assess  possible
differences in response to treatment between the two groups. The
magnitude of the effects can be compared between the subgroups
by assessing the overlap of the confidence intervals. Non-overlap
of the confidence intervals indicates statistical significance (Deeks
2011).

As  there  were  insufficient  data,  we  did  not  perform  our  planned
subgroup analyses.

Sensitivity analysis

We had planned sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness
of  the  treatment  effect  to  allocation  concealment  by  removing
the  trials  that  did  not  report  adequate  allocation  concealment
(i.e.  inadequate  or  unclear)  from  the  meta-analysis  to  see  if  this
changed the overall treatment effect. Then we had planned using
the  same  method  to  assess  the  effect  of  excluding  trials  with
unblinded or unclear outcome assessment.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We had also planned sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of
imputation of missing data, but as we did not impute any data, the
analysis was not done.

We had insufficient data for these analyses.

Presentation of results

The  main  results  of  the  review  were  presented  in  'Summary  of
findings'  tables  which  provide  key  information  concerning  the
quality  of  evidence,  the  magnitude  of  effect  of  the  interventions
examined,  and  the  sum  of  the  available  data  on  the  main
outcomes,  as  recommended  by  the  Cochrane  Collaboration
(Schunemann 2011a), using GRADEpro software. We used the five
GRADE  considerations  (study  limitations,  consistency  of  effect,
imprecision,  indirectness  and  publication  bias)  to  assess  the
quality of evidence Schunemann 2011b.

After  the  protocol  was  published,  we  decided  to  include  the
following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables: number of
people with ulcers healed, recurrence of ulcers, time to complete
healing,  quality  of  life,  pain,  adherence  to  compression,  and
number of people with adverse events. Quality of life was reported
using  two  different  instruments;  we  decided  to  present  only  the
data measured using the more widely accepted measure (SF12).

Results of the search

The  original  search  of  the  Cochrane  Wounds  Group  Specialised
Register,  CENTRAL,  MEDLINE,  EMBASE,  and  CINAHL  yielded  322
titles and abstracts, and the updated search, conducted from 2013
to 22 June 2015 yielded an additional 55 citations. A handsearch
found  two  additional  records  through  other  sources  (Figure  1).
Thus,  we  screened  379  citations  in  total,  and  after  initial  review,
we  excluded  349  because  they  were  either  not  RCTs,  involved
another  patient  population  (e.g.  diabetic  foot  ulcers)  or  did  not
evaluate interventions to help adherence to compression therapy.
After screening of titles and abstracts, we identified 30 trial reports
for  full  text  assessment.  Three  studies  met  the  inclusion  criteria:
two included in the first review (Edwards 2009, Heinen 2012) and
one new trial (Baquerizo Nole 2015) . We also identified one ongoing
study (O'Brien 2014).

Edwards  2009 
(67
participants)  that  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  standard  wound
care  (consisting  of  health  assessment  and  referral  as  indicated,
venous  ulcer  treatment  based  'protocols',  advice  and  support,
follow-up  management  and  preventive  care)  in  a  community
clinic called 'Leg Club' (34 participants) compared with the same
wound care in the home by a nurse (33 participants) conducted in
Queensland, Australia. Three published interim analyses of this trial
were identified (Edwards 2005a; Edwards 2005b; Edwards 2005c).

Heinen  2012  reported  a  multi-centre  RCT  (184  participants)
investigating  the  effectiveness  of  a  community-based  exercise
and  behaviour  modification  programme  called  'Lively  Legs'  for
promoting  adherence  with  ambulant  compression  therapy  and
physical  exercise  (92  participants),  plus  usual  care  (wound  care,
compression  bandages  at  an  outpatient  clinic)  compared  with
'usual  care'  alone  (92  participants),  conducted  in  11  outpatient
dermatology clinics in the Netherlands.

Participants

All twenty participants included in Baquerizo Nole 2015 were over
60 years old. Non-Hispanic men made up the majority of the study
sample. Intervention and control groups did not differ significantly
for education level, occupation, number of current ulcers, number
of  lifetime  ulcer  episodes,  baseline  pain  and  use  of  compression
stockings.  Most  participants  had  one  or  two  ulcers  at  enrolment
(70%  in  the  intervention  group  and  50%  in  the  control  group).
Ulcer size was not reported. Twenty percent of participants in the
intervention group and 30% in the control group had an ulcer for
less  than  6  months,  while  more  participants  had  ulcers  for  more
than  6  months  (70%  in  the  intervention  group  and  60%  in  the
control group). Mean (SD) pain on a 0 to 10 point scale (where 0 is
no pain) was 3.3(2.8) points in the intervention group and 3.5 (3.9)
points in the control group. The presence of co-morbidities was not
reported. The use of compression therapy seemed suboptimal: 43%
in the intervention group and 29% in the control group.

Most participants included in Edwards 2009 (90%) were aged over
60 years. Men made up 54% of the study sample, and 60% required
some  form  of  aid  to  mobilise.  Intervention  and  control  groups
did  not  differ  significantly  for  presence  of  co-morbidities  such  as
cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis and history of varicose veins,
deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  and  previous  venous  surgery.  The
average ulcer size area was reported to be 7.5 cm2 (1.0 cm2 to 140.0
cm2)  and  the  median  duration  of  ulcer  was  reported  as  being  22
weeks (four to 180 weeks).

The  mean  age  of  participants  included  in  Heinen  2012  was  66
years (27 to 91 years). Women made up 60% of the study sample.
Intervention  and  control  groups  did  not  differ  significantly  for

walking a short distance). The intervention group included a higher
number  of  participants  with  hypertension  (43%  versus  30%)  and
smoking  (22%  versus  15%).  The  control  group  included  a  higher
number  of  participants  with  previous  DVT  (40%  versus  27%),
heart failure (23% versus 17%) and arthritis (27% versus 20%).The
average ulcer size in the intervention group was reported to be 9
cm2 (0.2 cm2 to 180 cm2) and the mean duration was reported to
be seven months (0.3 to 54 months). The average ulcer size in the
control  group  was  reported  to  be  8.4  cm2  (0.4  cm2  to  130  cm2)
and the mean duration was reported to be 7.3 months (0.8 to 54
months).

Interventions

The trial by Baquerizo Nole 2015 used an educational intervention
designed  to  improve  patient  knowledge  about  VLU  disease  and
its  management  delivered  by  video  to  the  intervention  group,
compared to a control group who received the same information
in  text  form  (written  pamphlet).  Participants  were  instructed  to
complete a baseline test with 15 questions about venous leg ulcer
pathophysiology, management and lifestyle with an emphasis on
compression  therapy  and  reasons  to  seek  care  between  visits
to  assess  their  knowledge.  Characteristics  of  the  educational
intervention were not reported.

The Edwards 2009 trial's Leg Club settings consisted of a room or
space  for  social  activities  and  refreshments,  and  separate  areas
where  wound  care  was  provided  at  'dressing  stations'  where
participants were still able to communicate with each other. Both
the  Leg  Club  and  control  groups  received  nursing  care  for  up  to
six  months  consisting  of:  comprehensive  assessment  including
Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI); referral for further circulatory
assessment as indicated; venous ulcer treatment based on research
protocols; advice and support about venous leg ulcers; and follow-
up management and preventive care. These five care items were
delivered weekly by community nurses to the intervention group at
a Leg Club where participants had opportunities for peer-support,
assistance  with  goal  setting  and  social  interaction,  and  delivered
during individual home visits by community nurses to participants
in  the  control  group.  Although  not  stated  explicitly  in  this  trial
report, Leg Clubs have been established to improve adherence to
compression  therapy  by  providing  holistic  care  for  patients  in  a
supportive environment (Lindsay 2001).

In the Heinen 2012 trial, the 'Lively Legs programme' intervention
group  received  the  following  interventions  in  addition  to  the
usual care delivered in the control group: Lively Legs counselling
sessions  (up  to  six)  that  included  evaluation  of  patient  lifestyle;
health  education  related  to  patient  heath  beliefs;  motivation  for
increasing  exercise;  other  barriers  and  facilitators  for  behaviour
change;  and  goal  setting  on  one  or  more  lifestyle  topics.  The
outpatient  clinic  was  the  setting  for  Lively  Legs  counselling,  the
session time varied from 45 to 60 minutes for the first session to 20
to 30 minutes for subsequent sessions. Where possible an informal
caretaker was present at each session.

Outcomes

Baquerizo  Nole  2015  measured  knowledge  of  venous  leg  ulcer
pathophysiology, management and lifestyle, compression therapy
and reasons to seek care between visits at baseline, immediately
after the intervention and four weeks later, using a test. Outcomes
relevant  to  this  review  were  not  reported.  The  questionnaire

care).  The  programme  is  administered  by  telephone  calls  from
the principal researcher at 4 timepoints (Week 1, 3, 6 and 9) over
the 12-week intervention. Participants will also be encouraged to
walk at least three times per week for 30 minutes. Outcomes are
healing  rates,  ankle  range  of  motion,  self-reported  and  objective
measures of physical activity, and self-reported adherence to the
self-management  programme.  Trial  recruitment  is  complete,  but
no results were available at the time of publication.

Edwards  2009  reported  outcomes  at  baseline,  12  and  24  weeks.
We  included  the  following  outcomes  in  this  review:  proportion
of  participants  with  ulcers  healed,  pain  and  quality  of  life.
Edwards 2009 also reported economic outcomes on a subset of 56
participants (out of a total of 67) (Gordon 2006), but as the authors
did not report the effect estimate used in the analysis clearly, we
were unable to extract and verify the cost-effectiveness estimates.

Heinen 2012 reported outcomes at baseline, six months, 12 months
and  18  months.  We  included  the  following  outcomes  in  this
review:  the  number  of  people  healed,  the  number  of  people
with  recurrence,  the  number  of  people  adherent  to  compression
therapy.

Excluded studies

We  excluded  26  studies,  as  they  were  not  RCTs  (11  studies),  they
did  not  include  interventions  to  help  people  with  venous  leg
ulcers  adhere  to  compression  therapy  (14  studies),  or  did  not
include  people  with  venous  leg  ulcers  (one  study)  (see  Table  of
Characteristics of excluded studies).

Ongoing studies

We identified one ongoing study (O'Brien 2014), which compares
a self-management telephone based intervention plus usual care
with usual care alone for promoting exercise and healing rates for
adults with venous leg ulcers.

The  self-management  exercise  intervention  consists  of  a  12
week  home-based  unsupervised  progressive  resistance  exercise
program, aimed at strengthening the calf muscle of the leg, given
in  addition  to  usual  care  (compression  bandaging  and  wound

Risk of bias in included studies

Overall,  the  risk  of  bias  in  Baquerizo  Nole  2015  was  high.  The
study was at risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition
biases  due  to  poor  reporting.  The  authors  did  not  report  the
randomisation  method  or  if  treatment  allocation  was  concealed.
Performance  and  detection  biases  were  likely,  due  to  the  lack  of
blinding of participants, investigators and outcomes assessors.

Attrition  bias  was  likely.  The  study  included  only  10  participants
per  group  and  as  three  participants  were  lost  to  follow-up  from
one  group,  this  may  have  led  to  biased  results.  It  is  unclear  if
there were reporting biases as the authors did not report important
patient-relevant outcomes including ulcer healing and recurrence.
However the authors indicate in written correspondence that they
only planned to measure knowledge.

It is unclear if there were other biases, such as baseline differences
or  co-intervention  differences  between  treatment  groups,  due  to
lack of reporting.

The  risk  of  bias  in  Edwards  2009  was  high.  The  authors  used
a  random  number  program  to  generate  the  random  sequence,
but  did  not  report  whether  allocation  was  concealed,  therefore,
it  is  unclear  whether  selection  bias  was  avoided.  Performance
bias  was  likely,  due  to  the  difficulty  of  blinding  participants  and
investigators. As participants were aware of their treatment group,
self-reported outcomes pain, and quality of life may be susceptible
to  detection  bias.  However,  complete  healing,  as  defined  by  the
trial  authors  ('full  epithelialisation  lasting  for  two  weeks'),  and
presumably assessed by the community nurse, seemed objective,
and less susceptible to detection bias (Figure 2).

Figure 2.   Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.

The proportion of participants lost to follow-up was quite high in
both treatment groups (23% from the intervention group, 21% from
the control group). However, as the proportion and reasons for the
losses were similar in both groups, the risk of attrition bias was low.

The study was probably subject to reporting bias, as the pilot study
reported  that  ulcer  recurrence,  and  new  ulcers  were  measured
(Edwards 2005a), but these data were not reported in the results
paper.  Furthermore,  the  instrument  used  to  assess  pain  was
changed during the course of the trial .

It was unclear whether Edwards 2009 was free from other biases
because the trialists used sequential estimation rather than an a
priori sample size calculation. Sequential estimation is used when
the sample size is not fixed in advance. Instead, data are evaluated
as they are collected, and further sampling is stopped in accordance
with a pre-defined stopping rule as soon as significant results are
observed.

The risk of bias was also high in Heinen 2012. It was unclear whether
selection  bias  was  avoided,  as  the  method  of  randomisation  or
allocation  to  treatment  was  not  clearly  described.  Performance
bias  was  likely,  as  participants  and  investigators  were  probably
aware  of  the  intervention  group.  Detection  bias  was  unlikely  for
assessment  of  objective  outcomes  (healing  and  recurrence),  but
was  possible  in  the  assessment  of  the  self-reported  outcome
(adherence). Attrition bias was unlikely, as the losses to follow-up
were even across treatment groups (see Figure 2). Reporting bias
was likely, as time to time to leg ulcer recurrence was measured,
but  reported  as  time  until  25%  of  participants  had  recurrence.
Similary, exercise was measured as a continuous scale but reported
as a dichotomised scale. There were no other biases: groups were
similar  at  baseline  and  co-interventions  did  not  differ  between
groups.

Effects of interventions

compared  with  nurse  home  visits;  Summary  of  findings  2
Lively Legs programme compared with wounds outpatient clinic;
Summary of findings 3 Video education versus written education

The interventions that were studied in the two trials that reported
relevant outcomes for this review were too heterogenous to allow
pooling of outcomes data. While they were both community-based
nurse-led clinics, Leg Club® emphasised socialisation, peer-support
and  patient-empowerment,  while  Lively  Legs  promoted  exercise
adherence  and  behaviour  modification.  We  therefore  report  the
trial results for each trial separately. The third trial did not report
outcomes relevant for this review.

Wound care in a community-based socialisation and peer-
support clinic (Leg Club®) compared with wound care at home
by nurse visits (one trial)

Number of people healed

The proportion of participants healed at three months is higher in
the Leg Club group (12/28, 43%) than in the home visit group (7/28,
25%), relative risk (RR) 1.71 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.79 to
3.71; Analysis 1.1), due to imprecision around the results, and risk
of bias (low quality evidence). For the same reasons, it is uncertain
if the proportion of participants healed at six months is different
between treatment groups (Leg Club: 15/33 (45%), home visit group
10/34 (29%), RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.93; Analysis 1.1). The larger
denominator  at  six  months  was  from  the  completed  study;  the
three month outcome data were from an interim analysis (Edwards
2005b).

Quality of life

Mean quality of life measured by the 10-point Spitzer's index was
8.96  points  (standard  deviation  (SD)  1.43)  in  the  Leg  Club  group,
and 8.11(SD 2.1). It is uncertain if this differs between groups (MD
0.85  points  on  10  point  scale,  95%  CI  -0.13  to  1.83;  Analysis  1.2),
due  to  the  potential  for  selection  bias  and  the  small  number  of
participants. Edwards 2009 however reported this was statistically
different using a 'triangular test of difference between means' with
a P value of 0.014.

Adverse events

Outcome not reported.

Pain

The Edwards 2009 trial used two different outcome measurement
tools to assess pain. At 12 weeks the trialists measured pain with
the RAND instrument, a 36-item heath survey, and at 24 weeks with
the Medical Outcomes Study pain measure, a 100-point continuous
scale.  We  extracted  the  24-week  data,  and  found  there  may  be  a
small decrease in pain intensity in the participants attending the
Leg Club compared with home visit care (MD -12.75 points on 100
point scale, 95% CI -24.79 to -0.71; Analysis 1.3. However, there is
some  uncertainty  around  this  estimate  due  low  quality  evidence
(downgraded for possible risk of bias and imprecision).

Economic outcomes

Edwards  2009  reported  economic  outcomes  on  a  subset  of  56
participants (out of a total of 67) (Gordon 2006). The incremental
cost  per  healed  ulcer  to  the  service  provider,  carers,  clients  and
community of the Leg Club was reported as AUD 515 at six months
(the cost of usual care was estimated as AUD 1546). However, the
paper did not report the effect estimate used in the analysis clearly
(we are uncertain if there is a difference in the number of people
healed (Analysis 1.1)), and thus, we were unable to verify the cost-
effectiveness estimates.

One  trial  with  184  participants  compared  community-based
exercise and behaviour modification (Lively Legs) plus usual care
(wound care, compression bandages at an outpatient clinic) with
usual care alone (Heinen 2012).

Number of people healed

It was uncertain at 18 months if there was a difference in the number
of people healed between treatment groups, 51/92 healed in Lively
Legs group versus 41/92 in usual care group (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to
1.67; Analysis 2.1), due to possible imprecision around the results
and risk of selection bias (low quality evidence).

Recurrence of venous ulcer

At  18  months  it  was  uncertain  if  there  was  a  difference  in  the
number of people with recurrent ulcers between treatment groups,
32/69  with  recurrence  in  Lively  Legs  group  versus  38/67  in  usual
care  group  (RR  0.82,  95%  CI  0.59  to  1.14;  Analysis  2.2),  due  to
possible imprecision around the results and risk of selection bias
(low quality evidence).

Adherence to compression therapy

Adherence  with  compression  therapy  was  assessed  via  6-item
questionnaire,  and  scored  as  a  categorical  scale:  fully  adherent
(wore  stocking  always,  all  day);  semi-adherent  (wore  stocking
sometimes); non-adherence (occasionally wore stocking- but this
was  not  clearly  defined,  or  did  not  wear  stocking).  We  extracted
the proportion fully adherent (wore stocking always, all day). It is
uncertain if there was a difference in the number people who fully
adhered to compression therapy at 6 months (47/92 in Lively Legs
versus 35/92 in outpatient clinic; RR 1.34, 95% CI (0.97, 1.87)); 12
months (45/92 Lively Legs versus 42/92 outpatient clinic; RR 1.07,
95%  CI  0.79  to  1.45));  and  18  months  (42/92  Lively  Legs  versus
41/92 outpatient clinic; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.41)) (Analysis 2.3),
due to the low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias and
imprecision). The review authors’ estimated measures of effect for
adherence  were  extrapolated  from  percentage  values  presented
in  the  trial  report  (raw  data  not  available),  assuming  that  the
denominators were patients as randomised.

Educational intervention: video compared with written

None  of  our  pre-specified  outcomes  (number  healed,  time  to
healing,  recurrence,  adherence,  quality  of  life,  adverse  events,
pain,  economic  outcomes)  were  reported  in  the  single  trial  that
compared an educational intervention delivered by video with the
same intervention delivered in a pamphlet.

Baquerizo Nole 2015 (20 participants) reported initial and sustained
improvement in knowledge of venous leg ulcer pathophysiology,
management  and  lifestyle,  compression  therapy  and  reasons  to
seek  care  between  visits.  The  authors  reported  no  significant
difference  between  groups  post  education  intervention,  but
reported  that  male  gender  was  associated  with  a  significantly
higher  score  (posttest  p  =0.033).  However,  we  were  unable  to
substantiate  any  difference  in  gender  association  or  knowledge
gain  from  intervention  as  group  means  and  standard  deviations
were missing.

Summary of main results

Low  quality  evidence  from  one  trial  indicates  that  a  community-
based  nursing  clinic  emphasising  socialisation  and  peer-support
(Leg  Club)  did  not  improve  healing  rates,  or  quality  of  life,  any
more  than  home-based  visits  for  people  with  venous  leg  ulcers,
but there was a small, though clinically insignificant, reduction in
pain. The evidence from this trial was downgraded to low quality
due to potential for selection bias and imprecision in the results,
thus  there  is  uncertainty  around  the  effect  estimates.  The  trial
did  not  report  recurrence,  time  to  healing,  adverse  events,  or
adherence  to  compression  therapy  (Summary  of  findings  for  the
main comparison).

Low  quality  evidence  from  another  trial 
indicates  that  a
community-based  nurse  counselling  and  behaviour  modification
and  exercise  program  (Lively  Legs)  did  not  improve  healing
rates,  recurrence  and  adherence  to  compression  any  more  than
attendance  at  an  outpatient  wound  clinic.  The  evidence  was
downgraded to low quality due to potential for selection bias and
imprecision in the results so there is uncertainty around the effect
estimates. This trial did not report time to healing, adverse events,
quality of life, or pain (Summary of findings 2).

One trial of video-delivered education versus written education in
a pamphlet of venous leg ulcer management did not report any of
the outcomes of interest to this review (Summary of findings 3) The
trial reported only patient knowledge of venous leg ulcer disease
and management.

We  found  no  studies  that  assessed  other  interventions  that  aim
to improve adherence to compression therapy, such as healthcare
system or educational interventions.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

There  was  scant  evidence  available  to  enable  us  to  assess  the
benefits of specific educational interventions. i.e. video compared
with written information and no evidence to support or refute the
benefits  of  educational  interventions  generally,  as  no  outcomes
included in this review were reported. There was limited evidence
available  to  enable  us  to  assess  the  benefits  of  community-
based  nursing  models  of  care  (Leg  Club  and  Lively  Legs)  and
no  evidence  to  support  or  refute  other  interventions  that  aim  to
improve adherence to compression therapy such as healthcare and
educational programs.

We  identified  only  one  trial  of  educational  interventions  that
evaluated and compared two educational tools (video and written
pamphlet)  to  improve  patient  knowledge  of  venous  disease  and
ulcer  management  of  patients  with  previous  or  current  active
venous  leg  ulcers  (Baquerizo  Nole  2015).  The  small  trial  of
educational  interventions  was  based  in  Miami  USA  but  results
cannot  be  generalised  due  to  small  sample  size,  and  lack  of
clear  reporting  as  per  CONSORT  guidelines(CONSORT  2010).  The
implied aim of this study was to evaluate and compare educational
interventions  (video  and  written  pamphlet)  to  improve  patient
knowledge.  We  were  unable  to  substantiate  a  difference  in
improved knowledge with video or written pamphlet.

We  identified  two  small  trials  of  community-based  nurse-led
interventions  that  aimed  to  help  people  adhere  to  compression

therapy.  One  trial  of  peer-support  (Leg  Club),  based  in  Australia,
was  based  on  a  UK  program  that  may  be  transferable  to  other
healthcare  systems  internationally.  However,  Edwards  2009  paid
research staff to administer interventions, and volunteer drivers to
collect  and  transport  participants  to  and  from  the  venue,  which
raises  some  questions  about  generalisability  to  usual  practice
settings. The stated aim of this program was primarily to improve
quality of life and psychological well being (Lindsay 2001). We could
not  demonstrate  a  difference  in  quality  of  life  between  groups
in our analysis and an improvement in adherence (and therefore
an  improvement  in  healing  rates  and  reduced  recurrence)  is  not
supported by the available evidence.

The  Lively  Legs  programme  was  developed  in  the  Netherlands
and  is  a  community-based  'coaching'  intervention  to  support
adherence  to  compression.  This  programme  was  also  nurse-led,
but nurses were trained in psychological techniques to tailor their
coaching to assess adherence, motivation, goal-setting and relapse
prevention.  The  Lively  Legs  programme  also  has  potential  to  be
used  internationally,  not  withstanding  the  caveats  required  for
training and cost.

The completeness of the evidence was hampered by failure of trials
to report important outcomes. Time to healing and adverse events
were  not  reported  in  either  trial;  recurrence  and  adherence  were
not reported in the Leg Club trial (Edwards 2009); and quality of life
and pain were not reported in the Lively Legs trial (Heinen 2012) or
the trial of education interventions (Baquerizo Nole 2015).

Quality of the evidence

low  quality  evidence  was  available 

Only 
from  two  trials
that  assessed  the  use  of  community-based  interventions  (67
participants and 184 participants). The evidence was downgraded
because  of  the  potential  for  selection  bias  and  the  low  number
of  participants,  which  leads  to  uncertainties  around  the  effect
estimates, and their precision. (Summary of findings for the main
comparison; Summary of findings 2). Further studies are likely to
change these results, but we do not know in which direction.

There was no evidence available for any of the primary or secondary
outcomes  of  this  review  from  one  small  trial  that  evaluated
educational  interventions  (20  participants)  (Summary  of  findings
3).

We suspect that the small number of trials identified is likely to be
indicative of a lack of research in the area, rather than to publication
bias.

Potential biases in the review process

We are confident that the broad literature search used in this review
has  captured  most  of  the  relevant  literature,  and  minimised  the
likelihood  that  we  have  missed  any  relevant  trials.  Two  review
authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed
risk of bias, in order to minimise bias.

Despite  extensive  searching,  it  is  possible  that  we  missed  some
trials that met our criteria. The literature on patient adherence to
compression is not well indexed because the number of studies is
quite small, while, in trials, adherence to compression is not often
reported and it is unclear whether it is measured. We invite readers
to notify us of any studies, published or unpublished, that meet our
criteria.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

This  is  the  first  review  of  randomised  studies  that  address  this
question, as far as we are aware. Earlier non-randomised studies
indicated  that  an  educational  intervention  (Brooks  2004)  and  a
community-based  nursing  clinic  emphasising  socialisation  and
peer-support (Leg Club) (Lindsay 2001) may increase adherence to
compression,  but  do  not  report  whether  this  leads  to  increased
healing rates and decreased recurrence.

Reviews  clearly  show  that  compression  therapy  is  the  mainstay
treatment  for  healing  venous  ulcers  (Cullum  2001;  Nelson  2012;
O'Meara  2012).  The  benefits  from  such  treatments  diminish
according  to  the  degree  of  non-adherence  to  the  treatment
(Sackett 1996; Van Hecke 2008). Despite the development of new
compression  bandage  device  systems  and  substantial  evidence
from  RCTs  in  the  past  two  decades  (O'Meara  2012),  there  is  a
lack of evidence investigating non-adherence and effectiveness of
strategies to help patients increase adherence.

Implications for practice

The conclusions we can draw in our systematic review are limited
by the quality and number of trials that met our inclusion criteria,
and  a  lack  of  reporting  of  important  outcomes.  The  trials  we
identified were susceptible to bias, and hampered by inadequate
reporting  and  small  sample  sizes,  which  may  have  hidden  real
benefits.  There  is  a  lack  of  studies  that  report  on  interventions
that  improve  adherence  to  compression  therapy.  This  absence
of  reliable  evidence  means  that,  at  present,  it  is  not  possible
either  to  recommend  or  discourage  educational  interventions
(video compared with written information) or nurse-led clinic care
interventions over standard care (home care or outpatient clinic) in
terms of increasing adherence to compression bandaging.

Implications for research

Further  high  quality  research 
is  required  before  definitive
conclusions  can  be  made  about  the  benefits  of  educational
interventions  and  community-based  clinics  incorporating  multi-
to
faceted 
compression therapy, and ultimately improved healing in people
with venous leg ulcers.

to  promote  adherence 

interventions  designed 

To  achieve  benefits  from  current  compression  therapies  we
need  further  innovation  in  treatment  methods  and  a  better
understanding of strategies to improve adherence to intervention.
This  needs  to  be  tested  within  clinical  trials.  Future  trials  should
clearly report baseline participant characteristics (i.e. wound size
and  duration)  and  include  participants  who  do  not  adhere  to
compression  at  baseline  to  reflect  the  variability  in  adherence  in
this  population.  Trialists  could  consider  including  a  lower  level
of compression bandaging as one intervention in order to assess
whether this improves adherence and, potentially, healing (Weller
2012).  Trials  should  report  relevant  outcomes,  such  as  healing
and  recurrence,  as  well  as  possible  reasons  for  non-adherence
from the participant's perspective. Future trials should conform to
(CONSORT 2010) recommendations and be designed with sufficient
power to detect a true treatment effect.

Unclear risk

Author communicated that only a single outcome, patient knowledge, was
measured.

However, the patient knowledge questionnaire appears unvalidated.

Other bias

Unclear risk

None apparent, but scarce reporting in a letter format means it is unclear how
interventions and co-interventions were applied.

Edwards 2009 

Methods

Parallel RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of a community nursing intervention.

Setting: community nursing service within Brisbane and Gold Coast Queensland, Australia

Participants

67 clients (34 intervention; 33 control)

Inclusion criteria: a venous ulcer below the knee; an ABPI > 0·8 and <1·3

Exclusion criteria: ulcers of non-venous origin; clinical signs of a wound infection on admission; clients
unable to sit upright for 1-2 h to be transported and attend a Leg Club; unable to speak or understand
English; cognitive impairment; diabetes mellitus.

Interventions

Control group and intervention group received nursing care consisting of:

• comprehensive assessment, including ABPI;
• referral for further circulatory assessment as indicated;
• venous ulcer treatment based on research protocols;
• advice and support about venous leg ulcers; and
• follow-up management and preventive care

Intervention group: n = 34, received the 5 care items listed above at a Leg Club weekly where they were
provided with opportunities for peer-support, assistance with goal setting and social interaction. Leg
club settings entailed a room or space for social activities and refreshments, and separate areas for
provision of wound care ('dressing stations') where clients were still able to communicate with each
other. The main aim of Leg Club was to reduce the incidence of non-compliance to compression thera-
py.

Control group: n = 33, received the 5 care items in their own homes by a registered nurse.

Outcomes

Outcomes measured at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks:

Outcomes included in this review:

• Proportion of participants with ulcers healed
• Quality of life measured using Spitzers Quality of Life Index (scale limits 0-10, 0 = poor outlook, 10 =

excellent outlook)

• Pain: Medical Outcomes Study Pain Measures (0-100 scale, higher scores indicate higher level of pain)

Other outcomes included in trial but not in review:

• Ulcer area, using dot point method, in cm2

Notes

We extracted data for 56 participants at 12 weeks as that was the number enrolled, we extracted data
for 67 participants enrolled at 24 weeks.

We contacted authors to clarify whether multiple publications were from a single trial. This was con-
firmed.

All outcomes

Low risk

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

24 weeks: Intervention group lost 8/34 (23%) recruits to follow-up. Control
group lost 7/33 (21%) to follow-up, but as the proportions excluded from
analysis, and the reasons for losses were similar in both groups, this was un-
likely to bias the effect estimates in favour of either group

Selective reporting (re-
porting bias)

High risk

Recurrence, and new ulcers measured, but not reported. Different pain mea-
sure reported in pilot study. Unclear whether adherence to compression was
measured; it was not reported as an outcome

Other bias

Unclear risk

Sequential estimation was used, as the sample size was not fixed in advance.
Instead, data were evaluated as they were collected, and further sampling was
stopped in accordance with a pre-defined stopping rule as soon as significant
results were observed.

This would suggest that the researchers may have checked results during trial
and stopped recruiting when they achieved a statistically significant result.

Participants in both groups were similar at baseline in terms ulcer size and du-
ration. Co-interventions were not reported

Methods

Participants

Interventions

Multi-centred RCT; stratified by centre, age, sex, aetiology

Setting: outpatient clinics, the Netherlands

Adults with venous leg ulcer or ulcer with mixed aetiology of venous insufficiency and arteriolar, or mi-
nor arterial, insufficiency.

Inclusion criteria: a current leg ulcer of venous or mixed aetiology, or one in the month prior to inclu-
sion.

Exclusion criteria: full immobility; insufficient mental capacity; or insufficient comprehension of the
Dutch language.

Randomised: n = 184

Mean age: Intervention group = 65 years (range 27 to 91); Control group = 67 years (range 29 to 88).

Proportion of women: 60% both groups

BMI: Intervention group = 31 (20-53); Control group = 29 (18-50); 49% BMI > 30 in Intervention group,
30% BMI > 30 in Control group.

Intervention group: 38% had venous aetiology; Control group: 42% had venous aetiology

Intervention group: 69% had wound at baseline; Control group : 66% had wound at baseline

Wound duration at baseline (n = 122): Intervention group = mean 7 months (range 0.3-54); Control
group = mean 7.3 months (range 0.8-54)

Intervention 'Lively Legs', n = 92 randomised, n = 69 included in analysis: nurse-led self-management
programme on physical activity, addressing walking behaviour and exercises, and adherence to com-
pression therapy, for 6-month duration. The programme was based on Social Cognitive Theory, Goal
Setting Theory, the Precaution Adoption Process Model, and Motivational Interviewing. Consisted of
2-6 counselling sessions, the first and final ones face to face; the second to fifth either face to face or by
phone. The first session involved assessing patients' lifestyles, and subsequent sessions involved evalu-
ation of behaviour change and giving feedback.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Control, usual care in an outpatient clinic, n = 92 randomised, n = 67 included in analysis: this nurse-
led programme received care as usual according to venous leg ulcer guidelines, application of wound
dressings and compression in weekly outpatient clinic visits, but did not include any counselling, or in-
cluded only brief lifestyle and adherence counselling.

Outcomes

Outcomes included in this review:

Outcomes measured at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months

• Proportion of participants with ulcers healed
• Adherence with compression therapy, assessed via 6-item questionnaire, and scored as a categorical
scale: fully adherent (wore stocking always, all day); semi-adherent (wore stocking sometimes); non-
adherence (occasionally wore stocking- not clearly defined, or did not wear stocking)

• Proportion of participants who had a recurring wound by 18 months

Other outcomes included in trial but not in review:

• Walking  activity:  measured  by  self-report  using  the  International  Physical  Activity  Quesionnaire
(IPAC), and objectively by the Physial Activity Monitor (PAM; accelerometer), measured for 7 days pre-
ceding follow-up time point; reported in minutes, dichotomised to 10 minutes for 5 days/week; and 30
minutes for 5 days/week. Also measured physical activity using the Physical Activity Recall inventory
(PAR) - unsure how this data was used

• Leg exercises - assessed by participant self-report during interview
• Proportion of participants who performed leg exercises
• Time until 25% of participants had a recurrence
• Wound months (all wounds) - unclear how assessed
• Wound months (new wounds) - unclear how assessed

Notes

We extracted the proportion fully adherent to compression therapy at 6, 12 and 18 months; proportion
of participants who had a recurrence and proportion healed at 18 months.

Trialist reported the percentage that were fully adherent, but did not report raw data (number who
were adherent or denominator); so we calculated the number of fully adherent people using the per-
centage from the trial report and number randomised. Data could not be extracted for time to healing
(wound months)

Interventions

Intervention group: exercise plus usual care

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

A 12 week home-based unsupervised progressive resistance exercise program that requires no ad-
ditional equipment for participants. The exercise intervention will be administered by telephone
calls from the principal researcher at 4 timepoints (Week 1, 3, 6 and 9) over the duration of the in-
tervention.

Participants have the program individually tailored to suit the strength and endurance of their calf
muscle in consultation with the principal researcher who is a RN and Accredited Exercise Physiolo-
gist.

The exercise protocol is split into 3 stages

1. Seated heel raises

2. Standing heel raises (both legs)

3. Standing heel raise (one leg)

The participants progress through each stage by the various 4 levels

1. 10 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day

2. 15 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day

3. 20 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day

4. 25 repetitions x 3 sets x 3 times per day

Participants move on to the next level or stage the once they have comfortably completed the cur-
rent level for at least 3 days or until ready to progress based on their feedback and in consultation
with the principal researcher.

The exercise program is in addition to usual care (compression bandaging and wound care)

Participants will also be encouraged to walk at least three times per week for 30 minutes if possible
(can be broken into 10 minutes three times) in conjunction with the resistance program outlined
above. Walking recommendations will be progressive and individualised.

Control group: usual care

Usual care (compression bandaging and wound care)

Outcomes

Healing rates of venous leg ulcers

Functional outcomes as measured by Tinetti score, range of ankle motion (goniometer)

Physical activity as measured objectively by pedometer steps, self-reported through VaLUE ques-
tionnaire and adherence to program as collected over the phone

Planned  meta-analyses,  subgroup  and  sensitivity  analyses  could  not  be  performed,  as  we  included  only  three  trials  with  different
interventions in the review.
Adherence to compression was a planned secondary outcome in the protocol, but we changed this to a primary outcome to reflect the
review objectives better.
We reported in the protocol that we would contact relevant companies, but, as the intervention did not include compression or other
devices, this was not necessary.
