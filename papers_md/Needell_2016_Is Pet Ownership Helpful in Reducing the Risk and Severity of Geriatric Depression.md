Abstract: Many community-dwelling older adults are searching for ways to remain mentally and
physically healthy as they age. One frequently offered suggestion is for older people to adopt a pet to
avoid loneliness, to stay socially engaged, and to stave off depression. Despite the ubiquity of this
advice in popular culture, research ﬁndings are equivocal on whether pet ownership is beneﬁcial to
the physical and psychological health of older adults. This article evaluates published data relating
to pet ownership and its possible impact on depression and related symptoms in the elderly.

1. Introduction

Depression among the elderly has serious medical, social, and ﬁnancial sequelae for those
who suffer from it as well as for their caregivers. Multiple studies have documented the medical
co-morbidities, decreased life expectancies, and other physical complications that accompany
untreated and incompletely treated depression in the elderly [1]. The indirect ﬁnancial costs to society
attributable to geriatric depression—for example, the lost economic productivity and the personal
suffering associated with caregiving, or the costs of residential treatment—are just beginning to be
appreciated [2].

As a result, many older people seek ways to avoid depression or to use psychosocial adjuncts
to augment medication and traditional psychotherapies. Senior centers, adult education classes,
and group exercise classes, among other community-based programs, are social programs designed to
keep older people engaged and less isolated with the hope that increased socialization will lead to
improved mental health.

Another idea that has gained traction recently is pet ownership. Pets, particularly dogs
and cats, are seen not only as providers of unconditional love for their elderly owners but also
as companions and a means through which otherwise isolated seniors may re-establish human
connections. A pet also helps an otherwise sedentary senior remain active, which in itself may confer
physical and psychological beneﬁts. Popular media is replete with the images of older adults and their
“four-legged friends” [3,4].

However, pet ownership may not necessarily be beneﬁcial for an older person, especially one with
a mental or physical disability. Pets can be costly and can consume much time and energy. They can
be noisy and disruptive to neighbors and can place elderly owners at risk of falls at home or while on
walks. There is also the question of how an older person, already facing multiple losses, will deal with
the death of a beloved pet or with choosing between caring for oneself or for one’s pet.

The lead author, the Medical Director of a geriatric-focused Psychiatric Mobile Crisis Team,
has seen multiple older patients with mental and physical health issues for whom pet ownership
presented a barrier to treatment. In one case, an elderly patient refused necessary in-patient psychiatric

admission because she had no one to care for her beloved cat. In another, near-tragic situation, a severely
depressed man in his 80s did not leave the house for almost two months, feeding himself and his
dog only what was in the home; when the Mobile Crisis Team arrived, they were subsisting on salad
dressing and mayonnaise. A third patient, a retired older nurse, hid her frailty and loss of function out
of fear that she would be separated from her dog if placed in a nursing home. Mobile Crisis was called
after she had not seen a doctor or reﬁlled prescriptions in months, requiring a medical hospitalization.

2. Methods

For this article a literature review was conducted to assess the current state of knowledge on
pet ownership and depression in older adults. Each author conducted an independent literature
review. The PubMed/MedLine database was accessed using the MeSH terms “older adults”, “elderly”,
“depression”, “loneliness”, “pets”, “pet ownership”, and “animal-assisted therapy”. Only articles
in English published after 1990 were included. Studies focused on people whose primary diagnosis
was dementia or other cognitive impairment were excluded. The reference sections of published
articles were reviewed for citations to relevant works. Given the relatively sparse literature available,
multiple types of publications were reviewed, including empirical research, position papers, editorials,
and case reports. Journals included medical and psychiatric publications, anthropologic and sociology
publications, and veterinary publications. Studies of “animal-assisted therapy” were included as this
material had relevant research ﬁndings related to depression and animal involvement in older adults.
A total of 21 scholarly articles were ultimately included. They were evaluated for relevance
to the prevention or treatment of geriatric depression, methodology, subject selection, and ﬁndings.
Some studies addressed geriatric depression directly while others focused on related conditions, such as
loneliness, social isolation/connectness, perceptions of overall health and well-being, and interactions
with the medical community.

3. Results

The most consistent ﬁnding throughout all studies was the lack of deﬁnitive conclusions; no study
showed that pet ownership conferred either clear beneﬁts or clear risks regarding the mental health of
elderly people.

3.1. What Is the Relationship between Pet Ownership and Depression in the Elderly?

Five studies directly addressed the question of whether pet ownership was correlated with lower
levels of depression in older adults. None found overwhelming evidence to support the popular
assertion that owning a pet contributes to the alleviation of depression. Details are shown in Table 1.

3.1.1. Positive Effect on Depression

One telephone survey of 201 adults ranging in age from 19 to 94 years old found decreased levels
of depression in unmarried, dog owners. Levels of depression in married dog owners were not affected.
The survey also found that dog ownership was associated with a greater sense of self-reported personal
life satisfaction (though a lower sense of wellbeing for men) [5]. A study of post-myocardial infarction
patients found that depressed post-MI patients who owned pets had better medical outcomes and
lower mortality rates than depressed post-MI patients who did not own pets. However, pet ownership
itself did not decrease primary rates of depression; thus pet ownership in that study appeared to
moderate the effects, if not the rates, of depression [6].

3.1.2. Absent or Exacerbating Effect on Depression

The survey of 201 adults found that dog ownership had no effect on depression overall but that
dog ownership was associated with lower levels of depression in younger, but not older, adults [5].
Similarly, the study of post-myocardial infarction patients found that pet ownership did not decrease
overall rates of depression [6]. A survey of older pet owners in Australia found that pet owners
did not report better mental or physical health nor did they use fewer services. That study found
a small, but not statistically signiﬁcant, exacerbating effect of pet owners reporting higher scores
on the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) than non-pet owners, indicating that some pet owners
reported higher depression scores than their non-pet owning counterparts. The authors concluded that
“on average, both pet owners and carers in this study reported signiﬁcantly more depressive symptoms”
than people without pets [7]. In a similar vein, a study of clients of two veterinary clinics and one pet
grooming salon found that adults with high levels of attachment to their pets actually reported higher
levels of depression than those with lower self-reported levels of attachment. That study also included
the important observation that “elders who cannot adequately provide for their dog have higher levels
of depression than those who can” [8]. An epidemiological study in Norway found that self-reported
rates of depression were higher in cat owners than in dog owners or non-pet owners [9].

3.2. What Is the Relationship between Pet Ownership and Traits/Symptoms Associated with Depression in
the Elderly?

Multiple studies and reviews looked at factors that can lead to or accompany depression in older
adults to see what effect, if any, pet ownership had on their presence or severity. These factors can be
relevant on their own or could be seen as “surrogates” for depression. Details are shown in Table 2.

3.2.1. Loneliness and Pet Ownership

The most frequently studied “surrogate for depression” was loneliness. One study of 175 women
in senior centers and pet-friendly senior living residences found that pet owners self-reported less
loneliness than non-pet owners. [10]. The same lead author, in another analysis of the same data,
concluded that pet attachment mediated the effect of loneliness in older women [11]. In a study of
older patients in a primary care medical setting, researchers found that pet owners were 36% less likely
than non-pet owners to report loneliness [12]. Confounding the issue, though, was a review of data
from 5210 people over 50 in England that revealed a complex interaction between pet ownership and
loneliness—“pet ownership can be a response to loneliness for the always lonely and a protection for
those who recovered from loneliness.” Their study found that having a pet increased the likelihood of
self-reported loneliness among females and that women who were lonely were more likely to own
pets [13].

3.2.2. Social Engagement and Pet Ownership

The social connectedness that can accompany pet ownership was also reviewed. One comprehensive
literature review of all types of human–animal interactions concluded that “pets and companion
animals seem to reduce psychological stress by altering the owner’s perceptions and making situations
and people seem more benign”. The author noted, however, that the “impact of pet ownership seems to
be most important for highly stressed or socially isolated individuals” [17]. Social isolation was at the
heart of a more sociologically based study that found that pets, particularly dogs, “can serve as a kind
of medium through which social contacts can be established in everyday situations”. Pets, the authors
noted, can help older people structure their day and be a point of interaction with other people [14].

3.2.3. Activities of Daily Living and Pet Ownership

Raina et al, in a telephone survey of community-dwelling people over 65, found that Activities
of Daily Living (ADLs) declined further in non-pet owners than in pet owners. The study found
no statistical signiﬁcance in assessing whether pet ownership impacted psychological well-being in
older adults [15].

3.2.4. Somatic Issues and Pet Ownership

Pets can serve as a way for older adults to engage in society at large, but they can also be a way for
isolated older adults to engage with the health care system and other agencies. One author opined that
pet ownership might be a way to reach otherwise disenfranchised older Latinos, for whom animals are
often more than companions or pets [18].

Other studies have looked at the impact of pet ownership on medical health, speciﬁcally at the
number of medical visits made by older adults with pets versus those without pets. A study of one
large group of one health care maintainence Medicare program recipients showed that people with pets
had fewer patient-initiated doctor visits and concluded that “owning a dog provided a stress buffer,
whereas other types of pets did not.” By “stress buffer”, the authors meant that dog owners were better
able to tolerate normal stressful life events, speciﬁcally the loss of loved ones [16]. A large Norwegian
study showed an increase in overall positive health–related characteristics in older pet-owning adults,
other than ﬁnding that cat owners had higher body mass indexes (BMIs) than non-cat owners [9].

3.3. What Speciﬁc Risks Are Posed by Pet Ownership in the Elderly?

Fewer studies looked at the potential downside of pet ownership among the elderly. One author
discussed many problems that older pet owners might face. Lifetime costs of pet ownership average
between $8000 and $10,000 [19]. Pets can serve as vectors for disease, can contribute to falls, and can
cause conﬂict with neighbors [19], and, of course, pets die. Older people often have older pets and
there is no guarantee that the person will outlive the pet. Surprisingly, the literature search did not

Geriatrics 2016, 1, 24

highlight studies that investigated the speciﬁc issue of grief and depression in older adults after the
death of a pet, although it was discussed in at least two studies [15,20].

There were, however, two articles about attempted or completed suicide that included a beloved
pet in the action. In one case, a woman with depression brought her dog with her into the garage,
where she turned on the engine of her car, killing both herself and her dog [21]. Another author
cited one case in which an older woman tried to strangle her dog before she took an overdose;
the dog escaped and the woman survived and after hospitalization, she was reunited with her dog.
The same author also reported on an elderly woman who gave her dog away before attempting suicide;
after treatment, she too was reunited with her pet [22].

3.4. What Beneﬁts Are Conferred by Association with Pets without the Full Commitment of Pet Ownership?

Animal-assisted therapy is increasingly used in working with the elderly; it is not uncommon to
see animals visiting nursing homes, hospitals, and senior centers. This option allows older adults to
have access to animals without assuming the ﬁnancial, emotional, social, and physical obligations of
pet ownership. While most studies of the psychological value of animal assisted therapy have focused
on people with dementia and cognitive impairment, some address whether having access to animals
has any impact on depression and overall psychological well being.

In a review of the literature, Cherniack and Cherniack found “mixed results” in the use of animals
in people with depression and schizophrenia. They noted that several “trials of animal-assisted therapy
demonstrated improvements in behavioral symptom scores in small numbers of subjects of limited
duration” but stopped short of giving a full endorsement to this form of therapy [23]. Another large
literature review looked at animal-assisted interventions for elderly patients with dementia and
associated disorders. These authors noted that the wide disparity in study design and execution made
it difﬁcult to come to a consensus abut the efﬁcacy of using animals in this population. They did note
that animal involvement helped in “calming of agitated behavior and (had) positive effects on quality
of social interaction and mood disturbances”, which could have relevance for depressed cognitively
intact elders [24].

A small study of 16 elderly residents of a South African nursing home reviewed the Beck
Depression and Anxiety Inventory (BDI and BAI) scores before and after six weeks of visits with
a therapy pet. These were compared with controls who did not see the animal. Mean BDI scores
went down from 19.86 to 11.86 (p = 0.017) in the animal group compared with the control group
with no change noted in anxiety scores. The authors further noted that the people in the animal
group reported mood and psychological beneﬁts that were not captured by the ratings scales [25].
A study of elderly psychiatric inpatients with diagnoses of dementia, depression, and psychosis
showed a 50% improvement on the Geriatric Depression Scale and a four-point improvement on the
Mini-Mental State Examination in patients exposed to pet therapy compared with a control group [26].

4. Discussion

At present, there is insufﬁcient evidence to back the claim in popular culture that pet ownership
is helpful in preserving the mental health of older adults. Loneliness and social isolation seem to be
ameliorated by pet ownership, but this does not necessarily correlate to lower rates of depression or
reduction in the severity of depressive symptoms.

This review has several limitations. There was a relative paucity of research on the direct
connection between pet ownership and geriatric depression and what studies were available had vastly
differing methodologies and subject pools. In many cases, “markers” or “stand-ins” for depression,
most notably, loneliness and social isolation, were studied rather than depression itself. This can be
misleading, as not all people who are socially isolated or lonely meet criteria for major depression and
many older people who do meet criteria for major depression are not lonely or isolated. There was no
study directly addressing the percentages of older pet owners with depression versus the percentage
of older non-pet owners with depression.

Geriatrics 2016, 1, 24

Future studies might look at whether older pet owners with depression have new onset of illness
in later years or whether they have had depressive episodes over their lifetimes. Studies might also
investigate whether lifelong pet owners have lower lifetime rates of geriatric depression than do those
who have never owned pets. It would be valuable to investigate whether geriatric depression remits
when a person becomes a pet owner as well as whether geriatric depression worsens when a person is
less able to care for a pet or when that pet gets ill or dies.

Finally, a study could could compare pet owners with people involved in animal-assisted therapy
to assess for rates of depression as well as rates of loneliness and other “markers”. It is possible
that animal-assisted therapy and other means of connecting older people with animals without the
entanglements and commitment of actual pet ownership is a preferable option in some cases.

Clinicians and other service providers need to be aware of the potential beneﬁts of pet ownership
but also of the needs that might arise in older adults caring for pets. Mental health providers might
consider partnering with veterinary practices, pet stores and shelters, pet service agencies (such as
groomers and dog walkers), and animal-assistance organizations to help their older patients get
the most out of their relationships with their pets while reducing the burden of caring for them.
Clinicians should be wary of suggesting that their older patients become pet owners as a way of
maintaining mental and physical health. They should investigate whether their patients have the
ﬁnancial, physical, and psychological means to care for both themselves and a pet. As an alternative,
animal-assisted therapy might allow them the connection with an animal while alleviating them of the
burdens of pet ownership.
