Psychiatry is having a great time. Over the last few years, we have seen an exceptional explosion in neuroscience knowl-
edge, and especially in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which environmental and genetic fac-
tors affect the brain and regulate behaviour, while at the same interacting with peripheral (‘body’) functions. While this
explosion, and its translational implications, can be seen across a variety of fields, this editorial will focus on one par-
ticular area where these developments have been more noticeable: the interaction between neuroscience, mental health
and the immune system. This editorial will focus on the broader impact of this discipline as an example of successful
translational neuroscience overcoming the brain-mind-body trichotomy.

Psychiatry is having a great time. Over the last few
years, we have seen an exceptional explosion in neuro-
science knowledge, and especially in our understanding
of the molecular mechanisms through which environ-
mental and genetic factors affect the brain and regulate
behaviour (Insel & Landis, 2013), while at the same
functions
time interacting with peripheral
(Balon, 2015). While this explosion, and its translational
implications, can be seen across a variety of fields, this
editorial will focus on one particular area where these
developments have been more noticeable (and also an
area that is particularly dear to the author): the interaction
between neuroscience, mental health and the immune
system. This area, called psychoneuroimmunology more
than 30 years ago (Ader, 1981) and recently renamed
immunopsychiatry (Bullmore & Lynall, 2014), has now
started to deliver translational findings relevant to mental
health; to etiological mechanisms, diagnosis and treat-
ment. This editorial will also focus on the broader impact
of this new discipline as an example of successful trans-
lational neuroscience overcoming the brain-mind-body
trichotomy.

At the least three consecutive generations of scientists
have tried to understand the processes by which
immune system participates to the pathogenesis of men-
tal disorders and influence the response to psychotropic
medications. However, the recent surge of interest in
this research field is due to both an increased clinical
knowledge of the role of immune processes in health
and diseases, and to a detailed understanding of the
molecular and cellular basis of immune-brain communi-
cation. Moreover, what I find really interesting about
this research field, is that it provides a conceptual frame-
work that integrates genetic, developmental and social
factors while being essentially biologically-based;
interaction
is an example of a successful
hence it
between neuroscience and mental health.

Of immunity, genes and society

The prevailing model explaining how the immune sys-
tem induces psychiatric symptoms builds on the brain,
the body and the mind, while also offering convergent
mechanisms able to overcome this trichotomy. In a
purposely over-simplified summary, increased activa-
tion of the peripheral (body) immune system leads
to: (1) the production of neurotoxic metabolites of the
tryptophan cascade, which is activated both in the
brain and in the liver; (2) increased activation of micro-
glia cells (the immune cells of the brain) by circulating
cytokines; and (3) changes in brain function via affer-
ents pathways localised in the vagal nerve stimulated
peripherally (Dantzer et al. 2008). At a molecular/
cellular level, these alterations result in changes in

and decreased serotonergic and dopaminergic activity)
and an inhibition of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis,
that is, of the birth of new neurones and the formation
of new dendrites and synapses (Borsini et al. 2015).
Undoubtedly, the peripheral (‘body’) localisation of
the primum movens for neuropsychiatric symptoms
within this framework is already a quite revolutionary
development, overcoming the brain-mind-body tri-
cothomy. However, I believe that the true strength of
this model is its ability to integrate genetic and social
factors into a single biological framework.

Some gene variants

that are associated with
increased immune activation are also associated
with an increased risk of psychopathology (Bufalino
et al. 2013). Indeed, we have shown that immune
genes may have larger effects on behavioural out-
comes than ‘psychiatric genes’. We compared the
effects of a polymorphism in the interleukin-6 (IL-6)
gene and of the well-known short/long polymorph-
ism in the serotonin transporter on predicting depres-
sion during an inflammatory status induced by
treatment with interferon-alpha for viral hepatitis
(Bull et al. 2009). While the serotonin transporter poly-
morphism predicts depressive symptoms with an
effects size of 0.2–0.3, the IL-6 polymorphism has
an effect size of 0.6–0.8. The simple notion that an
immune gene, which has nothing to do with neuro-
transmitters, can regulate behaviour, is yet another
piece of evidence further overcoming the brain-
mind-body tricothomy.

Other patients develop increased immune activation
(and hence an increased risk of psychopathology) not
for a genetic predisposition, but because of environ-
mental factors, including exposure to trauma, social
deprivation, or unhealthy nutrition. Exposure to
trauma early in life is one of the most established
environmental factors increasing the risk for mental
disorders, and we have shown that early life trauma
activates the immune system in young adults even in
the absence of psychopathology (Danese et al. 2007).
Interestingly,
these young adults with increased
immune activation may be at higher risk of developing
psychopathology in the future, as shown by prospect-
ive studies (see below). Moreover, increased immune
activation has been shown following a variety of social
adversities, including exposure to personal maltreat-
ment or violence, socioeconomic disadvantage or iso-
lation and other forms of chronic stress (Miller et al.
2008, 2009; Danese et al. 2009; Baumeister et al.
2015a). Of course, we know that exposure to social
adversities is a risk factor for the development of men-
tal health problems, and it is tempting to speculate that
these two phenomena are causally related:
that
increased inflammation induced by social adversities
increases the risk of psychopathology by altering

brain function. We will debate more causation v. asso-
ciation below.

Until now we have looked at factors that putatively
increase the risk of mental disorders by increasing
immune activation; but there are also factors that puta-
tively decrease this risk by reducing immune activa-
tion, and nutrition is one of these. Micronutrients
associated with high levels of
fish intake (poly-
unsaturated fatty acids, PUFAs) are known to be
both preventative and therapeutic in mild/moderate
forms of depression and perhaps protective toward
the development of psychosis (Su et al. 2015). Both
direct action on the brain (increasing neuroplasticity)
and indirect action via the immune system (anti-
inflammatory effects) have been demonstrated for
PUFAs, and the latter mechanisms again exemplifies
a pathway through which an environmental factor
can regulate the mind via the brain and the body:
another piece of evidence overcoming the brain-
mind-body tricothomy.

So, why is the immune system regulated by so many
environmental factors, and especially by exposure to
stressors early in life? One explanation is that the
immune system is ‘programmed’ to remain hyper-
active during the whole life as this confers protection
from infections in a high-stress environment (let us
not forget that most stressors, until a few hundred
years ago, entailed exposure to predators, physical
trauma, wounding and infections). Indeed, one may
even argue that depression is the ‘price to pay’ so
that our organism survives under conditions of stress
(Raison et al. 2006). Obviously today most stressors
are psychosocial/relational, and do not entail physical
trauma, so the benefits of this mechanism do no longer
outweigh the costs; but it is no use arguing with evo-
lution, unfortunately.

Of chicken, egg and causality

All of the studies mentioned until now are association
studies, and do not imply causation; indeed, all this
evidence can as easily be interpreted more conserva-
tively as indicating that genetic or social factors are
independently associated with both immune activation
and (through unknown mechanisms) increased risk
of mental disorders. So, how can we try to test the
hypothesis that indeed there is a causal relationship
between genetics/social factors and mental disorders
through immune-related mechanisms?

What if the cause temporarily precedes the effects?
Indeed, many longitudinal studies have shown that
high levels of inflammation in otherwise healthy indi-
viduals predict the future development of psychopath-
ology over the subsequent months or years (Valkanova

sadness

inflammation)

from transient

et al. 2013). What if we can induce the effects (psycho-
pathology) by experimentally activating the cause, that
is, by increasing immune activation in otherwise
healthy individuals? Indeed, administration of an
immune activator for experimental or therapeutic
purposes can induce neuropsychiatric symptoms, ran-
ging (in a dose-dependent relationship with the sever-
ity of
to
clinically significant depression, anxiety, or even (rare-
ly) psychotic symptoms (Capuron & Miller, 2004;
Harrison et al. 2009). What if drugs that are used rou-
tinely for the treatment of the effects (psychopath-
ology) have an effect on the cause (the immune
system)? Indeed, both antidepressants and antipsy-
chotics have been found to be (on balance, although
not unequivocally)
immunosuppressant and anti-
inflammatory (Baumeister et al. 2015b). And, finally,
what if we can eliminate the effects (psychopathology)
by eliminating the cause (with anti-inflammatory
medications)?

Recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis of ran-
domised controlled trials using anti-inflammatory
medications in mental disorders (mostly small studies)
have shown that adding an anti-inflammatory to an
antidepressant or an antipsychotic increases the effi-
cacy of these medications (Fond et al. 2014; Na et al.
2014). But one large study seems to contradict every-
thing (Raison et al. 2013). This trial used a drug for
rheumatoid arthritis, Infliximab, as adjuvant to antide-
pressants in treatment-resistant depressed patients.
Overall the study is negative: there is no potentiation
of antidepressant effects. However, the study addition-
ally suggests (in a secondary analysis and with results
not reaching statistical significance) that there is indeed
a potentiation of antidepressant effects in those
patients who have higher levels of inflammation at
baseline (which, in a way, makes sense). Of note is
also the evidence from our studies offering a ‘mirror-
image’ of
showing that
depressed patients with high inflammation do not
respond to conventional antidepressants or antipsy-
chotics (Cattaneo et al. 2013; Mondelli et al. 2015).
One can see the possible ‘personalised treatment algo-
rithm’ developing in the future, if and when all of these
studies will be replicated: patients with normal levels
of inflammation could be reassured that they will
respond to first-line antidepressants and antipsycho-
tics, and will be started on routine medications; and
patients with increased inflammation could be sup-
ported more intensively with personalised treatment
algorithms and more assertive, adjuvant strategies,
including anti-inflammatories. However, larger trials
are needed to test this therapeutic model, and at this
stage we ought to discourage patients from taking

Binging together brain, mind and body without
losing the primacy of the brain

Why is psychoneuroimmunology (immunopsychiatry)
important, and why have I used it as an example of a
successful interaction between neuroscience and men-
tal health? Because it has brought neuroscience and
mental health close to medicine again, while at the
same time offering a biological framework that can
incorporate genetics, social and environmental factors.
Even if this research field will not offer the revolution-
ary treatments of the future, its cultural impact cannot
be emphasised enough. By bringing neuroscience and
mental health close to medicine again,
it has also
shown that, while the brain is influenced by the
body, the mind is the product of the brain.

Saying that the brain is in the body, and influenced
by the body, is an obvious concept. But why saying
that the mind is the product of the brain is considered con-
troversial? If we cut the blood supply to the brain, our
mind dies: this is perhaps the strongest proof. But if we
are hypoglycaemic we faint or convulse, if we have
low thyroid hormones or high calcium levels we
become depressed, and if we have liver failure or
Cushing’s syndrome we develop delusions or halluci-
nations. And, consistently with this notion, high levels
of peripheral immune activation makes us depressed,
anxious and (possibly) psychotic. All of these effects
require changes in the brain.

Hippocrates said this first. There is nothing else
beside the brain that generates our emotions, thoughts
and behaviour. Unless we believe that mental proces-
sers are the product of a spiritual entity–a soul–then
all of these functions are in the brain. Is this ‘reduction-
ism’? Nobody accuses cardiologists to be reductionist
when they defend the primacy on the heart for the cir-
culation of the blood. You stop the heart and there is
no circulation. And I do not see vascular surgeons
up in arms, accusing cardiologists to be reductionist.
Of course the brain is a complex organ, and we do
not really understand it yet. Our model for understand-
ing the biology of mental disorder is still at the begin-
ning, and we can only try to understand how this
complexity is influenced by a myriad of factors such
in utero environment, social
as genetic make-up,
experience, upbringing, nutrition, poverty, social sup-
port, urbanicity–but all of
these factors need the
brain to exert their effects on the mind: to protect
from, or increase the risk for, mental disorders,
which are disorders of emotions, thoughts and behav-
iour. The fact that there are more synapses in the
human brain than there are stars in the Milky Way–

literally–makes super difficult to understand how the
brain generates the mind, but this should not–cannot–
push us into a defensive position assuming that
‘there must be something else besides the brain’. This
is what our ancestors thought about lightening, volca-
noes, earthquake and eclipses, before science demon-
strated that these are not due to the rage of the gods
or the breathing of a dragon.
