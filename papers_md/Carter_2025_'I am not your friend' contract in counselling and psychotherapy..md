The largest professional body of counsellors in Australia defines the relationship between counsellor 
and  client  as  contractual  ‘and  nothing  else’.  While  contract  law  has  been  traditionally  associated 
with  ‘rational’, arms-length, commercial  relationships,  counselling and psychotherapy  have been  as-
sociated with intimate, emotional relationships, work, and exchange. What is the significance, there-
fore,  of  these  seemingly  dissonant  discourses  coming  together  in  the  counselling  and  therapeutic 
relationship? Is there a place for formal and distant contract law in the flexible and intimate therapy 
room? This article examines the role of contract in counselling and psychotherapy, and  rather than 
finding  a  dissonance,  it  finds  an  important  and  productive  relationship  between  the  two.  Drawing 
on  interviews  with  registered  practitioners  in  Australia,  this  article  shows  that  contract  performs 
both  an  ‘infrastructural’  and ‘therapeutic’  function. It  provides a framework  for  service  delivery  and 
the  meeting  of  professional  standards,  while  simultaneously  operating  as  a  therapeutic  tool. 
Importantly,  in  this  self-regulated  setting,  the  analysis  demonstrates  how  practitioners  navigate  the 
‘formality’ of contract to advance a broader formation of professional identity.

This  article  is  about  the  relationship  between  counselling,  psychotherapy,  and  the  law  of 
contract.  Contract  has  been  described  as  the  ‘lingua  franca’  of  contemporary  life,1 and  it 
appears  in  many  and  varied  areas,  including  the  field  of  counselling  and  psychotherapy 
(‘counselling’).2 The  British  Association  for  Counselling  and  Psychotherapy,  for  example,

2  While there are important differences between the professions and practice of psychotherapy and counselling, for ease of 
expression,  we  use  the  term  ‘counselling’  here  to  refer  to  both.  See  below  for  a  discussion  of  the  terminology  and  its  applica-
tion in Australia.

identifies  contract  as  a  marker  of  and  tool  for  building  appropriate  relationships  between 
practitioner  and  client.3 The  New  Zealand  Association  of  Counsellors  requires  ‘clear  and 
reasonable’  terms  and  ‘clear  contracts’  in  its  Code  of  Ethics.4 In  Australia,  contract  also 
defines  the  relationship  between  counsellor  and  client;  however,  the  Code  of  Ethics  and 
Practice  of  the  Australian  Counselling  Association  (ACA)  is  striking  in  its  language  regard-
ing  contract,  stating  that  ‘counselling  is  a  formal  and  contracted  relationship  and  nothing 
else’.5 Together,  these  statements  locate  the  contract  in  counselling.  But  they  do  so  both 
within and  beyond  the everyday, practical, and  commercial  aspects of the profession and  its 
work, indeed linking contract to the very definition of the relationship itself. This use of con-
tract is striking: one that (at least at first glance) seems at odds with the intimate, emotional, 
and flexible interpersonal and relational aspects of the counsellor–client relationship.

Despite  the  central  role  of  contract  for  this  sizeable  and  important  part  of  the  mental 
healthcare system  and  professions, little  consideration has  been given  to  the legal aspects  of 
the  profession  by  scholarship  in  Australia  and  other  jurisdictions.6 This  includes  consider-
ation of the role of contract for the profession. To advance knowledge of the role of contract 
in the counselling context, we report here on a socio-legal, interview-based study with regis-
tered counsellors and psychotherapists working in Australia. We report empirical findings re-
garding the role and use of contracts in this setting. We show that contract does indeed play 
a central role, present not only in the formal governance documents of the profession, but in 
counselling  practice  itself,  including  in  the  ways  counsellors  conceive  of  their  role,  profes-
sion, and clinical work. We identify two parallel roles for contract in the counselling context. 
First,  contract  plays  a  clear  ‘infrastructural  role’,  governing  the  profession  and  its  work.  For 
the  profession,  it  facilitates  the  formalization  of  professional  self-regulation  and  greater  rec-
ognition  of  the  role  of  counsellors  in  the  Australian  mental  health  system.  For  the  work  of 
counsellors, it facilitates the practical, commercial aspects of service provision. Secondly, the 
contract  also  performs  a  ‘therapeutic  role’,  beyond  those  associated  with  the  professional, 
practical,  and  commercial  aspects  of  service  provision.  From  a  tool  of  therapy  itself  to  per-
forming psychological boundary work for the practitioner and client, the contract has an ac-
tive  life  and  utility  in  the  therapeutic  domain.  While  these  are  different  roles  for  contract, 
our  analysis  identifies  that  both  are  facilitated  in  part  by  a  complex  and  multifaceted 
‘contract imaginary’, mobilized by registered counsellors and psychotherapists to achieve not 
only  practical  and  commercial  aims  and  therapeutic  tasks,  but  also  important  socio-cultural 
work that defines the very identity of a counsellor.

As  this  work  contributes  new  knowledge  and  understanding  regarding  an  understudied 
health profession, we orient our analysis of the life of contract in the therapeutic practice do-
main  by  first  providing  an  outline  of  counselling  and  psychotherapy  as  both  a  profession, 
clinical  practice,  and  sector.  We  pay  attention  to  the  specifics  of  the  Australian  context, 
which  reflects  the  self-regulatory  state  that  is  common  to  many  common  law  jurisdictions. 
Following  this,  we  provide  an  overview  of  central  aspects  of  the  legal  doctrine  of  contract, 
designed  primarily  to  introduce  readers  to  the  central  aspects  of  the contract  as  understood

During 2020–2022, approximately 17.4 per cent of Australians aged 16–85 years (3.4 million 
people)  saw  a  health  professional  for  their  mental  health  in  the  12  months  prior.7 While 
data are, unfortunately, not available to identify which of these healthcare practitioners were 
counsellors  and  psychotherapists,  they  make  up  a  significant  proportion  of  mental  health 
professionals in Australia, and counselling and psychotherapy have been demonstrated to be 
effective treatment options for a range of presenting mental health issues, with high levels of 
satisfaction.8

Counselling  and  psychotherapy  are  ‘fragmented  and  complex’  professions  that  embrace  a 
‘multiplicity  of  forms  and  practice’.9 Terminology  relating  to  this  area  of  professional  prac-
tice  is  just  as  multiple  and  varied,  including  in  the  Australian  context.  Law,  as  well  as  other 
systems  of  classification,  has  often  provided  a  mechanism  for  formalizing  the  difference  be-
tween health professions in Australia by either modifying or formalizing existing professional 
boundaries.  In  Australia,  there  is  no  statutory  registration  scheme  for  counsellors  and  psy-
chotherapists. This differs from other health professions, like psychologists, who have both a 
‘protected  title’10 and  participate  in  the  National  Registration  and  Accreditation  Scheme.11
This  means  that  Australian  counsellors  and  psychotherapists  do  not  have  a  protected  title. 
Legally  speaking,  operate  as  non-registered  health  practitioners,  governed  by  more  limited 
statutory provisions that apply to multiple professions and practitioners.12

In  this  context,  professional  bodies,  including  those  with  voluntary  registration  schemes, 
play  a  central  and  growing  role  in  the  governance  of  education  and  professional  practice. 
There  are  multiple  counselling  and  psychotherapeutic  professional  bodies  in  Australia. 
However,  the  two  principal  professional  bodies  that  also  offer  professional  registration  are 
the  Psychotherapy  and  Counselling  Federation  of  Australia  (PACFA)  and  the  ACA.  These 
bodies  provide  formal  definitions  of  counselling  and  psychotherapy  that  recognize  a

distinction  and  overlap  between  counsellors/counselling  and  psychotherapists/psychother-
apy.  Both  bodies  use  both  terms  in  key  registration  standards,  while  frequently  collapsing 
psychotherapy into the broader term of counselling.13

PACFA and the ACA define counselling and psychotherapy services to include clinical ac-
tivities, research, supervision, and teaching. ACA’s capability approach defines counselling as 
(at  least)  ‘working  with  clients  on  personal  and  psychological  issues  using  established 
counselling [and psychotherapeutic] modalities’14 through to ‘clinical counselling services to 
consumers with complex clinical mental health needs, which improve the outcomes for con-
sumers  through  evidence-based  treatment’.15 PACFA  includes  psychotherapy  in  its  defini-
tion  of  ‘professional  counselling’,  which  it  defines  as  ‘a  safe  and  confidential  collaboration 
between  qualified  counsellors  and  clients  to  promote  mental  health  and  [well-being],  en-
hance self-understanding, and  resolve identified concerns’.16 According  to  PACFA, counsel-
ling and psychotherapy use a ‘non-medical, biopsychosocial model’ that is distinguished by a 
‘focus  on  client  [well-being]’  applied  to  ‘support  clients  therapeutically  with  their  mental 
health and [well-being]’.17

Another source of definition is the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of 
Occupations (ANZSCO), which defines and distinguishes counselling and psychotherapy in 
its  classificatory  system.18 According  to  ANZSCO,  psychotherapists  provide  ‘diagnosis  and 
treatment  of  mental  and  emotional  disorders  using  psychotherapeutic  methods  such  as  be-
havioral  therapy,  biofeedback,  relaxation  therapy  and  other  techniques’,19 and  counsel-
lors provide: 

information  on  vocational,  relationship,  social  and  educational  difficulties  and  issues,  and 
work with people to help them to identify and define their emotional issues through thera-
pies  such  as  cognitive  behaviour  therapy,  interpersonal  therapy  and  other  talking 
therapies.20

Despite the definitional work by the ACA, PACFA, and ANZSCO,  the boundaries between 
the  professions  and  forms  of  professional  practice  are  fluid.  As  McLeod  notes  in  a  major 
Australian  policy-oriented  review,  ‘it  would  not  be  hard  to  find  examples  of  psychotherapy 
practice  that  correspond  to  characteristics  attributed  to  …  counselling.’21 This  is  a  view 
reflected  in the  current debate  as Australia  moves  to  a set of  national  standards for  the pro-
fession.22 Nathan Beel, for example, has argued for a model of ‘one profession, one identity’, 
arguing  that  psychotherapist  ‘no  longer  form[s  a]  primary  alternative  identity’  to  that  of 

In the ACA Scope of Practice the title ‘counsellor’ is interchangeable with the title ‘psychotherapist’.

‘counsellor’,23 but rather a ‘specialist identity’ akin to a clinical psychologist, who is a special-
ist psychologist. In contrast, however, Jodie Gale points to both points of ‘crossover’, but the 
markedly  different  traditions  of  thought,  technique,  education,  and  task  that  are  elided  by 
this  view.  Her  conclusion  is  responsive  to  both  client  and  professional  standards,  with  the 
maintenance of difference important for ensuring ‘the integrity of psychotherapy as a distinct 
profession’  that  ‘guarantees  that  those  wanting  or  needing  psychotherapy  have  access  to 
it … not only in name but also in practice’.24

Regardless  of  where  these  definitional  debates  eventually  land,  the  counselling  and  psy-
chotherapy  workforce  is  significant.  Recent  data  (2024)  show  that  approximately  34,600 
people  report  working  as  a  ‘counsellor’  and  4000  as  a  ‘psychotherapist’25;  although  many 
who  practise  counselling  or  psychotherapy  may  identify  with  other  professions,  including 
psychology, social work, and psychiatry.26 By way of contrast, fewer people were reported to 
be working as psychologists in Australia: approximately 31,000 in 2021.

The  counselling  and  psychotherapeutic  profession  is  presently  undergoing  a  progressive 
formalization  of  its  structures.  The  major  changes  include  the  formalization  of  industry  and 
professional self-regulation. The establishment of the Australian Register of Counsellors and 
Psychotherapists  (ARCAP)  is  perhaps  the  most  significant  visible  change  in  this  regard.27
ARCAP  is  a  quasi-independent  national  registration  body  that  maintains  a  register  of  coun-
sellors  and  psychotherapists.  Jointly  established  by  the  ACA  and  PACFA  in  2011,  it  main-
tains  two  divisions,  one  for  PACFA-registered  members  and  another  for  ACA-registered 
members.  The  body,  however,  plays  little  in  the  way  of  a  role  beyond  maintenance  of  the 
register;  registration  and  disciplinary  procedures  are  administered  by  the  respective  profes-
sional bodies.

In the  context of increasing formalization of self-governance, there is a clear  role for  con-
tract and contractual concepts in the regulation and conduct of counselling and psychother-
apy as a profession and professional service. Contract finds its way directly into professional 
regulation. At the beginning of this article, we noted that the Code of Ethics and Practice of 
the ACA states  that ‘counselling  is a  formal  and  contracted relationship  and  nothing  else’.28
PACFA  too  holds  contract  central  to  its  regulation  of  the  conduct  of  the  profession;  mem-
bers  of  PACFA  ‘work  within  clearly  contracted  …  relationships’.29 This  discussion  of  the 
contract between client and practitioner appears alongside other uses of the term by the key 
professional bodies, including reference to the necessity of contract as part of the appropriate 
conduct of the business of a practice.

While this appearance of contract seems motivated by the orderly governance of the pro-
fessions  and  of  professional  conduct,  contract  is  called  upon  here  to  play  a  broader  role  in 
defining  the  very  relationship  between  practitioner  and  client,  especially  so  in  relation  to

ACA-registered practitioners for whom contract explicitly ‘covers the field’ regarding the def-
inition  of  the  relationship  between  practitioner  and  client  to  the  exclusion  of  all  other  ways 
of conceiving it.

This  use  of  contract  is  not  unique  to  the  Australian  context.  Indeed,  contract  has  a  foun-
dation  in  clinical  practice  itself,  perhaps  most  clearly  in  the  concept  of  the  therapeutic  alli-
ance. The concept of the therapeutic, working, or treatment alliance is a core concept within 
counselling  and  psychotherapeutic  practice. The  alliance has  emerged  as an  ‘important  vari-
able  in  explaining  the  outcome  of  treatment’  in  which  research,  clinician,  and  patient  views 
each  speak  to  the  alliance  as  a  ‘key  determinant  of  treatment  success’.30 Elvins  and  Green 
trace  this  concept’s  genealogy  to  Freud’s  description  of  transference  and  countertransfer-
ence.31 In  its  common  usage  today,  however,  it  consists  of  several  interpersonal  processes 
that are frequently described as independent of the specific treatment or therapeutic modal-
ity applied by the practitioner. The therapeutic alliance is described by some as ‘common ac-
tive factors’32 that, for many modalities, are separate from specific techniques. Hougaard, for 
example,  conceptualizes  the  alliance  in  bipartite  form,  consisting  of  ‘personal  alliance’  and 
‘task-related alliance’.33 Elvins and Green gloss this second task-related aspect of the alliance 
as ‘addressing the more contractual aspects of treatment planning and goal orientation’.34

Contract,  it  seems,  appears  in  multiple  and  varied  ways  in  the  counselling  profession,  its 
governance, and even in conceiving and applying therapeutic relationships and practice. It is 
used to define and support various practical aspects of the business or service-related aspects 
of  counselling  and  is  a  mechanism  for  meeting  legal  and  ethical  obligations.  The  term  is 
used  to  define  and  describe  both  the  relationship  between  practitioner  and  client  and  the 
therapeutic alliance as part of clinical practice.

This  central  place  of  contract  is  striking  given  that  aspects  of  counselling  seem  to  in-
volve—by necessity—intimate, emotional, flexible, and changing interpersonal and relational 
aspects,  the  ‘ice-cold’,35 inflexible  imaginary  of  contract  and  contract  law  seems  an  un-
usual fit.

One  potential  reason  for  this  central  place  of  contract  is  that  contract  is  used  in  this  do-
main  in  a  more  flexible,  and  perhaps  not  strictly  legal,  manner.  In  law,  a  contract  has  a  spe-
cific  meaning.  Contracts  are  established  by  a  set  of  relatively  stable  principles  that  together 
transform  an  agreement  into  a  contract.  Naming  something  a  contract  does  not  necessarily 
make it so, but like other areas of human relationships and agreements, it is possible that the 
counselling  contract  is  not  intended  to  carry  with  it  the  same  meaning  granted  to  it  by  law. 
Moreover, contract law reflects broader theoretical or jurisprudential commitments, many of 
which  include  concepts  of  the  person  and  of  the  relationship  between  contracting  parties. 
These  may  be  antithetical  to  the  nature  of  the  relationship  between  counsellor  and  client, 
the  broader  commitments  of  the  profession,  the  work  that  is  undertaken  in  the  counselling 
relationship, and the demands of the therapeutic alliance.

Yet, contract is explicitly and repeatedly referenced in the professional codes of the largest 
professional  and  registration  bodies.  It  is  used  as  a  fundamental,  even  singular,  definition  of

signals  a  need  to  understand  more  fully  the  use  of  this  terminology,  and  its  relationship  to 
both contract law and its jurisprudential commitments.

To  support  this  inquiry,  in  the  next  section,  we  present  a  brief  overview  of  some  of  the 
key  doctrinal  and  theoretical  aspects  of  contract  law.  This  material  aims  to  provide  relevant 
background  to  the  legal  meaning  of  contract—particularly  for  readers  from  the  counselling 
and psychotherapeutic professions who may be less familiar with these aspects of law—while 
identifying some of the potential tensions between a legal view of contract and its use in the 
therapeutic domain.

I I I .  C O N T R A C T  L A W  A N D  C O U N S E L L I N G
An  agreement  is transformed  into  a  contract  when it  meets doctrinal  rules  regarding  forma-
tion  and  is  consensual.  Anglo-Australian  contract  law  has  developed  alongside  both  liberal-
ism  and  capitalism,36 and  as  such,  is  embedded  in  ideas  of  freedom  to  contract  and 
Equitable  principles  of  consent.37 Contract  law’s  frame  of  reference  is  two  or  more  self- 
interested  individuals  (imbued  with  agency)  who  enter  into  an  agreement  to  realize  their 
mutual  interest.  Within  this  legal  framework,  a  contract  is  an  agreement  that  conforms  to 
the rules of offer, acceptance, consideration, certainty, and completeness.

An  offer  needs  to  contain  clear  terms.  In  turn,  an  acceptance  of  those  terms  needs  to  be 
unequivocal and clearly communicated to the other party. While terms relating to the practi-
calities of counselling as a service—fees, cancellation policies, data collection and use, among 
other things—may be capable of clear expression, in reality, they may be difficult to evidence 
as  clear-cut  interactions  between  contracting  parties.38 Therefore,  there  are  potential  ten-
sions  and  perhaps  conflicts  between  the  requirements  of  contract  law  and  the  realities  and 
broader commitments of the profession and clinical practice. In particular, contract law’s sin-
gle  ‘moment’  of  contract,  as  that  which  captures  and  crystallizes  the  intention  of  parties, 
seems at odds, in some ways, with the more fluid, evolving nature of the therapeutic relation-
ship and its activities. This is not unique to contracts in the counselling context. In other set-
tings,  parties  relate  to  one  another  on  a  more  fluid  continuum,  thus  determining  the  actual 
consensus  ad  idem  can  be  a  more  nuanced  exercise,  which  the  law  must  at  times  resolve.39
However,  if  the  relationship  itself  between  counsellor  and  client  is  contractual  and  ‘nothing 
else’, how might this use of contract generate significant difficulties for the law’s requirement 
for identifying the moment of agreement and the clear terms upon which it is based?

Consideration,  while  appearing  technical,  is  rarely  difficult  to  find.  Most  parties  engaged 
in  contracting  behaviour  are  exchanging  something.  The  counselling  service  or  relationship 
seems to fit this model in some ways. The practitioner provides a service, and the client pro-
vides  payment.  This  appears  to  be  a  clear  exchange  of  consideration.  However,  in  non- 
counselling settings, the question of consideration can cause problems if the motivations for 
the  parties’  contractual  behaviour  are  more  complex,  and  not  ‘economically’  understood.40
Although  the  law  is  not  generally  concerned  with  the  content  of  the  promises  themselves, 
reflecting  the  well-known  principle  that  even  a  peppercorn  can  be  exchanged  for  a  legally

binding promise,41 how might unquantifiable exchanges that are essential to the provision of 
effective  counselling  fit  into  contract  law’s  model  of  consideration?  For  example,  can  some-
one’s happiness constitute good consideration in an exchange for a service?

The principles of certainty and completeness are further  challenged by the context of the 
delivery  of  a  counselling  contract  that  consists  of  many  exchanges  made  continuously  over 
time,  while  a  relationship  builds.  At  what  point  can  we  say  that  the  contract  is  complete 
and certain?

The issue of consent is further challenged. In contrast, consent is understood in line with 
conceptions  of a  liberal  freedom  to  contract.42 A  contract  will be  vitiated if  it  has  been  pro-
cured by  duress (physical  or economic), undue influence (actual or implied), or unconscio-
nability:  taking  advantage  of  a  special  disadvantage.  In  other  words,  a  contract  will  be 
vitiated  when  a  factor  impacts  upon  a  party’s  ability  to  enter  into  it  freely  and  equally.43
Here  again,  the  place  of  contract  in  the  counselling  relationship  raises  questions.  Many,  if 
not  most,  clients  come  to  the  counselling  relationship  experiencing  distress  of  some  sort. 
People seek counselling when experiencing mental health issues. In this context, the counsel-
lor  stands  in  an  unequal  position  in  relation  to  the  client,  particularly  so  when  emotional 
and mental distress is at its highest. This raises questions about the capacity to consent freely 
to a contract and its terms.

The content of a contract is relevant in legal terms only insofar as the terms are clear and 
complete. This requirement is to ensure that a party is able to perform the contract. The on-
going or repeated interactions between the counsellor and client may well be a source of in-
stability  or  change  in  these  terms.  In  addition,  the  content  of  a  contract  requires  an 
appreciation  that  the  totality  of  the  parties’  agreement  extends  beyond  the  express  terms;  it 
may  include  statements  made  during  negotiations,  contained  elsewhere,  implied  by  law,  or 
by  well-known  customs  of  the  market  (or  domain  in  this  context)  in  which  the  parties  are 
engaged.  There  may  also  be  more  than  one  contract  to  consider.  Terms  of  a  contract  may 
be  contained  outside  it,  for  example,  in  legislation  and  codes  of  conduct.  Given  these  reali-
ties,  the  contract  is  layered.  and  there  may  be  multiple  overlapping  contracts.  In  contrast  to 
many other services, including those in the health setting, outcomes in counselling are often 
ill-defined  and  changeable.  Therapy  goals  are  complex,  multifaceted,  and  the  presenting  is-
sue  itself  is  often  opaque.  Clients  themselves  may  not  be  able  to  fully  understand  or  articu-
late  their  needs  at  the  moment  of  contract  formation,  while  their  goals  may  be  difficult  to 
render in clear and complete terms.

When in doubt about the terms of a contract, the court reverts to asking what the parties 
intended.  This  is  essential  to  contract  law,  which  is  understood  as  a  quintessentially  volun-
tary  area  of  obligation  law.44 Thus,  determining  the  meaning  of  a  contract  begins  with  the 
question, ‘What did the parties intend for it to mean?’ For a long time, courts have employed 
presumptions  regarding  intention  that  neatly  categorize  contractual  activity  and  prioritize 
promises  made  in  the  commercial  sphere.  But  the  more  modern  approach  is  to  simply  look 
at the subject matter of the agreement, the status of the parties, and the surrounding circum-
stances.45 The  counselling  relationship,  while  professional  in  nature,  involves  real  and  often 
deeply personal aspects that may sit in tension with an assumption of an intention to create

a legally binding obligation  (at least beyond the basic aspects of a contract regarding practi-
cal matters like fees, cancellation policies, and privacy.)

Intention is moderated by the other all-encompassing concept: objectivity. Its importance 
in  the  law  of  contract  cannot  be  overstated.  It  has  been  described  as  ‘deeply  entrenched’,46
having a ‘pervasive influence’,47 and as being in ‘command of the field’.48 It functions so that 
meaning  is  to  be  interpreted  according  to  what  a  reasonable  person  in  the  position  of  the 
parties would understand, rather than subjectively, according to what the parties themselves 
understood.  The  objective  standard  is  associated  with  ‘security  and  sanctity  of  contract’,49
stability, predictability, and reliability in the market.50 This makes for an interesting dynamic 
in contract  law between intention, freedom,  and  subjectivity  on  the one  hand,  and  objectiv-
ity, normativity, and collectivity on the other.

The ideas of intention and objectivity speak to contract law’s place in the divide between 
reason and emotion. The question of intention, according to the ideas of objectivity and the 
measure of the reasonable person, is complicated in the context of highly emotional interac-
tions.  The  counselling  contract  leads  to  questions  regarding  how  best  to  theorize  the  rela-
tionship  between  reason  and  emotion,  law  and  emotion,  and  contract  and  emotion.51 The 
relational,  evolving,  and  deeply  personal  relationship  between  client  and  practitioner  seems, 
in some ways, to stand in a tense, if not conflictual, relationship with the rigid, transactional, 
and objective principles of contract law. Yet, as outlined above, contract is afforded a central 
place  in  the  discourse  of  counselling.  To  explore  the  practical,  ‘lived  experience’  of  contract 
in the  counselling setting, in the next section, we outline the methods of our study and pre-
sent the results of our interviews with registered counsellors.

This socio-legal study used semi-structured interviews to understand the presence, meaning, 
and  use  of  contract  in  the  counselling  domain.  We  took  a  phenomenological  approach  to 
the  study  design,  data  collection,  and  analysis.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  Human 
Research Ethics Committee of the University of Technology, Sydney.

We  conducted  interviews  using  a  guide  developed  following  a  review  of  contract  theory 
literature  and  literature  on  contract  in  the  counselling  domain,  and  following  consultation 
with the ACA, which partnered with the authors to facilitate this study. The interview guide 
focused on several questions, including:

1.  How are contracts used in counselling practice? 
2.  What is the content of contracts? 
3.  What is the practical function they fulfil? 
4.  How do counsellors understand the contract?

In  addition,  participants  were  invited  and  prompted  to  reflect  on  the  significance  of  the 
contract  for  the  profession  and  for  clients,  while  also  considering  any  emotional,  social,  or 
cultural meaning ascribed to contracts.

The study was advertised by the ACA through member newsletters. In total, 13 members 
of the ACA consented to participate in research. Interviews were conducted in late 2023 via 
videoconference.  Two  interviews  were  conducted  by  both  authors,  and  the  remaining  11 
interviews  by  Renata  Grossi.  Demographic  and  other  data  were  collected  from  statements 
volunteered  during  the  interview.  Participants  identified  as  gender-queer  (1),  male  (4),  and 
female  (8).  Two  participants  identified  as  being  from  a  culturally  and  linguistically  diverse 
background.  Four  participants  worked

Participants  were  trained  in  and  used  a  wide  variety  of  modalities.  Our  sample  included 
practitioners  who  used  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT),  mindfulness,  art  therapy,  eye 
movement  desensitization  and  reprocessing  (EMDR),  sexology,  functional  breathing  ther-
apy, psychotherapy, havening therapy, logotherapy, solution and goal therapy, narrative ther-
apy, and polyvagal therapy.

Our  sample  came  from  diverse  practice  focuses  and  contexts,  including  couples  therapy; 
children and teenagers; adults; special needs, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD)  and  autism;  employee  assistance  programmes;  trauma  response;  anxiety  and  de-
pression; obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD); and kink sexuality.

Counsellors  worked  in  a  variety  of  organizational  settings,  such  as  schools,  university 
chaplaincy  programs,  workplace,  employee  assistance  programmes,  the  National  Disability 
Insurance  Scheme  (NDIS),  and  private  practice.  Four  interviewees  also  worked  as  clinical 
supervisors, and one worked in student counsellor training.

Most interviews ran for approximately 1 h. They were recorded and transcribed by a pro-
fessional transcription provider who pseudonymized transcripts at the point of transcription.
Analysis  proceeded  using  a  descriptive  phenomenological  method.  Descriptive  phenome-
nology  is  an  interpretivist  approach,  suitable  for  eliciting  subjective  responses  in  the  sphere 
of  practice-oriented  research.52 It  employs  an  iterative  approach  to  analysis,  asking  the  re-
searcher  to  bracket and  thus  remain  open  to  the phenomenon under  discussion. We  under-
took  this  process  in  three  phases:  achieving  familiarity  with  the  data  through  open  reading, 
searching for meanings and themes of the lived experience described by participants, and fi-
nally,  organizing  themes  into  a  meaningful  whole.53 This  process  was  undertaken  jointly  by 
both authors, through separate reading  of the data, followed by meetings and discussions of 
the evolving analysis.

work’  [ … .]  and  others  as  unfairly  marginalized,54 into  one  that  is  important,  serious,  and 
professional.

In  the  process  of  this  enquiry,  our  findings  revealed  some  further  themes  regarding  the 
use of contracts in this setting. One relates to the contract’s place in fulfilling or challenging 
a  participant’s  desire  to  maintain  an  ethic  of  care  in  a  commodified  world  of  mental  health 
care.55 Another  relates  to  the  role  of  contract  in  the  delivery  of  a  professional  service  in  a 
sector  that  is  self-regulated.56 Finally,  the  contract  is  seen  as  a  necessary  device  for  contain-
ing  emotions  that  are  expressed,  and  need  to  be  expressed,  for  the  effective  delivery  of 
counselling work.

A.  The provision of a  service
Participants  repeatedly  spoke  of  contracts  as  an  important  background  and  foundation  to 
their counselling work. Descriptions included, a ‘preamble and context’ [Terry], the ‘starting 
piece’  [Sophia], 
‘game  plan’[George],  the 
‘springboard’ for the relationship’ [Kylie], and finally as the ‘working part: the nuts and bolts, 
the engine of things’ [Terry].

‘ground  rules  and  structure’  [Emma],  the 

At  the  most  basic  level,  contracts  are  seen  as  a  vehicle  for  establishing  and  regulating  the 
discrete transactions typical of the provision of a service. The contract governs appointment 
times,  fees,  and  cancellations.  For  the  participants,  they  govern  the  delivery  of a  service  and 
speak the language of business. This was seen as unremarkable by participants, and yet inter-
views  also  revealed  some  discomfort  with  the  businesslike  nature  of  the  contract.  Contracts 
were often described in physical terms, as ‘awkward’ [River], ‘cold’ [Sophia], ‘heavy’ [Pearl], 
and in ethical terms too, such as ‘unkind’ [Emma].

Extending  the  physical  inflection  of  their  descriptions,  participants  spoke  of  engaging 
practices  of  separation,  actively  keeping  the  process  of  entering  the  contract  separate  from, 
and outside of, the therapy domain. For example, Pearl said: 

You are paying for a service at the end of the day, but we don’t want it to always be about 
money; it has to be about the therapeutic alliance. So that can be tricky sometimes.

Emma echoed these concerns and touched on the use of separation as a strategy: 

Alright  where’s  your  money?’  …  It  feels  like,  ‘Oh  God’,  so  it’s  really  nice  if  that’s  just  all 
out of the way beforehand, and then the time in [the] counselling room is, yes, it’s a differ-
ent  kind  of  energy  [to]  business  … 
‘Give  me  your  money;  after  your  six  sessions 
you’re gone.

While participants reported a demarcation and effort to keep separate the business and ther-
apeutic domains, contracts were also described as tools that could be used to support thera-
peutic  goals  and  practice  itself.  These  tools  included  regulation  of  the  meta-conduct  of 
therapy,  particularly  the  conduct  of  counselling  sessions,  and  the  management  of  clients’ 
expectations  regarding  communication  (including  emails  and  telephone  calls).  Contracts 
were  also  reported  to  be  used  to  manage  conduct  outside  the  counselling  domain,  such  as

Science!’ (2000) 5 International Journal of Psychotherapy 113.

55 This  was  not  expressed  in  large  detail, but  it did  emerge  when  discussions  of  the  business  relationship  were  seen  as sit-
ting  uncomfortably  with  an  ethic  of  care.  See  also  ED  Pellegrino,  ‘The  Commodification  of  Medical  and  Health  Care:  The 
Moral  Consequences  of  a  Paradigm  Shift  from  a  Professional  to  a  Market  Ethic’  (1999)  24  The  Journal  of  Medicine  and 
Philosophy 243.

encounters  in  the  community,  and  to  set  rules  regarding  gifts  between  client  and 
practitioner.

While these aspects of the contract were referenced by participants, the contract was even 
more  frequently described  as  part  of therapy  itself, for  example,  a contract  that required  the 
client to take their medication (or not to take medication) as directed by their medical prac-
titioner.  These  contracts  were  often  verbal;  however,  more  formal  practices  were  also  used 
by  participants.  These  included  a  signed  contract  that  required  a  client  to  leave  the  house 
and  take  a  walk  as  soon  as  they  felt  themselves  becoming  angry.  These  contracts  were  de-
scribed  in  various  ways,  including  ‘verbal  and  informal’  [River],  ‘looser’  [Emma],  ‘micro’ 
[George],  but  were  unequivocally  considered  contracts  by  participants.  One  participant  de-
scribed these contracts for ‘homework’ (out-of-therapy session tasks) as ‘little’ contracts that 
outline  ‘what  is  going  to  happen,  when  it’s  going  to  happen  and  how  it’s  going  to  happen, 
and how they will be followed up on’. [River]

Frequent  reference  was  made  to  contract  playing  a  specifically  therapeutic  role,  particu-
larly in the context of ‘safety’, ‘no-harm’, or ‘no-suicide’ contracts. These contracts were both 
verbal  and  written.  Their  purpose  was  described  as  increasing  the  safety  of  a  person 
experiencing  suicidal  ideation.57 These  safety  contracts  include  explicit,  detailed,  and  step-
wise processes for recognizing and responding to distress and crisis, and agreement to under-
take  those  steps.58 The  use  of  contract  to  prevent  suicide  was  considered  an  effective 
therapeutic tool because, as one participant put it: 

Getting  them  to  commit  to  a  strategy  just  by  verbal  agreement  is  not  going  to  work.  … 
Contracting  sets  out  a  much  more  clear  process  that  they  will  hopefully  utilize  when  they 
leave the session, and will continue to follow until the next session.  …  Contracting works 
very  well  because  they  make  a  promise  to  you.  …  It  helps  to  bring  clarity  to  it,  …  puts 
some legs on it. [George]

Some  participants  expressed  concern  or  reservation  about  contracting  with  vulnerable  peo-
ple,  either  seeing  it as  ineffective  [River] or characterizing  it as  unethical  [Sarah].  However, 
others thought that the contract worked well in this context precisely because of the fragility 
and vulnerability of the person concerned: 

They’re fragile.  There’s stuff going on. So right from the word go, I feel like having a con-
tract just is something to hang on to. They know what to expect. [Sophia]

Indeed,  contracts  were  considered  effective  by  many  participants  because  they  speak  to  a 
particular  and  dominant  cultural  imagination  of  contract,  where  contract  represents  an 
agreement, freely entered into and therefore, consent-driven and respectful of agency: 

We are contractual creatures by nature. [River]

[Contract]  works  very  well.  …  In  Australian  culture,  it’s  a  fairly  common  process  in 
life. [George]

B. Ethics and safety
While expressing discomfort regarding business language and the formal or transactional na-
ture  of the  contract in the counselling relationship, most  participants described the contract 
as  a  necessary  and  important  part  of  their  work.  Having  contracts  in  place  was  important, 
not just for governing the provision of a service, but also as a means of meeting ethical stand-
ards.  The  clearest  connection  is  to  professional  ethical  standards  and  rules  related  to  confi-
dentiality  and  privacy,  particularly  the  rules  and  standards  regarding  disclosure.  Contracts 
that  governed  privacy  and  disclosure  were  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‘consent  forms’  and 
were often linked to creating a sense of ‘safety’ around compliance with legal obligations and 
codes of ethics, and professional conduct. For example, some participants reported that con-
tracts generated peace of mind, which allowed them to ‘sleep at night’. [Declan] One partici-
pant put this in stark terms: 

So,  if  there’s  a  complaint  against  me,  I  can  say,  ‘Well,  this  is  a  contract,  this  is  what  we 
agreed’.  …  [It  provides]  safety;  I  guess  if  there  is  a  complaint  against  me,  I  want  to  be 
sure  that  I  have  covered  the  bases  …  I  don’t  want  to  go  to  jail.  So  yeah,  it’s  per-
sonal. [Sophia]

This peace of mind and sense of safety for the counsellor was understood to cascade or flow 
to  the  client  (‘[It]  keeps  me  safe  and  keeps  the  client  safe.  …  It’s  a  set  of  expectations  on 
how we are going to be working together [Pearl]) and to the industry as a whole.

These  are  the  functions  that  a  contract  fills  in  therapy.  But  its  function  and  impact  are 
broader  and  potentially  more  fundamental  when  we  consider  its  meaning-making  capacity. 
Participants were asked to reflect on what the contract meant to the counselling relationship 
and  to  them  personally.  It  was  during  these  conversations  that  the  contract  emerged  as  a 
powerful tool for transformation.

C. The transformative nature of  the contract
1. Formality
Most  clear  in  the  participant’s  reflections  on  contract  was  that  the  contract  was  seen  as  a 
means  by  which  a  relationship  of  care  can  be  transformed  from  what  they  described  as  an 
emotional relationship to a formal and business relationship: 

[It’s a] formal written document  …  this is something I take seriously.  …  I work under a 
professional sense of industry, even though [the profession] is unregulated  …  it provides 
that  formality  of  difference  that  you  wouldn’t  see  if  you  were  just  reading  it  like  …  ‘so 
we’re  going  to  get  together.  We’re  going  to  talk.  And  then  you’re  going  to  pay  me.  It’s  all 
going to be fine’. It’s not what happens in a contract right? It’s laid out; it has structure; it’s 
laid out mindfully with different parts to it. [Terry]

From this formal relationship, many other important things were then seen to flow. The lan-
guage  of  contract  helped  counsellors  become  confident  professionals  and  demand  respect, 
and, as discussed earlier, it created safety and trust between them and their clients.

2. Boundaries
One of the most frequently used words in the interviews was ‘boundaries’. As one counsellor 
explained,  boundaries  are  essential  to  the  counselling  relationship  and  contracts  are  a  good 
way  to  express  them  and  to  monitor  and  facilitate  their  use:  ‘It  creates  clarity  for  [the]  pro-
fessional  to  understand  when  they’re  crossing  boundaries’.  [Nora]  Contracts  were  not  just 

14

facilitative for boundary setting and monitoring. Indeed, as River explained, they almost sub-
stitute boundaries set in other ways: 

Contracts are very similar to boundaries.  …  [They serve] in place of boundaries  …  [and 
educate]  the  boundaries  of  how  we  interact.  …  The  therapeutic  relationship  is  very  in-
formed  by  boundaries.  If  it  wasn’t,  then  we  can’t  have  a  safe  relationship  with  the  client, 
because they wouldn’t know what to expect from us. [River]

3. Emotions
Participants  interviewed  in  this  study  described  their  work  as  deeply  caring  and  intimate. 
This  was  framed  in  a  variety  of  ways,  but  included  a  comparison  to  standing  in  for  a  best 
friend  or  a  caring  parent  their  client  never  had.  Thus,  the  relationships  between  counsellors 
and clients were characterized by participants as providing warmth, trust, safety, empathy, re-
spect, care, and even love. For example, counsellors said: 

‘I’m just standing beside you, and I can see that this is really hard.’ So, we are full of emo-
tions. [Nora]

It’s emotional, it’s spiritual, it’s two people coming together. [Sophia]

While  emotion  is  central  to  the  enterprise  of  counselling,  sharing  and  relating  through,  and 
with,  emotion  also  presented  a  problem  for  participants,  for  example,  Nora  said,  ‘ …  we 
[both  counsellor  and  client]  are  full  of  emotions’  (see,  her  statement  above),  but  also  ‘we 
need  to  contain  [our  emotions]  in  that  space’.  Terry  talked  about  the  risks  of  emotion 
and said: 

Clients,  when  you’ve  been  working  with  them  in  therapy,  they  feel  …  feelings  for  you. 
They  feel  close  to  you.  They  feel  things  they  usually  feel  towards  friend  or  a  fam-
ily member.

As with other professions at the forefront of the performance of emotional labour, the man-
agement of emotions in the relationship is as crucial as it is difficult.59 The contract’s role in 
this task was revelatory. As Terry put it: ‘The contract really speaks to that. It speaks to this 
being a formal relationship, a professional relationship.’ This sentiment was echoed by River, 
who positioned the contract in a similar way: 

Sometimes clients want more than I’m able to provide.  …  It [contract] helps every day. It 
maintains the boundaries and understanding of what we are there to achieve.

The contract, then, is the device through which the emotional nature of the relationship can be 
deconstructed  and  used  to  provide  some  much-needed  containment.  Above,  we  reported  that 
participants used the contract to manage their clients’ expectations around conduct outside the 
counselling domain, for example, the exchange of gifts. But the contract was also used to mini-
mize  the  emotional  content  of  the  language  around  the  service.  For  example,  counsellors  said 
the  contract  made  it  clear  that  it’s  not  ‘just  a  little  chat’  [Terry],  ‘wishy-washy’  [Emma],  or

Press 2012).

‘loosey-goosey’ [Terry]. And as one counsellor put it, they need to convey to clients that ‘I am 
not your friend’. [Nora]

This discussion has shown that when reflecting upon the meaning-making capacity of the 
contract, participants reported that it formalizes the relationship, establishes boundaries, and 
manages—and  might  even  contain—emotion.  For  many  counsellors,  all  this  culminated  in 
meeting the ultimate goal of producing a much-needed professional identity.

4. Professional identity
Contracts were seen to signal counselling as a professional service, one to be taken seriously 
and demanding of respect: 

Great. You guys mean business. [Nora]

Like [when you see any other] professional,  …  there’ll be some form filling. [Sophia]

It’s important for the professional service to be respected. [Kylie]

Several counsellors compared the contract to wearing a suit or uniform that signalled profes-
sional identity: ‘As a practitioner, when I put on my suit, I become the therapist. My paper-
work supports that role; it reflects that role.’ [Terry] Professionalism was seen as generating 
respect while providing confidence for the participants in the delivery of the service. 

Our  contracts  are  very  much  about  respect.  …  [They  create]  an  awareness  we’re  doing 
something important here. [Nora]

It makes me feel confident, makes me feel professional, makes me help in what I’m saying 
is available and isn’t available. [Emma]

It’s  about  professional  confidence  and  …  an  indicator  of  what  the  breadth  of  my  experi-
ence is, so that humanizes me, but also professionalizes me, I guess, in one go. [Kylie]

V I .  C O N T R A C T  A N D  C O U N S E L L I N G
While  contract  has  a  central  role  in  the  profession’s  formal  statements  regarding  the  ethics 
and  practice  of  counselling,  interviews  with  registered  counsellors  described  above  make 
clear that contract plays a significant and varied role in everyday practice and the conception 
of counselling for practitioners. While the material above indicates that there are varied roles 
and  emphases  placed  on  contract,  we  propose  that  contract  operates  in  at  least  two  related 
but  distinct  ways  in  the  everyday  practice  of  counselling:  an  ‘infrastructural  role’  and  a 
‘therapeutic  role’,  with  both  roles  contributing  to  the  professionalization  goals  of  individual 
practitioners and their collective.

From  the  perspective  of  those  interviewed,  the  contract  provides  an  infrastructural  role 
for  their  work.  Practitioners  recognize  that  contracts  are  a  formal  requirement  of  individual 
professional practice, but also that contracts serve important roles in supporting ethical prac-
tice  and  professional  safety  for  the  collective.  Practitioners  report  that  contracts  facilitate 
their own meeting of these formal requirements for contracted relationships imposed by pro-
fessional  bodies,  but  also  other  regulatory  and  professional  standards  regarding  privacy  and 
confidentiality,  professional  liability,  and  risk  management.  For  individual  practitioners, 

16 

� D. J. Carter et al. 

contracts  govern  their  individual  practitioner/client  business  relationships,  including  practi-
cal  aspects  of  service  provision  like  appointments,  fees,  and  cancellations.  There  is  a  strong 
sense in which this is a function that serves both the profession, advancing its quality of prac-
tice  and  standing,  but  also  facilitates  the  individual  practitioner’s  participation  in  these  col-
lective processes. Together, these roles that contract plays provide ‘peace of mind’ regarding 
professional standards and ethical obligations to and for the profession, but also between the 
practitioner and client.

For  those  interviewed,  these  different  roles  that  contract  plays  produce  and  advance  the 
professionalization  of  counselling,  through  processes  of  professional  identity  formation  and 
presentation  for  practitioners.  Contracts  are  a  clear  signal  of  that  professionalization  to  cli-
ents and others in the community. In this study, a contract was equated with written forms, 
wearing  suits,  creating  formality,  seriousness,  and  respect.  Contract  performs  a  significant 
meaning-making function for those interviewed, which, to some extent, is also an emotional 
project,  for  professional  identity  facilitated  in  part  by  contract,  creates  safety,  confidence, 
and trust.

Contract,  as  we  saw,  not  only  plays  this  ‘infrastructural  role’  but  also  a  ‘therapeutic  role’ 
too.  Practitioners  use  contracts  for  specific  therapeutic  goals  and  tasks,  implementing  safety 
agreements,  structuring  therapeutic  homework,  or  between-session  tasks.  This  suggests  that 
contract  functions  as  more  than  just  a  framework  for  service  delivery—it  becomes  a  thera-
peutic  tool  in  itself.  Significantly,  contracts  are  used  for  boundary-setting  and  the  manage-
ment  of  emotions,  supporting  a  differentiation  between  therapeutic  relationships  and 
personal  ones,  and  managing  client  expectations  regarding  the  limits  of  the  relationship. 
This  boundary-setting  function  appears  especially  important  in  the  context  of  greater  emo-
tional intensity, where contracts seem to provide a tool for practitioners to establish and nav-
igate  relationships,  emotional  and  caring  aspects  of  their  role  whilst  maintaining  a  safe  or 
professional stance, a role that some described as contracts’ ability to generate formal profes-
sional relationships.

Despite  the  affordances  of  contract  in  both  its  infrastructural  and  therapeutic  life,  many 
practitioners report discomfort with the language and function of contract, particularly what 
they conceive of as its business-like function and nature in its infrastructural application. Yet, 
despite the reservations that this conception of contract generates for those interviewed, the 
contract is also applied in the context of therapeutic work itself.

In  this  setting,  there  seems  to  be  a  complex  and  varied  imaginary  at  play.  This  ‘contract 
imaginary’ seems to be bifurcated, with one polarity emphasizing the contract in quite ‘legal’ 
terms, with descriptions of this rational, distant, and often formal contract as cold, awkward, 
heavy, and unkind. This polarity is most often associated with the infrastructural function of 
contract.  On  the  other  hand,  the  therapeutic  contract  is  associated  with  a  different  polarity 
of the contract imaginary—flexible, ‘small’, relational, and emotional.

Contract,  and  the  conception  of  it,  can  of  course  be  multiple—and  indeed  here  it  seems 
to  be  so.  Interestingly,  however,  is  that  attempts  to  manage  the  multiplicity  of  contracts 
seem  to  include  strategies  of  active  demarcation  between  the  infrastructural  functions  of 
contracts from the therapeutic functions of it. Far from simple co-existence or mixing of the 
two (or many) images of contract, demarcation itself is a strong figure for many of the coun-
sellors we interviewed. We sense that much of this demarcation is made not only around the 
different  functions  that  contract  is  called  on  to  perform,  but  that  lines  are  drawn  by  vesting 
the  various  imaginaries  of  contract  with  different  relational  and  emotional  character.  In  this 
demarcation,  two  roles,  with  two  related  but  quite  distinct  imaginaries  of  contract,  are  em-
phasized. Contract is ‘cold’, ‘heavy’, and ‘unkind’ when playing its infrastructural role, but at 

Contract in counselling and psychotherapy

the  same  time  therapeutic,  relational,  personal,  and  emotional  when  it  enters  the  ther-
apy room.

However,  we  wonder  if  this  demarcation  itself  requires,  perhaps,  some  critical  revision. 
The  contract  clearly  supports  both  the  practical,  business-related  functions  of  the  service, 
and  in  different  ways  supports  the  therapeutic  aspects  of  the  relationship.  The  demarcation 
between  business  and  therapy  seems  to  pivot  on  differing  conceptions  and  relationships  to 
emotion.  The  infrastructural  contract  is  imagined  as  rational,  distancing,  and  firm,  and  the 
therapeutic contract as emotional, flexible, and facilitative. While the content and context of 
these two uses of contract are different, they come together to create the meaning that is de-
sired  from  a  contract.  The  different  tones  are  disentangled,  managed,  and  then  fused  to-
gether in a bigger and broader socio-cultural project—the defining of a profession.

These  empirical  findings  have  been  illuminating  in  these  functions  of  contract  in  thera-
peutic settings. They help explain why professional bodies like the ACA may place such em-
phasis on contract and relationships as contractual in nature. It reveals a function of contract 
beyond its multiple practical functions.

While this article is not about contract law per se, this study raises some interesting ques-

tions for contract law scholarship, a few of them are worth briefly alluding to here.

First, contract law, like other areas of law, needs to engage with scholarship and discourse 
regarding law and emotion. Emotions run deep in this study. Contracts are used to set thera-
peutic  goals, both small  and  big, including  even  suicide  prevention. How  we  define the pre-
cise  terms  of  the  exchange  and  whether  true  consent  is  taking  place  in  such  emotional 
interactions  are  all  difficult  questions  for  ‘rational’  contract  law  doctrine.  Emotions  are  cru-
cial  to  the  determination  of  the  content  of  the  contract,  too.  What  is  being  exchanged  and 
how this  very emotional  exchange rubs  against traditional  doctrines of consideration,  terms, 
and even breach are worthy of further discussion.

Contract in these interviews bears a meaning beyond the black and white rules of contract 
law.  What  is  clear  from  our  analysis  is  that  counsellors  employ  both  a  strict  analysis—‘I 
don’t  want  to  go  to  jail’—and  a  social  and  cultural  one  that  comes  from  the  authority  that 
the concept embodies: ‘it means you guys mean business’. A scholar of doctrine may, there-
fore,  easily  dismiss  much  of  the  counsellors’  discussion  of  contract  as  not  being  about  con-
tract  at  all.  It  is  not  clear  if  the  small  ongoing  and  therapeutic  contracts  described  in  this 
study would ever be considered as legally binding contracts. It is almost certain we will never 
see a safety contract litigated. But that is not the point. The analysis of the contract that has 
occurred here is a direct challenge to liberal positivist legal discourse itself. Here, we see con-
tract  law  as  a  part  of  our  social  discourse,  as  emotional  as  well  as  rational,  relational  as  well 
as  discreet,  and  as  something  more  than  an  economic  transaction  motivated  by  self- 
interested economic gain. In all these ways, this study provides a useful challenge to contract 
law’s practice and theory.

V I I .  C O N C L U S I O N S
This  study  began  with  curiosity  regarding  the  central  place  awarded  to  contract  by  the  pro-
fessional  code  of  one  of  Australia’s  leading  professional  counselling  bodies,  the  ACA.  Its 
Code  of  Ethics  and  Practice  states  that  ‘counselling  is  a  formal  and  contracted  relationship 
and  nothing  else’.60 The  centring  of  contract  in  this  context  raised  the  following  questions. 
What  business  does  contract  law  have  in  the  therapy  room?  What  role  is  there  for  contract

law, a creature of market capitalism, in the quest for mental well-being supported by a thera-
peutic relationship?

Interviews with registered counsellors showed that contract is not only a figure for the for-
mal governance of professional ethics, professional conduct, and professional standards; it is 
a  central  part  of  the  clinical  and  business  practices  of  counsellors.  The  doctrine  of  contract 
supports the provision  of the service and regulates the ethical and legal obligations attached 
to  it.  But  its  work  is  deeper  still.  Contract’s  social  and  cultural  status  in  our  society  delivers 
to the therapeutic enterprise and to professional practice a sense of formality capable of cre-
ating  a  safe  and  effective  therapeutic  relationship.  It  supports  a  strategy  of  demarcation—in 
the  relationship  between  service  delivery  and  the  care,  empathy,  and  complex  emotional 
work  and  entanglement—that  facilitates  the  work  of  the  professional,  the  relationship  be-
tween  practitioner  and  client,  and  the  therapeutic  or  working  alliance.  Importing  contract 
and  contractual  language  into  a  therapeutic  relationship  becomes  a  means  to  establish  and 
maintain a commitment to goals negotiated between the counsellor and client, and becomes 
a therapeutic tool in itself.

Finally, the contract is seen to support a self-regulated profession at a ‘turning point’, vari-
ously professionalizing, advancing its self-regulation, and garnering greater recognition for its 
contribution  to  the  mental  health  sector  and  services  in  Australia.  In  this  moment,  contract 
is  seen  to  import  and  facilitate  a  sense  of  formality,  confidence,  seriousness,  respect,  and 
safety. As George said: 

You see, [contract] keeps out the ‘fly-by-nighters’, the ones [who] are not ethical, the ones 
[who] are there to rip people off  …  because anyone can put a shingle out these days and 
say, ‘I’m a counsellor’.

The  ability  for  contract  law  to  deliver  the  smooth  running  of  a  counselling  business  is  clear 
and  uncontroversial  for  these  counsellors.  But,  what  this  study  contributes  to  is  an  original 
understanding of the greater or additional roles of contract, and this is because of its rhetori-
cal power,  or, as we have termed it above, its ‘lived experience’. Contract’s power lies in be-
ing  able  to  cut  through,  simplify,  and  then  formalize  the  messiness  of  human  transactions 
with  a  set  of  rules:  to  create  boundaries  and  marginalize  difficult  emotions.  The  contract  is 
formal  and  therefore  serious.  It  is  freely  entered  into,  consented  to,  and  therefore  sacred.  It 
demands obedience and respect. These are the features of a contract that make it fit to per-
form the broader functions that regulatory bodies, such as the ACA, are charging it with.
