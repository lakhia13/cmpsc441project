Introduction

Eating Disorders (EDs) have a peak age at onset during key developmental adolescent years 
(Solmi et al., 2021), and have severe mental and physical health impacts (Voderholzer et 
al., 2020). The treatment of EDs is complex and typically involves several health care 
disciplines (Monteleone et al., 2019). However, the efficacy of treatment is modest (Treasure 
et al., 2020), with remission ranging from 40% to 60% in anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia 
nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED) (Eddy et al., 2017; Linardon, 2018a; Slade 
et al., 2018; Steinhausen, 2002; Steinhausen and Weber, 2009; Zipfel et al., 2015). The 
variability of remission also reflects the heterogeneous definition of remission (Bardone-
Cone et al., 2018), which should ideally encompass psychological, cognitive, physical 
(i.e., body mass index, BMI) and behavioural (i.e., binge eating or purging behaviours)

criteria (Lilienfeld, 2019). Relapse frequently occurs in EDs, especially after discharge from 
inpatient treatment (Gregertsen et al., 2019; Marzola et al., 2021b).

International guidelines (e.g., the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 
NICE, National Guideline Alliance, 2017) recommend psychological interventions as first-
line treatment for individuals with AN. Across psychotherapies, manualised family-based 
therapy (FBT) is suggested for adolescents with AN, while individual psychotherapies 
(i.e., cognitive-behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED), focal psychodynamic 
psychotherapy (FPT), Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults 
(MANTRA), or Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM)) are recommended 
for adults with AN. With the exception of FPT among these therapies, some have been 
superior to ‘treatment as usual’ conditions, but none has been found to be superior to 
another manualised specialist therapy (Byrne et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2016; van 
den Berg et al., 2019; Zeeck et al., 2018; Zipfel et al., 2014). International guidelines 
concur that medications should not be used as the sole or primary treatment for those 
with AN (Hilbert et al., 2017). For BN, NICE (2017) guidelines recommend individual 
psychological interventions as first-line treatment, namely FBT for adolescents or CBT-
ED (in both the guided self-care and therapist-delivered forms) for adults. This latter 
intervention is also considered the treatment of choice for BED in adults, yet no 
evidence-based recommendation is available for adolescents. Antidepressants, and selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in particular, have been proposed as an adjunctive 
treatment to psychotherapy for people within binge-eating spectrum disorders although only 
lisdexamfetamine has been approved in the US for BED (Hilbert et al., 2019; Slade et al., 
2018; Treasure et al., 2020). There is currently no approved medication for EDs in Europe 
except the fluoxetine for bulimia nervosa (Tortorella et al., 2014).

However, notable differences exist among the current guidelines (Hilbert et al., 2017). 
These inconsistent recommendations reflect methodological limitations. For instance, a 
network meta-analysis (NMA) by Zeeck et al. (2018) only considered body weight as 
the primary outcome and found more rapid weight gain in adolescents than in adults and 
no superiority of a specific psychological approach for adults with AN. A meta-analysis 
(MA) by Murray et al. (2019) considered both physical and psychological outcomes, 
and found that specialized psychological treatments outperformed control interventions on 
weight outcomes, but not on psychological outcomes, and no differences emerged between 
adolescents and adults with AN. Finally, a recent NMA (Solmi et al., 2021) only based 
on standalone outpatient treatment of adults with AN concluded that no reliable evidence 
supports the clear superiority or inferiority of any treatment recommended by the NICE 
guidelines.

A previous umbrella review summarized meta-analytic evidence on the efficacy and 
acceptability of interventions for any mental disorders including EDs (Correll et al., 
2021). However, that umbrella review only focused on children and adolescents, and 
only considered a pre-selected range of outcomes. A comprehensive umbrella review is 
needed to summarize the findings and to grade the quality of previous meta-analyses of 
RCTs in EDs, without restricting studies to specific age groups or specific outcomes, 
and providing a synopsis of efficacy, safety, acceptability and tolerability of treatments

for ED. Also, currently there is no umbrella review accounting for effect modifiers and 
confounding factors, and conducting analyses by age group, type of intervention, setting, 
control condition, ED diagnosis (i.e. AN, BN, BED, EDNOS), and mode of treatment 
delivery. The present work aims to fill this gap, distilling clinically relevant information 
from a vast body of data to inform clinical care, clinical guidelines, and research directions.

2  Methods

2.1  Search, inclusion and exclusion criteria

This umbrella review followed an a priori PRISMA 2020-compliant (Page et al., 2021) 
protocol (https://osf.io/wg5de/?view_only=177c444c41514fadb386ef1d57dee99d) (Figure 
1, supplementary Tables 1–2). We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, PsycINFO, 
and Cochrane database up to December 15th, 2020, using the search key “(anorexia or 
bulimia or eating disorder) AND (meta-analy*)”. We also manually searched references of 
included MAs and other relevant reviews. Two independent (FP, MC) authors conducted 
title/abstract screening, full-text assessment, and data extraction into a pre-defined Excel 
spreadsheet. A third author (MS) resolved any conflicts.

Included were: a) MAs or NMAs, b) of RCTs testing any intervention in comparison to an 
active or inactive control condition, c) in any age group and setting, d) in participants with 
a DSM/ICD diagnosis of an eating disorder (AN, BN, BED, eating disorder not otherwise 
specified or unspecified feeding or eating disorder (EDNOS or OS/UFED), e) reporting on 
comparative estimates of efficacy, and discontinuation due to any cause (acceptability) or 
due to adverse events (tolerability). Exclusion criteria were: a) systematic reviews without 
MA, b) pooling studies other than RCTs, c) including participants without an ED diagnosis, 
d) MA reporting on pre-post changes of a given set of interventions.

Whenever two NMAs/MAs reported on the same combination of disorders, interventions, 
comparisons and/or outcomes, we prioritized NMA over MA, or MA with more RCTs. 
NMAs have been prioritized over pairwise MAs previously, as they are deemed the 
highest level of evidence in treatment guidelines (Leucht et al., 2016). To avoid relying 
on completely indirect estimates, we only extracted effect sizes from NMAs that were based 
on at least one direct comparison for the outcome of interest.

2.2  Participants, interventions, comparison, outcomes, setting operationalization

Participants were diagnosed with AN, BN, BED, EDNOS/OSFED, or combined ED. Their 
age group could be adolescents (<18 years only), adults (≥ 18 years old only) or mixed.

We categorized interventions as follows: behavioural therapy (including behavioral 
weight loss therapy) (BT), CBT-ED, family therapy (FAM) (separating specific family-
based therapy, FBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), Maudsley Model of Anorexia 
Nervosa Treatment for Adults, mixed or unspecified psychotherapy (PT), multidisciplinary 
care (including SSCM) (MULTI), psychodynamic-oriented (PSD-O), psychoeducation 
(EDU), physical exercise, and pharmacological treatments. Pharmacological treatments 
were subdivided by class (antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, stimulants,

anti-obesity). Treatment format was individual (-i), group (-g), self-help (-s), or their 
combinations.

Comparators were specific drug or psychological intervention (active), treatment as usual 
(TAU), placebo (PBO), waiting list or no treatment (WL/NT), mixed TAU and WL/NT, 
mixed active and WL/NT.

Outcomes were ED-specific behaviours (BEHAVIOURAL, i.e. binge-eating and/or purging 
episodes remission or frequency, compensatory behaviours), neuropsychological functioning 
(COGNITION, i.e. central coherence, emotion recognition), eating disorder-specific 
psychopathology (EDP, i.e. body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, shape/weight concern); 
functioning and quality of life (F-QOL); general psychiatric symptoms (GENERAL, i.e. 
depressive/anxiety/obsessive-compulsive); global course of the disease (GLOBAL, i.e. 
response/remission/relapse/clinical improvement/abstinence from binge eating/abstinence 
from purging/all outcomes); weight or body mass index (WEIGHT/BODY). Whenever 
possible, we extracted outcomes both at end of treatment and at follow up (any time point). 
Acceptability (inferred from drop out due to any cause) and safety (adverse effects of 
medications) were also extracted.

The setting in which the intervention was delivered was inpatient only, outpatient only, or 
mixed.

2.3  Quality of evidence

The quality of MAs and NMAs was measured using A Measurement Tool for the 
Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-PLUS) (Correll et al., 2017) to 
quantify both the methodological quality of MAs and NMAs with the first 11 items 
(AMSTAR) (Shea et al., 2007), and of included RCTs with six additional items (AMSTAR-
Content (Correll et al., 2017), for each MA/NMA primary outcome).

Methodological quality was categorized as low (<4), medium (4–7), and high (>7). Content 
quality was categorized as low (<4), medium (4–6), and high (>6), as done previously 
(Correll et al., 2021; Solmi et al., 2020). Quality assessment was done by two independent 
reviewers. Full details on the quality assessment are available elsewhere (Correll et al., 2021; 
Solmi et al., 2020).

2.4  Statistical analysis

We did not recalculate all NMAs or MAs, and just reported what the original authors had 
done. However, in order to provide results on the same scale in Figure 2, where possible, we 
standardized and harmonized effect sizes. For instance, where mean difference was reported, 
we transformed it into standardized mean difference (SMD). Also, we harmonized outcome 
reporting, so that SMD>0 and odds ratio/risk ratio (OR/RR) >1 favor intervention for all 
outcomes. For instance, if a MA reported ED psychopathology improvement as SMD<0, 
we inverted the mathematical sign and 95% confidence interval. For AN, weight gain was 
reported as SMD>0, whilst for BED weight loss was reported with SMD>0, so that the 
statistical direction matched the clinical direction of the finding.

The search flow is reported in Figure 1. Out of 884 articles, 55 MAs and 4 NMAs were 
included (Albano et al., 2019; Bacaltchuk et al., 1999; Josue Bacaltchuk et al., 2000; Josué 
Bacaltchuk et al., 2000; Bacaltchuk and Hay, 2003; Barakat et al., 2019; Berkman et al.,

Machado and Ferreira, 2014; Murray et al., 2019; Nakash-Eisikovits et al., 2002; Ng et al., 
2013; Nourredine et al., 2020; Palavras et al., 2017; Peat et al., 2017; Perkins et al., 2006; 
Polnay et al., 2014; Reas and Grilo, 2008; Eric Slade et al., 2018; M Solmi et al., 2021; 
Stefano et al., 2008, 2006; Svaldi et al., 2019; Swift et al., 2017; Thompson-Brenner et al., 
2003; Traviss-Turner et al., 2017; van den Berg et al., 2019; Vocks et al., 2010; Zeeck et 
al., 2018). Publications excluded after full-text assessment, with reason for exclusion are 
available in supplementary table 3. MAs and NMAs included in the umbrella review are 
reported in table 1. Among included (N)MAs, 33 (55.9%) assessed non-pharmacological 
interventions only, 16 (27.1%) pharmacological interventions only, while 10 (17%) assessed 
both (AN: 65%/35%/0%; BN: 60%/20%/20%; BED: 47.4%/26.3%/26.3%; combined ED: 
94.1%/0%/5.9%). Overall, 33 different non-pharmacological interventions and 19 different 
(combinations of) medications have been identified. Regarding age groups, 19 (57.6%) 
(N)MAs reported on adults, five (15.2%) on adolescents, and the remaining nine (27.3%) 
reported on mixed or unspecified age. Only one MA (1.7%) reported on inpatients, and 
in AN only; eight (13.6%) reported on outpatients; and the others on any or unspecified 
settings.

The number of trials for a specific outcome ranged from 2–35 (median=4, interquartile 
range=2–7).

Quality of included studies is reported in supplementary table 4. Overall AMSTAR/
AMSTAR-Content mean scores were 7.9±1.7 and 2.7±1.5. Thirty-five (59.3%) (N)MAs had 
an AMSTAR >7, one (1.7%) had the maximum score (11), whilst none had an AMSTAR-
Content score >6. The main reasons for lower quality rating had to do with the quality of 
the meta-analyzed RCTs included in (N)MAs, and namely no “double-blind” design in most 
of the studies (81%), primary outcome result not confirmed in at least one large study with 
approximately 100 patients per arm (74%), and the presence of publication bias regarding 
the primary outcome result (78%).

Below, effect sizes versus WL/NT, PBO, TAU and Active are reported by disorder (see 
tables 2–3). We left results from MAs mixing TAU with active or inactive controls in 
supplementary tables only, as those comparisons inappropriately mixed different control 
groups (see supplementary tables 5–6). In the paragraphs below, results are reported with 
number of RCTs (k), number of subjects (n), effect size with 95% confidence interval, 
quality score, and quality category (L/low, M/medium, H/high).

3.1  Anorexia nervosa

Page 7

AN was investigated in two NMAs and 18 MAs; four (20.0%) reported data on adolescents, 
seven (35.0%) on adult patients.

In adolescent outpatients, individual family-based therapy proved efficacious versus active 
control for global course of the disease at follow up (k=3, n=183, OR=2.08, 95%CI=1.07–
4.03, AMSTAR/Quality=9/H), and individual family therapy in mixed settings for change in 
weight or body composition (k=4, n=178, SMD=0.44, 95%CI=0.14–0.74, AMSTAR/Quality 
9/H) (40.0% of interventions).

In adults, overall, 25.0% of the interventions had evidence of efficacy, but none in the 
outpatient setting, 33.3% in mixed settings, and only compared to TAU; specifically, 
individual family therapy proved beneficial for global course of the disease (k=2, n=81, 
RR=3.50, 95%CI=1.49–8.23, AMSTAR/Quality=9/H).

Results on mixed age groups are reported in eResults section.

3.2.1  Bulimia nervosa efficacy—BN was investigated in one NMA and 19 MAs; two 
(10.0%) reported data on adolescents, six (30.0%) on adults.

For adolescents, compared to active control, in outpatients individual family-based therapy 
improved global course of the disease at follow-up (k=2, n=37, OR=2.22, 95%CI=1.02–
4.82, AMSTAR/Quality=9/H), whereas in Mixed settings cognitive behavioural therapy for 
eating disorders did not differ from active control.

In adults, 42.9% of the interventions proved beneficial and 7.1% had both beneficial and 
detrimental effects. In outpatients, only group cognitive behavioural therapy for eating 
disorders was covered, compared to wait list-no treatment, with efficacy regarding eating 
disorder behaviours (k=4, n=51, SMD=0.56, 95%CI=0.15–0.96, AMSTAR/Quality=9/H) 
and global course of the disease (k=2, n=31, RR=1.29, 95%CI=1.04–1.61, AMSTAR/
Quality=9/H). In mixed settings, compared to wait list-no treatment, individual cognitive 
behavioural therapy for eating disorders and individual psychotherapy were both beneficial 
for eating disorder behaviours (k=9, n=323, SMD=1.01, 95%CI=0.68–1.33, AMSTAR/
Quality=5/M; k=5, n=206, SMD=1.22, 95%CI=0.92–1.52, AMSTAR/Quality=5/M), 
general psychiatric symptoms (k=6, n=223, SMD=0.80, 95%CI=0.37–1.22, AMSTAR/
Quality=5/M; k=3, n=101, SMD=0.58, 95%CI=0.18–0.98, AMSTAR/Quality=5/M) and 
global course of the disease (k=5, n=204, OR=1.49, 95%CI=1.28–1.72, AMSTAR/
Quality=6.5/M; k=na, n=554, OR=3.89, 95%CI=1.19–14.0, AMSTAR/Quality=6.5/M; k=4, 
n=162, OR=1.54, 95%CI=1.30–1.82, AMSTAR/Quality=6.5/M). Global course of the

course of the disease (k=6, n=257, RR=0.83, 95%CI=0.69–0.98, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H). 
Antidepressants were beneficial for eating disorder behaviours (k=3, n=89, RR=2.08, 
95%CI=1.09–25.0, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H) and general psychiatric symptoms (k=3, n=117, 
RR=2.13, 95%CI=1.09–100, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H).

Results on mixed age groups are reported in eResults section.

3.2.2  Bulimia Nervosa acceptability—Individual psychotherapy was more acceptable 
than active control (k=6, n=295, RR=1.75, 95%CI=1.14–2.63, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H).

3.3.1  Binge-Eating Disorder efficacy—Data for BED were extracted from one NMA 
and 18 MAs; none provided information on adolescents, six (31.6%) specifically on adults.

In adult outpatients, individual cognitive behavioural therapy for eating disorders 
outperformed active control improving eating disorder behaviours (k=4, n=323, MD=2.04, 
95%CI=0.35–3.73, AMSTAR/Quality=9/H). In mixed settings, 57.1% of the interventions 
proved beneficial, and 28.6% had both favourable and unfavourable outcomes. 
Compared to wait list-no treatment, individual cognitive behavioural therapy for eating 
disorders proved beneficial for eating disorder behaviours (k=3, n=208, MD=2.32, 
95%CI=0.09–4.56, AMSTAR/Quality=11/H) and global course of the disease (k=4, 
n=401, RR=4.95, 95%CI=3.06–8.00, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H). Compared to placebo, 
antidepressants were superior for eating disorder behaviours (k=7, n=na, MD=0.67, 
95%CI=0.09–1.26, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H), eating disorder psychopathology (k=3, n=na, 
MD=3.84, 95%CI=1.13–6.55, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H), general psychiatric symptoms 
(k=3, n=na, MD=1.97, 95%CI=0.28–3.67, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H) and global course 
of the disease (k=8, n=548, RR=1.67, 95%CI=1.24–2.26, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H). 
Also, stimulants improved eating disorder behaviours (k=3, n=1033, SMD=0.56, 
95%CI=0.28–0.84, AMSTAR/Quality=9/H), eating disorder psychopathology (k=3, n=na, 
MD=6.50, 95%CI=4.18–8.82, AMSTAR/Quality=8/H), global course of the disease (k=3, 
n=1033, RR=1.58, 95%CI=1.35–1.84, AMSTAR/Quality=9/H; k=3, n=1033, RR=2.43,

(k=3, n=1033, SMD=1.28, 95%CI=1.06–1.51, AMSTAR/Quality=9/H). Anticonvulsants 
improved eating disorder behaviours (k=na, n=na, MD=0.98, 95%CI 0.15–1.80, AMSTAR/
Quality=5/M; k=3, n=528, MD=1.31, 95%CI=0.03–2.58, AMSTAR/Quality=5/M) and 
change in weight or body composition (k=3, n=528, MD=4.91, 95%CI=3.41–6.42,

4  Discussion

To our knowledge this is the first umbrella review to systematically assess efficacy and 
acceptability of interventions specifically for EDs from (N)MAs of RCTs, and both the 
quality of the (N)MAs and of the meta-analysed RCTs. This umbrella review also follows 
recent recommendations regarding the need to consider a wide range of outcomes in EDs 
(Murray et al., 2018) including treatment acceptability (Grenon et al., 2018b). Pooling data 
from 55 MAs and 4 NMAs, this work advances the field by filtering the enormous body 
of meta-analytic evidence on interventions in EDs (1,154 effect sizes), rating quality, and 
providing clinicians, guideline developers and researchers with an informative synopsis of 
what works better than treatment as usual and/or active control, for which symptoms, at 
which time-points, and based on what quality of evidence.

For AN, family-based treatment was the only intervention supported by some 
evidence against other active treatments for both remission and weight gain. In BN, 
individual cognitive behavioural therapy for ED outperformed other active treatments 
for ED psychopathology and behaviours, as well as remission. Among pharmacological 
interventions, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and SSRIs were the most efficacious for 
ED behaviours and remission. In BED, general psychotherapy (i.e., any manualised 
psychological therapy) was more efficacious versus active controls for ED psychopathology 
and drop-out, but less effective for weight reduction; while behavioural treatments 
(including behavioural weight loss treatment) and cognitive behavioural therapy for ED 
were more efficacious than active treatments for ED psychopathology and behaviours, 
respectively. Lisdexamfetamine and antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo 
for ED psychopathology, ED behaviours, and remission. Antidepressants were also more 
effective than placebo for general psychiatric symptoms, while lisdexamfetamine as well as 
anticonvulsants and sibutramine were more effective than placebo for weight reduction. All 
these findings refer to status at the end of treatment.

Regarding data on follow-up, a smaller body of evidence was available. In adolescent 
outpatients with AN and with BN, family-based therapy was more effective than active 
control on remission. In BN, cognitive behavioural therapy for ED outperformed other active 
treatments regarding ED behaviours. In BED, behavioural treatment was less effective than 
active control for ED behaviours and remission, whereas psychotherapy was more effective 
for ED psychopathology.

This distilled evidence calls for a critical analysis of current treatment guidelines for EDs. 
For AN, this umbrella review supports the practice guidelines that each recommend family-
based therapy for younger patients (Hilbert et al., 2017), although a recent Cochrane review 
(Fisher et al., 2019) commented that there is a limited amount of low-quality evidence to

suggest that family therapy approaches may be more effective compared to treatment as 
usual. In young adults (mean age: 15.2–26.2) with AN, family therapy (not family-based 
treatment) was more effective than treatment as usual regarding global remission at the end 
of treatment (medium-large effect). This finding is novel and seems to have been neglected 
by guidelines, which recommend individual psychotherapy for adults with AN, especially 
cognitive behavioural therapy for ED (Hilbert et al., 2017). A recent NMA (M Solmi et 
al., 2021) found no superiority of the most recommended individual psychotherapies (e.g. 
CBT-ED, MANTRA, SSCM, psychodynamic therapies) versus treatment as usual in adult 
outpatients with AN. However, that work focused on symptoms, and not global remission 
as the outcome. Thus, the current findings suggest that interventions involving family might 
be considered in young adults with AN, although research should aim to develop good 
alternatives, which does not essentially shift the treatment responsibility to families, as 
not all adults with AN have families involved in their care. No medication was found 
to be effective in reducing ED behaviours/psychopathology or general symptoms or in 
improving weight outcome, supporting previous evidence that the use of medications cannot 
be recommended to improve body weight or ED-specific psychopathology in AN (Treasure 
et al., 2020; Zipfel et al., 2015), unless psychiatric comorbidity is present.

In BN, the most robust evidence exists for individual cognitive behavioural therapy for ED, 
which was more effective in reducing specific and, possibly, general symptoms compared 
with active treatments at the end of treatment. The positive effect on ED behaviours 
persisted at follow-up. Compared to wait list-no treatment, not only cognitive behavioural 
therapy for ED but also general psychotherapy (i.e., any manualised psychological therapy) 
was more efficacious. The evidence for adolescents was different, here family-based 
therapy outperformed other active interventions on remission at follow-up. These findings 
support international clinical guidelines (Hilbert et al., 2017) which recommend individual 
cognitive behavioural therapy for ED as the first line treatment for adults with BN and 
family-based therapies for younger patients. The NICE guidelines (2017) suggest the use 
of guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy for ED as the first choice: however, this 
recommendation is not corroborated by our findings that confirm the efficacy of self-help 
as well as group-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for ED only in comparison to 
wait list-no treatment, where expectation effects are not controlled for. NICE includes 
a cost-effectiveness outcome that was not considered in the present work, which might 
contribute to the highlighted discrepancy. Furthermore, antidepressants (both SSRIs and the 
TCAs) outperformed active treatments for ED behaviours and general symptoms and were 
more effective than placebo for ED behaviours and remission. However, antidepressants 
were less acceptable than placebo, when contrasted with psychotherapy. These findings are 
in line with the recommendations from most guidelines (Hilbert et al., 2017), suggesting 
antidepressants (i.e., the SSRIs) and psychotherapy for people with BN, although there was 
no evidence relating to the combination of these two treatments over monotherapy.

In BED, the largest evidence existed for lisdexamfetamine and antidepressants. Across 
psychotherapies, general psychotherapy (i.e., any manualised psychological therapy) and 
behavioural treatment outperformed active treatments for ED psychopathology as did 
cognitive behavioural therapy for ED for ED behaviours at the end of treatment. Although 
general psychotherapy was less efficacious than active treatments for weight reduction,

it was considered more acceptable and its effect on ED psychopathology persisted 
at follow-up in comparison to both active treatments and wait list-no treatment. In 
contrast, behavioural treatment was less efficacious than active treatments at follow-up. 
Our findings only partially concur with guidelines (Hilbert et al., 2017) that consistently 
recommend the use of cognitive behavioural therapy for ED as the specific psychological 
intervention for BED. Indeed, other (non-CBT-ED) psychotherapies including third wave 
psychotherapies were efficacious when pooled with cognitive behavioural therapy for ED. 
However, cognitive behavioural therapy remains the psychological treatment of choice 
for BED with evidence for a broad set of efficacy outcomes, relatively low attrition 
and some evidence on low side effects, and cognitive behavioural therapy was evaluated 
in the largest number of RCTs in comparison with wait-list. Regarding pharmacological 
interventions, antidepressants (SSRIs), anticonvulsants (namely topiramate) and anti-obesity 
drugs (orlistat and sibutramine) are recommended in some but not all the guidelines. 
However, lisdexamfetamine is the only medication indicated for BED by the US Food 
and Drug Administration (Fornaro et al., 2016). Nevertheless, for consideration of a 
range of treatment options, the present findings suggest that all guidelines may consider 
pharmacological treatments for BED, given the benefits on a wide range of outcomes 
at the end of treatment. However, there is no evidence regarding the effectiveness of 
medications at follow-up in people with BED, direct comparisons with psychological 
interventions are lacking and, compared to placebo, lisdexamfetamine was associated with 
more adverse events, and topiramate was considered less acceptable. This lack of evidence 
on sustainability at follow-up may explain why the European Medications Agency (EMA) 
has not approved any medication for BED, and medications can only be recommended 
off-label in clinical guidelines.

Remarkably, three findings emerged as transdiagnostic features of treatments for people 
with EDs and are worth outlining. First, except for long-term effects of family-based 
treatment, no treatment showed a significant and positive impact for psychopathology 
and/or behaviours of adolescents with AN or with BN, while for those with BED studies 
of family-based treatment are missing. Future studies are encouraged to assess treatment 
effectiveness in adolescents given that most of EDs, except BED, have onset during 
adolescence (Volpe et al., 2016). Second, long-term treatment effects were found only for 
psychotherapy interventions, while medications displayed significant effects only at the end 
of treatment. This finding suggests that maintenance treatment studies with medications are 
needed. Third, some medications showed either less acceptability or safety than placebo. 
This finding suggests that clinicians and patients need to be aware of and monitor if/to what 
degree pharmacological or psychotherapeutic interventions potentially do harm. Overall, 
these findings may help clinicians with decision making and suggest possible areas for 
future research.

Limitations of this umbrella review need to be acknowledged. First, we selected network 
over pairwise meta-analyses, and chose the largest (rather than the highest quality) of the 
meta-analyses regarding the same population, intervention, control, and outcome. Individual 
RCTs not pooled in previous MAs were not included. Second, we combined different 
active control conditions, leading to a loss of granularity regarding potential differences 
in the efficacy between different active treatment conditions. However, we separated TAU

from active control treatments. Third, the number of studies and participants varied across 
interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. However, for transparency, we also reported 
how large the body of evidence was for each result. Fourth, fewer data were available 
for long-term outcomes, which this is a limitation of treatment literature. Fifth, apart 
from few MAs (M Solmi et al., 2021), many MAs, and most of those with significant 
findings considered mixed settings of care and did not yield specific recommendations 
for the inpatient and outpatient levels of care. Sixth, feasibility and acceptability were 
poorly reported in the included (N)MAs. Seventh, the duration of follow-up data cannot be 
gleaned from the present findings. Finally, individual patient data meta/analyses are needed 
to generate fine grained insight on specific clinical subpopulations. Nevertheless, despite 
these limitations, to our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive and inclusive umbrella 
review of interventions for people with EDs that can inform clinicians, patients and their 
families, guideline developers and researchers.

Based in these findings, many gaps remain in the literature. For example, long-term effects 
and the effectiveness of combined interventions (e.g., the combination of psychotherapy and 
pharmacotherapy, which is an effective strategy in common mental disorders (Cuijpers et 
al., 2020)), has been poorly studied or there are, in people with BED (Hilbert et al., 2019), 
many different combination treatment arms, which prevent detailed comparison. Similarly, 
second order treatments for those individuals for whom first line treatments fail have been 
neglected. Moreover, no meta-analytic evidence was found for treatments in people with 
OSFED. Finally, the cost-effectiveness outcome, required by NICE, has not been largely 
addressed in ED treatment studies and has thus not been reported in (N)MAs, but this 
outcome needs to be considered in future studies.

In conclusion, this umbrella review supports the recommendations from most guidelines 
relating to BN, and extends support of multidimensional short-term treatment efficacy, 
especially for cognitive behavioural therapy for ED. Our results also confirm the absence 
of a differential effect across most specialized individual psychological interventions for 
AN, apart from family-based therapy in adolescents, and interventions involving families 
show some efficacy in young adults. Importantly, such interventions outperformed active 
control on a limited number of outcomes. Our findings are partially consistent with 
current guidelines for BED, supporting the efficacy of psychotherapy (including cognitive 
behavioural therapy for ED). In addition, short-term efficacy of medications (especially 
SSRIs and the lisdexamfetamine) may be considered and long-term effects require further 
study.

Despite the importance of the transdiagnostic perspective in EDs (Fairburn et al., 2003) and 
in other mental disorders (Fusar-Poli et al., 2019), these findings highlight the importance 
of not viewing EDs as a monolithic diagnostic entity. Differences across the main ED 
diagnoses in terms of treatment response need to be considered by researchers and 
clinicians, while acknowledging some transdiagnostic general psychopathology (Monteleone 
and Cascino, 2021; Solmi et al., 2018), and risk factors (Marzola et al., 2021a). Future 
meta-analyses should avoid clustering different populations (namely intervention studies 
should have more descriptors related to the clinical presentation such as weight status or 
illness duration), interventions, controls, and outcomes, and novel treatments should be
