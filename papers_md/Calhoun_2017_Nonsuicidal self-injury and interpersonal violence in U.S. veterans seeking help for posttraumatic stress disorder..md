Abstract

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has been defined as deliberately damaging one's body tissue 
without conscious suicidal intent. NSSI is a robust predictor of suicidal ideation and attempts in 
adults. While NSSI has been associated with other-directed violence in adolescent populations, the 
link between NSSI and interpersonal violence in adults is less clear. The current study examined 
the cross-sectional relationship between NSSI and past-year interpersonal violence among 729 
help-seeking veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Veterans who reported a recent 
history of engaging in cutting, hitting, or burning themselves were significantly more likely to 
report making violent threats and engaging in violent acts, including the use of a knife or gun, in 
the past year than veterans without NSSI. NSSI was uniquely associated with interpersonal 
violence after controlling for a variety of dispositional, historical, contextual, and clinical risk 
factors for violence, including age, race, socio-economic status, marital status, employment status, 
combat exposure, alcohol misuse, depression, PTSD symptom severity, and reported difficulty 
controlling violence. These findings suggest that clinicians working with veterans with PTSD 
should review NSSI history when conducting a risk assessment of violence.

1. Introduction

Page 2

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as deliberately damaging one's body tissue without 
conscious suicidal intent (Chapman et al., 2006; Kimbrel et al., 2016; Kimbrel et al., 2015; 
Kimbrel et al., 2014). The most common methods of NSSI include self-burning, self-cutting, 
self-hitting, and severe scratching (Klonsky, 2011). It is estimated that 6% of the U.S. 
general population will engage in NSSI at some point in their lifetime (Briere and Gil, 1998; 
Klonsky, 2011). Although NSSI has historically been viewed as more common among 
females than males, population-based studies of NSSI have consistently failed to find 
evidence for sex differences in rates of NSSI among adults (Kimbrel et al., 2016). NSSI has 
been associated with significantly increased risk of suicidal behavior in military and veteran 
samples (Bryan et al., 2015; Kimbrel et al., 2016; Kimbrel et al., 2014). Further, high rates 
of NSSI have been found among treatment seeking, psychiatric populations of veterans 
(Bryan and Bryan, 2014; Kimbrel et al., 2016; Kimbrel et al., 2015; Kimbrel et al., 2014). 
Studies of treatment seeking male veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have 
documented that as many as 57%-66% have a lifetime history of NSSI (Kimbrel et al., 2016; 
Kimbrel et al., 2015; Kimbrel et al., 2014; Sacks et al., 2008). Although NSSI is a form of 
self-directed violence, it may also be associated with increased risk for interpersonal 
violence (Kleiman et al., 2015; Wolff et al., 2014), however, to date the association between 
NSSI and interpersonal violence has not been studied among veterans with PTSD.

PTSD has been shown to be associated with anger, aggressiveness, and interpersonal 
violence (Calhoun et al., 2002; Crawford et al., 2007). Help-seeking male veterans with 
PTSD are more likely to exhibit violence and report problems with violent behavior than 
help-seeking veterans without PTSD (Beckham et al., 1997; Elbogen et al., 2010b; Freeman 
and Roca, 2001). A recent study of U.S. Iraq and Afghanistan era veterans indicated that 
67% reported that they had threatened someone or engaged in other types of aggressive 
behavior in the past month (Wright et al., 2012). Thus, it is critically important that the 
potential for aggression and violence in veterans with PTSD be systematically evaluated. 
Approaches to the assessment of violence potential in veterans have called for the 
application of empirically-supported models that examine dispositional factors (e.g., 
younger age), historical factors (e.g., combat exposure, past violent behavior), contextual 
factors (e.g., unemployment), and clinical factors such as PTSD, depression, and substance 
abuse (Elbogen et al., 2010a).

From this perspective, given that NSSI is associated with PTSD in veterans, which in turn 
has been shown to be related to elevated violence risk (Elbogen et al., 2010a), NSSI itself 
may be an important clinical factor to examine with respect to interpersonal violence. 
Indeed, several studies have indicated that NSSI is positively associated with aggression in 
adolescents in both community (Brunner et al., 2007; Fliege et al., 2009; Sourander et al., 
2006) and psychiatric settings (Boxer, 2010; Vivona et al., 1995). To date, no studies have 
examined the association between NSSI and interpersonal violence in a veteran population.

The objective of the current study was to examine the association between NSSI and 
interpersonal violence in help-seeking male veterans with PTSD. We hypothesized that 
NSSI would be positively associated with aggression and reports of interpersonal violence.

In order to examine whether NSSI might be an important clinical factor associated with 
identifying other-directed violence, the second objective of the present study was to examine 
whether NSSI was uniquely related to interpersonal violence after accounting for well-
established dispositional, historical, contextual and clinical risk factors associated with 
violence including: age, race, marital status, unemployment, socioeconomic status (SES), 
combat exposure, PTSD symptom severity, depression, alcohol misuse, and reported 
difficulty controlling violence (Elbogen et al., 2010a). Given previous work documenting 
differential associations between NSSI and suicide as a function of NSSI severity (Kimbrel 
et al., 2014), we explored potential differences in the association between NSSI and violence 
among those who engaged in less severe forms of NSSI (e.g., only scratching/picking) and 
more severe NSSI (e.g., cutting/hitting/burning oneself).

2. Method

2.1 Participants and procedure

The study sample was drawn from an archival dataset that included 729 male, help-seeking 
veterans with PTSD who were evaluated at an outpatient Veterans Affairs (VA) specialty 
PTSD clinic from 2000-2014, who completed the measures described below. Veterans 
completed a structured clinical interview and a battery of self-report measures as part of 
their standard diagnostic procedure. PTSD diagnosis was based on the Clinician-
Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS; (Blake et al., 1995)] following Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders [(4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV_TR; (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2000)] criteria. IRB approval for use of these data for research purposes was 
obtained. The association between deliberate self-harm and levels of PTSD and impulsivity 
(Sacks et al., 2008) and suicidal ideation (Kimbrel et al., 2014) has been previously 
described for a portion of the sample. Demographic characteristics of the sample are 
described in Table 1. The sample was predominately African-American (52%) and 
Caucasian (43%). The majority of the sample were Vietnam veterans (59%); 21% of the 
sample served during the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. On average, participants were 
48 years old (SD = 12.3).

2.2 Measures

2.2.1 Non-Suicidal Self Injury—The Habit Questionnaire [HQ: (Resnick and Weaver, 
1994)] is an 11-item self-report measure that assesses NSSI and body-focused repetitive 
behavior. NSSI was assessed using the 4-item deliberate self-harm subscale (Kimbrel et al., 
2014; Sacks et al., 2008) which has demonstrated validity (Kimbrel et al., 2014; Sacks et al., 
2008). NSSI is assessed with the following items: (1) “Have you ever scratched or picked at 
your skin so that it left a mark?” (2) Have you ever deliberately cut yourself in any way?” 
(3) “Have you ever hit yourself?” and (4) “Have you burned yourself with a cigarette, match, 
or other way?” Participants who reported engaging in any of these behaviors during the 
previous two weeks were considered to have current NSSI.

2.2.2. Violence—The Conflict Tactics Scale [CTS; Form N; (Straus, 1979)] is a widely 
used 20-item measure of interpersonal violence with demonstrated reliability and validity 
(Straus, 1989; Straus, 1979, 1990). CTS items were used to identify the proportion of

patients who endorsed engaging in threats of violence, minor violence, and severe violence 
following previously established methods [e.g., (McFall et al., 1999; Straus, 1979)]. Threats 
included “Threatening to hit or throw something at the other person”. Minor violence 
included the items: “Threw something at the other person”; “Pushed, grabbed, or shoved the 
other person” and “Slapped a person”. Severe violence included the items: “Kicked, bit, or 
hit with a fist”; “Beat up the other person”; “Threatened the other person with a knife or 
gun” and “Used a knife or gun”. Weapon related violence was defined as violent threats with 
a knife or gun or the use of a knife or gun. Items are rated for occurrence in the past year on 
a scale ranging from 0 (never), 1 (once), 2 (twice), 3 (3 to 5 times), 4 (6 to 10 times), 5 (11 
to 20 times), to 6 (more than 20 times). In order to examine the proportion of the sample 
engaging in each violence domain, scores were transformed to dichotomous indicators, 
where 0 = never and 1 = one or more occurrences of the index behavior. Additionally, a total 
measure of the count of violent acts (i.e., minor and severe violence) committed in the past 
year was scored by assigning the mid-points of the latter four response categories and 
summing the items (Straus, 1979). Following previous research using the CTS with veterans 
(Crawford et al., 2007; Jordan et al., 1992; Van Voorhees et al., 2014), high violence was 
defined as 13 or more violent acts in the past year. Internal consistency of these scoring 
methods is adequate [alpha .79-.83; (Straus, 1979, 1990)].

2.2.4 Demographic information—Demographic information included age, race, 
socioeconomic status (SES) based on the Hollingshead Index of Social Status (Hollingshead 
and Redlich, 1958), employment status, and marital status.

2.2.5. Combat exposure—Combat exposure was measured with the Combat Exposure 
Scale [CES: (Keane et al., 1989)] a well-validated 7-item scale measuring exposure to 
combat-related traumatic experiences. This measure has excellent psychometric properties 
including reliability and temporal stability (Keane et al., 1989).

2.2.6. PTSD and Depression—The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a 
structured clinical interview that assesses DSM-IV PTSD symptom frequency and intensity 
and is considered to be the “gold-standard” for PTSD assessment (Weathers et al., 2001; 
Weathers et al., 2004). For diagnostic purposes, a PTSD symptom was considered present on 
the CAPS based on a rule of frequency > 1 and severity > 2 (Blake et al., 1995). The CAPS 
was administered or directly supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist. Fleiss’ kappa 
among interviewers in the clinic across a series of 5 training tapes was .94. PTSD symptom 
severity was measured as the total CAPS score (Weathers et al., 2001). The presence of 
major depression was assessed using the Major Depressive Disorder Module of the 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [SCID; (First et al., 1994)].

2.2.7. Alcohol misuse—The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT; 
(Saunders et al., 1993)] is a ten-item measure assessing three factors: alcohol consumption, 
alcohol dependence, and adverse consequences of alcohol use. The range of possible scores 
is 0-40 with higher scores indicating increased probability of an alcohol use disorder. The 
AUDIT has been found to have high test-retest reliability (r = .86) and a high level of 
agreement with other measures of alcohol use disorders (Babor et al., 2001).

2.2.8. Recent history of violence—A single item was used to assess recent history of 
difficulty controlling violent behavior, “During the past thirty days, have you had trouble 
controlling violent behavior (that is, hitting someone)?” [see e.g., (Crawford et al., 2007; 
McFall et al., 1999)].

2.3. Analytic strategy

Bivariate analyses examined the association of any NSSI with demographic and clinical 
variables. The association between violence and NSSI was examined where NSSI was coded 
as a three group variable including 1) no NSSI, 2) scratching/picking only, and 3) any 
cutting, hitting, or burning. In order to examine the incremental utility of NSSI as a predictor 
of violence, multivariable models were run that included dispositional, historical, contextual 
and clinical factors associated with violence (Elbogen et al., 2010b) including a simple yes-
no admission of difficulty controlling violent behavior in the past 30 days. Logistic 
regression was used to examine the proportion of patients reporting making threats, 
engaging in any minor violence, and engaging in any severe violence. Because weapon 
related violence is particularly dangerous, we further evaluated severe violence by 
examining the proportion of patients who endorsed making violent threats with a weapon as 
well as those who endorsed violence using a knife or gun. Logistic regression was also used 
to examine the association between NSSI and high levels of violence (i.e., reporting 13 or 
more violent acts). All models were adjusted for age, race (minority vs. White), marital 
status (unmarried vs. married), employment status (unemployed vs. working full or part 
time), SES (Hollingshead Index), alcohol misuse (AUDIT total score), presence of major 
depression, PTSD symptom severity (CAPS total score) and reported difficulty controlling 
violence.

The total number of violent acts in the past year was modeled with negative binomial 
regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Negative binomial regression is 
appropriate for the analysis of highly skewed and overdispersed (i.e., with variance greater 
than the mean) count data such as the number of violent acts in the past year (Elhai et al., 
2008). Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models account for excessive zero responses. 
The Vuong test (macro available at http://support.sas.com/kb/42/514.html) was used to 
compare model fit between the negative-binomial regression model and the ZINB model 
(Elhai et al., 2008). As in Poisson regression analysis, each negative binomial regression 
coefficient, when exponentiated, is an estimate of the incidence rate ratio, e.g., the ratio of 
the incidence of violent acts in the NSSI positive group to that in the NSSI negative group 
(Elhai et al., 2008). All statistical analyses were performed with SAS PC, Version 9.4 (SAS 
Inc.., Cary NC).

3. Results

3.1. Rates of NSSI and Violence among Help-Seeking Veterans

High levels of combat exposure and PTSD symptoms were present in the sample of male, 
help-seeking veterans with PTSD (see Table 1). Rates of violence were also highly prevalent 
in the sample. The majority of the sample of veterans with PTSD (64%, n=473) reported 
making violent threats at least once in the past year. Almost half of the sample (49%, n=355)

reported engaging in minor violence (e.g., pushing, shoving, slapping someone). Forty-four 
percent (n=320) engaged in one or more forms of severe violence with 24% (n=177) making 
violent threats with a weapon and 18% (n=131) using a knife or gun. In total, 57% (n=414) 
of the sample reported engaging in either minor or major violence. The majority (74%; 
n=261) of those who engaged in any minor violence also engaged in any major violence.

Half of the sample (50%, n=366) endorsed one or more behaviors indicative of current 
NSSI. Approximately, five percent of the sample (n=36) endorsed self-cutting, 8% (n=55) 
endorsed self-burning, 19% (n=138) endorsed self-hitting, and 40% (n=289) endorsed severe 
scratching or picking at skin. Those who endorsed any NSSI did not differ in age, race, 
service era, SES, or combat exposure from those who did not report NSSI. Veterans with 
PTSD who endorsed NSSI, however, were less likely to be currently married. Reporting 
behaviors representative of NSSI was significantly associated with depression and more 
severe PTSD symptoms (see Table 1).

Of those who engaged in any form of NSSI, 31% (n=112) engaged in multiple NSSI 
behaviors. The most common NSSI behavior, severe scratching or picking at the skin, was 
the behavior most likely to be done in isolation from other NSSI behaviors. Seventy-five 
percent (n=188) of those who reported only one NSSI behavior (n=254) engaged only in 
scratching/picking. In contrast, it was much less common to engage only in cutting (1%, 
n=3), hitting only (18%, n=46) or burning only (7%, n=17). Contrasts comparing veterans 
who endorsed scratching/picking only to veterans that engaged in other forms of NSSI, 
indicated that those engaging in cutting, hitting or burning behaviors had higher PTSD 
symptom severity [mean difference=5.66 (95% CI=0.8-10.45), p<.05], increased depression, 
OR=1.75 (95% CI = 1.12-2.75), and increased odds of being unmarried, OR=1.58 (95% CI 
= 1.05-2.39) but did not differ in term of age, era of service, employment, combat exposure 
or alcohol misuse.

As illustrated in Figure 1, results examining the bivariate association between NSSI and 
violence indicated that veterans who engaged in picking/scratching only were more likely to 
make violent threats than those with no NSSI behaviors. Veterans who engaged in picking/
scratching only were also more likely to report using a weapon than those reporting no NSSI 
in bivariate analyses (see Table 2). As shown in Table 2, NSSI in the form of cutting, hitting, 
or burning was significantly related to all of the violence outcomes in bivariate results.

3.2. Multivariable models of violence

Logistic regression was used to examine the association between NSSI and each violence 
domain after adjusting for dispositional, historical, contextual and clinical factors associated 
with violence including a recent history of difficulty controlling violence. While bivariate 
results indicated that those individuals engaging only in picking/scratching were more likely 
to make violent threats and use a weapon than those reporting no NSSI, there were no 
significant differences between veterans who engaged in picking/scratching only and 
veterans without NSSI in fully adjusted models (see Table 2). In contrast, veterans engaging 
in any cutting, hitting or burning were significantly more likely to make threats, engage in 
minor violence, and engage in severe violence, even after accounting for age, race, marital 
status, unemployment, SES, combat exposure, depression, alcohol misuse, PTSD symptom

severity, and self-reported difficulty controlling violence. NSSI in the form of cutting, hitting 
or burning was related to weapon related violence including making threats with a weapon 
and actual violent acts involving a gun or knife. Patients who reported current NSSI were 
significantly more likely to be categorized as highly violent even after adjusting for other 
demographic and clinical risk factors (see Table 2).

Negative binomial regression and a ZINB model were used to examine the association of 
NSSI with the number of violent acts in the past year. As expected the count of violent acts 
was overdispersed. The mean number of violent acts for the sample was 14.88 (s.d. = 27.49), 
median = 4. The Vuong test comparing the ZINB to the negative binomial model indicated 
that the ZINB model did not significantly improve model fit (z=1.79, n.s.), thus results of the 
negative binomial model are presented. Results are summarized in Table 3. PTSD symptom 
severity and alcohol misuse were each independently associated with increased reports of 
violence in the past year. Not surprisingly, reported difficulty controlling violence in the past 
30 days was a strong indicator of violence. NSSI explained unique variance in the number of 
violent acts in the past year beyond these demographic and clinical risk factors. Veterans 
with PTSD who endorsed any cutting/hitting/burning had an estimated rate of interpersonal 
violence 63% higher than help-seeking veterans with PTSD without NSSI after controlling 
for other dispositional, historical, contextual and clinical factors. Veterans who engaged in 
scratching/picking only did not significantly differ from those with no NSSI in rates of 
violence.

4. Discussion

Consistent with other studies of veterans with PTSD (Calhoun et al., 2002; Elbogen et al., 
2010a; Jakupcak et al., 2007; Wright et al., 2012), high rates of violence were found in the 
current sample. Results are comparable to data collected as part of the National Vietnam 
Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS) which found that Vietnam veterans with PTSD 
reported significantly higher levels of interpersonal violence than era veterans without PTSD 
(McFall et al., 1999). As hypothesized, the current study found that NSSI was uniquely 
associated with violence among help-seeking veterans with PTSD, even after accounting for 
other factors previously demonstrated to be risks for the commission of violence among 
veterans (Elbogen et al., 2010a). Veterans who injured themselves through cutting, hitting, 
or burning were much more likely to engage in interpersonal violence than those without 
NSSI, however, veterans who engaged in picking/scratching only were not at higher risk of 
interpersonal violence than those without any NSSI. To our knowledge, this is the first study 
to examine the connection between NSSI and interpersonal violence in a veteran population. 
Although previous research has demonstrated the importance of NSSI as a behavioral 
marker for suicide risk among veterans (Kimbrel et al., 2016; Kimbrel et al., 2015; Kimbrel 
et al., 2014), results from the current study indicate that NSSI, particularly in the form of 
cutting/hitting/burning may be a significant behavioral marker for increased interpersonal 
violence as well.

Results from the current study are consistent with studies examining the relationship 
between NSSI and interpersonal violence in adolescents (Boxer, 2010; Brunner et al., 2007; 
Sourander et al., 2006; Vivona et al., 1995). Results are also consistent with a study of

al., 2015). NSSI and interpersonal violence may have shared etiologic factors. Decreased 
serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] has been implicated in the pathophysiology of self-
injurious behavior with and without suicidal intent (Crowell et al., 2008; McCloskey et al., 
2009; Steiger et al., 2001). Similarly, lower levels of central 5-HT functioning has been 
posited as a neurochemical basis of human aggression with results of meta-analytic analyses 
of 175 independent samples suggesting a small inverse correlation (r= −.12) between 
measures of central 5-HT functioning and aggression (Duke et al., 2013). Others have 
speculated that dysfunction in the endogenous opioid system (EOS) may underlie self-injury 
and aggressive behavior (Bandelow et al., 2010; Siever, 2008). More research is needed to 
understand the neurobiology of NSSI and interpersonal violence.

4.1. Clinical implications

Current findings have important clinical implications. Routine screening for a wide variety 
of NSSI behaviors, especially in Veteran Health Administration (VHA) psychiatric settings, 
is warranted. Clinicians should be aware that NSSI is prevalent among male help-seeking 
veterans with PTSD regardless of age, race, SES, working status, or combat era. Previous 
studies indicate that NSSI is a robust predictor of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in 
veterans with PTSD (Kimbrel et al., 2016; Kimbrel et al., 2015; Kimbrel et al., 2014). 
Results from the current study indicate that the assessment of NSSI may also help in 
identifying those at highest risk for engaging in interpersonal violence. In particular, it has 
been recommended that clinicians working with veterans systematically examine risk and 
protective factors that have empirical support in order to improve decision-making (Elbogen 
et al., 2010a). As such, the current study attests to the need for clinicians to assess NSSI 
history, and in particular a history of cutting/hitting/burning, when conducting risk 
assessments for violence as well as suicide.

Veterans who reported engaging in NSSI in the past year reported heightened levels of 
PTSD symptoms and depression. More work is needed to examine the functions of NSSI in 
this population. Veterans with PTSD may engage in NSSI in an attempt to cope with severe 
levels of psychological distress. Clinicians working with veterans with PTSD who engage in 
NSSI may consider specifically targeting the reduction of NSSI behaviors. Currently, there 
are few psychological interventions for NSSI that meet the standards for empirically 
supported psychosocial interventions (Stanley et al., 2014). Cognitive and behavioral 
interventions have the most support for efficacy in reducing NSSI (Stanley et al., 2014). 
Interventions that specifically target emotional regulation skills [e.g, (Gratz et al., 2014; 
Linehan, 1993; Ford et al., 2011; Cloitre et al., 2010)] may be particularly useful. However, 
more research aimed at treating NSSI in veterans is clearly needed.

4.2. Limitations

There are a number of important limitations to the current study. First, cross-sectional data 
collection limits the ability to draw conclusions about temporal relationships in the present 
study. Longitudinal research is needed to examine whether NSSI is prospectively predictive 
of interpersonal violence. Given that the sample was limited to male, help-seeking veterans 
with PTSD, results may not generalize to other veterans (e.g., women veterans). While the

clinic from which these data were collected is generally representative of specialty PTSD 
clinics within the VHA, results may not generalize to all veterans with PTSD. More work 
examining interpersonal violence and NSSI in more diverse samples of veterans is needed. 
While the HQ has been used in several studies to examine NSSI (Kimbrel et al., 2014; Sacks 
et al., 2008; Weaver et al., 2004); it only contains four items traditionally considered as 
NSSI. The HQ is also limited in that the assessment of antecedents and consequences of 
engaging in NSSI is limited to the most recent episode. Thus, it may be difficult to know 
whether engaging in a certain NSSI behavior was the product of intentional self-harm or a 
byproduct of reflexive distress-related behaviors, e.g., picking/scratching of the skin as a 
manifestation of anxiety. Future studies that use measures that assess a broader array of 
NSSI behaviors [e.g., the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory; (Gratz, 2001)] in veterans are also 
needed. Finally, the sample size and relatively low-base rate of certain forms of NSSI, 
precluded an examination of individual NSSI behaviors. Studies of latent classes of NSSI 
have indicated that there may be classes of individuals who prefer one type or types of NSSI 
over others (Klonsky & Olino, 2008; Kleiman et al., 2015). More work is needed to examine 
the reliability of subtypes of self-injurers and the predictive validity of subtypes for specific 
risk-factors such as interpersonal violence.

4.3. Conclusion

Despite these limitations, the present study demonstrates that engaging in NSSI in the form 
of cutting, hitting or burning is significantly associated with increased interpersonal violence 
among help-seeking veterans with PTSD. NSSI explained unique variance in interpersonal 
violence beyond well-known clinical and demographic risk factors. Although additional 
research is needed to replicate these findings in other clinical samples, results suggest 
clinicians working with veterans with PTSD should consider assessment of NSSI as part of a 
comprehensive approach to risk assessment.

Highlights

Veterans with PTSD are at increased risk for engaging in other-directed 
violence.

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a form of self-directed violence.

This study examined NSSI and interpersonal violence in 729 veterans 
with PTSD.

NSSI in the form of cutting, hitting or burning oneself predicted 
violence after accounting for well-known violence risk factors.

Clinicians should assess NSSI when conducting risk assessments for 
violence as well as suicide.
