Abstract
Sleep problems are widely prevalent and associated with various comorbidities including anxiety. Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.)
is a popular herbal medicine used as a sleep aid, however the outcomes of previous clinical studies are inconsistent. This study was
conducted to update and re-evaluate the available data in order to understand the reason behind the inconsistent outcomes
and to provide a broader view of the use of valerian for associated disorders. PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library
were searched to retrieve publications relevant to the effectiveness of valerian as a treatment of sleep problems and associated
disorders. A total of 60 studies (n¼6,894) were included in this review, and meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the
effectiveness to improve subjective sleep quality (10 studies, n¼1,065) and to reduce anxiety (8 studies, n¼535). Results sug-
gested that inconsistent outcomes were possibly due to the variable quality of herbal extracts and that more reliable effects could
be expected from the whole root/rhizome. In addition, therapeutic benefits could be optimized when it was combined with
appropriate herbal partners. There were no severe adverse events associated with valerian intake in subjects aged between 7 and
80 years. In conclusion, valerian could be a safe and effective herb to promote sleep and prevent associated disorders.
However, due to the presence of multiple active constituents and relatively unstable nature of some of the active constituents,
it may be necessary to revise the quality control processes, including standardization methods and shelf life.

Introduction
Sleep Problems

Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining brain functions and
systemic physiology, and chronic sleep problems could have a
significant impact on our health.1,2 Insufficient sleep leads to
reduced stress resilience, decreased quality of life, mood dis-
orders, and cognitive, memory, and performance deficits.3
It can also contribute to metabolic disorders including hyper-
tension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 dia-
betes mellitus.2,4 In addition, it is associated with significantly
increased dementia risk.5,6 Problems with sleep are widely pre-
valent,4 affecting 70 million (9-20%) of adults in the US and
45 million (7%) of adults in Europe.7,8 Typical manifestation of
sleep disorders include sleep deprivation or fragmentation and
events that occur during sleep.4 The major sleep disorders are
insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS),9 obstructive sleep
apnea syndrome, and narcolepsy,10,11 among which insomnia

is the most common.12 Sedative-hypnotic medications com-
monly prescribed for insomnia are g-aminobutyric acid type
A (GABAA) receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihista-
mines.13 However, the long term use of most sedative-hypnotic
drugs is limited due to various side effects, such as cognitive
and daytime performance impairments.14 In recent years,

herbal supplements, such as valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.),
sour jujube seeds (Ziziphus jujuba Miller var. spinosa Hu ex H.
F. Chou), and kava (Piper methysticum G.Forst.), have gained
popularity as alternatives to prescription drugs to improve sleep
quality without side effects.15

Valerian for Sleep Problems and Associated Disorders

Recorded medicinal use of valerian dates back to the first cen-
tury AD. In recent years, it is popular as a sedative and hypno-
tic. Historically, however, its metabolic stimulating features
such as diuretic, carminative, and menstrual stimulant proper-
ties had been more valued.16 It was in the middle ages that the
use of valerian in treating nervous disorders and insomnia was
recorded.16,17 There are over 200 valerian species worldwide,
including V. wallichii DC., V. edulis Nutt., and V. fauriei Briq.,
among which Valeriana officinalis L. is the most well known in
Europe and North America as “valerian.” In the United States,
valerian is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a dietary supplement (https://ods.od.nih.gov/fact
sheets/Valerian-HealthProfessional/). According to the
European Medicine Agency (EMA), the well-established uses
of V. officinalis root include the relief of mild nervous tension
as well as sleep disorders. For relief of nervous tension, rec-
ommended oral dosages are 400-600 mg dry hydroalcoholic
extract or comminuted herbal substance (root) 0.3-3 g up to
3 times daily.18 Valerian is considered relatively safe and
well-tolerated, however EMA monograph notes gastrointest-
inal symptoms (e.g. nausea, abdominal cramps) as undesirable
effects. Although hydroalcoholic extracts of valerian root in the
recommended dosage improve sleep latency and quality, it is
uncertain what constituents contribute to the efficacy.18

The effectiveness of valerian as a sleep aid has been the
major research focus, and several systematic reviews were
conducted previously. A systematic review published in
2000, which analyzed 9 randomized clinical trials, found con-
tradictory results and significant inconsistency in terms of
patients, experimental design and methodology among the
trials.19 Another systematic review and meta-analysis, pub-
lished in 2006, analyzed 16 studies and this study also found
significant methodological problems.20 Taibi et al. (2007) con-
ducted a systematic review on 37 studies, of which 29 were
controlled trials and 8 were open-label trials. They concluded
that, although it is a safe herb, evidence did not support the
clinical efficacy of valerian as a sleep aid for insomnia.21
A meta-analysis of 18 randomized placebo-controlled trials,
published in 2010, concluded that valerian’s effectiveness had
not been demonstrated with quantitative or objective measures
although valerian could improve subjective sleep quality.22 So
far, these inconsistent outcomes have not been fully explained.
In addition, it is not clear if valerian is effective in treating
other disorders associated with, and possibly contributing to,
sleep problems. The aim of the current study is to up-date the
available data, to evaluate the effectiveness of valerian as a
treatment of sleep problems and associated disorders, and to
discuss possible reasons behind the inconsistent research

outcomes, by particularly focusing on the herbal preparations
used in the studies.

Summary

In summary, this study will focus on:

(cid:2) The herbal materials – extracts or whole root/rhizomes –

that have been used in trials.

(cid:2) Potential applications of valerian, including but looking

beyond its use for sleep problems.

(cid:2) Popular and effective herbal combinations.

Methods

In order to evaluate the therapeutic effects of valerian, systematic
reviews and meta-analyses were conducted following PRISMA guide-
lines.23 Searches A-C were conducted using PubMed (https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), ScienceDirect (https://www.science
direct.com/search/advanced), and Cochrane Library (https://www.co
chranelibrary.com/search).

Search Strategy

Search A:

Clinical studies on valerian, published between January 1980 and
November 2019, were retrieved using search term “Valeriana” in
PubMed database under article type: Clinical Trial.

Search B:
ScienceDirect advanced search was conducted using search term
“Valeriana clinical trial.” Articles published between January 2000
and November 2019 were sought.

Search C:
To identify clinical trials using valerian, the Cochrane Library was
searched (up to December 2019) using the search term ‘Valeriana
officinalis’.

Study Selection

Studies were screened initially for relevance based on the title and
abstract. Reviews, unrelated studies, and works without available full
text were excluded. Studies evaluated the effectiveness of valerian
alone or in combination on sleep or related health problems were
considered relevant. The full texts of potential studies were assessed
following the exclusion and listed below.

Exclusion criteria

1. Articles published in any non-English language.
2. Studies using unknown substance.
3. Studies on non-human subjects.

The quality of randomized trials were assessed using Jadad
scale.24 In order to extensively collect currently available infor-
mation, both controlled trials and observational studies were
included for reviewing, irrespective of potential risk of bias
(Figure 1).

Meta-Analysis

The effectiveness of V. officinalis in promoting sleep and reducing
anxiety were evaluated by meta-analyses. Due to the scarcity of data,
all placebo-controlled studies reporting values that are convertible to
effect sizes were included for statistical analysis, irrespective of trials’
quality (Jadad scale). The outcome variables were extracted from
V. officinalis treatment group and placebo group by 1 author, which
was checked by 2 authors. In order to evaluate the effectiveness as a
sleep aid, data on subjective ‘sleep quality’ improvement by repeated
administration (ranging between 5 days to 8 weeks) were included in
the analysis. Due to the variable measures, both numerical scores and
binary scores were converted to effect sizes for the analysis.25 To
evaluate the anxiolytic effect, a study reporting the overall emotional
symptoms including anxiety and a study reporting binary outcomes, in
addition to the studies reporting standard anxiety test scores, were
included. When several measures were reported over time in the same
study, the one with the longest follow-up period was selected. When
more than 1 dose were tested, the result of the most effective dose was
selected. Adjusted effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were calculated from sum-
mary measures such as means and standard deviations or confidence
intervals, odds ratio (for binary outcomes), and sample sizes, using
reported formula.25-27 Meta-analyses were performed using
Meta-Essentials.28 I2 statistic was used to estimate heterogeneity. Pub-
lication bias was evaluated using the funnel plots.29

Results

Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria described above,
a total of 60 articles were selected for reviewing (Table 1 and
2). Both quantitative and qualitative studies with human sub-
jects were included. Of 40 articles using valerian as a single
herb, 36 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT)30-65
and 2 studies were observational.66,67 Two studies addressed
the potential induction of liver enzyme cytochrome P450
(CYP) isoforms.68,69 In addition, 2 RCTs were conducted using
valepotriates (80% didrovaltrate, 15% valtrate, and 5% aceval-
trate)70,71 (Table 1). Nineteen articles assessed the effective-
ness of herbal combinations, of which 13 studies were
RCT65,72,73-80,81-83 and 6 were observational studies84-89 (Table
2).

V. Officinalis as a Single Herb

Sleep problems. To evaluate the effectiveness of valerian for
sleep problems, 40 articles using V. officinalis as a single herb
were assessed. As a result, it was found that 23 studies
addressed the effectiveness of valerian for sleep problems.
Among them, 13 studies found valerian effective as a sleep aid.
Three studies were performed with healthy subjects,37,40,41
4 studies with insomnia patients,36,42,52,66 and 1 study in RLS
patients.30 In addition, studies conducted with mental health
patients,67 cancer patients,56 HIV-positive patients,35 postme-
nopausal women,57 and the elderly,38 also found that valerian
could improve sleep quality.35,38,56,57 On the other hand,
10 studies found that valerian was not significantly effective
compared to control36,38,40,48,50,51,53,54,56,65 at least for the out-
come measures used in those studies. Study outcomes were

assessed using various measures, such as sleep questionnaires
and diaries, such as Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory
(PSQI),90 Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),91 and Epworth Slee-
piness Scale (ESS), to polysomnography.92

Six studies measured immediate responses after single dose
administration,36,38,40-42,50 while most studies evaluated the
effectiveness of repeated doses.30,35,54,56,57,65,67,36-38,44,48,51-53
The intervention periods ranged from 5 days to 8 weeks.

using

studies

In order to extract possible associations between herbal
preparations and study outcomes, the reports were classified
into 4 groups (Table 1): 8 studies using hydroalcoholic
extracts,36,42,44,50,52-54,65
aqueous
3
extracts,38,40,41 3 studies using extracts using unspecified sol-
vents,37,48,51 and 5 studies using herbal substance (the whole
root / rhizome).30,35,56,57,67 Among the 3 studies using aqueous
extracts, 2 studies with single dose found improved subjective
sleep quality and latency in healthy volunteers40,41 (RCTs
[Jadad scale 2 and 5]), while there was no significant difference
in polysomnography40 (RCTs [Jadad scale 2]). Schulz et al.
found that repeated administration of V. officinalis aqueous
extract (for 1 week) increased deep sleep (slow-wave sleep:
SWS) in elderly subjects, although single dose of the same
preparation did not have any significant impact on polysomno-
graphy38 (RCT [Jadad scale 2]). As a single dose, V. officinalis
hydroalcoholic extracts did not improve sleep quality36,50
(RCT, Jadad scale 2-3), however improved REM sleep
was observed in insomnia patients42 (RCT [Jadad scale 2]).
Repeated administration of hydroalcoholic extracts also led
to inconsistent outcomes: sleep quality was improved in 4 stud-
ies using extract 600 mg (2 to 6 weeks)36,37,44,52 (RCTs [Jadad
scale 2-5]), whereas 3 studies using extract 300-600 mg (5 days
to 4 weeks) found no improvement53,54,65 (RCTs [Jadad
scale 3-5]). Donath et al. found improved sleep latency and
deep sleep after 2 weeks, while no improvement was observed
after a single dose36 (RCTs [Jadad scale 2]), which suggests
that repeated administration is needed to exert observable
effects. There were 3 studies using extracts with unspecified
procedures.48,51,66 The outcomes from those studies were also
inconsistent: negative outcomes for 2 studies48,51 (RCTs [Jadad
scale 5]) and positive for an observational study.66 On the other
hand, all 5 studies using the dried root/rhizome showed that the
interventions led to improved sleep at least in 1 sub-
group30,35,56,57,67 (RCTs [Jadad 3-5] and 1 observational
study), suggesting that maximum efficacy could be expected
from the root / rhizome before extraction.

It has been suggested that valerian may be useful to improve
subjective sleep quality22 and that repeated administration is
required to obtain significant effects.36 In order to evaluate if
repeated administrations could consistently improve sleep
quality, a meta-analysis was carried out (Figure 2). Studies
using repeated valerian administrations were assessed to
extract numerical values for the meta-analysis, and 10 rando-
mized placebo-controlled trials reporting quantifiable
results30,34-36,51-54,56,57 were included in the analysis. The com-
bined effect size was 0.36 (95% CI: -0.08 to 0.81) (Figure 2A).
The funnel plot indicated missing data (Figure 2B) and high

heterogeneity was observed (I2¼85.33%). As described above,
differences in herbal preparation could potentially contribute
to the heterogenous outcomes. In fact, subgroup analysis for
the whole root30,35,56,57 (RCTs [Jadad 3-5]) and the
extract34,36,51-54 (RCTs [Jadad 2-5]) revealed that the combined
effect size for the whole root was considerably higher 0.83
(95% CI: 0.03 to 1.62), compared to the extract (0.10; 95%
CI: -0.02 to 0.22) (Figure 3), further supporting the use of the
whole root rather than extract.

Anxiety. Anxiety was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Rating
Scale (HAM-A): a clinician-rated scale that considers psycho-
logical and somatic factors,93,94 State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(STAI): a patient-rated scale that measures state and trait anxi-
ety,95,96 mental stress test using the color/word interference
task,97 or other questionnaires. Seven studies examined valer-
ian’s anxiolytic potential, and positive outcomes were observed
in 6 studies.33,35,43,60,63,71 Valerian standardized extract 600
mg per day for 1 week reduced psychological and physiological
stress reactivity under stress in healthy adult subjects43 (RCT
[Jadad scale 1]). Average 81.3 mg per day of valepotriates for
4 weeks reduced the score of HAM-A in generalized anxiety
disorder patients71 (RCT [Jadad scale 5]), suggesting that vale-
potriates are the active anxiolytic constituents. Valerian root /
rhizome 530 mg per day for 4 weeks reduced anxiety in
HIV-positive patients receiving efavirenz35 (RCT [Jadad
scale 3]), suggesting valerian could prevent neuropsychiatric
adverse effects caused by the antiretroviral medication. Valer-
ian extract 100 mg33 or root / rhizome 100 mg,60 single dose
60 min before the initiation of surgical operation, reduced

anxiety in anxious patients undergoing dental operation33,60
(RCTs [Jadad scale 5]). In addition, valerian extract
1,260 mg per day for 7 days for 3 menstrual cycles effectively
reduced premenstrual anxiety63 (RCT [Jadad scale 5]). How-
ever, an internet-based study with volunteers with non-clinical
anxiety and insomnia found no significant difference in STAI
compared to placebo51 (RCT [Jadad scale 5]). Figure 4 shows
the result of meta-analysis for valerian’s anxiolytic effects
based on 7 randomized placebo-controlled trials that reported
quantitative outcomes34,35,47,49,51,60,63 (Figure 4A). The funnel
plot indicated significant publication bias, missing data in the
area of negative outcome, and high heterogeneity (I2¼93.13%)
(Figure 4B). Subgroup analysis revealed high variability for
valerian extracts34,47,49,51,63 (RCTs [Jadad scale 3-5]), whereas
positive outcomes were observed for the whole root35,60 (RCTs
[Jadad scale 3 and 5]). However, due to the scarcity of data
(2 studies for the whole root), it is difficult to draw a conclusion.
Two studies investigated the effects of V. officinalis extracts
on anxiety-associated brain activities.31,34 Single dose of
300 mg extract reduced intracortical facilitation, possibly via
GABAA enhancement31 (RCT [Jadad scale 4]), and hydroalco-
holic extract 300 mg per day for 4 weeks increased frontal brain
region alpha coherence, which was correlated with anxiolysis34
(RCT [Jadad scale 5]). These findings suggest that V. officinalis
could induce immediate as well as long-lasting effects on
anxiety-associated brain activities.

Other therapeutic effects. In addition to insomnia and anxiety,
several other therapeutic benefits were suggested (Figure 5).
Valerian aqueous extract 750 mg per day for 8 weeks was

effective in reducing the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD)55 (RCT [Jadad scale 2]). Valerian root / rhi-
zome 530 mg per day for 1 month improved cognition in hae-
modialysis patients32 (RCT [Jadad scale 2]), and valerian root /
rhizome 1,060 mg per day for 8 weeks prevented cognitive
dysfunction after coronary bypass surgery61 (RCT [Jadad scale
5]). Valerian root / rhizome 675 mg or extract 1,060 mg per day
for 8 weeks reduced severity and frequency of hot flashes in
menopausal and postmenopausal women59,64 (RCTs [Jadad
scale 4]). In addition, valerian root / rhizome 765 mg per day
for 3 days for 2 cycles reduced pain severity and syncope in
young females with dysmenorrhea58 (RCT [Jadad scale 5]),
and valerian extract 1,260 mg for 7 days for 3 cycles reduced

premenstrual symptoms63, supporting the traditional use of
valerian as a menstrual stimulant.16

Other Valerian Species

Three studies investigated the effectiveness of other Valeriana
spp. as a sleep aid: 2 studies on V. edulis42,46 and 1 study on V.
wallichii.70 V. edulis 20 mg/kg for 2 weeks reduced sleep laten-
cies and improved sleep quality in children with intellectual
deficit and primary sleep problems46 (RCT [Jadad scale 5]),
and V. edulis hydroalcoholic extract 450 mg single dose
increased REM sleep and reduced the number of awaking in
insomnia patients42 (RCT [Jadad scale 5]). A concoction of

valepotriates from V. wallichii 300 mg per day for 15 days
reduced Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO) and improved
sleep quality in insomnia patients70 (RCT [Jadad scale 3]). Of
note, chemical characteristics of the 3 species (V. officinalis,
V. edulis, and V. wallichi) significantly differ; valerenic acids
(valerenic acid, acetoxyvalerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid)
are specific to V. officinalis, whereas valepotriates (valtrate and
isovaltrate) are common among the 3 species,98 suggesting that
valepotriates at least in part contribute to valerian’s sleep pro-
moting activity. Due to the scarcity of data, it was not possible
to perform meta-analysis for V. edulis and V. wallichi.

Valerian in Herbal Combinations

In addition to the effectiveness of valerian alone, 19 studies
evaluated the effectiveness of valerian in combination with other
herbs or other agents, among which 16 studies used
V. officinalis,65,72,82-86,88,89,73-80 2 studies used V. wallichii,81,87
and 1 study used an unknown valerian species.76 One study
treated menopausal women with valerian essence in combina-
tion with lemon balm and observed sleep improvement, however
the species and extraction methods were unidentified.76

Among 16 reports using herbal combinations with V. offic-
inals, 8 studies examined the effects on sleep quality and/or
latency and all those interventions led to positive out-
comes.65,72,75,79,83,86,88,89 Six studies evaluated anxiolytic
potential, and all those studies found positive outcomes at least
for one of the measures at one of the tested dosages73,77,78,85,86,88
(RCTs [Jadad scale 3-5] and 3 observational studies). However,
a study using the combination of V. officinals, Passiflora

incarnata (syn. P. edulis), and Melissa officinalis extracts (sin-
gle dose) found that the intervention attenuated anxiety under
stress, although it did not alter the level of salivary cortisol, a
physiological parameter of stress reactions77 (RCT [Jadad
scale 5]). In another study, V. officinalis and M. officinalis
combination (extract weight ratio 3:2) at 1,800 mg (single
dose) increased anxiety while the same formulation at 600
mg reduced anxiety78 (RCT [Jadad scale 3]). Both of these
negative outcomes were observed for single doses in healthy
subjects. On the other hand, the other 4 studies, conducted
with subjects with adjustment insomnia,88 somatoform dis-
order patients73 (RCT [Jadad scale 4]), depression patients85
(observational), and children with affective disorders86
(observational), found that the herbal combinations with V.
officinalis were effective in reducing anxiety. Of note, when
depression patients were treated with V. officinalis (500 or
1,000 mg extract) and Hypericum perforatum (600 mg
extract) for 6 weeks, higher valerian dose (1,000 mg)
reduced anxiety more effectively85 (observational). In addi-
tion, a study found that a combination of V. officinalis and
M. officinalis extracts was effective in reducing the symp-
toms in children with hyperactivity and concentration diffi-
culties84 (observational). In a study with Intensive Care Unit
(ICU) patients, V. officinalis essential oil combined with
acupressure effectively induced relaxation and improved
sleep74 (observational). V. wallichii with 8 ayurvedic herbs
improved sleep in sleep onset insomnia patients81 (RCT
[Jadad scale 4]), and V. wallichii with milk improved sleep
in primary insomnia patients87 (observational).

With respect to the potential herbal partners of V. officinalis,
Humulus lupulus was the most frequently used in the clinical
trials. All 7 reports that examined the effects on sleep or asso-
ciated parameters observed sleep improvement65,72,79,83 (RCTs
[Jadad scale 2-3]), EEG power alteration toward sleep82 (RCT
[Jadad scale 2]), and reduced arousal80 (RCT [Jadad scale 3])
were observed. M. officinalis used in 5 trials,73,77,78,84,89 was

the second most frequently combined herb, followed by
P. incarnata used in 4 trials.73,75,77,86 The 2 herbs were used
in combination with V. officinalis for sleep problems and anxi-
ety, resulting in positive outcomes.73,75,77,78,84,86,89 Two stud-
ies were conducted on the combination of V. officinalis and
H. perforatum with depression patients85 (observational) and
children with affective disorders86 (observational), and the

intervention reduced anxiety,85,86 improved sleep,86 and
reduced depression symptoms.85 Two studies used M. officina-
lis and P. incarnata73,77 (RCTs [Jadad scale 4-5]), and 1 study
used H. lupulus and P. incarnata75 (RCT [Jadad scale 4]) in
combination with V. officinalis. These 4 frequently used herbal
partners and the study outcomes are summarized in Figure 6. It
was not possible to perform meta-analysis for herbal combina-
tions due to the highly variable outcome measures.

Safety

There were no serious adverse events reported in the studies
included in this review (60 studies, total n¼6,894). Paradoxical
stimulation,16,99 such as agitation and restlessness, was expe-
rienced only in minority.30,78,86 In older women with insomnia,
valerian extract increased WASO,53 suggesting it could have
stimulatory effects. However, a study found that the same for-
mulation at a higher dose increased anxiety while a lower dose
was anxiolytic,78 suggesting that paradoxical stimulation could
be avoided by cautious dosing. Six studies investigated possi-
ble adverse effects on cognitive performance after V. officinalis
extract intake (single dose) in healthy adults37,39,47,49,62 and
elderly volunteers.45 V. officinalis standardized extracts at
100-1,600 mg did not impair cognitive or psychomotor perfor-
mance37,39,45,47,49,62 and were proven safer compared to triazo-
lam, temazepam (benzodiazepines), and diphenhydramine
(antihistamine).45,47 Valerian did not cause any adverse events
in postmenopausal women with insomnia,57 older women with
insomnia,53 children with intellectual deficits and primary

sleep problems,46 and psychophysiological
insomnia
patients.36 Mild adverse events were reported in RLS patients
(vivid dreams and fatigue),30 arthritis patients with sleep
disturbance (dizziness and sleepiness),54 sleep-disturbed sub-
jects (drowsiness),50 insomnia patients (gastrointestinal symp-
toms),42,70 and outpatients with stress-induced insomnia (vivid
dreams, drowsiness, heavy dream and depression),66 however
there was no clear association with the treatments. Potential
herb-drug interaction was addressed by examining the effects
on cytochrome p450 (CYP) expression levels, and no signifi-
cant impact was detected at least for CYP1A2, CYP2D6,
CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5.69,68 As a whole, valerian is safe in
all ages.

Discussion

Concurring sleep problems and anxiety are frequently observed
and their onset and course are interrelated.100,101 In addition,
these disorders are associated with a number of comorbid con-
ditions including depression,101-103 dementia,5,6 OCD,104 and
hot flashes105-107 (Figure 6). Our results demonstrated that
sleep promotion and anxiolytic effects were the major thera-
peutic benefits expected of valerian (V. officinalis), and this
herb could be also useful in treating OCD, cognitive dysfunc-
tion, menopausal hot flashes, as well as menstrual problems.
However, the study outcomes considerably differed particu-
larly when herbal extracts were used. We address this issue
by discussing potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic
actions of valerian.

Key Constituents and Mechanisms of Actions

Although the use of valerian extracts as a sedative and sleep aid
dates back to the 18th century and a number of constituents
have been identified in the last 120 years,108 the active consti-
tuents and underlying mechanisms for the reported activities
remain obscure.109 The identified constituents include iridoids
known as valepotriates (valtrate, isovaltrate, didrovaltrate
and acevaltrate),110 essential oil constituents including mono-
terpenes (e.g. borneol, bornyl acetate), sesquiterpenes
(e.g. valerenal, valerenic acid), and carboxylic compounds
(valeric / isovaleric acid),111 lignans,112 flavonoids,108,113 and
low levels of g-aminobutyric acid (GABA).114 Valeriana
edulis (Mexican valerian) Valeriana wallichii (Indian valerian)
contain higher levels of iridoids, while valerenic acid and acet-
oxyvalerenic acid are unique to V. officinalis.98

Valerian and GABAergic Signaling

GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central
nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the
treatment of anxiety and sleep disorders.115,116 GABA is pres-
ent in the central nervous system (CNS), where it plays a role in
the maintenance of balance between excitatory and inhibitory
neurotransmissions. GABA acts via 3 subclasses of receptors
termed GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC, each of which has
distinct characteristics. GABAA and GABAC receptors are
ligand-gated ion channels, while GABAB members are
G-protein coupled receptors. GABAA receptors are heteropen-
tameric transmembrane protein complexes made up of a1-6,
b1-3, g1-3, d, E, y, p subunits, and have numerous allosteric
binding sites.116 Although it is not very likely that GABA in
valerian, taken orally, directly exerts any therapeutic action,
valerenic acid and valerenol can allosterically modulate
GABAA receptors to enhance the response of GABAA to
GABA in vitro,117-119 and both valerenic acid and valerenol

exerted anxiolytic activity in a GABAA b3 subunit-dependent
manner in mice.117 On the other hand, valerenic acid deriva-
tives (e.g. acetoxy valerenic acid and hydroxy valerenic acid)
bind the identical sites without inducing allosteric modulation,
suggesting that these constituents can potentially compete with
valerenic acid.120 In fact, in an anxiety model in rodents, a
valerian extract containing valerenic acid at a high level and
acetoxy valerenic acid at a low level exhibited higher anxioly-
tic potency compared to an extract with acetoxy valerenic at a
high level, indicating that standardization with respect to the
total amount of valerenic acids (both valerenic acid and acet-
oxy valerenic acid) is inappropriate.120 In addition, an aqueous
extract of valerian induced GABA release in rat brain synapto-
somes in vitro,121 suggesting the presence of hydrophilic con-
stituents potentially promotes GABAergic signaling. Expected
mechanisms of actions are summarized in Figure 5. Of note, the
expression patterns of GABA receptors in humans are sex- and
age-dependent, and GABAA b3 subunit levels in the superior
temporal gyrus were lower in older women than old men,122
suggesting that valerian’s actions via GABAergic signaling
could depend on the sex and age.

Valerian and Serotonergic Signaling

Serotonin (5-HT) plays essential roles in the regulation of sleep
and mood, and serotonergic system is a promising therapeutic
target for psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression,
and sleep disorders.123-126 Both valerian extract and valerenic
acid exhibit partial agonist activity at 5-HT receptor 5A
(5-HT5A) in vitro,127 suggesting the involvement of serotonergic
system in the actions of valerian. There are 7 families of its
receptors (5-HT1-7). Although the functional significance of
5-HT5A remains obscure, 5-HT5A is present at high levels in the
regions that regulate circadian rhythms (the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet,128,129 the median raphe

24

Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine

nuclei, and dorsal raphe nucleus) and colocalized with seroto-
nin, suggesting the auto-receptor role of 5-HT5A in circadian
regulation.128 In addition, 5-HT5A is expressed in the brain areas
such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and
hypothalamus,129 suggesting that it is potentially involved in
stress reactivity and resilience. Indeed, a study demonstrated
that 5-HT5A antagonists could have different sedative, anxioly-
tic, and anti-depressant properties130 (Figure 6). These data sug-
gest that valerian, as a 5-HT5A partial agonist, may act
differently depending on what circumstances the subjects were
placed and this could possibly explain the inconsistent outcomes
among the trials.

Valerian and Adenosine Signaling

Adenosine receptors play important roles in mood and anxiety
disorders.131 Adenosine A1 receptor activation reduces
anxiety-like behavior in mice132 and positive allosteric modu-
lators of adenosine A1 receptor could be potential anxiolytic
therapy.133,134 In addition, adenosine helps maintain brain
homeostasis by preventing over excitation and regulating the
sleep-wake rhythm.135-137 Sleep stages are divided into 1 stage
of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and 4 stages of non-rapid
eye movement (NREM) sleep (Stages 1-4) that are character-
ized by increasing sleep depth.4,138 The deeper stages (Stages 3
and 4) are believed to be the most restorative and collectively
called SWS.4,138 Adenosine acting through A1 receptors facil-
itates sleep and increases slow wave activity (SWA) in SWS,
whereas A1 receptor antagonism suppresses SWA.139 Impor-
tantly, 2 studies found that V. officinalis could increase
SWS,36,38 possibly contributing to the improved subjective
sleep quality while objective sleep latency remained
unchanged.36 These observations suggest that valerian may
promote the sleep quality by inducing deep sleep via adenosine
A1 receptor signaling. In fact, a polar extract of valerian exhib-
ited partial agonistic activity at A1 receptors140 and valerian
contains hydrophilic constituents that interact with adenosine
signaling, such as lignans of a olivil derivatives that is a partial
agonist of adenosine A1 receptors.112,141 Thus, valerian’s
hydrophilic constituents could exert the anxiolytic and
sleep-inducing effects via adenosine signaling. Importantly,
while the hydrophilic extract was agonistic, isovaltrate in the
hydrophobic extract acted as an inverse agonist at adenosine A1
receptor.140 These findings indicate the hydrophilic and hydro-
phobic components of valerian act in opposite directions at
adenosine receptors,140 supporting the traditional use of
water-based extract as a sleep aid,16,140 and possibly explaining
the contradictory findings regarding the efficacy of valerian
hydroalcoholic extracts.

Valepotriates

Valepotriates are unstable thermolabile compounds that rapidly
decompose. The characteristic odor of dried valerian is due to
isovaleric acid released from decomposing valepotriates.142
Although the mechanistic roles of valepotriates in the

exert

anxiolytic143

that valepotriates

therapeutic effects are yet to be clarified, pre-clinical evidence
and
suggests
antidepressant-like effects,144,145 possibly via the dopaminergic
and noradrenergic neurotransmission but not via the serotoner-
gic system.145 The monoaminergic neurotransmitters (dopa-
mine, noradrenaline, and 5-HT) play overlapping roles in the
etiology of anxiety and depression, and medications targeting
these systems are proved to be effective in treating both anxiety
and depression.146 Moreover, those monoamines play a role in
sleep-wake regulation.147 Thus, the presence of valepotriates is
likely to be essential in treating these disorders. In addition,
valtrate reduced the serum glucocorticoid level in a rat anxiety
model,148 suggesting hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis mod-
ulatory potential of valepotriates. Considering the significant
association between neuroendocrine-immune axis imbalance
and stress vulnerability and resilience,149 the potential impact
on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is particularly
important. Stress can disturb the sleep, and stress reactivity is
implicated in vulnerability to insomnia and other stress-related
disorders such as anxiety and depression.8,150 Furthermore, glu-
cocorticoid imbalance could lead to amyloid formation and tau
accumulation, hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease,151 and ele-
vated glucocorticoid levels are associated with neurodegenera-
tive disorders.152 Thus, valepotriates may prevent
stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and
depression, as well as cognitive dysfunction, by restoring
endocrine-immune balance. Expected mechanisms of action are
summarized in Figure 6.

Quality and Shelf Life

As described above, multiple constituents, including valerenic
acids, lignan, and valepotriates, differentially contribute to the
therapeutic effectiveness of valerian. However, most of the
commercially available valerian extracts are standardized to
the levels of valerenic acids, while the contents of valepotriates
are often unknown. Importantly, Bos et al. compared freshly
prepared tincture (70% EtOH extract) and the same extract
stored at room temperature for 2 months, and found that the
levels of valepotriates (valtrate and isovaltrate) after 2 months
were less than 5% of the original, whereas the levels of valere-
nic acids (valerenic acid and acetoxyvalerenic acid) were not
affected.98 This finding suggests that the shelf life of valerian
extracts may be significantly shorter if the levels of valepotri-
ates are considered. It is possible that the negative outcomes
observed in the trials using valerian extracts, rather than the
raw materials, could have been caused by the loss of valepotri-
ates in those extracts.

In the United States, valerian-containing products are
widely available as dietary supplements, in various forms under
various trade names. Examples are Valerian (NOW FOODS,
IL, US; Nature’s Way, WI, USA), Standardized Valerian (root
extract standardized to 0.8% valerenic acids; Nature’s Way),
and Amantilla (hydroalcoholic extract; NutraMedix, FL, USA),
to name a few. In Europe, the Committee on Herbal Medicine
Products (HMPC) concluded that valerian-containing

medicinal products have to be assessed by the responsible
national authorities. Available products include Baldrian
(85% ethanol extract; Kneipp, Wu¨ rzburg, Germany), and
Baldrianwurzel (70% ethanol extract; Hofapotheke St. Afra,
Augsburg, Germany). Herbal combinations are also available
(e.g. Valeirana-Melissa extract [standardized to 0.8% valerenic
acids; Bonusan, Rotterdam, Netherlands]). Of note, the recom-
mended storage temperatures for most of these products are at
or below room temperature (around 25(cid:4)C).

health problems could be diverse depending on age, sex, and
general health conditions. Consequently, there could be
potential differences in the outcomes depending on the target
populations, however such possibilities were not addressed in
this review. In addition, heterogeneity in the outcome mea-
sures limited the number of data sources for meta-analysis,
which in turn limits the generalizability of the results. Further
research is needed to assess the effectiveness for specific
populations and outcomes.

Limitation

Conclusion

The current study has reviewed the effectiveness of valerian
without specifying target populations. This raises a limitation
as the etiology underlying sleep problems and associated

According to the 1905 edition of King’s American dispensa-
tory,99 ‘valerian excites the cerebro-spinal system.’ and ‘in
medicinal doses it acts as a stimulant-tonic, . . . ’, which

26

suggests that valerian is not a simple hypnotic or anxiolytic
agent. In addition, the text continues that ‘The extract of valer-
ian is worthless, but the fluid extract has been found to possess
all the medicinal virtues of the root’,99 suggesting that extrac-
tion methods could play a crucial role in preserving the ther-
apeutic potency. Valerian has diverse chemical properties. As
summarized in Table 3, the differences in polarity can lead to
variability in the quality of valerian extracts depending on the
extraction solvents. Our study has found that the hydroalco-
holic extracts used in the clinical trials are variable with respect
to the solvents (Table 4), and their phytochemical properties
are not characterized in most cases. Furthermore, there is no
information regarding the storage conditions such as tempera-
ture and storage period. Considering the low stability of some
of the important active constituents,98,142 it is unknown to what
extent the active constituents had been preserved at the end of
those trials. The absence of such information limits the discus-
sion as to why some extracts were ineffective while others
exhibited effectiveness in those clinical trials. Due to the mul-
tiple active constituents and complex mechanisms of actions
(Figure 5), it is imperative to use well characterized plant
materials and extracts in the future clinical trials, in order for
the evaluation of valerian’s true effectiveness to be possible.

This study demonstrated that valerian could be a safe and
useful herb alone and also in combination in treating sleep
problems, anxiety, and associated comorbidities. One possibil-
ity for exploration that arises is whether valerian is particularly
useful in treating insomnia where there are higher levels of
anxiety. In fact, the observation that V. edulis reduced sleep
problems most effectively in children with hyperactivity46 may
suggest that valerian is more useful in treating insomnia asso-
ciated with particular psychiatric conditions such as anxiety.
The safety has been proven in a wide range from child-
hood46,84,86 to old age.38,45,53 Sleep problems are associated
with a number of comorbidities including anxiety, depression,
and dementia in both adulthood123,153 and childhood.154 As we
age, the quantity and quality of sleep decrease,155,156 and
insomnia and daytime drowsiness are frequently reported in
the older population.157 Thus, valerian may help improve the
quality of life in all ages by improving sleep quality, thereby
preventing a number of psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions.
However, due to the presence of multiple active constituents
and the unstable nature of some components, it may be useful
to revise the standardization methods and shelf life of the
extracts. Repeated treatments with the whole root / rhizome
consistently promoted sleep quality at 450-1410 mg per day
for 4-8 weeks, whereas valerian extracts 300-600 mg per day
for 5 days-4 weeks resulted in inconsistent outcomes. Evidence
is poor with respect to the effectiveness of single dose inter-
vention as a sleep aid. Developing effective standardization
methods would be desirable. Meanwhile, the usage of whole
herbal substances (root / rhizome), rather than extracts, may be
the way to obtain optimal efficacy for the time being.

Lastly, due to the subjective nature of sleep problems and
associated mood disorders, there remains a difficulty in deter-
mining the best measure for the efficacy of interventions. The

ultimate goal of any therapies, whether it be traditional, con-
ventional or integrative, beyond disease ‘cure’ or modulation,
is to improve the quality of life for patients. While objective
measures in a laboratory setting provide valuable information
and mechanistic understanding, it may be useful to consider
additional and more important factors that need to be addressed
specifically in each individual. Such measures and tailor-made
approaches would necessarily involve sufficient interaction
and communication between patients and practitioners. Devel-
oping effective trial strategies to address this issue is a future
challenge.
