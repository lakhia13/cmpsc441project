BACKGROUND: Undocumented immigration is often ac-
companied by multiple and complex stressors, which over
time may increase the risk for chronic pain.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the prevalence of
chronic pain and its association with psychological distress
among undocumented Latinx immigrants in the USA.
DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: We used respondent-driven
sampling to collect and analyze data from clinical inter-
views with 254 undocumented Latinx immigrants, en-
abling inference to a population of 22,000.
MAIN MEASURES: Chronic pain was assessed using the
World Health Organization Composite International Diag-
nostic Interview (CIDI) Chronic Conditions Module. For all
analyses, inferential statistics accounted for design effects
and sample weights to produce weighted estimates. We
conducted logistic regression analyses to assess the asso-
ciation between chronic pain and psychological distress
after controlling for age, years in the USA, and history of
trauma.
RESULTS: A total of 28% of undocumented Latinx immi-
grants reported having chronic pain, and 20% of those
had clinically significant psychological distress. Signifi-
cant differences in the prevalence of chronic pain were
reported across age groups, years in the USA, and trauma
history. After controlling for relevant covariates, chronic
pain was significantly associated with psychological dis-
tress (OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.02, 1.09]), age (OR = 1.05, 95%
CI [1.02; 1.09]), and history of trauma (OR = 1.10 per
additional traumatic event, 95% CI [1.02; 1.19]; C-
statistic = 0.79).

Highlights
(cid:129) This study is the first to document the prevalence of chronic pain among
undocumented Latino immigrants in the USA and emphasizes the
magnitude of chronic pain as a health concern for this at-risk immigrant
population.

(cid:129) Among undocumented Latino immigrants, chronic pain is common and
significantly associated with psychological distress, as well as age and
history of traumatic events.

(cid:129) These findings highlight the need for prevention efforts and access to
context- and culturally sensitive interventions for undocumented immi-
grants to prevent the detrimental health, economic, and social conse-
quences associated with chronic pain.

CONCLUSION: Among undocumented Latinx immi-
grants, chronic pain is significantly associated with psy-
chological distress, older age, and trauma history. Given
that undocumented immigrants have restricted access to
healthcare and are at high risk for chronic pain, develop-
ing alternatives to facilitate access to chronic pain inter-
ventions and risk-reduction prevention are needed.

C hronic pain is a global health concern associated with

detrimental pathophysiological, functional, economic,
and social consequences.1 Chronic pain is generally defined
as continuous or intermittent pain or discomfort that persists
for at least 3 months.2 Approximately 1.5 billion people live
with chronic pain worldwide, with US national estimates
exceeding 100 million.3 Furthermore, in the USA, racial/
ethnic disparities exist with regards to experiencing chronic
pain.1 For instance, Latinxs tend to report a lower prevalence
of chronic pain and less pain interference with daily function-
ing when compared with non-Latinx whites, but greater pain
severity.4 Likewise, disparities between these groups exist in
accessing, seeking, and responding to treatment for pain.4
Nonetheless, less is known about the prevalence of pain and
the pain experience among Latinxs who are hidden or hard-to-
reach, such as undocumented immigrants.

The undocumented immigration path is often accompanied
by multiple and complex stressors, which over time may
increase the risk for chronic pain. Hazardous working condi-
tions, limited healthcare access, exploitation, and stigmatiza-
tion are factors that could make undocumented immigrants
vulnerable to chronic pain. For instance, undocumented im-
migrants are more likely than their documented counterparts to
undertake physically demanding jobs in industries with high

rates of injuries and exposure to hazardous conditions.5–7
Non-job-related trauma is another cause of pain in
immigrants8,9—approximately 83% of undocumented immi-
grants report a lifetime history of trauma.10 Compounding
these problems, limited healthcare access and lack of insur-
ance force immigrants to pay out of pocket for healthcare; turn
to unsafe or non-evidence-based healing practices (e.g., herbal
remedies, hueseros, or bone/muscle therapy); or neglect
healthcare altogether.11 All of the aforementioned risk factors
suggest that undocumented immigrants may be vulnerable
population to chronic pain.

Information about the prevalence of chronic pain among
undocumented immigrants is needed to inform prevention,
intervention, advocacy, and policy efforts. To our knowledge,
no prior studies have addressed chronic pain among undocu-
mented immigrants. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) assess
the prevalence of chronic pain and associated vulnerabilities,
including history of trauma, among undocumented Latinx
immigrants residing near the US–Mexico border and (2) de-
termine whether there is an association between chronic pain
and psychological distress in this immigrant population.

METHODS

Design and Sampling

Given its effectiveness for studying hidden and hard-to-reach
populations, this cross-sectional study utilized respondent-
driven sampling (RDS) as the sampling and data analytic
method .12,13 RDS uses a structured referral system in which
successive waves of participants are recruited to achieve a
diverse sample. In contrast to the snowball method, RDS is a
network sampling method that captures the link-tracing design
of referrals and adapts it to provide the basis for statistical
inference. To produce population estimates, RDS uses weights
based on the size of the respondent’s social network to deter-
mine the probability of selection.14 Details about the RDS
methodology used have been described elsewhere .15
Participants. We determined undocumented status by asking
“At present, are you living in the U.S. without a visa or legal
documentation?”.13 Recruitment began with 3 previously
selected undocumented Latinx immigrants, or seeds,
identified during formative research. We selected seeds to
represent the diversity of the community, including gender,
age, place of residence, and relevant
immigration
characteristics.16 We provided each seed with 3 referral
coupons to recruit other participants. The next waves of
recruits were also provided with 3 referral coupons to recruit
additional participants. Sampling continued until we achieved
equilibrium, with a maximum chain length of 11 waves.
Equilibrium was verified empirically using RDS Analyst
software,17 which showed that the final subjects recruited no
longer had identical characteristics as the initial seeds. In all, we
recruited 257 undocumented Latinx immigrant adults ages 18
and older, mostly of Mexican origin (98%). We excluded 3

participants due to missing data. The analytical sample thus
comprised 254 undocumented Latinx immigrants residing in a
medium-sized city near the US–Mexico border. To provide the
most conservative estimates, and consistent with an RDS ap-
proach, we conducted analyses using the 15% population esti-
mate in the target location as a reference and weighted estimates
based on participant’s size of their social network, yielding a
population inference of N = 22,000.

Data Collection. Native Spanish–speaking psychology
trainees conducted face-to-face semi-structured clinical inter-
views lasting 1–3 h. To minimize error and increase efficiency,
we collected data using a computer-assisted personal
interviewing system.18 Participants provided verbal consent
prior to the interviews, and the study was approved by the
San Diego State University/University of California San Diego
institutional review board.

Measures
Chronic Pain. We assessed our main outcome measure,
chronic pain, by using the World Health Organization
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Chronic
Conditions Module Version 3.0.19 Responses to history of
chronic pain, defined as frequent pain in 1 or more areas of
the body for the past 3 months, were dichotomized as yes/no.
Among those with pain, we used open-ended questions to
assess the type of pain. We categorized responses as (1) lower
body, for pain in the feet, knees, and/or legs; (2) upper body,
for pain in the hands, arms, and/or shoulders; (3) back/neck;
(4) headaches/migraines; (5) generalized; and (6) other (e.g.,
stomach). The CIDI is a widely used measure and has excel-
lent psychometric properties.19

Psychological Distress. We assessed psychological distress
by using the Spanish version of the 18-item Brief Symptom
Inventory (BSI),20 which we pre-tested and adapted during a
pilot study.21 The BSI assesses psychological distress using
symptom patterns along 3 dimensions, including somatic,
anxiety, and depression symptoms. The BSI also renders a
global severity index (GSI), which captures overall distress.
Each item on the scale was rated on a 5-point level of distress
scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 4 = extremely. Using
gender-specific community norms, we converted raw scores to
standardized T scores for each subscale and the GSI (T score
mean = 50; SD = 10) .20 A T score greater than or equal to 63
denotes clinically significant psychological distress. The BSI
has well-established psychometric properties and has been
used previously with Latinx immigrants.22 The Cronbach’s
alpha for the BSI in this study is 0.95.

Trauma History. Participants completed an adapted version of
the Traumatic Events Inventory of the Harvard Trauma
Questionnaire (HTQ), designed to assess traumatic
experiences among at-risk immigrants .23 The adapted version
consisted of 25 items assessing traumatic events along 7

JGIM

587

domains, and 2 additional items assessing history of deportation
and domestic violence.24 In analyses using RDS to provide
population estimates, trauma history was dichotomized as pres-
ent vs. absent. For regression analyses, we used a total score
denoting the sum of different types of traumatic events ranging
from 0 to 25. The Cronbach’s alpha for the HTQ is 0.83.

Sociodemographics. Sociodemographic variables included
sex, age, marital status, educational attainment, monthly
income, employment, and years in the USA. Age at arrival
to the USA was not included because it is a function of both
age and length of stay.

All measures were adapted for content and language based

on results from formative research and pilot testing.21,25

Statistical Analyses

We conducted an a priori power analysis to estimate the
needed sample size by using OpenEpi, Version 3.01.26 Infer-
ential statistics accounted for design effects and sample
weights to produce weighted population estimates. We calcu-
lated weights based on the percentage of undocumented im-
migrants expected to reside in the study location. To evaluate
the prevalence of chronic pain and factors associated with
chronic pain, we used descriptive statistics and weighted fre-
quencies. Chi-square statistics were used for bivariate analy-
sis, with p ≤ 0.05 as the level of significance. In our baseline
multivariable logistic regression analysis, we assessed the
association of chronic pain with psychological distress after
controlling for relevant covariates found to be significantly
associated with chronic pain in bivariate analyses, including
age, years living in the USA, and history of trauma. In addi-
tional multivariable models, to identify specific symptoms of
psychological distress that could be associated with chronic
pain, we replaced psychological distress with somatization
(model 2), depression (model 3), or anxiety (model 4). An
assessment of collinearity among variables included in the full
model showed that there was a moderate positive association
between age and years living in the USA (r = 0.46, p < 0.001);
however, when testing for collinearity, no evidence was found
(variance inflation factor for age = 1.00; variance inflation
factor for number of years in USA = 1.01). Also, there was
no association between age and history of trauma (r = 0.06, p =
0.32); thus, age, years in the USA, and trauma were also
included in the full models as covariates. We used the SAS
software to conduct bivariate and multivariable analyses .27
RDS Assumptions and Weights. For testing RDS
assumptions, generating RDS weights, and analyzing
population estimates and 95% confidence intervals, we used
RDS Analyst software, including the successive sampling (SS)
estimator.17 Diagnostic testing for RDS assumptions showed
that the sample reached equilibrium at the 11th wave of recruit-
ment, showed little homophily bias (the tendency for people to
share social ties with others exhibiting similar characteristics
[e.g., gender recruitment homophily = 1.03]), and met basic

RESULTS

Subjects
Participants’ average age was 38.2 years (SD = 11.2). Most
were female, married, had low educational attainment, and
lived in poverty (Table 1). Approximately half were
employed, with most of those (71%) working in jobs with
high occupational injury rates.7 On average, participants had
lived in the USA for 16.4 years (SD = 7.9). Most reported a
history of trauma (83%): on average, participants had experi-
enced approximately 5 different types of traumatic events in
their lifetime (mean = 4.5; SD = 4.1; range 0–19).

Prevalence of Chronic Pain and Associated
Vulnerabilities

A total of 28% of participants reported having chronic pain,
with 46% of these having arthritis. Among participants with
chronic pain, pain was primarily described as generalized pain
(29%), back pain (24%), pain in the lower body (19%), pain in
the upper body (13%), and headaches/migraines (13%). Also,
2% of participants described their pain as other.

Bivariate analyses showed significant differences in the prev-
alence of chronic pain across age groups (Table 2), with older
undocumented immigrants reporting a greater prevalence of
chronic pain when compared with younger participants. Specif-
ically, the prevalence of chronic pain among younger immi-
grants (ages 18–35) ranged between 10 and 17%, whereas it
ranged between 33 and 45% for older immigrants (ages 36 and
older; p < 0.001). Also, significant differences were found by
years living in the USA, with participants who had lived longer
in the USA reporting greater prevalence of chronic pain. For
instance, the prevalence of chronic pain among immigrants who
have lived in the USA for less than 10 years was 15% versus
46% among those who have lived in the USA for longer than 20
years (p < 0.001). Significant differences in chronic pain were
also found by trauma history, with participants reporting a
history of trauma having a greater prevalence of chronic pain:
33% among immigrants with trauma history versus 2% for
those without trauma (p < 0.001).

A total of 20% of undocumented immigrants with chronic pain
met the criteria for clinically significant psychological distress
(Table 2). Bivariate analyses showed significant differences in
psychological distress among participants with versus without
chronic pain with subjects having chronic pain being 3 times
more likely to report clinically significant psychological dis-
tress than those without pain (OR = 3.04, 95% CI [1.36, 6.76];
p = 0.005). Also, among immigrants with chronic pain, bivar-
iate analyses showed significant differences in psychological
distress across age groups, with younger immigrants reporting
greater distress when compared with their older counterparts.
For instance, among 18–25-year-old immigrants, 67% report-
ed distress, compared with 33% for ages 26–35, 14% for ages
36–45 and 16% for ages ≥ 46 (p = 0.017). Likewise, 35% of
single immigrants with chronic pain reported distress vs. 13%
of married immigrants (p = 0.031).

In multivariable analysis, chronic pain was significantly
associated with psychological distress (OR = 1.06, 95% CI
[1.02, 1.09], p = 0.001), with those reporting higher psycho-
logical distress more likely to also report chronic pain. Also,
history of trauma and age were significantly associated with
chronic pain. Specifically, undocumented immigrants with a
history of more trauma episodes were more likely to report
chronic pain (OR = 1.10 per additional traumatic event, 95%
CI [1.02, 1.19], p = 0.014). Also, older immigrants were more
likely to report chronic pain (OR = 1.05 per each year increase
in age, 95% CI [1.02, 1.09], p = 0.002).

Post hoc analyses to identify specific symptoms of psycholog-
ical distress associated with chronic pain showed that after con-
trolling for age and years in the USA, chronic pain was signifi-
cantly associated with somatization (OR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.05,
1.13], p < 0.001; Table 3), with those reporting more somatic
symptoms being more likely to report chronic pain. Likewise,
anxiety was significantly associated with chronic pain (OR =
1.04, 95% CI [1.01, 1.08], p = 0.017), with those reporting more
anxiety symptoms being more likely to report chronic pain. With
regards to depression, there was a borderline significant associa-
tion between the number of depression symptoms and prevalence
of chronic pain (OR = 1.03, 95% CI [1.00, 1.06], p = 0.049). In
the 3 aforementioned models, history of trauma and age were
also significantly associated with chronic pain: undocumented
immigrants with more trauma episodes and those who were older
were more likely to report chronic pain (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

Although chronic pain and psychological distress are common
worldwide, no previous study has reported their prevalence
and characteristics among undocumented Latinx immigrants
in the USA, a vulnerable population. As such, our first goal
was to assess the prevalence of chronic pain among undocu-
mented Latinx immigrants. Slightly over a quarter of

immigrants reported having chronic pain, similar to the rate
reported for the US Latinx population at large (28%) .29,30
Additionally, our findings showed that back pain was the most
common type of chronic pain in this population, with a prev-
alence of 24%. Although the aforementioned estimates for
undocumented Latinx immigrants are comparable with those
of the US Latinx population, it is important to emphasize that
the experience of chronic pain among undocumented immi-
grants may be particularly distressing. In addition to having
limited access to healthcare, which is essential to manage
chronic pain, undocumented immigrants depend on their jobs
to make ends meet and must maintain good health to endure
demanding work conditions. As such, chronic pain in this
population could result in severe occupational consequences,
such as job loss.5 Our findings highlight the need to address

chronic pain as a public health concern in this at-risk immi-
grant population, given its negative health, social, and eco-
nomic effects.

Another aim of this study was to assess the association
between chronic pain and psychological distress. Results
showed that psychological distress is common and significant-
ly associated with chronic pain. We found that psychological
distress as a whole and specific psychological distress symp-
toms were associated with chronic pain. Specifically, in mul-
tivariable analyses, somatic and anxiety symptoms were sig-
nificantly associated with chronic pain, while depression had a
borderline significant association with chronic pain.31 These
findings are consistent with previous research conducted
among populations worldwide, which support the co-
occurrence of chronic pain with mood and anxiety disor-
ders.32,33 Beyond co-occurrence, research has demonstrated
a bidirectional relationship between mental health, specifically
depression and anxiety, and chronic pain where each influ-
ences the other to a similar magnitude.34 Of note, the relation-
ship of depression and chronic pain has been particularly
emphasized in previous research, with less attention given to
understanding the effect of anxiety and somatic symptoms on
chronic pain, and vice versa. Anxiety and somatic symptoms
are likely to increase catastrophic thinking, hypervigilance of
pain symptoms, and fear avoidance of pain sensations, all of
which could significantly impair functional ability and inter-
fere with treatment regimens .35 Noteworthy is that findings
from bivariate analyses showed that despite having the second
lowest rate of chronic pain, the youngest undocumented im-
migrants (ages 18–25) reported the highest levels of psycho-
logical distress. Living with chronic pain is challenging, and
even more so for young people facing complex biological,
psychological, and social challenges,36 such as those often
experienced by young undocumented immigrants.37 The neg-
ative impact that chronic pain may have on the functional
ability of younger immigrants to manage their busy life sched-
ules, face demanding living conditions, and strive to achieve
the American Dream may also contribute to the increased rates
of distress reported by these young immigrants with chronic
pain. Future studies should further explore the association of
chronic pain, anxiety, and somatic symptoms among this
immigrant population, particularly young immigrants.

Moreover, our study also identified vulnerabilities associated
with chronic pain among undocumented immigrants. Similar to
age-related effects found in previous studies of chronic pain in
the general population, our study highlights older age as a risk
factor .29,30 Musculoskeletal pain (e.g., due to osteoarthritis) is
common among older individuals and could potentially explain
the association between older age and chronic pain38; our
sample was relatively young (mean [SD], 38.2 [11.2] years)
and yet about one-quarter of the sample reported chronic pain.
Undocumented immigrants often undertake physically de-
manding jobs and heavy labor, which in turn it may lead to
more musculoskeletal pain and possible arthritic changes at an
earlier age. Indeed, over time, the continued exposure to

hardship, heavy labor, and stressful environments that undoc-
umented immigrants face may increase their risk for chronic
pain.39 Future studies are needed to identify how contextual
stressors, such as work environments, faced by undocumented
immigrants may contribute to chronic pain over time, particu-
larly as immigrants become older and unable to work.

Another interesting finding in our study was that history of
trauma is associated with chronic pain in a dose-response
fashion: the more traumatic episodes the person has experi-
enced, the greater the chance that he or she is experiencing
chronic pain. This finding is consistent with previous research
supporting the association between lifetime frequency of trauma
and chronic pain.9 Research suggests that being exposed to
traumatic events can prolong activation of one’s stress response
system, which in turn suppresses the immune system; breaks
down neural tissue, bone, and muscle; and impairs tissue
growth and repair, thus increasing susceptibility to chronic pain
.40 Additional research is needed to identify and understand the
mechanisms through which trauma may be associated with
chronic pain, particularly in populations that experience stress
and trauma as is the case of many undocumented immigrants.

Limitations

Our study had several limitations. Although RDS is the most
effective epidemiological method to study hidden popula-
tions,41 it has some methodological limitations.42 Nonetheless,
steps were taken to collect data from a representative sample.
Although the sample size may appear to be small, we studied a
hidden or hard-to-reach population about which little is
known, and our sample is within the recommended size for
RDS studies to facilitate calculating population-based esti-
mates. Thus, our results reflect prevalence estimates for ap-
proximately 22,000 undocumented Latinx immigrants in the
target region. Second, this study assessed prevalence of chron-
ic pain, but not severity of pain or functional impairment due
to pain. Additional studies are needed that can further eluci-
date how severity of pain and impairment affect the quality of
life of undocumented immigrants living with chronic pain.
Next, psychological distress in this border community may
be different from that experienced by undocumented immi-
grants in other US regions. Follow-up studies with different
populations of undocumented immigrants are needed. Our
sample was predominantly female and on average participants
had lived in the USA for more than 10 years. Thus, these data
are more representative of established undocumented Latinx
US immigrants as opposed to recent immigrants. Assessments
were based on retrospective reporting, which may lead to
biases and may result in inaccurate estimates.43 Finally, this
study was cross-sectional; thus, causation cannot be inferred.

CONCLUSION

Our findings emphasize the magnitude of chronic pain as a
health concern for undocumented immigrants, with attendant

public health implications. Better prevention and treatment
efforts are warranted—in particular, context- and culture-
sensitive interventions. Revising policies to devise solutions
grounded in evidence and developing new alternatives to
facilitate access and provision of health services to undocu-
mented immigrants are critical to prevent suffering and the
detrimental health, economic, and social consequences asso-
ciated with chronic pain.
