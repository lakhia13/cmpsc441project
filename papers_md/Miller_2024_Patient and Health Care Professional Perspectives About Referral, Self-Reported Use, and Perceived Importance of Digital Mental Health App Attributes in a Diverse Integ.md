Abstract

Background:  Digital mental health applications (DMHAs) are emerging, novel solutions to address gaps in behavioral health
care. Accordingly, Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS) integrated referrals for 6 unique DMHAs into clinical care
in 2019.

Objective:  This study investigated patient and health care professional (HCP) experiences with DMHA referral; DMHA use;
and perceived importance of engagement, functionality, design, and information attributes in real-world practice.

Methods:  Separate cross-sectional surveys were developed and tested for patients and HCPs. Surveys were administered to
KPMAS participants through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), and completed between March 2022 and June 2022.
Samples included randomly selected patients who were previously referred to at least 1 DMHA between April 2021 and December
2021 and behavioral health and primary care providers who referred DMHAs between December 2019 and December 2021.

Results:  Of the 119 patients e-mailed a survey link, 58 (48.7%) completed the survey and 44 (37%) confirmed receiving a
DMHA referral. The mean age of the sample was 42.21 (SD 14.08) years (29/44, 66%); 73% (32/44) of the respondents were
female, 73% (32/44) of the respondents had at least a 4-year college degree, 41% (18/44) of the respondents were Black or African
American, and 39% (17/44) of the respondents were White. Moreover, 27% (12/44) of the respondents screened positive for
anxiety symptoms, and 23% (10/44) of the respondents screened positive for depression. Overall, 61% (27/44) of the respondents
reported DMHA use for ≤6 months since referral, 36% (16/44) reported use within the past 30 days, and 43% (19/44) of the
respondents reported that DMHAs were very or extremely helpful for improving mental and emotional health. The most important
patient-reported DMHA attributes by domain were being fun and interesting to use (engagement); ease in learning how to use
(functionality); visual appeal (design); and having well-written, goal- and topic-relevant content (information). Of the 60 sampled
HCPs, 12 (20%) completed the survey. Mean HCP respondent age was 46 (SD 7.75) years, and 92% (11/12) of the respondents
were female. Mean number of years since completing training was 14.3 (SD 9.94) years (10/12, 83%). Of the 12 HCPs, 7 (58%)
were physicians and 5 (42%) were nonphysicians. The most important HCP-reported DMHA attributes by domain were personalized
settings and content (engagement); ease in learning how to use (functionality); arrangement and size of screen content (design);
and having well-written, goal- and topic-relevant content (information). HCPs described “typical patients” referred to DMHAs
based on perceived need, technical capability, and common medical conditions, and they provided guidance for successful use.

Conclusions:  Individual patient needs and preferences should match the most appropriate DMHA. With many DMHA choices,
decision support systems are essential to assist patients and HCPs with selecting appropriate DMHAs to optimize uptake and
sustained use.

Introduction

Background
Anxiety  and  depressive  disorders  are  common  mental  health
conditions in the United States that cause functional impairment
and  represent  a  leading  cause  of  disability  [1,2].  Although
evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for these
conditions exist, the combined shortage of trained mental health
clinicians and high demand for mental and behavioral health
services have limited access to evidence-based care [3,4]. Thus,
there is an urgent need for efficient and effective treatments that
are innovative, scalable, and sustainable to address the growing
public health dilemma of access to evidence-based behavioral
health care services.

Digital mental health applications (DMHAs) are an emerging,
novel solution to address this care gap. Many DMHAs apply
evidence-based  principles  and  have  accumulated  empirical
support primarily in controlled settings [5-7]. These DMHAs
have demonstrated efficacy to reduce mental health symptoms
(eg, anxiety and depression), support emotional well-being (eg,
stress reduction), and improve resiliency. A recent meta-analysis
of 36 randomized clinical trials comparing stand-alone DMHA
interventions  to  non-DMHA  control  groups  found  modest
therapeutic  effect  sizes  for  anxiety  (Hedges  g=0.31)  and
depression  (Hedges  g=0.35).  Key  moderators  included  the
duration of the intervention, the presence of symptoms at the
start of the study, and the types of outcome measures used [7].

While DMHAs are not a substitute for in-person care, they can
be  broadly  disseminated  to  at-risk  individuals  to  address
subclinical mental health problems before clinical intervention.
A  stepped-care  approach  could  reduce  the  demand  for  the
number of patients requiring in-person care for mental health
conditions,  which  would  increase  the  accessibility  and
availability of in-person health care professionals (HCPs) within
health care systems for persons with more immediate or serious
need. Beyond this, DMHAs can serve in an adjunctive capacity
to in-person evidence-based care within a new and emerging
mental health care paradigm.

Digital Mental Health Integration Into Clinical Care
DMHAs  hold  considerable  potential 
in  complementing
accessibility to traditional mental health services. Large health
care systems such as Kaiser Permanente (KP) have integrated
the  use  of  DMHAs  into  the  management  of  mental  health
conditions [8]. Beginning in 2017, KP developed a framework
for  implementation  of  DMHAs.  As  deployed,  the  DMHAs
studied in this research were selected and intended to be used
for self-care as part of a comprehensive ecosystem of services
for  improving  emotional  health  and  well-being.  Using  a
human-centered design approach, KP assessed both clinician
and  patient  insights  to  design  a  digital  health  ecosystem  [8].
Since then, KP has engaged in ongoing feasibility assessment,

implementation,  and  expansion  across  its  regions  and  has
previously  been  reported  in  the  literature  [8].  Current
understanding  suggests  a  need  to  further  explore  and  refine
strategies for implementation and to identify ways to best align
candidate  patients  with  the  appropriate  treatment  for  a  more
unified referral and patient experience.

In brief, Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS) is
a  large,  diverse  integrated  health  care  system  that  provides
comprehensive health care services to >800,000 actively insured
members in Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Northern
Virginia.  Health  care  encounters  across  the  entire  care
continuum are documented in an electronic health record for
all members. All patients in this study were referred to at least
1  of  6  approved  DMHAs,  recommended  by  the  previously
described implementation framework [8], during an in-person
or telehealth encounter in outpatient or ambulatory care settings
by either a primary care physician, specialty care physician, or
a behavioral HCP (physician or nonphysician). HCP workflow
was designed to facilitate DMHA referrals using a standardized
order set in the electronic health record. Continuing education,
training, and individual support where necessary were offered
to HCPs at various times during the implementation period. An
internal website for HCPs to guide referral of the DMHAs was
made available within the workflow. During implementation,
behavioral  health  providers  were  authorized  to  refer  patients
for all 6 DMHAs with no registration cost. However, for primary
and specialty care providers, referrals were limited to only 2
DMHAs.

After the initial rollout in December 2019, the KPMAS region
observed  steep  increases  in  DMHA  referrals  during  the  first
quarter of calendar years 2020 and 2021, with declining patterns
in the periods between those quarters [9]. During this 2-year
study  period,  there  were  variations  in  patient,  clinical,  and
encounter type characteristics observed depending on whether
the DMHA referrals included mindfulness and meditation alone,
cognitive behavioral therapy alone, or a combination of both,
and these results have previously been reported in the literature
[9].

Objectives
Optimal use of DMHAs requires both clinicians’ willingness
to prescribe to patients and patients’ willingness to adopt and
engage in their use. With limited information available about
factors that influence the adoption and use of DMHAs in routine
clinical  practice,  we  aimed  to  explore  patient  and  HCP
perspectives  that  may  affect  referral,  adoption,  and  use  of
DMHAs  for  improving  emotional  well-being  and  addressing
subclinical,  mild  to  moderate  mental  health  conditions  in
real-world settings.

Methods

Design
A pilot study using cross-sectional surveys spanning a 4-month
period  (March  2022  to  June  2022)  was  conducted  to  gather
patient and HCP perceptions about their recent past end user
experience  with  DMHAs.  The  overarching  approach  for  this
study  was  guided,  in  part,  by  diffusion  of  innovation  theory
[10],  where  adoption  of  a  new  device,  practice,  or  idea  is
dependent on three factors: (1) perception of the innovation, (2)
characteristics  of  those  who  may  adopt  the  change,  and  (3)
contextual factors.

Where applicable, the elements of cross-sectional survey design,
institutional  review  board  (IRB)  considerations,  survey
development  and  pretesting,  recruitment  process  and  sample
description, survey administration, response rates, and analysis
as outlined in published guidance [11] were followed and are
described herein. Both the patient and HCP survey instruments
(Multimedia Appendices 1 and 2) are provided for the reader
to assess content, length, and structure. Because patients were
explicitly recruited, completed a consent form, and were sent a
participant-specific survey link, duplicate entries were avoided.

Ethical Considerations
The study was approved by KPMAS IRB (1761101). Survey
responses were not linked to the electronic health record. A US
$25 electronic gift card for patient participants and a US $50
electronic  gift  card  for  HCP  participants  were  offered  as  an
incentive  if  the  surveys  were  completed.  Participant-specific
survey  links  were  sent  via  email  addresses  but  were  stored
independently from the final analytic survey dataset. Participant
survey responses were not linked to gift card distribution. No
personally identifiable information is included in the manuscript
or Multimedia Appendices 1 and 2. All study data were stored
on  an  internal,  password-protected  KPMAS  server,  which
required dual authentication for access.

Patient and HCP Samples
To identify an eligible pool of participants, KP HealthConnect
electronic  health  records  were  used  to  identify  adult  patients
(aged ≥18 y) who were referred to ≥1 DMHAs between April
2021 and December 2021 during a health care encounter. This
time frame for evaluation was selected to not overlap with past
internal  evaluation  efforts.  All  HCPs  who  had  referred  (ie,
ordered) ≥1 DMHAs during a health care encounter between
the implementation of the DMHA initiative (December 2019)
and  December  2021  comprised  the  eligible  HCP  pool  of
participants.

From the eligible participant pools, quota samples of 60 patients
and 12 HCPs were set as a goal for this initial pilot work. For
patients, a randomized block sampling design was used with
repeated sampling blocks of 63 until the quota was fulfilled.
The patient sample was stratified by each referral month (April
2021 through December 2021) to ensure representation across
the entire observation period and include varying durations of
potential  use.  The  HCP  sample  was  stratified  to  ensure
representation from physicians and nonphysicians, and primary
care, specialty, and behavioral health care HCPs in randomized

blocks  of  30  to  fulfill  the  quota.  Participant  responses  were
deidentified and not linked to electronic health record data to
encourage participation by ensuring confidentiality of responses.
For both patient and HCP samples, random selection was used
to optimize representation of the eligible participation pools.

Measurements
As  no  standardized  assessment  existed  due  to  the  innovative
nature of this work, clinician and patient surveys were developed
de novo in accordance with accepted survey methods [12], while
considering  commonly  accepted  frameworks  for  technology
evaluation  (eg,  American  Psychiatric  Association  App
Evaluation  Model  [13]  and  Technology  Acceptance  Model
[14,15])  and  other  work  related  to  the  rating  of  mobile  apps
[16-18]. This was supplemented by internal evaluations from
the national KP Project Chamai [8].

Once constructed, instruments were assessed for content validity
by study investigators and modified via consensus discussions.
Afterward,  the  surveys  were  programmed  into  REDCap
(Research  Electronic  Data  Capture;  Vanderblit  University)
[19,20],  which  is  a  secure,  Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act (HIPAA)–compliant web-based application
for  administering  electronic  surveys.  The  instruments  were
iteratively refined vis-à-vis before testing within the research
team  and  feedback  from  clinician  colleagues.  The  final
IRB-approved  electronic  versions  of  the  instruments  were
distributed via email to the target patient and HCP recruitment
pools derived from KP HealthConnect via participant-specific
survey links.

The  patient  survey  instrument  is  provided  as  Multimedia
Appendix  1.  Items  were  organized  into  the  following  three
domains: (1) DMHA experience (ie, recall of DMHA referral
from HCP, types of DMHAs used, extent of use, and reasons
for initiating or continuing DMHA use; reasons for not starting
or  discontinuing  DMHA  use;  and  importance  of  DMHA
attributes with respect to engagement, functionality, design, and
information categories); (2) current emotional and mental health
and wellness (ie, Patient Health Question 4 [PHQ-4] [21] and
Subjective  Happiness  Scale  [22]);  and  (3)  respondent
demographic  information,  including  age,  gender,  education
level,  race  or  ethnicity,  marital  status,  income  sufficiency,
English as a first language, general health status, health literacy
[23], and confidence using a smartphone to manage emotional
health and wellness.

The HCP survey instrument is provided as Multimedia Appendix
2.  The  questions  were  organized  into  the  following  three
domains: (1) DMHA referrals (ie, types of DMHAs, how many
DMHAs referred at 1 encounter, advantages and disadvantages
of referring multiple DMHAs, and reasons for DMHA referral);
(2) importance of DMHA attributes with respect to engagement,
functionality,  design,  and  information  categories;  and  (3)
respondent demographic information. Additional open-ended
questions were used to allow HCPs to describe facilitators and
barriers to DMHA referral and use as well as a typical patient
referral  to  enhance  discussion  of  the  findings.  Because  the
DMHA initiative had been implemented for >1 year at the time
of  survey,  a  description  of  the  “typical”  patient  referral  was
requested rather than also requesting descriptions of the worst-

and best-case scenarios. This approach also helped to minimize
respondent burden.

For  both  survey  instruments,  questions  were  presented  in  a
consistent order using a mix of yes or no, multiple selection,
rank ordering, and Likert-type scale response sets. In contrast
with the patient survey, open-ended questions were also used
to  gather  a  more  detailed  qualitative  description  of  the  HCP
experience with DMHA referrals.

Procedures and Survey Implementation
Patients selected from the eligible participant pool were initially
contacted via a personal telephone call and, if interested, were
sent a subsequent email invitation to participate in this closed
survey. The email invitation included a participant-specific link
to the electronic consent form and electronic survey distributed
through REDCap [19,20]. The consent form was presented in
a question and answer format that included the following: study
title;  contact  information  of  the  principal  investigator  and
research  associate;  brief  study  overview;  why  the  study  was
being  conducted;  what  will  happen  when  participating;  how
long  participation  will  take;  potential  risks,  discomforts,  and
benefits;  incentives  for  participation;  confidentiality  and
safeguarding  of  information;  reasons  for  withdrawal  by  the
investigator; 
rights  of  voluntary  participation;  contact
information for questions; and a signature block acknowledging
understanding  and  willingness  to  participate.  Research  staff
attempted to contact eligible patients by phone on a maximum
of 3 occasions, with each call attempt at least 3 days apart. If a
patient was not reached, a voice message was left when possible.
Internal administrative policy mandates that HCPs be initially
contacted by email, rather than by telephone, to invite them to
participate  in  the  electronic  survey  distributed  via  REDCap
[19,20]. The survey included an initial triage question to avoid
surveying  patients  or  HCPs  who  did  not  recall  receiving  or
providing a DMHA referral. Participants had the opportunity
to review and edit their responses before submitting the survey.

For each survey invitation sent, up to 3 weekly email reminders
to complete the survey were sent to interested participants, as
needed.  Survey  links  were  disabled  4  weeks  after  the  initial
email was sent if they were not completed. Participants had up
to 7 days to complete the survey after initially opening the link
before it was disabled.

Analysis
Data  were  extracted  from  REDCap  [19,20],  organized  and
cleaned,  and  reported  using  descriptive  statistics  (ie,  means,
measures  of  variability,  and  frequencies  and  proportions
depending on the level of measurement) to profile the patient
and  HCP  survey  responses.  Rather  than  requiring  fully
completed surveys, analyses were conducted by question unless
all  items  were  necessary  to  calculate  a  specific  scale  result.
Internal  consistencies  for  the  PHQ-4  [21]  and  Subjective
Happiness Scale [22] were calculated to establish measurement
reliability for these scales. A pairwise correlation between the
PHQ-4 [21] and Subjective Happiness Scale [22] was calculated
to further establish response consistency and reliability. Because
each of the 4 DMHA attribute domains had a different number

of attributes to rank (ie, engagement, 6/6, 100%; functionality,
5/5, 100%; design, 4/4, 100%; and information domains, 5/5,
100%),  the  rank-order  scores  within  each  domain  were
standardized to reflect a scale of 100 to simplify interpretation.
To do this, individual rank-order scores for each attribute were
first  coded  so  that  higher  values  reflected  higher  perceived
importance. The recoded importance scores were then multiplied
by (100/number of attributes in the domain) to create a scale
where lower values reflected less importance and higher values
reflected more importance with a ceiling value of 100. Analyses
were performed using Stata (version 16.1; StataCorp LLC).

Results

Survey Response Rates: Patient Survey
There were 9525 patients referred to at least 1 DMHA between
April 2021 and December 2021. Of those 9525 patients, 378
(3.97%) were randomly sampled from 6 blocks of 63 patients.
A  total  of  119  patients  agreed  to  participate  and  were  sent  a
survey link. Of those 119 patients, 62 (52.1%) clicked on the
emailed  survey  link  and  58  (48.7%)  completed  the  survey
between March 2022 and June 2022, resulting in an effective
response rate of 48.7% (58/119). Importantly, 24% (14/58) of
the patients did not recall or report being referred to a DMHA
and  were  removed  from  the  analyses  because  the  survey
questions were intended to reflect user experience, resulting in
a usable response rate of 37% (44/119).

Survey Response Rates: HCP Survey
There were 410 HCPs who had referred at least 1 DMHA during
a  health  care  encounter  between  the  implementation  of  the
DMHA initiative (December 2019) and December 2021. Of the
410  HCPs,  60  (14.6%)  from  2  blocks  of  30  HCPs  per  block
were  invited  to  complete  the  survey.  A  total  of  12  HCPs
completed  the  survey  between  March  2022  and  May  2022,
fulfilling the quota sample with an effective response rate of
20%.

Patient and HCP Characteristics
A  total  of  44  patient  respondents  completed  the  survey  and
reported having a DMHA referred to them by their HCP (Table
1).  Of  those  44  patient  respondents,  32  (73%)  were  female
participants, 32 (73%) had at least a 4-year college degree, 18
(41%)  were  Black  or  African  American,  and  17  (39%)  were
White. Mean age of the patient respondents was 42 (SD 14.08)
years  (29/44,  66%).  Moreover,  27%  (12/44)  of  the  patient
respondents screened positive for anxiety symptoms, and 23%
(10/44)  of  the  patient  respondents  screened  positive  for
depression  symptoms  using  items  from  the  PHQ-4  [21].
Collectively, one-fourth (11/44, 25%) of the patient respondents
reported a moderate to severe (≥6) PHQ-4 [21] overall score.
The mean and median Subjective Happiness Scores [22] were
4.73  (SD  1.22)  and  4.75  (IQR  3.75-5.75),  respectively,  and
within the average range of 4.5 to 5.5 of other sample norms.
Subjective  Happiness  Scores  [22]  were  inversely  correlated
with  PHQ-4  scores  [21]  (r=–0.44;  P=.003;  43/44,  98%),
indicating reliable survey completion.

of the HCP respondents was 46 (SD 7.75) years (11/12, 92%),
and 92% (11/12) of the HCPs were female. The mean number
of  years  since  completing  training  was  14.3  (SD  9.94)  years
(10/12,  83%).  Of  the  12  HCP  respondents,  7  (58%)  were

physicians,  with  the  remainder  (n=5,  42%)  either  a  licensed
psychologist  or  clinical  social  worker.  All  HCP  respondents
personally tried at least 1 mindfulness or meditation DMHA,
but only 42% (5/12) of the respondents personally tried at least
1 cognitive behavioral therapy DMHA.

DMHA Use and Referral
Approximately 73% (32/44) of the patient respondents recalled
being referred to only 1 DMHA. Furthermore, 91% (40/44) of
the  patient  respondents  reported  referral  to  1  of  the  3

only 25% (11/44) of the respondents recalling referral to 1 of

the 3 cognitive behavioral DMHAs (result not reported in Table

reported ever using at least 1 DMHA, and 61% (27/44) of the
respondents reported DMHA use for ≤6 months after referral
at the time of the survey. Of the 16 (36%) patient respondents
who  reported  current  use  (ie,  within  the  past  30  days),  75%

HCP-Reported Barriers to DMHA Use
From  open-ended  responses,  the  most  commonly  reported
barriers observed by HCPs included difficulty downloading and
registering the DMHA; lack of patient motivation, self-direction,
and consistent use; time constraints for both patient and HCPs;
and follow-up about DMHA use and effectiveness.

Typical Patients for Whom DMHAs Are Referred
Using  open-ended  text  responses,  HCPs  described  “typical
patients”  commonly  referred  to  DMHAs  based  on  perceived
need, technical capability, and common medical conditions. As
summarized, perceived need factors included (1) healthy adults

Perceived  technical  capability  included  (1)  patients  who  are
smartphone  or  technology  savvy,  who  already  incorporate
technology and apps into their lifestyle (eg, Fitbit and music
apps),  and  who  use  them  as  part  of  their  entertainment;  (2)

DMHAs;  and  (3)  patients  who  have  time  to  actually  use  the
DMHA and are open to try other resources. In their own words,
the top 10 most common medical conditions for which HCPs
referred  DMHAs  included  the  following:  (1)  stress,  anxiety
(mild to severe), and generalized anxiety disorder; (2) depression
and major depressive disorder; (3) emotional dysregulation; (4)
distorted and negative thinking; (5) posttraumatic stress disorder;
(6)  sleep  disturbance  and  insomnia;  (7)  multiple  somatic

Discussion

Overview
This study describes concurrent patient and HCP perspectives
within  an  integrated  health  system  that  may  affect  referral,
adoption,  and  use  of  DMHAs  for  improving  emotional
well-being and mental health conditions in the same practice
environment. Importantly, the results reinforce the necessity to
identify and tailor individual patient needs and preferences with
the most appropriate DMHA to ensure successful engagement
and  sustainable  use.  These  themes  are  supported  by  prior
research [24] that identified 16 constructs that may influence
user engagement with DMHAs; these constructs are grouped
by user (ie, demographics, personal traits, mental health status,
beliefs, mental health technology experience, and integration
into life), program (ie, type of content, perceived fit, perceived
usefulness, level of guidance, social connectedness, and impact
of 
(ie,
technology-related factors, privacy and confidentiality, social
influence, and implementation) [24]. Many of these constructs
manifest themselves in this research and are highlighted in the
subsequent sections.

and 

Facilitating Patient Uptake and Sustained Use
Both low and sustained engagement with DMHAs have been
recognized as a barrier to successful use [24,25]. In this study,
approximately three-fourths (44/58, 76%) of the patients recalled
or reported being referred to at least 1 DMHA, suggesting that
approximately one-fourth (14/58, 24%) of the patients referred
to  DMHAs  did  not  engage  with  them  despite  documented
referral.  Although  a  majority  of  patients  (39/44,  89%)  who
recalled being referred to a DMHA reported at least some use,
only a minority (12/44, 27%) reported >6 months of continued
use. It is likely that the time between referral and the survey
may have reduced the reported duration of use, making this a
conservative estimate, and despite this limitation, the levels of

https://formative.jmir.org/2024/1/e59831

XSL•FO
RenderX

engagement, ever use, and sustained use appear to be higher
than those reported in previous research [26,27]. Although only
36% (16/44) of the patient respondents reported current DMHA
use, 75% (12/16) of those who did also reported once daily to
once weekly use. This finding reinforces the notion that while
DMHAs  are  not  a  viable  or  ideal  therapeutic  solution  for
everyone, they may have an important role in a select group of
patients who routinely use them. Moreover, the ideal or preferred
duration of use will likely depend on the condition for which
the DMHA is being used. Given the wide array of conditions
for DMHA use reported in this pilot research, it is not possible
to  determine  optimal  duration  for  each,  and  this  remains  an
important area for future research.

Collectively, these findings suggest that initial engagement and
sustained use of DMHAs was modest even when an organization
encourages and supports their use. If patients are to realize the
full  benefit  of  DMHA  use,  health  system  interventions  that
promote and increase identification of patients most likely to
engage  and  sustain  DMHA  use  should  be  a  focus  of  future
efforts.  Importantly,  82%  (36/44)  of  the  patient  respondents
reported some degree of helpfulness from the DMHA and >90%
(41/44)  of  the  patient  respondents  agreed  or  strongly  agreed
with assuming personal responsibility for their own mental and
emotional health and well-being. This aligns with prior research
suggesting that DMHAs could be empowering and supportive
of self-management [28].

It  is  recognized  that  guidance  and  training  facilitate  DMHA
engagement [24]. On the basis of their own experience, HCP
respondents  offered  practical  advice  to  facilitate  successful
initiation and sustainable use of DMHAs. It is critical that HCPs
invest  time,  not  only  at  initiation  of  referral  but  also  during
ongoing care, to raise awareness and reinforce why and how
DMHA use is an important component of their treatment plan
and to encourage engagement. Simply referring a patient to a
DMHA with limited explanation is likely insufficient.

It  has  been  previously  reported  that  HCPs  who  use  DMHAs
themselves are more likely to use them in practice [29]. In this
study,  all  HCP  respondents  (12/12,  100%)  reported  use  of  a
mindfulness and meditation DMHA, but less than half (5/12,
42%) reported use of a cognitive behavioral therapy DMHA.
To  facilitate  use,  HCPs  recommended  using  the  DMHAs
themselves; describing their own experience with the DMHAs;
and providing a subsequent show-and-tell with the patient, if
comfortable.  Assisting  the  patient  with  downloading  the
DMHAs, walking them through how to use it, demonstrating
the different features and functionality, and showing them how
to find clinically relevant content was also helpful. Collectively,
these actions may overcome technology literacy barriers. While
these best practices are ideal, time, resource, and reimbursement
limitations may foil their implementation. HCPs may become
fatigued if they have to perform this for all their patients, which
could  lead  them  to  stop  integrating  DMHAs  into  care  if  the
process is too burdensome. Therefore, alternative solutions and
resources  to  facilitate  implementation  must  be  created  for
sustainability purposes.

Assessing  patient  interest  and  highlighting  an  aspect  of  the
DMHA that aligns with the patient’s area of interest, describing

Miller et al

the purpose and value of the DMHA, and ensuring the patient
understands  that  it  is  an  adjunct  to  in-person  therapy  and  an
opportunity to reinforce skills learned in their in-person session
may also be beneficial. To support goal setting, HCPs suggested
integrating  the  DMHA  into  the  treatment  plan  by  explaining
rationale (eg, mindfulness to decrease anxiety) and indicating
that  it  will  be  discussed  at  the  next  session.  Finally,  HCP
respondents recommended in-person practice using the DMHA
and setting reminders for the patient to use the DMHA between
sessions,  while  reassuring  ease  of  use  and  reinforcing  that  it
does not need to be used daily to further facilitate engagement.

Aligning Patient Preferences and Needs
While  patients  and  HCPs  often  prioritize  the  importance  of
many key DMHA attributes similarly, it is important for HCPs
to recognize that a “one-size-fits-all” approach is not ideal [24].
HCPs must identify unique patient preferences rather than using
preferences  based  on  their  own  user  experience.  In  the
engagement  domain,  patients  placed  highest  importance  on
DMHAs that are fun or interesting to use, whereas HCPs placed
less importance on this attribute. Consistent with past reports
[24], HCPs placed highest importance on personalized settings
and content in the engagement domain, with patients reporting
these attributes with second highest importance. With respect
to  the  design  domain,  patients  placed  highest  importance  on
visual appeal, while HCPs reported the arrangement and size
of buttons, icons, and menus to be most important. The fact that
both patients and HCPs in this study reported past or current
experience with DMHA use underscores the credibility of these
findings related to preferences.

Importantly, previous research recognized that engagement was
facilitated  with  an  “appropriate”  amount  of  credible  content
[24].  In  this  study,  both  patients  and  HCPs  reinforced  the
importance of this attribute by placing it as the highest priority
in the information domain. Both patients and HCPs assigned
the  highest  importance  to  the  ease-of-use  attribute  in  the
functionality  domain.  Interestingly,  both  patients  and  HCPs
assigned the least importance to the DMHA attribute that allows
them  to  be  contacted  by  a  mental  health  HCP,  if  needed,
suggesting a desire for privacy. This observation is supported
by the literature that DMHA engagement was improved when
there  was  reassurance  that  the  DMHA  provided  privacy  and
anonymity [24].

Finally, patients and HCPs expressed a wide array of patient
needs  for  which  the  DMHA  was  referred.  Given  that  it  is
uncommon for a DMHA to excel in every clinical domain, 42%
(5/12) of the HCPs reported that they may order >1 DMHA at
an encounter, and 27% (12/44) of the patients indicated that >1
DMHA was recommended by a HCP. These findings underscore
the importance of understanding patient needs and preferences
and  then  tailoring  the  referral  of  a  DMHA  to  avoid
overwhelming the patient and creating potential confusion.

Considering the varying preferences, HCPs must identify the
attributes and content that are important and necessary to align
the  DMHA  with  each  patient’s  needs.  With  a  wide  array  of
DMHAs available, HCPs and health systems must develop a
decision  support  system  that  facilitates  alignment  of  patient

Limitations
While this research is unique in incorporating both patient and
HCP perspectives of active DMHA users in a real-world setting,
it does have limitations. The small sample, low response rate,
and 
limit
generalizability  to  other  practice  settings.  This  research  was
designed to minimize respondent identification and, therefore,
relied on participant self-reported responses, with no linkage
to medical records. As such, some variables incurred a number
of  missing  observations  (eg,  age),  but  for  the  most  part,
missingness  was  limited.  Importantly,  the  patient  sample
reflected a slightly older age (42 vs 39 y), similar distributions
of White and Black patients (17/44, 39% and 18/44, 41% vs
3473/9525, 36.5% and 3702/9525, 38.9%, respectively), fewer
Hispanic patients (2/44, 5% vs 1028/9525, 10.8%), and similar
distribution  of  female  patients  (32/44,  73%  vs  6754/9525,
70.9%) compared to the overall referral pool of 9525 eligible
patients during the observation period between April 2021 and
December 2021. The HCP sample included a smaller percentage
of  physicians  (7/12,  58%  vs  279/410,  68%)  and  increased
percentage  of  behavioral  health  care  HCPs  (6/12,  50%  vs
168/410, 41%) than the total pool of 410 eligible HCPs who
had referred at least 1 DMHA during a health care encounter
between the implementation of the DMHA initiative (December
2019) and December 2021. Despite recruitment, there were no
specialty  physicians  included  in  the  HCP  sample.  Moreover,
the samples were limited to respondents with English language
proficiency.  In  the  absence  of  an  ideal  survey  instrument  for
purposes of this research, many items were developed de novo
but were constructed using acceptable assessment frameworks,
evaluated for content validity, and piloted within the study team
before  use.  Given  the  voluntary  nature  of  this  research,  a
completeness  check  was  not  required.  However,  response
consistency was assessed and confirmed by comparing PHQ-4
[21] and Subjective Happiness Scores [22]. Future work should
include both HCP and patient end user feedback in instrument
design and data collection. Finally, this research mainly focuses
on implementation and does not evaluate clinical impact that
should be incorporated and studied in future work. Importantly,
this research provides a start to a more comprehensive effort to
inform clinical decision support and workflow design initiatives
that hope to optimize DMHA referral, engagement, sustained
use, and clinical effectiveness.

Conclusions
To  effectively  implement  DMHA  engagement  and  sustained
use in real-world practice, health systems must develop support
systems  to  identify,  align,  and  tailor  individual  patient  needs
and  preferences  with  the  most  appropriate  DMHA.  Future
research should focus on design of a HCP decision guide that
addresses  clinician  and  patient  awareness,  knowledge,  and
common  misperceptions 
regarding  DMHAs;  optimizes
alignment of patient need, preferences, and DMHA attributes;
encourages  engagement  and  fidelity  to  DMHA  use  for
widespread adoption across health systems; and subsequently
evaluates the impact on mental health outcomes.
