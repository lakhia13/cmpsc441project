Aim: Informal caregivers have an important role in bridging the gap between the
assistance care recipients need and what can be provided by the health care systems
across Europe. The burden of the caregiving role places a signiﬁcant threat to caregiver
health, and the vast majority of caregiver’s report stress and emotional strain, depression,
and increased rates of chronic diseases. In line with this, strengthening the caregiver’s
mental health is one of the main goals for optimal caregiving. Caregivers already struggle
with the demand of their role while coping with health problems, social, family, and
work obligations. The solution for the caregiver’s mental health needs to be accessible,
low cost, and time-effective. This scoping review investigates digital mental health tools
available as a mean of supporting the mental health of caregivers.

Method: Databases searched include Summon search box, the Cochrane Library, and
PubMed. Three groups of keywords were combined: relating to digital mental health
interventions for caregivers, digital mental health interventions and stress in elderly care,
and digital mental health interventions and burden in elderly care.

Results: Caregivers reported that digital mental health tools have an overall positive role
in their health. Coping skills, emotion regulation, skill building, and education are found
to be important aspects of digital mental health tools. There was a noted lack of digital
mental health apps available speciﬁcally for the caregiver of older adults. Furthermore,
the digital mental health tools, divided into three categories in this review, focused either
on building skills or educating caregivers and assisting with the duties rather than the
mental health of the caregiver itself. As repeatedly suggested in the reviewed studies,
digital mental health interventions overall contribute to reducing the caregiver burden
with a limitation of addressing one aspect of caregiver needs –i.e., speciﬁc coping skills
or education regarding illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease and Dementia. The lack of
all-encompassing, data and theory-driven digital mental health tools for addressing and
supporting the caregiver’s mental health is evident.

Keywords: digital mental health interventions, caregivers, stress, burden, elderly care

INTRODUCTION

The rapid aging of the European population is one of the critical
challenges the European social systems are facing today. Current
predictions indicate that the number of individuals above 80
years of age will rise from 4.9% in 2016 to 13% in 2070 (1). The
predicted rise puts social and health systems in Europe to a severe
test and challenges the ﬁscal sustainability of long-term care
while shedding the light on the current demographic changes.
Family pattern changes, a higher number of single households,
participation of women in the labor market, increased workforce
mobility and an increase in retirement age are considered as
important factors adding to the anticipated rise (1). Even though
the existing health care delivery systems address some of the
issues mentioned above, the care gap in the areas such as
realigned reimbursement, team-based care, patient and family
engagement, and information sharing still remain open (2).

Informal care has been generally deﬁned as unpaid care
provided for an older or dependent person with whom the
caregiver has a close relationship such as spouse, parent, child,
relative, friend or a close neighbor (3). The type of help provided
by the informal caregiver varies based on the age, illness, and need
of the care recipient and can include help with the household
chores, running errands, providing transportation to the doctor,
social and emotional support, distributing the medication, and
providing physical care such as bathing and feeding (3, 4).

According to a study carried out by Piette et al. (5),
care recipients with active and involved caregivers have better
self-care and health outcomes than those with less involved
caregivers. Moreover, those care recipients accompanied by the
caregiver to the physician are more likely to discuss challenging
and diﬃcult topics related to their health and issues they are
facing (5). Informal caregivers have an important role in bridging
the gap between what health care systems can provide and the
type of assistance and service the care recipient requires.

The burden of caregiving role includes the vast majority
of diﬃculties reported by the caregivers and can be generally
divided into physical, psychological and ﬁnancial hardship (6).
It is estimated that the informal caregivers spend on the average
24.4 h a week providing care, and this doubles to 44.6 h per week
in cases where the care recipient is a spouse or a partner (7). The
amount of care provided mostly depends on the care recipient—
caregiver relationship—e.g., spouse, parent, sibling, friend—and
the living arrangements between the two. Caregiving role comes
with diverse challenges, and many of those put caregivers at risk
of mental health problems (7–10) and even increased risk of
mortality through the development of severe chronic conditions.
Primary sources of caregiver burden include lack of
support network, not using formal and informal services
for the caregivers, problem behaviors of the care recipients
and insuﬃcient or overwhelmed coping skills (11). Stress,
lead to burnout, which
depression, and burden overall

also result in early institutionalization of the care recipient (12).
However, the termination of caregiving does not end with the
institutionalization of the care recipient into a nursing home.

Digital Tools for Caregivers

In fact, it has been noted that the responsibilities often increase
since the attention at that point must be given to nursing home
staﬀ at ensuring they provide appropriate care in the absence of
any family member (12). The caregiving role usually terminates
when the care recipient has passed away. It has been suggested
that the caregiving cycle might be repeated for the caregiver with
another family member or relative (12).

The available interventions for informal caregivers fall into
three main categories: respite, psychosocial interventions, and
information and communication technology (ICT) support (13).
Respite services provide the caregiver with a temporary break
from the caregiving role and allow the caregiver time to rest
and improve the well-being. The respite care, that temporarily
overtakes the caregiving duties, has an overall positive impact
on caregivers’ burden after 2–3 months follow up (14). The
psychosocial support interventions target the caregivers’ ability
to improve the management of caregiving situations. These
interventions can be delivered either individually or as group
support and are generally successful at providing caregivers
with appropriate coping skills and strategies to deal with the
demands of the role (15). The ﬁnal category of interventions
is ICT-based options for informal caregivers, such as digital
educational platforms, and support services for stress, anxiety,
and depression (16).

The ICT support provided for improving health, well-being,
and health care are referred to as eHealth (17). Although terms
such as eHealth, eHealth technology, eHealth interventions,
health informatics, and behavior change interventions are used in
the ﬁeld of eHealth interventions, and often interchangeably. In
this paper the term eHealth is used to refer to the digital support
–i.e., mobile apps, web-based platforms, virtual reality, etc.—that
delivers digital interventions or relevant educational content.

eHealth can enhance access to care, the empowerment of the
patients and the healthy individuals, the innovation in health care
and the new perspective on well-being. In order for an eHealth
intervention to be considered successful, besides the theoretical
aspect, behavioral modiﬁcation background, and persuasiveness,
it must be available regardless of the time and space, provide
empowerment to people by allowing them more control of
their healthcare, be a catalyst for innovation in healthcare and
maintain the quality of care (17).

With respect

to the numerous deﬁnitions and papers
produced up to date, only a few colleagues (17, 18) provided
a structured categorization of eHealth by oﬀering three
diﬀerent categories:

• Categorizing eHealth technologies according to the position

they maintain in the healthcare continuum

• Categorizing

eHealth

technologies

according

to

the

characteristics of the technology

• Categorizing eHealth technologies according to their inﬂuence

on the health-care systems.

The eHealth categorization reveals how broad the ﬁeld of eHealth
is and the range of services and inﬂuences it can cover. However,
for the purpose of this review the concept of eHealth is framed in
terms of digital mental health tools, and narrowed down only to

Digital Tools for Caregivers

the digital tools—i.e., any technological and digital device used to
distribute mental help interventions through mobile apps, web-
based platforms, virtual reality, etc.—used to provide support and
help manage health of the informal caregivers.

An increasing number of systematic reviews support the
potential digital mental health tools hold for improving informal
caregivers’ well-being (19). Generally, it is suggested that web and
smartphone-based interventions for caregiver populations may
oﬀer convenient, low-cost alternatives to visiting mental health
professionals in weekly sessions or group settings. Technology-
based interventions can be used at any time the caregiver
is available. Furthermore, digital mental health tools can be
personalized to address multiple issues that caregivers face on a
day to day basis.

The purpose of this review is to investigate and thematically
synthesize the existing literature, in order to understand the
state of the art digital mental health tools for managing burden,
stress, and overall adverse mental health outcomes for the
informal caregivers. This scoping review is focusing on digital
mental health tools available for the informal caregivers of older
adults, with the important distinction of excluding caregivers
of individuals with cancer. Namely, caregivers of people with
cancer face challenges that can be distinguished from other
caregiving roles (20). More speciﬁcally, they spend more time
in their caregiving role, with care recipients experiencing more
variability in symptoms and toxicities from diﬀerent, multi-
modal therapies which might lead to rapid health deterioration
during a short period of time. In this sense, the caregivers of
individuals with cancer are usually required to monitor the
patient’s health status frequently and in diﬀerent ways than other
caregivers, and use technical and psychosocial skills to promote
care recipients’ health (21). Therefore, digital mental health tools
for the caregiver of an individual with cancer, unlike the digital
mental health tools for the caregivers in general, must be tailored
to provide a combination of speciﬁc skills set, coping skills and
emotional regulation techniques.

This review does not individually assess the quality of the
interventions used in each reviewed study, but rather explores
and categorizes digital tools available to deliver the mental
health interventions for informal caregivers. Moreover, another
important note is that interventions for diﬀerent health problems
will not be explored since the variety of health problems
experienced by caregivers ranges from physical to mental health
problems and the number of interventions included would
require broadening the research question and the aim of
this review.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data Sources and Search Strategy
The
electronic database Summon box (2016–2019) was
searched to identify the existing reviews on the topic. The
databases, including PubMed (2016–2019), and the Cochrane
searched by combining three

articles were initially reviewed by the title and the abstract
to ﬁnd potentially relevant papers and exclude irrelevant
ones. Relevant articles,
that contained the keywords and
clearly demonstrated in the abstract that the focus of the
paper is on informal caregivers and digital tools available for
them, were assessed against the inclusion criteria. Reference
lists of relevant articles were reviewed to identify possible
additional papers.

Study Selection
Eligibility Criteria
We included (a) randomized controlled trials and observational
studies which (b) investigated digital mental health tools available
for informal caregivers or informal caregivers-care recipients
dyads but oﬀering support for the caregivers delivered via
tablet, virtual reality
(c) mobile app, website or platform,
and mixed approach with web-based interventions combined
with telehealth (d) aiming to reduced stress, burden, and
adverse mental health outcomes and improve health and
well-being of the informal caregiver. The trials and studies
must have included (e) an adult population (≥18 years)
with a preferable population (≥50 years) since the informal
caregivers are statistically population above 50 years of age.
We (f)
focused on published peer-reviewed articles only,
in English.

Digital mental health tools were deﬁned as interventions and
educational material provided for informal caregivers via mobile
app, computers, tablets, virtual reality, and a mixture of tools such
as mobile app and telehealth.

Inclusion Criteria

following

(I) studies published in academic and peer-reviewed journals,
(II) studies that are either quantitative or qualitative, (III) studies
that answer “yes” to three screening questions, and (IV) studies
published in English.

Screening questions:

1. Does the study address the use of digital mental health tools?
2. Does the study address digital mental health interventions?
3. Does the study include a caregiver—i.e., formal or informal—
or digital mental health tool applicable to the caregiver adverse
mental health outcomes –i.e., stress, burden, depression,
and coping skills.

Exclusion Criteria
The following categories of studies excluded:

- articles that did not address digital mental health tools;
- articles that did not include digital mental health content and

digital mental health support;

- articles that included caregiver but maintained a focus on care
recipient, without addressing the digital mental health tools for
supporting caregiver’s health;

review (Figure 2) aimed to identify the studies that meet the
inclusion criteria. Relevant studies were sorted and organized
with the Zotero 4.0 software for further review. Full articles were

reviewed to extract details about the study population, sample
size, type of digital mental health tool, digital mental health
intervention, and intervention outcomes (Table 1), conventional
and novel ﬁndings.

The reviewed studies were categorized according to the digital
mental health tool used to deliver mental health intervention and
support. Three categories included:

• Mobile apps
• Web-based
• Other digital tools.

The mobile apps category included all the relevant studies
that addressed digital mental health support delivered via
mobile-app for caregivers or apps addressing general adverse
mental health symptoms relevant
to caregivers. The web-
based category gathered all the studies that included digital
mental health support delivered to the caregiver in the form
of web-based intervention, web-platform, with or without
internet connection needed and web-based video programs or
training. The ﬁnal category of other digital mental health tools
contains a study that reviewed virtual reality (VR) training for
caregivers and telehealth content for caregiver-care recipient
dyads combined with the data tracking by the master’s level
mental health practitioner.

The study result sections within each category were coded
and thematically synthesized in order to gain a better perspective
about the aim and purpose of each category and the method
or intervention used to address the caregiver’s adverse mental
health symptoms. The categories were then compared and
critically evaluated.

RESULTS

A total of 1,843 relevant non-duplicate records were identiﬁed.
After applying exclusion criteria, 47 articles were retrieved
eligible for full-text screening. Of those, 20 articles met the
inclusion criteria, however,
four were excluded during the
data extraction due to the insuﬃcient description of the study
participants resulting in the unclear understanding if the study
focused on the caregiver or digital mental health tool that can be
used by the caregiver, vague description of procedure or limited
report of the results. Out of 16 ﬁnal articles with four RCT,
two were mixed-methods, two were qualitative, and thirteen
were quantitative studies. Summary of the results, including the
authors, population, digital mental health tool or intervention,
and the relevant intervention outcomes are provided in Table 1.
The reviewed studies providing a comprehensive insight into the
digital mental health tools available for the informal caregivers
were distinguished by three categories.

The categories included: mobile apps, web-based, and others,
and were determined by the device used to support the digital
mental health content for the caregivers.

cope, stress, depression, self-regulation, behavior change, self-
control—that were further grouped into themes of “coping skills”
and “emotional self-regulation.” This review suggests that the
overall aim of the mobile apps category is centered on building
coping and emotional regulation skills of a caregiver as means for
dealing with the caregiving burden, stress and adverse emotions
in general. The pre-post measurements available in three studies
(22, 25, 27) indicated that the mobile apps helped decreased
stress and increased coping skills after only 3 weeks, moreover,
there was a reported signiﬁcant positive impact on decreasing
depressive symptoms of the caregivers and signiﬁcant positive
eﬀect on emotional and social competency. The mobile apps
category includes studies reﬂecting on apps that are designed
for the caregivers speciﬁcally (e.g., iCare, RX Reﬁll, Journal,
Care4Caregivers, UnderstandAid, CareHeroes) and three mobile
apps for dealing with adverse mental health symptoms in general,
building emotional self-regulation, and the review of self-help
apps -VA Pain Coach, VA PTSD Coach, DarmaLife Program,
Mindify, Happify—(22, 23, 27).

Web-Based Category
six studies
focused on web-
In the web-based category,
(8–11, 28, 31). The thematic
based mental health tools
analysis of the result section of the studies indicated recurring
topics—e.g., education, information, exercising skills, resilience,
training, coping, and distress—merged into more general themes
of “education” and “skill building.” The thematic synthesis
indicated that the reviewed web-based digital mental health
tools for caregivers aim to address caregiving burden and
adverse mental health outcomes by educating caregivers about
speciﬁc disorders and training proper skills for speciﬁc disorders
the caregiving role. The web-based digital
necessary for
mental health tools were delivered in the form of video-
educational programs, webnovela—i.e., intervention delivered
through structured episodes in a form of small series similar to
sitcoms—providing mindfulness-based stress reduction training
via a web-based platform, and attention tasks via websites. One
web-based mental health tool, CareHeroes, was an adapted web
version of a previously reviewed tool in the mobile app category.

Category of “Other” Digital Tools
The third category of “other” includes the ﬁnal three studies
exploring digital mental health tools that could not be classiﬁed
as mobile apps or web-based mental health tools (5, 29,
30). The mental health tools in question are virtual reality
intervention,
telephone-delivered intervention for caregiver-
care recipient dyads, and combined digital mental health
intervention with “CarePartner” systematic monitoring with
interactive voice response call for caregivers living outside of the
care recipient home.

DISCUSSION

Mobile Apps Category
The mobile apps category includes eight reviewed studies with
the main focus on mobile-based mental health tools—i.e., mobile
apps (7, 11, 22–27). The thematic analysis of the result sections
within the mobile category indicated reappearing topics—e.g.,

This review aimed to explore the current state of the art
digital mental health tools for informal caregivers used as an
intervention, support, means of education, and training, that
could provide set of skills necessary for an individual to maintain
health and well-being while fulﬁlling the role of a caregiver.

The review seeks to understand means by which current digital
mental health content available for the informal caregivers
is delivered (e.g., via mobile phone, web page, tablet, virtual
reality) and purpose these mental health tools are used for
(e.g., intervention, training, education, support). The further
exploration of the intervention was not performed since the
scope of this paper is to review the tools used for distributing the
mental health content related to the caregivers.

The thematic synthesis of the data indicated that the digital
mental health tools currently available for caregivers could be
broadly categorized as mobile apps, web-based, and other digital
mental health tools—i.e., digital mental health tools that do not
ﬁt the ﬁrst two categories. It is suggested that each category serves
a diﬀerent purpose.

• Mobile apps generally address adverse mental health by
building skills, such as coping skills and emotional self-
regulation, necessary for the caregivers to maintain well-being.
• The web-based mental health tools serve an overall purpose of
educating and informing caregivers about the caregiving role
and providing skill exercise and training for the caregivers.
• The third category of “other” digital mental health tools
includes virtual reality intervention for the caregiver of
individuals with Dementia, telephone-delivered intervention
combined with digital mental health tool and mental health
intervention with systematic monitoring and voice response
designed for caregivers living away from the care recipients.
This category includes digital mental health tools that address
caregiver understanding of the care recipient and caregiver-
care recipient communication, and although these digital
mental health tools can be useful in improving caregiver’s
mental health by strengthening the caregiving role, they do not
speciﬁcally address adverse mental health symptoms.

It can be suggested that the vast majority of mobile apps reviewed
provide skill building for caregivers, while the web-based digital
mental health tools provide skill training or skills exercising,
and education, pointing out that one does not exclude the

other, suggesting that they can be used jointly. Therefore,
combining the digital tools can lead to creating a useful mixed
tool for addressing the caregiver’s mental health, burden, and
stress at the more general level regardless of the limitations
or illness of the care recipient. On the other hand, it can be
argued that combining digital mental health tools can be rather
overwhelming and burdening for the caregivers in terms of the
information exposure and the time amount it would require from
the caregiver.

The quality of the therapeutic basis of the mental health
interventions provided through mobile apps reviewed in this
paper has not been assessed. In fact, brief literature searches
for papers assessing the therapeutic quality of the interventions
provided through mobile apps has been rather scarce and often
requires narrowing the search to a speciﬁc mental health issue.
Some studies pointed out high-quality scores for mobile app
interventions based on engagement, functionality, and aesthetics,
as well as the potential to increase access to mental health services
(32, 33). However, other studies simply provided guidelines
and versions of protocols for assessing the quality of mobile
app interventions for health care providers (34), without clear
understanding about the protocols that need to be followed when
creating mobile health apps in the ﬁrst place (35).

The summary of the relevant studies in this review suggests
general positive outcomes for caregivers after using the digital
mental health tool with a reported increase in coping skills or
emotional regulation (8, 10, 22, 27, 31), a decrease in stress,
and burden (7, 22, 31) as well as perceived improvements in
motivation to care (23). There were no adverse eﬀects of digital
mental health tools reported, even in the population that had low
familiarity with technology, which might be further argued as
a limitation. In line with this, the positive outcomes have been
reported cross-sectionally in most studies with no longitudinal
data available, pointing out that the positive outcomes might be
only temporary.

Digital mental health tools were reported as useful for the
caregivers that experienced higher burden and stress and were

Digital Tools for Caregivers

generally in more distress due to caregiving tasks (24). It has been
shown that culturally-adapted digital tools are the right approach
for educating caregivers, improving coping skills and motivation
to care (10).

There was an evident lack of digital mental health tools aiming
to support the mental health of the caregivers of older care
recipients with overall 44 apps promoted on the market as such,
while only eight of these addressed additional categories besides
information and resources, communication and caregiver-
recipient interaction (7). Furthermore, the majority of digital
mental health tools are strongly focused on improving the
caregiving role itself, which beneﬁts care-recipients the most.

The digital

tools available center on speciﬁc limitations
or illnesses such as Dementia or Parkinson’s disease, without
oﬀering the all-encompassing digital mental health tool for
caregivers. Namely, a caregiver of an elderly individual without
speciﬁc limitations or health issues might not beneﬁt from a
digital mental health tool designed for the caregiver of the
individual with Alzheimer’s disease and vice-versa. Most of
the digital mental health tools cannot be applied in all-case
scenarios. This leaves the caregiver of older people, with physical
limitations but not speciﬁc mental health diﬃculty, outside of the
research focus.

After using some of the digital mental health tools reviewed
in this study, caregivers reported openness and interest in this
type of technology (24), pointing out the potential interest by the
caregivers to expand the knowledge and use the technology. The
evident lack of digital interventions for caregivers goes in line
with the lack of research data and literature exploring the speciﬁc
issue. Current literature on caregiving is aiming to improve care
recipients’ well-being and explore the steps that can be taken
by caregivers in order to further improve the quality of life and
quality of care for the care recipients. Caregivers, on the other
hand, seem to be the disregarded majority.

The reviewed studies reported that the caregivers, when asked
to, were able to provide suggestions and describe the digital
mental health technology they need in order to improve their
well-being. This indicates that there is a clear lack of practical
approach in creating digital mental health tools, content, and
interventions, by simply involving caregivers in the creation of
technology intended for them. In line with this, the development
of digital mental health tools such as digital mental health
intervention or generally positive technology for dealing with
caregiver burden, besides scientiﬁc theoretical background, may
also include caregiver suggestions and preferences since they have
the most experience with caregiving and the mental health needs
they develop over a course of role.

The main literature gap in this area of research is mostly
centered around the lack of conclusive evidence and clear
explanations regarding the eﬀectiveness and therapeutic design
in existing digital mental health tools addressing adverse
mental health issues caregivers face throughout
their role.
Out of 16 reviewed papers, only a small portion provided
clear the therapeutic rationale behind the interventions used.
Furthermore, there is an evident gap in the population samples
when it comes to the caregivers of older adults. Although
informal caregivers of elderly individuals are a rather vast group,
faced with similar diﬃculties of the caregiving role, it can be quite

diﬃcult to address numerous negative mental health issues with
just one digital mental health tool. As noted during this review
as well, studies generally focus on speciﬁc limitations or illness
of the care recipient rarely including or directly addressing the
caregiver. The noted lack of digital mental health interventions
available for the caregivers of elderly individuals can also be one
of the possible explanations for the literature gap in population
samples earlier mentioned.

Even though numerous digital mental health interventions
are available on the market, only a small portion can address
adverse mental health eﬀects of the caregiving role speciﬁcally.
There is a grave need for the digital mental health tool designed
for caregivers of elderly people that can cover a variety of needs
caregivers experience in diﬀerent stages of their role. In other
words, a digital mental health tool for caregivers should provide
caregivers with the deeper meaning-making and understanding
of the caregiving role regardless if they joined the role voluntarily
or were forced to due to the lack of alternative caregiver. A better
understanding of the role eﬀect on the caregiver’s life and life
adjustments that took place to accommodate the caregiving role
must be taken into consideration. The eﬀects of the role should
be considered as an important factor that can provide insight
and possibly be the predictor of the symptomatology hence could
be utilized for the development of the preventive digital mental
health tools and content.

The majority of mobile apps, web-based interventions,
and other categories of digital mental health tools reviewed,
for addressing caregiver stress, are based on the grounds
of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Stress Inoculation
Training (SIT). In other words, the delivered digital interventions
had a therapeutic background focused on readjusting cognitive
patterns related to the adverse mental health eﬀects of the
caregiving role. In this way, the interventions were used to
shift the emotional well-being of the caregivers or build up
stress resilience by preparing the caregivers for adverse mental
health eﬀects of the caregiving role through skills training and
educational material. The therapeutic background of several
reviewed studies was not clearly deﬁned and it reﬂects the general
literature gap in the therapeutic rationale for digital mental health
tools available for the caregivers.

It can be suggested that current digital mental health
tools available for caregivers have been somewhat successful
at targeting adverse mental health outcomes arising from the
caregiving role with noted lack of structure, approach and
therapeutic background of interventions. The necessity for a
structured digital mental health tool for caregivers with clear
theory, protocols, and frameworks is evident in cases where the
caregiver is providing care for the recipient that has no speciﬁc
mental or physical disability.

This scoping review is conducted in order to explore digital
mental health tools available for informal caregivers. It is meant
to add up to the eﬀorts of other colleagues in ﬁlling in the
literature gap in informal caregiving and digital mental health
research. The results indicated several important points that
can be used in further reviews, as well as important points
that can guide future digital mental health tools development.
These points include important aspects that were successfully
included in the digital mental health tools reviewed: coping

skills, emotional self-regulation, education, skill-building, and
skill training.

In other words, caregivers beneﬁted and showed improved
well-being, lowered levels of stress and burden and increased
emotional regulation after they were educated about
the
caregiving role, and they were given certain skills to manage their
mental health and well-being while providing care. Teaching
caregivers coping skills and emotional self-regulation is an
important aspect of the reviewed digital mental health tools and
can be argued as an important factor in the overall positive results
achieved in the studies reviewed. Another important aspect of
digital mental health tools noted in numerous studies reviewed
is that they provided a space for caregivers to train or exercise the
skills they have acquired, therefore obtaining good mastery over
the skills taught. It can be suggested that this allowed caregivers
to maintain certain resilience toward stressful events and overall
role burden.

LIMITATIONS

The lack of clear guidance about the eﬃcacy of the mental health
interventions delivered via digital tools explored in this review
is considered the main limitation of this review. Namely, the
majority of reviewed studies emphasized the eﬀectiveness and
success of the digital tool without reﬂecting on the therapeutic
background or rationale for using a speciﬁc therapeutic approach
for certain mental health issues. Although this review explored
the usability of digital mental health tools among caregivers of
older adults and the types of digital mental health tools currently
available, it cannot provide any deﬁnitive conclusion about the
eﬃcacy of the interventions distributed through digital mental
health tools as well as the caregivers’ preferences when it comes
to the type of digital mental health tools available. It could be the
case that the interventions that had higher therapeutic potential
were delivered in a way that was less convenient for the caregiver
or the digital mental health tool used was not the best option for
delivering the speciﬁc intervention.

Although several studies reported the success of digital mental
health tools used, there was no clear checklist followed, and only
one study provided follow-up results. Moreover, the comparison
between the digital mental health tools available has not been
made in any papers, therefore it cannot deﬁnitively be concluded
that one digital mental health tool or a speciﬁc type of technology
is more successful than the other. For instance, the educational
intervention in a form of Webnovela “Mirella” for Hispanic
caregivers was rather successful at providing a set of skills that
caregivers reported as useful in their caregiving role. However,

there is no clear indication if this intervention could be equally,

such as mobile phones, tablets, web, or even as a VR experience.
Finally, the number of papers exploring the digital mental health
tools for caregivers is still quite limited which prevents a clear
insight into the topic.

Despite its limitations, this review noted numerous positive
aspects and suggests that digital mental health tools can be
an inexpensive, easily accessible, and time-saving option for
addressing the caregiver burden and mental health. There
is a need for further improvements and development of
commercialized digital mental health tools that will be science-
based but caregiver tailored. Moreover, it can be suggested that
further development should include pilot testing over diﬀerent
platforms and by using diﬀerent tools in order to establish
the optimal digital tool for each mental health intervention or
caregiver-tailored content.
