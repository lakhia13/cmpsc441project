Simple Summary: Animal-assisted therapy is a rehabilitation and treatment procedure that uses
trained animals to help people cope with difﬁcult situations in addition to other therapeutic inter-
ventions. The most commonly used animals are dogs and horses. The current study analyzes the
beneﬁts of dog-assisted therapy in a pediatric population attending a mental health day hospital. This
program was associated with positive impacts on factors including reduced emotional and behavioral
outbursts and improved socialization behavior observed by therapists in the day hospital setting.
Whereas the parents did not observe signiﬁcant improvements outside the unit. Attendance rate and
commitment to treatment also improved. According to the impressions of the health professionals,
the dog-assisted therapy facilitated the motivation of the patients to therapy and improved the
atmosphere of the unit. Dog-assisted therapy is a promising intervention that beneﬁts children
with mental health disorders, their families and mental health professionals. Its implementation is
necessary as a complementary program of the treatment at a psychiatric day hospital.

Abstract: Dog-assisted therapy (DAT) has shown beneﬁts in people with mental health disorders. A
child psychiatric day hospital would be a suitable setting to implement DAT and evaluate the beneﬁts
in a pediatric population. Methods: Mixed methods research in a naturalistic setting was considered
in this pre-post quantitative study including 23 children under 13 treated in a day hospital over 2 years.
Quantitative analysis included the number of emotional and behavioral outbursts and attendance rate
and self-control and social impairment questionnaires completed by family members and therapists.
In the qualitative study, the experiences of 12 mental health professionals involved in DAT were
documented through semi-structured interviews. Results: On DAT days, there were fewer emotional
and behavioral outbursts and higher attendance. Signiﬁcant differences were obtained between pre-
and post-test scores on the SCRS and the SRS-2 completed by the therapists, while no signiﬁcant
differences were obtained on the questionnaires completed by the parents. Observations based on
the qualitative study were as follows: (1) DAT improves emotional self-regulation; (2) DAT could
facilitate the work of therapists in day hospitals; (3) health professionals displayed uncertainty due to
a lack of familiarity with DAT. Conclusions: DAT improved emotional self-regulation, attendance
rate and self-control and social response in children with mental disorders attending a day hospital.

is suffering from a severe mental disorder (SMD), a more intense treatment in outpatient
partial hospitalization services, called a day hospital (DH), may be necessary [1].

The treatment at a DH is intensive and rehabilitative and it is based on an individ-
ualized treatment plan that takes into consideration the speciﬁc needs of the patient [2].
It is conducted by a team using an interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach. It is
less restrictive in terms of admission than an inpatient psychiatric ward. The treatment,
however, is more intensive than that in an outpatient unit. The objective is to provide
the patient with a structure and an intensiﬁcation of the therapeutic intervention that
facilitates improving their psychopathological stability while favoring their integration into
the community in a safe way.

Patients attending a DH present a wide variety of psychopathological disorders:
neurodevelopmental disorders (autism syndrome disorder (ASD), attention deﬁcit hy-
peractivity disorder (ADHD), etc), attachment disorders, behavioral disorders, affective
disorders, self-harm and suicidal behavior, incipient psychosis and symptomatology that
can evolve into a personality disorder. In such disorders, problems may include: low
self-esteem, problems in establishing social bonds with others (isolation, over possessive
relationships, overzealousness in relationships, dominance in relationships or excessively
submissive attitudes), difﬁculty in expressing emotions and regulating them (difﬁculty
in identifying feelings, difﬁculty in expressing them correctly, and great difﬁculty in con-
trolling anger and frustration), difﬁculty in following instructions, difﬁculty in generating
self-instructions to redirect their own behaviors and lack of motivation.

Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is a rehabilitation and treatment procedure that uses
trained animals to help patients cope with certain situations in a complementary way
to other therapeutic interventions [3,4]. The most commonly used animals are dogs and
horses [5,6].

Previous studies of ATT in young mental health populations [7,8], have investigated
the positive inﬂuence on psychological, physiological and behavioral well-being [9–11].
Speciﬁcally, AAT has been used successfully to treat people suffering from mental disorders
such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [12], ASD [13,14], ADHD [15], depression
and anxiety [16,17]. There is evidence conﬁrming that AAT is associated with a reduction
in stress and an increase in positive emotions [18]. Likewise, it has been shown to be
a self-esteem enhancer, a catalyst for mood improvement [19] and a facilitator of social
interactions [20]. In addition, AAT, speciﬁcally dog-assisted therapy (DAT), has been
found to beneﬁt the well being of healthcare professionals by improving the hospital
atmosphere [21] and reducing perceived stress by staff [22].

One study showed similar ﬁndings in an inpatient pediatric mental health service [23],
but no studies to date have been performed in an intensive community mental health
program such as a Day Hospital for children and adolescents. For this reason, further
research is needed to investigate the feasibility and the beneﬁts of the incorporation of the
DAT within the DH environment.

The present study was designed to assess the feasibility and the beneﬁt of DAT on
children suffering from mental disorders who are attending DH. The following hypotheses
were raised: (1) DAT will improve the self-control and social skills of children suffering
from a mental disorder during DH therapeutic activities. (2) DAT will facilitate patients in
achieving their goals within the DH framework.

2. Methods

Mixed methodology with a naturalistic setting [24], combining quantitative and quali-

tative research, was carried out in order to strengthen the conclusions of the study.

The quantitative study included children under 13 years old who were assessed before
and after DAT treatment at a DH, with a comparison of attendance rate and emotional
outburst between DAT versus and non-DAT therapy days. In the qualitative study, a
hermeneutic phenomenology [25] was applied, describing the experiences of health profes-
sionals with the incorporation of DAT and its impact on work at the DH.

2.1. DAT Intervention

Children under the age of 13 come to DH on Tuesday and Thursday for individualized
treatment. DAT is included in the DH activities only on Thursdays. There was no DAT
offered on Tuesdays. The DAT was used by professionals of service to carry out group
therapy and weekly individual visits by the therapist to the users who were cited for DH.
The program comprises activities that help to achieve therapeutic objectives which are

categorized into two large blocks:

1.

2.

Creation of the bond (professional, patient and dogs) consisting of three areas:
•

Verbal and non-verbal communication activities. Example: Sharing questions in
relation to the animal and other topics of interest using treats.
Sensory activities that are performed through touching (petting and brushing
the dog).
Low complexity motor activities to observe and work on patient-dog interaction.
In these activities, the child asks the dog to perform skills (shake its paw, high-
ﬁve, make the dog roll over, etc.) and reward the animal, which helps gain
conﬁdence and security.

•

•

Personal development: activities related to taking care of the dogs (hygiene and
feeding), their training, and physical and social-cognitive skills (playing, walking and
emotional communication). All interventions involving activities with the dogs were
adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each patient. Some activities carried out during the
study were as follow:
•

Food activity: the activity consisted of classifying pictures of food according
to whether they were appropriate or not for feeding the dogs. After that, each
patient completed the same classiﬁcation for themselves. Once this classiﬁcation
was completed, the patient described the characteristics of the food (texture, color,
etc. . . . ) that they like or dislike. This is an activity more frequently used for
children with ASD.
Social cognitive activity: in turns, each patient prepared a circuit using balls,
hoops, mats, or cones that the dogs had to perform under supervision of the
professionals. Their companion had to pay attention to and memorize the circuit
in order to describe and imitate it using another dog.
Emotional relaxation and bonding activity: with the dogs lying/resting next to
the patients, they petted the dogs, practiced breathing in sync with the dogs, and
listened to relaxing music in order to create a mindful atmosphere and a calm
state of mind.

•

•

This activity was performed by a specialist trained in dog assisted therapy (ED) and
one of the professional staff from the DH (the staff member had K-Partners recognition and
was certiﬁed in the CDAT method of applying the intervention). In all sessions there was a
member of the research team supervising the interventions.

The wellbeing of the dogs was a priority during the time that the DAT was adminis-
tered (see Appendix A for more information). All sanitary and hygienic protocols of the
Center for Dog-Assisted Therapy, CDAT (Centro de Terapia Asistida por Canes-CTAT)
were followed. The CDAT is a private health care center that specializes in the ﬁeld of dog
training and assisted therapies, with previous experience with the same interventions in
other hospitals in Barcelona.

The entity (CDAT) complies with and applies the IAHAIO white paper document
(reference entity in the application of animal in relation to interventions that unse the
human animal bond). Likewise, the professional comply with the animal welfare standards
dictated by IAHAIO.

In the intervention ﬁve dogs participated in the activities: three medium-sized (two
Golden retrivers and one Labrador retriever, weighing approximately 30 kg) and two small
(Cavalier King Charles spaniels, weighing approximately 12 kg). They were between two

Animals 2022, 12, 2841

and ﬁve years old. All dogs passed a K-Partners for CTAC, physical ﬁtness and therapy
dog qualiﬁcation.

2.2. Phase 1: Quantitative Study
2.2.1. Sample

The study was proposed to 25 patients who attended the DH during January 2020 and
December 2021. All agreed to participate. During the study there were two dropouts (one
by consensus of the therapist and another for not completing the questionnaires). The ﬁnal
sample consisted of 23 participants.

The inclusion criteria were patients under 13 years of age that attending children´s

DH. Patient with low-functioning ASD were excluded.

All subjects were invited to participate in the study. Families were explicitly informed
about the voluntary nature of the study, their rights the procedures, the possible risks and
beneﬁts involved, and the voluntary nature of the study. A WA written consent form was
required from parents or legal guardians; the children gave their consent in writing after
the nature of the procedure was fully explained to them.

Written informed consent was obtained from the participants before starting the study,
which was approved on March 4, 2019, by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 revised in 2000 (reference
numberHCB/2018/0652).

Sociodemographic and clinical variables of the sample were registered (see Table 1).

The emotional and behavioral outbursts of the patients were quantiﬁed during the
2 years of the study (except for a 4 month period during the covid lockdown). In addition,
the DH attendance rate was recorded. The DAT was carried out once a week, such that
a comparison could be made of outbursts and attendance between the DAT days and
non-DAT days.

Families and therapists completed two pre- and two post-treatment questionnaires

about the patients as part of the evaluation process.

The Self-Control Rating Scale (SCRS): This test includes 33 items designed to measure
the extent to which a child’s behavior can be described as self-controlled versus impulsive.
Children with greater self-control difﬁculties are presumed to have a higher score. It is
stated that patients who obtain a score of 160 to 165 or higher are candidates for treatment
to improve self-control. The SCRS has been studied with several samples of children of
primary school age and has shown excellent internal consistency (α = 0.98) and good
stability according to the test retest correlation (r = 0.84, p < 0.05) [26]. In this study, the
experimental version in Spanish by Garcia i Giral M, Berltán S, and Nicolau R. (1990) was
used [27].

The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2): This test is a standardized and referenced
caregiver report questionnaire for documenting patterns of ASD symptomatology. It has
a high sensitivity for detecting milder degrees of social impairment. For the assessment,

Animals 2022, 12, 2841

5 of 12

caregivers are asked to rate 65 items about the subject’s behavior using a Likert scale
from 1 (not true) to 4 (almost always true). The SRS-2 items are grouped into ﬁve factors:
social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation and restricted
interests and repetitive behaviors. This scale has shown cross-cultural validity [28,29].
The SRS-2 form for school-age children has strong psychometric properties in clinical and
nonclinical standardization samples. The internal consistency and reliability are α = 0.95
and 0.97, respectively. The SRS-2 items were adapted to the Spanish language following
the guidelines proposed by Muñiz [30].

2.2.3. Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the so-
ciodemographic characteristics of the participants and the research variables. For the
questionnaires, the mean and range of scores were calculated. Differences in scores before
and after treatment and between attendance and emotional outburst between DAT days vs,
none were analyzed using paired sample t-test.

2.3. Phase 2: Qualitative Study
2.3.1. Sample of Health Professionals

In the qualitative study, a convenience sampling was performed, in which a sample
of professionals working at the DH was selected (n = 12; see Table 2). These health care
professionals were involved in the DAT and signed an informed consent to participate. The
health care professionals were clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, mental health nurse
specialists, social workers, and psychology and nursing residents (Table 2). Interviews
were conducted by the research team.

2.3.2. Assessment

The principal research instrument was a semi-structured interview (in Spanish) follow-
ing the structure of previous publications [31,32]. The interviewer encouraged the health
care professionals to talk about their experiences with DAT. All interviews were conducted
face-to-face and audio recorded. These interviews were transcribed and subsequently veri-
ﬁed by the professionals interviewed. The participating health care professionals signed
the informed consent to record the interviews. Each interview lasted approximately 30 min.
Data collection and analysis continued until theoretical saturation was reached, i.e., the
additional interviews did not provide new insights for the analysis. Information was also
obtained from notes made by the principal investigator.

2.3.3. Analysis

The analysis of this study was carried out using these four steps: (1) open coding where
the main researcher read each transcript of each interview line by line, recording notes
to determine the categories; (2) the principal researcher together with another researcher
reviewed and discussed the main topics; (3) axial coding, where all interviews are read a
second time and both researchers detected the associations between themes and sub-themes

Animals 2022, 12, 2841

6 of 12

related to the context and content. They related all transcripts of the completed interviews
to strengthen meanings and arrive at a theoretical construct; (4) integration, where the
central themes or main categories that emerge from the data were conceptually reordered
and put back into context [33].

3. Results
3.1. Results of the Quantitative Study

Twenty-three boys and girls (mean age 10.33, range 7–13 years) participated in the

quantitative study. 48% (11 out of 23) had ASD and 17% had a conduct disorder.

Results showed statistically signiﬁcant differences in attendance rates between the
days in which DAT was carried out vs. not. Speciﬁcally, attendance on DAT-days
(M = 98.04; SD = 2.21) was higher than attendance on days that DAT was not perfomed
(M = 92.3; SD = 10.78) (t(20) = 2.6, p = 0.016.

Regarding emotional outbursts, there were statistically signiﬁcant differences on the
days that the DAT was performed vs. those that the DAT was not performed, where the
scores on the latter (M = 1.71; SD = 2.49) were greater than those on the former (M = 0.48;
SD = 0.68) t(20) = −2.77, p = 0.012).

As shown in Figures 1 and 2, there were statistically signiﬁcant differences in the mean
scores before and after treatment in the SCRS [132.5 vs. 110.83, t(22) = −2.88, p = 0.009)] and
in the SRS [t(22) = 2.81; p = 0.010] ﬁlled out by the therapists. The questionnaires completed
by the parents or legal guardians did not show signiﬁcant differences before and after
treatment. Figures 1 and 2 present the data.

3.2. Results of the Qualitative Phase

The qualitative study allowed us to make three main observations: (1) DAT improved
emotional self-regulation; (2) DAT could facilitate the therapists’ work at the DH; (3) the
health professionals displayed a sense of uncertainty due to their lack of familiarity with
this type of therapy.

Observation 1. DAT improved emotional self-regulation in children undergoing DH treatment:
“Patients activate fewer defenses in the presence of dogs”.

Nine of the 12 health professionals stated that DAT helped to improve some aspects of

emotional regulation and management.

“I have worked mostly with groups, and with DAT I observed that the patients’
defenses and resistance were lowered, therefore, it was easier to work with them.
At a therapeutic level, they are calmer and trust the therapists more. Another
aspect that I think is also important to highlight is the work climate that day
was calmer, not only for patients but also for DH professionals. I think that also
inﬂuenced the patients themselves”.

Research participants described situations with patients in which the intervention

with animals helped emotional self-regulation.

“I also remember a girl diagnosed with attachment disorder who was experienc-
ing psychomotor agitation at the time her mother was leaving. The dog appeared
and calmed her down. It was restorative for her”.

Observation 2. DAT could facilitate the therapists’ work at the DH: “the therapy mad individual
and group sessions with patients easier”.

The 12 participants of the qualitative study described how DAT aided them in their

work at the DH.

“DAT has helped us work through and improve the technique of exposure with
response prevention. The dogs have made it easier for the patient to approach
situations that generated a lot of anxiety”.

“In therapy, dogs act as facilitators they are simply there and do not judge. I
believe that this helps the patients feel more comfortable. They improve at a
behavioral level and at an emotional level. They are more relaxed”.

Animals 2022, 12, 2841

An important element that the research participants mentioned in DAT meetings is
that it helped improve the atmosphere at the DH unit. This promoted a warm environment.

“DAT creates a more relaxed atmosphere. This allows us to delve into certain
aspects that cannot be addressed on a more normative visit”.

Some of the research participants also said that DAT helped improve the patient’s

bond with the DH team.

“The atmosphere that was generated during the sessions was very pleasant and I
think it can be useful to improve treatment and the therapeutic relationship.”

“I remember working with a patient. The therapeutic relationship with her was
not going well, and she was not having a good time, so I suggested that she come
in for DAT. We did three sessions, the patient and her mother participated, and it
went very well, I think she was more motivated to come to the hospital and the
therapeutic relationship also improved”.

Four research participants observed a positive change in the social interaction between

the patient and the professionals.

“The whole issue of social interaction has improved a lot, especially in my unit,
which works with children with autism and is one of the most affected psy-
chopathological areas. The main issues are social interaction and communication.
We have come across children who had no way of expressing themselves and
yet through DAT and treating the dog as if it were this third person, we have
managed to detect situations of bullying they had suffered”.

Observation 3. The health professionals had a sense of uncertainty due to their lack of familiarity
with this type of therapy: “I had not been able to work with this type of therapy before and I did not
know exactly how it worked”.

Most of the research participants did know about DAT, through research studies, social
networks or conversations with other professionals, but many of those interviewed had
never worked with DAT.

“I had not been able to work with this type of therapy before, but if I had heard
of it, it was performed in other units. But I also did not know exactly how it
functioned and how it could inﬂuence the therapeutic process”.

Three professionals reported that they knew and had experience with DAT. They had

worked and/or completed trainings with DAT in care settings other than in the DH.

“Yes, I was aware of DAT, because in another place where I worked in the past,
therapy with dogs was also carried out, but not in the same area as we are now.
Before, I was in the ﬁeld of children with multiple disabilities”.

4. Discussion

This study was designed to assess the feasibility and beneﬁts that DAT may have on
the recovery of children with mental health disorders who attend a DH. To our knowledge,
this was the ﬁrst study to investigate the effects of DAT in children with mental health
disorders within an intensive community program such as a DH. The DAT was carried out
for 2 years and was managed by mental health professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists,
social workers and nurses specialized in mental health care) and the trainer in dog-assisted
interventions.

The results show that the children who participated in the study and received DAT
interventions presented a lower number of emotional and behavioral outbursts during their
DH stay, compared to the days that DAT interventions were not carried out. These results
may be indicators of a better self-control capacity of the boys and girls. In addition, their
attendance rate increased on the days when DAT was performed, improving and facilitating
adherence to therapeutic treatment. Regarding the results of the questionnaires, signiﬁcant

Animals 2022, 12, 2841

9 of 12

differences were observed in the scores of the therapists, in contrast to no differences in the
parents’ reports

The subjective perceptions of the professionals regarding the efﬁcacy of DAT supported
the ﬁndings of the quantitative study. The professionals afﬁrmed that DAT favors bonding,
improves the atmosphere, increases motivation, improves emotional self-regulation and
helps improve communication and thus social interaction.

Parents results about their children’s behaviors were not signiﬁcant. This may be
due to the observed changes being more evident in the Day Hospital setting and were not
generalized outside the scope of DH. However, much remains to be understood about the
non-signiﬁcant ﬁndings according to the parents.

Current hypotheses about the therapeutic beneﬁts of DAT are consistent with the
idea that human interaction with dogs favors the success of therapy [34,35]. Moreover,
developing a bond with an animal helps the participants gain new skills that can lead
to positive changes in cognition and behavior [36]. The beneﬁts and improvement could
be due to the calming effect and reduction in stress associated with the presence of the
animals [37].

Currently, there are studies conﬁrming that dog programs implemented in hospi-
tals are promising complementary interventions that beneﬁt staff, patients and their
families [38,39].

Merriam-Webster deﬁnes “best practice” as “a procedure that research and experi-
ence have shown to produce optimal results and that is established or proposed as an
appropriate standard for widespread adoption” [40]. Therefore, carrying out an effective
DAT intervention as an aspect of health care must be based on scientiﬁc evidence and
demonstrate quality results. DAT must continue to grow and be studied over time in order
to demonstrate its effectiveness as a part of community mental health services.

5. Limitations

This study was carried out in a natural setting in the context of daily clinical care,
which means that neither the therapeutic treatment nor the activity of the unit was modiﬁed.
The implementation of DAT did not imply the cessation of conventional therapies. This
precludes the possibility of demonstrating that the DAT intervention was the sole cause for
the positive results on the self-control and social skills questionnaires.

It is important to note that the scale used was SRS-2 which is usually used for the
diagnosis of ASD, which could have negatively inﬂuenced the efﬁcacy of the quantitative
results of the study. The qualitative study was carried out in order to compensate for some
of the limitations involved in the quantitative study. This is a valid point for the group of
therapists. However, for the parents, only quantitative data were available. Much remains
to be understood about the non-signiﬁcant ﬁndings of this group.

It should be noted that the results obtained in this study are not generalizable outside

the HD setting.

Another unexpected limitation was the appearance of COVID-19. This setback resulted
in a 4 month delay in 2020 and the necessity to comply with new restrictions, such as
limiting the maximum number of participants in the group and the mandatory use of face
masks, which may have been detrimental to human-dog interaction [41].

We view this as a pilot study with the complete understanding that it needs to be
reworked and expanded in order to devise a study with more rigorous methodology in the
future.

6. Conclusions

This mixed methodology study aimed to assess the impact of DAT in a DH and to
describe the experiences of health professionals who incorporate dogs in their work process.
The children who participated in the study and received DAT interventions presented
a lower number of emotional and behavioral outbursts during their stay in the DH unit.
In addition, it was quantiﬁed that the days on which DAT was administered in the unit,

Animals 2022, 12, 2841

10 of 12

the attendance rate of the children improved. The clinicians observed some improvement
in self-control and social skills following the treatment, but this cannot be attributed to
the incorporation of DAT into DH. With the results we obtained, it can be stated that
the incorporation of DAT in DH is feasible. It is necessary to continue developing and
expanding studies with a more rigorous methodology.
