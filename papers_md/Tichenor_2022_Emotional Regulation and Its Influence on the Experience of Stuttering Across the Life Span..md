Purpose: This study evaluated the relationship between emotional regulation (ER)
and adverse impact related to stuttering across the developmental spectrum, in
preschool and school-age children, adolescents, and adults who stutter. An addi-
tional aim examined how these variables relate to the ways that
individuals
approach speaking (i.e., their agreement on whether their goal is to speak fluently).
Method: Participants were the parents of 60 preschoolers and younger school-
age children (ages 3–9 years), 95 school-age children and adolescents who
stutter (ages 7–18 years), and 180 adults who stutter (ages 18–81 years). All
participants completed surveys with age-appropriate measures examining ER
and the adverse impact of stuttering. Older children and adults who stutter also
answered questions regarding their goals when speaking. Multiple regression
and ordinal
logistic regression were used to examine relationships among ER,
adverse impact related to stuttering, and goal when speaking.
Results: In preschool children, adverse impact was significantly predicted by a
parent-reported measure of ER skills; in school-age children and adults, adverse
impact was significantly predicted by measures of the ER strategies cognitive
reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression. Less frequent use of CR by adults
was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of having “not stutter-
ing” as a goal when speaking. Differences in the significance and magnitude of
these relationships were found across the life span.
Discussion: For both children and adults who stutter, ER is a significant factor
related to the adverse impact of stuttering; the relationship between ER and
adverse impact may change over development. Accounting for individual differ-
ences in ER can improve understanding of why a person copes with stuttering
in the ways they do, and this has notable implications for individualizing inter-
vention for both children and adults who stutter.

According to the Modal Model of Emotion (Barrett
et al., 2007; Gross, 1998a), emotions arise when a person
attends to, appraises (evaluates), and responds to their envi-
ronment (Gross, 2014a; Lazarus, 1991). Emotional responses
often influence the environment or situation in which the
original appraisal occurred, and the influenced environment
subsequently initiates further appraisal and further emotional

responses. This loop of attending, appraising, and respond-
ing occurs across “experiential, behavioral, and neurobiologi-
cal systems” (Barrett et al., 2007; Gross, 1998a, 2014a, p. 5).
Although the term is defined differently by different
researchers, emotional regulation (ER) commonly describes
the process by which a person shapes, alters, or otherwise
influences this loop of attending, appraising, and respond-
ing (Gross, 1998b, 2014b). Gross (2014a) described three
core features of ER: activation of a regulatory goal (i.e.,
what a person wants to do or change), selection of a regu-
latory strategy or process (i.e., how a person will accom-
plish this regulatory goal), and modulation of the trajec-
tory or outcome (i.e., monitoring the effectiveness of the
regulation strategy with respect to the goal and making

adjustments in subsequent strategy use). These core fea-
tures of ER, and the Modal Model of Emotion more
broadly, apply to both children and adults, though ER is
a skill that develops throughout childhood and its devel-
opment is influenced by both internal (e.g., cognitive and
temperament) and external (e.g., social, familial, and cul-
tural) factors (see the work of Gross & Cassidy, 2019,
for a review). Some researchers conceptualize regulatory
strategies or processes primarily in terms of effortful or
conscious responses (see the work of Rothbart et al.,
2014); however, others describe how these regulatory
strategies exist on a continuum from “explicit, conscious,
effortful, and controlled…to implicit, unconscious, effort-
less, and automatic” (Gross, 2014a, Gyurak & Etkin,
2014; Gyurak et al., 2011).

Regulatory strategies can be employed before, dur-
ing, or after the situation that triggers the emotional expe-
rience (Gross, 2014b). Specific strategies for ER can
involve situation selection, in which a person engages in
specific actions to increase or decrease the likelihood of
encountering a situation (Livingstone & Isaacowitz, 2015;
Webb et al., 2018), and situation modification, in which a
person directly modifies the circumstances of a situation
before encountering it (Gross, 2014a, 2015). An example
of situation selection would occur when a student avoids
taking a course that requires giving presentations in front
of the class due to a fear of speaking in public. An exam-
ple of situation modification would occur if the student
asks to present first because they recognize that presenting
later would lead to increased fear or anxiety. In-the-
moment regulatory strategies include directly altering how
a person allocates attention during an emotional event
(e.g., by distracting themselves with other thoughts or
focusing on one particular thought), modifying how the
person evaluates the situation (i.e., cognitive reappraisal
[CR]), or inhibiting negative or positive emotions as they
are being experienced (i.e., expressive suppression [ES]).
Regardless of which specific strategy a person chooses to
employ in a given situation, the consensus in the broader
ER literature suggests that healthy ER is viewed as “the
result of flexibly choosing between regulation strategies to
adapt to differing situational demands” (Sheppes, 2014, p.
127; Troy & Mauss, 2011).

The skill of healthy ER develops throughout child-
hood, and the specific ER strategies that a child uses will
change as the child ages (Gross, 2015). One of the earliest
developing strategies is attentional deployment, or the abil-
ity to allocate or direct attention for the specific goal of
influencing an emotional experience (Gross, 2014a). A
common example of attentional deployment is distraction,
defined as any strategy that involves thinking of or attend-
ing to something other than the situation or event that led
to emotional arousal. Attentional deployment develops
for example, research shows that
starting in infancy;

young infants and toddlers can engage or disengage eye
gaze more purposefully as they age (see the work of
Rothbart et al., 2014, for a review). In preschool children,
attentional deployment may take the form of simple
behaviors, such as when children cover their eyes with
their hands
from the emotion-
generating stimuli (Sala et al., 2014). In older children or
adults, attentional deployment strategies may take the
form of recalling memories or positive thoughts specifi-
cally to mitigate the negative emotional upheaval that
they may be experiencing (Gross, 2014a).

to shield themselves

The development of ER is closely related to the
development of temperament in childhood (see the work
of Rothbart et al., 2014, for a discussion). Rothbart and
colleagues (Rothbart, 2011; Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981)
defined temperament as individual differences in reactivity
and self-regulation. In this context, reactivity refers to a
person’s responses to the environment
in motor, emo-
tional, cognitive, and attentional domains
(Rothbart,
2007; Rothbart et al., 2014). Self-regulation refers to
“effortful attention that serves to modulate reactivity and
organize change” (Rothbart et al., 2014, p. 306). When
viewed through the lens of temperament, ER is seen as
“the modulation of a given emotional reaction, its inhibi-
tion, activation, or graded modulation,” which occurs
through effortful control (EC) mechanisms (Rothbart et al.,
2014, p. 306). EC is thereby defined as “the ability to
inhibit a dominant response to perform a subdominant
to detect errors, and to engage in planning”
response,
(Rothbart & Rueda, 2005, p. 3). As EC skills develop, ER
skills improve and children are better able to regulate their
emotions via more flexibly approaching feared situations,
leading them to more effectively inhibit undesired behav-
iors, thoughts, or feelings (Rothbart et al., 2014). EC is
commonly considered to be a relatively stable trait by early
childhood (Rueda, 2012); however, a growing body of
research in adolescents has suggested that EC is still devel-
oping (Laceulle et al., 2012; Vijayakumar et al., 2014). For
example, adolescents and young adults who have significant
adverse life experiences (e.g., poor peer and family environ-
ments)
than peers
(Atherton et al., 2020). Moreover, the ability to adaptively
engage in ER develops in a nonlinear way throughout
childhood (Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2011). This non-
linearity occurs because adolescence is a time of transition,
when adolescents may react more strongly to emotional sit-
uations than younger children (Stroud et al., 2009) while
also experiencing mixed or negative emotions more fre-
quently than adults (Riediger et al., 2014). Yet, children
who are more reactive are less able to affectively regulate
their emotions than children who are less reactive (Van
Beveren et al., 2016). In addition, adults who have lower
levels of negative affect more often use CR strategies, while
individuals with higher levels of negative affect more often

engage in ES strategies (Gross & John, 2003). Thus, indi-
vidual differences in temperament (reactivity and regulation
abilities, as defined by Rothbart and colleagues) have been
shown to influence which specific ER strategies a person is
likely to select.

Notably, ES and CR are two of the ER strategies
that have been most thoroughly studied in individuals
across the life span. ES is the process of “inhibiting ongo-
ing emotion-expressive behavior” (Gross, 1998a; Gross &
John, 2003, p. 349). CR is the process of “construing a
potentially emotion-eliciting situation in a way that
impact” (Gross & John, 2003,
changes its emotional
p. 349; Lazarus & Alfert, 1964). An example of ES would
occur when a person remains outwardly cheerful and
lighthearted even when feeling sad and disappointed as
they interact with a person who turned them down for a
date. An example of CR would occur when the person
feels sad and disappointed about having been rejected but
then recognizes in the moment that the person may have
turned them for a variety of unrelated reasons. The ability
to use both ES and CR strategies develops throughout
childhood (see the works of Gross & Cassidy, 2019;
Silvers, 2020, for reviews). For example, children as young
as 5 years old can be observed to use CR (Sala et al.,
2014); rapidly developing executive functioning skills in
preschool children also enable the concealment of negative
emotions via ES (Gross & Cassidy, 2019; Williams et al.,
2016). Thus, considering the development of ER strategy
use can provide further context and insight into how chil-
dren manage their emotions as they age and experience
other life difficulties.

emotions

Both ES and CR can be beneficial or not, depending
upon the context, time point, and population (see the
works of Gross, 2002; Gross & Thompson, 2007,
for
reviews). Overall, however, ES is typically associated with
experiencing fewer positive
(Gross, 1998a;
Stepper & Strack, 1993) and increased sympathetic ner-
vous system activity (Demaree et al., 2006; Gross, 1998a;
Gross & Levenson, 1993, 1997; Harris, 2001; Richards &
Gross, 2000). Individuals who more often use ES as a reg-
ulation strategy experience more negative emotions and
even characteristics of depression (Gross & John, 2003;
Moore et al., 2008; Nezlek & Kuppens, 2008). In contrast,
CR is typically associated with experiencing fewer nega-
tive emotions (Feinberg et al., 2012; Klimesch et al., 2007;
Lieberman et al., 2011; Ray et al., 2010; Szasz et al.,
2011), decreased sympathetic nervous
system activity
(Kim & Hamann, 2012; Shiota & Levenson, 2012;
Stemmler, 1997), and fewer characteristics of depression
(Gross & John, 2003; Nezlek & Kuppens, 2008). This is
not to say that CR strategies are always helpful and ES
strategies are always unhelpful. ES has been shown to be
beneficial in reducing depression in certain cultures (Yuan
et al., 2014), and CR has been shown to be less beneficial

than ES in situations where emotions are strong (Sheppes
et al., 2009; Sheppes & Meiran, 2007, 2008). The decision
to engage in specific ER strategies is strongly influenced
by cultural, contextual, and individual experiential factors.
These individual factors relate to who a person is, what
has or has not previously worked for them for regulating
emotions, and what their motivations or goals are within
a given situation (see the works of Sheppes, 2014; Sheppes
et al., 2014, for reviews). Evaluating how these factors
influence the process and development of ER in various
populations can lead to a more thorough understanding
of ER and a better understanding of the experiences of
individuals within those populations (see the work of
Gross, 2014b,
for a discussion of ER and clinical
populations).

ER and the Experience of Stuttering

Further specifying factors that influence how a per-
son regulates emotion is relevant to the study and treat-
ment of stuttering. People who stutter often experience ele-
vated emotional reactions, such as fear, shame, anger, guilt,
worry, and so forth (Alm, 2004; Conture et al., 2013;
Conture & Walden, 2012; Murphy, 1999; Tichenor &
Yaruss, 2018, 2019a). These emotional experiences are indi-
vidualized to each speaker; they develop over time as peo-
ple cope with stuttering throughout their lives (Tichenor &
Yaruss, 2018). A better understanding of how the use of
specific ER regulatory strategies relates to the develop-
ment of these negative emotions may lead to more effec-
tive treatment of the stuttering condition by further eluci-
dating the reasons that a person develops their individual
phenotype of the stuttering condition (see the work of
Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019b).

Researchers have used behavioral observation (e.g.,
Arnold et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2010) and measures of
physiology to inform the understanding of ER and related
processes in people who stutter (e.g., Jones et al., 2014;
Tumanova et al., 2020). The majority of these studies
have examined EC or other aspects of temperament more
broadly, to explore ER skills in cross-sectional cohorts of
preschool or school-age children who stutter. Anderson
et al. (2003) explored temperament characteristics in pre-
school children who stutter by using the Behavioral Style
Questionnaire (BSQ; McDevitt & Carey, 1978), a parent-
temperament characteristics. The
reported measure of
authors found that preschoolers who stutter were judged
to have lower adaptability skills; this may lead to greater
negative emotions being experienced. Karrass et al. (2006)
also used the BSQ and found that a group of preschool
children who stutter were significantly more reactive and
less able to regulate their emotions than a group of age-
and sex-matched children who did not stutter. Similarly,
Eggers et al. (2010) found that a group of 113 children

who stutter aged 3–8 years had significantly lower EC-
related measures (Inhibitory Control and Attentional Shift-
ing) than children who did not stutter on the Dutch version
of the Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (Van den Bergh
& Ackx, 2003). They hypothesized that lower EC would
lead children who stutter to be more emotionally reactive
than peers.

Despite the evidence that ER processes may be dif-
ferent in children who stutter compared to children who
do not stutter, there is also strong evidence from longitu-
dinal studies that have found no group differences in tem-
perament between preschool children who stutter and pre-
school children who do not stutter (see the works of
Kefalianos et al., 2014, 2017; Reilly et al., 2013; Walsh
et al., 2019). One recent exception to this trend comes
from a longitudinal study showing that stuttering persis-
tence was significantly associated with higher rates of
internalizing behaviors and emotional
reactivity in a
cohort of 145 Dutch children (Koenraads et al., 2021).
These inconclusive between-groups findings related to ER
and temperament may be due to the inherent nonlinear
development of ER and EC throughout
childhood.
Because ER is not stable throughout development, these
mixed findings may be attributable to different underlying
effects at different ages or due to methodological or sam-
pling differences across studies. It is also plausible that the
influences of ER on a person’s experience of stuttering
may naturally differ across individuals as they react and
cope with stuttering in their own ways throughout devel-
opment (Conture & Walden, 2012). Further complicating
the clarity of relationship between ER and stuttering is
the open question of how adults who stutter regulate their
emotions; such information would help to clarify individ-
ual differences in how adults and children who stutter
experience and react
to moments of stuttering. Thus,
exploring ER processes simultaneously in children and
adults who stutter may provide a more complete under-
standing of the relationship between ER and the broader
experience of stuttering and the adverse impact experi-
enced by people who stutter across the life span.

According to research on ER from outside of the
field of stuttering, ER strategies are chosen based on spe-
cific regulatory goals; most often, strategies are selected in
an attempt to decrease negative emotional experiences (see
the works of Gross, 2002, 2014a). Individual factors, such
as past experiences and personal goals, strongly influence
the decision to select one regulatory strategy over another
(Sheppes, 2014; Sheppes et al., 2014). The same is likely
to be true of people who stutter: People who stutter are
likely to choose specific ER strategies based on their own
prior experiences and personal goals in order to reduce
negative emotional experiences. Exploring the specific ER
strategies that people who stutter may select may help to
elucidate how individual children, adolescents, and adults

who stutter experience, approach, or manage moments of
stuttering, and the consideration of individual differences
in selection strategies may yield greater specificity than
broader group comparisons. There are glimpses in recent
stuttering literature of the potential impact that individual-
ized goals can have on a person’s experience of stuttering.
In a sample of over 500 adults who stutter, Tichenor and
Yaruss (2019a) found that a person’s goal when speaking
significantly predicted both the specific forms and degree
of adverse impact that the person experienced related to
stuttering: Adults whose goal was to not stutter (as
opposed to stuttering more openly or saying what they
want to say regardless of whether or not they stuttered)
were much more likely to experience shame, guilt, and
embarrassment associated with their
stuttering. The
reverse was also true: Adults whose goal was to stutter
more openly and say what they want to say were much
more likely to experience less adverse impact related to
stuttering. Exploring ER strategies in people who stutter
may therefore yield a better understanding of how indi-
vidual speakers make decisions about how they approach
speaking and how they attempt to manage moments of
stuttering. For example, because ES may be a less opti-
mal ER strategy with more negative sequelae (Gross,
2014a), selecting ES may be associated with (a) more
often having the goal of not stuttering when speaking
and (b) experiencing greater adverse impact related to
stuttering. Conversely, because CR may be a more opti-
mal ER strategy with less negative sequelae (Gross,
2014a), selecting CR as an ER strategy may be associ-
ated with (c) less often having the goal of not stuttering
when speaking and (d) experiencing less adverse impact
related to stuttering.

Taken together, results from the general ER litera-
ture suggest that people employ different regulatory strate-
gies depending on contextual and personal
factors.
Because stuttering research has largely evaluated ER pro-
cesses via group perspectives (i.e., without considering
individual strategy selection), the relationships among ER,
adverse impact related to stuttering, and goals when
speaking are still unclear. Based on the way that a per-
son’s age, goals, and experiences related to speaking and
stuttering might be associated with the specific ER strate-
gies that they select, the overall purpose of this study was
to quantify the relationship between ER, goals when
speaking, and adverse impact related to stuttering across
the developmental spectrum. Specific aims of this study
were (a)
to describe the relationship between parent-
reported ER and adverse impact related to stuttering in
preschoolers and younger school-age children who stutter,
(b) to evaluate the relationship between two well-studied
ER strategies (CR and ES) and adverse impact related
to stuttering in cross-sectional cohorts of older children
to explore individual
and adults who stutter, and (c)

Method

Participants and Procedure

This study involved survey data from 335 partici-
pants,
including adults who stutter, children who stutter,
and parents of children who stutter. The surveys, described
below,
included the following published instruments: the
Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross & John,
2003), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children
and Adolescents (ERQ-CA; Gullone & Taffe, 2012), and
the age-appropriate version of the Overall Assessment of
the Speaker’s Experience of Stuttering (OASES-S for
school-age children or OASES-T for teens; Yaruss &
Quesal, 2016; Yaruss & Yaruss, 2021). Parents/caregivers
also completed the Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC;
Shields & Cicchetti, 1997) as well as a new version of the
OASES for parents of young children who stutter (OASES-
E-P; Yaruss & Yaruss, 2021). Parents/caregivers of children
who stutter and adults who stutter answered demographic
questions about age, therapy history, self-help/support par-
ticipation, and so forth. Adults and children aged 10 years
and above who stutter also answered questions regarding
their goals when speaking (Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019a). A
total of 180 adults who stutter completed the ERQ. Of
those, 116 provided information about
their goal when
speaking and 84 completed the OASES-A. A total of 95
school-age children and adolescents (ages 7–18 years) com-
pleted the age-appropriate OASES-S or OASES-T. Of the
children aged 10 years and up (n = 67), all provided infor-
mation about their goal when speaking and completed the
ERQ-CA. The parents of 32 preschool children who stutter
(3–6 years) completed the OASES-E-P and the ERC; the
parents of 28 young school-age children who stutter (ages
7–9 years) completed the ERC. Thus, the total sample size
of child, adult, and parent data presented in this study was
335 (180 adults who stutter, 95 school-age children and
adolescents, and 60 parents of preschoolers and children
aged 3–9 years). All adults who stutter in this study
reported that they considered themselves people who stut-
ter. All children in this study were reported by their parents
to be children who stutter. For the child participants, par-
ents reported that 114 (89.8%) had been formally diagnosed
as stuttering by a speech-language pathologist or some
other professional. Consistent with prior research (Tichenor
& Yaruss, 2019a; Yaruss et al., 2002), most preschool chil-
dren (75.0%), school-age children and adolescents (94.7%),
and adults (89.9%) indicated a history of treatment for stut-
tering; fewer preschool children (18.2%), school-age chil-
dren and adolescents (23.0%), and adults (61.4%) had

participated in self-help/support
for stuttering. Parental
reports revealed that several preschool and school-age par-
ticipants exhibited concomitant speech or language diagno-
ses. For preschool children, seven (21.9%) were reported
to have speech sound deficits, and two (6.3%) were
reported to have language deficits. For school-age children,
33 (34.7%) were reported to have speech sound deficits,
five (5.3%) were reported to have language deficits, two
(2.1%) were reported to have apraxia of speech, and one
(1.1%) was reported to have both language and speech
sound deficits. Concomitant neurodevelopmental and psy-
chiatric diagnoses, along with demographic information
reported by parents and participants, are included in
Table 1. Demographic information for all children and
adults who stutter can also be found in Table 1.

All child participants from this study were recruited
as part of a larger, longitudinal study on the development
of adverse impact
in children who stutter led by the
Developmental Speech Laboratory at Michigan State Uni-
versity. No data from these children have yet appeared in
prior publications. Of the 180 adult participants who stut-
ter, 103 were unique to this study while 77 had completed
other surveys in the ongoing survey project relating to
individual differences in adverse impact from both the
Michigan State University Spartan Stuttering Laboratory
and the Duquesne University Life Impact of Speech and
Stuttering Laboratory (see the works of Tichenor et al.,
2021; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019a, 2019b, 2020a, 2020b,
2020c). Participants were recruited using a mix of con-
venience
sampling in which
recruitment cascades via multiple distribution channels
(Goodman, 1961). Participant
lists from prior surveys;
advertisement via social media outlets; word of mouth;
and distribution of information to speech-language pathol-
ogists, specialty stuttering clinics, and national and inter-
national stuttering associations were all used to recruit
respondents. Recruitment partners were asked to share the
survey with as many adults and families of children who
stutter as possible to encourage a broad sampling of back-
grounds and experiences. Because recruitment was con-
ducted in these varied ways, it is impossible to determine
how many parents of children or adults were ultimately
contacted. Thus, response rates cannot be calculated.

sampling and snowball

The surveys were all conducted via the Internet using
Qualtrics (Qualtrics, 2021). All adult participants and par-
ents of child participants provided informed consent before
receiving and completing the surveys. The adult data collec-
tion was deemed exempt from institutional review by the
Michigan State University Human Subjects Research Pro-
tection Office under statute 45 CFR 46.101(b) 2 of the Fed-
eral Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. The child
study was approved by institutional review by the Michigan
State University Human Subjects Research Protection
Office (Study#00001704).

The Surveys

Multiple Qualtrics surveys were created to collect
the data reported in this article. Using multiple shorter
surveys encouraged a higher response rate by facilitating
completion of each survey while limiting fatigue and attri-
tion. The number of surveys completed by each partici-
pant differed depending upon their age.

The OASES (Yaruss & Quesal, 2006, 2016) was
used to assess the impact of stuttering on each partici-
pant’s life. The OASES is based on the World Health

(WHO’s)

Organization’s
International Classification of
Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO, 2001); it asks
people who stutter about their reactions to stuttering, how
much stuttering negatively impacts their communication
in daily situations, and how much their stuttering nega-
tively affects their quality of life. The OASES is currently
available for three age groups: school-age (OASES-S; ages
7–12 years), teen (OASES-T; ages 13–17 years), and adult
(OASES-A; ages 18 years and above). Response forms for
these three age groups have been shown to be a reliable
and stable measure of the impact stuttering has on a

person’s life. A draft version of
the Early Childhood
OASES response form for parents (OASES-E-P; ages 3–
6 years) was used to gather information about parents’
perceptions of how stuttering affects their children’s lives.
Although the OASES-E-P is still in the validation stage, it
was judged to be appropriate for use in this study because
it examines the same constructs as other versions of the
OASES (including versions using parent reports), which
have shown strong reliability and validity in numerous
studies. The OASES-E-P is structured in the same fashion
as other OASES response forms. It is composed of 38 ques-
tions across four subsections (general
information, reac-
tions, communication in daily situations, and quality of
life), and scores for each subsection and total score are also
calculated in the same fashion as other OASES, reflecting
an average of items completed in each section. All OASES
response forms were scored in accordance with instructions,
and the OASES total score (a global measure of adverse
impact related to stuttering in which higher scores indicate
greater adverse impact) was used in the ordinal and multi-
ple linear regression analyses described below.

The ERQ (Gross & John, 2003) was used to assess
an adult participant’s tendency to engage in either ES or
CR through 10 questions using a 7-point agreement Likert
scale. The ERQ has been shown to be a reliable and sta-
ble measure of both ES and CR in numerous samples (see
the work of Aldao et al., 2010, for a review). An adapted
child version of the ERQ (ERQ-CA; Gullone & Taffe,
2012) was given to children aged 10–17 years and scored
via instrument
It contains child-friendly
wording and measures the same constructs as the ERQ
via a 5-point Likert scale. The ERQ and ERQ-CA were
scored in accordance with instructions, and both ES and
CR average scores were used in the ordinal and multiple
linear regression analyses.

instructions.

The ERC (Shields & Cicchetti, 1997) was used to
assess preschool (age 3–6 years) and younger school-age
(age 7–9 years) children’s ER skills. The ERC consists of
two subscales: Lability/Negativity and Emotion Regula-
tion. However, ERC items are often scored together to
form a mean score where higher scores indicate better ER
skills (Schwartz & Proctor, 2000). The ERC has been
shown to be a stable measure of ER in preschool and
school-age children in multiple samples (Danisman et al.,
2016; Reis et al., 2016; Shields & Cicchetti, 1997). ERC
mean score was used as a predictor in the multiple regres-
sion equations for this age group. Measuring children’s
ER skills via parent report was necessary given that this
survey study did not allow direct observation of children’s
ER strategies.

For participants who stutter aged 10 years and up,
goals when speaking were explored using two agreement
Likert scale–based questions: “My goal when speaking is to
not stutter” or “My goal when speaking is to stutter openly

and not do anything to try to hide it.” These two ques-
tions come from a study by Tichenor and Yaruss (2019a)
involving more than 500 adults who stutter, which
showed that the construct goal when speaking falls along
a two-factor structure (not stuttering vs. open stuttering).
The two highest loading items for each factor from our
earlier study to adults and children who stutter in this
study to investigate how goal when speaking relates to
the type of regulatory strategy a person selects. The age
at which these items were presented to participants (ages
10 years and older) was arbitrarily chosen a priori; it will
be used as a benchmark to build future work in this area
with younger children.

Data Analysis

Multiple R packages were used for data manipula-
tion, analysis, and visualization (Christensen, 2019; Curtin,
2018; Dowle & Srinivasan, 2021; Fletcher, 2012; Fox &
Weisberg, 2019; Garnier et al., 2021; Hebbali, 2020;
Kassambara, 2020; Mazerolle, 2020; Moon, 2020; Revelle,
2019; Wickham, 2016; Wickham et al., 2019; Xie, 2021;
Zeileis & Hothorn, 2002). Though each of the instruments
used in this study is supported by previously published reli-
their
ability data in the broader research literature of
respective fields,
internal consistency measures were con-
ducted to examine the internal stability of the measures
and factors within this sample of children and adults who
stutter. Given the volume of data, this information is pre-
sented in Table 2. Internal consistency across the published
measures, as indicated by Cronbach’s alpha, ranged
from poor to excellent. The lowest alpha was seen in
Section I (General Information) of the draft OASES-E-
P, suggesting that this section of the trial
instrument
OASES examines more than one construct. Because total
scores on the OASES reflect an average of items across all
sections, the effects of examining multiple constructs are
mitigated. Still, analyses presented below were completed,
both including and excluding the Section I data. No
appreciable differences were found in either significance or
effect size. As a result, data from the OASES-E-P Section
I were included in the final presentation of results to
maintain consistency with how other versions of
the
OASES were used in this study. Not counting that section
of the OASES-E-P, internal consistency for the other mea-
sures used in this study was ranged from adequate to
excellent.

Two multiple linear regression equations were used
to evaluate whether total score on the ERC, age, or their
interactions could predict adverse impact related to stut-
tering as measured by OASES-E-P total score (Model 1—
children aged 3–6 years) or OASES-S total score (Model 2
—children aged 7–9 years). Two additional multiple linear
regression equations were used to determine whether CR,

age, or their interaction could predict OASES-S and
OASES-T total scores (Model 3—children and adolescents
aged 10–18 years) and OASES-A (Model 5—adults aged
18 years and older). Finally, two multiple linear regression
equations evaluated whether ES, age, or their interaction
could predict OASES total scores (Model 4—children and
adolescents aged 10–17 years and Model 6—adults aged
18 years and older). Note that the OASES-S and OASES-
T total scores were combined in Model 3 and Model 4 to
increase statistical power and decrease the number of sta-
tistical tests. This is justifiable as the predicted variable
(OASES total score) calculated from the OASES-S (ages
10–12 years) or OASES-T (ages 12–17 years) is directly
comparable as averages. These models, ages, and mea-
sures are visualized in Figure 1.

Multicollinearity was assessed through variance
inflation factors (VIFs). No models demonstrated VIF
values high enough to raise concerns about multicollinear-
ity between age and the ER variables (see the works of
Kennedy, 2003; Neter et al., 1985). However, the interac-
tion of age and ER-related measures was not included due
to not having the adequate sample size of preschoolers
and younger school-age children. The final ER-related
predictor variables included CR in children aged 10–

17 years (M = 3.31, SD = 0.72), CR in adults (M = 4.78,
SD = 1.11), ES in children aged 10–17 years (M = 2.62,
SD = 0.93), and ES in adults (M = 3.69, SD = 1.48).
ERC mean total score was also investigated in children
aged 3–6 years (M = 3.07, SD = 0.23) and in children
aged 7–9 years (M = 3.18, SD = 0.22). These ER predic-
tors and age were also investigated for linearity, normality
of residuals, homoscedasticity, and the presence of influen-
tial values via diagnostic plots in accordance with the
assumptions of linear regression. Diagnostic plots indi-
cated that all predictors and outcome variables in each
model showed a linear relationship that only deviated in
the extreme tails. Likewise, all errors were judged to be
normally distributed, with only slight deviations of nor-
mality in upper and lower tails. All predictors in all six
models also demonstrated residuals that had a constant
variance (homoscedasticity) and independence of residual
error terms (i.e., no observation was more than 3 times
the mean; see the work of Cook, 1979). See Supplemental
Material S1 for more information on diagnostic plots. The
outcome variables in all multiple regression models were
the OASES-E-P (M = 2.14, SD = 0.56), OASES-S (M =
2.14, SD = 0.57), OASES-T (M = 2.42, SD = 0.53), or
OASES-A (M = 2.68, SD = 0.69). Missing data were

because listwise deletion is unbiased when the probability
of complete cases is independent of the outcome variable
(Bartlett et al., 2014; Newman, 2014; White & Carlin,
2010), the exact circumstance in this study.

To investigate individual differences in ER strategy
use as a function of a person’s goal when speaking, ordi-
logistic regression (ordered logit/proportional odds
nal
regression) was performed (Williams, 2016). Ordinal logis-
tic regression was selected because it is a useful analytical
approach for analyzing Likert data as a function of con-
tinuous or categorical predictors, while accounting for the
ordered nature of the dependent data (Williams, 2006,
2016). Ordinal logistic regression, which has proven useful
for differentiating individual differences in the experience
of stuttering in previous literature (Tichenor & Yaruss,
2019a), is also more powerful than multinomial regression
for detecting underlying patterns of ordered data (Barry,
2017). Four models were built: CR strategy use predicting
goal when speaking (Model 7—children aged 10–17 years
and Model 8—adults aged 18 years and older) and ES
strategy use predicting goal when speaking (Model 9—
children aged 10–17 years and Model 10—adults aged
18 years and older). The assumption of parallel lines (pro-
portional odds assumption) was tested for each model
using the likelihood ratio test of cumulative link models
(Christensen, 2019). The assumption was considered to
have been met for all four models because there was no
significant difference between each model and a null
model at p < .01 (Allison, 1999).

Results

Results from the analyses are reported below in terms
of the three research questions: to describe relationship
between parent-reported ER and adverse impact related to
stuttering in preschoolers and younger school-age children
who stutter, to evaluate the relationship between adverse
impact related to stuttering and two ER strategies (CR and
ES) in cross-sectional cohorts of older children and adults
who stutter, and to explore the relationship between indi-
vidual differences in goal when speaking and ER strategy
use in older children and adults who stutter.

ER and Adverse Impact of Stuttering

Preschool and Younger School-Age Children

In children ages 3 through 6 years (Model 1), ERC
and age together explained a significant amount of the
variance of OASES-E-P total score, F(2, 26) = 9.703, p <
.001, R2 = .43, R2
Adjusted = .38, f2 = .61, a large effect size
(Cohen, 1988). More detailed analyses (significance of pre-
dictors) revealed that
the significant relationship with
OASES-E-P total score was seen for ERC total score but
not for age, indicating that higher ERC mean total scores
were significantly associated with decreased OASES-E-P
total score or less adverse impact. The raw data reflecting
the relationship between ERC mean total
score and
OASES-E-P total score in children aged 3–6 years are
shown in Figure 2a, which also contains a plotted regres-
sion line with standard error shaded to aid visualization of

nificantly predicted OASES-S total score, where older ages
were significantly associated with higher OASES-S total
score (greater adverse impact); ERC mean total score did
not significantly predict OASES-S total score. Specific
information about all regression models can be found in
Table 3.

Children and Adolescents Aged 10–18 Years
and Adults

Model 3 (CR and age in children and adolescents
aged 10–17 years) did not explain a significant amount of
the variance of OASES total score, F(2, 57) = 1.236, p =
.298, R2 = .04, R2
Adjusted = .01, f2 = .04. Model 4 (ES and

total score, F(2, 57) = 6.634, p = .003, R2 = .19,
R2
Adjusted = .16, f2 = .23, a medium effect size (Cohen,
1988). More frequent use of ES as an ER strategy was sig-
nificantly associated with higher OASES total scores or
greater adverse impact in children and adolescents aged
10–17 years. Age was not significantly predictive. The raw
data reflecting the relationship between CR/ES and
OASES total score in children and adolescents aged 10–
17 years are visualized in Figures 3a and 3b. Model 5
(CR in adults) explained a significant amount of the vari-
ance of OASES total score, F(2, 59) = 4.99, p = .010,

R2 = .15, R2
Adjusted = .12, f2 = .18, a medium effect size
(Cohen, 1988). Model 6 (ES in adults) explained a signifi-
cant amount of the variance of OASES total score, F(2,
Adjusted = .11, f2 = .17, a
59) = 4.89, p = .011, R2 = .14, R2
medium effect size (Cohen, 1988). Less frequent use of
CR as an ER strategy and more frequent use of ES as an
ER strategy were both significantly associated with higher
OASES total scores or greater adverse impact in adults.
Age was not significantly predictive in either model. The
raw data for CR and OASES total score in adults, as well
as the raw data for CR, ES, and OASES total score, are
visualized in Figures 3c and 3d. Specific results for each
model are provided in Table 3.

ER Strategy Use and Goal When Speaking

CR and ES strategy use, measured via the ERQ
(for adults) or the ERQ-CA (for children and adolescents
aged 10–17 years), were used to predict goal when speak-
ing (“My goal when speaking is to not stutter”). Equa-
tions using the goal of more open stuttering when speak-
ing are not presented to limit redundancy because they
indicated the opposite pattern of
results. A 1-point
increase in CR mean score on the ERQ significantly
increased the odds of an adult indicating that their goal
when speaking is to not stutter by 0.60 at a 95% confi-
dence interval (CI; range: 0.44–0.83; note that odds less
than 1 indicates a decreased probability of occurrence).
A 1-point increase in ES mean score on the ERQ nonsig-
nificantly increased the odds of an adult indicating more
agreement that their goal when speaking is to not stutter
by a nonsignificant degree of 1.04 at a 95% CI (range:

Figure 3. The predicted relationships between Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES) total score (adult [A],
school-age [S], or teen [T]) and cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression are visualized. Expressive suppression significantly predicted
OASES total score in adults (d) and children (b); more frequently using expressive suppression as an emotional regulation strategy was sig-
nificantly associated with a higher degree of adverse impact in children and adults. Cognitive reappraisal significantly predicted OASES total
score in adults (c) but not in children or adolescents (a). More frequently using cognitive reappraisal as an emotional regulation strategy was

0.82–1.31). Both child/adolescent models indicated non-
significant predictions. A 1-point increase in CR mean
score on the ERQ-CA increased the odds of a child or
an adolescent indicating more agreement that their goal
when speaking is to not stutter by 0.77 at a 95% CI
(range: 0.41–1.42). A 1-point increase in ES mean score
on the ERQ-CA increased the odds of a child or an ado-
lescent indicating more agreement that their goal when
speaking is to not stutter by 1.25 at a 95% CI (range:
0.77–2.06). Because odds are difficult to interpret intui-
tively, the odds ratios (ORs) were mathematically trans-
formed into probabilities, and CR regression equations
were plotted in Figure 4. The lighter lines (yellow and
green) indicate a child, an adolescent, or an adult who is

more likely to engage in CR as an ER strategy. The darker
lines (purple) indicate a child, an adolescent, or an adult
who is less likely to engage in CR as an ER strategy. ORs
from the ES ordinal logistic regression equations were not
mathematically transformed or plotted as those were not
significant predictors in both groups. As can be seen in
Figure 4a, an adult who stutters who is more likely to
engage in CR as an ER strategy is less likely to report that
their goal when speaking is not to stutter. Conversely, an
adult who stutters who is less likely to use CR as an ER
strategy is more likely to report that their goal when speak-
ing is not to stutter. A similar crossover effect can be seen
visually in the relationship between CR use and goal when
(see Figure 4b),

Figure 4. The predicted probability of having a goal when speaking of not stuttering (as measured by their agreement regarding how fre-
quently they have this speaking goal) is predicted by the tendency to engage in cognitive reappraisal (CR). Having a goal when speaking
geared toward not stuttering (as opposed to more open stuttering) significantly decreased an adult’s tendency to elect CR as an emotional
regulation strategy. This effect was not significant in children, though the pattern is visually similar to the adult data via the same crossover
pattern between low and high tendency to elect CR. Darker lines indicate lower tendencies to use CR, while lighter lines indicate higher ten-
dencies to use CR.

though this prediction did not reach significance (95% CI
range: 0.41–1.42).

Discussion

The purposes of this article were (a) to describe the
relationship between parent-reported ER and adverse
impact related to stuttering in preschoolers and younger
school-age children who stutter; (b) to evaluate the rela-
tionship between adverse impact and the two ER strate-
gies of CR and ES in cross-sectional cohorts of older chil-
dren, adolescents, and adults who stutter; and (c)
to
explore individual differences in a person’s goal when
speaking based upon ER strategy use. Results indicated
that higher parent-reported ER skills were significantly
associated with lower parent-reported adverse impact
related to stuttering in preschoolers. A similar relationship
was not seen in younger school-age children who stutter,
despite the finding that both groups, on average, experi-
enced significant degrees of adverse impact as measured
by the OASES. In older children, adolescents, and adults
who stutter, more frequent use of ES was significantly

associated with greater adverse impact related to stutter-
ing. More frequent use of CR was significantly associated
with less adverse impact related to stuttering in adults but
not older children and adolescents who stutter. This pat-
tern of findings supports the notion that parent-reported
ER and specific ER strategies are strong predictors of
adverse impact related to stuttering. Yet, our cross-sectional
data spanning preschool-age children to adults show dif-
ferences in both the significance and magnitude of the
relationships between ER and adverse impact related to
stuttering in children and adults.

Past studies have shown that some groups of young
children who stutter may be less able to regulate their
emotions than matched groups of young children who do
not stutter (Anderson et al., 2003; Karrass et al., 2006),
though other research has not reported such effects (see
the works of Eggers et al., 2021; Kefalianos et al., 2014,
2017; Reilly et al., 2013; Walsh et al., 2019). In line with
this pattern of mixed results, our data found differences
across the age ranges in whether ER significantly pre-
dicted adverse impact related to stuttering. Age was only
predictive of ER with children aged 7–9 years; for other
age groups, a predictive relationship involving age was

Tichenor et al.: Emotional Regulation and Stuttering 2423

not found. Instead, parent-reported ER or ER strategy
use was more predictive of adverse impact related to stut-
tering than age. Given that age and ER skills or strategies
never demonstrated high degrees of multicollinearity, this
null result of age cannot be explained by model complex-
ity. One explanation for these differences may be that the
development of ER is a nonlinear process throughout
childhood (Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2011). Prior
research has shown that various factors influence ER
strategy selection, including culture, parenting styles, peer
or social group influences, and characteristics of the child
(e.g., cognitive skills and temperament; Gross & Cassidy,
2019). Future research may be able to better account for
these myriad factors to more clearly elucidate the relation-
ship between adverse impact related to stuttering and ER
throughout childhood. Moreover, using beneficial ER
strategies can be difficult even for typically developing
children as they transition into adolescence (Stroud et al.,
2009). This may align with the fact that ER did not signif-
icantly predict adverse impact in children aged 7–9 years.
Living with the stuttering condition may present these
children who stutter transitioning to adolescence with even
greater difficulties managing emotions related to stutter-
ing, speech, or communication-related activities. As a
result, some of the differences in our findings across ages
may be attributable to the fact that participants were
cross-sectionally sampled at different stages of develop-
ment at times when the unique contributions of living with
stuttering and managing emotions may intersect in differ-
ent ways. In other words, the relationship between age,
ER, and adverse impact related to stuttering may natu-
rally change throughout a person’s development, and cli-
nicians should not assume adultlike relationships between
these constructs in children who stutter.

The possibility that some of the different findings
between ER and adverse impact related to stuttering
across age ranges may be attributed to different stages of
development is also supported by the similarity of patterns
in the results regarding goal when speaking. The engage-
ment in ER strategies helps to explain adults’ goal when
speaking. More frequently electing CR as a regulatory
strategy was associated with a significantly reduced like-
lihood that an adult’s goal when speaking was to not stut-
ter. This trend did not reach significance in school-age
children and adolescents. However, the same crossover
pattern between increased or decreased CR and having a
goal of not stuttering is visible in the probability plot in
Figure 4. If adverse impact related to stuttering does
change or develop throughout childhood, then our finding
of a similar (though nonsignificant) relationship between
CR and goal when speaking in these younger individuals
is not surprising. Future longitudinal work in this area
should determine whether such differences among adverse
impact, ER, and goal when speaking across ages are

representative of developmental changes or differences across
children and adolescents who

Clinical Implications

Considering the relationship between individual dif-
ferences in ER strategies and adverse impact related to
implications. As noted
stuttering has critical clinical
above, ER is
shaping, altering, and
the process of
influencing emotions, most often to reduce the severity of
negative emotions (Gross, 2014a). This definition of ER
the value of understanding not only what
highlights
speakers are doing when speaking (e.g.,
the well-
documented speech and related behaviors that people who
stutter often demonstrate) but also why they are doing it
(e.g., substituting a word when ordering at a restaurant
because stuttering would increase negative emotions). This
deeper understanding of how a client engages with the
emotion surrounding moments of stuttering can help clini-
cians better understand their client’s experiences.

Addressing many affective, behavioral, and cognitive
reactions in stuttering therapy requires an understanding
of the emotionality attached to them and the individual
decisions that people who stutter may make in how they
cope with stuttering (Tichenor et al., 2022). For example,
covert stuttering can take many forms, including avoid-
ance of words, sounds, or situations, as a speaker’s
to “pass” as a person who does not stutter
attempt
(Constantino et al., 2017, p. 27; Douglass et al., 2018;
Murphy, Quesal, & Gulker, 2007). A child or an adult
might choose to engage in avoidance in order to prevent
or minimize the emotional upheaval associated with a
word, sound, or situation. Thus, avoidance can be seen as
a stuttering-specific example of situation selection strategy
use. Conversely, a person may choose not to avoid a
moment of stuttering, opting rather to stay in a situation,
because they realize that their message is worth saying
despite the fact that they stuttered while conveying it. This
would be an example of CR because the speaker is actively
reframing the negative emotions they are experiencing into
a more positive focus on communication. In short, a clini-
cian who understands why their client chooses certain ER
strategies for managing a moment of stuttering is better
positioned to teach more adaptive methods of stuttering
management. Such a clinician is also better positioned to
charting a path toward reducing the negative impact of
stuttering on a person’s life.

One particularly useful tool for addressing poorer
ER and mitigating adverse impact in stuttering therapy is
desensitization. Desensitization is the process by which a
person who stutters engages in fearful speaking-related
activities with the goal of experiencing fewer negative
emotions and, ultimately, learning to engage more easily

2424 Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (cid:129) Vol. 65 (cid:129) 2412–2430 (cid:129) July 2022

with speech in the future (Brundage et al., 2006; Murphy,
Yaruss, & Quesal, 2007). Decades ago, Van Riper
described effective desensitization in stuttering therapy in
a manner that is consistent with how current research
describes effective ER. Van Riper stated, “Our purpose in
desensitization therapy is to reduce the strength of the
attendant emotional upheaval enough to enable the stut-
terer to learn new ways of coping with the expectancy and
experience of broken words” (Van Riper, 1982, p. 267).
Present findings shed light on how these manifestations
may develop differently for different individuals who stut-
ter, given that adults who less often engaged in CR as an
ER strategy were more likely to have the goal of not stut-
tering when speaking. Repeatedly experiencing difficulty
speaking (Perkins, 1990; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019b) is, for
many people, associated with the development of fear,
shame, embarrassment, and other negative reactions con-
cerning speech or communication. These feelings become
habitual, anticipated, and reinforced by repeated speech
difficulties, and, as a result, a person may learn to avoid,
push, or struggle in an attempt to cope with the sensation
(or anticipation) of being stuck or unable to communicate
as they wish (Constantino et al., 2017; Jackson et al.,
2015; Tichenor et al., 2017; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2018).
Thus, these forms of adverse impact related to stuttering
can meaningfully be viewed as resulting from nonoptimal
forms of ER. Exploring a client’s experience of stuttering
through the ways that they attempt to regulate their emo-
tions during moments of stuttering or in different situa-
tions can directly lead to treatment that is more specifi-
cally targeted to each client’s unique needs, history, per-
sonal characteristics, and goals.

the notion that

Our findings therefore contribute to the growing
body of research that highlights the benefits of holistic
therapy for stuttering that addresses not only the more
readily observed stuttering behaviors but also the burden
that the condition has on the life of the person who stut-
ters. Specifically, for older children and adults, the present
data support
formal strategies such as
mindfulness training and other cognitive therapy techniques
can be incorporated into therapy to mitigate adverse
impact related to stuttering (Beilby et al., 2012; Blood,
1995; Boyle, 2011; Cheasman, 2013; Emerick, 1988; Gupta
et al., 2016; Harley, 2018; Helgadóttir et al., 2014; Kelman
& Wheeler, 2015; Menzies et al., 2009; Palasik & Hannan,
2013; Plexico & Sandage, 2011; Van Riper, 1973), particu-
larly given that such therapy leads to more effective ER
(see the work of Farb et al., 2014, for a review). Our data
provide less clear therapeutic guidance for younger children
who stutter; however, clinicians must still be cognizant that
even young children who stutter can experience high
degrees of adverse impact related to stuttering (De Nil &
Brutten, 1991; Langevin et al., 2010; Vanryckeghem &
Brutten, 1997; Vanryckeghem et al., 2005). Our results

showed that not only do many children experience adverse
impact as measured by OASES-E-P scores (M = 2.14,
SD = 0.56), but that individual differences in ER strongly
predicted the amount of adverse impact experienced in pre-
school children who stutter. This finding stands in contrast
to prior group studies suggesting that adverse impact
develops only later in life (see the works of de Sonneville-
Koedoot et al., 2014; Reilly et al., 2013).

Limitations and Future Directions

Although this study involved participants from dif-
ferent age groups, data were drawn from a single time
point for each participant. As such, care should be taken
when interpolating what these data mean in a longitudinal
or developmental context. We have attempted to be cau-
tious in hypothesizing why older children’s data were simi-
lar (though not identical) to those of adults who stutter.
In future work, we will explore the relationship between
ER and adverse impact longitudinally to observe interac-
tions within individual children who stutter over time.
Relatedly, our analyses indicated that age only predicted
ER processes for children aged 7–9 years. Future work
should consider
larger groups of children across age
ranges to explore potential interactions between age and
ER in predicting adverse impact using a broader range of
measures. Lastly, this study explored two commonly stud-
ied ER strategies (CR and ES); future work should also

employ both quantitative and qualitative methods
explore the relationship between adverse impact and other
ER strategies.

By design, this study did not explore potential rela-
tionships between ER strategies, adverse impact, and goal
when speaking in the context of observably stuttered
speech. Future research could explore relationships to
overt speech, given that prior studies using behavioral and
physiological measures
in children who stutter have
revealed differences in ER-related processes (see the work
of Walsh & Usler, 2019, for a discussion of physiology in
relation to speech motor control). Such investigations are
useful because behavioral and physiological measures can
provide insights to more state-like ER in specific contexts,
such as during ongoing speech production (Zengin-
Bolatkale et al., 2015). For example, prior research has
shown that

cesses and immediate consequences of individual moments
of stuttering.

Summary

This study evaluated the relationship between ER,
adverse impact related to stuttering, and how individuals
approach stuttering. Higher parent-reported ER skills in
preschoolers were
significantly associated with lower
parent-reported adverse impact related to stuttering, yet
this relationship was not significant in younger school-age
children aged 7–9 years. Children and adolescents who
stutter aged 10–17 years who engaged more often in ES as
an ER strategy demonstrated significantly higher levels of
adverse impact related to stuttering. This pattern was also
seen in adults who stutter in this study. Adults who
engaged in CR demonstrated both significantly lower
adverse impact related to stuttering than adults who
engaged less frequently in CR and a decreased likelihood
of having the goal to not stutter when speaking. Older
children and adolescents did not show these effects, how-
ever. These data suggest that ER is a significant factor
related to the adverse impact of stuttering for both chil-
dren and adults who stutter and that the complex relation-
ship between ER and adverse impact changes across
development.
