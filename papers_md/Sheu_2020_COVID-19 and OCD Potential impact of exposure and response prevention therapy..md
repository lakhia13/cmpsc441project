This brief clinical review critically assesses the use of exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP) for pa-
tients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss the ethical and 
practical considerations that clinicians employed in past infectious disease outbreaks, as well as general safety 
measures  routinely  practiced  in  the  conduct  of  exposure  therapy.  During  this  time,  concerns  regarding  the 
feasibility  of ERP have emerged,  especially with strict  guidelines on social distancing and on following other 
preventative  behaviors.  While  ERP  may  have  to  be  modified  to  follow  public  health  guidelines,  this  review 
outlines a) how ERP has been adapted in the context of other infectious triggers; b) the potential impacts on OCD 
patients of attenuated ERP, and c) minimizing concerns related to litigation. A case report is provided detailing 
ERP personalized given COVID-19 related considerations. In all, we advise against modifying therapies in ways 
that may jeopardize the efficacy of patient care or progress.   

1. Introduction 

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is 
the greatest international health crisis in our modern era (CDC, 2020). 
This novel virus gained global attention in late December 2019 as cases 
of atypical pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China (CDC, 2020). At the 
time of this article, COVID-19 has infected over 6.3 million and caused 
over  190,000 deaths (as of September 10,  2020) in the United  States 
alone, and the virus continues to spread around the world (CDC, 2020). 
COVID-19 is highly infectious, and people have been trying to protect 
themselves  by  engaging  in  social  distancing  measures  and  other  pre-
ventative behaviors (CDC, 2020). 

Research is emerging regarding the impact of the COVID-19 on in-
dividuals with pre-existing mental health diagnoses. Particularly with 
respect to concerns involving danger and contamination, socioeconomic 
factors,  xenophobia,  and  symptoms  of  traumatic  stress,  patients  with 
underlying  anxiety-related  disorders  have  been  found  to  be  more 
negatively  affected  by  stressors  related  to  the  pandemic  compared  to 
those  with  underlying  mood  disorders  or  no  mental  health  disorders 
(Asmundson et al., 2020). Further, there is considerable systemic mental 
health consequences associated with COVID (Gruber et al. (in press)). A 

COVID  Stress  Syndrome  has  been  identified  (Taylor  et  al.,  2020a, 
2020b)  that  is  centrally  marked  by  anxiety,  specifically  danger  and 
contamination fears. Finally, research conducted during the pandemic 
has  shown  that  contamination  concerns  are  critical  components  of 
maladaptive  fears  of  contracting  COVID  (McKay,  Yang,  Elhai,  & 
Asmundson, 2020). These findings illustrate the potential of heightened 
psychological  effects  that  this  pandemic  may  have  on  patients  with 
anxiety-related  disorders,  including  obsessive-compulsive  disorder 
(OCD),  and  thus  the  need  for  evidence-based  psychological  in-
terventions for fear-based problems will continue during and after the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Among patients with OCD, there has been limited attention to the 
effects of the pandemic on their care, particularly regarding exposure 
and response prevention (ERP) therapy. In the United States, OCD af-
fects ~1–4 % of adults, and is debilitating and costly (Pittenger, 2017), 
and  associated  with  significant  loss  of  quality  of  life  (Koran,  2000). 
Currently, treatment of OCD includes exposure with response preven-
tion  (ERP),  serotonergic  medications,  and  combined  ERP-medication 
(Pittenger,  2017).  Complicating  treatment  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic  is  that  epidemiological  research  shows  that  approximately 
50  %  of  OCD  sufferers,  across  cultures,  report  at  least  some

contamination  fear  (Williams,  Chapman,  Simms,  &  Tellawi,  2017). 
Practitioners  providing  evidence-based  psychosocial  treatment  there-
fore have a challenge to manage in how to deliver care while simulta-
neously ensuring the safety of their clients. This brief review and clinical 
update covers the  ethical and practical considerations clinicians have 
employed in past infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics. Further, 
there  are  some  settings  when  providing  exposure  requires  special 
consideration due to local conditions that increase risk (i.e., the presence 
of  harmful  animals  or  insects,  such  as  spider  phobia  treatment  in 
Australia). 

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in the form of ERP, is the gold 
standard  psychotherapy  for  OCD  patients  with  varying  degrees  of 
severity  (McKay  et  al.,  2015;  Pittenger,  2017).  ERP  consists  of:  (1) 
gradual  and  systematic  exposure  to  triggers  that  provoke  obsessional 
distress; (2) refraining from ritualizing or avoidance; and (3) cognitive 
therapy to reinforce learning that takes place from exposures. Patients 
are  directly  and/or  imaginatively  exposed  to  situations  that  produce 
distress without ritualizing or avoiding the stimuli. Notably in ERP, the 
patient is not exposed to greater than usual risk through exposure tasks; 
rather,  therapeutic  tasks  place  the  individual  at  ‘usual’  risk  without 
engaging in rituals in order for the patient to learn that – without ritu-
alizing - the feared outcome does not happen, they can cope effectively if 
it does, and that they can tolerate distress and uncertainty. 

The current COVID-19 pandemic has prompted discussion about how 
to  safely  provide  ERP  for  contamination  fear  (Fineberg  et  al.,  2020). 
Before  discussing  the  recent recommendations,  the  approach  adopted 
during prior infectious outbreaks shows that ERP can be provided safely 
even when infectious risks are comparably high. 

2. Prior public and personal infection risk conditions 

There  is  precedent  for  clinical  researchers  highlighting  potential 
adjustments  for  ERP  for  contamination  fear  during  infectious  disease 
risk. Notably, during the early days of the HIV+/AIDS crisis, clinicians 
treating OCD grappled with a context-bound presentation of contami-
nation fear over contracting the virus (Bruce & Stevens, 1992). At the 
time,  there  was  emerging  information  on  how  the  virus  spread,  with 
numerous false beliefs about contact with surfaces or individuals at risk 
for the disease (Bishop, Alva, Cantu, & Rittiman, 1991, p. 1991). In the 
case analysis provided by Bruce and Stevens (1992), the client treated 
was a medical professional, and thus the approach to providing ERP was 
complicated by a preexisting high level of information regarding infec-
tious risk. This led to an analysis of procedures to balance the safety of 
the  client  with  delivering  care  that  alleviates  contamination  fear.  In 
short,  an  evidence-based  approach  to  treating  contamination  fear  de-
mands balancing the ethical requirements of providing symptom relief 
while also recognizing the exigent processes of the context of the client. 
In a large series of cases presenting with fear of contracting AIDS, where 
seven cases were treated with ERP, all with special attention to risks of 
infection (Logsdail, Lovell, Warwick, & Marks, 1991). A similar analysis 
was  provided  in  the  case  of  an  adolescent  with  a  comparable  fear  of 
contracting AIDS that prompted severe contamination fear and washing 
rituals (Harris & Wiebe, 1992). From this, it can be concluded that ERP 
intervention  for  AIDS-related  contamination  fear  was  conducted  with 
careful attention to infectious disease risk. For example, hand washing 
was supported based on an estimated average level practiced to mitigate 
infection risk. 

Clinicians who regularly treat contamination-based OCD have also 
been attentive to client-specific infection risks. For example, Mac Neil, 
Prost, Leung, and Gates (2017) report on a case of a 42-year-old man 
with severe contamination fear complicated by health risks due to his 
cystic  fibrosis.  In  this  case,  the  clinicians  provided  ERP  along  with 
cognitive  therapy  where  special  care  was  taken  into  consideration, 
allowing  the  client  to  reduce  acute  symptoms  while  retaining  health 
related  safety  measures  (Mac  Neil  et  al.,  2017).  This  included 
client-centered hygienic practices that mitigate unique infection risk due 

to  cystic  fibrosis,  while  also  guiding  the  client  to  engage  in  washing 
practices  that  conformed  to  recommendations  associated  with  his 
medical condition. 

More  generally,  some  have  suggested  that  clinicians  treating 
contamination fear consult infectious disease experts before initiating 
ERP (Hambridge & Loewenthal, 2003). Medical experts have endorsed 
ERP  methods  for  situations  that  might  at  first  glance  appear  to  run 
counter  to  responsible  exposure  (such  as  contact  with  toilet  seats  or 
garbage bins) (Hambridge & Loewenthal, 2003). This would allow cli-
nicians  to  receive  expert  guidance  that  they  can  reference  for  clients 
when  approaching  stimuli  that  might  be  ambiguous  in  their  risk  but 
have had the approval of medical professionals for physical contact. 

3. Local risk conditions 

Aside from contamination fear associated with OCD, exposure pro-
cedures are used for anxiety disorders in general. Clinicians provide this 
intervention  in  specific  local  contexts.  This  means  that  in  some  local 
contexts, the safety of exposure is constrained by specific conditions. For 
example, fear of spiders is a common specific phobia (Merckelbach, de 
Jong,  Muris,  &  van  den  Hout,  1996).  However,  conducting  exposure 
treatment  for  spider  phobia  in  Australia,  home  to  eight  of  the  most 
venomous spiders in the world, would require special safety precautions 
regarding  the  types  of  spiders  encountered.  That  is,  clinicians  would 
simply need to be aware of the hazards, and then proceed to provide 
exposure treatment. This illustration can be extended to numerous sit-
uations  globally  (i.e.,  snake  fear  in  geographic  regions  with  deadly 
snakes). 

The  local  conditions  risk  can  be  applied  to  contamination  fear  as 
well. For example, hantavirus is a deadly air-borne virus that infects the 
lungs  (Muranyi,  Bahr,  Zeier,  &  van  der  Woude,  2005).  One  way  in-
dividuals can be infected is from cleaning enclosed places where dried 
mouse droppings  are  present, such  as  in the  Southwest  of the  United 
States.  Residents  of  this  region  are  generally  aware  of  this  risk,  and 
clinicians  working  in  this  area  would  likewise  exercise  the  necessary 
caution in conducting ERP for contamination fear due to OCD. Roughly 
translated, this means a clinician would not recommend a client with 
contamination  fear  enter  and  vigorously  disrupt  the  dust  in  poorly 
ventilated areas (i.e., storage sheds) if treatment were conducted in the 
Southwest, whereas this may be safely practiced in other regions where 
humidity is higher (such as the Northeast of the United States). Simi-
larly,  placing  one’s  hand  in  a  dark  area  where  spiders  might  reside, 
when treating spider fear in the northeast region of the United States, 
would not be practiced in Australia. 

4. The COVID-19 pandemic and exposure with response 
prevention recommendations 

Psychologists  providing  treatment during  the  COVID-19  pandemic 
continue to be guided by the ethical standards of the profession. In this 
specific  case,  this  means  ensuring  science-informed  treatment  while 
engaged in proscribed safety precautions (i.e., online therapy delivery to 
ensure social distancing). As noted here, ERP remains the most effica-
cious intervention for OCD, whether there is a pandemic or not. As a 
result, in line with the ethical mandate of the profession, providers are 
obligated  to  identify  the  best  way  to  deliver  this  intervention  while 
navigating  the  safety  protocols  to  contain  the  spread  of  COVID-19 
(Chenneville & Schwartz-Mette, 2020). 

There have been mindful discussions among providers regarding the 
feasibility of ERP therapies in light of safety guidelines (Fineberg et al., 
2020).  While  there  have  not  yet  been  academic  literature  reflecting 
current changes in ERP, there have  been recommendations to signifi-
cantly modify in-person therapy for patients whose OCD are contami-
nation related to Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines or even 
pause current therapies (Fineberg et al., 2020). As suggested by Fineberg 
et al., pharmacotherapy should be the first option for patients with OCD 

JournalofAnxietyDisorders76(2020)1023142J.C. Sheu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

symptoms during this time and therapies should focus on maintaining, 
rather than improving, a patient’s current OCD symptoms. 

6. Litigation 

“For  OCD  patients  with  contamination  fears  and  cleaning  or  washing 
compulsions,  active  and  in  vivo  CBT  with  exposure  and  response  pre-
vention  (ERP)  will  need  to  be  sensibly  adapted  and  may  need  to  be 
paused.  This  specifically  relates  to  active,  in  vivo  exposure  aimed  at 
tackling contamination. Instead we suggest using therapist time to support 
patients and trying to prevent them from deteriorating, e.g. by encour-
aging them to restrain their compulsions as far as possible, rather than 
directed at actively treating contamination fears.” 

While these proposed adjustments attempt to be mindful of current 
pandemic  and  CDC  guidelines,  it  is  important  to  note  that  there  are 
potential  negative  consequences  of  moving  away  from an  established 
model, even temporarily. There are a number of concerns related to this 
position. 

First, for patients with contamination OCD, involvement in ERP in-
cludes facing triggers that reflect an ‘ordinary’  level of risk; since this 
level  of  risk  has increased  in the  current pandemic  state, the  level of 
exposure to these triggers must be adjusted accordingly. Adept clinicians 
have recognized this and adjusted in real time. While this had required 
adaptations to ERP to follow public health guidelines, it does not require 
pausing  active  treatment.  Indeed,  ERP  is  associated  with  treatment 
response in approximately 75–80 % of patients (Collins & Coles, 2017). 
CBT  has  also  been  shown  to  be  significantly  better  than  pharmaco-
therapy for OCD treatment, illustrating the suggestion to have medica-
¨
Ost, 
tions  serve  as  first-line  options  may  not  prove  to  have  benefits  (
Havnen, Hansen, & Kvale, 2015). Adjusting a patient’s treatment may 
cause more harm than good by denying treatment when most needed. 
Second,  the  majority  of  OCD  patients  do  not  experience  contami-
nation symptoms. Thus, exposures would remain similar in content and 
scope, and in accordance with CDC or WHO guidelines. While this may 
limit the extent of exposures, we have found that we can adapt exposures 
quite easily, especially with the use of telemedicine providing access to 
natural living settings. 

Third,  the  evidence,  based  on  effect  sizes,  does  not  support  a 
medication-only approach to OCD. Using Cohen’s criteria for effect size 
classifications,  reviews  of  the  literature  show  that  the  effect  size  for 
symptom response to medication is generally medium (Skapinakis et al., 
2016), whereas the effect size for ERP is generally large (McKay et al., 
2015).  Based  on  numerous  considerations  for  client  safety  that  are 
routinely  considered  in  the  conduct  of  exposure,  including  during 
emergent  risk  periods,  it  is  clear  that  clinicians  are  quite  capable  of 
navigating these issues, and are in fact ethically mandated to do so. 

5. Exposure therapy for non¡OCD anxiety including COVID 
stress syndrome 

Exposure therapy remains the mainstay psychological treatment for 
non-OCD  anxiety  disorders  (Bandelow  et  al.,  2018)  and  should  be 
adapted considering the above points. Across individuals with OCD and 
anxiety disorders, it would be well advised to monitor COVID-19 related 
stress with scales such as the COVID-19 Stress Scales (CSS) (Taylor et al., 
2020a).  This  tool,  which  demonstrates  good  reliability  and  validity, 
assesses danger/contamination fears, fears of economic consequences, 
xenophobia,  compulsive  safety  behaviors,  and  traumatic  stress  symp-
toms linked to COVID-19 (Taylor et al., 2020a). Indeed, as noted earlier, 
there is a COVID Stress Syndrome that has been conceptualized based on 
these factors (Taylor et al., 2020a, 2020b). Given that the core element 
in  this  syndrome  reflects  anxiogenic  thought  processes  driving  anx-
iety/distress 
behaviors, 
exposure-based  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  which  targets  distorted 
cognitions  and  excessive  safety  behaviors  is  likely  to  be  of  utility  for 
those struggling with heightened COVID-19 related distress.

safety 

and, 

Even  prior  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic, ERP  has  not  been  without 
controversy and hesitation, even among mental health professionals. A 
2013 study by Deacon et al. showed that there was a moderate degree of 
negative  opinions  regarding  ERP  among  over  600  surveyed  psycho-
therapists (Deacon et al., 2013). Aside from any ethical concerns sur-
rounding the core goal of the therapy, there may be concerns regarding 
litigation  surrounding  the  practice  of  ERP,  especially  in  light  of  the 
pandemic. 

Regarding any past legal cases or ethical grievances, a 2006 study by 
Richard and Gloster did not find any litigation involving ERP providers. 
For patients to file a civil suit against their psychotherapists, the patients 
must have felt that they endured “undue harm” from ERP; therefore, this 
lack of evidence regarding any past litigation illustrates that, despite any 
perceived level of discomfort during their ERP treatment, patients do not 
truly  view  the  practices  as  harmful  (Richard  &  Gloster,  2007).  Any 
discussions  or  potential  concerns  surrounding  possible  legal  conse-
quences of conducting ERP should involve the informed consent given to 
and received by patients prior to starting therapy. Providing a thorough 
informed consent can not only create a strong foundation of trust and 
alliance before engaging in therapy but also fulfills a professional and 
legal  duty  to  respect  patient  autonomy  and  right  to  their  own 
decision-making  (Trachsel,  Holtforth,  Biller-Andorno,  &  Appelbaum, 
2015).  However,  many  psychotherapies  still  do  not  have  a  routine 
informed consent (Trachsel et al., 2015). Oftentimes, patients express 
understanding  of  their  therapy  through  an  informal  agreement  with 
their psychotherapist without having a clear, formal discussion about 
proceedings and goals of the therapy. The alternatives to the treatment 
and possible outcomes were also not routinely reviewed when providing 
informed consent as well (Dsubanko-Obermayr & Baumann, 1998). 

Therefore, clinicians can improve patient understanding by explic-
itly discussing treatment procedures, goals, and potential risks of ERP in 
a more thorough and formal informed consent process and by staying 
mindful of the pandemic restrictions and guidelines. While patients are 
still engaging in other essential therapies (e.g. dialysis, chemotherapy) 
in-person that may also carry a risk of COVID-19 exposure, the benefits 
of receiving these treatments greatly outweigh that risk. Similarly, ERP 
is an essential and empirically supported therapy that can be a patient’s 
best chance at treating OCD symptoms. As part of this clinical analysis, it 
is assumed that clinicians practice good hygiene to mitigate their own 
risk of contracting COVID-19, or if not, that they are at least cognizant of 
the recommended standards. With this knowledge, they can then deliver 
ERP to contamination fearful clients in a manner aimed at ensuring a 
balance  between  risk  and  alleviating  anxiety  due  to  OCD.  This  is  no 
different than delivering exposure for specific fears and phobias in re-
gions  where  the  risk  of  harm  may  be  higher  (i.e.,  the  Southwest  and 
hantavirus infection). In light of the consistent finding that exposure- 
based treatment provides significant benefit for anxiety and OCD suf-
ferers, the remedy for addressing contamination fear in the era of COVID 
may  not  be  suspending  the  intervention,  but  instead  more  careful 
training  of  clinicians  about  the  physical  and  litigation  risks.  Indeed, 
inflated  litigation  risk  is  a  significant  predictor  of  disuse  of  exposure 
treatment (Becker-Haimes et al., 2017). 

7. Case study1 

Approximately one month prior to the onset of the pandemic, one of 
the authors (DM) initiated treatment with a woman (pseudonym Janet), 
age 34, who presented with severe contamination fear. At the initiation 
of treatment, she was married for nine years and had two children (ages 
7 and 5). She reported a 14-year history of contamination fear and had

been in general psychotherapy for much of that time. She briefly sus-
pended  her  general  psychotherapy  course  of  treatment  to  pursue 
cognitive-behavior therapy, but rather than receive ERP, the clinician 
administered stress management and relaxation training. Janet reported 
no benefit from this course of treatment, and had returned to her general 
psychotherapist. 

When  Janet  initiated  treatment,  she  had  severe  symptoms  (Abra-
movitch,  Abramowitz,  Riemann,  &  McKay,  2020)  according  to  the 
Obsessive-Compulsive  Inventory-Revised  (OCI-R;  (Foa  et  al.,  2002), 
with a score of 36. During the first four sessions (pre-pandemic), back-
ground information and hierarchy development was the primary focus 
of treatment. In the session immediately prior to the shutdown due to 
the  pandemic,  exposure  was  initiated.  This  involved  asking  Janet  to 
touch a tissue to the clinician’s office floor and carry it with her every 
day until the next session. 

At session 5, most businesses in the area shut down to mitigate the 
spread  of  COVID-19.  Janet  reported  significant  distress  and  fear  of 
contracting the illness. She was readministered the OCI-R, and her score 
increased from the initial administration pre-pandemic to 42. This ses-
sion was the first conducted with Janet via web camera. In discussing 
her concerns with the therapist during this session, she considered sus-
pending treatment. As hygienic recommendations were rapidly chang-
ing,  the  therapist  and  Janet  decided  to  take  a  short  hiatus  from 
treatment,  but  with  weekly  email  correspondence.  After  one  month, 
Janet reinitiated treatment via telehealth. The hierarchy was revised to 
include COVID-19 fears such as: walking outside on the street with no 
other pedestrians without a mask; washing only prior to meals while in 
the house, assuming that she had no ventured out in public; and walking 
in a park while wearing a mask and with other pedestrians visible at a 
distance  (more  than  15  feet).  Given  that  restrictions  on  telehealth 
platforms had been relaxed, Janet conducted these exposure exercises 
with the therapist while using a smartphone app (FaceTime). 

Janet  attended  seven  more  sessions  of  telehealth  treatment  where 
the focus was on COVID-19 contamination fear. At this point, her level of 
contamination concerns mirrored those of her husband. To verify that 
her husband was relatively unaffected by obsessive-compulsive symp-
toms, the OCI-R was administered to him (following client consent), and 
he had a score of 3, which is technically in the mild range, but would be 
considered negligible (Abramovitch et al., 2020). 

Once Janet’s COVID-19 fears were alleviated, her other contamina-
tion concerns were targeted as intended at the outset of treatment. This 
was  practiced  for  another  seven  sessions,  focusing  on  pre-pandemic 
contamination-based  stimuli  in  her  home  (i.e.,  areas  of  her  basement 
boiler  room;  some  food  related  concerns;  and  bodily  waste).  At  this 
point, after a total of 19 sessions (four pre-pandemic; one immediately 
post  pandemic;  seven  COVID-19  contamination  focused;  seven  pre- 
pandemic contamination fear focused) the OCI-R was readministered. 
Janet had a score of twelve, corresponding to a mild severity level. As of 
this writing, Janet is still receiving telehealth treatment with DM, with 
intervention focused on non-OCD related anxiety symptoms. 

8. Conclusion 

This clinical review outlines potential current and long-term effects 
of modifying care for OCD patients in light of a pandemic. While ERP 
must be modified accordingly to accepted public health guidelines, we 
caution against modifying therapies in a way that may jeopardize the 
efficacy of patient care or progress.
