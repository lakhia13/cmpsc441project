Abstract: Studies suggest that the bidirectional relationship existent between the gut microbiome
(GM) and the central nervous system (CNS), or so-called the microbiome–gut–brain axis (MGBA), is
involved in diverse neuropsychiatric diseases in children and adults. In pediatric age, most studies
have focused on patients with autism. However, evidence of the role played by the MGBA in
attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common neurodevelopmental disorder
in childhood, is still scanty and heterogeneous. This review aims to provide the current evidence
on the functioning of the MGBA in pediatric patients with ADHD and the speciﬁc role of omega-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) in this interaction, as well as the potential of the GM as a
therapeutic target for ADHD. We will explore: (1) the diverse communication pathways between
the GM and the CNS; (2) changes in the GM composition in children and adolescents with ADHD
and association with ADHD pathophysiology; (3) inﬂuence of the GM on the ω-3 PUFA imbalance
characteristically found in ADHD; (4) interaction between the GM and circadian rhythm regulation,
as sleep disorders are frequently comorbid with ADHD; (5) ﬁnally, we will evaluate the most recent
studies on the use of probiotics in pediatric patients with ADHD.

1. Introduction

Billions of microorganisms inhabit the human body (“microbiota”), including bacteria,
archaea, fungi, viruses and protozoa. They and their genes (“microbiome”) are involved in
different biological functions, some of them are essential for our survival [1–3]. in particular,
the microbiota living in the digestive tract is composed of more than 104 microorganisms
from 300–3000 different species, which encode 200 times the number of human genes [4,5].
The gut bacteria mainly include six major phyla of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria,
Actinomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria, with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes as the
dominant ones [6]. This rich and diverse gut microbiome is of utmost importance, as it has
far-reaching implications in a variety of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal functions.
They participate in the metabolism and absorption of nutrients, including carbohydrates
and proteins, bile acid, vitamins and other bioactive compounds [3,7]. Regarding the
non-gastrointestinal functions, the gut microbiome has been reported to impact on the
brain development [8–11] and the maturation of the immune [12] and neuroendocrine
systems [13,14]. As a matter of fact, this impact takes place only during a critical period in
growth and development and it cannot be reversed afterwards [12,15]. The effects caused
by the gut microbiome begin even before birth, as the embryonic development is also
inﬂuenced by the maternal gut microbiome [16].

The relationship between the gut microbiome and their host is bidirectional [17], so
that human beings also regulate the composition and number of the microorganisms that
colonize the digestive tract through factors related to diet, health and lifestyle. Modern-
ization and its consequent changes in the human diet, including dietary patterns, habits
and food processing, have greatly inﬂuenced the gut microbiome [18–20]. Modernization
has also changed the delivery mode, with an increasing number of women undergoing
caesarian sections, which has had an impact on the composition of the commensal micro-
biome [21]. Another major inﬂuence is exerted by modern advances in medicine and the
ongoing development of new pharmacological treatments, particularly those for chronic
conditions [22].

Modern life and the consequent impact on the gut microbiome have also made fun-
damental changes in the pattern of human illnesses, which has shifted from traditional
infectious diseases towards increasingly frequent autoimmune diseases, such as asthma
and allergies; cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension; metabolic diseases, like dia-
betes; mental diseases, such as depression and anxiety; and a variety of neurological and
neurodevelopmental disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson, autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deﬁcit and/or hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
All of these conditions have been associated with an imbalance in the gut microbiome
composition [23,24].

In this review, we will focus on the participation of the gut microbiome into the patho-
physiological mechanisms of ADHD and the therapeutic potential of these microorganisms
in pediatric patients with this disorder.

2. Gut Microbiome and Neurodevelopment: The Gut–Brain Axis

The term “gut–brain axis” has been coined to describe the bidirectional communication
between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system (CNS) [25,26]. This axis is
also referred to as the “microbiota–gut–brain axis” (MGBA), to emphasize the participation
of the gut microbiota in this interaction [27]. Three main pathways conﬁgure this axis: the
nerve pathway, the neuroendocrine pathway and the immune pathway (Figure 1).

2.1. Nerve Pathway

The gut is innervated by the hepatic and celiac branches of the vagus nerve. Depend-
ing on their location and type, vagal afferents detect a variety of mechanic (stretch, tension)
and chemical stimuli (bacterial by-products, gut hormones, neurotransmitters) [28]. The
vagus nerve plays a substantial role in mood regulation. Examples of this are the thera-
peutic use of vagus nerve stimulation in refractory depression [29] and chronic pain [30],
probably associated with a modulation of catecholamine release in brain regions related to
anxiety and depression [29]. A recent study in murine models reported that activation of
gastrointestinal vagal afferents inﬂuence reward behavior [31]. The gut microbiome has
the capacity to modulate the host’s emotional and behavioral responses by acting on the
vagal afferents. In animal models, infections by pathogens like Campylobacter jejuni and
Citrobacter amalonaticus induced anxiety-like behavior [32], whereas supplementation with
probiotics including Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Biﬁdobacterium longum alleviated these
anxiety/depression-like conducts [33,34]. Interestingly, the behavioral effects induced
by Lactobacillus reuteri in genetic mouse models of autism were halted in vagotomized
mice [35].

Another important network of neurons lying between the microbiota and the host
is conﬁgured by the enteric nervous system (ENS), which is composed of the myenteric
and submucosal plexus. The ENS communicates with the CNS via afferent neurons with
sensory information that follow spinal and vagal routes, and it is responsible for the
coordination of gut functions, such as motility and ﬂuid movement [36]. Maturation and
functions of the ENS seem to be inﬂuenced by the gut microbiome. Germ-free (GF) mice
displayed signiﬁcant abnormalities in the ENS structure and neurochemistry in the early
postnatal period, which disappeared after colonization [37]. The pathways through which

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

the gut microbiome plays a role in the ENS are yet to be clariﬁed. They may involve the
activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [38],
and the expression of serotonin (5-HT4) receptors [39].

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the three pathways (nerve, neuroendocrine and immune) that
conﬁgure the microbiome–gut–brain axis. CRH: corticotropin-releasing hormone; ACTH: adrenocor-
ticotropic hormone; MC2-R: melanocortin receptor 2. CD4+ T cell: CD4-positive T cell.

The gut microbiome may impact on the generation of neurotransmitters, either by
synthesizing them “de novo” or by inﬂuencing the neurotransmitter-related metabolism
pathways. Bacterial species of Clostridium perfringens modulates the synthesis of 5-HT
via the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase-1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in
its synthesis [40]. In fact, concentrations of this neurotransmitter, which is involved in
socio-affective processing, anxiety and fear [41,42], were found signiﬁcantly reduced in GF
mice [43]. As 5-HT impacts on gut motility, it can now be suggested that the gut microbiome
regulates intestinal motility through the serotonergic system [44]. The gut microbiome also
inﬂuences dopamine (DA) levels in the frontal cortex and striatum in rodents, two brain
areas involved in executive functions [45]. It has been extensively reported that disruptions
in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are associated with the appearance of mood-
related disorders and cognitive functions [46,47]. Therefore, the connections established
between these neurotransmitters and the gut microbiome may provide evidence for the
role of these microorganisms in the pathophysiology of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders,
such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as
ASD and ADHD [48,49]. Other neurotransmitters, such as glutamate (Glu) and gamma-

Nerve Pathway The gut is innervated by the hepatic and celiac branches of the vagus nerve. De-pending on their location and type, vagal afferents detect a variety of mechanic (stretch, tension) and chemical stimuli (bacterial by-products, gut hormones, neurotransmitters) [28]. The vagus nerve plays a substantial role in mood regulation. Examples of this are the therapeutic use of vagus nerve stimulation in refractory depression [29] and chronic pain [30], probably associated with a modulation of catecholamine release in brain re-gions related to anxiety and depression [29]. A recent study in murine models reported that activation of gastrointestinal vagal afferents influence reward behavior [31]. The gut microbiome has the capacity to modulate the host’s emotional and behavioral responses by acting on the vagal afferents. In animal models, infections by pathogens like Campyl-obacter jejuni and Citrobacter amalonaticus induced anxiety-like behavior [32], whereas supplementation with probiotics including Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum alleviated these anxiety/depression-like conducts [33,34].

aminobutyric acid (GABA), are also synthesized by the gut microbiota [50,51]. In a recent
systematic review, gut microbiota including Campylobacter jejuni and Bacteroides vulgatus
was found to inﬂuence cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer’s disease via Glu
metabolism [52].

The intestinal microbiome is also involved in the kynurenine pathway, which is in
turn implicated in neuroinﬂammation processes associated with schizophrenia and depres-
sion [53]. Mice that developed symptoms of schizophrenia after being transplanted with fe-
cal microbiota from drug-free patients with schizophrenia, were found to exhibit increased
levels of kynurenic acid in periphery and brain [54]. A reduced conversion of tryptophan
into kynurenine metabolites have been found in GF mice [55]. The interaction between the
gut microbiome and the enzymes involved in the kynurenine pathway (indoleamine-2,3-
dioxygenase and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase) seem to be mediated through the immune
responses to stress [56] and redox imbalance [57]. Indeed, a correlation was found between
reduced concentrations of L. reuteri and increased serum levels of kynurenines in mice
exposed to chronic stress, which was secondary to bacterial regulation of kynurenine
enzymes via the production of H2O2 [58].

As reported in animal studies, the gut microbiome regulates the expression of the brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is involved in neurogenesis [59,60]. In adults
with mild cognitive impairment, cognitive and attentional enhancement were reported
after the administration of Lactobacillus plantarum for 12 weeks, which were associated
with an increase in BDNF levels [61]. Lower levels of myelination in total brain and
major grey and white matter structures at either 4 or 12 weeks of age were also found
in GF mice [62]. In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, fecal microbiota transplantation
rebuilt the gut microbiome and provided therapeutic beneﬁts by conferring protection
on the myelin, with additional effects on the blood–brain barrier and the populations
of astrocytes [63]. The apoptosis and neurodegeneration seem to be inﬂuenced by the
gut microbiome, as neonatal GF mice exhibited increased apoptosis in the hypothalamus
and the hippocampus in comparison with conventional mice [64]. Alterations of the gut
microbiome may additionally lead to the promotion of amyloid formation [65], whereas
probiotic supplementation can prevent or even stop this process [18,66].

2.2. Neuroendocrine Pathway

The gut microbiome is essential in the development and function of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which represents the crux of the neuroendocrine transmission
and the stress response system [14]. In GF mice, the HPA axis response was exaggerated
and the sensitivity to negative feedback signals was reduced. The administration of
Biﬁdobacterium infantis at an early stage reversed this response [13,14]. In human patients
with irritable bowel syndrome, exaggerated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and
cortisol responses were observed after infusion of corticotropin-release factor (CRF) [67],
together with a dysfunctional microbiota [68]. The gut microbiome directly inﬂuences the
production of glucocorticoids and immune mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-α) and interleukins-1beta and 6 (IL-1β and IL-6), which in turn stimulates the HPA
axis [69].

The gut microbiome modulates the secretion of gastrointestinal peptides that mediate
metabolic functions related to energy homeostasis, such as insulin, leptin, ghrelin, neu-
ropeptide Y family (NPY) and glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) [70]. Microbial disturbances
induce insulin resistance, which is alleviated after microbial restoration [71,72]. The NPY
family consists of different neuropeptides involved in energy homeostasis, mood and
stress responses [73]. The gut microbiome recognizes NPYs and modulates their synthesis
and secretion [73,74]. Oxytocin participates in a variety of activities, such as parturition,
lactation, social interaction and stress response [75]. Offspring born to mothers taking
a high-fat diet exhibited social deﬁcits, abnormalities in the gut microbiota and a reduc-
tion in the hypothalamic neurons immunoreactive to oxytocin. These alterations could
be prevented by cohousing with offspring of mothers on a regular diet or by treatment

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

with L. reuteri [76]. Functions of the endogenous opioid system are essential in analgesia,
tolerance and dependence [77]. Opioids have the capacity to alter gut microbial diversity,
whereas the gut microbiome mediates tolerance to their analgesic effects [78,79].

The intestinal microbiome produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly bu-
tyrate, propionic acid and acetate, mostly derived from the degradation of ﬁbres and
undigested saccharides [80]. They serve as important mitochondrial fuels, particularly
under conditions of inﬂammation, starvation and physical strain [81,82]. In animal studies
using GF and speciﬁc-pathogen free (SPF) mice, SCFAs were reported to affect mitochon-
drial energy metabolism through a variety of transcription factors, such as the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-α) [83–85]. Although the mechanisms are yet
to be unraveled, SCFAs also may combat the oxidative stress which is predominant during
proinﬂammatory states by upregulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes, like glu-
tathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase [86]. Additionally, butyrate has anti-inﬂammatory
properties, as it induces the release of the anti-inﬂammatory IL-10, whereas inhibits proin-
ﬂammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12) [87]. In a mouse model of depression, reduced fecal
concentrations of SCFAs were found. Administration of the carotenoid crocin-I for 6 weeks
improved symptoms by alleviating the gut microbial dysbiosis and increasing SCFAs in
feces [88].

The gut microbiome also creates other substances derived from the metabolism of
proteins and amine acids, such as ammonia (NH3) [89], which in excessive levels (hyper-
ammoniemia) represents an important risk factor for neurological diseases, like hepatic
encephalopathy and autism [90].

2.3. Immune Pathway

The development and integrity of the gut barrier and the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
are dependent on the gut microbiome. Alterations of the gut microbiome downregulate
the expression of the tight junctions (TJs) [91], exposing both organs to biomacromolecules
and microorganisms and triggering the neuroinﬂammation process [92].

The intestinal microbiome regulates the differentiation and maturations of innate
immunocytes, such as macrophages, innate lymphoid cells and dendritic cells [93]. Highly
specialized macrophages that are CNS tissue-resident constitute the microglia, which ac-
count for 5–15% of total brain cells. The microglia plays an important role in neurogenesis
and the shaping of neuronal circuits, having implications for the further development
of cognitive functions and social behavior [94]. During later developmental stages and
adulthood, this tissue adopts a predominantly immune function activating either pro- or
anti-inﬂammatory signaling cascades depending on the nature of the insult. Microglia from
mice with a limited microbial complexity displayed genetic and morphological features
similar to the microglia observed in GF mice. These alterations were reversed by recoloniza-
tion of the gut microbiome through 6-week cohabitation of GF mice with control mice [95].
Therefore, a constant input from the gut microbiome is required by the microglia to ade-
quately fulﬁll their role in neuronal maturation and immune surveillance [96]. Additionally,
the gut microbiome inﬂuences the recruitment of ‘trafﬁcking’ monocytes from the periph-
ery to the brain [97]. This recruitment seems to be mediated by the TNF-α and reversed by
the administration of probiotics in preclinical studies [98]. The free fatty acid receptors 2
(FFAR 2), which are G protein-coupled receptors located in peripheral lymphocites, may
also be involved in this trafﬁcking [99]. This would provide additional support for the
implication of the gut microbiome, as SCFAs are natural ligands for FFARs [100].

Acquired immunity develops and matures during exposure to the gut microbiota.
Intraepithelial lymphocytes (CD4/CD8 double-positive alpha-alpha T cells speciﬁcally)
were reported to require the presence of L. reuteri, together with a tryptophan-rich diet,
to reprogram intraepithelial CD4-positive T cells into immunoregulatory T cells [101]. In
a study exploring the effects of chronic stress on long-lasting altered levels of IL-10+ T
regulatory cells, an association was found between the concentrations of IL-10 and the

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

6 of 32

abundance of Clostridium [102]. Absence of microbiota also reduces the content of im-
munoglobulins A and G1 (IgA and IgG1) and increases the levels of immunoglobulin E
(IgE), thereby inducing the appearance of diverse diseases [12]. A recent study determined
the microbial composition and immunoglobulin proﬁle in fecal samples from 32 healthy
infants with a high risk of developing type 1 diabetes as determined by human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) genotyping. IgA levels correlated with relative abundances of Biﬁdobacteria
and Enterobacteriaceae, whereas IgG levels were associated with Haemophilus [103].

3. Microbiota–Gut–Brain Axis and Attention-Deﬁcit and/or Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD)
3.1. ADHD: Clinical and Pathophysiological Aspects

ADHD is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents,
affecting 5% of individuals younger than 18 years [104,105]. It is characterized by the
permanent and impairing presence of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity.
These core symptoms must appear before the age of 12 in accordance with the new diag-
nostic criteria (DSM-5) [106]. The course of this disorder is variable, and some symptoms
may persist into adulthood in around 40–60% of cases [107]. ADHD impacts on many
aspects of an individual’s wellbeing, including physical health and academic, social and
occupational functioning. It is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric and neurological
conditions, such as ASD, mood disorders, epilepsy or sleep problems, creating a substantial
burden for the individual, their family and the community [108]. Psychostimulants, and
methylphenidate (MPH) in particular, represent the ﬁrst-line medication for moderate
and severe cases of ADHD in children from 5 years and over and in young patients [109].
Its efﬁcacy mainly lies in increasing the extracellular levels of DA and norepinephrine
(NE) [110], although it has additional effects on other neurotransmitter systems also in-
volved in ADHD pathophysiology, such as 5-HT [111] and even Glu [112]. However, the
long-term use of psychostimulants is often limited by poor compliance and tolerability
problems derived from the combination of adverse effects, ADHD-related stigma and social
resistance to medication, particularly in adolescents [113,114].

Numerous etiological factors have been attributed to ADHD: genetic factors, which
represent around 70–80% [115]; and diverse environmental factors, including perinatal
factors (prematurity, low birthweight) and psychosocial determinants (adoption, child
neglect) [116–118]. The pathophysiology of ADHD is yet to be clariﬁed. ADHD symp-
toms are associated with deﬁcits in executive functions, such as behavioral inhibition,
working memory, set-shifting, planning and organization [119]. The neuroanatomical
basis for this impairment has traditionally been located in the prefrontal cortex [120,121].
However, several large neural networks have also been implicated in ADHD recently,
particularly the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, which is associated with motivated
behaviors, anticipated outcomes and reinforced learning [108,119]. In fact, it has been
suggested that the alteration of the catecholaminergic neurotransmission system could be
the main pathophysiological factor for ADHD [122,123].

Nowadays, there is increasing evidence that the aforementioned etiological factors
and catecholaminergic dysfunction may lead to a neuronal state predominantly charac-
terized by oxidative stress and inﬂammation, which could perpetuate the neurochemical
alterations responsible for ADHD [124]. Increased levels of oxidative and nitrosative (NO)
stress markers, together with a decrease in the concentrations of antioxidants, have been
found in ADHD [125,126]. Furthermore, an alteration in the mitochondrial number and
function in the dopaminergic neurons have been reported in individuals with ADHD
in comparison with controls [127,128]. A dysregulation of the mitochondrial function
provokes an uncontrolled production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive oxy-
gen nitrogen species (RONS), which are by-products of the oxidative reactions leading
to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [129]. Excessive levels of ROS/RONS
harm the integrity of neurons by oxidating the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that
constitute their membranes, as well as alter the apoptotic mechanisms. ROS/RONS also
prompt the activation of the microglia and the release of inﬂammatory cytokines and the

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

7 of 32

nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain
containing 3 (NLRP3) inﬂammasome, creating a vicious cycle [130,131]. In fact, Oades
et al. [132] reported elevated levels of the inﬂammatory interleukins IL-16 and IL-13 in
children with ADHD, which would respectively be associated with hyperactive-impulsive
symptoms and inattention.

3.2. Differential Gut Microbial Proﬁles in Patients with ADHD: Association with Symptoms and
Pathophysiological Implications

Aarts et al. [133] were the ﬁrst authors to report microbial composition differences
in Dutch young adult patients with ADHD using the next-generation sequencing of 16S
rDNA in fecal samples. No signiﬁcant differences in either alpha diversity (within-sample),
which accounts for species richness, or beta diversity (between-sample), which indicates
differences in diversity between the two cohorts, were found between ADHD patients and
healthy controls. However, within the phylum Actinobacteria, the genus Biﬁdobacterium
was signiﬁcantly increased in the ADHD cohort. The authors also predicted bacterial gene
function in relation to the metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of phenylalanine,
tyrosine and tryptophan. Interestingly, the relative abundance in the genus Biﬁdobacterium
was correlated with a signiﬁcant increase in the enzyme cyclohexadienyl dehydratase
(CDT), which is involved in the synthesis of a dopaminergic precursor (phenylalanine).
In a subset of 28 participants, independent of diagnosis, Aarts et al. also performed
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis to correlate the differences in
microbial composition with neural reward responses. They observed a negative association
between the relative abundance of CDT and reward anticipation responses in bilateral
ventral striatum. Reward anticipation, which is dependent on DA neurotransmission [134],
is crucial to direct actions towards positively balanced stimuli and has been reported to be
reduced in ADHD patients [135]. Aarts et al. highlighted that the differential microbiome
composition found between patients with ADHD and controls in their study may account
for altered reward anticipation responses, which is a neural hallmark of ADHD. The
novelty of this study resided in it representing the ﬁrst report on a genetic capacity of
the gut microbiome to impact on the dopaminergic metabolic pathways in patients with
ADHD. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations:
ﬁrst, the age gap between controls and cases (27.1 vs. 19.5 years in average), as well as
the differences in sample sizes (controls = 77 participants; ADHD subjects = 17 patients);
second, the intake of medications by ADHD patients was not reported in detail; third,
differences between groups in relation to potential confounders, such as dietary patterns
or the intake of antibiotics, which could have inﬂuenced the differences found, were
not mentioned either; ﬁnally, the inclusion of unaffected ADHD patients’ siblings in the
could have affected the representativeness of the control group. The gut microbiome of
siblings to ADHD patients could express an intermediate phenotype between patients and
non-related controls. Therefore, it may not represent an appropriate reference group for
comparison [136].

In order to avoid the potential interference of ADHD medication, Jiang et al. [137]
analyzed the microbial composition of a group of 51 treatment-naïve ADHD children, and
compared it with a cohort of 32 healthy controls. No signiﬁcant differences in alpha or beta
diversity were found between groups, but a signiﬁcantly lower concentration of the genus
Faecalibacterium (from the family Ruminococcaceae) was reported in the ADHD group.
These authors also found a negative association between the abundance of Faecalibacterium
and parental reports of ADHD symptoms. Interestingly, low levels of Faecalibacterium have
been reported in atopic diseases such as asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis [138], which
seem to be independently associated with ADHD [139]. Jiang et al. explained that the
differences between their results and those obtained by Aarts et al. [133] could be due to
differences in the age of the patients and the dietary pattern: the Chinese diet versus the
typical high-fat Western dietary pattern. The main limitation of the study conducted by
Jiang et al. was precisely its cross-sectional design, which prevented the authors inferring
any conclusions about causality. By contrast, the methodology of this study was robust in

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

8 of 32

terms of the selection and comparability between study samples: no signiﬁcant differences
in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI) or perinatal factors were found between
patients and controls; the authors stratiﬁed for possible confounding factors, such as the
use of previous use of probiotics/antibiotics, the current use of ADHD medication, the
presence of atopic diseases and gastrointestinal, depressive or anxiety symptoms.

A recent study, conducted by Szopinska-Tokov et al. [140] on a Dutch sample of 42 ado-
lescents and young adults with ADHD, revealed a signiﬁcant increase of a genus from the
family Ruminococcaceae. However, in this case the genus was Ruminococcaceae_UGC_004,
which was found to be associated with inattention symptoms. This association was not
affected by the intake of ADHD medication. Szopinska-Tokov et al. compared the ADHD
population with other two cohorts of patients: subthreshold ADHD group, composed of
individuals who did not reach the criteria for ADHD but scored too high to be considered
healthy controls; and the control group, which included unaffected siblings of ADHD
patients, although the family relatedness was a factor considered in the statistical anal-
ysis. The alpha diversity was not signiﬁcantly different between groups, although the
beta diversity was reported to be signiﬁcantly reduced among patients with ADHD, and
this correlated with inattention scores. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)
available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was used to search
for similarities between protein and nucleotide regions. Consequently, the authors found
that the genus Ruminococcaceae_UGC_004 shared sequences with microbial species with the
ability to consume the GABA neurotransmitter. The novelty of this study was to provide
new evidence on the role of the gut microbiome in neurotransmitter systems related to
ADHD pathophysiology, via similarity between biological sequences. However, the main
limitations of Szopinska-Tokov et al.’s study were related to the selection and comparability
between samples: no information in relation to the recruitment process of the control and
subthreshold ADHD samples was reported; information on lifestyle and dietary patterns,
which may have interfered with the results, was not collected by the authors; intake of
ADHD medication was registered through self-reports or parental reports on the day of
measurement, which could have introduced a recall bias.

Prehn-Kristensen et al. [141] analyzed the differences in the microbial composition
between a German population of 14 adolescents with ADHD and a cohort of 17 non-related
controls. No differences in dietary intake were found between the two cohorts. A next-
generation sequencing of 16S rDNA in fecal samples was performed. Alpha diversity
was signiﬁcantly reduced in patients with ADHD, and negatively correlated with the
levels of hyperactivity. Beta diversity was also signiﬁcantly different between the two
cohorts, due to distinct abundances of different microbial taxa: at the genus level, Prevotella
and Parabacteroides were detected as markers for the control group, whereas Neisseria was
identiﬁed as marker for the ADHD group. At the family level, a signiﬁcantly higher
abundance of Bacteroidaceae was found in ADHD samples in comparison with controls.
Interestingly, the reduction in alpha diversity was also observed in the mothers of ADHD
patients, but not between the fathers of ADHD patients and controls. This ﬁnding suggests
that alterations in the microbiome composition might be passed on maternally to the
children. However, the study of Prehn-Kristensen et al. had several limitations: ﬁrst, the
small sample size; second, as no female patients were included in this study, it was not
possible to explore if sex could inﬂuence the differences found; third, most ADHD patients
were on medication, which was interrupted 48 h before being tested. This, however, might
not have allowed enough time to avoid the potential impact of medication on microbial
patterns [142]. The originality of this study was to provide some evidence in relation to the
vertical transmission of microbial features. On the other hand, the overall quality of this
study was reduced by the lack of representativeness of the samples, as all patients were
males and no detailed description was provided in relation to the sources from which cases
and controls were enrolled.

In a Chinese pediatric population, Wan et al. [143] compared the microbial composi-
tion of fecal samples between 17 patients with ADHD and 17 non-related healthy controls

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

using shotgun metagenomics sequencing. No signiﬁcant differences in alpha diversity
were found between the two cohorts. At the genus level, Faecalibacterium (family Ru-
minococcaceae) was signiﬁcantly decreased in ADHD patients, whereas the concentrations
of Odoribacter (order Bacteroidales) and Enterococcus were signiﬁcantly higher. At the species
level, Bacteroides caccae, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Paraprevotella xylaniphila and Veillonella
parvula were signiﬁcantly increased in the ADHD group. The authors also analyzed the
metabolic pathways associated with the microbial genes that were signiﬁcantly different
between the two samples of patients. Alterations in genes encoding enzymes involved in
the dopaminergic synaptic pathways were found in the ADHD group. Faecalibacterium
may exert anti-inﬂammatory effects, and their abnormal levels may lead to a higher ex-
pression of inﬂammatory factors that could contribute to ADHD pathogenesis [144,145].
Enterococcus has been reported to be associated with neurotransmitter release. It could
lead to excessive intestinal conversion of levodopa into DA. However, peripheral DA is
not able to cross the BBB to enter the CNS, therefore reducing the effectiveness of lev-
odopa [146]. Additionally, signiﬁcant higher levels of Enterococcus have been found in mice
lacking the 5-HT transporter, which can lead to decreased 5-HT concentrations [147], a
neurotransmitter also involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD. The higher concentra-
tions of Odoribacter found by Wan et al. in ADHD patients were in line with a previous
study that found increased levels of this genus in pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric
syndrome (PAN) and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with
streptococcal infections (PANDAS) [148]. The main limitations of this study were the small
sample size and the lack of information on the intake of ADHD medication. Additionally,
the authors did not establish associations between ADHD core symptoms and microbial
composition. However, the quality of this study is supported by its robust methodology:
detailed description of the recruitment procedure; stratiﬁcation for confounding factors
in both samples (probiotics, allergic diseases, digestive or respiratory symptoms, dietary
habits); and the use of whole genome shot gun sequencing (WGS), which provides a much
more reliable estimation of the functional potential of the microbiome in comparison with
the sequencing of 16S rDNA subunits of highly conserved genetic sequences [149].

Casas et al. [150] conducted a case-cohort study to investigate the inﬂuence of in-
door microbial diversity early in life on the development of hyperactivity/inattention
symptoms. Patients (n = 226) were selected from the Inﬂuence of Life-style factors on the
development of the Immune System and Allergies in East and West Germany (LISA) birth
cohort. This was a population study in which healthy full-term neonates were recruited
from different hospitals in Germany and their bedrooms’ ﬂoor dust samples were collected
at the age of 3 months. Indoor bacterial and fungal diversity were respectively analyzed
by 16S rDNA gene sequencing and high-throughput sequencing. Fungal and bacterial
alpha diversity metrics were calculated (richness, Shannon, Simpson and Chao1 diversity
indices). The Strength and Difﬁculty Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to evaluate hyper-
activity/inattention behavior at the ages of 10 and 15 years. A total of 23 children at the
age of 10 years reached criteria for ADHD, while this number increased to 50 individuals
at the age of 15 years. At the age of 10, bacterial richness (number of different taxa) was
found to be inversely correlated with ADHD prevalence, whereas the number of fungal
species was positively associated with a high prevalence. However, at the age of 15, only
the Shannon index was signiﬁcantly associated with hyperactivity/inattention symptoms,
directly for bacteria and inversely for fungi. Therefore, this study suggests that early life
microbial environment may be associated with the development of behavioral problems
during childhood. However, the direction of the associations observed was heterogeneous
and the observational design of the study did not allow establishing causality. Furthermore,
the authors did not consider other confounding factors which could have inﬂuenced the
results, such as certain lifestyles or the exposure to phthalates. With the collection of
dust samples at one single time-point (3 months of age), changes in the indoor microbial
environment across time were not considered either. An additional limitation of the study
conducted by Casas et al. was in relation to the representativeness of the sample: the

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

10 of 32

assessment of inattention/hyperactivity symptoms was only based on scores obtained in
the parent-completed and self-completed Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire (SDQ),
which could have introduced a reporting bias.

In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial carried out by Stevens et al. [151], 17 male
children with ADHD from New Zealand were randomized to take capsules containing
placebo (n = 7) or a blend of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (n = 10) for a period of
10 weeks. The aim was to investigate the effect of micronutrient supplementation on the
human fecal microbiome composition. Sequencing of 16S rDNA was performed on fecal
samples collected at baseline and after supplementation. Micronutrient supplementation
was associated with 50% responder rates vs. 29% responder rates in the placebo group. The
response resulted in enhanced overall function, improved attention, emotional regulation
and aggression. However, no signiﬁcant differences in the scores obtained in either the Chil-
dren’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) or the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) were
found between the treatment and the placebo group. There were no signiﬁcant changes
in the alpha or beta diversity between the placebo and the micronutrient group, although
patients receiving micronutrients showed increased community richness after 10 weeks
supplementation in comparison with placebo. Micronutrient supplementation caused a
signiﬁcant decrease of the phylum Actinobacterium, particularly a 25% reduction in the
order Biﬁdobacteriales, which was attributed to the genus Biﬁdobacterium. This was accompa-
nied by higher levels of the genus Collinsella. A pairwise correlation was detected between
lower ADHD-RS-IV scores and decreased Actinobacteria abundance, as well as between
lower concentrations of Actinobacteria and higher scores in the CGAS (in which higher
results indicate better functioning). The results highlight a potential effect of micronutrient
supplementation to modulate the abundance of putative probiotic bacterial species. Nev-
ertheless, the role of Biﬁdobacterium in ADHD is contradictory. Several studies reported a
protective effect of Biﬁdobacterium longus on several neuropsychiatric disorders, including
ADHD [136,152]. On the contrary, Aarts et al. [133] found an association between higher
abundances of Biﬁdobacterium species and ADHD. These opposing results may account
for differences between studies in sample sizes, dietary patterns, diagnostic heterogeneity
of neuropsychiatric disorders and the interpretation of compositional datasets in general.
The strengths of this study lie in the quality of its methodology: detailed description of the
recruitment procedure and of clinical and analytical assessments performed to participants;
stratiﬁcation for confounding factors, such as dietary patterns and nutritional deﬁciencies.
However, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results, as this was a pilot
study with a small sample that only included male participants. Information on the intake
on medication was not reported by the authors either.

In a Taiwanese study, Wang et al. [153] compared fecal microbiota compositions and di-
etary patterns between 30 naïve-medication children with ADHD and a cohort of 30 healthy
controls. Dietary habits were explored with the use of a food frequency questionnaire
including 49 food items from eight food groups. Microbial proﬁles were identiﬁed through
16S rDNA sequencing. Alpha diversity was assessed based on the Shannon, Chao1 and
Simpson indices. Children with ADHD showed signiﬁcantly higher values of Shannon and
Chao 1 indices, although the Simpson index was signiﬁcantly lower compared to controls.
No differences in beta diversity were observed between the both groups. At the genus level,
the microbial proﬁle was fairly similar between patients and controls. Performing a linear
discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), the relative abundance of Bacteroides coprocola was
signiﬁcantly lower in the ADHD group, whereas Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus and
Sutterella stercoricannis were signiﬁcantly increased. The genus Fusobacterium was relatively
enriched in ADHD patients, while the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was higher in
control subjects. Additionally, dietary patterns differed between the two cohorts of par-
ticipants. Participants with ADHD showed a higher intake of reﬁned grains and a lower
proportion of vitamin B2 and dairy. The amount of S. stercoricannis was correlated with the
intake of dairy, nuts/seeds/legumes, ferritin and magnesium. B. uniformis was associated
with fat and carbohydrate intake, whereas no correlations were observed between B. ovatus

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

11 of 32

and B. coprocola with any of the items included in the food frequency questionnaire. A
positive correlation was found between ADHD symptoms and both S. stercoricannis and
B. ovatus. The sample selection process was carefully described by the authors, who also
considered some confounding factors, such as the use of probiotics, antibiotics, special
dietary patterns and the presence of neuropsychiatric comorbidities. However, the main
limitations of this study were found in relation to the representativeness and comparability
of samples: ADHD patients with no neuropsychiatric comorbidities who scored lower than
typical ADHD patients in the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Version IV Scale (SNAP-IV);
and cases and controls who signiﬁcantly differed in their dietary habits. These differences
in the dietary pattern could have been the only reason for distinct microbial proﬁles.

Cheng et al. [154] applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to explore potential
relationships between the gut microbiome and ﬁve different neuropsychiatric disorders:
ADHD, ASD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. GSEA is
capable of identifying groups of genes that share common biological functions or target at
common diseases. Data were collected from publicly available genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) from the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium. The ADHD genomic dataset
comprised 19,099 patients with ADHD and 34,149 controls. The GSEA algorithm deter-
mined which ADHD-related genes or single nucleotide polymorphisms were enriched in
published datasets from GWAS of the human gut microbiome. The genus Desulfovibrio and
the order Clostridiales were signiﬁcantly associated with ADHD. However, Desulfovibrio
was also associated with ASD, which suggested that the abundance of this genus was not
speciﬁc of ADHD. The novelty of this study consists in screening candidate gut microbiome
for subsequent functional studies investigating the role of the gut microbiota in the patho-
physiology of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. The authors also used DNA level GWAS
data, so that the results were less likely to be affected by environmental and dietetic factors.
However, an important limitation of this study was that the gut microbiome-related gene
sets were collected from previously published GWAS of gut microbiome, which are still
quite scarce. Therefore, only a limited number of datasets was available for analysis.

The main ﬁndings and particular aspects of the aforementioned studies are summa-

rized in Table 1.

The previous evidence argues for a different microbial composition in patients with
ADHD. However, the results are too heterogeneous to draw conﬁdent conclusions regard-
ing whether a speciﬁc microbial proﬁle is associated with ADHD. Several factors may
have contributed to the differences found between studies: diverse geographic, cultural,
demographic and dietary characteristics of study populations; differences in relation to the
selection of control groups (siblings or non-related controls) or the intake of ADHD medi-
cation; methodological differences associated with the sampling and storing, microbiome
sequencing and the choice of bioinformatics pipeline and reference databases [155,156].

Notwithstanding heterogeneity, we attempted to group studies according to the

differential microbial features in patients with ADHD:
•

•

•

The results obtained by Stevens et al. [151] agreed with those previously found by
Aarts et al. [133]. According to Stevens et al., supplementation with micronutrients
reduced the abundance of the genus Biﬁdobacterium, which belongs to the phylum
Actinobacterium. The improvement of ADHD symptoms after supplementation could
have been inﬂuenced by these microbial changes, as a correlation was found between
a reduction in ADHD-RS-IV scores and a decreased abundance of Actinobacteria.
Previously, Aarts et al. had showed a signiﬁcant increase of the genus Biﬁdobacterium
in young patients with ADHD, establishing a correlation between this genus and a
particular DA-related enzyme (CDT) associated with altered neural reward responses.
In both studies, no differences in alpha/beta diversities were found between patients
and controls.
Prehn-Kristensen et al. [141] revealed a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of the fam-
ily Bacteroidaceae in adolescents with ADHD. This was corroborated later by Wang
et al. [153], who found an increase of some species of Bacteroides in the ADHD group.
However, the results obtained in relation to alpha and beta diversity were discordant:
alpha diversity was reduced and signiﬁcant differences in beta diversity were found
in the ADHD group in the study carried out by Prehn-Kristensen et al. By contrast, no
signiﬁcant differences in beta diversity between groups were found by Wang et al.,
who also highlighted higher values of Shannon and Chao1 indices in the ADHD
group. This could account for methodological differences between studies: sample
size, gender, intake of ADHD medication, ethnicity, and dietary habits.
Cheng et al. [154] showed signiﬁcant associations between the order Clostridiales and
ADHD. Interestingly, other three studies are in line with this ﬁnding: a signiﬁcant
increase of the genus Ruminococcaceae_UGC_004 (family Ruminococcaceae, order
Clostridiales) in the ADHD group was shown by the study conducted by Szopinska-
Tokov et al. [140]. Jiang et al. [137] and Wan et al. [143] found a signiﬁcant decrease of
the genus Faecalibacterium in patients with ADHD, which belongs to the same family.
In any case, these results are not mutually exclusive, as the increase in a genus can be
accompanied by a lower abundance of a different genus from the same family. For
instance, in the study performed by Stevens et al. [151], the decrease of the genus
Biﬁdobacterium occurred along with an increase of the genus Collinsella, from the same
family study. Differences in alpha and beta diversity between studies could again be
attributed to demographic and clinical differences between participants (medication
status, dietary habits), and divergences in sampling and storing.

According to the previous studies, it seems clear that the gut microbiome could play
a role in the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to ADHD symptoms. As explained
before, the gut microbiome may interfere in the catecholaminergic neurotransmission
system by either inﬂuencing their metabolic pathways or the expression of the genes
encoding these neurotransmitter transporters [147]. Furthermore, the gut microbiome
may contribute to exacerbate the mechanisms of neuroinﬂammation and oxidative stress
that are present in ADHD. This is not only due to their impact on the microglia and
the BBB permeability, but also to the production of SCFAs. As mitochondrial fuels, they
may contribute to the uncontrolled production of ROS/RONS, particularly when the
mitochondrial function is already altered [157] and the synthesis of SCFAs is increased
due to alterations in the microbial composition. In fact, some bacterial species are more
active in the production of SCFAs, such as Bacteroides spp. and Clostridiae spp. [158]. SCFAs
could even have additional effects on neurogenesis, as they could inﬂuence the levels
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [45]. Changes in the serum concentrations
of BDNF have been described in patients with ADHD [159], which were regulated after
MPH treatment [160]. An additional pathway that could underpin the role of the gut
microbiome in ADHD pathophysiology is its interaction with the metabolism of omega-3
PUFAs, although this will be described in the next section.

3.3. Gut Microbiome and Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in ADHD

Omega-3 PUFAs, and particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA), play an important role in membrane ﬂuidity, neurotransmission and receptor
function [163,164]. They affect the levels of BDNF and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF), a neuroprotective and important trophic factor in dopaminergic neurons [165].
Lower brain DHA content during development is associated with frontocortical dopamin-
ergic hypofunction [166]. In animal male models of ADHD, a diet enriched in omega-3
PUFAs was followed by an increased striatal turnover of DA, 5-HT, improved attention
and decreased impulsivity [167]. Omega-3 PUFAs also have essential anti-inﬂammatory

Gut Microbiome and Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in ADHD Omega-3 PUFAs, and particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentae-noic acid (EPA), play an important role in membrane fluidity, neurotransmission and receptor function [163,164].

Omega-3 PUFAs also have essential anti-inflammatory properties, as they reduce the levels of the pro-inflammatory inter-leukin IL-1β by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [168]. Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

properties, as they reduce the levels of the pro-inﬂammatory interleukin IL-1β by inhibiting
the activation of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome [168].

Total omega-3 PUFAs are signiﬁcantly decreased in pediatric patients with ADHD,
who showed a signiﬁcant higher omega-6:omega-3 fatty acids ratio in comparison with
controls [169]. Omega-3 PUFAs are a focus of increasing interest in children with ADHD
nowadays, as they might represent an alternative or adjuvant therapy to psychostimulants
in ADHD. Although studies on supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs in children and
adolescents with ADHD have shown mixed results, DHA/EPA might contribute to an
improvement in total symptom score, inattention and hyperactivity [170,171].

There is growing evidence to support a bidirectional relationship between omega-
3 PUFAs and the gut microbiome. In mice, an 8-week dietary supplementation with
different strains of Biﬁdobacterium breve (NCIMB 702258 and DPC 6330) yielded different
fatty acid proﬁles in the host tissues. Mice fed with B. breve NCIMB 702258 showed
signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA) and DHA in the brain in
comparison with those fed with B. breve DPC 6330 and the non-supplemented control group.
Nevertheless, both groups of B. breve-supplemented mice presented signiﬁcantly lower
brain concentrations of the omega-6 dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (20:3 n-6). The results were
not due to differences in dietary patterns others than the supplementation received. They
were also accompanied by changes in the gut microbial composition: at the family level,
there was a higher abundance of Clostridiaceae and lower concentrations of Eubacterium in
the supplemented groups, particularly in those receiving B. breve DPC 6330 [172].

On the other hand, omega-3 PUFAs also seem to inﬂuence the gut microbial composi-
tion. A group of pregnant female mice and their male offspring were fed with a control
diet, omega-3 (DHA + EPA) enriched diet or omega-3 deﬁcient diet. All three diets only
differed in the fatty acid content. Cognitive performance and social behavior were assessed
in male offspring at adolescence and adulthood, in parallel with the microbial proﬁle,
analyzed through 16S rDNA sequencing. Animals receiving the omega-3 deﬁcient diet
showed impaired communication, social and depression-related behaviors, whereas the
mice fed with omega-3 enriched diet displayed improved cognition. On a microbial level, a
signiﬁcant increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio was observed in the mice following
a diet deﬁcient in omega-3 fatty acids. At the genus level, mice following a diet abundant in
omega-3 showed a signiﬁcant increase in Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium during adulthood
in comparison with the other two groups [173]. In a recent study, male rats were random-
ized to receive a control diet in non-stressing conditions (NSCD), a control diet in social
instability stress conditions (SCD), and an omega-3 (DHA + EPA) and vitamin A enriched
diet during stressful manipulation (SED). The aim of this study was to explore if omega-3
PUFAs + vitamin A could prevent the behavioral deﬁcits and microbial changes induced
by stressing circumstances during adolescence. Cognitive performance in the SED group
was indistinguishable from that of the NSCD group. BDNF expression in the hippocampus
was decreased in SCD rats in comparison with NSCD, and this change was prevented by
the enriched diet. The enriched diet signiﬁcantly increased alpha diversity and prevented
the changes in the microbial composition induced by stress. A signiﬁcant increase in the
production of unbranched SCFAs was also observed in the SED group [174]. These results
should be interpreted cautiously, considering that they were performed in small animal
populations during strict laboratory conditions. Furthermore, no associations between
animal behavioral features and changes in the microbial composition were performed by
the authors.

Similarly, in a randomized, open-label, cross-over trial of 8-week supplementation
with omega-3 PUFAs (DHA/EPA) to 22 healthy volunteers, Watson et al. [175] reported
an increase in the butyrate-producing genera Biﬁdobacterium, Roseburia and Lactobacillus
in fecal samples. No signiﬁcant changes in alpha or beta diversity were found after sup-
plementation. However, the authors found no correlation between the microbial changes
and the concentrations of EPA/DHA measured in red blood cells after supplementation.
The recruitment process was carefully described by the authors, who also stratiﬁed for

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

confounding factors such as the current use of omega-3 PUFA supplements, concomitant
use of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory medication, previous surgery for bowel resection,
current treatment for any chronic inﬂammatory condition or malignancy, pregnancy or
smoking. As limitations, this study included a small sample size and no information on
dietary habits was recorded.

A representation of the interaction between the gut microbiome and omega-3 PUFAs,
and how this relationship could interfere with ADHD pathophysiological mechanisms, is
shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.
Interaction between the gut microbiome and omega-3 PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids), and effect on
ADHD symptoms. The imbalance in the omega-3:omega-6 PUFA ratio leads to a state of neuroinﬂammation and a
consequent disruption in the dopaminergic system (black arrows). Dopaminergic dysfunction is one of the main fac-
tors contributting to ADHD core symptoms. Alterations in the microbial composition have also been associated with
ADHD symptoms, apparently via the inﬂuence of the gut microbiome on neurotransmission (microbiome–gut–brain axis
(MGBA)). The administration of probiotics (green arrow) may boost the concentrations of omega-3 PUFAs. This would
correct the omega-3:omega-6 imbalance and ultimately improve ADHD symptoms by stabilizing neuronal membranes,
dopaminergic neurotransmission and reducing neuroinﬂammation. On the other hand, supplementation with eicosapen-
taenoic/docosahexanoic acids (EPA/DHA) (yellow arrow) could induce changes in the microbial composition that would
be beneﬁcial for ADHD symptoms, via dopaminergic neurotransmission regulation (MGBA).

3.4. Gut Microbiome and ADHD Comorbidities: Chronodisruption and Sleep Disorders

Sleep disorders represent one of the most frequent comorbidities in children with
ADHD. They can be present in up to 70% of patients [176], affecting their cognitive, be-
havioral and physical state [177], and thus increasing parental stress levels [178]. Patients
with ADHD suffer from variable sleep disruptions, but the most consistent ﬁnding is
probably the presence of a delayed circadian phase (evening preference), with a conse-
quent disturbance in daytime functioning [179,180]. The exact neurobiological mechanisms
underlying the sleep disorders in ADHD are yet to be fully determined, but they have
been associated with a circadian dysfunction in which the evening increase in endogenous
melatonin secretion (dim light melatonin onset) is signiﬁcantly delayed [181,182]. Pineal

Gut Microbiome and ADHD Comorbidities: Chronodisruption and Sleep Disorders Sleep disorders represent one of the most frequent comorbidities in children with ADHD. They can be present in up to 70% of patients [176], affecting their cognitive, be-havioral and physical state [177], and thus increasing parental stress levels [178]. Patients with ADHD suffer from variable sleep disruptions, but the most consistent finding is probably the presence of a delayed circadian phase (evening preference), with a conse-quent disturbance in daytime functioning [179,180]. The exact neurobiological mecha-nisms underlying the sleep disorders in ADHD are yet to be fully determined, but they have been associated with a circadian dysfunction in which the evening increase in en-dogenous melatonin secretion (dim light melatonin onset) is significantly delayed [181,182]. Pineal melatonin synthesis is controlled by the central circadian clock in the CNS, which generates circadian rhythms through the transcriptional/translational feed-back loops existent between the different clock genes (Bmal:Clock, Per:Cry, Rorα, Rev-erbα, Chrono) [129]. Indeed, several polymorphisms of the CLOCK gene might be associated with susceptibility to ADHD [183,184].  Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

melatonin synthesis is controlled by the central circadian clock in the CNS, which generates
circadian rhythms through the transcriptional/translational feedback loops existent be-
tween the different clock genes (Bmal:Clock, Per:Cry, Rorα, Rev-erbα, Chrono) [129]. Indeed,
several polymorphisms of the CLOCK gene might be associated with susceptibility to
ADHD [183,184].

The diversity and composition of the gut microbiome oscillate during the 24 h light-
dark cycle, suggesting that the gut, as the rest of the tissues, has its own peripheral
circadian clocks, which ultimately depend on the central clock. In animal studies, the
diversity and abundance of certain species, such as Bacteroidetes and Clostridia, swayed
during the light-dark period [185]. The number of bacteria was higher during the active
phase of mice, with a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, whereas bacterial load was reduced
during the rest phase, with a predominance of the phylum Firmicutes [186,187]. Knockout
of clock genes, including Per1/2, attenuated these oscillations [185,188]. Additionally,
melatonin seems to impact on the richness and diversity of the intestinal microbiota and
the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio in mice [189]. Recently, Gao et al. [190] evaluated the
changes induced by melatonin treatment in the microbial composition and the colonic
mucosal integrity of sleep-deprived mice, in which plasma melatonin concentrations were
lower than in controls. Sleep deprivation was associated with a signiﬁcant decrease in
microbial diversity and richness, and a signiﬁcant increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes
ratio, in comparison with control mice. At the genus level, a signiﬁcant decrease of
Akkermansia, Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium, together with an increase of Aeromonas, was
found in mice with sleep deprivation. Goblet cells and the expression of TJ proteins were
also signiﬁcantly reduced by sleep deprivation. By contrast, melatonin administration
restored the richness and diversity indices, as well as the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio,
to values similar to the control group. After treatment with melatonin, a signiﬁcant
decrease of Aeromonas was observed, along with a rise in the content of Akkermansia,
Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium. Furthermore, melatonin signiﬁcantly increased the number
of goblet cells and the expression of TJ proteins. These changes were in parallel with
a neutralization of the disrupting effects provoked by sleep deprivation in the balance
between pro-inﬂammatory/anti-inﬂammatory cytokines and the redox status.

In a Chinese population of 120 children with ASD, Hua et al. [191] explored the
differences in the composition of the gut microbiome and its metabolites between those
patients who suffered from sleep disorders (n = 60) and those without sleep problems
(n = 60). Sleep disorders were assessed through the Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire
(CSHQ). Microbial DNA was extracted from stool samples and analyzed through next-
generation sequencing of 16S rDNA. No information on medication or dietary patterns
was included. Abundance and richness of the gut microbiota were signiﬁcantly higher
in ASD children with sleep problems. No signiﬁcant differences were observed in the
Firmicutes:Bacteroides ratio, but at the genus level, a signiﬁcant reduction in the butyrate-
producing bacteria Faecalibacterium and Agathobacter was found in the sleep disorder group.
The abundance of each of the two genera was negatively correlated with CSHQ scores.
Three differential metabolites were observed between sleep disorder and no sleep disorder
groups: concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyric acid (a butyrate-derived acid) and melatonin
were signiﬁcantly lower among patients with ASD and sleep problems, whereas levels
of 5-HT were signiﬁcantly higher. The concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyric acid were cor-
related with melatonin levels and Faecalibacterium abundance. Additionally, a positive
correlation was also found between melatonin concentrations and the abundances of Faecal-
ibacterium and Agathobacter. Due to the design of the study, it was not possible to elucidate
if the differences observed in the gut microbiome were due to a circadian dysregulation in
patients with ASD, or if a previous alteration in the microbial composition contributed to
the changes observed in melatonin concentrations. Another limitation was the absence of
a control group to be compared with the populations with ASD, apart from the absence
of information on dietary patterns and medication intake. Notwithstanding, this study
provided compelling evidence for an association between microbial metabolites (butyrate)

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

and melatonin. Studies on the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and
the sleep/wake circadian rhythm in ADHD are lacking. However, given the evidence
provided and the genetic overlap between ASD and ADHD [192], it seems plausible to
suggest the existence of similar alterations in children with ADHD and sleep disorders.

3.5. Therapeutic Role of the Gut Microbiome in ADHD: Probiotics

Given the documented involvement of the MGBA in the pathophysiological mech-
anisms of ADHD, it may be reasonable to consider the gut microbiome as a potential
therapeutic target for this disorder. In this regard, probiotics are living non-pathological
microorganisms that provide a health beneﬁt by improving physiological conditions in
the host when they are administered in adequate amounts, well as a food ingredient,
supplement or as a drug [193]. To date, species of the genus Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium
represent the most investigated strains [194].

A recent systematic review included randomized controlled trials, published between
1990 and 2018, that had evaluated the effects of probiotic supplementation on the cognitive
function in children and adolescents. Seven studies were found to meet the inclusion
criteria, but only one of them reported a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk to develop ADHD
or ASD [195]. This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted
by Pärtty et al. [152] on a Finnish population of 159 infants who had at least one family
member with allergic disease. Their mothers had been randomized to receive a daily
supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (1 × 1010 colony-forming units (CFU))
or placebo, starting 4 weeks before expected delivery. The intervention was continued for
6 months after delivery, given either to the children or to the mother, if they were breastfed.
Behavioral patterns and fecal microbiome composition of the children were periodically
analyzed until 13 years of age. The diagnosis of ADHD or ASD was established by an
experienced child psychiatrist or neurologist in accordance with the International Classiﬁ-
cation of Diseases 10th Edition (ICD-10). Techniques of ﬂuorescein in situ hybridization
(FISH) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to analyze the gut
microbiome. Seventy-ﬁve subjects completed the study, 40 in the intervention group, and
35 participants in the placebo group. Signiﬁcant differences were found in the percentage
of patients who were diagnosed with ADHD or ASD at the age of 13: 17.1% children
in the placebo group vs. none in the probiotic group. At the genus level, the content
of Biﬁdobacterium at 6 months of life was signiﬁcantly lower among children who later
developed neuropsychiatric disorders, although this difference was not present at 13 years
of age. All children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders were male, but the
differences found were not inﬂuenced by gender when controlling for this factor in a
logistic regression analysis. Perinatal factors, such as delivery mode, birth/length weight
and infant feeding mode were comparable between placebo and intervention groups. The
recruitment process was detailed by the authors, who also used accurate techniques of FISH
and qPCR. However, some limitations should be taken into account when interpreting
these results: a considerable percentage of drop-outs (around 50%) may have biased the
results; no information on maternal dietary habits during pregnancy and after delivery
(in the case of breastfed infants) was recorded; additional information on risk factors for
ADHD, such as maternal smoking, nutritional deﬁciencies or psychosocial factors was
not reported either; ﬁnally, no association were established between the abundance of
Biﬁdobacterium at 6 months of life and ADHD psychometric scores.

By contrast, less consistent results were shown by a more recent double-blind pilot
randomized placebo-controlled trial on children and adolescents with ADHD who received
a 3-month supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 (once-daily dose
of 1 × 1010 CFU). Thirty-two naïve-medication patients with ADHD (4–17 years old) were
randomized to take the probiotic (n = 18) or placebo capsules (n = 14). The serum proﬁle
of pro/anti-inﬂammatory cytokines was assessed at baseline and after 3 months, as well
as the scores obtained in the following ratings: the ADHD Parent Report Rating Scale-IV,
which is based on the diagnostic criteria for ADHD as established by the Diagnostic and

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV); the Child Self-Report and
Parent Proxy-Report of the Pediatric Quality of Life InventoryTM (PedsQLTM) 4.0 Generic
Core Scale; the Parent Form (CBCL/6-18) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) of the Child
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment
(ASEBA). The most interesting ﬁnding was a signiﬁcant improvement in the scores obtained
in the PedsQLTM Child-Self Report after 3 months only in the probiotic group. This may
reﬂect that these patients felt an improvement in physical, emotional and social terms, as
well as in their school functioning. Mixed results were obtained in relation to the other
tests: the PedsQLTM Parent-Proxy Report showed signiﬁcantly better scores only in the
placebo group, whereas a signiﬁcant improvement was reﬂected by the scores obtained
in the ADHD Rating Scale and the CBCL Parent Form in both groups of participants.
The differences observed in the serum levels of cytokines were also ambiguous: the
proinﬂammatory IL-12 p70 and TNF-α signiﬁcantly decreased in the probiotic group only,
whereas signiﬁcantly lower concentrations of the proinﬂammatory IL-6 was found in both
groups; a signiﬁcant reduction of the anti-inﬂammatory IL-10 was also observed, and only
in the probiotic group. The authors attributed these controversial results to both the small
sample size and the short observation period [196]. This pilot study had several limitations:
the age range of patients in both groups was too wide (4 to 17 years old), which questioned
their comparability in relation to the psychometric scores and the cytokine proﬁle; no
information in relation to dietary habits was included. Additionally, possible changes in
the microbial proﬁle were not measured either. Establishing associations between shifts in
the microbial composition and changes in serum cytokine levels and psychometric scores
would have provided more consistency to this study.

In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, Skott et al. [197] aimed at inves-
tigating the effects of a synbiotic on ADHD core symptoms, autistic comorbid symptoms
and daily functioning in a population of children and adults with ADHD. A synbiotic is
a product that combines prebiotics and probiotics and in which the prebiotic component
favors the probiotic strains [198]. A prebiotic is a substrate that is selectively utilized by
host microorganisms and confers a health beneﬁt [199]. The synbiotic used in this study
was Synbiotic 2000, a lyophilized composition of 4 × 1011 CFU per dose of three lactic acid
bacteria (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus casei spp. paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum)
and the fermentable ﬁbers betaglucan, inulin, pectin and resistant starch. The pediatric
sample was composed of 68 children and adolescents with ADHD (10–14 years) who were
allocated to take Synbiotic 2000 (n = 34) or placebo capsules (n = 34) for a period of 9 weeks.
The following questionnaires were completed before and after intervention: the Swanson,
Nolan and Pelham-IV scale (SNAP-IV) parent rating scale to measure ADHD symptoms;
the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-parent-reported for child (WFIRS-PC) to
assess functional impairment; and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) to
evaluate autistic symptoms. Given that Synbiotic 2000 has documented anti-inﬂammatory
properties [200,201], the authors also decided to measure blood levels of C-reactive protein
(CRP) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) at baseline, as both of them are
involved in the inﬂammatory response. No signiﬁcant differences between groups (synbi-
otic vs. placebo) were observed for the changes found in the scores of ADHD symptoms
(SNAP-IV) and functional impairment (WFIRS-PC) after intervention. Only a tendency
for a reduction of autistic symptoms, according to the SCQ scores, was observed in the
synbiotic group. However, when stratifying for VCAM-1 levels and the intake of ADHD
medication, it was observed that the tendency of Synbiotic 2000 to reduce SCQ total score
was driven by the existence of elevated VCAM-1 concentrations and the absence of ADHD
medication. The novelty introduced by this clinical trial was to explore for the ﬁrst time
the effects of a synbiotic on symptoms and functioning in pediatric patients with ADHD.
However, several limitations are highlighted for this study: ﬁrst, a food frequency question-
naire was completed by participants only at baseline, thus it was unlikely to have included
possible dynamic changes in dietary patterns over the 9-week intervention period; second,
after stratifying for VCAM-1 levels and medication, the sample sizes were substantially

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

22 of 32

diminished; third, CRP and VCAM-1 levels were only measured at baseline, so it was not
possible to observe effects of the synbiotic on proinﬂammatory markers; fourth, patients
were also taking melatonin, omega-3 PUFAs and other types of probiotics at baseline,
which were not considered as confounding factors for the statistical analysis; ﬁfth, no
information on the intake of ADHD medication was reported.

An observational study on 2467 very low birth-weight (VLBW) infants who were
followed until the age of 5–6 years, showed no association between probiotic treatment
and neurocognitive outcome of the study population. However, breastfeeding for a min-
imum of 3 months was associated with lower scores of conduct disorder and inatten-
tion/hyperactivity. The probiotic formulation consisted of a standardized combination of
Biﬁdobacterium infantis (1–1.5 × 109 CFU) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (1–3 × 109 CFU), ad-
ministered once-daily from days 1–3 of life until days 14–35 of life. Neurocognitive outcome
was assessed by considering the scores in the parent-reported Strength and Difﬁculties
Questionnaire (SDQ), and the intelligence quotient obtained in the Wechsler Preschool
and Primary Scale of Intelligence 3rd Edition (WPPSI-III) test. This represents the ﬁrst
large-scale study on neurocognitive outcome after probiotic administration during the
neonatal period. The sample was carefully selected, stratifying for potential confounding
factors, such as gestational age, motor impairment, maternal age, maternal educational
level, multiple birth and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, the study exhibited
several limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the results: ﬁrst, the
design was observational, so it was not possible to draw causal conclusions based on data;
second, breastfeeding was considered as either exclusive breastfeeding or mixed breast-
feeding combining breast milk and infant formula; third, information on the duration of
breastfeeding was collected by a parent-reported questionnaire at the age of 5 years, which
may have introduced a recall bias; ﬁnally, a combination of biological and psychological
factors that could have inﬂuenced neurodevelopment in the time lapse between perinatal
period and 5–6 years of age were not included in the study [202].

In general, the aforementioned studies provide some evidence to suggest a thera-
peutic role of the gut microbiome in pediatric patients with ADHD. However, notable
inconsistencies were found among the three supplementation clinical trials on children
with ADHD. The most robust results were provided by Pärtty et al. [152], who reported a
signiﬁcant reduction in the proportion of participants who developed ADHD symptoms
in the probiotic group. Interestingly, the abundance of Biﬁdobacterium at 6 months of age
was signiﬁcantly lower among those who developed neuropsychiatric disorders. This
would contrast with the results obtained by Aarts et al. [133] and Stevens et al. [151], as
previously mentioned in Section 3.2. Nonetheless, the relative abundance of Biﬁdobacterium
referred by Pärtty et al. at 6 months was not present at 13 years of age, when the diagnosis
was made. The study of Pärtty et al. was only slightly corroborated by the randomized
placebo-controlled trial conducted by Kumperscak et al. [196]. They showed a signiﬁ-
cant improvement in the PedsQLTM Child-Self Report scores after supplementation. This
study was conducted on a clinical population of children and adolescents with ADHD
using exactly the same probiotic as Pärtty et al., but for a shorter period. However, the
results obtained in the serum cytokine proﬁle and in ADHD-RS-IV scores, a psychometric
scale speciﬁcally designed to detect ADHD core symptoms, were mixed. Similar mixed
results were also offered by the clinical trial carried out by Skott et al. [197] on a pediatric
population with ADHD. Only a tendency to signiﬁcance was found for the reduction in
autistic symptoms in the group randomized to the synbiotic, whereas the ADHD symptom
score (SNAP-IV) decreased to a similar degree in the supplemented and placebo groups.
No analysis of microbial composition was performed in the last two clinical trials, which
prevented from ﬁnding more consistent results across studies.

As suggested by Cerdó et al. [203], there are still considerable divergences between
studies in dosage, type of strain, intervention period, microbiome composition analy-
sis, methods for neurological assessment, identiﬁcation of potential confounding factors,
study design and sample size. For standardization purposes, future research is needed to

Nutrients 2021, 13, 249

23 of 32

identify the most effective doses and combination of probiotics, as well as the minimum
intervention period to observe clinically meaningful results in ADHD symptoms and
associated comorbidities.

4. Limitations

In the present review, we have aimed to provide the current evidence on: the role of
the gut microbiome in ADHD pathophysiology and possible association with symptoms;
implication of the gut microbiome in the omega-3/omega-6 PUFA imbalance found in
patients with ADHD; interaction between the gut microbiome and circadian rhythms; and
the therapeutic role of probiotics in pediatric patients with ADHD. Certainly, we have
carefully selected and described the most recent studies on the aforementioned research
lines. However, this is a narrative review, as such, our work is essentially informative
and has limited capacity to assess the robustness of the results provided by the current
literature in these topics. We have tried to improve this by: highlighting the limitations of
the different studies, making a judgement of their novelty, quality and reliability; grouping
studies according to their results, in order to show controversies and inconsistencies among
them; and including ﬁnal remarks with suggestions on the aspects that require to be
improved in future studies. On the other hand, we cannot discard a possible selection bias,
given by the absence of a detailed search strategy designed a priori. Therefore, a systematic
review, with a previous comprehensive plan to identify all relevant studies on the topic
and the use of statistical analysis to measure effect sizes, would have provided more
solid conclusions to our initial hypothesis. A systematic assessment of the quality of the
studies could also have been included, through the use of the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality
Assessment scale for Cohort and Case-Control Studies (NOS) [204] and the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT Statement) [205].

5. Concluding Remarks

The gut microbiome maintains a bidirectional relationship with its host through
neurological, hormonal and immune mechanisms, conﬁguring the microbiome–gut–brain
axis (MGBA). Alterations of the MGBA are responsible for the appearance of diverse
neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders in pediatric populations. In children and
adolescents with ADHD, the MGBA is involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of
neuroinﬂammation and oxidative stress that give rise not only to the ADHD core symptoms,
but also to associated comorbidities, such as sleep disorders. Furthermore, changes in the
gut microbiome may also constitute the basis for the efﬁcacy of new alternative therapies
currently under investigation, such as omega-3 PUFAs. Thus, the gut microbiome could
represent a potential therapeutic target in children and adolescents with ADHD.

Nevertheless, current studies still offer heterogeneous results due to substantial
methodological differences in relation to sample size, participant selection criteria, neu-
ropsychological assessment of participants, identiﬁcation of confounding factors, micro-
biome analysis techniques, dosage and combination of probiotics, and duration of the
intervention period. This could be improved by conducting studies that: include a formal
calculation of the required sample size and clearly deﬁned recruitment procedures, includ-
ing information on the intake of ADHD medication and dietary patterns; use standardized
psychometric scales to evaluate ADHD symptoms in accordance with the current diag-
nostic criteria (DSM-5); have designs that allow inferring causality; use high-resolution
techniques beyond 16S rDNA sequencing for taxonomy and functional analysis, such
as whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics.
Future research lines should be focused on the design of protocols to standardize the
supplementation with probiotics in pediatric populations: composition, dose and time
of supplementation.
