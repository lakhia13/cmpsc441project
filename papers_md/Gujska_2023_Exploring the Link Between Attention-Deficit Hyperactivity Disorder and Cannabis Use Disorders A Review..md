Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children and 
adults. In the substance use disorders (SUDs) population, ADHD prevalence reaches 23.1%, leading to more 
severe substance abuse progression and reduced treatment effectiveness. Cannabis is the most common illic-
it drug used among the ADHD population.
The increasing popularity of medical marijuana (MM) has raised concerns about its potential impact on neuro-
cognitive functions, particularly in adolescents. Persistent cannabis use can cause permanent changes in brain 
structures and circuits. This review aims to overview the comorbidity of ADHD and SUDs, focusing on canna-
bis use disorders.
Theoretical models of the etiologies of ADHD and SUDs were investigated to establish a framework for analyz-
ing their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. The reward and motivational brain circuitries involving the 
default-mode network and the endocannabinoid system were emphasized. The high prevalence of SUDs in the 
ADHD population has ramifications, including earlier age of onset, self-medication, and reduced performance 
in various domains. Cannabis use disorders are particularly significant due to the increasingly widespread use 
of cannabis and its perceived safety.
The review highlights the lack of theoretical background on the therapeutic properties of medicinal cannabis, 
criticizing its speculated applications in the ADHD population. This article reviews the current understanding 
of the association between ADHD and cannabis use, emphasizing the need for further research and a cautious 
approach to MM’s potential therapeutic applications.

Comorbidity of ADHD and cannabis use disorders

Background

ADHD is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 
children and adults, with prevalence rates of 5% in children 
and 2.5% in adults [1-3]. Neurodevelopmental disorders of-
ten result in cognitive, language learning, and behavioral dis-
turbances [4]. ADHD has been associated with reduced school 
performance,  poorer  occupational  performance,  and  an  in-
creased risk of comorbid disorders and substance use disor-
ders (SUDs) [1,5-7].

of sensation-seeking and impulsiveness, shared dopaminer-
gic dysregulation of reward and motivational systems, or the 
self-medication hypothesis [10].

Epidemiological research indicates a strong correlation between 
ADHD’s polygenic risk scores and CUDs, suggesting a common 
genetic risk [12]. Cannabis is the most commonly used psy-
choactive drug in the United States and Europe, with studies 
showing high prominence among teenagers and adolescents, 
who are especially prone to cognitive impairment [15-17].

SUDs are highly prevalent in individuals with psychiatric con-
ditions, and their co-occurrence is referred to as “dual disor-
ders” [8-10]. Substance use, particularly cannabis, is common 
among individuals with ADHD [11,12]. The prevalence rate of 
ADHD in the SUDs population reaches 23.1% [10]. Cannabis 
is the most frequent illicit drug of choice in the ADHD pop-
ulation [13].

Cannabis sativa (ie, cannabis) contains over 144 differing can-
nabinoids, of which CBD and D9-THC are the most frequent-
ly studied [9,18]. The effects of these 2 substances are dis-
tinct; D9-THC has psychotomimetic properties, while CBD has 
non-psychomimetic properties [9,18]. Numerous clinical stud-
ies have linked ADHD pathophysiology with the ECS, revealing 
impaired ECS signaling through the CB1R [19].

Cannabis  use  disorders  (CUDs)  can  alter  brain  circuitry  and 
cause disturbances in executive functioning [14-17]. The in-
fluence of cannabis on executive functioning has been stud-
ied extensively, with findings suggesting that strains with high 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-THC) impair executive func-
tioning, while those with high cannabidiol (CBD) do not [9].

Medical  marijuana  (MM)  has  gained  popularity  in  recent 
years  [15].  However,  discussions  about  its  potential  thera-
peutic application often lack systematization [18]. Moreover, 
increasing cannabis use may be rooted in inaccurate percep-
tions of the compound as safe and non-addictive [20,21]. Data 
show that MM laws can contribute to increased cannabis use 
and CUDs in adults, who perceive it as being less harmful than 
other drugs due to its growing legalization status and inter-
est [22]. Furthermore, individuals with comorbid psychiatric 
disorders also perceive marijuana as being less harmful [23].

Research shows that more than half of adults with ADHD meet 
the criteria for SUDs at some point in their lifetime [24]. This 
review aims to explore the link between ADHD and CUDs, fo-
cusing on these disorders’ characteristics, diagnostic features, 
and etiologies. The analysis delves into their common neuro-
cognitive  mechanisms  and  functional  consequences,  with  a 
particular interest in the endocannabinoid system (ECS) [19], 
default-mode network (DMN), and motivational and reward cir-
cuitry. Additionally, the review assesses the application of MM 
as an alternative therapeutic intervention for ADHD and CUDs.

Theoretical  models  on  ADHD  and  CUDs’  etiology  were  in-
vestigated  to  set  a  framework  for  further  analysis.  These 
models suggest shared fundamentals, such as genetic back-
ground, neurobiological substrates, and risk factors [10]. The 
comorbidity of ADHD and SUDs may result from high levels 

The topic of cannabis and its potential therapeutic form, med-
ical  marijuana  (MM),  has  been  gaining  popularity  in  recent 
years [15]. However, discussions about its potential therapeutic 
application often lack clarity and differentiation between vari-
ous forms, such as dry cannabis inflorescence, derivatives like 
oils or hashish, or synthetic constructs [18]. Moreover, these 
discussions have serious ramifications, as research indicates 
that increasing cannabis use may be rooted in inaccurate per-
ceptions of the compound as safe and non-addictive or as a 
self-medication strategy [20,21].

Data  show  that  MM  laws  implicate  may  contribute  to  in-
creased cannabis use and CUDs in adults, who perceive the 
substance to be less harmful due to its growing legalization 
status and interest [22]. Moreover, individuals with comorbid 
psychiatric disorders also perceive the substance as less harm-
ful [23]. Addressing misconceptions about cannabis as a safe 
drug, high-potency cannabis varieties and new synthetic ul-
tra-potent cannabinoids can lead to severe intoxication, dis-
rupt neurodevelopmental processes, induce psychotic behav-
ior, and contribute to the rapid onset of CUDs [17].

The literature emphasizes the need for more methodological-
ly rigorous clinical studies that distinguish between the ratio 
of D9-THC and CBD in cannabis [18,19]. A narrative review of 
selected studies was conducted to explore the association be-
tween ADHD and cannabis use.

This review synthesizes findings from previous studies, focus-
ing on the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms and their 
functional consequences. The main topics of interest regard-
ing  neurological  mechanisms  involve  the  ECS,  with  further 
focus on the default-mode network (DMN), and motivation-
al and reward circuitry. By understanding the comorbidity of

ADHD and CUDs, researchers and clinicians can better devel-
op effective interventions and treatments.

Characteristics	and	Diagnostic	Features

ADHD

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by in-
attention and disorganization, and is often accompanied by 
hyperactivity or impulsivity. These difficulties affect individu-
als’ personal, educational, and work-related activities [1]. The 
disorder usually becomes apparent during early developmen-
tal stages, leading to mild motor, language, and social devel-
opment  delays.  Individuals  with  ADHD  often  exhibit  poorer 
performance in cognitive processes, such as attention, mem-
ory, and executive functioning [5].

Individuals with ADHD frequently display low frustration tol-
erance, irritability, and mood lability [25]. Moreover, they pre-
fer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones. This 
aversion to delayed gratification is related to impulsivity and 
atypical activity in the brain’s limbic regions, which are vital 
for emotional processing [26]. These reward-system nuances 
are associated with emotional processing and contribute to 
emotion regulation challenges in individuals with ADHD [27].

ADHD diagnostic criteria require a persistent pattern of symp-
toms (lasting at least 6 months, appearing before the age of 
12,  and  interfering  with  daily  life  activities)  that  are  incon-
sistent with typical development. Symptoms usually include 
lack of attention, difficulty concentrating, disorganization, dif-
ficulty completing tasks, forgetfulness, and losing items [28].

Due to ADHD’s neurodevelopmental nature, inattention and hy-
peractivity/impulsivity symptoms must manifest during child-
hood, before the age of 12 years [1]. The DSM-V and ICD-11 
distinguish 3 subtypes of ADHD: 1) combined, 2) predominant-
ly inattentive, and 3) predominantly hyperactive or impulsive. 
Each subtype corresponds to a mild, moderate, or severe se-
verity level. A complete ADHD diagnosis specifies the disor-
der’s clinical presentation and severity [1].

Diagnosing ADHD can be challenging due to gender differenc-
es, symptom manifestations, cultural implications, and con-
founding symptomatology with other conditions. The DSM-V 
states that ADHD prevalence is more common in males than 
females, with a ratio of about 2: 1 in children and 1.6: 1 in 
adults. Females with ADHD predominantly present inattention 
features [1]. However, research on gender differences suggests 
that the varied prevalence rate across sexes may result from 
differential presentations influenced by biological factors and 
societal gender roles [29].

ADHD symptomatology often lacks continuity, as symptoms 
may manifest in altered forms during development. For exam-
ple, childhood hyperactivity may involve excessive motor ac-
tivity,  while  adulthood  manifestations  may  include  extreme 
restlessness or talkativeness [1]. Symptom manifestations also 
vary across different settings and contexts, including cultural 
backgrounds, with societal, gender, and cultural roles poten-
tially accounting for these differences [30].

Cannabis Use Disorders

Cannabis use disorders (CUDs) involve a pattern of cannabis 
use that results in distress or clinically significant impairment, 
representing a primary public health concern [31]. CUDs impair 
higher executive functions in a dose- and frequency-dependent 
manner, leading to decreased prosocial goal-directed behavior 
(amotivational syndrome), hindered social relationships, and 
increased risk of harm due to risky behavior.

Cannabis takes various forms, including synthetic, and can be 
ingested differently, influencing the perceived “high.” While 
often used alone, CUDs frequently co-occur with other sub-
stance use disorders (SUDs) involving cocaine, alcohol, or opi-
oids. Regular cannabis use shares markers applicable to oth-
er SUDs [1].

Like other SUDs, CUDs are characterized by withdrawal symp-
toms that persist during detoxification. Common withdrawal 
symptoms include anxiety, depressed mood, anger, irritabili-
ty, sleep disturbances, and restlessness. Persistent withdraw-
al symptoms often cause distress, increasing the likelihood of 
relapse and making quitting difficult. This is particularly sig-
nificant considering that, like other SUDs, cannabis is often 
used as a coping mechanism for psychological or physiological 
difficulties [1,22]. CUDs are highly prevalent among individu-
als with comorbid mental conditions, potentially due to self-
medication, exacerbating their clinical presentation [10,23].

CUDs prevalence rates vary across age groups, with increasing 
prominence in adolescents and adults. Moderate differences 
exist among races and ethnic backgrounds, while gender dif-
ferences in CUDs mirror those typically observed in other SUDs. 
Generally, CUDs are more common in males than females, al-
though the gender disparity is smaller in adolescents [1].

A CUD diagnosis requires an individual to experience at least 
2 of the following within 12 months: (1) substance use last-
ing  longer  than  intended,  (2)  unsuccessful  attempts  to  re-
duce or discontinue substance use, (3) significant time spent 
obtaining, using, or recovering from substance use, (4) sub-
stance craving, (5) impairments in personal and social func-
tioning, (6) substance use despite persistent or recurrent so-
cial and interpersonal problems, (7) reduced or discontinued

social, occupational, or recreational activities, (8) continuous 
substance use in physically hazardous situations, (9) ongoing 
substance use despite knowledge of its likely psychological and 
physical consequences, (10) tolerance, and (11) withdrawal. 
These criteria encompass diagnostic features of SUDs, includ-
ing impaired control over substance use, social impairment, 
risky use of the substance, and pharmacological concepts [1].

Etiology:	Theoretical	Models

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

ADHD etiology has been extensively researched over the years. 
In 1996, Pennington and Ozonoff published a pioneering work 
linking ADHD symptoms with the symptomatology observed 
in patients with prefrontal cortex lesions. They proposed that 
the inattention and impulsivity displayed by individuals with 
ADHD arise from deficits in executive functioning, laying the 
groundwork for future research [32].

Barkley further investigated the concept, suggesting that cen-
tral executive deficits in ADHD occur in relation to response 
inhibition (ie, behavioral inhibition) comprising 3 interrelated 
processes: (1) inhibiting an automatic or prepotent response 
likely to result in immediate reinforcement, (2) allowing for the 
delay or pause of an initiated response, and (3) focusing on in-
terference control, which is the ability to maintain focus while 
rejecting competing stimuli. Barkley argued that impaired re-
sponse inhibition disrupts 4 executive processes: working mem-
ory, self-regulation, internalization of speech, and reconstitu-
tion. These disturbances lead to a reduced ability to execute 
complex actions and perform goal-directed behaviors, partic-
ularly in motor control, fluency, and syntax [33].

Other models explored ADHD’s differential presentation, fo-
cusing on its 3 subtypes (combined, predominantly inatten-
tive,  and  predominantly  hyperactive  or  impulsive).  In  2005, 
Diamond  proposed  that  the  inattentive  presentation  stems 
from impaired working memory, while the combined presenta-
tion arises from hindered behavioral inhibition [34]. Castellanos 
et al (2006) associated 2 ADHD subtypes (inattentive and hy-
peractive) with executive function pathways. They postulat-
ed that the inattentive subtype results from disruptions in the 
“cool” executive function pathway (regulating tasks without 
affective involvement), leading to cognitive processing diffi-
culties. In contrast, they suggested that the hyperactive sub-
type is linked to dysfunction in the “hot” executive function 
pathway  (modulating  affective  tasks  involving  rewards  and 
motivation), resulting in problems with emotional stimuli [35].

Some models considered ADHD and its subtypes as products 
of  the  same  impairments,  proposing  that  the  deficits  stem 

from disturbances in cognitive control and affect regulation. 
One model emphasized impaired executive functioning abili-
ties and the role of delayed gratification and arousal in ADHD 
symptoms. Another model rejected attributing ADHD symp-
toms to hindered executive functioning, suggesting that ADHD 
symptoms arise from poor control of the default-mode network 
(DMN) when engaging in a task [36]. Despite their theoreti-
cal differences, most of these models agreed that individuals 
with ADHD exhibit distinct neurocognitive profiles identifiable 
through neuropsychological assessment.

Numerous studies have aimed to investigate the cognitive dif-
ferences between individuals with ADHD and controls. A 2018 
systematic  review  found  consistent  results,  indicating  that 
neurotypical individuals outperform those with ADHD in var-
ious neurocognitive domains such as reaction time variabili-
ty, intelligence/achievement, vigilance, working memory, and 
response  inhibition.  These  findings  support  the  DMN  mod-
el, which attributes ADHD symptoms to hindered abilities to 
switch from rest mode to active rest mode [32].

Cannabis Use Disorders

The self-medication theory, proposed in 1974, is perhaps the 
most widely known explanation for increased substance use 
among individuals with comorbid conditions. This theory sug-
gests that people who have comorbid disorders use illicit sub-
stances to alleviate unpleasant or disruptive psychiatric symp-
toms [9]. Based on principles of behavioral science, specifically 
negative reinforcement in Skinner’s operant conditioning, the 
theory postulates that individuals resort to substances to relieve 
uncomfortable symptoms, becoming reinforced to use the sub-
stance despite being aware of its adverse consequences [9,37].

Research indicates that individuals experiencing withdrawal (a 
characteristic marker of substance abuse) often turn to canna-
bis to alleviate pain and discomfort. In regions where canna-
bis is legal, people are less likely to use it to address depres-
sion and anxiety, but more likely to use it for mitigating social 
discomfort. Nonetheless, cannabis use is a complex phenom-
enon that warrants further investigation [22].

The inhibitory control dysfunction theory associates substance 
abuse with impulsivity, suggesting that such abuse may stem 
from impulsiveness or perseveration [38]. Substance use disor-
ders reflect impaired decision-making, indicating that higher-
order cognitive functions and related behavioral issues could 
be attributed to inhibitory control disturbances. Cannabis us-
ers report inhibitory control as one of the most persistent im-
pairments they experience, along with impaired memory and 
processing speed. Intriguingly, while inhibitory control could 
be a consequence of chronic cannabis use, it is also consid-
ered a predisposing factor for substance use vulnerability [39].

Default-Mode	Network

Cannabis Use Disorder

The default-mode network (DMN) was first identified in 2001 
by Raichle et al while studying resting state functional con-
nectivity (rsFC) using neuroimaging techniques [40]. The DMN 
comprises the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), hippocampal 
formation, lateral and medial parietal cortex, lateral temporal 
cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and precuneus, and reaches 
full development by adolescence [16]. The DMN demonstrates 
a consistent pattern of deactivation across its constituent brain 
regions during task-related activities, while showing abundant 
functional connectivity between these regions when the brain 
is at rest. Default-mode brain activity refers to the state where 
an individual is awake and alert but not engaged in goal-ori-
ented or attention-demanding tasks [41].

The DMN is associated with self-reflexive thought and atten-
tional-  and  stimulus-independent  control.  Research  on  rsFC 
shows DMN activations to be negatively related to task-pos-
itive networks, while stronger intra-DMN connectivity corre-
lates with better performance on working memory tasks, as 
does stronger anticorrelation between the DMN and execu-
tive control network [16].

A 2006 study by Tian et al analyzed rsFC of the DMN in ad-
olescents with ADHD, revealing increased functional connec-
tivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and 
bilateral brain regions. This increased connectivity may be at-
tributed to abnormalities within the autonomic control func-
tions of these regions or increased affinity within the DMN 
[36,42]. Other studies found similar results, suggesting that 
decreased functional interactions between posterior and an-
terior DMN regions may contribute to some executive func-
tion deficits, such as working memory deficiencies and atten-
tional lapses, associated with ADHD [43,44].

Neuroimaging studies on children with ADHD have found de-
creased regional homogeneity in the frontal-striatal-cerebellar 
circuit [45] and altered resting state fluctuation amplitudes in 
various brain regions [46]. A study by Helps et al examined hy-
peractive participants who described themselves as inatten-
tive, finding reduced power of low-frequency resting state net-
works in electroencephalogram data and emphasizing the need 
for further studies on clinical populations of the disorder [47].

In summary, ADHD appears to involve altered connectivity pat-
terns in the DMN, which may be associated with abnormal cir-
cuits in the frontal-striatal-cerebellar regions. These alterations 
may contribute to the attentional lapses, working memory deficits, 
and task performance oscillations often exhibited by individuals 
with ADHD. Consequently, ADHD pathophysiology is speculated 
to arise from both altered DMN connectivity patterns and atypi-
cal antagonism between DMN and task-positive networks [41].

Frequent and persistent cannabis use in adolescents can cause 
permanent changes in their neurocognitive functions due to 
alterations  in  brain  structures  and  corresponding  brain  cir-
cuits [46]. Regular substance abusers, including cannabis us-
ers, demonstrate changes in rsFC of the DMN, which may re-
flect structural connectivity within the network [49].

A study focusing on cannabis use among adolescents and young 
adults found stronger connectivity between the left PCC and 
the cerebellum, which was correlated with poorer performance 
on verbal learning tasks and sustained attention or working 
memory. In controls, stronger connectivity between the left PCC 
and left PCC precuneus was associated with quicker speed on 
both sustained and selective attentional measures. These re-
sults were supported by other research, which also found that 
higher intra-DMN connectivity implies better working memo-
ry task performance [16].

Increased activity of the anterior and posterior DMN has been 
linked to the positive emotionality personality trait (considered 
a protective factor for SUD) in studies of resting baseline ac-
tivity using glucose metabolic rate as a brain function marker. 
Interestingly, studies investigating the withdrawal or detoxifi-
cation phase of various abused substances found significant 
reductions in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activity in canna-
bis abusers, among others. These findings may be central to 
disturbances in emotional processing and decision-making ob-
served in addiction, as these processes involve engagement of 
the medial prefrontal cortex, which is also actively engaged in 
motivational and reward circuit dysregulation [37].

Research by Bossong et al explored the association between 
the DMN and D9-THC in human executive function. The re-
sults showed that D9-THC administration was associated with 
impaired task performance and lower DMN activation during 
task performance-oriented activities. These findings highlight 
the role of the ECS in terms of both the DMN and executive 
functioning, the latter being a core deficit of psychiatric con-
ditions like schizophrenia, ADHD, and Alzheimer disease. The 
relationship between these conditions and DMN modulation 
(involving  the  ECS  system)  is  relevant  and  warrants  further 
investigation [50].

The Endocannabinoid System

The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) was first discovered in the 
early 1990s. Research implicates the system in a variety of pro-
cesses, including synaptic plasticity, memory, stress, emotion 
regulation, immune function, and psychiatric conditions [17,51]. 
Most research on natural cannabis constituents, called phy-
tocannabinoids, focuses on D9-THC, which produces changes

in mood, emotion, perception, and cognition. However, recent 
years have seen increasing interest in the role of another en-
docannabinoid, CBD, which demonstrates therapeutic potential 
with advantages surpassing those observed in D9-THC. Despite 
CBD’s uncertain effects, studies show that the phytocannabi-
noid acts as an agonist on serotonin receptors (5-HT), reveal-
ing its antidepressant and cognition-enhancing effects [19,22].

The ECS system is a neuromodulator system involving 2 main 
receptors: CB1R and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R). CB1R 
is  implicated  in  various  processes,  such  as  memory,  learn-
ing, cognition, mood, motivation, emotion, and motor activi-
ty. Although CB2R was previously thought to engage primari-
ly within the immune system, recent findings link the receptor 
to modulating midbrain dopamine (DA) activity. The ECS sys-
tem’s role is important in both ADHD and SUDs or CUDs due 
to its involvement in emotional regulation and motivational 
processes [19].

A review by Katzman aimed to explore the role of the ECS sys-
tem across various psychiatric conditions. Despite numerous 
preclinical models linking ADHD pathophysiology with ECS dys-
function, little research exists on such dysfunction in ADHD-
related impairment [19]. However, research on D9-THC’s influ-
ence on executive functioning by Bossong et al suggests that 
the ECS system plays an important role in executive function-
ing, particularly in relation to the DMN [50].

Disorders characterized by DA deficiency, like ADHD and au-
tism spectrum disorder, have been investigated in connection 
with the ECS system. DA level disturbances observed in ADHD 
individuals have been linked to the experience of reward and 
motivation. Experimental research has suggested relationships 
between the ECS system and DA production, attributing the 
DA system dysfunction in ADHD clinical manifestation to the 
interplay between the two [52].

Similar findings were postulated in a review by Dawson and 
Persad, who concluded that targeting the ECS system in ADHD 
treatment and understanding its effects on DA system dys-
function could provide insight into the fundamentals of ADHD 
symptomatology and clinical manifestations. However, despite 
these promising findings and research directions, ADHD is a 
complex disorder with roots in both genetic and non-genetic 
(ie, environmental) factors, as well as their interplay [11,52].

Cannabis Use Disorders

Common neurological mechanisms underlying SUDs involve 
the ECN, which plays a key role in mediating reward and mo-
tivation,  particularly  concerning  substance  effects  and  sub-
stance-related cues [51]. These cues can induce drug-seeking 
responses when conditioned by cannabis use, as the substance 

elicits phasic DA events, implicating the role of the ECS in the 
formation  of  addictive  behavior  [17].  Persistent  substance 
use leads to constant disturbance of DA activity, resulting in 
long-lasting changes in plasticity and hindering cessation of 
substance use, while also contributing to an increased risk of 
relapse. Functional changes across corticostriatal structures, 
which modulate reward and motivation in substance use, con-
tribute to cellular adaptations occurring in the transition from 
substance use to substance dependence [51].

Research highlights the important role of the ECS in emotional 
learning and memory processes. Memory performance may be 
modulated by ECS signaling amplification, as demonstrated in 
animal models. Endocannabinoids appear to induce long-term 
synaptic strength changes across the hippocampus, which me-
diates associative memory formation and assists in both neg-
ative and positive reinforcement to reward. Meanwhile, phyto-
cannabinoids (D9-THC and CBD) have been found to modulate 
limbic brain activity in functional emotional processing. Animal 
models show that CB1R agonists and antagonists facilitate and 
weaken memory extinction in both reward- and fear-condi-
tioning instances. These aspects of the ECS role in emotional 
memory can contribute to extinction, consolidation, and res-
toration of substance-related memory [51].

Comorbidity Between ADHD and SUDs, or CUDs

Both SUDs and ADHD are characterized by abnormal reward 
processing,  involving  alterations  in  DA  transporter  binding, 
D2 receptor levels, and DA release. The relationship between 
these is complex, but the high prevalence of SUDs in people 
with ADHD may be rooted in the fact that distinct substanc-
es stimulate neurotransmitter release (mainly DA), reducing 
ADHD-core symptoms [53,54]. DA mechanisms vary across sub-
stances; for example, cannabis or opiates do not increase DA 
levels as much as other substances [54]. The involvement of 
the DMN and ECS in reward processing have been described 
above in previous sections.

Daily cannabis use is more frequent among people with ADHD 
who have the combined subtype than those with the predomi-
nantly inattentive subtype. The relationship between these two 
was found to be significant, with individuals with the mixed sub-
type being 10% more likely to develop daily cannabis use than 
those with the predominantly inattentive subtype. Furthermore, 
individuals using cannabis as self-medication were more like-
ly to have ADHD, specifically its combined subtype, support-
ing the self-medication hypothesis [9]. Evidence also indicates 
that females with comorbid SUDs and ADHD used cannabis 
for longer durations than those with SUDs and no ADHD, as 
well as males with SUDs and ADHD, or with SUDs alone [55].

Comorbidity between ADHD and SUDs is associated with in-
creased  cannabis  use.  Numerous  studies  have  shown  that

individuals with ADHD and SUDs have an earlier onset of sub-
stance use and cannabis use [11,24,55,56]. Early cannabis use 
(ie, during adolescence) is linked to the disruption of functional 
circuit maturation-refinement [14,56]. Research indicates that 
33.19-38.10% of adolescents with CUDs have a comorbid ADHD 
diagnosis. ADHD is the most common psychiatric comorbidi-
ty among cannabis abusers and problematic users, and is the 
second-highest  comorbidity  with  cannabis  dependence  [58]. 
Lifetime cannabis use rates more than triple between the ages 
of 18 to 25 years, with 15.8% of adolescents using cannabis de-
veloping lifetime CUDs, compared to 51.7% of young adults [22].

Data show that the prevalence of ADHD in adults seeking treat-
ment for CUDs is 34-46% [9,59]. ADHD prevalence in SUDs seems 
to vary across different substances of choice [21]. People with 
ADHD who abuse cannabis are characterized by higher psychopa-
thology severity, along with increased hostility, activation, suspi-
ciousness, and thought disturbances. These results support other 
research, which found D9-THC to be associated with psychosis, 
paranoia, and aggressiveness in chronic, heavy users [10,18].

The co-occurrence of ADHD and CUDs poses diagnostic chal-
lenges,  as  frequent  cannabis  use  produces  neurocognitive 
changes in executive functioning, similar to those central to 
ADHD. Clinicians failing to assess cannabis use or patients fail-
ing to admit to such use can lead to possible erroneous (false-
positive) ADHD diagnoses. Some research suggests that the 
high comorbidity between ADHD and CUDs may result from 
the latter inducing neurocognitive changes that mimic ADHD 
symptoms [56]. However, other findings argue that cannabis-
induced cognitive changes alone cannot explain the relation-
ship  between  ADHD  and  CUDs  due  to  their  commonalities, 
such as ECS dysfunction [59].

Cannabis	and	Its	Therapeutic	Applications

In  recent  years,  the  topic  of  cannabis,  its  therapeutic  form 
(MM), and its applications in the treatment of psychiatric dis-
orders has emerged in scientific contexts. Numerous reviews 
have studied MM’s therapeutic potential in psychiatric condi-
tions, but most evidence remains insufficient due to it com-
ing from animal models, while human studies often lack rigor 
and have small sample sizes [18,19,31,60]. It is worth noting 
that there is some inconclusive evidence suggesting CBD might 
be used as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia, and a 
few isolated studies show CBD’s efficacy in social anxiety [61].

Individuals with ADHD often use cannabis as a coping strat-
egy (self-medication hypothesis). Analysis of online sources 
concluded  that  cannabis  is  considered  efficacious  in  ADHD 
symptoms in 25% of the considered posts, as opposed to 8% 
that indicated it is harmful [62]. Only 1 RCT study assessed 
nabiximol  (a  cannabinoid/terpene  combination)  oromuco-
sal  spray  effects  in  30  adults  with  ADHD  for  6  weeks.  The 

primary endpoint was cognitive performance measured by the 
Quantitative Behavioural Test, which showed no statistically 
significant differences (and no impairment of performance) in 
the active group. Secondary outcomes involved emotional lia-
bility symptoms. Nabiximol significantly improved hyperactiv-
ity/impulsivity scores on the investigator-rated Conners Adult 
ADHD Rating Scale in the active group [63]. Despite the limi-
tations of this study, it provides evidence supporting the self-
medication theory. However, possible cannabis application in 
ADHD treatment requires further investigation of the endo-
cannabinoid system, as many studies show that cannabis can 
worsen symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivi-
ty. Reduction in cannabis use might be connected with reduced 
use of other substances, such as alcohol, which may result in 
improved ADHD symptoms [64].

MM  has  both  neuroprotective  and  neurotoxic  effects  [14]. 
Applications  of  MM  have  been  discussed  regarding  CUDs, 
but substitutional therapy with MM in CUDs remains ques-
tionable  [17].  In  the  best  circumstances,  evidence  suggests 
that CBD may be beneficial as an adjunct to standard ther-
apy in SUDs, but results pertaining to its efficacy and safe-
ty are mixed [31]. According to Brucato, discussions on MM’s 
potential therapeutic applications must not overlook the dan-
gers associated with cannabis use, especially among adoles-
cents [57]. Lastly, it is important to consider that MM’s influ-
ence on the ECS may have ramifications. The ECS is involved 
in both secondary reward (like those produced by substanc-
es) and primary, natural reward. Interference within the sys-
tem may affect natural reward mechanisms, which drive dai-
ly activities, leading to serious consequences [17].

Limitations

This review has several limitations. The primary drawbacks in-
clude: (1) the questionable reliability of evidence (some of the 
presented results come from research based on self-report mea-
sures or longitudinal studies); (2) a limited number of sources in 
specific sections (particularly the sections about the DMN and 
ECS); and (3) some data pertaining to SUDs in general, rather 
than exclusively CUDs. Despite these limitations, this review of-
fers a comprehensive overview of the shared pathophysiology of 
ADHD, SUDs, and CUDs. Future research should focus on explor-
ing the complex relationship between ADHD, SUDs, and CUDs. 
Moreover, there is an important need to systematize the knowl-
edge by conducting more human-based research, particularly clin-
ical trials with rigorous methodologies and larger sample sizes.

Future	Directions

This review offers an overview of the comorbidity among ADHD, 
SUDs,  and  CUDs,  focusing  on  their  characteristics,  shared

symptomatology, and underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. 
The comorbidity and mutual relationship are significant, as es-
timates suggest that half of adults with ADHD will meet the 
criteria for SUDs at some point in their lifetime. Furthermore, 
reports indicate that cannabis is the most widely used illicit 

substance in Europe and the United States; in line with popu-
lation-wide trends, the same phenomenon occurs within the 
ADHD population. As a result, this topic warrants further in-
depth studies in the future.
