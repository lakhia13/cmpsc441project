Abstract
There is increasing interest in the use of games to scaffold social skills training for autistic children and youth. However, 
there is no consensus on how to best approach their design, so that learning opportunities are maximised. This article 
presents a systematic scoping review of empirical studies that use games as social skills training for autistic children and 
youth. We set out to describe the different types of game-based interventions observed, to identify those that typically 
bring successful outcomes (while noting the social skills targeted in each), and to highlight the psychological intervention 
approach taken. Through a search of five databases, 3070 studies were identified and reduced, through screening, to a 
sample of 17 studies. Each study reported that their game successfully promoted social skills training for autistic people. 
Although not a part of the criteria, all studies included a technological element. However, across the sample, there was 
also a lack of specificity in how ‘social skills’ were defined and in which skills were chosen as the focus of the intervention. 
Moving forward, we recommend a more theoretically driven approach to defining behavioral targets for game-based 
interventions, as well as the inclusion of autistic voices earlier and more centrally in the design processes.

Lay Abstract 
There is growing interest in using games to help autistic children and youth learn social skills. However, there is no 
clear agreement on the best way to design these games to ensure they are most effective. In our research, we reviewed 
studies that used games to teach social skills to autistic children and youth. We aimed to describe the different types 
of  games,  identify  which  ones  were  most  successful  and  understand  the  psychological  methods  used.  We  searched 
five databases and found 3070 studies, which we narrowed down to 17 that met our criteria. Each of these 17 studies 
reported that their game helped improve social skills in autistic children. Interestingly, all these studies used some form 
of technology, even though this was not a requirement. However, we noticed that many studies were not clear on what 
specific social skills they were targeting or how they defined ‘social skills’. For future work, we suggest that game-based 
interventions should be more clearly based on established theories. In addition, it is important to involve autistic people 
in the design of these games to ensure they meet their needs effectively.

Introduction

Globally, it is estimated that roughly 1-in-100 children are 
autistic though some studies report higher figures (World 
Health Organization, 2023; Zeidan et al., 2022). As defined 
by  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition, autism is characterised by quali-
tative impairment in social communication, engagement in 
rituals  and  routines,  and  sensory  sensitivities  (American 
Psychiatric  Association  (APA),  2013).  These  challenges 
often  involve  difficulties  in  social  cognition,  language, 

communication  and  cognitive  flexibility  –  the  ability  to 
adapt  thinking  or  behaviour  in  response  to  changing 
demands (Charman, 2003; Ke & Moon, 2018; Lage et al., 
2024).

Autism 29(2)

Social  skills,  which  integrate  behavioural,  cognitive 
and  affective  components,  are  essential  for  adapting  to 
social contexts and encompass both verbal and nonverbal 
behaviours  crucial  for 
interpersonal  communication 
(Giusti et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2007). Consequently, autis-
tic people often face challenges in social competence, such 
as understanding social cues or navigating social interac-
tions  (Kylliäinen  et  al.,  2020).  Specific  aspects  of  social 
skills,  including  joint  attention,  conversational  abilities 
and  social  participation,  have  been  the  focus  of  research 
(Colombi et al., 2009; Ke & Moon, 2018). For instance, 
joint attention is defined as the ability to jointly focus on 
an object or area with another person (Salo et al., 2018).

These  social  challenges  underscore  the  importance  of 
developing cognitive flexibility and social skills. Research 
indicates that autistic children, even when integrated into 
mainstream classrooms, often report greater loneliness and 
poorer friendship quality compared to their peers and are 
more susceptible to bullying victimisation (Libster et al., 
2022; Locke et al., 2010). Gender differences show autis-
tic girls tend to stay close to peers during free play, while 
boys often engage in solitary activities (Dean et al., 2017). 
In addition, there is a significant relationship between joint 
engagement  and  loneliness,  suggesting  that  social  group 
participation may sometimes exacerbate feelings of isola-
tion (Dean et al., 2023). Autistic children often prefer to 
have  a  few  close  friends  whom  they  trust  (Lam  et  al., 
2020). Moreover, differences in social skills can be a pre-
dictor of social anxiety in young autistic people (Bellini, 
2006), potentially hindering their ability to interact effec-
tively  with  peers  (Bauminger,  2006).  Considering  these 
findings,  supporting  autistic  youth  in  developing  their 
social skills through play is worthwhile.

Intervention approaches

Social skills training (SST) is commonly used to enhance 
social functioning in autistic children, with group interven-
tions particularly effective in improving social communica-
tion (Reichow et al., 2012). Group-based SST is often seen 
as  the  most  efficient  method  (Freitag  et  al.,  2013).  Well-
designed  SST  interventions  can  contribute  to  enhanced 
social and academic well-being (Foster & Bussman, 2007; 
Stichter et al., 2014). Various strategies have been employed 
in  teaching  social  skills,  with  approximately  a  quarter  of 
teachers reportedly using at least one evidence-based prac-
tice specific to autism (Paisley et al., 2022).

One  effective  SST  method  is  video  modelling,  which 
involves demonstrating a target skill through video, using 
either  self-modelling  or  peer  modelling  (Galligan  et  al., 
2020). Video modelling has proven effective in promoting 
appropriate  behaviours  (Ashori  &  Jalil-Abkenar,  2019; 
Burton et al., 2013; Plavnick et al., 2015), effective com-
munication skills (Gelbar et al., 2012), daily living skills 
(Aldi  et  al.,  2016),  vocational  skills  (Kellems  & 

Morningstar,  2012)  and  reciprocal  social  interactions 
(Boudreau & Harvey, 2013).

Other intervention approaches for social skill develop-
ment  include  community-based  programmes  (Koegel 
et al., 2012), peer mediation (Allen & Barber, 2015) and 
play-based  interventions  (Neugnot-Cerioli  et  al.,  2015). 
Activities  focusing  on  shared  interests,  such  as  mutually 
enjoyed activities, may facilitate connections among autis-
tic youth (Bottema-Beutel et al., 2016; Kasari et al., 2012). 
For  instance,  LEGO  been  utilised  as  a  tool  to  facilitate 
play-based social skills interventions (Legoff & Sherman, 
2006).  Imaginary  friends  also  have  positive  impacts  on 
understanding  others  and  enhancing  social  skills  (Davis, 
2020; Davis et al., 2022).

School-based  SST  interventions  are  supported  by 
empirical evidence. Research with elementary school staff 
highlights a desire for such programmes (Silveira-Zaldivar 
&  Curtis,  2019).  While  many  video  modelling  studies 
focus  on  younger  children,  positive  outcomes  are  also 
observed in second-level students (Galligan et al., 2020). 
The  Program  for  the  Education  and  Enrichment  of 
Relational  Skills  (PEERS)  for  high  school  students 
employs strategies such as didactic lessons and role-play 
demonstrations,  showing  ovrall  improvements  in  social 
awareness  and  communication  (Laugeson  et  al.,  2012). 
Here, students navigate various social skills such as friend-
ship maintenance, and handling conflict. Chang and Dean 
(2022)  conducted  a  systematic  review  of  school-based 
social skills interventions for autistic youth, revealing that 
these interventions were largely rooted in evidence-based 
practices  and  effectively  enhanced  social  outcomes  in 
inclusive educational settings. For instance, the ‘Remaking 
Recess’  programme  improved  peer  relationships  on  the 
playground and classroom connections, reducing solitary 
play (Kasari et al., 2016; Shih et al., 2019).

Game-based interventions

Play is crucial for child development, serving as a platform 
for learning social skills (Gresham, 1981; Vygotsky, 1978). 
Consequently, exclusion from, or a lack of social play can 
impact  the  development  of  social  abilities,  potentially 
leading  anxiety  and  loneliness  (Bauminger  et  al.,  2003), 
underscoring  the  significance  of  fostering  social  skills. 
Despite  challenges  in  social  skills,  many  autistic  adoles-
cents enjoy socialising, with computer games and socialis-
ing  being  common  favourite  activities  (Clark  & Adams, 
2020). This highlights a misconception that autistic chil-
dren  do  not  like  socialising  (Jaswal  &  Akhtar,  2018). 
Furthermore, video games can yield positive outcomes for 
autistic children (Jiménez-Muñoz et al., 2022), improving 
daily  life  skills  such  as  hygiene  (Kang  &  Chang,  2019), 
enhancing  emotion  recognition  (Fridenson-Hayo  et  al., 
2017) and boosting concentration and self-esteem (Jouen 
et al., 2017).

Games,  as  ‘world-building  activities’  (Goffman,  1961, 
p.  27),  are  immersive  and  can  motivate  players,  making 
them  effective 
interventions. 
Gamification  can  enhance  motivation,  learning  outcomes 
and  engagement  (Dichev  &  Dicheva,  2017).  In  addition, 
games can facilitate the development of emotional compe-
tencies  (Dell’Angela  et  al.,  2020)  and  provide  immediate 
and  consistent  feedback  (M.  Moore  &  Calvert,  2000). 
Serious  games,  coined  in  the  1970s,  are  digital  games 
designed  not  only  for  entertainment  but  also  to  achieve 
additional goals (Caserman et al., 2020), for example, emo-
tion  regulation  and  communication  skills  (Bazoolnejad 
et al., 2022). These games aim to achieve objectives while 
maintaining  an  enjoyable  player  experience  (Caserman 
et  al.,  2020).  For  example,  Pokémon  Go,  a  2016  mobile 
game,  promotes  physical  activity  and  has  positive  social 
effects (Wang, 2021). One promising application of serious 
games  is  in  teaching  social  skills  to  autistic  youth 
(Bernardini et al., 2014). Role-playing games (RPGs) can 
offer a safe space for autistic people to practice social inter-
actions,  associated  with  improved  friendships  and  emo-
tional well-being (Katō, 2019; Kilmer et al., 2023).

Aims of current article

Social  skills  are  complex  and  multifaceted,  involving 
behaviours  performed  in  social  contexts  (Cordier  et  al., 
2015; Wolstencroft  et  al.,  2018).  McMahon  et  al.  (2013) 
categorise  social  skills  into  various  domains,  including 
nonverbal  (gestures,  etc.),  verbal  (metaphors,  etc.)  and 
social interaction (conversation, etc.). Despite their impor-
tance, there is no consensus on the best approach to design-
ing interventions. This article reviews past research using 
games  as  social  skills  interventions  for  autistic  children 
and youth, examining their methods and outcomes.

was studying.

Appraisal  tool:  We  utilised  the  mixed  methods 
appraisal tool (MMAT) (Hong et al., 2018). The MMAT is 
designed for the appraisal stage of systematic. Following 
MMAT guidelines, it is discouraged to calculate an overall 
score from the ratings of each criterion. It is also recom-
mended against excluding studies of low methodological 
quality.

To  ensure  a  comprehensive  search  strategy,  we  con-
ducted a preliminary meeting with a librarian who provided 
guidance on developing search terms, selecting appropriate 
databases and refining the search strategy (Table 1).

As seen in Table 4, social skills encompass various fac-
ets  of  interaction  and  communication,  both  verbal  and 
nonverbal. The term ‘communication’ was mentioned six 
times,  while  ‘interaction’,  ‘collaboration’  and  ‘attention’ 
each appeared three times. Social skills are often viewed 
as  an  individual’s  effectiveness  in  engaging  with  others, 
considering  factors  like  body  language  (Marchi  et  al., 
2019;  Tsai  et  al.,  2020).  Many  behaviours  are  linked  to 
social reciprocity, which assesses an individual’s willing-
ness and ability to engage in reciprocal social interactions, 
including how they respond to others or negotiate in inter-
personal situations (van Ommeren et al., 2011). Initiating 
social  interactions  and  conveying  thoughts  and  feelings 
are seen as important, as is expressing emotions through 
facial  expressions  and  body  language.  Some  studies 
explore  specific  aspects 
like  metaphoric  meaning 
(Barakova et al., 2009) and symbol use (Bernardini et al., 
2014), emphasising the multifaceted nature of social skills. 
Overall, social skills can be categorised into social interac-
tion, collaboration, joint attention and emotion expression, 
all of which are pertinent in understanding and supporting 
autistic people. Participants interacted with different part-
ners  depending  on  the  study’s  design.  These  partners 
include  other  participants,  avatars  or  a  combination  of 
both. The number of sessions per participant varied widely 

management software, Rayyan. The process is detailed 
in table 3.

Community Involvement and reflexivity: There was 
no community involvement. I, the first author, am autistic. 
Thus, I am analysing the studies through a neurodivergent 
lens, and my own autistic experience. As an autistic per-
son, I am personally engaged with the autistic community

Narrative synthesis

What game-based approaches were taken in 
the teaching of social skills to autistic children 
and youth?

Various  game-based  approaches  were  used  to  teach 
social skills. Some studies detailed their methodologies 

(Giusti  et al.,  2011;  Marchi  et al.,  2019;  Ribeiro  et al., 
2014; Silva et al., 2014; Terlouw et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 
2020), while others focused on outcomes. This suggests 
a  divergence  in  research  methodologies,  with  some 
researchers  prioritising  the  documentation  of  the  game 
design  process  and  approach,  while  others  emphasise 
outcome evaluation.

Four interventions (Chung et al., 2016; Guivarch et al., 
2017; Jordan et al., 2013; MacCormack & Freeman, 2019) 
used pre-existing games, including one adapted from a tra-
ditional  matching  pairs  game  (Jordan  et  al.,  2013).  The 
images on the cards depicted familiar individuals, drawing

Using the ECHOES platform, which includes 
interactions with a virtual agent, improved rates of 
interaction and initiation

The use of a prosocial online game combined with 
CBT led to notable improvements in social interactions 
compared to traditional offline CBT
Effectiveness in enhancing collaboration, attention, 
negotiation and coordination stemmed from CBT-based 
interventions and specific game design elements like 
structured tasks and flexible phases
Enhancements in adaptation, empathy, self-confidence 
and prosocial attitudes were linked to implicit social 
skills training and CBT-based interventions using 
structured group activities

Aspects of the intervention, such as peer-mediated play 
and imaginative activities, were linked to improvements 
in group play and reductions in trait anxiety
Playing with a humanoid robot was associated with 
increased interaction, while repetitive behaviours were 
reduced
The chess game was particularly effective for improving 
negotiation skills and cognitive flexibility, whereas role-
playing simulation games were associated with a broad 
enhancement of social skills through varied game-based 
learning patterns
VR-based collaborative and design-oriented activities 
were most effective for enhancing negotiation, self-
identity expression, and cognitive flexibility, whereas 
individual or competitive tasks often led to less 
predictable outcomes
Structured play with specific roles and objectives was 
associated with improved rates of social initiations and 
the development of cooperative play dynamics, while 
free play showed gradual improvements in social skills 
but with less consistent and predictable outcomes
The game led to significant increases in social initiation 
behaviours and a decrease in repetitive behaviours 
compared to free play, which showed less pronounced 
and consistent effects

Improvement in emotion and body language recognition, 
socialisation and gesture modality was achieved through 
a training programme that included two 15 min serious 
gaming sessions per week
Teacher-led interventions, including direct 
communication guidance and conceptual explanations, 
significantly contributed to enhancing reciprocal and 
collaborative communication
Improvements in communication skills were achieved 
through cooperative gameplay and a gradual reduction

The third-person perspective RPG system significantly 
enhanced autistic children’s ability to recognise and 
respond to emotions, facial expressions, and body 
language, resulting in improved role-play performance 
and sustained social skill development

on autistic people’s preference for familiarity and predict-
ability (Prizant et al., 2003).

Several studies developed new games (Barakova et al., 
2009; Bernardini et al., 2014; Giusti et al., 2011; Mairena 
et  al.,  2019;  Marchi  et  al.,  2019;  Parsons,  2015;  Ribeiro 
et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2014; Terlouw et al., 2021; Tsai 
et al., 2020). For example, Terlouw et al. (2021) created an 
escape room game using the Design Research Framework 
for  iterative  development. This  approach  involved  incre-
mental enhancements to refine and enrich the escape room 
experience. Other games introduced unique characters for 
interaction (Bernardini et al., 2014; Mairena et al., 2019).

Virtual  worlds  through  OpenSimulator  were  explored 
in two studies (Ke et al., 2022; Ke & Moon, 2018). Another 
study developed a 3D cave virtual environment RPG (Tsai 
et  al.,  2020).  Participants,  aged  7–9  and  attending  main-
stream schools, engaged in the RPG, encountering various 
social scenarios. Multiple cameras were employed to ena-
ble players to view themselves from different perspectives, 
potentially  fostering  self-reflection  as  they  observe  their 
interactions.  Elsewhere,  cameras  were  used  to  capture 
facial,  vocal  and  bodily  expressions  to  understand  emo-
tional expression (Marchi et al., 2019).

Ioannou et al. (2020) improved social play skills through 
a theatre-based programme and at-home video modelling, a 
proven method for teaching various skills to autistic learners 
(Aldi et al., 2016). Video modelling is a teaching method that 
utilises video recordings and playback equipment to visually 
demonstrate  the  targeted  behaviour  or  skill.  (Franzone  & 
Collet-Klingenberg, 2008).

Technology  was  a  prevailing  theme,  ranging  from 
screen-based  to  physical  elements  like  humanoid  robots. 
Some games immersed participants in virtual worlds (Ke 
et  al.,  2022;  Ke  &  Moon,  2018),  while  others  integrated 
technology into real-life settings (Barakova et al., 2009). 
As  noted,  there  was  a  discrepancy  in  how  ‘social’  these 
social  skills  games  were.  For  instance,  some  games 
(Bernardini  et  al.,  2014;  Mairena  et  al.,  2019)  involved 

children interacting or socialising with video game charac-
ters, while others required interaction with other children 
or adults (e.g. Parsons, 2015).

Which approaches to game-based social skills 
training demonstrate positive results?

Two  games  were  played  from  participants’  homes  (Ke 
et  al.,  2022;  Ke  &  Moon,  2018),  while  the  others  took 
place  in  various  locations,  including  hospitals,  primary 
schools  and  universities.  Some  used  existing  games  for 
social  skills  intervention  (Chung  et  al.,  2016;  Guivarch 
et al., 2017; Jordan et al., 2013; MacCormack & Freeman, 
2019),  while  the  others  were  designed  specifically  as 
social  skills  interventions.  All  interventions  featured 
extensive  adult  facilitation.  Thirteen  of  the  17  studies 
adhered  to  a  manualised  approach,  which  involved 
detailed,  standardised  guidelines  for  the  delivery  of  the 
intervention.  However,  there  were  exceptions  where  the 
interventions  were  not  strictly  manualised  (Barakova 
et al., 2009; Bernardini et al., 2014; Guivarch et al., 2017; 
Ribeiro et al., 2014). For instance, Bernardini et al. (2014) 
used  a  flexible,  adaptive  approach  in  the  ECHOES 
intervention.

As  outlined  in  table  6,  serious  games  like  ECHOES 
often use virtual agents or environments to create immer-
sive  experiences  for  enhancing  social  skills.  Tabletop 
games, including both co-located and multitouch variants, 
introduce  a  tangible  and  collaborative  dimension  to  skill 
development. Co-located games rely on physical compo-
nents like boards and cards, while multitouch variants use 
digital displays and touch inputs. RPGs offer engaging set-
tings for skill development. While serious games, virtual 
environments  and  virtual  reality  games  are  common,  the 
prevalence of serious games may stem from their versatil-
ity in addressing various therapeutic goals The choice of 
game  type  likely  depends  on  the  specific  social  skill 
objectives.

All studies showed that game-based interventions pro-
moted  social  skills  in  autistic  children  and  youth,  using 
various outcome measures. For example, Ke et al. (2022) 
reported improvements in negotiation, self-identity expres-
sion  and  cognitive  flexibility  in  10–14-year-old  partici-
pants  after  a  20 h  virtual  reality  programme.  Enhanced 
self-identity  expression  included  expressing  preferences 
and explaining personal perspectives. High-pressure social 
scenarios like job interviews posed challenges to self-iden-
tity expression. Ioannou et al. (2020) found that theatrical 
performance  reduced  self-reported  anxiety  and  fostered 
social  engagement.  However,  some  studies  noted  limita-
tions; for instance, Guivarch et al. (2017) saw significant 
improvements in certain areas but not others, such as anxi-
ety.  Different  definitions  of  social  skills  across  studies 
complicate direct comparisons.

The game ECHOES was developed based on the Social 
Communication,  Emotional  Regulation,  and Transactional 
Support  (SCERTS)  framework,  specifically  tailored  for 
autistic children (Bernardini et al., 2014) and emphasises an 
individualised,  family-centred  approach  to  intervention 
(Prizant et al., 2006). ECHOES features a virtual character 
named  Andy,  who  greets  the  child  by  name  and  offers 
encouraging feedback. Affirmative feedback has been iden-
tified as a motivator for children and youth (de Haas et al., 
2020). While this can motivate children, it raises questions 
about the ‘social’ nature of interactions with a video game 
character. These interactions may be parasocial, giving an 
illusion of reciprocity but lacking real-life social nuances. 

Thus,  such  games  should  complement,  not  replace,  other 
social skills development methods (Zheng et al., 2021).

There was a discrepancy in the rigour of outcome meas-
urement methods. Some studies used pre- and post-meas-
ures with observation checklists, while others relied solely 
on observations. In studies with less robust methodologies, 
observed improvements may be influenced by other fac-
tors.  For  instance,  Barakova  et  al.  (2009)  compared  two 
games and found more social interactions in the game with 
metaphorical meaning, but the lack of pre- and post-testing 
makes it hard to attribute differences solely to the interven-
tion.  Comprehensive  outcome  measures,  including  both 
pre- and post-assessments, would enhance the robustness 
of  findings  and  better  attribute  improvements  to  the 
interventions.

This  limitation  is  evident  in  several  studies.  Without 
pre- and post-measures, discerning the specific impact of 
game-based interventions is compromised. Including com-
prehensive  outcome  measures  with  both  pre-  and  post-
assessments would enhance the robustness of findings and 
allow researchers to attribute differences more confidently 
to the intervention.

Which social skills are targeted in game-based 
interventions – and why?

Across the studies, there was a lack of specificity in defin-
ing and discussing social skills, with many failing to jus-
tify  why  particular  skills  were  chosen  for  intervention.

Past studies show that many autistic people exhibit a natural affinity for technology and a positive 
attitude towards computer-based training. These spaces may offer a predictable and structured 
environment, which can accommodate for a preference for routine or repetitive behaviours.
VR can provide a space for naturalistic social skills training. It has an intrinsic appeal to visual 
learners. The non-threatening environment that VR can cultivate allows users to safely practise 
social skills.
Technology-enhanced learning and educational technologies can be designed for supporting learning 
in core areas of difficulty.
One of the benefits of technological interventions is the flexibility they can offer. For example, the 
environment can be customised according to specific needs.
Video-modelling can help autistic children to understand/reflect on social behaviours. It can also 
assist them in understanding the perspective of others and how their behaviour impacts them.

Technology research

Activity-based interventions might be preferable for autistic people as they provide 
structure or a concrete focal point.
This study looked at theatrical role-play and research on autism and social anxiety.
A social skills programme should enhance the autistic person’s attention and motivation 
towards social information and interaction. This can be achieved through increasing the 
relevance of the social stimulus in solving a task.
When autistic youth are left out from play, they do not get the opportunities they 
need to practise or develop social abilities. This can result in the young person feeling 
isolated. Peer mediation can help autistic youth improve their social competence.
Collaborative patterns were focused on as they help to encourage collaboration for 
autistic people. Such contribute to cooperative skills and the generation of social 
interactions.

Instead, they broadly referred to current diagnostic crite-
ria. While it is logical that interventions may include some 
form of social communication training, this could encom-
pass various elements (Newschaffer et al., 2007), includ-
ing  verbal  and  nonverbal  factors.  Moreover,  within  each 
diagnostic  category,  multiple  domains  of  function  have 
influence and impact. Thus, solely referring to the broad 
characteristics of autistic people does not adequately jus-
tify why specific skills, such as collaboration (Silva et al., 
2014) or turn-taking (Mairena et al., 2019), are targeted for 
intervention.

The concept of social reciprocity, the capacity to engage 
in  social  interactions  involving  two  or  more  people 
(Schwartz et al., 2021), was evident in several studies. In 
addition, it is defined as the ability to process social infor-
mation, understand spoken communication and appropri-
ately  respond  in  interpersonal  interactions  (Constantino 
et al., 2000). As seen in Table 7, although not all explicitly 
used the term, the targeted behaviours often aligned with 
its definition.

Not all social skills fall under social reciprocity. Other 
studies explored specific skills like understanding others’ 
perspectives (Ke et al., 2022; Ke & Moon, 2018; Parsons, 
2015;  Tsai  et  al.,  2020),  cognitive  flexibility  (Ke  et  al., 

2022;  Ke  &  Moon,  2018)  and  learning  new  vocabulary 
(Ribeiro et al., 2014). These skills do not necessarily rely 
on reciprocal interactions.

Some  studies  provided  clear  rationales  for  selecting 
specific  skills  (Barakova  et  al.,  2009;  Bernardini  et  al., 
2014; Ioannou et al., 2020; Ke & Moon, 2018; MacCormack 
& Freeman, 2019; Terlouw et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2020). 
For  example,  Terlouw  et  al.  (2021)  aimed  to  facilitate 
direct communication between autistic children and peers, 
citing  conversational  challenges.  MacCormack  and 
Freeman (2019) focused on social competence to address 
the negative outcomes of social exclusion. However, while 
justifying their focus on social competence, the latter study 
lacks a comprehensive description of its components, leav-
ing room for interpretation.

Often, the rationale for selecting specific skills and their 
benefits for autistic people was unclear (Chung et al., 2016; 
Giusti et al., 2011; Jordan et al., 2013; Ke et al., 2022; Marchi 
et al., 2019; Parsons, 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2014; Silva et al., 
2014). For example, Mairena et al. (2019) targeted social ini-
tiation skills, such as achieving eye contact and joint atten-
tion, but did not clearly explain their relevance to autism. Is 
eye contact crucial for social initiation, or is it merely per-
ceived as important by neurotypical people? This ambiguity 

338 

Autism 29(2)

persists  across  our  sample  of  studies. Thus,  it  is  crucial  to 
ask: Why are these the skills being taught? Are we training 
autistic people to conform to neurotypical standards, or are 
we enhancing their quality of life?

Despite inconsistencies, authors could have established 
a taxonomy of skills and their definitions and provided an 
overview  of  the  most  and  least  targeted  skills.  Without 
clear  definitions  and  descriptions  of  how  games  address 
these  skills,  it  is  challenging  to  conclusively  assert  their 
improvement. The absence of a clear rationale for select-
ing these skills raises doubts about whether these interven-
tions prioritise the best interests of autistic people.

What views and beliefs informed the 
foundation of each study? Have the researchers 
named a specific psychological intervention 
approach?

These questions were asked to understand the motivations 
behind each study and the literature that informed it. There 
were  two  headings  that  our  sample  of  studies  could  fit 
under.

Studies that focused on knowledge of technology, and 
past  research  regarding  technological  interventions 
(Table 8).

Studies that focused on knowledge of autism, and past 
research on SST and autism (Table 9).

Many studies were based on past research regarding tech-
nology.  Utilising  technology  in  these  interventions  seems 
logical, given its well-researched benefits for autistic people.
For example, computer-aided learning (D. Moore et al., 
2000). In addition, autistic people often have a strong incli-
nation towards gaming, particularly video games (Clark & 
Adams, 2020; Kapp, 2012). However, the prevalent use of 
technology raises the question: Could the perceived advan-
tages  of  technology  have  overshadowed  the  need  for  a 
clearer definition of social skills in these studies?

Have  the  researchers  named  a  specific  autism-approach  in 
relation  to  the  intervention?.  Regarding  the  intervention 
approaches, some studies did not follow a specific approach 
(Jordan et al., 2013; Ke et al., 2022; Marchi et al., 2019). 
Two studies adhered to cognitive behavioural therapy prin-
ciples (Chung et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2014). Others fol-
lowed  pre-existing  frameworks  (Bernardini  et  al.,  2014; 
Ribeiro et al., 2014; Terlouw et al., 2021), while Guivarch 
et al. (2017) focused on the implicit modality (bottom-up). 
Additional  approaches  included  third-person  perspective 
training (Tsai et al., 2020), robots and behavioural training 
(Barakova  et  al.,  2009),  naturalistic  interventions  (Ke  & 
Moon, 2018), observational methods (Ioannou et al., 2020; 
MacCormack  &  Freeman,  2019;  Mairena  et  al.,  2019), 

models of learner-centred design (Parsons, 2015) and col-
laborative patterns (Silva et al., 2014).

Discussion

Our  synthesis  reveals  a  diverse  range  of  game-based 
approaches  for  teaching  social  skills  to  autistic  children 
and  youth.  These  approaches  vary  significantly  in  their 
design  and  objectives,  reflecting  different  strategies  for 
achieving SST outcomes. For instance, serious games like 
ECHOES emphasise individualised, family-centred inter-
ventions (Bernardini et al., 2014), while others incorporate 
cognitive behavioural therapy principles to enhance social 
interaction skills (Chung et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2014). 
This  diversity  underscores  the  importance  of  aligning 
game design with specific social skill objectives to ensure 
effectiveness. Social interaction level varied, from virtual 
character interactions (e.g. Bernardini et al., 2014) to real-
life engagements (e.g. Parsons, 2015), suggesting further 
research is needed to balance technological and real-world 
interactions for effective SST.

Our  review  shows  that  game-based  interventions  are 
generally  effective  in  improving  participant  performance 
on measures of social skills. For example, children recog-
nised  metaphors  presented  through  embodied  agents 
(Barakova et al., 2009), and a virtual reality environment 
improved negotiation, self-identity expression and cogni-
tive flexibility (Ke et al., 2022). However, there is a dis-
crepancy in the rigour of outcome measurement methods. 
To  effectively  evaluate  and  advance  these  interventions, 
comprehensive  outcome  measures,  including  pre-  and 
post-assessments, are crucial for determining their impact 
and refining future strategies.

Our synthesis reveals a lack of specificity in defining 
and justifying chosen skills. While social reciprocity was a 
common focus, many studies did not clearly explain why 
specific skills, such as collaboration or turn-taking, were 
selected (Mairena et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2014). Although 
some  studies  did  provide  clear  rationales  (e.g.  Terlouw 
et al., 2021), there was often ambiguity about the relevance 
of these skills to the autistic experience. For instance, tar-
geting eye contact might reflect neurotypical expectations 
rather than addressing autistic needs. The lack of a detailed 
rationale complicates the evaluation of these interventions’ 
effectiveness.

The foundations of studies were informed by two pri-
mary areas: knowledge of technology or understanding of 
autism. Many studies focused on the benefits of computer-
aided  learning,  raising  questions  about  whether  techno-
logical benefits overshadow the need for a clear definition 
of  social  skills.  The  approaches  varied  from  cognitive 
behavioural therapy principles (Chung et al., 2016; Silva 
et  al.,  2014)  to  frameworks  like  SCERTS  (Bernardini 
et al., 2014). The diversity in foundational beliefs and the 
lack  of  a  consistent  approach  highlights  the  need  for  a 

Walsh et al. 

339

framework that considers both technological benefits and 
the specific social skill needs of autistic people.

Finally,  our  review  highlights  several  shortcomings  of 
past  studies,  identifying  areas  for  improvement  and  future 
work. Several studies noted the necessity for further research 
to enhance generalisation (Chung et al., 2016; Ioannou et al., 
2020; Ke et  al., 2022; Mairena et  al., 2019). While virtual 
reality  (Ke  &  Moon,  2018)  and  virtual  agents  (Bernardini 
et al., 2014) show promise, future work should assess how 
well  skills  transfer  from  games  to  real-life  contexts.  Some 
games, for example, Giusti et al. (2011), necessitate collabo-
rative play for success. While in-game enforcement mecha-
nisms  ensure  adherence  to  rules,  such  structures  may  not 
exist outside of the gaming context. In game design, many 
studies missed opportunities to include autistic people’s per-
spectives on social skills, focusing instead on game mechan-
ics (e.g. Ke et al., 2022). We recommend including autistic 
youth and adults in collaborative research to adhere to the 
principle  of  ‘nothing  about  us  without  us’  (Poulsen  et  al., 
2022). Existing literature often defines social skills from a 
neurotypical perspective, risking stigmatisation and stereo-
typing. Inclusive research must prioritise autistic voices for a 
more accurate understanding of social skills.

This study contributes to the literature on game design 
for  SST  by  consolidating  empirical  studies  and  offering 
insights  into  various  approaches  and  their  successes. 
However, past research has left many gaps, for example, 
there are game like processes that have not been captured. 
As the literature largely focused on games designed for use 
in  a  therapeutic  setting,  school-based  games  may  have 
been missed. In addition, it is conceivable that innovative 
gaming technologies have yet to be explored.
