Abstract: Current evidence suggests that individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are likely to benefit from specialized, 
or  BPD-specific,  treatments.  Dialectical  behavior  therapy  (DBT)  and  mentalization-based  treatment  (MBT)  are  currently  the  most 
intensively researched BPD treatments. Reviewing the current research, this paper highlights similarities and differences between the 
two treatments, and discusses possible ways they could complement each other. As the effectiveness of specialized treatments for BPD 
in general has been determined with some certainty, research now tends towards individualized approaches, identifying predictors of 
optimal treatment response. However, it is still to be settled who might profit from a combination of or sequential treatment with DBT 
and MBT.

Introduction
Current evidence-based treatment guidelines consistently recommend psychotherapy as the first-line treatment of border-
line  personality  disorder  (BPD).1  Pharmacotherapy  has  been  studied  less  intensively  in  recent  years,2,3  after  enormous 
effort  had  been  spent  on  application  studies  that  resulted  in  disappointing  results.4,5  The  initial  therapeutic  nihilism, 
according to which people affected by BPD could neither benefit from nor maintain a steady attendance to psychotherapy 
over  a  longer  period,  emerged  from  very  early  observations  of  people  with  BPD  being  treated  with  classic  psycho-
analysis,  but  is  no  longer  tenable.6  Since  no  main  diagnostic  BPD  criterion  shared  by  all  people  diagnosed  with  BPD 
exists,  BPD  is  a  highly  heterogeneous  disorder.7  Instead,  any  five  or  more  out  of  nine  optional  criteria  must  be  met, 
resulting in 256 different combinations of diagnostic criteria. This heterogeneity might have contributed to the difficulties 
in developing BPD-tailored treatment approaches that meet the needs and challenges of both patients and therapists who 
undergo  an  oftentimes  intensive  treatment  together.  Nevertheless,  disorder-specific  approaches  are  available  today  that 
have been found to be effective in ameliorating symptoms of BPD and associated psychopathology.8

What Constitutes a Disorder-Specific Treatment Approach for BPD?
For  many  years,  several  different  psychotherapies  have  been  used  to  treat  BPD.  Disorder-specific  approaches  can  be 
delivered in individual or group format or as a combination of the two. Though disorder-specific, most of the available

treatments have emerged from the major psychotherapeutic schools such as psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy, 
cognitive-behavioral or humanistic therapy.

BPD-specific treatments adapt the therapeutic approach to the specific individual and the situation as recommended in 
person-centered therapy. In particular, they recognize a high risk of dropout from therapy because of the BPD-associated 
disturbances  in  relational  capacities,  distorted  perceptions,  and  interpretations  of  self  and  others,  as  well  as  previous 
traumatic relationship experiences and impulsive behavior tendencies.9  BPD-specific approaches, therefore, pay special 
attention to the ongoing maintenance of the therapeutic relationship. Therapists, in turn, often face challenging behaviors 
such  as  idealization  and  devaluation,  desperate  efforts  to  avoid  actual  or  feared  abandonment,  especially  at  the  end  of 
therapy, and repeated crisis-like developments. Most disorder-specific procedures, therefore, highlight the importance of 
supervision or  intervision for the therapists as  an integral  part of  treatment. Due  to the aforementioned challenges, the 
therapists should aim to establish a well-defined therapeutic relationship and setting which is reliable, appreciative, and 
sustainable. BPD treatments usually use treatment agreements and/or case formulations. Such tools are used to specify 
a  reliable  framework  for  both  sides,  within  which  constructive  therapeutic  cooperation  is  possible.10  In  most  BPD 
therapies, the therapists take an active stance, ie, they show their own involvement in the experience and reactions of the 
person  affected.  Depending  on  the  theoretical  basis  of  the  approaches,  the  techniques  have  different  names  and  are  of 
varying importance.

In a very insightful review,9 Weinberg et al systematically identified the following treatment elements that are used by 

BPD-tailored approaches (cf. to Table 1):

The  recent  Cochrane  review  on  psychotherapy  for  BPD,  which  comprehensively  and  systematically  analyzed 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) according to methodologically rigorous criteria, supports the superiority of disorder- 
specific approaches over nonspecific control treatments: Small to moderate statistically significant effects were found for 
BPD-specific interventions in general as compared to non-specific treatments, such as treatment as usual regarding BPD 
severity,  self-harm,  suicide-related  outcomes,  and  psychosocial  functioning.3  Given  the  crucial  importance  of  these 
outcomes,  specifically  regarding  self-harm  and  suicide-related  outcomes,  these  findings  support  the  use  of  disorder- 
specific  psychotherapies  in  BPD,  despite  the  small  to  moderate  effect  sizes  and  low  to  moderate  certainty  of  the 
evidence.3  The  evidence  was  rated  of  low  to  moderate  certainty  for  these  effects,  mainly  because  of  the  risk  of  bias, 
imprecision, and affiliation bias of investigators.3

Though  there  is  some  variation  regarding  the  availability  of  individual  treatments  in  different  countries,  the  most 
common  and  most  intensively  studied  treatments  for  BPD  are  dialectical-behavioral  therapy  (DBT),11  mentalization- 
based therapy (MBT),12  schema-focused therapy (SFT),13  transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP),14  cognitive analy-
tic therapy (CAT),15  and system training for emotional predictability and problem-solving (STEPPS).16

Stoffers-Winterling et al

In  the  following,  we  introduce  the  two  specialist  treatments  DBT  and  MBT.  Both  treatments  contain  underlying 
theoretical concepts and explicit manualization of techniques. As such, they have substantially influenced the field and 
advanced  our  understanding  of  BPD.  Both  have  stimulated  further  developments  for  patient  groups  with  defined 
comorbidities  and  are  probably  the  most  prevalent  treatments  in  clinical  practice.  We  will  note  similarities  and 
differences in  both  treatment  formulation  and  formats,  and  review  the  existing  effectiveness  data.  In  addition,  we  will 
highlight  results  from  RCTs  that  investigate  the  effectiveness  of  various  specific  components  or  significant  further 
developments  of  the  two  approaches.  Last,  we  will  discuss  the  perspective  of  combining  DBT and  MBT,  and  try  to 
determine who might profit from a combination or sequential treatment with DBT and MBT.

DBT and MBT: Two of a Kind?
Both methods traditionally make use of a treatment team, combine individual and group therapy, pursue explicit therapy 
goals that are based on a coherent theoretical base, and keep constant attention on therapy-interfering processes.

Further, both methods focus on current events and experiences in the here and now, use empathic validation, let the 
therapist take an active stance, dispense with the use of interpretations, and provide supportive inter- or intravision for the 
treatment team.17

The treatments, however, also differ in important ways. One major difference is the use of the therapeutic relationship. 
MBT explicitly  focuses  on  the  therapeutic  relationship  to  research  and  train  mentalizing  within  an  ongoing  interpersonal 
process. Instead, DBT rather uses the relationship to support skills coaching.17  MBT is usually conducted over 18-months, 
while standard DBT is conducted over 12-months. Moreover, MBT and DBT differ regarding their theoretical basis and the 
postulated “core” of BPD. MBT is primarily based on developmental psychopathology theory, with a focus on the self and 
affect regulation.12,18 Drawing from Bowlby’s attachment and the Theory of Mind theory, it is claimed that the sense of self 
and  others  is  built  on  the  infant’s  experience  of  the  caregiver’s  expressions.  If  no  secure  attachments  can  be  built,  the 
mentalizing  capacities  are  affected,  and  PD-related  difficulties  result  as  distinct  internalized  and  externalized  features. 
Mentalization, however, means the capacity to implicitly and explicitly make sense of subjective states and mental processes 
of oneself and others. Persons who have not developed healthy, secure attachment to their primary caregivers, are likely to 
develop an unstable sense of self, and problems in establishing sustainable, constructive social interactions characterized by 
epistemic trust, or considering diverse perspectives on how overt behavior or cognitive processes can be understood.17 MBT 
aims  to  support  the  patient’s  understanding  and  recognition  of  own  and  others’  feelings  and  thoughts  underlying  overt 
behaviors,  as  well  as  to  improve  emotion  regulation  capacity  and  the  ability  to  manage  impulsiveness.  The  therapeutic 
relationship is used to study and train mentalizing of interpersonal processes.

DBT,  on  the  other  hand,  as  a  cognitive-behavioral  therapy-informed  treatment,  conceptualizes  disturbed  affect 
regulation as the core problem in BPD, ie, a high emotional reactivity combined with a diminished ability to recognize 
one’s  feelings  and  to  deal  with  them  in  a  functional  way.  In  its  standard  version,  DBT  includes  the  four  components 
individual therapy, group skills training, telephone coaching in case of crisis and the therapist being part of a consultation 
team. DBT aims to change behavior and to enforce the ability to tolerate difficult or painful feelings through a focus on 
skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness skills.19  Furthermore, DBT 
builds on  a bio-social theory accounting  for  biological vulnerabilities along with  environmental adversities as  the core 
aetiologic  factors  that  contribute  to  the  development  of  BPD.  According  to  this,  temperamental  factors  (such  as 
a  heightened  emotional  sensitivity  to  external  stimuli,  intense  reactions,  and  slow  return  to  the  emotional  equilibrium) 
along with childhood adversities (such as emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, chronic invalidation, or neglect) promote 
a  pronounced  emotional  dysregulation.  Stress  tolerance  skills  are  used  to  help  individuals  manage  and  level  down 
emotional  distress,  instead  of  feeling  helpless  and  overwhelmed.  Vulnerabilities  and  sensitivities  are  met  with  non- 
judging acceptance and validation by the therapist, who at the same time aims to find a way to support the individual to 
“get  out  of  hell”.20  The  focus  on  dialectical  and  wholeness  is  also  important,  favoring  techniques  that  center  around 
acting and personal involvement in change on the one hand, but also acceptance on the other.

MBT group sessions have the character of group therapy in a traditional psychodynamic sense. All group members 
are  seated  in  a  circle  of  chairs,  and  if  somebody  is  missing,  an  empty  chair  is  used  to  indicate  this.  While  there  is  no 
teaching,  the  group  members  bring  up  incidents  that  have  occurred  since  the  last  meeting,  and  all  group  members  are

invited to “mentalize” around that incident, eg, discuss hypotheses about mental states of the persons involved. The main 
difference  between  DBT  and  MBT  regarding  group  sessions  might  be  that  DBT  explicitly  does  not  explore  group 
processes beyond using them  as an  opportunity  to practice skills,  whereas MBT encourages them  as  an opportunity to 
enhance mentalizing capacities.

In contrast, DBT group sessions are not called “therapy” but “skills training” to account for the fact that the sessions 
are  held  in  a  group  setting  but  in  a  seminar-like  atmosphere.  These  sessions  focus  on  the  introduction  of  skills  as 
specified  in  the  manual,  while  actual  skills  acquisition  is  meant  to  happen  between  the  group  sessions  when  each 
individual practices these skills and reports their use and effects on a diary card.

In  sum,  both  methods  focus  on  the  treatment  of  self-harm,  impulsiveness  and  emotional  dysregulation.  DBT, 
however,  intends  to  directly  modify  and  prevent  such  behavior  by  skills  use.  MBT  intends  to  enhance  mentalizing 
capacities  in  order  to  make  the  inner  and  outer  world  understandable  to  the  client,  so  that  escalating  behavior  is 
prevented.  These  differences  can  best  be  understood  by  the  fact  that  MBT  is  a  psychodynamically  rooted  therapy 
(thus focusing more on the attachment relationships and psychodynamic processes), whereas DBT mainly is a behavior 
therapy (thus mainly focusing on changing problematic behaviors).

Evidence on DBT
The most comprehensive evidence is currently available on DBT. About one-third of all available RCTs on psychother-
apeutic  interventions  for  BPD  focus  on  DBT  or  DBT  adaptations  for  specific  patient  groups.3  Table  2  provides  an 
overview of currently available RCTs comparing DBT and DBT adaptations with a non-specific control condition such as 
treatment as usual (TAU).

In  the  Cochrane  review  of  Psychotherapy for  BPD, significant  effects  emerge for  the  comparison  of  standard DBT 
(including the four components individual therapy, group skills training, telephone coaching in case of crisis if needed,

and the therapist being part of a consultation team) with nonspecific control groups such as TAU. Statistically significant 
effects are observed regarding BPD severity, psychosocial functioning, and individual BPD symptom expressions (self- 
injurious behavior, anger/rage, dissociations)3  (cf. Table 3).

DBT is  usually  delivered  in  an  outpatient  setting.  In  an  RCT comparing  a  combination  of  inpatient  and  outpatient 
DBT with the usual 12-month outpatient DBT, no differences in efficacy were found.38  DBT skills training is typically 
delivered concurrently with individual DBT. The pooled effects from multiple studies of DBT skills training alone show 
that participants may benefit in terms of overall BPD severity, specific BPD symptom expressions (affective instability, 
impulsivity, anger/rage), and social functioning levels.31–33 These findings support the beneficial effects of skills training 
groups.31–33,39 In a dismantling trial, which compared the individual treatment modules of DBT individual therapy, DBT 
skills training, and standard combined treatment, Linehan et al also confirmed the positive effect of group training: The 
two  groups  that  participated  in  skills  training  had  larger  and  faster  benefits  concerning  self-injurious  behavior  and 
depressive symptoms.40 However, more randomized comparisons of skills-groups alone to standard DBT are lacking, and 
long-term  effects  of  group-only  treatments  in  general  are  uncertain.39  Therefore,  the  findings  support  the  use  of  skills 
groups, but do not allow for concluding that these could replace individual or combined treatment.

In  addition  to  standard  DBT,  adaptations  for  individuals  with  BPD  plus  comorbid  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD) are now available. Two studies demonstrate that even in the presence of BPD, PTSD can be treated safely and 
effectively,  and  that  individuals  affected  by  both  diagnoses  can  benefit  more  from  trauma-adapted  DBT  than  from 
standard DBT or standard trauma treatment.34,35,41

An  adapted  version  of  DBT  was  found  to  have  beneficial  effects  on  BPD  severity,  suicidality,  self-injury,  and 
depression in adolescents with significant BPD symptoms in two RCTs.36,37  A DBT adaptation is now also available 
for  relatives  of  affected  individuals  (of  all  ages;  DBT  Family  Connections,  DBT-FC).42  Initial  studies  indicate 
positive  effects  in  terms  of  distress,  grief,  and  family  functioning.43,44  In  a  non-randomized  comparison  of  DBT- 
FC,  no  differences  in  effectiveness  were  observed  if  DBT-FC  was  delivered  face-to-face  or  in  an  online  format.45

Evidence on MBT
Besides DBT, MBT is the psychotherapy for which the most RCTs are currently available (cf. Table 4). In the Cochrane 
review  of  psychotherapies  for  BPD,  a  difference  in  effects  was  seen  in  terms  of  a  greater  reduction  of  self-injurious, 
suicidal behavior, and interpersonal problems by MBT as compared to unspecific control treatments (cf. Table 3).3

One  trial  investigated  the  efficacy  of  an  intensive  two-year  MBT  intervention,  which  included  both  group  and 
individual  therapy.48  This  intervention  was  compared  with  two  years  of  less  intensive  (biweekly)  supportive  group 
therapy.  There were no significant  differences in outcome between the two  treatments, but the authors found that both 
treatments  showed  large  changes  from  baseline.48  Another  trial  investigated  the  difference  between  two  versions  of 
MBT: day-hospital MBT and intensive out-patient MBT.55 This trial found that there were no differences between groups 
on  the  primary  outcome,  but  the  day-hospital  version  of  MBT  showed  a  tendency  for  superiority  on  the  secondary 
outcomes.55  In a three-year follow-up study, there were no differences between the day-hospital version of MBT or the 
more intensive out-patient MBT. Both groups, however, showed large improvements from baseline.57

A  trial  of  MBT  for  individuals  with  BPD  and  comorbid  addiction  found  no  effects  on  addiction  symptoms  as 
compared  to  standard  substance  use  disorder  treatment.50  An  adaptation  for  people  with  BPD  and  comorbid  eating 
disorders was investigated in the MBT-ED trial, which similarly to the trial on comorbid addiction, found very limited 
effects on eating disorder symptomatology.51

Two  RCTs,  each  examining  the  effects  of  MBT  group  treatment  in  adolescents  with  BPD  or  pronounced  BPD 
features, found no evidence of MBT superiority as compared to treatment as usual.53,54  The evidence is summarized in 
a  systematic  review  that  showed  limited  evidence  on  the  effect  of  MBT  on  adolescents  when  compared  to  control

interventions.58  Another RCT compared individual MBT treatment in adolescents to TAU and concluded that it may be 
effective in reducing self-harm and depression.52

Encouraging effects were observed in an RCT of an MBT-based program for significant others, the MBT-FACTS 
trial, where the intervention was delivered by peers (relatives who were also affected).59  Participation resulted in less 
family  conflict,  improved  well-being,  and  better  family  functioning  levels  compared  to  a  waitlist  control  group.

Comparing Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Mentalization-Based Treatment
Research on psychotherapy for BPD and specifically DBT and MBT has made great progress over the past decade. More 
than one-third of all available RCTs have been published in the last five years. However, a direct randomized comparison 
of DBT and MBT has not yet been conducted. Even an indirect comparison of treatment effects is difficult, given that 
DBT and  MBT research  traditionally  focus  on  different  outcomes:  While  DBT  traditionally  targets  impulsivity-related 
behaviors  (including  self-harm  and  suicidal  behavior)  as  well  as  inappropriate  anger,  MBT  research  rather  takes  an 
interest  in  the  effects  on  interpersonal  outcomes  and  non-BPD-specific  psychopathology  such  as  depression  or  as 
expressed by composite scores like the Symptom Checklist-90-R (in −90-R) scale.3,60

In a subgroup analysis, Storebø et al found that the intervention effect did not vary between subgroups of MBT and 
DBT  when  compared  to  unspecific  controls  for  BPD  severity  or  psychosocial  functioning.3  Taking  into  account  the 
findings supporting the superiority of each of the two treatments to unspecific controls, this means both can be regarded 
effective regarding these two outcomes.

Recently, the results of a naturalistic, non-randomized controlled study carried out in the personality disorder services 
in the UK were published. No differences in intervention effects were observed between DBT and MBT after 12 months 
of treatment – for neither of the outcomes self-harm, BPD severity, emotional dysregulation, interpersonal relationships, 
or dissociation.61 There was, however, a steeper decline in self-harm and emotion dysregulation in the DBT group, which 
remained significant after adjustment for potentially confounding variables. There is some evidence indicating that DBT 
and MBT share some common helpful therapeutic processes. A mixed-methods re-analysis of the previously mentioned 
non-randomized  comparison  of  DBT  and  MBT61  found  that  patients’  accounts  of  learning  not  to  react  impulsively, 
questioning one’s thoughts and assumptions, communicating more effectively, and exposing oneself to painful emotions 
were associated with less self-harm at the end of treatment across both therapies.62  Also, difficulties in the therapeutic 
relationship or with group members were associated with more severe BPD severity and emotion dysregulation at end of 
treatment for both MBT and DBT.61,62

Discussion
Though  there  are  some  differences  in  duration,  frequency,  and  intensity  between  DBT  and  MBT,  they  share  many 
similarities as well: They are both relatively complex interventions that usually combine individual and group treatment 
and  are  both  delivered  by  a  team  of  therapists  in  an  outpatient  setting.  They  aim  to  ameliorate  impulsive  behavior, 
including self-harm, and emotion dysregulation. To all intents and purposes, are DBT and MBT essentially just one and 
the same, achieving the same treatment goals, but using different techniques and wording?

Rather than using them interchangeably at random, it has been suggested to be attentive to the clinical characteristics 
of  an  individual;  ie,  which  symptoms,  and  which  severity.  DBT is  usually  regarded  the  first-line  treatment  when  it  is 
necessary to address destructive behaviour.63 If frequent crises occur, reflective functions are impaired, and treatment will 
be  interrupted  repeatedly.  However,  once  stress  tolerance  has  increased  by  DBT  treatment,  and  overt  treatment- 
interfering  behavioral  problems  have  remitted,  emotions  come  into  the  focus  of  treatment.  Though  mentalizing  can 
already be found in many aspects of DBT (eg, “beginner’s mind”, non-judging validation, chain analysis), DBT might 
profit from the integration of techniques that are described in detail in the MBT manual, eg, to work towards a flexible 
mindset even in emotionally demanding situation.63 Both treatments seem complimentary here, as high emotional arousal 
disrupts  adaptive mentalizing, whereas adaptive mentalization  facilitates emotion regulation.63  Though both treatments 
pay constant attention to the therapeutic relationship, and DBT covers interpersonal effectiveness, MBT includes more 
detailed micro-tools to address and make use of relational disturbances as they occur.17  Once a stable level of minimum

psychosocial functioning is achieved, it has been suggested to use General Psychiatric Management for long-term, low- 
frequency maintenance.20

In sum, DBT may either be followed or augmented by MBT, depending on the current clinical picture and severity of 
symptoms.  At  this  point,  it  is  mostly  agreed  upon  from  clinical  expertise  that  a  person  with  BPD  and  externalizing 
pathology  and/or  self-harm,  self-destructive  behaviors  might  better  benefit  from  DBT,  followed  by  MBT to  gain  more 
insight  into  relational  difficulties  and  attachment  patterns.  However,  a  coherent  case  formulation  including  individual 
treatment  goals  and  a  transparent  treatment  structure  are  a  prerequisite  before  borrowing  interventions  and  techniques 
from MBT (or any other BPD-specific treatment).

Currently,  there  is  very  little  research  available  on  the  systematic  combination  of  DBT and  MBT elements.  To 
our  knowledge,  only  a  single,  non-randomized  study  comparing  the  effects  of  DBT alone  to  DBT  plus  MBT  in  an 
inpatient  sample  exists.64  The  only  difference  in  effect  between  groups  was  found  for  the  outcome  of  affective 
mentalizing,  which  was  higher  in  the  combined  group.  Since  the  enhancement  of  mentalizing  capacities  is  an 
explicit treatment goal in MBT but not DBT, this finding is not surprising — on the contrary, one would not expect 
an  increase  in  the  outcome  “skills-use”  in  persons  who  solely  received  MBT.  More  systematic  research  is  needed 
that  investigates  the  effects  of  the  combination  of  DBT  and  MBT,  or  enhancement  of  standard  DBT  and  standard 
MBT by adding elements of the alternate therapy, depending on the individual phenomenology and treatment goals. 
Importantly,  the  effects  on  direct,  clinical  outcomes  like  general  functioning  and  overall  BPD  severity,  that  are  of 
interest  to  people  with  BPD  must  be  assessed,  rather  than  the  ability  to  use  acquired  techniques  which  are  only 
vehicles  to  achieve  beneficial  effects.

Because resources are limited, not all individuals with a diagnosis of BPD need (and have the opportunity) to undergo 
specialized  treatment  by  interventions  such  as  DBT or  MBT.  As  a  first  step,  individuals  with  BPD  might  profit  from 
General  Psychiatry  Management  as  suggested  by  Gunderson.65  More  severe  pathology  might  require  specialized 
treatment such as DBT or MBT. In severe, persistent cases, sequential treatment with first DBT targeting acute, impulsive 
behavior, followed by MBT targeting persistent interpersonal difficulties might be indicated.66

In practice, resources are limited, and too many individuals are waiting for any kind of specialist treatment. Therefore, 
and  given  the  expensive  and  time-consuming  training  that  is  needed  to  become  a  DBT  or  MBT  therapist,  it  seems 
illusionary that therapists would be trained in both treatments, let alone other specialist treatments. Even in an ideal world 
with unlimited access to specialized therapies, it would be too costly and, again, time-consuming to let people undergo 
full courses of both treatments sequentially. However, it might be a first step to integrate a look beyond the own nose in 
DBT and MBT trainings, ie, let trainees learn some basic information about the alternate therapy, and how it might be 
used to augment treatment. However, a coherent case formulation and treatment plan is obligatory to reasonably integrate 
techniques of other treatments.

However,  it  is  still  unclear  which  characteristics  predict  an  optimal  response  to  a  certain  treatment.  Building  on 
the  current  findings  that  individuals  with  a  diagnosis  of  BPD  are  likely  to  profit  from  specialized  BPD  treatments, 
future  research  should  focus  on  the  question  of  individualized  treatments  in  order  to  increase  moderate  treatment 
gains.  Specifically,  more  research  is  needed  to  understand  who  benefits  optimally  from  which  treatment.  This  is 
important to avoid frustrating treatment experiences for the individual, as it is likely to foster therapeutic pessimism 
and adverse outcomes,  especially in affected youth. Also,  available therapeutic  resources must  be allocated in a  fair 
and economic way, taking into account the individual’s needs, in order to ameliorate both access to and effectiveness 
of  mental  health  care  as  stepped  care  approaches  suggest.67,68  This  would  help  to  reduce  costs  for  individuals  and 
health-care  systems  (both  financial  and  time),  and  save  treatment  resources  for  individuals  who  might  optimally 
profit.

Since the upcoming ICD-1169 will take a dimensional approach of diagnosing PDs in terms of dominating personality 
traits  and  abolish  the  existent  categorical  PDs  (except  from  the  newly  introduced  “borderline  pattern”,  6D11.5  that 
reflects BPD as defined in the DSM-5), it will be even more important to individualize case formulations, treatments and 
techniques  with  respect  to  the  individual  clinical  picture  and  treatment  goals.  Moreover,  the  newly  introduced  ICD-11 
categories  of  mild,  moderate  and  severe  personality  disorder  (6D10.0  to  6D10.2)  might  be  considered  in  terms  of 
treatment intensity and duration. This would be in line with the suggested sequential proceeding, where impulsiveness-

important  to  conduct  research  into  the  question  what  benefits  each  therapy  brings,  and  benefits  more  from  one  or  the 
other approach. In our Cochrane review on psychological therapies for people with borderline personality disorder3  we

which  treatment.  An  individual  patient  data  meta-analysis  of  the  available  evidence  is  currently  underway  to  find  out 
which treatments are likely to work in which individuals.70
