Around the world, an estimated 166 million boys and girls
aged 10 to 19 years met the criteria for a mental health
disorder in 2019. That same year, suicide was among the
top ﬁve causes of death among 15- to 19-year-olds in 8 of
the 9 United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) regions,
including Latin America and the Caribbean. If these facts
are not necessarily new to many clinicians, researchers,
and policy makers, the extra push needed to catalyze
change may have ﬁnally come from UNICEF’s State of
the World’s Children (SoWC) 2021 report.1 Although pub-
lished continuously since 1980, focusing on key issues
that affect children worldwide, this is the ﬁrst time that the
SoWC has been dedicated to mental health, addressing it
as a central theme for discussion and action, bringing the
mental health of the world’s children into view, and thus
into our minds.

Context is a key element in the contribution provided
by SoWC 2021. By integrating mental health into various
settings – including, but not limited to, culture, geography,
income, healthcare, communities, schools, families, race,
sex, digital – the report highlights the need for multi-
dimensional and multidisciplinary initiatives and interven-
tions to promote and maintain mental health and resolve
risk factors for mental
illnesses, such as unsupported
parenting, deﬁcient education, poor nutrition, poverty,
discrimination, climate change, and humanitarian crises.
In another essential context,
the perception of young
people, the preliminary results of qualitative data that
UNICEF obtained1 from focus groups of individuals aged
10 to 19 years in several countries highlight their willing-
ness to seek mental health support, the importance of
talking about mental health issues, and the need to add-
ress stigma and misunderstandings. These qualitative
ﬁndings, supported by a Gallup poll performed for UNICEF
as part of the Changing Childhood project,2 appear in stark
contrast to the scant knowledge in many countries regard-
ing the availability and/or format of youth mental health
support, as shown by a review of data from the WHO
Mental Health in Development (MIND) project (https://
www.mindbank.info/). Also striking is the persistent data

gap, which, as pointed out a decade earlier,3 complicates
the design of services and interventions.

To spark action, the SoWC 2021 describes a frame-
work with three straightforward steps to promote, protect,
and care for the mental health of children and adoles-
cents: Commit (scale up investment), Communicate (add-
ress stigma and give voice to young people and those
with lived experience of mental disorders), and Act (pre-
pare and support parents,
families, and caregivers,
schools, healthcare systems and workforces, and, impor-
tantly, improve data and research).

If the scaling up of investment might raise skepticism
in the COVID-19 era, the report also highlights the link
between mental well-being and initiatives to minimize risk
and maximize protective factors in broader areas, such
as the family and school; existing programs might be
strengthened by recognizing their role in protecting the
mental health of children and adolescents. As one
the report highlights cash transfer schemes
example,
(such as Bolsa Famı´lia or Auxı´lio Brasil) for having
reduced both intimate partner violence (positively impact-
ing cognitive and behavioral development
in younger
children) and suicide (with Indonesia and Brazil cited as
examples). Other existing programs may also provide a
unique opportunity for mental health screening, such as
immunization campaigns (in which both young people and
adults actively seek the healthcare system) and prenatal
care (considering the well-recognized role of women in
securing the mental well-being of their children).

In Brazil, much of UNICEF’s Act component might proﬁt
from existing infrastructure and effective training and
communication about the nature of mental health,4 as we
propose in Box 1. This is not to say that the solution is
simple: direct investment is still badly needed, among
other aspects, to account for the higher cost of mental
health care. Data from the cities of Sa˜o Paulo and Porto
Alegre show that the families of children aged 6-14 who
have a mental health condition spend twice as much on
health and social services as families with children who do
not have one. Another a major challenge in Brazil is the
difﬁ-

Box 1 A proposed framework for action: ﬁve fronts to secure the mental wellbeing of children and adolescents (adapted from
Buchweitz et al.4)

1. Integrate mental and general health

- Use existing opportunities for screening: prenatal care and immunization campaigns
- Use existing opportunities to collect data: add relevant mental health components to population- and school-based

surveys from diverse sectors

- Implement relevant mental health indicators to evaluate health services in general and outline mental health-relevant

treatment and care goals

- Integrate mental health data into electronic health records and referral systems

2. Enhance the workforce

- Review health curricula to include mental health components
- Train and support primary care workers using a variety of strategies, including telemedicine
- Train lay workers to provide mental health support in the community and improve access to specialized services as needed

3. Broaden research

- Create evidence observatories
- Foster international partnerships
- Conduct high quality clinical trials for local populations, focusing on psychosocial or combined interventions

4. Strengthen participation

- Mobilize media, schools, communities, and families to actively participate in initiatives to ﬁght stigma
- Disseminate information on how to access services and opportunities to contribute to policies and the legal framework
- Promote collaboration among different organizations to reﬂect and act on shared advocacy goals
- Engage youth in research and policy evaluation and planning

5. Think digital

- Map available systems that can be used for mental health care
- Research and develop context-sensitive digital strategies

culty transitioning into the workforce, with 27% of youth
aged 18-24 years currently not in employment, education,
or training (NEET),5 which also has a recognized link to
poor mental health outcomes.

information about

In terms of data and research, as shown in SoWC
2021, epidemiology can guide the identiﬁcation of vulner-
able populations: just as knowledge on the prevalence of
mental disorders is relevant for organizing services and
providing care,
risk and protective
factors can support initiatives to prevent the onset and
reduce the chronicity of mental health problems. In that
sense, one action point to consider is including aspects of
mental health in standardized worldwide surveys such as
Demographic and Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys, and the Global School-based Student
Health Survey. In addition, research can connect young
people to policy makers and other stakeholders to help us
understand the best ways of approaching and empower-
ing them, securing their mental wellbeing in each speciﬁc
setting.

As we look ahead, it is essential to keep the entire
continuum of mental health in mind, including the iden-
tiﬁcation and treatment of disorders as well as the pre-
vention and maintenance of wellbeing, thus bringing into
the picture the contextual risk and protective factors that
can make a difference for children and adolescents, as is
already done for areas such as cardiovascular disease
and cancer. There are still many uncertainties about the
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the fact
that a major, comprehensive report has now focused
on the state of child and adolescent mental health is a

positive turn that should encourage action to impact the
present as well as future generations.
