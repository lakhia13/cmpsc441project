Abstract
Background Psychological processes can be manifested in physiological health. We investigated whether acceptance and com-
mitment therapy (ACT), targeted on psychological flexibility (PF), influences inflammation and stress biomarkers among
working-age adults with psychological distress and overweight/obesity.
Method Participants were randomized into three parallel groups: (1) ACT-based face-to-face (n = 65; six group sessions led by a
psychologist), (2) ACT-based mobile (n = 73; one group session and mobile app), and (3) control (n = 66; only the measure-
ments). Systemic inflammation and stress markers were analyzed at baseline, at 10 weeks after the baseline (post-intervention),
and at 36 weeks after the baseline (follow-up). General PF and weight-related PF were measured with questionnaires (Acceptance
and Action Questionnaire, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire for Weight-Related Difficulties).
Results A group × time interaction (p = .012) was detected in the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level but not in
other inflammation and stress biomarkers. hsCRP decreased significantly in the face-to-face group from week 0 to week 36, and
at week 36, hsCRP was lower among the participants in the face-to-face group than in the mobile group (p = .035, post hoc test).
Age and sex were stronger predictors of biomarker levels at follow-up than the post-intervention PF.
Conclusion The results suggest that ACT delivered in group sessions may exert beneficial effects on low-grade systemic
inflammation. More research is needed on how to best apply psychological interventions for the health of both mind and body
among people with overweight/obesity and psychological distress.

Introduction

Chronic low-grade systemic inflammation is a minor activa-
tion of the inflammatory system, without actual infection or
tissue injury [1], which is present in several metabolic dys-
functional states such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardio-
vascular disease [2, 3]. In low-grade systemic inflammation,
the circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and
interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) are increased
whereas the levels of anti-inflammatory markers, such as
adiponectin, are decreased [4]. Elevated high-sensitivity C-
reactive protein (hsCRP) and IL-1Ra levels and low
adiponectin levels predict a persistence of the metabolic syn-
drome [5]. A chronic low-grade systemic inflammation also
often co-occurs with a chronic stress response [6].

Stress is a complex concept with no uniform definition [7].
The response to a stressful situation is usually both psycho-
logical and physiological [8, 9]. The physiological stress re-
sponse, i.e., the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adre-
nocortical (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system [10],
leads to altered secretion of cortisol and dehydroepiandroster-
one sulfate (DHEAS) [11, 12]. Cortisol and DHEAS are
markers of HPA axis activation [12] and, thus in this study,
are exploited as markers of either acute or chronic stress reac-
tions [11–14]. Altered cortisol secretion is associated with, for
example, immune and inflammatory outcomes, obesity, can-
cer, and increased risk for mortality [15]. DHEAS is known to
counteract several of the effects of cortisol and to, for exam-
ple, attenuate inflammatory process and reduce mortality [12,
16, 17]. Allostatic load is a holistic concept of how chronic
stress can lead to negative health outcomes [18, 19]. Markers
of inflammation and HPA axis activity are suggested to medi-
ate the effects of chronic stress underpinning disturbed health
[14, 20, 21]. Thus, finding ways to improve the circulating
levels of the inflammatory and stress biomarkers would be one
approach to improving long-term health.

In addition to chronic stress, also obesity and lifestyle factors
such as diet and physical activity are related to low-grade systemic
inflammation [22]. Adipose tissue is a major source of stress-
related pro-inflammatory markers [22]. Conversely, a diet consis-
tent with nutrition recommendations, such as a healthy Nordic diet,
is associated with better inflammatory status [23, 24].

Obesity, psychosocial distress, a diet not following nutri-
tional recommendations, and a sedentary lifestyle are major
health challenges in our modern society. For an individual,
these challenges are difficult to overcome—it is not easy to
make long-term lifestyle changes. For example, the majority
of individuals tend to regain weight after weight loss [25].
Often, these difficulties arise from our problematic inner ex-
periences and psychological processes. For example, individ-
uals who gain weight after they have lost weight tend to es-
cape or avoid their problems [26] and adopt an inflexible,
dichotomous thinking style [27, 28]. Psychological

Int.J. Behav. Med. (2020) 27:539–555

inflexibility means that the person is not able to change or
maintain a behavior which would lead to personally valued
outcomes and is not able to fully contact the present moment
[29]. The non-adaptive psychological processes, such as psy-
chological inflexibility [29], are thought to underlie a wide
variety of forms of human suffering [30], irrespective of diag-
noses [31]. Psychological inflexibility is also associated with
higher uncontrolled and emotional eating [32] which are fea-
tures of eating behavior associated with poorer dietary choices
and higher BMI [33–35]. Thus, increasing psychological flex-
ibility, i.e., the ability to contact the present moment and to
change or persist in behavior according to personal values
[29], could be one possible way to promote an individual’s
health and well-being.

One of the so-called process-based therapies aimed at im-
proving psychological flexibility in general is acceptance and
commitment therapy (ACT) [36]. ACT seeks to increase psy-
chological flexibility and consists of six interrelated core pro-
cesses: (1) clarification of own values, (2) commitment to act
based on those values, (3) being in contact with the present
moment (i.e., mindfulness), (4) having self as context (i.e.,
being aware of thoughts, feelings, etc., without attaching to
them), (5) defusion (i.e., altering the way to interact with or
relate to thoughts, feelings, etc.), and (6) acceptance [29].

Previous studies have investigated the effects of ACT or
value clarification interventions on the cortisol response in
individuals performing an experimental psychosocial stress
test [37, 38]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no pre-
vious studies about the effectiveness of an ACT intervention
on inflammation and stress biomarkers in real-world non-clin-
ical, randomized controlled settings. However, interventions
based on one part of ACT, namely mindfulness, have shown
positive effects on some inflammation and stress biomarkers
such as hsCRP [39, 40] and cortisol [41]. However, the re-
views of mindfulness-based randomized controlled interven-
tions have concluded that the effects on circulating inflamma-
tion markers [42–44] and cortisol [44] are contradictory, and
warrant further research.

In summary, based on the literature, it can be hypothesized
that problems in psychological processes (i.e., psychological
inflexibility) are closely related to behavior (e.g., poor diet and
sedentary lifestyle leading to obesity) and subjective psycho-
social distress. All these factors are linked to chronic low-
grade systemic inflammation and a chronic physiological
stress response. These physiological processes, in turn, are a
risk of future ill health and major chronic diseases. The aim of
this study was to investigate how the effects of an ACT inter-
vention, targeting psychological inflexibility, can alter inflam-
mation and stress biomarkers among adults with psychologi-
cal distress and overweight. In addition, because the psycho-
logical and physiological factors are intertwined, we conduct-
ed post hoc, exploratory analyses to explore how psycholog-
ical flexibility (general or weight-related) and the biomarkers

are clustered within this study population or whether they
cluster more strongly with other psychological, anthropomet-
ric, or lifestyle (diet, physical activity) measures.

The sample size of the current study is based on the power
calculation (for depression symptoms) of the randomized con-
trolled trial [45], resulting in a sample size of n = 80–85 per
group.

Methods

Study Design

The present study is a secondary analysis of a parallel-arm ran-
domized controlled trial, in which three different psychological
interventions were studied and compared to a non-treatment con-
trol group [45]. The randomization process and CONSORT flow
chart have been published previously [45]. The present study
investigates the effects of the two ACT-based intervention arms
compared to control.

The study participants were recruited by advertisements in
local newspapers and screened for eligibility via telephone
inquiry and an online questionnaire from August 2012 until
January 2013. The participants had to be 25–60 years old and
have a self-reported body mass index (BMI) of 27–34.9 kg/
m2. This range for self-reported BMI was used because we
aimed to have participants with overweight and obesity and
anticipated that the range of laboratory-measured BMI would
be most likely wider. The participants also had to be psycho-
logically distressed (≥ 3/12 points from the General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ-12) [46]) and have computer and
Internet access. There were several exclusion criteria, such
as diagnosed severe chronic illness (including symptomatic
cardiovascular disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes, kidney disease
requiring dialysis, and eating disorder), disabilities/illnesses
substantially affecting physiological or mental health, medical
surgery within the past 6 months, heart attack or stroke within
the past 6 months, pacemaker, regular oral cortisone medica-
tion, pregnancy or breastfeeding within the past 6 months,
psychotherapy or other psychological or mental treatments at
least twice a month, disability pension for psychological rea-
sons, and participation in some other intervention trial during
the present study. An additional exclusion criterion for the
present analyses was a hsCRP value > 10 mg/L indicating
acute infection or inflammation [47]. The study was conduct-
ed in three cities in Finland (Jyväskylä, Kuopio, and Helsinki),
and the recruitment was conducted in two phases. The partic-
ipants in the first phase started in autumn, and the second
phase started in spring. The participants filled in electronic
questionnaires, visited the local study center for clinical and
biochemical measurements, and reported their food consump-
tion in a 48-h dietary recall by telephone. Measurements were
conducted before the intervention (baseline, study week 0),
after the 8-week intensive intervention period (post-interven-
tion, study week 10), and 36 weeks after baseline measure-
ments (follow-up, study week 36). The measurements were
collected from August 2012 until December 2013.

Study Groups

The face-to-face and mobile interventions were based on the
same ACT program constructed by the same research group.
Thus, only the delivery method of the intervention differed. The
two interventions included the following main components:
value clarification, acting according to one’s own values, mind-
fulness skills, the observing self (e.g., observing thoughts with-
out being caught up in them), and acceptance skills (e.g., mak-
ing room for unpleasant feelings and urges, allowing them to
come and go). The main focus was on ACT skills, but minor
parts of mindful eating, relaxation, and everyday physical ac-
tivity were also included. However, the intervention did not
include nutrition education. Only a hyperlink to a public nutri-
tional website was provided to the participants in the interven-
tion groups, which was to be utilized if the dietary changes were
according to one’s own values. Lappalainen et al. [45] for a
more detailed description of the intervention.

The face-to-face group had six group sessions led by a psy-
chologist during the 8-week intervention period. Each session
took approximately 90 min, and each group consisted of 6–12
participants. The sessions included exercises, pair and group
discussions, and homework for which the participants received
a workbook. The treatment adherence has been described pre-
viously and was found to be good [48]. On average, the partic-
ipants attended five group sessions (SD = 1).

The mobile group had one group session in which partici-
pants learned about the principles of ACT and received
smartphones with the pre-installed Oiva mobile app [49].
The Oiva app contains 46 exercises in text and audio formats
and introductory videos about the ACT skills. The user expe-
rience results of the app were positive [49]. The participants
were free to choose exercises and videos in any order and to
do them as many times as the participants wanted during the
8-week intervention period. The participants returned the
smartphones during the post-intervention laboratory study vis-
it. The participants’ usage of the mobile app has been reported
in detail previously [50]. Briefly, among the study population
of the present analyses, the median total duration of the mobile
app use was 280 min (interquartile range 198–423, total range
52–2001).

Participants randomized to the control group took part in all
of the measurements but did not receive any intervention.
After the follow-up measurements, the participants in the con-
trol group had an opportunity to attend one group session in
which the principles of ACT were presented and they were
told that they could utilize an Internet-based lifestyle coaching
program [45].

Measures

Inflammation and Stress Biomarkers

An antecubital venous blood sample was taken after a 12-h
overnight fast in the study laboratory between 7 and 10 a.m.
The plasma samples were collected into EDTA tubes and cen-
trifuged as soon as possible. The serum samples were centri-
fuged after the blood had clotted. The samples were stored at
− 80 °C until analyzed.

Inflammation markers known to be associated with metabol-
ic syndrome (MetS) components (i.e., high hsCRP and IL-1Ra
levels and low adiponectin level) [51] were analyzed. Plasma
hsCRP concentration was determined with a photometric
immunoturbidimetric method (Konelab; Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Vantaa, Finland), with a measurement range from
0.1 to 10 mg/L, and extended range using automatic dilution
from 0.1 to 40 mg/L. The level of plasma IL-1Ra was measured
with an enzyme immunoassay (Quantikine® ELISA Kits; R&D
Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) with a measurement range
from 31.2 to 2000 pg/mL. Serum high molecular weight
(HMW) adiponectin was measured with enzyme immunoassay
(Quantikine® ELISA for Human HMW Adiponectin/Acrp
Immunoassay; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) with
a measurement range from 0.39 to 25 μg/mL.

Plasma total cortisol concentrations were measured with
chemiluminescent immunoassay (LIAISON® Cortisol;
DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) with a quantitation limit of
4.1 nmol/L and a dilution threshold of 2208 nmol/L. Plasma
DHEAS was determined with chemiluminescent immunoas-
say (LIAISON® DHEA-S; DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) with a
quantitation limit of 0.027 μmol/L and a dilution threshold of
20.3 μmol/L. The cortisol/DHEAS ratio was used as a more
sensitive index of the HPA axis activation [12] and the
catabolic/anabolic balance [14, 52] under stress conditions.
The cortisol/DHEAS ratio was calculated by dividing the
raw value of cortisol (ng/mL) by the raw value of DHEAS
(ng/mL) [52]. The ratio between cortisol and DHEAS, i.e., the
balance of these catabolic and anabolic stress hormones, is
suggested to be more informative of psychiatric and general
health status than either of the hormone levels alone [14].
Although the DHEAS concentration increases as a part of an
acute stress response [14], its levels decline during chronic
stress conditions [12, 14]. DHEAS has been related to several
positive health effects [17] and has been shown to counteract
several of cortisol’s effects [12, 16]. Thus, a higher cortisol/
DHEAS ratio is proposed to indicate higher chronic stress and
to contribute to ill health [14].

Anthropometric Measurements

Weight and height were measured with calibrated instruments

fast. BMI was calculated as kilograms per meters squared.
Waist circumference was measured halfway between the low-
est rib and the iliac crest. Body composition (% of body fat) is
based on multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis
using an In-Body 720 device (Mega Electronics, Kuopio,
Finland) or Tanita BC-418 MA device (Tanita, Japan).

Psychological Flexibility

Psychological flexibility was measured with two question-
naires. The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II)
[53] measures general psychological flexibility. The 7 items
(e.g., “I worry about not being able to control my worries and
feelings”) are answered with 7-point Likert scale from “never
true” (1) to “always true” (7). The possible score range is 7–49
with a lower score reflecting more psychological flexibility.
Cronbach’s alpha was 0.91.

The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire for Weight-
Related Difficulties (AAQW) [54] measures weight-related
psychological flexibility. The 22 items (e.g., “I try hard to avoid
feeling bad about my weight or how I look”) are answered with
a 7-point Likert scale from “never true/not at all believable” (1)
to “always true/completely believable” (7). The possible score
range is 22–154. Here too, a lower score reflects more psycho-
logical flexibility related to difficult weight-related thoughts
and feelings. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.90.

Psychological Stress and Symptoms of Depression

The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) [46]
was used to screen the volunteers for psychological distress.
The GHQ-12 has been found to be a valid screening tool for
common mental health problems in the Finnish population
[55]. The respondents were asked, considering the past few
weeks, to answer questions such as “Have you recently felt
constantly under strain?” In the screening, a bimodal scoring
system was used (“not at all” (0 point), “same as usual” (0),
“rather more than usual” (1), and “much more than usual” (1),
with the total sum score ranging from 0 to 12). Cronbach’s
alpha was 0.73. In the present analyses, Likert scoring (0, 1, 2,
and 3 points; possible range 0–36) was used in the statistical
analyses to achieve a larger variation in the GHQ-12 scores.
Cronbach’s alpha using Likert scoring was 0.82. The 14-item
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) [56] was used to assess the
degree to which a person perceives life as being stressful. The
questionnaire has demonstrated acceptable psychometric
properties worldwide [57]. Questions concern how often a
person has experienced certain feelings and thoughts during
the previous month, e.g., “In the last month, how often have
you found that you could not cope with all the things that you
had to do?” The 5-point Likert scale ranged from “never” (0)
to “very often” (4) and is summed for the total score (possible
range 0–56). Cronbach’s alpha was 0.88. Symptoms of

Int.J. Behav. Med. (2020) 27:539–555

543

depression were measured by the 21-item Beck Depression
Inventory-II (BDI-II) [58]. The 4-point Likert scale is scored
from 0 to 3, and the scores are summed to calculate the total
score (possible range 0–63). Cronbach’s alpha was 0.87. For
all these measures, higher scores indicate higher psychologi-
cal distress and depressive symptoms.

Diet and Physical Activity

Index of Diet Quality (IDQ) questionnaire [59] measured ad-
herence to Nordic and Finnish nutrition recommendations.
Apparently unrealistic answers (e.g., 27 slices of bread per
day) were verified from the participant when possible or cod-
ed as missing. Alcohol consumption during the previous
6 months was assessed using Alcohol Use Disorders
Identification Test Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaire
[60]. A 48-h dietary recall was conducted on the telephone
between Tuesday and Friday. The time for the telephone call
was pre-scheduled for practical reasons, and the participants
were informed that the interviewer would ask about their diet.
However, it was not mentioned that the interview will consid-
er their diet during the past 48 h. The interview protocol was
planned based on the protocol used in national FINDIET 2012
Survey [61]. We placed a special emphasis on the protocol to
assist the participant to remember and give accurate informa-
tion of the foods and drinks consumed. The protocol has been
described in more detail previously [62]. Nutrient intake was
calculated based on the 48-h dietary recall using AivoDiet
software (v 2.0.2.2; Aivo Ltd., Turku, Finland), utilizing the
Fineli® Finnish Food Composition Database (National
Institute for Health and Welfare, Nutrition Unit, Helsinki,
Finland).

Leisure time physical activity and commuting activity were
assessed by a questionnaire [63, 64]. Leisure time metabolic
equivalent (MET) index (MET h/day) was calculated as a sum
score of the different activities multiplied by the intensity
(MET), duration (h), and frequency of the activity [63, 64].

Statistical Methods

Statistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics
(version 23) and MATLAB R2017b. A p value < .05 was
considered as statistically significant.

Baseline differences between the groups were ana-
lyzed using Pearson chi-square test for categorical vari-
ables and one-way ANOVA with the Tukey HSD post
hoc test for continuous variables. The normality as-
sumption was assessed by the histograms of the resid-
uals. If the normality assumption was not met, the non-
parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. In the results,
descriptive values of the normally distributed variables
are presented as means ± SD and of the non-normally
distributed variables as medians (interquartile range).

General linear mixed model was used to analyze the differ-
ences between the three study groups using all three time
points (group × time interaction) and the main effect of time
on outcome variables. Participants were included as random
effects and intercept, group, time, interaction term, and covar-
iates as fixed effects. In case of a statistically significant group
× time interaction, the Sidak post hoc test was conducted for
pairwise comparisons. The analysis utilizes all of the available
data with the assumption of missing data as “missing at ran-
dom.” The missing data also seemed to be “missing at ran-
dom” as there were no differences in the study group, starting
time of the study, study center (chi-square test, p = .303,
p = .460, and p = .496, respectively), gender (Fisher’s exact
test, p = .302), age, GHQ-12 score, and baseline BMI (t test,
p = .548, p = .374, and p = .141, respectively) between the par-
ticipants who provided all data as compared to the participants
with missing data. Participants considered as outliers (over
mean ± 5 SDs) at any of the three time points were excluded.
The distributions of the values were so wide that using the
cutoff of mean ± 5 SDs enabled to exclude the true, explicit
outliers. The normality assumption was assessed by the resid-
ual histograms. The non-normally distributed outcome vari-
ables hsCRP, IL-1Ra, HMW adiponectin, and cortisol/
DHEAS ratio were log-transformed. All the analyses were
adjusted for study center and starting time of the study (i.e.,
basic adjusted model) and, in a fully adjusted model, also for
age, sex, and baseline BMI. Furthermore, to study the effect of
baseline BMI on the intervention effects, a group × time ×
baseline BMI interaction term was added into the model.

Linear regression analysis was used to investigate whether
psychological flexibility (general or weight-related) after the
intervention (week 10) predicted the levels of inflammation
and stress biomarkers after the follow-up period (week 36)
among the participants in the ACT intervention groups. At
first, psychological flexibility, age, sex, study center, and
starting time of the study were included in the model as inde-
pendent variables. Because study center and starting time of
the study were non-significant in each model, they were ex-
cluded from the final models. The assumptions were evaluated
with the Durbin-Watson test (between 1 and 3), tolerance
(0.1–1), VIF (1–10), studentized residuals (about 95% be-
tween − 2 and 2), Cook’s distance < 1, linearity in scatter
plots, and normality in residual histograms [65]. All the
models met the assumptions.

Exploratory principal component analyses (PCAs) were
conducted for psychological, physiological, anthropometric,
and lifestyle measures. These factors are often interrelated,
but we wanted to explore if the measures were clustered in
this sample. Two analyses were performed: (a) with values at
baseline and (b) for changes from baseline to week 36 (Δ36 =
week 36 value − week 0 value). The PCAs were intended to be
descriptive and hypothesis generating instead of being formal
hypothesis testing. The intention of these post hoc PCAs was

544

Int.J. Behav. Med. (2020) 27:539–555

to explore how psychological flexibility (general or weight-
related) and the biomarkers would cluster among the study
participants: do they correlate with each other or correlate
more strongly with other psychological, anthropometric, and
lifestyle measures. In the PCA with the changes from baseline
to week 36, missing data was handled by excluding the cases
with any missing data. Of the 200 participants with data from
both time points, 11% (n = 21) had to be excluded because of
hsCRP > 10 and 3% (n = 5) were excluded because of a miss-
ing value in any of the variables resulting in 174 participants
providing full data for this analysis. An outlier with a value
over mean ± 5 SDs was excluded (n = 1 because of a high
increase in HMW adiponectin value) resulting in n = 173.
PCAs were conducted with standardized values. The
Humphreys-Ilgen parallel analysis was used to determine the
number of components [66, 67]. The components were rotated

using varimax rotation [68]. Loadings of the rotated compo-
nents are reported. A threshold of 0.3 was used for interpreting
the baseline components’ loadings. A threshold of 0.25 was
used for interpreting the change (Δ36) components’ loadings
in order to include the inflammation markers into the
components.

infection or inflammation [47] and were excluded from the
present analyses. For the same reason, nine participants (4%)
were excluded from the week 10 and 15 participants (8%)
from week 36 assessments. In addition, one participant was
excluded from the analyses at each measurement time point
(different persons each time) because of a high IL-1Ra value
considered to be an outlier (over 5 SDs above the mean) and
one participant (same person each time) because of a very high
adiponectin value (over 5 SDs above the mean). The numbers
of participants included in the present analyses are shown in
Tables 1 and 2.

The measured BMI of the participants at the baseline lab-
oratory visit (n = 204, 84% females) ranged between 25.7 and
40.1 kg/m2 (mean ± SD 31.2 ± 2.9 kg/m2). Age ranged be-
tween 27 and 61 years (50 ± 7 years). Less than a third (28%)
had a high relative risk for cardiovascular disease (hsCRP >
3.0 mg/L), whereas 36% had hsCRP levels reflecting low risk
(< 1 mg/L) and 36% reflecting average (1.0 to 3.0 mg/L) risk
[69]. There were no differences in the baseline demographic,
clinical, psychological, and lifestyle characteristics between
the three study groups (Table 1).

Intervention Effects on Inflammation and Stress
Biomarkers

During the entire study period, a group × time interaction was
found in hsCRP but not in the other biomarkers (Table 2). In
the basic adjusted model, the level of hsCRP decreased sig-
nificantly in the face-to-face group from week 0 to week 36
(p = .045 for the post hoc test) and from week 10 to week 36
(p = .014, post hoc test). The only difference between the
groups was that the hsCRP was lower among the participants
in the face-to-face group as compared to the mobile group in
the week 36 (p = .035, post hoc test) with a small-to-medium
effect size (r = − .196, p = .035) (Fig. 1). Thus, the ACT
groups did not differ from the control group significantly. In
the fully adjusted model, the difference between the face-to-
face and mobile groups was no longer apparent in week 36,
with merely a trend (p = .062, post hoc test) being detected. In
this model, baseline BMI was significant (estimate .054,
p < .001). However, the decrease in hsCRP from week 0 to
week 36 (p = .048, post hoc test) and from week 10 to week 36
(p = .014, post hoc test) remained significant in the face-to-
face group. The hsCRP values presented in Table 2 are the
actual unestimated values (i.e., without adjustments) for clin-
ical interpretation. Figure 1 shows the logarithmically trans-
formed estimated (adjusted for study center and starting time
of the study) values from the statistical analysis. The estimated
marginal mean ± SE hsCRP values in the face-to-face group
for weeks 0, 10, and 36 without logarithmic transformation
were 1.955 ± 0.253 mg/L, 2.150 ± 0.261 mg/L, and 1.759 ±
0.264 mg/L, respectively.

During the entire study period, a significant decrease
(p < .001) in IL-1Ra over time was evident, in all of the study
groups (Table 2). The logarithmically transformed estimated
marginal mean ± SE IL-1Ra values for weeks 0, 10, and 36 of
the fully adjusted model were 2.588 ± .014, 2.597 ± .014, and
2.555 ± .014, respectively. In addition, a trend (p = .056) to-
wards an increase in the cortisol/DHEAS ratio was observed
(log-estimated marginal mean ± SE values for weeks 0, 10,
and 36 of the fully adjusted model − .887 ± .019, − .893
± .019, and − .864 ± .019, respectively).

There were no statistically significant differences (p values
> .186) in the baseline values of the inflammation and stress
biomarkers between the groups (Table 2). The intervention
effect was not dependent on baseline BMI (group × time ×
baseline BMI interaction non-significant for all inflammation
and stress biomarkers).

Association of Psychological Flexibility
with Inflammation and Stress Biomarkers

We further analyzed whether the main target of the ACT in-
tervention, psychological flexibility, was associated with the
levels of inflammation and stress biomarkers among the par-
ticipants in the ACT intervention groups (face-to-face and
mobile) over the long term. During the intensive intervention
period (from baseline to week 10), general psychological flex-
ibility increased in most of the participants (54%), but it de-
creased in 31%, while remaining the same in 15% of the
participants in the ACT groups. Weight-related psychological
flexibility increased in 66%, decreased in 33%, and remained
the same in 1% of the participants in the ACT groups. The
effects of the intervention on psychological flexibility have
been reported previously [70].

The level of psychological flexibility (general or weight-
related) after the intervention was not a strong predictor of the
levels of inflammation and stress biomarkers at the end of the
follow-up period (Table 3). Only general psychological flexi-
bility was a significant predictor (p = .041) such that a higher
AAQ-II score, i.e., lower psychological flexibility, predicted a
higher DHEAS level. In addition, lower age (p < .001) and
male sex (p = .002) were also predictors of a higher DHEAS
concentration in the model.

Explorative Analysis of Factors Associated
with Inflammation and Stress Biomarkers

To explore the associations between psychological well-being
with inflammation and stress biomarkers, considering also
clinical and lifestyle factors related to low-grade systemic in-
flammation, we conducted post hoc, exploratory PCAs (a) of
the variables measured at baseline and (b) of the changes
during the entire study period.

Discussion

This study investigated the effects of face-to-face and mobile
app ACT interventions on circulating levels of inflammatory
compounds and stress biomarkers among adults with psycho-
logical distress and overweight and obesity. The face-to-face
ACT intervention achieved a minor improvement in one of the
studied inflammation markers, hsCRP. Psychological flexibil-
ity (general or weight-related) after the intensive intervention
period was not a marked predictor of the inflammation and
stress biomarker levels 6 months after the follow-up.

The ACT-based intervention included mindfulness/
meditation practices, but also other ACT processes. Thus, the
aim of the intervention was to increase psychological flexibility
and overall well-being instead of focusing on stress reduction/
management which has often been the aim in previous mind-
fulness interventions [44, 71]. There is some evidence that
mindfulness and meditation interventions seem to decrease cir-
culating levels of some inflammation markers and cortisol mea-
sures [44, 71]. However, because this study seems to be the first
ACT-based randomized controlled intervention study investi-
gating the effects on hsCRP, IL-1Ra, HMW adiponectin, morn-
ing cortisol, DHEAS, and cortisol/DHEAS ratio in a real-world
non-clinical adult sample, the results will be discussed in rela-
tion to previous mindfulness-based interventions.

The ACT intervention delivered in the face-to-face group ses-
sions decreased hsCRP, although the effect was seen after the
follow-up period and only when the values were compared to
those in the mobile ACT group and not compared to the control
group. This is partly in line with previous findings from the same
intervention study showing that the effects of ACT are more pro-
nounced in the face-to-face group [48]. Although the intervention
content was the same, participants in the face-to-face group were,
on average, more extensively exposed to the treatment, and it is
also possible that participants in the face-to-face and mobile groups
have applied ACT in their personal lives differently. Furthermore,
the face-to-face and mobile groups did not differ after adjusting for
age, sex, and baseline BMI. This result indicates that BMI has
stronger effect on the modulation of the hsCRP concentration than
the intervention effect.

The within-group decrease of the hsCRP level in the face-to-
face group was significant. Because hsCRP increases the risk of
cardiovascular disease linearly [72], any decrease in hsCRP is
beneficial. However, when adjusted for study design, age, sex,
and baseline BMI, the 0.2 mg/L decrease of mean hsCRP in the
face-to-face group may not be clinically significant. It is notewor-
thy that over a third (36%) of the participants had a low hsCRP
level (< 1 mg/L) already at baseline, making it difficult to achieve
a large intervention effect.

The intervention effect on hsCRP is somewhat similar to
the previous mindfulness-based RCTs. No significant effect
compared to control has been observed among adults with
obesity [73, 74], and in healthy older adults, the hsCRP level

Fig. 1 The effects of ACT intervention on logarithmized hsCRP adjusted
for study center and starting time of the study. The values are log-
transformed estimated (adjusted for study center and starting time of the
study) marginal means ± standard error (SE). The measurements were
conducted before the intervention (baseline, study week 0), after the 8-
week intervention period (study week 10), and 36 weeks after the baseline
measurements (study week 36). The group × time interaction for the
entire study period was significant (p = .012). The face-to-face and
mobile groups had a significant difference at week 36 (p = .035, post
hoc test, indicated with an asterisk). The decrease of hsCRP from
week 0 to week 36 and from week 10 to week 36 was significant in the
face-to-face group (p = .045 and p = .014, respectively)

At Baseline

Six principal components (PCs) emerged which explained a
large proportion of the variation (61%) in the baseline data
(Table 4). PC1 represented poor mental well-being; PC2 meta-
bolic syndrome; PC3 age and diet; PC4 metabolic syndrome,
weight-related psychological inflexibility, and dieting; PC5 diet
quality; and PC6 physical activity (Table 4). With respect to the
inflammation and stress biomarkers, higher IL-1Ra and lower
HMW adiponectin levels were present with the higher BMI and
higher waist circumference in PC2. A lower DHEAS level was
associated with higher age, higher diet quality index, and higher
fiber intake in PC3. In addition, higher hsCRP was present with
lower weight-related psychological flexibility, higher BMI,
higher body fat percent, and lower energy intake in PC4.

Changes During the Entire Study Period

Five PCs emerged, explaining half of the variation (51%) of the
data with respect to the changes occurring during the entire study
period (Table 4). PC1 represented a change in poor mental well-
being, PC2 a change in weight-related psychological inflexibility
and metabolic syndrome, PC3 a change in inflammation and diet,
PC4 age and a change in weight-related psychological flexibility
and DHEAS, and PC5 a change in psychological distress and
physical inactivity (Table 4). With respect to the inflammation
and stress biomarkers, a decrease in HMW adiponectin level was
associated with decreased weight-related psychological flexibili-
ty, increased BMI, increased waist circumference, and increased
body fat percent in PC2. Increased hsCRP levels were present
with increased energy intake, increased saturated fat intake, and
decreased fiber intake in PC3. In addition, an elevated DHEAS
concentration was present with older age at baseline and an in-
crease in weight-related psychological flexibility in PC4.

has decreased only marginally as compared to control [75].
Although baseline BMI did not interact with the effectiveness
of the ACT intervention in the present study, a mindfulness-
based intervention was previously found to be effective
among participants with BMI < 30 kg/m2, whereas there was
no effect among participants with higher BMI values [73].

To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous ACT or
mindfulness intervention studies reporting effects on IL-1Ra
concentrations. In the present study, the levels of IL-1Ra de-
creased from baseline to follow-up in all study groups. A de-
cline in the IL-1Ra concentration is considered to reflect a re-
duced inflammatory state of the body [76], and weight loss and
dietary changes have been reported to decrease IL-1Ra levels
[76]. Thus, it is surprising that in our exploratory PCA, none of
the concurrent changes (i.e., changes in psychological well-be-
ing, body size and composition, other inflammation and stress
biomarkers, diet quality, or physical activity) were associated
with any change in the IL-1Ra level. However, there may be
some underlying dietary changes reflected in the overall de-
crease in IL-1Ra without there being a concurrent decrease in
other inflammation markers. Thus, IL-1Ra appears to be a more
sensitive marker for dietary changes (e.g., in the intake of die-
tary fatty acids, magnesium) than, for example, the levels of
hsCRP and HMW adiponectin [77, 78], also in the absence of
concurrent changes in body weight [77, 78].

The observation of no effects of ACT on HMW adiponectin
level is in line with previous mindfulness-based pilot studies
among people with obesity (n = 10) [39] and among bariatric
post-surgery patients being provided with a mindfulness interven-
tion (n = 9) as compared to patients receiving a standard interven-
tion (n = 9) [79]. Because the findings of these previous studies
were only preliminary, the evidence for the effects of ACT or
mindfulness-based interventions on adiponectin is still limited.

The ACT-based intervention in the present study also did
not affect the stress biomarkers, i.e., cortisol and DHEAS.
Previous controlled studies of mindfulness-based interven-
tions in non-clinical samples have not influenced serum morn-
ing cortisol [80], single time point cortisol level (from 11 a.m.
to 8 p.m.) [81], and the cortisol level 20–30 min after awak-
ening [73, 82]. One meta-analysis of seven mindfulness-
and meditation-based interventions reported a decrease
levels with a medium effect size [44], al-
in cortisol
though another found a reducing effect for diurnal cor-
tisol slopes but, consistently with our results, no effects
on single time point measurements [71].

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have
investigated the effects of mindfulness- or ACT-based inter-
vention on DHEAS and cortisol/DHEAS ratio in a non-
clinical sample. The present results are in line with the study
conducted in early-stage breast and prostate cancer patients, in
which a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) interven-
tion did not change the participants’ DHEAS levels or
cortisol/DHEAS ratio [83].

The ACT intervention of the present study was deliv-
ered in two different ways: via face-to-face group sessions
with a workbook and homework and, independently, via a
mobile app. The level of psychological flexibility (general
or weight-related) immediately after the intervention was
used as a commensurable marker of the individual re-
sponse to the ACT intervention. Psychological flexibility
after the intensive intervention period did not predict the
levels of inflammation markers and cortisol after the
follow-up among the participants in the ACT intervention
groups. However, higher general psychological flexibility
predicted lower DHEAS levels, although higher age and
female sex were stronger predictors in the model. DHEAS
is indeed age and sex specific: the DHEAS concentrations
decline during adulthood, and the levels are lower in fe-
males than in males [84].

The exploratory PCAs revealed some associations between
weight-related psychological flexibility and inflammation and
stress biomarkers in some of the principal components. At
baseline, lower weight-related psychological flexibility was
present with higher hsCRP, higher BMI, higher body fat per-
cent, and lower energy intake reflecting the presence of met-
abolic syndrome and either dieting or dietary under-reporting.
This result is logical because lower weight-related psycholog-
ical flexibility, i.e., avoidance and inflexibility related to diffi-
cult weight-related thoughts and feelings, has been associated
with higher BMI values [54] which, in turn, elevate the CRP
level [22].

Furthermore, changes in weight-related psychological flex-
ibility were associated with changes in some of the inflamma-
tion and stress biomarkers. Although an increase in weight-
related psychological flexibility was not associated with a
change in the hsCRP level, it was associated with other fea-
tures of the metabolic syndrome (i.e., a decline in BMI, a
reduction in waist circumference, a decrease in body fat per-
cent, and an increase in HMW adiponectin level) in one prin-
cipal component. Thus, the increase in weight-related psycho-
logical flexibility was associated with positive changes in in-
flammatory status and body composition. Among older par-
ticipants, the increase in weight-related psychological flexibil-
ity was also associated with a positive change, namely an
increase in the DHEAS level.

Surprisingly, cortisol levels were not associated with
any subjective measures of distress or with the DHEAS
levels at baseline or, longitudinally, in our exploratory
PCAs. While the cortisol level is elevated in an acute stress
response [14], it can be either increased or decreased in
chronic stress situations [11]. Cortisol secretion seems to
depend on the time elapsing since stress exposure onset,
the nature of the stressor, and personal factors [11], in
addition to the amount of visceral fat [13]. Thus, for some
study participants, the chronic stress response may have
been reflected in an increased morning cortisol level while

for others, it may have resulted in a decreased cortisol
level, making it impossible to detect clear associations with
other studied variables. Furthermore, cortisol secretion fol-
lows a distinct diurnal rhythm [85] which also may have
affected the present results because although all the blood
samples were drawn in the morning, it was not possible to
have study participants visiting the laboratory at precisely
the same time after awakening on each study visit. Thus,
utilizing a single time point for blood samples for cortisol
measurement is a limitation in the current study [86].
Furthermore, the use of the AAQ-II may have limited our
ability to assess general psychological flexibility, because
the validity of AAQ-II is questionable [87, 88].

Another limitation is that, as this was a secondary anal-
ysis of the intervention study, the analyses for intervention
effects may have been underpowered. Furthermore, we did
not take into account the possible influence of menopausal
status or medication as covariates [89]. It is also notewor-
thy that the PCA used in our explorative analyses has lim-
itations. PCA was used to explore how inflammation and
stress biomarkers would associate with psychological, an-
thropometric, and lifestyle measures since all of these are
claimed to be intertwined. Our intention with PCA was to
identify which variables would emerge with inflammation
and stress biomarkers in the principal components.
However, most of the variance of the data was explained
by the psychological variables. Furthermore, some of the
loadings of the rotated components were rather low, and
thus, the PCA results regarding inflammation and stress
biomarkers should be interpreted with caution. The dietary
intake measured with a retrospective 48-h dietary recall is
also a limitation. The outcome depends on participants’
memory. However, this was addressed in our interview
protocol [62] that was based on the protocol used in na-
tional dietary intake study [61]. The 48-h dietary recall was
used instead of, e.g., food records to diminish the burden
on the participants and because also the other methods
have limitations [90].

There are also several strengths in the present study. The
intervention study was conducted as a randomized controlled
trial with a rather large sample size. Working-age participants
with subjective psychological distress and overweight were
recruited, meaning that our participants had a high risk for
low-grade systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome.
Biomarkers were measured in the fasting state, and the main
statistical analyses were controlled for age, sex, and BMI. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate
the effects of ACT on circulating inflammation and stress
biomarkers in a non-clinical adult sample in a real-world set-
ting. Furthermore, the associations between psychological
flexibility and these biomarkers have not been studied before.
Thus, the present results provide insights into how these two
underlying process measures associate with each other: the

552

psychological process behind human suffering and the phys-
iological process behind ill health.

In psychological science, there is a move towards process-
based care to target the processes underlying human suffering
irrespective of diagnoses (i.e., transdiagnostic perspective)
[31, 36, 91]. Transdiagnostic, process-based care makes it
possible to affect several diseases and symptoms without fo-
cusing directly on those diseases or symptoms. This may be
extremely helpful among people with overweight and psycho-
logical distress, because obesity is closely linked to weight
stigmatization (i.e., prejudice, discrimination, and negative
attitudes towards people with obesity), which, in turn, contrib-
utes to stress and obesity [92]. Utilizing process-based psy-
chological care may represent one way to help these individ-
uals, e.g., to reduce low-grade systemic inflammation and the
risk of type 2 diabetes without focusing on obesity. However,
these primary results highlight that more research is needed on
how best to apply the process-based care for the health of both
mind and body among people with overweight and psycho-
logical distress.

In conclusion, these preliminary results suggest that a gen-
eral ACT intervention delivered in face-to-face group sessions
may have some beneficial effects on inflammation. Weight-
related psychological flexibility may be a feature of the psy-
chological processes linked to certain physiological processes
such as low-grade systemic inflammation. Further studies of
ACT interventions are needed to target specific physiological
pathways by means of psychological processes (i.e., psycho-
logical flexibility).
