Abstract: Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) and food neophobia present signifi-
cant challenges in pediatric healthcare, particularly among children with food allergies (FAs). These
eating disorders, characterized by the persistent avoidance or restriction of food, can lead to severe
nutritional deficiencies and psychosocial impairments. The presence of FAs further complicates these
eating behaviors, as the fear of allergic reactions exacerbates avoidance and restrictive patterns. This
comprehensive review synthesizes current knowledge on ARFID and food neophobia, focusing on
their definitions, characteristics, and the unique challenges they present in the context of FAs. The
review explores the critical role of healthcare professionals, especially nurses, in integrating psycho-
logical and clinical care to improve outcomes for affected children. A multidisciplinary approach,
including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Family-Based Therapy (FBT), is emphasized as
essential in addressing the complex needs of these patients. The review also highlights the need for
standardized treatment protocols and further research on the long-term outcomes of these disorders,
aiming to enhance therapeutic strategies and family support systems. Effective management of
ARFID and food neophobia in the context of FAs requires a holistic and integrated approach to
mitigate the profound impacts on a child’s growth, development, and overall well-being.

Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) and food neophobia represent
significant challenges in pediatric healthcare, particularly impacting children with food
allergies (FAs) [1–4]. These eating behaviors are closely correlated with the presence of FAs,
as children with FAs are at increased risk of developing avoidant behaviors toward food
and feeding due to fear of allergic reactions [5–7]. Both ARFID and food neophobia are
significant concerns due to their biopsychosocial consequences, including anxiety, which
can profoundly impact daily activities and social interactions [8–12]. Children with ARFID
may experience significant anxiety and distress related to eating, which often extends to

other areas of their lives [10]. This condition profoundly influences the quality of life of both
the children and their parents, affecting the child’s development and potentially leading
to long-term health issues such as lower bone density and shorter stature, as recently
discussed by Proctor et al. [13–16].

ARFID, first recognized as a distinct diagnostic category in 2013, is characterized by
the persistent avoidance or restriction of food intake, leading to nutritional deficiencies,
weight loss, and psychosocial impairments without concerns about body weight or shape
that characterize other eating disorders [17,18]. The behavior toward food in children with
ARFID is often shaped by a complex interplay of psychological factors, including anxiety
about eating and the potential for allergic reactions [1,2,19].

Similarly, food neophobia, introduced by Pliner and Hobden in 1992 [20], defined
as the fear or refusal to try new foods, commonly occurs in early childhood and can
result in limited dietary variety [8,9]. Parental anxiety plays a significant role in the
development of both ARFID and food neophobia, as parents may report higher feeding
and emotional disturbances in children with these conditions [21–23]. In children with FAs,
food neophobia may be more pronounced due to previous negative experiences with food
and heightened anxiety related to the possibility of an allergic reaction [8,24–26].

The etiology of both ARFID and food neophobia is multifactorial, with FAs identified
as one of the contributing factors [5,9,27–29]. Children with FAs may develop anxiety and
fear related to eating due to the risk of allergic reactions, which can exacerbate avoidance
behaviors and lead to or worsen ARFID and food neophobia [1,2,30]. Other contributing
factors include genetic predispositions, sensory sensitivities, and negative past experiences
with food [16,22].

Moreover, it is important to recognize that both ARFID and food neophobia may be
linked to FAs through shared mechanisms of anxiety and avoidance behavior, as children
with FAs often develop a heightened sense of fear toward consuming new or previously
tolerated foods due to the potential risk of allergic reactions [7,31,32].These conditions
can lead to significant social impairments and contribute to psychological distress, further
complicating the child’s overall well-being and development [23,33].

Both conditions can have profound implications for a child’s growth, development,

and overall well-being, particularly when complicated by the presence of FAs [1].

The intersection of ARFID, food neophobia, and FAs presents a complex clinical
picture that heightens the risk of nutritional deficiencies and impacts growth and develop-
ment [2,21]. Parental anxiety and feeding practices also play a role in the development and
maintenance of these eating behaviors, further affecting the child’s quality of life [10,34].

Given the rising prevalence up to 22% of these conditions and their potential persis-
tence into adulthood causing medical, psychological, and social issues, a comprehensive
understanding of their development, management, and impact on pediatric patients with
FAs is essential [10,34–42].

This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on ARFID and food neophobia,
with a specific focus on their correlations with behavior toward food and feeding in the
context of FAs.

Furthermore, it will explore the critical role of healthcare professionals, particularly nurses,

in integrating psychological and clinical care, to improve outcomes for affected children.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Objectives

This comprehensive review investigates the literature on ARFID and food neophobia
in the pediatric population (0 to 18 years) with FAs. The aim is to provide a thorough
understanding of the clinical and psychological aspects of these disorders, explore potential
treatments, identify gaps in the current literature, and suggest areas for future research.

2.2. Search Strategy

The literature search was conducted using the CINAHL Complete, PubMed, and
Scopus databases. Specific relevant keywords such as ‘food allergy’, ‘food allergies’,
‘ARFID’, ‘avoidant restrictive food intake disorder’, ‘selective eating disorder’, ‘selective
feeding disorder’, ‘food neophobia’, ‘children’, ‘adolescents’, ‘nurse’, and ‘nursing’ were
employed to identify eligible articles.

To include as many pertinent articles as possible, two search strings were formulated:

1.

2.

(food allergy OR food allergies) AND (ARFID OR avoidant restrictive food intake
disorder OR selective eating disorder OR selective food intake disorder OR neophobia)

nurses OR nursing)
(food allergy OR food allergies) AND (ARFID OR avoidant restrictive food intake
disorder OR selective eating disorder OR selective food intake disorder OR neophobia)
AND (children OR adolescents OR youth OR child OR teenager)

The search strings were developed collaboratively by the authors, who then retrieved

and evaluated relevant articles by reading the full texts.

2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
2.3.1. Inclusion Criteria

(a) Type of Studies: All types of studies, including systematic reviews, randomized

controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case reports.

(b) Language: Articles published in English or Italian.
(c)

Participants: Studies involving participants diagnosed with FA and the subsequent
development of ARFID or food neophobia.

2.3.2. Exclusion Criteria

(a) Non-peer-reviewed articles, conference abstracts, and letters to the editor.
(b) Articles published in languages other than English or Italian.
(c)

Studies published outside the 15-year period.

2.3.3. Selection Process

The review was conducted between May 2024 and July 2024. The search strategy
identified 182 articles. After removing 63 duplicates, 119 articles remained for title screening.
This step was performed independently by each author to ensure objectivity. Disagreements
were resolved through discussion and consensus. After title screening, 23 articles were
considered for full-text evaluation. Full-text reading was also carried out independently
by the authors, leading to the final selection of 17 articles. Figure 1 reports the PRISMA
diagram illustrating the selection process. The authors achieved a 100% agreement on
the inclusion and exclusion of articles after a discussion in which individual articles were
evaluated according to the inclusion criteria.

2.3.4. Data Analysis

Data from the selected studies were grouped into thematic categories to describe
psychological and behavioral aspects, clinical aspects, interventions and treatments, and
the role of health professionals. The thematic analysis followed a structured approach
involving coding, identification of themes, and synthesis of findings [43]. Key interconnec-
tions between variables such as food-related anxiety and psychiatric comorbidities were
identified, to provide a deeper understanding of the development of ARFID and food
neophobia in children with FA.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Food Allergy, ARFID, and Neophobia: Definitions, Etiology, and Clinical Aspects

FA is a prevalent chronic condition in children, arising from a disruption of immune
tolerance to dietary antigens [44]. The prevalence, persistence, and severity of FA are in-
creasing, leading to significant negative impacts on the health-related quality of life for both
patients and their families, as well as escalating costs associated with its management [45].
In addition to the direct physical effects, FA can also affect social and psychological well-
being [46], with the risk of developing restricted food preferences in children and altering
their taste and sensory perception [2]. Although research in this area is still limited, it has
been found that children with FA may develop maladaptive eating behaviors such as food
refusal, tantrums, and reduced food intake in an attempt to avoid pain, discomfort, or
anxiety [7].

These behaviors are not limited to the avoidance of allergens but may extend to
normally tolerated foods [39]. The causes of such avoidance may include lack of appeal of
the food, unpleasant sensory properties or fear of negative consequences, often exacerbated
by genetic and psychosocial predispositions [28].

These factors may contribute to the development of ARFID and food neophobia,
complex and multifactorial conditions that negatively impact eating behavior and psycho-

logical well-being [47]. The presence of FAs can exacerbate avoidant behaviors toward
food, leading to more severe cases of ARFID and food neophobia [2,7,26,30,31,48].

ARFID is a relatively recent feeding disorder, first included as a diagnostic category in
2013 [49], and it is also recognized in the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh
Revision (ICD-11). It is characterized by persistent avoidance or restriction of food intake,
leading to significant nutritional deficiencies, weight loss, and psychosocial impairment,
without concerns related to body weight or shape [17,18]. Its etiology is complex and includes
factors such as sensory sensitivities, traumatic experiences related to eating (e.g., choking,
vomiting), comorbid psychological conditions, and medical issues like FAs [16,47,49]. FAs can
contribute to ARFID development by instilling fear and anxiety around eating, leading
children to avoid certain foods or entire food groups to prevent adverse reactions [2,30].

Food neophobia refers to the fear or refusal to try new or unfamiliar foods, typically
emerging in early childhood [7,8]. Etiological factors include evolutionary protective
mechanisms, genetic predispositions, and learned behaviors influenced by family and
cultural practices [24,50]. In children with FAs, food neophobia may be intensified due to
negative experiences with certain foods and heightened anxiety about potential allergic
reactions, further restricting dietary variety and nutritional intake [26,48].

Both ARFID and food neophobia can have significant health implications, including
impaired growth and development, nutritional deficiencies, and reduced quality of life [10,11].
The prevalence of these conditions varies, with some studies reporting rates ranging from
5% to 22.5% for ARFID in children and adolescents, influenced by factors such as age,
geography, and diagnostic criteria used [10,34–36,38,39]. Understanding the etiological
role of FAs in these disorders is crucial for effective diagnosis and intervention, as the
management of underlying food allergies can be integral to addressing the associated
feeding difficulties [27,51].

Early identification and comprehensive assessment are essential in managing ARFID
and food neophobia, particularly when FAs are involved. Diagnostic tools such as the
Eating Disorders Assessment for DSM-5 (EDA-5) and the Children Food Neophobia Scale
(CFNS) can aid in accurately diagnosing and differentiating these conditions [52,53]. A
thorough clinical evaluation should consider medical history, including any known FAs,
psychological factors, and environmental influences to develop an effective, individualized
treatment plan [52,54].

3.2. ARFID and Food Neophobia in the Context of Food Allergy

Both ARFID and food neophobia can be exacerbated by the presence of FAs, as the fear
of allergic reactions can increase anxiety and food refusal behaviors [1,2,19]. The correlation
between FAs and avoidant behaviors toward food and feeding is particularly pronounced
in pediatric populations [2,7]. Children with FAs often develop a heightened sensitivity to
food-related cues due to their experiences with allergic reactions [3,4] which can manifest
in various ways, including avoidance of certain foods and mealtime anxiety [2,55], leading
to the development of ARFID or exacerbating existing food neophobia [27,51].

In children with FAs, who already have restricted diets due to the need to avoid
allergenic foods, the fear of trying new foods can further restrict dietary variety, resulting
in a limited diet that lacks essential nutrients [27,51]. The fear of adverse reactions can
cause children to become overly sensitive to food-related cues, intensifying their fear of
trying new foods and resulting in restrictive eating behaviors [2]. Patients with ARFID
typically wish to gain weight but refrain from eating for various reasons, such as the
sensory properties of food, fear of potential negative outcomes from eating (e.g., vomiting,
reflux, choking), or a general lack of interest in food [56,57].

In addition, the emotional response of parents to their child’s allergic reactions or
at mealtimes also plays a crucial role in shaping the child’s eating behaviors, making
them more fearful or anxious about eating, further limiting the child’s dietary variety [58].
Studies have highlighted that adverse reactions to foods are a significant concern for
parents and can impact the family’s quality of life. Many parents report high levels of

Nutrients 2024, 16, 3034

6 of 16

stress and anxiety related to managing their child’s FAs, which can influence the child’s
eating behaviors and contribute to the development of ARFID [59]. Research indicates
that anxiety symptoms in children with FAs are driven by perceptions of risk and the
burden of managing their allergies, rather than their medical history alone [9]. This anxiety
can extend beyond food-related situations, contributing to generalized anxiety and social
phobia [60].

The recent National Birth Cohort study further supports that higher parental stress,
especially related to specific allergens like hen’s egg, is linked with increased behavioral
issues in children, potentially leading to neophobia and ARFID [61]. Furthermore, children
with FAs often exhibit a broad range of gastrointestinal issues, which can compound their
eating difficulties and contribute to the development of ARFID [62]. If not addressed, these
conditions can significantly affect children’s growth and development, especially in the
presence of FAs [1]. FAs are a substantial public health concern, affecting up to 11% of
the pediatric population [45,55,63,64]. In pediatric subjects with FAs, the prevalence of
concomitant eating disorders ranges widely from 8% to 62.9% [65,66].

The intersection of ARFID, food neophobia, and FAs presents unique challenges. Chil-
dren with FAs are already at risk for nutritional deficiencies due to the necessary avoidance
of allergenic foods [2]. The presence of ARFID and food neophobia can exacerbate these
challenges, leading to more severe nutritional deficits and impacting growth and devel-
opment [16]. Additionally, these children frequently exhibit anxiety disorders, including
generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and panic disorder, which further complicate their
eating behaviors and overall health [10,37,67].

Understanding the complex relationship between ARFID, food neophobia, and FAs is
essential for developing effective interventions. This includes addressing both the medical
management of allergies and the psychological support needed to reduce food-related anxiety
and improve dietary intake [61,62,65,66]. Effective management requires a multidisciplinary
approach that integrates medical, nursing, psychological, and nutritional care, with a focus on
reducing food-related anxiety and increasing dietary variety [10,27,60,67].

Figure 2 depicts a Venn diagram that illustrates the relationships and overlaps between
ARFID, food neophobia, and FAs. This diagram helps to visualize how these conditions
intersect, contributing to complex food-related challenges in affected individuals.

Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 17    Figure 2. VENN diagram. 3.3. Interventions and Treatments: Comprehensive Approach A comprehensive approach to managing ARFID and food neophobia involves inte-grating nursing, psychological, medical, and nutritional care through a multidisciplinary team. Given the complexity of the disorder, it is essential that a team of specialists is in-volved in its diagnosis and management, working together to develop a personalized treatment plan that takes into account the patient’s age and the severity of the disorder [32,68–70]. This strategy ensures that all aspects of the disorders, including nutritional deﬁcien-cies, psychological distress, and behavioral issues, are addressed [28,68]. In children with FAs, treatment plans must also incorporate strategies to manage the underlying allergies, which are often a central factor in the development and maintenance of ARFID and food neophobia [30,34]. A critical component of this approach is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is particularly eﬀective in treating ARFID by targeting avoidance behaviors and fears as-sociated with food intake, thereby improving eating behaviors [71]. CBT for ARFID (CBT-AR) is a ﬂexible, modular treatment typically conducted over 20–30 sessions. It includes four stages: psychoeducation and early change, treatment planning, addressing maintain-ing mechanisms, and relapse prevention. The therapy’s core components—food exposure, psychoeducation, anxiety management, and family involvement—help patients gradually confront and reduce food-related fears [72]. For pediatric patients with FAs, CBT may in-clude components speciﬁcally designed to address the anxiety and fear related to allergic reactions, making it a tailored approach for this population [72,73]. The success of managing ARFID and food neophobia, especially in pediatric patients, hinges on a multidisciplinary team that often includes pediatricians, nurses, dietitians, psychologists, and other specialists. The integrated (cid:31)whole team’ approach that character-izes specialized services, with strong leadership and a consistent treatment philosophy, appears to be more important for outcomes than the speciﬁc skills of individual practi-tioners working in separate settings [74]. These professionals work collaboratively to provide comprehensive care, with regu-lar interdisciplinary meetings ensuring consistent updates and necessary adjustments to Nutrients 2024, 16, 3034

3.3. Interventions and Treatments: Comprehensive Approach

A comprehensive approach to managing ARFID and food neophobia involves integrat-
ing nursing, psychological, medical, and nutritional care through a multidisciplinary team.
Given the complexity of the disorder, it is essential that a team of specialists is involved in
its diagnosis and management, working together to develop a personalized treatment plan
that takes into account the patient’s age and the severity of the disorder [32,68–70].

This strategy ensures that all aspects of the disorders, including nutritional deficiencies,
In children with
psychological distress, and behavioral issues, are addressed [28,68].
FAs, treatment plans must also incorporate strategies to manage the underlying allergies,
which are often a central factor in the development and maintenance of ARFID and food
neophobia [30,34].

A critical component of this approach is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which
is particularly effective in treating ARFID by targeting avoidance behaviors and fears
associated with food intake, thereby improving eating behaviors [71]. CBT for ARFID
(CBT-AR) is a flexible, modular treatment typically conducted over 20–30 sessions. It
includes four stages: psychoeducation and early change, treatment planning, addressing
maintaining mechanisms, and relapse prevention. The therapy’s core components—food
exposure, psychoeducation, anxiety management, and family involvement—help patients
gradually confront and reduce food-related fears [72]. For pediatric patients with FAs, CBT
may include components specifically designed to address the anxiety and fear related to
allergic reactions, making it a tailored approach for this population [72,73].

The success of managing ARFID and food neophobia, especially in pediatric patients,
hinges on a multidisciplinary team that often includes pediatricians, nurses, dietitians, psy-
chologists, and other specialists. The integrated ‘whole team’ approach that characterizes
specialized services, with strong leadership and a consistent treatment philosophy, ap-
pears to be more important for outcomes than the specific skills of individual practitioners
working in separate settings [74].

These professionals work collaboratively to provide comprehensive care, with reg-
ular interdisciplinary meetings ensuring consistent updates and necessary adjustments
to treatment plans. This team-based approach allows for tailored interventions that meet
the unique needs of each patient [73]. Nurses play a crucial role in early identification,
routine health assessments, and ongoing monitoring, while dietitians develop and monitor
nutritional plans to ensure patients receive adequate nutrition despite their restrictive
eating patterns. Pediatricians oversee the overall health and development of the child,
addressing any medical concerns that arise, while psychologists provide essential support
through interventions like CBT [73].

Family involvement is essential in the treatment process, as family dynamics can signifi-
cantly impact a child’s eating behaviors, particularly for children with FAs, where parental
anxiety and feeding practices significantly impact the child’s eating behaviors [22,34,70].

Active participation of parents or guardians in goal setting and treatment planning
is essential, along with education and support to help them understand the disorder and
support their child’s recovery at home [70]. In fact, family-based therapy (FBT) has shown
promising results in treating ARFID and food neophobia, particularly in children. FBT
focuses on empowering parents to take an active role in managing their child’s eating
behaviors, which is crucial for overcoming the challenges associated with ARFID. Studies
have demonstrated that FBT, when adapted for ARFID, significantly improves parental
self-efficacy, leading to better outcomes in children’s eating habits and nutritional status.
For instance, a randomized clinical trial found that children receiving FBT and Psychoedu-
cational Motivation Therapy (PMT) exhibited notable improvements in weight gain and a
reduction in food avoidance behaviors compared to those in other treatment groups [75].
The PMT can effectively improve motivation and reduce food-related anxiety, leading to
positive changes in eating behaviors, even in cases where traditional behavioral interven-
tions alone have been insufficient. Integrating cognitive behavioral strategies within FBT

Nutrients 2024, 16, 3034

has been effective in increasing dietary variety and reducing food-related anxiety, making
it a comprehensive approach for addressing food neophobia [76].

Given the lack of standardized management protocols, there is a critical need for devel-
oping individualized treatment plans that consider the patient’s age, developmental stage,
the presence of FAs, and the severity of the disorder [77]. Pharmacological interventions,
such as appetite stimulants and medications for managing co-occurring anxiety, may also
be necessary as part of a comprehensive treatment plan [78,79]. Therefore, multidisciplinary
treatment approaches have shown promising results in improving outcomes for ARFID
patients. Recent studies, such as those conducted by Murphy and Zlomke (2016), Lenz et al.
(2018), and Spettigue et al. (2018), support the effectiveness of this approach [80–82]. A
randomized clinical trial showed that a day treatment program with intensive, portable in-
terventions delivered by a multidisciplinary team led to significantly greater improvements,
suggesting that a collaborative approach can effectively address chronic food refusal [69].
Multidisciplinary treatment approaches have shown promising results in improving
outcomes for ARFID patients. Parents play a crucial role in the management of eating
disorders. They need to be actively involved in treatment [83]. However, despite their
importance, they often receive little support. Parents are often the first to recognize the
disorder in their children and their involvement is essential, but they are not always
adequately supported [24,83].

It is important to recognize the needs of parents and to encourage close collaboration
between them and healthcare providers. Both need up-to-date information and ongoing support
to manage the emotional burden and improve the management of the disorder [77,83,84].

A systematic review emphasized the need for well-defined protocols and training
programs to ensure consistency and effectiveness in care delivery. It also highlighted the
importance of nutritional rehabilitation as a critical component of treatment, recommending
oral feeding as the preferred method and enteral feeding as a last resort for severely affected
patients [79]. Additionally, studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of exposure-based
interventions and CBT in reducing food neophobia and improving dietary intake, with
evidence supporting their application in children, adolescents, and even individuals with
intellectual disabilities and anxiety [85].

Nurses play a critical role as counselors in CBT, providing essential support to patients
dealing with various psychological and physical conditions. For instance, Niesen et al.
(2018) demonstrated that nurse-led CBT significantly reduces functional abdominal pain
and enhances self-management. Similarly, Lee et al. (2011) found that nurse-led CBT
reduces fatigue and improves quality of life in breast cancer patients undergoing radiother-
apy [86,87]. Thus, evidence highlights the effectiveness of nurse-led CBT interventions in
improving patient self-management and overall quality of life.

The diagram in Figure 3 outlines the roles of a multidisciplinary team in the treatment
of ARFID and food neophobia. This team-based approach ensures comprehensive care,
addressing both the medical, nursing, and psychological needs of individuals with ARFID
and food neophobia.

3.4. Role of Nurses in Managing ARFID and Food Neophobia

Nurses could play a critical role in the early identification and routine health assess-
ments of pediatric patients with ARFID and food neophobia, particularly in pediatric
patients with FAs. They are often the first healthcare providers to notice signs and symp-
toms of ARFID, such as significant weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and psychosocial
impairments. Regular growth monitoring and nutritional assessments are essential com-
ponents of routine health check-ups, enabling early detection and intervention [88]. In
cases involving FAs, nurses also monitor the management of allergies, ensuring that dietary
interventions are safe and effective [27].

Nutrients 2024, 16, 3034

Figure 3. Multidisciplinary team approach to ARFID and food neophobia treatment.

Nurses collaborate with dietitians to develop and implement individualized nutrition
plans that address both the specific needs related to ARFID or food neophobia and the
dietary restrictions imposed by FAs [79]. These plans often include strategies like food
chaining, which involves gradually introducing new foods in a way that feels safe to the
child. Nurses also monitor the child’s progress, adjust the care plan as needed, and ensure
that the child receives adequate nutrition to support growth and development [27].

A systematic review highlighted the importance of a multidisciplinary approach
involving pediatric gastroenterologists, nutritionists, neuropsychiatrists, and psycholo-
gists [79]. Nurses play a central role in this team by coordinating care, ensuring that all
aspects of the child’s health are addressed. Their role is essential because they act as
intermediaries between the patient and the entire healthcare team [89]. They facilitate
communication between different team members and ensure that all diagnostic and ther-
apeutic information is shared and understood [90]. This central role in coordination is
crucial because it helps ensure that treatment is integrated and consistent, enabling more
effective management of eating disorders [91].

This holistic approach is essential for managing the complex needs of children with

ARFID [79].

Education and support for families are vital components of managing ARFID and
food neophobia [92,93]. In fact, community nurses have a vital role to play as their role
goes beyond care and includes relationship, support, and the application of behavioral and
health theory [93].

Nurses provide education and support to families, helping them manage food-related
anxiety and improve the child’s eating behaviors at home. This includes educating parents
about the nature of ARFID, its potential impact on their child’s health, and effective
strategies for encouraging healthy eating behaviors. They are uniquely positioned to
offer ongoing emotional and psychological support, which is essential for maintaining a
therapeutic environment in both clinical and home settings [93].

Community nurses play a significant role in improving caregivers’ abilities to care
for children with ARFID. They help to develop effective strategies to improve children’s
eating habits. This is crucial as many caregivers may lack the skills to deal with food

Additionally, studies have demonstrated the eﬀectiveness of expo-sure-based interventions and CBT in reducing food neophobia and improving dietary in-take, with evidence supporting their application in children, adolescents, and even indi-viduals with intellectual disabilities and anxiety [85]. Nurses play a critical role as counselors in CBT, providing essential support to pa-tients dealing with various psychological and physical conditions. For instance, Niesen et al. (2018) demonstrated that nurse-led CBT signiﬁcantly reduces functional abdominal pain and enhances self-management. Similarly, Lee et al. (2011) found that nurse-led CBT reduces fatigue and improves quality of life in breast cancer patients undergoing radio-therapy [86,87]. Thus, evidence highlights the eﬀectiveness of nurse-led CBT interventions in improving patient self-management and overall quality of life. The diagram in Figure 3 outlines the roles of a multidisciplinary team in the treatment of ARFID and food neophobia. This team-based approach ensures comprehensive care, addressing both the medical, nursing, and psychological needs of individuals with ARFID and food neophobia.  Figure 3. Multidisciplinary team approach to ARFID and food neophobia treatment. 3.4. Role of Nurses in Managing ARFID and Food Neophobia Nurses could play a critical role in the early identiﬁcation and routine health assess-ments of pediatric patients with ARFID and food neophobia, particularly in pediatric pa-tients with FAs. They are often the ﬁrst healthcare providers to notice signs and symptoms of ARFID, such as signiﬁcant weight loss, nutritional deﬁciencies, and psychosocial im-pairments. Regular growth monitoring and nutritional assessments are essential compo-nents of routine health check-ups, enabling early detection and intervention [88]. In cases involving FAs, nurses also monitor the management of allergies, ensuring that dietary interventions are safe and eﬀective [27]. Nurses collaborate with dietitians to develop and implement individualized nutri-tion plans that address both the speciﬁc needs related to ARFID or food neophobia and the dietary restrictions imposed by FAs [79]. These plans often include strategies like food chaining, which involves gradually introducing new foods in a way that feels safe to the Nutrients 2024, 16, 3034

selectivity and nutritional difficulties [69,94,95]. Through education, nurses provide tools
and knowledge to help caregivers better manage such conditions [93].

They use models like Johnson’s Behavioral System Model (JBSM) and the Health
Belief Model (HBM) to guide their interventions, helping parents develop constructive
behaviors and build confidence in managing their child’s condition [93]. By applying these
models, nurses can tailor interventions to meet the unique needs of each family, which is
particularly important in managing the psychosocial aspects of ARFID.

A study by De Toro et al. (2021) emphasized the importance of a multidisciplinary
approach and highlighted the role of pediatricians and nurses in diagnosing ARFID [96].
Nurses are essential not only in diagnosis but also in providing continuous support that
integrates psychological, nutritional, and medical care, ensuring that families receive
comprehensive care [96].

A recent study by Oktarina et al. (2023) demonstrated that health education interven-
tions for mothers significantly improved their ability to manage toddlers with ARFID [92].
This study underscores the importance of community health nursing in providing targeted
education and support to caregivers.

In addition to education, community nurses play a key role in meal planning and
nutritional monitoring, intervening early to prevent complications such as weight loss and
nutritional deficiencies. This early intervention is essential to prevent eating difficulties
from developing into more serious problems [70,93].

Furthermore, nurses help to reduce the stress and emotional burden on careers by pro-
viding a supportive environment that is essential for the management of the psychological
and social challenges associated with ARFID [97]. Their ability to offer both psychological
and social support is critical for the overall well-being of families [89].

Moreover, school nurses have a unique role in managing children with ARFID and
food neophobia within the school environment, particularly for children with FAs. They
can implement individualized health plans, monitor dietary intake, and provide ongoing
support and education to both children and their families. This is particularly important for
children with additional needs, such as those with ASD, who may exhibit more pronounced
food selectivity [98]. Table 1 summarizes strategies used by nurses to support families in
managing ARFID and food-related anxiety.

Providing Comprehensive Education: Nurses educate families about ARFID,
explaining its symptoms, causes, and potential impacts. By covering both the
psychological and physical aspects of the disorder, they help families understand the
importance of addressing these issues together.

Teaching Anxiety Management Techniques: Nurses train parents and children in
managing anxiety related to food intake, such as through deep breathing exercises,
mindfulness, and relaxation techniques. These skills help reduce mealtime stress and
foster a more positive eating environment.

Developing and Monitoring Individualized Feeding Plans: Nurses collaborate with
dietitians to create tailored feeding plans that gradually introduce new foods while
ensuring nutritional adequacy. Techniques like food chaining are used to introduce
new foods in small, manageable steps.

Routine Monitoring and Adjustments: Regular follow-ups are essential to assess
progress and adjust feeding plans as necessary. Nurses track the child’s growth,
nutritional intake, and psychological well-being to provide comprehensive care.

Providing Emotional Support: Nurses offer emotional support by acknowledging the
challenges families face and validating their experiences. They provide a listening ear
and empathetic responses to alleviate feelings of isolation and frustration.

Facilitating Support Groups: Nurses can organize or recommend support groups
where families share experiences and strategies with others facing similar challenges.
These groups provide mutual support and practical advice.

4. Strengths and Limitations

This review offers a thorough and comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature on
ARFID, food neophobia, and FAs in pediatric populations, highlighting several strengths.
A key strength lies in its multidisciplinary approach, which integrates psychological, nutri-
tional, and medical perspectives to provide a holistic understanding of these conditions and
their impact on children’s health and development. The review emphasizes the importance
of collaboration among pediatricians, psychologists, dietitians, and nurses in managing
these eating disorders, underscoring the crucial role of nurses in early identification and
intervention, as well as their support throughout the therapeutic process.

In addition to this, the review offers a detailed examination of effective therapies,
such as CBT and FBT, both of which have been shown to be beneficial in improving eating
behaviors and reducing anxiety associated with these disorders. This focus on evidence-
based treatments presents practical solutions that can significantly enhance the quality of
life for patients and their families while addressing the psychological impact of ARFID and
food neophobia.

However, this review also has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. It is
constrained by the limited availability of longitudinal studies, which restricts the ability to
draw definitive conclusions about the long-term outcomes of ARFID and food neophobia
in the context of FAs. The reliance on studies published only in English and Italian
may introduce language bias, potentially excluding relevant research published in other
languages. Additionally, the exclusion of non-peer-reviewed articles, while ensuring the
quality of the review, might have led to the omission of emerging evidence in this rapidly
evolving field. The lack of standardized treatment protocols for ARFID and food neophobia
is another significant limitation, as it can result in inconsistent treatment approaches and
variable outcomes.

Overall, while this review provides valuable insights and a well-structured analysis of
ARFID and food neophobia, the identified gaps highlight the necessity for further research.
There is a particular need for studies that explore the long-term effects and efficacy of
multidisciplinary interventions, as well as the development of standardized protocols to
ensure more consistent and effective management of these complex eating disorders in
children with FAs.

5. Conclusions

This comprehensive review highlights the intricate interplay between ARFID, food
neophobia, and FAs in pediatric patients, underscoring the significant challenges they pose
to healthcare providers and families alike. The findings emphasize the critical need for

Nutrients 2024, 16, 3034

early identification and multidisciplinary intervention to mitigate the profound impacts
these conditions can have on a child’s growth, development, and overall well-being.

The role of nurses in these teams is central and multifaceted, encompassing early

identification, care coordination, direct patient support, and education for families.

Effective management of ARFID and food neophobia, particularly in the context
of FAs, requires an integrated approach that combines psychological, nutritional, and
medical care, with a central role for nurses in both clinical and community settings. The
review also identifies key gaps in current literature, including the need for standardized
treatment protocols and more extensive research on the long-term outcomes of these
disorders. Future efforts should focus on refining therapeutic strategies, enhancing family
support systems, and expanding the role of healthcare professionals in addressing these
complex and multifaceted conditions to improve the quality of life for affected children
and their families.
