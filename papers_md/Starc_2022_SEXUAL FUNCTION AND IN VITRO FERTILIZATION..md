SUMMARY – The aim of the study was to investigate the sexuality of individuals undergoing in 
vitro fertilization as one of the methods of infertility treatment. The focus was on sexual dysfunction, 
sexual  satisfaction  and  associated  risk  factors.  Data  were  collected  based  on  a  validated,  standard-
ized procedure. The sample consisted of 119 individuals who had undergone in vitro fertilization, 61 
(51.3%) women and 58 (48.7%) men, average age 35 years. Most of the 119 survey participants were in 
the 31-35 age group (37%), married (79.8%), with high school diploma (51.3%), Catholic denomina-
tion (89.9%), childless (78.2%), with a one sexual partner in their lifetime (51.3%), and in current sex-
ual relationship for a period of 7 to 8 years (18.5%). The survey found statistically significantly higher 
satisfaction among male participants, participants in the 26-30 age group, those with a higher level of 
education, nonreligious, without children in marriage, with four sexual partners in life, over a period 
of 1 to 2 years in current partner (sexual) relationship, and without a diagnosed sexual disorder. There 
was a correlation between infertility, associated treatment, and sexuality. Infertility and involvement in 
treatment procedures increased the risk of sexual dysfunction. The risk factors identified in our study 
could help facilitate detection and timely treatment of sexual dysfunction, which would help maintain 
healthy sexuality in couples participating in in vitro fertilization procedures. 

Key words: Infertility; In vitro fertilization; Sexual function; Sexual dysfunction; Sexual satisfaction

Introduction

The  desire  to  have  offspring  is  one  of  the  basic 
human  desires1.  It  is  estimated  that  approximately 
15%  of  couples  worldwide  have  difficulty  fulfilling

this desire due to infertility. Infertility is defined as 
a medical condition that prevents a couple from be-
coming pregnant after one year of unprotected, reg-
ular sexual intercourse and is considered one of the 
global  public  health  problems2,3.  Although  in  vitro 
fertilization (IVF) procedures are becoming increas-
ingly popular due to the growing number of infertile 
couples4, the authors of many studies point out their 
downsides.  Namely,  the  procedures  are  accused  of

causing  many  inconveniences  in  the  physical,  psy-
chological, social, and also economic spheres. These 
are  associated  with  negative  effects  on  the  couples’ 
quality of life, their relationships, and ultimately sex-
uality5-9,  which  is  why,  according  to  a  study  by  Pe-
dro et al.10, 29.5% of couples discontinue treatment 
before achieving success. In the context of sexuality, 
the procedure is accused of compromising privacy of 
the  couple  by  involving  a  third  party  in  their  inti-
mate life. This primarily involves health profession-
als needed for diagnostic and treatment procedures, 
but  also  germ  cell  donors  if  needed.  Disclosure  of 
one’s sexuality causes a sense of ‘surveillance’ and de-
stroys self-esteem, which in turn negatively impacts 
sexuality6. The loss of spontaneity and relaxation in 
sexual intercourse that occurs when it is ‘instructed’ 
by medical professionals to achieve the desired result 
is another area that threatens the sexuality of these 
couples11. These are just two of the many factors cited 
in the literature that make sexuality uncomfortable, 
forced, and self-centered12. As a result, it is severely 
compromised, as confirmed by participants in stud-
ies reporting numerous sexual dysfunctions13-15.

Another area they face is pressure from the soci-
ety and family members7-9,16. In their study, Monga 
et  al.11 found  that  83%  of  couples  who  participated 
in  treatment  processes  experienced  social  and  fam-
ily pressures related to conception. Questions about 
their  desire  to  have  children  and  the  outcome  of 
treatment usually cause them stress with feelings of 
guilt about their infertility and feelings of inferior-
ity  compared  to  couples  with  children7,8,16.  Women 
are thought to be more vulnerable to pressure than 
men,  especially  in  cultures  where  women  without 
children  are  stigmatized,  often  resulting  in  a  shat-
tered self-image and troubled identity7,16,17.To avoid 
problems, couples often avoid social contact and iso-
late themselves8,9. Pregnant women and couples with 
children  are  described  as  their  additional  burden7, 
which can also be the source of envy18,19 .

Studies also point out the inconvenience associ-
ated  with  performing  the  procedure5,8,16.  From  de-
scription of the course, it appears that it consists of 
treatments,  including  various  procedures  and  med-
ications  with  their  side  effects  which  cause  pain  in 
couples, especially women, due to the nature of the 
procedure,  which  is  quite  invasive.  Follicular  punc-
ture is highlighted as the most painful and uncom-

fortable part of the procedure8,16. Establishing a con-
fidential  relationship  with  health  care  professionals 
and the economic burden, especially when the pro-
cedures are not publicly funded, are described as two 
other concerns of these couples7,9,16.

They  also  highlight  shortening  of  the  mar-
riage duration as a problem area7,11,17. In a study by 
Drosdzol  and  Skrzypulec20,  10.11%  of  women  and 
11.65%  of  men  reported  that  infertility  diagnosis 
and related treatment led to the breakdown of their 
marriage. Other studies report a higher number or a 
34% decrease in marital satisfaction among women 
and 50% decrease among men21,22. The possible rea-
sons include the way partners experience themselves 
and  each  other  at  the  time  of  diagnosis  and  treat-
ment,  the  emergence  of  partner-centered  conflict 
with the cause of infertility due to the imposition of 
guilt,  a  lack  of  intimacy  with  the  feeling  that  third 
parties are involved in their relationship, and a lack 
of mutual support or even discontinuation of treat-
ment in one of the partners6,8,9. A failed marriage is 
more common among couples undergoing donor cell 
treatment23 and is one of the main reasons why cou-
ples discontinue treatment5,24.

Sexual  dysfunction  in  couples  treated  with  IVF 
procedures  is  a  relatively  new  topic  that  has  only 
recently  been  studied  in  the  scientific  literature6. 
Some of these studies, with their main findings on 
the nature and frequency of sexual dysfunction, are 
listed in Table 1, which also shows the worse sexual 
status compared to the general population. It is es-
timated  that  participation  in  treatment  procedures 
increases  the  risk  of  sexual  dysfunction  compared 
with  a  diagnosis  of  infertility  alone13,25.  In  a  study 
by  Bayar et al. 25,  the  proportion  of  sexual  dysfunc-
tion increased with participation in treatment pro-
cedures from 60% to 72% among women and from 
34%  to  48%  among  men  compared  with  the  pro-
portion at the time of infertility diagnosis. Physical 
pain and discomfort8,15,16 and psychological pressure 
related  to  the  procedure  itself  and  the  outcome  of 
treatment8,26  are  assessed  as  components  that  con-
tribute  to  sexuality  not  being  perceived  by  couples 
as  something  pleasurable  and  unifying,  but  rather 
associated  with  something  negative,  forced,  oblig-
atory,  stressful,  burdensome,  and  self-centered12, 
leading to it being best avoided27.

Methodology 

Results 

Surveyed 70 women who became 
pregnant under the IVF procedure 
and 75 women in control group who 
became pregnant naturally.

Women from the IVF group reported statistically 
significantly more sexual dysfunction in the first 
trimester compared to the control group (p<0.05). 
A statistically significant difference was found in 
the following sexual dysfunctions: arousal disorders 
(p=0.031), poorer sexual satisfaction (p=0.029), and 
pain associated with sexual dysfunction (p=0.004).

269 women involved in IVF 
proceedings were interviewed.

At least one sexual dysfunction was noted in 81 
(30%) participants.

136 women interviewed who were 
currently or recently involved in IVF 
procedures.

The most commonly reported sexual dysfunctions 
were lack of sexual desire (30%), orgasm problems 
(15%), vaginal dryness (14%), and vaginismus (13%).

119 women involved in treatment 
process (45% in IVF procedures) and 
99 childbearing women as a control 
group.

Oskay et al.29

308 women involved in the treatment 
process and 308 women from the 
control group were interviewed.

Compared to 25% in the control group, 40% of 
women who participated in the treatment reported 
sexual dysfunction. Women in the treatment group 
had significantly lower sexual desire and arousal 
scores and were less likely to have sexual intercourse 
compared to the control group.

61.7% of women in the treatment group and 42.9% 
in the control group reported sexual dysfunction 
(p<0.001). Specific areas rated statistically lower by 
women in the treatment group were lack of sexual 
desire, arousal disorders, and orgasm problems 
(p<0.001). In addition, the frequency of sexual 
intercourse was significantly lower among women 
from the experimental group than in the control 
group (p=0.002).

18.1% of participants reported erectile dysfunction, of 
which 9.4% were mild, 5.1% mild to moderate, 1.4% 
moderate, and 0.7% severe.

Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction was noted in 
85.9% of men in the group who participated in IVF 
procedures. They also rated their orgasmic function 
(p=0.002), sexual desire (p=0.001), and sexual 
satisfaction (p=0.011) statistically significantly worse.

150 women and 119 men involved in 
treatment were interviewed (25.3% in 
IVF).

102 couples involved in IVF 
proceedings were interviewed.

Interviewed 93 couples involved in 
a treatment procedure (28% in IVF 
procedures) and 92 couples with a 
recent spontaneous pregnancy.

45 couples involved in IVF procedures 
were interviewed.

Sexual function and in vitro fertilization

Sexual dysfunction was noted in 11.3% of women.

Female participants reported vaginismus (66.7%), 
anorgasmia (46.1%), and low sexual satisfaction 
(37.3%), while men reported premature ejaculation 
(61.8%), low sexual satisfaction (33.3%), and erectile 
dysfunction (24.5%).

Couples involved in the treatment process showed 
lower sexual satisfaction (p<0.0001 in men, p=0.0004 
in women). The lower sexual satisfaction in men was 
due to erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, 
and lack of sexual desire in themselves and their 
partner. In women, this was associated with lack of 
sexual desire, veganism, anorgasmia, and partner 
erectile dysfunction.

60% of women and 28.9% of men reported a lack 
of sexual desire; 40% of women and 17.8% of men 
reported arousal disorder; 31.1% of women and 8.9% 
of men reported difficulty reaching orgasm; 8.9% of 
women reported pain during sexual intercourse.

The aim of our study was to investigate sexuality 
of  individuals  undergoing  IVF  as  one  of  the  meth-
ods  of  infertility  treatment.  Our  study  differs  from 
the studies presented in Table 1 because we focused 
on sexual dysfunction and included more risk factors 
such as age, marital status, education, religious affili-
ation, number of children, number of lifetime sexual 
partners, and number of current sexual contacts.

Subjects and Methods

Ethical approval for the cross-national survey was 
obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Merkur 
University Hospital, Zagreb (03/1, 7078, 2020), and 
the research was conducted according to the princi-
ples of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants 
gave written informed consent before the study. The 
target  sample  were  infertile  couples  having  under-
gone  IVF  treatment  at  the  Department  of  in  Vitro 
Fertilization,  Merkur  University  Hospital,  Depart-
ment of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Division of Re-
productive Medicine, in the period from September 
2020 to January 2021. After an introductory written 
explanation of the purpose of the survey and signed 
consent to participate, 119 questionnaires were com-
pleted. After preliminary adjustment of the question 
on  the  number  of  years  and  months  in  the  current 
partnership  (sexual  relationship)  due  to  the  over-

whelming lack of responses on duration, all 119 com-
pleted  questionnaires  were  included  in  the  analysis. 
A validated New Sexual Satisfaction Scale (NSSS)32 
questionnaire was used with some adaptations to al-
low for completion of the gender questionnaire. Lin-
guistic validation of the questionnaire was based on 
translation from English to Croatian and vice versa. 
The questionnaire contained 31 questions for female 
participants  and  30  questions  for  male  participants, 
and roughly included two sets of questions. The first 
set of the questions contained demographic data (age, 
marital status, educational level, religion, sexual ori-
entation,  number  of  children,  number  of  all  sexual 
partners in life, duration of current partnership (sex-
ual  relationship),  diagnosed  mental  disorder  and/or 
sexual  disorder,  and  for  female  participants  also  the 
question about the number of orgasms during sexual 
intercourse. This  was  followed  by  the  second  set  of 
questions  consisting  of  20  statements  to  test  sexual 
satisfaction. A 5-point Likert scale was used, ranging 
from “not satisfied at all” to “very satisfied”.

Statistics 

The  data  obtained  were  analyzed  quantitative-
ly  using  SPSS  26.0  statistical  software  (Statistical 
Package  for  Social  Sciences,  Inc.,  USA),  the  Kolm-
ogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests to check the 
normality of data distribution. The tests showed nor-

mal  data  distribution.  Based  on  this  result,  the  fol-
lowing statistical tests were used: Pearson correlation 
coefficient  and  ANOVA  test  to  detect  statistically 
significant differences among more than three sam-
ples. The values of p<0.05 were considered statistical-
ly significant.

Results

After  preliminary  adjustment  of  the  question 
about the number of years and months in the current 
partnership  (sexual  relationship)  due  to  the  mostly 
missing  answers  about  duration,  all  119  completed 
questionnaires  were  included  in  the  analysis.  Six-
ty-one  (51.3%)  questionnaires  were  completed  by 
women and the remaining 58 (48.7%) by men. Most 
participants  were  in  the  31-35  age  group  (n=44; 
37%), followed by 36-40 (n=37; 31.1%), 26-30 (n=25; 
21.1%),  41-45  (n=10;  8.3%),  46-50  age  group  (n=2; 
1.6%),  and  one  (0.8%)  participant  in  the  51-55  age 
group.

(n=2;  1.7%),  and  one  (0.8%)  participant  who  was 
currently  completing  3rd  level  of  university  educa-
tion (Table 3).

Most participants identified themselves as Catho-
lics (n=107; 89.9%), followed by participants not be-
longing to any religious community, i.e., atheists (n=6; 
5.0%), Orthodox, Muslims, and 2 (1.7%) participants 
in the group who did not want to provide this infor-
mation.

All  participants  (n=119;  100%)  described  them-
selves as heterosexually oriented, meaning they had sex 
only with persons of the opposite sex.

The majority of participants were childless (n=93; 
78.2%),  22  (18.5%)  participants  had  one  child,  one 
participant (0.8%) had two children, and the remain-
ing three (2.5%) participants did not provide informa-
tion on the number of children.

Most participants had one sexual partner in their 
lifetime  (n=61;  51.3%),  13  (10.9%)  participants  had 
two sexual partners, 11 (9.2%) participants had three 
or five sexual partners, six (5.0%) participants had four 
sexual partners, five (4.2%) participants had 10 sexual 
partners each, and one participant had 21 sexual part-
ners. Four (3.4%) participants did not want to answer 
this question.

For current partner (sexual) relationship by number 
of years, the largest number of participants reported a 
7- to 8-year time span (n=22; 18.5%), followed by the 
groups of 9 to 10 years (n=21; 17.6%) ), 3 to 4 years 
(n=15; 12.8%), 5 to 6 years (n=14; 11.8%); the groups 
reporting 1 to 2 years and 11 to 12 years had the same 
proportion  of  participants  (n=12;  10.1%),  and  so  did 
the groups from 13 to 14 years and 15 to 16 years (n=6; 
5.0%), 17 to 18 years (n=4; 3.4%), 21 to 22 years (n=3; 
2.5%), 19 to 20 years (n=2; 1.7%), and 23 to 24 years 
(n=1;  0.8%).  One  participant  (0.8%)  did  not  answer 
this question (Table 4).

of marriage (four variables p<0.05) proved to be sta-
tistically significant predictors of sexual dysfunction 
and  sexual  dissatisfaction  in  our  participants.  We 
can  confirm  that  age,  religion,  number  of  children, 
number of all sexual partners in life, and duration of 
marriage  have  a  statistically  significant  impact  on 
the occurrence of sexual dysfunction and sexual dis-

None of our study subjects (n=119; 100%) partici-
pating in IVF procedures was diagnosed with a men-
tal disorder and the majority had not been diagnosed 
with sexual dysfunction (n=117, 98.3%); there were no 
missing  data,  i.e.,  only  two  (1.7%)  participants  were 
diagnosed with a sexual disorder. This was also includ-
ed in the analysis where correlations were sought. 

We asked female participants about the number of 
orgasms during intercourse. Most participants experi-
enced 1 orgasm during intercourse (n=48; 40.3%), 12 
(10.1%) participants experienced 2 to 3 orgasms, and 
one (0.8%) participant experienced 5 or more orgasms 
(Table 5).

activity (PV=4.48). Sexual satisfaction decreased with 
increasing age, so we can confirm a negative impact of 
increasing age on the occurrence of sexual dysfunction 
and sexual dissatisfaction. It appears that as couples are 
aging, their sexual activities are influenced by new re-
sponsibilities in their lives such as employment or in-
volvement in caring for their children and other family 
and social responsibilities.

Regarding religious affiliation, we found a statisti-
cally  significant  correlation  between  partner  onset  of 
sexual activity (F=2.479; p<0.048) and variety of sexual 
activity (F=2.620; p<0.039) (Table 7).

Participants who did not self-identify as religious 
were most satisfied with their partner’s initiation of 
sexual  activity  (PV=5.00)  and  the  variety  of  their 
sexual activity (PV=5.00). Participants with any re-
ligious affiliation scored lower on sexual satisfaction. 
On this basis, we can also confirm that any religious 
affiliation negatively affects a person’s sexuality and 
increases  the  risk  of  sexual  dysfunction  and  sexual 
dissatisfaction. This study is one of the few that ex-
amined the relationship between religion and sex in 
adults, and suggests that religion continues to play a 
large role in shaping sexual life33 .

Depending on the number of children, we found 
statistically  significant  correlations  with  the  fol-
lowing  variables:  intensity  of  orgasms  (F=3.116; 
p<0.048),  emotional  engagement  during  sexual  ac-
tivity (F=3.3000; p<0.040), showing partner’s emo-
tions  during  sexual  activity  (F=5.967;  p<0.003), 
partner’s  initiation  of  sexual  activity  (F=4.085; 
p<0.019),  partner  gives  the  subject  sexual  pleasure 
(F=4.561; p<0.012), the way the partner takes care 
of  the  subject’s  sexual  needs  (F=5.023;  p<0.008), 
variety  of  sexual  activities  (F=4.097;  p<0.019),  and 
frequency  of  sexual  activities  (F=4.015;  p<0.021) 
(Table 8).

Participants  without  children,  compared  to  those 
with one or two children, were more satisfied with the 
intensity of orgasms (PV=4.24), their emotional engage-
ment  during  sexual  activity  (PV=4.23),  showing  their 
partner’s feelings during sexual activity (PV=4.28), the 
onset of their partner(s)’ sexual activity (PV=4.03), their 
partner(s)’  commitment  to  sexual  pleasure  (PV=4.35), 
the  way  the  partner  takes  care  of  the  subject’s  sexual 
needs (PV=4.32), the variety (PV=3.86) and frequency 
(PV=3.92)  of  their  sexual  activity.  Based  on  these  re-
sults, we can confirm that having children in marriage 
increases  the  risk  of  sexual  dysfunction  and  decreases 
the couple’s sexual satisfaction.

Regarding the number of sexual partners through-
out  life,  the  ANOVA  test  showed  a  statistically  sig-
nificant correlation with focus on the subject’s sexual 
activity (F=2.567; p<0.008) (Table 9).

partners  in  life  (PV=3.62)  were  least  satisfied.  With 
greatest  dissatisfaction  falling  outside  the  range  as-
sumed to be a protective zone for a lower risk of sexual 
dysfunction and sexual dissatisfaction, with the great-
est sexual satisfaction falling within the interval itself, 
we can confirm that fewer than three and more than 
five lifetime sexual partners increase the risk of sexual 
dysfunction and decrease sexual satisfaction.

The  ANOVA  test  also  found  correlations  of  the 
number  of  years  in  the  current  (sexual)  partnership 
with  the  following  variables:  mood  after  sexual  ac-
tivity  (F=2.600;  p<0.006),  balance  between  what  the 
subject gives and receives in sexual activity (F=2.119; 
p<0.025),  partner’s  giving  himself  to  sexual  pleasures 
(F=2.117; p<0.025), and partner being sexually avail-
able (F=2.315; p<0.014) (Table 10).

Participants  in  the  current  partner  (sexual)  re-

their  mood  after  sexual  activity  (PV=4.75),  balance 
between  what  they  give  and  receive  during  sexual 
activity (PV=4, 50), partner’s commitment to sexual 
pleasure  (PV=4.83),  and  partner’s  sexual  availability 
(PV=4.75). With prolongation of the current partner 
(sexual) relationship, the participants’ sexual satisfac-
tion decreased, which allows us to confirm that with 
the duration of a partner (sexual) relationship, sexual 
dysfunction is more frequent and sexual satisfaction 
decreases.

Statistically  significant  correlations  were  record-
ed  of  gender  and  the  following  variables:  intensity 
of  sexual  arousal  (F=4.548;  p<0.035),  during  sex-
ual  activity  the  subject  indulges  in  sexual  pleasure 
(F=4.031;  p<0.047),  partner’s  ability  to  orgasm 
(F=14.193; p<0.001), partner indulges in sexual plea-

sure (F=4.623; p<0.034), and partner being sexually

The final results of our gender-related study showed 
greater  satisfaction  among  male  participants  with 
their  intensity  of  sexual  arousal  (PV=4.33)  and  their 
engagement  in  sexual  pleasure  during  sexual  activi-
ty  (PV=4.31),  whereas  female  participants  expressed 
greater satisfaction with their partner’s ratings of their 
orgasmic  ability  (PV=4.33),  partner’s  engagement  in 
sexual pleasure (PV=4.41), and partner’s sexual avail-
ability (PV=4.28). 

Female  participants’  satisfaction  ratings  were 
associated  with  better  position  in  orgasmic  ability, 
commitment to sexual pleasure, and sexual availabil-
ity, while male participants self-reported greater sat-
isfaction with intensity of sexual arousal and sexual 
pleasure. We cannot confirm that sexual dysfunction 
and  sexual  dissatisfaction  affect  women  and  men 
equally.

Correlations  were  also  found  between  the  lev-
el  of  education  and  the  following  variables:  balance 
between  what  the  subject  gives  and  receives  during 
sexual  activity  (F=2.641;  p<0.027),  onset  of  partner’s 
sexual  activity  (F=2.562;  p<0.031),  the  way  the  part-
ner indulges in sexual pleasure (F=2.231; p<0.056), the 
way the partner takes care of the subject’s sexual needs 
(F=2.786;  p<0.056),  partner  being  sexually  creative

Discussion 

Participants who completed high school were most 
satisfied with the balance between what they give and 
receive during sexual activity (PV=4.13), their partner’s 
initiation of sexual activity (PV=4.11), their partner’s 
sexual creativity (PV=4.20), and the way their partner 
responded to their sexual needs (PV=4.39); those with 
completed  higher  education  expressed  their  highest 
satisfaction with their partner’s engagement in sexual 
pleasure (PV=4.50) and the variety of their sexual ac-
tivities (PV=4.00), while those with completed 1st level 
higher  education  expressed  their  greatest  satisfaction 
with  sexual  availability  of  the  partner(s)  (PV=4.35). 
In  our  study,  participants  who  completed  secondary 
school  to  1st  level  of  university  education  expressed 
their higher sexual satisfaction than those who com-
pleted primary school or 2nd and 3rd level of university 
education. We cannot confirm that sexual dysfunction 
and sexual dissatisfaction are equally reported by indi-
viduals with low levels of education.

The influences of gender and age, educational lev-
el,  religious  affiliation,  number  of  children,  number 
of  all  lifetime  sexual  partners,  and  duration  of  mar-
riage were found to be statistically significant for the 
occurrence  of  sexual  dysfunction  and  sexual  dissat-
isfaction  in  individuals  who  underwent  IVF  proce-
dures.  Factors  that  had  a  particularly  negative  effect 
on  sexuality  in  our  study  were  female  age,  older  age, 
low  (completed  primary  school)  and  very  high  edu-
cation level (2nd and 3rd university level), any religious 

affiliation, children in marriage, two or six sexual part-
ners  in  life,  and  longer  duration  of  marriage,  while 
male  gender,  age  26-30  years,  religious  insecurity, 
no  children  in  marriage,  four  sexual  partners  in  life, 
and 1-2 years of marriage duration were found to be 
statistically  significant  factors  for  sexual  satisfaction. 
A  correlation  was  found  between  diagnosed  sexu-
al  dysfunction  and  partner’s  ability  to  reach  orgasm 
(F=5.351; p<0.022) (Table 13).

Participants  without  a  diagnosed  sexual  disorder 
expressed  statistically  significantly  more  satisfaction 
with their partner’s ability to reach orgasm (PV=4.22), 
which may confirm the assumption that a diagnosed 
sexual disorder decreases sexual satisfaction.

In a study by Smith et al.14 , women who had par-
ticipated in IVF treatment in the past year or were cur-
rently in the IVF program reported significantly lower 
desire  for  sexual  activity,  greater  difficulty  achieving 
orgasm,  less  frequent  sexual  activity,  vaginal  cramp-
ing, lower sexual satisfaction, and poorer overall sexual 
function  compared  with  the  control  group. This  was 
similar to a study by Yangin et al.15, except for the fact 
that they included male participants who were found 
to have erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and 
low sexual satisfaction. The same sexual dysfunction in 
both sexes was also found in a study by Shoji et al.13. 
The presence of sexual dysfunction has been associated 
with treatment success in individuals participating in 
IVF procedures14. 

Other  studies  point  to  a  number  of  sexual  issues 
faced by couples participating in IVF procedures5-9,16. 
Luca et al.6 highlight the feeling of losing control and 
dealing with many uncertainties. They relate the sense 
of loss of control to fertility and life itself. When cou-
ples ‘leave’ their fertility to medical personnel, they feel 
they lose control over it. Men associate their fertility 
only with the role of ‘sperm donor’ and women with 
a ‘tool’ to have children. They associate the feeling of 
losing control of their lives with their entire lives being 
focused  on  the  procedure  itself,  including  a  disrupt-

ed daily routine due to frequent doctor visits, as also 
reported by other research participants8,9. Waiting for 
treatment outcome after embryo transfer is described 
as  one  of  the  most  uncertain  and  stressful  situations 
they experience8,35. Uncertainty exists both in the case 
of a negative outcome with concerns about the future 
of their treatment and in the case of a positive outcome 
with concerns about the future course of the pregnan-
cy8,9,36. A negative outcome is described by participants 
as one of the most frustrating and painful disappoint-
ments in life8.

In  the  context  of  marriage,  the  authors  highlight 
the changes in sexual function as one of the important 
aspects but believe that not enough attention is paid 
to them6,21,26,27. If we look only at the Slovenian data-
base with the keyword “sexual dysfunction and in vitro 
fertilization”, in the two largest databases, i.e., Cobiss.
si and DiKUL, there are actually no hits, which is sur-
prising  considering  that  in  Slovenia  about  5%  of  all 
children born per year are born through these proce-
dures, indicating their mass use4. The negative effects 
of infertility treatment with IVF procedures on sexu-
al function are mainly attributed to the stress caused 
by the inability to become pregnant26, particularly the 
loss of spontaneity and relaxation during sexual inter-
course11,  to  the  negative  impact  of  treatment  proce-
dures on physical and emotional well-being15, and to 
pressure from family members and society11,29. There-
fore,  it  is  important  to  maintain  healthy  sexuality  in 
these  couples  by  identifying  sexual  dysfunction  in  a 
timely manner and responding appropriately21. 

Couples  undergoing  IVF  treatment  are  likely  to 
have  problems  with  their  sexual  health.  Psychological 
problems  such  as  depression,  anxiety,  or  the  percep-
tion of infertility as ‘nervous tension’ may contribute to 
sexual problems. In addition, problems such as vaginal 
dryness and tightness, pain during intercourse, and anx-
iety  about  sexual  performance  should  be  known  and 
addressed  throughout  fertility  treatment.  Clinicians 
and all medical personnel involved in fertility treatment 
should be more sensitive to the need of infertile couples, 
especially women, for emotional support. Depending on 
the risk factors identified in our study, couples should be 
offered counseling and psychological support.

Cilj  istraživanja  bio  je  ispitati  seksualnost  osoba  koje  liječe  neplodnost  postupcima  izvantjelesne  oplodnje.  Naglasak 
istraživanja bio je na seksualnoj disfunkciji, seksualnom zadovoljstvu i povezanim čimbenicima rizika. Podaci su prikupljeni 
na osnovi validiranog i standardiziranog upitnika. Uzorak je činilo 119 ispitanika koji su liječeni postupcima izvantjelesne 
oplodnje, 61 (51,3%) žena i 58 (48,7%) muškaraca, prosječne dobi od 35 godina. Većina od 119 ispitanika spadali su u dobnu 
skupinu od 31-35 godina (37%), bili su oženjeni (79,8%), sa završenom srednjom školom (51,3%), katoličke vjeroispovijesti 
(89,9%), bez djece (78,2%), s jednim seksualnim partnerom u životu (51,3%) i u trenutnoj seksualnoj vezi koja traje 7 do 
8 godina (18,5%). Istraživanjem je utvrđeno značajno veće zadovoljstvo kod muškaraca, ispitanicima u dobnoj skupini od 
26-30 godina, s višim stupnjem naobrazbe, agnostika, bez djece u braku, s 4 seksualna partnera u životu, u sadašnjoj partner-
skoj (seksualnoj) vezi duže od 1-2 godine i bez dijagnosticiranog seksualnog poremećaja. Dokazana je povezanost između 
neplodnosti, liječenja i seksualnosti. Neplodnost i postupci liječenja neplodnosti povećavaju rizik za seksualnu disfunkciju. 
Rizični čimbenici koji su utvrđeni u našem istraživanju mogu pomoći pravodobnom otkrivanju i liječenju seksualne disfunk-
cije, što će omogućiti zdrave seksualne odnose parova koji se liječe postupcima izvantjelesne oplodnje.

Ključne riječi: Neplodnost; Izvantjelesna oplodnja; Seksualna funkcija; Seksualna disfunkcija; Seksualno zadovoljstvo
