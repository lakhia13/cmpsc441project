  Insomnia  disorder  is  characterized  by  chronic  dissatisfaction  with  sleep  quantity  or  quality 

that is associated with diﬃ  culty falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakenings with diﬃ  culty 

returning to sleep, and/or awakening earlier in the morning than desired. Although progress 

has been made in our understanding of the nature, etiology, and pathophysiology of insomnia, 

there is still no universally accepted model. Greater understanding of the pathophysiology of 

insomnia may provide important information regarding how, and under what conditions, the 

disorder develops and is maintained as well as potential targets for prevention and treatment. 

The aims of this report are (1) to summarize current knowledge on the pathophysiology of 

insomnia and (2) to present a model of the pathophysiology of insomnia that considers evi-

dence from various domains of research. Working within several models of insomnia, evidence 

for the pathophysiology of the disorder is presented across levels of analysis, from genetic to 

molecular and cellular mechanisms, neural circuitry, physiologic mechanisms, sleep behavior, and 

self-report. We discuss the role of hyperarousal as an overarching theme that guides our concep-

tualization of insomnia. Finally, we propose a model of the pathophysiology of insomnia that

integrates the various types of evidence presented.

insomnia,  6 , 10 - 12   there is still no universally accepted model. 
Th  is may be related to the heterogeneity of insomnia, 
its highly comorbid nature, or diff erences in what level 
of analysis the models use, from phenomenology to 
physiology. To be comprehensive, an etiologic or 
pathophysiologic model of insomnia should explain 
features such as the heterogeneity of symptoms and the 
risk insomnia confers for other comorbid conditions, 
such as depression and cardiometabolic syndrome. It 
should also explain the discrepancy between subjective 
(self-report) and objective (polysomnography [PSG]) 
measures of insomnia symptoms reported by some 
individuals with insomnia (see Reference  13  for a review). 
Greater understanding of the pathophysiology of 
insomnia may provide important information regarding 
how, and under what conditions, the disorder develops 
as well as potential targets for prevention and treatment. 
Th  e aims of this review are (1) to summarize current 
breadth of knowledge on the pathophysiology of 
insomnia and (2) to present a model of the pathophysi-
ology of insomnia that draws on evidence from various 
domains. Our article is intended to provide a brief 
overview of these topics for clinicians and researchers 
whose main focus is not insomnia. More extensive 
reviews of this topic can be found elsewhere.  12 , 14 , 15   Our 
article is primarily informed by perspectives drawn from 
psychology, psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience.  

 Levels of Analysis: An Approach to 
Understanding Insomnia 
 Although evidence-based assessments and treatments 
for mental disorders have been developed, diagnostic 
criteria for these conditions—including insomnia—are 
grounded in clinical consensus.  16   Further progress depends 
on better understanding the etiology and pathophysiology 
of mental health problems. One framework for doing 
this has been off ered by the National Institute of Mental 
Health’s “Research Domain Criteria” initiative. While 
recognizing the value of current diagnostic categories, 
the National Institute of Mental Health has begun to 
emphasize observable “domains” of brain function 
pertinent to mental health. Th  ese research domains, 
such as positive emotion, negative emotion, and arousal, 
often show similar patterns of dysregulation across 
traditional diagnostic categories and can be examined 
across levels of analysis from genes to symptoms. Th  ese 
points pertain to insomnia as well. Th  e fi rst two editions 
of the  International Classifi cation of Sleep Disorders  
introduced  .  25 diagnoses with “insomnia” as a 
cardinal symptom,  2 , 17   but evidence for the reliability, 
validity, and distinct pathophysiology of these insomnia 

phenotypes has proved elusive. Partially as a conse-
quence of this, both the  International Classifi cation of 
Sleep Disorders ,  Th  ird Edition   18   and  Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders ,  Fift h 
Edition ,  1   now propose a single major category for 
Insomnia Disorder or Chronic Insomnia Disorder. 
Nevertheless, there remains an impetus for the fi eld to 
develop an evidence-based model of insomnia that 
accounts for heterogeneity in cause, symptoms, course, 
comorbidities, and consequences. Th  is review considers 
evidence across seven levels of analysis based on the 
Research Domain Criteria framework: genetic, molecular, 
cellular, neuroanatomic, physiologic, behavioral, and 
self-report.   

 Hyperarousal: An Overarching Th  eme 
 Insomnia is often considered to be a disorder of 
hyperarousal,  19   or increased somatic, cognitive, and 
cortical activation.  20 , 21   Individuals with insomnia may 
experience physiologic hyperarousal in both central 
(cortical) and peripheral (autonomic) nervous systems 
(see References  20 ,  22 ,  23  for full review). Hyperarousal 
in insomnia can also refer to cognitive and emotional 
processes, with several theories suggesting that cognitive 
and aff ective hyperarousal at bedtime may contribute 
to both acute and chronic insomnia.  24 , 25   Despite the 
frequent attention to hyperarousal in the literature, it is 
not frequently defi ned. In this report we conceptualize 
hyperarousal as heightened physiologic, aff ective, or 
cognitive activity, which interferes with the natural 
“disengagement from […] the environment”  26   and 
decreases the likelihood of sleep. Hyperarousal may be 
detected using such measures as increased cortisol, heart 
rate variability, EEG, or even self-report (eg, “I can’t turn 
off  my mind,” “I feel so keyed up”). One of the challenges 
in identifying hyperarousal is that an individual always 
has some level of arousal, and the exact threshold for 
categorizing hyperarousal is not well defi ned. Th  us, most 
studies have identifi ed hyperarousal by noting diff erences 
between insomnia and control groups, rather than 
denoting a specifi c threshold.  27   We propose hyperarousal 
as an overarching theme that, along with other contribu-
tory factors, enriches our understanding of the patho-
physiology of insomnia at each level of analysis and 
across levels in an integrated model.   

 Genetics of Sleep and Insomnia 
 Sleep-wake traits, such as sleep duration and timing, are 
heritable  28   and regulated by numerous genes.  29   Animal 
and human studies also implicate genetic mechanisms 
in the etiology of insomnia. Seugnet et al  30   isolated

insomnia-like  Drosophila  fl ies (ins-1 fl ies) with rest-
activity traits that resemble human insomnia, includ-
ing decreased rest time, increased latency to a resting 
state aft er lights out, greater fragmentation of rest periods, 
and heightened activity levels. Whole-genome transcript 
profi ling of ins-1 fl ies identifi ed 755 genes with human 
homologs that were diff erentially expressed compared 
with wild-type fl ies. Genes found to be conserved in 
ins-1 flies are associated with sensory perception, 
metabolism, cell surface signaling, and neuronal activity 
and may have implications for understanding the 
genetics of human insomnia. 

 Most genetic studies in humans have used a limited set of 
self-report items to categorize insomnia symptom pheno-
types and yielded a wide range in heritability estimates 
for insomnia (h 2   5  0-81%) across family history and 
twin studies.  31 - 33   Studies using more stringent criteria to 
defi ne insomnia have produced more realistic and reliably 
modest h 2  estimates ranging from 31% to 58%.  32 , 34 , 35   
Candidate gene studies have identifi ed gene variants that 
may be involved in the pathophysiology of insomnia, 
including Apo ε 4,  36   PER3 4/4 ,  37   HLA DQB1   *   0602,  38   
homozygous Clock gene 3111C/C Clock,  39   and short (s-) 
allele of the 5-HTTLPR.  40   A genomewide association 
study found numerous single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) signifi cantly associated with insomnia 
symptoms.  41   Th  e most signifi cant SNPs occurred 
within genes involved in neuroplasticity (eg, ROR1, 
PLCB1, EPHA4, and CACNA1A), stress reactivity 
(eg, STK39, USP25, and MARP10), neuronal excitability 
(eg, GABRB1 and DLG2), and mental health (eg, NPAS3).  41   

 Overall, current evidence suggests signifi cant heritability 
and multigene involvement in the pathophysiology of 
insomnia. Genes linked to brain functioning, arousal 
regulation, and sleep-wake processes have been most 
consistently found to be associated with insomnia. Th  e 
complex interplay of these genes may account, at least in 
part, for the heterogeneity observed in insomnia 
symptoms and consequences. Future genetic studies 
with detailed assessment of sleep and health history of 
patients with chronic insomnia disorder may further 
refi ne our understanding of genetic factors involved in 
the development and characteristics of insomnia.   

 Molecular Mechanisms of Sleep and Insomnia 
 Numerous sleep regulatory substances are linked to 
circadian rhythmicity and sleep regulation. Although 
recognizing the oversimplification,  42   we argue that 
endogenous molecules can be categorized as primarily 
wake-promoting/sleep-suppressing (eg, catecholamines, 

orexin, and histamine) and sleep-promoting/wake-
suppressing substances (eg,  g -aminobutyric acid [GABA], 
adenosine, serotonin, melatonin, prostaglandin D2).  43   
Very few molecular studies have been conducted in 
insomnia and have focused on only a limited set of 
molecules (eg, cortisol and GABA).  Table 1  lists studies 
linking various molecules to insomnia.  41 , 44 - 55     Findings 
are mixed across studies, and no consistent pattern for a 
specifi c type of molecule (sleep vs wake promoting) has 
emerged. Despite contradictory evidence,  52   results have 
largely been interpreted within the context of the 
hyperarousal hypothesis. For example, increased  45   and 
decreased  46   GABA in the occipital cortex of patients 
with insomnia have been reported to be consistent with 
the hyperarousal model of insomnia. However, sleep 
regulatory molecules interact with each other in 
complex ways (described in more detail later), and many 
of their eff ects are dependent on the milieu of the brain 
state; that is, they are state-dependent. Th  ese factors 
make it highly unlikely that all cases of insomnia can be 
explained by alterations in any single type of molecule 
(eg, hyperarousal-related). A more sophisticated 
conceptualization holds that chronic insomnia results 
from disintegration of the alternating rhythms 
of wake-promoting and sleep-regulatory molecules 
in the brain.  56   Constant routine, in-home PSG, and 
sleep-deprivation studies, particularly those that 
examine wake- and sleep-promoting molecules (or 
their mRNA and associated micro-RNA) during 
diff erent states across the 24-h day, may prove fruitful in 
elucidating the molecular underpinnings of chronic 
insomnia. In addition, studies that more fully link this 
level of analysis with the genetic underpinnings are also 
needed.       

 Cellular Mechanisms of Sleep and Insomnia 
 Many of the molecules involved in sleep-wake regula-
tion are produced by specifi c brain structures with 
widespread projections throughout the brain. Th  ere is, 
however, mounting evidence that many sleep regulatory 
molecules aff ect neurons locally, in the regions in which 
they are produced. In local sleep theory proposed by 
Krueger et al,  57   sleep is defined as a fundamental 
emergent property of highly interconnected neurons, or 
cortical columns. Local sleep propensity and slow wave 
amplitude are posited to be dependent on accumulation 
of sleep-regulatory substances (eg, tumor necrosis 
factor- a  and IL-1 b )  58 , 59   resulting from prior neuronal 
use. Synchronous firing within cortical columns is 
postulated to propagate slow wave activity in adjacent 
regions through humoral and electric interactions,

leading eventually to a “global” sleep state in the entire 
organism. 

 From this perspective, insomnia may not be a “whole-
brain” event (ie, a simple matter of imbalance between 
global amounts of sleep and wake). An animal model of 
insomnia has demonstrated simultaneous localized Fos 
activation in both sleep-promoting and wake-promoting 
regions during global sleep.  60   In humans, spectral 
EEG methods have identified heightened regional 
electrical brain activity in patients with insomnia during 
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.  61 , 62   Merica et al  61   
proposed that the lack of objective sleep disruption in 
many patients with insomnia may be due to isolated 
neuronal groups remaining active during PSG-defi ned 
sleep. Th  is dynamic in the brain may be experienced as 
wakefulness by many patients with insomnia and 
miscategorized as “normal” sleep based on standard 
PSG criteria.  63   Advances in neuroimaging technology 
would be needed to determine whether insomnia is 
associated with a distributed pattern of wakefulness 
at the neuronal level or is better characterized by a 
region-specifi c persistence of wake-like brain activity 
during globally defi ned EEG sleep more consistent with 
the next level of analysis.  64     

 Sleep-Wake Regulation and Neural Circuitry 
of Sleep 
 On the global level, sleep is regulated by coordinated 
wake and sleep brain networks. Insomnia may plausibly 
involve dysregulation within these networks.  

 Wake Systems and Hyperarousal in Insomnia 

 Th  e major wake-promoting systems of the brain 
include the “bottom-up” reticular activating system, 
limbic networks, and the “top-down” cognitive 
systems. Neural systems originating in the brainstem, 
thalamus, and hypothalamus  65 - 67   constitute the ascending 
reticular activating system. Th  is system projects to the 
cortex via the thalamus and basal forebrain and 
includes cholinergic pedunculopontine and laterodor-
sal tegmental nuclei, noradrenergic locus coeruleus 
nuclei, serotoninergic dorsal and median raphe nuclei, 
the parabrachial nucleus, the histaminergic tuber-
omammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus 
(TMN), and basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei. 
Orexin/hypocretin neurons of the lateral hypothal-
amus project to all of the arousal-promoting centers in 
the brainstem and hypothalamus and reinforce their 
activity. Emotional and cognitive systems can enhance

monoaminergic expression and lead to suppression of 
sleep-promoting regions such as the ventrolateral 
preoptic area (VLPO). Inputs to the arousal system 
may suppress the fi ring of VLPO neurons, disinhibit-
ing the orexin/hypocretin and TMN neurons and 
thereby opposing sleep pressure. 

 During initiation of normal sleep, arousal systems are 
down-regulated by inhibition from the VLPO and median 
preoptic area (MnPO). Th  e activation of arousal centers 
at the end of the sleep period is suffi  cient to terminate 
sleep. Activity of arousal systems (eg, cortisol) respon-
sible for alertness is modulated by the circadian timing 
system.  68 , 69   Insomnia is oft en considered a disorder of 
excessive activation of the arousal systems of the brain 
(ie, hyperarousal).  19   Hyperarousal in the physiologic, 
emotional, or cognitive networks is believed to prevent 
sleep regulatory processes from naturally occurring in 
patients with insomnia (see References  20 ,  22 - 25 ). 
However, other evidence suggests that hyperarousal is 
neither necessary nor suffi  cient for the development 
of chronic insomnia. For example, many patients with 
insomnia show no signs of cardiovascular, body tempera-
ture, or cortisol marker of hyperarousal,  52   and not all 
individuals with these common markers of hyperarousal 
develop insomnia.   

 Sleep Systems: Two-Process Model of Sleep 
Regulation 

 Th  e activity of arousal and sleep centers described above 
is modulated by two critical physiologic processes: 
wake-dependent (homeostatic) sleep drive and circadian 
rhythmicity. Th  ese two processes have been described in 
the two-process model and related conceptualizations, 
such as the opponent-process model of sleep-wake 
regulation.  70   According to the two-process model of sleep 
regulation,  71   sleep propensity is regulated by the interac-
tion of a wake-dependent process (process S) and a 
relatively wake-independent circadian process (process C). 
Process S dictates that greater brain use during wakeful-
ness increases sleep need and is measured by greater  u  
activity in the waking EEG  72 , 73   and higher amplitude 
EEG power in the  d  range (0.5-4.5 Hz) during NREM 
sleep.  58   On the network level, sleep onset is driven by 
activation of GABAergic and galanin neurons in the 
VLPO and MnPO.  65   Accumulation of extracellular 
adenosine during prior wakefulness has been posited as a 
primary input to these systems. Axons from VLPO/MnPO 
send outputs to arousal centers in the hypothalamus 
and brainstem, inhibiting arousal-promoting neurons 
of TMN, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and locus 

coeruleus while simultaneously promoting sleep. 
Circadian sleep propensity is regulated by intrinsic 
circadian oscillations governed by the suprachiasmatic 
nuclei of the hypothalamus. Exogenous light, melatonin, 
and social factors can infl uence the suprachiasmatic 
nuclei-regulated circadian processes in the body, such 
as REM sleep, body temperature, and endogenous 
melatonin. Optimal sleep is believed to occur when 
the S- and C-processes driving sleep are appropriately 
coordinated. 

 One hypothesis based on the two-process model is that 
insomnia results from insuffi  cient sleep propensity 
during the desired sleep period because of dysfunction 
in the S- or C-process. Evidence is mixed on whether 
patients with insomnia compared with control subjects 
have less robust slow wave activity following sleep 
deprivation suggestive of a defi ciency in process S.  74 - 76   
Evidence linking insomnia to markers of circadian 
dysfunction, including delayed or advanced core body 
temperature rhythms, or increased mean nocturnal core 
body temperature in diff erent insomnia phenotypes, 
suggest dysregulation of process C.  77   However, some 
studies failed to fi nd an association between core body 
temperature and insomnia.  52     

 Sleep Switch 

 Th  e mutually inhibitory circuitry of the VLPO and 
arousal centers of the brain is oft en described as a 
central “fl ip-fl op switch” regulating the activity of 
wake and sleep promoting systems to produce bistable 
sleep-wake states.  65 - 67   From this perspective, sleep and 
wake states are achieved via reciprocal inhibition 
between the VLPO/MnPO regions and monoamin-
ergic brainstem and hypothalamic arousal centers 
(see Reference  67  for review). Overriding the fl ip-fl op 
switch has been proposed as a mechanism of insomnia.  78   
Although maintaining heightened awareness in the 
presence of sleep debt may be necessary and benefi cial 
in rare times of crisis, insomnia may result from chronic 
coactivation of sleep and wake circuits during the 
desired sleep period. This conceptualization of 
insomnia is consistent with an animal study showing 
that the reciprocal inhibitory innervation between the 
VLPO and the arousal system can decouple under 
stressful conditions, resulting in a unique state with 
simultaneous sleep and wake features.  60   According to 
this model, the core feature of insomnia is not reduced 
sleep or excessive wakefulness but rather the simulta-
neous activation of brain structures responsible for each 
state.

 Other authors have proposed that insomnia is an 
unstable state in which individuals rapidly transition in 
and out of sleep-wake states (ie, a fl ickering switch). 
Individuals with greater subjective-objective sleep 
discrepancy may have more brief arousals from sleep 
(eg, Reference  79 ) and more frequent sleep-wake 
transitions during the sleep onset interval,  80   consistent 
with rapid switching between sleep and wake states.   

 Structural and Functional Neuroimaging 

 Although slow wave activity during NREM sleep is 
commonly believed to be global and homogeneous in 
the cerebrum, numerous studies have demonstrated that 
sleep is a dynamic process in space and time. Compared 
with a resting wake state, NREM sleep is associated with 
lower whole-brain metabolism, particularly in the cortical 
association areas.  81   More specifi cally, increased slow wave 
activity during NREM sleep corresponds with reduced 
cerebral blood fl ow globally but most strongly correlates 
with decreases in brain regions involved in adapting 
behavior to environmental pressures (ventrolateral 
prefrontal cortex), conscious processes (anterior cingulate, 
precuneus/upper cuneus, mediotemporal cortex), action 
selection (basal ganglia), and generation of slow oscilla-
tions during slow wave sleep (brainstem, midbrain, and 
thalamic structures).  82   Principal components analysis of 
PET scan data identifi ed two brain networks associated 
with sleep: (1) reduced blood fl ow in frontal and parietal 
association cortices and hippocampus, and increased 
fl ow in the cerebellum; and (2) reduced blood fl ow in 
the thalamus and a region that, on visual inspection, 
overlaps with the precuneus and cuneus.  83   

 Lesion and structural neuroimaging studies also suggest 
that specifi c brain regions may be associated with 
insomnia. Animal studies demonstrated that lesions of 
the thalamus,  84   raphe nucleus,  85   or mediobasal preoptic 
area  86   result in insomnia. von Economo  87   observed the 
sleep of patients aff ected by the encephalitis pandemic of 
1918, and these observations revealed an association 
between insomnia and lesions in the anterior hypothal-
amus. In addition, patients with traumatic brain injuries 
who endorse insomnia symptoms had overlapping lesions 
in the left  dorsomedial frontal cortex.  88   Structural imaging 
studies have identifi ed reduced gray matter volume in 
left  orbitofrontal, prefrontal, precuneus, and temporal 
cortices in patients with insomnia.  89 - 93   Th  ese structures 
may represent dysfunctional nodes in networks of sleep/
wake regulation. 

 Functional imaging studies suggest that patients with 
insomnia have smaller reductions in brain activity 

during NREM sleep relative to resting wake. Specifi cally, 
the frontoparietal cortex, medial temporal lobes, thalamus, 
anterior cingulate, precuneus, and brain stem arousal 
networks have been implicated.  94 , 95   Corsi-Cabrera et al  96   
also examined the topographic distribu tion of brain 
wave activity associated with wakefulness as an index 
of cortical activation during the sleep onset period 
among individuals with primary insomnia. Th  ey found 
higher  b  activity in left frontal and frontal midline 
regions during W and N1 and higher levels of temporal 
coupling linking the frontal, parietal, and posterior 
midline regions during the sleep onset period in 
primary insomnia as compared with control subjects. 
One overarching hypothesis is that the regional patterns 
of greater activation during sleep in patients with 
insomnia refl ects impaired deactivation and disengage-
ment of brain regions involved in executive control, 
attention, and self-awareness and may contribute to the 
experience of insomnia.  96      

 Electrophysiologic and Physiologic 
Dysregulation in Insomnia 
 Hyperarousal has been examined using various electro-
physiologic (EEG) and physiologic measures during 
sleep and wakefulness. EEG indicators of hyperarousal 
include increased high-frequency EEG activity ( b  and  g ), 
decreased  d  activity, and increased REM EEG arousals. 
As discussed later, physiologic measures include increased 
body temperature, skin resistance, metabolic rate, and 
heart rate, among others.  

 NREM Sleep Instability 

 Th  e Neurocognitive Model of insomnia posits that acute 
insomnia may be perpetuated by maladaptive behav-
ioral coping strategies and may develop into chronic 
insomnia as a result of conditioned arousal.  21   Conditioned 
arousal is the repeated association of sleep-related cues 
with wakefulness and/or arousal, which, over time, results 
in an arousal response when a sleep-related stimulus is 
presented.  97   Th  e neurocognitive model focuses specifi cally 
on cortical arousal as the mechanism underlying 
chronic insomnia, as indexed by high-frequency EEG 
activity ( b  and  g , 16-50 Hz). Th  is EEG activity is 
hypothesized to increase around sleep onset as a result 
of classic conditioning (ie, a learned response to cues 
associated with sleep). Data to support this hypothesis 
show diminished  d  and increased high-frequency NREM 
EEG power among patients with insomnia, as well as an 
association between high-frequency EEG activity and 
subjective sleep complaints.  98 , 99   High-frequency EEG

enhances sensory and information processing, which 
may contribute to the subjective-objective discrepancy 
that oft en characterizes insomnia.  21   Evidence is mixed 
regarding insomnia-control diff erences in high-frequency 
EEG activity during wakefulness.  72 , 100   However, high-
frequency waking EEG activity signifi cantly correlates 
with high-frequency EEG activity during NREM  100   and 
with self-reported hyperarousal symptoms.  72   Th  ese 
fi ndings support the hypothesis that high-frequency 
EEG power in insomnia is a marker of CNS 
hyperarousal.  101     

 REM Sleep Instability 

 Th  e REM sleep instability model  102   hypothesizes that the 
subjective experience of insomnia is related to decreased 
REM sleep percent and increased REM EEG arousals.  103   
In one study, arousals and awakenings during REM 
more precisely distinguished patients with insomnia 
from good sleepers than NREM parameters.  102   Fragmented 
REM sleep may promote the perception of increased 
wakefulness and nonrestorative sleep in insomnia, 
which may contribute to subjective-objective sleep 
discrepancies insomnia.  102     

 Physiologic Hyperarousal 

 Additional support for the involvement of hyperarousal 
in the pathophysiology of insomnia comes from fi ndings 
examining various measures of physiologic arousal 
among individuals with insomnia. As early as 1967, 
Monroe  104   showed that poor sleepers had increased 
body temperature, vasoconstrictions, body movements, 
and skin resistance as compared with good sleepers. 
Insomnia has also been associated, in some studies, with 
increased 24-h metabolic rate (as measured by oxygen 
consumption),  27 , 105   24-h adrenocorticotropic hormone 
and cortisol levels,  51   and heart rate.  106   Some investigators 
have demonstrated greater inhibition of facial muscle 
activity and increased cardiac vagal tone in response to 
sleep-related emotional stimuli among individuals with 
insomnia as compared with good sleepers.  107   Others 
have specifically examined the sleep-onset period, 
fi nding increased frontalis electromyogram, increased 
heart rate, and decreased fi nger temperature among 
subjects with insomnia as compared with control 
subjects up to the point of sleep onset.  108   Findings have 
also shown sympathetic activation among patients with 
insomnia during sleep onset, as evidenced by consis-
tently lower cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP) values as 
compared with good sleepers.  106 , 109   Cardiac PEP is the 
time interval from the beginning of ventricular 

depolarization (marked by the onset of the QRS 
complex in the ECG) to the opening of the aortic valve. 
PEP duration is inversely related to  b -adrenergic tone.  106   
Th  us, lower PEP values indicate enhanced activation of 
the sympathetic nervous system. 

 Many studies investigating physiologic arousal and 
hyperarousal in insomnia have included small samples 
and have not been consistently replicated.  52   For this 
reason, it is not possible to specify diagnostic thresholds 
for any single physiologic measure in insomnia. Noting 
these findings, Varkevisser et al  52   cautioned against 
overemphasizing hyperarousal in the conceptuali-
zation of chronic insomnia. Although hyperarousal is an 
important heuristic concept in many models of insomnia, 
several confl icting points remain to be resolved. First, 
the extent to which hyperarousal is a cause or a conse-
quence of insomnia has not been elucidated. Second, 
targeting hyperarousal in the treatment of insomnia 
(eg, through relaxation training) is oft en less eff ective 
than approaches that enhance sleep processes (eg, sleep 
restriction and hypnotic medications). Th  ird, markers 
of hyperarousal can also be interpreted as insuffi  cient 
inhibition of arousal by sleep-promoting processes.    

 Behavioral and Cognitive Contributions to 
Insomnia 
 Various biologic mechanisms regulate sleep and contrib-
ute to insomnia. Behavioral and cognitive mechanisms 
(ie, beliefs that contribute to specifi c behaviors) can 
also regulate sleep and contribute to, and exacerbate, 
insomnia.  

 Perpetuating Factors 

 Th  e “3P model,”  110   a diathesis-stress model, describes 
a set of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating 
factors that may contribute to the development and 
maintenance of insomnia. Predisposing factors, such 
as age or sex, make an individual more susceptible to 
insomnia, and precipitating factors are events that 
coincide with the onset of insomnia, such as major 
stressors.  111   Perpetuating factors, the largest focus of 
the 3P model, are behaviors and beliefs that maintain 
insomnia,  111   such as increasing time in bed to “catch 
up” on sleep.  110   However, extended time in bed 
perpetuates insomnia because it leads to increased 
wakefulness, fragmented sleep, variability in sleep 
timing,  110   and associations between the sleep environ-
ment and wakefulness. Th  us, initial attempts to reduce 
symptoms of insomnia may evolve into perpetuating 
factors themselves.

 Stimulus Control 

 In 1972, Bootzin  112   proposed that stimuli associated with 
sleep (eg, a quiet, dark bedroom) become discriminative 
stimuli that reinforce sleep. Insomnia may result from 
inadequate sleep-promoting stimuli or from the presence 
of stimuli that are antithetical to sleeping,  112   such as 
phone calls, reading, or worry. Stimulus control therapy 
for insomnia aims to separate the stimuli associated with 
sleep from the stimuli associated with other activities.  112     

 Cognitive Model 

 Th  e cognitive model of insomnia  25   proposes that 
individuals with insomnia are susceptible to excessive 
worry and unpleasant intrusive thoughts, particularly 
those related to getting enough sleep and the conse-
quences of sleep disturbance. Th  is worry may develop 
into sleep-related anxiety, lead to increased vigilance for 
sleep-related threats (eg, watching the clock at night), 
and ultimately result in an exaggeration of the magni-
tude of the actual sleep disruption. Cognitive therapy for 
insomnia challenges these maladaptive cognitive 
processes and limits the behaviors that maintain 
unhelpful beliefs and insomnia.  113   

 In the psychobiologic inhibition model,  24 , 114   a variant of 
the cognitive model, sleep is thought of as automatic,  24   
whereas insomnia is thought of as a failure of automatic 
sleep. Th  e model specifi cally focuses on the attention-
intention-eff ort pathway as one sleep inhibitory process, 
in which three processes occur: (1) increased selective 
attention to sleep and symptoms of insomnia; (2) an 
increase in the subjective value of sleep, which may 
contribute to explicit “intention to sleep”; and (3) gradual 
development of increased eff ort to sleep, described as 
“sleep eff ort syndrome.”  114   Th  us, treatment of insomnia 
should focus on cognitive strategies that aim to reverse 
sleep-related attentional bias  113   and behavioral strategies  115   
aimed at reducing sleep eff ort.    

 Self-Report and Insomnia 
 Unlike many other sleep disorders, insomnia disorder 
relies on self-report for diagnosis; physiologic markers 
of sleep dysregulation (PSG) or hyperarousal are not 
routinely indicated for the evaluation of insomnia.  116 - 118   
Several groups have developed self-report measures 
aimed at detecting insomnia and assessing insomnia-
related experiences and impairments. Focus groups that 
captured patients’ subjective experience of insomnia 
highlighted the pervasive impact of the disorder, the 
perception that others do not fully understand the 
impact of insomnia, and the importance of daytime 

symptoms of insomnia.  119   Self-report measures that were 
developed to assess presleep thought content  120   and 
sleep-related quality of life impairment  121   in insomnia 
demonstrated that (1) presleep cognitive activity among 
patients with insomnia focuses on rehearsal/planning, 
sleep and its consequences, and autonomic experiences, 
among others, and (2) the most common impairments 
pertain to energy/motivation, performance at work, 
cognitive functioning, and emotion regulation. Th  is 
work has also shown that self-report symptom scales 
reliably discriminate individuals with insomnia and 
good sleepers.  120 , 122   

 Although PSG usually shows abnormalities in sleep 
architecture and continuity among individuals with 
insomnia, the magnitude of patient-control diff erences 
is oft en small, and the severity of objective fi ndings is 
oft en less than that obtained by self-report.  1   Neverthe-
less, diff erences among patients with insomnia in 
subjective and objective measures may have important 
clinical implications. For instance, a meaningful 
discrepancy between subjective and objective mea sure-
ment of sleep is prevalent among patients with insomnia 
with objective normal sleep duration but not among 
patients with insomnia with objective short sleep.  123   
Moreover, compared with patients with insomnia who 
have normal overall sleep duration, patients with 
insomnia with short objectively measured sleep duration 
are at increased risk for adverse health outcomes, 
including hypertension, diabetes, physiologic hyper-
arousal, cognitive diffi  culties, and even mortality.  124 , 125   
Th  e magnitude and night-to-night variability of discrep-
ancy between self-reported and objectively measured 
sleep may itself constitute a high-risk presentation that 
may be informative for examining the etiology and 
pathophysiology of insomnia.  126 , 127   Th  us, objective 
assessments of sleep may be useful adjunctive measures 
in predicting the biologic severity and medical impact of 
insomnia, and cost-eff ective objective measures of sleep 
should be considered in the standard diagnostic 
procedure for insomnia to diff erentiate phenotypes.  124 , 125     

 Integration and Treatment Implications 
 Our intent in this article has been to outline the mecha-
nisms by which insomnia develops and is maintained, 
highlighting fi ndings in the literature at various levels of 
analysis.  Table 2  summarizes the evidence at each unit of 
analysis, which indicates that evidence for the patho-
physiology has been generated using numerous 
methodologies based on a range of theoretical scientifi c 
perspectives. Integration of the evidence presented here

pathophysiology of insomnia.  Figure 1    depicts this 
model, in which insomnia is most likely to develop in 
those who have increased genetic risk and who experi-
ence abnormalities in neurobiological processes. Th  ese 
trait-like vulnerabilities may lead to neurophysiologic 
hyperarousal and to psychologic and behavioral 
processes, which, individually or together, increase an 
individual’s risk for developing insomnia and associated 
downstream health consequences. Precipitating stressors 
and other person-specifi c factors (eg, age, sex) moderate 
these relationships. Th  e extent to which an individual 
with insomnia shows evidence of abnormalities in each 
of the processes depicted may vary among diff erent 
individuals.         

 Accordingly, interventions aimed at preventing or 
resolving symptoms of insomnia may target various aspects 
of the identifi ed pathophysiologic processes. Th  e cur rent 
gold standard psychologic treatment of insomnia is 

Cognitive Behavioral Th  erapy for Insomnia,  128 - 130   which 
is typically composed of multiple treatment elements: 
stimulus control therapy, sleep restriction therapy, 
relaxation training, cognitive therapy, and sleep hygiene 
education (see Reference  131  for a review). These 
treatment elements focus on: (1) increasing the associa-
tion between the bed and being asleep; (2) reestab-
lishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule; (3) restricting 
time in bed to increase sleep drive and, subsequently, 
sleep effi  ciency; (4) reducing somatic tension or intrusive 
thoughts that are antithetical to sleep; (5) targeting 
maladaptive beliefs about sleep; and (6) maintaining 
good sleep practices.  131   As reviewed by Buysse  132   and 
Morin and Benca,  7   the effi  cacy of Cognitive Behavioral 
Th  erapy for Insomnia for the treatment of insomnia has 
been demonstrated. Although these approaches make 
eff orts toward reducing cognitive and emotional arousal, 
there has also been a call for therapies that target

physiologic hyperarousal across the night and day.  22   
Some studies have documented changes in physiologic 
measures with pharmacologic therapies, but much more 
work is needed to draw conclusions about the effi  cacy of 
these approaches.  22   

 In addition, several effi  cacious pharmacologic treatments 
for insomnia target various aspects of the identifi ed 
pathophysiologic processes (see References  133 ,  134  for 
review). For example, benzodiazepine receptor agonists 
(eg, temazepam, zolpidem), which are generally eff ective 
in the treatment of insomnia, promote sleep by enhancing 
widespread inhibitory activity of GABA. Th  e tricyclic 
drug doxepin has shown effi  cacy for sleep initiation and 
maintenance insomnia; although not US Food and Drug 
Administration-approved, trazodone is also widely used 
for insomnia. Th  e sedative eff ect of these drugs is mainly 
achieved by targeting the histaminergic arousal system. 
More recently, there has been progress in the develop-
ment of orexin receptor antagonists for the treatment of 
insomnia (eg, almorexant, suvorexant); suvorexant was 
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion for this indication. Th  ese drugs target the orexin 
system that promotes arousal of brainstem/hypotha-
lamic arousal centers. Other medications have been 
suggested for the treatment of insomnia, but additional 
work is needed to demonstrate safety and effi  cacy. 
Future work on the pathophysiology of insomnia 
may help to identify specifi c mechanisms in specifi c 
patient groups, which may lead to more targeted 
pharmacotherapy.   

 Conclusions 
 Evaluating evidence from a range of domains and across 
various levels demonstrates not only the advances made 
in understanding the pathophysiology of insomnia but 
also the areas in which additional support is needed and 
the type of analysis that might fi ll a gap in the literature. 
For example, human genetic studies that include more 
refi ned sleep measures (ie, clinical assessment, sleep 
diaries, actigraphy, PSG) may provide greater power 
needed to identify the role of genes in the pathophysiology 
of insomnia. At the neural and physiologic levels, future 
work should examine the potential role of impaired 
“switching processes” and local and circuit-level sleep 
dysregulation. Functional imaging, high-density EEG, 
magnetoencephalography, and magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy are useful tools for such studies. Last, 
additional studies at all levels of analysis should more 
deeply examine subjective-objective discrepancies as 
one clue to insomnia pathophysiology. Greater under-
standing of the pathophysiology of insomnia may 

provide important information regarding new targets 
for prevention and treatment.
