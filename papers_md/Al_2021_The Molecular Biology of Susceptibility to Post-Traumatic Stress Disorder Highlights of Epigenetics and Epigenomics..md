Abstract: Exposure to trauma is one of the most important and prevalent risk factors for mental and
physical ill-health. Excessive or prolonged stress exposure increases the risk of a wide variety of
mental and physical symptoms. However, people differ strikingly in their susceptibility to develop
signs and symptoms of mental illness after traumatic stress. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
a debilitating disorder affecting approximately 8% of the world’s population during their lifetime,
and typically develops after exposure to a traumatic event. Despite that exposure to potentially
traumatizing events occurs in a large proportion of the general population, about 80–90% of trauma-
exposed individuals do not develop PTSD, suggesting an inter-individual difference in vulnerability
to PTSD. While the biological mechanisms underlying this differential susceptibility are unknown,
epigenetic changes have been proposed to underlie the relationship between exposure to traumatic
stress and the susceptibility to develop PTSD. Epigenetic mechanisms refer to environmentally
sensitive modiﬁcations to DNA and RNA molecules that regulate gene transcription without altering
the genetic sequence itself. In this review, we provide an overview of various molecular biologi-
cal, biochemical and physiological alterations in PTSD, focusing on changes at the genomic and
epigenomic level. Finally, we will discuss how current knowledge may aid us in early detection and
improved management of PTSD patients.

1. Introduction

Mental disorders have a high economic burden and are known to impact one’s pro-
ductivity and quality of life [1]. Among them, stress-related mental disorders are common
in various societies and can develop after exposure to environmental stressors. Trauma can
be deﬁned as a response to a deeply distressing or disturbing event that overwhelms an
individual’s ability to cope, causes feelings of helplessness, and diminishes their sense of
self along with their ability to feel the full range of emotions and experiences [2]. Traumatic
stress typically relates to events that are shocking and emotionally overwhelming, and that
may involve actual or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to physical integrity.

Exposure to traumatic stress is highly prevalent; it has been reported that approxi-
mately 40–90% of the general population are exposed to one or more traumatic stressors
during their lifetime, with distinct populations being at ultra-high risk for exposure to

multiple traumatic stressors (e.g., military and police personnel) [3,4]. It is one of the most
important and prevalent risk factors for various mental disorders [5,6], including post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, schizophrenia, chronic fatigue, and depression.
Amidst the aforementioned mental disorders, PTSD unarguably remains among the most
well-known, due to its uniqueness in having an etiological factor (i.e., the exposure) in-
corporated into the diagnostic description and possibly also due to its high prevalence
in certain populations, such as in the combat veteran population [7]. On a societal level,
the economic costs of trauma-related psychiatric disorders in Europe are enormous. For
example, the costs for anxiety disorders have been estimated at an approximate EUR
74 million, including over EUR 8 million for PTSD in 2010 [8]. In addition, the annual
productivity loss of PTSD patients is estimated at approximately USD 3 billion [4]. As a
result, stress-related disorders pose an enormous burden on affected individuals, families
and society as a whole. These ﬁgures are expected to rise further when projected to the
year 2030, making these mental disorders among the top contributors with regard to the
worldwide disease burden [9]. Additionally, there currently are no preventive measures to
minimize the impact of traumatic stress on health, and PTSD treatment options are limited.
At the clinical level, PTSD has a range of symptoms and/or behavioural alterations
such as intrusions, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal, sensitization to stressors, and nega-
tive alterations in cognitions and mood [10]. While the lifetime prevalence for stress-related
psychiatric disorders exceeds 40%, the lifetime prevalence for PTSD is approximately
2–12% and is signiﬁcantly higher in high-risk populations [4,8]. Moreover, there is great
variation in individual susceptibility to develop PTSD symptoms after exposure to a trau-
matic stressor [11]. Indeed, more than 80% of trauma-exposed individuals will remain
symptom-free [11]. Evidence accumulates that differential susceptibility to traumatic stress
may be related to context-dependent functional and transcriptional “epigenetic” alterations
in distinct neuronal circuitries involving the hippocampus and the amygdala, as well as in
brain–body interactions including the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) and
the immune system, amongst others [5,12].

Clinically, the cornerstone of PTSD treatment strategies is formed by exposure-based
therapies, such as prolonged imaginary exposure, Eye Movement Desensitization and
Reprocessing (EMDR) or narrative exposure therapy (NET) [13], with fear extinction learn-
ing as one of the assumed mechanisms mediating a reduction in symptoms, while also
more classical forms of cognitive therapies are being applied [13]. Moreover, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are administered, with sertraline and paroxetine as
FDA-approved agents, and several other pharmaceuticals applied off-label, including atyp-
ical antipsychotic agents [14]. Neuromodulation strategies, including electroconvulsive
therapy, transcranial stimulation, cranial nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation,
have been applied experimentally and await additional studies before clinical recommen-
dations can be made for their potential inclusion as additional modes of treatment for
patients with (distinct forms of) PTSD [15].

As with many other diseases, both genetic and environmental factors affect the onset,
severity, and manifestations of PTSD. By studying epigenetic factors, one can potentially
obtain a measure of the impact of environmental insults on genetic expression. Epigenetics
refers to DNA modiﬁcations caused by environmental changes that regulate gene tran-
scription without altering the genetic sequence itself. Because of the brain’s central role in a
person’s dynamic adaptations to environmental exposures, epigenetic research is pertinent
in neurosciences and mental health [16–18]. Hence, gaining a better understanding of
epigenetic modiﬁcations caused by traumatic stress would be of great beneﬁt for patients,
clinicians and society as a whole. DNA methylation, or the methylation of cytosine residues
to 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), is one of the best-characterized epigenetic mechanisms in the
mammalian genome and is involved in long-term persistent alterations along with more
volatile changes induced by environmental exposures [19,20]. DNA methylation not only
programs the identity of cells, but also contributes to the adaptive capacity of the tran-
scriptional response to dynamic alterations in environmental factors throughout life. Other

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

epigenetic mechanisms are also being increasingly studied, including histone modiﬁcations
and miRNAs. For all of these, in recent years, approaches have moved from targeted
gene or genomic region-based ones to genome-wide explorations looking for integrated
regulatory patterns or mechanisms in the ﬁeld of epigenomics.

Therefore, the aim of this narrative review paper is to provide an overview of the
current knowledge with respect to certain important aspects and highlights in the ﬁelds
of neurobiology, epigenetics and epigenomics in relation to PTSD. Figure 1 provides an
general overview of the information about PTSD discussed in this review.

2. Neurobiology of PTSD

PTSD is a complex pathological entity that evolves over time. It is usually triggered
by abnormally high levels of physiological stress that impact neuronal biochemical con-
ﬁgurations and neuroplasticity within the central nervous system [21]. In the following
sections, we will elaborate on the neurobiological characteristics of PTSD.

2.1. Neuroanatomical Changes Associated with PTSD

In recent decades, imaging techniques have been used to visualize the brains of
people exposed to trauma. Several studies have reported structural changes in two speciﬁc
brain areas, i.e., the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [22]. While
the hippocampus is involved in memory and learning, the ACC plays a role in reasoning
and decision-making [23]. Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has
revealed reduced prefrontal cortex activity when people with PTSD are reminded of the
trauma, and increased activity of the amygdala, which processes fear and emotion [24].
This contrasts with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex of people who experience

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

trauma without developing PTSD [25–27]. Recent research has furthermore indicated
that functional differences might also play a role in the development and persistence of
stress-induced mental disorders. Research performed by Ressler and colleagues on highly
traumatized individuals showed that resilient individuals have better connections between
the ACC and the hippocampus in contrast to those suffering from PTSD [28]. This suggests
that susceptibility to stress may relate to disturbed communication between the cortical
reasoning circuitry and the emotional circuitry of our limbic system.

2.2. Biochemical Mediators in PTSD Patients
2.2.1. Norepinephrine

Norepinephrine is a pivotal transmitter in the peripheral and central nervous system.
The locus coeruleus, in which the cell somata produce norepinephrine reside, is also
targeted by antianxiety drugs, including benzodiazepines and alcohol [29].

Some phenotypes and symptoms of PTSD, including irritability, hyperarousal, and
sleep disturbance, have been speciﬁcally related to altered noradrenergic function [30],
and it has been proposed that the sympathetic function in PTSD individuals may suf-
fer from an uncoupling between the central and peripheral autonomic ﬁelds [31]. The
α2-norepinephrine receptors have been documented to show particular alterations in
stress conditions, although this is likely not speciﬁcally linked to PTSD [32]. It has been
documented that deﬁciency of deﬁcient α2-adrenoreceptors is associated with increased
vulnerability to stressors in mice [33,34].

2.2.2. Dopamine

Dopamine is another abundant neurotransmitter in the brain, mainly produced in the
midbrain region and transported via axons to other brain regions [35]. Evidence for its role
in PTSD can be viewed from three different aspects: a molecular aspect, including genetic,
ligand–receptor and metabolic alterations, regional alterations, and speciﬁc clinical symp-
toms. While several studies trying to ﬁnd associations between speciﬁc dopamine receptor
genes (DRD2) and PTSD showed associations [36,37], others did not [38]. Metabolic alter-
ations of dopamine have been conﬁrmed by ﬁnding increased dopamine concentrations
in the plasma or urine of PTSD patients [39,40], and an increase in their dopamine beta-
hydroxylase activity [41]. Regionally, the medial prefrontal cortex shows a high release of
dopamine from axonal projections after stressful conditions [42,43]. Interestingly, cognitive
impairment associated with the stress response has been linked to dopamine release in the
prefrontal cortex in conjunction with other neurotransmitters [44]. These studies suggest
an important role of the dopamine system in the pathophysiology of PTSD.

2.2.3. Serotonin

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter which has widespread actions on behavioural and
physiological functions [35]. Human studies show that decreased serotonergic function is
associated with PTSD-related symptoms and behaviour such as impulsivity [45–47], aggres-
sion [46], depression and suicide [48,49]. Genetic associations between PTSD and speciﬁc
serotonin transporter molecules have been reported. For example, PTSD is associated with
the SS (short–short) allele genotype, which leads to lower expression of the serotonin trans-
porter 5-HTT and as such lower serotonin reuptake from the synapse [50–54]. In contrast,
the LL (long–long) genotype of the serotonin transporter in PTSD is associated with en-
hanced response to SSRIs, while the SS allele is associated with non-responsiveness [54–56].
The SS genotype in PTSD is also associated with a poor response to cognitive behavioural
treatment [57]. These ﬁndings highlight the genetic precursors of susceptibility to PTSD
associated with serotonin.

2.2.4. Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)

GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter which is ubiquitously present throughout
the brain. Its receptors have been classiﬁed in three main classes (GABA-A, GABA-B, and

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

5 of 21

GABA-C). Benzodiazepines are the most important agonists binding to GABA-A receptors.
GABA-A receptors show altered (decreased) binding with ligands in the frontal cortex
following speciﬁc types of stressors [58]. GABA benzodiazepine receptors also showed
decreased expression in the hippocampus after prenatal stress [59] and in a fearful strain of
rats [60]. Human studies also showed decreased GABA-A binding capacity in Vietnam
combat veterans with PTSD [61]. These ﬁndings show that alterations in GABA receptor
expression or binding capacity may have effects on stress-related mental disorders, with a
possible role in PTSD.

2.2.5. Neuropeptide Y (NPY)

NPY is a neuropeptide expressed in various parts of the brain, including the forebrain,
limbic system, and brainstem, which regulate emotional and stress behaviours [62]. Interest
in NPY took off in 2000 following a study on healthy US Army soldiers [63]. These
soldiers participated in a survival course, which was designed to simulate the conditions
experienced by prisoners of war [63]. Their serum NPY levels went up within a few hours
after exposure to military interrogations during the survival course. Furthermore, most of
the soldiers of the Special Forces who had trained to be resilient had signiﬁcantly increased
NPY levels relative to the non-Special Forces or the typical ones [63]. This supports the idea
that NPY enhances stress resilience, which is generally seen in humans. Other preclinical
and clinical studies corroborate these data, suggesting that reduced NPY in the central
nervous system is associated with PTSD [62]. The most common SNP studied for NPY is
rs16147 (−399T > C) polymorphism, which is associated with low concentrations of NPY,
resulting in hyperarousal in the brainstem, stress activation alterations in the HPA axis and
re-experiencing in the hippocampus [62]. Other studies, in addition, found other factors
caused by trauma (TNFa) increase dysregulating the HPA axis [64]. The −1002T > G loci
are also associated with low NPY concentration in the CSF and amygdala, associated with
increased levels of anxiety, arousal, addictive behaviours, and reduced stress resiliency [62].

2.2.6. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)

BDNF, which regulates neuronal survival, growth differentiation, and synapse for-
mation, is known to be involved in PTSD as well as depression [65]. Some studies have
shown that BDNF is associated with PTSD risk and exaggerated startle reaction (a major
arousal manifestation of PTSD) in the United States military service members who were
deployed during the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan [65]. Furthermore, subjects with
PTSD showed higher levels of BDNF in their peripheral blood plasma than the non-PTSD
controls. Increased BDNF levels were observed in both blood plasma and hippocampal
tissue in the inescapable tail shock rat model of PTSD [65]. This highlights the impor-
tance of BDNF as a potential biomarker and its possible roles in the onset of PTSD [65].
Fundamental research shows that stress decreases the expression of BDNF in the hippocam-
pus [66]. This, along with another ﬁnding on the effect of stress on inducing neuronal
loss and damage in the CA3 region of the hippocampus [67], and the pivotal role of the
hippocampus in handling stressful conditions, may point to the fact that stress initially
decreases BDNF and subsequently results in hippocampal damage, leading to PTSD.

2.2.7. Oxidative Stress in PTSD

Many studies have reported that increases in oxidative stress might contribute to the
development of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. Stress is considered to be a risk
factor for PTSD development and triggers a sustained growth in nitric oxide synthase
(NOS) activity, which might generate extreme amounts of nitric oxide. In general, the
oxidation of nitric oxide produces a substance called ‘peroxynitrite’, which is extremely
toxic to all nerve cells. Observations of high levels of peroxynitrite and its predecessor
nitric oxide have been reported in patients with PTSD [68].

2.3. Neuroendocrine Changes: Alterations in the HPA Axis

The HPA axis is a hierarchical system comprising the hypothalamic, pituitary and
adrenal glands which orchestrates the homeostatic balance of the organism’s response to
environmental stress. The effective arm of this axis is cortisol and its analogues, which are
stress hormones. Stress hormones modulate the physiological, immunological, and treat-
ment responses in PTSD [69]. There are gender differences in response to traumatic events.
Women show a higher incidence of trauma-related psychiatric disorders, including PTSD,
than their male counterparts [69]. Animal studies also show a strain-speciﬁc difference in
fear behaviour in mice, related to the difference in their glucocorticoid response to stressful
events [70]. In parallel, human foetuses experiencing severe pregnancy stress will have an
altered HPA axis and will have a higher risk of neuropsychiatric disorders later in life [71].
Several studies have aimed to demonstrate a relationship between increases in stress
hormone levels and the intensity of an encountered traumatic event. A captivity sur-
vival program in the Canadian Armed Forces showed that salivary cortisol and dehy-
droepiandrosterone (DHEA) increased the most in scenarios with higher-intensity interro-
gations [72]. Data from adolescents exposed to the 1988 earthquake in Armenia showed
a signiﬁcant relation between adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) response to exercise
challenges, and severity of PTSD [73].

Other studies showed a relationship between initial hormonal levels immediately after
a stressful event and the risk of subsequent development of PTSD. Higher initial urinary
epinephrine and cortisol levels immediately following a traumatic event are associated
with an increased risk of developing PTSD later in life in child trauma victims [74]. In
contrast, urinary cortisol levels immediately following admission to hospital in motor
vehicle accident victims were lower in those who subsequently developed PTSD [75].

Therapeutic approaches can modulate the HPA axis in PTSD patients. A study on
PTSD patients showed an increase in serum cortisol and DHEA levels after brief eclectic
psychotherapy in those who responded to this treatment modality [76].

3. Heritability and Genetic Findings of PTSD

Though it is predicted that up to 90% of individuals may suffer from a signiﬁcant
traumatic experience in their lifetime, PTSD is only found to develop in 20–30% of exposed
individuals [77]. Benerjee et al. (2017) indicate that a major contributing factor to this
difference could be genetic heritability along with early childhood trauma. This is reﬂected
by twin studies showing 30–40% genetic heritability estimates for PTSD [78]. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have addressed some of these genetic factors and identiﬁed
associations with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in certain genes, including the
retinoid-related orphan receptor gene (RORA), Neuroligin gene (NLGN1) and Tolloid-like 1
gene (TLL-1) [19]. The RORA gene protein has the potential to modulate neurons to respond
to steroid hormone changes, oxidative stress, and inﬂammation. This modulatory effect is
severed by trauma-induced changes of RORA. Furthermore, common variants within the
FKBP5 gene have been shown to increase the risk of developing PTSD and MDD [79,80].
A recent work further studied the genetic underpinning of PTSD in relation to MDD, by
applying a multi-omics integrative approach using genomics and transcriptomics data.
They identiﬁed 13 potential driver genes for PTSD symptoms, with ESR1, RUNX1, PPARA,
and WWOX also driving MDD symptoms and connected to biological pathways which
have been linked previously to the regulation of stress and trauma response [81].

Additionally, the NLGN1 gene is also found to be linked with PTSD and other psychi-
atric disorders [82]. This gene encodes for synaptic adhesion molecules and thereby has a
role in synaptogenesis and synaptic maintenance. NLGN1 depletion in the amygdala in a
mouse model of PTSD shows a depletion of fear-associated memory storage, indicating a
prominent role in PTSD [82]. Moreover, the TLL-1 gene that functions in remodelling the
extracellular matrix has recently been found to be a contributing gene for the development
of PTSD [19]. It is important to consider, however, that there is a conﬂict in consider-
ing GWAS methods while trying to move away from false positives and heterogeneity

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

7 of 21

across samples [83]. Hence, despite the major contribution of GWAS in this ﬁeld, GWAS
approaches to date have not (yet) produced many replicable ﬁndings [83].

In 2019, Nievergelt et al. conducted a meta-analysis of PTSD genome-wide associ-
ation studies, using a sample size of about 200,000 individuals consisting of more than
30,000 PTSD cases and 170,000 controls. The main aim of their study was to demonstrate
the genetic risk for PTSD by estimating heritability based on molecular genetic data, to
discover genome-wide signiﬁcant hits linked to PTSD. They found heritability estimates in
the range of 5–20% and identiﬁed contributing genes, including PARK2, PODXL, SH3RF3,
ZDHHC14, KAZN, as well as several non-coding RNAs [84].

4. Epigenetic Changes

Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression levels without altering the DNA
sequence [85,86]. These mechanisms include histone modiﬁcations, DNA methylation,
and post-transcriptional regulation by non-coding RNAs (RNA-associated silencing) such
as microRNAs (miRNAs). Epigenetic changes can be acquired over the lifespan and
mediate environmental effects on gene expression. In the brain, epigenetic regulation is
vital for basic cellular processes involved in multiple aspects of neuronal function, such
as synaptic plasticity, and for complex behaviours, such as those involved in learning
and memory [87]. Epigenetic mechanisms are affected by various factors and processes,
including development (both in utero and during childhood), environmental chemicals,
drugs/pharmaceuticals, aging, and diet.

An increasing number of studies show the relevance of epigenetic changes in response
to traumatic stress across the life span. These provide a possible link between the envi-
ronment and gene expression, since stress could have an inﬂuence on gene expression
by inducing speciﬁc changes in epigenetic regulation [88–90]. These changes might be
different for some individuals who develop PTSD and those who do not. By ﬁnding speciﬁc
epigenetic patterns, scientists could discover diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers, and
even enhance therapeutic opportunities. In addition, many animal studies have been in-
strumental in delivering clues for a causal relationship between the early life environment,
epigenomic changes, and subsequent behavioural changes.

Although available evidence is limited, transgenerational epigenetic research per-
formed in animals indicates that the epigenetic effects of trauma may be transmitted to
multiple generations. Therefore, traumatic stress could already affect the epigenetic back-
ground of said offspring during pregnancy [90–94]. If conﬁrmed, this could be predictive
for the possible future development of PTSD, especially in light of at-risk jobs where
trauma exposure is more prevalent. Below, we describe the roles of the different epigenetic
mechanisms, pharmacological aspects, and relationships with other factors.

4.1. Histone Modiﬁcation

Histone proteins can be altered by the addition of one or more chemical groups to
one or more residues in the chain, including acetyl, citrulline, methyl, ubiquitin, a small-
ubiquitin-like modiﬁer, phosphorus, and ribose [95]. The effect of histone modiﬁcation
on transcription is quite diverse: histone acetylation opens up chromatin conformation
to allow transcription, histone phosphorylation often indicates DNA damage, whereas
the transcriptional impact of mono-, di-, or tri-methylation is dependent on the modiﬁed
histone protein and residue [96].

Animal studies that measured brain histone acetylation after fear conditioning [96,97]
showed that histone H4 lysine 5 acetylation (H4K5ac) and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac)
were increased signiﬁcantly in the lateral, basal, and centrolateral amygdala. H3K9ac
and H4K5ac were also shown to be increased in the centromedial amygdala and the
prelimbic-prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC), but this only occurred after fear learning. Similarly,
after fear learning, differential H4K5ac levels were observed in the prefrontal cortex, with
a signiﬁcant decrease in the infralimbic-prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) and an increase in the
PL-PFC. Furthermore, histone acetylation also showed variations after fear extinction in

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

8 of 21

which rat IL-PFC showed signiﬁcantly higher levels of H3K9ac after delayed extinction
compared to no (or immediate) extinction [96,98].

In humans, histone trimethylation variances have been noted in PTSD subjects at
various lysine sites in peripheral blood monocytes [96,99]. It is worth noting that several
histone modiﬁcations are associated with DNA methylation changes in certain genes,
as well as expression changes of miRNAs, especially relating to the expression of pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines [96].

4.2. DNA Methylation

DNA methylation, mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), typically reduces
or blocks gene transcription and occurs most frequently at the cytosine of a CpG site (a DNA
sequence where cytosine is 5-prime to guanine, connected via a phosphate group) [96,100].
A study taking account of genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation in
12 PTSD subjects as well as 12 trauma-exposed healthy control subjects discovered
3989 genes that were signiﬁcantly upregulated in those with PTSD and three downregulated
(p < 0.05), which was adjusted for multiple comparisons. However, there was no signiﬁcant
difference in DNA methylation [96,101]. The same study observed upregulation in olfactory
function and immune system gene expression. Other studies also noted downregulation
in immune system genes [96]. Other methylome-wide studies have discovered that DNA
methylation variation at certain loci, genes and biological processed showed signiﬁcant
association with PTSD, as shown in the EWAS studies mentioned in Section 5.

4.3. MicroRNA

RNA-associated silencing is a process whereby non-coding RNAs (nc-RNAs) nega-
tively impact gene expression. Long nc-RNAs (lncRNA) are transcripts that are larger than
200 nucleotides. Short nc-RNAs (sncRNA) appear in a very large range of molecules, and
include miRNA, piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), and small interfering RNA (siRNA) [96].
Hundreds of different miRNAs can be found in humans, which together regulate the
activity of 30–60% of all protein-coding genes [102]. miRNAs are transcribed from DNA
into primary miRNAs, which are processed further into precursor miRNAs, and ﬁnally
mature miRNAs [103]. Mature miRNAs most often bind to the 3(cid:48) untranslated region (UTR)
of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thereby affecting gene regulation by silencing and/or
suppressing gene expression [102]. By targeting a large number of mRNAs, miRNAs are
involved in a wide variety of critical processes, including development, metabolism, growth
and differentiation [104]. As such, aberrant expression of miRNA has been associated
with several human diseases, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and inﬂammatory
diseases, as well as in some psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD)
and schizophrenia [104]. Various studies based on animal models of PTSD or clinical
patients demonstrate alterations in circulating miRNAs in PTSD subjects [105].

In a mouse model for PTSD, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) miRNA proﬁles demonstrated
that traumatic stress on its own did not inﬂuence long-term miRNA expression, when com-
pared to control subjects [96,106]. However, the use of ﬂuoxetine treatment in traumatized
mice signiﬁcantly reduced some miRNAs—especially mmu-miR-1971—in comparison to
untreated traumatized mice. This ﬁnding in particular is relevant for future studies on the
subject of RNA-associated epigenetic mechanisms in PTSD sufferers with comorbid de-
pressive/anxiety disorders, as these kinds of comorbidities are often treated with selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—for instance, ﬂuoxetine [96]. Additionally, serotonin
has been shown to alter the levels of an miRNA that modulates the expression levels of the
serotonin transporter [107].

4.4. Epigenetics Based Pharmacology

In recent years, drugs that have been used clinically, such as the anticonvulsant and
mood-stabilizing agent valproic acid (VPA), have been shown to act on different aspects
of the epigenetic machinery. Epigenetic mechanisms of VPA include regulation through

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

9 of 21

transcription factors, DNA methylation and direct inhibition of histone deacetylation [108].
VPA was also shown to affect DNA methylation along with quetiapine when used in bipolar
disorder [109]. Though conventionally used drugs for neurological or psychiatric disorders
are classiﬁed based on their receptor binding, many of them also have additional epigenetic
mechanisms of action [110]. The extent of the contribution of these epigenetic mechanisms
relative to their neurotransmitter receptor binding capacity is unknown [111]. Amitriptyline
alters DNA methylation and is used to treat PTSD [112]. Imipramine, a histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitor, and many other psychiatric drugs, such as paroxetine, citalopram,
haloperidol, and clozapine, have been shown to have epigenetic mechanisms [107,110–112].
Here, we describe some recent insights into the role of HDAC inhibitors and DNMT
inhibitors in more detail.

4.4.1. HDAC Inhibitors

Histone acetyltransferases (HAT) add an acetyl group to the histone proteins, causing
the chromatin to relax and allow transcription to take place, leading to the formation of
memory. HDAC removes acetyl groups, causing the chromatin to tighten, and hinders
transcription [113]. Although both HDAC and HAT can be targeted using distinct com-
pounds, only HDAC inhibitors have thus far been tested in relation to fear processing [114].
The inhibition of HDAC has demonstrated a role in enhancing a number of putatively
protective genes and has been linked with neuroprotection and memory formation [115].
When injected before the fear conditioning session, HDAC inhibitors boosted the long-term
fear memory formation, but when injected into the IL-PFC during extinction training in
mice, they have been shown to boost new memory formation during extinction [116]. This
highlights the potential use of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of PTSD.

VPA, trichostatin A, and sodium or phenylbutyrate are clinically used HDAC in-
hibitors [113]. VPA in particular is currently used for its role as an anti-convulsant and
mood stabilizer. Long-term treatment with VPA has been linked to enhancement of
GABAergic signalling [114]. VPA and Vorinostat, also known as suberanilohydroxamic
acid, which inhibits histone deacetylase, have both shown to be promising new avenues
in treating PTSD and mood symptoms. Nevertheless, a randomized control trial (RCT)
should be the next step in order to fully comprehend their efﬁcacy [117,118].

Histone-modifying complexes can further include histone acetyltransferases and
HDACs [119]. The delayed onset of the effect of many antidepressant drugs is an example
of the possible indirect epigenetic modiﬁcation effects of these pharmacotherapies. Some
psychiatric drugs have a direct effect on enzymes catalysing epigenetic changes. Among
them are VPA [120] and the antidepressant tranylcypromine [121].

4.4.2. DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) Inhibitors

DNMT catalyse the transfer of a methyl group to the genome, generally hindering
transcription when occurring in CpG islands. DNMT inhibitors, such as HDAC inhibitors,
have shown promising effects on fear extinction by inducing deﬁcits in learning in relation
to fear. However, they work in much the opposite way as HDAC inhibitors. Infusion of
DNMT inhibitors to the lateral amygdala in rodents promotes the extinction of memory
rather than the formation of new memories [113]. 5-aza-2(cid:48)-deoxycytidine (5-AZA) is one of
the few DNMT inhibitors that have been tested in this regard, and it has demonstrated a
preventative effect on fear memory formation by increasing acetylation of histones [122].

4.5. The Impact of Lifestyle, Psychotherapy, and Behavioural Therapy on Epigenetic Mechanisms

There is accumulating evidence that epigenetics affect the stress, health, and behaviour
of an individual, but more importantly, this also works vice versa [123]. Recent studies
indicate that behavioural approaches used to treat PTSD such as cognitive behavioural
therapy and/or lifestyle modiﬁcations such as long-term meditation can alter neurophys-
iological traits and transcriptional proﬁles [123]. The study conducted by Kaliman et al.
(2014) depicted the dynamic role of behavioural change on epigenetics and its beneﬁts

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

10 of 21

in some PTSD symptoms [124]. This study included 8 h of meditation and within those
hours, experienced meditators indicated lower expression of HDAC genes (HDAC2, 3, and
9). These histone changes could be beneﬁcial to PTSD patients as the downregulation of
HDAC2 is associated with an improved cortisol recovery after stress. Additionally, the
intervention group showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the pro-inﬂammatory gene COX-2, as
this gene is dependent on HDAC expression changes as well [124].

5. Epigenomic Technology Modern Approach

In contrast to earlier epigenetic research, which was more aimed at demonstrating
the existence of epigenetic alterations in disease, generally focussing on individual genes
or genomic regions, novel aims are to apply genome-wide screening methods and obtain
an integrated understanding of regulatory changes. Here, we describe some avenues of
state-of-the-art research approaches.

5.1. Recent Developments in Epigenetics of Stress Disorders Research
5.1.1. Modern Technologies Used in Epigenomics PTSD Research

This section will elaborate on the techniques most commonly used to study epigenetic
underpinnings of stress-related disorders such as PTSD. Of note, it does not aim to provide a
comprehensive overview of the available techniques used to study epigenetic mechanisms.
DNA methylation analysis has been among the most popular methods to investigate
epigenetic variations [125]. The most conventional method includes the sequencing of
PCR-ampliﬁed and bisulphite-modiﬁed DNA [126].

The most comprehensive method to analyse bisulphite-converted DNA is whole-
genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS). Although this approach allows for an unbiased
exploration of methylation patterns across the whole genome, its main limitations are a rel-
atively high cost and high complexity of the generated data. Moreover, since full coverage
is usually not required, techniques such as reduced representation bisulphite sequencing
(RRBS), in which only speciﬁc CpG-rich regions are sequenced, are an interesting and less
challenging alternative.

Another widely used alternative includes DNA methylation arrays. For example, the
latest microarrays from Illumina allow researchers to interrogate over 850,000 CpG sites
using the Inﬁnium Methylation EPIC kit, while previous versions were limited to 27 K and,
subsequently, 450 K sites. The genome-wide coverage and high-throughput nature of the
EPIC BeadChips make them ideal for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) [127].

5.1.2. Epigenome-Wide Association Studies Open New Perspectives

EWAS allow for a hypothesis-free investigation of DNA methylation patterns across
the genome that are associated with a particular phenotype. To date, several main studies
have identiﬁed methylation proﬁles associated with PTSD (Table 1).

Longitudinal studies highlight associations between the development of PTSD symp-
toms and the emergence of alterations in DNA methylation proﬁles [128,129]. Studies
using longitudinal designs can reveal speciﬁc genomic regions in which DNA methylation
patterns dynamically change across a period of stress exposure, and potentially mark
susceptibility for PTSD [128].

Using such a design on a cohort of Dutch military members (the Prospective Research
In Stress-related Military Operations; PRISMO, N = 93), a study conducted by Rutten et al.
(2018) assessed post-deployment methylation proﬁles associated with PTSD status while
correcting for pre-deployment measures [128]. Using Illumina HumanMethylation450
BeadChips, the authors identiﬁed 17 loci and 12 genomic regions which underwent methy-
lation changes that were associated with PTSD symptoms [128]. Replication analyses in
a cohort of US Marine soldiers (N = 98) showed nominal replication for three genes, i.e.,
HIST1H2APS2, RNF39, and ZFP57. Decreasing DNA methylation levels at these sites were
related to increasing levels of PTSD symptoms [128]. Interestingly, when comparing the
epigenetic alterations between the ﬁrst dataset (N = 93) of the Dutch military and the

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

11 of 21

second dataset (N = 98) of the US Marines, the gene region HIST1H2APS2 was one of
the only mutual gene positions that had a decrease in methylation in both group sets and
increased symptoms of PTSD [128].

Many recent studies have examined global DNA methylation on a genome-wide
scale on different groups who have experienced similar traumas (wars, combat, child
abuse, veterans, etc.) [64,128–132]. Based on this, one could assume that due to these
major commonalities in the studied populations, some CpG sites should be inconsistent
throughout all of the studies. This is especially true if these studies claim that epigenetic
changes in certain genes could be a biomarker of PTSD development [130–132]. However,
the DOCK2 gene site was one of the only CpG site that has been found to have signiﬁcant
methylation changes across three studies [130,132,133].

Logue et al. (2020) recently examined a cohort of veterans from the Translational
Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) and aimed to replicate their
ﬁndings using data collected from several military cohorts [130]. One genome-wide
signiﬁcant association with PTSD was identiﬁed at cg19534438, located within the G0S2
gene. Locus methylation was shown to be associated with PTSD, as supported by previous
evidence. This ﬁnding was replicated in their replication cohort. Other genes that showed
association include AHRR gene, in which decreased methylation was observed upon
smoking [130].

Interestingly, genes related to immune response show alterations in PTSD
patients [64,129–132]. Additionally, several studies examining traumatic stress exposure
in patients found high associations between epigenetic changes and immune system dysregu-
lation and/or PTSD development [64,131,132]. According to Mehta et al. (2017), who assessed
211 veterans, methylation changes of the DOCK2 gene that connect to immune dysregulation
and development of PTSD symptoms were found [132]. Furthermore, the hypomethylation
of several CpG sites located within TPR and AHHR related to traumatic stress and PTSD were
directly linked with immune system complications such as increased inflammation [64,131].
Interestingly, when assessing the cytokine levels in relation to these epigenetic changes, results
indicated that the cytokine changes (IL4, IL2, and TNFa) differ according to the subject’s
condition (PTSD, child abuse, or total life stress) [64].

This does not necessarily deﬁne a causality but signiﬁes the potential for the inﬂuence
of immune function on PTSD symptoms or alteration of general immune function in
reaction to stressful exposures. Among other genes with correlation to PTSD symptoms
is PARK2, which is involved in dopamine regulation and is associated with Parkinson’s
disease [84]. Further studies on DNA methylation patterns in the brain tissue of PTSD
patients, in parallel with their blood samples, show that peripheral epigenetic alterations
can mirror epigenomic alterations in the brain [130]. This highlights the possibility of
ﬁnding PTSD biomarkers based on peripheral tissues [130].

Surprisingly, the study by Mehta and colleagues conducted in 2019 was one of
the few studies that investigated transgenerational inheritance of epigenetics, studying
299 veterans diagnosed with PTSD. They tested the FKBP5 gene that has been previously
identiﬁed in the literature as a transgenerational transmitted gene (parent to child). Their
results in sperm showed four signiﬁcant CpG sites within this gene that were correlated
with PTSD [133].

More recently, Snijders and Maihofer et al. (2020) conducted one of the largest EWAS
using longitudinal DNA methylation data of three male military cohorts, i.e., Marine
Resiliency Study (MRS), Army STARRS and PRISMO (N = 266, 123 with PTSD) [129]. Their
combined results point to three differentially methylated positions (DMP) and twelve differ-
entially methylated regions (DMR), four of which were located within the human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) region. Genes located within this region are known to have immune-related
functions, and dysregulations within the immune system are not uncommon in PTSD [129].
Interestingly, one DMP and one DMR were located within MAD1L1, a gene previously asso-
ciated with PTSD [134]. Along with the study conducted by Rutten et al. (2018), this study
encourages the use of longitudinally collected DNA methylation data. Interestingly, it has

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

12 of 21

been found that these epigenetic changes can be reversible once established. Treatment of
PTSD seemingly reverses some of the DNA changes that are related to the development
of PTSD, as demonstrated by Vinkers and colleagues. They found that successful treat-
ment resulted in methylation changes in 12 different DMRs, of which ZFP57-increased
methylation was the most consistent for PTSD symptom improvement [135].

5.2. Transgenerational Passing of Epigenetic Traits

Epigenetic inheritance points to the transmission of epigenetic markers from parents
to their offspring, hence from one generation to the next. The traits of the offspring are
affected without alteration of the primary nucleotide sequence of their DNA. Experiments
performed in the past showed that there is a reset of the patterns of DNA methylation in the
whole mammalian genome in each generation. This suggests that epigenetic information
would not necessarily be inherited [136,137]. Nonetheless, the mammalian epigenetic
information is usually not erased between generations and epigenetic modiﬁcations can be
transmitted through the germline after its exposure [136,138–141].

5.3. Identifying miRNAs as Biomarkers of PTSD

The diagnosis of PTSD is based on reported symptoms and psychological history.
However, there is no real diagnostic tool that can conﬁrm the diagnosis. There are signiﬁ-
cant beneﬁts accompanying the identiﬁcation of a biomarker for the diagnosis of PTSD.
Below, we will elaborate on the possible role of miRNAs as a potential biomarker.

Studies have shown that miRNA proﬁles could serve as ideal disease biomarker can-
didates due to their relative stability and presence in several peripheral bioﬂuids [142]. The
most common assays that are being used to investigate miRNA expression are microarrays,
high-throughput sequencing approaches, or quantitative PCR arrays [143,144]. To date,
eight studies have aimed to identify blood-based circulating miRNAs associated with
PTSD in humans using one of these approaches [4,99,145–150]. Of these, one study per-
formed a total RNA discovery study and found just one upregulated miRNA in PTSD cases
(miR-21) [147]. Another study performed a targeted search for the implication of miR-15a
following childhood trauma [145], while Wingo et al. (2015) found two downregulated
miRNAs in PTSD with comorbid depression as compared to healthy controls (miR-212-3p

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

13 of 21

and miR-3130-5p) [150]. The ﬁve remaining studies identiﬁed several miRNAs which were
either up- or downregulated in military personnel [4,99,146,148,149]. However, comparing
ﬁndings between these studies reveals very little overlap. This may, at least partly, be due
to most studies using relatively small sample sizes and different study assays [151]. This
further calls for a need for larger studies to replicate some of the current ﬁndings.

While circulating miRNAs are protected from degradation by being bound to Arg-
onaute2 proteins or high-density lipoproteins [152,153], a portion is also found packed
within vesicles such as exosomes [154]. The ﬁnding that exosomes are involved in intercel-
lular communication led to an increase in the number of studies researching the (miRNA)
content of blood-based exosomes. Interestingly, exosomes have also been found to cross the
blood–brain barrier and carry cell type-speciﬁc surface markers [155–157]. By speciﬁcally
isolating peripheral exosomes exhibiting L1CAM (CD171), a transmembrane protein which
is strongly enriched in brain tissue, researchers are now able to indirectly gain insights
into (patho) physiological mechanisms occurring within the central nervous system [158].
Although, to the best of our knowledge, this method has not yet been applied to psychiatric
disorders, the ﬁrst studies examining the content of blood-based neuron-derived exosomes
of patients with Alzheimer’s disease [159,160] show great promise in using these vesicles
as biomarkers for cognitive impairment. This in turn opens up new avenues to explore the
potential of delivering miRNA mimics or antagomirs to the brain through exosomes.

6. Future Perspectives

With advances in technologies, reductions in cost, and developments and standardi-
sation of analytical workﬂows, we foresee that genome-wide epigenetic screenings will
be increasingly applied in PTSD research. The increased resolution of microarray-based
screening (EPIC array) and the establishment of sequencing, WGBS, and RRBS in the ﬁeld,
will generate more precise maps of changes in DNA methylation that relate to the develop-
ment or progression of PTSD. Some speciﬁc projected advances include the following: ﬁrst
of all, aside from DNA methylation, the study of other epigenetic marks will increase and
substantially improve our knowledge on their implications in PTSD.

In contrast to methylation, 5-hmC markers in promoter regions have been associated
with gene activity rather than repression [161]. The brain is the main organ where the
probably deliberate and stable presence of DNA hydroxymethylation markers has been
established [162]. With respect to measurement technologies, bisulphite sequencing can-
not distinguish between cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation. Modiﬁcations
of the protocol, as used in oxidative bisulphite sequencing (oxBS) and Tet-assisted bisul-
phite sequencing (TAB-Seq), allow us to detect both markers separately [163,164]. Speciﬁc
investigation of DNA hydroxymethylation has already been applied to increase our under-
standing of other brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease [165]. Doing the same for
PTSD will further increase our understanding of this disorder.

Furthermore, another layer can be added to our understanding of PTSD by the study
of histone modiﬁcations. These marks can be determined in a genome-wide fashion
using a technology called ChIP-seq, which stands for chromatin immunoprecipitation
In short, histones are ﬁxed to the DNA that is fragmented, after which
sequencing.
antibodies recognising a speciﬁc histone modiﬁcation are used. Then, secondary antibodies
with attached beads are used to separate the DNA fragments bound to the modiﬁed
histones from the other DNA fragments. Sequencing of the bound fragments then tells us
where the histone modiﬁcations were present. For PTSD, it has been applied to characterize
epigenetic changes in white blood cells for H3 trimethylation at K4, K9, K27, and K36 [99].
Applying it to additional histone modiﬁcations, such as acetylation, and in larger cohorts,
or even to generated neurons or organoids from PTSD patients as well could increase our
understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, it could be used to
study more individual epigenetic signatures, as has been performed to characterize H3–K4
trimethylation (H3K4me3) changes in cortical neurons in schizophrenia [166].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 10743

Another angle that warrants further study is the passing of traumatic stress-induced
biological changes across generations. This has been studied in the offspring of war victims,
for example by examining the offspring of holocaust survivors [167]. Differences were
observed, but unravelling the underlying mechanisms warrants further investigations [167].
Stress-induced epigenetic changes have also been shown to be inherited by offspring
and drive such inheritance, as shown for FKBP5 methylation [133,168,169]. However,
this is mostly explained by direct exposure in utero or via exposed germ cells, called
intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. As such, true epigenetic inheritance without
exposure, called transgenerational, can only be studied in third-generation offspring in the
female line and second-generation offspring in the male line. For now, experimental studies
have not found any evidence for true epigenetic inheritance. A possible path towards
studying this with respect to human PTSD would be to examine the grandchildren of
holocaust survivors or victims of other wars. However, such studies need to be carefully
designed to distinguish epigenetic inheritance from secondary traumatization. Studies
would need to collect rich phenotypic information to elucidate the mechanisms and prove
or disprove true transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

Among the many possible contributing factors to the development of PTSD, only a
few of them had gained practical utility in the day-to-day care of the affected patients.
Most conventional drugs currently used to treat PTSD have common actions among many
other stress disorders, do not have enough disease speciﬁcity, and are symptom-based,
such as the use of antidepressants. Importantly, none of these medications speciﬁcally
target the underlying genetic or epigenetic pathologies. Proper management of patients
merits due consideration of the epigenetic factors and novel research in drug development
targeting these complex molecular changes. Increasing mechanistic understanding may
thereby help identify subtypes of the disease. Additionally, novel biomarkers may pave
the way for more and more targeted preventive measures. Additionally, current preventive
measures do not consider possible transgenerational passing of psychiatric traits to the
next generations.

In the longer future, elucidating the role of biological alterations, including epigenetic
processes in susceptibility to traumatic stress exposure could promote breakthroughs
in the development of new drug targets and biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. The
identiﬁcation of predictive biomarkers that may distinguish between individuals at high
or low risk of developing PTSD following trauma exposure could enable more effective
preventive strategies and early interventions.

7. Conclusions

Fundamental research has progressively given insight into the molecular mechanisms

and cellular processes underlying the pathophysiology of PTSD.

Among many physiological alterations in PTSD, including the potential presence of blood
biomarkers, PTSD is characterized by structural and functional brain changes. In addition,
some of the underlying metabolic effects of conventional pharmacotherapies for PTSD have
been linked to epigenetic changes, which also occur throughout disease progression.

This points to the fact that future preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic paradigms
must take complex molecular and epigenetic alterations into consideration. This also
promotes understanding of this disorder through a more organic rather than a purely
psychological perspective.
