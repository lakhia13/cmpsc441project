Abstract

Background: Various paper-based mood charting instruments are used in the monitoring of symptoms in bipolar
disorder. During recent years an increasing number of electronic self-monitoring tools have been developed. The
objectives of this systematic review were 1) to evaluate the validity of electronic self-monitoring tools as a method
of evaluating mood compared to clinical rating scales for depression and mania and 2) to investigate the effect of
electronic self-monitoring tools on clinically relevant outcomes in bipolar disorder.
Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature, reported according to the Preferred Reporting items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and The
Cochrane Library were searched and supplemented by hand search of reference lists. Databases were searched for 1)
studies on electronic self-monitoring tools in patients with bipolar disorder reporting on validity of electronically
self-reported mood ratings compared to clinical rating scales for depression and mania and 2) randomized
controlled trials (RCT) evaluating electronic mood self-monitoring tools in patients with bipolar disorder.

Results: A total of 13 published articles were included. Seven articles were RCTs and six were longitudinal studies.
Electronic self-monitoring of mood was considered valid compared to clinical rating scales for depression in six out of
six studies, and in two out of seven studies compared to clinical rating scales for mania.
The included RCTs primarily investigated the effect of heterogeneous electronically delivered interventions; none of the
RCTs investigated the sole effect of electronic mood self-monitoring tools. Methodological issues with risk of bias at
different levels limited the evidence in the majority of studies.

Conclusions: Electronic self-monitoring of mood in depression appears to be a valid measure of mood in contrast to
self-monitoring of mood in mania. There are yet few studies on the effect of electronic self-monitoring of mood in
bipolar disorder. The evidence of electronic self-monitoring is limited by methodological issues and by a lack of RCTs.
Although the idea of electronic self-monitoring of mood seems appealing, studies using rigorous methodology
investigating the beneficial as well as possible harmful effects of electronic self-monitoring are needed.

severity

Background
In bipolar disorder research, there has during the last
decade been an emerging shift in illness paradigm from
a focus on affective episodes to an increasing focus on
inter-episodic mood instability [1, 2]. Many patients with
bipolar disorder
remain symptomatic during inter-
episode periods and experience significant subsyndromal
day-to-day or week-to-week mood swings that are of
greater severity than those experienced by healthy indi-
viduals and appear to reflect illness activity [2]. Further,
these subsyndromal mood swings seem associated with
high risk of relapse, hospitalization and impaired func-
tioning [1, 3–5]. Continuous monitoring and assessment
of mood instability and other variables possibly reflect-
ing illness activity in detail, including measures of dur-
ation,
symptoms, may
and frequency of
therefore be clinically relevant since it would allow for
early intervention on subsyndromal symptoms and ul-
timately prevention of full-blown affective episodes. Self-
reports are ubiquitous in psychiatric research, and vari-
ous mood charting instruments for self-monitoring are
frequently used in the management and monitoring of
depressive and manic symptoms in patients with bipolar
disorder. Traditionally these mood charting instruments
have been paper-based, such as the National Institute of
Mental Health LifeChart Method (NIMH-LCM) [6], the
Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar
Disorder (STEP-BP) the Mood Chart (mood chart no
longer available online) and the ChronoSheet [7] and
have been shown valid compared to clinical rating scales
for depression and mania [8, 9]. Paper-based mood
charting instruments can be viewed as facilitating tools
helping patients with bipolar disorder gain illness
insight, facilitate patient empowerment, teach patients to
recognize early warning signs of recurrence of affective
episodes and enable individualized characterization of
mood instability in detail. However, several issues limit-
ing the usefulness of paper-based mood charting instru-
ments have been addressed, such as low compliance and
potential recall bias when reporting data retrospectively,
i.e. where patients complete batches of daily ratings at a
single time (sometimes referred to as hoarding or back-
filling) [10–13]. During recent years there has been an
increasing growth of e-mental health technologies [14],
including electronic platforms offering tools for self-
monitoring of mood. The electronic approach for self-
monitoring of mood offers ecological momentary
assessments [15], a monitoring technique for assess-
ment in real-time and in naturalistic settings, offers the
ability to verify the timing and compliance of data
collection, eliminates the need for costly and error-
prone data entry, may help remind patients to perform
the self-monitoring and may have higher usability than
paper-based versions.

However, it remains unclear whether the severity of
self-monitored mood registered using electronic self-
monitoring tools is a valid measure compared to vali-
dated clinical rating scales for depression and mania,
which are currently used as the golden standard for
assessing the severity of depressive and manic symptoms
in patients with bipolar disorder. Furthermore,
it
remains unclear to what extent the use of electronic
mood self-monitoring tools affects clinically relevant
outcomes, and importantly whether there may in fact,
be harmful effects, e.g. self-monitoring of mood symp-
toms may induce depressive ruminations that may result
in increasing severity of depressive symptoms [16]. An
understanding and overview of these aspects is crucial in
order to guide the use and development of IT platforms
for electronic self-monitoring of mood in bipolar
disorder.

The objectives of the present systematic review were
thus 1) to evaluate the validity of electronic mood self-
monitoring tools compared to validated clinical rating
scales for depression and mania and 2) to evaluate the
evidence of the effect of electronic mood self-monitoring
tools on clinically relevant outcomes in randomized
controlled trials (RCT).

This is the first systematic review of electronic self-

monitoring of mood in patients with bipolar disorder.

Methods
This systematic review was conducted and reported ac-
cording to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement [17].
Methods of the review and eligibility criteria were estab-
lished in advance and documented in a review protocol
that can be retrieved from the authors upon request. No
modifications were made to the review protocol during
the review process.

Study selection
Eligibility criteria
Original studies involving IT platforms for electronic
self-monitoring of mood used by adult patients with
bipolar disorder ≥18 years of age and either reporting on
correlations between electronically self-monitored mood
and validated clinical rating scales for depression and
mania or RCTs assessing the effect of electronic self-
monitoring tools as an intervention were eligible for
review. The language of the publications was restricted
to English. The types of IT platforms for electronic self-
monitoring of mood were defined as cell phones, com-
puters, tablets, PDAs, smartphones and online devices.
Papers only describing the technical part of the IT plat-
forms, not including patients with bipolar disorder and/
or not reporting on correlations between electronic
mood self-monitoring and validated clinical rating scales

for depression and mania or the effect of electronic self-
monitoring as an intervention in RCTs in patients with
bipolar disorder were excluded from review. Where
multiple articles reported on different validated clinical
rating scales deriving from the same study and reported
on the same patient sample, all of these articles were
included for review.

Information sources and search strategy
Published studies were identified through searching the
electronic databases MEDLINE (January 1950 to July
2015), PsychINFO (1806 to July 2015), Embase (1974 to
July 2015) and The Cochrane Library (issue 6, 2015)
supplemented by hand search of
reference lists of
retrieved articles.

The literature search was conducted by one researcher
(MFJ) and employed the search terms/key words:
(telephone or mobile phone or cellular phone or cell
phone or smartphone or computer or telecommunications
or electronic or electronic device or text message or appli-
cation or app) and (bipolar disorder or manic depressive
psychosis or manic depressive disorder or mania or bipo-
lar affective disorder or manic or bipolar depression).

Study selection and data extraction
The flow diagram of
the study selection process is
presented in Fig. 1. All retrieved titles and abstracts were

(KM)

screened for eligibility by one researcher (MFJ). All
potentially relevant articles were retrieved and full-text
articles were then assessed for fulfilling eligibility. One
reviewer (MFJ) extracted the data from the included ar-
ticles and a second reviewer
independently
checked the extracted data. Any disagreements between
the researchers were resolved by discussion between
three of the researchers (MFJ, KM and LVK). The risk
and types of bias assessed in individual studies were se-
lection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition
bias, reporting bias and other biases as suggested by The
Cochrane Collaboration [18]. Any disagreements or
uncertainties related to bias evaluation were resolved by
discussion between the authors.

Ethics
The present systematic review did not need ethical
approval. Data presented are from individual studies
approved by local ethical commitees and consent
obtained in individual studies.

titles and additionally six titles were identified by hand
search. Of these, 4396 titles, including duplicates, were
excluded from review due to not fulfilling the eligibility
criteria, the main reasons for exclusion being 1) not
involving self-monitoring 2) not including patients with
bipolar disorder and 3) only providing the technical
description of
the IT platforms. Thus, 48 full-text
articles were further evaluated for eligibility. Of these, 35
articles were excluded from review due to 1) not de-
scribing a mood self-monitoring tool (n = 10) [19–28] 2)
not reporting on patient data (n = 13) [29–41], 3) being
review articles (n = 2) [42, 43], and 4) not reporting on
validated clinical rating scales for depression and mania
[44–53]. A total of 13 articles fulfilled the
(n = 10)
eligibility criteria and were included in the qualitative
analysis [12, 16, 54–64].

Study characteristics
Of the 13 included articles seven were RCTs [16, 57, 58,
60–63] and six had a longitudinal design (non-RCTs)
[12, 54–56, 59, 64]. One article did not present data
on follow-up period [55]. The remaining articles reported
follow-up periods ranging from 2 weeks to 24 months.
The sample sizes ranged from 10 to 233 patients and the
mean age ranged from 33.4 to 47.5 years. The included
studies were conducted in Europe [16, 55, 59, 60, 64],
USA [12, 56–58, 62], Canada [54], and Australia [61, 63],
respectively. The different IT platforms used for electronic
self-monitoring of mood in the studies were computers
(using e-mail or web interfaces) [12, 54, 55, 57, 60, 61,
63, 64], PDAs [56, 64] and smartphones [16, 58, 59,
62, 64], respectively.

Validity of electronic self-monitored mood compared to
validated clinical rating scales for depression and mania
Seven articles evaluated the validity of different elec-
tronic mood self-monitoring tools compared to vali-
dated clinical rating scales for depression and mania
[12, 54–56, 58, 59, 64] (Table 1). The studies included
a total of 206 patients with bipolar disorder with a
self-monitoring period ranging from 2 weeks
to
18 months. Four out of the seven articles reported on
compliance to mood self-monitoring with a mean
level missing data ranging between 6.1–57.9 %. Three
studies did not provide information on this matter.

Correlation with clinically rated depressive symptoms
Six (n = 179) of the seven articles evaluated the validity
of electronic self-monitoring of mood compared to clin-
ical rating scales for depression using the Montgomery
Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) [66] or the
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, clinician rated
(IDS-C) [67]. All of the six articles found a significant

[65],

correlation between self-monitored mood and clinical
rating scales for depression,
indicating that increasing
severity of self-monitored depressive mood correlated
with increasing scores of clinical rating scales for depres-
sion. Regression coefficients and slopes are presented in
Table 1, but not all studies provided both of these
statistical measures.

The monitoring tools used were PDAs [56, 64],
computers [12, 54, 64] and smartphones [58, 59, 68], re-
spectively. All but one article, which did not provide
data on this in the paper [56] investigated the validity of
electronic self-monitoring compared to clinical rating
scales for depression from corresponding days.

Correlation with clinically rated manic symptoms
All of
the seven articles evaluated the validity of
electronic self-monitoring of mood compared to clinical
rating scales for mania using the Young Mania Rating
Scale (YMRS) [69]. Two articles (n = 64) found a signifi-
cant correlation between self-monitored mood and the
clinical rating scale for mania [55, 64], indicating that
increasing severity of self-monitored manic mood corre-
lated increasing scores on the clinical rating scale for
mania. One study (n = 18) found a significant positive
correlation between self-monitored mood and the
clinical rating scale for mania after 6 weeks of mood
self-monitoring, but not at baseline [58]. Regression
coefficients and slopes are presented in Table 1, but not
all studies provided both of these statistical measures.
The monitoring tools used were PDAs [56, 64], com-
puters [12, 54, 55, 64] and smartphones [58, 59, 64], re-
spectively. All but one article, which did not provide
data on this in the paper [56] investigated the validity of
electronic self-monitoring compared to clinical rating
scales for mania from corresponding days.

Effect of electronic mood self-monitoring tools on
clinically relevant outcomes in randomized controlled trials
Of the 13 included articles seven were RCTs including a
total of 759 patients with bipolar disorder involving a
follow-up period ranging from 12 weeks to 12 months
[16, 57, 58, 60–63] (further details are described in
Table 2 and in Additional file 1).

Two of the RCTs aimed primarily at investigating dif-
ferences in compliance rates between using an electronic
mood self-monitoring tool compared to using paper-
and-pencil mood self-monitoring [57, 58] and reported
on differences in symptom scores as secondary out-
comes. The first study (n = 48) reported that the inter-
vention group showed significantly higher compliance to
mood self-monitoring compared to the control group.
No difference in Clinical Global Impression Severity
(CGI-S) score was found between the two groups [57].
The second study (n = 40) reported that the intervention

group showed significantly higher variability of self-
monitored mood compared to the control group. Further,
a higher compliance to mood self-monitoring was found
in the control group [58].

Five of the seven included RCTs investigated the effect of
different electronically delivered intervention programmes
including a self-monitoring tool on symptoms of illness
activity in patients with bipolar disorder [16, 60–63].

One study (n = 122) reported on a RCT investigating
the effect of an online interactive intervention based on
principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and psychoe-
ducation including self-monitoring (‘Living with Bipolar’)
(intervention group) compared to treatment-as-usual
(TAU) (control group). The study reported that the inter-
vention group showed significant improvement in self-
assessed quality of life, recovery, symptoms severity and
social functioning compared to the control group [60].

Another study (n = 233) reported on a RCT investigat-
ing the effect of a web-based psychoeducational program
including self-monitoring (Recovery Road for Bipolar
Disorder) (intervention group) compared to a control
group directed to web-sites on healthy lifestyles. The study
reported that there were no significant differences be-
tween the two groups in any of the defined outcome [61].
The third study (n = 82) reported on a RCT investigat-
ing the effect of smartphone-based personalized self-
management strategies based on self-reported mood
scores (intervention group) compared to paper-and-pencil
mood self-monitoring (control group). The study reported
no significant differences in depressive and manic symp-
toms between the two groups at the end of study [62].

The fourth study (n = 156) reported on a RCT investigat-
ing the effect of an online psychoeducation, mood tracking,
discussion boards and cognitive behavioral therapy pro-
gram (MoodSwings Plus) (intervention group) compared
to an online psychoeducation, mood tracking and discus-
sion boards program (MoodSwings) (control group). The
study reported that the intervention group showed signifi-
cant reductions in self-assessed manic symptoms com-
pared to the control group, but no difference was observed
in relation to self-assessed depressive symptoms [63]. The
last study, by the authors, (n = 78) reported on a RCT in-
vestigating the effect of smartphone-based self-monitoring
including a feedback loop to the clinicians (MONARCA)
(intervention group) compared to a placebo smartphone
and TAU (control group). The study reported no significant
differences between the two groups in any of the defined
outcomes. Sub-analyses showed that the intervention group
had more depressive symptoms and fewer manic symptoms
than the control group during the study period [16].

Risk of bias within individual studies
All of the included articles but one [55] included only
outpatients. Notably only one of the longitudinal studies

provided data on the patients who were excluded from
participating in the study [59]. Three of the six longitu-
dinal studies reported on data collected with assessors
who were blinded to the electronic self-monitoring data
[55, 58, 59]. Thus, most included longitudinal studies
were evaluated to be at risk of selection bias, perform-
ance bias and/or detection bias at some level.

In two articles on RCTs no information regarding
sequence generation and allocation concealment was
provided [57, 58]. Thus, these RCTs were assessed to
possibly be at risk of selection bias.

One of the RCTs did not state whether the outcome
assessors were blinded to randomization group and were
therefore evaluated to be at risk of possible detection bias
[57]. Further to this point, given the nature of the inter-
vention (the patients were unblinded to intervention) in
the included RCTs none of the studies were double
blinded, and therefore naturally all at risk of performance
bias. Furthermore, three of the RCTs investigated the
effect of different electronically delivered intervention pro-
grammes including mood self-monitoring on self-assessed
outcome measures with no observer/researcher blinded
outcome measures [60, 61, 63].

Discussion
This is the first systematic review of the evidence of the
validity of electronic mood self-monitoring tools using IT
platforms as methods for assessing mood in adult patients
with bipolar disorder compared with clinical rating scales
for depression and mania. Further, the evidence of the ef-
fect of electronic mood self-monitoring tools on clinically
relevant outcomes in RCTs was assessed. A total of 13
published articles were included. The included articles
were heterogeneous, employing various monitoring IT
platforms

and included different

clinically

Electronic self-monitored mood was found valid com-
pared to clinical rating scales for depression in six out of
six studies comprising a total of 179 outpatients [12, 54,
56, 58, 59, 64], but only two studies found a correlation
between electronic self-monitored mood and a validated
rating scale for mania [55, 64]. Thus, the present review
suggests that despite different bias issues it seems pos-
sible for patients to validly evaluate the severity of their
depressive symptoms, but specifically difficult to report
emerging manic symptoms in a valid way and may be
due to decreased illness insight during hypomania/mania
[70]. Furthermore, as mentioned most of the studies
included only outpatients who did not present with
severe levels/ high scores on clinical rating scales for
depression and mania. The validity of the electronic self-
monitoring tools may be both overestimated as well as
underestimated disregarding the possible difficulty of

Faurholt-Jepsen et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:7 

Page 10 of 14

self-monitoring the severity of symptoms in more severe
cases.

The studies included describe convergent validity of
electronic self-monitoring tools. Other variables such as
activity level and sleep length could represent parame-
ters for self-monitoring that may correlate with clinical
rating scales for depression and mania, but content val-
idity was not investigated in the present review. Further,
the reliability and predictive validity of the electronic
self-monitoring tools were not
investigated in the
present review.

Paper-based self-monitoring tools for depressive mood
registered using different types of paper-based tools has
been shown to significantly correlate with the scores on
clinical rating scales for depression in a number of studies
[7, 9, 71–73]. The severity of self-monitored manic mood
has been shown to correlate with the scores of clinical rat-
ing scales for mania in a number of studies [8, 9, 74, 75],
however, not in all studies [7]. Further, other parameters
such as activity level may correlate with the scores of clin-
ical rating scales for mania [7]. Two of the RCTs included
researcher blinded validated clinical rating scales for de-
pression and mania as outcomes [16, 62]. These studies
could potentially investigate the validity of electronic
mood self-monitored compared to clinical rating scales
for depression and mania and thus further contribute to
the knowledge in this area.

It should be mentioned that a paper by the authors
analyzing the validity between mood self-monitoring and
clinical rating scales for depression and mania has been
accepted for publication [76]. This
study used a
smartphone-based mood self-monitoring tool and found
a significant correlation between self-monitored mood
and validated ratings scales for both depression and
mania, respectively.

Using electronic self-monitoring tools may offer solu-
tions regarding issues of low compliance and potential
recall bias that are present when using paper-based self-
monitoring tools. However, the results presented in this
review suggest that it seems difficult for patients to
evaluate manic symptoms calling for other new and
more objective real-time electronic methods to monitor-
ing the severity of manic symptoms in patients with
bipolar disorder.

To provide a more complete and inclusive picture of the
scientific research on electronic self-monitoring the RCTs
using electronic self-monitoring tools as a part of an inter-
vention were evaluated. No study investigated the sole
effect of electronic self-monitoring of mood as an inter-
vention in itself, but investigated the effect of different
electronically delivered intervention programmes with
electronic self-monitoring of mood represented as part of
the intervention. The evidence of the effect of electronic
self-monitoring was limited by methodological issues and

by a lack of RCTs. Notably, three of the RCTs investigating
the effect of electronically delivered interventions did not
report on any researcher blinded outcomes [60, 61, 63]
and thus introduces bias issues on the validity of the
results from these studies and introducing the risk of over-
estimating or underestimating the beneficial and harmful
effects of the interventions. One RCT [16], by the authors,
reported on potentially harmful effects of electronic self-
monitoring with more depressive symptoms but fewer
manic symptoms in the intervention group. A paper by
Scott & Colom discuss the issues of a differential effective-
ness of psychological interventions for manic and depres-
sive phases [77], and points out that the reasons for these
differential effects are not clear. Manic prodromes are
more distinct and may be easier to detect and treat more
quickly and effectively with pharmacotherapy than depres-
sive episodes [78]. On the contrary, depressive symptoms
are more difficult to differentiate from normal day-to-day
problems and may have a more gradual onset and
prolonged duration [79]. Considering electronic self-
intervention, the potential
monitoring a psychological
harmful effects on depressive symptoms as suggested by
the findings from the RCT by the authors [16] highlight
that electronic self-monitoring should not be uncritically
used or implemented in clinical practice and that import-
ant aspects need further clarification before it is imple-
mented as a standard tool.

If

there would be an effect of electronic self-
monitoring on the severity of depressive or manic symp-
toms, then self-monitoring would influence the variables
it measures (mood). Whether that would be a threat to
the reliability and validity is unknown and should be
investigated further.

In westerns countries nearly everyone has at least one
device that would be able to handle electronic self-
monitoring. The use of computers and/or tablets as tools
for electronic self-monitoring of mood require some
technical skills by the user and can be quite expensive to
acquire. However, most people have access to a com-
puter or tablet and know how to interact with simple
software systems. Computers and tablets allow for stor-
age and visual presentation of self-monitored data mak-
ing recognition of symptom patterns possible,
thus
potentially providing tools for increasing the patients’ ill-
ness insight and empowerment. PDAs represent a tool
that is possible for the patients to carry with them
during the day making continuous real-time electronic
self-monitoring in naturalistic settings
is possible.
However, when using a separate and non-standard
electronic device for self-monitoring of illness activity

stigmatization is present
electronic devices could replace PDAs as an electronic
self-monitoring tool in the years to come. Unlike com-
puters and PDAs, smartphones offer opportunities for

Faurholt-Jepsen et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:7 

Page 11 of 14

continuous electronic self-monitoring in naturalistic
environments that cannot be achieved using other types
of IT platforms. Since most people carry their cell
phone with them during most of the day and use it for
communicative purposes through various platforms the
risk of stigmatization is not present. Furthermore, the
number of smartphone users worldwide has been esti-
mated to reach 2.5 billion people by 2017 [80] which
makes smartphones an obvious tool for electronic self-
monitoring.

Patients willing to participate in studies using these
kinds of novel and technical electronic interventions
could represent a more motivated and technically
oriented group of patients with higher degree of illness
insight and willingness
to use the electronic self-
monitoring tools in question. As can be seen from some
of the included articles, compliance to self-monitoring
was highly variable, and patients participating were quite
young. Elucidation of possible technical barriers for
using an electronic device for self-monitoring among
non-technically oriented patient groups, perhaps in pa-
tients with higher age than in the included studies, could
be of interest. In addition, future studies should provide
more information on excluded patients and reasons for
declining to participate in studies in order to allow the
readers to better assess the level of generalizability of the
study results.

None of the included studies provided information
regarding the economical part of the development and
maintenance of
IT
electronic
platforms, and is likely a relevant factor in the develop-
ment of future efforts in this area as well as for the
clinical implementation.

Some limitations
mentioned. Telemedicine in general and e-mental health
are areas under great expansion and the investigations in
this area are published in very diverse forms and places
reflecting that this is an research area in the intersection
between two areas of research- medical research and IT
research. Therefore, conducting a search strategy that is
able to capture all relevant scientific literature is a chal-
lenge. A search on Google Scholar alone on electronic
self-monitoring in bipolar disorder resulted in 595.000
hits. Many commercial websites and smartphone appli-
cations (for both Android, iOS and Windows) for elec-
tronic self-monitoring exist in the App store and the
Google Play store. The search strategy for the present
review reflects that we aimed at systematically collecting
and reviewing published scientific studies in order to get
an overview of the validity of electronic mood self-
monitoring compared to validated clinical rating scales

and the evidence status related to using these kinds of
electronic self-monitoring tools.

Most of the included studies had a daily and moment-
ary frequency of self-monitoring, but one study used a
frequency of self-monitoring on a weekly basis. A recent
paper discussed differences in momentary and retro-
spective trait self-report techniques pointing out that
retrospective self-monitoring is influenced by peak mo-
ments with greater salience of moments that occur
closets in time to the assessment [13].

The interventions of the included RCTs were heteroge-
neous and often mood self-monitoring was a part of an
intervention, which incorporated mood self-monitoring
alongside other psychological interventions. In addition,
the RCTS employed various monitoring IT platforms and
included different clinically relevant outcomes. Thus,
comparing not only different mood self-monitoring tools
but also different interventions as well as outcomes is a
big challenge.

It should be noted that the authors did not have access
to the various electronic self-monitoring tools reviewed
apart from one of the tools for smartphones [16, 59].
Further, as pointed out by others [44] all of the self-
monitoring tools are different from one another allowing
illness
for calculation of many different measures of
activity and also making it difficult to compare findings
across studies.

One author (MFJ) selected all papers and extracted all
data, and one of the co-authors (KM) independently
checked the extracted data.

It should also be noted that in most of the articles the
patients had to provide the hardware for the electronic
self-monitoring themselves and no information regard-
ing economical compensation was given. None of the in-
cluded articles provided information regarding the cost
of developing and maintaining the electronic software
and the amount of possible technical problems with the
electronic self-monitoring systems. These aspects are
likely relevant factors that should be evaluated in future
studies.

It would be interesting to investigate the validity
between electronic mood self-monitored and validated
clinical rating scales for depression and mania and the
effect of electronic self-monitoring as an intervention in
a non-technically oriented group of patients with bipolar
disorder, and further to elucidate these aspects during
full-blown affective episodes.

Conclusions
This systematic review identified relatively few studies
investigating IT platforms for electronic self-monitoring
in adult patients with bipolar disorder. Electronic self-
monitoring of mood in depression appears to be a valid
measure of mood in contrast to self-monitoring of mood

blinded outcomes has scarcely been investigated and is
unknown. Whether electronic self-monitoring should
be considered an instrument or as an intervention or
both is unknown and future research should investigate
this further.

There is a need for further research using rigorous
methodology and more RCTs investigating the effect and
economic consequences of electronic self-monitoring
using different types of IT platforms in patients with bipo-
lar disorder. Furthermore, future RCTs should elucidate
possible harmful effects to inform whether the potential
benefits are worth the costs and potential risks.
