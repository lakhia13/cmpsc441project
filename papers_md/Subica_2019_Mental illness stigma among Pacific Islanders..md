Abstract

Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI) rarely seek mental health treatment for 
reasons that are minimally understood. To assess the mental illness stigma context in NHPI 
communities that may be contributing to low help-seeking, this study collected novel stigma data 
from two large U.S. NHPI communities from October 2017-January 2018, then compared this data 
to national stigma data from the U.S. public. Survey data were collected from 222 community-
dwelling NHPI participants recruited by research-trained NHPI staff. Surveys incorporated well-
established vignettes describing persons with major depression and schizophrenia. Study data 
were compared to U.S. general public data from the 2006 General Social Survey: the largest U.S. 
stigma study. Compared to the U.S. public, NHPI participants reported greater stigma toward 
mental illness in ways likely to impede help-seeking including: (1) more frequently endorsing 
stigmatizing causal attributions of depression and schizophrenia, (2) less frequently perceiving 
disorders as serious, and (3) more commonly desiring social distance from persons with 
depression. Study data are the first to reveal the presence of a strongly stigmatizing context in 
NHPI communities likely to hinder NHPI help-seeking. Thus, culturally tailoring anti-stigma 
interventions to appropriately target NHPI mental health attitudes and beliefs may prove effective 
in promoting NHPI help-seeking.

Introduction

Page 2

Mental illness stigma refers to the prejudicial beliefs, emotions, and behaviors of the general 
public that lead to discrimination against, and social disadvantaging and devaluing of, 
persons with mental illness (Corrigan, 2004; Link & Phelan, 2001). For persons with mental 
illness, stigma has been associated with adverse psychological (e.g., reduced self-esteem, 
poor mental health) and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., unemployment, lowered academic 
achievement, community exclusion) (Corrigan & Watson, 2002; Knifton et al., 2010; Link & 
Stuart, 2017; Yang et al., 2007). By threatening individuals with status loss and 
discriminatory consequences (Link & Phelan, 2001), stigma has been implicated by 
researchers and authorities such as the U.S. Surgeon General as the primary obstacle to 
mental health treatment and recovery (Corrigan, 2004; Hinshaw, 2007; U.S. DHHS, 1999).

Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI) represent an understudied U.S. racial 
group that endures heavy mental health burden but rarely engages in treatment (SAMHSA, 
2010; Ta et al., 2008). While the reasons for NHPIs’ restricted treatment engagement are 
poorly understood, we suspect the presence of a stigmatizing context in NHPI communities 
may play a crucial role in limiting NHPI help-seeking.

NHPI refers to persons originating from the thousands of islands of Polynesia, Micronesia, 
and Melanesia (OMB, 1997). Little is known about NHPI mental health (Braun et al., 2004; 
U.S. DHHS, 2001) despite NHPIs growing almost four times faster than the U.S. general 
population from 2000 to 2010 (35.0% vs. 9.7%; U.S. Census), and enduring similar adverse 
experiences at the hands of the U.S. as colonized American Indian and Alaskan Native 
populations. For instance, over half of the Native Hawaiian population were wiped out in the 
1700s by diseases (e.g., smallpox, measles) brought by Western colonists (Chun, 1994) 
before the U.S. overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy in 1895; marginalizing Native Hawaiians 
in their homelands and nearly extinguishing traditional Hawaiian language, customs, and 
practices (Bushnell, 1993). Similarly, the U.S. inflicted upon the Marshallese people 
immense historical trauma by conducting extensive nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands 
from 1946–1958, blanketing generations of Marshallese people, lands, and food sources in 
radioactive fallout (Yamada, 2004).

Because of the devastating impact of U.S. colonization, forced assimilation, and historical 
traumatization, many present day NHPIs experience severe socioeconomic and health 
disparities (Braun et al., 2004; Fong et al., 2003) including low socioeconomic status, 
problems obtaining health insurance and care, and elevated prevalence of obesity, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, and cancer (EPIC & AAAJ, 2014; Fong et al., 2003; Mau et al., 
2009; Salvail et al., 2008; Subica et al., 2017). Collectively, these place NHPIs at elevated 
risk for mental illness. Nationally, NHPI adolescents have the highest prevalence of 
depressed mood (36.1%) of all U.S. racial groups and nearly two times greater prevalence of 
attempted suicide than the general adolescent population (15.0% vs. 8.0%) (Subica et al.,

2017). Yet, despite their need, over 70% of NHPIs have reported avoiding or delaying 
needed treatment in the past year in recent data (Unpublished results) compared to 60% of 
the U.S. public (Kessler et al., 2001).

As stigma presents an important barrier to mental health help-seeking (Corrigan, 2004; 
Hinshaw, 2007; Knifton et al., 2007)—and therefore likely contributes to NHPIs’ limited 
help-seeking behavior—we performed the first known quantitative exploration of NHPI 
mental illness stigma to better understand why help-seeking is so restricted in this at-risk 
racial population. Using established measurement approaches (i.e., vignettes describing 
persons with major depression and schizophrenia) previously used to assess stigma in the 
U.S. public (Link et al., 1999; Pescosolido et al., 2010), this study sought to identify the 
overall mental illness stigma context present in NHPI communities that may be limiting 
NHPI help-seeking, and compare it to the national U.S. stigma context.

1.1.  Stigma Context Model of NHPI Mental Health Help-Seeking

Based on extant literature with non-NHPI populations, we propose that a stigma context 
(Corrigan et al., 2000) in NHPI communities that does not favor help-seeking would contain 
several elements. First, in an unfavorable context, community NHPIs would attribute mental 
disorders to social/moral causes (e.g., failings in a person’s or family’s character or 
behavior) rather than neurobiological causes (e.g., genes, brain dysfunction) as social/moral 
attributions are shown to be more stigmatizing and associate with worse stigma outcomes 
than neurobiological attributions (Pescosolido et al., 2013; Phelan et al., 2002; Shostak et al., 
2008; Yang et al., 2007).

Second, drawing from the Health Belief Model for mental health treatment utilization 
(Henshaw & Freedman-Doan, 2009; Janz & Becker, 1984), NHPIs would view mental 
disorders as not serious and likely to improve on its own without treatment. This follows 
findings that racial/ethnic minority help-seeking is most likely to occur when a mental 
disorder is recognized as serious and deemed unlikely to improve on its own without 
treatment (Cauce et al., 2002; Eriraldi et al.).

Third, in an unfavorable context, NHPIs would perceive persons with mental disorders as 
dangerous and desire social distance from them. Perceived dangerousness and social 
distance are postulated because they are believed to compose a backbone of mental illness 
stigma (Pescosolido et al., 2013) with dangerousness constituting a powerful mental illness 
stereotype (Angermeyer et al., 1999; Corrigan, 2000; Link et al., 1999; Penn et al., 1994; 
Pescosolido et al., 2013; Phelan & Link, 2004; Slovic et al., 1995) that leads to fear and 
desired social distance from persons with mental disorders (Angermeyer et al., 2003; 
Corrigan et al., 2000; Corrigan et al., 2001; Link et al., 1999).

Guided by our model, this study sought to identify whether NHPIs face a stigma context in 
their communities that does not favor help-seeking by examining NHPI community 
participants’ perceived: (1) causes, seriousness, and treatability of major depression and 
schizophrenia, and (2) dangerousness of, and desired social distance from, persons with 
these disorders (Pescosolido et al., 2010). Then, we contrasted our data with national data 
from the 2006 U.S. General Social Survey (GSS; Pescosolido et al., 2010)—the most recent

large-scale survey of mental illness stigma among the U.S. public—to determine whether the 
NHPI stigma context was more or less favorable toward help-seeking than the general U.S. 
context. Finally, to guide future stigma reduction efforts for NHPI populations, we explored 
which of our model factors would predict NHPI participants’ desired social distance from 
persons with mental disorders: the primary stigma indicator for this study.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Study Design

Surveys were conducted from October 2017-January 2018 with 120 Samoan adults living in 
a large urban community in Los Angeles County, California (which contained the largest 
NHPI population in the continental U.S.) and 100 Marshallese adults living in a large rural 
community in Northwest Arkansas (which contained the fastest growing NHPI population in 
the U.S.) (U.S. Census, 2010).

Study protocols were approved by the [redacted] IRB. Surveys were translated into Samoan 
and Marshallese via back translation (Brislin, 1970) with experienced NHPI translators 
translating the original English language surveys to Samoan and Marshallese and a second 
set of translators—blinded to the original measures—back translating the Samoan and 
Marshallese surveys to English. Back translated measures were compared to the original 
measures for accuracy, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion between 
investigators and translators.

Measures were administered as self-report, interview, or a mix of both (based on 
participants’ preference) in English, Samoan, or Marshallese by NHPI research staff trained 
in accordance with community-based participatory research principles (Israel et al., 2001). 
In total, 160 surveys were administered in English, 8 in Samoan, and 52 in Marshallese. 
Using non-probabilistic, respondent-driven sampling (Mays & Pope, 1995) due to the 
infeasibility of obtaining a probability sample from these hard-to-reach communities, a 
diverse range of participants were recruited by age and gender—following a planned 
enrollment table—from the target communities. To ensure a sample with diverse 
perspectives and experiences, staff recruited participants from a wide array of community 
institutions (e.g., cultural organizations, churches of different denominations, recreational 
and activity groups). Participants took 45–60 minutes to complete the informed consent and 
survey process and received a $15 gift card.

Representing the U.S. public, our 2006 GSS comparison sample consisted of 770 
noninstitutionalized adults (age 18 years or older) previously surveyed—with a 71.2% 
response rate—using a stratified probability approach to obtain a nationally representative 
sample (Pescosolido et al., 2010). To match our NHPI sample, only data from GSS 
participants randomly assigned to complete the major depression or schizophrenia vignettes 
were used for comparison.

2.2.  Measures

2.1.1.  Demographic and mental health variables—Demographic variables of age, 
gender, education, and NHPI and U.S. acculturation were assessed. Acculturation was

measured using the validated PI Acculturation scale (Borrows et al., 2011) containing 11 
items assessing NHPI acculturation (α = .81) and 11 items assessing U.S. acculturation (α 
= .83).

Participant depression and anxiety symptomology were assessed via the PHQ-9 (Kroenke & 
Spitzer) and GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006), respectively, to explore the possibility that 
experiencing mental health symptomology (thus presumably increasing mental health need) 
may predict lower stigma (as evidenced by reduced desire for social distance). Both tools 
generate cumulative severity scores for depression and anxiety. For similar reasons, alcohol 
use was measured via the 3-item AUDIT-C (Bush et al., 1998), which illuminates adult 
alcohol-related problems via summed score. All measures evidenced strong internal 
consistency: PHQ-9 α = .86, GAD-7 α = .88, AUDIT-C α = .89.

2.1.2.  Vignettes—Vignettes depicting an NHPI man or woman with major depressive 
disorder or schizophrenia and associated stigma measurement items were drawn from 
modules used in the U.S. GSS (Link et al., 1999; Pescosolido et al., 2010) and international 
Stigma in Global Context-Mental Health Study (Pescosolido et al., 2013). The vignettes 
were deemed optimal for use with our NHPI populations as they had been previously 
culturally translated and used to assess stigma across 16 different countries in the Stigma in 
Global Context-Mental Health Study (Pescosolido et al., 2013).

Each participant read one of the following vignettes randomly varied by gender and 
disorder:

Major Depressive Disorder:  Tavita/Mele is a Samoan/Marshallese man/woman. For the 
last two weeks Tavita/Mele has been feeling really down. S/He wakes up in the morning 
with a flat, heavy feeling that sticks with him/her all day long. S/He isn’t enjoying things the 
way he/she normally would. In fact, nothing seems to give him/her pleasure. Even when 
good things happen, they don’t seem to make Tavita/Mele happy. S/He pushes on through 
his/her days, but it is really hard. The smallest tasks are difficult to accomplish. S/He finds it 
hard to concentrate on anything. S/He feels out of energy and out of steam. And even though 
Tavita/Mele feels tired, when night comes s/he can’t get to sleep. Tavita/Mele feels pretty 
worthless, and very discouraged. Tavita/Mele’s family has noticed that s/he hasn’t been him/
herself for about the last month, and that s/he has pulled away from them. Tavita/Mele just 
doesn’t feel like talking.

Schizophrenia:  Tavita/Mele is a Samoan/Marshallese man/woman. Up until a year ago, life 
was pretty okay for Tavita/Mele. But then, things started to change. S/he thought that people 
around him/her were making disapproving comments, and talking behind his/her back. 
Tavita/Mele was convinced that people were spying on him/her and that they could hear 
what s/he was thinking. Tavita/Mele lost his/her drive to participate in his/her usual work 
and family activities and retreated to his/her home, eventually spending most of his/her day 
in his/her room. Tavita/Mele became so preoccupied with what s/he was thinking that s/he 
skipped meals and stopped bathing regularly. At night, when everyone else was sleeping, 
s/he was walking back and forth in his/her room. Tavita/Mele was hearing voices even

though no one else was around. These voices told him/her what to do and what to think. S/he 
has been living this way for six months.

2.1.3.  Attributions—Using a four-point scale (1=very unlikely, 4=very likely), 
participants were asked how likely the characters’ situation was caused by eight potential 
causes: “chemical imbalance in the brain,” “genetic or inherited problem,” “own bad 
character,” “way person was raised,” “God’s will,” “mental illness,” “physical illness,” and 
“life’s normal ups and downs.” Neurobiological conception was coded if participants 
endorsed “chemical imbalance in the brain” or “genetic or inherited problem” as “likely” or 
“very likely.” Sociomoral conception was coded if “own bad character” or “way person was 
raised” were similarly endorsed.

2.1.4.  Seriousness and treatability—Seriousness was assessed with the following 
item: “First, how serious would you consider Tavita/Mele’s problem to be—very serious, 
somewhat serious, not very serious, or not serious at all?” Treatability was evaluated by 
asking participants to rate on a four-point scale (1=very unlikely, 4=very likely) how likely 
the character’s situation would improve: (1) “on its own,” (2) with mental health treatment 
(such as seeing a therapist, psychologist, doctor),” and (3) “with traditional Samoan/
Marshallese treatment.”

2.1.5.  Dangerousness and social distance—To assess perceived dangerousness, 
participants were asked to rate on a four-point scale (1=very unlikely, 4=very likely) how 
likely Tavita/Mele would act violently toward other people and him/herself. To assess 
desired social distance, the five-item GSS social distance measure (Link et al., 1999; 
Pescosolido et al., 2010) queried participants’ willingness on a four-point scale (1=definitely 
willing, 4=definitely unwilling) to engage in the following behaviors with Tavita/Mele: (1) 
move next door, (2) hang out for a night, (3) make friends, (4) work closely on a job, and (5) 
marry into the family. Two NHPI-specific items were added to assess willingness to have 
Tavita/Mele: (1) help out (e.g., serve food, host), and (2) speak/perform at traditional 
community events/celebrations (e.g., wedding, funeral, births) called fa’alavelave. Scores 
from all scale items were averaged. Higher scores indicated greater social distance. Internal 
consistency for the NHPI-specific seven-item scale was excellent (α = 0.88), improving on 
the original five-item scale (α = 0.86).

2.2.  Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed in SPSS v. 24. Descriptive statistics generated frequencies, means, and 
standard deviations. To determine percentages for the attribution, seriousness, treatability, 
dangerousness, and social distance variables, which utilized four-point scales, variables were 
dichotomized as: (1) “likely” for “very likely” and “somewhat likely” and “unlikely” for 
“very unlikely” “somewhat unlikely” responses, and (2) “willing” for “definitely willing” 
and “probably willing” responses and “unwilling” for “definitely unwilling” and “probably 
unwilling” responses. To identify predictors of desired social distance (i.e., mental illness 
stigma), the 7-item social distance mean was logistically regressed on: (1) control variables 
of age, gender, education, vignette completed (i.e., depression, schizophrenia), NHPI and 
U.S. acculturation, (2) mental health variables of depression, general anxiety, and alcohol

use, (3) dangerousness variables of violence toward others and self, and (4) causal 
attribution variables of chemical imbalance in brain, genetic/inherited problem, own bad 
character, way person was raised, God’s will, life’s ups and downs, mental illness, and 
physical illness.

3.  Results

Table 1 provides NHPI sample characteristics. The majority of participants (N = 222) were 
women (57.2%) and possessed high school or lower education (57.3%). Participants 
reported significantly higher mean NHPI acculturation than mean U.S. acculturation, 
suggesting on average, participants more strongly identified with, and engaged in, NHPI 
over U.S. cultural beliefs and practices.

The mean social distance scores for the NHPI-adapted 7-item scale and original 5-item scale 
were identical (M = 2.6), suggesting convergent validity for the NHPI-specific scale. Thus, 
we felt comfortable utilizing our NHPI-tailored mean score as the dependent variable in the 
logistic model.

3.1.  Attributions

Table 2 reports the percentage of participants that endorsed the causal attributions for mental 
illness. Most NHPI participants correctly identified the characters as experiencing mental 
illness. The vast majority of participants endorsed sociomoral attributions for major 
depression (72.3%) and schizophrenia (86.1%) while fewer participants endorsed 
neurobiological attributions for major depression (60.5%) and schizophrenia (75.3%). A 
substantial proportion endorsed both sociomoral and neurobiological attributions for major 
depression (50.4%) and schizophrenia (64.4%).

The most frequently endorsed non-aggregated attribution for major depression was life’s 
normal ups and downs followed by mental illness and physical illness. For schizophrenia, 
mental illness was the most commonly endorsed non-aggregated attribution followed by 
physical illness, chemical imbalance in the brain, life’s normal ups and downs, and a genetic 
or inherited problem.

Relative to the U.S. public, NHPI participants had significantly higher endorsement of a 
sociomoral attribution for major depression (72.3% vs. 54.1%; p<0.01) and schizophrenia 
(86.1% vs. 51.5%; p<0.01) but significantly lower endorsement of a neurobiological 
attribution for major depression (60.5% vs. 87.8%; p<0.01) and schizophrenia (75.3% vs. 
94.9%; p<0.01). Participants also endorsed God’s will more frequently than the U.S. public 
for major depression (34.2% vs. 12.8%; p<0.01) and schizophrenia (23.8% vs. 15.2%; 
p<0.05).

3.2.  Seriousness and treatability

Approximately 90% of NHPI participants perceived major depression and schizophrenia as 
a somewhat serious or very serious problem. These were significantly lower rates than 
among the U.S. public (p<0.01). For treatability, 80.2% and 82.2% of participants believed 
mental health treatment would improve major depression and schizophrenia, respectively,

which was significantly lower (p<0.01) than the U.S. public’s rates of 96.4% and 97.9%. In 
contrast, 47.1% and 33.7% of participants believed major depression and schizophrenia 
would improve without treatment, respectively, which was significantly higher (p<0.01) than 
the U.S. public’s rates of 34.4% and 10.5%.

3.3.  Dangerousness and social distance

As shown in Table 3, the person described in the vignette as having schizophrenia was more 
frequently perceived to be potentially violent than the person described as having major 
depression. For both disorders described, self-violence was more frequently endorsed than 
violence toward others. NHPI participants had significantly lower endorsement of self-
violence than the U.S. public for major depression (54.6 vs. 71.7%; p<.01) and 
schizophrenia (70.3% vs. 83.4%; p<.01). Participants and the U.S. public had equal rates of 
perceived violence toward others for both disorders.

Participants desired equivalent mean social distance from persons with major depression and 
schizophrenia (M = 2.51 vs. 2.59). Participants most frequently reported unwillingness to 
have the persons described in the vignette marry into their families. Other situations with 
high rates of social distancing included becoming neighbors, working closely on a job, and 
speaking/performing at a fa’alavelave ceremony (where significant potential for social 
embarrassment of the host may exist). Situations with lower rates of social distancing were 
having persons with mental disorders as friends or helpers at a fa’alavelave.

Toward persons described in the vignette as having major depression, NHPI participants 
reported higher rates of social distancing than the U.S. public on unwillingness to move next 
door (50.4% vs. 19.2%; p<.01), socialize (43.7% vs. 30.3%; p<.05), and have them marry 
into their family (69.8% vs. 54.6%; p<.05). Toward persons described in the vignette as 
having schizophrenia, NHPI participants and the U.S. public had similar rates of 
unwillingness across all queried situations except higher rates of unwillingness by the U.S. 
public to work closely with the person at a job (64.9% vs. 49.5%; p<.05).

3.5.  Regression of social distance

Because desired social distance from persons with mental disorders was high among NHPI 
participants and represents a fundamental marker of stigma (Pescosolido et al., 2013), we 
conducted a regression analysis of desired social distance to identify possible predictors of 
this core stigma marker (Table 4). After adjusting for all covariates in the model, no control 
variables (i.e., age, gender, education, vignette completed, NHPI and U.S. acculturation) 
independently predicted social distance. Greater severity of depression and alcohol use—but 
not anxiety—among participants independently predicted decreased social distance (p<.05). 
For attributions, attributing mental disorders to a person’s own bad character predicted 
greater distance (p<.05) while attributing disorders to God’s will and life’s ups and downs 
independently predicted lower social distance (p<.05). Greater perceived potential violence 
toward others—but not toward self—significantly predicted greater social distance (p<.05).

4.  Discussion

Page 9

This study investigated the mental illness stigma context that exists within NHPI 
communities to gain insight as to why NHPIs bear heavy mental health burden but rarely 
seek treatment (SAMHSA, 2010; Ta et al., 2008). To provide a reference point for our 
findings, we compared the NHPI stigma context to the U.S. general public context.

Drawing from existing stigma and help-seeking literature, we proposed that a stigma context 
likely to limit NHPI help-seeking would show community NHPIs viewing major depression 
and schizophrenia as: (1) caused by sociomoral rather than neurobiological factors, (2) not 
serious, and (3) more likely to improve on its own and less likely to improve with treatment 
when compared to the U.S. public. Participants would also view persons with disorders as 
dangerous and desire social distance from them.

Confirming this restrictive help-seeking context, NHPI participants more frequently 
endorsed sociomoral attributions than neurobiological attributions. An overwhelming 73% 
and 86% of participants attributed major depression and schizophrenia, respectively, to 
either a person’s bad character or way they were raised—far exceeding the 54% and 51% 
respective sociomoral attribution rates for these disorders by the U.S. public.

Similarly, a significantly greater percentage of NHPI participants perceived major 
depression and schizophrenia as not serious problems vs. the general public. A greater 
percentage also believed the disorders would improve on its own while a smaller percentage 
believed the disorders would improve with treatment; a pattern previously associated with 
decreased help-seeking in racial/ethnic minority populations (Cauce et al., 2002). Notably, 
34% of NHPIs reported that schizophrenia would improve on its own compared to just 11% 
of the U.S. public. Conversely, only 82% of NHPIs reported schizophrenia would improve 
with treatment vs. 98% of the U.S. public.

A substantial proportion of NHPI participants also perceived persons with mental disorders 
as likely to be dangerous to others. Unsurprisingly given the strong connection between 
perceived dangerousness and desired social distance (Corrigan, 2000), participants also 
expressed a strong degree of unwillingness to interact with persons with mental disorders. 
Notably, community NHPIs demonstrated significantly stronger stigma (via desired social 
distance) than the U.S. public toward persons described as having major depression, 
suggesting NHPIs with major depression may be especially confronted by stigma in their 
communities compared to the general U.S. public.

When we examined which factors predicted participants’ desired social distance—to identify 
suitable targets for NHPI anti-stigma interventions—we noted that attributing mental 
disorders to a person’s bad character associated with greater desired social distance. 
Unfortunately, it is unclear whether traditional anti-stigma programs that have focused on 
reducing sociomoral attributions (e.g., bad character) by promoting neurobiological 
attributions (Corrigan et al., 2001; Hinshaw, 2006; Phelan et al., 2002; Pescosolido et al., 
2010; Shostak et al., 2008) would be beneficial for NHPI communities as neurobiological 
conceptions of mental illness have been found to be unrelated to changes in stigma attitudes 
(Pescosolido et al., 2010; Phelan et al., 2002). Instead, additional findings that attributing

mental disorders to God’s will or life’s ups and downs predicted lower social distance 
suggest that for NHPIs, it may be more beneficial (and culturally appropriate) to present 
mental disorders as a function of natural spiritual or life events occurring outside an NHPI 
individual’s scope of personal responsibility (to reduce blame). Our finding that greater 
depression and alcohol use levels predicted lower social distance is also informative as it 
suggests lived experience of depression and/or alcohol use may create greater understanding 
of, empathy for, and openness to interacting with, persons with mental illness among 
community-dwelling NHPIs. Accordingly, contact interventions (Corrigan et al., 2001; 
Rusch et al., 2005) that expose community NHPIs to personal stories and testimonials of 
NHPIs with mental illness may present a promising stigma reduction approach for NHPI 
communities.

4.1.  Limitations

As the first known study to assess mental illness stigma in NHPI community populations, 
this study has several limitations. First, our non-probability sampling method may hinder the 
generalizability of our findings, though this was mitigated by obtaining a balanced sample of 
NHPI participants from different age groups, genders, and social/community settings using a 
planned enrollment table. Second, while our stigma measurement tools were demonstrated 
to have strong validity with numerous international populations (Pescosolido et al., 2013) 
and were carefully adapted for use with NHPI populations, further research is needed to 
validate the NHPI-specific psychometric properties of these tools. Also, actual NHPI 
engagement in treatment was not assessed, which precluded us from examining whether 
NHPI stigma directly impacts NHPI mental health help-seeking. Lastly, this study did not 
examine systems-level factors such as lack of culturally responsive providers and services 
that we believe also limit NHPI help-seeking. Addressing these systems-level factors will 
likely require further developing culturally grounded programs for NHPIs such as the 
Ho’omau Ke Ola and Ho’ouna Pono substance use treatment and prevention programs for 
Native Hawaiians (Helm et al., 2013; Okamoto et al., 2018).

5.  Conclusions

The current study is the first to our knowledge to quantify mental illness stigma in NHPIs—
a potentially important barrier to mental health help-seeking in this underserved racial 
population. Confirming expectations, data revealed the presence of a stigmatizing context in 
NHPI community populations likely to restrict NHPI help-seeking. Relative to the U.S. 
public, NHPI participants were more likely to believe major depression and schizophrenia 
were caused by a person’s social or moral problems and less likely to perceive these 
disorders as serious issues. They were more likely to believe disorders would alleviate on 
their own and less likely to believe disorders would improve with treatment. Many also 
regarded NHPIs with mental disorders as potentially dangerous. In this stigmatizing context, 
NHPIs with mental illness may feel reluctant to seek help for fear of encountering 
stigmatization and painful stigma-related consequences such as discrimination and 
community exclusion (Lee et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2006).

Study findings illuminate possible solutions to alleviating this prohibitive context by 
suggesting anti-stigma interventions should be culturally tailored by: (1) placing community 
NHPIs in contact situations with other NHPIs with mental illness, and (2) promoting the 
conceptualization of mental illness as influenced by naturally occurring spiritual or life 
experiences—removing personal blame and accommodating NHPIs’ mind-body-spirit 
perspective on health (Mark & Lyons, 2010; Torsch & Ma, 2000). Accordingly, future 
researchers should engage NHPI community members in shaping these interventions to 
ensure the approaches developed for addressing NHPI community attitudes and beliefs that 
underlie NHPI stigma and limited treatment seeking are feasible, accepted, and culturally 
appropriate. Developing effective culturally tailored interventions to reduce NHPI 
community stigma may have significant public health benefits by increasing NHPI 
engagement in behavioral health services, thereby reducing levels of unmet need and heavy 
mental health burden in this underserved, hard-to-reach population.

Pacific Islanders bear heavy mental health burden but rarely seek treatment.

Stigma may play a critical role in driving low Pacific Islander help-seeking 
rates.

This study explored the stigma context present in Pacific Islander 
communities.

Pacific Islander participants reported elevated stigma vs. the U.S. general 
public.
