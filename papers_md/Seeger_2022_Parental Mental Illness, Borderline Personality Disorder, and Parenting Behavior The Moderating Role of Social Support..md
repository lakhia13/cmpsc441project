Abstract
Purpose of Review  Parental mental disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder (BPD), impair parenting behavior. 
Consequently, the children exhibit an elevated risk for psychopathology across their lifespan. Social support for parents is 
thought to moderate the relationship between parental mental illness and parenting behavior. It may dampen negative effects 
and serve as starting point for preventive interventions. This paper provides a literature overview regarding the impact of 
social support on the sequelae of parental mental illness and BPD for parenting behavior.
Recent Findings  Current literature highlights the increased burden of families with a mentally ill parent and associated 
changes in parenting behavior like increased hostility and affective dysregulation, especially in the context of parental BPD. 
Literature further demonstrates the powerful impact of social support in buffering such negative outcomes. The effect of 
social support seems to be moderated itself by further factors like socioeconomic status, gender, or characteristics of the 
social network.
Summary  Social support facilitates positive parenting in mentally ill parents and may be particularly important in parents 
with BPD. However, social support is embedded within a framework of influencing factors, which need consideration when 
interpreting scientific results.

Introduction

The quality of parenting behavior is frequently reported as 
the most influential environmental factor with regard to a 
child’s development [1, 2]. According to the widely refer-
enced and scientifically supported process model of parent-
ing by Belsky [3], parental personality and developmental 
history, social network, marital relations, work, and child 
characteristics jointly impact on parenting behavior. Taraban 
and Shaw [4•] recently updated the model by adding gen-
der, cognitions and affect, stress response, genetics, emotion 
regulation, family structure, and culture as further factors 
and clustering them into the three domains, namely parent 
characteristics, child characteristics, and family and social 
environment. Overall, the model considers parenting as a 
buffered system, in which a risk factor might be compen-
sated for by another positive or supportive influencing fac-
tor (i.e., resilience factor) across domains. Therefore, e.g., a 
challenging temperament of the child does not necessarily

lead to impaired parenting quality if it is counterbalanced, 
e.g., by a supportive relationship between the parents [3, 4•]. 
On the other hand, a predominance of risk factors as well 
as the absence of sufficient resilience factors is thought to 
facilitate harsh, neglectful, or even abusive parenting [3, 4•].
In line with the process model, a highly influential risk 
factor with respect to negative parenting behavior is parental 
psychopathology, particularly BPD [4•, 5–7]. They relate to 
almost every influencing factor proposed within the model: 
e.g., parental personality [7], parental developmental history 
[8], social relationships [9], work ability, and socioeconomic 
status [9], as well as cognition, affect, stress response, and 
emotion regulation [10]. More specifically, important cogni-
tive, emotional, or social prerequisites for positive parenting 
behavior such as attention, emotion regulation, or impulse 
control are often restricted in the presence of a personality 
disorder but also mental disorders in general [7, 11–13]. As 
a result, parents suffering from a mental disorder have been 
shown to exhibit greater difficulties in establishing authorita-
tive parenting (the careful equilibrium of parental warmth 
and regulatory control; [14]). In contrast, parental psycho-
pathology is thought to tip the balance towards permissive, 
rejecting-neglecting, or authoritarian parenting [14, 15]. Fur-
thermore, our work group demonstrated in a previous study 
(UBICA-I) that mothers with a history of depression and 
severe early life maltreatment (ELM) show reduced maternal 
sensitivity, i.e., a less accurate and timed responsiveness to 
and perception of the child’s signals [16], when interacting 
with their child [17]. As maternal sensitivity appears to be 
especially diminished when mothers had experienced ELM 
and additionally suffered from a mental disorder in contrast 
to mothers who had experienced ELM but did not develop 
a mental disorder, parental psychopathology seems to be of 
special relevance when it comes to negatively altered par-
enting behavior [18]. With respect to personality disorders, 
maternal BPD has been associated with increased hostility 
towards the child, which further mediated the relationship 
between maternal BPD and behavioral problems in the child 
[19]. Additionally, parents with personality disorders like 
BPD report difficulties in establishing empathetic respon-
siveness towards the child, managing the child’s behavior, 
and being a role model for emotional regulation [20, 21].

These negative effects of parental mental illness on par-
enting behavior have been demonstrated across a variety of 
parental diagnoses like depression [4•], bipolar disorder 
[22], anxiety disorders [23], substance-use disorders [24], 
personality disorders in general [7], and BPD in particular 
[25–27]. Regardless of the exact underlying psychopathol-
ogy, a reduced ability to correctly infer the child’s mental 
states such as emotions or psychological needs may addi-
tionally aggravate negative parenting behavior [6] and fur-
ther heighten the risk for neglect, maltreatment, and abuse 
[28, 29].

For the child, the changes in parenting behavior might 
confer, e.g., to an increase in externalizing and internal-
izing problems [30–32], the development of insecure or 
disorganized attachment [33], depressive mood [32, 34], or  
dysfunctional social behavior [35], which in turn promote 
the risk for child psychopathology (for reviews, see [36, 37]  
and  [38]).  Changes  in  child  functioning  may  in  turn 
lead  to  parenting  stress  and  altered  parenting  behavior 
due  to  transactional  relations  between  child  and  parent 
variables  [39].  In  BPD,  the  formation  of  a  healthy  par-
ent–child  relationship  as  well  as  offspring  emotional 
development have been shown to be impaired [33]. This 
results in a heightened risk for the children to develop a  
BPD themselves [33].

Taken together, parental mental illness, e.g., parental 
personality disorders such as BPD and the related changes 
in parenting behavior constitute an important factor in the 
intergenerational continuity of mental disorders besides 
genetic heritability of the individual diagnostic entities [36, 
40]. Thirty-eight percent of physicians in German psychiat-
ric hospitals report their patients to exhibit deficits in parent-
ing behavior and roughly every second physician considers 
children’s mental health at risk due to those deficits [41]. As 
approximately three million German children live in families 
with at least one mentally ill parent, there is a high number 
of parents who may require additional support in dealing 
with their parental role [42].

This review aims to give an overview of the current litera-
ture on the sequelae of parental mental illness, specifically 
parental BPD, for parenting behavior as well as the moderat-
ing role of social support regarding this influence.

Literature search has been conducted between May 2021 
and December 2021 via PubMed and Google Scholar. The 
following search terms were entered separately or in con-
junction (respective manuscript section in parentheses): 
parental mental illness (1,2,4), parental mental disorder 
(1,2,4), personality disorder (1,2), borderline personality dis-
order (1,2), affective disorders (1,2), parenting (1,2,3,4), par-
enting behavior (1,2,3,4), social support (2,3,4), pandemic 
(3), SARS-CoV-2 (3), COVID-19 (3), preventive interven-
tion (4), parenting intervention (4), parenting program (4). 
The literature was subsequently selected according to the 
year of publication (2000–2021).

Social Support as a Moderator Between 
Parental Mental Illness, Parental BPD, 
and Parenting Behavior

In line with the process model [3], the accumulated stress of 
coping with a mental disorder and caring for a child simul-
taneously  may  impede  symptom  amelioration  and  posi-
tive parenting behavior [43, 44]. In turn, factors reducing

parental stress have been observed to decrease severity of 
parental psychopathology as well as to promote positive par-
enting behavior [45•]. Social support may serve as such a 
factor of resilience [4•].

Moak and Agrawal [46] broadly defined social support 
as a psychosocial resource accessible in the context of the 
individual’s social network and interpersonal contacts. With 
respect to parenting, one may differentiate emotional, infor-
mational, and instrumental social support [47]. Emotional 
support mainly affects parenting behaviors indirectly via its 
effect on parental well-being, e.g., through the reduction of 
parental stress [45•, 48], the provision of a sense of social 
integration, or the aid in emotion regulation. Instead, infor-
mational and instrumental support also directly impacts on 
parenting behaviors, e.g., by promoting problem solving 
skills, providing advice or concrete aid in the accomplish-
ment of everyday family requirements [49, 50]. Social sup-
port may therefore reduce the risk for child maltreatment via 
a decrease in parental stress and symptom severity as well 
as an increase in positive parenting behavior [45•, 51]. Fur-
thermore, social support may reduce the negative effect of 
parental mental illness on child well-being [52] and promote 
service use in at-risk caregivers [53]. The results of Álvarez 
et al. [45•] further suggest a differential impact of social sup-
port obtained by professionals and institutions (formal sup-
port, [54]) and social support delivered by family members 
or friends (informal support): whereas informal support was 
more effective in changing child-rearing attitudes, formal 
support predicted a reduction in parental stress.

Research  further  highlights  beneficial  effects  across 
different diagnoses, while the majority of studies focuses 
on parental depression: social support is associated with 
reduced  parenting  stress  and  lower  levels  of  depression 
among parents [55, 56]. This effect has been demonstrated 
even before [57•] as well as shortly after child birth [58], 
thus  serving  as  a  protective  factor  against  postpartum 
depression and bonding failure [57•]. Social support also 
seems to attenuate negative effects of parental depression 
on confidence in own parenting skills [59]. Within a lon-
gitudinal study spanning three generations, Abraham et al. 
[60••] found parental major depression to be a key fac-
tor accounting for the transmission of negative parenting 
behavior towards the next generation. This was mainly due 
to a parenting behavior characterized by reduced parental 
care to be transmitted to the children. However, individuals 
within the second generation did not carry on this behavior 
themselves if social support was present. Thus, social sup-
port aided in breaking the intergenerational cycle of negative 
parenting and parental depression.

Similar positive effects were described for patients with 
BPD, who often lack social support [21, 61]. Accordingly, 
social support has been demonstrated to moderate the influ-
ence of severity of several BPD symptoms like affective 

instability or identity problems on mothers’ emotional avail-
ability and thus a key feature of positive parenting [62].

However, there are also studies questioning that social sup-
port can be consistently regarded as having positive effects 
on parenting. For example, in BPD, the beneficial effect of 
social support on parental emotional availability was shown to 
mitigate with increasing BPD severity in parents [62]. Taraban 
et al. [63•] found the negative effect of maternal depression on 
parenting quality to be strongest in mothers reporting high lev-
els of social support. Similarly, a recent study by Lee et al. [64] 
reported young mothers suffering from depression to be less 
able to benefit from social support. The authors of these studies 
speculated their findings might be due to depressed mothers 
with high social support delegating their parental responsi-
bilities more often to their social network, which may prevent 
them from learning to keep high parenting quality in case of 
depressed mood [63•]. Alternatively, social support might 
provoke feelings of inadequacy due to prevalent cognitive 
biases in depressed mothers [64]. The findings were further 
supported by Taraban et al. [65•], who found the association 
between maternal depression and overreactive parenting to be 
unaffected by own satisfaction with social support. In contrast, 
the higher the partner’s satisfaction with social support was, 
the weaker the association between each parent’s depressive 
symptoms and overreactive parenting behavior. This finding 
further highlights a potential inability to take advantage of 
social support if parental depression is present. In substance-
use disorders, increased parental social support has even been 
associated with more frequent physical abuse of the children 
by their parents [66].

However, social support does not only moderate the influence 
of parental mental illness on parenting behavior, but its effect 
is moderated itself by further influencing factors: in a study by 
Ceballo and McLoyd [67], the positive effects of social support 
on parenting behavior were attenuated with decreasing socio-
economic status in the environment of the participating mothers. 
Furthermore, there seem to be gender differences: Leinonen et al. 
[68] reported single fathers to be unable to benefit from emo-
tional support by friends or relatives with respect to parenting 
behavior when facing economic strain. In contrast, single moth-
ers were able to benefit from various sources of social support.
These findings emphasize the high complexity of influ-
ences with respect to parenting and social support as pro-
posed by the process model of Belsky [3]. Additionally, 
the findings shed light on the methodological problem of 
a lacking consistent conceptualization of social support 
within science [69]. This leads to findings that seem to be 
contradictory at first, but emerge from different aspects or 
types of social support that have been studied (e.g., formal 
vs. informal support; support by relatives vs. support by 
friends). Therefore, there is a high need for a precise and 
generally acknowledged concept of social support in future 
studies [69].

In summary, the majority of literature (for an overview 
see Table 1) points to substantial positive effects of social 
support on parenting behavior in the context of parental 
mental illness and across diagnostic categories. Unfortu-
nately, we had to realize that research on social support par-
ticularly for parents with BPD is scarce, although parenting 
is severely affected in parents with BPD. Overall, social sup-
port may directly promote changes in parenting behavior or 
facilitate positive parenting via its effect on parental abilities 
and symptom severity (see Fig. 1). Therefore, it effectively 
hinders parental psychopathology from being forwarded 
to the child. However, the effects of social support may be 
moderated themselves by further (environmental) factors 
like socioeconomic status, characteristics of the social net-
work, gender, or severity of symptomatology.

The SARS‑CoV‑2 Pandemic and Its Influences 
on Social Support and Parenting

Since SARS-CoV-2 has emerged in the end of 2019, the 
following pandemic and the related public health restric-
tions have fundamentally impacted on every individual’s 
social networks. Especially, regulations demanding social 
distancing have reduced possibilities for social support, thus 
withdrawing an important resource for families, especially 
those with at least one mentally ill parent. Studies point to 
long-lasting detrimental effects of the pandemic and related 
restrictions on mental health [72].

The loss of social support seems to be the crucial element 
in the exacerbated mental health burden of parents during 
the pandemic [73]. Correspondingly, there is already some 
evidence that the more social support was present, the less 
psychopathology increased during COVID-related lock-
downs [74–76]. Social support may therefore constitute a 
starting point for interventions aiming at reducing the nega-
tive mental health impacts of the pandemic like a generally 
heightened level of psychological distress [76].

In line with the process model, this aggravation of paren-
tal symptomatology has facilitated negative parenting behav-
iors [77–79]. Accordingly, Sari et al. [80] reported height-
ened levels of harsh parenting during the pandemic and 
several studies have shown child mental health to decrease 
due in part to negatively altered parenting behaviors [81–84]. 
During COVID-19, parental depression has been determined 
to be a risk factor of negative parenting behaviors [85] which 
further aggravates in parents with a history of childhood 
maltreatment and a lack of compensatory resources such as 
social support [86].

As a result, Perks and Cluver [87] call for a “parenting 
vaccine” encompassing professional and scientifically evalu-
ated parenting programs to buffer the negative effects of the 
pandemic on parental mental health, parenting behavior, and 

child well-being. Such programs might not only be benefi-
cial for the individual who is participating, but may further 
aid in preventing negative and long-lasting socioeconomic 
and societal effects. The positive effects of parenting pro-
grams are further highlighted when considering the social 
support they implicate: if the interventions comprise formal 
support, e.g., via the teaching of parenting skills as well as 
informal support, e.g., by peer-to-peer exchange, their effects 
might be strengthened.

Preventive Interventions Targeting 
Parenting Behavior

Parenting interventions enable the dissemination of posi-
tive parenting skills and thus allow for a direct impact on 
parenting behaviors of mentally ill parents [88••]. Besides, 
they may constitute an important source of social support 
for mentally ill parents. On the one hand, such interventions 
may provide formal social support via their association to 
specialized institutions and health care professionals. On 
the other hand, group programs may enable the exchange 
of experiences among parents and thus provide a valuable 
source of informal social support (see, e.g., [89]).

While the sole treatment of parental psychopathology has 
been shown to improve parenting behavior and child mental 
health, those interventions have only reached medium effect 
sizes (see, e.g., [90]). Directly targeting parenting behavior 
may be more effective due to its role as a mediator between 
parental and child mental health. Accordingly, numerous 
parenting programs aiming at improving parenting behavior 
have been developed in order to break the intergenerational 
continuity of mental disorders. Meta-analyses on such par-
enting programs have shown these interventions to effec-
tively improve parenting behavior and child outcomes (see, 
e.g., [91–93]). Moreover, parenting programs also seem to 
prevent child maltreatment [94].

Recently, a meta-analysis by Everett et al. [88••] again 
highlighted that interventions targeting parenting behavior of 
mentally ill parents are successful in promoting positive par-
enting, but are especially effective in reducing child psychopa-
thology. Furthermore, an improvement of parenting behavior 
diminished severity of parental psychopathology. The latter 
is thought to result from an improvement of parent–child 
interactions which account for reduced parental stress and 
thus facilitate symptom amelioration. The authors concluded 
that prevention programs not only need to address parenting 
behavior but also parental as well as child symptomatology to 
reach maximum efficacy [88••]. However, the exact pathways 
leading to the observed outcomes often remain unclear [95] 
and there is evidence that the efficacy of the programs varies 
significantly [96].

Fig. 1   Exemplary model on the moderating role of social support on parenting behavior in mentally ill parents. The model illustrates a hypoth-
esized pathway for the intergenerational continuity of mental disorders and potential starting points for the effects of social support

This variation might depend on the exact content of the 
parenting interventions: with respect to specific interventions, 
parental mentalization capabilities have been proposed to be a 
relevant prerequisite for positive parent–child interactions and 
positive parenting behavior [97]. Mentalization is defined as 
the ability to infer mental states within oneself and others [98]. 
Furthermore, maternal sensitivity has been demonstrated to be 
a promising starting point for parenting interventions [99].

Irrespective  of  the  exact  content  of  the  intervention 
Marston et al. [100] found psychoeducation, peer-to-peer 
exchange  of  own  experiences  (an  important  source  of 
informal social support), and skills for positive interac-
tions within the family to be the three crucial elements of 
parenting interventions. Within this context, social support 
and peer-to-peer exchange may be also provided via online 
interventions [89], which gains special relevance during 
the pandemic. Furthermore, the use of video feedback may 
facilitate the observation of the child’s as well as one’s own 
behavior and thus provides a vital element to enhance pre-
ventive parenting programs [101]. Even though most preven-
tive programs comprise psychoeducation elements, only few 
additionally provide opportunities for peer-to-peer exchange, 
specific interventions targeting parent–child interactions, 
and the use of video feedback.

A  program  that  combines  the  three  elements  recom-
mended by Marston et al. [100], incorporates video feedback, 
and thereby focuses on parental mentalization capabilities 
is the lighthouse parenting program [28] which is currently 
conducted and investigated in a study of our work group 
that  aims  to  understand  and  break  the  intergenerational 
cycle of abuse (UBICA) in mentally ill parents [102]. The 

group program specifically focuses on social support via 
peer-to-peer exchange (informal social support) and further 
incorporates social counseling (formal social support). We 
test for superiority of this prevention program against pure 
psychoeducation and aim to identify potential mechanisms 
of change mediating the effects of the mentalization-based 
intervention on parenting behavior (for details see [102]).

Conclusion

Parental mental illness and parental BPD influence parenting 
behavior in many ways with serious consequences for the 
offspring. The association between parental mental illness 
and problematic parenting behavior seems to be moderated 
by social support. Via its positive effect on parenting behav-
ior, social support may also effectively aid in buffering or 
even preventing negative consequences for the children of 
mentally ill parents, and thus supports the discontinuation 
of mental illnesses and child maltreatment across genera-
tions. However, social support is embedded within a com-
plex framework of influences on parenting behavior such 
as socioeconomic status, gender, or characteristics of the 
social network, that in turn moderate the effect of social sup-
port. Adding the lack of a generally acknowledged scientific 
conceptualization of social support, this leads to difficulties 
in comparing and interpreting research on social support in 
mentally ill parents. Future research should specify the type 
of social support that was investigated and consider poten-
tially confounding factors, which may have moderated the 
influence of social support on their part.

Current Psychiatry Reports (2022) 24:591–601

In addition, specific research is needed to study the mod-
erating role of social support within parents with BPD who 
seem to face aggravated problems in the context of parenting 
due to characteristics of their symptomatology. Especially, the 
increased hostility which is reported within the literature sug-
gests a heightened need for (formal) support in those parents to 
improve emotion regulation and reduce negative effects on the 
children. This hypothesis crucially needs scientific evaluation.
Importantly, the majority of literature points to substan-
tial positive effects of social support for families with a men-
tally ill parent. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has isolated 
many families from social support, the need for structured 
and evidence-based parenting interventions has substan-
tially increased. Optimally, such programs should comprise 
a combination of informal and formal support and should be 
broadly applied within standard clinical care of mentally ill 
parents to buffer long-term negative effects of the pandemic 
on parent and child mental health.
