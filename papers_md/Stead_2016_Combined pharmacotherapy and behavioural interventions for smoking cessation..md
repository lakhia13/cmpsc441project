Background

A B S T R A C T

Both behavioural support (including brief advice and counselling) and pharmacotherapies (including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT),
varenicline and bupropion) are effective in helping people to stop smoking. Combining both treatment approaches is recommended where
possible, but the size of the treatment effect with different combinations and in different settings and populations is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of combining behavioural support and medication to aid smoking cessation, compared to a minimal intervention
or  usual  care,  and  to  identify  whether  there  are  different  effects  depending  on  characteristics  of  the  treatment  setting,  intervention,
population treated, or take-up of treatment.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in July 2015 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy,
including any type of NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline.

Selection criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating combinations of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support for smoking
cessation, compared to a control receiving usual care or brief advice or less intensive behavioural support. We excluded trials recruiting
only pregnant women, trials recruiting only adolescents, and trials with less than six months follow-up.

Data collection and analysis

Search results were prescreened by one author and inclusion or exclusion of potentially relevant trials was agreed by two authors. Data
was extracted by one author and checked by another.

The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of
abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)
for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main results

Fifty-three studies with a total of more than 25,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. A large proportion of studies recruited people
in healthcare settings or with specific health needs. Most studies provided NRT. Behavioural support was typically provided by specialists

in cessation counselling, who offered between four and eight contact sessions. The planned maximum duration of contact was typically
more than 30 minutes but less than 300 minutes. Overall, studies were at low or unclear risk of bias, and findings were not sensitive to the
exclusion of any of the six studies rated at high risk of bias in one domain. One large study (the Lung Health Study) contributed heterogeneity
due to a substantially larger treatment effect than seen in other studies (RR 3.88, 95% CI 3.35 to 4.50). Since this study used a particularly
intensive intervention which included extended availability of nicotine gum, multiple group sessions and long term maintenance and
recycling contacts, the results may not be comparable with the interventions used in other studies, and hence it was not pooled in other
analyses. Based on the remaining 52 studies (19,488 participants) there was high quality evidence (using GRADE) for a benefit of combined
pharmacotherapy and behavioural treatment compared to usual care, brief advice or less intensive behavioural support (RR 1.83, 95% CI
1.68 to 1.98) with moderate statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 36%).

The pooled estimate for 43 trials that recruited participants in healthcare settings (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.18) was higher than for eight
trials with community-based recruitment (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.76). Compared to the first version of the review, previous weak evidence
of differences in other subgroup analyses has disappeared. We did not detect differences between subgroups defined by motivation to
quit, treatment provider, number or duration of support sessions, or take-up of treatment.

Authors' conclusions

Interventions  that  combine  pharmacotherapy  and  behavioural  support  increase  smoking  cessation  success  compared  to  a  minimal
intervention or usual care. Updating this review with an additional 12 studies (5,000 participants) did not materially change the effect
estimate. Although trials differed in the details of their populations and interventions, we did not detect any factors that modified treatment
effects apart from the recruitment setting. We did not find evidence from indirect comparisons that offering more intensive behavioural
support was associated with larger treatment effects.

P L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y

Does a combination of stop smoking medication and behavioural support help smokers to stop?

Background

Behavioural support (such as brief advice and counselling) and medications (including varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement
therapies like patches or gum) help people quit smoking. Many guidelines recommend combining medication and behavioural support to
help people stop smoking, but it is unclear if some combinations are more effective than others, or if the combination of medication and
behavioural support works better in some settings or groups than in others.

Study Characteristics

In July 2015 we searched for studies which tested combinations of behavioural support and medication to help smokers to stop compared
to usual care or brief behavioural support. People who smoked were recruited mainly in health care settings. Some trials only enrolled
people who said they wanted to try to quit at that time, but some included people who weren't planning to quit. Studies had to report
how many people had stopped smoking after at least six months.

Results

We found 53 studies with a total of over 25,000 participants. One very large study found a large benefit. It gave intensive support including
nicotine gum, multiple group sessions, and long term contact to help people stay quit or encourage additional quit attempts. Because it
was not typical of most treatment programmes, it was not included when we estimated the likely benefit, although it shows that such
intensive support can be very effective. Based on the remaining 52 studies, we found high quality evidence that using a combination of
behavioural support and medication increases the chances of successfully quitting after at least six months. Combining the results suggests
that the chance of success is increased by 70 to 100 percent compared to just brief advice or support. There was some evidence that the
effect tended to be larger when participants were recruited in healthcare settings. There was no clear evidence that providing more contact
increased the number of people who quit smoking at six months or longer. .

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is
based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: Confidence interval; RR: Risk ratio

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.

1 Baseline risk calculated as mean control group risk for both comparisons
2 Some evidence of asymmetry in a funnel plot; excess of small trials detecting larger effects. However, in a sensitivity analysis, removing smaller studies did not markedly
decrease the pooled estimate.
3 Downgraded due to indirectness. As this study had a particularly intensive intervention, the results may not be generalisable to real world treatment programmes.

B A C K G R O U N D

Giving up smoking is the most effective way for people who smoke
to  reduce  their  risk  of  smoking  related  disease  and  premature
death.  Behavioural  support  and  pharmacotherapies  help  people
to  stop  smoking.  Behavioural  support  interventions  include
written  materials  containing  advice  on  quitting,  multisession
group  therapy  programmes  or  individual  counselling  sessions  in
person  or  by  telephone.  Providing  standard  self-help  materials
alone  seems  to  have  a  small  effect  on  success,  but  there  is
evidence of a benefit of individually tailored self-help materials or
more intensive advice or counselling (Lancaster 2005; Hartmann-
Boyce  2014).  Nicotine  replacement  therapy  (NRT),  varenicline,
bupropion,  cytisine  and  nortriptyline  all  increase  the  long-term
success  of  quit  attempts  (Cahill  2013).  Many  clinical  practice
guidelines recommend that healthcare providers offer people who
are prepared to make a quit attempt both classes of intervention
on the basis that they may have an additive or even multiplicative
effect. This approach assumes that the two types of treatment have
complementary modes of action, and may independently improve
the  chances  of  maintaining  long-term  abstinence.  However,  it  is
recognised that many people who use pharmacotherapy will not
take  up  the  offer  of  intensive  behavioural  support.  NRT  products
are  available  over  the  counter  (OTC)  without  a  prescription  in
many  countries,  and  people  who  purchase  them  may  not  access
any specific behavioural support. People who obtain prescriptions
for  pharmacotherapies  are  more  likely  to  receive  some  support,
but  this  may  be  focused  on  explaining  proper  use  of  the  drug
rather  than  on  behavioural  counselling.  Surveys  suggest  that
the  proportion  of  people  who  use  both  types  of  treatment
when  attempting  to  stop  smoking  is  low  (Shiffman  2008;  Kotz
2009b).  The  aim  of  this  review  is  to  assess  the  the  effect  of
the  combined  intervention  of  pharmacotherapy  and  behavioural
support, compared to using neither type of treatment, or receiving
only brief advice or behavioural support.

Other  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  reviews  have  evaluated  the
separate effects of behavioural and pharmaceutical interventions.
In order to quantify these individual effects, these reviews restrict
inclusion  to  trials  where  the  intervention  under  investigation
is  unconfounded.  By  unconfounded,  we  mean  that  trials
of  pharmacotherapies  had  to  provide  the  same  amount  of
behavioural support (materials, advice, counselling contacts) to all
participants  whether  they  receive  active  treatment  or  a  placebo
or  no  medication.  Likewise,  when  behavioural  interventions  are
evaluated  there  must  be  no  systematic  difference  in  the  offer  of
medications between the active and control arms of the trial.

The  findings  from  reviews  of  unconfounded  trials  support  the
use  of  combined  pharmacological  and  behavioural  therapy,  but
do  not  provide  a  direct  estimate  of  the  size  of  the  benefit  to  be
expected from combining the two types of treatment. The aim of
this  review  is  to  synthesize  the  evidence  from  trials  that  directly
evaluate  the  use  of  an  intervention  combining  pharmacotherapy
and  behavioural  support,  where  the  control  condition  includes
neither  pharmacotherapy  nor  the  same  intensity  of  behavioural
support.  The  control  will  involve  either  usual  care,  or  brief
advice.  If  the  pharmacotherapy  and  the  behavioural  support
components  exert  independent  effects  on  successful  cessation,
these trials might be expected to give considerably larger treatment
effects  than  would  be  achieved  from  either  the  behavioural  or
the  medication  component  alone.  However,  other  factors  may

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

affect  the  size  of  this  effect.  In  particular,  pragmatic  trials  of
interventions in healthcare settings may find smaller effects than
placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy studies in research settings,
as  delivery  of  the  intervention  components  may  be  lower.  To
address  this,  we  set  out  to  identify  moderators  that  might  lead
to  heterogeneity  in  effects  of  combined  treatment,  including  the
motivation of participants, the nature of the treatment setting, and
the type of therapist. We also aimed to categorize by the intensity
of behavioural support, based on number and duration of contacts,
in  order  to  evaluate  whether  the  intensity  of  the  behavioural
support affected treatment success. Previous meta-analyses have
suggested  that  there  is  a  dose  response,  with  more  contacts
improving outcomes amongst people receiving pharmacotherapy
(Fiore  2008  table  6.23).  We  also  considered  the  degree  to  which
participants used both medication and behavioural components as
a possible explanation for any heterogeneity.

For this review we identified trials of interventions that combined
(including  NRT,  varenicline,  bupropion,
pharmacotherapies 
cytisine,  or  nortriptyline)  with  behavioural  support  (tailored
materials,  brief  advice,  in  person  or  telephone  counselling)  and
that  compared  outcomes  against  a  control  group  that  received
either  usual  care  or  a  brief  cessation  component  (i.e.  advice  to
quit  but  no  other  behavioural  support  or  medication  common
to  the  intervention).  A  companion  review  will  evaluate  whether
more intensive behavioural support improves cessation outcomes
for  people  using  pharmacotherapy,  using  the  direct  evidence
from  trials  that  compare  different  levels  of  behavioural  support
for  people  receiving  any  type  of  pharmacotherapy  for  smoking
cessation (Stead 2015).

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomized  or  quasi-randomized  controlled  trials.  We  did  not
exclude  studies  on  the  basis  of  publication  status  or  language  of
publication.

Types of participants

We included trials that recruited people who smoke in any setting,
with the exception of trials which only recruit pregnant women or
adolescents. These populations are considered in specific reviews.
Trial  participants  did  not  need  to  be  selected  according  to  their
interest in quitting or their suitability for pharmacotherapy.

Types of interventions

We  included  interventions  for  increasing  smoking  cessation
that 
included  behavioural  support  and  the  availability  of
pharmacotherapy,  regardless  of  type  of  pharmacotherapy.  We
excluded trials where fewer than 20% of participants were eligible
for or used pharmacotherapy. The provision of written information
or  brief  instructions  on  correct  use  of  the  pharmacotherapy  was

not regarded as behavioural support.  The control group should not
have been systematically offered pharmacotherapy but we did not
exclude  studies  where  some  control  group  participants  obtained
medication from other sources. Control group participants could be
offered usual care, self-help materials or brief advice on quitting,
but support had to have been of a lower intensity than that given
to intervention participants.

Types of outcome measures

Following  the  standard  methodology  of  the  Cochrane  Tobacco
Addiction  Group,  the  primary  outcome  is  smoking  cessation  at
the  longest  follow-up  using  the  strictest  definition  of  abstinence,
that is, preferring sustained over point prevalence abstinence and
using biochemically validated rates where available. We also noted
any other abstinence outcomes reported and conducted sensitivity
analyses  to  test  if  the  choice  of  outcome  affected  the  results  of
meta-analysis.  We  excluded  trials  reporting  less  than  six  months
follow-up from the start of intervention.

Search methods for identification of studies

We 
identified  trials  from  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction
Specialised Register (the Register). This is generated from regular
searches  of  the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for trials of smoking
cessation  or  prevention  interventions.  The  most  recent  search  of
the Register was in July 2015. At the time of the search the Register
included the results of searches of the CENTRAL to issue 4, 2015;
MEDLINE  (via  OVID)  from  1946  to  update  20150501;  EMBASE  (via
OVID) from 1974 to week 201519 and PsycINFO (via OVID) from 1967
to update 20150506. See the Tobacco Addiction Group Module in
the  Cochrane  Library  for  full  search  strategies  and  a  list  of  other
resources searched.

We  searched  the  Register  for  records  with  any  mention  of
pharmacotherapy in title, abstract or indexing terms (see Appendix
1 for the final search strategy). We checked titles and abstracts to
identify trials of interventions for smoking cessation that combined
pharmacotherapy  with  behavioural  support.  We  also  checked
the  excluded  study  lists  of  reviews  of  behavioural  therapies  and
pharmacotherapy  for  trials  excluded  because  pharmacotherapy
was  confounded  with  additional  behavioural  support  compared
to  the  control  group.  Trials  with  a  factorial  design  that  varied
both  pharmacotherapy  and  behavioural  conditions  were  also
considered  for  inclusion.  We  also  tested  an  additional  MEDLINE
search  using  the  smoking  related  terms  and  design  limits  used
in  the  standard  register  search  and  the  MeSH  terms  ‘combined
modality therapy’ or (Drug Therapy and (exp Behavior therapy or
exp Counseling)). This search retrieved a subset of records already
screened for the inclusion in the Register and was used to assess
whether  it  might  retrieve  studies  where  there  was  no  mention
of  a  specific  cessation  pharmacotherapy  in  the  title,  abstract  or
indexing. We did not find any additional studies from this.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

LS  identified  potentially  relevant  trial  reports  according  to  the
criteria above. Areas of uncertainty were discussed with PK and TL.
LS and either TL or PK extracted data.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Data extraction and management

We extracted the following information from trial reports:

• Country and setting of trial
• Method of recruitment, including any selection by motivation to

quit

• Method of sequence generation
• Method of allocation concealment
• Characteristics  of  participants  including  gender,  age,  smoking

rate

• Characteristics of intervention deliverer
• Intervention  components: 

type,  dose  and  duration  of

pharmacotherapy, type and duration of behavioural support

• Control group components
• Outcomes: primary outcome length of follow-up and definition
of abstinence; other follow-ups and abstinence definitions; use
of biochemical validation; loss to follow-up.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Studies  were  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  the  randomization
procedure and allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data
assessment  and  any  other  bias  (Schulz  2002a;  Schulz  2002b;
Higgins 2011). Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot.

Measures of treatment effect

Trial  effects  were  expressed  as  a  relative  risk  (RR):  (quitters  in
treatment group/total randomized to treatment group)/ (quitters in
control group/total randomized to control group).

Dealing with missing data

Numbers lost to follow-up were reported by group where available.
Following standard Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group methods,
people  lost  to  follow-up  were  assumed  to  be  smoking  and
included  in  the  denominators  for  calculating  the  RR.  Any  deaths
during  follow-up  were  reported  separately  and  excluded  from
denominators.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We  considered  pooling  all  trials  comparing  combined  therapy
to  usual  care/minimal  intervention  control  if  heterogeneity  as
assessed by the I2 statistic (Higgins 2003) was less than 50%.

Data synthesis

For groups of trials where meta-analysis was judged appropriate,
relative  risks  were  pooled  using  a  Mantel-Haenszel  fixed-effect
model,  and  a  pooled  estimate  with  95%  confidence  intervals
reported.

If  trials  had  more  than  one  intervention  condition  we  compared
the  most  intensive  combination  of  behavioural  support  and
pharmacotherapy to the control in the main analysis.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We undertook planned subgroup analyses by setting, participant
selection, intervention provider, number of sessions, total duration
of  contact,  and  take-up  of  treatment.  The  subgroups  are  listed
below.

Intensity

We conducted alternative analyses of intensity adapted from two
of the categories used in the US Guidelines (Fiore 2008). We used
planned contact time and number of sessions where possible. If this
was variable or unclear we used any report of actual delivery.

We  categorised  total  amount  of  contact  time  as  zero  (if  the  only
support was sent by mail), 1 to 30 minutes (collapsing one to three
and 4 to 30 US guideline categories), 31 to 90, 91 to 300, and over
300 minutes.

Number of person-to-person sessions was categorised as zero, one
to  three  (instead  of  zero  to  one  and  two  to  three  as  used  in  US
guidelines), four to eight and over eight sessions.

Treatment take-up (compliance with medication and
behavioural support)

We expected this group of trials to include some pragmatic studies
where  participants  are  offered  treatment  but  did  not  use  all  the
components offered. After pilot testing, we categorised studies into
three groups:

• High – over 70% starting pharmacotherapy and receiving at least

one session of support (where applicable)

• Moderate – Over 30% starting pharmacotherapy and over 50%

receiving at least one session of support

• Low – less than 30% starting pharmacotherapy or less than 50%

receive at least one session of support

We  did  not  separate  trials  using  different  pharmacotherapies  in
initial analyses but we considered the type of pharmacotherapy as
an explanation for remaining heterogeneity.

Where  there  was  evidence  from  subgroup  analyses  of  clinically
relevant  differences  between  categories  in  any  of  the  subgroups
above,  we  used  meta  regression  (Stata)  to  explore  whether  any
of the characteristics were effect modifiers, including each of the
characteristics as categorical (dummy) variables. To assess possible
effect  modification  according  to  the  intensity  of  intervention
received, we also included number of sessions, amount of contact
time  and  take-up  together  in  a  single  meta-regression  analysis.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Since  these  analyses  were  not  pre-specified  they  are  hypothesis
generating only.

Sensitivity analysis

We  considered  the  sensitivity  of  the  results  to  changes  in  the
cut-off  range  for  categories  outlined  above.  If  data  for  multiple
outcomes were provided, we conducted sensitivity analyses to test
if  the  choice  of  outcome  affected  the  results.  We  also  conducted
sensitivity  analyses  removing  smaller  studies  to  assess  possible
impact of publication bias.

Description of studies

Results of the search

The original register search retrieved approximately 2200 records,
approximately  400  additional  records  were  screened  for  this
update. Most of the records that did report trials of interventions for
smoking cessation were not relevant because they were placebo-
controlled  trials  of  pharmacotherapies,  in  which  the  behavioural
support  was  the  same  for  intervention  and  control  conditions.
We identified 41 studies for inclusion in the original review and a
further  12  for  the  update.  Many  included  studies  were  identified
via more than one study report. All reports related to a study are
listed in the reference section with the primary report used for data
extraction  identified.  Trials  are  identified  by  the  first  author  and
year of publication of the main study report. A further 90 studies are
listed as excluded.

Included studies

We identified 53 studies that met all inclusion criteria with a total
of more than 25,000 participants. Most have been published since
2000,  with  the  earliest  published  in  1988.  One  trial  had  almost
6000  participants  (Lung  Health  Study)  and  one  over  2000  (Hollis
2007).  Thirty-one  trials  had  more  than  100  participants  in  the
intervention arm and most of the remainder had more than 50 in
the intervention arm. Twelve trials are new for this update (Murray
2013; Prochaska 2014; Rigotti 2014; Stockings 2014; Winhusen 2014;
Bernstein 2015; Haas 2015; Hickman 2015; Lee 2015; Peckham 2015;
Perez-Tortosa 2015)

About  half  the  studies  were  conducted  in  the  USA.  Of  the  others
there were five from Canada (Wilson 1988; Reid 2003; Ratner 2004;
Chouinard 2005; Lee 2015), four from Australia (Vial 2002; Wakefield
2004; Baker 2006; Stockings 2014), three from Denmark (Tonnesen
2006;  Villebro  2008;  Thomsen  2010),  three  from  Spain  (Juarranz
Sanz 1998; Rodriguez 2003; Perez-Tortosa 2015), four from the UK
(Molyneux 2003; Binnie 2007; Murray 2013; Peckham 2015) and one
each from Brazil (Otero 2006), Italy (Segnan 1991), the Netherlands
(Kotz 2009), Sweden (Sadr Azodi 2009), Japan (Hanioka 2010) and
Hong Kong (Chan 2010).

Trial setting and recruitment

A high proportion of trials were conducted in healthcare settings
and/or recruited people with specific health needs. These included

ten  trials  in  general  (non  psychiatric)  hospital  inpatients  (Simon
1997; Lewis 1998; Vial 2002; Molyneux 2003; Reid 2003; Chouinard
2005;  Mohiuddin  2007;  Brandstein  2011;  Murray  2013;  Rigotti
2014),  one  in  emergency  room  patients  (Bernstein  2015),  five  in
patients awaiting admission for surgery (Ratner 2004; Villebro 2008;
Sadr  Azodi  2009;  Thomsen  2010;  Lee  2015),  three  in  psychiatric
hospital  inpatients  (Stockings  2014;  Prochaska  2014;  Hickman
2015), three for other mental health patients (Baker 2006; Hall 2006;
Peckham  2015),  four  in  outpatient  substance  abuse  treatment
programmes  (Cooney  2007;  Reid  2008;  Carmody  2012;  Winhusen
2014),  one  in  an  AIDS  clinic  (Wewers  2000),  two  for  people  with
cancer (Wakefield 2004; Duffy 2006), and one for cancer survivors
(Emmons  2005).  Eight  trials  recruited  patients  of  primary  care
clinics  (Wilson  1988;  Ockene  1991;  Segnan  1991;  Juarranz  Sanz
1998;  Katz  2004;  Perez-Tortosa  2015  (diabetic  patients);  Haas
2015) or primary care and women's health clinics (Wewers 2009),
and  two  recruited  dental  clinic  patients  (Binnie  2007;  Hanioka
2010). One recruited Chinese men with erectile dysfunction (Chan
2010).  Three  recruited  people  identified  as  having  mild  airway
obstruction  (Lung  Health  Study;  Kotz  2009)  or  COPD  (Tonnesen
2006).  One  recruited  employees  at  annual  occupational  health
checks (Rodriguez 2003). Okuyemi 2007 recruited residents of low-
income  public  housing  departments.  Schauffler  2001  recruited
members  of  health  maintenance  organisations  and  Velicer  2006
recruited  Veterans  Administration  medical  centre  patients,  in
both  cases  using  proactive  telephone  contact.  An  2006  recruited
Veterans Administration medical centre patients by mail. Hall 2002,
Otero  2006  and  McCarthy  2008  recruited  community  volunteers
motivated  to  quit  and  Hollis  2007  recruited  callers  to  a  quitline
seeking cessation assistance.

Selection by motivation to quit

We tried to classify trials according to whether or not willingness
to make a quit attempt was required for study eligibility. In some
studies motivation was an explicit requirement, including four trials
that  enrolled  motivated  volunteers  for  pharmacotherapy  trials
involving placebos (Hall 2002; Tonnesen 2006; McCarthy 2008; Kotz
2009). In some study reports there was no mention of motivation as
a requirement for inclusion. Some of these trials did recruit some
people  with  no  plans  to  quit  smoking.  In  others,  the  method  of
recruitment  or  the  requirement  to  adhere  to  a  protocol  made  it
seem likely that only people interested in attempting to quit would
enrol. We grouped the studies as follows:

• Motivation  required  (22  trials,  42%):  Simon  1997;  Lewis  1998;
Wewers 2000; Hall 2002; Vial 2002; Reid 2003; Rodriguez 2003;
An 2006; Baker 2006; Otero 2006; Tonnesen 2006; Cooney 2007;
Hollis  2007;  McCarthy  2008;  Reid  2008;  Kotz  2009:  Chan  2010;
Hanioka  2010;  Carmody  2012;  Rigotti  2014;  Winhusen  2014;
Peckham 2015.

• Motivation  not  required  but  participants  likely  to  have  been
interested  in  quitting  (10  trials,  19%):  Juarranz  Sanz  1998;
Molyneux 2003; Wakefield 2004; Mohiuddin 2007; Okuyemi 2007;
Villebro 2008; Sadr Azodi 2009, Wewers 2009; Brandstein 2011;
Haas 2015.

• Not selected by motivation (21 trials, 40%): Wilson 1988; Ockene
1991;  Segnan  1991;  Lung  Health  Study;  Schauffler  2001;  Katz
2004; Ratner 2004; Chouinard 2005; Emmons 2005; Duffy 2006;
Hall  2006;  Velicer  2006;  Binnie  2007;  Thomsen  2010;  Hickman
2015;  Lee  2015;  Murray  2013;  Bernstein  2015;  Perez-Tortosa
2015, Prochaska 2014; Stockings 2014.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Participant characteristics

Trials  typically  had  between  35  to  65%  female  participants.  Two
trials recruited only women (Wewers 2009; Thomsen 2010) and one
only men (Chan 2010). Five trials in the US Veterans Administration
medical  system  had  higher  proportions  of  men  (Simon  1997;  An
2006; Velicer 2006; Cooney 2007; Carmody 2012) as did a Spanish
workplace trial (Rodriguez 2003). The average age typically ranged
from low 40's to mid 50's. The age was younger in a trial amongst
survivors of childhood cancer (Emmons 2005).

Provider characteristics

Most counselling and support was provided by specialist cessation
counsellors  or  trained  trial  personnel.  In  a  small  subgroup  the
intervention  was  largely  given  by  usual  care  providers  including
general  practitioners/family  physicians  (Ockene  1991;  Segnan
1991;  Juarranz  Sanz  1998;  Perez-Tortosa  2015),  dental  hygienists
(Binnie  2007),  dentists  and  dental  hygienist  (Hanioka  2010)  or
occupational physicians (Rodriguez 2003). Two studies used peer
group  counsellors  (Emmons  2005;  Wewers  2000)  and  one  used
trained lay advisers (Wewers 2009).

Intervention characteristics

The typical intervention involved multiple contacts with a specialist
cessation adviser or counsellor, with most participants using some
pharmacotherapy and receiving multiple contacts. However, there
was a great deal of variation, including some interventions which
involved  making  pharmacotherapy  and  behavioural  components
available  to  a  large  population  in  which  take-up  of  treatment
was low (Schauffler 2001), or providing a brief intervention to all
participants and offering stepped care for those willing to set a quit
date (Reid 2003; Katz 2004). One intervention was delivered entirely
by mail or prerecorded phone messages, using an expert system for
tailoring contact (Velicer 2006) and two by telephone counselling
alone  (Hollis  2007;  Haas  2015).  All  others  included  some  face-to-
face  contact  but  additional  sessions  was  sometimes  provided  by
telephone. More than half the trials (n = 28, 53%) offered between
four and eight sessions and a quarter (n = 13) over eight sessions.
The modal category for contact time was 91 to 300 minutes (n = 22,
42%), with 17 (32%) offering between 31 and 90 minutes and eight
(15%)  over  300  minutes.  We  categorised  interventions  according
to the maximum planned contact unless session duration was not
described,  so  the  typical  time  per  participant  would  have  been
smaller, even in studies where the take-up of treatment was high.

The treatment offered to the control group typically involved brief
advice and self-help materials.

Excluded studies

We  list  90  studies  as  excluded.  In  most  of  these  there  was
in  the  use  of
no  difference  between  treatment  conditions 
pharmacotherapy, and the trial tested different types or amounts
of adjunct behavioural support. Trials of this type contribute to a
separate  review  (Stead  2015).  A  small  number  of  studies  did  not
report six month or longer follow-up. Reasons for exclusion can be
found in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.

Risk of bias in included studies

Figure  1  presents  review  authors'  judgements  about  each  risk  of
bias  item  as  percentages  across  all  included  studies.  We  did  not
judge any studies to be at risk of 'other' bias.

Allocation

Incomplete outcome data

All  studies  reported  that  treatment  allocation  was  random,  with
more  than  half  explicitly  describing  an  adequate  method  of
generating  the  randomization  schedule.  One  cluster  randomized
study was judged at high risk of bias because the unit of assignment
was  the  ward,  and  an  imbalance  in  the  type  of  ward  assigned  to
each condition lead to an imbalance in participant characteristics
(Murray  2013).  Thirty  (57%)  reported  a  procedure  for  allocation
concealment that we judged to be at a low risk of bias. Three studies
were judged at high risk of selection bias (Wilson 1988; Duffy 2006;
Perez-Tortosa  2015),  two  of  which  were  cluster  randomized.  The
participants  in  Wilson  1988  were  recruited  by  receptionists  who
could not be blind to practice condition, and there were baseline
differences  in  consent  rate  and  in  motivation  to  quit  between
conditions. Some participants in Perez-Tortosa 2015 were recruited
in  health  centres  after  allocation.  Duffy  2006  recruited  cancer
patients with either smoking, alcohol or depression problems, and
had  more  smokers  in  the  intervention  group  suggesting  possible
recruitment  bias.  The  other  20  (38%)  trial  reports  gave  too  little
information about allocation procedures to be certain that the risk
of bias was low, and were hence judged to be at unclear risk of bias
in this domain.

Blinding

We  did  not  formally  evaluate  blinding  of  participants,  providers
or  other  personnel.  It  was  almost  always  unclear  whether
or  not  participants  would  have  known  that  they  were  in  a
control  condition,  but  most  controls  did  include  advice  and
support  for  smoking  cessation.  Providers  could  not  have  been
blind  to  treatment  condition.  Self-reported  smoking  status  was
biochemically  validated  at  longest  follow-up  in  35  studies,  with
twelve  of  these  measuring  cotinine  and  the  remainder  carbon
monoxide  (CO).  Seven  studies  either  did  not  collect  samples  at
final follow-up (Sadr Azodi 2009; Bernstein 2015; Lee 2015) or did
not  obtain  samples  from  enough  participants  and  did  not  report
validated quit rates (Reid 2003; Katz 2004; Villebro 2008; Hickman
2015).  Eleven  studies  did  not  attempt  any  type  of  validation
(Ockene 1991; Schauffler 2001; Emmons 2005; An 2006; Duffy 2006;
Otero  2006;  Velicer  2006;  Hollis  2007;  Thomsen  2010;  Brandstein
2011; Haas 2015).

We classified two studies at high risk of attrition bias. In Hanioka
2010  a  number  of  control  participants  declined  consent  once
told  their  treatment  group.  In  Perez-Tortosa  2015  a  number  of
participants  were  excluded  from  analyses  because  of  a  lack  of
baseline  data,  and  losses  to  follow-up  were  also  excluded  from
reported  analyses.  In  other  studies,  later  dropouts  were  counted
as  continuing  smokers,  and  all  other  trials  were  classified  as  low
risk  of  bias  due  to  loss  to  follow-up.  Most  trials  lost  less  than
20%  of  each  condition.  There  were  a  small  number  of  trials  in
which  the  proportion  lost  to  follow-up  was  over  20%  and  also
differed between groups. Of the trials at potential risk of bias, Binnie
2007 and Villebro 2008 had high and differential losses, but since
both were small trials any effect on the meta-analysis of different
assumptions would be small. Hall 2006 and Hollis 2007 both had
relatively high losses but both reported that different assumptions
about the smoking status of those lost to follow-up would not be
likely to alter their relative effects.

Effects of interventions

See:  Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison  Combined
pharmacotherapy  and  behavioural  interventions  for  smoking
cessation

A pooled estimate combining all 53 included studies using a Mantel-
Haenszel fixed-effect model had a very high level of heterogeneity
(I2 = 70%, data not shown). This heterogeneity was attributable to
the  Lung  Health  Study  which  showed  a  very  strong  intervention
effect  (relative  risk  [RR]  3.88,  95%  confidence  interval  [CI]  3.35
to  4.50).  This  study  had  a  particularly  intensive  intervention;  the
behavioural  component  was  a  group-based  12  session  course,
and  nicotine  gum  was  available  without  charge  for  six  months.
Removing this study from the meta-analysis reduced heterogeneity
(I2  =  36%),  and  a  benefit  of  intervention  was  still  detected  (RR
1.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.98, 19319 participants, Figure 2, Analysis 1.1,
Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison).  Only  three  trials
(Wakefield 2004; Ratner 2004; Okuyemi 2007) had lower quit rates in
the intervention than the control group and all had wide confidence
intervals.

There  was  some  evidence  of  asymmetry  in  a  funnel  plot;  there
was  an  excess  of  small  trials  detecting  larger  effects,  suggesting
the possibility of publication or other bias. In a sensitivity analysis,
removing  smaller  studies  did  not  markedly  decrease  the  pooled
estimate.

Subgroup analyses

Appendix 2 lists study characteristics used for subgroup analyses
for each included study. All the subgroup analyses reported below
exclude the Lung Health Study.

Effect of setting

The  pooled  estimate  for  trials  that  recruited  participants  in
healthcare  settings  (RR  1.97,  95%  CI  1.79  to  2.18,  43  trials,  13863
participants)  was  significantly  higher  than  that  for  trials  that
recruited volunteers in other settings (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.76, 8
trials, 4906 participants) (Analysis 2.1). There were more small trials
with large and significant effects in the healthcare subgroup, and a
number of these had notably low quit rates in the control arms.

Effect of selection by motivation to quit

We  did  not  detect  evidence  that  the  relative  effect  of  the
intervention  differed  according  to  whether  participants  were
prepared  to  make  a  quit  attempt  or  not  (Analysis  3.1).  The
subgroup  of  participants  selected  for  motivation  had  a  slightly
larger estimated effect (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.15, 22 trials, 7088
participants) than the 'Not selected' subgroup (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.42
to  1.80,  20  trials,  10138  participants);  the  largest  effect  estimate
was  in  the  subgroup  of  10  trials  that  did  not  explicitly  select
for  motivation,  but  that  seemed  unlikely  to  recruit  unmotivated
participants (RR 2.71, 95% CI 2.11 to 3.49, 2262 participants). There
was  also  considerable  heterogeneity  in  this  subgroup  (I2  =  61%),
for which there was no obvious explanation. In a meta-regression,
motivation to quit was not found to be an effect modifier (p = 0.09).
In  this  update  there  was  no  longer  any  sign  that  average  control
group quit rates were higher in the more motivated populations.

Effect of provider

The  behavioural  intervention  was  provided  by  specialists  in
cessation  counselling  in  39  of  the  trials.  In  nine  trials,  the
support/counselling  was  given  by  a  non  specialist  healthcare
professional  involved  in  usual  care.  In  a  further  two  trials
behavioural  support  was  provided  by  a  peer  counsellor,  one  of
which  was  a  very  small  pilot  (Wewers  2000).  One  trial  used
trained lay advisers (Wewers 2009). One trial (Velicer 2006) had no
person-to-person  contact  and  behavioural  support  was  provided
by  an  'expert  system'  generating  individualised  written  materials
and  prerecorded  telephone  messages.  There  was  no  important
difference between the specialist care subgroup (RR 1.81, 95% CI
1.64 to 1.99, I2 = 25%, 39 trials, 12252 participants) and the subgroup
where counselling was linked to usual care (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.70
to  2.43,  I2  =  54%,  9  trials,  5112  participants)  (Analysis  4.1).  In  the
previous version of the review there was a difference by provider
that  might  have  been  attributable  to  confounding  with  take-up
of  treatment  and  duration  of  contact.  For  this  update,  we  did

three separate exploratory meta-regressions controlling for type of
provider, take-up of treatment and duration of contact; none was
an effect modifier (p-values 0.37, 0.08 and 0.46 respectively).

Effect of intensity

We categorised trials by intended number of sessions and planned
total  duration  of  contact.  Not  all  interventions  prescribed  a  fixed
number or standardised length of sessions, and not all participants
received  all  planned  contacts.  Unsurprisingly  there  was  some
correlation between number of sessions and duration of contact;
for  example,  all  interventions  that  intended  to  provide  at  least
300  minutes  of  contact  had  at  least  four  sessions  scheduled.
Where there was personal contact, there was only weak evidence
that  studies  offering  more  sessions  had  larger  effects  (Analysis
5.1);  the  subgroup  of  trials  offering  eight  or  more  sessions  had
the  largest  estimate  (RR  2.10,  95%  CI  1.65  to  2.68,  13  trials,
2270  participants)  but  CIs  overlapped.  One  to  three  and  four
to  eight  session  categories  had  almost  the  same  effects.  There
was  no  clear  evidence  that  increasing  the  duration  of  personal
contact increased the effect either (Analysis 6.1). Estimates for each
subgroup overlapped. There was more heterogeneity in the 31 to 90
minute category (I2 = 55%), partially attributable to Juarranz Sanz
1998, (RR 9.34). In an exploratory meta-regression neither number
(p = 0.85) nor duration (p = 0.46) alone or in combination (p = 0.73)
were effect modifiers, nor was take-up in combination with these
(p = 0.36).

Effect of differences in treatment take-up

Only three trials were classified as 'low take-up of treatment' (Katz
2004; Reid 2003; Schauffler 2001), and in these the estimated effect
was smaller, whilst there was little difference between the 18 that
were moderate and 29 that were high (Analysis 7.1). As noted above
in the analyses of intensity, there was no longer any evidence from
meta-regression  of  an  effect  of  intensity  even  in  the  subgroup  of
'high take-up' trials.

Direct tests of intensity of support

Two trials compared multiple intensities of support. In both cases
the  more  intensive  condition  was  compared  to  the  control  in
the  primary  analysis.  Hollis  2007  offered  up  to  four  additional
telephone  calls  in  the  intensive  counselling  condition  compared
to  a  30  to  40  minute  motivational  interview  and  a  single  follow-
up  call  in  the  moderate  condition  but  this  did  not  significantly
increase  quit  rates.  Higher  intensity  participants  had  on  average
only  about  14  minutes  more  contact.  Otero  2006  randomized  to
one,  two,  three  or  four  weekly  hour-long  sessions  but  pooled
reported  outcomes  for  one  to  two  and  three  to  four  sessions.
Direct comparisons of different intensities of behavioural therapy
as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy are covered in a separate review
(Stead 2015).

the  results  of  trials  of  both  modalities  of  treatment.  Nicotine
replacement  therapy  (Stead  2012),  bupropion  and  nortriptyline
(Hughes 2014) and varenicline and cytisine (Cahill 2012) increase
quit  rates.  Group  therapy  (Stead  2005),  individual  counselling
(Lancaster  2005)  and  telephone  counselling  (Stead  2013)  have
all  been  shown  to  be  successful  ways  of  delivering  behavioural
support  for cessation  with some support for individually tailored
written  self-help  materials  (Hartmann-Boyce  2014).  The  effects
of  the  two  treatment  modalities  are  largely  assumed  to  be
independent, although behavioural support may influence correct
use  of  medication.  Although  guidelines  support  combining
approaches  where  possible,  the  size  of  effect  that  might  be
expected when both therapies are combined has not been clear.

Summary of main results

In  this  review  of  53  trials  evaluating 
interventions  that
combine  pharmacotherapy  with  behavioural  support,  we  found,
unsurprisingly, that the combination improves quit rates compared
to  no  treatment  or  a  minimum  intervention  (see  Summary  of
findings for the main comparison). This finding is in accord with the
evidence that each type of intervention is effective when evaluated
independently. A strength of the evidence from these trials is that
the results are largely consistent, with little evidence of clinically
important  heterogeneity  even  though  they  use  a  wide  range  of
approaches in many different populations and settings.

One  trial  demonstrated  a  large  benefit  of  a  multimodal  therapy.
The  Lung  Health  Study,  conducted  in  the  early  1990s,  achieved
a  cessation  rate  of  35%  at  one  year  in  the  intervention  group,
compared with 9% for the control. The investigators also reported
sustained  benefits  after  five  years,  and  demonstrated  reduced
mortality  in  the  intervention  group.  As  noted  above,  this  was
a  particularly  intensive  intervention.  Participants  were  offered
maintenance  sessions,  and  repeat  treatment  was  available  for
those failing to quit. In addition, all participants had mild airway
impairment,  and  intervention  group  participants  were  further
randomized  to  use  a  bronchodilator  or  placebo  inhaler.  This
component might have increased motivation for quitting, and the
relatively high rates of cessation in the control group would support
this.

The pooled estimate for the remaining 52 trials (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.
68 to 1.98) suggests that a combined intervention might typically
increase  cessation  success  by  70  to  100%.  Most  of  the  trials  in
this review offered one or more types of NRT, or bupropion. Based
on  estimates  from  Cochrane  reviews  of  the  effects  for  NRT  alone
(pooled estimate from 117 trials RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.68, Stead
2012)  and  bupropion  alone  (pooled  estimate  from  44  trials,  RR
1.62, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.76, Hughes 2014), the additional benefit from
the behavioural component might seem small. However it may be
misleading  to  directly  compare  these  estimates,  and  we  did  not
attempt any formal statistical comparison.

There are important differences between the trials included in this
review and typical pharmacotherapy studies that should be noted.
Pharmacotherapy  trials  included  in  meta-analyses  typically  have
a  placebo  control,  but  the  control  group  also  receives  identical
behavioural support to the active therapy group. The intensity may
vary  from  brief  advice  on  correct  use  of  pharmacotherapy  and
provision  of  self-help  materials,  to  multiple  counselling  sessions.
The  trial  protocol  may  call  for  frequent  contact  with  a  clinical
research centre, even if counselling contact is limited. Participants

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

may  have  high  expectations  for  the  effect  of  treatment,  but  also
the  knowledge  that  they  could  be  receiving  placebo.  In  contrast,
in  the  studies  included  in  this  review  the  control  groups  had
limited  support,  but  this  typically  involved  advice  that  could  be
classified as a cessation intervention in other contexts. Additionally,
it was generally unclear whether controls would have known the
components  of  the  active  intervention  and  we  did  not  attempt
to  assess  the  risk  of  bias  from  lack  of  blinding.  In  almost  all  the
trials,  intervention  group  participants  would  have  known  they
were  receiving  active  medication,  but  without  the  connotations
of  receiving  a  'new'  drug.  Apart  from  the  small  number  of
included  trials  that  were  placebo-controlled  factorial  studies  of
medication  and  behavioural  components  (Hall  2006;  Tonnesen
2006; McCarthy 2008), trials in this review had pragmatic designs
and the intervention typically involved an offer of treatment. Actual
use of medication and take-up of a full programme of behavioural
support was not uniform across trials.

We  had  previously  detected  weak  evidence  for  possible  effect
modifiers using subgroup analyses and meta-regression. For most
of  the  subgroups,  any  differential  effects  have  become  smaller
and  were  no  longer  evident  in  meta-regressions.  We  did  find
evidence  of  larger  effects  when  trials  recruited  participants  in
health  care  settings.  We  did  not  find  evidence  that  the  type
of  provider,  the  motivation  of  the  participants,  the  intensity  of
behavioural  support  or  the  amount  of  support  taken  up  by
participants affected the estimates of relative effects. Almost all of
the  interventions  in  this  review  involved  multiple  sessions,  with
some  studies  providing  or  offering  more  than  eight  sessions  and
as  much  as  eight  hours  of  contact,  although  the  typical  intensity
was  much  lower.  We  no  longer  detected  evidence  from  indirect
comparisons that increasing contact increased quit success in the
trials  with  the  highest  take-up  of  treatment.  Stronger  evidence
for  a  dose-response  trend  might  have  been  obscured  by  the
multiple  differences  between  trials.  We  used  meta-regression  for
exploratory  analyses  of  some  potential  effect  modifiers  but  the
relatively  small  number  of  trials  and  large  number  of  variables
reduces  the  power  of  this  approach.  We  might  not  have  been
able  to  identify  or  quantify  possible  moderators.  For  example,
more  intensive  support  might  have  been  tested  in  'hard  to  treat'
populations  but  it  is  not  clear  how  this  might  be  characterised.
It  seems  unlikely  that  the  number  of  supportive  contacts  and
their  length  would  have  absolutely  no  effect  on  outcome,  but
our  findings  suggest  that  the  added  benefit  from  offering  more
intensive support may be small. One possible explanation is that
the  use  of  pharmacotherapy  attenuates  the  importance  of  the
behavioural support. Healthcare providers have an important role
in convincing smokers of the importance of attempting to quit and
making pharmacotherapy and behavioural support available. We
did  not  find  evidence  from  indirect  comparison  that  counselling
by trained specialists was critical for success; in fact the estimated
treatment effect was higher in the smaller group of trials where the
behavioural support was provided by non specialists, although we
do not think great importance should be attached to this finding.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

These  trials  have  been  undertaken  in  a  very  wide  range  of
settings  using  different  providers  of  care  and  amongst  different
populations.  The  populations  include  people  with  mental  illness
and  smoking  related  diseases.  The  relative  homogeneity  of  their
results therefore supports the general applicability of the evidence.

Although most of the trials provided one or more types of NRT, and
a small number offered bupropion, there is no reason to suppose
that  the  results  would  not  apply  to  interventions  that  offered
varenicline.

Using  a  pharmacotherapy  and  accessing  behavioural  support
will  increase  the  chance  of  giving  up  smoking,  but  people  who
smoke  are  unlikely  to  use  this  combination  when  making  a  quit
attempt.  A  US  survey  in  2003  found  that  only  5.9%  of  those
making  a  quit  attempt  in  the  previous  year  had  used  combined
behavioural  and  pharmacologic  treatment  (Shiffman  2008).  An
English survey of smokers between 2006 and 2012 found that 4.8%
of people attempting to quit smoking had used both a prescription
pharmacotherapy and specialist behavioural support (Kotz 2014).

Quality of the evidence

The  majority  of  studies  were  judged  to  be  at  low  or  unclear  risk
of  bias,  and  only  five  of  the  included  studies  were  judged  to  be
at  high  risk  of  bias  in  one  or  more  domains.  The  results  of  the
meta-analysis were not sensitive to the exclusion of any single trial.
Excluding studies that did not use biochemical validation did not
reduce the effect size. The largest study, Hollis 2007, was atypical
in that all contact was telephone-based, via a quitline (most other
studies included some face-to-face contact); it also had a potential
methodological  weakness  due  to  losses  to  follow-up  and  lack  of
biochemical validation, although we did not judge these to put it
at a high risk of bias. Excluding this study did not alter the effect
estimate.

identify  studies.  The  Register 

We  used  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Specialised  Register
to 
includes  reports  of  trials
identified  from  the  major  bibliographic  databases.  There  is
no  straightforward  term  for  the  type  of  intervention  we  were
interested  in,  but  we  screened  any  trial  report  that  mentioned
a  pharmacotherapy.  It  is  possible  that  the  Register  does  not
include all relevant trial reports or that we failed to identify some.
Our  methods  for  data  extraction  and  analysis  are  those  used  for
other Cochrane reviews. The practice of imputing missing data as
smoking is standard practice for primary and secondary research in
smoking cessation and has the advantage that absolute cessation
rates  are  not  inflated  by  ignoring  loss  to  follow-up.  Bias  in  the

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

relative effect will only be introduced if misclassification differs for
people who are lost from the intervention condition compared to
the  control.  If  proportionately  more  of  those  who  are  lost  in  the
control group are assumed to be smokers but have in fact quit then
the treatment effect would be overestimated.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

The  results  of  this  review  are  broadly  in  agreement  with  other
reviews  and  guidelines  (Hughes  1995;  Reus  2008).  US  Guidelines
(Fiore 2008) endorse a dose-response relationship for total amount
of  contact  time  (up  to  300  minutes)  and  number  of  sessions,
as  well  as  session  length.  Their  meta-analyses  suggest  clear
trends although there were not necessarily significant differences
between adjacent categories. There were however clear differences
between for example 4 to 30 minutes of contact time (odds ratio
(OR) 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.3) and 91 to 300 minutes (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.3
to 4.6) (Fiore 2008 table 6.9) and between two to three treatment
sessions (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7) and over eight sessions (OR 2.3,
95% CI 2.1 to 3.0) (Fiore 2008 table 6.10). Our estimates comparing
subgroups of trials classified by within trial differences in intensity
show less clear evidence of a dose-response effect, although they
do not exclude there being one.

Implications for practice

Interventions  that  combine  pharmacotherapy  and  behavioural
support  increase  smoking  cessation  success  in  a  wide  range  of
settings and populations, compared to a minimal intervention or
usual care. This suggests that clinicians should encourage smokers
to  use  both  types  of  aid.  Offering  more  intensive  behavioural
support  was  not  shown  to  be  associated  with  larger  treatment
effects;  this  may  be  because  intensive  interventions  are  more
difficult to deliver consistently to participants.

Implications for research

It  is  unlikely  that  further  trials  will  alter  the  main  findings  of  this
review,  although  they  may  contribute  to  further  understanding
about  the  effects  of  treatment  in  particular  settings  or  in
populations of smokers.

Of those offered NRT, 80% accepted the first 5-week regimen and 25%/28% requested a second 3-week
refill and there were no differences across the three levels of behavioural intensity. 3 with NRT vs 1
without NRT used in main analysis, but little difference between moderate and intensive outcomes

Clinical and research staff and patients were aware of group assignment, and
Intervention group participants were recruited soon after admission whilst
control group participants recruited prior to discharge. However 'Although the
study design precluded blinding, ward staff were unaware of the exact details
of the study, and patients were specifically not informed of the components
of the intervention being tested. Consent ... was only sought for the follow-up
measures, for which the procedure was identical for both groups. It is there-
fore unlikely that knowledge of missing out on treatment influenced the re-

Validation: saliva cotinine ≤ 0.057 µmol/L, or saliva thiocyanate ≤ µ1724 mol/L if the patient was still
using nicotine gum.

Intervention patients more motivated to quit, so adjusted mean cessation rates used. For meta-analy-
sis we estimated number of quitters without a correction for clustering within practices; the number of
clusters was large, cluster size small (average 28 patients/cluster) and cessation rates did not vary sig-
nificantly among practices within treatment groups.
Less than 65% of intervention used any gum, 27% used only a few pieces.

High risk

Receptionists recruited the first one or two eligible smokers each day. Usual
care group physicians were not alerted but other physicians prompted to offer
intervention. Recruitment consent rates lower for intervention (76%) than con-
trol (91%), and baseline differences in motivation to quit.

A second planned objective of the review was to evaluate the effect of increasing behavioural support for people using pharmacotherapy.
This is now addressed in a companion review (Stead 2015).

The categories used for some subgroup analyses were altered: we distinguished between no person-to-person contact and between one
and three sessions rather than using the US Guideline categories of zero to one and two to three, and collapsed one to three minutes and 4
to 30 minutes for contact time. We added categories of peer group counsellor and lay counsellor to provider type, and we added a category
of studies that did not explicitly select for motivation but where study procedures or participant characteristics suggested that participants
were typically motivated to quit.

We did not use a brief/moderate/intensive subgroup analysis because it did not help discriminate between studies.
