Gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse and manipulation. It involves someone making you question your beliefs, behaviors, and perception of reality. It can impact your sense of self.

The term “gaslighting” comes from the 1938 play “Gas Light,” later released as the 1940 and 1944 movies “Gaslight.” The story follows a husband who isolates and manipulates his wife with the goal of institutionalizing her.

Dr. Robin Stern, co-founder and associate director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, helped popularize the term “gaslighting” with her 2007 book, “The Gaslight Effect.”


## What are signs and examples of gaslighting?


Many types of gaslighting exist, and they may manifest in slightly different ways. Someone who’s gaslighting you may:

- insist you said or did things you know you didn’t do

- deny or scoff at your recollection of events

- call you “too sensitive” or “crazy” when you express your needs or concerns

- express doubts to others, even if jokingly, about your feelings, behavior, and state of mind

- twisting or retelling events to shift blame to you

- insist they’re right and refuse to consider facts or your perspective

The most common sign of gaslighting in a relationship is if you constantly second-guess yourself based on the things the other person says or does. Feeling overwhelmed, confused, and uncertain about your ability to make decisions on your own are also gaslighting signs.

You may be on the receiving side of gaslighting if you notice emotional or mental changes in yourself like:

- an urge to apologize all the time

- believing you can’t do anything right

- frequent feelings of nervousness, anxiety, or worry, especially when you’re around the other person

- a loss of overall confidence

- constantly wondering if you’re too sensitive or if the other person is right when they say so

- feeling disconnected from yoursense of self, as if you’re losing your identity

- believing you’re to blame when things go wrong

- a persistent sense that something isn’t right, though you can’t identify exactly what’s wrong

- a lingering sense of hopelessness, frustration, oremotional numbness

These feelings tend to come from what the other person says or implies about your behavior. For example:

- “You seem so confused lately, and you keep forgetting things. I’m getting a little worried.”

- “You know I wouldn’t say these things if I didn’t care, right?”

- “Are you nuts? I never said that!”

- “Why is everything so complicated with you?”

- “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”

- “I’m not the only one that thinks these things.”

- “Yeah, right! Whatever you say.”

- “You’re always turning everything into a big deal.”

Gaslighting can also show up as changes in your behavior. You might find yourself:

- making choices to please others instead of yourself

- frequently questioning whether you said the right thing or made the right choice

- making excuses for the person gaslighting you to family and friends

- lying or isolating yourself from loved ones to avoid conflict

- constantly reviewing your words and actions to make sure you’ve done everything “right”

- spending little or no time on the activities or hobbies you used to enjoy

The effects of gaslighting often happen in three distinct stages, according to Stern, though not every gaslighting dynamic involves all of these:

- Disbelief:Someone displays gaslighting behavior. It seems unusual, but you brush it off as a one-time thing.

- Defense:After a few more instances of gaslighting, you start to defend yourself and push back.

- Depression:Eventually, especially if you care for the other person, you start accepting their version of reality to avoid conflict. You may also increase your efforts to earn their approval. These efforts and second-guessing yourself drain your energy, disconnecting you from yourself and leaving you feeling low and hopeless.


## Why do people gaslight others?


According to Stern, people often gaslight because the feeling of being right allows them to validate themselves.

When a person who gaslights feels their identity or power threatened, they need you to believe and support their version of events in order to maintain their sense of control.

Gaslighting can also happen when someone believes their narrative is more valid than someone else’s, but they may not have strong arguments. They still need to feel superior, so putting someone else’s opinions down may give them that sense of superiority.


## Other examples of gaslighting


Gaslighting isn’t the same as someone lying to you, expressing a different opinion, or saying you’re wrong about something. It’s more nuanced, which can make it harder to recognize.

Anyone can gaslight, not just people in your personal life.

Politicians, for example, gaslight when they deny events recorded on video or witnessed by multiple people. Doctors may gaslight when they suggest you’ve imagined your symptoms, imply that you’re exaggerating your pain, or recommend therapy instead of medical treatment.

Here are some other examples of gaslighting in action:

You live with your mother. The two of you get along fairly well, but she often questions you when you come home a little late.

“You said you’d be home right after work tonight,” she insists one day. “I told you I need my medication, but now the pharmacy will be closed by the time we get there.”

When you tell her you don’t recall that conversation about taking her to run errands, she shakes her head in disbelief. “You stood right there and promised you’d be home early.”

Butyouremember making coffee quietly in the kitchen so you wouldn’t wake her. You say this, but she refuses to consider your version of events.

Later, you overhear her talking loudly on the phone. “I’m just not sure about their state of mind,” she says. “They can’t even remember a conversation from this morning!”

Similar situations play out repeatedly, to the point where you begin wondering whether youareforgetting things.


### In a romantic relationship


You have some pretty convincing proof your partner has been unfaithful. You ask them about it directly, giving them a chance to be honest.

Consider these two reactions:

- “What? No, of course I’m not cheating on you.”

- “Howdareyou accuse me of cheating. I work all day and come home to spend time with you, but you’re never here. You say you’re working, but who knows where you are?You’reprobably the one cheating. And if I were cheating, it’s not like you could blame me, since you’re always too tired for sex.”

The first response is just a lie. The second, however, may be an attempt to make you feel guilty enough to drop the subject for good. Even if you don’t believe them, you might end up questioning your evidence of their affair — or feeling bad for not being a “better” partner and try to make it up to them instead.

You’ve earned a promotion to manager. With the promotion comes an assistant manager — someone who wanted that same promotion.

Over the past few weeks, you’ve noticed documents disappearing from your desk and important phone messages not coming through.

When you ask the assistant manager if they’ve seen any of the documents, their angry reaction surprises you.

“Are you accusing me of taking your things? Remember, my job is to helpyou. Why would I do anything like that?”

When you ask about another missing file a few weeks later, they say, “You know, you seem really stressed lately. This promotion is a big change. Not everyone can handle the responsibility.”


### When seeking medical care


For months, you’ve had some persistent abdominal symptoms that concern you, along with a generally low mood and fatigue.

Your doctor, however, seems skeptical. They ask whether you could be pregnant or if the symptoms relate to your period. You assure them the symptoms come and go at all times and that you’re definitely not pregnant.

“I see you have a high-stress job. Maybe you’re just stressed out. Try drinking some chamomile tea.”

You try to explain that you think your low mood relates more to living with chronic pain, discomfort, and lack of energy.

“You’re too young to feel this way. It doesn’t look like anything serious. Just try to relax.”

Their dismissal doesn’t feel right, but, then, you didn’t go to medical school, either. If they say your symptoms are nothing to worry about, well, maybe they really aren’t that bad, after all.

## Why does gaslighting work?


Gaslighting works partly because you want to trust and respect the person gaslighting you. You want to have faith in your doctor, your parents, your partner, or your best friend.

Plus, gaslighting isn’t always obvious or extreme. Often, it’s disguised as an attempt to “look out for you.”

“I’m sorry I have to tell you this,” your roommate says one day. “But your friends don’t really like you. They only hang out with you because you have money and they can take advantage of you. I just thought you should know.”

Their words resonate because you’ve secretly worried about that. You could always ask your friends, but that kernel of doubt leaves you afraid of their response.


## How to respond to gaslighting


If you’ve noticed some signs of gaslighting, you can take steps to address it and reclaim your emotional space.


### Turn to loved ones


If you suspect someone is gaslighting you, it never hurts to get some outside perspective. Trusted friends and family members not directly involved in the relationship can:

- offer their perspective

- help you get some clarity

- provideemotional support

If you’ve recently started to distance yourself from your loved ones, keep in mind that isolation can only make gaslighting more successful.

It’s often easier to question yourself about an argument or discussion that happened days ago.

Recording events immediately after they happen provides evidence you don’t need to second-guess. Jotting down highlights from a conversation or using a smartphone app to record your argument offers something to review when your memory is called into question.

You may not feel comfortable confronting the person, but your notes can help you recognize what’s happening.


### Set clear boundaries


Establishing boundariescan interrupt someone’s attempts to gaslight you and provide some physical and emotional space.

The next time it happens, consider these responses:

- “It seems we remember things differently, so let’s move on.”

- “If you call me ‘crazy,’ I’m going to leave the room.”

- “We can talk about it, but if you shout, I’m going to leave.”

Sticking to these boundaries is essential. Following through shows them they can’t manipulate you.


### Hold on to the things that make you who you are


Gaslighting often involves a loss of personal identity. Over time, you may begin to feel like you’ve changed beyond recognition or become numb and hollow.

Living in a constant state of nervousness and worry can leave you with little energy forself-careor your own interests.

Yet making time to meet your physical and emotional needs can help you reclaim your energy and hold on to your sense of self. As a result, you may even find it easier to navigate and challenge attempts to gaslight you.
