Abstract. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and complex neurodegenerative disorder. Conventional pharmacological or
surgical therapies alone are often insufﬁcient at adequately alleviating disability. Moreover, there is an increasing shift toward
person-centered care, emphasizing the concept of “living well”. In this context, arts-based interventions offer great promise,
functioning as platforms for creative expression that could provide novel mechanisms to promote quality of life. Here we
present a qualitative review of arts-based interventions for PD, including music, dance, drama, visual arts, and creative
writing. For each, we discuss their applications to PD, proposed mechanisms, evidence from prior studies, and upcoming
research. We also provide examples of community-based projects. Studies to date have had relatively small sample sizes,
but their ﬁndings suggest that arts-based interventions have the potential to reduce motor and non-motor symptoms. They
may also empower people with PD and thereby address issues of self-esteem, foster personal problem-solving, and augment
holistic well-being. However, there is a paucity of research determining optimal dosage and symptom-speciﬁc beneﬁts of
these therapies. If art were a drug, we would have to perform appropriately powered studies to provide these data before
incorporating it into routine patient care. We therefore call for further research with properly designed studies to offer more
rigorous and evidence-based support for what we intuitively think is a highly promising approach to support individuals
living with PD. Given the possible positive impact on people’s lives, arts-based approaches merit further development and,
if proven to be effective, systematic inclusion within integrated management plans.

being [1]. In addition to symptoms, people with PD
often experience social isolation, stigma, and reduced
self-esteem [2–4]. Current pharmacological or sur-
gical interventions fall short of adequately treating
these multiple facets of PD [5, 6]. Arts-based inter-
ventions are emerging as therapeutic modalities with
the potential to enhance quality of life by uniquely
tackling aspects of the disease that conventional treat-
ments cannot address.

Fig. 1. Example of the effects of dopaminergic therapies on creativity in PD. Steven Iseman is a 58-year-old man who was diagnosed
with PD at age 47. He worked as a lawyer and had no artistic interests prior to his diagnosis. After starting treatment with levodopa and
pramipexole, he developed new creative abilities which he applies to sculptural art using 3D printing. These three pieces titled Zeus’s
Workshop (left), Mother and Child (middle), and Spring Forest Riot (right) demonstrate the diversity of his work. His substantial artistic
output can be appreciated on his website (www.stevenisemanart.ca). All materials published with permission from Steven Iseman.

Fig. 2. Example of changes in the work by an artist with PD over the disease course. (A) Zus Keulemans-Goosen (1932–2023) was a
self-taught artist who dedicated herself to drawing, painting, and ceramic work starting in her 50 s. She was diagnosed with PD at age 71 and
changed her artistic mediums and methods with the progression of her disease. (B) She initially favored large canvases for painting, but the
constraints imposed by PD led her to transition to smaller formats. An early large painting and a small painting from later in her disease are
juxtaposed here. An interview (in Dutch) in which one of the authors (BRB) interviews the artist’s daughter, Elianne Keulemans, provides
further insights into how PD affected the artist (www.vimeo.com/864883633/880431a3d2). All materials published with permission from
Elianne Keulemans.

PD involves the central dopaminergic system [1]
which can be linked to artistic inclinations [7–9],
and there is an intriguing interplay between art and
PD [10, 11]. The neurodegenerative process in PD
leads to reduced dopaminergic transmission, which
may be expected to lead to reduced creativity. How-
ever, pharmacotherapy with dopaminergic agents and
deep brain stimulation (DBS) for PD can alter this
system, leading to noticeable changes, either decreas-
ing or increasing creativity (Fig. 1). For example,
Pelowski et al. [7] reported cases of individuals with
PD experiencing changes in creative prowess; these
shifts were attributed either to neurodegeneration
itself or to enhanced stimulation of the mesolimbic
dopaminergic pathways by dopamine replacement
therapies. Artists with PD can experience varying

degrees of changes in their art, including in style or
artistic domain, sometimes due to altered creativity
or directly due to motor difﬁculties or both (Fig. 2).
As creative individuals, artists with PD often dis-
cover ways to adapt or compensate for dysfunction
due to their disease (Fig. 3). In visual arts, studies
have documented shifts in abstractness, symbolism,
and color choices [12–15]. While many reports high-
light an increase in creativity (typically following
the initiation of dopaminergic treatments), transform-
ing “unremarkable” creations to artworks deemed
exhibition-worthy [16], some studies also noted a
decline in creativity [17]. Decrease in artistic cre-
ativity after DBS has been related to the reduction
of dopamine replacement therapy post procedure,
speciﬁcally dopamine agonists [18].

Fig. 3. Example of adaptations made by an artist with PD. Barbara Salsberg Mathews is a 64-year-old woman who was diagnosed
with PD at age 60. She has been an artist since childhood, both in the realm of visual arts (www.salsbergmathews.com) and theater
(www.mimeovermind.com). Two examples of adaptations she has made with her drawing and painting since developing PD include (A)
exploiting her hand tremor by allowing the involuntary rhythmic movements to produce pencil shading and (B) using a folding stick to
support her affected arm and prevent the hand from smudging pencil or touching wet paint. All materials published with permission from

The connections between artistry and the dopamin-
ergic system make arts-based therapies particularly
suitable for PD. This aligns with the trend
towards person-centered care, emphasizing multi-
modal approaches [19], and thus advantageous for the
multifaceted nature of PD. These interventions also
foster a sense of belonging, self-value, and cognitive
engagement [20]. Arts are a way for persons living
with PD to express themselves as creative individ-
uals, rather than as patients. Moreover, arts offer a
unique way of expanding a person’s world which is
otherwise constantly shrinking due to the effects of
PD, such as progressive immobility, dysarthria, and
cognitive dysfunction, among others [21].

Here we provide a descriptive, qualitative review
of the recent literature on prominent arts-based inter-
ventions for PD: music, dance, drama, visual arts,
and creative writing. We focus on studies published
within the last three years to highlight the latest ﬁnd-
ings and identify current trends. We discuss their
relevance for healthcare, potential targets of impact
to be further investigated, and major gaps in the ﬁeld.
Moreover, we highlight some upcoming research
and current community-based projects to inform the
research community as well as stakeholders such
as people with PD, caregivers, community organi-
zations, among others. Our objective is to advocate
for the potential integration of arts-based methods in
the current management of PD. More than symptom
mitigators, these interventions can enhance personal-

ized therapy while empowering individuals [19, 20,
22]. We recognize that, if art were a drug, evidence
for its efﬁcacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness would
be required to routinely recommend it as a treat-
ment option in daily care. We therefore also critically
review the evidence to support existing art interven-
tions. Based on this, we call for further research,
including properly designed studies, to offer rigorous
and evidence-based support for what we intuitively
view as a highly promising approach to support indi-
viduals living with PD.

METHODS

A non-systematic literature review was performed
in PubMed. A combination of the following terms
was used: “music”, “dance”, “drama or theater”,
“visual arts or painting or sculpture or drawing”,
“creative writing or writing or journaling” and
“Parkinson’s disease”. Articles published in the past
3 years were favored, when possible, but no date
restriction was imposed. Articles were selected by
a single author (PG) for their relevance in describ-
ing the corresponding arts-based intervention and
their inﬂuence on motor and non-motor symptoms of
PD. ChatGPT, version 3.5, a language model devel-
oped by OpenAI (www.openai.com), was used for
language reﬁnement of this manuscript.

Fig. 4. Arts-based interventions for PD. There are multiple types of interventions including music, dance, drama, visual arts, and creative
writing. Small studies (i.e., analogous to phase 1 and 2a drug trials) have demonstrated several potential beneﬁts for people with PD. Further
research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these potential beneﬁts, and larger and more rigorous studies (i.e., analogous
to phase 2b or 3 drug trials) are needed. UPDRS, Uniﬁed Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; MDS-UPDRS, Movement Disorders Society

ART INTERVENTIONS FOR
PARKINSON’S DISEASE

Music

Types of music interventions: Sihvonen et al.
[23] deﬁne music therapy as “music-based interven-
tions delivered in a clinical setting by a credentialed
music therapist that use various musical elements
(e.g., singing, creating, moving to, or listening to
music)”. This review extends beyond music ther-
apy, encompassing various music interventions for
PD in the literature. Music is currently used for a
variety of neurological conditions such as stroke,
epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, among others [23, 24].
It includes passive activities like listening to music
and active participation through singing, playing
instruments, or engaging in speciﬁc methods like
the Ronnie Gardner Rhythm and Music Method [25,
26]. In addition, there is music-based physical ther-
apy or exercise which has been studied (Fig. 4)
[26].

Proposed mechanisms: Listening to music inﬂu-
ences brain connectivity, engages the basal ganglia
in rhythm perception, and activates memory centers

[23, 27]. There is a small evidence base indicating
that music may induce neuroplasticity in the normal
developing brain [28] and in the adult brain [23, 28,
29]. For example, structural and functional differ-
ences in regions involved in music were found when
musicians were compared to nonmusicians [28]. The
mesolimbic reward system, including the nucleus
accumbens, contributes to increased dopamine levels
leading to the emotional responses and enjoyment
experienced while listening to music, potentially
interacting with the motor pathways [23]. Music is
also thought to activate the parasympathetic system.
The basal ganglia are responsible for timing and cue-
ing in healthy individuals, and therefore those with
PD may experience loss of rhythm when ﬁnger tap-
ping, walking, or capturing rhythms [30]. The cueing
related to music is thought to play a role in improv-
ing movement, including entrainment, gait speed, and
stride length [31, 32]. The auditory-motor pathway
connection underlies rhythmic auditory stimulation
which was shown to improve gait quality, balance,
and stride length as well as reduce fall frequency and
freezing of gait (Fig. 4) [33–35].

Evidence from prior studies: A recent system-
atic review suggested that music therapy in PD

P. Gros et al. / Arts for Parkinson’s Disease

may be associated with improved motor functioning,
swallowing, breathing, communication, emotional
factors, and quality of life [26]. Spina et al.[36]
demonstrated beneﬁts for cognition, including frontal
function, although the effect was short-lived. Group
singing, including chorale-based interventions, was
found to enhance speech, such as phonation, voice-
related quality of life, and interpersonal relationships
[37–39]. Mohseni et al.[40] proposed that combining
music therapy, mainly singing, with speech ther-
apy was more effective than each therapy alone
for improving swallowing in PD. Further, singing
may inﬂuence motor scores on the Uniﬁed Parkin-
son Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), as well as
stigma, anxiety, and stress [41, 42]. Playing a musi-
cal instrument was found to improve outcomes in PD.
GuitarPD, a randomized pilot study of non-traditional
guitar classes, demonstrated an improvement in mood
and anxiety in individuals with PD [43]. Studies eval-
uating group drumming showed partial increase in
social satisfaction and improved quality of life, with
variable beneﬁts regarding mobility [44, 45]. Studies
examining the Ronnie Gardner Rhythm and Music
Method reported variable ﬁndings: one study showed
improvements in mobility, cognition, and quality of
life, while another revealed improvement only in
quality of life, not in cognition, dual-tasking, or freez-
ing of gait [25, 46]. A recent pilot study comparing
music therapy and rehabilitation versus rehabilitation
alone found that music therapy and rehabilitation may
improve various aspects of quality of life, measured
by using Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)
scores [47]. In a meta-analysis, Zhou et al. [48] con-
cluded that music-based movement therapies, such
as dancing, walking, or marching using music, was
associated with improved balance, freezing of gait,
walking velocity, but also mental health (Fig. 4). Sev-
eral studies lacked a control group, and those that
did include one either used a no intervention con-
trol group or, in a minority, another intervention like
physiotherapy [26, 49]. Most studies indicate using
a group-based intervention or do not mention the
use of individualized interventions. A minority of
studies explicitly offered a personalized intervention
[50].

Upcoming research: Several researchers in the
US are studying music therapy for individuals with
PD, including a University of Washington group
using classical guitar [51, 52]. A University of
Massachusetts group is conducting a randomized
controlled trial evaluating whether music ther-
apy could prevent hospital-acquired delirium in

individuals with PD and Lewy Body Dementia
[53].

of

Examples

community-based

projects:
Community-based initiatives using music-based
interventions are numerous. In Canada, Singing with
Parkinson’s offers weekly online singing classes
[54] and Signature Therapy as well as Music &
Soul provide neurological music therapy sessions
[55, 56]. Singing with Parkinson’s is a therapeutic
choir and provides neurological music therapy in
Atlanta, USA [57]. Parkinson’s Europe has recently
partnered with Music Care, an app providing music
therapy to individuals living with PD [58].

Dance

Types of dance interventions: The American
Dance Therapy Association deﬁnes dance therapy as
the “psychotherapeutic use of movement to promote
emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration
of the individual, for the purpose of improving health
and well-being” [59]. This review extends beyond
dance therapy, encompassing the broader scope of
dance interventions for PD described in the literature.
Various types of dance interventions for individuals
living with PD have been described, including the
Dancing for PD method®, tango, Qi dance, tap danc-
ing, Sardinian folk dance, Irish dance, among others
(Fig. 4) [60].

Proposed mechanisms: Although music is an
important component of dance that provides external
auditory cueing, dance incorporates visual cueing;
both elements are lost when the basal ganglia are
lesioned [61]. Moreover, dance is associated with
enhanced activation of areas related to movements,
such as the frontoparietal action observation network,
thought to be involved in the observation of famil-
iar movements and production of movements [61,
62], as well as the cortico-striatal pathways involved
in posture and movements. White matter diffusivity
and neuroplasticity are also thought to play a role,
although the evidence in PD is limited [61, 63]. Dance
requires a dynamic control of balance, spatial aware-
ness, task shifting, strength and ﬂexibility [64]. It also
requires an important volume of movements and, in
itself, may lead to a greater amount of physical activ-
ity. Several types of dance involve variable degrees of
aerobic activity, with subsequent potential beneﬁts on
the cardiovascular system, mood, and cognition [64].
Connection with others contributes to the enjoyment
of dance, thus leading to motivation and potentially
better adherence compared to other exercises (Fig. 4)

S164

[64]. Studies have shown that partnered and non-
partnered dance is safe in mild and moderate PD, with
a partner providing additional somatosensory cues
and potentially mitigating fear of falling [65–68].

Evidence from prior studies: Several studies have
reported that dance is associated with improved motor
scores on the Movement Disorders Society UPDRS
part III (MDS-UPDRS III), functional mobility as
measured by the Timed Up & Go, gait speed, bal-
ance measured by the MiniBest Test, postural control,
and falls [60, 69–74]. In a meta-analysis, Hasan et al.
[75] found that dance compared to exercise improved
the MDS-UPDRS III, Timed Up & Go, Berg Bal-
ance Scale, and the MiniBest Test, but found no
difference with respect to freezing of gait and the 6-
min walk test change. Dance was found to inﬂuence
cognitive functions [70, 76–78], including execu-
tive function, episodic memory, spatial awareness,
cognitive switching, and dual tasking [69, 76, 77].
Associations with improved mental health, includ-
ing anxiety, depression, apathy, and emotional and
social well-being, were also reported in most studies,
although the evidence is mixed [71, 74–76, 78–81].
Results from a cohort study of 49 individuals living
with PD suggested that dance improves self-esteem
as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Score
and health-related quality of life as measured by the
PDQ-39 (Fig. 4) [74]. Most studies indicate using
group-based interventions, rather than a personal-
ized approach. Most studies included a control group,
which either received usual care, a non-exercise inter-
vention such as education, passive music appreciation
or support groups, or a non-dance physical activity
such as stretching or physiotherapy [37, 78].

Upcoming research: Recently, there has been an
increased interest in online delivery of dance ther-
apy, shown to be feasible and to enhance accessibility
[82–84]. Safety measures, including home safety
checklists and pre-intervention screenings, have been
employed [82]. However, studies have not systemati-
cally included individuals with advanced PD, varying
digital literacy, or other barriers to using the internet
[85]. Several research groups have evaluated the fea-
sibility of using wearable sensors or accelerometry to
measure objective outcomes of movement or dance
in trials [68, 86].

Examples of community-based projects:
In
Canada, Dancing with Parkinson’s offers free daily
online dance classes as well as in-person dance
classes [87]. Dance for PD® offers in-person dance
classes in various parts of the USA and the world, as
well as online options [88].

Drama

Types of drama interventions: As per the North
American Drama Therapy Association, “drama ther-
apy is the intentional use of drama and/or theater to
achieve therapeutic goals” [89]. Typical theatre train-
ing sessions are described in Modugno et al. [90, 91]
and Mirabella et al. [90, 91]. Individuals delve into
their personal life experiences by employing acting
and creativity, and they assume the roles of charac-
ters, utilizing storytelling to convey their narratives
from within these personas [92]. This review encom-
passes various forms of drama-based interventions
for PD found in the literature.

Proposed mechanisms: Although the mechanism
is unclear in PD, active theater requires a combi-
nation of movements, activation of various sensory
pathways, expression of emotions, and social inter-
actions necessary to form a dialogue or story [90, 91].
It also involves aspects such as visualization, use of
imagery, and nonverbal communication (Fig. 4). It is
unclear which aspects are predominantly driving the
potential beneﬁt derived from theater in PD, as the
number of studies to date are limited and have only
been compared to physiotherapy.

Evidence from prior studies: In a pilot randomized
trial with 20 individuals with PD, Modugno et al. [90]
reported that those in the theater arm, compared to
physiotherapy, had improved non-motor symptoms
based on various scales, including the Schwab and
England scale, PDQ-39, Epworth Sleepiness Scale,
and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, as well as
improved motor scores on the UPDRS, albeit to a
lesser extent. In a subsequent pilot non-randomized
study with 24 individuals with PD, the same group
found that theater was associated with improved emo-
tional well-being compared to physiotherapy, but
there was no signiﬁcant improvement in motor symp-
toms or cognition [91]. A small study conducted in
Spain suggested a trend for improved depression in
individuals living with PD (Fig. 4) [93].

Upcoming research: To our knowledge, there are

no upcoming trials using these interventions.

Examples of community-based projects: The
CHEER > UP program is a drama therapy program
designed for individuals living with PD and care-
givers that uses techniques such as improv, humor,
mime, voice work, and skits [94]. A music and drama
therapy program is offered through Creative Arts for
Parkinson’s via Northwestern University’s Parkin-
son’s Disease and Movement Disorders Center in
Chicago, USA [95]. Resources about drama ther-

P. Gros et al. / Arts for Parkinson’s Disease

apy can be found on the North American Drama
Therapy Association website [89]. Initiatives for indi-
viduals living with PD by individuals living with PD
have emerged, such as Mime over Mind or Mime
over Matter [96, 97], which use mime as therapy for
PD.

Visual arts

Types of visual arts interventions: Visual arts
therapy uses the creation and exploration of visual
arts as an intervention to improve one’s well-being.
It may include, but
limited to, drawing,
is not
painting, sculpture, clay manipulation, photography,
digital art, mosaic, among many others (Fig. 4)
[98–101].

Proposed mechanisms: Although the mechanism
is unclear in PD, art therapy promotes sensory-
motor integration and hand-eye coordination [99].
It involves non-verbal visuospatial processing and
other cognitive areas such as memory and abstrac-
tion (Fig. 4) [99, 102]. The proposed mechanisms
behind artistic creativity are largely derived from the
study of artists, who frequently demonstrate height-
ened perceptual skills and attention to details. These
attributes correlate with advanced visual processing
and memory, crucial for realistic depictions in visual
arts. Their ﬂexibility in attention allows for seamless
switching between stimulus aspects, enhancing both
creative and technical abilities. The ideation phase
necessitates problem-solving and planning skills,
areas where artists excel. High ideational ﬂuency
and openness are prevalent among artists, fostering
the generation of diverse and original visual ideas.
The neurobiological underpinnings of creative drive
are linked to the brain’s reward circuits, particularly
dopaminergic pathways. In PD, pharmacotherapies
affecting these pathways may inadvertently mod-
ify artistic inclinations (Fig. 1). The ‘artistic brain’
encompasses regions involved in visuospatial pro-
cessing, global attention, memory, and complex task
planning, which are areas impacted by neuropathol-
ogy in PD. The mesolimbic reward system’s role
in emotional responses to art suggests a therapeutic
mechanism, where artistic engagement may elevate
dopamine levels and interact beneﬁcially with motor
pathways.

Evidence from prior studies: Cucca et al. [103]
conducted a prospective exploratory observational
study of 18 individuals with PD undergoing 20
sessions of art therapy, compared to healthy age-
matched controls at baseline. Art therapy included

clay manipulation, painting on canvas, collage, draw-
ing, and ﬁgurative arts. Results indicated improved
visual exploration and visuospatial function, based on
improved fMRI visual connectivity networks mark-
ers and eye-tracking tests, as well as improved motor
function measured by the UPDRS III. A study of 54
individuals living with PD showed that clay-based art
therapy plus rehabilitation versus rehabilitation alone
was associated with improvement in hand dexter-
ity, self-expression, mood, depression, and quality of
life (Fig. 4) [98]. Clay art requires three dimensional
visuospatial processing and increased sensorimotor
integration given the tactile aspect [98]. Passive art
viewing, though less studied, is thought to inﬂuence
mental health and cognition in the elderly, but limited
data exists in PD [104].

Upcoming research: From 2022 onwards, a 5-year
international European collaboration between Aus-
tria and the Netherlands called “Unlocking the Muse:
Transdisciplinary Approaches to Understanding and
Applying the Intersection of Artistic Creativity and
Parkinson’s Disease”, has been ongoing, with a focus
on addressing visual art as intervention tools for peo-
ple with PD [105].

Examples of community-based projects: Vari-
ous PD-related community organizations offer local
information about visual arts therapy and art therapy
in general [106]. Further information about art ther-
apy and a repertoire of art therapists can be found on
the American Art Therapy Association website [107].
Moreover, there are also webpages showing visual art
from people with PD, speciﬁcally a ﬁlm about pasta
art [108], and also some ﬁlm-productions, initiated by
Filmwerk Films and ﬁlmmaker Bettina Rotzetter in
cooperation with the Inselspital Bern in Switzerland
[109, 110].

Creative writing

Types of creating writing interventions: Creative
writing is the use of ﬁctional or non-ﬁctional writing
for personal expression and communication [111].
It may take many forms including journaling, auto-
biographies, poetry, short stories, and novels (Fig. 4).
Proposed mechanisms: Although the mecha-
nism is unclear in PD, creative writing encourages
It
reﬂection,
may also help individuals cope with emotions
(Fig. 4).

introspection, and self-expression.

Evidence from prior studies: No major studies
have been performed in PD. A randomized study
of 40 individuals with depression compared expres-

S166

P. Gros et al. / Arts for Parkinson’s Disease

sive writing workshops with non-emotional writing
as control. The expressive writing group demon-
strated improvement in depression as measured by
the Beck Depression Inventory and Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 scores [112]. Creative writing may
also improve mood in cancer patients, although not
on all outcome measures (Fig. 4) [113].

Upcoming research: There is no upcoming
research using these interventions to our knowledge.
Example of community-based projects: Multiple
PD associations provide tools on creative writing.
Parkinson Europe, Parkinson’s UK, and Parkinson
Society British Columbia offer advice on how indi-
viduals living with PD can get started on creative
writing and comment on the potential beneﬁts of this
activity [114–116].

DISCUSSION

Findings and limitations of the research to date

Arts-based interventions have the potential to offer
a holistic approach to manage various motor and
non-motor symptoms of PD while also addressing
self-esteem, fostering problem-solving, and enhanc-
ing overall well-being. Analogous to phase 1 or 2a
drug trials, studies to date provide evidence to sug-
gest signiﬁcant potential and adequate safety. Small
sample sizes, usually under 100 participants, may
have led to underpowered studies [26, 37]. Larger
and more rigorous studies (i.e., analogous to phase
2b or 3 drug trials) are needed to make more deﬁni-
tive conclusions. Our review highlights a need for
well-designed research to determine efﬁcacy, optimal
dosage, and symptom-speciﬁc beneﬁts. In addition,
decisions on supervision, whether by any artists or
speciﬁcally trained art therapists, remain unresolved
to this date. Given the potential positive impact on
individuals with PD, further research is necessary for
systematic inclusion in therapeutic plans.

Challenges of trial designs with arts-based
interventions

Dose, duration, and adherence to the inter-
vention: Future studies need to explore optimal
intervention doses and duration (intermittent versus
lifelong engagement). While clinical trials testing
pharmacological interventions offer apparent uni-
formity across treatment arms (e.g., swallowing a
pill), arts-based interventions rely to a greater extent

on active participant engagement, thus posing chal-
lenges for standardization. For example, the degree
of physical exertion during a dance class depends on
the individual’s efforts. To our knowledge, previous
studies did not account for this. Wearables for objec-
tive measurement in dance interventions are gaining
interest but are not widely used to measure inter-
vention dose and adherence [68]. Another important
element is the duration of the intervention. This con-
cerns both the potential effectiveness, which may
necessitate extended exposure to the art intervention,
and adherence issues, potentially difﬁcult for long-
term interventions in a progressive condition like PD
which is associated with ongoing new challenges for
individuals.

Control groups: The selection of an appropriate
control group for arts-based intervention trials is not
always straightforward and should be carefully con-
sidered based on the hypothesis and research question
that each study aims to answer. Selection will depend
on the type of trials being designed; for example,
“pragmatic” or “explanatory”. In pragmatic trials, the
goal is to test the intervention in real-life routine prac-
tice settings. In contrast, explanatory trials aim to test
the intervention under ideal conditions (i.e., “if and
how an intervention works”[117]). Thus, it is com-
mon for pragmatic trials to include “usual care” as
control groups (i.e., compare intervention versus no
intervention) whereas explanatory trials may choose
placebo or active controls in an attempt to elimi-
nate important confounders [118]. We propose that
there is value in comparing art-based interventions
to usual care ﬁrst to determine their additional ben-
eﬁts beyond the existing PD interventions used in
current clinical practice. We argue that it may not be
crucial to fully understand the speciﬁc component of
the intervention that is responsible for the observed
beneﬁts until we have evidence that the intervention
is associated with some measurable beneﬁt. While
pragmatic trials may not initially differentiate art-
speciﬁc mechanisms from generic effects, such as
those associated with social activities, subsequent
research could address this in explanatory trials if
warranted. In these trials, the control could be an
activity requiring social engagement but without a
creative component (e.g., support group) or an alter-
native creative activity engaging a different domain
(e.g., dance versus visual arts). Another approach is
to compare various intensities of the same art-based
intervention. In the pharmacological world, platform
trials have emerged as a judicious way to test multi-

ple drugs simultaneously with a single control group,
and similar trials for arts-based interventions could
be considered in the future to facilitate explanatory
trials [119].

Outcome measures: The variability in ﬁndings
from arts-based intervention trials is due, in part, to
the lack of consistency in outcome measures across
studies. One approach to address this issue is to estab-
lish a standardized, minimal set of core outcome
measures. The MDS-UPDRS is currently the most
commonly used scale for outcome measures in clini-
cal trials. However, the MDS-UPDRS does not assess
several outcomes, such as quality of life, stigma,
loneliness, self-esteem, emotional well-being, inter-
personal relations, which are often of high relevance
in arts-based interventions. Measuring these addi-
tional outcomes is essential to understand and capture
the multifaceted impact of creative activities. Thus,
the unique dimensions impacted by arts-based inter-
ventions would need to be considered during the
development of a set of core outcome measures. This
approach will ensure a holistic evaluation of the inter-
ventions’ effectiveness. Further, if a standardized set
of core outcomes is employed by all studies, this will
facilitate comparative analysis across trials.

Personalizing the intervention: Personalized pre-
cision medicine is rapidly advancing in medicine,
and we believe it is crucial for arts-based interven-
tions. Most of the art-based therapy studies to date
used a “one-size-ﬁts-all” group approach and lacked
individualization. Instead, we think that personal-
izing of art interventions is necessary, given that
the production, perception, and appreciation of art
is a highly individual experience. These interven-
tions should be tailored to individual preferences
and abilities. Although this poses challenges for
future study designs, examples exist in the ﬁeld of
physiotherapy. For instance, PDSAFE, a personal-
ized physiotherapy intervention for falls prevention
in PD, used a customized approach to the speciﬁc
fall mechanism and the participant’s functional pre-
sentation. Although this approach did not reduce
falls (primary outcome), it improved balance, func-
tional strength, and reduced near falls (secondary
outcomes) [120, 121]. With this type of personalized
medicine, individuals with PD could choose tailored
art interventions, thus potentially enhancing adher-
ence and efﬁcacy. Although personalized delivery of
these interventions may negate the need for rigid pro-
tocols, guidelines speciﬁc to PD individuals would be
valuable.

Limitations of this review

tap dancing). Thirdly,

Firstly, certain articles might have been over-
looked since this is a non-systematic literature review.
Secondly, we acknowledge that, by broadly cover-
ing multiple arts-based interventions, we provided
limited discussion about certain promising art inter-
ventions, such as speciﬁc visual arts categories (e.g.,
painting, sculpture) or diverse dance types (e.g.,
the descriptions of
tango,
upcoming research and community-based projects
may be biased towards North American and Euro-
pean initiatives due to the authors’ locations. Lastly,
we recognize the possibility of missing important ini-
tiatives on other continents and encourage readers to
share with us updates on studies and initiatives not
covered. This review primarily aims to inspire clini-
cians, researchers, and individuals with PD and their
caregivers, serving as a call to action for further focus
and research.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we provided a qualitative review
of art-based interventions for individuals with PD,
covering music, dance, drama, visual arts, and cre-
ative writing. These interventions show potential in
enhancing both motor and non-motor symptoms,
contributing to emotional, cognitive well-being, and
overall quality of life. A unique feature of arts-based
interventions is their adaptability to individuals’ spe-
ciﬁc needs, including existential aspects, fostering
empowerment in dealing with PD. However, the het-
erogeneity and varying research quality limit ﬁrm
conclusions and strong recommendations. Future
studies should employ larger sample sizes and well-
chosen control groups to enhance the reliability of the
ﬁndings.
