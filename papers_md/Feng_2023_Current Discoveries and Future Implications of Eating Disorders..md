Abstract: Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by severe disturbances in eating behaviors and can
sometimes be fatal. Eating disorders are also associated with distressing thoughts and emotions. They
can be severe conditions affecting physical, psychological, and social functions. Preoccupation with
food, body weight, and shape may also play an important role in the regulation of eating disorders.
Common eating disorders have three major types: anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and
binge eating disorder (BED). In some cases, EDs can have serious consequences for an individual’s
physical and mental health. These disorders often develop during adolescence or early adulthood
and affect both males and females, although they are more commonly diagnosed in young adult
females. Treatment for EDs typically involves a combination of therapy, nutrition counseling, and
medical care. In this narrative review, the authors summarized what is known of EDs and discussed
the future directions that may be worth exploring in this emerging area.

1. Introduction

Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses marked by dysfunctional eating
behaviors and distorted body image [1]. Seven different eating disorders are identiﬁed in
the list of international disease classiﬁcation systems. These EDs include the well-known
anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED) (Figure 1),
and three other disorders: rumination disorder, pica, and avoidant food intake disorder.
Some otherwise speciﬁed feeding or eating disorders are listed in another category [2].
Worldwide, the three most frequent eating disorders in humans are AN, BN, and BED [3,4].
AN is deﬁned as disturbing experiences of weight or size, inappropriate inﬂuence of size
and weight on self-assessment, or persistent lack of awareness of the seriousness of current
low body weight [3]. BN is deﬁned by repeated and inappropriate compensatory behaviors
to avoid weight gain [5]. BED is delineated by eating more food in short time periods than
most people would eat in similar time periods and in similar circumstances [3,6]. Most
people affected by these eating disorders are young women in Western countries, suggesting
that the existence of sex-related problems in the etiology of EDs is irrefutable [7]. The studies
have shown that, although data regarding the incidence of EDs on the community level
are limited, the broad occurrence of AN among women might be 1–4%, and 1–2% for BN
and BED [1].

More than ﬁfty years of records on EDs show that less than ﬁfty percent of patients
experience complete remission, about thirty percent experience residual symptoms, and
twenty percent develop chronic disease [8]. Additionally, pressure from families and medi-
cal staff further exacerbates concerns about body image and food [9]. The Lancet Psychiatry
Committee’s recent synthesis report stated that people with mental disorders will have
signiﬁcantly higher chances of developing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome and

close to two times increased risk of metabolic disease compared with individuals not diag-
nosed with mental disorders [10]. Eating disorders are complex disorders with increasing
prevalence and are a physical and mental health concern [11]. Many genetic, environmental,
and social factors lead to the development of eating disorders. Biological risk factors for
eating disorders include genetic factors and the psychological element of an eating disorder
that coincides with a diagnosis of another disorder. Environmental factors include the
dynamics surrounding the individual, which may consist of family dynamics.

This review aims to summarize and discuss the current discoveries and future direction
of three different eating disorders, AN, BN, and BED. By gathering and analyzing the most
recent research and clinical evidence, this review can provide a comprehensive overview of
the current state of understanding on eating disorders. It will increase public awareness
and understanding of the importance of etiology and management of eating disorders.
Clinicians and researchers can use the information provided in this narrative review to
improve their understanding of eating disorders and develop more effective treatment
strategies. In conclusion, this review can be an important tool for clinicians, researchers,
and the general public in improving their understanding and treatment of these complex
eating disorders.

2. Methods

A rapid scoping review focused on eating disorders was conducted. The deﬁnition
adopted here was to map the existing literature to determine the volume and coverage of
the topic, ascertain the types of literature available, and identify the gaps in the current
eating disorder research. The authors searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases using
keywords such as “eating disorders,” “anorexia nervosa,” “bulimia nervosa,” “binge eating
disorder,” and “treatments” and included studies published in English between 2000 and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, x  2 of 16   will have significantly higher chances of developing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syn-drome and close to two times increased risk of metabolic disease compared with individ-uals not diagnosed with mental disorders [10]. Eating disorders are complex disorders with increasing prevalence and are a physical and mental health concern [11]. Many ge-netic, environmental, and social factors lead to the development of eating disorders. Bio-logical risk factors for eating disorders include genetic factors and the psychological ele-ment of an eating disorder that coincides with a diagnosis of another disorder. Environ-mental factors include the dynamics surrounding the individual, which may consist of family dynamics.  Figure 1.

2023 that focused on eating disorders. The authors present the ﬁndings on eating disorders
in tables, ﬁgures, and narrative summaries. This narrative review was reported following
the PRISMA Scoping Reviews’ (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist.

3. Current Discoveries of Eating Disorders
3.1. Anorexia Nervosa (AN)

AN is an eating disorder that is characterized by strict restrictions of food intake,
leading to abnormally low body weight and an intense fear of gaining weight [12]. While
past epidemiological studies have focused on young women in Western countries, anorexia
nervosa has been reported in men and women of all ages worldwide. This eating disorder
may increase the risk of death ﬁvefold or more [5]. AN is seen as a result of its psychological
proﬁle: the drive toward thinness and physical dissatisfaction. AN shows signiﬁcant
heritability as family studies have shown a substantial prevalence of AN in the ﬁrst-degree
relatives of a proband, who are about 11 times more likely to develop AN than controls [13].
Many concepts have been suggested by different scientists to explain and understand how
AN is developed and maintained [14].

AN results in a notable reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) in approximately
40% of patients and a three times increased lifetime fracture risk [12]. Another noticeable
skeletal phenotype concerning anorexia is the increased number and size of bone mar-
row adipocytes despite a lipodystrophic response. Clinically, there is a general negative
correlation between BMD and bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT). Unique fat depots
are of particular interest in AN study [12]. Bone health in adolescents with AN has been
extensively reviewed [15]. It is reported that non-stress fractures are more common in
women with AN and stress fractures are more common in oligomenorrhea athletes with
AN [16].

AN is an eating disorder characterized by chronic energy deprivation leading to
suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis owing to decreased
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, as observed in functional hypothala-
mic amenorrhea (FHA) [13]. Common variants of neurotrophic signaling genes, includ-
ing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NTRK2, and NTRK3, appear to lead to
receptivity to eating disorders [17]. Given the close association between FHA and AN
and the evidence that food restriction is one of the major risk factors for the development
of FHA, it can be hypothesized that genetic variants involved in satiety, appetite, and
weight regulation may be responsible for the physical and/or psychological effects, as
well as the differential response to stressors and the consequent suppression of the FPG
axis [13].

AN is associated with neuroendocrine and immune system abnormalities. For exam-
ple, leptin, an essential appetite modulator involved in AN development, also regulates
immune responses through microglia-induced inﬂammation by increasing the expres-
sion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b) [18]. Additionally,
activity-based anorexia (ABA), an AN model in rodents, reduces cortical astrocyte density,
suggesting that astrocyte loss and subsequent neuroinﬂammation may be involved in the
neurobiology of anorexia [19,20]. Astrocytes may participate in eating disorders through
their regulation of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which are known
to play a role in the regulation of appetite and food intake. Astrocytes can regulate these
neurotransmitters by taking up dopamine or serotonin and releasing it if necessary. Astro-
cytes can also modulate the activity of the dopamine neurons or serotonin neurons that
produce them. Conversely, restoring glia-mediated neuroinﬂammation has been shown
to increase glutamate transporter expression and ameliorate diet-induced anorexia (DIA)
and ABA vulnerability in rodents [21]. Based on evidence from mouse models of anorexia
nervosa, glial cells have been suggested as potential therapeutic targets for AN [19,20,22].
Some other therapeutic targets that focused on neurons were also reported. A recent study
that focused on dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) neurons revealed that feeding be-
havior is regulated by intensity-dependent interactions between 5-HT neurons and DA,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6325

which could contribute to the pathophysiology of AN [23]. Hickey et. al. reported that
agouti-related peptide (AgRP) releasing neuron activity in ABA animals showed a poor
inhibitory response to food, independent of changes in basal activity [24]. AN may also be
conceptualized as a form of genetic resistance to hunger, thus allowing for a particularly
strong personal commitment to perpetuate food restriction [25]. High circulating leptin
concentrations indicate that a positive metabolic balance associated with endocrine changes
signiﬁcantly and rapidly improves several symptoms of anorexia, including increased
body agitation and the impulse to move. The proposed hypothesis is testable and could be
incorporated into the design of future double-blind placebo-controlled studies using leptin
as a treatment strategy in AN [26,27].

Both anxiety and depressive disorders may predispose human subjects to AN accord-
ing to epidemiological data and genome-wide association studies. Furthermore, genome-
wide association studies have shown that metabolic factors play a key role in AN [14]. Based
on current knowledge, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the gut microbiota–brain (GMB)
axis disturbance is the core pathology of AN, and that alterations in the gut microbiota
caused by malnutrition could be an early step in the pathogenesis of AN. Understanding
the effectiveness of interventions designed to restore normal regulation of eating behaviors
in patients with AN is critical [14].

In conclusion, AN has been an eating disorder epidemic in adolescent and adult
women worldwide for decades. AN requires more surveys and scholarly investigations
to allow us a more comprehensive understanding. Overall, there is still much we do not
understand about AN, and further research is required to improve our understanding of
the disorder and to develop more effective treatments. Future studies could also investigate
other neural mechanisms that will explain more unknowns in the ﬁeld of AN.

3.2. Bulimia Nervosa (BN)

In 1979, bulimia nervosa (BN) was ﬁrst described by British psychiatrist Gerald Russell
as a chronic phase of anorexia nervosa. BN is characterized by binge eating followed
by compensatory mechanisms including self-induced vomiting, prolonged starvation,
laxatives, etc. It was reported that the estimated lifetime prevalence of BN ranges between
about 0.3% and 1.6% according to the studies conducted in the USA [28]. A systematic
review reported a lifetime prevalence of 0.8% for BN. Females and young adults are more
prevalent in all eating disorders, with a female-to-male ratio between 3:1 and 8:1 [29,30].

BN is characterized by occasional binge eating and purging behavior. Neural processes
of self-regulation, gustatory reward, and body image are thought to be implicated in the
pathogenesis of BN. The study by Wang et al. showed that patients with BN exhibited
abnormal increases in multiple left nodes in the mesolimbic reward circuit, lateral temporo-
occipital cortex, precuneus, and right nodes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [31]. A
decrease in global efﬁciency was observed in cortical limbic circuits and somatosensory
and visuospatial systems. Several corticolimbic nodules were signiﬁcantly associated with
BN symptoms. Their study showed BN-related changes in prefrontal control, mesolim-
bic reward, somatosensory structures, and white matter connectivity in the visuospatial
system [32]. The aversive interoceptive experiences may be speciﬁcally associated with
the pathophysiology of BN because it is well documented that there is link between avoid-
ance of unpleasant physical sensations and BN symptoms. During aversive homeostatic
perturbations, excessive anticipatory responses and abnormally reduced responses have
been shown to promote hallmark binge eating behaviors such as overeating, dietary re-
striction, and purging [33]. Several studies give support for homeostatic instability in BN,
and these altered brain activation patterns may become new targets for pharmacology,
neuromodulators, and behavioral interventions [33].

When subjected to food stimulation, BN patients display less inhibitory control. Binge
eating can also be used for the diagnosis of BN in clinical studies. Thus, some appetite-
related hormones that regulate feeding behavior have also been extensively studied [34]. It
has been suggested that abnormal ghrelin responses to satiety may lead to binge eating

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6325

5 of 16

behaviors in patients with BN. Another hormone called leptin is produced by fat cells.
Leptin suppresses appetite and causes satiety. Many ﬁndings have shown that leptin
levels are signiﬁcantly lower in BN patients than in healthy controls [35,36]. In the acute
fasting and refeeding trials, plasma leptin levels were consistently signiﬁcantly lower in BN
patients than in healthy controls. Notably, fasting-induced reduction in circulating leptin
is also signiﬁcantly different, with 58% in healthy control women and only 7% in women
with BN. These studies suggest that ghrelin and leptin are important in the development
of BN, opening the door to further understanding of how appetite-related hormones
interact with BN [37]. Besides ghrelin and leptin, asprosin, a novel orexigenic adipokine,
may also contribute to the development of BN. Hu et al. ﬁrst reported plasma asprosin
concentrations in BN patients, and their study showed that overeating and uncontrolled
eating are associated with increasing asprosin concentrations. In addition, increases in
asprosin levels and increased depression may explain the increased frequency of loss of
control [37].

Further, some additional references have reported that a neurotransmitter can be used
in the treatment of BN. Mihov et al. presented the ﬁrst evidence for increased metabotropic
glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), which plays a vital role in addiction distribution-
to-volume ratio (DVR) in BN [38]. Their ﬁndings suggested that drugs that inhibit mGlu5
may have therapeutic potential for BN.

Subcortical shape abnormalities were examined in a large sample of adolescent and
adult BN patients by Berner et al.’s study [33]. Their ﬁndings suggested a link between
morphological changes in the basal ganglia structure and BN symptoms. This precise
localization of subcortical morphometric changes may ultimately aid in the identiﬁcation
of risk markers and BN persistence, which is the ﬁrst step in determining the trajectory of
BN or speciﬁc structural markers for maintenance from adolescence to adulthood [39,40].
BN is a severe mental illness with prospectively dangerous complications. Family
relationships play a critical role in the development or persistence of the condition. To gain
a better grasp of the role of food in family interactions among BN adolescents, Lecomte
et al. studied the dynamics of their families in contrast to those of adolescents with
anorexia nervosa. It conﬁrmed the need for a systemic approach beyond individual therapy
and the beneﬁts of establishing family interactions that do not involve food to rebuild
communication, including those with siblings [41].

It appears that changes in the microbiota modulate appetite regulation in patients with
BN. Unlike AN, BN is noticeably lacking in data. Although BN is also a life-threatening
disease, studies have assessed the part of the microbiome in BN that focused only on the
bacterial ClpB protein in patients and did not investigate differences in gut microbiota from
healthy control groups. Like AN, patients had higher plasma ClpB levels than in healthy
control groups. E. coli-produced ClpB can mimic α-MSH and stimulate autoimmune
responses. BN differs from AN in the switching of IgG autoantibody epitopes that form
immune complexes in BN patients [28,42].

Data proves that, except for BN, the prevalence of food addiction (FA) is higher
in binge eating disorders than in other EDs. People affected by eating disorders were
more likely to be addicted than those with bulimia, even though the results were not
statistically signiﬁcant. BN, FA, and BED have overlapping symptoms that may lead to
these outcomes. Several studies support the description of BN as an addiction-like eating
behavior, reinforcing the addictive nature of the disorder [43–45].

In summary, BN is a severe, potentially life-threatening eating disorder with less
known pathophysiology mechanisms. BN is hard to beat but effective treatment can help
individuals eat healthier, reverse serious complications, and feel better. More deep research
is needed to improve our understanding of BN and to develop more effective treatments
for the BN disorder.

3.3. Binge Eating Disorder (BED)

BED is described as the intake of lots of food in a short time, typically with a preference
for highly palatable foods, affecting about 5% of American adults [46]. It is unclear what
causes binge eating in humans, and there are limited effective treatments for BED patients.
In the development of BED in humans, impaired brain serotonin (5-HT) signaling has been
observed. For example, increased brain 5-HT re-uptake was found in binge eating patients,
thus lowering 5-HT content [47]. In addition, the role of the 5-HT precursor L-tryptophan
is signiﬁcantly diminished in binge eating patients, possibly because of dysfunction of the
5-HT receptor and/or tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2), the enzyme that synthesizes 5-HT
in the brain [48].

Binge eating is an important public health problem because of its close relation to
other medical and psychiatric disorders, especially obesity and depression. Developing
more effective binge eating treatments is an urgent need [46]. The neuronal matrix of binge
eating can sometimes contribute to obesity, but the mechanism is not yet known. Zhang
et. al. discovered [49] that optogenetic activation of immediate overeating was caused
by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their axonal projections to paraventricular
thalamic (PVT) excitatory neurons in the amorphous zone (ZI) of mice [50]. Minimal
intermittent stimulation of ZI GABA neurons resulted in weight gain, while ablation of
these neurons reduced weight. Additionally, stimulation of excitatory axons from the
hypothalamic nucleus to the paraventricular thalamic neurons or direct stimulation of
paraventricular thalamic glutamate neurons reduced food intake. Their data suggest that
ZI GABA neurons have unexpected orexigenic potential [49,51].

As the most diagnosed eating disorder, BED affects more than three times the number
of women than men. A gut-secreted hunger hormone called ghrelin is altered in BED. Prins
et al.’s research showed that ghrelin deﬁciency affects behavior and metabolism in binge
eating mice [52]. Ghrelin deﬁciency does not affect the development of BED; it will alter
the timing of food intake, motor activity, and metabolism. However, the interaction of
ghrelin and BED in different sexes has not been fully elucidated [52]. When overweight
human subjects were compared to normal weight subjects during and after the Trier
Social Stress Test (TSST), Micioni Di Bonaventura et al. found BED patients had increased
ghrelin levels [53]. The ghrelin system and ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) enzymes
are increasingly complex regulations involving food regulation, and hunger stimuli, food
choice, and obesity may play a key role in bulimia, triggering reinforcement mechanisms
associated with food rewards and impulsive behavior [53,54].

Dopamine is another peptide that may be involved in BED. Yu et al. reviewed some
important parameters of dopamine in BED animals and humans including dopamine recep-
tor availability/afﬁnity, dopamine activity, and dopamine modulator levels/activity [55].
While most studies supported these changes, the direction of the change is unclear. In
future studies, it will be beneﬁcial to carefully control for confounding variables. More
importantly, some vertical studies are needed to test if a transition from a dopaminergic to
a hypodopaminergic state occurs during BED development. If possible, researchers could
test whether genotype modulates the relationship between BED and dopamine [55].

Binge eating episodes, characterized by uncontrollable and painful consumption of
large amounts of palatable food, are the cardinal features of binge eating disorder. The
inﬂammatory markers are altered in discrete brain regions that could contribute to food
intake. Alboni et al. found that binge-like eating signiﬁcantly downregulated the IL-18 or
receptor system, as reﬂected by increased expression of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine IL18
inhibitor and reduced expression of the IL-18 binding chain 18 receptors, and increased
the expression of iNOS by threefold, particularly in the anterior tuberculous region of the
animals’ hypothalamus [56]. Their data suggest the therapeutic potential to centrally target
selected markers of inﬂammation to prevent the development of eating disorders.

BED is also very common in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients and is often
associated with higher BMI [57]. Studies have shown that up to 20% of people with T2DM
have an underlying BED. The prevalence of BED appears to be much higher in patients with

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6325

7 of 16

T2DM than the prevalence of 2% to 3.5% in the general population [58]. Researchers have
found medications that signiﬁcantly decrease the frequency of binge eating and overweight.
Abbott et al. demonstrated that a signiﬁcant proportion of adults with pre-existing T2DM
have clinical BED [57]. More studies are needed in exploring the importance of BED in
the treatment of T2DM and development of long-term diabetic complications. If health
providers are able to screen and diagnose eating disorders in human subjects in the early
stage, they could provide novel antidiabetic therapies for them [57].

Recent randomized controlled ﬁndings have suggested improvements not only in
overeating and purging episodes related to the diagnostic dimensions implicated in BED
but also in food-related emotional responses in terms of anxiety and food cravings [59,60].
Although BED is common and limited treatment options exist, recurrence rates after
treatment are often high. However, the neurobiological mechanism of BED is still less
understood [50]. Hildebrandt and Ahmari examined preclinical approaches by breaking
them down into two clinically signiﬁcant bulk food components: short-term food con-
sumption and loss of dietary control [50]. They suggested that the guidelines identify the
most common and effective methods for modeling components of BED behavior using
preclinical methods. How current preclinical models can be combined with techniques
using targeted neurobiological approaches are discussed in their work. They suggested
that proposed ways are needed to improve the translation of preclinical work into human
studies of BED to enhance understanding of BED behavior [50,61].

Obesity is a major global public health problem, and its prevalence has been steadily
increasing over the past few decades. The World Health Organization reported that more
than 1.9 billion adults worldwide are overweight, and more than 650 million of them are
obese. In addition, an estimated 41 million children under the age of ﬁve are overweight or
obese. It was reported that obesity is a major risk factor for premature mortality [62,63]. In
addition, obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing several chronic conditions
that can lead to premature death, such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and some
cancers [64,65]. Based on the scientiﬁc evidence presented so far, tailored comprehensive
multidisciplinary treatment is essential to provide adequate care for patients with obesity
and BED by addressing their overweight and its consequences. This interdisciplinary
approach should combine a structured lifestyle treatment plan with healthy meal planning,
PA, and behavioral interventions, according to a multidisciplinary team of experts [66,67].
They suggested that measurements for multidisciplinary interventions of adolescents with
BED should consider weight loss as well as behavioral and mental improvements. More
research should focus on the physical and mental effects of different forms of exercise [68,69].
Binge eating may be a behavior designed to reduce chronic stress resulting from repetitive
negative thinking focused on eating or not dependent on eating. Although clinical models
may partially support these hypotheses, further research is needed to directly test these
hypotheses [70–72].

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is currently the only drug approved by the FDA
for the treatment of BED [73]. Still, little is known about the behavioral mechanisms
underpinning the effect of LDX in the treatment of BED. Schneider et al. were the ﬁrst
to document the behavioral and neurological characteristics of the effects of a dose of
50 mg Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in binge eating women [74]. They found that LDX
has multiple effects on enhancing satiety, reducing responses related to food rewards, and
improving cognitive control. Their results underscored the potential effect of the thalamus
in mediating LDX to reduce appetite. This was achieved by altering the balance of extrinsic
and interoceptive control. These data support the conclusion that new drugs (such as
LDX) used for BED treatment may be most effective if their effects on satiety, reward,
and cognitive processes are combined [74,75]. Based on the current range of studies, new
drugs to treat BED are expeditiously needed. Heal et al. discussed the similarities in
the psychopathology of attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and BED, and
the pharmacology of drugs that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of both
disorders [76]. Drugs that enhance noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6325

8 of 16

and/or are effective in ADHD are the most promising areas for new treatments for BED,
analysis suggests. The lipid-derived messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA) acts through
central noradrenergic and oxytocinergic neurons to signal satiety that inhibits food intake.
A recent study investigated the anti-binge effects of OEA in a rat model of binge-like
eating. The results showed that systemically administered OEA prevents overeating in a
dose-dependent manner [77]. They provided evidence that OEA may be a new potential
pharmacological target for the treatment of binge eating behavior.

To summarize, BED is a severe mental illness worldwide. It is the most common eating
disorder in the USA and can have serious physical and mental consequences. Risk factors
for developing BED include a history of dieting, body dissatisfaction, and a family history
of eating disorders or other psychological health conditions. Antidepressant medications
may help reduce binge eating behaviors in some people with BED. However, more research
is needed to develop more effective treatments for BED with fewer side effects.

3.4. Treatments of Eating Disorders

Over the past 20 years, the eating disorders ﬁeld has made signiﬁcant progress in
successfully translating basic eating disorders risk factor research into preventive inter-
ventions with signiﬁcant potential to reduce its risk factors, symptoms, and future ED
episodes. Efﬁcacy has been documented in multiple randomized controlled trials [78,79].
Treatment for eating disorders often involves a combination of psychotherapy, medication,
and nutritional counseling (Table 1). Speciﬁcally, cognitive–behavioral therapy is a com-
mon form of psychotherapy that can help individuals with eating disorders change their
negative thought patterns and behaviors related to food and body image. Antidepressant
and antipsychotic medications may also be prescribed to help manage the emotional and
psychological symptoms of the disorder.

Short-term hospitalization [80–82].

Home-based therapy is the evidence-based
treatment for teenagers with anorexia [83,84].

Nutritional counseling: Nutritional counseling is
the main line of nutritional recovery and is
designed to teach anorexics about their body’s
need for food and essential nutrients [87–89].

Individual therapy: Anticipatory behavior therapy,
speciﬁcally augmentative cognitive–behavioral
therapy, contributes to adults [92,93].

Psychotherapy: Also called talk therapy, this type
of counseling can include cognitive–behavioral
therapy, family-based therapy, and interpersonal
psychotherapy [96–98].

There is no single effective drug approved for the
treatment of anorexia nervosa.

Anti-anxiety medications help anorectics to
comply with nutritional rehabilitation
programs [85,86].

Antipsychotics are also recommended in selected
AN patients, who are not to eat in spite of ongoing
anti-anxiety medications [90,91].

Altered regulation of the hormone leptin may play
role in the persistence of anorexia nervosa [94,95].

Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (including Celexa,
Lexapro, Prozac, and Zoloft) in combination with
psychological therapies, are now a mainstay in
bulimia therapy [99–101].

Dietitian support and nutritional education: A
nutritionist can design a meal plan to help develop
healthy eating habits [102],[103]].

No medications are approved to treat
bulimia nervosa.

episodes in individuals [104–106].

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is currently
the only drug approved by the FDA for the
treatment of binge eating disorder [73,74,107].

Interpersonal psychotherapy: It can help reduce
binge eating triggered by bad communication
abilities and relationships [108–110].

The act of dialectic behavior therapy: It reduces
the desire to overeat through studying behavioral
skills that can help regulate emotions and perfect
relationships with other people [114–116].

Weight loss drugs: Xenical, Contrave,
Qsymia, etc. [111–113].

Topiramate (Topamax), an anticonvulsant
antidepressant [117–120].

4. Discussion
4.1. Limitations of the Current Eating Disorders Research

In recent decades, there has been signiﬁcant progress achieved in eating disorder
research through both basic and clinical research. On the one hand, several animal models
have been developed for AN and BED. Research has also shown that there are biological
factors that contribute to the development of eating disorders. For instance, researchers
have found that individuals with anorexia nervosa have alterations in brain structure and
function, as well as abnormal levels of certain hormones and neurotransmitters. More
and more studies are focusing on prevention strategies for eating disorders. Body-positive
curricula are used for promoting a positive body image and preventing the development
of eating disorders. On the other hand, ongoing research is looking for more effective
treatments for eating disorders in humans. In addition to CBT, other treatments such as
family-based therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy have been shown to be effective for
certain types of eating disorders. More importantly, new treatments, such as virtual reality
therapy and medication have also been introduced for eating disorder treatment.

However, there are also some limitations to eating disorder research. For example,
there is no good animal model for AN, BN, or BED eating disorders in basic science research.
One reason could be that eating disorders are complex disorders that involve a merger
of biological, psychological, and social factors. Animal models are often limited in their
ability to capture the complexity of human behavior and psychology. Additionally, animal
models may not fully replicate the environmental and social factors that contribute to
the development of eating disorders in humans. Unlike human patients, animals cannot
report their own symptoms, which makes it difﬁcult to determine whether an animal is
experiencing an eating disorder. Furthermore, the deﬁnition and classiﬁcation of eating
disorders in humans have evolved over time, making it difﬁcult to establish a standardized
set of criteria for an animal model. In clinical research, the limitations include small sample
sizes, self-report biases, recruitment biases, and lack of diversity. More importantly, the
underlying mechanisms of eating disorders are still unknown. This gap makes it very
hard to move clinical research forward in a short time. While signiﬁcant progress has been
made in understanding the neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors that
contribute to eating disorders, there is still not much we know. Further research is needed
to better understand the underlying mechanisms of eating disorders and to develop more
effective treatments.

4.2. Future Direction of Eating Disorder Research

Considering the refractory nature of ED and the lack of evidence-based treatment, there
is an urgent need to identify new approaches. The noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor antagonist ketamine, recently approved for treatment-resistant depression, has
rapid and potent antidepressant effects [3]. The evidence presented by Ragnhildstveit et al.
provides a conceptual but succinct summary of the use of ketamine for the treatment of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6325

10 of 16

ED [8]. Ketamine may provide the greatest utility in clinically unresponsive individuals
who are resistant to the psychological, dietary, and pharmacological interventions used in
standard practice and are prone to long-term ED disorders. Further studies are needed
to explore the efﬁcacy of ketamine on ED and its psychopathology, especially in terms of
different subgroups, types of diagnostic dependency severity, and lifespan. These data
can then be used to build safety proﬁles, optimize dosing, and provide targeted treatment
strategies at the individual patient level [3].

More research is needed to discover the genetic component of eating disorders, as it is
genetically linked to immune system dysfunction, which can have serious repercussions.
Certain groups of people appear to be particularly susceptible to eating disorders; however,
all people affected by this disorder experience severe physical manifestations. Although
numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the adverse effects of eating disor-
ders, more studies are needed to better understand the long-term effects and address the
appropriate treatment of eating disorders [121]. Future research could focus on identifying
speciﬁc genetic factors affecting the development of eating disorders, as well as exploring
the interaction between genetics and environmental factors.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which is associated with social restrictions, has profoundly
affected people’s psychological health. It can be hypothesized that the symptomatic behav-
ior and psychological health of eating disorder patients deteriorated during this period.
Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether increased depression or
anxiety contributes to ED symptoms, or whether patients with existing mental illness use
unhealthy eating behaviors as a response mechanism in the absence of a sense of control.
This question has important implications for understanding how severe psychosocial stress
affects ED symptoms in the entire population. An understanding of the mechanisms as-
sociated with dietary habits will guide us to make more targeted and empowered public
health decisions to manage ED. In addition, methods to improve online therapy in the
future should also be introduced [122]. The study by Gorrell et al. provides an overview of
research focused on teletherapy in EDs, with a particular focus on how the COVID-19 pan-
demic has affected interest and job demand in the ﬁeld [123]. Overall, larger randomized
designs are needed.

Last but not least, future research could focus on developing and testing new treat-
ments, including pharmacological, behavioral, and psychosocial interventions. It is critical
to develop more new treatments for eating disorders, as most of the current treatments are
not always effective for every patient. For example, researchers may develop some new
medications that modulate the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin or dopamine.
Researchers could also investigate the potential use of medications that regulate hormones
such as ghrelin or leptin, which are involved in appetite regulation. More importantly,
newer forms of CBT, such as enhanced CBT (ECBT), may be more effective than traditional
CBT for some individuals with eating disorders.

5. Conclusions

This narrative review aims to summarize the current discoveries and progress on
three different eating disorders: AN, BN, and BED. Current research on eating disorders
has uncovered many important ﬁndings, including the causes, risk factors, and effective
treatments for these complex mental health conditions. For example, eating disorders have
multiple causes, including biological factors such as genetics and brain chemistry, mental
factors such as body image and self-esteem, and social factors, for instance, societal pressure
to lose weight and cultural messages about body shape and size. Early intervention and
treatment for eating disorders will achieve better outcomes and reduce the risk of chronic
health problems and relapse. Proper medications (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, and
mood stabilizers) can be helpful for the treatment of BN and BED.

Recent research on eating disorders has highlighted the complexity of these conditions
including the signiﬁcance of early period intervention measures in treatment, the role of
genetics and social factors, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eating disorders

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6325

are associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including malnutrition, heart
problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Eating disorder prevalence is increasing worldwide,
with more individuals being diagnosed each year. It is important for people with eating
disorders to seek professional help and for society to continue to raise awareness and
provide support for those affected by these conditions.

In conclusion, eating disorders are severe mental conditions that can have serious
impacts on an individual’s physical and mental health. The current discoveries on eating
disorders suggest that these are complicated psychological health conditions that are
inﬂuenced by a range of genetic, environmental, and psychosocial factors. Published
references indicate that eating disorders affect people of all ages, genders, and cultural
backgrounds. Although the exact cause of these disorders is not completely understood,
a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors is thought to play a
role. There are several effective treatments for eating disorders, including psychotherapy,
medication, and nutrition counseling, but not all individuals respond equally well to
these interventions. Early intervention is key in treating eating disorders, as the longer an
individual goes without treatment, the more difﬁcult it can be to achieve full recovery.

Overall, current discoveries on eating disorders suggest the need for continued re-
search into the underlying causes, risk factors, and effective treatments for these complex
mental health conditions. With continued research, it is hoped that individuals with eating
disorders will receive the support and care they need to achieve a full recovery.
