Abstract

This chapter reviews the relationship between stress and brain function in patients with 
neuropsychiatric disorders, with an emphasis on disorders that have most clearly been linked to 
traumatic stress exposure. These disorders, which have been described as trauma spectrum 
disorders, include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a subgroup of major depression, 
borderline personality disorder (BPD) and dissociative disorders; they share in common a 
neurobiological footprint, including smaller hippocampal volume, and are distinguished from 
other disorders that may share symptom similarities, like some of the anxiety disorders, but are not 
as clearly linked to stress. The relationship between environmental events such as stressors, 
especially in early childhood, and their effects on brain and neurobiology is important to 
understand in approaching these disorders as well as the development of therapeutic interventions. 
Addressing patients with stress-related disorders from multiple developmental (age at onset of 
trauma) as well as levels of analysis (cognitive, cultural, neurobiological) approaches will provide 
the most complete picture and result in the most successful treatment outcomes.

1.  Lasting effects of traumatic stress

Traumatic stress can have lasting effects on the individual. Brain and physiological systems 
that helped us survive when we were wandering in small bands on the savannah are no 
longer as necessary in modern times. A sympathetic nervous system that allowed us to 
respond a split second faster to a predator even at the expense of long-term exaggerated 
responsiveness was favored in terms of survival and passing on genes to the next generation. 
Today, a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system may impair our ability to perform 
mundane office-based tasks with no real added value in a world essentially devoid of 
predators. The task of those in the mental health field is to optimize the health of our 
patients, which includes adjustment for the potentially crippling effects of neurobiological 
systems that previously were essential for survival but now may have detrimental effects.

Physiological response systems involved in survival underlie the pathophysiology of stress-
related psychiatric disorders. Neural and physiological systems make us react quickly, fight 
back or run away. These stress response systems are preserved even when they are no longer 
as valuable. Reactions that once may have prevented death from an attack of a predator now 
simply make it impossible to function in daily life. Repeated episodes of stress lead to

increased responsivity of these systems. This may have been useful in previous times, for 
example, the body shifting to an increased chronic presence of a band of lions in the region. 
In the modern age, stress can lead to psychiatric disorders with resultant pathology. We 
review here the relationship between stress, brain and physiology, and neuropsychiatric 
disorders. We focus on disorders with a clear link to stress, that have been described 
elsewhere as Trauma Spectrum Disorders (Bremner, 2002a). Those disorders include 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a subgroup of major depression, Borderline 
Personality Disorder (BPD), and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). With the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual (DSM)-5, PTSD was moved from the category of Anxiety Disorders 
to Trauma- and Stressor-related Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). 
Included in this category is Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), which is seen as an early form of 
PTSD as opposed to a unique disorder (Bremner, 1999). Other disorders in this category 
include Adjustment Disorders, which have not been the subject of extensive research, and 
childhood attachment disorders that are beyond the scope of the current review. 
Neurobiological studies have shown that the other anxiety disorders, including Panic 
Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, in addition to 
lacking the clear link to stress, do not have the same neurobiological profile as the Trauma 
Spectrum Disorders (Bremner, 2002a; Heim, Bremner, & Nemeroff, 2006). These disorders 
are therefore not considered in detail here.

2.  Trauma spectrum disorders

The model of Trauma Spectrum Disorders posits that a group of psychiatric disorders related 
to psychological trauma, usually in childhood, share an underlying neurobiological footprint 
(Bremner, 1999, 2002a, 2016). Although there is often symptom overlap, a common cause, 
such as childhood trauma, can lead to multiple outcomes, illustrating the principle of 
multifinality (Fig. 1) (Cicchetti & Rogosch, 1996). The differences in outcomes, which may 
be related to genetic, cultural, or concomitant environmental factors, can often be quite 
striking. For instance, patients with trauma spectrum disorders share a common 
neurobiological footprint in smaller volume of a brain area involved in memory called the 
hippocampus, although they will show differing physiological responses to different stimuli 
depending on the nature of their specific psychiatric disorder.

In the trauma spectrum disorders model, patients with PTSD, BPD, DID and a subgroup of 
depression share common changes in brain and neurobiology that underlie the symptoms of 
these disorders. Although these are separate disorders, they also share a high degree of 
symptom overlap, and are often co-morbid with one another (Fig. 1), a fact that is not 
surprising given their overlapping neurobiological correlates (Bremner, 2002a, 2016). The 
DSM, the modern Bible of Psychiatry, was based on the medical disease model, and treats 
mental disorders as discrete entities (Bremner, 2006), forcing the use of terms like “high co-
morbidity” to account for the overlapping nature of these disorders. The use of this term 
implies that these are discreet disorders, and their overlapping nature is an anomaly. The 
DSM attempts to side-step these issues by describing the same phenomena using differing 
terminology. For instance, psychomotor retardation and loss of interest in things you used to 
enjoy in major depression and feeling cut off from others and loss of pleasure in PTSD are 
all aspects of anhedonia that likely share altered function in mesocortical and mesolimbic

dopamine pathways. Other symptoms are identical, like sleep disturbance and irritability. 
The utility of a model lies in its ability to predict and describe phenomena, therefore the 
trauma spectrum model is superior to the medical model in describing stress-related mental 
disorders as it more accurately describes these disorders as they actually exist in clinical 
practice and correctly predicts future behaviors. This likely accounts for the sparse use of 
DSM by clinicians engaged in actual clinical practice, outside of compliance with 
bureaucratic requirements.

The trauma spectrum model also has relevance on a neurobiological level. The model 
predicts that brain circuits and systems involved in the stress response and fear memory will 
be affected in these disorders, and that they will share a similar neurobiological footprint. A 
priori we identified a network of brain areas based on animal studies, a knowledge of 
functional neuroanatomy and findings from patients with specific neurological deficits, that 
were likely involved in the trauma spectrum disorders (Bremner, Krystal, Southwick, & 
Charney, 1995). These included the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and medial 
prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate). Close to a decade of research later, brain imaging 
studies in patients with PTSD and other stress-related psychiatric disorders corroborated the 
initial hypotheses (Bremner, 2003), and another decade of research replicated those initial 
studies (Campanella & Bremner, 2016). Neurohormonal systems like cortisol and 
norepinephrine also show similar alterations stress-related psychiatric disorders (Heim et al., 
2006).

Hippocampal volume has been a particularly useful marker of the trauma spectrum disorders 
(Bremner & Vermetten, 2012). The hippocampus is sensitive to stress and plays a key role in 
declarative memory (Bremner & Vermetten, 2012). In a series of studies we and others 
showed smaller hippocampal volume as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
in patients with a history of childhood abuse and the diagnoses of PTSD (Bremner, Randall, 
et al., 1995), women with BPD and early life trauma (Driessen et al., 2000; Irle, Lange, & 
Sachsse, 2005; Schmahl, Vermetten, Elzinga, & Bremner, 2003), and women with abuse and 
DID (Vermetten, Schmahl, Lindner, Loewenstein, & Bremner, 2006). Women with early 
childhood sexual abuse and depression had smaller hippocampal volume compared to 
women with depression without early abuse, and non-abused non-depressed women 
(Vythilingam et al., 2002). Smaller hippocampal volume was not seen in patients with 
anxiety disorders, including panic disorder (Vythilingam et al., 2000), obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD) or other anxiety disorders (Bremner, 2005a; Cannistraro & Rauch, 2003). 
These studies show a common correlate of stress-related mental disorders in a brain area 
known to be sensitive to stress that is specific to these disorders.

The amygdala is involved in the encoding of fear memories and also plays a role in some 
symptoms of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Women with abuse and BPD (Driessen et 
al., 2000; Schmahl, Vermetten, et al., 2003) and women with abuse and DID (Vermetten et 
al., 2006) showed smaller amygdala volume on MRI, which is seen in some studies of PTSD 
but not others (Bremner & Vermetten, 2012; Campanella & Bremner, 2016). Other 
neurobiological overlaps between PTSD and BPD associated with childhood abuse include 
alterations in function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and dysregulation of 
the prefrontal-limbic axis (Donegan et al., 2003; Driessen et al., 2004; Juengling et al., 2003;

Elzinga, et al., 2003; Schmahl, McGlashan, & Bremner, 2002; Schmahl, Vermetten, Elzinga, 
& Bremner, 2004). In summary, findings are consistent with a common neurobiology and 
neurocircuitry underlying the trauma spectrum disorders, including PTSD, DID, BPD, and 
depression related to early abuse.

3.  Psychologic trauma at various levels of development

A proper understanding of the effects of psychological trauma on neurobiology and the 
individual requires a knowledge of the developmental epoch at which the trauma occurred 
(Bremner, 2006, 2016). As the individual progresses through development from infancy to 
young adulthood and possibly moves from one physical and cultural environment to the 
next, changes are taking place on a neurological, social, individual, psychological, and 
cultural level (Feiring & Lewis, 1996). Some might start at different points with pathways 
that lead them to the same place (equifinality), or travel the same path with different ultimate 
outcomes (multipotentiality) (Cicchetti & Dawson, 2002; Cicchetti & Rogosch, 1996). The 
same childhood trauma may lead to two different outcomes, with one individual showing 
resilience and overcoming and perhaps thriving in spite of their environment while others 
succumb to psychopathology and dysfunction (Vythilingam et al., 2009). Childhood trauma 
is associated with an increase in risk for injected drug use (Anda et al., 2006; Dube et al., 
2003), although not all patients with Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) have a history of 
childhood trauma. Amongst women with depression, those with the “childhood trauma 
footprint” appear to respond better to combinations of psychotherapy and medication, 
illustrating the utility of the multi-level assessment in clinical practice (Richters & Cicchetti, 
1993; Richters & Hinshaw, 1999).

4.  A psycho-evolutionary view of stress, the brain, and neuropsychiatric 

disorders

Another factor to consider in reviewing stress, the brain, and neuropsychiatric disorders is 
the interaction between evolution and mental disorders. Fundamental to understanding 
stress-related psychiatric disorders is the role of neurophysiological systems involved in 
survival and their role in ancient and modern times. In the pre-agricultural age, humans 
roved the Savannah in small bands of hunter-gatherers, and evolution up to that point 
involved changes in the human brain that allowed individuals to run faster and fight back 
harder. Other advantages conveyed on humans included developing the capacity for abstract 
thought, language, and advanced social relationships. These processes required the 
development of a much larger frontal cortex than other animals, and along with that came 
side effects of anxiety and depression. Whether these are accidental by-products of evolution 
or served their own roles in specific situations is unclear. Taking an example from another 
area of medical science, the heterozygous gene for sickle cell anemia confers resistance to 
malaria, which is advantageous in African countries where this disease is common. 
Homozygous expression of the gene, however, confers sickle cell anemia. Thus a biological 
alteration that is advantageous in some situations is not in others. Similarly, depressive 
behaviors may be advantageous during sickness (in order to preserve energy) or during times

of extreme threat (removing the individual from threat). In other situations, however, 
depressive behavior may be maladaptive. Similarly, avoidance and hyper responsiveness 
seen in PTSD may have allowed members of primitive bands to survive threats when groups 
of predators were in the vicinity. Whatever behaviors were helpful in these prehistoric 
periods, however, are probably lost in the transition to modern culture, where life in high rise 
buildings and days spent puzzling over financial accounts rather than chasing animals 
through the bush came to predominate.

In earlier times fear-related behaviors may have meant the difference between life and death. 
If there was a pack of tigers in an area where a band of hunter-gatherers was camped, hyper-
vigilance could promote survival. These behaviors would be expected to persist, even after 
the threat had been removed. Children who exist in an environment of real or perceived 
threat respond in similar ways would sense the type of environment they were born into, and 
their developmental evolution would be adjusted accordingly. Children in a harsh, deprived, 
or non-supportive environment would grow up being mistrustful and socially withdrawn. 
This might have survival value in protecting the child from potentially harmful persons in 
the absence of a functional parent to protect them.

Symptoms of depression also probably have had a behavioral function at some point in time. 
They are a by-product of the development of the capacity in humans to form close social 
attachments. When those attachments are broken, through death or separation, there is a 
natural process of grieving where individuals recover from the disruption of the social 
connection and form the capacity to form new connections. If they do not go through this 
process, they may not go on to reproduce with others in the future. In addition, depression 
causes a social withdrawal and decrease in activity. Death of a partner or parent may put the 
survivor at greater risk without the added protection, so withdrawal from potentially 
dangerous situations would also have survival value. Similar behavioral effects occur with 
illnesses such as infections, which probably have similar survival value in allowing the 
conservation of energy and resources.

5.  Neurohormonal responses to trauma

Trauma can have lasting effects on neurotransmitter and neurohormonal systems involved in 
the stress response (Bremner & Pearce, 2016). Cortisol and norepinephrine systems are 
altered in PTSD (Bremner, 2002b; Bremner & Vermetten, 2001; Yehuda, 2006) and underlie 
symptoms of PTSD and other stress-related mental disorders (Baker et al., 2005; Bremner, 
2002a; Lindqvist et al., 2014; Neylan et al., 2005).

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated by stress. Corticotropin-
releasing factor (CRF) is released from the hypothalamus, with stimulation of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary resulting in turn in cortisol 
release from the adrenal. CRF also acts centrally to create fear-related behaviors and triggers 
other neurochemical responses to stress, including the noradrenergic neurotransmitter 
system (Melia & Duman, 1991). Early life stress leads to long-term sensitization of the HPA 
axis and CRF to further stressors (Coplan et al., 1996; Levine, Weiner, & Coe, 1993; 
Makino, Smith, & Gold, 1995; Plotsky & Meaney, 1993; Stanton, Gutierrez, & Levine,

1988). Stress also leads to over activation of the norepinephrine system, which plays a 
critical role in the fight or flight response (Bremner, Krystal, Southwick, & Charney, 1996a, 
1996b) (Fig. 2).

As noted above, a network of brain areas involved in memory and fear, including the 
hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, interact with these neurochemical 
systems to mediate the brain’s response to stress (Bremner, 2005b, 2011; Rauch, Shin, & 
Phelps, 2006). The medial prefrontal cortex includes the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal 
cortex, and adjacent areas. Inhibition of the amygdala by the medial prefrontal cortex 
represents the brain circuitry underlying extinction of fear responses (Milad & Quirk, 2002; 
Quirk, Garcia, & Gonzalez-Lima, 2006). This brain area, together with the hypothalamus, 
also modulates peripheral neurohormonal responses to stress via relay stations in the spinal 
cord (Diorio, Viau, & Meaney, 1993; Feldman, Conforti, & Weidenfeld, 1995; Frysztak & 
Neafsey, 1994).

Altered HPA axis function is associated with PTSD (Yehuda, 2002). Women with childhood 
sexual abuse-related PTSD had decreased baseline cortisol based on 24-h diurnal 
assessments of plasma with 10min sampling periods, a flattening of the normal diurnal 
cortisol curve, and increased pulsatility of cortisol reflecting dysregulation of CRF release, 
compared to women with abuse without PTSD, and women without abuse or PTSD 
(Bremner, Vermetten, & Kelley, 2007). Lower baseline cortisol was correlated with 
increased symptoms of PTSD in the PTSD group (Bremner et al., 2007). In a similar study 
of comprehensive sampling over 24h, combat veterans with PTSD showed lower plasma 
cortisol levels and a flattening of the normal diurnal curve (Yehuda, Teicher, Levengood, 
Trestman, & Siever, 1994), while other studies showed either normal or low cortisol 
measured in 24h urine collections (Yehuda, Boisoneau, Lowy, & Giller, 1995; Yehuda, 
Kahana, et al., 1995; Yehuda, Teicher, Trestman, Levengood, & Siever, 1996) and a blunting 
of the normal rise in cortisol after awakening in PTSD (de Kloet, Vermetten, Heijnen, et al., 
2007; Neylan et al., 2005; Wessa, Rohleder, Kirschbaum, & Flor, 2006). Other findings 
included increased suppression of cortisol to low doses of dexamethasone, which together 
with other studies reflects altered sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors in the pituitary 
and/or hippocampus (Bremner, Vythilingam, Vermetten, Newcomer, & Charney, 2004; de 
Kloet, Vermetten, Bikker, et al., 2007; de Kloet, Vermetten, Heijnen, et al., 2007; Goenjian 
et al., 1996; Stein, Yehuda, Koverola, & Hanna, 1997; Vermetten, 2008; Yehuda, Halligan, 
Grossman, Golier, & Wong, 2002; Yehuda, Levengood, et al., 1996; Yehuda, Lowy, 
Southwick, Shaffer, & Giller, 1991; Yehuda et al., 1993), PTSD patients showed increased 
cortisol in response to hearing personalized scripts of their childhood abuse (Elzinga, 
Schmahl, Vermetten, van Dyck, & Bremner, 2003) as well as with “neutral” mental stress 
tasks involving cognitive stressors like mental arithmetic (Bremner, Vythilingam, Vermetten, 
Adil, et al., 2003). Women with depression and a history of childhood abuse had increased 
cortisol response to a stressful cognitive challenge relative to controls (Heim et al., 2000) 
and a blunted ACTH response to CRF challenge (Heim, Newport, Bonsall, Miller, & 
Nemeroff, 2001). PTSD was associated with increases in CRF concentrations in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Baker et al., 2005, 1999; Bremner, Licinio, et al., 1997; Sautter et 
al., 2003) and plasma (de Kloet et al., 2008), and a blunted ACTH response to CRF 
challenge, suggesting decreased pituitary sensitivity to CRF (Smith et al., 1989).

Increased noradrenergic and peripheral sympathetic function is associated with PTSD 
(Bremner et al., 1996a, 1996b). Symptoms irritability, increased startle, hyperarousal and 
sleep disturbance, all indicate excessive sympathetic and noradrenergic function (Bremner et 
al., 1996b). Consistent with this, baseline concentrations of norepinephrine and its 
metabolites in urine and plasma in PTSD were found to be increased (De Bellis et al., 1999; 
De Bellis, Lefter, Trickett, & Putnam, 1994; Lemieux & Coe, 1995; Mason, Giller, & 
Kosten, 1988; Yehuda, Siever, & Teicher, 1998) or unchanged (Blanchard, Kolb, Prins, 
Gates, & McCoy, 1991; McFall, Veith, & Murburg, 1992; Mellman, Kumar, Kulick-Bell, 
Kumar, & Nolan, 1995; Pitman & Orr, 1990; Southwick et al., 1993) and increased in CSF 
(Geracioti et al., 2001). Increased sympathetic reactivity based on heart rate, blood pressure, 
and skin conductance (Blanchard, Kolb, Gerardi, Ryan, & Pallmeyer, 1986; Blanchard, 
Kolb, Pallmeyer, & Gerardi, 1982; Bremner et al., 1996b; Malloy, Fairbank, & Keane, 1983; 
McFall, Murburg, Ko, & Veith, 1990; Orr et al., 1998; Orr, Lasko, Shalev, & Pitman, 1995; 
Orr, Pitman, Lasko, & Herz, 1993; Orr & Roth, 2000), as well as increased norepinephrine 
and epinephrine in plasma (Blanchard et al., 1991; McFall et al., 1992), was seen in PTSD 
patients exposed to traumatic reminders in the form of combat slides and sounds or 
personalized trauma scripts, while administration of the alpha2 adrenergic receptor 
antagonist, yohimbine, which increases firing of noradrenergic neurons in the locus 
coeruleus, increased PTSD symptoms and anxiety, as well plasma concentrations of the 
norepinephrine metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) (Southwick et al., 
1997, 1993). PTSD patients had a decrease in brain function in the medial prefrontal cortex 
with yohimbine not seen in healthy controls (decreased frontal lobe function occurs with 
excessive release of norepinephrine in that brain area) (Bremner, Innis, et al., 1997). 
Increased heart rate in the emergency room after trauma predicted subsequent development 
of chronic PTSD (Shalev et al., 1998). These findings all support increased noradrenergic 
function in PTSD.

6.  The neural circuitry of PTSD

Brain imaging studies have been consistent in supporting the model of a specific circuitry of 
PTSD (Bremner, 2011). Exposure to memories of childhood sexual abuse with personalized 
traumatic scripts in women with childhood sexual abuse-related PTSD resulted in decreased 
blood flow in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate, including Brodmann’s area 25, 
or subcallosal gyrus, and area 32, as well as decreased blood flow in parietal cortex and 
inferior frontal gyrus (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999; Shin et al., 1999), hippocampus and 
visual association cortex (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999). Emotional memory tasks, such as 
retrieval of word pairs like “blood-stench” resulted in similar decreases in blood flow in this 
medial prefrontal cortex area, as well as hippocampus, and fusiform gyrus/inferior temporal 
gyrus, with increased activation in posterior cingulate, left inferior parietal cortex, left 
middle frontal gyrus, and visual association and motor cortex (Bremner et al., 2003b). 
Decreased medial prefrontal cortical/anterior cingulate activation was seen in women with 
abuse-related PTSD during performance of the emotional Stroop task (i.e., naming the color 
of a word such as “rape”) (Bremner, Vermetten, et al., 2004). Other studies replicated the 
finding of decreased medial prefrontal cortex/anterior function during exposure to traumatic 
reminders in the form of traumatic slides and/or sounds or traumatic scripts using PET,

SPECT or fMRI (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999; Bremner, Staib, et al., 1999; Britton, Phan, 
Taylor, Fig, & Liberzon, 2005; Lanius et al., 2001, 2003; Liberzon et al., 1999; Lindauer et 
al., 2004; Phan, Britton, Taylor, Fig, & Liberzon, 2006; Semple et al., 2000; Shin et al., 
1997, 1999, , 2004, 2001, 2005; Yang, Wu, Hsu, & Ker, 2004). Studies have also shown 
increased amygdala function with classical fear conditioning or other fear-related tasks 
(Armony, Corbo, Clement, & Brunet, 2005; Bremner et al., 2005; Liberzon et al., 1999; 
Pissiota et al., 2002; Protopopescu et al., 2005; Rauch et al., 1996, 2000; Shin et al., 2004, 
2005; Vermetten, Schmahl, Southwick, & Bremner, 2007). Other findings in studies of 
traumatic reminder exposure include decreased function with exposure to traumatic 
reminders in hippocampus (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999), 
thalamus(Laniusetal.,2001,2003), visual association cortex (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999; 
Lanius et al., 2003; Shin et al., 1997, 2004), parietal cortex (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999; 
Rauch et al., 1996; Sakamoto et al., 2005; Shin et al., 1997, 1999), inferior frontal gyrus 
(Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999; Lanius et al., 2003; Rauch et al., 1996; Sakamoto et al., 
2005; Shin et al., 1997, 1999, 2001), and increased function in insula (Bruce et al., 2013; 
Nicholson et al., 2016), posterior cingulate (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999; Bremner, Staib, 
et al., 1999; Lanius et al., 2001; Shin et al., 1997), insula (Vermetten et al., 2007), and 
parahippocampal gyrus (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999; Bremner, Staib, et al., 1999; 
Liberzon et al., 1999).

Brain imaging and physiological assessments were used to test the hypothesis that a 
common network of brain areas mediated symptoms of trauma spectrum disorders. We 
studied women with a history of childhood abuse and the diagnosis of BPD, with half of 
them having a co-morbid diagnosis of PTSD, although BPD was felt to be the primary 
diagnosis. Exposure to scripts of a hypothetical situation where they were abandoned in a 
mall led to marked increases in sympathetic responses as measured by heart rate and 
electrodermal responses, whereas exposure to personalized scripts of traumatic events from 
their childhood led to a much less exaggerated response (Schmahl, Elzinga, & Bremner, 
2002; Schmahl, Elzinga, et al., 2004). Women with PTSD related to childhood abuse 
without the diagnosis of BPD, on the other hand, had no response to abandonment scripts, 
but had pronounced physiological responses to the personalized traumatic scripts (Schmahl, 
Elzinga, et al., 2004). This was in spite of the fact that the severity of traumas between the 
two groups of women were comparable. Brain imaging showed that the women with PTSD 
and BPD had a similar footprint in neural responses (failure of response of the medial 
prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate) to the particular script (abandonment/trauma) for which 
they were most reactive (Bremner, Narayan, et al., 1999; Schmahl, Elzinga, et al., 2003; 
Schmahl, Vermetten, et al., 2004). These studies illustrate how similar events lead to 
different outcomes, however brain circuits mediating the effects overlap, suggesting that 
other factors like prior experience or genetics overlap with neurobiology to determine 
outcome (Fig. 2).

Studies of structural MRI showed smaller hippocampal volume across the trauma spectrum 
disorders (Bremner, 2016), including abuse-related PTSD (Bremner, Randall et al., 1997, 
Bremner et al., 2003a), DID with early abuse (Vermetten et al., 2006), BPD with early abuse 
(Driessen et al., 2000; Schmahl, Vermetten, et al., 2003), and depression with early abuse 
(Vythilingam et al., 2002). Patients with another anxiety disorder, panic disorder, did not

show a reduction in hippocampal volume (Vythilingam et al., 2000). Patients with trauma 
spectrum disorders exhibit other alterations in stress responsive neurohormonal systems. 
HPA axis dysfunction, and a functional dysregulation of the prefrontal-limbic axis, are seen 
in BPD that are similar to PTSD (Donegan et al., 2003; Driessen et al., 2004; Juengling et 
al., 2003; Lange et al., 2005; Schmahl & Bremner, 2006; Schmahl, Elzinga, et al., 2003; 
Schmahl, McGlashan, et al., 2002; Schmahl, Vermetten, et al., 2004). These findings are 
consistent with a common neurobiology and neurocircuitry underlying the trauma spectrum 
disorders, including PTSD, DID, BPD, and depression related to early abuse, as well as 
some differences. The partial overlap of neurobiology then parallels the partial overlap in 
symptomatology in patients with trauma-related mental disorders.

7.  Conclusions

Stress can have effects on the brain that lead to the symptoms of many stress-related 
psychiatric disorders. Treatments that target the underlying neurobiology can be helpful in 
their treatment. For instance, serotonin is one of the neurochemical systems associated with 
symptoms of PTSD and depression, and treatment with selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) can be helpful for many patients. Other non-medication treatments can be 
helpful as well, including psychotherapy and behavioral interventions like meditation 
training. Meditation adds a sense of control (Astin, 1997; Weissbecker et al., 2002), allowing 
trauma victims to gain control of their thoughts and memories in a non-emotional way, 
disrupting patterns of ruminative thinking (Teasdale, Segal, & Williams, 1995) which can be 
associated with pathological arousal (Teasdale et al., 2000). Interventions like these may 
modify the way traumatic memories are encoded and consolidated and therefore reduce risk 
of chronic symptoms of PTSD. Other interventions that block sympathetic arousal with 
reminders, like neuromodulation, may also be useful (Bremner & Rapaport, 2017). Research 
on neurobiological correlates of stress-related psychiatric disorders will be helpful in the 
development of new treatments for these disabling disorder.

Stress can lead to multiple psychiatric outcomes. However many of the symptoms of these 
disorders overlap. The symptoms above the line over posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
include the symptoms of that disorder. However, it can be seen that they overlap with 
symptoms of depression, represented by the symptoms listed above the line over that 
disorder. Other outcomes include dissociative disorders, which overlap with Borderline 
Personality Disorder (BPD). Genetics and prior experience modulate how stress manifests 
itself in psychiatric symptoms.

Fig. 2. 
Model of how stress affects brain function. Brain areas involved in stress and memory 
including the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial and orbitofrontal cortex (OPFC) 
(including anterior cingulate) mediate symptoms of stress-related psychiatric disorders. 
Neurochemical systems also mediate the stress response and underlie psychiatric disorders. 
Most of the norepinephrine cell bodies are located in the locus coeruleus (pons) with 
neurons that distribute throughout the brain and activate the fight or flight response. Stress 
information is processed by the cerebral cortex with pathways through the hypothalamus 
that activate peripheral sympathetic and cardiovascular responses, including increased Heart 
Rate (HR) and Blood Pressure (BP), as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis, with activation of Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus, which 
releases Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary, which in turn releases 
cortisol from the Adrenal Cortex. Norepinephrine and cortisol play critical roles in the stress 
response, and dysfunction of these systems underlie symptoms of stress-related psychiatric 
disorders.
