Abstract
Background  Loneliness and social isolation have been found to be associated with various health-related outcomes. 
Our study aimed to evaluate the association of loneliness and social isolation with the risk of glaucoma.

Methods  A total of 373,330 participants from the UK Biobank without glaucoma at recruitment were included in 
this study. Self-reported questionnaires were used to define loneliness and social isolation. Incident glaucoma events 
were identified by hospital inpatient admissions and self-reported data. COX proportional hazards models adjusted 
for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.

Results  During a median follow-up of 13.1 (interquartile range: 12.3–13.9) years, 6,489 participants developed 
glaucoma. After adjusting for confounding factors, loneliness (yes vs. no: adjusted HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.04–1.30; 
P = 0.009) and social isolation (yes vs. no: adjusted HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01–1.16; P = 0.033) were associated with an 
increased risk of glaucoma.

Conclusions  In this population-based prospective cohort study, loneliness and social isolation were associated with 
a higher risk of glaucoma.

Background
Glaucoma,  characterized  by  progressive  optic  neuropa-
thy  and  visual  field  loss,  remains  among  the  leading 
causes of irreversible blindness worldwide [1, 2]. It is pre-
dicted  that  111.8  million  individuals  will  have  glaucoma 
by  2040,  putting  a  strain  on  society  and  individuals  [3]. 
Complex interplay of genetic, systemic, and environmen-
tal  factors  contributes  to  the  development  of  glaucoma 
[1,  4].  However,  the  specific  pathogenesis  of  glaucoma 
warrants further studies. Therefore, it is crucial to iden-
tify potentially modifiable risk factors to reduce the onset 
or improve the prognosis of this disease.

Loneliness  and  social  isolation  are  established  social 
problems  which  have  a  negative  impact  on  both  mental 
and physical health [5]. Loneliness is a subjective feeling 
caused by a disparity between a person’s real and desired 
degree  of  social  connections,  whereas  social  isolation 
is  an  objective  experience  of  a  lack  of  social  activities 
[6,  7].  Emerging  evidence  has  suggested  that  loneliness 
and  social  isolation  are  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of 
various  health-related  outcomes,  such  as  dementia  [8], 
cardiovascular  diseases  [9–11],  and  hospital-treated 
infections  [12].  Nevertheless,  little  is  known  concerning 
their associations with the incidence of glaucoma.
Some  plausible  mechanisms  may  connect 

loneli-
ness  and  social  isolation  with  the  risk  of  glaucoma.  It  is 
reported that loneliness and social isolation may impact 
health  through  biological  changes  such  as  increased 
cortisol  secretion  and  elevated  levels  of  inflammation 
[13, 14]. These changes may lead to elevated intraocular 
pressure (IOP) and accelerated death of retinal ganglion 
cells  (RGCs),  thereby  promoting  the  onset  of  glaucoma 
[15, 16]. From a public health perspective, exploring the 
link between loneliness and social isolation with the risk 
of glaucoma may help to identify at-risk populations for 
early prevention and management of glaucoma.

Hence,  we  aimed  to  prospectively  evaluate  the  asso-
ciation of loneliness and social isolation with the risk of 
glaucoma among participants from the UK biobank.

Methods
Study design and population

The UK Biobank is a large population-based cohort study 
of  more  than  500,000  participants  aged  between  40  and 
69  years.  Participants  were  recruited  from  22  assess-
ment  centers  across  the  United  Kingdom  during  2006 
and  2010.  All  participants  provided  written  informed 
consent,  and  the  study  gained  ethics  approval  from  the 
North  West  Multicenter  Research  Ethics  Committee 
(REC  reference  NO.11/NW/0382).  Details  of  the  cohort 
study have been discussed previously [17].

In  this  study,  participants  with  prevalent  glaucoma  at 
baseline or participants with missing data were excluded. 

Finally,  a  total  of  373,330  participants  were  included  in 
our main analysis (Fig. 1).

Definition of loneliness and social isolation scales

The scales of loneliness and social isolation were derived 
from  self-reported  questions  at  recruitment  and  were 
consistent  with  several  previous  studies  [10,  11].  Lone-
liness  was  assessed  by  two  questions  derived  from  the 
revised  UCLA  loneliness  scale  [18]:  “Do  you  often  feel 
lonely?”  (1  point  for  the  answer  “yes”)  and  “How  often 
are you able to confide in someone close to you?” (1 point 
for the answer “never or almost never”). Individuals were 
defined as lonely if they had a total score of 2. Social iso-
lation was assessed by three questions which were similar 
to  those  of  the  validated  Berkman-Syme  social  network 
index [19]: (1) “How often do you visit friends or family 
or  have  them  visit  you?”  (1  point  for  less  than  one  visit 
per  month);  (2)  “Which  of  the  following  (sports  club  or 
gym, pub or social club, religious group, adult education 
class, other group activity) do you engage in once a week 
or  more  often?”  (1  point  for  participating  none  of  these 
activities); and (3) “Including yourself, how many people 
are living together in your household?” (1 point for living 
alone).  Individuals  with  a  total  score  of  2  or  more  were 
categorized as socially isolated.

Outcomes

In this study, incident cases of glaucoma were ascertained 
by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagno-
sis codes (10th Revision, ICD-10, or 9th Revision, ICD-9) 
and participants’ self-reported diagnoses. We ascertained 
cases  through  ICD-10  codes  H401,  H408,  and  H409; 
ICD-9  codes  365;  self-reported  glaucoma  (20002:  1277) 
and  answer  of  glaucoma  in  a  question  about  eye  prob-
lems or disorders (data field 6148) and the age when glau-
coma  was  diagnosed  (data  field  4689).  Participants  with 
glaucoma at baseline were excluded from the study. Clin-
ical entities associated with these definitions are listed in 
Supplementary  Table  S1. The  follow-up  time  was  calcu-
lated from the time of recruitment to the time of loss to 
follow-up, the time of death, the time of diagnosis, or the 
censoring date (01 May 2022).

Covariates

We considered the following characteristics as the poten-
tial  covariates:  age  at  recruitment,  sex,  race  (white,  oth-
ers),  education  (college  or  university  degree,  others), 
the  Townsend  deprivation  index,  smoking  status  (never, 
previous,  current),  moderate  drinking,  physical  activity, 
healthy  diet,  body  mass  index  (BMI),  history  of  hyper-
tension,  history  of  hypercholesterolemia,  and  history  of 
diabetes.  The  socioeconomic  level  was  represented  by 
the  Townsend  deprivation  index,  which  was  based  on 
the participants’ post code at enrollment [20]. Moderate

Fig. 1  Flowchart of the study population

drinking was set as ≤ 14 g/d for women and ≤ 28 g/d for 
men [21]. Physical activity was represented by the meta-
bolic  equivalent  task  (MET)  minutes  per  week,  which 
calculated  the  sum  of  energy  used  for  walking,  moder-
ate, and vigorous activities. A healthy diet was evaluated 
based  on  the  increased  intake  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and 
fish  and  decreased  intake  of  processed  and  red  meats 
(Supplementary Table S2). A healthy diet was defined as 
one that met at least two criteria [22]. History of hyper-
tension  was  defined  as  having  a  systolic  blood  pressure 
of 140 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg, a 
self-reported  history  of  hypertension,  or  being  on  anti-
hypertensive medication. Self-reported history of hyper-
cholesterolemia or use of lipid-lowering medications was 
considered  hypercholesterolemia.  The  definition  of  dia-
betes  included  self-reported  diabetes,  the  use  of  insulin 
or diabetic pills, and HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol).

Statistical analysis

Baseline  characteristics  were  presented  by  the  status  of 
loneliness and social isolation. Continuous variables were 
summarized by mean (SD) and categorical variables were 
summarized  by  frequency  (%).  Baseline  variables  were 
compared by the analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wal-
lis  test  for  continuous  data  and  the  Pearson  chi-square 

test for categorical data, as appropriate. Cumulative inci-
dence  and  incidence  rates  for  glaucoma  were  calculated 
per 1000 person-years of follow-up.

COX  proportional  hazards  models  were  used  to 
explore  the  association  of  loneliness  and  social  isola-
tion  with  the  incidence  of  glaucoma.  The  proportional 
hazards  assumptions  were  verified  based  on  Schoenfeld 
residuals,  and  no  violations  were  present.  The  results 
were  presented  as  hazard  ratios  (HRs)  and  95%  confi-
dence intervals (CIs). We created three models, each with 
an increasing number of confounding variables. Model 1 
was  adjusted  for  age  and  sex.  Model  2  was  additionally 
adjusted  for  race,  education  level,  and  Townsend  depri-
vation index. Model 3 was further adjusted for smoking 
status, moderate drinking consumption, physical activity, 
healthy diet, BMI, and history of hypertension, hypercho-
lesterolemia, and diabetes. Besides, considering the pos-
sibility  of  reporting  bias  in  self-reported  diagnoses,  we 
further assessed the impacts of loneliness and social iso-
lation on ICD codes-defined glaucoma and self-reported 
glaucoma separately.

Additionally,  we  conducted  subgroup  analyses  strati-
fied  by  age  (by  tertile  distribution:  ≤52,  53–61,  or  ≥ 62 
years),  sex,  and  race.  To  lessen  the  underlying  influ-
ence of reverse causality, we also conducted a sensitivity

analysis  by  excluding  participants  who  developed  glau-
coma within a 2-year follow-up.

All analyses were performed using STATA/SE (version 
16.0,  StataCorp.,  College  Station,  TX,  USA)  and  R  soft-
ware (version 4.2.2, R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing, Vienna, Austria). A two-sided P < 0.05 is considered 
statistically significant.

Results
Baseline characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the study population were 
presented in Table 1. The study sample for the main anal-
ysis comprised 373,330 participants (mean age: 56.2 ± 8.1 
years, 52.8% female), of whom 51,977 (13.9%) were clas-
sified  as  socially  isolated,  and  16,909  (4.5%)  were  clas-
sified  as  being  lonely.  Participants  with  social  isolation 
or  loneliness  were  more  likely  to  be  male  and  socioeco-
nomically  deprived.  Besides,  they  were  more  likely  to 
have  unhealthy  lifestyles,  including  less  physical  activity 
level, smoking, unhealthy diet, and non-moderate alcohol 
consumption.  Additionally,  they  had  higher  proportions 
of self-reported hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and 
diabetes.

Associations of loneliness and social isolation with the 
incidence of glaucoma

During  a  median  13.1  years  (interquartile  range:  12.3–
13.9)  of  follow-up,  we  recorded  6489  cases  of  glaucoma 
after  the  study  baseline.  Participants  with  loneliness  or 
social isolation had higher cumulative incidences of glau-
coma (Table 2). The associations of loneliness and social 

isolation  with  the  risk  of  glaucoma  were  presented  in 
Table 3. In the minimally adjusted model (model 1), par-
ticipants who were classified as loneliness, compared with 
those  without  loneliness,  were  associated  with  a  higher 
risk of glaucoma (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.07–1.34; P = 0.002). 
Similarly, the HR of social isolation on glaucoma was 1.11 
(95% CI: 1.04–1.19) when adjusted for age and sex. After 
further  adjustment  for  socioeconomic  factors,  including 
race,  education  level,  and  Townsend  deprivation  index 
(model 2), these risks did not change appreciably. In the 
fully adjusted model (model 3), both loneliness (HR: 1.16; 
95%  CI:  1.04–1.30;  P = 0.01)  and  social  isolation  (HR: 
1.08;  95%  CI:  1.01–1.16;  P = 0.03)  were  associated  with 
an  increased  risk  of  glaucoma.  When  further  exploring 
the  effects  of  loneliness  and  social  isolation  with  glau-
coma  defined  by  different  sources,  we  found  significant 
associations in glaucoma defined by ICD codes. After full 
adjustment,  the  HR  of  loneliness  on  ICD  codes-defined 
glaucoma  was  1.20  (95%  CI:  1.07,  1.34)  and  the  HR  of 
social isolation was 1.08 ((95% CI: 1.01, 1.17). Neverthe-
less,  there  were  no  significant  results  for  self-reported 
glaucoma.

Multiplicative interaction analysis further revealed that 
the  association  between  loneliness  and  the  incidence  of 
glaucoma was not modified by age, sex, or race (Supple-
mentary  Table  S3).  Besides,  the  relationship  between 
social isolation and the incidence of glaucoma was unaf-
fected by age and sex. There was an interaction of race on 
the association between social isolation and glaucoma (p 
for interaction = 0.02). Considering different age, sex, and 
race groups may have different intensity levels, subgroup

stratified  analyses  (Supplementary  Table  S4).  The  major 
results  remained  stable  in  the  sensitivity  analyses  when 
excluding glaucoma cases that occurred within the first 2 
years of follow-up (Supplementary Table S5).

Discussion
In  this  large  prospective  cohort  study  of  the  UK  Bio-
bank data, we mainly discovered that both loneliness and 
social isolation were associated with an increased risk of 
glaucoma. The associations were independent of age, sex, 
race,  socioeconomic  status,  lifestyle  factors,  and  history 
of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. The 
robustness  of  these  results  was  demonstrated  by  strati-
fied and sensitivity analyses.

Glaucoma  is  a  chronic,  progressive  disease  that  is 
among  the  leading  causes  of  visual  impairment  all  over 
the  world  [1,  23].  Upon  a  glaucoma  diagnosis,  patients 
often  fear  blindness  and  are  plagued  with  unpleasant 
emotions,  which  may  consequently  evolve  into  some 
mental  problems  [24].  On  the  other  side,  emerging 

evidence  has  suggested  that  psychological  factors  play 
a  crucial  role  on  the  development  of  glaucoma.  For 
instance, glaucoma suspects with anxiety and depression 
were associated with an increased risk of glaucoma [25]. 
As  an  aspect  of  psychological  factors,  loneliness  repre-
sents  a  source  of  mental  stress  and  was  associated  with 
cardiovascular health [26]. However, little is known about 
its effect on ocular health.

Many studies have demonstrated that social factors are 
associated with the risk of glaucoma. For instance, as an 
indicator  of  social  status,  both  area  and  individual  level 
deprivation were associated with late glaucoma manifes-
tation [27]. Recently, a cross-sectional study reported that 
personal poverty, defined as not driving a personal car to 
the  appointment,  and  neighborhood-level  poverty  were 
both  associated  with  a  higher  incidence  of  glaucoma  or 
suspected  glaucoma  [28].  Additionally,  it  was  suggested 
that  many  socioeconomic  factors,  such  as  smoking,  not 
having  a  car  for  transportation  to  eye  exams,  and  living 
alone, have been associated with a lack of follow-up after 
glaucoma  screening  clinics  [29].  Hence,  early  identifica-
tion  of  these  risk  factors  may  help  improve  compliance.

could lead to misclassification bias. Similar to other large 
population-based  studies,  our  present  study  failed  to 
specify the association between loneliness and social iso-
lation with different glaucoma subtypes due to the lack of 
phenotypic information in the UK Biobank. Distinguish-
ing  between  these  subtypes  of  glaucoma  with  different 
pathophysiologic mechanisms may help to better under-
stand  the  effects  of  loneliness  and  social  isolation  on 
glaucoma. Fourth, the measurements of loneliness, social 
isolation,  and  other  covariates  were  evaluated  at  base-
line, which may diminish their relevance if measured too 
far  from  the  glaucoma  diagnosis.  However,  the  fact  that 
previous  studies  have  employed  this  method  explains  in 
part the persuasiveness of this approach and the reliabil-
ity of our results. Fifth, because we used non-randomized 
observational data, we were unable to conclude causality, 
and thus a major concern of this study was reverse cau-
sation.  Nevertheless,  our  results  remained  robust  in  the 
sensitivity analysis, suggesting that the observed associa-
tions were less likely to be confounded by reverse causa-
tion. In addition, though we had carefully considered the 
adjustments  of  potential  confounders,  the  possibility  of 
residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Finally, the UK 
Biobank  cohort  is  not  representative  of  the  characteris-
tics  of  the  entire  UK  population.  However,  it  has  been 
argued  that  the  exposure-disease  relationship  in  the  UK 
Biobank may have broad reliability [37].

Conclusions
In  conclusion,  the  present  finding  suggests  that  both 
loneliness  and  social  isolation  are  associated  with  an 
increased risk of glaucoma. Our finding underscores the 
necessity  of  positive  mental  and  social  network  inter-
vention for individuals at high risk of glaucoma. Further 
research is needed to clarify the effects of loneliness and 
social isolation on specific subtypes of glaucoma.

Social  isolation,  as  an  element  of  social  characteristics, 
has  emerged  as  a  public  health  issue  [30,  31].  Our  find-
ings  help  complement  the  broad  spectrum  of  published 
reports on the association of social isolation with health-
related outcomes.

We  speculate  several  potential  mechanisms  to  explain 
our  findings.  First,  it  has  been  suggested  that  loneliness 
and  social  isolation  enhance  stress  reactivity,  which  is 
associated with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal  axis  [13,  14,  32].  Increased  metabolic  stress  has 
been reported to contribute to the damage and dysfunc-
tion  of  the  glaucomatous  neurovascular  unit  [33],  thus 
accelerating  the  progression  of  glaucoma.  Second,  ele-
vated levels of glucocorticoids (GCs), which are regulated 
by  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis,  have  side 
effects on glaucoma by inducing morphological changes 
in the trabecular meshwork and leading to elevated IOP 
[34].  Third,  loneliness  and  social  isolation  increase  the 
levels  of  inflammation  and  oxidative  stress  by  upregu-
lating sympathetic activity [35]. Activation of inflamma-
some  is  reported  to  accelerate  RGC  degeneration  and 
neuroinflammation 
in  glaucomatous  pathology  [15]. 
Besides, oxidative stress is associated with mitochondrial 
dysfunction  in  glaucomatous  RGC  degeneration  and 
serves as a key factor in RGC death [16]. All these stim-
uli are involved in the mediation of glaucomatous injury. 
Fourth,  social  disconnection  may  restrict  older  adults 
from medical support and healthcare resources [36], ulti-
mately leading to insufficiently timely diagnosis or treat-
ment of glaucoma.

The strengths of this study include its prospective study 
design, large sample size, long-term follow-up, and com-
prehensive definitions of covariates and outcomes. As far 
as  we  are  aware,  our  current  study  is  the  first  to  report 
that  both  loneliness  and  social  isolation  are  associated 
with a higher risk of glaucoma, independent of socioeco-
nomic factors, lifestyle factors, and health-related factors.
However,  this  study  had  several  limitations.  First,  the 
measurements  of  loneliness  and  social  isolation  in  the 
UK  Biobank  were  self-reported  and  had  not  been  for-
mally  verified.  However,  these  questions  were  adapted 
from validated scales [18, 19], and widely adopted in pre-
vious studies [9–12]. Second, we used ICD codes to iden-
tify cases that required surgery or hospitalization for the 
condition and therefore may have missed cases diagnosed 
only  on  an  outpatient  basis.  Therefore,  we  used  self-
reported  information  to  capture  these  cases.  However, 
a  limitation  of  self-reported  data  is  the  susceptibility  to 
recall errors, particularly concerning misinterpretation of 
the disease or age at diagnosis. This may partially explain 
why our findings were not significant when restricted to 
self-reported  glaucoma.  Third,  due  to  the  lack  of  clini-
cal  glaucoma  screening,  there  may  be  a  subset  of  par-
ticipants  with  clinically  undiagnosed  glaucoma,  which
