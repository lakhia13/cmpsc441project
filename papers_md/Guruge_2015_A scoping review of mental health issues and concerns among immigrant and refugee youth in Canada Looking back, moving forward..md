SCOPING REVIEW

A scoping review of mental health issues and concerns among
immigrant and refugee youth in Canada: Looking back, moving
forward

Sepali Guruge, RN, PhD,1 Hissan Butt, BA (Hons)2

ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: Youth comprise a significant portion of the total immigrant population in Canada. Immigrant and refugee youth often have different
migration trajectories and experiences, which can result in different mental health outcomes. Research is emerging in this area, but study findings have not
yet been consolidated.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is known from the existing literature about mental health issues and concerns among immigrant and refugee youth in
Canada?

METHOD: We searched Embase, Health Star, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Social Science Abstracts databases for the period 1990–2013 for Canadian
studies related to the mental health of youth born outside Canada. Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria.

RESULTS: Determinants of mental illness included pre-migration experiences, number of years since immigration to Canada, post-migration family and
school environment, in- and out-group problems, discrimination, and lack of equitable access to health care. Only a few common categories of mental illness
were identified, and the burden of mental illness was shared differently across gender and immigration status, with female youth experiencing more mental
health problems than male youth. Some studies identified fewer emotional and behavioural problems among refugee youth; others reported higher rates of
psychopathology among refugee youth compared with their Canadian-born provincial counterparts. Pre-migration experiences and the kinds of trauma
experienced were important for refugee youth’s mental health. Findings also indicated the importance of family involvement, school settings as points of care
and services, and in terms of timing, focusing on the first year of arrival in Canada.

PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Professionals must work across health, social, and settlement sectors to address the various pre- and post-migration
determinants of mental health and illness, and provide more timely and effective services based on how and when these determinants affect different groups
of youth.

post-migration determinants of mental
illness, refugees may
experience these determinants in “acute and unique ways,”
which may result in more mental health problems.3 To date,
findings from different studies about mental health among
immigrant and refugee youth in Canada have not been
consolidated.Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to assess
the current state of knowledge about various aspects of mental
health among immigrant and refugee youth in Canada, identify
gaps within the literature, and provide implications for research,
practice and policy.

METHOD

Various definitions of scoping reviews exist, along with various
purposes that they can serve.11 Mays, Roberts and Popay wrote
that scoping reviews “aim to map rapidly the key concepts
underpinning a research area and the main sources and types of
stand-alone
evidence available, and can be undertaken as
projects in their own right especially where an area is complex
or has not been reviewed before”.12 Arksey and O’Malley
suggested four objectives for scoping reviews: 1) to examine the
extent, range and nature of research activity; 2) to determine the
value of undertaking a full systematic review; 3) to summarize
and disseminate research findings; and 4) to identify research
gaps in the existing literature.13 Our objectives were in line with
1, 3 and 4.

We applied the five-stage framework proposed by Arksey and
O’Malley for conducting scoping reviews: Stage 1: Identifying the
research question; Stage 2:
Identifying the relevant studies;
Stage 3: Selecting studies; Stage 4: Charting the data; and Stage 5:
Collating, summarizing and reporting the results.

Stage 1: Identifying the research question
Our research question was: What is known from the existing
literature about mental health issues and concerns among
immigrant and refugee youth in Canada? We defined immigrant
and refugee youth as those aged 13–29 years and born outside
Canada, regardless of their official immigration status.

Stage 2: Identifying the relevant studies
With the help of an experienced librarian, we searched CINAHL,
Embase, HealthStar, Medline, PsycINFO, and Social Science Abstracts
(SSA) databases using the following combinations of keywords:
immigrant/immigration/precarious/refugee/newcomer OR culture/
cultural/multicultural/ethnocultural/minority/diversity/diverse
AND mental health/mental disease/mental illness/mental disorder/
mental problem/depression/schizophrenia/mood disorder/anxiety/
posttraumatic stress disorder/psychiatry/psychiatric AND Canada.
Inclusion criteria for articles were: 1) peer-reviewed; 2) focused on
the Canadian context; 3) based on primary studies; 4) focused
on immigrants and/or refugees; 5) published in English; and
6) published between January 1990 and August 2013.

The databases yielded a total of 1,384 articles (CINAHL: 74,
Embase: 341, Health Star: 332, Medline: 318, PsycINFO: 247, and
SSA: 72). We removed 722 duplicates from this set.

Flow chart: Literature search and selection

Stage 3: Selecting studies
We assessed the abstracts of the remaining 662 articles to confirm
that: they were based on primary data, they had a mean/median
age between the specified age range of 13–29, and at least 50% of
study participants were born outside Canada. The latter criterion
was determined easily if the articles explicitly used terms such as
‘refugee(s)’ and/or ‘immigrant(s)’ to identify the participants. If
these criteria were not clear from the abstracts, articles were
retrieved and read. A total of 44 full articles were read and 17 of
these met the inclusion criteria and were included in this
scoping review (see Figure 1).

Stage 4: Charting the data
The 17 articles were charted in Microsoft Excel 2011 using the
following headings: Author/s; Name of
journal; Year of
publication; Title; Aim of the study; Focus area; Study method;
Study design; Ethnicity; Age; Immigration status; Gender; Sample
size; Study setting; Data collection; Data analysis; Major findings;
Limitations; and Implications for research, practice, and policy.
Table 1 displays the charted data (with the exception of the
findings, limitations and implications).

Stage 5: Collating, summarizing and reporting the data
Based on the content of the articles included in the scoping
review, we devised the following categories of focus and placed
each article in the appropriate category: determinants of mental
health;
and program
evaluation/intervention. Common themes across articles were
identified, and when possible, articles were compared.

rates of mental

symptoms/illness;

The next sections present the findings.

Characteristics of the studies included
In the 17 articles selected for analysis, sample sizes ranged from
10–281. Eleven (65%) studies were conducted in Quebec and five
(29%) in Ontario. One study was conducted in both Quebec and
Ontario. All studies were carried out in major metropolises. In
terms of study design, 15 (88%) studies were cross-sectional and
2 (12%) were longitudinal. Three (18%) were qualitative and the
remaining 14 (82%) used mixed methods.

Age ranges of study populations fell within our definition of
youth (13–29 years of age) in 2 of the 17 studies (12%). Nine (53%)
‘mixed,’ which included children
studies were labeled as
(<12 years) and youth, or youth and adults (>29 years), or
children, youth and adults, and the mean or median age of the
study sample was between 13 and 29 years. The remaining six
studies (35%) did not mention the age range of participants, but
were included in our review because the mean or median age of
their study populations were between 13 and 29 years.

Eight (47%) studies included refugee youth and three (18%)
included both immigrant and refugee youth. The remaining six
studies (23%) did not clearly state the official immigration status
of the study participants. However, these studies did provide
information about their birthplaces. In terms of gender, one (6%)
study focused on young women; one (6%) on young men; and

the other 15 (88%) articles included young men and women. The
studies captured ethnicity in different ways: many used
categories such as ‘country of origin,’ ‘country of birth,’ or
‘continent of birth’
instead of ethnicity. Six (43%) studies
included only one ethnic group (e.g., ref. 21). Eleven (65%) studies
focused on more than one ethnicity (e.g., ref. 22). A few ethnic
groups were common across a number of articles. For example,
Cambodian youth were discussed in five articles, Central
American in three, Caribbean in three, Somali
in two, and
Filipino in two.

Summary of study findings
Three themes emerged from the articles: determinants of mental
health were discussed in nine articles, rates of mental illness in
four, and program evaluation/intervention in two. Two articles

discussed both determinants of mental health and rates of mental
illness. Mental health problems discussed in the articles included

Determinants of mental health included both pre- and post-
migration determinants. Pre-migration determinants included
pre-migration experiences, culture and trauma. Pre-migration
experiences and culture appeared to provide youth of various
ethnocultural
coping
mechanisms in Canada. For example, one study reported that
Somali refugee youth were relatively “protected” through the
collective meaning of separation embedded in their “nomadic”
culture.21 Two types of pre-migration trauma, personal and
collective, and their effects on cultural adaptation and mental
health were discussed. For example, one study reported that
Somali refugees’ experiences of pre-migration collective trauma
(exposure to warfare, ethnic discrimination, stay in a refugee
camp) were not related to depressive symptoms, although these
experiences were associated with poorer adaptation. However,
personal trauma (serious accident, death of a loved one, assault
from a familiar other, etc.) was associated with depressive
refugee youth.15 A study with
symptoms among Somali
Cambodian youth24 contested the negative relation between
collective trauma and adaptation, but confirmed that
the
relation between collective trauma and mental health may not
necessarily be negative: Cambodian families exposed to political
violence prior to migration reported positive ‘social adjustment’

Rates of mental illness appeared to vary by gender, ethnicity, and
immigration status. According to one study,30 female refugee
adolescents (from a range of countries of origin) had higher rates
of psychopathology than their male refugee counterparts.

Two articles discussed a program and an intervention designed
for immigrant and refugee adolescents in schools. The first
evaluated a 9-week school drama therapy program26 and the
second evaluated an intervention involving a 12-week series of
workshops integrating drama and language awareness.29 Both of
these studies reported post-program/intervention reductions in
impairment related to emotional and behavioural symptoms
among participants compared with comparison groups. For the
9-week drama therapy program, performance in mathematics
increased significantly compared with the comparison group,
although there was no reported improvement in self-esteem or
emotional and behavioural
symptoms. This program also
appeared to be associated with “a decrease in impairment in girls,
while the program appeared to prevent an increase in
impairment in boys.”26

DISCUSSION

The findings presented above should be interpreted with caution
for several reasons related primarily to the methods used in the
original studies. First, studies often used non-representative and
small samples, which did not permit inferences to be made
about youth from the particular ethnic group or across groups.
Second, all the studies took place in Ontario and/or Quebec, and
one research team conducted 10 of the 11 Quebec-based studies.
The findings cannot, therefore, be generalized to immigrant and
refugee populations across Canada. Third, only a few mental

illnesses were examined across
mentioned in three studies but in different contexts, without
much basis to draw comparisons between particular groups of
youth. Fourth, although the studies generally reported gender
it was difficult to identify the challenges faced
differences,
specifically by female and male youth because these were not
explicitly discussed. Fifth, although there were a few common
ethnic groups across articles, the focus areas of these articles did
not necessarily converge, making it difficult to draw conclusions
about the status of a specific ethnic group. For example, the five
articles that included Cambodian youth covered three separate
themes. Finally, no studies explicitly compared the rates of

illness among immigrant and refugee youth,

Pre-migration trauma appeared as a complex factor for the post-
migration mental health of refugee youth. The relationship
between pre-migration collective trauma and cultural adaptation
in the ‘host’ country appeared to conflict: Somali refugees who
had experienced collective trauma prior
to migration (e.g.,
through civil war), had ‘poorer cultural adaptation’,15 whereas
Cambodian refugee youth, after exposure to political violence in
their home country, reported positive ‘social adjustment’.24 The
relationship between collective trauma and mental health was
also not clear, as some findings suggest collective trauma could
act as a protective factor. To determine whether trauma is a risk
or protective factor in refugee youth mental health, it would be

necessary to consider not only the intensity and duration of
trauma, but the age at which the trauma is experienced. Even
when the trauma is experienced as collective, the intensity of its
effects may vary among and between groups of youth. It is also
important to note that the two articles that examined this
relationship had relatively small samples (57 and 169), and (as
focused on only two ethnic groups (one on
noted above)
Cambodian youth and one on Somali youth). More research
with larger sample sizes and more ethnic groups is needed to
further clarify these findings.

The importance of engaging families in addressing the mental
health and illness concerns of immigrant and refugee youth was
highlighted in a number of articles. One study20 recommended
the involvement of multiple informants, especially from the
family, to bring in multiple perspectives about the mental health
of their children. The school was commonly identified as an
important site to address the needs of immigrant and refugee
youth, and the two programs/interventions that appeared to
offer innovative approaches to address the mental health needs
of immigrant and refugee youth were both located in schools.
The 12-week intervention was designed to help youth cope with
adversity, and the 9-week program was designed to prevent
emotional and behavioural problems and to improve school
performance. Evaluation of the program revealed a differential
impact based on gender, which should be taken into account

Implications for research, practice and policy
The small number of articles (n = 17) published over a 23-year
period demonstrates the paucity of research focused on mental
health among immigrant and refugee youth in Canada.

MENTAL HEALTH OF IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE YOUTH IN CANADA

Substantially more research is needed on this topic. In particular,
more research is needed to assess the prevalence rates and pre-
and post-migration factors to explain variability in symptoms,
and to gain a holistic picture of the mental health of refugee and
immigrant youth. More research is also needed to assess the
use of mental health services among youth of both genders and
of various ethnic groups, immigration status, and length of stay
in Canada. Potential subject areas for future study include
trauma, resilience, and protection among refugee youth, further
clarification of the determinants of mental health, pathways to
care, and the dynamics within immigrant and refugee families
(e.g., parent–child relations) and between the family and the
socio-economic environment. Future research could also explore
the reasons for potential variability in specific mental illnesses
by gender and immigrant groups. Many of the articles stressed
the need for longitudinal research to explore specific mental
health issues among individuals and subpopulations over time,
as well as the need for gender-based analyses to identify different
styles of coping across genders and ethnic groups.

The articles revealed several implications for practice, such as
the importance of family involvement and school settings as
points of care. Both of the programs/interventions were based in
schools, and drama therapy programs and workshops appear to
be promising, although more research is required to evaluate
their effectiveness in the medium and long term. Reaching out
to refugee youth, especially during their first year of arrival in
Canada, may be helpful. Health care professionals should work
across health, social, and settlement sectors to address the
various determinants of mental health and provide more
effective services based on how these have differential effects on
various youth groups.

The articles also revealed some implications for policy. Policies
need to be developed with an awareness of the importance of
and need for intersectoral collaboration to reduce structural
discrimination and racism, which negatively affect immigrant
and refugee youth. Policies should also include multisectoral and
context-specific mental health promotion programs: different
sectors need to work together to address mental health issues
among immigrant and refugee youth, particularly at the time of
arrival, to assess their health status and refer them to the
appropriate services. This kind of pre-emptive action may help
prevent the costs of treatments associated with the management
of full-blown mental illnesses, and benefit youth, their families,
and society.

RÉSUMÉ

CONTEXTE : Les jeunes représentent une part importante de la population
immigrante au Canada. Les jeunes immigrants et réfugiés ont souvent des
trajectoires et des expériences migratoires différentes, ce qui peut entraîner
des différences dans leurs résultats de santé mentale. La recherche en ce
domaine commence à émerger, mais les constatations des études n’ont pas
encore été regroupées.

QUESTION DE RECHERCHE : Que dit la littérature actuelle sur les
problèmes et les préoccupations de santé mentale des jeunes immigrants et
réfugiés au Canada?

MÉTHODE : Nous avons interrogé les bases de données Embase, Health
Star, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO et Social Sciences Abstracts pour la
période de 1990 à 2013 afin de répertorier les études canadiennes portant
sur la santé mentale des jeunes nés à l’extérieur du Canada. Dix-sept études
ont répondu à nos critères d’inclusion.

RÉSULTATS : Les déterminants de la maladie mentale étaient les
expériences pré-migratoires, le nombre d’années depuis l’immigration au
Canada, le milieu familial et scolaire post-migration, les problèmes intra- et
extra-groupe, la discrimination et le manque d’accès équitable aux soins de
santé. Seul un petit nombre de catégories courantes de maladies mentales
ont été répertoriées, et le fardeau de la maladie mentale était inégalement
réparti selon le sexe et le statut d’immigration, les jeunes filles éprouvant
davantage de troubles de santé mentale que les jeunes garçons. Certaines
études font état d’un moins grand nombre de problèmes émotionnels et
comportementaux chez les jeunes réfugiés; d’autres observent des taux
supérieurs de psychopathologies chez les jeunes réfugiés comparativement
à leurs homologues provinciaux nés au Canada. Les expériences pré-
migratoires et les types de traumatismes vécus sont importants pour la santé
mentale des jeunes réfugiés. Les constatations indiquent aussi l’importance
de l’implication familiale, du milieu scolaire en tant que point d’intervention
et de service, et de la première année suivant l’arrivée au Canada.

IMPLICATIONS PRATIQUES : Les professionnels doivent travailler à la fois
dans le secteur sociosanitaire et avec les services d’établissement pour
aborder les divers déterminants pré- et post-migratoires de la santé et de la
maladie mentales; ils doivent également offrir des services plus rapides et
plus efficaces, fondés sur la façon dont ces déterminants affectent différents
groupes de jeunes et sur le moment où ils les affectent.
