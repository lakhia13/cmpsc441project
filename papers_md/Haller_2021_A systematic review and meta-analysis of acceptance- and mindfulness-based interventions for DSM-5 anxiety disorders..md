A systematic review 
and meta‑analysis of acceptance‑ 
and mindfulness‑based 
interventions for DSM‑5 anxiety 
disorders

Heidemarie Haller  *, Pascal Breilmann, Marleen Schröter, Gustav Dobos & Holger Cramer

This meta‑analysis systematically reviewed the evidence on standardized acceptance‑/mindfulness‑
based interventions in DSM‑5 anxiety disorders. Randomized controlled trials examining Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mindfulness‑Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Mindfulness‑Based 
Stress Reduction (MBSR) were searched via PubMed, Central, PsycInfo, and Scopus until June 2021. 
Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for primary 
outcomes (anxiety) and secondary ones (depression and quality of life). Risk of bias was assessed 
using the Cochrane tool. We found 23 studies, mostly of unclear risk of bias, including 1815 adults 
with different DSM‑5 anxiety disorders. ACT, MBCT and MBSR led to short‑term effects on clinician‑ 
and patient‑rated anxiety in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU alone. In comparison 
to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), ACT and MBCT showed comparable effects on both anxiety 
outcomes, while MBSR showed significantly lower effects. Analyses up to 6 and 12 months did not 
reveal significant differences compared to TAU or CBT. Effects on depression and quality of life showed 
similar trends. Statistical heterogeneity was moderate to considerable. Adverse events were reported 
insufficiently. The evidence suggests short‑term anxiolytic effects of acceptance‑ and mindfulness‑
based interventions. Specific treatment effects exceeding those of placebo mechanisms remain unclear. 
Protocol registry: Registered at Prospero on November 3rd, 2017 (CRD42017076810).

Anxiety disorders differ from normative fear or anxiety by featuring exaggerated symptoms lasting persistently 
over a prolonged period of time that interfere with daily activities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) classifies anxiety disorders as Separation Anxiety Disorder, Selective 
Mutism, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Specific Phobias, and Generalized Anxiety 
 Disorder1. Globally, the one-year prevalence of anxiety disorders ranges from 2.4% to 29.8% with a point preva-
lence of 7.3%2, while subthreshold anxiety cases are even more  common3. For most anxiety diagnoses, women 
are twice often affected than  men4,5. Patients with anxiety disorders report high rates of co-morbidity6 and often 
suffer from disturbed sleep, headaches, depressed mood, gastrointestinal or cardiovascular  problems7,8 leading 
to increasing costs of health care utilization and work  loss9.

As  the  first-line  treatment  of  anxiety  disorders,  clinical  practice  guidelines  recommend  psychologi-
cal therapies, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in preference to or in combination with 
 pharmacotherapy10–12. Another treatment option with promising evidence for alleviating anxiety symptoms in 
non-psychiatric  samples13–17 are mindfulness-based interventions such as Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction 
(MBSR), Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT). MBSR 
is a standardized group program of 8 weekly sessions lasting an average of 2.5 h combined with an additional 
silent retreat day. Core components of MBSR include sitting and walking meditation, yoga asanas, and mindful 
relaxation techniques. Daily home practice is demanded to integrate mindfulness into everyday  life18. MBCT 
combines mindfulness elements with cognitive-behavioral methods like psychoeducation, cognitive restructur-
ing, and the development of pleasant activities – also within an 8-week group setting including a retreat day and 
daily home  practice19. ACT combines acceptance-based and mindfulness strategies with cognitive-behavioral

techniques and focuses on accepting experiences while being present, choosing goals according to values, and 
then taking committed action. ACT is usually an individual-based approach, but also offers group concepts 
mostly for non-clinical  populations20. For patients with manifest anxiety disorders, previous systematic reviews 
of MBSR, MBCT, and ACT with and without meta-analysis suggest significant greater effects in comparison to 
usual care and comparable effects to CBT but used outdated methodology or focused on single anxiety disorders, 
mixed anxiety/obsessive–compulsive and depressive syndromes, or elderly patients/children21–26. To date, there is 
no comprehensive meta-analysis that assesses and compares the effectiveness and safety of standardized MBSR, 
MBCT, and ACT in the management of adult patients with DSM-5 anxiety disorders.

Methods
The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  guidelines27 and the Cochrane  recommendations28. Before starting the review, 
the protocol was registered at Prospero (CRD42017076810).

Study  selection.  Types  of  studies:  Randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  or  randomized  crossover  trials 
were eligible.

Types of patients: Eligible samples included adults diagnosed with an anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-51 

including:

Separation Anxiety Disorder (DSM-5: 309.21/ICD-10: F93.0),
Selective Mutism (DSM-5: 321.23/ICD-10: F94.0),
Specific Phobias (DSM-5: 300.29/ICD-10: F40.218, F40.228, F40.23x, F40.248, F40.298),
Social Anxiety Disorder (DSM-5: 300.23/ICD-10: F40.10),
Panic Disorder (DSM-5: 300.01/ICD-10: F41.0),
Agoraphobia (DSM-5: 300.22/ICD-10: F40.00),
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-5: 300.02/ICD-10: F41.1),
Other Specified (DSM-5: 300.09/ICD-10: F41.8), and
Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (DSM-5: 300.00/ICD-10: F41.9).

Patients who were diagnosed by prior versions of the DSM/ICD were also eligible, if their diagnosis is listed as 
a DSM-5 anxiety disorder as well. Studies involving patients with anxiety comorbid with other physical/mental 
disorders were eligible, if the comorbidity was not examined as the primary study outcome. Studies including 
heterogeneous psychiatric populations such as patients with anxiety disorders as well as those with depression 
or obsessive–compulsive disorder were excluded, while studies assessing mixed anxiety diagnoses (as defined 
above) were considered as well.

Types of interventions: Standardized acceptance- or mindfulness-based interventions like MBSR, MBCT, 
ACT, and variations of these programs (regardless of program length, frequency, or setting) were eligible. Stud-
ies allowing individual co-interventions were eligible as long as all participants in all groups received the same 
co-interventions. Acceptable control interventions were no treatment/wait-list or treatment as usual (TAU) as 
well as any other active treatments.

Types of outcomes: Improvement in the severity of anxiety symptoms measured by validated clinician- and/
or patient-rated scales closest to 2 months after randomization (short-term) were defined as primary outcomes. 
Secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms closest to 6 months and 12 months after randomization and 
safety. The severity of depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life were included as secondary outcomes 
as well, as anxiety disorders have high rates of comorbidity with depressive symptoms and reduced quality of life. 
If an outcomes was assessed by more than one instrument, primary endpoints were preferred over secondary 
ones, disease-specific instruments over generic ones and multi-item over single-item ones. Safety was assessed as 
the number of adverse events (AE) or study withdrawals due to AEs. AEs were defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient, without necessarily having a causal relationship with the study treatment. Cases of any 
untoward medical occurrence that had resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization, 
or caused persistent or significant disability were rated as serious  AEs29.

Data sources.  PubMed, Central, PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched from their inception to June 22nd, 
2020. An update was executed in PubMed until June 14th, 2021. Table 1 shows the search strategy in PubMed, 
which was adapted for each database as necessary. No language restrictions were applied. Moreover, we manu-

trial registries of the WHO and the NIH applying identical search terms. Two reviewers (HH and PB) indepen-
dently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-texts for eligibility using EndNote. Any disagreement were 
rechecked with a third reviewer (HC) until consensus was achieved.

Data extraction.  Two reviewers (PB and MS) independently extracted predefined data on the study setting 
and characteristics of the included studies. All Discrepancies were rechecked with a third reviewer (HH) until 
consensus was achieved.

For each study, the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and 
other source of bias were independently assessed by two reviewers (PB and MS) using the Cochrane risk of bias 
 tool28. Each domain was assessed as either, ‘low risk of bias’ if all requirements were adequately fulfilled, ‘high 
risk of bias’ if the requirements were not adequately fulfilled, and as ‘unclear risk of bias’ if insufficient data for 
a judgment was provided. Divergent assessments were rechecked with a third reviewer (HC) until consensus 
was achieved.

Data synthesis.  Overall analyses. 
If at least two studies had assessed the same outcome to the same de-
fined time point with the same type of control intervention, pairwise meta-analyses using random-effects mod-
els (inverse variance method) with Hedges’ correction for small  samples28 were conducted using Review Man-
ager Software (RevMan, Version 5.3, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen). For continuous outcomes, 
standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated indicating the dif-
ference in means between groups divided by the pooled standard deviation (SD). In cases where no SDs were 
published, they were calculated from standard errors, CIs or t-values28, or were requested from trial authors by 
email.  A  negative  SMD  indicated  greater  effects  of  the  experimental  intervention  over  the  respective  control 
condition, except for quality of life. In accordance with Cohen’s categories, SMDs of 0.2–0.5 were interpreted as 
small effects, SMDs of 0.5–0.8 as medium effects, and SMDs > 0.8 as large  effects30. For binary outcomes such 
as AEs, risk ratio analyses were planned. However, as most studies did not report AEs systematically, AEs were 
analyzed descriptively.

Assessment of statistical heterogeneity.  Statistical heterogeneity between the study effects was analyzed by the 
 Chi2 statistics with a p-value of ≤ 0.10 indicating significant heterogeneity. The magnitude of heterogeneity was 
categorized by the  I2 with  I2 > 25%,  I2 > 50%, and  I2 > 75% representing moderate, substantial, and considerable 
heterogeneity,  respectively28,31.

Subgroup analyses.  Subgroup analyses were planned for patients with different anxiety diagnoses and different 
mindfulness interventions but could only be realized for the latter, as the number of studies for comparisons was 
too small.

Sensitivity analyses.  We conducted sensitivity analyses, where studies with high or unclear risk of bias were 
compared with those of low risk of bias. If substantial or considerable statistical heterogeneity was present in a 
meta-analysis, we used sensitivity analyses to explore heterogeneity in effect estimates.

Risk of bias across studies.  The assessment of publication bias was planned by visual analysis of funnel plots and 
Egger’s test, if more than 10 studies were included in a meta-analysis32.

Results
Literature  search.  The  electronic  search  revealed  7651  articles,  a  PubMed  update  additional  362  ones 
(Fig. 1). After the exclusion of supplicates and non-eligible abstracts, 49 articles were red in full. We excluded 
further 9 ones as they reported data of an already included  sample33–41, 8 as they included mixed anxiety disor-
ders containing patients with other than the defined DSM-5 anxiety  diagnoses42–49, 2 articles because of younger 
aged  samples50,51, 2 as they did not include a predefined  outcome52,53, and 4 articles as they did not contain a 
predefined control  group54–57. One additional study did not investigate a standardized ACT, MBCT, or MBSR 
 program58. Thus, 23 RCTs published between 2007 and 2021 including 1815 patients were included in the meta-
analysis59–81. Searching of trial registries revealed no additional unpublished or ongoing studies.

Study  characteristics.  The  characteristics  of  the  included  RCTs  are  presented  in  detail  in  Table  2.  The 
RCTs were conducted in the US, Sweden, Canada, Germany, Norway, Brazil, Japan, Iran, Romania, and China 
and  investigated  patients  diagnosed  with  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Social  Anxiety  Disorder,  and  mixed 
anxiety diagnoses. Samples randomized ranged from 24 to 182 with a median N of 81 containing a median of 
67.1% of women. The participants’ median age was 35.3 years.

Twelve RCTs investigated ACT interventions, 3 ones MBCT, and 8 ones MBSR. Individual- and group-based 
approaches varied as well as online and offline/in-person settings. Control interventions included TAU/wait-
list, individualized or group-based CBT, psychoeducation, and relaxation. The median duration of the study 
treatments was 10 (4 to 16) weeks. Concurrent psychotropic drug use was reported by a median of 26.1% of the 
participants.

All studies provided data directly after the end of the intervention. Seven RCTs assessed a follow-up clos-
est to 6 months after randomization, 4 RCTs additionally closest to 12 months after randomization. Outcomes

included clinician-rated severity of anxiety, patient-rated severity of anxiety, patient-rated severity of depression, 
and patient-rated health-related quality of life.

Funding was reported by all but 3 RCTs and contained no specific funding (3 RCTs), university grants (4 
RCTs), governmental grants (8 RCTs), university and governmental funding (1 RCT), private foundations (3 
RCTs), and industrial funding (1 RCT).

Risk of bias of individual studies.  Risk of selection bias was assessed as low in 21.7% of the included 
studies. Additional 30.4% reported adequate random sequence generation but did not provide information or 
reported in-adequate information about allocation concealment. No study had low risk of performance bias. 
The risk of detection bias was low in 60.9% of the studies. Here, a low risk of bias judgement was also given in 
cases, when the outcome was clinician-reported and the clinician was blinded to group allocation but also when 
the staff who handed out the patient questionnaires was blinded, even if patients cannot be blinded. The same 
amount of the studies (60.9%) were assessed as low risk of attrition bias as they recorded less than 10% drop-outs 
per group or/and performed intention-to treat analysis. The risk of reporting bias and possible risks of other 
sources of bias were low in 21.7% and 78.3% of the studies, respectively (Fig. 2).

Pooling of effects.  Clinician‑rated anxiety.  ACT showed a significantly larger short-term effect than TAU 
on  clinician-rated  anxiety  (4  RCTs,  SMD = −0.98,  95%CI = [−1.50,  −0.46],   I2 = 62%,  N = 204).  The  substantial 
heterogeneity could be reduced by excluding one RCT 65 with mostly high/unclear risk of bias and the only effect 
which crossed zero (3 RCTs, SMD = −1.16, 95%CI = [−1.52, −0.80],  I2 = 5%, N = 152) (Fig. 3). The analyses were 
robust against risk of detection bias, attrition bias, and other bias. In comparison to CBT, ACT homogeneously 
showed non-significant short-term (3 RCTs, SMD = 0.13, 95%CI = [−0.17, 0.43],  I2 = 0%, N = 176) and medium-
term effects up to 6 months (2 RCTs, SMD = 0.26, 95%CI = [−0.10, 0.62],  I2 = 0%, N = 121) (Fig. 3). However, 
for both analyses, only the risk of detection bias and other bias was low. Up to 12 months, again no significant 
differences were found between ACT and  CBT61. In comparison to less complex psychological interventions 
such  as  psychoeducation  or  relaxation,  ACT  did  not  show  a  significant  larger  effect  (2  RCTs,  SMD = −0.18, 
95%CI = [−1.00, 0.64],  I2 = 77%, N = 107) (Fig. 3). Because of the considerable heterogeneity, the pooled effect 
should be interpreted with restraint, also because one of the  RCTs63 reported significant medium-term effects of 
ACT against psychoeducation. Detailed analyses can be found in the Supplementary Fig. 1.

Further 2 RCTs of mostly unclear risk of bias, one on MBCT against  CBT77 and another on MBSR against 

 psychoeducation69 did not show any significant short-term superiority of the respective interventions.

Patient‑rated anxiety.  The meta-analyses of ACT in comparison to TAU revealed a significantly larger effect 
in  favor  of  ACT  (7  RCTs,  SMD = −0.99,  95%CI = [−1.47,  −0.50],   I2 = 84%,  N = 488)  but  revealed  considerable 
heterogeneity, which could be decreased by excluding one RCT 64 with the greatest effect in favor of ACT and 
the weakest study quality (6 RCTs, SMD = −0.67, 95%CI = [−0.87, −0.47],  I2 = 0%, N = 448) (Fig. 3). The effect 
was  robust  against  the  risk  of  selection  bias,  detection  bias,  attrition  bias,  reporting  bias,  and  other  bias.  No 
significant differences occurred for ACT versus TAU at 6 months (2 RCS, SMD = −2.55, 95%CI = [−5.57, 0.46], 
 I2 = 94%, N = 62), while both individual  trials64,71 reported significant differences. However, the two RCTs were 
both of unclear/high risk of bias and included very small samples, which may explain the considerable heteroge-

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/neity. The meta-analysis of ACT versus CBT contained RCTs with mostly unclear/high risk of bias and revealed 
neither significant short-term (4 RCTs, SMD = 0.21, 95%CI = [−0.14, 0.57],  I2 = 52%, N = 284) nor medium-term 
(2 RCTs, SMD = 0.20, 95%CI = [−0.17, 0.56],  I2 = 0%, N = 116) (Fig. 3) or longer-term  differences61 between the 
two therapies. In comparison to less complex psychological interventions, ACT led to no significantly different 
short-term effect (2 RCTs, SMD = −0.16, 95%CI = [−0.54, 0.22],  I2 = 0%, N = 107) (Fig. 3).

The meta-analyses of MBCT revealed a significant larger but heterogeneous short-term effect than TAU 
(2 RCTs, SMD = −0.89, 95%CI = [−160, −0.18],  I2 = 71%, N = 161) (Fig. 3). At 6 months, a single RCT reported 
persisting longer-term effects as  well81. In comparison to CBT, MBCT did not lead to significantly larger short-
term  effects77. MBCT and psychoeducation at 2, 6, and 12 months did not significantly differ from each  other81.
The meta-analysis of MBSR versus TAU showed a significantly larger short-term effect in favor of MBSR (4 
RCTs, SMD = −1.42, 95%CI = [−2.34, −0.50],  I2 = 88%, N = 218) (Fig. 3). While the heterogeneity could not be 
reduced by excluding individual RCTs, the effect remained significant when excluding the RCTs with unclear/
high risk of detection bias, attrition bias, and other bias. In comparison to CBT, the meta-analysis showed sig-
nificantly lower improvements for MBSR (3 RCTs, SMD = 0.50, 95%CI = [0.23, 0.76],  I2 = 0%, N = 222) (Fig. 1). 
In comparison to psychoeducation, MBSR showed a significantly larger short-term effect (2 RCTs, SMD = −0.66, 
95%CI = [−1.30, −0.03],   I2 = 78%, N = 180) (Fig.  3). The meta-analysis contained considerable heterogeneity 
but could be considered as robust against all risk of bias domains except the risk of performance bias. Detailed 
analyses on patient-rated anxiety is provided in Supplementary Fig. 2.

Depressive  symptoms.  For  depressive  symptoms,  the  meta-analysis  revealed  significantly  higher  short-term 
effects  of  ACT  than  of  TAU  (5  RCTs,  SMD = −0.54,  95%CI = [−0.82,  −0.27],   I2 = 34%,  N = 398),  which  was 
found to be robust against risk of selection bias, detection bias, and other bias. In comparison to CBT (2 RCTs, 
SMD = 0.33,  95%CI = [−0.40,  1.06],   I2 = 76%,  N = 151)  and  less  complex  psychological  interventions  (2  RCTs, 
SMD = 0.02,  95%CI = [−0.36,  0.40],   I2 = 0%,  N = 107),  ACT  did  not  reveal  larger  short-term  effects  (Fig.  3). 
Longer-term effects at 12 months did also not significantly differ from  psychoeducation67.

For MBCT, the meta-analysis did not show significantly higher effects on depressive symptoms against TAU, 
neither at short-term (2 RCTs, SMD = −0.73, 95%CI = [−1.61, 0.15],  I2 = 81%, N = 161) nor at 6  months81. Short- 
and longer-term effects did not differ between MBCT and  CBT77 or  psychoeducation81.

For MBSR, the meta-analysis revealed significantly larger short-term anti-depressive effects against TAU 
(4 RCTs, SMD = −1.13, 95%CI = [−1.96, −0.31],  I2 = 86%, N = 218). The considerable heterogeneity could be 
reduced by excluding one low-quality RCT with the largest effect that compared MBSR to TAU without using 
a waiting  list59. This resulted in still significantly higher short-term effects of MBSR compared to TAU (3 RCTs, 
SMD = −0.58, 95%CI = [−0.87, −0.28],  I2 = 0%, N = 187) (Fig. 3). The effect was robust against risk of detection 
bias, attrition bias, and other bias. In comparison to CBT, no superiority of MBSR on depressive symptoms could 
be detected (3 RCTs, SMD = 0.07, 95%CI = [−0.24, 0.37],  I2 = 23%, N = 222) (Fig. 3). One additional RCT showed 
that MBSR was superior to psychoeducation in reducing short-term depressive  symptoms60. Detailed analyses 
on depression can be found in the Supplementary Fig. 3.

Quality of life.  ACT showed no significantly different short-term effect on quality of life compared to TAU (4 
RCTs, SMD = 0.32, 95%CI = [−0.01, 0.65],  I2 = 42%, N = 271), CBT (2 RCTs, SMD = −0.37, 95%CI = [−0.85, 0.11], 
 I2 = 33%, N = 107) or less complex psychotherapeutic interventions (2 RCTs, SMD = 0.14, 95%CI = [−0.53, 0.82], 
 I2 = 67%, N = 107) (Fig. 3). Longer-term effects of ACT did not significantly differ from those of CBT at 6 and 
12  months61, were reported as significantly higher as those of psychoeducation at 6  months63, but not signifi-
cantly different from those of relaxation at 12  months67.

MBCT was found to be superior to TAU in the short-term (2 RCTs, SMD = 0.43, 95%CI = [0.11, 0.74],  I2 = 0%, 
N = 161) (Fig. 3), but not to  CBT77 or to  psychoeducation81. More detailed analyses can be found in the Sup-
plementary Fig. 4.

Further RCTs reported significantly higher short-term effects on quality of life in favor of MBSR compared 

to TAU 80 but not compared to  CBT73 or  psychoeducation60.

Safety.  Safety data were reported insufficiently (Tab. 2). Fourteen RCTs did not report any information on 
AEs or reasons for study withdrawal. Serious AEs were reported by one RCT in the ACT group (bypass surgery), 
which was highly likely not related to the study  intervention67. Minor AEs were equally distributed between 
experimental and control  groups65,69,73–77,80.

Discussion
Summary  of  evidence.  The  literature  search  revealed  23  RCTs  investigating  the  effectiveness  of  ACT, 
MBCT,  and  MBSR  in  patients  with  DSM-5  anxiety  disorders  such  as  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  Social 
Anxiety Disorder, and mixed samples including different anxiety diagnoses. The meta-analyses revealed at least 
short-term effects on clinician- and patient-rated anxiety for ACT, MBCT and MBSR in addition to TAU versus 
TAU  alone.  In  comparison  to  CBT,  ACT  and  MBCT  showed  comparable  effects  on  both  anxiety  outcomes, 
while MBSR showed significantly lower effects. Pooled effects up to 6 months post randomization can only be 
calculated for ACT but did not show any significant differences compared to TAU or CBT. Short-term effects of 
ACT, MBCT and MBSR on secondary outcomes were superior against TAU but not against CBT or less complex 
psychotherapeutic interventions such as psychoeducation or applied relaxation. Most effects were robust against 
most risk of bias domains. However, the risk of selection bias and performance bias remains unclear or high for 
almost all meta-analyses. Statistical heterogeneity could be reduced in several meta-analyses by excluding low-
quality studies with extreme values. A correlation of those extreme values with funding concerns from industrial

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/companies or private foundations could not be determined. Moreover, comparisons to CBT should be inter-
preted with restraint as the number of included trials was very low and none of the studies tested non-inferiority. 
Adverse events were reported insufficiently. If safety issues were reported, ACT, MBCT, and MBSR did not lead 
to more adverse events than usual care and comparable adverse events to CBT.

In contrast to prior systematic reviews, which found promising effects of mindfulness on anxiety symptoms 
in the general  population13,14,23 and somatically ill  samples15,17, the evidence for patients with manifest DSM-5 
anxiety disorders should be interpreted with restraint. Reasons include the low number of studies investigating 
longer-term effects against eligible control conditions such as CBT, the overall unclear study quality, and the 
often missed systematic assessment and reporting of adverse events.

Limitations.  This meta-analysis has further limitations. We often were not able to pool data of RCTs because 
of non-comparable controls, or could perform sensitivity analyses of comparisons including only 2 RCTs. In 
addition, we were not able to calculate subgroup analyses of different anxiety disorders. Thus, the present meta-
analysis does not allow to draw conclusions for a specific diagnosis. Since risk of publication bias could not be 
assessed, the effects might also be overestimated due to unpublished studies, even if the search of trial registries 
did not result in registered but unpublished  studies82.

Implications for further research.  Further higher-quality trials on mindfulness-based interventions are 
needed to verify the effects in patients with manifest anxiety disorders. Authors should ensure rigorous method-
ology and reporting according to  CONSORT83 and choose adequate control conditions. Recent meta-analyses 
on pharmacological and psychological intervention for anxiety disorders conclude that wait-list control groups 
may produce nocebo effects in trials of  psychotherapy84. TAU, in addition, was also found to be a very hetero-
geneous control condition and anything but usual or standard  care85,86. Psychological placebo effects were esti-
mated on average 0.83 in patients with anxiety  disorders87. Thus, adequate control groups for trials on manifest 
disorders rather than subclinical symptoms should be designed considering nocebo as well as placebo effects. 
Non-inferiority trials against standard psychotherapies such as CBT are missing completely. To enhance study 
quality and reduce the risk of performance bias, even if patients and therapists cannot be blinded, controlling 
for patients’ treatment expectations and their perceptions of quality of the alliance towards the treating thera-
pist would be feasible. Blinding of outcome assessors, especially for clinician-rated outcomes as well as more 
adequate statistics (including intention-to-treat analyses) should be standard. Future studies are requested to 
strictly report AEs and reasons of drop-out.

Conclusions
The evidence suggests clinically relevant short-term anxiolytic effects of acceptance-based and with less extent 
of mindfulness-based interventions when added to usual care that, however, might be a result of nocebo- and/
or placebo effects. The relevance of longer-term effects as well as the comparability to standard CBT remain 
preliminary until further high-quality studies will be published.
