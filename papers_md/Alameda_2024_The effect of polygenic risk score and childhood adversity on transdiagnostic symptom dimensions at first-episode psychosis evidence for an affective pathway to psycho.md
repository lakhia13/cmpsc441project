Childhood adversity is associated with various clinical dimensions in psychosis; however, how genetic vulnerability shapes the
adversity-associated psychopathological signature is yet to be studied. We studied data of 583 First Episode Psychosis (FEP) cases
from the EU-GEI FEP case-control study, including Polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (MDD-PRS), bipolar disorder
(BD-PRS) and schizophrenia (SZ-PRS); childhood adversity measured with the total score of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
(CTQ); and positive, negative, depressive and manic psychopathological domains from a factor model of transdiagnostic
dimensions. Genes and environment interactions were explored as a departure from a multiplicative effect of PRSs and total CTQ on
each dimension. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, 10 PCA, site of recruitment and for medication. A childhood adversity and PRS
multiplicative interaction was observed between A) the CTQ and MDD-PRS on the predominance of positive (β = 0.42, 95%
CI = [0.155, 0.682], p = 0.004); and depressive (β = 0.33, 95% CI = [0.071, 0.591], p = 0.013) dimensions; B) between the CTQ and
BD-PRS on the positive dimension (β = 0.45, 95% CI = [0.106, 0.798], p = 0.010), and C) with the CTQ and SZ-PRS on the positive
dimension (β = −0.34, 95% CI = [−0.660, −0.015], p = 0.040). Bonferroni corrected p-value of signiﬁcance was set at 0.0125. In
conclusion, despite being underpowered, this study suggests that genetic liability for MDD and BD may have a moderating effect
on the sensibility of childhood adversity on depressive and positive psychotic dimensions. This supports the hypothesis of an
affective pathway to psychosis in those exposed to childhood adversity.

INTRODUCTION
Childhood adversity is a well-known environmental risk factor for
mental illness, conferring around a threefold increase in risk of
both affective and psychotic disorders [1–3]. Childhood adversity
is associated with worsening the psychopathological proﬁle [4, 5]
and the functioning of people with a psychotic disorder (PD) [6].
Despite some improvement
the
the biological mechanisms
psychological processed involved,
involving childhood adversity are poorly understood [7, 8].

in the understanding of

The role of genes and their interplay with environmental risk
(here called Gene & Environment Interplay, G&E) has developed
strongly throughout the last 15 years,
including recent studies
exploring interaction of genetic liability in the form of polygenic
risk score (PRS) with environmental
risk factors. PRSs are
calculated by using subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) from large case control genome-wide association studies.
SNPs are selected according to their p-value and weighted by
in an
their effect size to calculate a PRS for each individual
independent validation sample. The PRS can then be tested for its
ability to differentiate between cases and controls in the
validation dataset, and currently account for up to 24%, 20%
and 9% of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression variance
respectively [9–11]. Current meta-analytical evidence so far shows
a very small correlation between schizophrenia PRS (SZ-PRS) and
childhood adversity exposure (gene and environment correlation)
[12], and inconsistent results in terms of interaction [13]. To date,
evidence is mostly based on general population samples, with
only a handful of studies examining people with an actual PD
[14–17]. Moreover, no study to date has examined the role of
genetic liability in interaction with childhood adversity on speciﬁc
psychopathological features of psychosis, which is an important
gap. When exploring G&E interplay by using a broad category of
First Episode of Psychosis (FEP) or PDs, more speciﬁc associations
with psychotic symptom dimensions may be overlooked. This is a
limitation as there is evidence pointing to the presence of speciﬁc
effects between childhood adversity subtypes and clinical
dimensions [5] that could be explained by distinct underlying
mechanism. Furthermore, there is evidence that different clinical
phenotypes within PDs, such as affective psychosis may be more
strongly associated with PRS for depression (MDD-PRS) or for
Bipolar disorder (BD-PRS), than to SZ-PRS; while non-affective
psychosis is more strongly related to SZ-PRS [18]. Thus, using
dimension speciﬁc PRSs associations within the psychosis
spectrum could be a useful tool to explore more in depth the
genetic underpinning of various adversity-related phenotypes
in PDs.

Given the absence of studies exploring the G&E interplay in
clinical dimensions of psychosis and given the suggestive
evidence showing distinct association of various PRSs
in
differentiating clinical phenotypes in psychosis, we planned the
current study. The objective is to test the G&E interaction between
PRS for MDD, BD and SZ and childhood adversity for
the
predominance of positive, negative, depressive and manic
dimensions calculated with a factor model. We hypothesize that
(i) the genetic vulnerability of MDD will interact with childhood
adversity inﬂuencing a clinical proﬁle characterised by a more
pronounced depressive dimension. (ii) genetic vulnerability of BD
will interact with childhood adversity inﬂuencing a clinical proﬁle
characterised by a more pronounced manic dimension; (iii) that
the genetic vulnerability of SCZ will
interact with childhood
adversity inﬂuencing a clinical proﬁle characterised by a more
pronounced positive and negative dimensions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample design and procedures
The current study uses a sample of FEP patients, part of the larger case-
control study EUropean network of national schizophrenia networks

studying Gene- Environment Interactions (EU-GEI)
[19]. While we will
describe the procedure of the main case-control study, only a subset of the
cases will be part of the analyses here presented. FEP patients were
identiﬁed between 2010 and 2015 across six countries to examine
incidence rates of PD and patterns of symptomatology [19]. An extensive
face-to-face assessment was conducted on 1130 FEP and 1497 controls,
and DNA samples were collected for a subset of them (73.6% of the cases
and 78.5% of the controls). Broadly, this sample was judged to be
representative of the population living in each catchment area by age, sex
and ethnic group as detailed in the Supplementary Material (SM) and
previously shown [19, 20]. FEP patients were included in the case–control
study if meeting the following criteria during the recruitment period: (a)
age between 18 and 64 years; (b) presentation to the mental healthcare
services with a clinical diagnosis of and minimally treated for a FEP; (c)
residency within the catchment area. Exclusion criteria were: previous
diagnosis and/or treatment for a psychotic disorder; a diagnosis of organic
psychosis (ICD-10: F09); or transient psychotic symptoms resulting from
acute intoxication (ICD- 10: F1X.5); language barriers.

Brieﬂy, patients were identiﬁed by clinically trained researchers who
carried out regular checks across the 17 catchment areas. The diagnosis was
conﬁrmed by the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic and Affective
Illness (OPCRIT) within the EU-GEI consortium [21, 22], which also allowed to
create dimensional scores (details below and in SM). As described by Gayer-
Anderson et al. [19], research teams included trained research nurses and
clinical psychologists and were overseen by a psychiatrist with experience in

lected using the Medical Research Council
(MRC) Socio-demographic
Schedule modiﬁed version [24], and supplemented with additional
information from medical records on educational attainment, employment,
marital and living status. Ethnicity was self-ascribed using categories
employed by the 2001 UK Census (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-
method/census/census-2001/index.html), but genetic ancestry (ethnicity
genetically driven) was also created using Principal Component Analyses
(PCA, see below).

Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). CTQ [25, 26] was used to measure
the exposure to past experiences of abuse (sexual, physical, and emotional)
and neglect (physical and emotional). This self-report instrument contains
28 questions covering multiple questions enquiring on experiences of
abuse and neglect occurring prior to the age of 18, with answers ranging
‘often true’, to
from ‘never true’, through ‘rarely true’,
‘very true’. Given our limited sample size not allowing the exploration of
speciﬁc subtypes, a broad composite measure of CTQ total score was
calculated by adding up the trauma scores to a total score (ranging from 0
- no exposure-, up to 140 - maximum possible score-). A recent review
shows that is the most commonly used instrument in this ﬁeld [27].

OPCRIT and Diagnostic procedure. We made DSM-IV diagnoses [28] from
interviews and mental health records utilizing the Operational Criteria
Checklist (OPCRIT) at baseline [22] by centrally trained investigators, whose
reliability was assessed throughout the study (κ = 0.7), as detailed in SM. In
brief, OPCRIT is semi-structured checklist including 92 items covering
mental health clinical background and psychopathology. These derived
diagnoses were grouped into Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) (or
non-affective disorders) group (codes 295.1–295.9 and 297.1–298.9) or
Affective Disorder (AP) group (patients diagnosed with codes 296–296.9),
and which included patients with bipolar disorder
(codes
296.0–296.06 and 296.4–296.89) and major depression with psychotic
features (MDD-P, codes 296.2–296.36).

Bi-factor dimensional models of psychopathology. Beside the creation of
the diagnostic categories, OPCRIT data was also used to delineate the
psychopathological dimensions. Using item response modelling in Mplus,
version 7.4, two separate bi-factor models of psychopathology were
estimated based on the associations among ratings of psychotic symptoms
in patients and controls which were dichotomised as 0 ‘absent’ or
1 ‘present’. This methodology is described in full in earlier EU-GEI papers on
transdiagnostic dimensions [21] and it has been used in other EU-GEI
publications [29, 30]. Brieﬂy, the estimation of the ﬁve speciﬁc symptom
dimensions’ scores (positive, negative, disorganisation, mania and depres-
sion) were available alongside a general dimension, and were derived from
a bifactor model built using multidimensional item response modelling
from the 59 items describing psychopathology in OPCRIT. Various model ﬁt
statistics were used to prove the reliability and strength of the model
proving the validity of the bi-factor model used [21] and statistical details
about the model is described in full in a previous study [21]. These scores
reﬂect how psychopathological items aggregate contributing to particular
factors and should be interpreted as a predominance of a particular
dimensional proﬁle, and not symptoms severity such as that of the Positive
and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [31].

In the current study we focused on the positive, negative, depressive
and manic dimensions in line with the available PRS of SZ, MDD and BD
respectively.

Genotyping. DNA from blood or saliva were obtained at baseline in 73.6%
of cases from the entire EUGEI-Work package two sample [19]. The DNA
collected was genotyped at the MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics
and Genomics in Cardiff (UK) using a custom Illumina HumanCoreExome-
24 BeadChip genotyping array, with quality control performed locally as
previously described [32]. A PCA generating 10 principal components (PC)
was run on pruned variants to control for population stratiﬁcation as
detailed in the SM. Following the same procedures previously published
[32], PRS for SZ, BD and depression (SZ-PRS, BD-PRS and MDD-PRS) were
built on PRSice2 [33] using data from the largest GWAS available
[11, 34, 35], at the p-value threshold 0.05 that better predicted most
phenotypes in the original GWAS publications. Each PRS was standardized
to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.

As previously described in previous papers by our group [18], one of the
limitations when building current PRSs, which are derived from mostly
is their reduced predictive power in multi-ethnic
European samples,
samples [36]. This has been shown in a previous study on FEP patients [37],
where PRS-SZ had much lower predictive power in the African ancestry
population.
In light with this, we constrained the sample to those
categorised as of European ancestry based on PCA (details provided in SM)
for the scope of the present study.

Statistical analyses
Only participants who had complete data on PRS, childhood adversity
using the CTQ, OPCRIT data and identiﬁed as white European ancestry
based on PCA data were included for
this article.
Comparisons between FEP participants that were included and those
excluded were examined (Table S1, SM).

We described sociodemographic using frequencies, percentages,
mean and standard deviations (SD) using Chi-square and Student t test
as appropriate. Interactions between CTQ and PRSs (MDD-PRS, BD-PRS
and SZ-PRS) on symptom dimensions were explored as a departure from
a multiplicative effect. More speciﬁcally, we run four independent linear
regression models with each dimension as dependent variable,
including the three PRSs, the CTQ total score, and its product with each
PRS; adjusted for sex, age, site, 10 PCs and the interaction with each PRS
and total CTQ score [38, 39]. Assumption for regression analyses were
also checked and found satisfying. To control for multiple testing (one

was set at <0.0125 (0.05/4 = 0.0125). p-values between 0.0125 and 0.05
were considered as trend level in the reported results. We conducted a
series of sensitivity analyses to account for medication effect consisting
of comparison of mean CTQ scores in those taking four main types of
drugs (benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood
stabilisers) and those being medication free in order to understand
whether people with high adveristy scores tended to be more
represented among those taking medication. Whenever CTQ scores
were different according to exposure to any medication,
further
sensitivity analyses were conducted adjusting each main model by
medication use in addition to the primary analyses. Analyses were
conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Version 26.0
(SPSS Inc) and STATA Software.

RESULTS
Demographic overview of the sample
The sample characteristics of the ﬁnal analyzed sample of 583 FEP
patients are shown in Table 1 (ﬂow chart with detail on exclusions
are in SM), which proved to be similar to those FEP not included in
terms of age and sex but tended to have fewer years of education
(p < 0.001), lower CTQ total scores (p = 0.01) and were more often
diagnosed with psychotic depression (p = 0.02) (SM Table S1). The
mean age of the included patients was 31.79 ± 10.96, 63% of them
were male. The mean years of education was 12.86 ± 4.02; with
diagnoses distributed as 43% of schizophrenia, 4.3% schizoaffec-
tive disorder, 12% bipolar disorder with psychotic features, 14.6%
major depression with psychotic features and 25% had other
diagnoses (i.e. brief psychotic episode, schizophreniform disorder
or psychosis non otherwise speciﬁed).

Childhood adversity scores and symptom dimensions
No signiﬁcant associations were found between CTQ total score
and the symptom dimensions (positive; β = −0.05, 95% CI =
[−0.168, 0.072], p = 0.466; negative β = 0.00, 95% CI = [−0.117,
0.119], p = 0.990; manic β = 0.05, 95% CI = [−0.071, 0.174]
p = 0.441 or depressive β = 0.09; 95% CI = [−0.018, 0.218],
p = 0.099).

Depression polygenic risk score, childhood adversity and
symptom dimensions
MDD-PRS showed a signiﬁcant association with the positive
dimension (β = −0.48; 95% CI = [−0.765, −0.200], p = 0.002), and

(β = 0.19, 95% CI = [−0.165, 0.551], p = 0.291), or the depressive
dimension (β = −0.10, 95% CI = [−460, 0.259], p = 0.608). At the
level of interactions, a trend-level negative interaction was found
between childhood adversity and SZ-PRS on the predominance of
the positive dimension (β = −0.34, 95% CI = [−0.660, −0.015],
p = 0.040). No interaction effects were found for the manic, the
depressive or negative dimensions with SZ-PRS and CTQ (Table 2
and Fig. 1).

Sensitivity analyses adjusted by medication
Mean CTQ scores by medication status (being currently medicated
or not) for various medication (antipsychotics, benzodiazepines,
mood stabilized and antidepressants) are shown in SM (Table S2).
In brief, these analyses showed that patients taking antipsychotics
tended to have higher scores of CTQ, although this was not
signiﬁcant when adjusted by multiple correction (p = 0.020;
multiple corrected p-value set at 0.012). Nevertheless, we
conducted the interaction analyses also adjusting for antipsycho-
tic medication with effect sizes and p-values changing only
marginally (details can be found in Table S3 in SM), allowing to
conclude that medication was not a source of confounding. .

DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst study in FEP examining the interaction between
childhood adversity and PRSs of SZ, BD and MDD in relation to clinical
dimensions. To the best of our knowledge this has never been done
in other psychiatric disorders either. Our main ﬁndings suggest a
relationship between childhood adversity and positive and depressive
symptoms of psychosis moderated by the polygenic load for major
mental illnesses. In line with our hypothesis, we found that those with
a high MDD-PRS and with a history of childhood adversity were more
likely to have a clinical proﬁle characterised by the depressive
symptoms (ß = 0.33). Interestingly, this was also the case for positive
dimensions (ß = 0.42). On the other hand, no evidence was found to
support our hypotheses that a genetic vulnerability for BD and
exposure to childhood adversity would moderate the sensibility of
childhood adversity on the expression of manic symptoms; rather BP-
PRS seemed also moderate the expression of positive symptoms of
psychosis in those with childhood adversity (ß = 0.45). These two
ﬁndings support an affective pathway to psychosis where genetic
vulnerability for depression and bipolar disorder inﬂuence the positive
symptoms domain of psychosis. Unexpectedly, SZ-PRS and childhood
adversity interactions did not play role in the predominance of
positive dimension (ß = −0.34).

As stated above, our ﬁndings shed new light on the “Affective
pathway to psychosis” hypothesis, showing that MDD and BD PRS
interact with CTQ on the predominance of a clinical proﬁle
characterised by positive symptoms. This model usually focuses on
mediation rather than moderation and postulates that low mood
and other mood related attributes such as anxiety, are mediators
between social adversity and psychosis [7, 40–42]. To the best of our
knowledge this is the ﬁrst study to explore whether genetic
vulnerability for depression moderates the effect of childhood
adversity on psychopathology in patients with FEP. This supports
that depressive mood may not only be a mediator, but also that at a
genetic level, vulnerability for depression moderates the adversity-
psychosis dyad. There is evidence suggesting that
low level
depressive symptoms (at a sub-diagnostic level) are important for
the aetiopathogenesis of psychosis and outcome, as they con-
tributes to impairment in reality testing therefore contributing to the
emergence of low level symptoms of psychosis [43] and psychosis

onset [43]. Furthermore, subclinical depressive symptoms often
precede relapse during the course of psychosis and play a role in
functional outcomes [44, 45] and of course suicidality [43, 46].
Beyond the suggested importance of assessing subthreshold
depressive symptoms for these reasons, our ﬁndings also suggest
that considering genetic load for depression may be a marker for a
more severe psychopathological proﬁle in people with psychosis
and trauma. Of course, the currently availably PRSs still explain a
relatively small proportion of the variance and therefore more
powerful MDD and BD GWAS are needed to allow translating their
biological importance into a useful biomarker for clinical practice
[47].

Our ﬁndings on the negative interaction found for childhood
adversity with SZ- PRS on positive symptoms should be interpreted
cautiously as results did not survive to Bonferroni correction. A
possible explanation is that the inﬂuence of childhood adversity on
the positive domain for those with a high genetic vulnerability
schizophrenia is low due to a “ceiling effects”; while the role of
adversity have more relative weigh in those of a lower genetic risk.
In a recently published meta-analysis on various adversities and
psychopathological dimensions in psychosis we found that neglect,
but not abuse, is associated with more severe positive symptoms [5];
with our current ﬁndings suggesting that that association seems to
not be moderated by genetic vulnerability.

Study limitations and methodological considerations
Childhood adversity was reported retrospectively, with the
inherent weakness of the retrospective design when examining
traumatic events in people with psychosis due to recall biais [48].
However, a recent study suggests that that subjective reports of
exposure to trauma are relevant
for cognition impairment,
therefore supporting the use of retrospective self-reports [49].

Secondly,
adversities such as bullying. Third, the number of cases included
was
the number of comparisons we
conducted, which may have limited the statistical power and
made some of our ﬁnding nonsigniﬁcant. Although we
interpreted the ﬁndings based on the direction and magnitude
of the associations and interactions, overall,
it is essential to
point out that the study is underpowered and that larger studies
on the topic are needed to conﬁrm our claims, that remain
tentative. Lastly, it should be noted that the OPCRIT scores built
with a factorial analysis are not intended to represent a severity
score, such as that of the PANSS or similar scales [31], but as a
score that reﬂects how psychopathological
items aggregate
contributing to particular factors. The scores we use should be
interpreted as a “predominance” of a particular dimensional
proﬁle, and not
therefore
comparisons with studies that use a severity score is not possible.
For example, none of our analyses on CTQ and the dimensions
were signiﬁcant, which means that CTQ (in the absence of
genetic vulnerability) is not associated with the predominance of
any speciﬁc clinical domain in our sample. This is not line with
previous work examining the association between trauma and
severity of symptoms [5]. This lack of association could be
explained by the fact that as our dimensional scores capture the
“predominance” of one dimension over the others, and the role
of trauma measured with a composite category is broad and
transdiagnostic (inﬂuences in similar ways various symptoms).
Those considerations aside, we believe this approach has great
value because symptoms do not occur in isolation and tend to
aggregate (for example delusions often co-occur with hallucina-
tions), therefore it can be seen as a more realistic representation
of the various clinical pictures of the heterogeneous psychosis
phenotype.
