Abstract

Recent advances in the developmental epidemiology, neurobiology and treatment of pediatric 
anxiety disorders have increased our understanding of these conditions and herald improved 
outcomes for affected children and adolescents. This article reviews the current epidemiology, 
longitudinal trajectory, and neurobiology of anxiety disorders in youth. Additionally, we 
summarize the current evidence for both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatments 
of fear-based anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized, social and separation anxiety disorders) in 
children and adolescents. Current data suggest that these disorders begin in childhood and 
adolescence, exhibit homotypic continuity and increase the risk of secondary anxiety and mood 
disorders. Psychopharmacologic trials involving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) are effective in pediatric 
patients with anxiety disorders and have generally demonstrated moderate effect sizes. 
Additionally, current data support cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are efficacious in the 
treatment of these conditions in youth and that combination of CBT + an SSRI may be associated 
with greater improvement than would be expected with either treatment as monotherapy.

Introduction

Page 2

Affecting between 15-20% of youth, anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent 
psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents [1,2]. Moreover, from a public health 
standpoint, these disorders, when present in youth, increase the risk of suicide attempts [3,4] 
and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Additionally, longitudinal data 
suggest that anxiety disorders in youth predict a range of psychiatric disorders later in life, 
including other anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and depression [5,6].

To date, most treatment studies of pediatric anxiety disorders have largely focused on 
anxiety symptoms as a homogenous entities and, as such, many psychopharmacologic 
treatment investigations have included individuals with “pediatric anxiety disorder triad” 
disorders (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder [GAD], social phobia [SoP]/social anxiety 
disorder and separation anxiety disorder [SAD]). It is further noteworthy that accumulating 
clinical, phenomenologic, epidemiologic data support this classification. Specifically, the 
“triad anxiety disorders” frequently co-occur [7] exhibit very similar trajectories [8] share 
neurophysiology [9,10] and respond similarly to both psychotherapeutic and 
psychopharmacologic treatments (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) and 
cognitive behavioral psychotherapy [11].

Herein, we will review the developmental epidemiology, neurobiology, assessment and 
treatment (both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic) of youth with anxiety 
disorders as well as recent, long-term treatment data and emerging data concerning 
predictors of treatment response. Ultimately, to achieve the optimal outcome in any 
individual child or adolescent, a personalized approach is necessary, based on as much 
knowledge as possible of the developmental epidemiology, the personal and family history, 
signs and symptoms, pathophysiology, clinical phenotype, comorbidities, as well as the 
family, home and school environment. Frequently, these data will result in a multi-pronged 
approach to treatment—which may include one or more psychopharmacologic or 
psychotherapeutic interventions.

Developmental Epidemiology and Course of Pediatric Anxiety Disorders

Accumulating data—from both retrospective and prospective studies—suggest that anxiety 
disorders are both the most frequent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and 
represent the “earliest of all forms of psychopathology” [12]. Mostly due to the frequent, 
early emerging specific phobias, the onset of the first or any anxiety disorder is usually in 
childhood, and thus, considerably earlier than the onset of depressive or substance use 
disorders (Figure 1A). However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the onset of the 
specific anxiety disorders with GAD, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive 
disorder (OCD) mostly emerging in adolescence (Figure 1B). Overall, anxiety disorders are 
more prevalent in girls compared to boys, although it is noteworthy that sex differences are 
accentuated by development, with prevalence ratios reaching 2-3:1 by adolescence 
[2,6,13,14].

Although anxiety disorders with onset in childhood or adolescence may spontaneously 
remit, the course of pediatric anxiety disorders is overall considered to be chronic-and

persistent. This is due to evidence from several decades of data suggesting that anxiety 
disorders in childhood or adolescence strongly predict the presence of the same condition 
(homotypic continuity) in later in life [6,15-18]. The individual course, however, is often 
“waxing and waning” and “syndrome shifts” to other anxiety syndromes frequently occur 
[19]. The presence of “pure” anxiety disorders decreases with age in favor of patterns with 
multiple anxiety disorders, and by late adolescence or early adulthood, secondary 
psychopathology, such as depressive or substance use disorders have frequently developed 
(heterotypic continuity) [6,16,20-23]. Thus, early anxiety manifestations are at the outset of 
a “cascade of psychopathology” suggesting the need for early recognition and treatment 
[24,25]. In addition to adverse long-term psychopathological outcomes, child and adolescent 
anxiety disorders were linked with poor long-term functioning and general health as well as 
interpersonal, financial, and educational difficulties [17,26] in addition to suicidality [17,27].

Neurobiology of Pediatric Anxiety Disorder

Considerable advances have been made in the understanding of the neurobiology of 
pediatric anxiety disorders over the past decade (for reviews see [9,28]). In general, these 
studies implicate dysfunction in prefrontal-amygdala based circuits, although, a myriad of 
both functional and structural neuroimaging studies reveal dysfunction (or abnormalities) in 
default mode networks and posterior structures, including the posterior cingulate, precuneus 
and cuneus (Figure 2). Among the structures which are most frequently implicated in the 
pathophysiology of pediatric anxiety disorders, the amygdala—which is charged with the 
initiation of central fear responses—is frequently “overactivated” in functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of youth with fear-based anxiety disorders. However, the 
implication of the amygdala-based dysfunction extends beyond its activity and functional 
responsiveness to its connectivity. In this regard, intrinsic functional connectivity networks, 
including connectivity to the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and 
cerebellum have been described. In addition to the amygdala, the ventrolateral prefrontal 
cortex has been examined in numerous studies of youth with fear-based anxiety disorders. 
Importantly, this structure regulates amygdala activity and plays a pivotal role in extinction 
in the context of fear conditioning and responds in tandem with the amygdala to emotional 
probes. It is further noteworthy that this structure may serve a lynchpin function in pediatric 
anxiety disorders. As such, the VLPFC is not only hyperactivated in youth with anxiety 
disorders, but the degree of activation is inversely proportional to the severity of anxiety 
symptoms, consistent with the notion that the VLPFC plays compensatory role in youth with 
anxiety (for review see [9]). Consistent with this notion, fluoxetine and cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (CBT) are associated with increases in activity of this structure in adolescents with 
anxiety [29]. Finally, the cingulate cortex which girdles the limbic system and subserves 
motivation and cognitive control is hyperactivated in youth with anxiety disorders [30] and 
that glutamatergic tone within the anterior cingulate cortex directly correlates with the 
severity of anxiety in adolescents with GAD [31].

Screening and Assessment

Current practice parameters from the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry 
[32] recommend screening for anxiety symptoms, rating the severity of the anxiety

symptoms and functional impairment in youth with anxiety disorders and carefully assessing 
for co-morbid psychiatric conditions as well as for general medical conditions (e.g., 
hyperthyroidism) that may mimic anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the evaluation of the 
pediatric patient with suspected anxiety should allow anxiety disorders to be differentiated 
from developmentally appropriate worries, fears, and responses to stressors. Additionally, 
stressors or traumas should be considered to determine their contribution to the development 
or maintenance of anxiety symptoms. Finally, it is critical to consider that anxiety-related 
symptoms such as crying, irritability, or tantrums and be misinterpreted by adults as 
oppositionality or disobedience; these behaviors represent the child’s distress and efforts to 
avoid the anxiety-provoking stimulus.

Several well-studied child self-report screening measures for anxiety exist and may be used 
in patients >8 years of age. First, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children [33], and 
the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) [34], and the 
Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS) [35] were developed to be sensitive and specific 
for assessing anxiety in youth and are useful in clinical practice to monitor treatment 
progress [36]. The Preschool Anxiety Scale is a parent report adapted from the SCAS that 
was developed for screening for anxiety in young children (ages 2.5 to 6.5). The SCARED 
and SCAS are available online/free access. Second, the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, 
which is frequently utilized as a primary or secondary outcome measure in 
psychopharmacologic trials of youth, is a clinician-rated measure used to assess the severity 
of anxiety symptoms and change over time [37]. Third, with regard to social phobia or social 
anxiety, the Social Anxiety Scale, the Social Worries Questionnaire, and the social phobia 
subscale of SCARED are brief screening measures for social phobia/social anxiety 
symptoms. Fourth, a set of novel dimensional anxiety scales was recently generated during 
the DSM revision process to support clinical decision-making and monitoring treatment 
progress (www.psychiatry.org/dsm5). These self-rated scales can be used for children aged 
11 or older and comprise the core constructs of fear and anxiety together with cognitive, 
physical and behavioral symptoms in a consistent and brief way, using a common template 
for each of the anxiety disorders [38].

Psychological Treatments

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Well-regarded as an effective evidence-based treatment for childhood anxiety disorders, 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has several key components: psychoeducation of child 
and caregivers regarding the nature of anxiety; techniques for managing somatic reactions 
including relaxation training and diaphragmatic breathing; cognitive restructuring by 
identifying and challenging anxiety-provoking thoughts; practicing problem-solving for 
coping with anticipated challenges; systematic exposure to feared situations or stimuli, 
including imaginal, simulated, and in vivo methods, with special focus on desensitization to 
feared stimuli; and relapse prevention plans [36]. To date, a few studies have evaluated the 
efficacy of CBT either alone or in combination with psychopharmacologic treatment for 
childhood anxiety disorders [7,39]. In a large, multisite study of youth with moderate to 
severe GAD, SoP and SAD, the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), 488

children and adolescents (aged 7-17 years) were randomized to one of three treatment 
groups (sertraline monotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], or sertraline + CBT) 
for 12 weeks [7]. In terms of clinical improvement and symptom severity, all treatment 
groups were superior to placebo (24%), and the combination therapy (sertraline + CBT) was 
significantly more efficacious (81%) than either group treated with either medication (55%) 
or CBT (60%) alone. The 24- and 36-week follow-ups in CAMS revealed over 80% of acute 
responders maintained their positive response at both 24 and 36-weeks [40]. During the 
follow-up period, participants continued in active treatment with sertraline, CBT booster 
sessions or both. Finally, the naturalistic 6-year follow-up study of this sample (n=288) 
revealed that these treatment effects were durable and sustained, with remission rates of 
48.8%, 51.9%, and 45.8% for combination therapy, sertraline only, and CBT only, 
respectively [41]. Alternatively, nearly half of the acute responders relapsed during the 
follow-up period. The authors argue that many youth with anxiety disorders require 
intensive or extended treatment to maintain acute treatment gains [41].

Beidel and colleagues [39] evaluated the efficacy of Social Effectiveness Therapy for 
Children (SET-C) versus fluoxetine or placebo in children and adolescents aged 7-17 with 
social phobia. SET-C was more effective than placebo on primary outcome measures and 
specific symptom measures. Additionally, SET-C was superior to fluoxetine in terms of rate 
of treatment response (79% versus 36.4%, p<0.001), lack of posttreatment diagnosis, and 
higher end-state functioning [39]. Finally, CBT has now been examined in very young 
children with anxiety disorders [42]. Sixty four pre-schoolers, aged 4-7 years, were 
randomized to a parent-child CBT intervention or a monitoring-only control condition for a 
duration of six months. The response rate of children in the CBT group (defined as much or 
very much improved on the CGI-Anxiety scale) was 69%, compared to 32% for children in 
the control group. Additionally, 59% of children CBT-treated were free of all anxiety 
diagnoses following treatment (vs 18% of controls) [42].

Mindfulness-Based Psychotherapies

Mindfulness, the “the intentional, accepting, and non-judgmental focus of one’s attention on 
the emotions, thoughts, and sensations occurring in the present moment” [43], has been 
utilized as the basis for a myriad of programs over the last several decades to promote health 
and well-being in both adults and youth with anxiety disorders. Two approaches in 
particular have been used to increase psychological health: MBSR (mindfulness-based stress 
reduction) and MBCT (mindfulness based cognitive behavioral therapy) [44]. Both MBCT 
and MBSR use regular mindfulness meditation practices to develop mindfulness skills. 
Moreover, these psychotherapeutic interventions show promise for the treatment of anxiety 
disorders. In this regard, randomized, controlled trials in anxious adults have shown 
statistically significant improvement in symptoms of GAD [45-47], social anxiety [48-50], 
specific phobia [51], and panic disorder [45]. Mindfulness-based interventions have also 
shown effective in studies looking at a heterogeneous group of anxiety disorders [52,53]. At 
least one study has shown mindfulness to be as effective as CBT for social anxiety disorder 
[54].

In children and adolescents, studies of mindfulness-based interventions have been more 
limited. Catani et al. [55] found meditation-based relaxation to be as effective as trauma-
focused CBT in the treatment of children with PTSD from war and tsunami in Sri-Lanka. 
Lierh & Diaz [56] found a mindfulness intervention to be effective in decreasing symptoms 
of anxiety and depression in a group of minority children. Other studies have shown 
effectiveness of mindfulness-based treatments in a variety of mental health problems in 
children [44] and open-label studies suggest that group-based MCBT may be effective for 
the treatment of adolescents with generalized, social or separation anxiety disorders who are 
at risk for developing bipolar disorder. Given the acceptability and tolerability of 
mindfulness-based interventions, as well as their demonstrated effectiveness thus far, such 
treatments for anxiety in children is an exciting area that warrants further investigation.

Psychodynamic Psychotherapy

Psychodynamic psychotherapy has been evaluated in youth with anxiety disorders and 
recently subjected controlled trials. In one trial of 4-10 year old children with anxiety 
disorders [57], using a quasi-experimental wait-list children (N=30) with were treated with 
20-25 sessions of manualized, short-term Psychoanalytic Child Therapy (PaCT). In this 
study 67% of patients no longer met criteria for any anxiety disorder compared to 0 children 
in the wait-list group. In parallel, internalizing and total problems significantly declined 
during treatment and gains were maintained at 6 months, post-treatment [57]. Fonagy and 
Target [58] examined the effect of intensity of psychodynamic psychotherapy. In this 
sample of 763 patients at the Anna Freud Center, several disorders were associated with 
differential responses with regard to the intensity of psychotherapy. Specifically, 
overanxious disorder—the DSM-III forerunner of GAD—responded better to high intensity 
psychotherapy, but similar differences in effect were not observed for simple phobias or 
separation anxiety disorder.

Psychopharmacologic Interventions

The aggressive evaluation of serotonergic antidepressants in youth with anxiety disorders is 
consistent with the evidence that these medications dampen fear responses in pre-clinical 
models of anxiety [59], and is likely driven by evidence supporting their use in adults with 
anxiety disorders as well as by their evidence for related psychiatric syndromes in youth, 
including major depressive disorder, with which anxiety disorders often co-occur.

Fluoxetine

Fluoxetine reduces anxiety in youth with triad anxiety disorders (mean age: 11.8±3 years, 
N=74) over the course of 12 weeks of treatment [60]. In this trial, fluoxetine was initiated at 
10 mg/day and titrated to a maximum fixed-dosage of 20 mg/day following the first week of 
treatment. Fluoxetine demonstrated significant improvement in anxiety symptoms and was 
generally well-tolerated. Adverse effects reported include nausea, abdominal pain, 
drowsiness and headaches. Additionally, Beidel and colleagues [39] examined the efficacy 
of fluoxetine and Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C) in a 12-week, placebo-
controlled study in youth (mean age: 11.6±2.6 years, N=122) with SoP (primary diagnosis). 
Patients were treated with fluoxetine (n=33), SET-C (n=57) or placebo (n=32) and

fluoxetine was initiated at 10 mg/day (2 weeks), then titrated, sequentially, to 40 mg daily. 
Fluoxetine was superior to placebo and SET-C was statically superior to both fluoxetine and 
placebo. In terms of side effects in this trial of social phobia patients, only nausea occurred 
more frequently in patients receiving fluoxetine.

Fluvoxamine

Fluvoxamine has been examined in children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years, N=128) with 
mixed anxiety disorders (GAD, SoP and/or SAD) in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-
controlled study [61]. Fluvoxamine-treated patients exhibited a statistically significant 
improvement in PARS score compared to youth receiving placebo. Fluvoxamine was well-
tolerated, and there were no statistically significant differences in adverse events between 
placebo-treated patients and those receiving fluvoxamine.

Paroxetine

Sertraline

Wagner and colleagues [62] treated children with SoP, aged 8-17 years, with flexibly dosed 
paroxetine over the course of a 16-week, multi-center, parallel group study. Paroxetine was 
initiated at 10 mg/day and then flexibly dosed to a maximum of 50 mg/day. Patients 
receiving paroxetine exhibited a greater response rate (CGI-I: 77.6% of the paroxetine-
treated vs. 33.8% of placebo-treated patients, p<0.001) and, in this sample, paroxetine was 
well-tolerated. However, decreased appetite, vomiting and insomnia were observed and 4 
paroxetine-treated patients (and 0 placebo-treated patients) experienced emotional lability 
and suicidal ideation.

One 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of children and adolescents with GAD, 
aged 5-17 years examined the efficacy of fixed-dose treatment with sertraline [63]. In this 
trial, sertraline was initiated at 25 mg/day for 1 week and then increased to 50 mg/day for 
the subsequent 8-weeks. Sertraline treatment was associated with statistically significant 
improvements in anxiety symptoms (Hamilton Anxiety Scale Score (HAM-A), lower 
symptom severity (i.e., lower CGI-S scores) as well as greater improvement (i.e., higher 
CGI-I scores). In this study, there were no significant differences in adverse events between 
sertraline- and placebo-treated patients. Walkup and colleagues examined the efficacy of 
sertraline in the Child-Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) [7], which involved a 
sample of 488 children and adolescent, aged 7-17 years, with GAD, SoP or SAD or a 
combination of these disorders, who received sertraline (n=133), cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT, n=139), a combination of the sertraline and CBT (n=140) or placebo (n=76) 
over the course of 12 weeks. Sertraline + CBT (81%) was statistically superior to sertraline 
monotherapy (55%) and CBT monotherapy (60%) in terms of clinical improvement (i.e., 
CGI-I score) and symptom severity (i.e., PARS score). Additionally, sertraline and CBT 
monotherapy were superior to placebo (24%). Recently, the long-term extension study of 
CAMS was published—Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long-term Study 
(CAMELS) [41], in which 288 of the original 488 CAMS participants who were followed 
longitudinally. Patients who responded to acute treatment were more likely to be in

remission and to have lower PARS scores. Also, of clinical importance, 50% of responders 
to acute treatment—regardless of type—achieved remission over the follow-up interval.

Venlafaxine

Duloxetine

Venlafaxine ER was evaluated in youth with GAD and SoP. In an 8-week, multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients, aged 6-17 years with GAD 
(N=320) [64]. Over the course of treatment GAD symptoms significantly improved relative 
to placebo and side effects were consistent with the known side effect profile of venlafaxine 
and included anorexia and somnolence, increases in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as 
weight loss. Also, 2 patients who received venlafaxine (compared to 0 patients receiving 
placebo) reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt. March and colleagues [65] examined 
venlafaxine ER in children and adolescents with SoP. This double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial studied a 16-week course of venlafaxine in children and adolescents (aged 8-17 years, 
mean age: 13.6±3.0 years, N= 293,). Venlafaxine was initiated at 37.5 mg/day and titrated 
according to body weight to an average of 2.6-3.0 mg/kg (maximum dose: 225 mg/day for 
patients ≥50 kg). Efficacy measures included the Social Anxiety Scale, child or adolescent 
version (SAS-CA) and CGI-I. Venlafaxine-treated patients exhibited significant 
improvements in SoP symptoms compared to placebo-treated patients. Adverse effects of 
venlafaxine included weight loss (secondary to anorexia), nausea and dizziness. Further, 3 
venlafaxine-treated patients (compared to 0 placebo-treated patients) developed suicidal 
ideation, although no suicides or suicide attempts occurred.

Strawn and colleagues [66] evaluated the efficacy of duloxetine in a double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial of children and adolescents with GAD, aged 7-17 years (N=272) over the 
course of 10 weeks. In this study, PARS severity for GAD scores as well as total PARS 
score, CGAS, CGI-I and CGI-S scores all improved over the course of treatment and this 
medication was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for 
the treatment of GAD in youth aged 7-17 years. Significant side effects included nausea, 
vomiting, decreased appetite, dizziness, cough, oropharyngeal pain and palpitations.

Recently, all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of SSRI/SSNRIs in 
pediatric patients with fear-based anxiety disorders, were subjected to a meta analysis [67]. 
This meta-analytic evaluation suggests a modest effect size (Cohen’s d=0.62) and 
importantly, suggests that SSRIs may not be associated with a statistically significant risk of 
suicidality in pediatric patients with anxiety disorders. Moreover, in this meta-analysis of 
1,673 patients, antidepressant treatment did not appear to be associated with an increase in 
all cause discontinuation (p=0.132). Nonetheless, treatment-emergent activation was more 
commonly associated with antidepressants (compared to placebo), although this only 
trended towards statistical significance (p=0.05) [67].

Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)

Prior the availability of newer antidepressant medications, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) 
were frequently utilized for pediatric anxiety disorders, however, their role has subsequently 
been supplanted by the SSRIs and SSNRIs. Moreover, controlled trials of TCAs for youth

with anxiety disorders have yielded conflicting results (Table 1). Specifically, 
clomipramine, which is efficacious in randomized, controlled trials of pediatric patients with 
OCD, only 1 randomized controlled trial exists for pediatric anxiety disorders. Moreover, 
the anticholinergic side effects, need for frequent cardiac monitoring, lethality in overdose, 
have limited their use clinically in pediatric populations.

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines bind to the GABAA receptor and in doing so potentiate the effects of the 
endogenous, inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Thus, it is not 
surprising that for nearly two decades, benzodiazepines have been used to treat anxiety 
symptoms in youth. However, to date, the evidence for or against the use of benzodiazepines 
in pediatric patients with anxiety disorders has been limited to randomized, controlled 
studies in surprisingly few patients.

The efficacy of benzodiazepines in anxious youth has been evaluated in two randomized 
clinical trials. In youth with GAD, aged 8-17 years (mean age: 12.6 years, N=30), who were 
treated with alprazolam (or placebo), no statistically significant differences were observed in 
anxiety symptoms or in clinical global improvement between alprazolam-treated and 
placebo-treated youth [68]. However, alprazolam was associated with fatigue and dry-
mouth. Additionally, Graae and colleagues [69] assessed the efficacy of clonazepam in 
pediatric patients with SoP and/or GAD (aged: 7-13 years, N=15). Clonazepam reduced 
anxiety symptoms to comparable levels as placebo, and no differences were detected in 
CGI-I scores between benzodiazepine- and placebo-treated youth. Finally, side effects, 
including irritability, drowsiness, and ‘oppositional behavior’ were common.

Other medications

The 5-HT1A agonist buspirone has been evaluated in a large, unpublished, study of pediatric 
patients with GAD who were aged 6-17 years (N=559). In this 6-week, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial (Bristol-Meyers Squibb, 2010), patients were treatment with 
buspirone 15-60 mg/day (divided BID) and no statistically significant differences between 
buspirone and placebo were observed. However, buspirone was well tolerated and no 
serious adverse effects were more frequently reported in buspirone-treated patients 
compared to the placebo-treated patients.

Atomoxetine has been evaluated in youth with ADHD and a co-occurring anxiety disorders 
(SAD, GAD and/or SoP; PARS score ≥15) in a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study [70]. Patients (aged 8-17 years, mean age: 12.0±3.0 years, N=176) 
were treated with atomoxetine which was titrated to 1.8 mg/kg/day (mean dose: 1.3 mg/kg/
day). Reductions in both anxiety and ADHD symptoms were observed with atomoxetine 
treatment and this SNRI was well-tolerated, although decreased appetite was more 
frequently observed in atomoxetine-treated patients.

Finally, one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of extended release guanfacine 
Nplacebo=21; Nguanfacine ER=62) in pediatric patients with GAD/SoP/SAD has recently been

completed (NCT01470469, www.clinicaltrials.gov). This trial involved 12 weeks of 
treatment with extended release guanfacine (1-6 mg/day) or placebo and has been released.

Predictors of Treatment Response

Accumulating evidence suggests a constellation of “predictors” of treatment response in 
children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. These predictors include demographic 
characteristics, clinical characteristics and family-system factors. In one study of youth aged 
7-17 years with triad anxiety disorders who were treated with fluoxetine (or placebo), 
having a first-degree relative with an anxiety disorder was associated with poorer functional 
outcomes at endpoint (OR=3.3) [60]. In the CAMS, increased caregiver strain, a measure of 
the effect of caring for a child with emotional problems on the primary caregiver (e.g., 
increased time demands, financial strain, disruption of family relationships), predicted 
higher endpoint PARS score. Additionally, Ginsburg and colleagues [71] noted that older 
age predicted a decreased likelihood of remission in CAMS (OR=0.92, 95%, p=0.01), which 
was defined as the absence of all study entry diagnoses. Additionally, being Caucasian 
predicted an increased likelihood to enter remission (OR=2.07, p=0.003). Finally, the long-
term, follow-up study of CAMS participants suggests that males as well as participants with 
better family functioning are more likely to be in remission approximately 6 years post-
randomization [41].

Regarding baseline anxiety symptom severity, in fluoxetine-treated patients, more severe 
anxiety at baseline (Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale [CGI-S]>4) was significantly 
associated with a poorer functional outcome [60], while in other samples of SSRI-treated 
youth, baseline anxiety symptoms severity predicts SSRI nonresponse (OR=7.34) [72]. 
Further, more severe anxiety at baseline, as reported by both independent evaluators and 
parents, predicted higher PARS scores at week 12 in CAMS (p<0.01 and p=0.02, 
respectively) [73]. Additionally, the type of specific anxiety disorders appears to influence 
treatment response. Treatment response to fluoxetine in pediatric anxiety disorders is 
moderated by SoP diagnosis, at least with regard to clinical and functional response [60]. 
Moreover, in CAMS, having a principal diagnosis of SAD eliminated any advantage of 
sertraline (and CBT), relative to placebo, with regard to PARS score, although superiority of 
combined treatment (sertraline+CBT) compared to placebo was preserved [73]. Finally, in 
CAMS, a principal diagnosis of SoP was associated with a statistically equivalent decrease 
in PARS score in patients treated with sertraline ± CBT, but not in patients receiving CBT 
monotherapy (compared to placebo) [73], suggesting that for a primary diagnosis of SoP, 
medication may be a requisite treatment element. Finally, Masi and colleagues [72], 
observed, in a sample of youth 7-18 years (N=140) who were treated with fluoxetine, 
sertraline, or fluvoxamine for 12 weeks, 2 comorbidities predicted treatment nonresponse: 
conduct disorder (OR=6.39, 95% CI: 1.402-14.36, p=0.011) and bipolar disorder (OR=3.85, 
95% CI: 1.00-9.90, p=0.050), while in CAMS, a diagnosis of a comorbid internalizing 
disorder attenuated the probability of achieving remission at endpoint [71].

Future Directions

While there has been a dramatic increase in the number of neuroimaging, genetic, as well as 
psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic studies involving anxiety disorders in children 
and adolescents, much work remains. In this regard, while current data suggest a basic 
neurocircuitry of anxiety disorders in youth, the relationship between dysfunction within 
these amygdala-prefrontal networks and risk, progression and treatment remains largely 
unknown. Moreover, while both psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic studies have 
established the efficacy for a number of treatments, data regarding predictors (either clinical, 
neurobiological or psychopharmacologic) of treatment response are brutally lacking. 
Relatedly, few studies have examined optimal “dosing” of either psychotherapeutic or 
psychopharmacologic treatments and little is known regarding next-step interventions for 
youth with anxiety disorders, who do not response to initial evidence-based strategies. 
Finally, the optimal duration of treatment for pediatric patients with anxiety disorders is 
generally unknown, with both psychopharmacolgic and psychotherapeutic studies being 
frequently focused on short-term, acute effects.

Conclusions

Anxiety disorders are both highly prevalent in youth and are associated with substantial 
morbidity and an increased risk of suicide attempts and self-injurious behavior. Moreover, 
these disorders are associated with dysfunction within a myriad of amygdala-based networks 
throughout the prefrontal cortex (for recent reviews see: [9,28]). Over the past several 
decades, screening and assessment tools have been developed to assist clinicians in 
identifying anxiety symptoms early and accurately establishing anxiety disorder diagnoses. 
Importantly, these disorders are amenable to treatment, both psychopharmacologic and 
psychotherapeutic and there has been a recent surge in evidence for exposure-based CBT 
and SSRIs/SSNRIs in the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders. Specifically, 
psychopharmacologic trials data in pediatric patients with non-OCD anxiety disorders 
suggest that SSRIs and SSNRIs are efficacious and well-tolerated. However, placebo-
controlled studies do not support the efficacy of benzodiazepines or buspirone in the 
treatment of youth with anxiety disorders. Moreover, we are beginning to appreciate that 
certain clinical and demographic variables may ultimately predict successful treatment 
outcome, including a family history, baseline anxiety severity, and comorbidity.
