ABSTRACT
Objective  To describe mental health outcomes and 
measures of pandemic burden of children with and without 
special healthcare needs, and their caregivers following 
the second wave of the COVID- 19 pandemic in Germany.
Design  This is the second of a sequential series of cross- 
sectional online surveys conducted among caregivers 
of children ≤18 years since the onset of the COVID- 19 
pandemic, administrated between 2 April 2021 and 31 July 
2021.
Main outcome measures  Child and parental mental 
health were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire and WHO- 5 Well- being index. Children 
with Special Healthcare Needs (CSHCN) were identified 
using the CSHCN- Screener. Descriptive statistics, linear 
and hierarchical logistic regression modelling assessed 
associations between parent- reported child mental 
health problems and measures of pandemic burden, 
disease complexity, caregiver mental well- being and 
socioeconomic status.
Results  521 participants were included in the final 
sample. There was a high prevalence of parent- reported 
mental health problems in n=302 (66.7%) children, 
particularly in CSHCN. Among caregivers, n=372 (72.5%) 
screened positive for depression. Logistic regression 
modelling showed a strong association of child mental 
health problems and disease complexity, parental mental 
well- being, increase in family conflict and inadequate 
social support.
Conclusions  Our study identifies CSHCN as a 
particularly vulnerable group in terms of mental health 
outcomes. Psychosocial factors were important predictors 
of parent- reported child mental health problems. Policy 
measures should consider the importance of social support 
systems for vulnerable children and their families, and aim 
to provide accessible mental health support for caregivers.

INTRODUCTION
The  COVID- 19  pandemic  has  substantially 
disrupted  the  everyday  lives  of  children 
and  their  families  worldwide.  Recurring 
lockdowns,  contact  restrictions  and  school 
closures  have  affected  children  and  adoles-
cents repeatedly over the past 2 years. Home 
schooling,  social  isolation  and  difficulties  in 

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 ⇒ Increasing evidence points towards a rising mental 
health burden in children and adolescents during the 
COVID- 19 pandemic.

 ⇒ Few studies conducted during the pandemic so far 
have focused on mental health outcomes of children 
with special healthcare needs and their caregivers.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 ⇒ This study found a high prevalence of mental health 
problems in both children and their caregivers, par-
ticularly in families with children with special health-
care needs.

 ⇒ Parent- reported child mental health problems were 
strongly  associated  with  pandemic- related  vari-
ables,  that  is,  increase  in  family  conflict  and  inad-
equate social support, and with caregivers’ mental 
health.

 ⇒ It  highlights  the  importance  of  social  support  sys-
tems for vulnerable children and their families, and 
provision  of  accessible  resources  for  caregiver’s 
mental health support.

HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, 
PRACTICE OR POLICY
 ⇒ Longitudinal  studies  are  needed  to  examine  the 
long- term  mental  health  impact  of  the  COVID- 19 
pandemic on children with special healthcare needs.
 ⇒ Policy responses to the current and any future pan-
demic  should  consider  the  importance  of  social 
support  systems  for  vulnerable  children  and  their 
families, and include their voices and experiences in 
health- related decision- making.

accessing routine health services for children 
have placed considerable strain on families.1–6
Concern  about  the  mental  health  impact 
of  the  pandemic  on  children  and  adoles-
cents has been raised repeatedly.7 Increasing 
evidence  suggests  a  rising  mental  health 
burden in children and adolescents: a recent 
meta- analysis reports a pooled prevalence of 
25.2% for depression and 20.5% for elevated 
anxiety,  which  are  double  prepandemic

estimates.8  This  evidence  from  largely  cross- sectional 
studies is echoed by longitudinal studies.9 10 In Germany, 
child mental health problems increased from 17.6% pre- 
pandemic to 29.1% by September–October 2021.10 11

Associations  between  young  people’s  mental  health, 
caregiver  burden  and  mental  well- being,  social  support 
and  socioeconomic  status  (SES)  have  been  described 
previously.10  12  13  Child  behavioural  problems  during 
the  pandemic  predicted  parental  strain,  and  parents 
reporting high parental strain were more likely to report 
child  behavioural  problems.14  Caregiver  burden  was  a 
predictor for parental depression and anxiety.15

Fluctuating  public  health  measures  and  need  for 
frequent adaptation of family routines were a challenge 
for families with children with special  healthcare needs 
(CSHCN)  in  particular.  These  children  have  chronic 
conditions  which  require  more  support  than  average.16 
There is concern about the mental health impact of the 
pandemic  on  CSHCN  and  about  an  increasing  burden 
on their caregivers.17–19 However, few studies to date have 
focused on the mental health of CSHCN and their care-
givers.  As  countries  worldwide  are  faced  with  the  long- 
term  challenge  of  COVID- 19  recovery,  research  should 
support an equitable approach by providing evidence on 
the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable populations.20 
Hence, our study aims
1.  To describe mental health outcomes and measures of 
pandemic burden of children with and without special 
healthcare  needs  and  their  caregivers  following  the 
second wave of the COVID- 19 pandemic in Germany.
2.  To explore associations between parent- reported child 
mental  health  problems  and  measures  of  pandemic 
burden,  disease  complexity,  caregiver  mental  well- 
being and SES.

METHODS
Study design
This  study  is  the  second  of  a  sequential  series  of  cross- 
sectional online surveys at various time points since the 
onset  of  the  pandemic.  The  first  survey  was  conducted 
from August to October 2020.21 This second survey was 
initiated  shortly  after  the  second  national  lockdown  in 
Germany (16 December 2020–7 March 2021) and admin-
istered via REDcap between 2 April 2021 and 31 July 2021.
Caregivers  of  children  ≤18  years  were  eligible  to 
participate.  Recruitment 
involved  convenience  and 
non- probabilistic  snowball  sampling,  study  promo-
tion  via  partner  organisations,  social  and  public  media, 
and  through  free  access  websites.  The  study  is  regis-
tered  with  the  German  Registry  for  Clinical  Studies 
(DRKS00022868).

Patient and public involvement
Representatives  of  the  Kindernetzwerk  e.V.,  a  large 
patient organisation for families of children with chronic 
diseases  and  disabilities,  were  consulted  about  relevant 
topics  when  designing  the  questionnaire  and  approved 

the  final  version.  The  Kindernetzwerk  e.V.  promoted 
the  study;  results  were  shared  in  online  meetings,  and 
disseminated to its members through free access websites 
and newsletters.

Measures
Child  mental  health  was  measured  using  the  parent- 
report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Question-
naire  (SDQ).22  It  applies  to  children  aged  4–16  years, 
with a preschool version differing in three items.23 Both 
the German standard parent- report version of the SDQ 
and  the  preschool  version  are  valid  and  reliable  instru-
ments.23 24 We used age- appropriate versions of the SDQ 
for caregivers of children older than 2 years and a cut- off 
of 13 on the Total Difficulties score10  25 (online supple-
mental material).

Caregiver mental health: The WHO- 5 is a five- question 
screening  tool  for  mental  health  with  good  validity 
and reliability.26 Scores range from 0 to 100, where 100 
represents  the  best  imaginable  mental  well- being.  The 
cut- off point for depression screening is 50.26

CSHCN:  The  CSHCN  Screener  is  a  five- item  parent- 
reported screening instrument to identify children with 
chronic  physical,  mental,  behavioural  and  other  condi-
tions,  who  require  more  support  through  services  than 
average for their peers.16 Higher scores indicate higher 
disease  complexity.  We  stratified  children  into  three 
groups27: no special healthcare needs (CSHCN score=0), 
chronic  conditions  (0<CSHCN  score  ≤2)  and  complex 
chronic conditions (CSHCN score ≥3).

SES:  An  SES  index  was  constructed  as  the  sum  of 
three indicators: household net equivalent income, care-
giver education and occupation28 (online supplemental 
material).

COVID- 19- related  burden:  Items  assessed  financial 
difficulties, inadequate social support, family conflict and 
general burden by pandemic restrictions.

Sociodemographic  characteristics  included  age  and 
gender,  relationship  status,  education,  occupation, 
monthly  household  income,  household  size,  area  of 
residence  and  country  of  birth.  Caregiver  education 
was categorised according to the international CASMIN 
classification.29

Statistical methods
Participants  with  no  more  than  two  missing  values  in 
any  of  the  following  key  variables  were  included  in  the 
analysis:  SDQ  total  score,  WHO- 5  total  score,  CSHCN 
screener  score  and  SES  variables  (monthly  household 
income,  occupation  and  education).  Missing  values  for 
household net income (15%) were replaced by multiple 
imputation. Analyses involving the SDQ were restricted to 
children older than 2 years of age. Associations between 
SDQ- subscales  and  WHO- 5  were  examined  using  Pear-
son’s  correlations.  Simple  linear  regression  modelling 
was performed for WHO- 5 total score on SES- Index and 
for SDQ total score on SES- Index. Associations between

performed using IBM SPSS V.27.0.

RESULTS
Of  761  participants  accessing  the  survey,  521  were 
included  in  the  final  sample  (figure  1).  Participants’ 
sociodemographic characteristics are displayed in table 1. 
Exclusion from further analysis (n=120) affected families 
with  and  without  CSHCN  equally  (see  online  supple-
mental material for further details).

Among all children, 56.2% (n=293; 0.6% missing) had 
special  healthcare  needs.  Of  these,  79.2%  (n=232)  had 
a physical impairment, 76.8% (n=225) a behavioural or 
sensory  impairment  and  52.2%  (n=153)  had  impaired 
speech or understanding.

The mean SDQ score was 16.4 (SD 8.6; 8.3% missing), 
with 66.7% (n=302) of children having a score ≥13, indi-
cating  slightly  raised  to  high  scores.  Caregivers’  mean 
WHO- 5 score was 35.7 (SD 22.6; 1.5% missing) and 72.5% 
(n=372) had a score ≤50, that is, below the cut- off point 
for depression screening. There was strong evidence for 
a  negative  correlation  between  all  SDQ- subscales  and 
WHO- 5 score (online supplemental table S2).

There  was  very  strong  evidence  for  an  association 
between  disease  complexity  and  SDQ  score:  77.6% 
(n=156)  of  children  with  complex  chronic  disease 
had  raised  to  high  SDQ  scores  compared  with  55.7% 
(n=112)  of  children  without  special  healthcare  needs 
(χ2(df=2)=21.7,  p<0.001;  13.6%  missing;  online  supple-
mental  table  S3).  CSHCN  scored  higher  on  all  SDQ 
subscales than children without; group differences were 
significant  for  the  hyperactivity/inattention  and  peer 
problems subscales (table 2).

Most caregivers felt burdened by pandemic restrictions 
(n=489 (94.2%); 0.4% missing) and about half reported 
increased  family  conflict  and  inadequate  social  support 
(n=248  (47.8%)  and  n=270  (52.0%),  respectively;  0.4% 
missing). Financial difficulties were reported by 17.5% of 
families (n=91; 0.4% missing).

Stratified  analysis  revealed  differences  according  to 
SES. Among children with complex chronic conditions, 
26%  (n=61)  lived  in  families  with  low  SES,  compared 
with  14.4%  (n=31)  of  children  without  (χ2(df=4)=11.7; 
p=0.02; online supplemental table S4). There was some 
evidence  for  associations  between  SES  and  both  care-
giver and child mental health. WHO- 5 scores increased 
with  increasing  SES,  while  SDQ  scores  increased  with 
decreasing  SES  (table  3).  For  additional  results,  see 
online supplemental table S5.

Determinants of child mental health
Table  4  shows  the  results  of  hierarchical  logistic  regres-
sion  modelling.  Overall,  model  1  explained  32.9% 
of  variance  after  block  3,  and  correctly  predicted  an 
SDQ- score  ≥13  in  88.1%  of  cases.  The  biggest  increase 
in  explained  variance  resulted  from  adding  caregiver 
mental  well- being  in  block  2.  Model  1  provided  very

COVID- 19 related burden and SES were analysed using 
simple logistic regression modelling.

Theory- driven  hierarchical  logistic  regression  model-
ling was performed on complete datasets (n=427; 82% of 
total sample size) to estimate adjusted ORs for the asso-
ciation of parent- reported child mental health problems 
with  disease  complexity,  caregiver  mental  health,  SES 
and  pandemic  burden.  Variables  were  added  in  three 
blocks  (see  online  supplemental  material).  Analyses 
were adjusted for age and gender. We compared model 
1  including  all  children  with  two  models  stratifying  for 
disease  complexity  (models  2  and  3).  Effect  modifica-
tion  was  explored  by  including  interaction  terms  for 
family  conflict  and  caregiver  well- being,  as  well  as  for 
social support and caregiver well- being in model 1. Multi-
collinearity  between  exposure  variables  was  assessed  by

strong evidence that elevated SDQ scores were associated 
with  disease  complexity,  age  of  child,  caregiver  mental 
well- being,  increase  in  family  conflict  and  inadequate 
social  support.  Children  with  complex  chronic  condi-
tions had three times the odds of having an elevated SDQ 
score  compared  with  children  without  special  health-
care needs. Children whose caregivers scored ≤50 on the 
WHO- 5  were  2.9  times  more  likely  to  have  an  elevated 
SDQ score than children in the baseline group. Children 
whose caregivers reported an increase in family conflict 
during  the  pandemic  or  experienced  inadequate  social 
support had 3.6 times and 2.4 times the odds of having an 
elevated SDQ score compared with children in the base-
line group. After controlling for confounding effects of

disease complexity, age, gender, caregiver mental health 
and psychosocial variables, there was no evidence of an 
association between SES and elevated SDQ scores.

Other analyses
Stratified  regression  modelling  according  to  disease 
complexity  revealed  no  substantial  differences  for  chil-
dren  without  special  healthcare  needs.  For  children 
with  complex  chronic  disease,  only  a  strong  associa-
tion  between  inadequate  social  support  and  elevated 
SDQ  scores  prevailed  (table  4).  The  inclusion  of  inter-
action  terms  showed  no  evidence  of  a  varying  effect  of 
family conflict or social support on elevated SDQ scores 
according  to  the  WHO- 5  score.  There  was  no  evidence 
for  multicollinearity  between  independent  variables 
included in the regression modelling.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that prevalence of mental health 
problems  in  both  children  and  their  caregivers  is  high, 
particularly  in  families  with  CSHCN.  Parent- reported 
child  mental  health  problems  were  strongly  associated 
with pandemic- related variables, that is, increase in family 
conflict  and  inadequate  social  support,  as  well  as  with 
caregiver mental health. After adjusting for confounding, 
no association of SES and child mental health remained.
The  prevalence  of  parent- reported  mental  health 
problems,  as  measured  by  elevated  SDQ  score,  in  our 
sample was 66.7%. This is much higher than estimates of 
30.4%  and  29.1%  reported  in  a  representative  German 
study.10 The higher prevalence in our study is likely due 

to the high proportion of children with chronic disease 
or disability. Other studies assessing child mental health 
during  the  COVID- 19  pandemic  in  non- representative 
samples have described elevated mental health symptoms 
for children with special educational needs and neurode-
velopmental disorders.9 17 30 The first survey of our study 
found  a  prevalence  of  parent- reported  mental  health 
problems  of  57.4%,  with  a  higher  prevalence  among 
CSHCN.21  Though  this  study  is  not  based  on  the  same 
sample, we still observe very high SDQ scores for CSHCN.
Our  findings  suggest  both  lower  caregiver  well- being 
and high prevalence of depression based on the WHO- 5 
compared with general population estimates (26, supple-
ment;  31).  Our  sample  likely  constitutes  a  particularly 
high- burdened sample of caregivers. Compared with our 
first survey, we here observed even lower caregiver well- 
being and mental health.21 Other studies have reported 
high  psychological  distress 
in  families  during  the 
COVID- 19 pandemic and associations of parental stress, 
younger  age  of  both  parents  and  children  with  poorer 
parental  mental  health.5  10  32–34  The  reciprocal  relation-
ship  between  caregiver  and  child  mental  well- being 
warrants further exploration. We observed strong correla-
tions of caregiver mental health with child mental health. 
This  could  reflect  the  fact  that  the  child  mental  health 
measure  was  a  parent- reported  outcome  measure,14  35 
that is, highly burdened caregivers might be more likely 
to report child internalising or externalising problems.

Caregivers of CSHCN are particularly at risk of experi-
encing psychological distress.19 36 A study found moderate 
to  severe  depression  in  45%  of  carers  of  children  with

intellectual  disabilities  during  the  first  UK  lockdown.37 
Family  functioning  and  social  support  are  important 
factors  related  to  caregiver  mental  well- being.10  30  33  In 
households  of  young  CSHCN,  several  dimensions  of 
social  support  correlated  with  lower  emotional  distress 
in  caregivers  and  fewer  behavioural  problems  in  chil-
dren during the pandemic.18 Our study identifies family 
conflict and social support as predictors of child mental 
health.  Pandemic  control  measures  included  different 
degrees  of  social  distancing,  hence  our  findings  may 
reflect the impact of disintegrating social support systems 
on families with CSHCN.

Associations  between  SES  and  child  mental  health 
have  been  described  both  before  and  during  this 
pandemic.9 10 12 30 38 Contrary to results of the unadjusted 
analysis and to our first survey,21 we did not find associ-
ations  between  SES  and  parent- reported  child  mental 
health  problems  after  adjusting  for  confounding.  This 
might  be  due  to  responding  bias,  as  our  study  sample 
mainly  included  participants  with  a  high  educational 
and  occupational  level.  However,  we  found  strong 
evidence for an association between low SES and disease 
complexity. Higher odds of all- cause disabling conditions 
have been described for children from low SES, though 
the causal mechanisms remain uncertain.39 CSHCN from 
low SES are likely to be a particularly vulnerable group, 
both with regard to their underlying condition and their 
mental health.

Limitations
The results and in particular the generalisability of this 
study are limited by the non- representative nature of our 
sample. Due to the recruitment process, the respondents 
are likely to have been a highly self- selected sample with 
a high educational level. Participants from lower educa-
tional and occupational levels, and those from a minority 
or  ethnic  background  are  under- represented.  Hence, 
this study might underestimate the prevalence of parent- 
reported  child  mental  health  problems  in  this  group. 
Regarding  non-respondence,  it  can  be  assumed  that 
there was no systematic bias due to disease severity based 
on the data available, as both families with and without 
children  with  SHCN  were  equally  affected.  Finally,  the 
cross- sectional design of this study does not allow infer-
ence  of  causality.  Hence,  caregiver  mental  health  prob-
lems may cause child mental health problems, but child 
mental health problems and disease complexity may also 
affect caregiver mental health.

CONCLUSION
The results presented here suggest a high mental health 
burden in both children and caregivers in a large sample 
of  German  families  with  children  with  and  without 
special healthcare needs. In the context of the COVID- 19 
pandemic,  our  study  identifies  children  with  complex 
chronic  disease  as  a  particularly  vulnerable  group  in 
terms  of  mental  health  outcomes.  Psychosocial  factors

related to social support, family functioning and caregiver 
mental  well- being  were  important  predictors  of  parent- 
reported  child  mental  health  problems.  Consequently, 
there  is  a  need  for  longitudinal  studies  examining  the 
long- term  mental  health  impact  of  the  pandemic  on 
CSHCN.  Appropriate  policy  responses  should  focus 
on  and  reach  out  to  vulnerable  groups  by  including 
their  voices  and  experiences  in  health- related  decision 
making.20 Future pandemic preparedness should adopt a 
child- rights- based approach, consider the importance of 
social support systems for vulnerable children and their 
families, and establish accessible resources for caregivers’ 
mental health support.
