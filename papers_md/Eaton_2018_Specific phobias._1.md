Abstract

Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders, but the subcategory of specific 
phobias has not been well studied. Phobias involve both fear and avoidance. For people who have 
specific phobias, avoidance can reduce the constancy and severity of distress and impairment. 
However, these phobias are important because of their early onset and strong persistence over 
time. Studies indicate that the lifetime prevalence of specific phobias around the world ranges 
from 3% to 15%, with fears and phobias concerning heights and animals being the most common. 
The developmental course of phobias, which progress from fear to avoidance and then to 
diagnosis, suggests the possibility that interrupting the course of phobias could reduce their 
prevalence. Although specific phobias often begin in childhood, their incidence peaks during 
midlife and old age. Phobias persist for several years or even decades in 10–30% of cases, and are 
strongly predictive of onset of other anxiety, mood, and substance-use disorders. Their high 
comorbidity with other mental disorders, especially after onset of the phobia, suggests that early 
treatment of phobias could also alter the risk of other disorders. Exposure therapy remains the 
treatment of choice, although this approach might be less effective in the long term than previously 
believed. This Review discusses the literature regarding the prevalence, incidence, course, risk 
factors, and treatment of specific phobias, and presents epidemiological data from several 
population-based surveys.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders, which include generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, 
social phobia, and specific (simple) phobias, are more prevalent in adults than are other 
mental disorders.1 In 1987, Marks2 reviewed the existing literature and conceptualised the 
study of anxiety, which led to a surge in research on the epidemiology and natural history of 
the subcategories of panic and agoraphobia,3–7 social phobia,8–16 and generalised anxiety

disorder.17–20 However, less research has been done on the subcategory of specific phobias,
21–23 which is the subject of this Review. As many people with specific phobias do not seek 
treatment, the epidemiological aspects of this Review concentrate on population-based data, 
focusing on the prevalence, incidence, and natural history of specific phobias. We also 
discuss research on risk factors (including genetic epidemiology) and treatment modalities 
for specific phobias. We systematically reviewed the epidemiological research literature on 
any specific phobia, and eight specific phobias were assessed on the basis of three separate 
population-based surveys. The aim of this Review is to introduce researchers and clinicians 
to this relatively under-developed field, to highlight the importance of specific phobias, and 
to provide some guidance regarding treatment options.

The diagnosis of phobic reaction was described in two short paragraphs in the first edition of 
the American Psychiatric Association DSM in 1952,24 which stated that “the commonly 
observed forms of phobic reaction include fear of syphilis, dirt, closed places, high places, 
open places, animals, etc. The patient attempts to control his anxiety by avoiding the phobic 
object or situation.” Since then, types of phobia (including social phobias, agoraphobia, and 
specific phobias) have been more narrowly specified, and subtypes of specific phobias 
(including phobias related to blood, injections, and injury) have been expanded. The 
diagnosis of a specific phobia requires unreasonable fear associated with a specific object or 
situation, avoidance of the object or situation, persistence of the fear over time, and 
clinically significant distress or impairment associated with the fear, or avoidance.25 The 
definitions in the American and international classifications26 are similar, which is important 
for our discussion of worldwide results.

The requirement that the individual recognises their phobia as unreasonable indicates that 
the presence of insight is important, and suggests that the interview or self-report method of 
assessment by a clinician or survey interviewer (as used in much of the research discussed 
herein) is probably a valid method of diagnosis. Specific phobias can be diagnosed with only 
a few questions. For example, the first question about specific phobias from the revised third 
edition of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule,27 used in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area 
(ECA) study,28 asks about the fear itself and avoidance (eg, for blood and injection phobia, 
“have you ever had such an unreasonable fear of seeing blood; getting an injection; or going 
to the dentist that you tried to avoid it?”). The second question asks about persistence (eg, 
“did any of these fears continue for months or even years?”), and is followed by a series of 
questions about possible resulting distress or impairment, such as seeing a doctor, taking 
medication, or staying away from work.

Prevalence and incidence

Our literature search identified 25 population-based studies of the prevalence of specific 
phobias in adults, done between 1984 and 2016 in populations around the world (table 1). 
The median lifetime prevalence is 7·2% (IQR 4·0–10·4), and varies considerably among 
these reports, from 1·5% in Florence, Italy,41 and 2·6% in China50 to 14·4% in Oslo, 
Norway.39 Although some of this variation is likely to be due to the use of different

assessment procedures, many structured survey assessment procedures are similar, deriving 
from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule53 (used in the ECA studies28), which evolved into 
the University of Michigan Composite International Diagnostic Interview,54 and then into 
the version used in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys.55 Differences in survey 
responses or age ranges of the samples could also explain the variation. However, large 
variations are also present in studies striving to use identical methods, such as the high rate 
for Baltimore in the ECA study (14·5% for male participants and 23·5% for female 
participants) as compared with the New Haven (3·8% and 8·5%) and St Louis (4·0% and 
9·4%) ECA sites,56 and the large difference between two samples from different areas of 
Norway.39,42 These differences could provide guidance about as-yet-unknown risk factors, 
and suggest different causes that might be amenable to prevention or treatment. In east Asian 
populations, geographical variation is low, confined within the low lifetime prevalence in 
these regions: 2·6% in China, 3·4% in Japan, and 3·8% in Korea. There is no obvious trend 
in prevalence by calendar period. The 25 WHO World Mental Health Surveys also showed 
less variation than did other population-based studies, presumably because the WHO 
surveys all used the same instrument.57 However, low-income countries showed slightly 
lower prevalence in the WHO surveys, consistent with the pattern of results seen in the 
earlier individual studies. The large differences between populations suggest the importance 
of studying risk factors for specific phobias.

In all studies included in this Review, the lifetime prevalence of specific phobias was higher 
in female participants than in male participants. The greatest differences were observed in 
Chile, rural Norway, and Hong Kong, where prevalence in female participants was more 
than three times as high as in male participants, and the smallest differences were seen in 
two Latino populations: Mexicans in southern California34 and Puerto Ricans (table 1).33 
The higher prevalence in women was consistent with a Darwinian interpretation58 (ie, that 
the process of selection favours groups in which the female members of the species were 
most avoidant of danger, especially during child-rearing years).59 However, there was no 
obvious explanation for the variation in male:female ratios around the world.

The first occurrence of a specific phobia can happen at any time throughout the lifespan, as 
shown by data from the Baltimore ECA follow-up,60 a cohort study designed to explore the 
life-course structure of mental disorders (figure). This study interviewed individuals selected 
probabilistically from the household-residing population in eastern Baltimore in 1981, with 
follow-up interviews of the same respondents in 1982, 1993–96, and 2004–05.60 When 
asked about the first occurrence of a phobia, many participants responded that they had 
experienced the phobia since they were a child or since they could remember, or similar, 
resulting in peaks in incidence at or below 5 years of age (figure). These findings are 
consistent with those of the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology study in 
Germany (in which almost all of the sample of 3021 adolescents reported onset of specific 
phobia in childhood or adolescence),62 the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS; in which the 
median age of onset in 8098 adults was 15 years),31 and the World Mental Health Surveys 
(completed in 22 countries with a total sample size of 124 902, in which the median age of 
onset was 8 years).57 The incidence of new specific phobias in girls during childhood was 
much higher than in boys, and gently declined thereafter until the beginning of adulthood 
(about 20 years of age), after which it rose until about age 30 years for women (figure). The

peak incidence in women occurred during the years of reproduction and child rearing, 
possibly reflecting an evolutionary advantage. Men and women had an additional peak in 
incidence during old age that was much stronger for women, reaching nearly 1% per year. 
This pattern might reflect the new occurrence of physical conditions63 or adverse life events 
(such as the unexpected death of a loved one)64 during those years.

Fears of specific objects or situations are widespread in the population. For example, more 
than 70% of people in the USA report having one or more unreasonable fears.23 The 
prevalence of these fears is much higher than that of the consequent diagnoses (table 2), 
which require the presence of avoidance and impairment related to the fear. In publicly 
available datasets from the USA (the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related 
Conditions [NESARC]23 and the NCS31) and from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey 
and Incidence Study (NEMESIS)38—all of which included large probabilistic samples 
representing national populations and used structured, diagnostically oriented interviews—
fears of animals and heights are the two most prevalent fears in all three samples, and the 
order of prevalence of the different specific fears is relatively constant, with the exception 
that fear of blood is less prevalent in NESARC than in the other two studies (table 2). The 
conditional probabilities of meeting the diagnostic criteria for specific phobias given the 
presence of the fear are similar across all seven fears and across all three samples (about 25–
30%). The lifetime prevalence estimates of particular specific phobias (about 2–6%; table 2, 
rightmost columns) are of the same order of magnitude as many other, more broadly defined, 
psychiatric diagnoses. The baseline prevalence estimates for specific phobias in the 
Baltimore ECA (table 3, left column) are higher than the estimates from the NESARC, NCS, 
and NEMESIS studies (table 2), suggesting Baltimore to be an outlier with particularly high 
prevalence (as also shown in table 1). Since phobias are, by definition, distressing or 
impairing, their effective prevention or treatment could have a non-trivial effect on the 
mental health of the population. For blood or injection phobia, prevention could also provide 
a physical health benefit, because people with this phobia presumably avoid contact with 
doctors who engage in preventive measures across the general health spectrum. Although 
there are a range of universal prevention programmes for early psychopathology in general, 
few of them have been examined specifically with respect to simple phobias.66,67

Clinical course

Specific phobias are not transient disorders, as shown by data from the ECA, NCS, and 
NESARC studies (table 3). Persistence, reflecting the chronicity of the disorder, is measured 
by the percentage of patients with a past-year history of the disorder at the baseline 
interview who report an occurrence of the disorder within the 12 months preceding the 
follow-up interview. In the ECA sample, 6–20% of specific phobias were persistent at 1 
year, and 6–28% at 12 years; in the NCS sample, persistence at 10 years ranged from 25% to 
38%; and in the NESARC sample, persistence at 3 years ranged from 12% to 19% (table 3). 
A similar estimate of persistence, 17·5% for any specific phobia, was observed after 8 years 
of follow-up in the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey,68 while persistence in the 
NCS sample after 10 years was greater, at about 25%. In all three samples shown in table 3, 
one of the most persistent phobias was that of heights. This degree of persistence is similar 
to that of other common, non-psychotic mental disorders.61

Specific phobias are strong predictors of other anxiety disorders and of mood and substance-
use disorders (table 4). In the NESARC study,23 anxiety disorders were the most strongly 
predicted, as might be expected, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 5·60 to 7·41 (95% CIs 
4·95–8·40), without much change after adjustment for sociodemographic factors (5·12 to 
7·18 [4·50–8·11]). Even after adjustment for other common mental disorders, the ORs for 
any anxiety disorder were high (3·84 [3·46–4·27]; table 4). Mood disorders were also 
strongly predicted (4·05 [3·69–4·46]), and the OR remained high after adjusting for closely 
related mood disorders (eg, the ORs for specific phobias predicting major depressive 
disorder were 1·99 [1·80–2·20] after adjusting for the earlier occurrence of dysthymia and 
mania). The ORs for substance-use disorders were lower than those of anxiety disorders, but 
still non-trivial and statistically significant (1·83 [1·67–2·00]).23 High cooccurrence of 
specific phobias and other mental disorders was also observed across the World Mental 
Health Survey samples, in which 61% of lifetime cases of specific phobia had at least one 
other mental disorder.57 These data suggest that the incidence of other common mental 
disorders could potentially be reduced by effective treatment of specific phobias.69,70

Risk factors

Risk factors for specific phobias have not been well studied. Most potentially pertinent 
studies group the anxiety disorders into one category in their presentation of even the most 
rudimentary risk factors. The most important demographic risk factor for specific phobias 
seems to be female sex (table 1). We identified five studies in which the prevalence of 
specific phobias could be compared between rural and urban populations,23,39,42,34,33 and 
found very little difference between the two groups, except in Norway, where the prevalence 
was 14% in the urban population and 7% in the rural population.39,42

We estimated the association between the prevalence of specific fears and education, marital 
status, and residence in the NESARC sample, which was the only study to have this amount 
of detail for specific phobias of animals, heights, storms, and closed spaces (table 5).23 
Lower educational attainment was associated with higher prevalence of any specific phobia 
(40% in people with less than high school education vs 29% in college graduates), as was 
formerly married status (38% in people who were separated or divorced, and 42% in 
widowed people, vs 35% in married people). The difference in prevalence between rural and 
urban areas was trivial, which is surprising given that exposures to fear stimuli presumably 
differ between those areas, with more exposure to animals in rural areas and heights in urban 
areas.

Data from the World Mental Health Surveys also indicate a higher prevalence of any specific 
phobia in people with lower educational attainment.57 Lower educational attainment is an 
indicator of lower socioeconomic status in general, which is presumably associated with less 
control over the social and physical environment, especially in conditions of stress. 
Consistent with data from the USA, World Mental Health Survey data indicate a higher 
prevalence of any specific phobia among formerly married people (relative odds 1·3 in high-
income countries and 1·1 in low-income or middle-income countries).57 These data suggest 
that marital status as a risk factor for specific phobias might vary by geographical region, or 
according to other environmental characteristics. It seems reasonable that having a marital

partner would alleviate fears somewhat in offering a protective element (ie, a spouse) to the 
environment; it is also possible that formerly married people are more likely to be depressed, 
which might be a risk factor for simple phobias.

Although genetic risk factors for specific phobias have been studied for at least three 
decades,71 many of the existing studies involve overlapping samples.72 Phobias are more 
likely to occur in people whose family members have phobias. Twin studies suggest that 
within-family resemblance is due to shared environmental factors in childhood,73–75 
whereas genetic factors influence familial resemblance in adulthood.76 A meta-analysis of 
ten independent twin studies of specific phobias reported a mean heritability of about 30% 
for the three subtypes of phobias studied (animal, situational, and blood-illness).72 Genetic 
epidemiological methods are also useful to elucidate how phobias relate to personality traits 
and other psychiatric disorders. Multivariate structural equation modelling of twin data 
suggests that genetic factors that influence animal and situational phobias are distinguishable 
from those that influence major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic 
disorder, agoraphobia, and social phobia.77 Specific phobias also appear to be less 
genetically correlated with neuroticism and extraversion than are other anxiety and 
depressive disorders, including social phobia and agoraphobia.78,79

Only about a tenth to a quarter of people with specific phobias eventually receive treatment,
30,57 possibly because avoidance can reduce stress and impairment. Predictors for receiving 
treatment include having more severe impairment, having particular phobias (eg, people 
with phobias of flying, closed spaces, or heights are more likely to seek treatment), and 
having a greater number of phobias.57 To our knowledge, no studies have addressed the 
comparative effectiveness of different treatment options. Therefore, we discuss the evidence 
regarding the effectiveness of treatments relative to non-treatment control conditions, with a 
preference for published systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Exposure therapy is the current treatment of choice for specific phobias.80,81 The standard 
form of exposure therapy involves in-vivo or imaging approaches to phobic stimuli or 
situations. Virtual-reality exposure therapy was first introduced more than two decades ago 
to treat fear of heights82 and remains a viable treatment option for other specific phobias.83 
Three decades ago, Öst pioneered a one-session treatment approach for specific phobias, 
with an average duration of approximately 2 h.84,85 Subsequent studies by Öst and 
colleagues suggested that a single 3-h session of massed exposure therapy is as effective as 
multiple sessions (total 6 h) of more gradual exposure therapy for the treatment of phobias 
of flying,86 blood and injections,87 and claustrophobia.88 The results of a 2008 meta-
analysis indicate that multiple sessions might be somewhat more effective than the single-
session approach, as measured by questionnaire-based functional outcomes at follow-up,81 
and careful consideration is needed when choosing the appropriate number and duration of 
sessions for patients;89 however, the massed single-session approach could be considered a 
viable option for suitable patients.

Early studies of exposure therapies for specific phobias90 were criticised for their various 
methodological limitations, including selection biases, the use of small, unrepresentative 
samples, and compromised control conditions. Although exposure therapy is much more 
widely studied and accepted now than it was in the early 1970s, systematic reviews suggest 
that the evidence base could still be improved.80,81 Additionally, although the available 
evidence indicates moderately high short-term efficacy of psychological treatments for 
specific phobias,80 most studies have only followed up patients for short durations. The 
assessment of long-term effectiveness is particularly important because treated phobias in 
patients (and extinguished fear responses in other animals) are susceptible to relapse.91–96 
One of the notable risk factors for relapse is context change, in which the individual 
reencounters the phobic stimulus or situation outside of the context in which extinction 
originally occurred.93,96 Accordingly, studies have sought to extinguish conditioned 
responses to fear or phobic stimuli in multiple contexts, finding this approach to be 
comparatively more effective than extinction in a single context.95–98

Pharmacotherapy is not a common treatment choice for specific phobias. However, within 
the past decade, studies have investigated pharmacological augmentation of exposure 
therapy in attempts to improve treatment outcomes. In one approach, clinicians administer 
the antibiotic D-cycloserine, which is thought to facilitate fear extinction learning through its 
role as an N-methyl D-aspartate receptor agonist.99,100 The results of the first published, 
double-blind, randomised trial in humans indicated that oral administration of D-cycloserine 
(50 mg or 500 mg) before virtual-reality exposure therapy for phobia of heights was 
associated with substantially greater improvement than was placebo.100 Results from a 
systematic review of placebo-controlled studies suggest that pre-exposure D-cycloserine 
administration (50 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg) is associated with a small exposure 
augmentation benefit in patients with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, or post-traumatic stress 
disorders (compared with pretreatment, d=–0·25 at post-treatment, d=0·19 at follow-up).101 
In another approach, clinicians administer glucocorticoids—which appear to have a role in 
fear extinction processing—before exposure therapy. In two randomised trials, participants 
in the treatment group were orally administered 20 mg cortisol 1 h before virtual-reality 
exposure therapy for fear of heights102 or in-vivo exposure therapy for fear of spiders.103 
Both studies found that cortisol administration enhanced the efficacy of treatment relative to 
placebo-controlled exposure therapy.

Conclusion

Although specific phobias have a high prevalence, a low percentage of affected people seek 
treatment. Specific phobias begin early in life and persist over years or decades, and are 
associated with increased risk of various other mental disorders. The prevalence, incidence, 
course, and comorbidities of specific phobias are similar across the different subtypes, with 
the possible exception that fear of heights is more prevalent and more persistent than other 
subtypes. The consistent associations with some risk factors, such as female sex, education, 
and formerly married status, suggest the possible existence of causal pathways that could be 
altered to produce beneficial effects.

Future studies should more thoroughly examine barriers to treatment for specific phobias, 
and more high-quality studies assessing longer-term outcomes in patients treated with 
different forms of exposure therapy (eg, massed single-session vs more gradual multiple-
session exposure, or single-context vs multiple-context exposure) are needed. The potential 
benefits of pharmacological augmentation of exposure also warrant further study. There is 
insufficient research regarding how the onset of related phobias is affected by the initial 
exposure to the feared object or situation, or the context of the exposure (such as the 
presence of social support or stress, and the magnitude of the exposure itself). Furthermore, 
little is known about the possibility of crossover from one type of specific phobia to another. 
Future research could illuminate these possibilities.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched PubMed on Oct 11, 2017, combining MeSH and open terms for phobias 
(“phobia*”[tw]) and epidemiology (“Epidemiologic Studies”[MeSH:NoExp] OR 
“Observational Study”[Publication Type] OR “Observational Study as Topic”[MeSH] 
OR “Cohort Studies”[MeSH] OR “epidemiologic study”[tw] OR “epidemiologic studies”
[tw] OR “follow up”[tw] OR “longitudinal”[tw] OR “prospective*”[tw] OR 
“observational study”[tw] OR “observational studies”[tw]). The search was limited to 
studies in English and yielded 1536 records, which we assessed for their relevance to the 
prevalence, incidence, course, risk factors, or consequences of phobias. Citations 
included in reviews that did not meet the inclusion criteria were searched to identify 
relevant articles that the original search might have failed to capture.

Figure: Incidence of specific phobia by age of first onset
Data are from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area follow-up study61 of 1920 
respondents followed up from 1981 through 1993 (adapted from Public Mental Health 
[Oxford University Press] with permission). Kernel smoothing was applied, averaging 
incidence over a 5-year window to reduce variation.
