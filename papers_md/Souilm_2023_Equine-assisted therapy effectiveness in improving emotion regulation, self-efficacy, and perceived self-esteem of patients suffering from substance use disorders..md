Abstract
Substance Use Disorders (SUD) is a universal overwhelming public health problem and is associated with other 
psychological and mental health ailments such as emotion regulation, perceived self-esteem, and self-efficacy 
problems. Complementary and alternative medicine may be beneficial. The aim of this study was to assess the 
effectiveness of equine-assisted therapy in improving emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and perceived self-esteem 
among patients suffering from substance use disorders. It was carried out using a randomized controlled trial 
design at Behman hospital, Cairo, Egypt. It included 100 patients suffering from SUD attending the setting, equally 
randomized into an intervention group to receive the equine assisted therapy and a control group to receive the 
regular care. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire with standardized tools for assessment of 
emotion regulation, General Self-Efficacy (GSE), and perceived self-esteem. The intervention group received weekly 
equine-assisted therapy sessions over 6 weeks in addition to their standard regular therapy. Patients in both groups 
had similar demographic and SUD characteristics, as well as baseline scores of reappraisals, suppression, GSE and 
perceived self-esteem. At post-intervention, the intervention group had significant improvements in all these 
scores in comparison with the control group, as well as their baseline. The multivariate analysis identified the study 
intervention as a significant positive predictor of the reappraisal and GSE scores, and a negative predictor of the 
suppression and perceived self-esteem negative score. In conclusion, equine assisted-therapy as a complementary 
treatment in patients suffering from SUD is effective in improving their emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and 
perceived self-esteem. A wider use of this approach is recommended in SUD patients along with provision of 
needed facilities and resources, and training nurses in its administration. Further research is proposed to assess its 
long-term effectiveness. The clinical trial was registered in the “Clinical Trials.gov Protocol Registration and Results 
System (PRS);” registration number is (05632185/2022) and the full date of first registration is 10/11/2022.

RESEARCHOpen AccessIntroduction
Substance  Use  Disorders  (SUD)  is  a  term  replacing  the 
diagnoses  of  abuse  and  dependence  adopted  in  DSM-4 
and  DSM-5  [1].  It  is  an  overwhelming  public  health 
problem  throughout  the  world,  with  increasing  trends 
throughout the last few decades [2]. This could be attrib-
uted  to  many  social  determinants  such  as  feeling  of 
insecurity,  trauma,  severe  distress,  and  repression  [3]. 
It  involves  intricate  interactions  between  the  life  expe-
riences  of  the  affected  person  and  his/her  brain  paths 
and  circuits,  and  the  genetic  and  environmental  factors 
[4]. The disorder is associated with high rates of mortal-
ity and morbidity even more than any other preventable 
conditions [5].

The  patients  suffering  from  SUD  are  often  affected  by 
other  psychological  and  mental  health  problems.  For 
instance, many of these patients may have their ability to 
regulate emotions disrupted, and this could be the cause 
underlying  their  SUD.  They  are  unable  to  adequately 
adjust  positive  and  painful  emotions  in  response  to  dif-
ficult situations, or to regulate their emotions. Therefore, 
they  may  try  substance  use  to  help  themselves  reach  a 
balance of emotions [6].

Moreover,  SUD  patients  may  have  a  feeling  of  low 
perceived  self-esteem  [7],  so  that  improving  their  self-
esteem proved to be of great help in the success of their 
treatment  [8].  Similarly,  self-efficacy  plays  an  important 
role in the proper management of SUD since it reflects a 
person’s ability to use own skills in a certain situation to 
achieve a certain goal, and thus it was shown to improve 
the prognoses of SUD patients [9].

Although SUD is considered a stigma in many cultures 
[10], it is a disease that needs to be treated with no dis-
crimination  against  affected  patients  [11].  Despite  the 
high  prevalence  of  SUD  worldwide,  both  in  developed 
and  developing  countries,  a  majority  of  patients  suffer-
ing  from  this  disorder  do  not  receive  proper  treatment 
[12].  Treatment  modalities  are  numerous,  and  they 
tend  to  modify  patients’  behaviors  ultimately  leading  to 
abstinence  [13].  Meanwhile,  recent  cognitive-behav-
ioral  treatment  modalities  try  to  foster  patients’  coping 
with stressful events and various tempting-craving cues. 
Examples  are  reconsolidation-based  and  mindfulness-
based  interventions,  virtual-reality,  and  pharmacologic 
augmentation  approaches  [14].  Complementary  and 
alternative  medicine  seem  to  gain  more  attention  in 
the  management  of  SUD  [15].  Failure  of  treatment  and 
relapse is common in SUD. However, a systematic review 
concluded  that  there  is  no  universal  consensus  upon 
what  constitutes  a  relapse,  and  how  to  distinguish  early 
from late relapse [16].

Equine-Assisted  Therapy 

treatment 
approach  where  patients  do  interact  with  horses  with 
or without actual mounting activities or riding [17]. The 

(EAT) 

is  a

approach  is  based  on  helping  the  occurrence  of  a  regu-
lated  purposeful  interaction  between  a  physically  able 
person  and  a  live  horse  through  a  facilitator,  often  a 
mental  health  professional  certified  in  animal-assisted 
therapy.  It  is  based  on  developing  a  successful  commu-
nication between the patient and the horse [18]. It helps 
through having a common focus, improving motivations 
and self-confidence, fostering positive emotions, in addi-
tion to the benefits of physical activity [19]..

Furthermore,  research  proposed  that  such  interaction 
with the horses in equine assisted therapy involves trust, 
patience,  and  respect.  It  could  alleviate  patients’  anxi-
ety  and  improve  control  of  emotions,  with  less  tenden-
cies to disruptive behavior. It was also shown to improve 
balance,  trust,  wellbeing,  self-esteem,  and  self-efficacy 
among patients suffering a wide spectrum of psychologi-
cal and mental disorder [20, 21].

Significance of the study

Substance use disorders represent a major public health 
problem  worldwide  as  well  as  in  Egypt.  The  preva-
lence  rates  have  increasing  trends.  Treatment  modali-
ties  are  diverse  and  have  a  wide  range  of  success  rates. 
Although  novel  approaches  as  equine-assisted  therapy 
show encouraging results, there is still deficient research 
addressing it, particularly in Egypt.

Aim of the study

To  assess  the  effectiveness  of  equine-assisted  therapy  in 
improving  emotion  regulation,  self-efficacy,  and  per-
ceived  self-esteem  among  patients  suffering  from  sub-
stance use disorders.

Research hypotheses

Compared  with  control  group  patients,  (1)  Patients  suf-
fering  from  substance  use  disorder  (SUD  exposed  to 
equine-assisted  therapy  will  have  significantly  better 
emotion  regulation  (higher  reappraisal  and  lower  sup-
pression  scores);  (2)  Patients  suffering  from  substance 
use disorder exposed to equine-assisted therapy will have 
significantly  higher  GSE  scores;  (3)  Patients  suffering 
from  substance  use  disorder  exposed  to  equine-assisted 
therapy  will  have  significantly  better  perceived  self-
esteem (lower scores)..

Participants and methods
Research design

The  design  used  in  carrying  out  the  study  was  random-
ized  controlled  trial.  Since  the  intervention  (exposure 
to  and  dealing  with  horses  vs.  not)  could  not  be  hidden 
from  participants  or  investigators  given  its  nature,  the 
trial was open-label, i.e. not double blind.

Setting

The  study  was  conducted  at  Behman  hospital,  Helwan, 
Cairo, Egypt. It was inaugurated in 1940 as the first Egyp-
tian private psychiatric hospital. With a 210-bed capacity, 
the  hospital  is  considered  as  one  of  the  biggest  medical 
centers in Cairo, Egypt. The hospital provides care for all 
sectors  of  patients  in  Egypt,  especially  in  Cairo.  It  uses 
multidisciplinary  approaches  to  treatment  plans,  with 
complementary  therapies,  and  provision  different  inter-
vention options designed to enhance patients’ therapeu-
tic journeys. Available alternative treatments include art 
therapy,  dance  movement  and  music  therapy,  yoga  and 
physiotherapy, and equine psychotherapy. The hospital is 
the pioneer of equine psychotherapy in Egypt.

Participants

The study population consisted of patients suffering from 
substance  use  disorder  receiving  their  care  at  Behman 
Hospital during the time of the study. The inclusion cri-
teria were being adult diagnosed with substance use dis-
order,  hospitalized  for  at  least  one  month  in  the  study 
hospital,  and  physically  able  to  deal  with  horses.  Those 
patients suffering from any other physical or psychologi-
cal  ailments  preventing  them  from  active  participation 
in  the  intervention  were  excluded.  Using  the  G*Power 
sample  size  software  program,  the  required  sample  size 
per  group  was  50  to  detect  scores’  improvement  with  a 
medium effect size (0.60) at 95% level of confidence and 
80%  power  accounting  for  an  expected  dropout  rate  of 
about 20%. A total of 150 patients were enrolled, of which 
30 were  excluded  for not meeting the eligibility criteria, 
and  20  for  refusing  participation  (Fig.  1).  The  remain-
ing  100  were  equally  randomized,  using  simple  random 
numbers computer program, into an intervention group 
to  receive  the  equine  assisted  therapy  and  a  control 
group to receive the regular care used in the setting.  A 
list  of  the  recruited  100  patients  fulfilling  the  eligibility 
criteria  was  prepared  with  enumeration  from  1  to  100. 
Computer-generated  random  numbers  were  obtained 
for the two groups. Each patient was assigned to the cor-
responding group (intervention or  control)  according to 
his/her number in the list..

Data collection tools

Data  were  collected  using  a  self-administered  question-
naire with standardized tools for assessment of emotion 
regulation,  General  Self-Efficacy,  and  perceived  self-
esteem, in addition to a section for the demographic and 
disease characteristics developed by the researchers. This 
covered data about patient age, gender, university educa-
tion, marital status, residence, job status, income, as well 
as  age  at  start  and  duration  of  substance  of  use,  length 
of  hospital  stay,  number  of  substances  used  and  their 
types. The questionnaire was reviewed by five experts in 

psychiatric  nursing  for  the  completeness  of  the  demo-
graphic  and  medical  parts  and  for  the  relevance  of  the 
three standardized scales.

The  first  tool  was  the  emotion  regulation  question-
naire  developed  by  Gross  and  John.  [22]  It  was  used  to 
assess  how  respondents  tend  to  regulate  their  emotions 
positively  through  cognitive  reappraisal,  or  negatively 
through  expressive  suppression.  It  consists  of  ten  state-
ments: 6 for cognitive reappraisal (such as “When I want 
to feel more positive emotion, I change the way I’m think-
ing about the situation”), and 4 for expressive suppression 
(4  statements  such  as  “When  I  am  feeling  negative  emo-
tions, I make sure not to express them”). The responses are 
on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from “strongly dis-
agree”  to  “strongly  agree.” The  scores  of  each  dimension 
are summed giving a total score ranging from 6 to 42 for 
the appraisal dimension and from 4 to 28 for the suppres-
sion dimension. A higher score indicates more appraisal 
or more suppression. Scoring is kept continuous accord-
ing  to  tool  instructions.  The  tool  demonstrated  high 
validity and reliability in previous studies [23, 24]. Addi-
tionally, the reliability of this scale was assessed through 
its  internal  consistency,  and  it  proved  to  be  high  with 
Cronbach’s alpha coefficients 0.74.

The  second  tool  was  the  GSE  scale  developed  by 
Schwarzer  and  Jerusalem  [25].  It  also  has  10  statements 
on  a  4-point  Likert  type  scale  ranging  from  “not  at  all 
true” (scored 1) to “exactly true” (scored 4). Examples of 
statements are: “It is easy for me to stick to my aims and 
accomplish my goals,” and “I can solve most problems if I 
invest the necessary effort.” A total score ranging from 10 
to  40  is  obtained  simple  summation  of  items’  scores.  A 
higher score means more GSE. The reliability of the tool 
as well as its concurrent and predictive validity were doc-
umented [26]. Its reliability in the present study was high 
with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient 0.96.

The  third  tool  was  the  self-esteem  test  developed  by 
Sorensen [27]. The tool has 50 statements such as: “I often 
feel  like  I  don’t  know  what  is  expected  of  me,”  and  “I  am 
not very aware of my feelings.” The respondent is asked to 
check  the  statements  he/she  feels  true  for  him/her.  The 
number of items checked is calculated, ranging from zero 
to 50. A higher number indicates lower self-esteem. The 
tool was validated and showed good reliability [28]. The 
reliability  of  this  scale  was  high  with  Cronbach’s  alpha 
coefficients 0.78.

Administrative and ethical considerations

The  researchers  got  the  required  official  permissions  to 
carry out study through a letter addressed from the Dean 
of the Faculty of Nursing, Beni-Suef University to the hos-
pital directors explaining the study aim and procedures, 
with  a  copy  of  the  self-administered  questionnaire.  The 
study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee in

faculty of medicine, Beni- Suef university, Egypt; approval 
number (0006240). All Helsinki Declaration research eth-
ics  principles  were  complied  with.  An  informed  written 
consent  was  obtained  from  each  patient  at  recruitment. 
The clinical trial was registered in the “Clinical Trials.gov 
Protocol  Registration  and  Results  System  (PRS);”  regis-
tration number is (NCT05632185/2022) and the full date 
of  first  registration  is  30/11/2022.  Available  at:https://
ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT05632185.

The researchers clearly  explained the  aim  of  the study 
and its maneuvers to every patient, along with informa-
tion about their rights before inviting them to participate. 
They  were  clearly  informed  that  participation  is  totally 
voluntary,  and  that  they  may  withdraw  any  time  with 

no  reason  required.  They  were  also  reassured  about  the 
confidentiality of any obtained information. An informed 
written  consent  was  obtained  from  each  patient  at 
recruitment.

Pilot study

A pilot study was carried out on a sample of ten patients 
representing 10% of the main study sample size in order 
to assess the clarity of the tools and the practicability of 
the  study  procedures.  The  tool  was  fine-tuned  accord-
ing to the results of the pilot. These ten patients were not 
included  in  the  main  study  to  avoid  any  contamination 
bias.

Fieldwork

Upon  obtaining  official  permission,  the  researchers 
started the patients’ recruitment process according to the 
eligibility criteria. A total of 150 patients were screened, 
and of these 100 were enrolled. They were asked to fill in 
the data collection forms. The filled forms were collected 
by  the  researchers  and  reviewed  for  completeness.  The 
patients  were  then  randomized  into  the  equine-assisted 
therapy intervention group and the control group.

The 

intervention  group  patients  received  weekly 
equine-assisted therapy 40–60 min sessions over a period 
of 6 weeks in addition to their standard regular therapy. 
In  the  frst  session,  the  researchers  gave  a  presentation 
of the program’s aim and objectives, its sessions, as well 
as  the  procedures  to  be  followed  throughout  the  inter-
vention.  The  second  to  the  sixth  sessions  were  practical 
sessions.  An  equine  therapy  session  typically  consists 
of  specific  tasks  and  challenges  to  overcome,  with  the 
aid  and  guidance  of  horses.  There  is  no  riding  involved 
and  no  specific  skills  are  necessary  to  take  part  in  these 
sessions,  e.g.,  the  session  might  involve  the  patient  suc-
cessfully  leading  the  horse  from  one  spot  to  another,  or 
putting  a  halter  on  the  horse,  grooming,  or  feeding.  By 
the end of the session, the patient discusses with the ther-
apist  what  ideas  and  thoughts  he/she  used  to  complete 
the  task.  Once  the  session  ends,  the  patients  along  with 
their  therapists  reflect  on  the  experience  and  the  emo-
tions that were evoked by the interaction.

The control group had the same standard regular treat-
ment  modalities  with  the  only  exception  of  not  having 
the  equine-assisted  therapy.  At  the  end  of  the  interven-
tion, all patients in both groups were asked to fill in the 
self-administered  questionnaire  in  order  to  assess  the 
effectiveness  of  the  equine-assisted  therapy.  Thus,  data 
were  collected  at  two  points  in  time.  To  compensate 
for  the  potential  bias  of  the  open-label  design  where 
the  intervention  (due  to  its  nature)  could  not  be  con-
cealed  from  the  patients  and  the  researchers,  blinding 
was  applied  during  the  processes  of  data  collection  and 
analysis. Therefore, the data collectors who dealt with the 
patients  and  the  data  analyst  did  not  know  whether  the 
information came from a patient in the intervention or in 
the control group. The fieldwork lasted from February to 
July 2022..

Statistical analysis

Categorical  variables  were  described  as  frequencies 
and  percentages,  while  numeric  ones  were  presented  as 
means, standard deviations, and medians. The reliability 
of  the  scales  used  was  examined  using  Cronbach  alpha 
coefficients.  Chi-squared  tests  were  applied  in  categori-
cal  variables’  analyses.  Student  t-test  and  paired  t-test 
were used for comparisons of numeric variables (scores) 
between  and  within  groups  after  checking  for  required 

assumptions.  Multiple  linear  regression  analyses  were 
carried out to identify the independent predictors of the 
scores of reappraisal, suppression, GSE, and self-esteem. 
Statistical  significance  was  considered  at  p < 0.05.  Data 
entry and analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Sta-
tistics  for  Windows,  version  20  (IBM  Corp.,  Armonk, 
N.Y., USA).

Results
Table 1 demonstrates that patients in the study and con-
trol  groups  have  similar  demographic  charateristics. 
The  highest  percentages  were  in  the  age  group  30-<50 
years, with equal gender distribution in the study group 
and slightly more men in the control group (56.0%). The 
intervention  group  had  slightly  less  university  graduates 
(p = 0.03).

Table 2 shows that in more than a half of the patients in 
both groups the age at start was 15 years and older. The 
duration of substance use was slightly longer (5 years or 
more) in the control group (52.0%) compared to the study 
group  (46.0%).  The  majority  of  the  patients  in  the  two 
groups were using 2 or more substances, most commonly 
opiates/narcotics, and sedatives/ tranquillizers. No statis-
tically  significant  differences  were  revealed  between  the 
two groups.

As illustrated in Table 3, no statistically significant dif-
ferences could be demonstrated between the intervention 
and  control  groups’  pre-intervention  scores  of  reap-
praisal, suppression, GSE and perceived self-esteem (neg-
ative).  At  post-intervention,  the  intervention  group  had 
significantly  higher  scores  of  reappraisal  and  GSE  and 
lower  scores  of  suppression  and  perceived  self-esteem 
(negative). The table also indicates statistically significant 
increases  in  the  intervention  group  post-intervention 
scores of reappraisal and GSE and decreases in their sup-
pression  and  perceived  self-esteem  (negative)  scores.  In 
the control group, only a statistically significant increase 
in  post-intervention  scores  of  GSE  and  decrease  in  the 
perceived self-esteem (negative) scores were revealed.

The  multivariate  analysis  (Table  4)  identified  the  time 
(pre-post)  as  well  as  the  study  intervention  as  the  only 
statistically significant independent positive predictors of 
the  reappraisal  score.  However,  they  explain  only  5%  of 
the  variance  of  this  score.  As  for  the  suppression  score, 
the table indicates that the time (pre-post) and the study 
intervention were its statistically significant independent 
negative  predictors,  in  addition  to  the  duration  of  use. 
The  model  explains  18%  of  the  variance  of  the  suppres-
sion score.

As regards GSE score, Table 5 shows that the time (pre-
post) and the study intervention were its statistically sig-
nificant  independent  positive  predictors,  in  addition  to 
the  number  of  substances  used,  although  of  borderline 
significance (p = 0.076). Together, they explain 26% of the

variance  of  this  score.  The  table  also  demonstrates  that 
the time (pre-post) and the study intervention were sta-
tistically  significant  independent  negative  predictors  of 
the self-esteem negative score. The model explains 26% of 
the variance of this score.

Discussion
The  present  hypothesized  that  in  comparison  with  con-
trol  group  patients,  the  patients  suffering  from  sub-
stance  use  disorder  exposed  to  equine-assisted  therapy 
will  have  significantly  better  emotion  regulation  (higher 
reappraisal  and  lower  suppression  scores,  higher  GSE 
scores  and  better  perceived  self-esteem  (lower  scores). 
The results demonstrated that the applied study interven-
tion was a significant positive predictor of the reappraisal 
score and GSE scores and negative predictor of the sup-
pression  of  the  self-esteem  negative  score.  The  findings 
thus lead to acceptance of the set research hypotheses.

The  patients  were  randomized  to  the  intervention 
and  control  groups  and  the  randomization  process 
was  succesful  providing  two  groups  with  almost  simi-
lar  demographic  and  medical  charateristics.  This  is 
quite  important  in  order  to  carry  out  a  fair  comparison 
between  the  two  groups.  The  only  difference  of  statisti-
cal  significance  between  the  two  groups  was  related  to 
their  educational  level,  where  less  patients  in  interven-
tion  group  were  having  university  education.  However, 
this  variable  had  no  confounding  effect  as  shown  in  the 
results of the multivariate analyses.

According to the current study findings, the age at start 
of substance use was mostly 15 years or older among the 
patients  in  both  groups.  This  is  the  age  of  middle  ado-
lescence  when  the  youth  tend  to  experiment  with  new 
things and have more risky behaviors. In line with this, a 
meta-analysis reported that the peak age at start of SUD 
was 19.5 years [29]. The early onset of substance use has 
been  demonstrated  to  have  an  impact  on  users’  person-
ality  and  the  trajectory  of  use  in  a  study  in  Turkey  [30]. 
Moreover, a great majority of these were poly-substance 
users. This is expected at this age where adolescents like 
to  try  different  substances  to  compare  and  contrast.  In 
line with this, a study in the United States described the 
trajectories  of  substance  abuse  among  adolescents  and 
found that the highest percentages were starting in mid-
dle  adolescence  and  were  using  many  substances  at  the 
same time [31].

As  regards  the  types  of  substances  used,  opiates  and 
narcotics  as  well  as  sedatives  and  tranquillizers  were 
most commonly reported among patients in the present 
study. The findings are  in partial agreement with Wake-
man et al. [32] whose study in the United States revealed 
that  opioids  were  the  most  common  type  of  substances 
used, followed by alcohol and stimulants. The differences 
could  be  attributed  to  different  cultural  factors  as  well 

as  the  availability  of  substances.  As  for  the  duration  of 
substance use, around half of the patients in the current 
study  reported  5  years  or  longer. This  would  have  a  sig-
nificant influence on treatment and its outcomes as dem-
onstrated in another study in the United States [33].

The  current  study  assessed  and  compared  patients’ 
emotion control (reappraisal and suppression), GSE and 
perceived  self-esteem  in  the  study  and  control  groups 
before  the  intervention.  The  results  revealed  no  sig-
nificant  differences  between  the  two  groups,  with  both 
having low scores of reappraisals and GSE and high sup-
pression  scores.  The  findings  are  of  great  importance 
given  the  essential  role  of  emotion  regulation  in  mental 
health  as  clarified  in  a  study  in  Pakistan  [6].  Moreover, 
GSE  plays  a  positive  role  in  the  change  of  the  behavior 
of  the  patients  suffering  from  substance  use  disorder, 
and  consequently  on  the  success  of  their  treatment  as 
reported  in  a  study  in  New  Mexico  [34]. These  authors, 
through their review of a number of studies, highlighted 
that self-efficacy was among the major supportive mech-
anisms for SUD patients enhancing their recovery.

Meanwhile,  the  present  study  intervention  and  con-
trol patients’ pre-intervention self-esteem median scores 
were  indicative  of  slight  low  self-esteem  in  at  least  one 
half  of  the  samples.  This  is  of  major  importance  in  the 
prognosis  of  these  patients  since  good  self-esteem  has 
been  shown  to  protect  against  psychological  distress 
among patients under treatment of substance use disor-
der in a study in Norway [7]. In their study, these authors 
used  the  same  tool  (Rosenberg  Self-Esteem  Scale)  for 
assessment  of  self-esteem  as  in  our  study,  which  would 
make  the  comparison  more  valid.  They  clarified  that 
improving  self-esteem  would  act  through  the  relief  of 
psychological distress of SUD patients. This “salutogenic” 
effect can help their full recovery.

The  implementation  of  the  current  study  equine-
assisted  therapy  led  to  statistically  significant  improve-
ments  in  the  intervention  group  patients’  emotion 
regulation, both reappraisal and suppression dimensions, 
as  well  as  in  GSE  and  perceived  self-esteem.  The  effect 
of  this  intervention  was  confirmed  in  the  results  of  the 
multivariate  analyses. The  effect  of  the  intervention  was 
additive  to  the  effect  of  the  regular  treatment  modali-
ties, particularly regarding the improvement of GSE and 
self-esteem as shown in bivariate analyses of the control 
group patients. In agreement with the benefits of equine-
assisted  therapy  in  substance  use  disorder,  Marchand 
et  al.  [35]  in  a  study  of  complementary  therapies  used 
in  SUD  patients  highlighted  its  effectiveness  through 
improving  their  mindfulness. They  used  an  intervention 
combining mindfulness training with exposure to nature 
through recreational sailing.

Furthermore,  the  results  of  the  current  study  are  in 
congruence  with  those  reported  by  Fridén  et  al.  [19]  in 

Souilm BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies          (2023) 23:363 a study in Sweden. In their qualitative study, the respon-
dents  indicated  that  dealing  and  interacting  with  the 
horses  can  improve  the  health  capabilities  of  psychotic 
patients,  enhance  their  self-confidence  and  motivation, 
cultivates positive emotions, and fosters physical activity 
as well. A similar success of equine-assisted therapy was 
reported  by  Aviv  et  al.  [36]  where  improvement  in  self-
esteem was demonstrated following equine-assisted ther-
apy. However, their study was on ADHD children where 
this  therapeutic  approach  improved  their  self-esteem 
and consequently their executive functions. This adds to 
the value of equine therapy in the management of a wide 
spectrum of psychological and mental health problems.

Our  study  has  points  of  strength  and  limitations.  To 
our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  in  Egypt  utilizing 
the equine therapy in the management of SUD patients. 
The main study limitation is the paucity of similar studies 
published in peer-reviewed journals, which did not help 
the researchers to introduce the topic and to discuss the 
study findings. The bias associated with open-label design 
could not be avoided, but it was dealt with through blind-
ing  the  processes  of  data  collection  and  analysis,  which 
were done by individuals other than the researchers.

Conclusion and recommendations
The  use  of  equine  assisted-therapy  as  a  complementary 
treatment  in  patients  suffering  from  substance  use  dis-
orders is effective in improving their emotion regulation, 
self-efficacy, and self-esteem.

The  study  recommends  the  adoption  of  this  comple-
mentary approach in the treatment of SUD patients. The 
required facilities and resources should be made available 
in  specialized  governmental  and  private  SUD  treatment 
centers. The nurses in these facilities need to be trained 
in  its  administration.  Further  research  is  proposed  to 
assess its long-term effectiveness in SUD patients.
