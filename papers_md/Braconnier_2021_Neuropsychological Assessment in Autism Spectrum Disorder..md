Abstract
Purpose of Review  Neuropsychological assessment involves the comprehensive evaluation of intellectual, attentional, execu-
tive, social-cognitive, language, and motor functioning. Such assessments are used to characterize areas of strength and 
weakness, inform differential diagnosis, guide treatment planning, and evaluate change over time. Individuals with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) present with varied clinical presentations, which can make the design of testing batteries and 
subsequent interpretation of results challenging. Here we provide an overview of neuropsychological domains as they relate 
to the evaluation of individuals with ASD.
Recent Findings  Individuals with ASD demonstrate unique patterns of neuropsychological functioning across various 
domains. Recent findings related to intellectual, adaptive, executive, attentional, social, language, motor, and autism-specific 
functioning are reviewed.
Summary  Clarifying the relationship between ASD symptoms and neuropsychological functioning is critical for differential 
diagnosis and for optimal treatment planning. Tools and methods for developing appropriate neuropsychological testing 
protocols for individuals with ASD are discussed.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental 
disorder characterized by deficits in social communication 
and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive behaviors 
[1]. In addition to core symptoms of ASD, this heterogenous 
population presents with a wide range of abilities. While 
many individuals on the autism spectrum demonstrate aver-
age to above average intellectual functioning, approximately 
30% also meet criteria for intellectual disability (ID) [2]. 
Furthermore, an estimated 60–70% of children and 69–79% 
of adults with ASD meet criteria for at least one comorbid 
psychiatric  condition,  such  as  attention-deficit/hyperac-
tivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or other mood disorders 
[3–5]. The complexity of presentation that results from a 
broad spectrum of functioning, and varied behavioral and 
emotional presentations, can make the neuropsychological 
assessment process for individuals with ASD challenging 
and at times overlooked. Clinically, many ASD-focused 
evaluations include measures such as the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule, 2nd Edition (ADOS-2) [6] and the 
Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) [7], along 
with a measure of IQ and adaptive behavior as a standard 
evaluation  protocol;  however,  fewer  individuals  on  the 
autism spectrum are administered more traditional neuropsy-
chological assessments leaving domains such as memory, 
attention, and other executive functions less frequently char-
acterized. In order to fill this assessment gap, it is critical for 
clinicians to understand the utility and appropriate applica-
tion of various neuropsychological assessments for use in 
individuals with ASD at varying levels of ability and to gain 
competence in proper interpretation based on research using 
neuropsychological assessments in this population.

This paper provides an overview of recent literature and 
concludes with recommendations for the development of 
appropriate neuropsychological testing protocols.

Intellectual and Adaptive Functioning

Impairment in cognitive functioning is widely recognized 
as a common feature of ASD, as well as a predictor of long-
term outcomes [8]. The prevalence of comorbid ID has been 
shown to vary depending on demographic variables (e.g., 
location, race/ethnicity) and methodology used to assess IQ 

Current Psychiatry Reports (2021) 23: 63

[2], underscoring the need for clinicians to understand the 
tests best suited to assess IQ in autistic individuals at varying 
levels of ability.

The Wechsler Intelligence Scales [9–12] are among the 
most frequently used measures for assessing intelligence 
[13]. Depending on the individual’s age, the Wechsler sub-
tests examine verbal comprehension, visual-spatial reason-
ing, fluid reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. 
A recent systematic review examining multiple versions of 
the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) in 
youth with ASD identified common patterns of cognitive 
functioning, including the “islets of ability” profile (i.e., low 
verbal comprehension scores and high visual-spatial and 
working memory scores [14]) in those with Full-Scale IQ 
(FSIQ) scores ≤ 85 and the “right-descending” profile (i.e., 
high verbal comprehension and visual-spatial scores and 
low processing speed scores) in those with FSIQ scores ≥ 86 
[15•]. Similarly, adults with ASD have been shown to dem-
onstrate deficits in processing speed and verbal reasoning 
subtests of the WAIS-IV, as well as inconsistent skills on 
perceptual reasoning tasks [16]. In addition to the Wechsler 
Scales, other measures of intelligence frequently used for 
individuals with ASD include the Stanford-Binet Intelli-
gence Scales, Fifth Edition (SB-5) [17] and the Differential 
Ability Scales-II (DAS-II) [18]. The SB-5 demonstrated 
strong convergent validity with corresponding indices of 
the WISC-IV in youth with ASD, though FSIQ scores were 
found to be higher and scores on verbal subtests were found 
to be lower on the SB-5 compared to the WISC-IV [19]. 
While the DAS-II is often used to characterize intelligence 
in children with ASD, recent work by Clements et al. sug-
gests that the verbal and nonverbal reasoning composite 
scores are more valid than the spatial ability composite 
score, which underestimates ability in this population [20].
The above-mentioned assessments are not appropriate for 
children below 2 years of age, and many of the tests require 
verbal responses, making the measures described above ill-
suited for individuals with few to no words. Soorya et al. 
provide a framework for the neuropsychological evaluation 
of individuals with profound intellectual and multiple dis- 
abilities, which emphasizes the need for (1) a multi-informant  
and multi-assessment testing battery, (2) the assessment 
of comorbid symptoms prior to developing an appropriate 
testing battery, (3) the use of unstandardized approaches to 
evaluate intellectual functioning, and (4) the understand-
ing that individuals with profound intellectual and multiple 
disabilities are not “untestable” due to lack of standardized 
measures for this population [21]. Developmental assess-
ments, such as the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) 
[22], the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 
3rd Edition (Bayley-III) [23], and the Psychoeducational 
Profile, 3rd Edition (PEP-3) [24], may be more appropri-
ate for younger children with ASD and individuals with 

1 3Current Psychiatry Reports (2021) 23: 63

lower language abilities for whom valid scores cannot be 
obtained using traditional cognitive assessments. Nonverbal 
assessments, such as the Leiter International Performance 
Scales–3 (Leiter-3) [25], have also been recommended [26]; 
however, many tasks on the Leiter-3 require matching and 
pointing skills. As scores on cognitive versus developmental 
assessments have been shown to vary significantly as a func-
tion of cognitive ability [27], interchanging or comparing 
resulting IQ scores is not recommended. Using developmen-
tal quotients (DQ; the ratio of mental age to chronological 
age) in place of IQ allows for comparison between different 
assessments and accounts for the inability of individuals 
with cognitive and developmental delays to obtain standard 
scores using available norms [28].

Adaptive functioning is defined as one’s ability to be 
self-sufficient in executing real-life skills, such as effectively 
communicating and interacting with others, managing one’s 
own health and hygiene, and completing household tasks and 
chores, given their cognitive level [29, 30]. While traditional 
neuropsychological evaluations do not routinely administer 
measures of adaptive behavior, low adaptive functioning is 
a diagnostic criterion of ID [1] and is a common deficit in 
individuals with ASD [29], including those without ID [30]. 
Measuring adaptive functioning is therefore an important 
component of the evaluation process for individuals on the 
autism spectrum of all levels of ability. The Vineland Adap-
tive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3) [31], is a 
leading instrument for assessing adaptive behavior in the 
diagnosis of intellectual and developmental disabilities. 
As this measure relies on informant-report as opposed to 
self-report, it is appropriate for the assessment of those with 
lower language and cognitive abilities. Importantly, the most 
recent version of the Vineland-3 generally produces lower 
scores than the previous version of the measure, the Vine-
land-II [32], limiting interpretability of changes in scores 
between different editions. The Adaptive Behavior Assess-
ment System, 3rd Edition (ABAS-3) [33], is a questionnaire 
also commonly used to assess adaptive behavior in individu-
als with ASD. This measure is available in parent/caregiver- 
and teacher-report versions, as well as a self-report option 
for adults. The ABAS-3 has recently been found to yield 
higher overall scores compared to the Vineland-3 in youth 
with ASD without ID [34].

Executive Function

Executive functions are mental processes that direct an indi-
vidual’s thoughts, actions, and emotions, particularly during 
active problem solving. These functions include, but are not 
limited to, skills such as discerning appropriate goals for 
a particular task, planning and organizing an approach to 
problem solving, inhibiting distractions, initiating a task, 

using abstract reasoning, and demonstrating flexibility in 
trying a new approach [35]. While the characterization of 
executive function in ASD is important to determine appro-
priate interventions and accommodations, the literature on 
executive function strengths and weaknesses in this popula-
tion remains mixed. A recent meta-analysis by Demetriou 
et al. examined executive function abilities across various 
domains as well as the clinical utility of measures used 
to assess executive function in autistic individuals [36•]. 
Across 235 studies comprising more than 14,000 partici-
pants, a moderate overall effect for reduced executive func-
tion was found for individuals with ASD across all key 
domains (Concept Formation/Set Shifting, Mental Flexibil-
ity/Set Switching, Fluency, Planning, Response Inhibition, 
and Working Memory) and ages, suggesting broad and sta-
ble executive function deficits [36•].

Various  standardized  assessment  batteries  have  been 
used to assess executive function profiles in individuals on 
the autism spectrum, including the Delis-Kaplan Executive 
Functioning System (D-KEFS) [37] and the NEPSY-II [38]. 
The D-KEFS is a comprehensive assessment comprised of 
tasks related to conceptual flexibility, monitoring, and inhi-
bition [39]. Significant executive function deficits have been 
reported in individuals with ASD, particularly in the areas 
of cognitive flexibility and response inhibition [40]. Simi-
larly, on the NEPSY-II, a comprehensive neuropsychological 
battery that assesses six domains of cognitive functioning, 
including executive function, found that individuals with 
autism without ID displayed particular difficulties on tasks 
such as sorting, cognitive flexibility, and auditory attention 
[38]. Recent work by Lai et al. compared executive func-
tion profiles across studies utilizing a variety of behavioral 
assessments, including full test batteries such as the D-KEFS 
and NEPSY-II, as well as measures of individual aspects 
of executive function (e.g., Go-No-Go tasks, Stroop Color 
Word Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test), and found sig-
nificant executive function deficits in individuals with ASD 
consistent with prior literature in the domains of flexibility, 
planning, generativity, and working memory [35]. However, 
further work is needed to establish the reliability of such 
measures in ASD populations [36•], as well as appropriate 
modifications for those with ASD and ID or limited expres-
sive language.

Notably, Demetriou et al. found that very few measures 
of executive function achieved clinical sensitivity in ASD 
samples  (determined  by  the  overlap  percentage  statistic 
[OL%] representing the degree that the performance of the 
ASD group overlaps with the control group, with OL < 15% 
indicating  clinical  sensitivity)  [36•].  Of  the  measures 
that met specifications for clinical sensitivity, most were 
informant-report  questionnaires  based  on  the  Behavior 
Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-2) [41], a 
questionnaire available in parent-, teacher-, and self-report 

1 363   Page 4 of 9

versions assessing inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and 
emergent metacognition across contexts. While informant-
report measures offer valuable clinical information, they 
pose challenges for accurate assessment in the absence of 
direct observation. As executive functioning is an umbrella 
term that encompasses a wide range of skills, ratings across 
instruments may be impacted by differences in the specific 
constructs measured. Further, many domains of executive 
dysfunction overlap with common ASD symptomatology 
(e.g.,  cognitive  inflexibility,  difficulty  with  inhibition), 
leading to diagnostic overshadowing such as the tendency 
to attribute co-occurring behaviors to the ASD diagnosis. 
The challenge teasing apart ASD symptoms from prob-
lems related to weak executive functioning further limits 
the appropriateness of informant-report, particularly in the 
assessment of individuals with lower cognitive or language 
abilities for whom many questions on the BRIEF are not 
applicable. For this reason, it is important to consider a com-
bination of parent- and teacher-report of executive function 
together with direct observation using clinical interviews 
and standardized neuropsychological assessments.

Attention

Many domains of neuropsychological functioning, including 
intelligence and executive function, are impacted by atten-
tional capacity. While previous versions of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) did not 
allow for a dual diagnosis of autism and ADHD, attentional 
difficulties are now recognized as one of the most common 
comorbidities, with ADHD prevalence in people with ASD 
falling in the 40–70% range [42]. Those with more severe 
forms of ASD have been found to present with more signifi-
cant deficits in attention and behavior regulation [43]. The 
co-occurrence of ASD and attention problems is also associ-
ated with decreased adaptive skills [44], making the assess-
ment and treatment of ADHD symptoms in this population 
essential for improving long-term outcomes.

In order to better understand the unique neuropsychologi-
cal assessment needs of individuals on the autism spectrum 
with and without attention deficits, a recent study by Ng 
et al. administered standardized assessments of intellectual, 
attentional, social, and executive function to participants with 
ASD, ADHD, and comorbid ASD + ADHD and found dif-
fering symptom profiles depending on domain and informant 
[45•]. While parent-report on the Conners 3 [46], a question-
naire that measures domains such as attention and hyperac-
tivity, differentiated individuals with ASD from those with 
ADHD or ASD + ADHD, an objective attention task (i.e., the 
Conners Continuous Performance Test, 2nd Edition [47]) did 
not [45•]. Conversely, objective assessment of social func-
tioning and affect (i.e., NEPSY-II Affect Recognition and 

Theory of Mind tasks [38]) better differentiated both ASD 
groups from the ADHD alone group, with the ASD groups 
showing greater deficits in social perception, while parent-
report of social skills on the Social Responsiveness Scale, 
2nd Edition (SRS-2 [48]), did not [45•]. Interestingly, no 
significant group differences were identified related to execu-
tive function as measured by the D-KEFS Tower Test or the 
Children’s Category Test [45•]. This study emphasizes the 
benefits of integrating information from multiple sources to 
differentially assess ASD and attention problems, as well as 
the co-occurrence of the two. Inconsistencies across meas-
ures also indicate diagnoses should not be made based on 
results from any single instrument.

As  attention  and  behavioral  problems  are  positively 
related to ASD severity [43], it is important to assess the 
extent to which inattention and hyperactivity may interfere 
with cognitive testing of individuals with ASD. Inattention 
in ASD can impact performance on IQ tests, particularly on 
measures of processing speed and working memory [13], 
making the SB-5 a preferred measure of IQ in certain cir-
cumstances. In addition to caregiver- and teacher-report on 
measures such as the Conners 3 and the Behavior Assess-
ment  System  for  Children,  3rd  Edition  (BASC-3  [49]), 
which  have both been shown to differentiate ASD from 
ADHD [45•,50], subtests of the NEPSY-II that target atten-
tion and simple behavioral tasks, such as the Conners Con-
tinuous Performance Test, 3rd Edition (CPT 3 [51]), may 
provide clinical utility for characterizing attention problems 
in this population. Future studies should also investigate sex 
differences, as there is evidence from parent-report on the 
Conners 3 indicating males with ASD exhibit higher levels 
of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity compared to 
females [52].

Social Cognition and Affective Functioning

Social cognition focuses on how individuals process and 
understand interactions with others. As social communica-
tion is a core deficit of ASD [1], assessing the extent to which 
an individual’s social cognition impacts neuropsychological 
functioning is important. The main areas of social cognition 
typically assessed during a neuropsychological evaluation 
include theory of mind, emotion perception, social percep-
tion, social knowledge, and attributional style [13].

Recent work on the neuropsychological assessment of 
social cognition in autistic individuals has focused on the 
relationship between social cognition and both social and 
executive functioning. Bishop-Fitzpatrick et al. examined 
social cognition, measured by various theory of mind tasks, 
as a correlate of social functioning, measured by social 
domains of the Vineland-3 and the Child Behavior Check-
list (CBCL [53]), and found better social cognitive skills 

1 3 
Current Psychiatry Reports (2021) 23: 63

to be associated with greater social functioning [54]. This 
was particularly true for participants who performed well 
on second-order false belief tasks, which assess the extent 
to which one can recognize that others can hold false beliefs 
about someone else’s beliefs [54]. Difficulty with metacogni-
tive aspects of executive function, measured by the NEPSY-
II and the BRIEF, has also been shown to be associated with 
deficits in social functioning in those with ASD, including 
decreased engagement with peers, increased playground iso-
lation, and increased social problems [55, 56]. In order to 
optimally target social impairment in individuals with ASD, 
it is important to consider challenges in social cognition and 
social behavior as they relate to executive function skills.

The NEPSY-II also includes a Social Perception domain, 
which has been examined in individuals with ASD [57]. This 
domain includes two subtests targeting affect recognition 
and theory of mind skills, with tasks requiring both verbal 
and non-verbal (i.e., matching) responses that can be indi-
vidually administered depending on functioning level [38]. 
As with other areas of neuropsychological assessment, it is 
important to consider informant-report of social functioning, 
such as the Socialization domain of the Vineland-3. In addi-
tion, assessment of social cognition and behavior in autistic 
individuals generally includes autism-specific measures, 
such as the SRS-2, a questionnaire examining social behav-
ior; however, the SRS-2 may not be appropriate for use with 
more severely affected individuals on the autism spectrum, 
as co-occurring behavior problems, expressive language, 
and cognitive abilities can significantly impact total scores 
[58]. Additional autism-specific diagnostic assessments, 
which will be discussed in a later section, can also be used 
to examine social skills.

Language

Language abilities are an important consideration related to 
the diagnostic and neuropsychological evaluation of indi-
viduals with ASD. At least 30% of children with ASD do 
not acquire spoken language [59] and minimally verbal indi-
viduals with co-occurring ID are more likely to exhibit poor 
outcomes across cognitive, adaptive, and motor domains 
[26]. DiStefano et al. posits that measuring general verbal 
and nonverbal abilities (as opposed to more specific cogni-
tive domains) is the best method for evaluating intelligence 
in individuals with language and cognitive delays [26]. As 
quantifying  verbal  ability  is  critical  to  the  development 
of appropriate treatment recommendations, measures of 
expressive (e.g., Expressive Vocabulary Test, 3rd Edition 
[60]) and receptive (e.g., Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, 
5th Edition [61]) vocabulary are important aspects of neu-
ropsychological batteries and are worth attempting even in 
children with minimal language. The Clinical Evaluation 

of Language Fundamentals, Fifth Edition (CELF-5 [62]), 
is a flexible battery of tests to assess language ability and 
has demonstrated acceptable internal consistency for youth 
with ASD [63]. The CELF-5 includes certain subtests that 
require only pointing without verbal responses, as well as 
subtests that require verbal or written responses. Expressive 
and receptive language subtests from the Vineland-3 and the 
Mullen are also useful in establishing age equivalents.

Motor Functioning

Motor planning, which involves the ability to conceive, plan, 
and execute a purposeful motor action, is an integral devel-
opmental skill and a widely recognized deficit in individu-
als with ASD [13]. Individuals with ASD present with a 
range of motor challenges ranging from hypotonia to poor 
coordination. Motor slowing and other fine motor difficulties 
can also impact performance on timed tasks that include a 
motor component. It is therefore necessary to consider the 
potential impact of motor planning and motor slowing on 
an individual’s performance on standardized assessments.

A recent study examining the relationship between motor 
skills and intelligence in children with ASD demonstrated a 
positive association between motor functioning and perfor-
mance on neuropsychological measures [64]. In an examina-
tion of motor abilities using the Movement Assessment Bat-
tery for Children (MABC-2 [65]) and the Beery–Buktenica 
Developmental  Test  of  Visual-Motor  Integration  (Beery 
VMI-6 [66]) in youth with ASD, 20.8% of variance in per-
formance IQ on the WISC-V was explained by variance in  
motor skills, with significant associations between co-occurring  
ID  and  reduced  scores  on  the  MABC-2  across  domains  
of manual dexterity, aiming and catching, and balance [64]. 
Given  this  association,  results  from  tasks  dependent  on  
motor planning (e.g., Block Design and Coding on WISC-
V) must be interpreted with caution when administered in 
the presence of potential motor deficits. Children with ASD 
have also displayed difficulty with control and regulation  
of handwriting movements [67], which may impact results 
from standardized tests requiring written responses. In con-
junction  with  a  thorough  evaluation  of  motor  skills,  the  
identification of motor deficits can aid in decision making 
around an appropriate assessment battery, such as choosing 
assessments with fewer motor demands.

In  terms  of  measuring  motor  skills,  tests  such  as  the 
Beery VMI-6 and Purdue Pegboard are commonly used 
to measure visuomotor integration [68] and goal-directed 
movements, including finger dexterity, hand–eye coordina-
tion, and bimanual coordination [69] in individuals on the 
autism spectrum. Both measures are appropriate for use with 
individuals with comorbid ID who are able to comprehend 
task instructions. Informant-report on the Vineland-3 can 

1 363   Page 6 of 9

Current Psychiatry Reports (2021) 23: 63

also be used to gather information about motor functioning; 
however, the motor domains of the Vineland-3 are currently 
only normed through age 9. The Mullen provides both an 
assessment of early motor skills and measures of verbal and 
visual reception that require less motor planning than tra-
ditional intelligence tests, making the assessment of motor 
skills using these measures useful for individuals with cog-
nitive and motor delays. Targeting motor skills is critical 
to promoting optimal development in other areas of daily 
functioning.

Diagnostic Assessment

In addition to the domains outlined above, the neuropsy-
chological assessment of individuals with or suspected to 
have ASD should also include autism-specific diagnostic 
assessments to confirm diagnosis, clarify level (severity) 
of ASD, and to determine personal strengths and weak-
nesses. ASD diagnostic testing often includes standard-
ized semi-structured observational assessments, such as the 

ADOS-2 or the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second 
Edition (CARS-2 [70]), and the ADI-R, a standardized 
semi-structured interview administered to caregivers to 
assess developmental history and current autism symp-
toms. Further, the Social Communication Questionnaire 
(SCQ [71]) is a brief parent-report measure based on the 
ADI-R  that  evaluates  communication  skills  and  social 
functioning. Autism-specific questionnaires, such as the 
SRS-2, screen for ASD symptoms and provide additional 
data related to social functioning.

Due to limitations to in-person assessment during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the Brief Observation of Symptoms 
of  Autism  (BOSA  [72]),  an  adaptation  of  the  ADOS-2, 
was recently developed to assess ASD either remotely via 
telehealth or in-person with the parent leading the interac-
tion with the child. Additionally, the CARS-2 was recently 
adapted to include only items scored based on a clinical 
observation in an effort to expedite the clinician’s ability to 
diagnose ASD [73]. The CARS-2obs demonstrated the abil-
ity to differentiate individuals with ASD from those with 
non-ASD neuropsychiatric disorders with approximately

96% specificity and 62% sensitivity [73]. These measures 
offer promising early data on advances in autism screening.
Specific measures can be used to capture restricted and 
repetitive behaviors (RRBs) in greater detail. The Repetitive 
Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R [74]), for example, is used 
to assess RRBs in individuals on the autism spectrum across 
six domains: Stereotyped Behavior, Self-injurious Behavior, 
Compulsive Behavior, Routine Behavior, Sameness Behavior, 
and Restricted Behavior. This self- and parent/caregiver-report 
questionnaire has also been normed on individuals with ID [74].
Sensory symptoms are also highly prevalent in individu-
als with ASD and are only briefly captured on the ADOS-2 
and ADI-R. To aid in detailed evaluation of sensory symp-
toms several measures are available, including the Sensory 
Assessment  for  Neurodevelopmental  Disorders  (SAND 
[75]). The SAND is a clinician-administered direct obser-
vational assessment and corresponding caregiver interview 
that examines sensory hyperreactivity, hyporeactivity, and 
seeking behaviors across visual, tactile, and auditory modali-
ties. The SAND is appropriate for individuals of all levels 
of ability. Several caregiver report questionnaires have also 
demonstrated utility in quantifying sensory symptoms in  
individuals with ASD. The Sensory Profile 2 (SP-2 [76]) and the  
Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ [77]) are widely 
used questionnaires normed for individuals with ASD that 
assess sensory processing patterns across different contexts. 
Overall, these measures meaningfully supplement diagnostic 
and neuropsychological information gathered during other 
aspects of the assessment process.

presentations. Clarifying the relationship between ASD 
symptoms and other aspects of neuropsychological func-
tioning is critical for differential diagnosis and for optimal 
treatment planning. We recommend thorough neuropsy-
chological assessments should be used to aid in the dif-
ferential diagnosis of common co-occurring conditions, 
such as ADHD, which requires standardized assessment 
for proper diagnosis. Neuropsychological evaluations are 
also  an  important  method  to  monitor  progress  toward 
academic, occupational, and adaptive goals. Traditional 
clinician-administered neuropsychological assessments are 
often overlooked in the evaluation process of individu-
als with ASD and may be related to challenges such as 
access to expert neuropsychologists or psychologists with 
expertise in both ASD and neuropsychological assess-
ment as well as costs associated with such evaluations. 
Specialized neuropsychological testing is costly and often 
not covered, or poorly covered, by insurance. Families in 
rural or isolated geographic areas may experience greater 
difficulty accessing qualified evaluators. In addition, indi-
viduals with ASD often fail to be referred for comprehen-
sive neuropsychological evaluations due to a disconnec-
tion between the field of neuropsychology and the field of 
autism assessment in many clinical settings. Improving 
access to high-quality neuropsychological evaluations for 
individuals on the autism spectrum, of all levels of ability, 
is an important direction for the field.

Developing Neuropsychological Batteries

Conflict of interest  The authors declare no competing interests.

Figure 1 provides a summary of neuropsychological assess-
ment tools appropriate for individuals with ASD to help cli-
nician’s determine appropriate testing batteries for individu-
als with ASD of varying levels of functioning.

Conclusions

The field of clinical neuropsychology aims to examine 
the relationship between brain functioning and behavior 
in order to elucidate the nature and origin of an individ-
ual’s strengths and weaknesses in domains such as cog-
nition, attentional, executive, social-cognitive, language, 
and motor functioning. Given the heterogeneity of ASD 
and its diagnostic complexity, neuropsychological test-
ing of individuals suspected or confirmed to have ASD 
requires  clinical  expertise  to  design  personalized  test-
ing batteries and interpret results, while accounting for 
ASD symptomatology and common comorbid psychiatric
