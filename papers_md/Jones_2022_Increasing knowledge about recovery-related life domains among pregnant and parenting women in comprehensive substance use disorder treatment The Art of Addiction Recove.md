Abstract

Background: Group treatments designed specifically for pregnant and parenting women with 
substance use disorders are lacking. This study provides a preliminary assessment of the Art of 
Addiction Recovery Program, a manualized group treatment imbedded within a comprehensive 
substance use disorder treatment program for pregnant and parenting women.

Methods: The Program consists of 14 sessions, each focusing on a different topic, including 
health, social relationships, the recovery process, well-being, and introspection. Each session 
includes both the presentation of information by a facilitator, group discussions guided by 
the facilitator, and a creative project. A single-group pretest-posttest design provides an initial 
evaluation of the Art of Addiction Recovery Program.

Results: Participants were 51 women with an average age of 28.7 (SD=5.0) with most (69%) 
having a primary opioid use disorder and 82% reporting tobacco use. Significant (ps<.001) pre- to 
post-session increases in session-specific knowledge occurred for all 14 sessions with a measure 
of multivariate association indicating that these changes were substantial. Ratings of learning and 
effectiveness were generally high, with 19/28 means at 3.7 or above (maximum score=4).

Conclusions: Findings suggest that The Art of Addiction Recovery Program was effective 
in conveying knowledge about substance use and recovery, and that participants increased their 
knowledge and generally strongly agreed that the sessions provided high levels of learning and 
were highly effective. The Art of Addiction Recovery Program provides an option for those 
seeking a manual-based group treatment program as an aid in the treatment process for this 
subpopulation.

1. 

Introduction

Among populations with substance use disorders (SUDs), women are among the fastest 
growing (Grant et al., 2017). The process of seeking SUD treatment for women who 
are pregnant or parenting comes with particular challenges and barriers, such as shame, 
discrimination and stigma (Paris et al., 2020), fear of losing custody of one’s children (Elms 
et al., 2018), and fear related to a high likelihood of having been a victim of abuse or having 
experienced trauma (Keyser-Marcus et al., 2015). Treatment programs for this population 
require adaptation to the unique needs of the women, which may include integrating trauma-
informed practices (Covington, 2008) and providing childcare (Frazer et al., 2019). Group 
treatment has demonstrated efficacy in reducing substance use in the general population with 
SUDs (Sobell et al., 2009), and for women specifically (Hien et al., 2012; Valeri et al., 
2018).

To date, multiple manual-based group treatment programs have been implemented among 
women with SUDs, including The Women’s Recovery Group (Greenfield, 2016) and 
Seeking Safety (Najavits, 2002). The efficacy of these programs has been associated with 
various treatment-related mechanisms. For example, the efficacy of The Women’s Recovery 
Group in reducing substance use has been associated with the support and affiliation felt 
among women in the group (Valeri et al., 2018), while the efficacy of Seeking Safety may 
be due to the reduction of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (Morgan‐Lopez et al., 
2014). Group treatments designed specifically for pregnant and parenting women with SUDs 
have not been reported; more specifically, treatments using art project components in this 
population are lacking. Using art as part of an intervention for adults with SUDs aims to 
promote positive outcomes such as identifying triggers and eliciting hope (Torgerson, 2018).

The purpose of this study is to provide a preliminary assessment of the Art of Addiction 
Recovery Program, a manualized group treatment that was developed for pregnant and 
parenting women enrolled in SUD treatment. The Art of Addiction Recovery Program was 
imbedded within a comprehensive substance use disorder treatment program (Jones et al., 
2015) for pregnant and parenting women and implemented in a group treatment setting in 
which women were actively participating. The Art of Addiction Recovery Program manual 
consists of 14 sessions, each of which focuses on a different topic related to substance 
use and recovery, including health, social relationships, the process of recovery, well-being, 
and introspection. Each session includes both the presentation of information by a program 
facilitator, group discussions guided by the facilitator, and a creative project. Details on the 
respective sessions can be found in Figure 1.

The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the Art of Addiction Recovery 
Program in increasing participants’ knowledge in each of the 14 topic areas.

2.  Methods

2.1 

IRB approval

This study was approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board.

2.2  Treatment Setting

UNC Horizons, located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA, offers group treatment to 
women with substance use disorders including substance use education, return to substance 
use prevention, parenting, healthy relationships, health and safety, family planning, trauma 
recovery, employment services, life skills and budgeting. UNC Horizons also offers women 
with substance use disorders and their children comprehensive treatment that includes 
individual evaluations, individual therapy, case management services, outreach, home visits, 
maternal and child psychotherapy, psychiatry services, individual parenting and attachment-
based treatment. All services are offered to patients in outpatient or residential treatment 
modalities.

2.3  Development: Art of Addiction Recovery Program

The development of the Art of Addiction Recovery Program manual started with 24 
overlapping topics, for which session outlines were written that explained the topic and 
the goal of the respective session. Based on input from 32 women who had completed at 
least 6 months of treatment at UNC Horizons, these 24 topics were refined, eliminated, and 
combined into 14 distinct topics. These 32 women then reviewed an outline of the 14 group 
topics, as well as initial and final drafts of the session materials. The final set of the 14 
session topics were then revised as necessary and used as the basis for the Art of Addiction 
Recovery Program (see Figure 1) and the recommended number of group participants per 
session is 6–12. None of these 32 women were participants in the subsequent assessment of 
the Art of Addiction Recovery Program.

2.4  Participants

Women with Medicaid or no insurance who enrolled in the UNC Horizons program in 
Chapel Hill, NC, between April 2018 and July 2019 were provided with the opportunity to 
complete pre- and post-session questionnaires to examine changes in knowledge. Women 
attended their first group within three days of treatment entry and approximately 50% were 
pregnant at treatment entry. All women who were offered the opportunity accepted.

2.5  Procedures

Art of Addiction Recovery Program sessions took place once a week for 90 minutes in 
a group room setting, with each participant sitting in a comfortable chair, with the chairs 
loosely arranged in a large circle. Soft floor lighting, pillows and lap blankets provided 
a relaxing and comfortable environment. Art materials were available at tables in the 
center of the room. At the start of each Program session, before receiving any materials,

participants completed a 3-item pre-session assessment that used a 5-point Likert-type scale 
(0=”Strongly Disagree”, 1=”Disagree”, 2=”Undecided”, 3=”Agree”, 4=”Strongly Agree”) 
measuring the extent of endorsement of a factual statement directly related to the topic area 
of the session (eg, for Communication: “Good communication includes listening and body 
language as well as speaking.”; for Vulnerability: “Allowing myself to be vulnerable is a 
sign of strength.”). Following completion of the 90-minute session, participants completed 
a post-session assessment with the same 3 items plus 2 additional questions using the same 
5-point scale asking the extent to which participants “learned something important in today’s 
session” (Learning) and the extent to which this “session was effective in supporting my 
recovery” (Effectiveness). Thus, there were 14 separate knowledge assessment measures, 
one for each session (administered pre and post-session), and Learning and Effectiveness 
ratings for all 14 sessions, post-session only. To blind the group session facilitator to pre and 
post-test responses, participants slid their completed assessments into envelopes that were 
then sealed and later opened by the data entry person.

2.6  Statistical Analysis

Separate pre- and post-session scores were calculated for each of the 14 topic area measures 
by summing the ratings for each of the 3 statements within each topic area. Summary scores 
could vary between 0–12, inclusive.

A linear mixed model was fit to the data, separately for each summary score, assuming 
the summary scores followed a normal distribution. There was a single fixed repeated 
factor, Time (pre vs. post-session), assuming an unstructured error covariance matrix for 
the respective summary score. Denominator df were estimated by the improved Kenward-
Rodger method. A measure of multivariate association, Rβ2, [analogous to R2 in the general 
linear model (Edwards et al., 2008)] between the Time main effect and the criterion (eg, the 
summary score) in the statistical model was estimated to assess the magnitude of the change 
in each summary score.

The learning and effectiveness questions were post-session only scores with means and 
standard deviations reported to document the rated learning and effectiveness of each of the 
topic areas. In addition, means were tested using a single-sample t test with a hypothesized 
mean value in the population of 4, to test for a possible ceiling effect (that is, no other 
learning or efficacy was possible from the perspective of the participants).

All analyses were conducted with SAS 9.4.

3.  Results

3.1  Participant Characteristics

The sample consisted of 51 women with an average age of 28.7 (SD=5.0). Regarding racial 
identity, 65% identified as White, 24% as Black, and 12% as other race/identity. A total 
of 16% reported being married, and 84.3% reported they were unemployed at treatment 
entry. In terms of psychoactive substance use, 69% reported an opioid use disorder, 22% 
stimulant use disorder, and 10% alcohol use disorder was their primary disorder, with 82% 
also reporting current tobacco use.

3.1  Pre-Post Changes in Knowledge

Significant (ps<.001) pre- to post-session increases in session-specific knowledge were 
observed for all 14 sessions (Table 1). The measure of multivariate association indicated 
that these changes for all sessions were substantial. As illustration of the magnitude of the 
change, Communication, the session with the smallest Rβ2, had a mean difference (2.8) more 
than 9 times its standard error (.31).

3.2  Learning and Effectiveness

Learning and Effectiveness were generally quite high (Table 1), with 19/28 means at 3.7 
or above (maximum score of 4). Variability of ratings was generally uniform, with only 
9/28 standard deviations larger than ½ the Likert rating unit. However, t tests did indicate 
that all Learning and Effectiveness ratings were significantly lower than 4. Taken together, 
these findings indicate that participants as a group generally strongly agreed that the session 
provided high levels of learning and were considered highly effective, yet there was still 
some small room for their ratings to improve.

4.  Discussion

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Art of Addiction Recovery 
Program, a manual-based group art treatment program designed for pregnant and parenting 
women in treatment for substance use disorders. The program was evaluated for its ability 
to increase women’s knowledge in the domains of their physical and mental health, social 
relationships. and self-perception, and introspection about their recovery journey.

Across all 14 sessions of the Art of Addiction Recovery Program, knowledge significantly 
increased from the pre-session assessment to the post-session assessment. This knowledge 
pertains to the aforementioned domains, and was relevant to each respective session. This 
finding is meaningful, as previous research has demonstrated that low levels of knowledge 
about health, self-perception, and relationships tend to be a risk for adverse outcomes related 
to substance use. For example, low health literacy has been associated with decreased 
quality of life and mental health for those in treatment for substance use disorders (Degan et 
al., 2019), while low emotional literacy has been associated with substance-related problems 
(Riley and Schutte, 2003) and more intensive substance use (Kun and Demetrovics, 2010).

Additionally, learning and effectiveness ratings suggest that participants felt that the contents 
of the sessions had considerable merit. Participants reported that they strongly agreed that 
they learned important information from all 14 sessions, and found each of them highly 
effective in supporting recovery. The average ratings were close to the maximum value of 
the response scale, which suggests that the program has limited ability for improvement.

This study is the first to assess The Art of Addiction Recovery Program and demonstrate 
its potential in increasing knowledge among pregnant and parenting women in recovery 
from substance use disorders, and has many strengths. For instance, the sample consisted 
entirely of a clinical cohort currently in treatment for diagnosed substance use disorders 
and needing to receive the most intense level of outpatient treatment available. However, 
limitations of this study include a small sample size and data collection taking place

only among participants at a single treatment program, which limits the generalizability of 
these findings. Additionally, post-session assessments of knowledge took place immediately 
following each session. Future studies should evaluate the long-term effects of The Art of 
Addiction Recovery Program in increasing knowledge of the participants. An additional 
limitation of this study is that it did not assess the degree to which an increase of knowledge 
may be related to changes in behavior, or treatment-related outcomes. Future studies should 
evaluate the extent to which changes in knowledge might be related to changes in behavior.

This study exhibited the effectiveness of The Art of Addiction Recovery Program 
in increasing knowledge about physical health, mental health, social relationships, self-
perception and the recovery journey among pregnant and parenting women in recovery from 
substance use disorders. The Art of Addiction Recovery Program is an option for those 
seeking a manual-based group therapy program as an aid in the treatment process of this 
subpopulation.

Notes. p < .001 for all tests of the Time Effect. SE = Standard Error. (df, df) are the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom for the test 

2 is a measure of multivariate association between the fixed Time main effect and the respective criterion in the 
of Time (pre- vs. post-session). Rβ
statistical model (see text for further details). SD = Standard Deviation. Theoretical range of Summary Scores is 0–12, inclusive. Theoretical range 
for Learning and Effectiveness ratings is 0–4, inclusive.
