ABSTRACT
Objective  To assess family caregiver burden and 
associated factors among caregivers of people with mental 
illness in Eastern Ethiopia.
Design  Cross- sectional study.
Setting  Three hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia.
Participants  A total of 422 family caregivers of people 
with mental illness were recruited using systematic 
random sampling, of whom 417 participated (response 
rate 98.8%).
Primary outcome measures  Caregiver burden was 
assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI- 22). Linear 
regression was used to measure the associations between 
dependent and independent variables.
Results  The mean score of the ZBI was 47.971 
(SD=14.539). In our study, factors associated with 
caregiver burden included age of caregivers (β=0.143, 
p=0.006), sex of the caregiver (β=0.121, p=0.007), time 
spent in providing care (β=0.194, p=0.006), presence of 
comorbid medical illness (β=0.309, p<0.001), substance 
use in the last 12 months (β=0.265, p=0.024), perceived 
stigma (β=0.207, p<0.001), monthly income (β=−0.214, 
p=0.038), level of social support (β=−0.651, p=0.003) 
and family members in need of care (β=0.290, p<0.001).
Conclusions  89 (22.2%) of caregivers reported severe 
burden and 220 (52.8%) reported moderate- to- severe 
burden. Family caregivers play a critical role in the 
treatment of mental illness; there is a need to establish 
family caregiver support services, such as group therapy 
and psychoeducation.

BACKGROUND
Caregiver  burden  is  an  unwanted  or  nega-
tive  consequence  that  caregivers  experience 
as  a  result  of  caring  for  people  with  mental 
illness  (PWMI).  Family  caregiver  burden  is 
a  multidimensional  concept  that  includes 
social,  emotional  and  financial  concerns,  as 
well as relationships with care recipients and 
a  lack  of  time.1  Disruption  of  a  caregiver’s 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ This is the first study conducted in the eastern part 
of  Ethiopia,  with  data  collected  from  three  public 
hospitals.

 ⇒ The study addresses an important evidence gap in 
Eastern Ethiopia, a region with a high prevalence of 
mental  illness  and  substance  use,  where  research 
on caregiver burden is not conducted.

 ⇒ Due  to  the  cross- sectional  nature  of  our  study, 
it  is  not  possible  to  establish  a  cause- and- effect 
relationship.

 ⇒ Although  we  measure  caregiver  burden  using  the 
internationally validated Zarit Burden Interview, the 
tool has not yet been validated in Ethiopia, despite 
its previous use in local studies with various study 
populations.

 ⇒ Recall  and  response  bias  may  have  occurred  be-

cause the data were self- reported.

everyday routines, social isolation and finan-
cial  and  work  issues  are  factors  related  to 
objective burdens. Subjective burdens, on the 
other  hand,  include  emotions  such  as  fear, 
despair, anger, shame, loss, stigma and rejec-
tion,  which  put  emotional  stress  on  family 
caregivers.2

Caregivers  of 

family  members  with 
chronic  illnesses  or  disabilities  face  chal-
lenges  that  affect  their  everyday  activities, 
lifestyle and health. Caregiving harms care-
givers’  physical,  emotional  and  economic 
well- being.3  Caregivers  reported  varying 
degrees  of  burden,  including  financial, 
social  exclusion,  emotional,  depression 
and  insufficient  time  for  other  social  obli-
gations.4 The most challenging issues expe-
rienced by caregivers include not satisfying 
their needs, burnout and a high burden of

care,  as  well  as  high  social  stigma,  inadequate  social 
support  and  a  low  quality  of  life.5  Family  caregivers  of 
people with mental illness experience different types of 
burdens that can interrupt their psychosocial integrity, 
including physical, psychological, social and economic 
burdens.6 7

A  physical  disability  of  patients  caused  by  psychiatric 
medication reduces patients’ ability to perform self- care 
and daily activities independently. This, in turn, increases 
the  caregiving  demands,  creating  a  physical  burden  on 
family caregivers. Physical burden results from providing 
additional  support  with  mobility,  hygiene,  feeding  and 
other  daily  activities.8  However,  not  all  antipsychotics 
have  these  adverse  effects;  extrapyramidal  and  psycho-
motor retardation are examples of side effects that vary 
depending  on  the  drug,  dosage  and  patient  character-
istics.9  Mental  illness  causes  a  significant  economic  and 
social burden on individuals with mental illness, families 
and  communities  at  large.10  Furthermore,  most  care-
givers have few or no resources to meet the unanticipated 
demands of their role,11 and the need may be so great that 
caregivers acquire mental health conditions themselves.12 
The  individual’s  incapacity  to  perform  everyday  chores, 
probable  changes  in  economic  and  social  status,  uncer-
tainty about whether there is a solution and the chance 
that  the  condition  will  become  chronic  are  all  stressors 
that disrupt family unity.13

One  out  of  every  four  households  has  at  least  one 
person suffering from a mental illness,14 and over 90% of 
these PWMI live with and are supported by their families. 
It takes much time, energy, money and other resources to 
care for people with PWMI, and these people suffer two 
times as much as the general population does.15

Family  caregivers  are  responsible  for  the  physical, 
emotional,  medical  and,  in  most  cases,  financial  well- 
being of their sick relative. Without sufficient preparation, 
education or assistance from health experts, family care-
givers of people with mental health problems frequently 
suffer  disruptions  in  daily  life.16  As  a  result,  caregivers 
who  provide  care  for  family  members  with  psychiatric 
illnesses may experience increased stress and a decline in 
their health.17

As  a  result  of  the  impairments  produced  by  mental 
illness,  sufferers  are  unable  to  carry  out  important  life 
activities  on  their  own,18  19  and  family  caregivers  are 
frequently  called  on  to  fill  in  for  them.20  Mental  illness 
difficulties  and  obstacles  have  been  shown  in  studies  to 
have negative long- term effects on caregiver health.21

In developing countries, most people with mental illness 
do not receive modern treatment. The majority of those 
receiving  mental  healthcare  are  treated  as  outpatients 
due  to  different  factors.  A  report  on  Ethiopia’s  mental 
health strategy for 2020–2025 estimates that only 25% of 
hospitals  in  the  country  offer  outpatient  mental  health 
services. There are only 843 psychiatric beds in Ethiopia, 
the majority of which are situated in facilities found in the 
capital cities of the country, such as Yeka Kotebe Hospital 
and Amanuel Specialized Mental Hospital.22

Although  few  studies  have  been  conducted  in  the 
southern  part  of  Ethiopia,  to  the  best  of  our  knowl-
edge,  no  study  has  been  carried  out  in  the  eastern  part 
of  the  country,  despite  reports  of  a  high  prevalence  of 
substance use and mental illness there.23 24 One study in 
the  southern  part  was  conducted  10  years  ago;  its  find-
ings  may  not  reflect  the  current  realities  of  caregivers’ 
burden,  given  recent  changes  in  mental  health  service 
delivery.22 This study aims to address this knowledge gap 
by  providing  an  updated  understanding  of  the  burden 
experienced  by  family  caregivers  of  people  with  mental 
illness in Eastern Ethiopia.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study setting and design
A cross- sectional study was conducted between November 
2022 and February 2023 at Dil Chora Referral Hospital, 
Hiwot  Fana  Comprehensive  Specialized  Teaching 
Hospital  and  Chiro  Referral  Hospital,  which  is  located 
in  the  eastern  part  of  Ethiopia.  These  facilities  offered 
mental  health  services  alongside  other  healthcare 
services  to  local  communities.  The  Dil  Chora  Referral 
Hospital,  which  is  located  in  the  Dire  Dawa  city  admin-
istration,  served  approximately  742  psychiatric  patients 
monthly.  The  Hiwot  Fana  Comprehensive  Specialized 
Teaching  Hospital,  the  sole  referral  hospital  in  Harari 
regional  state,  provided  mental  healthcare  to  approxi-
mately  795  psychiatric  patients  monthly.  Chiro  Referral 
Hospital,  located  326  km  east  of  Addis  Ababa  in  Chiro 
town,  offered  outpatient  mental  health  services  to  an 
average of 671 patients monthly.

Sample size determination
The  sample  size  was  determined  via  a  single  popula-
tion  proportion  formula,  which  was  calculated  with  the 
assumption  of  a  48.8%  prevalence  of  caregiver  burden 
from  a  study  conducted  in  Jimma  town,25  with  Z=1.96, 
level of significance 95% and α=0.05; the sample size was 
384.  By  considering  a  10%  non- response  rate,  the  final 
calculated sample size was 422.

Sampling techniques
A  systematic  random  sampling  technique  was  used  to 
select the study participants. The calculated sample size 
was  proportionally  distributed  for  each  of  the  selected 
hospitals.  The  participants  were  chosen  using  a  calcu-
lated  sampling  interval  (K),  obtained  by  dividing  the 
total  number  of  individuals  with  mental  illness  who 
had  follow- up  visits  (N)  by  the  final  sample  size  (n), 
for  each  hospital.  Over  an  average  2- month  period, 
Dil  Chora  Referral  Hospital  had  1484  patients  with 
regular  follow- ups;  Hiwot  Fana  Comprehensive  Special-
ized  Teaching  Hospital  had  1590;  and  Chiro  Referral 
Hospital  had  1342.  This  resulted  in  an  approximate 
sampling interval of 3 for each selected study area. The 
first study participant was selected by lottery method, and 

Leta FO, et al. BMJ Open 2025;15:e098359. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2024-098359subsequent study participants were selected at every third 
interval until the target sample size was reached.

Data collection
Data  were  collected  by  psychiatry  professionals  through 
face- to- face interviews after they had undergone practical 
training on data collection procedures and instruments.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Family caregivers, included parents, spouses, children or 
siblings aged ≥18 years, who had been directly involved in 
day- to- day care for ≥2 months, were eligible to participate 
if they gave informed consent.

Caregivers  were  excluded  if  they  were  not  usual  or 
primary  caregivers,  if  they  accompanied  patients  in  the 
acute  phase  of  illness  or  admitted  for  emergency  treat-
ment at the time of data collection, if they were profes-
sional or paid caregivers or if they themselves had severe 
physical or mental health problems limiting their ability 
to provide reliable information.

Measurement
Patient  and  caregiver- related  socio- demographic  ques-
tions,  such  as  those  concerning  age,  sex,  educational 
status, employment, monthly income, marital status and 
occupation, were used. Caregiver- related questions, such 
as availability of social support, relationship of care with 
recipients and other persons involved in caregiving, time 
spent during caregiving and duration of caregiving, were 
used to collect data from caregivers.

Zarit Burden Interview
The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), a 22- item, was used to 
assess family caregiver burden. The items are rated on a 
5- point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly 
always), with the sum of the scores ranging from 0 to 88. 
Higher scores indicate greater burden. The scale is inter-
preted as (0–20) minimal burden, (21–40) mild burden, 
(41–60) moderate burden and (61–88) severe burden.26 
The tool was used for different caregivers, such as family 
caregivers  of  people  with  dementia,  family  caregivers  of 
people with cancer, family caregivers of patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus and caregivers of people with mental 
illness.

Oslo-3 level of Social Support Scale
The  Oslo- 3  level  of  social  support  scale  was  used  to 
assess the level of social support. A score of 3–8 indicates 
poor social support, a score of 9–11 indicates moderate 
social support and a score of 12–14 indicates good social 
support.27

Family interview schedule
The  family  interview  schedule  (FIS)  included  14  ques-
tions  used  to  assess  the  family’s  experience  of  stigma  in 
the community. Each FIS question was rated on a 4- point 
scale,  where  the  participants  experienced  stigma  in  the 
community. The response categories are 0 for not at all, 
1  for  some  times,  2  for  often  and  3  for  a  lot.  To  assess

the  distribution  of  responses  between  groups,  a  total 
score was computed by summing the item scores, with a 
minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 42.28

The Clinical Global Impression Severity scale
The Clinical Global Impression Severity scale is a 7- point 
scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the 
patient’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the 
clinician’s  experience  with  patients  who  have  the  same 
diagnosis.29

Data processing and analysis
The  data  were  coded  and  input  into  a  computer  via 
EpiData V.4.6 after being confirmed to be complete and 
consistent.  The  data  were  subsequently  exported  into 
V.23 of the Statistical Package for Social Science for anal-
ysis. To define the study population with respect to perti-
nent  variables,  frequencies,  percentages  and  summary 
statistics were computed. The relationships between the 
dependent  and  independent  variables  were  examined 
using simple and multivariable linear regression.

All independent variables with a p value of <0.25 were 
chosen  as  candidate  variables  for  multivariable  linear 
regression  analysis  after  bivariate  analysis  via  simple 
linear  regression.  Finally,  variables  p<0.05  were  consid-
ered  statistically  significant.  Multivariable  linear  regres-
sion  with  the  stepwise  selection  approach  was  used  to 
identify caregiver burden predictors. Before performing 
regression analysis, assumptions related to linear regres-
sion were verified. These assumptions included linearity 
(assessed  by  P- P  plot),  normality  (assessed  by  histogram 
and Q- Q plot), multicollinearity (tested by variable infla-
tion  factor),  autocorrelation  (tested  by  Durbin- Watson 
test) and heteroscedasticity (tested by scatter plot).

Patient and public involvement
Patients  or  the  public  were  not  involved  in  the  design, 
conducting, reporting or dissemination plan of the study.

Results
A  total  of  417  caregivers  participated  in  the  study,  with 
a response rate of 98.82%. The mean and SD of the age 
of  the  participants  was  40.59±13.923.  Of  the  total,  215 
(51.6%) were male, and 286 (68.6%) were married. More 
than half of the participants lived in urban areas and 232 
(55.6%) spent up to 8 hours per day providing care (see 
table 1).

As indicated by table 2, more than half of the patients 
were male 238 (57.1%), and 139 (33.3%) of the patients 
had at least a second episode. Of the total, 100 (24%) had 
an illness duration of 2–5 years and about 94 (20.54%) of 
the patients had comorbid medical illness.

Caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview)
The  mean  score  of  the  ZBI  was  47.971  (SD=14.539). 
The  minimum  score  of  ZBI  was  1,  and  the  maximum 
score  was  82.  Among  the  total  respondents,  220 
(52.8%)  had  moderate- to- severe  burdens,  96  (23%)

Factors associated with the burden of caregiving among 
caregivers of people with mental illness
To  run  multivariable  linear  regression  analysis,  all 
variables  with  p  values<0.25  in  a  simple  linear  regres-
sion  model  were  included  (see  online  supplemental 
table  1).  Variables  such  as  age  (β=0.143,  p=0.006), 
sex  (β=0.121,  p=0.007),  time  spent  in  providing  care 
(β=0.194,  p=0.006),  the  presence  of  comorbid  medical 
illness  (β=0.309,  p<0.001),  the  patient  substance  use 
(past  12  months)  (β=0.265,  p=0.024),  having  other 
family members in need of care (β=0.339, p<0.001) and 
perceived stigma (β=0.207, p<0.001) were positively asso-
ciated  with  caregiving  burden.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
variables  that  were  negatively  associated  with  caregiver 
burden  included  monthly  income  (β=–0.214,  p=0.038), 
caregivers  receiving  help  with  care  (β=–0.154,  p=0.028) 
and their level of social support (β=–0.651, p=0.003) (see 
table 3).

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to assess the burden of family 
caregivers and associated factors among family caregivers 
of people with mental illness attending outpatient treat-
ment at public hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia. According 
to  the  results  of  this  study,  the  mean  score  of  caregiver 
burden on the ZBI scale was 47.971, which falls within the 
range of moderate- to- severe burden. Among total partic-
ipants, 220 (52.8%) had moderate- to- severe burdens, 96 
(23%)  had  mild- to- moderate  burdens,  89  (22.3%)  had 
severe  burdens  and  12  (2.9%)  had  little  or  no  burden. 
These  findings  indicate  that  the  majority  of  caregivers 
experienced moderate- to- severe burdens, consistent with 
the mean ZBI score.

This  finding  is  consistent  with  a  study  conducted 
in  Nigeria  that  indicated  that  more  than  half  of  care-
givers  had  a  moderate- to- severe  burden  (51.3%),30  in 
Iran,  among  family  caregivers  of  patients  with  schizo-
phrenia,  the  majority  of  caregivers  had  a  moderate- to- 
severe  burden  (51.3%),31  and  in  Taiwan,  among  family 
caregivers  of  patients  with  schizophrenia,  47.1%  had  a 
moderate- to- severe burden.32

The mean score of the current study was higher than 
that  of  previous  studies  conducted  in  Brazil,  which 
reported  a  mean  score  of  27.66,  indicating  mild- to- 
moderate burden;33 a study conducted in Nepal reported 
a  mean  score  of  27  among  caregivers  of  patients  with 
severe  mental  illness,34  and  a  study  conducted  at  the 
University  of  Cape  Town  in  Malawi  reported  a  mean 
score of 31.5.35 The reason for this disparity could be the 
outcomes  of  the  services  that  health  caregivers  receive 
while  providing  care,  such  as  psychoeducation,  which 
increases their capacity to fulfil the job of caregivers and 
gives them adequate knowledge about it.36 37

The  result  of  our  study  revealed  that  the  age  of  the 
caregiver  was  one  of  the  factors  positively  correlated 
associated  with  caregiver  burden.  This  finding  aligns 
with  studies  from  Jimma  University  Medical  Center25 
and  the  University  of  Cape  Town  in  Malawi,35  as  well  as 
studies from Brazil,33 which have revealed an association 
between  increased  caregiver  burden  and  age.  This  may 
be due to the physical demands of providing care as well 
as  the  gradual  loss  of  physical  strength  and  endurance 
during  the  ageing  process.38  In  contrast,  the  younger 
caregivers typically have greater educational attainment, 
which could lead to a better socioeconomic situation or 
comprehension of the condition. It is also more common 
for them than their older counterparts to spend less time 
with mentally ill family members.39

The monthly income of caregivers was another aspect we 
examined, and the results of this study indicated that the 
burden of providing care decreased as the family caregiv-
er’s income increased. This result is supported by studies 
among family caregivers of patients with mental illness in 
Jimma,25 family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia 
in Eritrea,40 and family caregivers of patients with psychi-
atric disorders in Nepal,34 all of which revealed that family 
caregivers  with  lower  monthly  incomes  had  a  greater 
burden of care than those with higher monthly incomes 
did.  This  may  be  because  the  majority  of  caregivers 
leave their jobs to provide full- time care for their family 
members who suffer from mental illness. This may also be 
because the daily expenses needed to provide care, such 
as purchasing medication or transporting a relative to the 
hospital,  have  increased.  Additionally,  family  caregivers 
are frequently forced by circumstances and demands to 
provide full- time care for mentally ill relatives.41

According to our study, female caregivers have greater 
caregiver burdens than their male counterparts do. This 
result aligns with a study conducted at the Sodo area of 
the Gurage Zone in Ethiopia,42 Lagos, Nigeria,18 a study 
conducted in Canada among family caregivers of patients

diagnosed  with  schizophrenia,43  and  a  study  conducted 
among  family  caregivers  of  patients  diagnosed  with 
mental  illness  in  Brazil,33  which  revealed  that  being  a 
female  caregiver  was  associated  with  a  greater  burden. 
This  might  be  because  female  caregivers  bear  a  greater 
burden  and  endure  more  stress  because  they  are  more 
emotionally invested in their patients, are more prepared 
to sacrifice their social life and are less inclined to turn 
to outside resources and help. Another reason could be 
the different coping strategies used by men and women. 
Women tend to use emotional coping strategies that make 
them  feel  more  burdened  and  distressed.  In  contrast, 
men use coping strategies that focus on managing chal-
lenging circumstances, avoiding distractions and disrup-
tions and thus repressing their emotional reactions.44 45

The results of this study also revealed a strong correla-
tion  between  perceived  stigma  and  caregiver  burden, 
with high caregiver burden being experienced by family 
caregivers of individuals who scored highly on the family 
interview  schedule  for  stigma.  Similar  results  to  those 
of  the  current  study  are  also  shown  by  earlier  research 
conducted  in  different  study  areas  and  over  different 
years.  Perceived  stigma  positively  correlated  with  care-
giver  burden,  according  to  studies  conducted  at  Jimma 
University  Medical  Center,25  Amanuel  Mental  Specialty 
Hospital46  and  Ghana.47  A  possible  explanation  for  this 
could  be  that  caregivers  who  are  highly  burdened  and 
under  stress  may  also  feel  depressed,  worthless  and 
ashamed because of their mentally ill relative.

Patient  substance  use  was  another  component  in  the 
current study that was associated with caregiver burden. 
This research revealed a positive correlation between the 
burden  of  family  caregivers  and  substance  use  over  the 
last 12 months by patients. Families that care for patients 
who  use  substances  have  greater  caregiver  burdens 
than  do  families  that  care  for  patients  who  do  not  use 
substances. Research performed at the Jimma University

Medical Center25 and Australia48 is consistent with these 
findings.

The family caregivers who provide care for those who 
have  comorbid  medical  conditions  might  put  a  greater 
burden on themselves. In our study, the family caregivers 
who  provided  care  for  people  with  mental  illness  with 
comorbid  medical  conditions  were  among  the  factors 
associated  with  the  caregiver  burden  of  the  family  care-
givers. This study result is supported by a study conducted 
in Tehran, Iran, which revealed that patients with comor-
bidities had a noticeably greater caregiver burden.49

The  social  support  provided  for  family  caregivers  was 
found  to  be  another  factor  in  our  study  that  was  asso-
ciated  with  caregiver  burden.  According  to  this  study, 
the  level  of  social  support  that  family  caregivers  receive 
negatively correlated with their level of caregiver burden; 
the burden of providing care decreases as social support 
increases. This finding is consistent with those of studies 
carried out in Jimma,25 Eritrea,40 Taiwan32 and the USA.50 
This  result  showed  that  family  caregivers  who  received 
help in caregiving decreased the burden of giving care.

According  to  our  study,  family  caregivers  of  individ-
uals with mental illness who spend more time with their 
patients  have  a  greater  caregiver  burden.  The  result  of 
this  investigation  is  supported  by  research  conducted 
at  Southern  Ethiopia,25  Amanuel  Specialised  Mental 
Hospital46  and  in  Brazil33  and  the  USA.50  According  to 
studies conducted in Southern Ethiopia and Brazil, family 
members who live with patients or spend much of their 
time with them have a greater caregiver burden. Similarly, 
a  study  carried  out  in  the  USA  reported  that  caregivers 
who gave their patients full- time or nearly full- time care 
had a greater caregiving burden.

Having another family member who also requires care 
while providing care for people with mental illness is asso-
ciated  with  caregiver  burden.  The  findings  of  this  study 
were supported by research conducted in Brazil,33 which 

Leta FO, et al. BMJ Open 2025;15:e098359. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2024-098359revealed  an  association  between  caregiver  burden  and 
having  a  family  member  in  need  of  care  due  to  health 
problems.  This  is  thought  to  be  related  to  the  rise  in 
family member care responsibilities, which could exacer-
bate the harmful impacts of giving care.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusion
Nearly one quarter of the family caregivers experienced 
severe  care  burdens,  and  approximately  half  reported 
moderate- to- severe caregiving burdens. Various factors of 
people with mental illness and those who care for them 
were found to be associated with the burden of providing 
care  for  the  family  of  caregivers  in  our  study.  The 
following caregiver characteristics were strongly linked to 
the burden of providing care for families: age, sex, social 
support level, monthly income and perceived stigma. The 
existence  of  co- occurring  medical  conditions,  substance 
abuse  during  the  past  year  and  the  severity  of  mental 
illness  were  patient- related  characteristics  that  were 
significantly linked to the difficulty of providing care.

Recommendations
Family caregivers play a critical role in the treatment of 
mental illness, so it is best to prepare for family caregiver 
services  such  as  group  therapy  and  psychoeducation. 
Additionally,  to  decrease  the  burden  of  caregiving  and 
the consequences that follow the burden, mental health 
professionals working in this field need to have training 
and awareness on how to assess and manage the burden 
on family caregivers. Because family caregivers of people 
with mental illness have a high level of caregiver burden, 
it is preferable to involve a multidisciplinary team, such 
as social workers who can serve family caregivers as advo-
cates, supporters, educators and bridges as well as psychol-
ogists  and  mental  health  professionals,  in  providing 
mental health services to address family caregiver burden 
while providing care for people with mental illness.
