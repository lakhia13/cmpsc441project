Abstract
Background and Objective  Psychosis represents one of the most challenging clinical presentations in psychiatry. Schizo-
phrenia and bipolar disorder may both present psychotic features, and cariprazine may offer improvement in the treatment 
and care of these conditions. Therefore, the objective of the current work was to synthesise results of efficacy for cariprazine 
in these disorders.
Methods  In total, five electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials enrolling patients across the 
psychosis spectrum, using the search term ‘Cariprazine’ (PubMed, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, EUDRACT, Cochrane—last 
search January 2024). No filter or limits were employed. Effect sizes were extracted, by the mean difference in psychometric 
variables before and after the intervention (Clinical Global Impression Scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, Mont-
gomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale).
Results  In total, 12 studies enrolling either patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were included (total n = 6477; 
n = 4814 patients treated with cariprazine, n = 1663 controls treated with placebo). Cariprazine was effective in reducing 
global clinical severity, and higher improvements were observed at increasing dosages (− 0.25 at ≤ 1.5 mg/day, − 0.45 
at ≥ 3 mg/day). Cariprazine also effectively reduced psychotic total scores: − 6.74, [95% confidence interval (CI) − 8.31;  
− 5.17], depression: − 1.78, [95% CI − 2.54; − 1.02], mania: − 5.72, [95% CI – 6.95; – 4.49], and anxiety symptoms: – 1.24, 
[95% CI – 1.92; – 0.56].
Conclusions  Cariprazine was observed as efficacious across retrieved studies, offering a potential for tailored treatments 
across the psychosis spectrum.

Key Points 

Cariprazine effectively reduces global clinical severity in 
patients along the psychosis spectrum.

Higher doses of cariprazine were associated with better 
treatment responses for global clinical severity.

Cariprazine also reduced depressive, manic and anxiety 
symptoms.

1  Introduction

Cariprazine  is  an  atypical  antipsychotic,  originally 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
[1] and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) [2] for the 
acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. In the 
USA, the FDA approved the use of cariprazine for acute 
episodes in bipolar disorder (either mania, or with mixed 
features) [1], as well as for the treatment of depressive epi-
sodes in bipolar disorder (type I) and as adjunctive therapy 
in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder [3].

To the current day, a limited number of meta-analyses 
have assessed the use of cariprazine in the treatment of 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In particular, two meta-
analyses by Corponi and colleagues in 2017 [4] and by 
Zhao and colleagues in 2018 [5] underscored the efficacy 
and tolerability of cariprazine in the treatment of acute 
schizophrenia. The efficacy and tolerability of cariprazine 
in acute schizophrenia was evidenced by the significant 
reduction in positive and negative symptoms after caripra-
zine intake, accompanied by a reduction in global clinical 
severity. Nonetheless, no evidence has been synthesised 
on the effect of cariprazine on anxiety symptoms, which 
is a common clinical concern in both schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder [6, 7].

On  this  remark,  a  third  meta-analysis  showed  that 
cariprazine may be effective in managing acute and mixed 
episodes in bipolar disorder [8]. Cariprazine was assessed 
as significantly associated with reductions in the burden 
of affective symptoms in bipolar disorder, namely manic 
and depressive symptoms [8]. A further additional meta-
analysis, conducted in 2020 [9], extended its scope beyond 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This fourth meta-anal-
ysis by Cooper and colleagues reported that cariprazine 
may be well-tolerated irrespective of psychiatric diagnoses 
(schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive dis-
order), although associated with a higher risk of extrapy-
ramidal side effects in comparison to placebo [9].

However, grouping together schizophrenia, bipolar disor-
der and major depressive disorder may not fully inform clin-
ical practice. In fact, although major depression and bipo-
lar disorder may share affective components, the inclusion 
of patients with major depression may bias meta-analytic 
results when assessing evidence in favour of a reduction 
in depressive symptoms after its intake. A more accurate 
investigation of antidepressive effects of cariprazine when 
used as an antipsychotic agent is therefore timely.

For this scope, the current work adopts a transdiagnostic 
approach and moves beyond single diagnostic categories 
when assessing the potential efficacy of cariprazine across 
the spectrum of psychosis, while trying to maintain cau-
tion in delineating psychopathological boundaries between 
these different conditions [10]. Indeed, schizophrenia and 

L. Tarchi et al.

bipolar disorder may be appraised as representing differ-
ent disorders across a spectrum of continuity, rather than 
being distinct clinical entities, as evidenced by accumu-
lating evidence on shared biological components and pro-
spective clinical transitions during the life-time between 
these diagnostic categories [11–14]. Schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorders do not only share positive symptoms 
of psychosis (i.e. delirium and hallucinations), but also 
a  reduction  or  absence  of  normal  emotional  or  behav-
ioural  functions—i.e.  negative  symptoms  of  psychosis 
[15]. While historically associated primarily with schizo-
phrenia, negative symptoms have been described as also 
shared across the psychosis spectrum [15], suggesting that 
a dimensional approach to psychosis may aid in addressing 
its impact on functional outcomes in affected individuals 
across a spectrum of continuum.

To enrich previous research, the present study thus pro-
posed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of 
existing literature, adopting a transdiagnostic perspective.

2   Methods

The methodology of this systematic review is in accordance 
with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines [16]. Included articles 
were all randomised controlled trials (RCT). Inclusion cri-
teria were as follows: (1) enrolled patients with either a diag-
nosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar 
disorder—irrespective of acute psychotic feature, accord-
ing to DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, DSM-5, DSM-5-TR, ICD-9, 
ICD-10 or ICD-11; (2) evaluating at least one psychomet-
ric domain between depression, mania, anxiety, psychotic 
symptoms (either positive, negative, or general) and general 
clinical severity; (3) comparing cariprazine with either a dif-
ferent dosage of cariprazine versus placebo or two different 
dosages of cariprazine. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 
(1) the article being a systematic review, a meta-analysis or 
an opinion article; (2) animal studies; (3) methodological 
or technical contributions with no analysis of clinical data. 
The following data were extracted from selected articles: 
study description, drug dosage, comparator, psychometric 
instrument used duration of treatment.

2.1   Information Sources and Search Strategy

The research of selected articles was conducted on the elec-
tronic databases PubMed, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and 
Cochrane to select RCT studies investigating cariprazine. 
EUDRACT was also included to ensure the inclusion of each 
trial only once, excluding derivative studies. The search term 
‘cariprazine’ was used, and results were manually screened 
to apply inclusion/exclusion criteria. No filter or limits were 
employed. The search was conducted in January 2024.

2.2   Data Selection Process

Two authors (L.T. and S.B.) assessed the published abstracts 
of  potentially  eligible  studies  independently.  Eligibility 
assessment was performed in a standardised manner by two 
authors (L.T., S.B.). If there were doubts concerning poten-
tial eligibility, reviewers examined the full text of the arti-
cles. The two authors independently extracted relevant data 
from each included paper: NCT identification string, popula-
tion (number of subjects), dosage of cariprazine (quantita-
tively reported, and also categorically reported according to 
the following code: low—up to 1.5 mg daily, medium—up 
to 3 mg daily, high—more than 3 mg daily) psychometric 
instrument used, outcome evaluated, estimate of interven-
tion effect [calculated as mean difference (MD); comparing 
outcomes before and after treatment] along with its 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and standard error. MD was used 
as the estimate for intervention effect owing to insufficient 
data in published reports to derive the standardised mean 
difference (SMD). In case of multiple groups of interven-
tion (different dosages), an estimate of effect was derived 
for each contrast. As recommended by Cochrane [17], the 
standard error of the MD was calculated as:
Upper − Lower 95% CI
3.92

(1)

.

SMD was not calculated, as studies did not report the 
standard deviation of both the control and exposed group, 
and the standard error of the term could thus not be derived 
from the retrieved information [17].

2.3   Risk of Bias

Two authors (L.T., S.B.) independently assessed risk of 
bias for individual papers using the RoB2 [18]. Risk of bias 
scores are reported, in detail, in Supplementary Materials 
(Fig. S1).

2.4   Statistical Analysis

As study participants are nested within studies, and data 
derived may also be influenced by between-study variances, 
a multilevel data structure can be described for retrieved 
effect  sizes  [19].  Therefore,  to  address  this  dependency 
within and between effect sizes [20], and to better account 
for the above-mentioned multilevel structure, we assessed 
overall effect sizes by applying a three-level model, account-
ing for three sources of variance: sampling variance (level 1, 
variance between participants), within-study variance (level 
2, variance owing to outcomes), and between-study variance 
(level 3, variance owing to study conditions; see Table S1 
in Supplementary Materials). While multilevel models in 

963

meta-analyses have long been described (two-level models, 
equivalent to random effects models) [19], more recently the 
scientific literature has attempted to better assess uncertainty 
in meta-analyses. In this regard, specific three-level models, 
constructed as explained above, have gained prominence and 
have started to be considered as a standard tool in meta-
analytic research [21]. In other words, while standard meta-
analyses move beyond pooling effect sizes from individual 
studies (level one) pooling them (level two) to obtain an esti-
mate of effect size across studies, three-level meta-analyses 
also control for the dependencies between observed results, 
namely that one study may have contributed for more than 
one observation, or that different effect sizes may be derived 
from similar participants or overlapping samples.

A large heterogeneity between studies was found when 
meta-analysing  effect  sizes  by  outcomes  (i.e. I2 > 25%). 
Therefore, only random effect models were computed for 
each  outcome  [22,  23].  Forest  plots  were  illustrated  for 
each psychological construct. Funnel plots were visually 
inspected to check for the risk of inclusion due to publica-
tion bias. Results were also tested for publication bias by 
Egger’s test [24].

If at least one observation for each dose category was 
retrieved, a network meta-analysis was also performed, to 
compare these interventions. The network meta-analysis 
was conducted following Cochrane guidelines [25]. Multiple 
interventions (categories of drug dosage) were then ranked 
according to available evidence, according to the degree of 
effect (from highest to lowest) estimated using the surface 
under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) with n simulations 
= 10,000 [26, 27].

Sensitivity analyses were conducted, analysing each out-
come leveraging standard, non-network, multi-level meta-
analytical approaches (MD as treatment effect, NCT number 
as cluster effect), excluding (1) RCTs conducted in a non-
double-blind manner (i.e. MP-241, Nakamura et al. 2016) 
and (2) RCTs conducted in a non-double-blind manner and 
studies collecting patients without psychotic features.

All analyses were performed with R (version 4.3.3) [28] 
and RStudio (version 2023.12.1, build 402) [29], with the 
support of the following libraries: meta [30], netmeta, [31], 
metafor [32], PRISMA2020 [33] and tidyverse [34].

3   Results

A total of 773 papers were found after searching: 597 were 
screened  after  removing  duplicates,  of  which  471  were 
excluded  after  application  of  inclusion/exclusion  crite-
ria. Consequently, 126 studies were selected for full-text 
examination. Overall, 23 studies were included after full-
text examination. The NCT string identifier for RCT was 
then manually searched on EUDRACT, and 23 unique RCT

identifiers were retrieved. Of these, 11 were excluded, as 
the study was ongoing at the time of retrieval (2 studies: 
CTRI/2019/04/018793 and CTRI/2018/09/015741), data 
were  not  yet  published  (8  studies:  NCT03593213, 
NCT03573297,  NCT04771299,  NCT05913947, 
NCT05168007,  NCT03817502,  CTRI/2023/09/057293 
and CTRI/2023/09/058092), or the study was conducted 
following  open-label  stabilisation  after  20  weeks  (one 
study:  NCT01412060).  In  total,  12  studies  were  finally 
included (total n = 6477; n = 4814 patients treated with 
cariprazine, n = 1663 controls treated with placebo) [35–46]. 
See Fig. 1 for a flowchart of study retrieval (Fig. 1).

In  total,  24  pairwise  comparisons  were  retrieved  for 
clinical severity [Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)], 
14 for general psychotic symptoms [Positive and Negative 
Symptom Scale (PANSS), total score], 12 for depression 
[Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)], 
9 negative and positive psychotic symptoms [9 PANSS posi-
tive subscales, 9 PANSS negative subscales], 3 for anxiety 
[Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)] and 3 for manic 
symptoms [Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)]. Notably, 
no study enrolling patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disor-
der and assessing PANNS subscores, nor assessing MADRS, 
HAM-A or YMRS in patients with a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia were retrieved (Table 1). See Table 1 for further

details on each study, and Supplementary Fig. S1 for further 
information on the assessment of each clinical trial for risk 
of bias and Results S1 for further details on tests related to 
publication bias.

Cariprazine was significantly associated with better out-
comes across the psychosis spectrum (Table S1, estimated 
effect in MD). However, a high within-study variance was 
found (88.40% of variance explained), suggesting that out-
comes may explain most of the variance between effect 
sizes. For this reason, further results describe effect size 
estimates for each outcome. See Supplementary Materials 
Table S1 for further details.

3.1   Clinical Severity

Cariprazine was observed as effective in improving global 
clinical severity, as evaluated by CGI (MD reduction in com-
parison with placebo: low dosage – 0.249, 95% confidence 
interval – 0.370; – 0.128, medium dosage – 0.274, 95% CI 
– 0.384; – 0.163, high dosage – 0.445, 95% CI – 0.545; 
– 0.345; I2 = 26.2%,  tau2 = 0.007; number of pairwise com-
parisons = 24; Fig. 2a). SUCRA analysis confirmed that 
cariprazine was associated with better outcomes, in a dose-
response fashion (see Supplementary Materials Table S2).

3.2   Psychotic Symptoms

Cariprazine was observed as effective in improving global 
psychotic symptoms, as evaluated by PANSS total scores 
(MD  reduction  in  comparison  to  placebo:  low  dosage 
– 7.123, 95% CI − 8.270; − 5.975], medium dosage − 6.733, 
95% CI – 7.844; − 5.622, high dosage − 6.888, − 7.965; 
− 5.811; I2 = 7.5%,  tau2 = < 0.001; number of pairwise 
comparisons = 14; Fig. 2 panel b). Cariprazine was also 
observed as effective in improving positive (low dosage 
− 2.218, 95% CI − 2.895; − 1.541, medium dosage − 1.906, 
95% CI − 2.491; − 1.320, high dosage − 1.957, 95% CI 
− 2.555; − 1.358; I2 = 26.9%,  tau2 = 0.018; number of pair-
wise comparisons = 9; Fig. 2c) and negative symptoms (low 
dosage − 1.938, 95% CI − 2.748; − 1.129], medium dosage 
− 1.711, 95% CI − 2.297; − 1.125, high dosage − 1.699, 
95% CI − 2.318; − 1.080; I2 = 41.0%,  tau2 = 0.131; number 
of pairwise comparisons = 9; Fig. 2d).

3.3   Depressive Symptoms

Cariprazine was observed as effective in improving depres-
sive symptoms, as evaluated by MADRS scores (low dosage 
−2.396, 95% CI −3.432; −1.360, medium dosage −2.438, 
95%  CI  −3.712;  −1.165,  high  dosage  −1.228,  95%  CI 
−1.859; −0.596; I2 = 0%,  tau2 = < 0.001; number of pair-
wise comparisons = 12; Fig. 2e).

3.4   Manic Symptoms

Cariprazine was observed as effective in improving manic 
symptoms across the psychosis spectrum, as evaluated by 
YMRS scores (mean difference: −5.722, 95% CI −6.951; 
−4.494; I2 = 0%,  tau2 < 0.001). As less than one observation 
per dosage was retrieved for this outcome, it was not pos-
sible to estimate a ranking of efficacy by treatment dosage.

3.5   Anxiety Symptoms

Cariprazine was observed as effective in improving anxiety 
symptoms across the psychosis spectrum, as evaluated by 
HAMA scores (mean difference: −1.243, 95% CI −1.922; 
−0.564; I2 = 0%,  tau2 < 0.001). As less than one observation 
per dosage was retrieved for this outcome, it was not pos-
sible to estimate a ranking of efficacy by treatment dosage.

3.6   Sensitivity Analyses

First, studies conducted in an open-label fashion or not in 
a non-double-blind manner (i.e. MP-241, Nakamura et al. 
[46]) were excluded. Cariprazine was significantly associ-
ated with an improvement for all outcomes even excluding 
this single study (see Supplementary Materials—Results 
S2). Secondly, as some RCTs excluded patients with bipo-
lar disorders exhibiting psychotic symptoms, only RCTs 
enrolling patients with psychotic symptoms were included 
in secondary control analyses. Cariprazine was significantly 
associated with an improvement for all outcomes also when 
including only studies enrolling patients with psychotic 
symptoms  (see  Supplementary  Materials—Results  S2). 
However, no study assessing HAM-A in patients with psy-
chotic features was retrieved, and this secondary control 
analysis could not be conducted for this outcome.

4   Discussion

The current work proposed an updated systematic review of 
the existing literature on the efficacy of cariprazine across 
the psychosis spectrum, examining core symptoms (clinical 
severity, psychotic symptoms and manic symptoms) as well 
as mood (depressive) and anxiety symptoms. Current results 
suggest that cariprazine may offer clinicians a valid tool to 
target affective and anxiety symptoms along with overall 
psychotic symptoms [47, 48]. Second, a dose-response effect 
can also be observed, with different degrees of response on 
clinical severity by different dosages of cariprazine.

As previously mentioned, two meta-analyses assessed the 
efficacy of cariprazine across acute schizophrenia, namely 
Corponi and colleagues, 2017 [4]; and Zhao and colleagues, 

Cariprazine, a Network Meta-analysis Across the Psychosis Spectrum968 

L. Tarchi et al.

2018 [5]. The first assessed efficacy by dose adopting a net-
work meta-analysis, similarly to the current work. Nonethe-
less, it was conducted before the results of NCT00404573 

were available, and only assessed cariprazine dosages as 
‘high’  (higher  than  6  mg/day)  versus  ‘low’  (less  than  6 
mg/day). This division may not fully reflect the design of

included RCTs, which commonly employ dosages lower 
than 1.5 mg/day or 3 mg/day (see Table 1 for a summary of 
dosages used across RCTs). This low dose threshold may 
also explain why a dose/response gradient was not observed 
across any evaluated dimension by Corponi and colleagues 
[4].

The second meta-analysis, conducted by Zhao and col-
leagues, instead assessed the available evidence at the time 
(thus, also not retrieving NCT00404573) through standard 
meta-analytical methods. The use of standard meta-analyt-
ical methods did not allow for inclusion of a second RCT 
available at the time, which however did not have a control 
group treated with placebo (MP-214). An assessment of the 
influence of dosage on observed effects was not conducted. 
Moreover, cariprazine was evaluated only for its efficacy 
on psychotic symptoms (PANSS scores), and for the risk of 
premature discontinuation. Regarding psychotic symptoms, 
the results of Zhao and colleagues suggested that caripra-
zine interventions reduce psychotic symptoms in patients 
with schizophrenia, while also being safe and tolerable at 
the individual level.

Regarding the only other review that adopted a transdi-
agnostic approach to evaluate cariprazine efficacy [9], the 
current review observed a higher mean difference between 
placebo and cariprazine in both depression (MD: − 1.43 in 
Cooper et al., 2020; versus − 1.78 in current results), and 
manic symptoms (MD: − 5.64 in Cooper et al., 2020; ver-
sus − 5.72 in current results). The authors suggest that this 
divergence may be explained by the inclusion of three RCT 
studies in Cooper et al., 2020 which enrolled patients with 
major depression treated with cariprazine as antidepressant 
augmentation therapy rather than as an antipsychotic agent.
A transdiagnostic and dimensional approach to psychiatry 
and pharmacology is timely, as recent research suggests that 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders and bipolar disorder 
may exist on a spectrum of continuity, rather than being 
distinct disorders [11, 12]. This transdiagnostic, dimensional 
approach to the spectrum of psychosis is supported not only 
by overlapping symptoms, as described by diagnostic crite-
ria [49], but also by genetic risk factors, and neural mecha-
nisms that have been found between these conditions [50, 

969

51]. For instance, the genetic correlation between schizo-
phrenia and bipolar disorder is the highest across most psy-
chiatric disorders [52].

In summary, the current work found that cariprazine is 
efficacious in treating patients across the psychosis spec-
trum, along all of symptomatic domains evaluated (psy-
chotic symptoms—positive and negative, affective symp-
toms—depressive or manic and anxiety).

4.1   Limitations

A number of limitations may hinder the generalizability of 
current results. First, the number of pairwise comparisons 
for each outcome ranged between 14 and 3. No comparison 
was retrieved for schizoaffective disorders. For this rea-
son, less extensively studied outcomes, such as mania and 
anxiety, and less extensively studied diagnostic categories 
(schizoaffective disorder) may warrant further research on 
the topic.

Second, the quality of the reported data influences sub-
sequent meta/analytic efforts. However, the overall risk of 
bias for included studies was low (see Fig. S1) and no sig-
nificant publication bias was observed when excluding the 
single study employing an open-label design (see Fig. S2). 
Nonetheless, sample and intervention characteristics were 
not uniform across studies (e.g. phase study ranged from 
phase 2 to phase 3, with different durations of treatment). 
Although sensitivity analyses confirmed that controlling for 
these sources of heterogeneity did not change the direction 
of observed effects, future studies might explore how real-
world applications might differ from RCT settings.

Finally, the safety and tolerability of cariprazine were 
previously assessed, and were not within scope of the cur-
rent work. Nonetheless, especially when considering treat-
ment ranking by dosage, the incidence of side effects may 
influence the choice of intervention at the individual level, 
considering cost/benefit ratios.

5   Conclusions

The current meta-analysis reinforces the evidence in support 
of the efficacy of cariprazine in schizophrenia or bipolar 
disorder, also when adopting a transdiagnostic perspective. 
Moreover, the current work highlighted how cariprazine may 
be effective in addressing psychotic, affective and anxiety 
symptoms  across  this  clinical  continuum.  Previous  evi-
dence showed how cariprazine exhibits a similar profile of 
side effects in comparison to other atypical antipsychotics. 
For this reason, future research is warranted on the safety 
and tolerability of cariprazine, to carefully assess clini-
cal risk/benefit ratios in these populations. Finally, future

socio-economic perspectives might inform the adoption of 
cariprazine in specific clinical guidelines across different 
countries.
