Background
A reliable biomarker signature for bipolar disorder sensitive to
illness phase would be of considerable clinical benefit. Among
circulating blood-derived markers there has been a significant
amount of research into inflammatory markers, neurotrophins
and oxidative stress markers.

mood phase in bipolar disorder individually. Biomarker meta-
analyses suggest a combination of high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein/interleukin-6, brain derived neurotrophic factor/tumour
necrosis factor (TNF)-α and soluble TNF-α receptor 1 can differ-
entiate specific mood phase in bipolar disorder. Several other
biomarkers of interest were identified.

Aims
To synthesise and interpret existing evidence of inflammatory
markers, neurotrophins and oxidative stress markers in bipolar
disorder focusing on the mood phase of illness.

Method
Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, a systematic review was
conducted for studies investigating peripheral biomarkers in
bipolar disorder compared with healthy controls. We searched
Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, SciELO and Web of Science, and
separated studies by bipolar mood phase (mania, depression
and euthymia). Extracted data on each biomarker in separate
mood phases were synthesised using random-effects model
meta-analyses.

Results

In total, 53 studies were included, comprising 2467 cases and
2360 controls. Fourteen biomarkers were identified from meta-
analyses of three or more studies. No biomarker differentiated

Conclusions

Combining biomarker results could differentiate individuals with
bipolar disorder from healthy controls and indicate a specific
mood-phase signature. Future research should seek to test
these combinations of biomarkers in longitudinal studies.

Declaration of interest

None.

Keywords

Bipolar affective disorder (bipolar disorder) is a relatively common
severe mental illness, with worldwide lifetime prevalence of 2.4%,1
and ranks among the top ten causes of disability worldwide.2
Currently, diagnosis is based on clinical
interview, and in the
absence of biological markers this process has been criticised as
lacking objectivity and having poor reliability and validity.3
Indeed, initial diagnosis and correct treatment are often delayed
by 6–10 years,4 in part because of the difficulties of making a clinical
diagnosis. This can have a considerable impact upon clinical
effective.5
outcome
Circulating blood-derived biomarkers represent potential objective
tests that may help to address this clinical need and there has been a
surge in relevant research in recent years, particularly within the cat-
inflammatory markers and oxidative
egories of neurotrophins,
stress markers. Moreover, the phase of bipolar illness appears to
be related to some biomarker levels,6,7 and therefore it is necessary
to analyse biomarkers according to mood phase.

brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Six meta-analyses of
this data7,11–14 have found significantly lower levels of BDNF in
bipolar disorder compared with healthy controls and people with
unipolar depression, and lowered BDNF in bipolar mania and
depression.14 Neuroinflammation within the central nervous
system and neuro-humoral pathways (for example the hypothal-
amic–pituitary–adrenal axis)
linked to mood disorders.15
is
Cytokines such as interleukins (ILs), namely IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and
tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) together with the inflamma-
tory marker c-reactive protein (CRP) have been identified as poten-
tially relevant blood-borne biomarkers in bipolar, and may change
in different affective states.6,16,17 The development of the oxidative
stress theory of bipolar disorder led to identification of several
potential biomarkers such as nitric oxide (NO), thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lipid peroxidase (LPO).
Meta-analyses have found that levels of TBARS, NO and LPO are
significantly raised in people with bipolar disorder compared with
healthy controls, although participants were not separated by
mood phase.18,19

In the existing literature, syntheses to date have indicated an
effect of mood phase on biomarker levels,6,7 but have focused on indi-
vidual markers or are limited by the small number of studies investi-
gating each mood phase. There is increasing interest in the use of
biomarker combinations as diagnostic panels.20,21 These have been

third senior review author (S.M.). Data were extracted by three
reviewers (B.P., J.C. and T.R.). Details included participant charac-
teristics, diagnostic criteria, study design, outcomes measured and
data for analysis.

In studies that did not report data from which the mean and
standard deviation (s.d.) could be calculated, the corresponding
author was contacted to request the original data. If no response
was received, or data were unavailable these studies were not
included in the meta-analysis but were discussed narratively.

Analysis

The mean and s.d.s for each biomarker, separated into mood phase,
were subject to meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3, with mean differ-
ences and 95% CIs between cases and controls calculated and dis-
played in forest plots. The inverse variance method was used
where the weight given to each study is the inverse of the variance
of the effect estimate. Random-effects models were used to pool
data because of substantial clinical and methodological heterogen-
eity between studies. A meta-analysis was completed if there were
two or more separate samples of the same mood phase measuring
a given biomarker, although only meta-analyses of three or more
studies are used for drawing conclusions and identifying discrimin-
atory biomarkers. A separate sensitivity analysis using only studies
sampling patients who were psychotropic medication free (psycho-
tropics defined as antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilisers,
hypnotics, anxiolytics) was completed. Publication bias was assessed
by use of funnel plots that were assessed for asymmetry in each
meta-analysis including ten or more studies, as is recommended
for interpretation.27,28

Defining discriminatory biomarkers
We propose that a ‘fully discriminatory’ biomarker for bipolar dis-
order should be significantly different compared with that found in
matched healthy controls in only one mood phase of bipolar dis-
order, to allow it to discriminate that mood phase. A ‘partially
discriminatory’ biomarker should be significantly different from
that found in healthy controls in two mood phases of bipolar dis-
order, allowing it to discriminate the mood phase in which it is
not altered from controls.

used in many branches of medicine, such as thyroid disorders22 and
in the ‘triple test’ for Down syndrome in pregnancy.23 As yet, this is
an underutilised paradigm within psychiatric disorders. This system-
atic review and the meta-analyses therefore aimed to synthesise and
interpret existing evidence and present aggregated effect with focus
on biomarkers by phase of illness in bipolar disorder. Our objective
was to provide preliminary evidence and inform research strategies
to deliver selective biomarker signatures for bipolar disorder. As
such this evidence synthesis is designed to be exploratory, as
opposed to testing particular hypotheses.

Method

Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines,24 a systematic review and
meta-analyses were conducted for circulating biomarkers in blood
or serum of patients with bipolar disorder compared with healthy
controls. An initial scoping review was conducted to identify poten-
tial biomarkers in bipolar disorder to generate a list of search terms.
We searched Embase (1947–present), Ovid Medline (1946–
present), Web of Science (inception–present) SciELO (1998–
present) and PsycINFO (1806–present) to 1 February 2017. The
first 20 pages of Google Scholar were also searched as recom-
mended in a recent review,25 alongside searching references of
included studies for search keywords. The following MeSH head-
ings or their equivalent and text terms were used: bipolar disorder,
induced’, mania, manic, depression,
bipolar,
depressive, depressive syndrome, euthymia, euthymic grouped
with biomarker, predictor, blood, neurotrophin, oxidative stress,
brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, cytokine, monoamine,
dopamine, homovanillic acid, HVA, interleukin, tumour necrosis
factor, TNF, C reactive protein, CRP, TBARS, 3-NT, NO,

Exclusion criteria were:

(a) studies focusing purely on genetic differences between groups

(no measured biomarker);

(b) studies including participants under the age of 16 either in the
patient or control group as rates of bipolar disorder are rela-
tively rare below this age, hence diagnostic accuracy in these
patients might be reduced

The search strategy retrieved 6348 studies; 194 full texts were
reviewed, and, of these, 62 studies met inclusion criteria.29–90
Thirteen of these studies did not provide data from which the
mean and s.d. could be calculated, and the corresponding authors
were contacted. Nine studies were unable to provide this data, so
were excluded from the meta-analysis but their results are discussed
narratively. Subsequently 53 were included in the quantitative syn-
thesis (Fig. 1). Because of the number of biomarkers (n = 14), and
our objective to understand their mood phase specificity it was
necessary to complete 31 meta-analyses.

Study selection

Study titles and/or abstracts were screened independently by two
authors (B.P., J.C.) applying the inclusion criteria, in order to decide
on studies that would be examined in full-text form. Any discrepan-
cies were resolved in consultation with the senior author (S.M.).

Full-text studies were examined independently by two review
authors (B.P., J.C.) for final inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed by
two authors independently (B.P. and T.R.) using the Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale for non-randomised studies.26 Disagreement over
risk of bias assessment was resolved through involvement of a

Characteristics of the available literature

Supplementary Table 1 (available at https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.
2018.144) outlines the characteristics of the included studies. Of
the 53 studies included in meta-analyses, 49 were of case–control
design, 3 were prospective cohort studies50,58,65 and one was a
non-randomised trial.64 Baseline data were extracted, and these
were treated as case–control studies.

A total of 37 studies investigated patients in a manic or hypo-
manic phase, 40 investigated patients in a euthymic mood state

and 26 investigated depression. The determination of mood phase
varied significantly between studies, and the majority used the
Young’s Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Hamilton Rating Scale
for Depression (HRSD) to assess symptom severity. The most
common biomarker assay used was commercial enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kits, and the specific rating scales, cut-off
points and assays are described in supplementary Table 1.

Participant and clinical features of samples in included
studies

The 53 studies included in the meta-analyses included 2467 case
participants and 2360 controls, with the number of case participants
in each study varying from 10 to 141. There was a slight female pre-
dominance overall (55.6%). The mean age across studies was 38.7
years calculated where age data was available, and the mean age
within studies ranged from 23 to 65 years. Specific diagnostic cri-
teria, interview tools and main exclusion criteria of studies are
detailed in supplementary Table 1. A total of 33 studies specified
a diagnosis of bipolar disorder type I, a further 7 studies also
included bipolar disorder type II and 1 study investigated patients
with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, including both type I and II
bipolar disorder.65

Most (n = 32) studies explicitly stated that controls were age
matched, and 30 also matched for gender. All studies specified con-
trols were free from other psychiatric illnesses, with most having
used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV for this purpose.
Of the case–control studies, 15 followed up participants before
and after treatment.30,46,52,54–56,59,61,71,74–77,79 For the purpose of the
meta-analyses the values for biomarkers after treatment were only

included where the study had explicitly stated participants were in
remission following treatment and had defined the mood phase
objectively, and these were analysed as separate case–control
studies.52,60,75–77,79

Medication status

Most studies included patients taking medications (for example
lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodia-
zepines), several of which can affect oxidative stress and cytokine
levels.91–94 Fourteen studies explored patients entirely free from
medication for up to 8 weeks prior to the study. These studies
also included some patients who were drug naive, but only one
study reported only participants who were completely medication
naive.58 Three studies included patients receiving electroconvulsive
therapy.52,71,74

Risk of bias in included studies
Studies were appraised using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale,26 treating
each study as a case–control study for the purpose of the meta-
analysis. The results are shown in supplementary Table 2. Studies
scored between two and eight of a possible nine, and there was
significant variability between studies in all three sections of the
assessment. Funnel plots were examined for each meta-analysis
with more than ten studies (details available on request from the
authors), but were not found to be clearly asymmetrical, although
most analyses fell below this threshold. However,
this is in
keeping with the general findings of the study, which included find-
ings of many publications of negative results for biomarkers.

Study results

We present a summary of the findings of our meta-analyses in
Table 1, which includes the number of studies/participants, the cor-
responding summary effect size and I2 value for each meta-analysis.
Effect sizes >0.8 were regarded as ‘large’ and >0.5 as ‘moderate’.95
Forest plots are included for biomarkers that were analysed in
each mood phase (Fig. 2–4), and forest plots for the remaining bio-
markers are included in supplementary Figs 2–24. Several biomar-
kers of distinct categories, including neuroendocrine markers, were
identified but insufficient studies were available in each mood phase
to conduct meta-analyses (see supplementary Table 1).

Inflammatory mediators

In total, 32 studies investigated levels of inflammatory mediators.
High-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) was found to be elevated in both
euthymia (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.8, 95% CI 0.3 to
1.3, P = 0.002, I2 = 81%, number of studies (k) = 4, number of parti-
cipants (n) = 547) and mania (SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.11,
P<0.0001, I2 = 71%, k = 6, n = 640), but in bipolar depression there
was no significant difference from controls (SMD −0.02, 95% CI
−0.25 to 0.21, P = 0.86, I2 = 0%, k = 3, n = 420) (Fig. 2(a)).

IL1-RA levels were found to be elevated in mania (SMD 0.45,
95% CI 0.03 to 0.88, P = 0.03, I2 = 53%, k = 4, n = 399), but not
significantly raised in euthymia (SMD 0.33, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.69,
P = 0.07, I2 = 56%, k = 5, n = 469). Only two studies examined
IL1-RA in bipolar depression, but levels were not significantly
different from controls (supplementary Fig. 2).

IL-6 was found to be increased in mania (SMD 1.07, 95% CI 0.29
to 1.84, P = 0.007, I2 = 93%, k = 6, n = 695) and euthymia (SMD
0.71, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.34, P = 0.03, I2 = 92%, k = 6, n = 734) but
not significantly elevated in bipolar depression (SMD 0.67, 95%
CI −0.08 to 1.42, P = 0.08, I2 = 91%, k = 6, n = 601) (Fig. 2(b)).

Soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were increased in both euthymia
(SMD 0.86, 95% CI 0.29–1.44, P = 0.003, I2 = 78%, k = 3, n = 313)
and mania (SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.66–1.46, P < 0.00001, I2 = 49%,
k = 3, n = 279) (supplementary Fig. 3). There were insufficient
studies to perform a meta-analysis for patients with bipolar depres-
sion, but one study32 reported increased levels in bipolar depression
(P < 0.0001), and another83 reported increased levels across all
mood phases (P < 0.01).

Soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) was increased in mania (SMD
0.34, 95% CI 0.08–0.6, P = 0.01, I2 = 0%, k = 3, n = 279) and
increased in euthymia (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.25–0.97, P = 0.001,
I2 = 56%, k = 4, n = 359)
Insufficient
studies were available to conduct a meta-analysis for bipolar depres-
sion, but one study32 found sIL-6R levels were significantly increased
in bipolar depression (P < 0.0001).

(supplementary Fig. 4).

TNF-α levels were significantly increased in both mania (SMD
1.74, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.59, P < 0.0001, I2 = 93%, k = 7, n = 515) and
bipolar depression (SMD 2.09, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.36, P < 0.001,
I2 = 94%, k = 6, n = 334) but not significantly different in euthy-
mia (SMD 0.33, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.79, P = 0.16, I2 = 82%, k = 8,
n = 522) (Fig. 3(a)). One small study67 led to the particularly
large effect sizes in both mania and bipolar depression, and a
sensitivity analysis excluding that study reduced the effect
size, although the results remained significant and the effect
size remained large (SMD >0.8). A further four studies assessed
TNF-α levels but were not included in the meta-analysis, shown
in supplementary Table 1.

Soluble TNF-α receptor 1 (sTNFR1) levels were found to be
increased in mania (SMD 0.96, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.49, P = 0.0004,
I2 = 82%, k = 5, n = 609) but not significantly different in euthymia
(SMD 0.39, 95% CI −0.21 to 1.0, P = 0.21, I2 = 91%, k = 7, n = 727)

I2 = 62%, k = 3, n = 479) (Fig. 3(b)).

IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-γ levels were not found to
be different from controls in mania or euthymia (supplementary
Figs 5–8). There were too few studies to conduct meta-analyses
for bipolar depression for these biomarkers. Individual studies did
not find significant differences from controls. For the remaining

lammatory markers there were too few studies to conduct meaning-
ful meta-analyses.

Neurotrophins

There were 30 studies investigating neurotrophins. BDNF levels
were significantly decreased in both mania (SMD −0.54, 95%

depression (supplementary Fig. 9). There were insufficient studies
to conduct a meta-analysis for the other mood phases.

Oxidative stress markers

Ten studies were available, of which, two investigated TBARS in
each mood phase. In both, TBARS was increased in mania and
bipolar depression. One found TBARS to be elevated and another
decreased in euthymia (supplementary Fig. 10). There were too
few studies to conduct meaningful meta-analyses of other oxidative
stress markers.

Medication-free subgroup

patients were not found to change significantly from the overall
results in each meta-analysis. Meta-analyses with three or more
studies were performed for BDNF, IL-4, TNF-α and IFN-γ in
patients with mania and BDNF for bipolar depression. There
were insufficient studies to complete meta-analyses for any bio-
marker in euthymia in patients who were medication free.

BDNF was found to be decreased in both mania (SMD −1.16,
95% CI −1.5 to −0.81, P < 0.00001, I2 = 32%, k = 4, n = 252) and
bipolar depression (SMD −1.35, 95% CI −2.11 to −0.6, P = 0.0004,
I2 = 69%, k = 3, n = 251). TNF-α was increased in mania (SMD
3.69, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.09, P = 0.003, I2 = 96%, k = 3, n = 212). IL−4
and IFN-γ were not found to be significantly different when partici-
pants with mania where compared with healthy controls.

A subgroup analysis was performed for the 15 studies that investi-
gated biomarkers in patients that were free from all psychotropic
medication at the time of assessment, and forest plots are presented
in supplementary Figs 11–14. The results in medication-free

Discriminatory biomarkers

There were a sufficient number of studies to analyse five biomarkers
across each mood phase of bipolar disorder. sTNFR1 is raised in

mania but is not significantly different in bipolar depression or
euthymia. BDNF is significantly decreased in both mania and
bipolar depression, whereas TNF-α is raised in mania and bipolar
depression, and neither are significantly different from levels in con-
trols in euthymia. hsCRP and IL-6 are raised in both euthymia and
mania but are not significantly different from controls in bipolar
depression. A combination of these biomarkers appears to be differ-
entially altered in each mood phase, as described in Table 2.
A summary of the effect sizes of these biomarkers in each mood
phase is shown in supplementary Fig. 1.

In addition, we present three further biomarkers (IL-1RA, sIL2-
R, sIL6-R) (described in Table 1) that require further work in spe-
cific mood phases that did not have sufficient studies to be included
in a meta-analysis.

Discussion

This systematic review and series of exploratory meta-analyses report
results that include neurotrophic, inflammatory and oxidative stress
biomarkers, separated by affective state (euthymia, mania, depression)
in bipolar disorder. We were able to include 53 studies comprising 2467
participants and 2360 healthy controls, synthesising data on 14 differ-
ent biomarkers. A combination of hsCRP/IL-6, BDNF/TNF-α and
sTNFR1 appear to be differentially altered in each mood phase.

Previous meta-analyses have investigated specific biomarkers in
bipolar disorder, including hsCRP, cytokines, BDNF and oxidative
stress markers. However, this review is the first to combine multiple
circulating blood-derived biomarkers separated by mood phase in
bipolar disorder. Important results can be unmasked in this type
of finer grain analysis that have the potential to bring translational
impact a step closer. This review may help to shape future research
strategies to translate biological findings into clinical practice.
Increased awareness of the pathophysiological and biochemical
differences that separate not only the varied poles present in
bipolar disorder, but also those that differentiate bipolar disorder
from other affective illnesses such as unipolar depression, may
help to facilitate expedited diagnosis and hint towards future
pharmacological targets for bipolar disorder.

Main findings: potential discriminatory and
non-discriminatory biomarkers

We present a combination of five biomarkers that appear discrim-
inatory based upon our proposed definition. These are hsCRP/IL-6,
BDNF/TNF-α and sTNFR1 shown in Table 2. sTNFR1 appears to
discriminate mania only, where it is significantly different from con-
trols. Levels of BDNF, hsCRP, IL-6 and TNF-α are able to discrim-
inate either euthymia or depression by being no different in that
mood phase in comparison with levels in controls but altered in
other mood phases. Both hsCRP and IL-6 discriminate bipolar
depression, their levels being no different from controls, whereas
BDNF and TNF-α are significantly altered in both mania and
depression and not significantly different in euthymia compared

with controls, and therefore may be more generalised markers of
affective disturbance in bipolar disorder. In our analysis, there
were no biomarkers that would individually be able to discriminate
each mood phase. However, our findings suggest the combination of
hsCRP/IL-6, sTNFR1 with BDNF/TNF-α would meet this criterion.
We also describe three biomarkers that may have the potential to
be discriminatory, although further research is required. For example,
IL-1RA was raised in mania but not significantly different from lvels
in controls in euthymia. The two studies investigating IL-1RA in
bipolar depression also found levels not significantly different from
controls, and if confirmed in further studies this would support the
potential of this marker to discriminate bipolar mania. sIL-2R and
sIL-6R may have the potential to be discriminatory although only
when combined with other biomarkers, and future research is
required of these markers in the bipolar depression phase.

Levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ were not significantly dif-
ferent from controls in either mania or euthymia, but current study
numbers mean no conclusions can be reached regarding levels in
bipolar depression; further studies are required. Assessing only
patients free from psychotropic medications at the time of biomarker
measurement did not affect the significance or direction of the main
results, supporting the direction and validity of the main results.

Comparisons with other research

BDNF

This meta-analysis found decreased BDNF levels in both mania and
depression, but not euthymia. A particularly large effect size was
seen in depression (SMD −0.86) and a moderate effect size in
mania (SMD −0.54). In fact, BDNF was the only biomarker in
our analysis to be significantly decreased in comparison with
healthy controls, in any mood state. These findings are in line
with other research into bipolar disorder,7,12,14 but it is also note-
worthy that decreased BDNF is associated with schizophrenia and
unipolar depression.96,97

IL-6, sIL-6R and hsCRP

IL-6, sIL-6R and hsCRP were found to be increased in euthymia and
mania, but not in bipolar depression (for sIL-6R insufficient studies
were available to conduct a meta-analysis for depression). This may
add to the validity of our results as there is evidence linking the
inflammatory pathways of these markers; IL-6 is one of the
primary cytokines in the inflammatory cascade, which stimulates
production of CRP,98 and its proinflammatory action is mediated
by its soluble receptor sIL-6R.99

There is relatively strong evidence that hsCRP and IL-6 are
raised in unipolar depression,100,101 whereas our results suggest
this is not the case in bipolar depression, although it is unclear
whether this may be because of methodological differences
between studies. Nevertheless, this not only raises the possibility
of a useful biomarker to differentiate bipolar disorder from unipolar
depression, but points to the differing pathophysiology of the disor-
ders and differences in their respective inflammatory profiles.

TNF-α, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2
TNF-α has been described as one of the primary inflammatory med-
iators,102 driving production of other cytokines such as IL-6 and
CRP,98 all of which were found to be elevated in bipolar mania in
our analysis. TNF-α and its soluble receptors have been implicated
in neurocognition in bipolar disorder,103 and previous meta-ana-
lyses have found TNF-α and sTNFR1 elevated in mania6 but it
remains unclear what role sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 have during the
depressive mood phase.

Oxidative stress markers

Oxidative stress markers have been investigated in previous meta-
analyses,18,19 although these did not separate results by affective
state. Oxidative stress markers have been implicated in multiple
including schizophrenia,104 depression,
psychiatric disorders
anxiety, dementia and substance misuse.105 TBARS in particular
appear to be increased in schizophrenia,105 although not in unipolar
depression,106,107 indicating a possible differential biomarker from
bipolar depression if results are confirmed by further studies.

Within-participant differences

studies

Several studies examined changes in biomarkers levels within parti-
cipants following treatment or a change in mood phase. Findings
were generally inconsistent for the biomarkers under investigation;
showing BDNF levels may increase,74
for example,
decrease52 or remain unchanged.50,59,65 between manic episode
and subsequent remission. Some studies went beyond assessment
of difference in biomarker level between mood phases, finding
that decreases in sIL-2R levels between mania and subsequent
in symptoms.75,77
remission correlated with an improvement
Individual changes in biomarker levels between mood phases and
how this correlates with treatment or clinical improvement is cur-
rently understudied.

Interaction of biomarkers

The markers identified in this review are unlikely to be altered in
isolation. There is evidence that multiple pathways interact to
cause downstream effects. Neuroinflammation appears to cause
dysfunction in several neurotransmitter systems and neuronal sig-
nalling, whereas proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and
Il-6 that this review found to be raised in bipolar mania activate
microglia that release reactive oxygen species contributing to oxida-
tive damage, protein aggregation and apoptosis.102 These changes in
glial function then decrease production of neurotrophic factors such
as BDNF.108 These interactive effects may be one reason that a bio-
marker panel approach may be worthwhile.

Strengths and limitations

This comprehensive systematic review includes a series of explora-
tory meta-analyses of inflammatory, neurotrophic and oxidative
stress markers in bipolar disorder. This review separated the
results of each biomarker by mood phase, which not only provides
information as to physiological changes, but also reduces the risk of
type 2 error where there are true state-related changes in biomar-
kers. The use of random-effects models in each analysis also adds
further validity to the results.

Notwithstanding this, there are several limitations and results
should be interpreted with some caution, in part because of the
nature of the literature reviewed. The robustness of our results is
dependent on the quality of the primary studies, most of which
were observational and at significant risk of bias and confounding.
The significant methodological heterogeneity between included
studies becomes problematic when attempting to use biomarkers as
a diagnostic tool in bipolar disorder and means our results and con-
clusions should be considered tentative. The individual patient char-
acteristics varied greatly between studies, and factors such as body
mass index, blood pressure, physical activity and smoking status,
which were heterogeneously addressed among studies, can affect bio-
marker levels.109–111 Factors such as duration of the illness or mood
phase, the specific assay used and whether the biomarker was mea-
sured in plasma or serum may also influence biomarker levels.7,112
The inclusion of patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder type
II or hypomania, and variation in the YMRS and HRSD scores

used to define mood phases are likely to have contributed to the sig-
nificant heterogeneity in the results of the meta-analyses and intro-
duced potential confounders. In addition, the definition of ‘healthy
controls’ varied considerably. Furthermore, as studies that investi-
gated multiple biomarkers compared these with a single control
group, these are repeated in the separate meta-analyses, and any
abnormalities in these control groups may be amplified.

Most studies also included both patients taking medicated and
those not, and many psychotropics such as lithium, valproate and
antipsychotics are known to affect biomarker levels.91–94 Several
studies also reported biomarker levels following successful treat-
ment and remission, and it is unclear if there is a lag time to normal-
isation of the biomarker. However, including only patients free from
psychotropic medications at the time of assessment did not appear
to change our main findings.

The biomarkers investigated in this review, particularly pro-
and anti-inflammatory cytokines113 may be correlated and we
could not account for this in our analysis. Future studies moving
towards translation to a clinical test need to account for this.

Mixed states have long been known to occur in bipolar disorder
but undoubtedly present a nosological problem114,115 and as such a
major challenge in linking the clinical picture to biomarker levels.
We cannot be clear to what extent this phenomenon will have
had an impact on the primary studies as well as our results.
Although some studies did investigate biomarkers in those with a
diagnosis of mixed affective state these were not of sufficient
number to conduct meaningful analysis. However, it is likely that
especially in older studies, some people diagnosed as having
mania or depression may have had a mixed states picture.

The issue of publication bias has been raised in relation to bio-
markers in bipolar disorder, with concern that positive results are
more likely to be published.116 However, in this meta-analysis
examination of funnel plots with sufficient number of studies
resulted in no obvious asymmetry, and a number of negative
results were identified, leading to several findings of biomarkers
that appear to be unchanged in bipolar disorder. It is therefore
unlikely that an excess of positive results affected the overall
results of the meta-analysis. However, as many analyses included
too few studies for funnel plots to be meaningfully interpreted, it
is unclear if publication bias may be a factor in some of these less
extensively investigated markers.

Because of the comprehensive scope of our review and the need
to separate results by mood phase, we conducted a considerable
number of meta-analyses, and this increases the risk of type 1
error. Applying a correction for multiple testing is likely to exclude
biomarkers that are promising but for which there are too few
studies. As the purpose of the review was exploratory as opposed
to hypothesis testing, we did not correct for multiple testing, and
enable readers to understand the full breadth of the extant literature.
However, it is important to consider this and therefore exercise
caution in weighing and using our findings. Equally, because of
the exploratory nature of the review we were unable to prospectively
perform a sample size calculation for each biomarker, and therefore
it is likely that for some biomarkers the meta-analyses are underpow-
ered as a result of the small number of studies included.

Implications and future directions

The identification of discriminant biomarkers has potentially signifi-
cant clinical relevance through increasing diagnostic accuracy, moni-
toring of disease severity, predicting changes in mood phase as well as
providing information about the underlying neurobiology of bipolar
disorder. Although there remains inconclusive evidence at present, a
number of biomarkers show promise in their ability to differentiate
mood phases in people with bipolar disorder from healthy controls,

522

Biomarkers and mood states in bipolar disorder

and potentially from other mental illnesses that may present similarly
to bipolar disorder and thus make clinical diagnosis challenging. This
review investigated state-related biomarkers. However, markers such
as BDNF and TNF-α are associated with illness duration,86 whereas
alterations in IL-6 during childhood are associated with onset of hypo-
manic symptoms in adulthood.117 Therefore, further investigation is
required of how far the identified biomarkers represent longer term
markers of illness, as well as markers of mood phase. Prospective
cohort studies with repeated measures of these biomarkers are neces-
sary to determine the temporality of biomarker change with mood
phase, exclude confounders such as illness duration and medications,
and determine the predictive value of such biomarkers.

Finally, the comparisons of our findings with other literature have
identified some potential biomarker differences between specific
mood phases in bipolar disorder from other major mental illnesses
that can present similarly, such as IL-6 in and hsCRP in unipolar
and bipolar depression. Further longitudinal research in this area
may help to unearth strong candidates for biomarkers that can differ-
entiate bipolar disorder from other psychiatric disorders that have bio-
marker associations such as unipolar depression and schizophrenia.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis has identified neurotrophic,
inflammatory and oxidative stress markers that are altered during
different mood phases of bipolar disorder. Most significantly, a
combination of hsCRP/IL-6, BDNF/TNF-α and sTNFR1 may
offer the potential to differentiate people with bipolar disorder
from matched controls specific to bipolar mood phase.
