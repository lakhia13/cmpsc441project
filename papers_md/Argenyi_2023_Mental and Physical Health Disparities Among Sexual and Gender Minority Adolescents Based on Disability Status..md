Mental and Physical Health Disparities Among Sexual
and Gender Minority Adolescents Based on Disability Status

Michael S. Argenyi, MD, MPH, MSW,1,2,* Ethan H. Mereish, PhD,3,{ and Ryan J. Watson, PhD4

Abstract

Purpose: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth and youth with disabilities both experience health disparities.
Little data exist on whether SGM youth with disabilities have worse health outcomes compared with SGM youth
without disabilities. This study aimed to examine differences in health behaviors and outcomes among a sample
of SGM youth by different types of disabilities.
Methods: Secondary analyses were conducted with a subset (N = 9418) of the LGBTQ National Teen Survey, a
comprehensive survey of risk and protective factors and health outcomes of SGM youth across the United States
collected in 2017. Multiple types of disabilities (physical, cognitive, or psychiatric) and mental, behavioral, and
physical health outcomes were self-reported.
Results: Of the sample, 18.3% reported a disability. Signiﬁcant ﬁndings included higher odds of exercise avoidance,
greater depressive symptoms and sleep concerns, and lower self-esteem and overall health ratings among SGM
youth who reported any form of disability compared with SGM youth who reported no disability. Youth with cog-
nitive disabilities had lower odds of alcohol use than youth with no disability. Youth with psychiatric disabilities had
higher odds of cannabis and cigarette use, and lower physical activity than youth with no disability. Youth with
either psychiatric or physical disabilities reported higher body mass index than youth with no disability.
Conclusion: SGM youth with disabilities experience greater health disparities than SGM youth with no reported
disabilities. Results provide groundwork evidence about the impact of disability status on SGM adolescents.
Disability-inclusive or -speciﬁc frameworks are needed for future interventions and studies of SGM youth.

Introduction

Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth experience

increased rates of adverse mental, behavioral, and phys-
ical outcomes compared with heterosexual and cisgender
peers. For instance, sexual minority youth report higher
rates of substance use and poor mental health than heterosex-
ual peers.1 They are also less likely to participate in physical
activity; in particular, sexual minority adolescent girls are at
greater risk of being overweight or obese.2 However, dispar-
ities are not uniformly distributed; gender minority youth are

more likely to be overweight and physically inactive than
sexual minority cisgender peers.3

These disparities are consistent with the minority stress
model, which posits that the burden of unique stressors
SGM youth experience related to their stigmatized identities
puts them at risk of poor health.4 Essentially, minority stress-
ors (e.g., enacted victimization or discrimination, internal-
ized stigma), largely driven by stigma and marginalization,
are chronic stressors that have deleterious effects on health.
The extent to which subgroups of SGM youth who expe-
rience multiple forms of marginalization, such as SGM

youth with disabilities, are at greater health risks is signiﬁ-
cantly understudied.

The prevalence estimates of disability among children in the
United States vary. One population estimate is 5.6% for chil-
dren aged 5–17,5 while *14% of public school students of
age 3–21 receive special education services.6 The prevalence
of disability increases with age. Youth with disabilities also ex-
perience health disparities and higher health risks, such as in-
creased tobacco product use and condomless sex.7,8 Although
some disparities may stem from chronic physical and mental
health conditions related to their disability, social oppression
that perpetuates ableist barriers and stigma is another factor.9
There is a dearth of existing literature on health behaviors
and outcomes at the intersection between SGM and disabil-
ity status, in part because like sexual orientation and gender
identity demographics, data collection on disability has been
rare.10 However, research among adults is concerning; for
example, a study of adults with autism spectrum disorders
showed signiﬁcantly higher smoking rates and self-reported
mental health conditions among SGM adults compared with
heterosexual cisgender peers.11

Sexual minority youth are more likely to have disabilities,
including learning disabilities, than heterosexual peers.12 In
addition, sexual minority youth with disabilities experi-
ence increased suicidal ideation compared with heterosexual
youth with or without disabilities and sexual minority youth
without disabilities.13 Nonetheless, having multiple minority
identities may also foster increased resilience or different ef-
fective coping strategies, as seen in SGM adolescents of ra-
cial and ethnic minority backgrounds.14,15

Knowledge about adolescent health outcomes for SGM
youth with and without disabilities would allow researchers,
policymakers, and clinicians to better understand unique
health inequities, which can help inform and foster antiable-
ist and resiliency-generating environments for youth with
disabilities. This article aimed to describe mental and phys-
ical health behaviors and outcomes by disability status
among a large national nonprobability sample of SGM ado-
lescents. We speciﬁcally focused on health disparities by
overall disability status and three different types of disabil-
ities (i.e., physical, cognitive, and psychiatric). We hypothe-
sized that SGM adolescents with a reported disability would
show poorer mental and physical health outcomes than SGM
adolescents without a reported disability.

Methods

Procedures

Secondary data analyses were conducted using the 2017
LGBTQ National Teen Survey, a comprehensive cross-
sectional survey containing risk and protective factors and
health outcomes of SGM youth across the United States.16
Inclusion criteria were identiﬁcation as a sexual and/or gen-
der minority, ages 13–17 years, a resident of the United
States, and ability to read and understand English. For the
purposes of this study, only participants who responded to
the self-reported disability measure were included in the an-
alyses. Of those participants, 1906 were excluded for endors-
ing ‘‘don’t know’’ for whether they had a known disability.
The ﬁnal analytic sample was N = 9418.

Participants were surveyed through several media of
online recruitment. The original study was approved by

University of Connecticut’s Institutional Review Board
#16–322. The analyses in this study utilized the anonymous
dataset and were exempt from review. Consistent with prior
work with SGM youth, parental permission was waived.
Adolescent informed assent was obtained. More detailed in-
formation regarding the study design and data cleaning and
preparation can be found elsewhere.16 Responses were ana-
lyzed to minimize mischievous bias,17 and responses were
anonymous to minimize social desirability bias.

Measures

Demographic characteristics. All demographic charac-
teristics were self-reported, including age, sex assigned at
birth (‘‘What sex were you assigned at birth?’’), gender iden-
tity (‘‘What is your current gender identity?’’), race/ethnicity
(Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native,
Asian or Paciﬁc Islander; Hispanic/Latino[a/x], White, or
other), sexual orientation (‘‘How do you describe your sexual
identity?’’). Table 1 lists response options; the measures have
been previously reported elsewhere.16 Gender identity (cisgen-
der or transgender/gender minority) was constructed using sex
assigned at birth and current gender identity. Geographical re-
gion was grouped by reported U.S. state into Northeast, Mid-
west, South, and West by the primary study team.

Disability. A question set assessed participants’ disability
identiﬁcation. First, participants were asked, ‘‘Do you con-
sider yourself to have a disability?’’ Response options were
yes, no, or don’t know. ‘‘Don’t know’’ responses were ex-
cluded from data analyses. If yes was endorsed, participants
were asked, ‘‘Which of the following best describes the
disability/disabilities that you have? Please select all that
apply.’’ Response options were physical, developmental
or learning, psychiatric/mental health, or another type of
disability, please describe. Write-in responses were further
recategorized based on each disability’s classic impact
(e.g., physical disabilities included hearing loss; attention-
deﬁcient/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum,
and learning disorders were coded as cognitive disabilities,18
and depression was coded as psychiatric).

Mental health outcomes. Depressive symptoms were
assessed with 10 items from the Kutcher Adolescent Depres-
sion Scale.19 Participants reported if they experienced any of
the symptoms in the past week (e.g., ‘‘low mood, sadness,
feeling blah or down, depressed, just can’t be bothered’’).
Responses ranged from 0 (hardly ever) to 3 (all of the
time), and items were summed. Self-esteem was assessed
with the 10-item Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (e.g., ‘‘I
feel that I have a number of good qualities’’).20 Responses
ranged from 0 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree) and
were averaged.

Lifetime substance use outcomes. We assessed recent
alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis consumption using questions
similar to items in the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
Substance use outcomes were as follows: alcohol use (‘‘Dur-
ing your life, on how many days did you have at least
one drink of alcohol?’’), cannabis (‘‘During your life, on
how many days did you use marijuana?’’), and cigarettes
(‘‘Have you ever tried cigarette smoking, even one or two

ranged from 0 (0 days) to 6 (‡100 days), and for cigarette
use were 0 (No) and 1 (Yes). Consistent with prior
work,21,22 all substance use items were recoded to reﬂect
no use = 0 and any lifetime use = 1.

Physical health outcomes. Participants rated their over-
all health with one item (‘‘How would you describe your
health?’’); response options were 0 ( poor) to 3 (excellent).23
Sleep was measured by one item (‘‘How often do you have
trouble getting to sleep?’’), with responses ranging from
0 = never to 4 = always.24 Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated with height, weight, age, and sex of participants
using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth
charts.25

Physical activity was measured with the Godin Leisure-
Time Exercise Questionnaire, which assessed strenuous,
moderate, and mild exercise of at least 15 minutes dura-
tion.26 This scale calculates an overall weighted activity
score based on the frequency and intensity of exercise
(e.g., mild activity was weighted by three points, whereas
strenuous activity was weighted by nine points); higher
scores indicate a higher activity level.26 Exercise avoidance
was assessed with a binary question, which asked partici-
pants if they avoided exercise (‘‘Do you ever avoid exer-
cise?’’); response options were 0 (No) and 1 (Yes).

Analytic plan

Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted using
IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25. For descriptive purposes,
we conducted t-tests and v2 tests to examine differences by
disability status (no reported disability vs. having any dis-
ability) in our sociodemographic and outcome variables.
We then conducted regression analyses to test disability dis-
parities in mental health, substance use, and physical health
outcomes.

We conducted four separate models for endorsement of
any disability (no disability vs. having any disability) and
each type of disability (i.e., physical, cognitive, and psychi-
atric) for each health outcome. Logistic regressions were
used for dichotomous outcomes (substance use, exercise
avoidance), and linear regressions were used for continuous
outcomes (depression, self-esteem, overall health rating,
sleep, BMI, and physical activity). All models accounted
for sociodemographic variables (age, gender identity, sexual
orientation, race/ethnicity, and geographical region).

cannabis use, cigarette use, overall health rating, sleep, BMI,
exercise avoidance, and physical activity.

Results of the regression models are reported in Table 2.
We found that participants who reported physical, cognitive,
or psychiatric disability had greater depressive symptoms
and lower self-esteem than those with no reported physi-
cal (b = 0.07, b = (cid:2)0.06), cognitive (b = 0.09, b = (cid:2)0.07), or
psychiatric disability (b = 0.23, b = (cid:2)0.19).

Physical disability was not associated with any substance use
outcomes. Participants with a cognitive disability had lower
odds of alcohol use than those with no reported cognitive dis-
ability (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.80, 95% conﬁdence in-
terval [CI] 0.67–0.95); cognitive disability was not associated
with cannabis or cigarette use. Participants with a reported psy-
chiatric disability had greater odds of cannabis and cigarette use
than those with no reported psychiatric disability (AOR = 1.22,
95% CI 1.07–1.40; AOR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.10–1.45); psychiat-
ric disability was not associated with alcohol use.

Participants who reported a physical, cognitive, or psychi-
atric disability had poorer overall health rating and sleep
than those with no reported physical (b = (cid:2)0.12; b = 0.05),
cognitive (b = (cid:2)0.08; b = 0.07), or psychiatric disability (b =
(cid:2)0.19; b = 0.14). Participants with a physical or psychiatric
disability had greater BMI than those with no reported phys-
ical (b = 0.04) or psychiatric disability (b = 0.05), respective-
ly; cognitive disability was not associated with BMI.

Participants who reported a physical, cognitive, or psy-
chiatric disability had higher odds of exercise avoidance
than those with no reported physical (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI
1.15–1.80), cognitive (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.09–1.62), or
psychiatric disability (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.41–1.87). Par-
ticipants with a reported psychiatric disability were less
likely to be engaged in physical activity than those with no
reported psychiatric disability (b = (cid:2)0.037); physical and
cognitive disabilities were not associated with differences
in physical activity.

The pattern of results comparing participants with no
reported disability with participants with any reported dis-
ability across mental health, substance use, and physical
health outcomes was consistent with the psychiatric disability
results. Speciﬁcally, participants reporting any type of dis-
ability had greater depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem,
higher odds of cannabis and cigarette use, poorer overall
health rating and sleep, greater BMI, higher odds of exercise
avoidance, and were less likely to be engaged in physical ac-
tivity than participants with no reported disability.

Results

Discussion

Of the total sample, 18.3% reported having a disability.
Of those reporting a disability, 78.2% reported a psychiatric
disability, 32.4% a cognitive disability, and 25.9% a physical
disability. Participants were 13–17 years old (mean [M] =
15.62, standard deviation = 1.25). Most participants reported
their assigned sex at birth as female (73.4%) and were cis-
gender (68.9%). Most participants were gay/lesbian (38.2%)
or bisexual (34.5%). Participants were mostly White
(66.3%), with the largest proportion coming from the South
(36.5%). More detailed participant information is presented
in Table 1. t-Tests and v2 tests indicated that there were sig-
niﬁcant differences by disability status in sex, gender, sexual
orientation, race/ethnicity, depressive symptoms, self-esteem,

This study examined differences by disability status in
multiple mental and physical health behaviors in a large na-
tional sample of SGM youth. Overall, nearly one in ﬁve
SGM youth reported having a disability; psychiatric disabil-
ities were most commonly reported in the sample. We found
some differences by disability status for several health be-
haviors and outcomes.

The results of our study revealed differences in mental
health, substance use, and sleep outcomes based on disability
status among SGM youth. It is unsurprising to ﬁnd higher
likelihood of recent depressive symptoms, in part because
youth with a reported psychiatric disability were included in
the study. However, minority stress may also help explain these

differences. Given that SGM-speciﬁc minority stressors con-
tribute to poor mental health and greater substance use, re-
search is needed to examine the impact of ableism-based
minority stress in understanding these disparities.

Ableism-based minority stress may stem from different
causes such as chronic inaccessibility, ability-based harass-
ment, exclusion, and discrimination, or medical
trauma.
These can be internalized as stigma or disability conceal-
ment. SGM youth with disabilities experiencing multiple
forms of minority stress might experience synergistic or dif-
ferential effects compared with youth without disabilities if
only one or no identity is supported.

Symptoms of some disabilities can be inherently dis-
ruptive of sleep, such as disrupted sleep stemming from
depression or chronic pain. Unfortunately, no literature
seems to exist on this for adolescents. However, one
study of adults found that adults with disabilities had
higher prevalence of short sleep duration compared with
those without disabilities (43.8% compared with 31.6%,
respectively).27

SGM youth reporting psychiatric disabilities had greater
risk of tobacco and cannabis use than their peers. This corre-
sponds with a survey ﬁnding high rates of illicit substance
use among adolescents with psychiatric disabilities,28 includ-

ing social anxiety disorder, an identiﬁed risk factor for alco-
hol and cannabis use.29 Similarly, electronic cigarette use is
consistently associated with greater mental health problems
among adolescents, although directionality is uncertain.30
SGM youth with disabilities may self-medicate to cope
with ableism-speciﬁc minority stressors, such as ableist ex-
clusionary experiences, which could explain greater risk
for substance use.

In contrast, we found that SGM youth with a reported
cognitive disability had lower odds of alcohol use than
SGM youth without a reported cognitive disability. This
ﬁnding is surprising, given that ADHD is associated with
substance use. However, some literature suggests that
youth with cognitive disabilities may be rejected by their
peers and excluded from events, including ones with ado-
lescent alcohol use, conferring a protective effect by an ex-
clusionary mechanism.31,32

The ﬁndings of our study suggest that there are differences
in physical health behaviors and outcomes based on disabil-
ity status among SGM youth. Overall, SGM youth with dis-
abilities had lower health ratings compared with SGM youth
without a reported disability, which is expected given the
extensive literature indicating that disability is associated with
poorer health. However, this could also reﬂect internalized

136

disability stigma, which is categorized as internalizing negative
stereotypes about people with disabilities into one’s self-
concept.33 For example, SGM youth with disabilities may inter-
nalize a commonly held stigmatizing belief that having a dis-
ability means one cannot have perfect health, and in turn
view themselves and their health in a negative manner.34,35
This may cause youth to self-report lower health status than
their true health status.

Ableism-speciﬁc minority stress might also explain dis-
parities in physical behaviors and outcomes. For example,
contexts where physical activity is promoted are often able-
ist; thus, SGM youth with disabilities may avoid these set-
tings to avoid experiencing ableism. We also found that
SGM youth with a reported physical or psychiatric disability
had higher BMI than SGM youth with no reported physical
or psychiatric disability. This ﬁnding is consistent with
prior work, demonstrating that youth with disabilities have
higher prevalence of obesity compared with youth without
disabilities.36 Instilling physical exercise routines during
this period is more likely to persist into adulthood, which rai-
ses concerns that SGM youth with disabilities will experi-
ence increased disparities as they transition into adulthood.

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of this study include its unique ability to exam-
ine disparities in several mental and physical health out-
comes among a large national sample of SGM youth based
on disability status and the inclusion of multiple categories
of disability. However, future studies could be strengthened
by addressing the following limitations: The assessments are
self-reported, and collapsed scales may obscure nuanced dif-
ferences. The cross-sectional design cannot demonstrate
trends in health outcomes that may not emerge until adult-
hood. Disabilities may have been misclassiﬁed into catego-
ries, which we argue would be nondifferential. Reported
disability was only available for a small subset of partici-
pants, prohibiting us from more nuanced analysis or disag-
gregating by further disability type (e.g., physical included
both sensory and mobility).

Severity of disability was not assessed in this study. Fur-
thermore, those with more severe disabilities may not be rep-
resented, limiting our ability to evaluate whether severity
correlates with poorer outcomes and potentially underesti-
mating the impact of disability-speciﬁc minority stress.
We also aggregated SGM youth into one group, which
may hide gendered nuances, especially for gender minority
youth with disabilities. Given that we found that gender mi-
nority youth reported greater rates of disabilities than cis-
gender youth in our sample, future work should examine
disability disparities in health outcomes, speciﬁcally for gen-
der minority youth.

Conclusions

Disability is often ignored, and may impact health behav-
iors and outcomes. Despite the overall small magnitude of
differences seen among our reported health outcomes by dis-
ability status, these differences may accumulate over years if
not addressed. Future work is needed to understand how
ableism-speciﬁc minority stress may also interact with psy-
chological and socioenvironmental factors to impact health
outcomes. Further work is also needed to understand the in-

tersection between identities, stigma, and health behaviors, and
how they may impact health outcomes and access as well as
health care utilization among SGM youth with disabilities.
Our study provides initial insights into the impact of disability
on SGM adolescents, which can inform design of disability-
inclusive frameworks for future interventions and studies.
