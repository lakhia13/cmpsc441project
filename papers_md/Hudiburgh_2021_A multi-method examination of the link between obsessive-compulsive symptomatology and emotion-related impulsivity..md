Abstract

Objectives.—Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition marked by recurrent and 
distressing thoughts, images, and urges accompanied by repetitive physical or mental rituals. An 
emerging line of work suggests that emotion may be an important consideration when looking at 
the role of impulsivity across the spectrum of psychopathology, including OCD. The current study 
examined the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptomatology (OCS) and impulsive 
cognitive and behavioural reactions to emotion using a multi-study, multi-method approach.

Design.—Data were collected cross-sectionally online (Study 1) or via an in-person laboratory 
visit (Study 2).

Methods.—In Study 1, self-report measures of impulsivity and OCS were administered to a 
large, non-selected community sample (N = 386). Study 2 extended these findings with a young 
adult sample (N = 107) with clinically elevated OCS using self-report measures, clinical interview, 
and two behavioural symptom provocation tasks.

Results.—Emotion-related impulsivity, but not non-emotion-related impulsivity, was associated 
with greater severity of OCS across symptom domains and across all modes of assessment. 
Impulsive cognitive responses to emotion were associated with greater obsession severity, while 
impulsive behavioural reactions to emotion were associated with greater compulsions. Emotion-
related impulsivity also acted synergistically with a belief in the importance and control of 
thoughts, such that this established risk factor for OCD was associated with greater OCS severity 
only when behavioural reactivity to emotion was also present.

Conclusions.—Results highlight the importance of considering emotional context when 
studying impulsivity in OCD, and point to the potentially differential relationship between OCS 
and behavioural versus cognitive impulsive reactions to emotion.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition marked by intrusive, unwanted 
thoughts, images, or urges (i.e., obsessions), and behavioural rituals or mental acts (i.e., 
compulsions). OCD is a notably heterogeneous condition, with symptoms clustering within 
several distinct domains: contamination/washing, harm/checking, repugnant thoughts (e.g., 
sexual/aggressive/religious obsessions), and symmetry/ordering (Mataix-Cols, do Rosario-
Campos, & Leckman, 2005). Obsessions and compulsions are dimensionally distributed 
in the population (Olatunji, Williams, Haslam, Abramowitz, & Tolin, 2008) and even 
subclinical symptoms can interfere markedly with functioning (Adam, Meinlschmidt, 
Gloster, & Lieb, 2012; Angst et al., 2004). Approximately 1–2% of the population meets 
diagnostic criteria for OCD (Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, & Kessler, 2010; Weissman, Bland, 
Canino, & Greenwald, 1994), and while the condition is typically chronic, symptoms will 
often wax and wane (Kichuk et al., 2013).

OCD has traditionally been considered a disorder of excessive compulsivity (Hollander, 
2005). A central focus of vulnerability research has therefore been to understand 
mechanisms that may contribute to rigid and repetitive compulsive behaviours (Fineberg 
et al., 2010). This conceptualization of OCD has also implicitly de-emphasized impulsivity 
as a potential risk factor because impulsivity and compulsivity have historically been placed 
at opposite ends of a spectrum (Hollander, 2005). However, as noted by multiple authors, 
placing impulsivity and compulsivity at opposite ends of a single continuum produces an 
oversimplified dichotomy (Dalley, Everitt, & Robbins, 2011). The presence of compulsive 
behaviours does not necessarily preclude impulsivity. Indeed, Fontenelle, Oostermeijer, 
Harrison, Pantelis, and Yücel (2011) highlight how behaviours traditionally considered 
compulsive in nature (e.g., OCD-related washing or checking), may become more impulsive 
with disease progression. Likewise, Kashyap et al. (2012) propose that some individuals 
with OCD may have an ‘impulsive’ form of the disorder, as evidenced by limited insight, as 
well as little resistance to and poor control over primary OCD symptoms.

Several studies have investigated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive 
symptomatology (OCS) and levels of self-reported impulsivity.1 The majority of these 
investigations have used the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11; Patton, Stanford, & 
Barratt, 1995), a self-report instrument of impulsivity. Most studies comparing individuals 
with OCD to healthy control subjects using the BIS-11 do not provide convincing support 
for elevated impulsivity in individuals with OCD (e.g., Benatti, Dell’Osso, Arici, Hollander, 
& Altamura, 2014; Boisseau et al., 2012). In these studies, neither motor nor non-planning 
impulsivity was associated with OCD, while attentional impulsiveness – characterized as 
difficulty focusing on the task at-hand – was. However, as noted by Boisseau et al. (2012), 
elevations in the BIS-11 attentional subscale within the context of OCS may reflect a 

1There is also an extensive literature looking at OCS in relation to task-based measures of impulsivity, including an extensive body of 
work considering response inhibition (see Abramovitch and Cooperman, 2015), which is often used as a proxy for impulsivity (Bari 
and Robbins, 2013). Given our explicit focus on perceived levels of impulsivity, including emotion-related impulsivity, it is beyond the 
scope of the current report to address this broader literature.

tendency to attend to and be distracted by obsessions, rather than ‘impulsivity’ as it is 
traditionally conceptualized. Abramovitch and McKay (2016) also provide a thorough 
discussion of how using such findings as evidence for behavioural impulsivity in OCD 
proves problematic.

A growing literature suggests that the construct of impulsivity should be revisited, however, 
and that historical accounts do not fully acknowledge the role emotion may play in 
driving impulsive behaviours (Cyders & Smith, 2008; Sharma, Markon, & Clark, 2014). 
Several newer theoretical models of impulsivity have directly addressed this consideration, 
noting that while some forms of impulsive behaviour reflect sensation-seeking, a lack 
of premeditation, or a lack of perseverance, other examples of impulsive behaviour 
occur within the context of strong emotions (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001). Within this 
conceptualization of impulsivity, an individual might act quite rationally and be highly 
controlled or considerate in ‘cold’ (i.e., non-emotional) situations, but may, in turn, become 
highly reactive when experiencing strong emotions. The response in the latter situation 
is considered ‘impulsive’, as it is quick, over-reactive, not well thought through, and 
possibly maladaptive. Emotion-related impulsivity has been associated with both positive 
and negative emotions, such that the experience of an intense emotion, regardless of valence, 
may contribute to a sense of urgency to act (Cyders et al., 2007; Whiteside & Lynam, 2001).

Carver and Johnson have extended this model to consider emotion-related impulsivity 
across behavioural and cognitive domains, taking into account approach and avoidance 
tendencies (Carver, Johnson, Joormann, Kim, & Nam, 2011; Johnson, Carver, & Joormann, 
2013). They theorize that individuals high in emotion-related impulsivity may lack 
sufficient top-down control to circumnavigate underlying motivational drives, which 
result in impulsive responses. Importantly, these motivational drives could prompt either 
behaviours or cognitions (e.g., rumination or passive avoidance). Conceptualized in this way, 
both behavioural and cognitive reactions exemplify impulsive responses, in that they are 
reflexive and characterized by a relative lack of consideration and/or control. Accumulating 
evidence indicates that emotion-related impulsivity operationalized in this way represents 
a vulnerability to the development of a wide range of psychopathologies (Carver, Johnson, 
& Timpano, 2017) and has been associated with internalizing conditions, including anxiety 
and depression (Carver, Johnson, & Joormann, 2013; Johnson et al., 2013; Johnson, Tharp, 
Peckham, Carver, & Haase, 2017).

Although emotion-related impulsivity seems to confer vulnerability to a variety of 
conditions, individuals may differ in what situations or stimuli elicit heightened emotion 
and thus trigger impulsive reactions. In the case of OCS, the tendency to assign meaning to 
thoughts and feel the need to control them (i.e., importance and control of thoughts; ICT; 
Obsessive Compulsive Cognitions Working Group [OCCWG], 2005) may result in marked 
distress to thought content that is hardly noticed by others. ICT has been consistently linked 
with OCD (Brakoulias et al., 2014; Wheaton, Abramowitz, Berman, Riemann, & Hale, 
2010) and is thought to increase the likelihood of compulsive rituals by increasing distress in 
response to intrusive thoughts (Salkovskis, 1985). ICT may therefore reflect an underlying 
motivation that elicits heightened distress, and which could interact synergistically with 
emotion-related impulsivity. An individual with elevated ICT and high levels of emotion-

related impulsivity may thus be particularly vulnerable to engaging in ritualistic behaviours 
that ultimately worsen OCS.

Only a few studies have looked at the relationship between emotion-related impulsivity 
and OCS. These studies have primarily examined negative urgency (Whiteside & Lynam, 
2001), which reflects a tendency to act rashly in response to intense negative affect. In a 
non-clinical sample, negative urgency was positively associated with multiple OCS domains, 
including repugnant obsessions (as assessed by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory – 
Revsied [OCIR] obsessing subscale; Foa et al., 2002), checking, and ordering (Zermatten 
& Van der Linden, 2008). More recent studies have corroborated these findings: Gay, 
Schmidt, and Van der Linden (2011) used a student sample to investigate how intrusive 
thoughts related to facets of impulsivity. They demonstrated that repugnant obsessions 
(OCIR obsessing subscale) were uniquely associated with greater negative urgency. 
Similarly, Cougle, Timpano, and Goetz (2012) and Macatee et al. (2016) found that greater 
negative urgency was linked to greater repugnant obsessions, but not other OCD symptom 
domains, in both large non-clinical student (using the Vancouver Obsessional Compulsive 
Inventory obsessions subscale; Thordarson et al., 2004) and community samples (using 
the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [DOCS] unacceptable thoughts subscale; 
Abramowitz et al., 2010), respectively.

What remains unclear from this literature is whether OCS is associated with more 
behavioural or cognitive domains of emotion-related impulsivity (Carver et al., 2017). 
Furthermore, past studies are limited by an exclusive reliance on self-report global 
assessments of OCS. As self-report measures of OCS do not always align with other 
forms of assessment (Federici et al., 2010), a comprehensive and more ecologically valid 
evaluation of OCS should be considered. Finally, it remains unclear whether emotion-related 
impulsivity functions as an independent vulnerability for OCS, or whether it may moderate 
the association between OCS and other established risk factors that heighten emotional 
responses to common OCD triggers. We hypothesize that either cognitive or behavioural 
reflexive reactions to strong emotions (i.e., emotion-related impulsivity) could exacerbate 
associations between OCS and OCD-specific cognitive factors, like ICT.

The overarching aim of the present investigation was to consider the link between OCS 
and emotion-related impulsivity using a multi-study, multi-method framework. In Study 1, 
we investigated the relationship between OCS and emotion-related impulsivity in a large, 
non-selected internet-based community sample recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical 
Turk (MTurk; Mason & Suri, 2012; Paolacci & Chandler, 2014). MTurk participants have 
been found to have elevated levels of psychopathology compared to national samples 
(Arditte, Çek, Shaw, & Timpano, 2016) and are therefore appropriate for testing our 
hypotheses. We extended the extant literature by considering emotion-related impulsivity 
using the framework outlined by Carver and Johnson. No study to-date, to the best 
of our knowledge, has examined the association between impulsivity and OCS using 
this framework. We investigated the association between both behavioural and cognitive 
emotion-related impulsivity and self-reported OCS using a measure that captures features 
of OCD across four core symptom domains. We hypothesized that elevated emotion-related 
impulsivity across both the cognitive and behavioural domains would be associated with

greater OCS severity. More specifically, we hypothesized that the unacceptable thoughts 
OCS domain would be most strongly linked with emotion-related impulsivity given its 
previously established tie to negative urgency (e.g., Macatee et al., 2016).

Study 2 aimed to extend previous self-report studies by considering a multi-modal 
assessment of OCS. We investigated a sample of young adults who were over-sampled 
for elevated OCS. This approach ensured sufficient representation of clinical and subclinical 
symptom levels to more fully capture the dimensional distribution of OCS (Olatunji et 
al., 2008). Our multi-modal assessment of OCS included self-report, to replicate findings 
from Study 1, and a clinical interview that ascertains global severity of obsessions and 
compulsions. We hypothesized that emotion-related impulsivity would be consistently 
associated with OCS, but that cognitive reactivity to emotion would be associated with 
greater obsession severity, whereas behavioural reactivity to emotion would be associated 
with compulsions. Participants were also randomized to one of two symptom provocation 
paradigms – an unacceptable thoughts provocation and a contamination/washing task – 
to establish both in-the-moment distress and urge to ritualize for two different types 
of symptoms. We predicted that greater cognitive emotion-related impulsivity would be 
associated with greater distress in response to the assigned task and that behavioural 
emotion-based impulsivity would be associated with stronger urges to ritualize. We 
selected a repugnant thoughts symptom provocation task because the unacceptable thoughts 
dimension has been associated with emotion-related impulsivity (e.g., Macatee et al., 2016) 
and also involves a more cognitively focused response (e.g., mental neutralizing). We 
then selected a contamination symptom provocation task because contamination/washing 
symptoms are one of the most commonly experienced forms of OCS (Rachman & Hodgson, 
1980), and the compulsive response is characterized by overt behaviours.

A final aim of Study 2 was to consider whether emotion-related impulsivity acts 
synergistically with a core vulnerability for OCD. Specifically, we considered the degree to 
which participants exhibited ICT and examined whether emotion-related impulsivity would 
interact with ICT in predicting interview-assessed OCS. We hypothesized that those who 
endorsed greater emotion-related impulsivity would exhibit greater OCS when they also 
endorsed elevated dysfunctional beliefs about thoughts.

Method

Study 1 Participants and Procedure

A large community-based participant group (N = 547) was recruited through Amazon’s 
MTurk. The study was advertised on MTurk as trying to understand the relationship between 
emotions and behaviours. Interested participants completed a battery of questionnaires 
online. Procedures were approved by an institutional review board, and informed consent 
was obtained from participants online before they completed the survey, which took 
approximately 30 min. Participants were compensated $4.50 for their participation, in line 
with standard MTurk practices (Horton & Chilton, 2010).

Recommended data cleaning procedures were used (e.g., Arditte et al., 2016; Behrend, 
Sharek, Meade, & Wiebe, 2011). Participants who did not finish the survey or did so in less

than 60% of the expected completion time (n = 132) were excluded, along with participants 
who failed to correctly answer 80% of attention checks embedded in the survey (n = 29). 
The final sample (N = 386) was 50% female, 76.2% Caucasian/White, 13.5% Asian/Asian 
American, 6.7% African American, 0.5% Native American, 0.3% Native Hawaiian/Other 
Pacific Islander, and 2.8% Other; 7% were Hispanic or Latino. Average age was 36.2 years 
(SD = 12.0, range = 19–73).

Study 2 Participants and Procedure

A sample of young adults (N = 107) was recruited from an undergraduate Introductory 
Psychology participant pool. The sample was over-selected for elevated OCS, as assessed 
via the obsessing subscale of the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory – Revised (OCIR). This 
subscale was selected as a screening tool, rather than the total score, because it has been 
shown to more readily differentiate those with OCD from non-anxious controls (Foa et al., 
2002). Furthermore, two of the six subscales contributing to the total score (neutralizing 
and hoarding) have demonstrated considerable psychometric and conceptual limitations 
(Abramowitz & Deacon, 2006; Hajcak, Huppert, Simons, & Foa, 2004). Approximately 
68% of the sample met or exceeded the OCIR obsessing cut score of 4. Participants 
were 58% female, 64.5% White/Caucasian, 17.8% Asian or Pacific Islander, 8.4% African 
American, 0.9% American Indian, and 8.4% Other; 24.3% were Hispanic or Latino. Average 
age was 19.0 years (SD = 1.2, range = 17–25).

Eligible participants were invited into the laboratory to first complete questionnaires and 
a clinician-administered structured interview. As part of a larger investigation, participants 
were then randomized into a mindful attention or control training condition, after which 
participants were further randomized into one of two symptom provocation conditions (see 
below). As training condition was not central to the current study’s aims and hypotheses 
and was furthermore not associated with any of the outcome variables considered in the 
current report, we collapsed the sample across training conditions. We controlled for training 
condition for the analyses using the symptom provocation tasks, as these were collected 
after training. Participants received research familiarization credit and $2 for completing the 
study. All procedures were approved by an institutional review board. Informed consent was 
obtained from each participant prior to participation.

Study 1 Measures

Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS)—The DOCS (Abramowitz et 
al., 2010) is a 20-item self-report measure of OCS across four subscales: contamination, 
harm/checking, unacceptable thoughts, and symmetry. Within each domain, severity is 
determined via five items: avoidance, distress, interference, time, and degree of control. 
Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 scale, with higher scores representing greater severity. 
The DOCS has exhibited good to excellent internal consistency for each subscale, as 
well as strong evidence for convergent and discriminant validity (Abramowitz et al., 2010; 
Thibodeau, Leonard, Abramowitz, & Riemann, 2015).

Three-Factor Impulsivity Index (TFII)—The TFII (Carver et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 
2013) is a 44-item self-report measure of impulsivity. The TFII yields three subscales, two

that reflect emotion-related impulsivity – Pervasive Influence of Feelings (i.e., cognitive 
impulsivity; ‘I am easily overwhelmed by feelings I have’) and Feelings Trigger Action (i.e., 
behavioural impulsivity; ‘It is hard for me to resist acting on my feelings’) – and one that 
does not – Lack of Follow Through (‘I tend to give up easily’). Participants rated the degree 
to which each item described them and their reactions on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This measure has exhibited good to excellent 
internal consistency for each subscale (Johnson et al., 2013, 2017).

Study 2 Measures

Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory – Revised (OCIR)—The OCIR (Foa et al., 2002) 
is an 18-item questionnaire used to assess OCS. Participants respond using a 5-point Likert 
scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). In the present study, only the three-item 
obsessing subscale was used to screen potential participants.

Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS)—See Study 1.

Three-Factor Impulsivity Index (TFII)—See Study 1.

Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)—The Y-BOCS (Goodman, 
Price, Rasmussen, Mazure, Fleischmann, et al., 1989) is a 10-question interview-based 
measure that separately assesses the severity of obsessions and compulsions. Items are rated 
on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher scores reflecting greater severity of symptoms. The Y-BOCS 
has demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability, acceptable to good internal consistency, and 
moderate convergent validity (Goodman, Price, Rasmussen, Mazure, Delgado, et al., 1989; 
Woody, Steketee, & Chambless, 1995). While most frequently used with clinical samples, 
prior work suggests that the Y-BOCS is appropriate for use with non-clinical participants 
(Frost, Steketee, Krause, & Trepanier, 1995) and that it demonstrates excellent reliability in 
these samples (López-Pina et al., 2015).

Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire – 44 (OBQ-44)—The OBQ-44 (OCCWG, 2005) 
is a 44-item self-report measure of dysfunctional assumptions about thoughts believed 
to be important to the development of OCD (OCCWG, 2001, 2005). The ICT (e.g., ‘I 
should be able to rid my mind of unwanted thoughts’) subscale was used in the present 
study. Using a 7-point Likert scale, participants rated whether each item was typical of 
their way of looking at things most of the time, from 0 (disagree very much) to 7 (agree 
very much). The OBQ-44 has demonstrated good internal consistency and criterion-related 
validity (OCCWG, 2005).

Study 2 Symptom Provocation Tasks

Participants completed either a repugnant thoughts or contamination task intended to evoke 
distress and an urge to ritualize. Although the tasks differed in how they elicited these 
responses, both distress and urge strength were assessed in the same manner for each 
task. After task completion, participants rated their distress and urge to ritualize on visual 
analogue scales ranging from 0 (not distressed/not strong) to 100 (very distressed/very 
strong).

The repugnant thoughts task was a modified version of a standard thought–action–fusion 
paradigm (Bocci & Gordon, 2007; Rachman, Shafran, Mitchell, Trant, & Teachman, 1996). 
Participants were asked to identify an individual they care about and to then write the 
name of that individual in the following sentence: ‘I hope is in a car accident today’. The 
participant was directed to visualize the written scene for 30 seconds, after which they 
provided their ratings.

The contamination task was a modified version of a behavioural task described by Najmi, 
Tobin, and Amir (2012). Participants were shown an open toilet made to look dirty using soil 
and food colouring and were told that this toilet was obtained from a construction site. They 
were then asked to progressively touch parts of the toilet using tissues, starting with the top 
of the water tank, followed by the handle, tank sides, and toilet seat. Afterwards, participants 
provided their ratings.

All data were screened for normality (i.e., skewness < |2| and kurtosis < |2|) and determined 
to be well within acceptable limits. We further examined the data for influential outliers 
prior to analysis. Participants were flagged as outliers if their standardized residual values 
were ≥ |2|, but only those deemed influential (i.e., standardized DFBETA values MATH 
were excluded from further analyses (see Pedhazur, 1997). 15 participants from Study 1 and 
6 from Study 2 were excluded.

Means and standard deviations for key variables are shown in Table 1. DOCS total score 
ranges (Study 1: 0–43; Study 2: 0–34) indicated that both samples captured a suitable 
range of OCD symptoms, reflecting non-clinical, subclinical, and clinical symptom levels. 
Approximately 21% of the community sample and 18% of the young adult sample met 
or exceeded the clinical cut-off (DOCS total score ≥18; Abramowitz et al., 2010). In the 
young adult sample, Y-BOCS total scores ranged from 0 to 25. Approximately 34% of the 
sample endorsed mild, yet clinically significant levels of OCS, and 10% met or exceeded the 
Y-BOCS clinical cut-off (total score ≥16). 10% also met full diagnostic criteria for OCD as 
assessed by structured clinical interview.

Association between impulsivity and OCS—We first examined basic associations 
through a series of partial correlations between the three TFII factors and the DOCS 
subscales (Table 1), while controlling for age and gender. These covariates were selected 
because participants in Study 1 and Study 2 were not matched on these variables and 
they have been associated with OCS severity (Cath, Nizar, Boomsma, & Mathews, 2017) 
and symptom expression (Labad et al., 2008) in prior research. The two emotion-related 
impulsivity factors were significantly correlated with all DOCS subscales, such that greater 
emotion-related impulsivity was associated with greater severity of symptoms. Lack of 
Follow Through, the non-emotion-related impulsivity factor, was only correlated with harm/
checking and unacceptable thoughts DOCS subscales.

Study 2

To examine whether OCS was uniquely associated with each of the impulsivity factors, we 
next conducted a series of multiple regression analyses with each of the DOCS subscales 
as dependent variables. Covariates, as noted above, were simultaneously entered in Step 1 
of the model followed by the three impulsivity factors in Step 2. Results for Step 2 of each 
model are summarized in Table 2. Feelings Trigger Action (i.e., behavioural emotion-related 
impulsivity) was consistently associated with nearly all OCS domains (i.e., contamination, 
unacceptable thoughts, and symmetry). The only exception was harm/checking, which was 
positively associated with Pervasive Influence of Feelings (i.e., cognitive emotion-related 
impulsivity) instead. Pervasive Influence of Feelings was further significantly associated 
with unacceptable thoughts and symmetry. Lack of Follow Through was significantly 
associated with only DOCS symmetry, such that greater difficulty following through with 
tasks was associated with fewer symmetry symptoms.

Association between impulsivity and OCS—Using our young adult sample, we 
first repeated our Study 1 analyses. Correlation results (Table 1) generally mirrored those 
for Study 1. Both Pervasive Influence of Feelings and Feelings Trigger Action were 
correlated with all OCS domains, with the exception that the association between Pervasive 
Influence of Feelings and contamination was not significant. In contrast to Study 1, Lack of 
Follow Through was associated with unacceptable thoughts, albeit inversely. In subsequent 
regression analyses (Table 2), Feelings Trigger Action was the only impulsivity facet 
consistently and uniquely associated with all OCS domains. Higher levels of this emotion-
related impulsivity domain were associated with more severe symptoms.

We next considered the relationship between impulsivity and OCS as assessed via Y-BOCS. 
Controlling for age and gender, partial correlations revealed a similar pattern of results. The 
two emotion-related facets were significantly linked with OCS, whereas Lack of Follow 
Through was not associated with either obsessions or compulsions (p > .05). Obsession 
severity was positively correlated with both Pervasive Influence of Feelings (r = .46, p < .01) 
and Feelings Trigger Action (r = .30, p < .01), as was compulsion severity (r = .26, p < .01 
and r = .30, p < .01, respectively).

In a final set of analyses, Y-BOCS obsessions and compulsions were each simultaneously 
regressed onto the three impulsivity factors, controlling for age and gender. Pervasive 
Influence of Feelings remained a significant predictor of obsession severity (β = 0.37, t(96) 
= 3.58, p < .001), and Feelings Trigger Action was associated with compulsions (β = 0.23, 
t(96) = 2.05, p = .043).

Association between impulsivity and response to symptom provocation tasks
—We next examined whether the three impulsivity factors differentially predicted emotional 
and behavioural responses to the symptom provocation paradigms. As the symptom 
provocation tasks were completed after the training condition, partial correlations were 
conducted controlling for age, gender, and training condition. For the repugnant thoughts 
symptom provocation task (n = 51), none of the impulsivity factors were significantly linked 
with fear response (all p’s > .05). However, both Feelings Trigger Action (r = .37, p < .01)

and Pervasive Influence of Feelings (r = .31, p < .05) were significantly associated with 
greater urges to neutralize. Lack of Follow Through was not significantly associated with 
either outcome variable.

Considering the contamination symptom provocation paradigm (n = 50), both Feelings 
Trigger Action (r = .35, p < .05) and Pervasive Influence of Feelings (r = .28, p < .05) were 
significantly associated with disgust response. However, only Feelings Trigger Action (r = 
.38, p < .01) was correlated with greater urges to wash or sanitize. Again, Lack of Follow 
Through was not significantly associated with either outcome.

Interaction of impulsivity and ICT—Regression models were used to test whether 
emotion-related impulsivity would moderate the relationship between ICT and OCS (as 
captured by the Y-BOCS). Both the predictor (ICT) and the proposed moderator (either 
Pervasive Influence of Feelings or Feelings Trigger Action) were centred to minimize 
collinearity, prior to the generation of interaction terms (Holmbeck, 2002). Each respective 
outcome of interest was then simultaneously regressed on the predictor, moderator, and 
corresponding interaction term, while controlling for the other two impulsivity factors, 
gender, and age.

We observed significant interactions for both obsessions and compulsions: Feelings Trigger 
Action moderated the association between ICT and Y-BOCS obsessions (β = 0.31, t(95) 
= 3.20, p = .002) and Y-BOCS compulsions (β = 0.28, t(95) = 2.71, p = .008). Post 
hoc probing of simple slopes at one standard deviation above (High Feelings Trigger 
Action) and below (Low Feelings Trigger Action) the mean showed that when Feelings 
Trigger Action was elevated, ICT was significantly and positively associated with symptom 
severity as assessed by Y-BOCS obsessions (β = 0.28, t (95) = 2.82, p = .006) and 
Y-BOCS compulsions (β = 0.35, t(95) = 3.27, p = .001). At low levels of Feelings Trigger 
Action, these relationships were no longer significant. Results are depicted in Figure 1. 
Pervasive Influence of Feelings did not moderate the relationship between ICT and Y-BOCS 
obsessions or compulsions.

Discussion

This investigation sought to extend and clarify the relationship between impulsivity and 
OCS using a two-study design. Importantly, we explored the association between OCS and 
two forms of emotion-related impulsivity: cognitive and behavioural reactions to emotional 
triggers (Carver et al., 2011). We also used a multi-modal assessment of OCS, which 
included self-report, clinical interview, and symptom provocation measures. Across all 
analyses in both studies, factors reflecting impulsive responding in the context of strong 
emotion (i.e., emotion-related impulsivity) were consistently associated with OCS; notably 
a link between OCS and non-emotion-based impulsivity was not supported. These findings 
broadly align with those from prior studies (e.g., Cougle et al., 2012; Zermatten & Van 
der Linden, 2008), and point to the unique association between emotion-related impulsivity 
and OCS. This relationship has important implications for how we understand vulnerability 
for OCD, as well as its treatment, by highlighting the role of emotional context when 
considering symptom provocation in OCD. While an individual with OCS might act

rationally or risk-averse in non-emotional situations (Abramovitch & McKay, 2016), the 
same individual may have difficulty dismissing intrusive thoughts and resisting compulsive 
urges when experiencing strong emotions. Finally, our results suggest that emotion-related 
impulsivity interacts with ICT to result in greater OCS. This may be because ICT leads to 
heightened distress to intrusive thoughts, triggering the tendency to act impulsively in the 
context of strong emotion.

A key contribution of the present study is its use of the Carver and Johnson model of 
emotion-related impulsivity, in which impulsive cognitive and behavioural reactions to 
strong emotions, regardless of valence, are examined orthogonally (Carver et al., 2017). 
Analyses provided some support for specificity in the associations between OCS and these 
two facets of emotion-related impulsivity. In Study 2, Pervasive Influence of Feelings, 
which reflects cognitive reactivity to emotion, was associated with greater obsession 
severity, while Feelings Trigger Action, which reflects behavioural reactivity to emotion, 
was associated with greater compulsion severity. This result suggests that, regardless of 
symptom domain, both forms of emotion-related impulsivity play a role in perpetuating 
OCS. This places OCS in a unique position relative to other forms of psychopathology, 
which are typically associated with either cognitive reactivity to emotion (e.g., anxiety and 
depression symptoms) or behavioural reactivity (e.g., substance use, aggression; Johnson et 
al., 2017). It also suggests that both aspects may need to be addressed to effectively mitigate 
OCS.

The association between OCS and both forms of emotion-related impulsivity is particularly 
interesting when we consider previous reports examining the link between emotion-related 
impulsivity and anxiety. Many individuals with anxiety disorders regularly engage in safety 
behaviours related to their fears, much like individuals with OCD engage in compulsions 
in response to obsessions. Yet, as noted above, only cognitive emotion-related impulsivity 
has been linked to anxiety symptoms. Were future studies to specifically assess the use 
of anxiety-motivated safety behaviours, we might see a similar pattern to our findings: 
those with anxiety symptoms (e.g., panic, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety) and 
elevated safety behaviour use might endorse both cognitive and behavioural emotion-based 
impulsivity, like those with OCD. In this way, future research could explore whether some 
individuals with anxiety have emotion-related impulsivity profiles that resemble those seen 
in OCS, or whether OCS is truly unique in its association with both types of emotion-related 
impulsivity.

Some findings diverged from our hypotheses. First, we expected Pervasive Influence of 
Feelings, as an emotion-related impulsivity factor, to be associated with self-reported OCS 
across all symptom domains. Instead, after controlling for Feelings Trigger Action, this 
relationship largely fell away in both Study 1 and Study 2. Given that our self-report 
assessment did not distinguish between severity of obsessions and compulsions, but rather 
measured overall severity within a given symptom domain (e.g., contamination and harm/
checking), it may be that once obsessions and compulsions are assessed together, any 
unique relationship between Pervasive Influence of Feelings and OCS is masked. Second, 
in Study 2, we expected a clearer distinction to emerge for the symptom provocation 
tasks, with cognitive reactivity to emotion predicting distress (i.e., fear or disgust) in

response to symptom provocation and behavioural reactivity predicting strength of urge 
to ritualize. As hypothesized, Pervasive Influence of Feelings was tied to greater disgust 
in the contamination task; however, it was not predictive of fear in the repugnant thoughts 
paradigm. Instead, it was linked to urge to ritualize. Mental rituals like undoing a ‘bad’ 
thought, praying, or repeating certain words/phrases are often associated with the type 
of obsessions this task was designed to provoke (Sibrava, Boisseau, Mancebo, Eisen, & 
Rasmussen, 2011). These rituals can be performed quickly and covertly such that the 
experience of fear might be short-lived if the automatic use of mental rituals leads to 
immediate short-term fear reduction. This may be why we see an association between 
cognitive emotion-related impulsivity and the urge to ritualize post-task, rather than an 
association with the fear that prompts the urge. Feelings Trigger Action, in contrast, was 
associated with urge to ritualize in both tasks, which aligns with our results showing that 
this type of behavioural reactivity is associated with Y-BOCS compulsion severity. However, 
it was also predictive of greater disgust in the contamination task, an unanticipated result. 
Disgust is reliably associated with certain withdrawal/avoidance patterns developed to limit 
contact with potentially disease-causing stimuli (Olatunji & Sawchuk, 2005), which may 
explain why disgust was associated with behavioural, in addition to cognitive, reactivity to 
emotion.

Our final aim was to explore whether it is important to consider emotion-related impulsivity 
within the context of other established vulnerabilities for OCD. In Study 2, we found 
support for this hypothesis, noting that Feelings Trigger Action moderates the relationship 
between ICT and OCS. Specifically, greater ICT was associated with greater severity of both 
obsessions and compulsions, but only when emotion-related impulsivity was elevated. This 
aligns with past research suggesting that other measures of emotion-driven reactivity may 
interact with risk factors like distress intolerance to predict symptom severity (e.g., Cougle 
et al., 2012). Thus, we may see heightened vulnerability to OCS when emotion-related 
impulsivity exists in tandem with such risk factors. From a clinical perspective, this suggests 
that, in addition to identifying unhelpful beliefs like ICT, it may also be important to both 
evaluate and address emotion-related impulsivity in patients with OCD. Making the patient 
aware of a tendency to act rashly in response to strong emotions may help them plan for 
instances when they may be particularly susceptible to acting impulsively in response to a 
combination of emotional activation and unhelpful beliefs.

Limitations of the present study should be noted. First, we used a community-based sample 
(Study 1) and a sample of young adults (Study 2), and results will need to be replicated in 
a clinical sample. However, we derive confidence that such findings will parallel our own 
from the dimensional nature of OCD(Olatunji et al., 2008), and the fact that our samples 
included multiple individuals with subclinical and clinically significant OCS. A second 
limitation is our study’s cross-sectional nature. While our conceptualization of emotion-
related impulsivity presupposes that it is a trait-like feature that confers vulnerability to the 
development of disorders such as OCD, we cannot demonstrate that elevated emotion-based 
impulsivity precedes the onset of OCD symptoms without longitudinal assessment. We were 
able to demonstrate that pre-existing emotion-based impulsivity predicted greater distress 
and stronger urge to ritualize in response to symptom provocation, but further work is

needed to elucidate how emotion-related impulsivity relates to the development of specific 
symptom types and change in severity over time.

A growing body of work has linked emotion-related impulsivity to a variety of 
psychopathological symptoms (Johnson et al., 2013, 2017). Our findings add to this 
literature, by demonstrating the importance of considering the role of emotion when 
studying impulsivity in the context of OCD, and that emotion-related impulsivity may 
exacerbate the effect of other cognitive risk factors for OCS. Future research could 
examine the intersection of these findings with recent work suggesting that emotion-related 
impulsivity may actually reflect two parallel processes (Albertella et al., 2020). The first 
process reflects classically conceptualized impulsive behaviour that emerges from failures 
in top-down control following emotional disruption, while the second process, dubbed 
emotion-driven compulsivity, reflects distress-driven shifts from goal-directed behaviour to 
habit-driven behaviour (Albertella et al., 2020; van der Straten, van Leeuwen, Denys, van 
Marle, & van Wingen, 2020). Such precise identification of the mechanisms leading to 
OCS will advance our understanding of this important disorder and, hopefully, inform the 
development of targeted interventions.

Emotion-related impulsivity (ERI) reflects a tendency to act impulsively in 
the context of strong emotions.

ERI was associated with greater OCS across symptom domains and type of 
symptom assessment (self-report, interview, or symptom provocation).

ERI also interacted with an established OCS risk factor, a belief in the 
importance and control of thoughts, to predict symptom severity, suggesting 
that it may be important to evaluate and address ERI alongside unhelpful 
beliefs in patients with OCS.

Given the present study’s cross-sectional nature, we cannot draw conclusions 
about the directionality of the ERI – OCS relationship, and while our study 
included individuals with clinically elevated OCS, results should be replicated 
in a fully clinical sample.
