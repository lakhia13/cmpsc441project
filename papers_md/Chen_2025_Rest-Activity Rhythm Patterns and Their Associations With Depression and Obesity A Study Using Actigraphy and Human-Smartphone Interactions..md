Background: This study aimed to empirically derive subgroups based on both actigraphy- and app-measured rest–activity rhythm
(RAR) patterns and investigate the relationship between these proﬁles and health outcomes, including depression and obesity.
Methods: We developed a mobile app, Rhythm, to record human–smartphone interactions and calculate RAR patterns alongside
standard actigraphy in 135 participants (mean age: 43.8 Æ 12.3 years, 64% women) with and without major depressive disorder
and/or obesity. Wrist actigraphy and Rhythm app recorded activity data for at least 4 weeks, totaling 3978 person-days. Person-
centered clustering was conducted to identify subgroups based on RAR characteristics, and their associations with clinical out-
comes were evaluated using multivariable regression models.
Results: Three distinct groups with different RAR patterns were identiﬁed based on acrophase, interdaily stability (IS), and
intradaily variability (IV), measured by actigraphy and human–smartphone interactions, respectively. The “earlier” group exhib-
ited earlier acrophase both by actigraphy and the app and had lower depressive symptom severity than the other two groups. The
“later” group showed a later acrophase and a lower body mass index (BMI) compared to the “earlier” group. The “irregular” group,
characterized by higher IV, lower IS, and desynchronized actigraphy- and app-measured acrophase, was associated with higher
levels of depressive symptom severity and BMI.
Conclusions: Our study highlights the usefulness of human–smartphone interaction patterns in providing a comprehensive
understanding of individuals’ circadian rhythms beyond standard actigraphy measurements. Identifying distinct RAR proﬁles
based on both actigraphy and app measurements contributes to a better understanding of the associations between circadian
disruptions and mental and physical health outcomes.

1. Introduction

Human beings are inherently attuned to a diurnal lifestyle,
traditionally characterized by wakefulness during daylight

and restfulness at night. This natural rhythm, integral to
human evolution, plays a critical role in maintaining both
mental and physical well-being. However, modern lifestyles

2

Depression and Anxiety

have led to signiﬁcant disruptions in this 24-h cycle, known as
rest–activity rhythms (RARs), with profound implications for
health. Such disruptions are increasingly linked to a spectrum
of conditions, ranging from mood disorders to metabolic dis-
eases [1]. Traditionally, RARs have been assessed through acti-
graphy, a method that tracks physical activity continuously
over time to infer sleep–wake patterns [2]. Yet, this approach
captures only a facet of the intricate tapestry of human beha-
viors that inﬂuence circadian rhythms. The advent of digital
technologies offers an unprecedented opportunity to enrich
our understanding of RARs by incorporating data derived
from human interactions with smartphones and other digital
devices. These digital footprints, akin to physical activity
records, provide supplementary information that extends
beyond traditional actigraphy, offering a more nuanced view
of daily rhythms. This research endeavors to explore this novel
paradigm by integrating traditional actigraphy with patterns of
human–smartphone interactions, positing that such an amal-
gamation could unveil deeper insights into mental health
through the lens of RARs. By embracing this comprehensive
approach, we aim to capture the complexities of circadian
rhythms more effectively, thereby enhancing our understand-
ing of their impact on both mental and physical health.

Since the pioneering work of Witting et al. [3] in 1990,
which established a framework for analyzing RARs through
key quantiﬁable parameters such as interdaily stability (IS)
and intradaily variability (IV) and applied these insights to
study aging and Alzheimer’s disease, the scientiﬁc community’s
interest in the role of RARs in neurodegenerative disorders has
expanded signiﬁcantly. This foundational study paved the way
for subsequent research exploring the intricate relationship
between RAR patterns and various aspects of mental and phys-
ical health. For example, Nguyen Ho et al. [4] found that higher
fragmentation of 24-h activity rhythms is linked to increased
amyloid-beta pathology in APOE4 carriers, Leng et al. [5]
associated reduced circadian rhythmicity with an increased
risk of Parkinson’s disease, and Smagula et al. [6] connected
irregular RARs with elevated depression symptoms and cogni-
tive declines in aging populations [4–6]. These studies collec-
tively highlight the profound impact of circadian disturbances
across a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. Building
upon the groundwork laid by Witting et al. [3], the scope of
RAR research has broadened to encompass mood disorders
such as major depressive disorder [6–12] and bipolar disorders
[13–17], marking a signiﬁcant trend in contemporary studies.
In addition to neuropsychiatric disorders, the application of
RAR analysis has been extended to examine its connection
with obesity, both in community and clinical settings
[18–22]. Despite these efforts, the behavioral mechanisms link-
ing obesity and depression through RARs remain elusive,
underscoring a gap in our understanding. This gap is particu-
larly notable given the accumulating evidence that RAR char-
acteristics are closely associated with both obesity and
depression, indicating a shared pathway that warrants further
investigation. Moreover, recent research has employed cluster-
ing techniques to identify subgroups within populations based
on common RAR proﬁles, exploring the diverse mental health
outcomes across these clusters. This approach has revealed the

complex inﬂuence of circadian rhythms on health, suggesting
that the effects of RARs are multifaceted and cannot be fully
captured by a singular measure [6]. These developments
underscore the need for continued research to decode the
nuanced relationships between RARs, mental illness, and met-
abolic disease, offering promising avenues for understanding
and potentially mitigating the impacts of these conditions.

In recent years, the explosion of digital footprints, especially
through human–smartphone interactions, has opened new
avenues in the study of circadian rhythms [23, 24]. Beyond
traditional actigraphy, which primarily captures physical activ-
ity, smartphone data offer insights into social rhythms, cogni-
tive engagement, and the physiological impacts of screen
exposure [13–17, 25, 26]. Despite their potential, the full impact
of these interactions on circadian rhythm metrics like acro-
phase, IS, and IV is yet to be fully explored [27]. Incorporating
human–smartphone interaction patterns into RAR measures
might provide a more clinically meaningful approach to under-
standing an individual’s circadian rhythm in the modern era, as
real-time, passively collected data from these interactions can
potentially offer an alternative to actigraphy for determining
chronotype and RAR indicators [23, 24]. Incorporating
human–smartphone interaction patterns into RAR measures
can provide a more clinically meaningful approach to under-
standing an individual’s circadian rhythm in the modern era, as
real-time, passively collected data from these interactions can
potentially offer an alternative to actigraphy for determining
chronotype and RAR indicators.

Our study aimed to address gaps in knowledge related to
circadian rhythm disruption and its impact on mental and
physical health outcomes. Speciﬁcally, we aimed to empirically
derive subgroups of individuals with similar RAR proﬁles,
which were measured by both standard actigraphy and
human–smartphone interaction patterns. We would then char-
acterize the mental and physical health of these subgroups
across multiple symptom dimensions. We hypothesized that
using both standard actigraphy and human–smartphone inter-
action patterns to calculate RAR would provide a more com-
prehensive understanding of circadian rhythm disruption than
focusing solely on physical activity measured by standard
actigraphy.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Study Population. A total of 135 participants (mean age:
43.8 Æ 12.3 years, 64% women) were recruited from three psy-
chiatric outpatient clinics, an obesity outpatient clinic, and a
workplace health promotion program at seven hospitals in
northern Taiwan for the study period between September
2021 and February 2023. Our study sample included indivi-
duals with a history of DSM-5-deﬁned major depressive disor-
der who were followed in psychiatric clinics and were under
continuous pharmacological treatment, individuals with obe-
sity who were participating in an obesity outpatient clinic, and
health-care professionals who were enrolled in the workplace
health promotion program. Speciﬁcally, there were 44 obese
participants (body mass index [BMI] ≧ 27), 46 participants
diagnosed with major depressive disorder by psychiatrists,

Depression and Anxiety

3

and 11 participants diagnosed with both major depressive dis-
order and obesity (BMI≧27). Additionally, 34 participants
served as healthy controls, as they had neither major depressive
disorder nor obesity. This diverse sample enabled us to exam-
ine the associations between RAR proﬁles and major depressive
disorder, obesity, and their comorbid conditions, as well as to
capture behaviors that explained variance in mental and physi-
cal health distinct from sleep.

∗

In determining our sample size, our study focuses on com-
paring the clinical outcomes of various RAR patterns, particu-
larly depressive symptoms and obesity. Anticipating three to
four RAR pattern groups corresponding to these clinical out-
Power
comes, we conducted a sample size analysis using G
software [28]. Employing an F-test within a ﬁxed effect, omni-
bus, one-way ANOVA model, we set an alpha error probability
of 0.05 and a statistical power of 0.80. With an effect size of 0.3
expected for the three to four groups, the corresponding total
sample size ranged from 111 to 128 participants. Additionally,
we referenced a study [27] that involved 33 insomnia patients
and 33 healthy controls, informing our sample size estimation.
Our sample size of 135 participants not only surpasses this
reference but also ensures robust statistical power for analyzing
complex relationships within our data. Furthermore, the inclu-
sion of 34 healthy controls in this study exceeds previous con-
trol group sizes. This larger sample size facilitates a nuanced
examination of clinical correlations, incorporating ﬁve inde-
pendent variables (RAR groups, diagnosis, age, gender, and
sleep indicators or physical activity level) in line with the
“one in ten rule” for regression analysis, thus justifying our
sample size selection. Speciﬁcally, our sample size exceeds the
minimum requirement of 50 participants for regression
analysis.

All participants provided written informed consent before
taking part in the study. They were asked to install the Rhythm
app and wear a wrist actigraphy device for a minimum of
4 weeks, resulting in a total of 3978 person-days of data collec-
tion. Only participants with Android-operating smartphones
were eligible to participate, with the condition that their phones
were to be exclusively used by them during the study period.
While participants were instructed to wear their actigraphy
devices continuously, there was no speciﬁc guidance on the
placement of their smartphones. The study was approved by
the Institutional Review Boards of the National Taiwan Univer-
sity Hospital (IRB No. 202004005RIND), Tri-Service General
Hospital (IRB No. B202205050), and the Chang-Gung Memo-
rial Hospital (IRB No. 202002452A3 and 202100434B0A3) and
was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined
in the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.2. Clinical Outcomes

2.2.1. Depressive Symptoms. The Patient Health Question-
naire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used, self-administered instrument
for detecting depressive symptoms. For each of the nine depres-
sive symptom criteria, subjects indicate the extent to which the
symptoms bother them using options like “not at all,” “several
days,” “more than half the days,” or “nearly every day.” Each
′
s
criterion yields a score between 0 and 3, such that the PHQ-9
total score ranges from 0 to 27. A PHQ-9 score of 10 or greater

has a sensitivity of 93% and a speciﬁcity of 88% for the diagno-
sis of major depressive disorder [29]. The diagnostic validity of
the Chinese version of PHQ-9 is comparable with clinician-
administered [30]. In this study, PHQ-9 data were collected at
baseline, week 2, and week 4 of the study period. We found no
signiﬁcant differences between these time points.

2.2.2. Weight Status. All participants had their weight (in kilo-
grams) and height (in centimeters) measured without shoes,
following standard protocols. The BMI was calculated by divid-
ing the body weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body
height (in meters), resulting in the unit of kg/m2. The BMI
categories used were overweight, deﬁned as a BMI between
24.0 and 26.9 kg/m2, and obesity, deﬁned as a BMI equaled
to or greater than 27.0 kg/m2 [31]. BMI measurements were
taken at the beginning of the study period.

2.3. Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Measures: The Use of

Mobile App “Rhythm” and Actigraphy

2.3.1. Actigraphy, Physical Activity, and Sleep Indicators. The
participants were instructed to wear a research-grade wrist
actigraphy device (MiCorTM A100, MiTAC Inc. Taiwan) on
their nondominant wrist for a minimum of 4 weeks. The ratio-
nale for requiring a minimum of 4 weeks to use the app and
wrist actigraphy device was based on our ﬁndings that a 28-day
measurement period was more effective than the commonly
used 7-day period in capturing the link between disrupted
circadian rhythms and adiposity [32]. Our app tracked both
circadian and social rhythms, and a single 7-day period often
failed to fully capture the variability in social rhythms, such as
the transition between workdays and weekends, due to individ-
ual differences in sleep patterns and behavior. For instance, an
individual could have experienced insufﬁcient sleep during the
weekdays of the ﬁrst week and compensated by sleeping longer
on the weekend, whereas the same individual might have
exhibited normal sleep patterns during the second week. This
demonstrated how a single 7-day period could have led to
inconsistencies and insufﬁcient data. By tracking the 7-day
cycle over 28 days, encompassing three or more cycles, our
study provided a more comprehensive and stable assessment
of social rhythms. Additionally, human biological rhythms,
such as the 28-day menstrual cycle, could have affected weight
and body composition, further underscoring the importance of
a 28-day measurement period for a holistic evaluation of circa-
dian and biological rhythms and their relationship to adiposity
[32, 33].

This device collected data on acceleration across three axes,
with an internal sampling rate of 30 Hz. Before being aggre-
gated into epochs, the acceleration data were processed to cal-
culate the Euclidean distance, which represents the magnitude
of deviation from a zero point. The data were then bandpass
ﬁltered from 0.5 to 3 Hz, and zero values above a predeﬁned
threshold were integrated within 2 s. From there, activity
counts were derived by averaging the integrated segments
over 1 min [2, 34].

The physical activity level of each participant was quanti-
ﬁed by using an accelerometer to measure their daily move-
ments. Key features were calculated for each day, including the

4

Depression and Anxiety

M10 and L5 values. The M10 and L5 represented the 10 h of the
day when the participant was most active and the 5 h when they
were least active, respectively. These are widely recognized
indicators of a person’s circadian activity patterns [35, 36].
To determine the M10, a 10-h moving average was used to
estimate the period of the day with the highest average acceler-
ation, which was considered to be the participant’s overall
physical activity level.

To determine the sleep and wake times, the standard
Cole–Kripke algorithm [34] was applied to the activity count
data with slight modiﬁcations. The algorithm categorized data
into rest and active states based on a weighted sum of the
current minute and contiguous minutes to minimize the
impact of sudden changes in activity levels that could compro-
mise the categorization. Sleep onset was deﬁned as a period of
20 consecutive epochs with zero acti-count, while wake time
was deﬁned as a period of 8 consecutive epochs with non-zero
acti-count. The daily sleep indicators included sleep onset,
wake time, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep
time (TST). The algorithm was run on MATLAB software
(MathWorks, Natick, USA) and used pre-existing codes.

2.3.2. Human–Smartphone Interaction Patterns. The app,
Rhythm, was designed to collect data on smartphone usage
by tracking three key variables: screen on/off events, notiﬁca-
tions, and the app being used [24, 37]. The data were collected
in the background without interfering with the smartphone
operation or affecting battery life (less than 1%). We developed
an innovative approach to analyze human–smartphone inter-
action patterns as a proxy for activity levels, mirroring the
methodology typically employed in wrist actigraphy. This
involved deﬁning each instance of smartphone use from the
moment the screen was turned on until it was subsequently
turned off as a single episode. We then measured the intensity
of smartphone interaction by counting the number of app uses
per minute. To address the sporadic nature of smartphone use
and reduce the prevalence of periods with zero counts, we
aggregated these counts into 5-min epochs. This adjustment
provided a more stable and meaningful measure of smartphone
activity levels in our previous studies [27, 32]. To interpret these
data within the context of circadian rhythms, we employed a
single-component single cosinor model. This model is particu-
larly suited for analyzing phenomena that exhibit regular, pre-
dictable cycles, such as the 24-h circadian rhythm inherent in
human physiology. By ﬁtting the model to the time series of
app counts, we were able to delineate the active and inactive
phases of participants’ daily routines. The active phase was
characterized by higher app counts, peaking at the acrophase,
while the inactive phase, indicative of potential sleep periods,
was identiﬁed by a signiﬁcant drop in app usage, reaching its
lowest point at the nadir. By quantifying human–smartphone
interactions in this manner and mapping them onto a near-24-
h cycle, we effectively mimicked the actigraphy-derived activity
data, allowing us to estimate the circadian rhythm of smart-
phone users.

2.3.3. RAR Measures. We used parametric cosinor analysis and
nonparametric method to calculate circadian rhythm indica-
tors based on the 4-week dataset of app-counts or acti-counts

(Figure 1). To quantify the rhythm of activity or app usage data,
we further used the hourly averaged acti-counts and app-
counts and ﬁtted by a “cosinor analysis” with a 24-h sinusoidal
function, αðtÞ: ¼ M þ Acosð2π × t−φ
Þ : þ ε, in which “M” was
the midline estimated statistic of rhythm (MESOR), “φ” was
the acrophase (the time of the peak activity of the 24-h rhythm)
and ε was the unexplained residual. The “A” represented coef-
ﬁcients of the 24-h of the cosinor ﬁtted model and was used to
estimate the amplitude of the daily rhythm (the difference
between peak amplitude and MESOR).

24

A nonparametric method was used to calculate the circa-
dian rhythm indicators IS and IV [3]. IS quantiﬁed the
rhythm’s stability between days, that is, the coupling strength
of the rhythm to the supposedly stable environmental factors. It
could vary between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating more
stable daily rhythms.

This study used both the aforementioned nonparametric
indicators and one cosinor analysis indicator, the acrophase. In
cosinor-based rhythmometry, which includes the MESOR (a
rhythm-adjusted mean), amplitude (a measure of half the
extent of predictable variation within a cycle), and acrophase
(a measure of the time of overall high values recurring in each
cycle), only the acrophase has the unit of time and is compara-
ble with the app-deﬁned and actigraphy indicators. Meanwhile,
the unit of the MESOR and amplitude are app-counts or acti-
counts, so MESORapp and MESORact are not comparable. In
addition, we did not use the relative amplitude in the nonpara-
metric method because the relative amplitude is the ratio of the
differences between the most active 10 continuous hours (M10)
and the least active 5 continuous hours (L5) over the summa-
tion of M10 and L5. However, the L5 measured by
human–smartphone interaction patterns was almost always
0, unlike physical activity where there is still a weak signal
during L5. Therefore, the relative amplitude measured by the
app was almost always very close to 1 in all individuals and
could not be used as a parameter to distinguish between
groups.

2.4. Statistical Analysis. We conducted person-centered clus-
tering using ﬁnite normal mixture modeling, ﬁt with the
expectation-maximization algorithm, implemented using the
R Software package“ MClust” [38]. The RAR variables, mea-
sured via both actigraphy and mobile app, described above
were entered, and we considered models that had different
numbers of groups and covariance structures. We used the

Bayesian Information Criterion to select the optimal model but
speciﬁed a priori that we would reject solutions that included
groups composed of <10% of the sample. Using the optimal
model identiﬁed with Bayesian Information Criterion, for
descriptive purposes, we evaluated how the derived groups
differed in terms of their average RAR measures.

We analyzed continuous variables, such as age and BMI,
using one-way ANOVA and Scheffe post hoc analysis, while
categorical variables, like gender, were assessed with the Chi-
square test. Our investigation then focused on discerning dif-
ferences in PHQ-9 scores and BMI among the RAR groups,
employing one-way ANOVA. We only proceeded with multi-
variable analysis for clinical outcomes that demonstrated sig-
niﬁcant differences (p <0:05) across the RAR groups. This
approach aimed to control for potential confounders, including
variations in sleep and activity levels, as well as demographic
factors like age and gender, ensuring a more accurate interpre-
tation of the data.

We utilized multivariable regression models to examine the
impact of physical activity level (M10) and speciﬁc night-time
sleep parameters (WASO and TST) on the relationship
between the RAR group and clinical outcomes, such as BMI
and PHQ-9 scores. Age, gender, and diagnosis were consis-
tently adjusted for in all models. Additionally, our base models
were adjusted to incorporate diagnostic information, thus con-
sidering additional dimensions beyond the outcome variable.
For instance, when analyzing depressive symptom scores as the

outcome/dependent variable, we included BMI as an indepen-
dent variable; conversely, when BMI was the outcome/depen-
dent variable, depressive symptom scores (PHQ-9) were
incorporated as an independent variable. To facilitate compar-
ative analyses between groups, these regression models were
applied, utilizing the irregular group as the reference, to sys-
tematically compare the later and earlier groups and elucidate
their differential effects on the aforementioned clinical
outcomes.

3. Results

The Bayesian Information Criterion indicated that the optimal
solution consisted of three groups with ellipsoidal, equal vol-
ume, and orientation. These groups, derived from the solution,
exhibited signiﬁcant differences in average RAR characteristics,
as depicted in Figure 2 and Table 1. The clustering methodol-
ogy aimed to maximize mean differences across empirically
derived groups. Table 1 illustrates how participants were
grouped based on their RAR proﬁles, assessed through both
actigraphy and human–smartphone interactions using six
parameters. The optimal solution from the clustering approach
resulted in three distinct groups characterized by their
morningness-eveningness proﬁles, deﬁned by acrophase, and
the extent of circadian rhythm disruption, deﬁned by IS and IV.
These three groups were labeled as “earlier” (n = 58), “later”
(n = 47), and “irregular” (n = 30), respectively.

At that point, we reexamined whether the results truly repre-
sented distinct RAR phenotypes across diagnoses or if they effec-
tively differentiated between patients with obesity, major
depressive disorder, and healthy controls. Among the 44 parti-
cipants with obesity, the earlier, later, and irregular RAR pattern
groups comprised 26, 6, and 12 individuals, respectively. In the
group of 46 participants with major depressive disorder, the
earlier, later, and irregular RAR pattern groups included 10,
27, and 9 individuals, respectively. Among the 11 participants
with both obesity and major depressive disorder, the earlier,
later, and irregular RAR pattern groups consisted of 3, 6, and
12 individuals, respectively. Within the 34 healthy controls, the
earlier, later, and irregular RAR pattern groups encompassed 19,
8, and 7 individuals, respectively. Importantly, none of these
RAR phenotypes within the diagnostic groups constituted less
than 10% of the sample, aligning with the principle stated earlier
in our statistical approach, which utilized the Bayesian Informa-
tion Criterion to select the optimal model while precluding solu-
tions comprising groups comprising <10% of the sample.

The participants in the three groups were demographically
similar, but they had signiﬁcant differences in their RAR char-
acteristics. The “earlier” group exhibited an earlier acrophase as
measured by both actigraphy and the app, while the “later”
group showed a later acrophase based on the same measures.

In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the cutoff
points for acrophase measured by actigraphy and the app
were 14:44:06 (PM) and 15:59:42 (PM), respectively, distin-
guishing the “earlier” group from the “later” group. Similarly,
the cutoff points for sleep time and wake time were 23:49:30
(PM) and 7:26:57 (AM), respectively, between the two groups.
In contrast, the “irregular” group demonstrated unstable RAR
as measured by both the app and actigraphy. This group had
the lowest IS, with IS measured by the app (ISapp) below 0.23
and by actigraphy (ISact) below 0.38, as well as the highest IV,
with IV measured by the app (IVapp) exceeding 1.41.

Besides, the “irregular” group showed an asynchronous
rhythm between physical activity and human–smartphone
interaction patterns, with the largest differences in acrophase
between actigraphy and app (2.82 Æ 3.24 h). Participants with
RAR characteristics similar to their group’s mean values are
illustrated in Figure 3. Age, sex, and WASO did not signiﬁ-
cantly differ among the three groups. However, the “later”
group had signiﬁcantly longer TST than the “earlier” group
by 49.1 Æ 14.8 min.

In addition, Table 1 shows the analysis to include the timing
of the most active 10-h period (M10) and the least active 5-h
period (L5), measured by both actigraphy and human–
smartphone interactions. The comparative data reveal that the

Note: Continuous variables, such as age and BMI, were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, with standard deviations presented in parentheses alongside mean
values. For categorical variables, such as gender, the Chi-square test was employed. p-Values were derived from the statistical tests conducted, namely the one-
way ANOVA and the Chi-square test. For instances where p <0:05, further post hoc analysis was performed. The results of these post hoc analyses are detailed
in the Comparison section. For example, in the one-way ANOVA, signiﬁcant differences were observed among the three groups regarding sleep onset. The post
hoc analysis revealed that the “later” group had a signiﬁcantly later sleep onset compared to both the “earlier” and the “irregular” groups. However, no
signiﬁcant difference was found between the “earlier” and “irregular” groups in the post hoc analysis, leading to a notation in the comparison as “L >E, I.”
Abbreviations: E, the “earlier” group; I, the “irregular” group; L, the “later” group.
aTimes are in day decimal time, for example, 23.50 = 23:30 (PM).

“later” group exhibits a delayed timing in both M10 and L5
intervals compared to the earlier group, mirroring the delayed
acrophase observed in the same cohort.

For PHQ-9 scores, although the one-way ANOVA indicated
signiﬁcant differences among the groups (p ¼ 0:022), the post
hoc analysis did not show signiﬁcant differences when compar-
ing the groups individually; hence, no speciﬁc comparisons were
noted. A similar situation was observed in the BMI comparisons;
despite a signiﬁcant difference in the one-way ANOVA test (p ¼
0:049), the post hoc analysis did not reveal signiﬁcant differences
among the individual groups, and thus no comparisons were
noted. Given that factors other than RARs, such as TST, WASO,
and other potential variables, could inﬂuence the differences
observed in the clinical outcomes among the groups, we

controlled for these potential confounders in subsequent analy-
ses, as detailed in Table 2 to provide a more nuanced under-
standing of the group differences.

Table 2 presents the diagnosis-, age- and sex-adjusted mod-
els to compare the clinical outcomes, PHQ-9 scores, and BMI
among the three groups. The “irregular” group, which had the
most unstable RAR, had signiﬁcantly higher PHQ-9 scores
than the “earlier” group, while their BMI was higher than the
“later” group. We also controlled for M10, TST, and WASO to
examine the independence of the RAR group-symptom dimen-
sion associations from physical activity level, sleep continuity,
and duration. These ﬁndings indicate that the observed differ-
ences in PHQ-9 scores and BMI among the groups persist, even
after considering these factors.

4. Discussion

The ﬁndings of this study were grossly consistent with previous
studies that used actigraphy to classify individuals based on
their RAR proﬁles measured by actigraphy [6, 39] and
extended these ﬁndings by incorporating human–smartphone
interaction data to assess RAR in mental or social activities. In
this study, we primarily interpreted circadian rhythms using
standard actigraphy measures but used the RAR measured by
the app as supplementary evidence. We grouped participants
based on their RAR proﬁles, as measured by actigraphy and the
app, and named them according to their consistency across
both indicators, resulting in three groups: “earlier,” “later,”
and “irregular.” In analyzing the differences among the three
groups, as illustrated in Table 1 and visualized in Figure 2, we
identiﬁed shared RAR patterns that were not discernible
through a single metric alone. For instance, in the IVact, there
were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the “later”
group, the “earlier” group, and the “irregular” group (Table 1).
Consistent with previous studies that linked RAR proﬁles with
psychiatric symptoms [6, 9, 12, 39, 40], our study found that the
later chronotype and irregular circadian rhythm groups had
higher depressive symptom (PHQ-9) scores than the earlier
group. Even though the earlier group had the most regular
circadian rhythm, as indicated by the highest ISact, their
human–smartphone interaction RAR was less regular than
the “later” group, with lower ISapp and higher IVapp. The TST
of the “earlier” group was also signiﬁcantly shorter than that of
the “later” group (7.10 h versus 7.91 h, p <0:001). As a result,
the earlier and irregular groups had a signiﬁcantly higher BMI
and a higher proportion of obesity (BMI ≧ 27) than the “later”
group, which had the longest TST and most stable RARapp with
higher ISapp and lower IVapp. This combined analysis of acti-
graphy and human–smartphone interaction patterns high-
lights the intricate RARs associated with mental and physical
health indicators, offering a more comprehensive understand-
ing than what is provided by traditional actigraphy measures
alone.

Our analysis, as detailed in Figures 2 and 3, demonstrates
that incorporating smartphone data allows us to identify

unique behavioral patterns that actigraphy alone cannot cap-
ture. The “irregular” group emerged with distinct circadian
rhythm disruptions, characterized by lower IS, higher IV, nota-
ble acrophase discrepancies between actigraphy and app mea-
surements (2.82 Æ 3.24 h), and also presented with the highest
levels of depressive symptoms and obesity. Aligning with prior
research [6–12, 39], our ﬁndings afﬁrm the link between dis-
rupted RAR and major depressive disorder and introduce a
novel insight into the asynchrony between app and actigraphy
measurements as potential indicators of broader health impli-
cations, particularly obesity. This suggests that such discrepan-
cies might indicate a mental–physical “jetlag,” potentially
affecting overall health [41]. Further exploration is needed to
understand whether these asynchronies are driven by smart-
phone usage behaviors or reﬂect inherent characteristics
detectable through smartphones, as well as the implications
of such differences for mental activity proxies.

Our study utilized the RAR of the human–smartphone
interaction method to address the limitations of previous stud-
ies that solely relied on actigraphy to measure RAR. In our
subgroup analysis, the irregular group had lower overall IS
and higher IV compared to the other two groups. Although
the IVact was the highest in the irregular group, the difference
was not statistically signiﬁcant (p ¼ 0:073) among the three
groups. However, the IVapp was the highest in the irregular
group with statistical signiﬁcance (p <0:001). In comparison
to the previous RAR measured by only actigraphy, the earlier
group was labeled as the earlier/robust group due to the earlier
acrophase measured by actigraphy, which often co-occurred
with a more stable circadian rhythm, as evidenced by lower
IV, higher IS, and higher relative amplitude [6, 12, 39]. How-
ever, in our subgroup analysis that used both actigraphy and
human–smartphone interaction patterns, the irregular group
did not have a signiﬁcantly different acrophase measured by
actigraphy compared to the earlier group but had a signiﬁcantly
later acrophase measured by the Rhythm app and the least
stable circadian rhythm, with the lowest ISapp and highest
IVapp, among the three groups. The “earlier” group had the
most stable circadian rhythm measured by actigraphy, with the
highest ISact, but the “later” group had the most stable circadian

10

rhythm measured by human–smartphone interaction patterns,
with signiﬁcantly higher ISapp and lower IVapp compared to the
“earlier” group.

This study can address the unmet need in current clinical
practice and related research. The most common sleep assess-
ments in general clinical practice are sleep–wake time and sleep
duration. In this study, only the ﬁnding that the “earlier” group
sleeps and wakes earlier with shorter sleep time could be drawn.
It was difﬁcult to determine the impact on depressive symptoms
or obesity, especially for the “irregular” group with higher levels
of depression and obesity that could not be identiﬁed by such
assessment. If the actigraphy measurement was applied, the
characteristics of the “irregular” group could be identiﬁed based
on the lower ISact, but there was no signiﬁcant difference in IVact
compared to the other two groups. Therefore, adding the ISapp
and IVapp, which could show signiﬁcant differences between the
groups, could enhance the judgment of actigraphy-measured
RAR. In addition, the actigraphy-measured acrophase of the
“irregular” group did not differ signiﬁcantly from that of the
“earlier group,” and it was necessary to measure the acrophase
of human–smartphone interaction patterns to distinguish the
“irregular” group from this study, where the “irregular” group
showed greater asynchronous rhythm between physical activity
and human–smartphone interaction patterns.

Our study focused on the relationship between circadian
rhythm disruptions, depression, and obesity due to the strong
evidence linking these conditions. Circadian abnormalities,
regulated by key clock genes such as CLOCK and BMAL1,
are well-documented in depressive disorders and signiﬁcantly
impact metabolic processes associated with obesity [42]. More-
over, disturbances in sleep–wake cycles, a core component of
circadian rhythms, are central to the pathology of depression
[43]. While anxiety is frequently comorbid with depression, its
connection to circadian rhythms is more variable and less
mechanistically deﬁned, making it less suitable for the focused
analysis conducted in this study.

It is important to consider the limitations of our study
when interpreting the results. First, due to the cross-sectional
design of our study, we could not establish a causal relationship
between RAR and health outcomes. While we identiﬁed sub-
groups with different RAR proﬁles, it was unclear whether
these proﬁles were a cause or consequence of mental and phys-
ical health outcomes. Longitudinal studies are needed to further
investigate these associations and determine potential mechan-
isms. Second, although our sample included individuals from a
workplace health promotion program, we did not have a refer-
ence group with low BMI and low depressive symptoms, which
limited our ability to compare results. Third, while we derived
RAR proﬁles from human–smartphone interaction patterns,
the meaning and validity of these proﬁles, such as “mental
activities” or “social activities,” require further exploration. Spe-
ciﬁcally, we observed differences in rhythms between mental
and physical activity, but it was unclear whether these differ-
ences were due to smartphone behaviors or were intrinsic
properties captured by the device. Fourth, the Rhythm app
we used only works with the Android operating system. Future
studies should develop versions for other operating systems,
such as iOS and Windows, to increase the generalizability of

our ﬁndings. Furthermore, although the PHQ-9 self-reported
scale was used to assess depressive symptoms, which is subject
to recall bias, all diagnoses of major depressive disorder were
independently conﬁrmed by psychiatrists according to DSM-5
criteria. This step ensures that our ﬁndings on depressive
symptoms are underpinned by robust clinical assessments,
thereby mitigating the limitations inherent to self-reported
data. Fifth, while our sample size aligns with the requirements
outlined in our sample size estimation, the recruitment strategy
aimed to encompass a certain proportion of individuals with
obesity, major depressive disorder, both conditions and healthy
controls. Consequently, participants were recruited from vari-
ous settings, including obesity clinics, psychiatric outpatient
clinics, and other healthcare facilities. This convenience sam-
pling method poses methodological limitations, as the sample
may not be fully representative of the broader population. To
enhance the generalizability of our ﬁndings, future research
should endeavor to recruit more representative samples from
larger, longitudinal cohorts, thereby bolstering the robustness
and applicability of our study’s conclusions. Although pharma-
cological treatments, including antidepressants and benzodia-
zepines, may inﬂuence circadian rhythms, existing evidence
suggests that these effects are generally subtle or inconsistent.
For instance, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic anti-
depressants tend to stabilize circadian rhythms by modulating
rapid eye movement sleep or advancing suprachiasmatic
nucleus phases, while BZDs have minimal impact on circadian
rhythm parameters [44, 45]. If medication effects were signiﬁ-
cant, they would likely reduce variability rather than produce
the pronounced disruptions observed in the “irregular” group.
Furthermore, our use of a multimodal approach combining
actigraphy and human–smartphone interactions provides
robust data that minimizes potential biases introduced by med-
ications. Nevertheless, future studies should include detailed
medication data to better account for their potential inﬂuence
on RARs. Finally, we acknowledge that such data (e.g., poly-
somnography) could provide additional insights into sleep pat-
terns and quality; however, our study was designed to focus on
noninvasive measures using actigraphy and smartphone
interactions.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, our study highlights the usefulness of
human–smartphone interaction patterns in providing a com-
prehensive understanding of individuals’ circadian rhythms
beyond standard actigraphy measurements. Our results indi-
cate that individuals with irregular circadian rhythms exhibit
higher IV and lower IS, as measured by both actigraphy and
human–smartphone interaction patterns. Additionally, the
irregular circadian rhythm group demonstrated the most
desynchronized acrophase between physical activity and
human–smartphone interaction patterns. The irregular circa-
dian rhythm group was also associated with more depressive
symptoms and higher levels of obesity. Given the RARs are
modiﬁable, our ﬁndings provide information on the particular
RAR characteristics that may be monitored or targeted in
future interventions. Future studies with larger and more

Depression and Anxiety

diverse populations are necessary to conﬁrm our ﬁndings and
explore the clinical implications of using human–smartphone
interaction patterns in circadian rhythm assessment.
