Impact of Dark Triad personality traits 
on COVID-19 vaccination uptake and prevention 
efforts: insights from the European Covid Survey 
(ECOS)
Sophia Bock1*, Sebastian Neumann‑Böhme2 and Petra Steinorth1 

Abstract 
Background  Even though the COVID‑19 vaccination roll‑out in general can be considered as one of the most 
successful public health campaigns in the history of medicine, general vaccination hesitancy has remained an issue 
of concern throughout the world. We add to a deeper understanding of vaccination hesitancy by identifying what 
drives primary vaccination and booster uptake, as well as adherence to simple preventive measures such as physical 
distancing by investigating the role of Dark Triad personality traits, i.e. Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy.

Methods  We investigate data from Germany and the United Kingdom from the European Covid Survey which 
was collected from 23 December 2021 to 10 January 2022. Logit regressions and random effects regressions were 
performed to study the effect of dark personality traits on COVID‑19‑related prevention.

Results  We find a statistically significant association between Dark Triad personality traits and prevention efforts, 
primary vaccinations, and booster uptake against COVID‑19. Specifically, individuals scoring high in psychopa‑
thy are associated with a lower likelihood of having received primary immunization. The marginal effect amounts 
to 3.31%‑points. High narcissistic personality traits are correlated with a substantially higher likelihood (4.52%‑points) 
to refuse booster shots after having received the primary vaccinations. Dark Triad personality traits may be relevant 
factors associated with vaccine‑related decision‑making. In addition, individuals with higher psychopathic tenden‑
cies report significantly lower engagement in other simple preventive behavior, while higher scores in narcissism are 
associated with higher reported adherence to simple preventive measures.

Conclusions  Our findings highlight the crucial role that personality plays in pandemic‑related prevention. Policymak‑
ers, health professionals, and those in charge of health messaging may take these factors into account when devising 
communication strategies to improve the vaccination uptake and adherence to preventive behaviors. Future pan‑
demics and public health crises would benefit from targeted, nuanced approaches to public health messaging to pro‑
mote greater public adherence and public health.

Introduction
Vaccination  hesitancy  is  a  global  phenomenon  where 
a substantial  part  of the population  is  not  getting vacci-
nated  despite  having access to the vaccine.  Even though 
the  COVID-19  vaccination  roll-out  in  general  can  be 
considered  as  one  of  the  most  successful  public  health 
campaigns  in  the  history  of  medicine,  general  vaccina-
tion hesitancy has remained an issue of concern through-
out the world [1, 2], even within high risk groups such as 
pregnant  women [3, 4]. The World Health  Organization 
reports  about  5.2  billion  of  the  overall  7.8  billion  global 
population  have  received  full  primary  immunization  for 
COVID-19 as of the end of the year 2023.

The decision to get a vaccination is a prevention deci-
sion,  which  requires  an  investment  upfront  (the  actual 
vaccination  and  potential  side  effects  thereafter)  in  the 
expectation of the long-term benefit of immunity as the-
oretically  discussed  by  Courbage  and  Peter  [5]. The  fear 
of future side effects is one of the highest ranked reasons 
for  hesitating  to  get  vaccinated  [6,  7].  Science  has  pro-
vided conclusive evidence that (public) health benefits by 
far  exceed  adverse  outcomes  from  vaccinations.  Never-
theless, individual preferences and behavioral biases may 
imply that individuals prefer not to get vaccinated or take 
protective action, as suggested by Campos-Mercade et al. 
[8], Müller and Rau [9], Zettler et al. [10] or Ścigała et al. 
[11]. In addition to the initial COVID-19 vaccination hes-
itancy among some groups within the population, also a 
sizeable  number  of  individuals  opted  out  from  booster 
shots who had received primary vaccinations. The neces-
sity  for  regular  booster  shots  only  became  evident  over 
time  after  promising  results  on  vaccine  efficiency  at  the 
end  of  2021  [12].  New  variants  emerged  and  evidence 
showed  that  booster  shots  were  required  for  long-term 
prevention as antibodies reduce after a couple of months.
Individuals  can  also  take  (simple)  personal  preventive 
measures  such  as  reducing  contacts  to  others  or  using 
hand  sanitizer  as  discussed  in  Smith  et  al.  [13].  Stodd-
ard  et  al.  [14]  use  a  game-theoretic  approach  to  explore 
noncompliance with non-pharmaceutical and biomedical 
measures during  a  pandemic and show  that  noncompli-
ance  can  be  an  individually  optimal  choice  in  terms  of 
cost-benefit under a broad set of conditions. Agusto et al. 
[15]  study  (rational)  behavior  of  susceptible  individu-
als in the context of social distancing to explain the sec-
ond wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond previous 
results, Bughin et al. [16] highlight the trade-off between 
vaccination  and  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  such 
as social distancing as individuals balance these two types 
of prevention to protect against COVID-19.

Furthermore,  Sabat  et  al.  [17]  find  evidence  for  vac-
cination  hesitancy  as  the  most  unstable  vaccine  inten-
tion  with  on  average  42%  of  ever-hesitant  individuals 

remaining  hesitant  in  future  waves.  Understanding  the 
dynamics  and  determinants  of  vaccination  efforts  is 
crucial  for  the  success  of  targeted  campaigns  for  future 
health crisis.

We  contribute  to  a  deeper  understanding  of  vacci-
nation  hesitancy  by  examining  factors  associated  with 
vaccination  uptake,  specifically  differentiating  between 
primary vaccination and booster uptake, as well as adher-
ence  to  WHO  recommendations  on  simple  preventive 
behavior  by  investigating  the  role  of  Dark  Triad  (SD3) 
personality  traits,  i.e.  Machiavellianism,  narcissism,  and 
psychopathy, as introduced by Paulhus and Williams [18], 
in these three prevention decisions.

The Dark Triad personality traits are relevant for iden-
tifying  behaviors  and  power  structures  in  groups  [19], 
but  also  with  COVID-19-related  vaccination  hesitancy 
[20] and for tailoring public health messages to increase 
adherence [21]. Individuals who score high in Machiavel-
lianism are self-interested, ruthless, and cynical manipu-
lators, who deceive for material gain, e.g. by misreporting 
[22].  Individuals  with  high  narcissism  have  a  sense  of 
grandiosity and entitlement. High scores in psychopathy 
lead to antisocial behavior, impulsivity, and thrill-seeking. 
Psychopathy  is  associated  with  less  compliant  behav-
ior  as  well  as  social  distancing  [23],  and  greater  beliefs 
in  COVID-19-related  conspiracy  theories  [24].  How-
ever,  other  research  suggests  that  a  major  health  crisis 
itself can influence the stability of social preferences and 
behavior, as discussed by Shachat, Walker, and Wei [25], 
Li  et  al.  [26]  or  Lohmann  et  al.  [27].  While  for  example 
Lohmann et al. [27] find that high exposures to COVID-
19  causes  lead  to  an  increase  in  anti-social  behavior, 
mental health support in the early stages of a crisis may 
be critical.

We contribute to the existing literature on the demand 
for vaccines, Dark Triad personality traits, and behavior 
during the COVID-19 pandemic by specifically analyzing 
the propensity for booster shots and other simple preven-
tive  measures  in  addition  to  primary  vaccination.  These 
preventive  behaviors  are  recommended  by  the  WHO  as 
socially preventive and responsible behavior [28]. We do 
find distinct associations between malevolent personality 
traits and these three different dimensions of prevention 
during the COVID-19 health crisis. Our analysis suggests 
that  individuals  with  narcissistic  personality  traits  are 
associated with a higher likelihood of reporting to refuse 
booster shots after having received the primary vaccina-
tions,  while  individuals  scoring  high  in  psychopathy  are 
significantly less likely to report to have received primary 
immunization.  Individuals  with  higher  psychopathic 
tendencies exhibit lower adherence to other simple pre-
ventive  behavior,  while  higher  scores  in  narcissism  are 
associated with higher reported adherence.

We  also  contribute  to  the  literature  that  investigates 
potential barriers and determinants of (general) vaccina-
tion  uptake  and  prevention,  ranging  from  socio-demo-
graphic  factors,  social  norms  and  beliefs,  and  previous 
experiences  [29–31],  people’s  level  of  religiosity  [32,  33] 
or  cognitive  factors  such  as  susceptibility  and  severity 
[34].  At  the  aggregate  level,  the  literature  emphasizes 
the role of the trustworthiness of public organizations or 
institutions [35–37], cost of vaccines [38], and anticipated 
consequences  of  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  [39]. 
Furthermore, Böhm and Betsch [40] and  Böhm, Betsch, 
and Korn [41] find that pro-social concerns increase vac-
cination  uptake.  In  addition,  findings  suggest  that  risk-
averse  individuals  are  more  likely  to  be  vaccinated  as 
shown by Benzion, and Shahrabani [42], among others.

Our  analysis  is  based  on  the  longitudinal  European 
COvid  Survey  (ECOS).  The  study  was  originally  con-
ducted to analyze people’s attitudes and concerns regard-
ing  the  novel  coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2,  including  items 
from  the  COVID-19  Snapshot  Monitoring  Project 
(WHO).  In  particular,  previous  publications  analyzed 
probable  depression  and  anxiety  during  the  pandemic 
[43], the uptake of the WHO recommendations [44], the 
link between altruism and pro-social pandemic behavior 
[45], people’s perceptions about the policy responses [46] 
or vaccination uptake in general [6].

After  this  introduction,  the  paper  is  structured  as  fol-
lows:  We  first  introduce  background  of  the  Dark  Triad 
personality  and  discuss  potential  effects  on  COVID-
19-related preventive behavior. Methods section gives an 
overview of the data and methods we use in our analysis. 
We  then  show  results  from  our  analysis  in  Results  sec-
tion. Discussion section offers some discussion and pol-
icy  implications  are  addressed.  In  Conclusions  section, 
concluding thoughts are presented.

Dark Triad personality and COVID‑19‑related 
vaccination and other preventive behavior
The  Dark  Triad  personality  consists  of  the  three  con-
ceptually  distinct  subclinical  personality  traits  Machi-
avellianism,  narcissism,  and  psychopathy  [18].  While 
these constructs are of overlapping nature1 the literature 
provides  evidence  of  distinctive  differences  [18,  47–49]. 
With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, some literature 
studies  a  potential  differential  impact  of  the  three  per-
sonality constructs on health-behavior endorsement and 
the appeal of public health messages [21] or psychologi-
cal consequences [50, 51].

1  We observe intercorrelations of about 40% to 55% in our data. The high-
est  correlation  between  narcissism  and  psychopathy  is  consistent  with  the 
original study from Paulhus and Williams [18].

In the following, we discuss how the individual person-
ality  traits  of  the  Dark  Triad  potentially  affect  primary 
immunization, booster uptake, and other simple preven-
tive behavior. Table 1 summarizes the results of the dis-
cussion of the following three sections.

We  do  not  expect  individuals  with  high  Machiavel-
lian personality traits to differ from the rest of the sam-
ple with respect to the primary vaccination and booster 
shots, but to be more likely to adhere to preventive meas-
ures  as  we  discuss  below.  We  do  not  expect  narcissistic 
individuals  to  be  more  likely  primary  immunized  than 
the  rest  of  the  sample,  but  to  be  more  likely  to  opt  out 
from  the  booster  shot.  In  addition,  we  expect  individu-
als  with  high  narcissistic  personality  traits  to  be  more 
likely  to  report  adherence  to  preventive  measures  as  we 
explain  in  Narcissism  section.  For  individuals  with  high 
psychopathic  tendencies,  we  expect  fewer  vaccinations, 
less booster uptake, and less preventive behavior.

Machiavellianism

Machiavellians  have  the  tendency  to  be  manipulating, 
calculating,  and  ruthless  individuals  with  little  regard 
for  others  [18].  Generally,  Machiavellians  carefully  con-
sider the odds of their behavior and often use antisocial 
methods to achieve their goals, justified through ration-
alizations [52]. While these tendencies can lead to useful 
social  outcomes  under  certain  circumstances,  Machi-
avellians  can  use  the  pandemic  to  exploit  and  manipu-
late  others  to  serve  their  self-beneficial  goals  [48].  In 
sum,  Machiavellianism  comprises  several  different  core 
themes and can be seen as a multidimensional construct 
[53].

As  the  primary  immunizations  and  booster  shots 
are  considered  safe  and  are  recommended  by  health 
authorities,  we  would  not  expect  Machiavellians  to  be 
more  likely  to  opt  out  from  vaccinations  than  individu-
als with less pronounced Machiavellian personality. This 
may  hold  true  even  though  concerns  about  protecting 
others  from  infection  can  be  considered  a  lower  pri-
ority  for  Machiavellians.  With  respect  to  other  simple 
preventive  behavior,  Machiavellians  can  be  less  affected

by  pandemic  fatigue2  due  to  their  rationality  and  lower 
individual  costs  compared  to  vaccination  and  therefore 
adhere  more  consistently  to  preventive  measures  if  they 
consider  them  effective.  In  addition,  over-reporting  of 
adherence can be seen as a reputation building tactic as 
Machiavellians may feel fewer moral concerns about not 
truthfully reporting own behavior [48].

Narcissism

Individuals  with  pronounced  narcissistic  personality 
traits  are  self-absorbed  and  egocentric  and  have  a  con-
stant need for validation for their inflated self-view [18]. 
Furthermore,  narcissists  believe  in  their  superiority  and 
tend to be dismissive of advice from others [54, 55].

With respect to the primary immunization, narcissistic 
individuals consider their own health as more important 
than the health of other individuals and may feel entitled 
to be prioritized to get vaccinated. They consider them-
selves  as  good  leaders  and  role-models  for  others  [56]. 
The  initially  scarce  and  new  technology  of  vaccines  can 
serve as a potential source of narcissistic supply and self-
validation.  Seeking  affirmation  satisfies  the  grandiose 
self-concept  of  narcissists  [57].  At  the  same  time,  indi-
viduals with high narcissistic personality traits may show 
aggravated concern about potential side effects and may 
not want to serve as “guinea pigs” on a newly developed 
vaccination technology, which can reduce the likelihood 
of  getting  vaccinated.  Even  though  narcissistic  individu-
als  are  more  self-centered,  being  vaccinated  and  poten-
tially protecting others from harm may be a way to gain 
social  recognition  for  protecting  others.  Overall,  these 
described  motives  and  the  self-serving  behavior  may  all 
be present and we therefore do not come up with a clear 
prediction  whether  narcissistic  individuals  are  more  or 
less likely to have received primary immunization.

With  respect  to  the  booster  uptake,  concerns  about 
protecting  others  from  infection  were  less  pronounced 
in  the  marketing  campaign.  Due  to  the  declining  pro-
tection  of  the  primary  immunization  over  time  and  the 
requirement  to  booster,  the  COVID-19  vaccination  may 
be  considered  disappointing  by  some  individuals.  We 
hypothesize  that  feeling  deceived  about  the  short-term 
nature of protection from COVID-19 is potentially more 
pronounced  for  individuals  with  high  narcissistic  per-
sonality  traits.  Narcissistic  personality  has  been  shown 
to be associated with low levels of forgiveness, see Exline 
et  al.  [58].  Accordingly,  narcissistic  individuals  can  be 
expected to be less forgiving – also with respect to a vac-
cination, which did not provide as long-lasting coverage 

2  The  term  pandemic  fatigue  is  defined  by  WHO  as  the  unwillingness  to 
comply with recommended protective behavior for expanded time periods.

as  expected.  In  addition,  booster  vaccinations  were  not 
scarce anymore at the time of the study. A generally avail-
able  vaccine  offers  less  narcissistic  supply.  Overall,  the 
booster  vaccination  had  less  appeal  to  narcissistic  indi-
viduals  than  the  primary  immunizations  and  we  there-
fore  expect  that  they  are  more  likely  to  opt  out  from 
booster  vaccinations  after  having  received  a  primary 
immunization.

With  respect  to  simple  preventive  behavior,  narcissis-
tic  individuals  may  receive  self-validation  from  display-
ing extremely careful behavior towards others. They may 
feel more shame to admit that they do not always adhere 
to  meaningful  preventive  behavior  and  may  therefore 
over-report  their  preventive  behavior.  Accordingly,  we 
expect narcissistic individuals to report more preventive 
behavior.

Psychopathy

Pronounced  psychopathic  personality  traits  are  associ-
ated  with  lack  of  empathy  and  remorse  and  bold,  disin-
hibited behavior [18]. It is worth noting that psychopaths 
are more likely to act on temptation than Machiavellians 
and  therefore  show  more  impulsive  behavior  and  more 
risk-taking  [59].  Similarly,  psychopathic  individuals  are 
also more pronounced to antisocial behavior and tend to 
aggression and physical threat [48, 59, 60].

Pro-social  concerns  of  getting  vaccinated  and  adher-
ing  to  other  simple  preventive  measures  matter  less  to 
individuals  with  high  psychopathic  traits  and  their  risk 
seeking  tendencies  can  reduce  the  appeal  of  preven-
tion.  Accordingly,  we  predict  that  individuals  with  high 
psychopathic  personality  traits  are  less  likely  to  get  vac-
cinated, to receive a booster, and to engage in other pre-
ventive behavior.

In  sum,  as  the  three  Dark  Triad  personality  concepts 
show  distinctive  correlates  we  will  investigate  separate 
measurements in our analysis.

Methods
ECOS survey on COVID‑19‑related behavior

Our  data  utilizes  wave  nine  from  the  European  Covid 
Survey.  This  longitudinal  study  covers  Germany,  the 
United  Kingdom,  Denmark,  Netherlands,  France,  Por-
tugal, Italy, and Spain. In each country, data is collected 
from  about  1,000  respondents.  The  initial  wave  of  the 
web-based  survey  was  conducted  in  April  2020.  The 
respondents  were  recruited  via  the  market  research 
company  Dynata.  In  order  to  ensure  the  representa-
tiveness with respect to gender, age, region, and educa-
tion within each sample, country specific quotas based 
on  the  respective  census  data  were  used.  We  applied 
common  quality  controls,  such  as  excluding  individu-
als [61], who completed the questionnaire in less than a 

Bock et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1352

third of the median survey duration per country, as well 
as  excluding  multiple  responses  by  the  same  person 
and  incomplete  responses.  Respondents  were  paid  by 
the panel provider for complete surveys, which is com-
mon practice in online data collections (see for example 
Smith  et  al.  [13]).  The  questionnaire  was  programmed 
by  the  authors  to  avoid  ordering  effects  by  employing 
block  randomizers  and  force  response  as  a  condition 
for  the  completion  of  the  questionnaire  to  avoid  miss-
ing  data  by  design.  A  more  detailed  description  of  the 
ECOS survey and fieldwork can be found in Sabat et al. 
[62].

The  data  collection  of  wave  nine  started  on  23 
December 2021 and was completed on 10 January 2022. 
We  restrict  our  analysis  to  Germany  and  the  United 
Kingdom because the respective questionnaires include 
new  questions  on  Dark  Triad  personality.  Further 
details on the relevant parts of the questionnaire can be 
found in Appendix A.

As  our  analysis  is  based  on  data  from  Germany  and 
the UK, we focus on the timeline of COVID-19 in these 
two  countries.  Even  though  the  coronavirus  hit  Ger-
many  and  the  UK  just  days  apart  at  the  end  of  Janu-
ary 2020, both countries responded differently (see for 
example Van Kessel et al. [63] for an overview of differ-
ent  COVID-19  vaccination  policies  in  Europe).  At  the 
time the data for this study was collected, booster shots 
were already available and all adults were eligible. Nev-
ertheless, the booster campaign in the UK was further 
advanced than in Germany and the booster rate in the 
UK was about 10 percentage points higher as depicted 
in Fig. 1.

Measures

In  our  study,  we  investigate  the  association  between 
dark  personality  traits  and  COVID-19-related  preven-
tive  behavior,  e.g.  primary  vaccination  and  booster 
uptake,  and  adherence  to  simple  preventive  meas-
ures.  The  respondent’s  general  COVID-19  vaccination 
acceptance  (or  hesitancy)  is  assessed  with  the  actual 
vaccination  status.  The  respondents  indicate  whether 
they  have  received  no  shot,  the  first  shot  or  if  they 
have  already  received  primary  immunization  as  they 
have  received  two  shots  or  three  shots  (booster).  The 
measure  for  simple  preventive  behavior  comprises  six 
items  with  four  levels,  covering  the  following  aspects: 
regular  hand  washing;  covering  nose  and  mouth  when 
sneezing;  physical  distancing;  avoiding  shaking  hands, 
hugging,  kissing;  using  alcohol-based  hand  rub;  and 
avoiding  touching  the  face.  These  measures  reflect 
the  initial  recommendations  by  the  WHO  [28,  64]  to 
reduce  the  spread  of  the  pandemic  and  the  individual 
risk  of  infection  and  became  common  measures  of 
COVID-19  prevention  in  the  literature  (see  for  exam-
ple  Varghese  et  al.  [44],  Jordan,  Yoeli,  and  Rand  [65], 
Smith et al. [13], Wachira et al. [66]). Due to the panel 
nature of the ECOS data collection, the measures were 
repeatedly  collected  to  allow  comparisons  over  time. 
Similar to other COVID-19 related publications (see for 
example Smith et al. [13], Neumann-Böhme, Sabat, and 
Attema [45], Al-Zubaidy et al. [67]), we summarized the 
preventive behaviors in one index. The total adherence 
index  was  calculated  by  standardizing  and  adding  up 
the scores of each item, divided by the number of items.

To  explain  COVID-19  vaccine-related  decisions  our 
variables of interest are malevolent personality traits, i.e. 
Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy. To assess 
Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy, the vali-
dated  Short  Dark  Triad  questionnaire  (SD3)  developed 
by Jones and Paulhus [49] is used. The Dark Triad score 
comprises nine items for each personality trait, totalling 
to  27  items.  Answers  can  be  given  on  a  5-point  Likert-
scale,  ranging  from  1  (strongly  disagree)  to  5  (strongly 
agree).3  The  Dark  Triad  score  was  derived  using  princi-
pal component analysis analogous to the approach from 
Pailing, Boon, and Egan [72], which is widely used in the 
literature. This score combines the three Dark Triad per-
sonality  traits  into  one  scalar  by  multiplying  each  mean 
response  per  personality  trait  with  the  respective  factor 
loading  and  add  them  up  to  one  index.  Throughout  the 
analysis,  we  use  this  measure  as  the  Dark  Triad  score. 
In addition, we investigate the three Dark Triad person-
alities  separately.  For  each  personality  score,  we  use  the 
mean of the standardized answers to nine items.

In addition, we control for socio-economic factors that 
have been found to be associated with COVID-19-related 
decisions  and  are  therefore  included  into  our  model  [6, 
43, 73]. Socio-economic controls include country of resi-
dence,  age,  gender,  relative  income  (making  ends  meet), 
education,  relationship  status,  number  of  children  in 
the household, and risk groups present in the household 
(e.g. elderly persons or someone with diagnosed chronic 
medical  conditions).  In  addition,  we  include  the  health 
risk  attitude  by  11  categories.  To  capture  the  individual 
health  risk  attitude,  participants  have  to  rate  their  will-
ingness  to  take  health  risks  on  an  11-point  Likert-scale 
from 0 (not at all willing to take health risks) to 10 (very 
willing to take health risks). To measure the health state 
we  use  the  EQ-5D  (see  Herdman  et  al.  [74])  and  calcu-
late a score for the health status. Well-being is measured 
using  the  ICECAP-A  (see  Al-Janabi,  Flynn,  and  Coast 
[75]),  where  we  again  standardize  the  answers  to  calcu-
late a score for the quality of life.

Analysis

We  investigate  the  effect  of  the  Dark  Triad  personal-
ity  on  vaccination  uptake,  e.g.  to  have  received  primary 
immunization  and  to  already  have  received  a  booster 
shot  (when  having  received  the  primary  immunization) 

3  The  SD3  questionnaire  has  been  translated  into  German  for  use  with 
German-speaking  individuals.  The  German  version  of  the  SD3  serves  as 
a  reliable  proxy  for  German  samples,  demonstrating  high  cross-language 
replicability, as evidenced by several studies (see for example Malesza et al. 
[68], Wehner et al. [69]) and was also assessed in other (cross-cultural) stud-
ies [70, 71].

as  well  as  adherence  to  simple  preventive  measures  in 
response to COVID-19.

To estimate the effect of malevolent personality on vac-

cination uptake, our models are specified as follows:

Logit(Yi) = β0 + β1DarkTriadi + γ Xcontrolsi

+ ǫi with i = 1, ..., N
(1)

Logit(Yi) = β0 + β1psychopathyi + β2narcissismi + β3Machiavellianismi

+ γ Xcontrolsi

+ ǫi with i = 1, ..., N

(2)
The  dependent  variable  Yi  is  the  vaccination  status, 
i.e.  having  received  primary  immunization  and  having 
received  a  booster  shot  (when  having  received  primary 
immunization).  The  set  of  control  variables  described 
above  is  denoted  by  Xcontrolsi .  Socio-economic  controls 
include  country  of  residence,  age,  gender,  income,  edu-
cation,  the  relationship  status,  a  variable  that  indicates 
whether the household includes kids under the age of 18, 
a variable that indicates whether the household includes 
risk  groups,  self-reported  health  risk  attitude,  self-
reported health status (EQ-5D), and self-reported quality 
of  life  (ICECAP-A).  Our  variable  of  interest  in  our  first 
Logit  estimation  (1)  is  the  Dark  Triad  score  derived  via 
principal component analysis.4 In addition, in model (2) 
we  investigate  the  three  Dark  Triad  personality  scores, 
i.e.  on  Machiavellianism,  narcissism,  and  psychopathy, 
separately.

In addition, we investigate the link between Dark Triad 
personality  and  simple  preventive  behavior  like  physical 
distancing or regular hand washing. We estimate the fol-
lowing random effects models:

Preventive behaviorij = β0 + β1DarkTriadij + γ Xcontrolsij

+ αj + ǫij with i = 1, ..., N

Preventive behaviorij = β0 + β1psychopathyij + β2narcissismij
+ β3Machiavellianismij + γ Xcontrolsij

+ αj + ǫij with i = 1, ..., N

(3)

(4)

The  dependent  variable  is  the  preventive  behavior 
score. To assess preventive behavior, we use the mean of 
the standardized responses to the six items on preventive 
behavior.  Random  effects  on  country  level  are  included. 
Our set of control variables Xcontrolsij is the same as above. 
In  addition,  we  include  the  vaccination  status  of  the 
individual as an additional control. Again, in addition to 
investigating  the  Dark  Triad  score  in  model  (3),  we  also 
account  for  each  Dark  Triad  personality  trait  separately 
in model (4).

4  However,  our  results  are  the  same  if  we  use  the  mean  of  all  personality 
responses for each individual as the Dark Triad score instead.

Results
Descriptive statistics

Our  sample  includes  individual  characteristics  of  1,007 
participants  from  Germany  (DE)  and  1,023  partici-
pants from the UK, totaling to 2,030 individuals. A small 
majority of the participants (52%) are female and 72% of 
the  participants  have  no  children.  The  mean  age  of  the 
full sample is about 50 years. On average, 42% are able to 
make ends meet fairly easily, 44% have a high education 
level, and 49% are married.

In addition, our sample includes information on vacci-
nation  status,  adherence  to  simple  preventive  measures, 
and  Dark  Triad  personality.  The  majority  of  the  sample 
have already received (at least) primary immunization as 
they  have  received  two  or  three  shots.  On  average,  86% 
(DE: 84%; UK: 87%) of the participants in our sample are 
primary vaccinated. In addition, most of the participants 
(whole  sample:  61%;  DE:  52%;  UK:  70%)  responded  that 
they  have  already  received  a  booster  shot.  Constraints 
on  availability  of  and  access  to  vaccination  can  be  one 
explanation  for  the  lower  booster  rate  in  Germany  as 
the COVID-19 booster campaign was less evolved there 
compared  to  the  UK.  The  mean  (median)  score  of  pre-
ventive behavior is 3.07 (3.17). With respect to the Dark 
Triad  personality,  individuals  scored  the  highest  on 
Machiavellianism.  The  overall  Dark  Triad  score  derived 
via  principal  component  analysis  ranges  from  −3.73  to 
4.01. The Dark Triad personality scores do not differ sub-
stantially  between  Germany  and  the  UK.  Full  tables  on 
summary statistics are provided in Appendix B.

Dark Triad personality and primary immunization

In  the  following  sections,  we  report  our  regression 
results.  In  our  first  model  specification  the  dependent 
variable Yi equals 1 if the individual has received primary 
immunization, as they have received two or three shots, 
and  0  if  not.  Therefore,  our  model  estimates  the  likeli-
hood  of  having  received  at  least  primary  immunization. 
The  control  group  are  individuals  who  have  received  no 
shot  or  one  shot.  Table  2  shows  estimation  results  from 
the logit model (1) and (2).

In  column  (1),  the  Dark  Triad  score  is  significant  at 
the  5%  level  controlling  for  socio-economic  factors. 
This implies that individuals scoring high at the SD3 are 
less  likely  primary  immunized.  An  increase  in  the  Dark 
Triad  score  of  one  unit  is  associated  with  a  decrease  in 
the  likelihood  of  having  received  primary  immuniza-
tion of 1.29 percentage points. Our results in column (2) 
show that the negative correlation of SD3 and the likeli-
hood of having received primary immunization is linked 
to  psychopathy.  The  coefficient  estimate  is  negative  and 
significant at the 5% level, supporting the argument that 
individuals with higher psychopathic traits are less likely 
to get vaccinated. A one unit increase in the psychopathy 
score  is  associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  probability  of 
having  received  primary  immunization  of  3.31  percent-
age points.

With  regard  to  socio-economic  controls,  there  is  a 
positive  relationship  between  age,  income,  the  qual-
ity of life, and the likelihood of having received primary 
immunization. Individuals from the UK have significantly 
more likely received primary immunization which can be

loading and added up to one scalar. In column (2) the score on psychopathy is calculated by averaging the (standardized) answers to nine questions. The scores on 
narcissism and Machiavellianism are calculated analogously

attributed to the earlier start of the vaccination campaign 
so that more people are already vaccinated at the timing 
of the survey. Being single and having kids has a signifi-
cant  negative  correlation  to  vaccination  acceptance.  We 
report the full Table 2 including estimates on control var-
iables in Appendix B.

Because  of  the  timing  of  wave  nine  of  the  survey  (23 
December 2021 to 10 January 2022), we have to account 
for the variation in eligibility of and access to vaccines in 
Germany and the UK. Compared to Germany (84%), we 
observe  a  higher  vaccination  rate  with  regard  to  having 
received  primary  immunization  in  the  UK  (87%)  as  the 
vaccination  campaign  was  further  evolved  in  this  coun-
try. In addition, while the majority of people in Germany 
have  a  clear  preference  for  the  Biontech/Pfizer  vaccine 
(58%), people tend to prefer the AstraZeneca vaccine in 
the UK (18%) compared to Germany (2%) in our sample.

As a robustness check, we investigate the effect of Dark 
Triad personality on having received primary immuniza-
tion  for  each  country,  i.e.  Germany  and  UK,  separately. 
Table  3  provides  estimation  results  on  our  first  model 
specification for Germany in column (1) and (2) and the 
UK in column (3) and (4), where we compare individuals 
who  have  already  received  (at  least)  primary  immuniza-
tion to those who have not. While we find no significant 
relationship for Dark Triad personalities in Germany, in 
the  UK  the  negative  correlation  between  psychopathy 
and  primary  immunization  is  even  more  pronounced 
and significant at the 5% level, which can be attributed to 
the  different  development  of  the  vaccination  campaign. 

Interestingly,  we  observe  a  positive  association  for 
Machiavellian  personality  and  having  received  primary 
immunization in the UK, but the effect is only marginally 
significant.

Dark Triad personality and booster uptake

In  a  second  model  specification,  the  dependent  variable 
Yi equals 1 if the individual has already received a booster 
shot  and  0  if  not.  The  control  group  in  this  setting  are 
individuals  who  have  already  received  the  primary  vac-
cination.  Therefore,  our  model  estimates  the  likelihood 
of  having  received  a  booster  shot  when  already  hav-
ing  received  primary  immunization.  Table  4  reports  the 
regression results from logit model (1) and (2).

With respect to having already received a booster shot, 
the coefficient on Dark Triad is negative as well but not 
significant. In column (2), narcissism is significant at the 
5%  level,  while  psychopathy  and  Machiavellianism  are 
not  significant.  Narcissistic  individuals  are  associated 
with  a  higher  likelihood  of  refusing  booster  shots  after 
having  received  the  primary  vaccination.  Specifically, 
a  one  unit  increase  in  the  score  on  narcissism  is  associ-
ated with a decrease in the probability of having received 
a  booster  shot  (after  having  received  primary  immuni-
zation)  of  4.52  percentage  points.  Neither  do  we  find  a 
significant correlation for Machiavellianism on the prob-
ability  of  already  having  received  a  booster  shot  nor  for 
psychopathy.

Among  utilized  socio-economic  controls,  there  is  a 
positive  relationship  between  age,  education,  income  as 
well as the effect of risk groups in the household and the 
probability of being boostered (after having received pri-
mary immunization). Again, individuals from the UK are 
more  likely  boostered  than  individuals  from  Germany. 
Being  single  and  having  kids  is  significantly  negatively 

correlated with booster uptake. We report the full Table 4 
including estimates on control variables in Appendix B.

Again, because of the timing of wave nine of the survey, 
we have to account for the variation in eligibility of and 
access to booster in Germany and the UK. Compared to 
Germany, we observe a higher booster rate in the UK as 
the booster campaign was further evolved in this country.

Triad personality on booster uptake for Germany and the 
UK, separately. Table 5 provides estimation results on our 
second  model  specification  for  Germany  in  column  (1) 
and  (2)  and  the  UK  in  column  (3)  and  (4).  With  regard 
to  the  relationship  between  Dark  Triad  personality  and 
booster  uptake  in  Germany,  again  we  do  not  find  any 
significant  association  controlling  for  socio-economic 
factors.  If  we  only  consider  individuals  from  the  UK  in 
column  (3)  and  (4),  we  find  significant  and  even  more 
pronounced  effects  of  the  Dark  Triad  personality  on 
booster uptake compared to the results based on the full 
sample. Specifically, a one unit increase in the Dark Triad 
score  is  associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  probability  of 
having  received  a  booster  shot  (after  having  received 
primary  immunization)  of  1.95  percentage  points.  With 
regard  to  the  three  Dark  Triad  personality  traits,  again, 
we find a significant association for narcissism at the 5% 
level.  A  one  unit  increase  in  the  score  on  narcissism  is 
associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  probability  of  having 
received  a  booster  shot  of  5.92  percentage  points.  One 
reason  for  the  more  pronounced  effect  of  narcissism  on 
booster  hesitancy  in  the  UK  can  be  due  to  the  fact  that 
more  people  preferred  the  AstraZeneca  vaccine  (18%) 
compared  to  Germany  (2%).  After  the  arising  debate  on 
the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, people with 
narcissistic  personality  may  even  be  more  disappointed 
after  having  received  primary  immunization  and  are 
therefore more likely to opt out from the booster shot.

Dark Triad personality and simple preventive behavior

This  section  shows  regression  results  where  we  investi-
gate the link between Dark Triad personality and simple 
preventive  behavior  like  physical  distancing  or  regular 
hand washing. Table 6 reports regression results using a 
random effects model investigating the Dark Triad score 

in column (1) and each Dark Triad personality trait sepa-
rately  in  column  (2).  The  dependent  variable  is  the  pre-
ventive behavior score.

The  coefficient  estimates  for  psychopathy  and  nar-
cissism  are  significant  at  the  1%  level.  Specifically,  indi-
viduals  scoring  high  at  psychopathy  are  associated  with 
significantly 
lower  adherence  to  simple  preventive 
behavior.  In  contrast  to  this  finding,  individuals  with 
higher  narcissistic  personality  are  more  likely  to  adhere 
to  preventive  behavior  practices.  Specifically,  a  one  unit 
increase  in  the  score  of  psychopathy  is  associated  with 
a  decrease  in  the  score  on  preventive  behavior  of  0.211 
points, while a one unit increase in the score on narcis-
sism  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  adherence-
score on preventive behavior of 0.115 points. This result 
seems to be robust throughout the six preventive recom-
mendations,  even  if  considerable  heterogeneity  can  be 
observed with regard to adherence to each measure [44] 
(not shown in the table). With respect to socio-economic 
factors,  being  older,  a  higher  reported  health  status  and 
quality  of  life  significantly  correlates  with  an  increase 
in  adherence  to  preventive  measures,  while  being  male, 
a higher income, being single, and a higher self-reported 
willingness  to  take  health  risks  is  associated  with  lower 
adherence.  The  association  for  health  status  is  only  sig-
nificant  in  column  (1).  Having  received  a  booster  shot 
(compared to having received primary immunization) is 
significantly  associated  with  higher  adherence  to  simple 
preventive  measures,  while  not  having  received  primary 
immunization  (compared  to  having  received  primary 
immunization)  correlates  negatively  with  engagement 
into  other  preventive  behavior  measures.  Again,  we 
report the full Table 6 including estimates on control var-
iables in Appendix B.

physical distancing, avoiding shaking hands/hugging/kissing, using alcohol-based hand rub, and avoiding touching the face. In column (1) the Dark Triad score is

To  summarize,  we  find  evidence  that  Dark  Triad  per-
sonality  traits  are  significantly  associated  with  primary 
vaccination  and  booster  uptake  as  well  as  adherence  to 
simple preventive measures. Therefore, our results high-
light  an  important  channel  of  vaccination  hesitancy  in 
addition  to  factors  that  have  already  been  found  to  be 
associated  with  COVID-19-related  behavior  in  previ-
ous  studies.  In  addition,  our  results  suggest  to  account 
for distinct aspects of the Dark Triad personality as psy-
chopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism show differ-
ent  patterns  of  correlation  with  vaccination  uptake  and 
socially responsible behavior.

In  addition,  we  conduct  further  sensitivity  analyses  in 
which we account for potential multicollinearity between 
the  Dark  Triad  personality  traits,  restrict  our  sample, 
rerun  the  regression  estimating  a  probit  model,  and  use 
an alternative score as the Dark Triad score to ensure the 
robustness  of  our  results  presented  in  this  chapter.  Our 
findings  show  extremely  robust  estimates.  Sensitivity 
analyses are shown in Appendix C.

Discussion
This paper investigated the relationship between the Dark 
Triad personality traits, vaccinations against COVID-19, 
and adherence to (simple) preventive behaviors. We find 
that  dark  personality  traits  correlate  with  the  demand 
for vaccines, indicated by the vaccination status for both 
the  primary  and  the  booster  vaccination  as  well  as  the 
adherence  to  other  simple  preventive  measures  in  dif-
ferent  ways.  These  findings  suggest  that  tailored  com-
munication  and  delivery  strategies  may  be  beneficial  in 
addressing potential psychological barriers to vaccination 
uptake.

The  global  COVID-19  pandemic  has  not  only  been  a 
stress  test  for  hospitals,  outpatient  services,  and  health 
administrations,  but  has  also  changed  societies  (see 
Vicente  and  Suleman  [76]  for  an  overview).  For  exam-
ple,  results  from  the  US  suggest  that  the  pandemic 
highlighted  the  selfless  behavior  of  others  and  a  mutual 
dependence in society [77]. At the beginning of the pan-
demic,  the  public  goods  perspective  of  prevention  was 
heavily  emphasized:  Individuals  were  asked  to  stay  at 
home  to  protect  elderly  from  harm,  and  vaccinations 
were also marketed as not only protecting the vaccinated 
person  but  also  stopping  the  spread  of  the  pandemic. 
Personality traits heavily influence our willingness to do 
things  that  benefit  others.  The  literature  on  personality 
traits  and  COVID-19  behaviors  suggests  that  individual 
risk perception and cognitive biases [78], personality dif-
ferences [79], and individualism [80] play a role in adher-
ence  to  social  distancing  and  containment  measures. 
Psychological  characteristics  such  as  conspiratorial  and 
paranoid  beliefs  were  related  to  vaccination  hesitancy 

[20]  and  altruism  plays  a  role  in  pro-social  pandemic 
behaviors [45].

In  this  study,  we  find  evidence  that  Dark  Triad  per-
sonality  traits  are  associated  with  preventive  behaviors 
with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic in several ways. 
These  findings  relate  to  earlier  studies  that  for  example 
link  the  DT  personality  traits,  COVID-19-specific  con-
spiracy beliefs and the willingness to be vaccinated in the 
future [24]. In the following, we discuss our results based 
on  the  predictions  for  each  personality  trait  outlined  in 
the Motivation section.

We expected that individuals with high scores in Mach-
iavellian personality traits will be more likely to adhere to 
preventive  measures  and  not  differ  from  the  rest  of  the 
sample  regarding  primary  and  booster  vaccinations.  As 
expected, we did not find a relationship between Machi-
avellianism  and  vaccination  hesitancy  but,  interestingly, 
Konc,  Petrović,  and  Dinić  [81]  showed  that  deviousness 
(an  aspect  of  Machiavellianism)  was  associated  with  an 
unwillingness  to  vaccinate  against  COVID-19  indepen-
dently of risk-taking tendencies. In contrast to the a pri-
ori expectations, we did not find a significant association 
between Machiavellianism and adherence to simple pre-
ventive behaviors.

Our  prediction  for  narcissism  was  that  respondents 
with narcissistic personality traits will not differ from the 
rest  of  the  sample  in  terms  of  primary  immunizations, 
but  are  more  likely  to  opt  out  of  booster  shots  in  part 
because these were not scarce anymore and provide less 
narcissistic  supply.  We  further  predicted  that  respond-
ents  with  higher  narcissism  scores  were  more  likely  to 
report  adherence  to  preventive  measures  because  they 
may  receive  self-validation  from  displaying  extremely 
careful behavior towards others. As expected, we find no 
significant  relationship  between  narcissism  and  primary 
vaccinations. In line with expectations, our findings show 
that  narcissistic  personality  traits  are  associated  with  a 
higher likelihood of refusing booster shots after receiving 
the  primary  vaccinations.  The  differences  are  economi-
cally  relevant,  with  marginal  effects  of  4.52  percentage 
points. In line with our findings, narcissism and psychop-
athy  appear  to  be  related  to  vaccination  hesitancy  and 
anti-vaccine outcomes [82]. Interestingly, Li and Cao [83] 
extend the dark personality traits and find that (everyday) 
sadism  was  also  associated  with  more  vaccine  refusal. 
In  line  with  our  predictions,  we  find  that  higher  scores 
of  narcissism  are  positively  associated  with  preventive 
behaviors.

Since  psychopathy  is  associated  with  a  lack  of  empa-
thy  and  remorse  as  well  as  bold,  disinhibited  behavior, 
we expected respondents with high psychopathy scores 
to be unwilling to be vaccinated as well as less likely to 
engage in simple preventive behaviors. Contrary to our 

 Bock et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1352 

Page 12 of 15

expectations,  we  did  not  find  a  significant  relationship 
between  psychopathy  and  booster  vaccinations,  while 
our  other  two  predictions  on  psychopathy  can  be  sup-
ported  by  the  ECOS  data.  In  line  with  the  predictions, 
we  find  that  individuals  who  scored  higher  in  psy-
chopathy  were  significantly  less  likely  to  have  received 
primary  immunization  with  marginal  effects  of  3.31 
percentage  points.  One  reason  why  we  did  not  find  a 
significant relationship for booster hesitancy is that psy-
chopathic individuals may have already dropped out for 
primary  immunization,  as  we  only  consider  individu-
als that have at least received primary immunization to 
analyze  booster  uptake.  Furthermore,  individuals  with 
higher  psychopathic  tendencies  are  associated  with 
a  lower  engagement  in  simple  preventive  behaviors, 
which supports Konc, Petrović, and Dinić [81] findings, 
who show the same effect for recklessness as an aspect 
of psychopathy.

Overall, our results are almost completely in line with 
the  theoretical  predictions  we  made  a  priori  about  the 
three  personality  types  and  relate  to  earlier  findings  in 
the literature.

This study adds to the growing understanding of vacci-
nation hesitancy and adherence to COVID-19 preventive 
measures. Our findings highlight the crucial role that per-
sonality  traits,  specifically  the  Dark  Triad,  play  in  these 
behaviors. The importance of addressing certain person-
ality traits in (public) information campaigns to increase 
the effectiveness of the advertisement is well established 
in the marketing literature, for example in the domain of 
road safety advertising [84] or in the context of tailoring 
political advertisements towards voter’s personality traits 
[85].  In  a  health  setting,  Olsacher  et  al.  [86]  find  a  cor-
relation  between  the  big  5  personality  traits  and  organ 
donation,  with  a  higher  effectiveness  of  messages  that 
were  tailored  towards  the  personality  traits.  Related  to 
COVID-19  and  the  dark  triad  personality  traits,  Huang, 
Yang,  and  Dai  [87]  find  that  people  who  score  higher 
in  Machiavellianism  reported  stronger  anti-pandemic 
intentions  (e.g.  wanting  to  learn  more  about  COVID-
19)  when  a  message  was  tailored  towards  the  impact  of 
COVID-19  on  themselves  compared  to  messages  high-
lighting the impact towards others. Policymakers, health 
professionals,  and  those  in  charge  of  public  health  mes-
saging  may  take  these  factors  into  account  when  devis-
ing communication strategies to improve the vaccination 
uptake and adherence to preventive behaviors.

Firstly,  to  address  narcissistic  tendencies,  messaging 
around  booster  vaccines  should  be  tailored  to  appeal  to 
individuals’ sense of uniqueness and importance. Strate-
gies could include emphasizing the advanced technology 
used in the booster shots, making it a ’premium’ choice. 
This approach could also leverage on exclusivity or status 

to appeal to the inherent desire for admiration that char-
acterizes this personality trait.

Secondly,  our  findings  show  that  individuals  with  psy-
chopathic  tendencies  are  associated  with  a  lower  likeli-
hood  of  getting  vaccinated  and  adhering  to  preventive 
measures.  Given  the  spontaneous  and  thrill-seeking 
nature associated with high psychopathy levels, alternative 
approaches  could  be  explored  to  target  this  group.  One 
could consider spontaneous vaccination offers in environ-
ments that appeal to their impulsivity, such as casinos or 
theme parks. Quick-access, walk-in vaccination centers, or 
pop-up clinics in highly trafficked areas might also provide 
the spontaneity that would appeal to such individuals.

Lastly, there is a need for greater public education and 
transparent  communication  to  tackle  the  influence  of 
conspiracy  theories,  which  is  particularly  relevant  for 
individuals  with  high  dark  triad  personality  traits  due 
to the greater susceptibility to conspiracy theories. Poli-
cymakers  should  prioritize  evidence-based,  accessible 
information to debunk common myths and conspiracies 
surrounding COVID-19 vaccinations.

Some  limitations  need  emphasizing:  First,  we  used 
self-reported  vaccination  status  from  a  representative 
online  survey  and  are  not  able  to  verify  the  official  sta-
tus. Respondents with high scores in the Dark Triad per-
sonality traits could be more likely to misrepresent their 
answers.  At  the  same  time,  the  anonymity  and  online 
nature  of  the  study  provided  no  incentives  to  provide 
socially  desirable  answers  and  we  find  a  substantial  dif-
ference in vaccination decisions based on the Dark Triad 
personality  traits  psychopathy  and  narcissism.  Further-
more,  employing  online  panels  to  elicit  the  populations 
preferences  was  a  common  and  useful  way  to  attain 
data  in  the  pandemic.  Nonetheless,  it  came  with  cer-
tain  drawbacks,  for  example  problems  to  reach  older 
parts of the population and the risk of people filling out 
these  surveys  professionally.  We  carefully  designed  the 
online  questionnaire  to  avoid  that  respondents  were 
unable  to  complete  the  questionnaire,  i.e.  because  of  a 
lack of understanding of questions or, on the other hand, 
that  some  respondents  speed  through  the  survey  to  be 
rewarded  without  providing  meaningful  information. 
We therefore had to make certain design decisions such 
as the use of the force response option to avoid missing 
data. Since we provided middle options such as “neither 
agree nor disagree”, we believe respondents had options 
to express their preferences to continue. Second, as indi-
cated  in  figure  1,  the  vaccination  campaigns  in  the  UK 
and Germany differed concerning the availability of vac-
cines due to the earlier Conditional Marketing Authori-
zation of vaccines in the UK, which may have resulted in 
higher reported vaccination rates in the UK in this study. 
We  find  a  higher  association  of  Dark  Triad  personality 

Bock et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1352 

Page 13 of 15

traits with booster vaccinations, which can be due to the 
differences  in  roll-out.  Lastly,  we  caution  the  reader  to 
interpret  our  results  as  correlations  rather  than  causal 
effects  as  the  observed  behavior  itself  may  influence  or 
even  reinforce  personality  traits.  While  existing  litera-
ture predominantly suggests Dark Triad personalities to 
be  rather  stable  or  slightly  decreasing  over  longer  time 
horizons (see for example Edelstein, Newton, and Stew-
art [88], Lynam et al. [89], Grosz et al. [90]), we cannot 
fully  rule  out  that  COVID-19  preventive  measures  may 
influence  self-reporting  of  personality  traits.  While  our 
findings indicate statistically significant associations, we 
acknowledge that other unobserved factors may contrib-
ute to these relationships. Future longitudinal or experi-
mental  studies  could  provide  deeper  insights  into  the 
directional effects of personality traits on health-related 
decision-making.

Conclusions
Our  results  suggest  that  personality  types  should  be 
considered  for  such  information  campaigns  to  frame 
messages  and  adopt  policies  that  appeal  for  example  to 
narcissists,  because  even  small  changes  in  messaging 
have  shown  to  affect  the  level  of  adherence  of  different 
personality types [91]. These findings provide insights for 
future  outbreaks  and  pandemics  to  achieve  higher  vac-
cination  rates  and  more  adherence  to  protective  meas-
ures.  Lastly,  the  relevance  of  psychopathic  personality 
traits and the association with vaccine related conspiracy 
theories  [24]  may  explain  some  of  the  radical  intensity 
in  the  public  and  private  debates  about  the  COVID-19 
vaccination.

In  conclusion,  there  is  a  necessity  of  a  targeted, 
nuanced approach to public health messaging to appeal 
to  parts  of  the  population  that  score  high  in  the  Dark 
Triad  personality  traits.  While  broad,  universal  mes-
saging  serves  a  purpose,  acknowledging  the  impact  of 
personality traits on health behaviors has the potential 
to reach and convince groups who might otherwise stay 
unwilling to be vaccinated. Future pandemics and pub-
lic  health  crises  would  benefit  from  this  understand-
ing  to  promote  greater  public  adherence  to  protective 
measures and lower levels of vaccination hesitancy.
