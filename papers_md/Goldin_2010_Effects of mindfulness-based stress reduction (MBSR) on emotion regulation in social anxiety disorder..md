Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an established program shown to reduce symptoms 
of stress, anxiety, and depression. MBSR is believed to alter emotional responding by modifying 
cognitive–affective processes. Given that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by 
emotional and attentional biases as well as distorted negative self-beliefs, we examined MBSR-
related changes in the brain-behavior indices of emotional reactivity and regulation of negative 
self-beliefs in patients with SAD. Sixteen patients underwent functional MRI while reacting to 
negative self-beliefs and while regulating negative emotions using 2 types of attention deployment 
emotion regulation—breath-focused attention and distraction-focused attention. Post-MBSR, 14 
patients completed neuroimaging assessments. Compared with baseline, MBSR completers 
showed improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms and self-esteem. During the breath-
focused attention task (but not the distraction-focused attention task), they also showed (a) 
decreased negative emotion experience, (b) reduced amygdala activity, and (c) increased activity 
in brain regions implicated in attentional deployment. MBSR training in patients with SAD may 
reduce emotional reactivity while enhancing emotion regulation. These changes might facilitate 
reduction in SAD-related avoidance behaviors, clinical symptoms, and automatic emotional 
reactivity to negative self-beliefs in adults with SAD.

The concept of mindfulness has attracted attention in the domains of basic emotion research, 
clinical science, and social–cognitive–affective neuroscience. The most studied form of 
mindfulness training in the United States is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a 
structured group program of mindfulness training developed by Kabat-Zinn (1990). There is 
also increasing interest in mindfulness-based exercises in the context of clinical 
interventions for anxiety and depression disorders, as well as other clinical problems (Allen, 
Chambers, & Knight, 2006; Carmody, 2009).

At this stage in the field’s development, we believe it is useful to apply Western 
psychological models of cognitive–affective processes to the study of mindfulness in order

to clarify how mindfulness training works (Carmody, 2009). More specifically, we suggest 
that an emotion regulation framework (Gross, 2007) may help clarify the processes that 
underlie MBSR, processes that may be distinct from those implicated in other more 
traditional modalities such as cognitive–behavioral therapy (Hofmann & Asmundson, 2008).

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction

MBSR consists of multiple forms of mindfulness practice, including formal and informal 
meditation practice, as well as hatha yoga (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). The formal practice consists 
of breath-focused attention, body scan-based attention to the transient nature of sensory 
experience, shifting attention across sensory modalities, open monitoring of moment-to-
moment experience, walking meditation, and eating meditation. Informal practice entails 
brief pauses involving volitionally shifting attention to present moment awareness. 
Together, this package of mindfulness practices aims to enhance the ability to observe the 
immediate content of experience, specifically, the transient nature of thoughts, emotion, 
memories, mental images, and physical sensation.

Two specific forms of nonelaborative, nonconceptual attention-focusing meditations that are 
introduced in MBSR are (a) focused attention defined as object-based (e.g., sensations 
induced during breathing) volitional selective attention in the present moment with ongoing 
assessment of the quality of attention, and (b) open monitoring defined as settling attention 
into a state of mere observation or monitoring in the present moment on any experience 
(thought, emotion, physical sensation) without any explicit focus on an object (Lutz, Slagter, 
Dunne, & Davidson, 2008).

Although there is no explicit instruction in changing the nature of thinking, or emotional 
reactivity, MBSR has been shown to diminish the habitual tendency to emotionally react to 
and ruminate about transitory thoughts and physical sensations (Ramel, Goldin, Carmona, & 
McQuaid, 2004; Teasdale et al., 2000); reduce stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms 
(Chiesa & Serretti, 2009; Evans et al., 2008; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002); modify 
distorted patterns of self-view (Goldin, Ramel, & Gross, 2009); amplify immune functioning 
(Davidson et al., 2003); enhance behavioral self-regulation (Lykins & Baer, 2009); and 
improve volitional orienting of attention (Jha, Krompinger, & Baime, 2007). Recent 
functional neuroimaging studies of MBSR have provided evidence of reduced narrative and 
conceptual and increased experiential and sensory self-focus at post-MBSR (Farb et al., 
2007) and decreased conceptual–linguistic self-referential processing from pre- to post-
MBSR (Goldin, Ramel, et al., 2009).

MBSR and Emotion Regulation

Theorists have suggested that MBSR may reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and 
depression by modifying emotion regulation abilities, but it is not yet clear which specific 
abilities may be enhanced by MBSR (Chambers, Gullone, & Allen, 2009). This is because 
emotion regulation refers to a variety of strategies that can be implemented at different 
points during the emotion-generative process to influence which emotions arise, when and 
how long they occur, and how these emotions are experienced and expressed (Gross, 2007).

Distinct forms of emotion regulation have their own neural circuitry and temporal features 
(Goldin, McRae, Ramel, & Gross, 2008).

The process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) proposes five families of emotion 
regulation strategies, including situation selection, situation modification, attentional 
deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. There is evidence that MBSR and 
long-term mindfulness meditation practice may directly influence attentional deployment, 
specifically the ability to exert cognitive control of negative rumination (Ramel et al., 2004), 
self-focused attention (Goldin, Ramel, et al., 2009), attention allocation and regulation 
(Slagter, Lutz, Greischar, Nieuwenhuis, & Davidson, 2008), and orienting to a spatial cue 
(Jha et al., 2007). Lutz et al. (2008) have proposed that such training of attention is expected 
to result in “improvement in the capacity to disengage from aversive emotional stimuli … 
enabling greater emotional flexibility” (p. 4). However, the proposed effects of MBSR on 
emotional reactivity and attentional deployment require empirical investigation.

MBSR, Emotion Regulation, and Social Anxiety Disorder

One clinical context in which MBSR’s effects of emotion regulation might be investigated is 
social anxiety disorder (SAD). SAD is a very common psychiatric condition that is 
characterized by intense fear of evaluation in social or performance situations (Jefferys, 
1997). Patients with SAD have a strong tendency to focus on both internal cues (e.g., 
negative thoughts and self-imagery) and external cues (e.g., other’s facial expressions) 
during social situations (Schultz & Heimberg, 2008). This attentional focus serves to 
maintain social anxiety symptoms by interfering with habituation processes that lead to 
corrective learning in vivo and during cognitive-behavioral therapy (Heimberg & Becker, 
2002).

Recent electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that adults with SAD demonstrate 
abnormal attentional processes consisting of early hypervigilance followed by attentional 
avoidance (i.e., reduced visual processing) of social threat stimuli (Mueller et al., 2008). 
Studies have shown that adults with SAD show diminished recruitment of brain networks 
implicated in cognitive regulation (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [PFC], dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex) and in attention regulation (posterior cingulate/precuneus, inferior parietal 
lobe, supramarginal gyrus) during cognitive reappraisal of emotional reactivity to social 
threat (Goldin, Manber, Hakimi, Canli, & Gross, 2009) and to negative self-beliefs (Goldin, 
Manber Ball, Werner, Heimberg, & Gross, 2009).

Two studies have examined the impact of MBSR on SAD. One study found equivalent 
improvement in patients with generalized SAD on mood, functionality, and quality of life 
with either 8-week MBSR or 12-week cognitive–behavioral group therapy (CBGT), but 
significantly lower scores on clinician- and patient-rated measures of social anxiety for 
CBGT compared with the MBSR group (Koszycki, Benger, Shlik, & Bradwejn, 2007). A 
recent study of MBSR for adults with generalized SAD showed reduced anxiety, negative 
self-view, and conceptual-linguistic self-referential processing along with increased self-
esteem and positive self-view (Goldin, Ramel, et al., 2009). However, little is yet known 
about how MBSR influences the neural bases of emotional reactivity and emotion

regulation, particularly when someone with SAD is challenged with social anxiety-related 
negative self-beliefs, which are a core feature of SAD.

The Present Study

To investigate MBSR-related changes in emotion reactivity and regulation of negative self-
beliefs in patients with SAD, we assessed clinical symptoms and obtained behavioral and 
neural measures of emotional reactivity and regulation at baseline and post-MBSR. 
Clinically, we expected MBSR-related changes, including reduced symptoms of anxiety and 
depression and enhanced self-esteem in patients with SAD. In the emotion regulation task, 
we examined two forms of attention deployment: breath-focused attention (the target 
regulation strategy) and distraction-focused attention (a control regulation strategy). We 
expected MBSR-related changes in relation to the breath-focused mindful attention, 
including (a) decreased negative emotion after implementing breath-focused attention, (b) 
decreased brain activity in emotion-related limbic activity (i.e., amygdala), and (c) increased 
activity in attention-related brain regions, but (d) no change related to distraction-based 
attention.

Method

Participants

Sixteen right-handed adult patients (nine women) diagnosed with primary generalized SAD 
met DSM-IV criteria based on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV 
(ADIS-IV; DiNardo, Brown, & Barlow, 1994). Based on the interview, past comorbid 
conditions included two patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder, three with dysthymia, 
and four with major depressive disorder; current conditions included three with generalized 
anxiety disorder, three with specific phobia, and one with panic disorder without 
agoraphobia. Patients were on average middle age (M = 35.2 years, SD = 11.9), college 
educated (M = 16.3 years of education, SD = 3.5), and diverse in race: eight Anglo 
Americans, five Asian Americans, two Latino Americans, and one Native American. 
Patients provided informed consent in accordance with Stanford University’s Human 
Subjects Committee guidelines for ethical research. Two patients (one men and one women) 
declined the post-MBSR magnetic resonance (MR) assessment because of distress about 
scanning.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

To be eligible for the study, patients had to pass a MR scanning safety screen on three 
occasions, as well as not report current use of psychotropic medication, prior meditation 
training, history of neurological or cardiovascular disorders, or met diagnostic criteria for 
current Axis I psychiatric disorders other than social anxiety, generalized anxiety, 
agoraphobia, or specific phobia disorders.

Clinical Assessment

In addition to the clinical diagnostic interview (ADIS-IV), self-report inventories were used 
to assess social anxiety (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale; Liebowitz, 1987), depression

(Beck Depression Inventory—II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), rumination (Rumination 
Style Questionnaire; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991), state anxiety (Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety 
Inventory; Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970), and self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-
Esteem Scale; Rosenberg, 1965).

Procedure

Recruitment strategies consisted of electronic bulletin-board listings and referrals from 
mental health clinics. Patients completed a phone screen to establish initial eligibility for the 
study. Next, patients were administered a structured clinical diagnostic interview in the 
laboratory. After meeting MR scanning and diagnostic criteria, eligible patients completed 
online questionnaires and a brain imaging session within the following week. At the 
scanning session, patients were introduced to the emotion regulation task and given two 
practice trials with negative self-beliefs not used during the fMRI experiment. Participants 
attended MBSR for 2 months and then returned to the laboratory to complete all assessments 
again.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction

The standard MBSR protocol developed by Kabat-Zinn (1990) was delivered in an 
academic setting. MBSR consisted of a 2.5-hr once-weekly small-group (eight members in a 
group) format for eight sessions plus one half-day meditation retreat. Participants were given 
meditation CDs created by Kabat-Zinn to support home formal practice. Participants were 
instructed to complete a self-report daily monitoring form each evening to record both 
formal and informal meditation practices. Participants attended most MBSR classes (M = 
7.07, SD = 0.83) and completed a moderate amount of weekly hours of home meditation 
practice (M = 2.26 hr, SD = 0.55) separate from the 2.5-hr weekly class. MBSR was 
delivered by a member of the team (PG) who, while not being board certified in the Western 
tradition of MBSR, lived and studied in Buddhist monasteries in Nepal and India for 6 years 
prior to returning to the United States and being trained in and leading MBSR courses in 
medical and academic settings for 10 years.

Regulation of Negative Self-Beliefs Task

The regulation task consisted of 18 experimenter-selected social anxiety-related negative 
self-beliefs that refer to self-focused, self-critical personal beliefs (e.g., “I am ashamed of 
my shyness,” “People always judge me”). Each trial consisted of reacting to a negative self-
belief for 12 s, implementation of attention regulation based on a cue to either “Shift 
attention to the breath” (breath-focused attention; nine trials) or “Count backward from 168” 
(distraction-focused attention; nine trials) for 12 s (see Figure 1). The two attention 
regulation conditions were presented in a fixed pseudorandom sequence. After 
implementing breath-focused attention or distraction-focused attention, participants 
provided a negative emotion rating (How negative do you feel right now? 1 = not at all, 2 = 
slight, 3 = moderate, 4 = very much) for 3 s. Ratings were recorded using Eprime software 
(Version 2; Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) with a button response pad 
positioned in the participant’s right hand (3 s).

The comparison baseline condition consisted of identifying the number of asterisks on the 
screen every 3 s (range: 1–5 asterisks) and making a button press to indicate the number of 
asterisks on the screen at any given time. There were six 9-s blocks of asterisk counting 
randomly inserted throughout the experiment. Prior to scanning, participants were trained on 
the regulation task with four negative self-beliefs not used in the experiment. They were 
instructed to read repeatedly a single negative self-belief presented in white against a black 
background on a screen mounted on the head coil inside the scanner. When a cue appeared 
above the belief, participants shifted attention to the physical sensation of their own 
inhalation and exhalation (breath-focused attention) or began subtracting by ones from a 
three-digit number projected above the statement (distraction-focused attention). The 
regulation task was 9 min 12 s (368 time points × 1.5 s = 552 s) in duration.

Image Acquisition

A General Electric 3 Tesla Signa magnet was used to acquire anatomical and functional 
images. We used a custom-built quadrature “dome” elliptical bird cage head coil and a T2*-
weighted gradient echo spiral-in/out pulse sequence to obtain blood oxygenation level-
dependent (BOLD) contrast (Glover & Law, 2001). A wax bite bar, padding, and plungers 
were used to reduce head movement. A single functional run was used to acquire 368 
volumes consisting of 22 sequential axial slices each. Scanning parameters also included TR 
= 1,500 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 60, field of view = 22 cm, frequency encoding = 64, 
single shot, voxel resolution = 3.44 mm2 in-plane and 5 mm through-plane. A fast spin-echo 
spoiled-grass pulse sequence was used to obtain a high-resolution anatomical image (voxel 
resolution = .862 × 1.2 mm; field of view = 22 cm, frequency encoding = 256).

fMRI Data Preprocessing

BOLD signal preprocessing and statistical analysis was conducted with Analysis of 
Functional NeuroImages: AFNI version 2008_07_18_1710, Nov 18 2008 (Cox, 1996). 
Visual and computational examination of each volume yielded no signal artifacts or 
movement outliers greater than 1.0 mm motion correction in the x, y, or z directions. Thus, 
no scans were omitted. The first 6 s of images obtained while the magnet field was gaining 
stabilization were eliminated. Volume registration, realignment, and calculation of six 
motion parameters (three translations and three rotations) were conducted on an empirically 
determined optimal base image derived from an automated recursive analysis of the root-
mean-square adjustment for motion correction at each time point. There was no evidence of 
stimulus-correlated motion for any of the task conditions. A high-pass temporal filter (0.011 
Hz) was used to remove low-frequency oscillations in the BOLD signal time series in each 
voxel. BOLD signal was converted to percentage signal deviation from the mean signal per 
voxel.

focused attention, distraction-focused attention) were convolved with a gamma variate 
model (Cohen, 1997) of the hemodynamic response function to account for the 
hemodynamic delay to peak BOLD responses. Resultant statistical parametric maps were 
then subjected to spatial smoothing with a 4-mm3 isotropic Gaussian kernel to enhance 
signal-to-noise. The through-plane dimension of each voxel was resampled to 3.438 mm to 
create isotropic voxels. Maps were transformed to the standard Talairach space (Talairach & 
Tournoux, 1988). Second-level t tests were conducted according to a random-effects model. 
Neural results are reported for the contrast of react negative self-belief versus asterisk 
counting, breath-focused attention regulation versus react negative self-belief, and 
distraction-focused attention versus react negative self-belief.

Correction for the multiple comparisons obtained in fMRI data analysis was applied. The 
AFNI AlphaSim program, a Monte Carlo simulation bootstrapping procedure, was 
employed to identify a joint-probability threshold consisting of a voxel-wise threshold of p 
< .005 and minimum cluster-volume threshold ≥ 163 mm3 (4 voxels × 3.438 mm3) that 
resulted in protection against false positive cluster detection at p < .01 in the whole-brain 
analyses.

Results

Clinical Results

Paired t tests showed that from baseline to post-MBSR patients had decreased social 
anxiety, depression, rumination, and state anxiety, as well as increased self-esteem (see 
Table 1). There were no missing self-report responses.

Behavioral Results

Baseline—Compared with reacting to negative self-beliefs, both breath-focused attention, 
t(15) = 6.28, p < .001, and distraction-focused attention, t(15) = 7.48, p < .001, resulted in 
reduced negative emotion (see Figure 2). Negative emotion did not differ between breath- 
and distraction-focused attention regulation (p > .11).

MBSR-related changes—Paired t tests showed that from pre- to post-MBSR patients 
had no changes in self-reported negative emotion when reacting to negative self-beliefs, 
t(14) = 1.21, p > .31, and when using distraction-focused attention, t(14) = 0.41, p > .71. 
However, there was a reduction in negative emotion when implementing breath-focused 
attention from pre- to post-MBSR, t(14) = 3.25, p < .01.

Neural Results

Baseline—At baseline, a one-sample t test for the contrast of react negative self-belief 
versus asterisk counting yielded greater BOLD responses in brain regions implicated in self-
referential processing (ventromedial and dorsomedial PFC and posterior cingulate/
precuneus), emotion (right dorsal amygdala), dorsal and ventral visual processing (bilateral 
middle and inferior temporal lobes, cuneus, precuneus, angular gyrus, lingual gyrus, inferior 
and superior parietal cortex), and memory (bilateral parahippocampal gyrus). Greater BOLD

responses for asterisk counting versus react negative self-belief included posterior cingulate 
and lingual gyrus (see Figure 3 and Table 2).

MBSR-related changes—From pre- to post-MBSR, there were no results for the contrast 
of distraction-focused attention versus react negative self-beliefs. For breath-focused 
attention versus react negative self-belief, however, there were greater BOLD responses at 
post-MBSR versus pre-MBSR in brain regions implicated in visual attention (inferior and 
superior parietal lobule, cuneus, precuneus, middle occipital gyrus), as well as 
parahippocampal gyrus. There were no areas of brain activity greater for react versus breath-
focused attention (see Figure 4 and Table 3).

To better understand how MBSR training influences the effect of breath-focused attention 
on a neural index of emotional reactivity to negative self-beliefs, we investigated the BOLD 
signal time series of the right dorsal amygdala activation observed at baseline in response to 
react negative self-beliefs (see Figure 5). At baseline, there was a delay of approximately 6 s 
before amygdala activity began to ramp up toward a peak response at the end of the 12-s 
react negative self-belief component of the block. Compared with pre-MBSR, at post-MBSR 
patients with SAD demonstrated a significant decrease of right amygdala response prior to 
the cue to shift attentional focus to breath sensation.

Relations Between Clinical and Neural Domains

We examined whether MBSR-related changes in social anxiety symptom severity were 
associated with MBSR-related changes in BOLD responses for the breath-focused attention 
versus react negative self-belief contrast. Larger reductions in social anxiety symptoms over 
the course of MBSR were associated with greater BOLD responses during breath-focused 
attention versus reactivity to negative self-beliefs in visual attention brain regions, including 
medial cuneus (r = .68, p = .03), left cuneus (r = .65, p = .04), and right middle occipital 
gyrus (r = .65, p = .01).

Discussion

The goal of this study was to investigate MBSR-related changes in patients with SAD on 
behavioral and neural bases of emotional reactivity and regulation of negative self-beliefs. 
MBSR was hypothesized to reduce clinical symptoms and negative emotional reactivity to 
negative self-beliefs via reductions in brain activity related to emotion reactivity with 
increases in attention-related brain networks.

Clinical Measures

MBSR-related changes included reduction in symptoms of social anxiety, depression, 
rumination, state anxiety and increased self-esteem in adults with SAD. MBSR-related 
reductions in social anxiety symptoms have been observed previously in adults with SAD 
(Koszycki et al., 2007). MBSR-related changes for anxiety, depression, and self-esteem in 
SAD are similar to the moderate effect sizes found in a recent meta-analysis of behavioral 
and pharmacological interventions (38 studies) for SAD (Alcazar, Meca, Rodriguez, & 
Saura, 2002).

Behavioral Measures

Page 9

From pre- to post-MBSR, patients with SAD reported reduced negative emotion experience 
when implementing breath-focused attention during the fMRI experiment, but not for 
attention distraction. This suggests MBSR-related down-regulation of emotional reactivity 
to negative self-beliefs when redirecting attention to breath sensation. The lack of change 
from pre- to post-MBSR in negative emotion experience during the react negative self-belief 
condition may be due to overlearned responses (e.g., an automatic tendency to perceive 
statements about the self as threatening) to negative self-beliefs in patients with SAD. 
Similarly, the lack of change from pre- to post-MBSR in attention distraction may be due to 
its not having been a treatment focus.

Neural Measures

Baseline neural responses showed that reacting to negative self-beliefs resulted in activation 
of the midline cortical regions implicated in self-referential process, including ventromedial 
PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and posterior cingulate/precuneus (Northoff et al., 2006), as well as 
emotion (amygdala) and memory (parahippocampal gyrus) processes.

The absence of any significant MBSR-related changes in neural responses during attention 
distraction is not surprising primarily because this form of attention regulation is not trained 
during the course. In contrast, there were robust MBSR-related changes associated with 
breath-focused attention regulation in visual attention-related parietal and occipital brain 
regions, perhaps more specifically related to alerting to a stimulus (Fan, McCandliss, 
Fossella, Flombaum, & Posner, 2005). In addition, MBSR-related reductions in social 
anxiety symptom severity were associated with increased MBSR-related neural responses in 
cuneus and middle occipital brain regions implicated in visual attention. This suggests two 
possible interpretations. First, MBSR may have helped adults with SAD be more visually 
engaged in (i.e., less avoidant of) negative self-beliefs. Alternatively, greater neural 
recruitment of attention-related brain regions may be due to more refined visualization of the 
movement of the breath at the nostrils, which also involves better allocation of attention to 
the task.

Numerous studies have shown exaggerated amygdala response in adults with SAD in 
response to social anxiety-related stimuli, including harsh faces (Phan, Fitzgerald, Nathan, & 
Tancer, 2006; Stein, Goldin, Sareen, Zorrilla, & Brown, 2002) and critical comments (Blair 
et al., 2008). Furthermore, one study has demonstrated that adults with SAD who were 
classified as responders to either citalopram medication or CGBT had a reduced amygdala 
activity from baseline to posttreatment (Furmark et al., 2002).

The MBSR-related change in amygdala BOLD signal time series during react and regulate 
components suggests enhanced initial emotion reactivity or detection of emotional salience 
of negative self-beliefs as suggested by the initial amygdala spike at the post-MSBR 
assessment. The enhanced initial emotion response indexed by amygdala activity is transient 
as evidenced by a significant decrease in amygdala activity at the end of the react trials well 
before the onset of the cue to shift attention to the breath. This might reflect an effortful 
attempt to implement breath-focused attention emotion regulation at baseline and a MBSR-

related shift to a more automatic implementation of breath-focused attentional regulation 
even before being cued to do so. This highlights the possibility that one potential outcome of 
MBSR is to change specific aspects of attention regulation from explicit (i.e., more effortful) 
to an implicit (i.e., more automatic) process.

Clinical Implications

These results suggest that MBSR-related changes in attention processes may modify 
habitual reactivity in the context of negative self-beliefs. In patients with SAD who would 
normally show attentional avoidance of threat stimuli, MBSR might help attenuate 
avoidance and increase attentional allocation, as evidenced by the association of reduced 
SAD symptoms with increased neural response in visual attention-related brain regions. 
MBSR may be associated with facilitating the ability to implement attentional deployment, a 
specific emotion regulation strategy that may be aberrant in adults with SAD specifically 
when encountering social threat stimuli (Schultz & Heimberg, 2008). The ability to redirect 
attention to thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, a key feature of MBSR, may be an 
important skill for adults with SAD to develop because it may enhance the efficacy of 
exposure therapy for SAD.

Limitations and Directions for Future Research

This study is limited by the lack of a control group or active comparison clinical intervention 
that would provide a basis for making a stronger inference about how MBSR might modify 
the behavioral and neural bases of different types of emotion regulation. We examined the 
effect of attentional emotion regulation on a small set of experimenter-selected negative 
self-belief stimuli. Although the use of experimenter-selected emotional probes confers 
greater experimental control, use of participant-generated negative self-beliefs may result in 
more robust brain–behavioral responses in SAD, which could support a more ecologically 
valid test of the effects of MBSR on emotion regulation. Using idiographic stimuli can often 
provide greater fidelity to the actual clinical phenomenology under investigation. However, 
this can also provide greater variability in the specific targets of emotion regulation.

This study examined only breath-focused attention on sensation at the nostrils. There are 
many other important mindfulness practices taught in MBSR that deserve empirical 
investigation, for example, the effects of body scan meditation and mere observation of the 
changing or transient nature of experience. Thus, results from this study cannot be 
generalized to other forms of mindful attention such as mindful attention of taste, sound, 
mental states and other bodily sensations. To begin to specify how MBSR works, it may be 
instructive to compare the effects of clinical interventions with different mechanisms of 
change (e.g., cognitive disputation, acceptance, attention training) on the neural bases of 
mindful attention.

Future studies will benefit from using a randomized clinical trail methodology with at least 
two groups that undergo two types of stress reduction courses in order to delineate factors 
that might contribute to changes in attentional deployment, attention brain networks, and 
specificity of changes in clinical symptoms as well as address other potential confounds 
such as practice effects and habituation to the scanner environment. Using experimental

paradigms that present a variety of linguistic and nonlinguistic emotional probes and assess 
the effectiveness of several types of emotion regulation strategies may help delineate 
underlying mechanisms in MBSR. Furthermore, future studies should consider using self-
report measures of mindfulness pre-, during, and post-MSBR to examine change during and 
post-MBSR compared with baseline trait mindfulness.

Conducting an analysis of individual differences at baseline to enhance effective treatment 
matching to different types of meditation practices (not just mindfulness) and to different 
combinations or doses of clinical therapies (e.g., pharmacological, cognitive-behavioral, 
meditation-based interventions) would be a major contribution. Finally, understanding how 
mindfulness practice in the health care provider interacts with mindfulness practice of the 
individual receiving health care is a domain of inquiry that has not yet been investigated.
