Abstract
Moving in together is an important transition in a relationship. For many, it is often a shift to the next phase of the relationship 
indicating higher levels of commitment. Whether the partners are married, plans to get married, or marriage is not part of 
their future, there are important conversations to be had prior to this transition. As such, this article presents recommended 
pre-cohabitation conversations with question prompts for partners to explore prior to moving in together. To best understand 
the dynamics of cohabiting that informed the questions, a review of the literature on cohabitation is presented. Addition-
ally, race and culture, religion, and sexual and gender identity will be highlighted as essential conversation considerations 
especially as the majority of the literature is centered around white, hetero, and monogamous relationships. Created by a 
group of couple and family therapy graduate trainees based on the literature and their own personal and professional experi-
ences, the pre-cohabitation conversations are organized into three categories– relationship negotiations, household rules, 
and communication. These conversations are recommended to be used both by therapists with their clients as well as for 
direct use by partners following the questions presented within. The topics represent a comprehensive range of relationship 
issues including consideration of unique issues as presented in the literature with the goal of aiding partners in successful 
management of their transition to a shared living space.

Cohabitation is broadly defined as living together in an inti-
mate relationship without marriage. Despite marital status 
being the ultimate demonstration of relational commitment, 
the opportunity to marry has not always been available to 
all. For many, cohabitation was the only way to demonstrate 
such commitment; for others, it was the preference. Though 
the 5–4 decisions on June 26, 2015 in the U.S. Supreme 
Court upheld the Fourteenth Amendment requiring recogni-
tion and granting of same-sex marriages was a victory (for

love; Liptak, 2015), it did not unilaterally shift the signifi-
cance of cohabitation. Living together is an important step 
for many as they negotiate the meaning and impact cohabita-
tion has on their relationship status. This shift is true for all 
romantic constellations which are represented in this article 
through the use of inclusive terminology such as “relation-
ship” and “partners” (Jordan, 2018). The authors’ intentional 
selection of this preferred language differs from the majority 
of the literature which is centered around white, hetero, and 
monogamous relationships and is considered to be “monon-
ormative language and microaggressions” (Jordan, 2018, p. 
122). When the word “couple” is used in this paper, it is as 
a direct reference to or from the literature. Despite the now 
equality of marriage and Justice Kennedy’s declaration that 
marriage is the “keystone of our social order” (Liptak, 2015, 
para. 3), many have different experiences and values around 
marriage and may still view cohabitation as the goal for their 
relationship. The authors of this article believe that those in 
relationships decide for themselves what and how to demon-
strate commitment. We contend that cohabitation is one way

romantic constellations evolve their relationship and that it 
is a time of change for all. We recommend a deeper explora-
tion of expectations in anticipation of the shifting dynamics 
within the relationship during and after this transition.

Recent trends suggest that more relationships have opted 
to live together both before marriage or instead of marriage 
as cohabitation becomes more acceptable (Eickmeyer & 
Manning, 2017). Lichter (2010) reported that “cohabitation 
is increasingly a prelude to marriage” (p. 758). Reasons for 
this shifting trend are explored at the outset of this article 
including, for example, a concept called Sliding Vs Decid-
ing™ introduced by Stanley, Rhoades, and Markham in 
2006. This is when partners do not overtly make the decision 
to move their relationship to a shared living space, but rather 
end up cohabiting due to external circumstances without an 
overt decision. Whether they live together before marriage, 
move in after marriage, or do not plan to marry, there are 
essential conversations and important topics for the partners 
to explore. This is particularly crucial as they may underesti-
mate the importance and impact of this transition, as Lamidi 
et al. (2019) highlighted that without consideration of issues 
and negotiations, cohabiting partners are more likely to end 
their relationship.

Through an exploration of cohabitation in the literature, 
it became apparent that though the potential outcomes were 
appropriately explored, the types of topics and discussions 
that would be helpful in this transition stage were not as 
fully represented. Recommendations for essential relation-
ship questions were more often found to be pre-marital with 
assumptions that it was only with marriage that partners 
would cohabit. In response and with the goal of inclusivity, 
couple and family therapy trainees and their faculty, all with 
a variety of personal and professional experiences around 
cohabiting, co-created a list of pre-cohabitation conversation 
topics and questions to address prior to moving in together. 
The list of questions was created from both reviews of the 
literature and the collective personal and professional experi-
ences of this group of couple and family therapists. This arti-
cle could serve as a resource to both therapists for use with 
clients and/or as a tool for partners to use independently. 
The pre-cohabitation conversations also aim to fill the gap 
of resources for this specific relationship transition. Simi-
lar tools focus on pre-marital questions without considera-
tion of the impact and privilege of this narrow focus. These 
important topics for partners to attend to prior to moving in 
together are organized into three categories—relationship 
negotiations, household rules, and communication—with 
questions for exploration across each grouping.

As the literature on cohabiting highlighted concerns about 
the lack of commitment in relationships who live together 
without marriage (Stanley et al., 2006), the goal of these 
conversations is to aid partners in successfully bringing their 
lives together while creating a shared narrative with explicit 

understanding of the meaning of cohabitation including 
roles and responsibilities. This may be especially important 
with cohabitation on the rise and common perceptions from 
younger generations that it prevents divorce and is seen as a 
“good trial run for marriage” (Bagley et al., 2020, p. 284). 
Further, by co-creating these questions from a collective and 
wide range of identities and experiences as well as a critical 
look at the literature, the goal was to continue to decenter 
the singular identity of the white, heterosexual, and monoga-
mous couple as presented in the majority of the literature 
and expand the definition of romantic constellations to be 
inclusive of all partners and relationships.

Literature Review

Statistical information demonstrates that cohabiting is a 
trend that has been shifting, especially in the U.S., where the 
numbers of those living together without marriage is on the 
rise (Horowitz et al., 2019). The Pew Research Center sur-
veyed adults between 18 and 44 years of age in 2013 through 
2017 (n = 9,834) discovering that 69% find it acceptable 
to live together without marriage (Horowitz et al., 2019). 
Another 16% of adults report cohabiting to be acceptable if 
they plan to marry while 14% of adults say it is never accept-
able to live together without marriage regardless of their 
plans for the future (Horowitz et al., 2019). These statistics 
highlight perceptions of cohabitation found in the literature 
while actual numbers of those who are cohabiting are also 
on the rise. Stanley et al. (2006) reported 50–60% of partners 
live together before marriage. Lichter (2010) revealed that 
“nearly one-half of American women of reproductive age are 
either currently cohabiting or have premaritally cohabited 
in the past” (p. 747). Utilizing the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, Wagner (2019) found 
that younger generations considered cohabitation as less of a 
commitment when they are not ready for marriage, or as an 
alternative to marriage. Cohabitation is also increasing for 
older adults that live together later in life as the number of 
people ohabiting over the age of 50 increased by 75% from 
2007 to 2016 (Horowitz et al., 2019).

Amato (2015) determined that non-marital cohabitation 
provides many of the same benefits as marriage including 
“companionship, intimacy and everyday assistance. And 
like married couples, cohabiting relationships [also] ben-
efit financially” (pp. 6–7). Pirani and Vignoli (2016) looked 
at relationship satisfaction from a longevity perspective (in 
Italy) and found that “since 2011 cohabitors are no longer 
less satisfied with their family life than married people” (p. 
607). Cohabitation has also had an impact on subsequent 
marriage; Eickmeyer and Manning (2017) found that the 
numbers of cohabiting relationships that transition to mar-
riage have decreased, “only one-third of recent cohabiting

cohorts’ transition to marriage by five years compared to 
over half (57%) in the 1980s” (p. 60). Research also provided 
varying information on the “success” of cohabiting, which is 
defined by the literature as marriage, to the “failures” which 
ranged from breaking up or living together with no plans to 
marry. This dyadic idea of success and failure around cohab-
itation does not incorporate the many relationship identities 
and decisions along the spectrum between cohabitation and 
marriage that were the focus in the development of these 
pre-cohabitation conversations.

Cohabitation

Factors that often influence the decision to live together 
included sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, com-
mitment, relationship stability, relationship attitudes, and 
communication (Busby et al., 2019). These elements of a 
relationship are recommended to be at the forefront for dis-
cussion before officially moving in together, however it is 
very possible for people to move in without any considera-
tion or conversation of any of these issues. First introduced 
by Stanley et al. (2006), this is called Sliding Vs Deciding™ 
which describes a “phenomenon of moving through relation-
ship transitions such as cohabitation without fully consid-
ering the implications” (p. 506). In the process of sliding, 
partners may find themselves sharing a living space without 
an overt conversation or decision. This can cause a lack of 
clarity about the reason and partners could have differing or 
even opposing beliefs about the purpose and significance of 
living together as well as the future path of their relation-
ship. Stanley et al. (2010) stated that in a national sample of 
those cohabiting, 66% reported that they had slid into their 
living arrangements.

Contextual  factors  in  sliding  situations  like  this  may 
include job loss or housing issues for one partner that results 
in moving in together without a specific decision. Other 
examples of sliding are when one partner stays the night 
at the other’s home and all of sudden all of their belong-
ings are there and they do not go home anymore, or one 
partner’s lease has ended, and they find themselves living 
together earlier than they might have overtly decided. Rea-
sons range from internal mechanisms to external timelines 
that have dictated this transition. With a significantly grow-
ing number of partners sliding into cohabitation, there is a 
missed opportunity for intentionality in moving through this 
transition that could have positive benefits for the future of 
the relationship. The pre-cohabitation conversations invite 
a thorough understanding and investigation of common and 
potential relationship risks, encourage engagement in shared 
meaning making of commitment and future-oriented plans, 
and an exploration of the intersections of their individual 
identities as the partners form a household.

Risks of Cohabiting

Though perception of cohabitation is improving and num-
bers of those living together (without marriage) are increas-
ing, it is important to acknowledge that cohabitation has 
been linked to negative relationship outcomes. Busby et al. 
(2019) found this to be especially true when the cohabiting 
does not have the goal of marriage as marriage can represent 
a shared and articulated goal. Busby et al. (2019) realized 
that the more clearly the goals, wants, needs, and commit-
ment are communicated, the more successful the cohabita-
tion will be. Without this, partners who cohabit may experi-
ence higher levels of conflict which contributes to relational 
problems. Inertia theory, the idea that “couples who other-
wise would not have married end up married partly because 
they cohabit” (Stanley et al., 2006, p. 503), may account 
for why these incompatible cohabiting relationships even-
tually marry and then divorce supporting the negative, yet 
not accurately represented, consequences of cohabitation. 
Stanley et al. (2006) further found that “the inertia perspec-
tive suggests that some relationship transitions increase 
constraints and favor relationship continuance regardless of 
fit, knowledge of possible relationship problems, or mutual 
clarity about commitment to the future of a relationship” 
(p. 502). As cohabitation (and not marriage or cohabitation 
without marriage) could place these same constraints on a 
relationship, the application of these findings supports the 
importance of intentionality around expectations for both 
living together and the impact of cohabitation on the future 
of the relationship.

Stanley et al. (2006) also pointed to earlier studies (e.g. 
Axinn & Thornton, 1992) on cohabiting as examples of the 
cohabiting effect, which is the belief that the act of cohabit-
ing (before marriage) itself was the reason for poorer marital 
outcomes. Critiquing these findings through the lens of the 
inertia theory, Stanley et al. (2006) noted that rather than 
evidence as a direct attack on cohabitation, living with a 
partner for a long time and/or with multiple partners, i.e., 
serial cohabiting, leads to “erosion of esteem or valuing of 
marriage and childrearing over time” (p. 500) as well as 
decreasing marital motivation and commitment. As many 
of the early studies on cohabitation were evaluated through 
the lens that marriage is the ultimate goal of relationships, 
those  who  successfully  live  together  without  marriage 
may also have been considered as a failed relationship. For 
many, there are different levels of expectations and purposes 
between cohabiting and marriage as well as an incongruence 
with the construct of marriage which can make the choice to 
live together more appealing.

Busby et al. (2019) determined further risk in the lack 
of conversation, as well as the casualness of dating and 
sex within partnerships, which were more often affiliated 
with cohabiting than with marriage. Horowitz et al. (2019) 

1 3134

looked at levels of trust and satisfaction amongst partner-
ships determining that these factors are higher for married 
versus cohabiting relationships; they found 74% of those 
married versus 58% of those cohabiting believe their partner 
has their best interest, and that 68% of those married believe 
their  partner  always  tells  the  truth  versus  54%  of  those 
cohabiting. Statistics like these highlighted the necessity of 
transparency and compromise at the outset of a relationship 
which has been found to be absent in the high numbers of 
relationships that slide into living together. Other examples 
included 56% of those married believe their partner handles 
money responsibly versus 40% of those cohabiting and 46% 
of those married believe that household chores are divided 
equally versus 34% of those cohabiting (Horowitz et al., 
2019). This research suggests that both finances and chores 
are examples of essential topics to overtly discuss not only 
before moving in together but to maintain as ongoing nego-
tiations and compromise as part of sharing a household. By 
incorporating these research findings into the development 
of the pre-cohabitation conversations, the goal is to discuss 
these preventatively to remediate risk factors of cohabitation 
as well as create a framework and skill for ongoing relation-
ship conversations. By acknowledging the listed threats and 
removing marriage as the only defined success of cohabita-
tion, the pre-cohabitation conversations encourage partners 
to create their own definitions of a successful relationship.

Commitment and Impact on Marriage

Though living together has been found to be beneficial to 
mental health including such benefits as companionship 
and financial partnership, research has shown that there are 
lower levels of commitment from cohabiting people (Amato, 
2015). Stanley and Markham (1992) proposed the idea of 
commitment theory early on in their decades of research on 
relationships. Commitment theory is the individual weigh-
ing of dedication (level of commitment) versus constraints 
(barriers to leaving) in a relationship (Stanley and Markham 
1992).  This  is  connected  to  the  cohabiting  effect  which 
maintains that cohabiting partners tended to stay together 
because it was easier than breaking up, demonstrating high 
constraint and low dedication (Stanley et al., 2006). In rede-
fining commitment as individual to each relationship rather 
than marriage as the ultimate goal, these pre-cohabitation 
conversations aspire to view relationships through a lens of 
social justice which is inclusive of all rather than shaped by 
societal expectations.

Stanley et al. (2006) further clarified that the ambiguous 
nature of cohabiting does not on its own inherently increase 
dedication to the relationship, but it is the act of moving in 
together that significantly increases constraints to ending the 
relationship. Therefore, Stanley et al. (2006) established that 
“cohabiting itself may not cause risks as much as it makes 

it harder to terminate a riskier union” (p. 504), resulting in 
partners who may stay together simply because it is harder 
to leave the relationship. With cohabitation due to Sliding 
Vs Deciding™ occurring at such high rates suggests that it is 
the lack of forethought rather than the actual act of cohabita-
tion that could be resulting in such findings. Stanley et al. 
(2006) states.

One  of  the  most  important  suggestions  to  emerge 
from the inertia perspective is that couples should 
talk candidly about the meaning of cohabiting, com-
mitment levels (e.g., where does each partner see the 
relationship headed?), and potential constraints to stay 
together that they might experience during cohabita-
tion. (p. 507)

The history and shift of the meaning of cohabitation and 
the findings presented around the risks supported the crea-
tion of the pre-cohabitation conversations presented in this 
article as essential to not only the process, but also to form-
ing a relationship built on a foundation of co-defined com-
mitment. In furthering the development of the pre-cohabita-
tion conversations, a deeper look at marginalized identities 
and relationships to incorporate an understanding of both 
the historical hazards and successes of cohabitation across 
identities is presented.

Considerations for Marginalized Identities 
and Relationships

When partners move through various transitions in their 
relationship, it impacts those around them including their 
family of origin, their social location, and their professional 
identities; these transitions are also conversely informed by 
each of these factors. Important to the decision to move in 
together are consideration of each of their individual and 
shared identities, values, and traditions that they bring to 
the relationship. Historically, gender has been utilized as a 
lens through which to view decisions for cohabiting, what 
cohabitation means, and division of household roles, e.g. 
men take out the trash and women do the cooking. Addition-
ally important to understand is the learned messages about 
gender that the partners were bringing into the relationship. 
In developing the pre-cohabitation conversations, race and 
culture, religion, gender and sexual identity, and relationship 
structure were also considered despite a lack of literature 
specifically focusing on cohabitation within these identities.

Race  and  Culture  Of  the  discovered  literature,  represen-
tation  was  limited  further  marginalizing  experiences  of 
cohabitation  for  Black,  Indigenous,  and  People  of  Color 
(BIPOC)  as  well  as  interracial  and  intercultural  relation-
ships. Though rates of marriage through a racial and cultural 
lens were presented in the previously mentioned study by the 

1 3Contemporary Family Therapy (2023) 45:131–145 

135

Pew Research Center as reported by Horowitz et al. (2019), 
the demographics included no further specific information 
other than approximately 25% of the participants (n = 9,834) 
were nonwhite and an acknowledgement of an underrepre-
sentation of diversity (Keeter, 2019). Though the authors of 
this article acknowledge these limitations, the lack of repre-
sentation in the literature on cohabitation invites considera-
tion of these findings. Horowitz et al. (2019) reported that 
55% of White adults ages 18–44 have never been married, as 
have 48% of Latinx adults. By contrast, only 34% of Black 
adults  have  been  married  (Horowitz  et  al.,  2019).  Differ-
ences across racial and ethnic groups are more modest for 
living together: 62% of white adults have cohabited, com-
pared with 59% of Black adults and 56%  of Latinx adults 
(Horowitz  et  al.,  2019).  This  sampling  illustrates  a  higher 
percentage  of  cohabitation  experiences  in  comparison  to 
marriage and rates of cohabitation across white, Black, and 
Latinx respondents to be more similar.

The literature revealed very little of this specific perspec-
tive of cohabitation and race. For example, in a dated article, 
Schoen and Weinick (1993) utilized the 1987–99 National 
Survey of Families and Households, where racial demo-
graphics was limited to the binary of “black and nonblack” 
(p. 411). In reviewing more expansive research on cohabita-
tion, articles seemed to be consistently confirming very little 
differences regarding rates of cohabitation across race and 
culture though the continued absence of representation of, 
e.g., Asian and Pacific Islanders, Indigenous, Native, and 
Multiethnic experiences was noted. For example, in their 
research on rates of serial cohabitation, Lichter et al. (2010) 
accounted for factors such as education and family structure 
in childhood as they found that women without a degree and 
women whose parents separated have higher odds of serial 
cohabiting. Further, Kennedy and Bumpass (2008), who 
looked at cohabitation and children’s living arrangements, 
found that across racial identities women live with their 
partners at similar rates and “the lengthening of cohabita-
tion occurred universally across race and ethnic groups” (p. 
1674). Understanding that perception of rates of cohabita-
tion may not have been influenced by race and culture due to 
lack of representation focused the development of the pre-
cohabitation conversations on individuals and expectations 
that may be informed by these identities.

Religion  When partners identify a shared religion to be at 
the core of their identity, benefits may include a strengthened 
relationship  by  reinforcing  affective  bonds  through  a  joint 
activity  (Henderson  et  al.,  2018).  Holding  a  shared  belief 
system may not only promote more meaningful interactions 
but may also help when it comes to finding areas of agree-
ments, for example, around children, financial, and house-
hold issues, etc. (Henderson et al., 2018). However, shared 
religious identities is not necessary for a successful relation-

ship. Though benefits such as these have been presented in 
the literature supporting partners share this identity, religion 
has  been  primarily  “identified  as  an  important  source  in 
opposition to nonmarital cohabitation and sex” (Henderson 
et al., 2018, p. 1909). As such, many religions do not endorse 
cohabiting (Xu et al., 2005) and highly religious people are 
less likely to live together prior to marriage (Stanley et al., 
2004).  Not  only  does  this  keep  those  who  identify  within 
those religious beliefs from cohabiting, Gault-Sherman and 
Draper  (2012)  found  that  “regardless  of  one’s  individual 
beliefs regarding cohabitation, the existence of a large group 
of religious others may prevent many from cohabiting in an 
effort to avoid embarrassment or social sanctions” (p. 62). 
Henderson et al. (2018) found that conservative Protestants 
and  Latter-day  Saints  tend  to  be  the  most  against  sexual 
activity before marriage and are therefore less likely to favor 
cohabiting. But this stance assumes that the decision to live 
together  represents  the  decision  to  engage  in  sex.  Cohab-
iting romantic constellations can include relationships that 
live together without sex. For example, asexual individuals 
or relationships that are waiting for marriage regardless of 
their cohabitation status.

In  reviewing  the  literature  on  cohabitation  and  reli-
gion, the limited findings were centered around Christian 
denominations. Though both Henderson et al. (2018) and 
Rougeaux-Burnes (2013) focused on shared religious beliefs 
and affiliation and influence on decision-making, absent 
were specific explorations of a diversity of faith and spir-
ituality with cohabitation. Higher levels of satisfaction in 
relationships were found in Henderson et al.’s (2018) exami-
nation of the National Survey of Religion and Family Life 
(n = 468) with 42% of African American respondents. The 
researchers found that “shared religious beliefs may foster 
intimacy, making it easier for couples to treat one another 
with  love,  affection,  and  respect”  (p.  1922).  Rougeaux-
Burnes (2013) discovered that “religion or cultural customs” 
received the greatest levels of response from college-age 
participants with “approximately one-third of both male 
and female respondents [having] selected this factor as their 
reason to not live with a romantic partner” (p. 57). Demon-
strating the influence of religion, the two primary responses 
to  factors  that  prevented  partners  from  deciding  to  live 
together without or prior to marriage included their morals 
and values as well as fear for the future (Rougeaux-Burnes, 
2013). In narrative responses to this mixed methods study, 
Rougeaux-Burnes (2013) found that five females highlighted 
cohabiting as consistent with “non religious morals [sic]” 
and “not believing in sexual relations before marriage” (p. 
59). Conversely, Horowitz et al. (2019) identified in the 
Pew Research Center data that 74% of Catholics and white 
Protestants, who do not self-identify as born-again or Evan-
gelical, say it is acceptable for unmarried partners to live 
together with or without a plan to marry. The literature on 

1 3136

religion and cohabitation seems to be highlighting a deter-
mining impact on the decision to live together, especially in 
regards to sex before marriage. Differing religious beliefs 
across different faiths may also influence the negotiations—
both content and style—partners bring to decisions around 
cohabitation, their shared household, and how this shift may 
change their relationship.

Sexual  and  Gender  Identity  Research  has  historically 
focused on heterosexual couples and traditional gender roles 
(Addison & Coolhart, 2015) especially within understand-
ing  cohabitation.  Understanding  relationships  of  different 
identities  and  romantic  constellation  structures  including 
same-sex, transgender and non-binary individuals, consen-
sually non-monogamous relationships which is inclusive of 
open, swinging, and polyamory (Jordan, 2018) were essen-
tial  to  the  development  of  the  pre-cohabitation  conversa-
tions. Despite this importance, there was a significant gap in 
the literature though several attempts at queering processes 
(e.g. Oswald et al., 2005) specifically challenged this within 
family therapy. For example, Jordan (2018) highlights that 
“a simple indication of monogamy’s pervasiveness exists in 
our  professional  titling  as  marriage  and  family  therapists” 
(p.  109).  The  creation  of  these  pre-cohabitation  conversa-
tions embraces Oswald et al.’s (2005) recommendations to 
view this transition to a shared living space through a queer 
lens in spite of the lack of representation.

In the Pew Research Center’s findings as presented by 
Horowitz et al. (2019) throughout this article, the goal was 
to conduct a nationally representative survey. But, in their 
sample of the 5579 married adults and 880 adults who were 
living with an unmarried partner, only 9% of the participants 
identified as same-sex relationships. Further descriptions 
of different sexual and gender identities did not appear to 
be included. Due to this small sample size, Horowitz et al. 
(2019) was unable to draw comparisons between same-sex 
and opposite-sex relationships or present any specific finding 
significant to this population’s experiences of cohabitation. 
This is especially important because prior to same-sex part-
ners’ ability to legally marry in 2015, their primary pres-
entation as a committed relationship was most often signi-
fied by cohabitation. As such, the available data for those in 
heteronormative couples is astronomical compared to that 
of same-sex relationships. Further, the lack of diversity of 
sexual and gender identity beyond same-sex partners further 
widens this gap in the literature.

In  one  of  only  a  few  studies  on  cohabiting  same-sex 
partners, Kurdek (2004) found their relationships were not 
significantly different then heterosexual relationships on 
measures of psychological adjustment, personality traits, 
relationship styles, conflict resolution, and social support. 
In a study of same-sex partners on the significance of living 
together and the importance of marriage, Haas and Whitton 

(2015) found that same-sex relationships reported four major 
themes in regard to the significance of living with their part-
ner: cohabitation symbolized commitment, provided emo-
tional support, made them a family, and they were able to 
share a life together. Many participants in the study con-
sidered cohabiting to be a big step in their relationship that 
was taken seriously and discussed (Haas & Whitton, 2015) 
in opposition to those who would slide into cohabitation. In 
states where same-sex marriage was not legal at the time of 
their publication, Haas and Whitton (2015) also reported that 
participants viewed living together as “the strongest level of 
commitment available” on par to marriage (p. 1249). In the 
same study, 90% of cohabiting same-sex partners reported 
that marriage was important to their relationship for reasons 
such as legal benefits and financial protections, relationship 
legitimacy, equal rights, and relationship validation, indi-
cating that many same-sex partners who live together may 
decide to marry when given the option (Haas & Whitton, 
2015).

Manning  et  al.  (2016)  looked  at  same-sex  partners 
“because relationship stability is a key indicator of well-
being among different-sex couples” (p. 938) and confirmed 
that weaker social and legal support may create greater 
instability in same-sex relationships but ultimately deter-
mining both “cohabiting unions appear similarly stable” (p. 
951). In this study, Manning et al. (2016) had 2283 partners 
ranging in age from 16 to 87 years old of which 126 par-
ticipants identified as same-sex partners. It is important to 
note that some of these people lived in states (in Europe) 
that did not legalize marriage or support cohabiting for 
same-sex partners. In terms of sociodemographic factors, 
same-sex cohabiting partners had higher levels of educa-
tion and higher household income than different-sex partners 
(Manning et al., 2016). Looking further into this study there 
was no statistical difference in levels of stability for same-
sex relationships. The findings were not reliable with their 
hypothesis of higher stability for same-sex partners due to 
having a more advantaged sociodemographic standing to 
different-sex partners.

Consensual Non-Monogamous Relationship Structures 
More recent literature intended to be inclusive still falls 
short by continuing to operate under the dyadic assumption 
that a relationship only includes two individuals. Consen-
sual non-monogamy (CNM) has recently gained increased 
levels of visibility in mainstream U.S. media but remains a 
marginalized population despite 4–5% of individuals in the 
U. S. self-identifying as being in a consensually non-monog-
amous relationship (Conley et al., 2013). Prior to this more 
recent understanding of CNM, these relationship structures 
were often viewed through a lens of infidelity. Individuals 
in CNM relationships have multiple partners which may 
or may not include sex, romance, partnership, love, etc. or 
any combination of the above with the understanding and 

1 3Contemporary Family Therapy (2023) 45:131–145 

137

consent of each person involved (Conley et al., 2013). Those 
in CNM relationships may live on their own, live with one 
partner (often called a “primary partner” or “nesting part-
ner”), or live with multiple partners. However, in this review 
of the literature, specific studies on CNM relationships and 
cohabitation were absent. As such the relationship between 
CNM and cohabitation remains unstudied and is included 
in future ideas for research. Despite the gap in the literature, 
questions regarding expansion of the relationship struc-
ture are included in the pre-cohabitation conversations for 
discussion.

Development of Pre‑Cohabitation 
Conversations

Prior research has been done on the outcomes around the 
overt decision to live together including a look at the deci-
sion-making process. Priem et al. (2015) looked specifi-
cally at the deciding conversations of non-engaged cohabit-
ing relationships. The authors reported that 84% did have 
a conversation prior to cohabiting based on yes/no self-
report; they then analyzed conversations finding the length 
and content to vary significantly (Priem et al., 2015). Priem 
et al. (2015) organized coded conversations of participants 
across three themes—relational topics, logistical topics, and 
justification topics. Relational topics included “deciding” 
conversations, such as the implications of cohabiting, lev-
els of commitment in the relationship, and family reactions 
and support, which indicated a more serious contemplation 
of the decision to live together (Priem et al., 2015). Con-
versely, both logistical (where they would live) and justi-
fication (ease/convenience) topics were found to indicate a 
sliding conversation, in which cohabiting was assumed and 
the reported conversation centered more around how the 
cohabiting would work (Priem et al., 2015). Even among 
partners who reported having had a conversation prior to 
living together, the content and purpose of these conversa-
tions varied widely. Nonetheless Owen et al. (2013) found 
that “regardless of relationship status… those who reported 
more thoughtful decision-making processes also reported 
more dedication to their partners, higher satisfaction with 
the relationship, and fewer extradyadic involvements” (p. 
135). This supports the need and positive benefits of creat-
ing structured pre-cohabitation conversations as presented 
in this article especially as there is a lack of resources for 
this specific transition; available relationship questions have 
been specifically targeted and created for pre-marital con-
versations. This focus precludes many of the identities who 
have been left out.

Though the literature on cohabitation provided a richness 
of information, there is not only a gap in the representa-
tion of all romantic constellations and identities but also 

consideration of the many day-to-day negotiations partners 
navigate. Risks, impact on commitment and marriage, and 
exploration of marginalized identities as presented in the 
literature review was found to be lacking not only an inclu-
sive definition of relationships, but also considerations of 
“everyday” issues such as transportation, pets, decorating, or 
guests. A group of graduate trainees within the COAMFTE-
accredited foundational course in the MA in Couple and 
Family Therapy at Adler University specifically filled these 
gaps as part of an in-class activity of the required relation-
ship course. A total of 17 students (one was absent that day) 
across two sections had the same task to review readings 
assigned for class on cohabitation, i.e., a preliminary litera-
ture review, and then break into small groups with the goal 
of developing essential questions and conversation topics for 
partners to discuss prior to moving in together. The groups 
came together within each section to develop a complete list. 
One section of the class created a list of topics and ques-
tions in the following categories: family of origin traditions 
and routines, chores, transportation, finances, guests/pets, 
expectations around spending time together and apart, com-
munication, social media, and the future of the relationship 
and other decisions. The second section went through the 
same process and developed the following categories: bal-
ance and compromise, expectations of intimacy, privacy and 
individual identity, budgeting, views on the future includ-
ing the relationship and understanding each other’s goals 
and families, and communication. With overlapping themes 
as well as unique topics in each group, the two lists were 
merged by one student, and then further organized by the 
first author into three categories of pre-cohabitation con-
versations focusing on relationship negotiations, household 
rules, and communication.

As the questions were created from both the collective 
preliminary review of the literature, a more in-depth review 
by the authors of this article, and the collaboration of cou-
ple and therapy graduate trainees, it is important for the 
creators of the questions to provide their social location and 
experiences with cohabitation. Demographics presented in 
Table 1 are of the 17 contributors to the development of the 
pre-cohabitation topics for conversation including the demo-
graphics of the professor as they also contributed from their 
own personal and professional experiences.

The contributors also provided information about their 
experiences of cohabiting at the time the topics were devel-
oped—13  had  previous  experiences  of  living  together 
including two who had lived with more than one partner 
for a total of 15 separate experiences of cohabiting. These 
cohabitations  lasted  from  8  to  44  months  with  an  aver-
age of 20.2 months. Four led to an engagement with three 
marriages and the fourth was engaged (prior to moving 
in together) with a set wedding date. Another disclosed 
that cohabiting, not marriage, was the shared goal of their

cohabiting experiences resulted in the ending of their rela-
tionship with two clarifying that the relationship ended, but 
“not directly after [living together].”

Pre‑Cohabitation Conversations

Not only are each of the three categories comprehensive rep-
resenting the wide exploration of cohabitation research and 
experiences, but they are also organized sequentially though 
partners can also skip around as well as go back and forth. 
The different topics include open-ended questions to encour-
age conversation. Those in a relationship are first encouraged 

to define what cohabitation means for each of them, their 
partnership, and the future for them individually and as a 
relationship. Understanding this helps the relationship move 
into the first category of questions, relationship negotiations. 
Throughout the first category, partners build on their foun-
dational definition of cohabitation and further consider the 
purpose of living together by talking about intimacy and 
family of origin including their individual and relationship 
identities. Suggested questions within each of these topics 
are listed in Table 2. Though the recommendation is to begin 
the conversation by defining cohabitation, this definition will 
be revised and refined as partners learn more about each 
other, their intentions for moving in together, and as they 
progress through the questions.

The second category of pre-cohabitation conversations 
focuses on household roles beginning with questions and 
negotiations around chores, finances, transportation, pets, 
and guests. When partners develop arrangements around 
topics listed in this second category, it is recommended that 
they begin with each person’s strengths and then frequently 
revisit the division of responsibilities to check in. For exam-
ple, if the partners divide chores, some people love to cook 
but hate to schedule and plan the meals or shop for ingre-
dients. They could allocate roles aligned with these prefer-
ences and then revisit the arrangements six weeks later to see 
how each person is doing with their responsibilities. Further 
revisions to allocation of chores can be made as needed. 
Table 3 lists the different recommended questions in the 
negotiation of household roles including chores, finances, 
transportation, pets, and guests as well as specific examples 
of considerations under each.

Communication is essential to this process even though it 
is included as the third category. Basic rules for communica-
tion include speaker/listener and understanding intent and 
impact as necessary skills. This third category is specifically 
about the rules around communication, better understand-
ing each other’s communication needs and styles, and then 
specific topics for discussion. This category intends to also 
encourage conversation about more emotionally laden issues 
like the logistics of living together and future-oriented con-
versations about goals and plans. By sequentially including 
these topics in the third category, the intention is for the 
partners to have developed and practiced communication 
skills moving through the first two categories as well as 
gained a deeper and shared understanding of this transition 
to cohabitation, each other, and their relationship.

Though this can feel counter-productive, it is also recom-
mended that the partners talk about potential “exit strate-
gies” if living together is not working out. This could either 
signal the end of the relationship, or they realize they were 
not yet ready to move in together and should slow down their 
timeline. By talking about this prior to sharing a household, 
they may adjust their relationship plans as a result or move

into cohabitation with greater confidence. Table 4 includes 
recommended questions around different communication 
topics.

In many ways, these three categories of pre-cohabitation 
conversations could be seen as a verbal contract; it asks the 
partners to share both their hopes and their expectations of 
this transition in their relationship. As part of this “con-
tract,” it is important to schedule “check-ins” as described 
above with negotiations. Relationships are fluid and change. 
Check-ins are advised to occur frequently at the start of liv-
ing together, i.e., every six weeks for the first six months, 
and then again both when problems arise as well as when 
life(stage)  changes  occur.  Examples  of  changes  include 
engagements, marriage, children, loss (e.g., family mem-
bers or employment, moving (upsizing and downsizing), etc. 
Partners are also encouraged to revisit these three catego-
ries or any specific questions within a category as well as 
any additional topics that may have emerged during these 
conversations that are important to their specific romantic 
constellation and negotiated relationship.

Recommendations for Therapists 
and Couples

The developed list of pre-cohabitation conversation ques-
tions was created to be utilized prior to moving in together. 
Therapists may use these questions as prescribed in therapy 

or modify them to meet each specific relationship’s needs. 
These topics may also be used directly by partners (without 
a therapist) in their developing relationship as they come 
to know more about each other and make decisions about 
their shared path. These conversation categories may also 
be adapted for use in times of duress to help re-center the 
relationship. For example, with struggling relationships, 
Stanley et al. (2006) recommends exploring clients’ his-
tories including an assessment for Sliding Vs Deciding™ 
around not only cohabiting, but also other major life deci-
sions such as having sex, becoming monogamous, having 
children, etc., or the possibility of inertia-based reasons for 
moving in together or staying together. A single category 
or questions from different categories can also be focused 
on according to their struggles, life transitions, or places of 
desired growth. For example, empty nesters may revisit the 
household roles category as the family members who share 
the roles and responsibilities shift—who will take the trash 
out now that the designated child chores have shifted back 
to the empty-nester parents?

At the core of these pre-cohabitation conversations is 
an invitation for the relationship to develop a cohesive and 
shared identity practicing not only communication skills, 
but also navigating negotiation, compromise, collaboration, 
and disagreement. By utilizing this structured approach, 
partners can practice and develop their own rhythm for use 
throughout their relationship. For example, “therapists could 
work with clients to build awareness of their expectations for

relationships, identify current and past relationship dynam-
ics or schemas that may influence the decision-making pro-
cess, and empower clients to make healthy decisions” (Owen 
et al., 2013, p. 146). Though these categories of questions 
are geared toward creating conversation within the relation-
ship, it is also valuable for use with singles and those seek-
ing out relationships, specifically aiding in understanding 
one’s own intentionality about dating and their desires and 
needs from a partner.

Diversity Limitations

Many of the studies referenced in the review of the literature 
lack perspectives on diversity in cohabiting; most are based 
on white, heterosexual, and monogamous two-person rela-
tionship structures, i.e., couples. The authors intentionally 
used the words “partner(s)” and “relationship” to decenter 
the exclusivity of the word “couples” as represented in the 
literature. Early studies addressed religion and faith and 
the intersection of these values around cohabitation prior 
to marriage, but there is also importance in understanding 
racial and culturally informed beliefs about cohabiting. Sev-
eral studies did look through a gendered lens regarding the 
differences between men and women and cohabitation, but 
the majority of the literature is skewed heteronormatively 
(Allen & Mendez, 2018) and does not include the expe-
riences of transgender and non-binary individuals. Future 
research is encouraged to better understand both the values 
that individuals bring to the relationship that are inherently 
part of their racial, cultural, and religious identity, but also 
the differences for partners of varying sexual and gender 
identities.

An additional limitation of the presented topics for dis-
cussion is the exclusion of issues specific to those who cur-
rently have children. Avellar and Smock (2005) reported that 
40% of households have at least one child. Bumpass and 
Lu (2000) report that 40% of children are likely to live in 
a cohabiting household—not marital—at one time in their 
life. The inclusion of children in cohabiting relationships 
is a delicate process that requires significant discussion, 
preparation, and planning that is beyond the scope of this 
article. There are also additional legal implications regarding 

parenting and decision-making in non-married relationships 
or for partners who bring a child into the relationship and 
home from a previous relationship. These issues require 
additional negotiation that is not included in the pre-cohab-
itation conversation questions.

Future Research

Future research ideas include studying the impact of using 
the list of pre-cohabitation conversations and soliciting feed-
back both from those in relationships and therapists as well 
as individuals who have utilized the lists in the different 
ways prescribed. By exploring the application of the pre-
cohabitation conversations specifically with those deciding 
to move in together, the goal would be to determine if the 
process solidifies and assists partners in making this deci-
sion regardless of the results. It may be that the process will 
help partners decide not to move in together due to conflict-
ing ideas, values, and opinions which is an equally valuable 
outcome. Follow-up research could also help determine how 
the different categories fit their relationships, if partners are 
able to adhere to negotiations, decisions, and definitions 
developed throughout the process, and how their commu-
nication skills are impacted. This would also allow refine-
ment of the categories and the questions. Now that marriage 
is available to all dyadic partnerships in the United States, 
also of interest is how the meaning of cohabitation for same-
sex relationships shifted or whether cohabitation remains 
as highly a significant decision as previous to 2015 as well 
as what this meant for romantic constellations larger than a 
dyad. Additionally, it is recommended that future research 
embrace a feminist and queer approach to continue to high-
light the voices of those marginalized identities, including 
race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and relationship 
structures.

Unique to the timing of this article is also the coronavi-
rus pandemic. During this time, there are many who may 
have moved in together due to external pressures of quar-
antine and shelter-in-place. Higher numbers of relation-
ships may be sliding into living together rather than mak-
ing an intentional decision because of the constraints of 
COVID-19. Additionally, many relationships may not have

Conclusion

Without strong communication skills and practiced space to 
engage in difficult conversations, many romantic constella-
tions may struggle through the shifts and transitions in their 
relationship. Many partners either do not take the time or 
are not afforded the time to have overt and transparent con-
versations about their relationship and its future. Though the 
literature recommends intentionality with overt discussions 
especially in the transition to marriage (Owens et al., 2013; 
Stanley et al., 2006), these pre-cohabitation conversations 
fill the gap providing an informed tool to be used by thera-
pists and relationships. For many, cohabitation may be the 
earliest significant transition in a partnership. By focusing 
on this stage, the developed pre-cohabitation conversations 
create opportunity for discussion and development of skills 
that could be beneficial throughout the relationship.
