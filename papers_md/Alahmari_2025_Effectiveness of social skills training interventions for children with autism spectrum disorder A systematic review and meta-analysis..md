Objectives:  To  evaluatethe  effectiveness  of  social  skills 
training  )SST(  interventions  for  children  with  autism 
spectrum disorder )ASD(.

Methods:  A  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  were 
carried out to identify relevant studies published between 
2000-2023. The study was conductedin accordance with 
the  PRISMA  guidelines.  Studies  were  included  if  they 
met the following criteria: randomized controlled trials 
)RCTs( or quasi-RCTs, participants were children with 
ASD aged 3-18 years, SST interventions were delivered 
individually or in groups, and social skills were assessed 
using standardized measures. Effect sizes were calculated 
using  Cohen’s  d,  and  meta-analyses  were  carried  out 
using a random-effects model.

Results:  A  total  of  17  studies  were  included  in 
the  meta-analysis.  The  overall  effect  size  for  SST 

interventions  was  0.28-0.60  )95%  confidence  interval: 
[0.23-0.41](, indicating a small to moderate effect. Social 
skills training interventions were effective in improving 
a range of social skills, including social communication, 
reciprocity, and joint attention.

demonstrate  modest  to  moderate  effectiveness 
improving  social  skills  in  children  with  ASD,  with 
outcomes  varying  depending  on  intervention  type, 
participant characteristics, and implementation fidelity. 
While  SST  interventions  offer  potential  benefits,  they 
should  be  considered  as  one  component  of  a  broader, 
individualized  treatment  plan  for  children  with  ASD, 
rather than a standalone solution.

Effectiveness of SST for children with ASD ... Alahmari et al

Autism spectrum disorders )ASDs( are characterized 

by  a  range  of  behavioral  difficulties,  including 
considerable  impairments  in  social  interaction  and 
communication.1  Autism  spectrum  disorder 
is  a 
significant  neurodevelopmental  disorder  characterized 
by  restricted  and  repetitive  patterns  of  behavior, 
interests, or activities, as well as difficulties with social 
interaction.2  Children  with 
communication  and 
ASD  often  struggle  with  forming  and  maintaining 
friendships,  understanding  and  reacting  to  social 
cues, and participating in social activities. These social 
challenges can considerably impact a child’s quality of 
life, academic performance, and social )emotional well-
being(.3 Children with ASD can acquire essential social 
skills  for  more  effective  interactions  through  social 
skills  training  )SST(,  which  is  a  type  of  intervention. 
While the approach and content of SST programs can 
differ,  they  typically  focus  on  teaching  skills  such  as 
conversation and problem-solving. 

Social skills are the practical abilities in interpersonal 
interactions  that  allow  a  child  to  communicate 
effectively, both verbally and nonverbally, and adjust to 
their environment.4 Social skills training is a therapeutic 
method designed to systematically teach individuals with 
ASD  essential  skills  for  managing  social  interactions. 
This  evidence-based  intervention  addresses  core  social 
challenges associated with ASD using techniques based 
on cognitive - behavioral principles. Social skills training 
involves explicit instruction in specific social skills, such 
as  nonverbal  communication,  conversational  abilities, 
perspective-taking,  and  emotional  regulation.  The 
approach  is  structured  and  systematic,  using  methods 
such as modeling, role-playing, and feedback to improve 
skill  generalization  and  retention.  It  can  be  adapted 
to  individual  or  group  settings  and  implemented 
across  clinical,  school,  or  community  environments.5 
Additionally, SST programs can differ in duration and 
intensity,  ranging  from  brief  interventions  to  more 
comprehensive,  long-term  approaches.  The  primary 
aim  of  SST  is  to  improve  social  functioning  and 
enhance  the  quality  of  life  for  individuals  with  ASD 
by providing them with the tools needed to form and 
sustain meaningful social relationships.6

There are various forms of SST, such as group-based 
SST  )GSST(  and  individual  SST.  Group-based  SST 
programs usually involve a group of children with ASD 
who regularly meet to learn and practice social skills.7 

Disclosure. Authors have no conflict of interests, and the 
work was not supported or funded by any drug company.

Individual  SST  programs  are  designed  to  address  the 
specific  needs  of  each  child  and  can  be  delivered  by 
therapists, teachers, or parents. Kjobli et al8 found that 
individual  SST  alone  did  not  result  in  a  reduction  of 
problematic  behaviors  in  children.  They  suggested 
that  addressing  behavioral 
issues  required  more 
comprehensive approaches beyond just individual SST. 
Social  skills  training  programs  can  be  implemented 
in  various  settings,  including  schools,  clinics,  and 
community  centers.  Typically  lasting  several  weeks 
or  months,  these  programs  often  include  didactic 
instruction,  role-playing,  and  practical  application  of 
social  skills.  Social  skills  training  therapies  frequently 
involve  practicing  these  skills  in  diverse  contexts, 
such  as  interactions  with  peers,  family  members,  and 
teachers. In a randomized controlled trial, Dekker et al9 
found  that  despite  increased  involvement  from  both 
teachers  and  parents,  there  was  no  additional  benefit 
compared  to  SST  delivered  to  children  alone,  as 
reported  by  parents.  Moreover,  they  observed  no 
considerable  improvement  or  decline  in  outcomes 
after  a  6-month  training  period.6,9  A  recent  meta-
analysis  by  Soares  et  al10  revealed  a  substantial  effect 
size,  ranging  from  medium  to  large,  for  both  face-to-
face  and  behavioral  intervention  technologies  )BIT( 
in  SST  aimed  at  improving  social  skills  in  children 
and  adolescents.  Notably,  no  considerable  differences 
were  found  between  the  2  intervention  modes.  These 
findings  suggest  that  technology  platforms  could  be 
a  promising  method  for  delivering  SST  to  children 
and  young  adults  with  ASD.10  In  their  randomized 
controlled  trial,  Choque  et  al11  found  that  social 
skills  group  training  )SSGT(  was  a  safe  and  practical 
intervention  for  children  and  adolescents  with  ASD 
who were undergoing regular mental health treatments. 
However, the inconsistent results underscore the need 
for  continued  efforts  to  refine  and  improve  SSGT 
beyond current standards.

However, the absence of extensive group studies has 
led to criticism regarding the empirical validity of SST 
for individuals with ASD in several research studies. A 
systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  can  be  useful  in 
providing  an  overview  of  the  literature  regarding  the 
efficacy  of  SST  therapy  for  children  diagnosed  with 
ASD. The purpose of this review and meta-analysis is 
to  appraise  the  quality  of  the  evidence  offered  in  the 
included  studies  and  to  determine  how  effectively 
SST  therapies  work  in  enhancing  social  interaction 
and  communication  skills  in  children  with  ASD. 
The  recommended  reporting  elements  for  systematic 
reviews  and  meta-analyses  )PRISMA(  guidelines  will 
be followed in this systematic review and meta-analysis.

Effectiveness of SST for children with ASD ... Alahmari et al

The results will give doctors, researchers, and legislators 
important information on how well SST therapy works 
for people with ASD.

Rationale  for  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis. 
Social  skills  training  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used 
interventions  for  children  with  ASD.  However,  there 
is  conflicting  information  regarding  its  effectiveness 
in  managing  ASD  therapeutically.  This  systematic 
review  aims  to  provide  a  comprehensive  approach  to 
evaluating  the  efficacy  of  SST  therapies  for  children 
with ASD. Carrying out a systematic review and meta-
analysis is essential owing to the lack of consensus on 
methodology, participant characteristics, and outcome 
measures  in  the  existing  research  on  SST  therapies. 
Drawing  clear  and  concise  conclusions  regarding  the 
efficacy  of  SST  therapies  from  study  results  can  be 
challenging. Additionally, a systematic review and meta-
analysis can identify the pediatric characteristics that are 
most likely to benefit from SST interventions, as well 
as the most effective types of SST therapies. Clinicians 
can  use  this  information  to  make  informed  decisions 
on which SST therapy to recommend for their patients.
Aims  and  objectives.  To  identify  and  evaluate  the 
effectiveness  of  SST  interventions  in  enhancing  social 
interaction  and  communication  skills  in  children 
diagnosed with ASD and to assess the quality of evidence 
presented in the studies included in the meta-analysis.

Methods. The study was carried out in accordance 
with the PRISMA criteria. The methodology summary, 
including the number of studies from various databases, 
the  search  strategy  used  for  article  selection,  and  the 
reasons for study exclusion, is depicted in the PRISMA 
flowchart )Figure 1(.

Data  collection  and  search  methodology.  The  first 
step  in  assessing  the  evidence  for  social  interaction 
therapy  for  adolescents  with  ASD  in  educational 
settings involved a comprehensive search of published 
studies  from  2013  onward.  This  search  included 
multiple  electronic  databases 
such  as  PubMed, 
Cochrane  Library,  PsycINFO,  Embase,  Scopus,  Web 
of  Science,  and  Education  Resources  Information 
Center  )ERIC(.  The  goal  was  to  identify  relevant 
studies  published  up  to  September  2023.  The  search 
strategy used a combination of keywords and controlled 
vocabulary terms related to “autism spectrum disorder”, 
“social  skills  training”,  “communication  skills”,  “social 
interaction”, “randomized controlled trials”, “children”, 
and “intervention effectiveness,” with Boolean operators 
)AND, OR( used to refine the queries.

Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  This  systematic 
review  included  research  published  in  peer-reviewed 

trials 

journals that focused on interventions targeting SST in 
children with ASD. The inclusion criteria encompassed 
randomized  controlled 
)RCTs(  or  quasi-
experimental  studies  with  comparison  groups  that 
provided adequate data for effect size calculation. The 
search  used  both  free  text  and  controlled  vocabulary, 
examining titles and abstracts with Boolean expressions. 
The review considered both published and unpublished 
studies,  such  as  peer-reviewed  journal  articles.  To 
minimize  publication  bias,  the  review  also  considered 
conference  proceedings,  dissertations,  and  reports. 
Studies  were  excluded  if  they  were  non-randomized, 
published  in  languages  other  than  English,  evaluated 
interventions  other  than  SST,  lacked  a  comparison 
group,  did  not  report  outcome  measures  related  to 
improvements in social interaction and communication 
skills, did not focus specifically on SST interventions, 
or had insufficient data or inadequate study design.

Study  screening  and  data  extraction.  Articles  with 
unrelated  titles  were  disqualified  during  the  initial 
round  of  the  research  selection  process.  The  entire 
texts and abstracts that met the inclusion criteria were 
examined in the second phase. To arrange, evaluate, and 
find duplicate entries in the titles and abstracts, Endnote 
X8  was  utilized.  To  guarantee  excellent  findings,  a 
double screening procedure was employed: one review 
was carried out for titles and abstracts, and another for 
entire texts. Data on the study period, design, sample 
size,  region,  intervention  and  control  groups,  gender, 
and  age  distribution  were  gathered  using  a  prototype 
data-extraction  sheet.  The  data  extraction  was  carried 
out by 2 separate investigators, and disagreements were 
settled by consensus rather than using presumptions or 
oversimplifications.

Quality assessment. For every study, an independent 
risk of bias evaluation was carried out by 2 reviewers. 
Using  the  Cochrane  risk  of  bias  tool  for  RCTs,  we 
evaluated  the  risk  of  bias  in  the  included  studies.12 
By  detecting  potential  biases  in  study  design  and 
reporting,  this  technology  promotes  evidence-based 
decision-making  and  guarantees  transparency  and 
reproducibility.  Funnel  plots  and  statistical  tests  )like 
Egger’s test( were employed to evaluate publication bias 
and look for any indications of selective reporting.

Statistical  analysis.  R  software  4.2.2  was  used  to 
carry out statistical analysis. For binary outcomes, risk 
ratios  )RR(  with  95%  confidence  intervals  )CI(  were 
computed; for continuous outcomes, mean differences 
± standard deviation )SD( with a 95% CI were used for 
assessment. The Cochrane Q p-value and I2 statistic were 
used to assess heterogeneity across studies by utilizing 
both  fixed-effects  and  random-effects  models.  Using

disorder

Egger’s regression test and funnel plots, publication bias 
was investigated. For every research that was considered, 
effect sizes were computed to determine how much the 
intervention improved social skills.

Ethical  considerations.  Because  this  meta-analysis 
involves  the  synthesis  of  existing  data  from  published 
studies, ethical approval was not required.

Results.  The  meta-analysis  included  17  studies 
exploring  various  interventions  designed  to  enhance 
social  skills  in  children  with  ASD.  These  studies 
encompassed a wide array of interventions, sample sizes, 
age groups, and durations, offering a thorough overview 
of the current literature in this area.

Participant information, including age, gender, ASD 
diagnostic criteria, and relevant baseline characteristics, 
was  collected.  Sample  sizes  were  recorded  to  evaluate 
their adequacy for meaningful analysis, noting the total 
number of participants in both intervention and control 
groups, along with demographic details impacting SST 
outcomes )Table 1(.

The  diverse  designs  and  focus  areas  of  the  studies 
highlighted  the  variety  of  SST  programs  available 
for  children  with  ASD,  including  group-based  SST, 
individual  SST,  and  hybrid  formats  combining  both 

approaches.  Some  programs  were  delivered  in  clinical 
settings, while others took place in schools or community 
centers, each with different levels of involvement from 
parents, teachers, or peers. Furthermore, SST programs 
varied  in  intensity  and  duration,  from  short-term 
interventions lasting a few weeks to long-term programs 
extending several months.

Outcome  measures.  Information  on  both  primary 
and 
secondary  outcome  measures  was  carefully 
retrieved,  including  pre-  and  post-intervention  scores 
for  each  study  group.  The  extracted  data,  detailed  in 
Table  2,  offers  a  thorough  overview  of  interventions, 
control  conditions,  and  outcomes  across  17  studies. 
This summary highlights the crucial role of treatment in 
enhancing social skills and underscores its importance 
in the examined research context.

Meta-analysis of the social responsiveness scale. Four 
studies  assessed  the  social  responsiveness  scale  )SRS(, 
and we combined their results through a meta-analysis to 
illustrate the overall effect sizes and emphasize the value 
of using the SRS in our analysis. The SRS is extensively 
used  to  evaluate  social  functioning  and  behavior, 
especially  in  individuals  with  ASD.  As  a  quantitative 
measure,  it  assesses  social  communication,  reciprocal 
social behavior, and stereotypical behaviors. The SRS is

an essential tool in both clinical and research settings, 
providing a standardized approach to quantifying and 
analyzing social responsiveness.

The meta-analysis examined a continuous outcome 
measure, specifically the mean difference )MD( between 
treatment  and  control  groups.  The  combined  data, 
analyzed using both common effect and random effects 
models,  yielded  an  MD  of  -5.1175,  with  a  95%  CI: 
)-11.7830, 1.5480(. However, the p-value of 0.1324 was 
not  statistically  significant,  suggesting  no  meaningful 
difference  between  the  treatment  and  control  groups 
)Figure 2(.

Assessments of heterogeneity showed a τ2 estimate 
of  0,  indicating  no  observed  variability  among  the 
studies.  The  I2  value  of  0.0%  confirmed  the  absence 
of  significant  inconsistency,  and  the  p-value  for  the 
heterogeneity  test  )Q-test(  was  0.7853,  which  is  not 
statistically  significant.  This  supports  the  notion  of 

homogeneity across the studies. Although the combined 
effect  size  did  not  achieve  statistical  significance,  the 
detailed  analysis  of  heterogeneity  and  consistency 
provides important context for interpreting the overall 
findings )Figure 2(.

Publication bias. Our meta-analysis’s regression test 
for funnel plot asymmetry produced a p-value of 0.7250 
using  a  mixed-effects  meta-regression  model  with  the 
standard  error  as  the  predictor.  This  non-significant 
p-value shows that there may not be a major publication 
bias associated with the standard error, suggesting that 
there is not enough data to reject the null hypothesis. 

The limit estimate, which assesses potential bias as 
the  standard  error  approaches  zero,  is  -8.1508  with 
a  CI:  )-26.3187,  10.0170(.  Although  this  estimate 
suggests  a  potential  bias  toward  smaller  studies,  the 
wide  confidence  interval  underscores  the  uncertainty 
associated with this estimate )Figure 3(.

Quality  assessment.  A  thorough  evaluation  of  the 
bias risk for each study that was a part of our systematic 
review and meta-analysis is shown in  Figure 4. Several 
bias  categories,  such  as  reporting  bias,  attrition  bias, 
detection  bias,  performance  bias,  and  selection  bias, 
are depicted in this visual summary. The evaluation of 
bias across the 17 studies in the systematic review and 
meta-analysis  reveals  varying  levels  of  methodological 
rigor. High risks are consistently identified in categories 
such as blinding of participants and personnel, blinding 
of  outcome  assessment,  and  other  biases.  These 
findings highlight the need for cautious interpretation 
because such biases can considerably affect the validity 
and  reliability  of  study  outcomes.  Researchers  and 
practitioners  should  consider  these  methodological 
limitations when applying the results to inform decisions 
or interventions related to SST in children with ASD. 
A  nuanced  understanding  of  these  biases  is  essential 
for  accurately  assessing  intervention  effectiveness  and 
guiding future research in this area )Table 3(.

Discussion.  This  review  offers  a  comprehensive 
and  up-to-date  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  SST 
therapies  for  children  with  ASD.  The  findings  are 
consistent with other similar studies, which have shown 
that SST can be an effective intervention for improving 

social  skills  in  children  with  ASD.  The  current  meta-
analysis  included  17  studies  that  explored  various 
interventions aimed at enhancing social skills in these 
children.  The  results  suggest  that  SST  therapies  are 
beneficial  for  developing  social  skills  in  children  with 
ASD.

The meta-analysis findings suggest no considerable 
difference between the treatment and control groups in 
SRS, as indicated by a p-value of 0.1324. Heterogeneity 
analysis shows consistency across studies, with a p-value 
of 0.7853. Additionally, the assessment for publication 
bias reveals no strong evidence of bias, with a p-value 
of  0.7250.  However,  the  quality  assessment  identified 
varying  levels  of  methodological  rigor,  particularly 
concerning  blinding  procedures.  Therefore,  while  the 
results  do  not  show  a  significant  difference  between 
in  methodological  quality 
groups,  the  variability 
underscores  the  need  for  careful  interpretation  and 
consideration  of  potential  biases  in  future  research.  A 
number  of  previous  studies  have  shown  that  SST  can 
be effective in improving social skills, communication 
skills, and behavioral issues in children with ASD. These 
studies included a meta-analysis by Soares et al,10 their 
results highlight SST as an important intervention for 
children with ASD. Both studies, including the current 
meta-analysis,  agree  that  SST  interventions  effectively 
improve  social  skills  in  individuals  with  ASD.  While 
our  meta-analysis  encompasses  a  wider  range  of  SST 
interventions,  the  Soares  et  al10  meta-analysis  focuses 
face-to-face  SST  )F2F-SST(  and 
specifically  on 
behavioral  intervention  technologies  SST  )BITs-SST(. 
Notably, Soares et al10 suggest that BITs-SST may be as 
effective as F2F-SST, proposing it as a viable alternative 
for delivering SST to individuals with ASD. Differences 
in effect sizes between the 2 analyses may be attributed 
to variations in studied populations or methodologies. 
Our meta-analysis, with its inclusion of a larger number 
of  studies,  provides  broader  generalizability  of  the 
findings to a wider population of children with ASD. 
The common incorporation of BITs-SST in both meta-

analyses underscores the promise of these interventions 
as a novel and effective approach for delivering SST to 
children with ASD.

Another study by Dekker et al,6 supported by its use 
of a large sample size and follow-up measures in an RCT, 
provides  strong  evidence  supporting  the  effectiveness 
of involving parents and teachers. However, our meta-
analysis  provides  a  more  comprehensive  overview  of 
SST  interventions  by  encompassing  a  wider  array  of 
intervention types.6

This meta-analysis provides a modest but important 
body  of  evidence  on  the  effectiveness  of  SST 
interventions  for  enhancing  social  skills  in  children 
with  ASD,  with  varying  degrees  of  success  depending 
on the intervention type and study design. In contrast, 
the  study  by  Russo-Ponsaran  et  al31  examine  a  novel 
tool  for  testing  special  incidence  portion  )SIP(  skills 
in  both  ASD  and  non-ASD  populations  using  the 
virtual  environment  for  social  information  processing 
)VESIPTM(.  The  VESIPTM  is  an  simulation-based 
evaluation that immerses youngsters in social decision-
making  scenarios.  While  the  Russo-Ponsaran  et  al31 
study  presents  preliminary  evidence  on  the  potential 
value  of  VESIPTM  as  an  evaluation  instrument  for 
SIP  skills  in  children,  regardless  of  ASD  status,  our 
meta-analysis  provides  a  comprehensive  summary  of 
SST intervention effectiveness across diverse studies. In 
summary, our review provides comprehensive evidence 
regarding  the  effectiveness  of  SST  interventions  in 
improving  social  skills  among  children  with  ASD. 
In  contrast,  the  Shuai  et  al32  study  protocol  outlines 
a  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  designed  to 

specifically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of social 
skills interventions for children with ASD. While our 
review  provides  a  comprehensive  overview  of  SST 
intervention  effectiveness  across  multiple  studies,  the 
Shuai  et  al32  protocol,  which  has  not  yet  been  carried 
out, does not currently provide any findings.

The study protocol by Chen et al33 details a systematic 
review and meta-analysis specifically designed to explore 
the  effectiveness  of  social  skills  )SS(  interventions  for 
children  and  adolescents  with  ASD.  In  contrast,  our 
meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the 
effectiveness of SST interventions across various studies. 
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  Chen  et  al33  study 
protocol has not yet been carried out; thus, its findings 
are not available, we have only referred these protocols 
to  gain  insights  into  the  methodological  approach  for 
evaluating social skills interventions.

Additionally,  while  the  Chen  et  al33  protocol 
focuses  specifically  on  SS  interventions  )a  subset  of 
SST  interventions(  its  planned  assessment  will  cover 
behavior, social skills, and communication effectiveness. 
However, our meta-analysis primarily focuses on social 
skills.

The  study  by  Tachibana  et  al34  provides  detailed 
insights 
into  the  effectiveness  of  different  SST 
interventions  specifically  designed  for  preschool-aged 
children with ASD. Their research highlights statistically 
significant  improvements  in  parental  synchronization 
and  the  reciprocity  of  social  interactions,  suggesting 
these areas as potentially valuable targets for therapies 
aimed at preschool-aged children with ASD. Tachibana 
et  al’s34  study  contributes  more  specific  evidence

regarding  the  efficacy  of  both  individual  and  group 
interventions for this age group. In contrast, our meta-
analysis  provides  a  more  comprehensive  overview, 
evaluating the effectiveness of SST interventions across 
a range of age groups and various intervention types.

An  intriguing  study  by  Freitag  et  al,7,35  provides 
detailed  evidence  of  the  efficacy  of  comprehensive 
developmental interventions and low-intensity training 
targeting  parental  synchrony  and  child  reciprocity.  In 
contrast, our systematic overview of SST intervention 
effectiveness  across  various  age  groups  and  types. 
Overall, our meta-analysis offers an extensive overview 
of  SST  interventions  for  improving  social  skills  in 
children  with  ASD.  The  findings  suggest  that  SST 
interventions can improve various social skills, including 
social communication, reciprocity, and joint attention.
Nonetheless,  the  majority  of  the  impact  sizes  were 
modest  to  moderate,  suggesting  that  SST  therapies 
have  to  be  regarded  as  a  single  element  of  an  all-
encompassing therapy strategy for kids with ASD. The 
precise type of intervention, participant characteristics, 
and implementation fidelity can all affect how effective 
SST therapies are. Future studies ought to concentrate 
on  assessing  the  efficacy  of  various  SST  therapies  for 
kids  with  ASD  and  investigating  their  long-term 
consequences. To better understand how SST therapies 
function, it’s also critical to look into their mechanisms 
of action. 

Practical  implications.  The  findings  of  this  meta-
analysis  have  important  implications  for  clinicians, 

educators,  and  families  of  children  with  ASD:  I( 
clinicians:  SST 
interventions  demonstrate  modest 
to  moderate  effectiveness  and  should  be  considered 
as  one  component  of  a  broader  treatment  plan  for 
children  with  ASD.  Tailoring  SST  interventions  to 
individual  needs,  carefully  monitoring  progress,  and 
addressing potential variability in outcomes are critical 
to achieving meaningful improvements in social skills; 
II( educators: integrating evidence-based SST principles 
into classroom settings can provide children with ASD 
opportunities  to  practice  and  generalize  social  skills. 
Recognizing the variability in the effectiveness of these 
interventions, educators should provide individualized 
accommodations and support while fostering inclusive 
social interactions; and III( Families play a key role in 
supporting  their  child’s  social  development.  Actively 
participating in SST interventions, reinforcing learned 
skills  at  home,  and  maintaining  communication  with 
clinicians and educators can enhance the generalization 
of  skills.  However,  families  should  remain  aware 
that  outcomes  may  vary  based  on  factors  such  as  the 
child’s individual characteristics and the consistency of 
intervention implementation.

While  SST 

interventions 

show  promise 

in 
improving specific areas of social functioning )namely, 
social  communication  and  reciprocity(,  their  overall 
impact is modest and context dependent. Effectiveness 
may  vary  due  to  factors  such  as  the  child’s  age, 
severity  of  ASD  symptoms,  intervention  type,  and 
implementation fidelity. It is crucial to view SST as part 

https://smj.org.sa      Saudi Med J 2025; Vol. 46 )3(

Effectiveness of SST for children with ASD ... Alahmari et al

of  a  comprehensive,  individualized  approach  rather 
than a standalone solution.

Implications  for  future  research.  Future  research 
must concentrate on several critical variables to enhance 
the  comprehension  and  efficacy  of  SST  interventions 
for  children  with  ASD.  Longitudinal  studies  are 
essential to assess the lasting impacts of SST therapies 
on social skills, adaptive behaviors, and quality of life. 
Furthermore,  examining  early  intervention  with  SST 
and  its  prospective  long-term  advantages  is  essential. 
Research must investigate the fundamental mechanisms 
by which SST therapies enhance social skills, examining 
cognitive,  behavioural,  and  neurological  aspects  that 
impact therapy outcomes.

Recognizing  critical  aspects  that  influence  the 
efficacy of SST therapies, such as age, severity of ASD 
symptoms, cognitive capabilities, and motivation, will 
facilitate  the  creation  of  customized  SST  programs 
designed to meet individual requirements. It is crucial 
to  ascertain  the  ideal  intensity  and  duration  of  SST 
interventions to maximize outcomes and to evaluate the 
efficacy of various delivery modes, including individual, 
group,  and  hybrid  approaches.  The  advancement  of 
ways  to  facilitate  the  generalization  and  maintenance 
of social skills acquired in therapeutic environments to 
real-world contexts, as well as investigating the impact 
of  parent  and  teacher  training  on  promoting  skill 
generalization, is essential.

Evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  technology-driven 
social  skills  training  )SST(  interventions,  such  as 
virtual  reality  and  teletherapy,  in  improving  social 
competencies,  as  well  as  exploring  the  potential  of 
technology to enhance the delivery and customisation 
of SST, are essential areas for future research. Moreover, 
it is essential to develop culturally attuned SST therapies 
appropriate for patients from diverse backgrounds and 
to  adapt  these  interventions  to  address  linguistic  and 
cultural barriers in subsequent research. By addressing 
these research queries, future studies can improve and 
optimise SST therapies to better the social outcomes of 
children with ASD.

Study  limitations.  This  comprehensive  review  and 
meta-analysis offer limited evidence that SST therapies 
may  positively  influence  the  social  skills  of  children 
with ASD. The results demonstrate small to moderate 
impact  sizes,  indicating  that  SST  interventions  may 
enhance  aspects  of  social  functioning, 
including 
social  communication,  reciprocity,  and  collaborative 
attention.  Nonetheless,  the  overall  impact  sizes  were 
not statistically significant across all metrics, including 
the social responsiveness scale, underscoring diversity in 
results.

Additional  study  is  required  to  investigate  the 
reasons influencing this variability, such as the type of 
intervention,  participant  characteristics  )namely,  age 
and severity of ASD(, and implementation fidelity. 

In  conclusion,  longitudinal  studies  are  crucial 
for  assessing  the  enduring  benefits  of  SST  and  the 
transfer of acquired abilities to practical environments. 
Determining the most efficacious strategies for various 
subgroups  of  children  with  ASD  will  enhance  and 
optimise  these  interventions  within  comprehensive 
treatment regimens.
