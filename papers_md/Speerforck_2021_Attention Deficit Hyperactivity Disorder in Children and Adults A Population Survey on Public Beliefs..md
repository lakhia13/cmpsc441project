Abstract
Objective: To investigate beliefs and attitudes of the public toward attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 
children  and  adults.  Method:  In  a  representative  population  survey  in  Germany  (N  =  1,008)  using  computer-assisted 
telephone  interviews,  we  asked  participants  about  causal  beliefs,  illness  recognition,  treatment  recommendations,  and 
beliefs about ADHD, presenting an unlabelled vignette of a child or an adult with ADHD. Results: The most frequently 
endorsed causal beliefs for the depicted child with ADHD were “TV or Internet,” “lack of parental affection,” and “broken 
home.” In comparison with the child vignette, biological causal beliefs were endorsed more often after the adult vignette. 
In the child vignette, 66% advised against a treatment with stimulant medication. About 90% of respondents had heard of 
ADHD. Of those, 20% said they believed ADHD to be not a real disease. Conclusion: Beliefs of the German public partly 
contradict evidence and should be considered in therapeutical and public contexts. (J. of Att. Dis. 2021; 25(6) 783-793)

Introduction

With a worldwide-pooled prevalence of 5.3% among chil-
dren  (Polanczyk,  de  Lima,  Horta,  Biederman,  &  Rohde, 
2007)  and  2.5%  among  adults  (Simon,  Czobor,  Bálint, 
Mészáros,  &  Bitter,  2009),  attention  deficit  hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) is a mental illness of high epidemiologi-
cal, clinical, and cultural importance. In recent years, con-
troversial  discussions  about  diagnostic  labels  (Asherson 
et al., 2010; Moncrieff & Timimi, 2010), etiology (Batstra, 
te Meerman, Conners, & Frances, 2017; Dehue et al., 2017; 
Hoogman et al., 2017), and pharmacotherapy (Boesen et al., 
2017; Gerlach, Banaschewski, Coghill, Rohde, & Romanos, 
2017; Häßler, 2019; Kölch, 2019; Romanos, Coghill et al., 
2016;  Romanos,  Reif,  &  Banaschewski,  2016;  Storebø 
et  al.,  2015)  have  dominated  a  large  part  of  academic 
debates  surrounding  this  disorder.  Thus,  the  authors  of  a 
recent mega-analysis of subcortical structures and intracra-
nial  volumes  using  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI) 
brain scans, covered widely in the media, concluded that

patients with ADHD have altered brains; therefore, ADHD is a 
disorder  of  the  brain.  This  message  is  clear  for  clinicians  to 
convey to parents and patients, which can help to reduce the 
stigma of ADHD and improve understanding of the disorder. 
(Hoogman et al., 2017, p. 311)

It  remains  important  to  stress  that  this  assertion  was 
found to be incorrect for the general population with respect 
to other mental disorders such as schizophrenia or depres-
sion, where biological illness concepts were generally asso-
ciated  with  more  rather  than  less  stigma  (Angermeyer, 
Holzinger, Carta, & Schomerus, 2011; Kvaale, Gottdiener, 
& Haslam, 2013; Schomerus, Matschinger, & Angermeyer, 
2014;  Speerforck,  Schomerus,  Pruess,  &  Angermeyer, 
2014). Also, issues with methodological limitations and the 
heterogenic etiology of ADHD were raised in reply to that 
mega-analysis  (Batstra  et  al.,  2017;  Dehue  et  al.,  2017). 
Furthermore, evidence for treatments with stimulants such 
as  methylphenidate  was  subject  to  intensive  academic 
debate:  Whereas  a  Cochrane  Review  on  methylphenidate 
for children and adolescents concluded that “the low quality 
of  the  underpinning  evidence  means  that  we  cannot  be

certain  of  the  magnitude  of  the  effects”  (Storebø  et  al., 
2015), other researchers repeatedly criticized this main con-
clusion (e.g., Gerlach et al., 2017; Romanos, Coghill et al., 
2016;  Romanos,  Reif,  &  Banaschewski,  2016).  Another 
review on methylphenidate for adults even was withdrawn 
from the Cochrane Library after substantial criticism of its 
methods and flawed conclusions (Boesen et al., 2017).

In the face of such polarizing academic arguments, ques-
tions arise regarding the general population: Does the pub-
lic  take  note  of  such  debates,  and  what  are  the  beliefs 
underlying them in the general population? After all, public 
beliefs  about  people  with  mental  illness  are  particularly 
important, as they not only shape the thoughts and actions 
of patients but also influence the advice of caregivers and 
friends (Angermeyer, Matschinger, & Riedel-Heller, 1999). 
The decision to seek professional help for a mental health 
problem is closely related to prevalent public attitudes and 
beliefs  (Angermeyer,  Matschinger,  &  Schomerus,  2017; 
Angermeyer & Schomerus, 2017).

Against  this  background,  the  present  study  uses  data 
from  the  first  population-based  survey  on  public  beliefs 
about ADHD in children and adults in an European country 
to address the following questions:

•• Does the German public recognize typical symptoms 
of  ADHD,  and  is  ADHD  considered  to  be  a  real 
disorder?

•• What are the suspected causes of ADHD?
•• How many people recommend seeking professional 
help for a person with the core symptoms of ADHD? 
And if so, what is expected from professionals?
•• What  causal  beliefs  are  associated  with  a  higher 
approval of professional help or an identification as 
mental illness or real disease?

•• Do  disorder-related  beliefs  differ  regarding  the  age 

of the person depicted with ADHD?

Method

Participants

A  representative  population  survey  of  German-speaking 
adults  (>18  years)  was  conducted  in  Germany  between 
March  and  May  2017.  Fieldwork  was  done  by  USUMA 
(Berlin),  a  company  specialized  in  market  and  social 
research.  Altogether,  1,008  persons  completed  the  inter-
view, reflecting a response rate of 20.1%. Reasons for non-
response  were  the  following:  partial  interviews  (n  =  21), 
refusal or termination of interview by the survey respondent 
(n = 1,859), no contact with eligible household and answer-
ing machine (n = 1,154), and other difficulties with com-
munication due to problems with language or understanding 
(n = 432). Ethical considerations prohibited the collection 
of any detailed information on nonrespondents. The sample 

contained  slightly  more  women,  more  elderly,  and  more 
educated  persons  in  comparison  with  the  German  general 
population (Supplementary Table 1).

Interview and Case Vignettes

After training the interviewers and conducting a field pre-
test to evaluate the comprehensibility and internal consis-
tency  of  the  interview,  a  computer-assisted  telephone 
interview  (CATI)  was  conducted  using  real-time  monitor-
ing  by  trained  supervisors. The  interview  started  with  the 
playing of a previously recorded unlabeled case vignette of 
a child (n = 505) or an adult (n = 503) with all core symp-
toms  of  ADHD  according  to  Diagnostic  and  Statistical 
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (5th  ed.;  DSM-5;  American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013). During and after hearing the 
vignette, we controlled the attentiveness of respondents by 
asking  about  their  problems  with  understanding.  The  two 
vignette  conditions  differed  only  with  regard  to  age  (12 
years/35 years) and contextual factors (e.g., school/work). 
The gender of the person described in the vignette (Anne/
Robert) varied at random. The wording of the vignettes had 
undergone validation by five blinded experts with experi-
ence  in  general  or  child/adolescence  psychiatry  and  is 
included in the appendix.

Measures

Illness recognition and questions about ADHD.  At the begin-
ning of the interview, we asked respondents (a) how they 
would label the depicted problem as an open question, (b) to 
estimate changes in the prevalence of the depicted problem 
during the last 20 years, and (c) whether they identify the 
problem  as  a  mental  illness.  At  the  very  end  of  the  inter-
view, we disclosed ADHD as the diagnosis and asked about 
familiarity with it and whether respondents perceived it as a 
real disorder.

Causal beliefs.  We elicited beliefs about possible causes of 
the problem described in the vignette with a list of 18 pos-
sible causes, each of which was rated on a 5-point Likert-
type scale anchored with 1 = “certainly a cause” and 5 = 
“certainly not a cause.” Answers to these items were entered 
into  an  exploratory  principal  component  factor  analysis 
with varimax rotation, yielding four main factors: “family 
and  childhood,”  “current  stress,”  “biogenetic,”  and  “envi-
ronment and diet.” We used a z-transformed score for each 
factor (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) and reversed the 
rotated  factor  scores,  with  higher  scores  indicating  higher 
agreement with the appropriate causes.

Help-seeking  and  treatment  recommendations.  We  asked 
respondents  what  intervention  they  would  recommend  in 
the depicted situation. If they advised seeking professional

help immediately or after several months, participants were 
presented with a list of six help-seeking and six treatment 
recommendations that were used in earlier studies (Riedel-
Heller, Matschinger, & Angermeyer, 2005) and were asked 
to  what  extent  they  would  recommend  each  treatment 
modality  for  the  person  described  in  the  vignette.  The 
strength  of  each  recommendation  was  rated  on  a  5-point 
Likert-type scale, with 1 = “recommend urgently” and 5 = 
“strongly advise against.” For our analyses, we reversed the 
item scores, with higher scores indicating higher approval 
to  the  recommendation.  To  investigate  first-choice  help-
seeking and treatment options, we asked respondents which 
of their previously preferred options they are recommend-
ing most strongly.

Statistical Analysis

To  allow  statements  to  be  representative  of  the  German-
speaking general population, all results were calculated as 
weighted percentages accounting for household size, study 
design, and the German general population. To illustrate the 
prevalence of public beliefs, respondents who endorsed the 

two  points  on  either  side  of  the  midpoint  of  the  5-point 
scales (values 1 + 2 and 4 + 5) were grouped together into 
the categories “a cause” and “not a cause” (causal beliefs), 
and “recommend” and “advise against” (help-seeking and 
treatment  recommendations).  Differences  in  responses 
were tested for statistical significance using Fisher’s exact 
test regarding the vignette condition.

To analyze associations between causal beliefs and help-
seeking or treatment recommendations and illness concep-
tualizations,  we  calculated  weighted  simple  (dichotomous 
ordinal-scaled  variables)  and  ordered  (nondichotomous 
ordinal-scaled  variables)  logistic  regression  models  with 
help-seeking or treatment recommendations, identification 
as mental illness, or perception of ADHD as outcome and 
causal belief factor variables as exposure. The models were 
controlled  for  age,  gender,  and  education  (categorial).  To 
deal with missing observations (19.0% of participants with 
at least one missing in a causal belief item), we used multi-
ple  imputation  by  chained  equations  (Royston,  2005;  van 
Buuren,  Boshuizen,  &  Knook,  1999)  to  perform  identical 
regression models with the same weighting as before as a 
sensitivity  analysis.  Imputations  were  calculated  20  times

for  all  participants  who  had  less  than  22.2%  (from  ≤4  to 
18) missing within all causal belief items. After imputation, 
1.7% of participants remained with >22.2% missings. Only 
associations  that  remained  statistically  significant  within 
the sensitivity analysis are reported.

The statistical analyses were carried out using Stata 13.1 

quarters recommended seeking professional help when the 
condition  would  not  change  over  several  months. At  the 
latest after several months, in total 94% (child vignette) or 
95%  (adult  vignette)  of  the  German  general  population 
recommended seeing a professional for the depicted core 
symptoms of ADHD.

Results

Illness Recognition and Questions About ADHD

Twenty-nine percent and 28% of the German general popu-
lation  spontaneously  described  the  case  vignette  of  a 
12-year-old  child  as  ADHD  or  hyperactivity  (disorder), 
respectively; this was significantly higher than descriptions 
of  the  adult  case  vignette  (Table  1).  In  all,  44%  (child 
vignette) or 55% (adult vignette) categorized the depicted 
symptoms  as  mental  illness,  and  74%  (child  vignette)  or 
83%  (adult  vignette)  believed  that  the  number  of  people 
with such problems has risen. Although more than 90% of 
the general population had heard of “attention deficit hyper-
activity disorder” or “ADHD,” about three quarters of those 
believed ADHD to be a real disease, whereas 20% did not.

Causal Beliefs

The four most frequently endorsed causal beliefs after hear-
ing  the  child  vignette  were  “too  much  TV  or  Internet,”  a 
“lack of parental affection,” a “broken home,” and “prob-
lems with parents or friends” (Table 2). After presentation 
of  the  adult  vignette,  a  “stressful  life  event,”  “pressure  to 
perform,” “problems with partner or family,” and “chemical 
imbalance  in  the  brain”  were  endorsed  most  frequently. 
“Environmental pollution” was endorsed least frequently in 
both vignettes. In comparison with an adult person depicted 
with  ADHD,  biological  causal  beliefs  such  as  “chemical 
imbalance  in  the  brain,”  “brain  disease,”  or  “drug  abuse” 
were  endorsed  less  frequently  after  the  child  vignette. 
Otherwise,  causal  beliefs  from  the  family-social  context 
such as “too much TV or Internet,” “lack of parental affec-
tion,”  or  “poor  parenting”  were  selected  more  frequently 
after the child vignette. Biogenetic causes were more fre-
quently rejected after the description of a child with ADHD 
in comparison with an adult with the same symptoms.

Help-seeking and treatment recommendations.  Seventy-one 
percent (child vignette) or 75% (adult vignette) of the gen-
eral  population  recommended  seeking  professional  help 
(Table  3).  Of  the  respondents  who  initially  endorsed  the 
options  “do  nothing  and  wait”  or  “try  to  do  something 
with the help of family or close friends,” more than three 

Help-seeking.  After presentation of the child vignette, the 
two  help-seeking  recommendations  that  were  endorsed  the 
most  were  to  consult  a  psychotherapist  or  an  educational 
psychologist (Table 3). As a first choice, 30% recommended 
consulting  a  psychotherapist,  29%  recommended  consult-
ing an educational psychologist, and 24% suggested seeing 
a  psychiatrist  (Supplementary  Figure  1).  For  an  adult  with 
ADHD, consultation with a psychotherapist or a psychiatrist 
was recommended most frequently. When respondents were 
forced to choose, 30% recommended seeing a psychothera-
pist  and  29%  decided  to  recommend  a  general  practitioner 
first.  In  comparison  with  recommendations  for  a  child,  the 
consultation  of  a  psychiatrist  or  a  psychiatric  hospital  was 
endorsed more frequently for an adult with ADHD.

Treatment.  For children and adults with ADHD, concen-
tration and memory training, psychotherapy, and autogenic 
training were recommended most frequently (Table 3). The 
use  of  stimulants  was  recommended  as  rarely  as  the  use 
of sedatives. As the large majority of the German general 
population disapproved of stimulants, 50% (child vignette) 
and  53%  (adult  vignette)  strongly  advised  against  the  use 
of  stimulants  (5  on  the  5-point  Likert-type  scale).  When 
respondents  had  to  choose,  psychotherapy  (37%/40%)  or 
concentration and memory training (36%/32%) were most 
frequently  mentioned  as  first-line  treatments  (Supplemen-
tary Figure 1).

Associations of causal beliefs with recommendations, identifica-
tion as mental illness, and perception of ADHD.  After hearing 
the child vignette, the factor score comprising causal beliefs 
around “diet and environment” was predominately associ-
ated with a higher approval of homeopathic remedies, auto-
genic training, and a lower likelihood of a perception as a 
real  disorder,  whereas  the  factor  score  “family  and  child-
hood”  was  only  associated  with  less  approval  of  a  drug 
therapy with stimulants (Figure 1).

Although “current stress” in relation to the child vignette 
was only associated with a higher level of endorsement of 
an  educational  psychologist,  we  found  multiple  associa-
tions  with  a  higher  approval  of  professional  help-seeking 
and treatment as well as with a higher likelihood of classify-
ing the depicted symptoms as a mental illness for an adult 
with ADHD.

Following the depiction of a child with ADHD, the fac-
tor score “Biogenetic” was strongly associated with a higher 
endorsement for seeing a psychiatrist, a psychotherapist, or

was associated not only with a higher likelihood of concep-
tualizing  the  symptoms  as  mental  illness  or  identifying 
ADHD as a real disorder but also with a higher recommen-
dation for sedative medication.

Discussion

The present study indicates that about half of the German-

causes for ADHD in children are mostly felt to arise from 
family-social  contexts,  while  biological  causal  beliefs  are 
more frequent in relation to the adult phenotype of ADHD. 
About  two  thirds  of  the  public  advise  against  the  use  of 
stimulants,  whereas  homeopathic  remedies  are  4  times 
more likely to be recommended. Predominantly biogenetic 
causal  beliefs  are  associated  with  a  higher  approval  of 

professional help and the conceptualization of the problem 
in the child vignette as a mental illness.

To  sum  up,  a  large  gap  exists  between  evidence-based 
guidelines and public opinion. The fact that more respon-
dents spontaneously identified the child vignette as having 
ADHD or hyperactivity (disorder) in comparison with the 
adult vignette might be linked to a low level of awareness of

adult  ADHD  (Asherson  et  al.,  2012).  Interestingly,  how-
ever,  more  people  recognized  the  depicted  symptoms  as 
mental  illness  after  hearing  of  the  adult  vignette,  which 
might point to a higher tolerance in children with respect to 
unusual behavior. The overall percentage of how many peo-
ple identified the depicted symptoms as mental illness after 
hearing the child vignette is comparable with data from the 

U.S.  general  population  (United  States,  46%;  Germany, 
44%; Pescosolido et al., 2008). Also, a similar percentage 
believed ADHD to be a real disease (United States, 78%; 
Germany,  75%;  McLeod,  Fettes,  Jensen,  Pescosolido,  & 
Martin, 2007). In contrast to an estimate of 64% in the U.S. 
general population, in this study more than 90% of respon-
dents stated that they had heard of ADHD (McLeod et al., 

790 

Journal of Attention Disorders 25(6)

2007), although it should be taken into account when com-
paring these studies that the U.S. survey was conducted in 
2002. The predominant perception that the number of peo-
ple with problems as depicted in the vignettes has increased 
may  reflect  the  increased  rates  of  ADHD  diagnoses 
(Bachmann,  Philipsen,  &  Hoffmann,  2017),  a  perception 
that the disorder is overdiagnosed (Merten, Cwik, Margraf, 
&  Schneider,  2017;  Partridge,  Lucke,  &  Hall,  2014),  or  a 
wider resonance of the disorder in the media. Also, a change 
of  behavioral  norms  in  society,  which  possibly  leads  to 
higher conspicuousness and burden of symptoms, would be 
in accordance with the perception of an increase in ADHD-
associated symptoms (Conrad & Bergey, 2014). In contrast 
to this perception, a meta-regression analysis of epidemio-
logical data found no evidence for an increase in the preva-
lence of ADHD over the last 30 years (Polanczyk, Willcutt, 
Salum, Kieling, & Rohde, 2014).

In considering causal beliefs of the public, it is important 
to note that to current understanding, ADHD is a multifac-
torial disorder with a heterogeneous etiology encompassing 
genetic  predisposition  as  well  as  early  environmental  risk 
factors and remains a disorder with only a few clear causal 
risk factors (Banaschewski et al., 2017; Thapar & Cooper, 
2016).  Even  considering  growing  evidence  regarding  the 
causal relationship of early severe institutional deprivation 
(Kennedy  et  al.,  2016),  the  strong  emphasis  on  family-
social causes we found in relation to the child vignette is not 
scientifically  substantiated  (Banaschewski  et  al.,  2017; 
Thapar  &  Cooper,  2016).  By  contrast,  biological  causes 
were  endorsed  considerably  less  frequently  after  hearing 
the child vignette compared with the adult description. At 
the  same  time,  particularly  after  depiction  of  a  child  with 
ADHD,  these  were  associated  with  a  higher  approval  of 
professional assistance and the identification as mental ill-
ness.  This  is  consistent  with  associations  regarding  other 
mental  illnesses  (Speerforck,  Schomerus,  Matschinger,  & 
Angermeyer, 2017) and with the finding that a high percent-
age of the U.S. population with knowledge about medica-
tion  and  biological  causes  believe  ADHD  to  be  a  real 
disorder  (McLeod  et  al.,  2007).  Conclusions  like  a  future 
emphasis  on  biological  causal  explanations  for  ADHD 
should  not  be  drawn  carelessly,  as  possible  relations  with 
stigmatizing  attitudes  or  emotions  require  a  better  under-
standing  (Angermeyer  et  al.,  2011;  Mueller,  Fuermaier, 
Koerts, & Tucha, 2012; Schomerus et al., 2014; Speerforck 
et al., 2014). Especially, since a higher agreement with the 
contraindicated  treatment  with  sedatives  was  associated 
with  biogenetic  causal  beliefs  as  well.  Interestingly,  the 
rarely  endorsed  causal  beliefs  around  “environment  and 
diet” were the only ones associated with a higher approval 
of homeopathic remedies, autogenic training, and a reduced 
likelihood  of  conceptualizing  ADHD  as  a  real  disorder. 
These findings might be rooted in lifestyle phenomena. In 
relation to an adult depicted with ADHD, the associations 

with causal beliefs were overall more complex, with causal 
beliefs around current stress being more important.

The high preference for nonpharmaceutical treatments for 
ADHD corroborates findings from a large meta-analysis of 
public attitudes toward psychiatry and psychiatric treatment 
(Angermeyer, van der Auwera, Carta, & Schomerus, 2017). 
What is psychiatry supposed to learn from a finding such as 
this? On one hand, the strong rejection of a treatment with 
stimulants contradicts current treatment guidelines (National 
Institute  for  Health  and  Care  Excellence  [NICE],  2008; 
Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany 
[AWMF], 2017) as well as the important role of stimulants in 
treating the core symptoms of ADHD (Banaschewski et al., 
2017). This is especially noteworthy, as the updated version 
of  the  German  guideline  on  diagnosis  and  management  of 
ADHD (likewise NICE, 2008) recommends consideration of 
a drug treatment for a moderate severity of the disorder, con-
the  concrete  circumstances,  preferences,  and 
sidering 
resources  of  the  patient  and  related  caregivers  (AWMF, 
2017). On the other hand, these are partly the “preferences of 
the patient and related caregivers” that are reflected in this 
study.  One  could  also  think  of  this  attitude  of  the  German 
public toward stimulant medication as advocating psychiatric 
care that not only includes psychoeducation but also provides 
sufficient resources for providing effective non-pharmaceuti-
cal treatment options on an individual, social, and structural 
level (Thapar & Cooper, 2016). Although the low frequency 
of recommendations for stimulants might be due to a gener-
ally  low  level  of  familiarity  with  the  term  “stimulants”  or 
“Ritalin®,” the attitude toward this treatment option was not 
characterized by indifference but by strong rejection by the 
majority  of  respondents.  Other  studies  confirmed  a  wide-
spread public skepticism toward treating ADHD with stimu-
lants: As  in  the  United  States,  the  majority  of  respondents 
recommended  a  combination  of  psychotherapy  and  drug 
treatment, and only 5% recommended a drug therapy alone 
(McLeod  et  al.,  2007).  Population  studies  from  Australia 
reported a significantly lower acceptance of drug therapy for 
ADHD in comparison with the treatment of major depression 
(Partridge, Lucke, & Hall, 2012; Partridge et al., 2014), and a 
population survey from Brazil found that more than 50% of 
respondents were not only skeptical about the use of stimu-
lants but thought that they cause addiction (Gomes, Palmini, 
Barbirato,  Rohde,  &  Mattos,  2007).  However,  in  any  case, 
the strong rejection of drug therapy for ADHD seems espe-
cially  important  to  the  psychiatrists  and  psychotherapists 
involved. When  counseling  patients  and  their  caregivers,  a 
particularly high demand for psychoeducation and a complex 
process of shared decision making may be expected. Further 
qualitative and quantitative evidence is required to improve 
our understanding of the associations between drug therapy 
and  stigmatizing  beliefs  (e.g.,  personality  changes)  among 
patients,  caregivers,  and  the  general  public  (Mueller  et  al., 
2012; Speerforck et al., 2017).

Limitations

This is the first population-based survey from a European 
country  on  public  beliefs  about  ADHD  in  children  and 
adults, using quality assured interviewing, unlabelled case 
vignettes to avoid possible bias due to the use of medical 
vocabulary,  and  allowing  direct  comparison  between 
ADHD  in  adults  and  children.  Despite  its  strengths,  the 
present study should be interpreted in light of the following 
limitations. First, in investigating the identification of typi-
cal  symptoms  of ADHD  as  mental  illness,  we  used  unla-
belled case vignettes depicting  core  symptoms of ADHD, 
while  reactions  to  labeled  vignettes  or  persons  with  the 
described mental illness or only some symptoms might dif-
fer. Second, despite weighting for representativity, partici-
pants  of  higher  age  and  education  were  overrepresented, 
and our study design carries a risk for selection and agree-
ment bias as well as social desirability. Third, our study has 
been conducted in Germany and results are likely to differ 
in  other  sociocultural  contexts.  Fourth,  we  investigated 
prevalent beliefs among the German public using a cross-
sectional study design and established quantitative methods 
in population-based attitude research. No conclusions about 
other  causal  beliefs  or  recommendations  for  professional 
help  among  the  German  public  can  be  made.  Finally,  we 
used  regression  analysis  with  low  explanatory  power  on 
cross-sectional data without an experimental design to elu-
cidate  possibly  important  associations  of  causal  beliefs. 
Therefore, no statements regarding causality can be made, 
and there are probably other factors associated with help-
seeking  and  treatment  recommendations  that  were  not 
examined in our study.

Conclusion

A  marked  disparity  exists  between  evidence-based  guide-
lines for diagnosis and management of ADHD and public 
opinion.  This  gap  should  be  considered  by  professionals 
when  counseling  patients  and  caregivers  or  by  the  media 
when covering health-related issues about ADHD. The sen-
sitive promotion of a multifactorial disease model, the con-
sideration  of  multilevel  preferences,  and  a  thorough  and 
balanced psychoeducation should form the cornerstone of 
therapeutic intervention, particularly in a disorder such as 
ADHD.

often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly and is 
often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli. He often loses 
things  like  keys  or  mobile  telephones  and  is  forgetful  in 
daily activities like doing chores or running errands. Robert 
often fidgets with or taps hands or feet. He often leaves his 
place in the classroom or when sitting at the dining table. 
Unable to be still for an extended time, he is often “on the 
go” and acting as if “driven by a motor,” which is experi-
enced by others as difficult to keep up with. Robert often 
talks excessively and blurts out an answer before a question 
has  been  completed.  He  often  butts  into  conversations, 
games,  or  other  activities  and  starts  using  other  people’s 
things  without  asking  or  receiving  permission.  Several  of 
these behaviors were already present prior to age 12. These 
behaviors interfere with Robert’s functioning in school and 
negatively affect relationships with adults and peers.
