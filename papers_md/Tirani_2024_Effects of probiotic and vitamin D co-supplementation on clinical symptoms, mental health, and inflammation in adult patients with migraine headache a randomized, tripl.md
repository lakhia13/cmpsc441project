Abstract 
Background  Migraine headache is a major public health problem. Routine medications for migraine treatment are 
not useful in treating all patients and may have some side effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effect 
of vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation on clinical characteristics of migraine, daily functioning, mental health 
outcomes, and serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).

Methods  In this randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, patients aged 18 to 55 years diagnosed 
with migraine based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 (ICHD-3) were randomized 
to either vitamin D (50,000 IU every 2 weeks) plus probiotic (4.5 ×  1011 CFU per day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The 
Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) questionnaires were administered 
to patients at baseline and after 12 weeks. In addition, the frequency, duration, and severity of migraine headaches 
per month were assessed using a self-administered 30-day headache diary at baseline and the end of the interven-
tion. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure, and serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and hs-CRP were also exam-
ined at first and the end of the study.
Results  Seventy-two migraine patients with a mean age of 37.46 ± 8.32 years were included in this trial. Probiotic 
and vitamin D co-supplementation compared to placebo resulted in a significant increase in serum levels of vitamin 
D (+ 12.86 ± 1.64 vs. + 1.12 ± 0.80 ng/mL, P < 0.001). The between-group analysis in the adjusted model showed 
a significantly greater reduction in migraine headache frequency (− 3.17 ± 0.84 vs. − 1.25 ± 0.34; P = 0.031) and severity 
(− 1.55 ± 0.35 vs. + 0.67 ± 0.29; P = 0.017) in the probiotic and vitamin D group than the placebo group. No significant 
difference was found between the two arms of the intervention regarding the change in headache duration, hs-CRP, 
scores of DASS, and HIT-6 questionnaires (P > 0.05).

Conclusions  This trial showed that probiotic and vitamin D co-supplementation for 12 weeks has beneficial effects 
on migraine headache characteristics. Further research is needed to confirm this finding.

Background
Migraine  is  a  primary  headache  affecting  more  than  1 
billion  individuals  all  around  the  globe  [1].  Clinically, 
migraine  is  diagnosed  by  the  third  edition  of  the  Inter-
national  Classification  of  Headache  Disorders  (ICHD-3) 
[2]. Migraine is defined according to the criteria as recur-
rent headaches with two of four headache characteristics 
(unilateral,  pulsating,  moderate  to  severe,  and  aggravat-
ing by routine physical activity) plus one of the correlated 
symptoms  (nausea  and/or  vomiting,  phonophobia,  and 
photophobia)  during  attacks.  Patients  with  less  than  15 
headache  days  per  month  are  considered  to  suffer  from 
episodic  migraine  (EM).  However,  patients  with  15  or 
more days of headache (per month), comprising at least 
8  days  of  headache  with  migraine  features,  for  more 
than 3 consecutive months have chronic migraine (CM). 
Nearly,  one-third  of  migraine  patients  represent  attacks 
with aura which are known as reversible focal neurologi-
cal symptoms that develop over 5 to 60 min and usually 
occur before the headache phase [2].

According  to  the  Global  Burden  of  Disease  (GBD) 
2019,  migraine  is  one  of  the  leading  reasons  for  years 
living  with  disability  (YLDs)  [3].  Furthermore,  robust 
evidence  from  previous  research  has  indicated  that  the 
prevalence  of  psychiatric  comorbidities,  such  as  depres-
sion,  anxiety,  and  sleep  disorders,  is  higher  in  migraine 
patients  compared  to  the  general  population,  which, 
unfavorably  affects  the  quality  of  life  (QoL)  and  clinical 
outcomes  in  migraineurs  [4–6].  Although  several  medi-
cations  are  available  to  alleviate  pain  and  clinical  symp-
toms  of  migraine,  acute  treatment  with  most  of  them 
might  not  lead  to  favorable  clinical  outcomes  [7,  8]. 
Suboptimal  treatment  can  lead  to  medication  overuse, 
which,  in  turn,  increases  the  chronicity  of  the  disease 
and the risk of depression and anxiety [9–11]. As a result, 
migraine imposes a substantial burden not only on indi-
viduals  and  their  families  but  also  on  societies  because 
of  direct  medical  costs  of  the  disease  and  indirect  costs 
related  to  unemployment  and  lost  work  time  [12–14]. 
Thus, exploring more effective treatment options is cru-
cial for the efficient management of migraine.

The  pathophysiology  of  migraine  is  complex  and  its 
underlying  mechanisms  are  not  fully  understood.  How-
ever, recent data suggest that the gut-brain axis may play 
a  role  in  the  pathophysiology  of  the  headache  [15–18]. 
Migraine  may  be  linked  to  gastrointestinal  (GI)  comor-
bidities  such  as  diarrhea,  constipation,  inflammatory 
bowel  disease  (IBD),  irritable  bowel  syndrome  (IBS), 
Helicobacter pylori infection, and disorders of gut-brain 
interaction  (DGBI)  such  as  functional  dyspepsia  and 
cyclic  vomiting  syndrome  (CVS)  [19–23].  Furthermore, 
increased  levels  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  (such 
as  tumor  necrosis  factor-alpha  (TNF-α),  interleukin 

(IL)-1β, and IL-6, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(hs-CRP))  resulting  from  GI  microbiota  dysbiosis  and 
increased  gut  permeability  have  been  observed  during 
migraine attacks. Additionally, some neuropeptides such 
as  serotonin  are  involved  in  the  migraine  pathogenesis 
through  the  gut-brain  axis  [15]. Therefore,  it  seems  that 
therapeutic  strategies  affecting  the  intestinal  microbiota 
can be useful in the treatment of migraine.

Probiotics  could  probably  relieve  migraine  headaches 
through  improving  the  function  of  gut-brain  axis.  Few 
previous studies have investigated the effect of probiotic 
supplementation  on  migraine  attacks;  however,  there 
was  no  consensus  on  their  results  [24,  25].  Recent  evi-
dence has also implied the influence of vitamin D on gut 
microbiota  [26].  Vitamin  D  supplementation  has  also 
shown beneficial effects on the frequency and severity of 
migraine attacks [27–29]. It seems that one of the mech-
anisms  through  which  vitamin  D  improves  migraine 
attacks might be through its effect on the brain-intestinal 
axis [30]. We hypothesized that probiotic and vitamin D 
supplementation might be synergistically effective on the 
brain-gut axis and migraine symptoms. Thus, the objec-
tive  of  the  present  study  was  to  evaluate  the  effect  of 
probiotic and vitamin D co-supplementation on the fre-
quency,  duration,  and  severity  of  migraine  attacks,  daily 
functioning, mental health outcomes, and serum levels of 
hs-CRP in adult patients with migraine.

Methods
Study design and patients

The  present  study  was  a  parallel  randomized,  triple-
blinded,  placebo-controlled  trial  conducted  in  a  central 
neurology  clinic  in  Isfahan  city,  Iran.  The  study  proto-
col  was  approved  by  the  Ethics  Committee  of  Isfahan 
University of Medical Sciences (no.3401664) and a writ-
ten  informed  consent  form  was  signed  by  each  patient 
before  study  initiation.  The  study  protocol  was  also 
registered  at  the  Iranian  Registry  of  Clinical  Trials  (no. 
IRCT20121216011763N59).

Sample  size  was  calculated  using  the  mean  difference 
and standard deviation for migraine headache frequency, 
as the key variable, based on a previous study considering 
a  power  of  90%  and  type  I  error  of  0.05  [25]. The  mini-
mum sample size was estimated to be 35 patients in each 
group.  Patients  were  considered  eligible  for  inclusion  in 
the  trial  if  they  were  between  18  and  55  years  old,  had 
a history of migraine with or without aura based on the 
ICHD-3,  and  experienced  more  than  2  migraine  attacks 
per month during the 3 preceding months. Non-inclusion 
criteria  were  pregnancy  or  breastfeeding;  non-migraine 
headaches;  drug  overuse  headache;  clinical  diagnosis  of 
endocrine,  cardiovascular,  neurological,  renal,  hepatic, 
and  gastrointestinal  diseases  (like  ulcerative  colitis  and

Crohn’s disease); the use of vitamin D supplements, pro-
biotic  supplements,  probiotic-fortified  foods,  and  anti-
biotics up to 3 months before the initiation of the study. 
Patients  with  any  change  in  their  treatment  approach, 
i.e.,  modifications  in  the  type  or  dose  of  prophylactic 
medications,  adherence  rate  lower  than  80%,  and  those 
who  were  not  willing  to  continue  the  intervention  were 
excluded from the trial.

Randomization and intervention

Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  the  probiotic  plus 
vitamin  D  supplementation  group  or  placebo  group, 
according  to  a  scheme  generated  by  a  web-based  sys-
tem using a permuted block with a size of four (https:// 
www. seale denve lope. com/).  All  patients,  investigators, 
and  analyzers  were  blinded  to  the  randomization  list 
and administered drugs until the end of statistical analy-
sis.  An  unblinded  investigator  who  was  not  involved  in 
study  assessments  labeled  probiotic  and  vitamin  D  sup-
plements.  Patients  in  the  intervention  group  received  a 
probiotic  capsule  (4.5 ×  1011  CFU)  (Farabiotic  Pharma-
ceutical  Company,  Tehran,  Iran)  per  day  and  a  pearl  of 
vitamin  D  (50,000  IU)  (Zahravi  Pharmaceutical  Com-
pany, Tabriz, Iran) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. However, 
patients in the control group received a placebo capsule 
for probiotic (containing starch and maltodextrin) every 
day  and  a  placebo  pearl  for  vitamin  D  (containing  corn 
oil) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Supplement and placebo 
capsules  (or  pearls)  were  identical  in  packaging,  size, 
shape,  and  color.  The  probiotic  supplement  contained 
eight  different  strains  of  Lactobacillus  plantarum,  Lac-
tobacillus  casei,  Lactobacillus  acidophilus,  Lactobacil-
lus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium 
longum,  Bifidobacterium  breve,  and  Streptococcus  ther-
mophilus.  To  increase  the  compliance  of  patients,  dates 
of  vitamin  D  use  were  provided  to  each  patient  and  he/
she received weekly phone reminders.

never = 6,  rarely = 8,  sometimes = 10,  very  often = 11, 
and always = 13. The final HIT-6 scores of 36–49, 50–55, 
56–59, and ≥ 60 indicated that headache has no, moder-
ate, substantial, and severe impact, respectively.

Biochemical variables

Blood  samples  were  collected  after  12  h  of  fasting  at 
baseline  and  the  end  of  the  intervention.  After  10  min 
of  centrifuge  at  3500  rpm,  serum  was  separated  and 
kept  at − 80  °C  for  future  assessments.  Serum  levels  of 
25-hydroxy  vitamin  D  were  measured  using  an  ELISA 
commercial  kit  (DiaZist  company,  Tehran,  Iran).  High-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was examined by 
a commercial kit according to the turbidimetric method. 
Biochemical variables were measured at baseline and the 
end of the intervention.

Blood pressure and anthropometric indices

Blood  pressure  (BP)  was  measured  in  a  sitting  position 
after  a  10-min  resting  using  a  digital  sphygmomanom-
eter  (Rossmax  Swiss  GmbH,  Heerbrugg,  Switzerland) 
in  the  fasting  condition.  BP  measurement  was  repeated 
two times for each patient 5 min apart and the mean of 
two measurements was used for data analysis. Mean arte-
rial pressure (MAP) was computed as 1/3 systolic blood 
pressure  (SBP)  plus  2/3  diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP). 
Anthropometric  variables  were  measured  by  a  trained 
dietitian,  while  subjects  were  standing  in  light  cloth-
ing, with bare feet. Weight (kg) was measured by a digi-
tal  scale  (Omron,  HN-286,  Kyoto,  Japan)  to  the  nearest 
0.1 kg, and height (cm) was measured by a wall-mounted 
tape  measure  to  the  nearest  0.1  cm.  Body  mass  index 
(BMI)  (kg/m2)  was  estimated  by  dividing  weight  by  the 
height squared. The measurements of BP and anthropo-
metric variables were performed at baseline and the end 
of the intervention.

Migraine headache assessment

Other variables

Patients  were  provided  with  a  1-month  headache  diary 
and  asked  to  fill  in  the  information  regarding  headache 
severity  (based  on  the  visual  analog  scale  (VAS)),  dura-
tion (hour), and frequency of attacks per month. Patients 
were  instructed  to  fulfill  the  diaries  1  month  before  the 
initiation of the intervention and in the last month of the 
intervention (weeks 8 to 12).

The  short-from  Headache  Impact  Test-6  (HIT-6) 
was  used  to  evaluate  the  ability  of  normal  functioning 
in  daily  life  at  baseline  and  at  the  end  of  the  interven-
tion  [31].  This  validated  tool  encompasses  6  questions 
in  the  domains  of  social  role  functioning,  pain,  emo-
tional  distress,  well-being,  cognitive  functioning,  and 
vitality.  To  score  responses  following  values  were  used: 

A standard checklist was used in the first visit to gather 
information  regarding  patients’  age,  sex,  marital  status, 
number of households, family history of migraine, medi-
cation  use,  smoking,  education,  and  menopausal  status. 
Patients  were  asked  to  complete  6  dietary  records  (1 
record  every  2  weeks)  during  the  intervention  to  evalu-
ate  their  dietary  intakes.  The  reported  portion  sizes  of 
consumed foods were converted to grams per day using 
household  measures.  The  daily  intake  of  energy  and 
nutrients  was  computed  using  the  Nutritionist  IV  soft-
ware. Patients also recorded their physical activity in two 
non-consecutive days. Physical activity data collected by 
these  records  were  converted  to  Metabolic  Equivalent 
Task hours per day (MET.hr/d).

The  21-item  Depression,  Anxiety,  and  Stress  Scale 
(DASS)  questionnaire  was  used  to  estimate  the  psycho-
logical  characteristics  of  patients  both  at  baseline  and 
after 12 weeks of the intervention. This questionnaire has 
shown  acceptable  psychometric  properties  of  validity, 
internal consistency, and test–retest reliability among the 
Iranian adult population [32]. The tool evaluates depres-
sion, anxiety, and distress during the last week. Each sub-
scale  contained  7  questions  rating  on  a  4-point  Likert 
scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) with a 
total score varied from 0 to 21 for each subscale. Higher 
scores for each subscale represented higher symptoms of 
depression, anxiety, and distress.

Statistical analysis

The  Kolmogorov–Smirnov  test  was  used  to  assess  the 
normality  of  continuous  variables.  Data  were  reported 
as  mean  (SD  or  SE)  for  quantitative  variables  and  fre-
quency  (percentage)  for  qualitative  variables.  Baseline 
characteristics were compared between two groups using 
independent samples t-test and Pearson’s chi-square test 
for continuous variables and qualitative variables, respec-
tively.  Furthermore,  a  paired  sample  t-test  was  used 
to  evaluate  within-group  changes  of  variables  during 
12  weeks  of  intervention.  To  assess  differences  between 

two intervention groups, independent samples t-test and 
analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  were  applied.  Taking 
tricyclic  antidepressants  (TCAs),  taking  triptans,  and 
baseline  values  of  MAP  were  considered  as  covariates. 
Both  per-protocol  and  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  analyses 
were  performed.  The  last-observation-carried-forward 
method was used to treat missing values in ITT analyses. 
SPSS  software  version  20  (IBM,  Chicago,  IL)  was  used 
to perform statistical analyses and a P-value < 0.05 (two-
tailed) was considered statistically significant.

the two groups in terms of reductions in migraine head-
ache frequency (P = 0.031) and severity (P = 0.017). How-

Regarding  the  scores  of  depression,  anxiety,  and  dis-
tress,  there  was  no  significant  difference  between  two 
groups  of  intervention  at  baseline  (data  not  shown). 
Table  4  describes  the  effect  of  probiotic  and  vitamin 
D  co-supplementation  on  mental  health  indices  of 
depression,  anxiety,  and  distress  (based  on  ITT  analy-

was  significantly  decreased  in  the  probiotic  and  vita-

Figure 3 shows the effect of probiotic and vitamin D co-
supplementation on serum levels of hs-CRP in migraine 
patients.  Based  on  ITT  analysis  (Fig.  3A),  a  non-signifi-

±
in  the  probiotic  and  vitamin  D  (1.53  ±  0.23  vs.  1.85

P = 0.382)  groups  compared  to  the  baseline  values.  No 
significant difference was observed in hs-CRP reduction 
between  the  two  groups  according  to  between-group 
analyses (P = 0.959) and analysis of covariance (P = 0.784). 
The same results were derived from per-protocol analysis 
(Fig. 3B).

No  side  effect  related  to  probiotic  and  vitamin  D  co-
supplementation  was  reported  neither  in  the  probiotic 
and vitamin D group nor in the placebo group.

Discussion
Our  findings  showed  that  probiotic  and  vitamin  D  co-
supplementation for 12 weeks could result in a significant 
reduction  in  migraine  headache  frequency  and  slight 
decreases  in  migraine  headache  duration  and  severity. 
After taking covariates into account, only migraine head-
ache frequency and severity were substantially decreased 
by this intervention. Probiotic and vitamin D co-supple-
mentation  had  no  effects  on  daily  functioning,  mental 
health  outcomes,  and  serum  levels  of  hs-CRP  in  adult 
patients with migraine.

The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the 
first randomized clinical trial that investigated the effect 
of probiotic and vitamin D co-supplementation on clini-
cal  and  psychological  features  of  migraine  headaches. 
The  findings  of  the  present  study  are  consistent  with 
a  previous  randomized  clinical  trial  by  Martami  et  al., 
which  investigated  the  effect  of  a  multispecies  probiotic

supplementation  (a  single  daily  dose  of  two  capsules; 
2.5 ×  109  CFU)  on  clinical  characteristics  of  migraine 
after  10  and  8  weeks  of  intervention  in  patients  with 
episodic  and  chronic  migraine  respectively.  The  men-
tioned  study  demonstrated  that  probiotic  supplementa-
tion caused a significant reduction in the frequency and 
severity of migraine headaches compared to the placebo 
group. However, the results of the study showed a signifi-
cant  reduction  in  the  duration  of  migraine  attacks  only 
in  patients  with  chronic  migraine  [25].  An  open-label 
study  also  evaluated  the  effect  of  multispecies  probiotic 
supplementation (a single daily dose; 5 ×  109 CFU) on 63 

patients  with  migraine  headaches  for  12  weeks.  In  con-
trast  to  our  findings,  that  study  failed  to  show  any  sig-
nificant  influence  on  migraine  headache  characteristics 
[24]. The difference in the results of that study is probably 
due  to  the  difference  in  the  study  population,  such  that 
the study has been performed on patients with episodic 
migraine.  The  dose  and  bacterial  species  of  the  probi-
otic  supplement  are  also  different  from  the  supplement 
administered  in  the  present  study.  Additionally,  vitamin 
D may enhance the effectiveness of probiotic supplemen-
tation in the present study. However, further research is 
needed  to  compare  the  effects  of  probiotic  and  vitamin

D co-supplementation with supplementation with either 
of  these  agents  alone.  Findings  of  the  above-mentioned 
studies,  like  our  findings,  demonstrated  no  significant 
difference  between  the  probiotic  and  placebo  groups 
regarding  the  changes  in  inflammatory  biomarkers  such 
as  TNF-α  and  CRP  [24,  25].  The  role  of  probiotic  sup-
plementation  on  the  HIT-6  score  has  not  been  investi-
gated  previously.  HIT-6  measures  headache  impact  on 
social  and  role  functioning,  vitality,  cognitive  function-
ing, and psychological distress in patients with migraine 
[33].  In  the  present  study,  probiotic  and  vitamin  D  co-
supplementation  resulted  in  no  significant  difference 
in  HIT-6  score  compared  to  the  placebo,  which  can  be 
explained  by  the  possible  effect  of  other  factors  such  as 
the  migraine  type  and  psychological  disorders  on  the 
score [34–36]. A randomized clinical trial indicated that 
vitamin D supplementation with a dose of 100 µg/day (or 
4000  IU/d)  could  significantly  decrease  migraine  head-
ache  frequency  compared  to  placebo.  However,  no  sig-
nificant  effects  on  migraine  headache  severity,  number 
of  days  with  migraine,  and  HIT-6  score  were  observed 
[28]. A marginally significant reduction in the frequency 
of  migraine  headaches  after  10  weeks  of  intervention 
was  reported  in  another  randomized  clinical  trial  that 
investigated  the  effect  of  vitamin  D  supplementation  of 
50,000 IU/week in migraine patients. However, this study 
did not report a significant difference in the severity and 
duration of migraine headache as well as serum levels of 
CRP  [27].  Ghorbani  et  al.,  in  another  randomized  clini-
cal trial, showed that daily intake of vitamin D 2000 IU/d 
resulted  in  a  significant  reduction  in  migraine  days  per 
month, migraine attacks duration, and severity than pla-
cebo  in  subjects  with  episodic  migraine  [29].  Previous 
reports regarding the favorable role of vitamin D supple-
mentation  on  migraine  headache  are  controversial,  and 
are  possibly  associated  with  differences  in  study  design, 
studied  patients,  baseline  vitamin  D  levels,  and  sup-
plement  dosage.  Given  the  differences  in  the  design  of 
previous  studies  and  the  controversial  results  obtained 
from  them,  more  randomized  clinical  trials  are  needed 
to  discover  the  efficacy  of  vitamin  D  and  probiotic  sup-
plementation alone or in combination with each other on 
migraine headache.

Prior  investigations  have  stated  that  patients  with 
migraine headaches, mainly those with chronic migraine 
or migraine with aura, are at an increased risk of psychiat-
ric disorders such as anxiety and depression which would 
increase the burden and decrease treatment response in 
these  patients  [37,  38].  No  study  has  previously  investi-
gated the effect of probiotic and vitamin D supplementa-
tion on mental health outcomes in migraine patients. The 
results of the present study failed to show any significant 
effects  of  probiotics  and  vitamin  D  co-supplementation 

on  mental  health  outcomes.  Furthermore,  based  on  the 
results  of  recent  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses, 
the effect of probiotics [39–41] or vitamin D [42, 43] sup-
plementation on mental health indices in various popula-
tions might be doubtful. Thus, further studies should be 
conducted to investigate the effect of probiotics and vita-
min  D  supplementations  alone  or  in  combination  with 
each other on mental health outcomes in different popu-
lations, including migraine patients.

The  favorable  effect  of  probiotics  and  vitamin  D  co-
supplementation  on  some  clinical  characteristics  of 
migraine  headaches  can  be  explained  by  several  poten-
tial  mechanisms.  Previous  findings  have  shown  that  gut 
microbiota  dysbiosis  and  increased  gut  permeability 
stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines which 
lead  to  migraine  headache  initiation  by  inducing  nocic-
eptive  responses  in  the  trigeminal  pathway  [17,  44–46]. 
Thus, it seems that treatment options affecting gut micro-
biota  such  as  vitamin  D  and  probiotic  supplementation 
can alleviate migraine headache symptoms by improving 
gut microbiota dysbiosis and consequent related inflam-
matory  and  immune  responses.  In  the  present  study, 
we  could  not  find  any  effect  of  probiotics  and  vitamin 
D  co-supplementation  on  serum  levels  of  hs-CRP  as  an 
inflammatory  biomarker.  Further  research  is  needed  to 
investigate  the  effect  of  co-supplementation  with  vita-
min D and probiotics on other inflammatory biomarkers 
such as IL-6, IL-β, and TNF-α. Additionally, it has been 
documented  that  serotonin  is  a  key  neurotransmitter  in 
migraine  pathophysiology,  as  serotonin  levels  decrease 
between  migraine  attacks  and  transiently  increase  dur-
ing  attacks  [47].  The  gut  microbiota  impacts  serotonin 
synthesis and signaling in the GI tract [48, 49]. Therefore, 
probably one of the mechanisms through which probiotic 
and  vitamin  D  supplementation  can  improve  migraine 
headaches is altering gut microbiota and peripheral syn-
thesis of serotonin.

The present study has some strengths and weaknesses. 
First  of  all,  this  is  the  first  randomized  clinical  trial  that 
investigated  the  effect  of  probiotics  and  vitamin  D  co-
supplementation  on  adult  patients  with  migraine  head-
aches.  Additionally,  patients  had  high  adherence  to 
treatment  considering  regular  weekly  reminders  and 
serum  vitamin  D  improvement.  The  present  study  was 
performed  on  both  sexes;  however,  the  majority  of  par-
ticipants  were  females,  which  is  due  to  the  higher  prev-
alence  of  migraine  headaches  in  females  than  males. 
However,  it  limits  the  generalizability  of  our  findings  to 
males. Several covariates such as blood pressure, weight, 
menopausal  status,  and  medication  use  were  consid-
ered  in  this  trial;  nevertheless,  other  confounders  such 
as  exposure  to  migraine  triggers,  stressful  life  events, 
sleep  quality,  and  sleep  duration  which  may  affect  our 

 Tirani et al. BMC Medicine  (2024) 22:457

results  remained  to  be  assessed.  Furthermore,  evalua-
tions  of  physical  activity  and  dietary  intakes  of  patients 
were based on self-reported data which might be subject 
to various biases such as reactivity or selective-reporting 
bias.  Given  the  limited  financial  resources,  it  was  not 
possible to compare the effect of probiotics and vitamin 
D  co-supplementations  on  migraine  features  to  that  of 
probiotics and vitamin D alone. Finally, we did not gather 
information  regarding  the  type  of  migraine  headache 
(episodic or chronic); thus, it was not possible to evaluate 
the efficacy of probiotic and vitamin D co-supplementa-
tion by the type of migraine headache.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we found that probiotic and vitamin D co-
supplementation may have beneficial effects on migraine 
headache  frequency  and  severity,  but  did  not  affect 
migraine headache duration, and serum levels of hs-CRP. 
Further research is required to find alternative treatment 
options  for  the  management  of  mental  health  problems 
in migraineurs.
