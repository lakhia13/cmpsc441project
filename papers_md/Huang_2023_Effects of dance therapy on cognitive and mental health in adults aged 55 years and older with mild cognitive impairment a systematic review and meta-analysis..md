Abstract 
Background  Individuals with mild cognitive impairment are at high risk of developing dementia. Dance therapy 
has promising applications in delaying cognitive decline. However, the effectiveness of dance therapy for older adults 
with mild cognitive impairment is unclear. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of dance 
therapy on global cognitive function, specific cognitive subdomains, quality of life, and mental health in older adults 
with mild cognitive impairment to enrich health management strategies for dementia.

Methods  Electronic databases and grey literature were searched from inception up to September 23, 2023. The lan‑
guage was limited to English and Chinese. Relevant studies were screened and assessed for risk of bias. A meta‑anal‑
ysis and subgroup analyses stratified by measurement instrument, dance type, intervention duration, and frequency 
were conducted using the STATA 16.0 software. This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines.

Results  Ten studies involving 984 participants aged 55 years and over who met the eligibility criteria were included. 
Dance therapy significantly improved global cognitive function, memory, executive function, attention, language, 
and mental health (i.e., depression and neuropsychiatric symptoms). However, the effects of dance therapy on pro‑
cessing speed, visuospatial ability, and quality of life in older adults with mild cognitive impairment remain inconclu‑
sive. Moreover, dance interventions of longer duration (> 3 months) improved global cognition more than shorter 
interventions.

Conclusion  This review reported that dance therapy was effective in improving global cognitive function, memory, 
executive function, attention, language, and mental health (i.e., depression and neuropsychiatric symptoms). Hence, it 
may be an effective non‑pharmacological complementary treatment for older adults with mild cognitive impairment.

Background
Rapid  global  aging  leads  to  a  dramatic  increase  in  the 
prevalence of age-related cognitive impairment. Research 
shows that the number of older individuals with demen-
tia  is  increasing  globally  and  is  expected  to  rise  to  152 
million  by  2050  [1].  China  has  the  largest  number  of 
individuals with dementia, accounting for approximately 
25% of the total global dementia population; this places a

heavy  economic  and  social  burden  on  the  public  health 
system [2].

Given the irreversible course of dementia and the limi-
tations  of  treatment,  there  is  a  growing  interest  in  early 
preventive  interventions.  Mild  cognitive  impairment 
(MCI) is a transitional condition between normal aging-
related cognitive decline and dementia, with a high prob-
ability for regression to dementia [3]. According to data, 
the  incidence  of  MCI  among  adults  aged ≥ 60  years  in 
China is 15.54%, and the number of patients is 38.77 mil-
lion  [4].  Considering  that  MCI  puts  individuals  at  high 
risk  for  developing  dementia,  early  intervention  at  this 
stage may be effective in preventing or slowing the pro-
gression  to  dementia.  Due  to  the  limited  efficacy  of  the 
currently  available  pharmacological  treatments  for  MCI 
and  the  presence  of  certain  drug  side  effects  [5],  non-
pharmacological  treatments  aimed  at  delaying  disease 
progression and improving quality of life have become a 
hot topic of research.

A  series  of  studies  have  reported  the  potential  ben-
efits  of  non-pharmacological  cognitive  interventions 
in  improving  cognitive  function  and  promoting  men-
tal  health  [6,  7].  The  provision  of  non-pharmacological 
care  to  individuals  with  MCI  may  be  a  good  approach. 
Despite  the  rapid  increase  in  various  types  of  non-
pharmacological  interventions  over  the  past  few  years, 
adherence  to  interventions  among  older  adults  with 
MCI appears to be poor and there is significant variabil-
ity  between  individuals  [8,  9].  Possible  reasons  affecting 
the  adherence  include  lack  of  motivation  to  participate, 
low  interest,  single  form  of  intervention,  and  repetition 
[8].  Therefore,  non-pharmacological  interventions  that 
are enjoyable and fun are more likely to improve adher-
ence among individuals [10]. A growing body of evidence 
suggests  that  dance  therapy  (DT)  appears  to  be  a  better 
intervention and has shown significant benefits in terms 
of improving cognitive function and other health-related 
outcomes [7, 11, 12]. DT is a physical and mental activ-
ity  in  which  the  body  moves  purposefully  and  rhythmi-
cally to music and is often considered an enjoyable form 
of  multimodal  activity  [13].  This  physical  and  cognitive 
practice associated with music can motivate individuals, 
channel emotions, trigger memories, and avoid boredom, 
thus creating an interest in continuing the practice [14]. 
The  pleasure  and  enjoyment  experienced  by  individuals 
through dance increases the likelihood of regular partici-
pation and adherence, which may be essential in achiev-
ing long-term health benefits [15].

DT induces and has long-term positive effects on neu-
roplasticity,  such  as  learning  and  remembering  com-
plex  motor  movements,  focusing  attention  on  following 
instructions,  executing  complex  movement  patterns, 
integrating  visual  and  rhythmic  movements,  and  social 

cognition  that  links  emotional  expression  between  indi-
viduals in social interactions [16]. DT is also fundamen-
tally  a  social  activity  with  proven  benefits  in  promoting 
social participation in older adults with MCI, which may 
also  be  associated  with  better  cognitive  outcomes  [16]. 
Emerging  evidence  suggests  that  dance-based  interven-
tions  are  less  expensive  to  implement,  easy  to  apply  in 
different  settings  (e.g.,  clinics,  community  centers,  and 
nursing homes), and promote physical and mental health 
in  older  individuals  in  a  variety  of  settings  [17].  Hence, 
DT  may  be  a  powerful  intervention  that  can  be  eas-
ily  promoted  to  older  individuals  with  MCI  as  part  of  a 
healthy lifestyle.

DT  may  help  maintain  or  improve  cognitive  func-
tion  and  reduce  the  risk  of  developing  dementia  over 
time.  However,  existing  systematic  reviews  of  DT  have 
reported  inconsistent  results  regarding  improvements 
in  cognitive  function  [7,  11,  12].  Furthermore,  there  is 
limited examination of key issues, such as mental health, 
which  have  been  strongly  associated  with  quality  of  life 
in individuals with MCI [18]. Therefore, we conducted a 
systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  of  all  available  rel-
evant  evidence  (including  published  and  grey  literature) 
to examine the effects of DT compared with any control 
group (positive control or no intervention) on global cog-
nitive  function,  specific  cognitive  subdomains,  mental 
health, and quality of life in older adults with MCI. Fur-
thermore,  we  explored  whether  different  measurement 
instruments, types of dances, and duration and frequency 
of interventions affect the effectiveness of DT.

Methods
Design

This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted 
in  strict  accordance  with  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items 
for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA) 
guidelines [19] (Additional file 1). The study protocol was 
registered in PROSPERO (Number: CRD42018096085).

Data sources and search methods

The  following  English  and  Chinese  electronic  databases 
were searched: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Reg-
ister  of  Controlled  Trials,  Cumulative  Index  to  Nursing 
and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, PsycINFO, 
ProQuest Dissertations &Theses, Scopus, Taiwanese Air-
iti  Library,  Chinese  National  Knowledge  Infrastructure, 
Chinese Wanfang database, China Science and Technol-
ogy Journal Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature 
Database. Literature published from inception up to Sep-
tember 23, 2023, was checked. We used a combination of 
subject terms and free words to develop the search strat-
egy.  Appropriate  search  queries  were  developed  based 
on  the  characteristics  of  each  database.  The  full  search

strategies  for  all  databases  are  available  in  Additional 
file 2. Additional searches were conducted using Google 
Scholar to identify unpublished or grey literature.

(5)  Outcomes: Any of the outcomes in global cognitive 
function,  specific  cognitive  subdomains,  quality  of 
life, and mental health.

Eligibility criteria and study selection

All  retrieved  documents  were  first  de-duplicated  using 
Endnote X9 and manual screening. Two reviewers inde-
pendently  identified  studies  that  potentially  met  the 
inclusion  criteria  by  reading  the  titles  and/or  abstracts 
of the articles for inclusion. Disagreements between two 
reviewers  were  resolved  by  a  third  reviewer.  The  inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria were as follows:

(1)  Study  design:  Both  randomized  controlled  trials 
(RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) written 
in English and Chinese were included in this review. 
Non-experimental  studies,  protocols,  and  reviews 
were excluded.

(2)  Population:  Older  adults  (aged ≥ 55  years)  diag-
nosed with MCI at baseline were eligible for inclu-
sion.  The  decision  to  focus  on  the  age  range  of  55 
years  and  above  was  influenced  by  the  increasing 
prevalence  of  MCI  with  advancing  age.  Addition-
ally, considering that MCI represents a transitional 
stage  between  normal  aging  and  mild  dementia, 
early intervention becomes notably crucial, and an 
expanding body of research is specifically targeting 
the age group of 55 years and above [20, 21]. There-
fore,  our  choice  was  based  on  a  specific  emphasis 
on  the  study  population  and  our  research  objec-
tives.  The  diagnosis  of  MCI  was  established  using 
the  Petersen  criteria  [22],  revised  Petersen  criteria 
[23, 24], Matthews criteria [25], a Clinical Demen-
tia  Rating  score  of  0.5  [26],  the  National  Institute 
on  Aging-Alzheimer’  Association  core  clinical  cri-
teria [27], or a combination of these. There were no 
restrictions on the type of residence (e.g., commu-
nity  living,  home  living,  or  nursing  home),  sex,  or 
ethnicity.  Samples  with  varying  levels  of  cognition 
(e.g., MCI and dementia patients; MCI and healthy 
older adults), were excluded.

(3)  Intervention: Participants in the intervention group 
exclusively  received  dance  interventions,  without 
any  restrictions  on  the  frequency,  type,  duration, 
or  location  of  these  interventions.  Frequency  was 
quantified  by  considering  both  the  length  of  indi-
vidual  dance  sessions  and  the  number  of  classes 
conducted  per  week,  while  type  referred  to  the 
specific dance genre taught in each study. Duration 
encompassed the overall intervention period.

(4)  Comparator: Any control group (e.g., no treatment 

control, waitlist control, or active control).

Data extraction

Relevant key information was extracted by one researcher 
according to a pre-designed data extraction form, while a 
second researcher reviewed the data. Any disagreements 
were  resolved  through  discussion  or  with  the  assistance 
of  a  third  researcher.  Missing  data  were  requested  from 
the  authors,  as  applicable.  Extracts  included  author 
name,  publication  year,  country,  study  design,  set-
ting,  participant  demographics  (e.g.,  the  total  number 
of  participants,  number  of  males  and  females,  and  age), 
intervention  details  (e.g.,  frequency,  type,  duration,  and 
follow-up),  indicators  of  feasibility  (e.g.,  dropout  rate, 
attendance rate, and adverse events) and outcome meas-
ures  (e.g.,  measurement  instruments  and  assessment 
times).

Quality assessment

Two  reviewers  independently  used  the  Risk  of  Bias  2.0 
(RoB 2.0) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies-
of interventions to evaluate the potential for bias in RCTs 
and  CCTs  from  different  aspects  [28,  29].  To  guide  the 
reviewer’s  judgement,  the  assessment  tool  sets  out  mul-
tiple  signal  questions  for  the  evaluation  of  each  module 
and  provides  details  on  the  parameters  that  should  be 
considered when answering each signal question. Moreo-
ver, two reviewers judged the overall risk of bias for each 
study  based  on  the  combination  of  the  modules.  Disa-
greements were resolved by a third reviewer.

Data synthesis and analysis

The  STATA  16.0  software  was  used  for  the  meta-analy-
sis.  Pooled  standardized  mean  difference  (SMD)  of  the 
experimental  group  and  the  control  group  was  deter-
mined  using  random-  and  fixed-effects  models.  The 
SMD  and  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  reported. 
The heterogeneity between study results was determined 
using  I2  statistics  (I2 > 50%  indicates  moderate-to-sub-
stantial heterogeneity). In the absence of significant het-
erogeneity,  a  fixed-effects  model  (p > .05  and  I2 < 50%) 
was  used;  conversely,  a  random-effects  model  (p < .05, 
I2 > 50%) was adopted, and sources of heterogeneity were 
sought  through  subgroup  analysis.  Additional  subgroup 
analyses were performed on the effect of dance on results 
with  regard  to  the  measuring  instrument,  dance  type, 
and  duration  and  frequency  of  dance  interventions  (if 
applicable).  In  addition,  sensitivity  analysis  was  used  to 
judge the stability of outcome indicators, and the differ-
ences between pooled effect sizes were compared mainly 
by  eliminating  the  included  studies  on  an  item-by-item

basis. Funnel plots were used to examine publication bias 
(Additional  file  3).  Furthermore,  Egger’s  regression  test 
[30]  was  conducted  to  visualize  and  evaluate  the  funnel 
plots,  and  a  statistically  significant  difference  (p < .05) 
denoted  the  presence  of  publication  bias.  A  narrative 
synthesis  was  performed  in  case  of  insufficient  data  for 
meta-analysis.

Results
Search outcome

A total of 3,413 records were retrieved from the databases 
and  manual  searches.  Of  those,  1,221  duplicate  records 
were removed using Endnote X9, and 1,998 records were 
excluded  after  reading  the  titles  and  abstracts.  Subse-
quently, 194 articles were selected for full-text screening; 

of  those,  10  studies  that  met  the  inclusion  criteria  were 
eventually included in the review. The PRISMA flow dia-
gram is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Included study characteristics

Seven RCTs and three CCTs published between 2016 and 
2021  in  English  and  Chinese  were  included  in  the  sys-
tematic review. Studies were conducted in Spain [31, 32], 
the  Philippines  [33],  Japan  [34],  Greece  [35],  and  China 
[36–40]. These studies involved a total of 984 older adults 
(mean age range: 65–81 years) with MCI (defined based 
on  the  Peterson  criteria)  who  were  recruited  from  the 
community  (n = 4),  nursing  homes  (n = 3),  and  clinical 
settings (n = 3).

The  types  of  dance  used  in  the  intervention  group 
were  mostly  closely  related  to  the  local  folklore  and 
socio-cultural  context,  with  five  studies  involving  ball-
room  dance  [31,  33–35,  38],  three  studies  involving 
square  dance  [37,  39,  40],  and  two  studies  involving 
aerobic  dance  [32,  36].  All  studies  were  conducted  in 
groups  with  a  focus  on  social  participation.  The  dura-
tion  of  the  intervention  ranged  12–48  weeks  and  con-
sisted  of  1–3  weekly  sessions  of  30–60  min.  Typical 
sessions  followed  a  ‘low-high-low’  pattern  in  intensity 
and  were  divided  into  three  phases,  namely  warm-up, 
dance,  and  cool-down.  The  control  group  consisted  of 
music,  physical  therapy,  health  education,  and  usual 
care. One study [31] included a control group of partic-
ipants who were waitlisted. All included studies focused 
on outcome indicators related to cognitive functioning. 
Moreover,  nine  studies  addressed  indicators  of  mental 
health,  and  five  studies  addressed  indicators  of  quality 
of life. Only two studies [31, 32] reported results for 12 
and  16  weeks  of  follow-up,  respectively.  The  summary 

of study characteristics and outcome measures are pre-
sented in Tables 1 and 2.

Nine  studies  [31–37,  39,  40]  reported  the  partici-
pant dropout rate, which is defined as the percentage of 
participants  who  withdrew  or  discontinued  their  par-
ticipation  in  the  intervention  before  its  completion. The 
dropout  rates  of  these  studies  were  all  less  than  20%. 
Reasons  for  discontinuation  of  the  dance  intervention 
included  health-related  problems  (e.g.,  back  pain,  knee 
pain  and  other  illnesses)  [31,  33,  34,  36,  39,  40],  fam-
ily  problems  [35,  36],  leaving  the  country  [31,  33],  join-
ing other activity groups [37], and declining to continue 
for personal reasons [32, 33, 37, 39]. The attendance rate 
refers to the percentage of participants who attended the 
scheduled  intervention  sessions  or  classes.  Five  studies 
[31–34,  40]  reported  on  adherence  to  the  intervention, 
with rates ranging from 80.29 to 95.10% attendance. Rea-
sons for missed dance classes included illness [31, 33, 34], 
course  difficulty  [31],  and  scheduling  conflicts  [31].  Six 
studies  [31,  33,  34,  36,  37,  40]  also  reported  on  adverse

events, defined as any unexpected or harmful events that 
participants  may  have  experienced  during  the  interven-
tion. However, there were no adverse events reported in 
any of these studies. The summary of the study feasibility 
is presented in Table 2.

Risk of bias and quality assessment

The  quality  of  RCTs  was  rigorously  assessed  based  on 
five domains using the RoB 2.0 tool. Two studies [32, 34] 
were linked to an overall low risk of bias. One study [36] 
was linked to some concern regarding the risk of bias due 
to  deviations  from  intended  intervention,  missing  out-
come data, and selection of the reported result. Another 
study [31] was linked to some concern regarding the risk 
of bias, arising from the selection of the reported result. 
Furthermore, three studies [35, 38, 39] were linked to an 
overall  high  or  some  concern  regarding  the  risk  of  bias 
owing  to  deviations  from  the  intended  intervention.  All 
seven studies were linked to a low risk of bias regarding 
the randomization process and measuring outcomes. For 
the CCTs, all studies were linked to a low risk of bias with 
respect  to  the  selection  of  participants,  classification  of 
interventions,  and  measuring  outcomes.  Details  on  the 
risk of bias are presented in Additional file 4.

Study outcomes
Meta‑analysis of the effect of DT on cognitive function

The meta-analysis indicated that DT had a highly signifi-
cant effect on global cognitive function (SMD = 0.94; 95% 
CI:  0.57,  1.30),  as  well  as  on  memory  (SMD = 0.50;  95% 
CI: 0.33, 0.68), executive function (SMD = − 0.34; 95% CI: 
−0.56, − 0.12), attention (SMD = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.57), 
and  language  domain  (SMD = 0.42;  95%  CI:  0.22,  0.63). 
However,  no  beneficial  effects  were  found  in  processing 
speed (SMD = − 0.22, 95% CI: −0.59, 0.15) and visuospa-
tial  ability  (SMD = 0.35;  95%  CI:  −0.35,  1.06). There  was 
substantial  heterogeneity  across  the  studies  for  global 
cognitive  function  (I2 = 88%,  p < .001),  processing  speed 
(I2 = 65%,  p = .007),  and  visuospatial  ability  (I2 = 69.4%; 
p = .071).  Low  heterogeneity  among  the  studies  was 
observed  for  memory  (I2 = 0%,  p = .742),  executive  func-
tion (I2 = 0%, p = .604), attention (I2 = 11.4%, p = .341), and 
language  domain  (I2 = 0%,  p = .759). The  effect  of  DT  on 
specific cognitive subdomains of older adults with MCI is 
depicted in Additional file 5.

Subgroup analyses of the effect of DT on global cognitive 
function

Effect of the measurement instrument on global cognitive 
function  Subgroup  analysis  was  conducted  to  compare 
the  interaction  between  two  subgroups  using  differ-
ent  measurement  instruments.  The  Mini-Mental  State 

Examination  (MMSE)  and  Montreal  Cognitive  Assess-
ment  (MoCA)  were  adopted  to  assess  global  cognitive 
function  among  the  included  studies.  Subgroup  analysis 
showed that the effect size of the MoCA subgroup (SMD 
= 1.00; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.41) was slightly larger than that of 
the  MMSE  subgroup  (SMD  =  0.86;  95%  CI:  0.17,  1.55). 
The effect sizes for both subgroups were statistically sig-
nificant,  and  high  heterogeneity  was  observed  in  both 
groups (I2 = 83%, p < .001; I2 = 92%, p < .001) (Fig. 2).

Effect  of  dance  type  on  global  cognitive  function  Sub-
group  analysis  was  carried  out  using  dance  type  (e.g., 
social dance, aerobic dance, and square dance) as a clas-
sification  indicator.  The  meta-analysis  employing  a  ran-
dom-effects model revealed highly statistically significant 
differences  in  global  cognitive  function  compared  with 
the control group for social dance (SMD = 1.28; 95% CI: 
0.67, 1.88) and square dance (SMD = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.31, 
1.45).  Additionally,  the  effect  of  aerobic  dance  was  not 
significant (SMD = 0.33; 95% CI: −0.01, 0.66), and there 
was no heterogeneity observed among the included stud-
ies  (I2  =  0%,  p  =  .426).  Nevertheless,  there  was  consid-
erable  heterogeneity  of  effect  sizes  for  global  cognitive 
function (I2 = 88%, p < .001) (Fig. 3).

Effect  of  intervention  duration  and  frequency  on  global 
cognitive  function  Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted 
using intervention duration (≤ 12 weeks or > 12 weeks) 
and intervention frequency (< 3 times/week or ≥ 3 times/
week) as subgroup indicators.

Intervention duration 

Four  studies  all  conducted  dance  interventions  for  12 
weeks,  and  five  studies  conducted  dance  interventions 
for 18–48 weeks. The subgroup analysis revealed that DT 
had a significant impact on the global cognitive function 
of  older  adults  with  MCI,  regardless  of  the  intervention 
duration  (SMD = 0.94;  95%  CI:  0.57,  1.30).  There  was 
substantial  heterogeneity  in  both  subgroups  (I2 = 91.8%, 
p < .001; I2 = 78.0%, p < .001). Nevertheless, the effect size 
of the intervention duration > 12 weeks (SMD = 1.17; 95% 
CI: 0.65, 1.69) was larger than that of duration ≤ 12 weeks 
(SMD = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.17, 1.13) (Fig. 4).

Intervention frequency

Five  studies  had  an  intervention  frequency  of  ≥ 3  times 
per week, and four studies had an intervention frequency 
of  < 3  times  per  week.  The  meta-analysis  using  a  ran-
dom-effects  model  demonstrated  that  DT  had  a  signifi-
cant effect on global cognitive function regardless of the 
intervention frequency (SMD = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.30).

State Examination; MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment; SMD, Standardized Mean Difference

Moreover, the intervention frequency ≥ 3 times per week 
(SMD = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.70) has a greater effect size 
than < 3 times per week (SMD = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.12). 
However,  the  heterogeneity  was  substantial  for  these 
two  subgroups  (I2 = 90.3%,  p < .001;  I2 = 83.3%,  p < .001) 
(Fig. 5).

Effect of DT on mental health

Mental health is considered as the well-being of an indi-
vidual’s  spiritual  dimension.  Related  outcomes,  such 
as  depression  and  neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  were 
reported  in  seven  studies  involving  613  participants. 
According to the meta-analysis, DT showed significantly 
greater  improvement  in  mental  health  compared  with 
the control group (SMD = − 0.49; 95% CI: −0.77, − 0.21). 
However,  there  was  a  high  heterogeneity  in  the  effect 
sizes (I2 = 74.3%, p < .001) (Fig. 6).

Effect of DT on quality of life

Five studies examined the effect of DT on quality of life 
using  the  12-Item  Short  Form  Health  Survey  (SF-12), 
36-Item  Short  Form  Health  Survey  (SF-36),  and  Qual-
ity of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD). A total of 287 
participants  were  pooled  for  meta-analysis  using  the 
random-effects model. The results demonstrated that DT 

did not exhibit a significant improvement in quality of life 
(SMD = 0.39; 95% CI: −0.11, 0.88). In addition, consider-
able  heterogeneity  was  observed  among  the  five  studies 
(I2 = 74.2%,  p = .004).  The  subgroup  meta-analysis  using 
the  measurement  instrument  as  a  classification  indica-
tor  showed  that  the  SF-12  subgroup  (SMD = 0.87;  95% 
CI:  0.45,  1.29)  was  associated  with  significantly  higher 
efficacy  versus  the  SF-36  (SMD = − 0.10;  95%  CI:  −0.63, 
0.44)  and  QoL-AD  subgroups  (SMD = 0.20;  95%  CI: 
−0.65,  1.06).  Only  the  SF-12  subgroup  reached  statisti-
cal  significance  in  terms  of  effect  size.  Low  heterogene-
ity was observed for both SF-12 (I2 = 40.8%, p = .194) and 
SF-36 (I2 = 35.5%, p = .213) subgroups (Fig. 7).

Sensitivity analysis and publication bias

A  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  on  global  cogni-
tive  function,  and  mental  health.  After  excluding  each 
study  on  an  item-by-item  basis,  changes  in  total  effect 
sizes  were  evaluated,  with  effects  remaining  largely 
unchanged.  Furthermore,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  con-
ducted  on  quality  of  life.  Following  the  exclusion  of  one 
study  [32],  the  results  suggested  a  significant  impact  of 
DT  on  improvements  in  quality  of  life;  these  findings 
contradicted the previous results. Egger’s regression tests 
were  not  significant  for  any  of  the  outcome  indicators,

suggesting  absence  of  publication  bias  (p > .05)  (Addi-
tional file 6).

Discussion
This review found that DT significantly improved global 
cognitive  function,  specific  cognitive  subdomains  (i.e., 
memory,  executive  function,  attention,  language),  and 
mental  health  (i.e.,  depression  and  neuropsychiatric 
symptoms).  Controversy  remains  on  the  role  of  DT  in 
improving  processing  speed,  visuospatial  ability,  and 
quality of life in older adults with MCI.

This systematic review suggested that DT significantly 
improved  global  cognitive  function  in  older  adults  with 
MCI,  consistent  with  a  previous  meta-analysis  [7].  The 
possible  mechanism  underlying  this  effect  may  be  the 
induction  of  neuroplasticity  by  DT  across  seven  neu-
robehavioral  domains,  namely  sensory,  motor,  cogni-
tive,  social,  emotional,  rhythmic,  and  creative  [41].  The 
process  of  engaging  in  DT  requires  a  complex  integra-
tion  of  multiple  sensory  channels  and  fine  motor  con-
trol. Therefore, it may have strong and lasting effects on 
global  cognitive  function  [41].  Furthermore,  Trost  et  al. 
[42]  demonstrated  that  different  music  genres  influence 
brain  processes,  such  as  reward,  memory,  reflexivity, 

and sensorimotor processing, including activation of the 
anterior ventricular prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. 
Therefore,  as  a  music-based  physical  and  mental  activ-
ity, dance may induce similar structural and neuroplastic 
changes in the brain [43].

Impaired  memory  function  is  the  primary  observable 
symptom  in  older  adults  with  MCI  [3].  Encouragingly, 
our results showed that DT was associated with a signifi-
cant  improvement  in  memory,  which  is  consistent  with 
the  findings  of  previous  systematic  reviews  [7,  11,  12]. 
Dance  practice  involves  the  complex  cognitive  process 
of learning and remembering dance sequences or move-
ments, requiring the involvement of different somatosen-
sory  and  cognitive  brain  areas  [41].  In  recent  years,  a 
growing number of studies have evaluated the effects of 
dance on the structure and function of the brain. A study 
assessing  the  effects  of  a  3-month  aerobic  dance  inter-
vention  in  older  adults  with  MCI  revealed  significant 
improvements in fractional anisotropy value in the white 
matter  fiber  tracts  of  the  cingulate  fasciculus  bilaterally, 
the left hippocampus of the cingulate fasciculus, and the 
left  superior  longitudinal  fasciculus  in  the  participants; 
notably,  these  areas  are  closely  related  to  memory  and 
cognitive  function  [44],  consistent  with  the  findings  of 

 Huang et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2023) 23:695

Mean Difference

another study [45]. The hippocampus is the central struc-
ture  of  the  limbic  system  and  plays  a  role  in  short-  and 
long-term  memory  and  spatial  orientation  [46].  Hence, 
hippocampal plasticity may mediate the effects of DT on 
memory improvement in older adults with MCI.

Our  results  showed  that  DT  significantly  enhanced 
executive function among older adults with MCI. Execu-
tive  function  refers  to  the  ability  of  individuals  to  effec-
tively  initiate  and  complete  purposeful  activities. This  is 
a  complex  cognitive  process  involving  planning,  initia-
tion, sequencing, cognitive flexibility, feedback, decision-
making, and judgement [47]. Previous studies have found 
that DT was effective in enhancing cognitive flexibility in 
older  adults  [36];  our  study  yielded  similar  results.  The 
involvement  of  the  prefrontal  lobe  and  the  impairment 
of  communication  function  between  various  cerebral 
regions  in  older  adults  with  MCI  may  be  important  for 
the decline of executive function. Recent work indicated 
that participants who underwent a 6-month intervention 
of  aerobic  dance  experienced  significant  improvements 
in  executive  function  [48].  This  improved  performance 
may be the result of structural and functional changes in 
the prefrontal cortex associated with the dance interven-
tion, as reflected by the greater grey matter volume and 
higher activation in prefrontal regions [49, 50].

It had been shown that DT improves attention in older 
adults [51], and this positive effect was also noted in the 
present study. The dance process involves complex move-
ment  sequences;  this  means  that  participants  need  to 
focus their attention on observing and remembering the 
dance sequences to perform the correct movements [16]. 
The distributed neural network involving the frontal lobe, 
parietal lobe, and temporal lobe reflects the brain activi-
ties related to attention control [52]. A study revealed that 
dancers  showed  stronger  neural  activity  in  the  middle 
frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus than non-dancers; 
these  areas  are  closely  associated  with  attentional  con-
trol [53]. This may provide a preliminary explanation for 
the  improvement  in  attention  performance  induced  by 
DT.  In  addition,  several  previous  systematic  reviews  did 
not yield conclusive results with regard to the beneficial 
effect  of  DT  on  attention,  contradicting  the  findings  of 
this study [7, 11]. Therefore, more RCTs with large sam-
ple  sizes  are  warranted  to  further  validate  the  effects  of 
dance on attention.

Our study indicated that DT had benefits on language, 
but  no  significant  effect  on  visuospatial  ability  and  pro-
cessing speed. The improvement observed in language in 
the  DT  group  could  be  due  to  verbal  interaction  which 
occurs  during  group  dance  sessions.  DT  is  essentially  a

Mean Difference

social  activity  which  provides  a  supportive  environment 
that  maximizes  the  retention  of  participants’  communi-
cation  skills  [16,  54].  In  contrast  with  the  insignificant 
effect detected in our study, previous reviews had identi-
fied  potential  benefits  of  DT  on  visuospatial  ability  [12, 
51,  55].  A  recent  RCT  suggested  that  participation  in  a 
10-month  systematic  dance  session  may  improve  the 
visuospatial  skills  of  older  adults  with  MCI  to  a  greater 
extent  versus  control  [35].  One  possible  explanation  is 
that  dancers  are  trained  to  understand  where  the  body 
is  in  space  and,  consequently,  navigate  and  coordinate 
movements  in  space,  as  well  as  manage  the  spatial  dis-
tance between themselves and others [41]. However, only 
two of the studies included in our meta-analysis reported 
findings  on  visuospatial  ability,  assessed  using  differ-
ent  measurement  instruments.  Additionally,  substantial 
heterogeneity  in  effect  size  was  observed  across  studies. 
These  could  be  among  the  reasons  responsible  for  the 
insignificant  findings  in  this  study.  With  regard  to  pro-
cessing speed, we reached similar conclusions to the pre-
vious  meta-analysis  [7],  which  did  not  find  a  significant 
effect of dance on processing speed in older adults with 
MCI.  This  may  be  due  to  the  small  number  of  included 
studies (only five studies), small sample size, and the use 
of  different  measurement  instruments.  Therefore,  more 

high-quality studies are required to draw credible conclu-
sions on visuospatial ability and processing speed.

Furthermore, this review included subgroup analyses of 
different  intervention  characteristics  (i.e.,  measurement 
instrument,  dance  type,  and  duration  and  frequency  of 
intervention)  to  identify  more  effective  dance  interven-
tions. Consistent with the findings of a previous study [7], 
the results of the subgroup analysis suggested that differ-
ences  in  measurement  tools  did  not  influence  the  effect 
of  the  intervention  on  overall  cognitive  function.  The 
included studies were classified into subgroups according 
to  the  dance  type  (i.e.,  social,  aerobic,  and  square).  The 
type of dance was determined based on the specific con-
tent of the study. The results demonstrated that social and 
square dancing improved global cognitive function; how-
ever,  a  similar  positive  performance  was  not  observed 
with  aerobic  dance.  This  may  be  due  to  the  small  num-
ber of studies (n = 3) and the small sample size (n = 139) 
of  the  aerobic  dance  subgroup.  In  addition,  there  was 
high  heterogeneity  in  the  design  of  interventions  across 
dance  types,  including  intervention  duration  and  fre-
quency,  which  may  lead  to  different  estimates  of  effect 
sizes.  Subgroup  analysis  results  identified  a  significant 
effect of DT on global cognitive function regardless of the 
duration and frequency of the intervention. Nonetheless,

Scale; NPI, Neuropsychiatric Inventory; SMD, Standardized Mean Difference

interventions of longer duration (> 12 weeks) and higher 
frequency  (≥ 3  times  per  week)  showed  a  larger  pooled 
effect  size,  in  line  with  previous  findings  [7].  One  pos-
sible  explanation  is  that  a  longer  duration  of  interven-
tion  and  more  frequent  interventions  can  provide  more 
stimulation  for  participants  to  maintain  the  effective-
ness of the intervention. However, due to significant dif-
ferences  in  the  duration  and  frequency  of  interventions 
in the included studies, it was not possible to determine 
the  optimal  intervention  regimen.  Future  studies  should 
focus on establishing the optimal intervention regimen in 
this setting.

In  terms  of  mental  health,  all  seven  studies  included 
in  this  analysis  reported  depression-related  outcomes, 
while two of them assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms. 
Depression  is  a  risk  factor  for  cognitive  decline  and  a 
common  manifestation  of  neuropsychiatric  syndrome 
in older adults with MCI [56,  57]. In contrast with the 

significant effect recorded in our study, a recent review 
showed that dance interventions do not produce statis-
tically  significant  improvements  in  depression  among 
older  adults  with  MCI  [7].  Nevertheless,  a  series  of 
studies have confirmed the positive effects of dance on 
depressive states. This may be because dance interven-
tion  is  a  fun  music-based  physical  and  mental  activity 
that offers participants a sense of pleasure and relieves 
depression  [37].  Neurobiological  studies  have  dem-
onstrated  that  an  increase  in  parasympathetic  activ-
ity, reduction in serum cortisol levels, and suppression 
of  cardiovascular  stress  response  caused  by  musical 
stimulation  are  potential  mechanisms  contributing  to 
the  alleviation  of  depression  in  older  adults  with  MCI 
[13,  58].  Additionally,  group  settings  stimulate  social 
interaction among older individuals and contribute to a 
reduction in social isolation, loneliness, and depressed 
mood [41, 54].

Consistent  with  the  results  reported  in  a  previous 
meta-analysis [7], older adults with MCI did not experi-
ence an improvement in quality of life after receiving the 
dance intervention. Surprisingly, through subgroup anal-
ysis, we found different effects of measurement tools on 
the quality of life. This review showed a significant effect 
on quality of life when measured with SF-12, but not with 
SF-36. The  different  results  may  be  attributed  to  a  large 
difference  between  the  sample  size  measured  by  SF-12 
(n = 175)  and  that  measured  by  SF-36  (n = 91).  In  addi-
tion,  these  discrepancies  may  be  caused  by  differences 
in  the  number  of  entries  for  the  measurement  instru-
ments. Compared with the SF-36, the SF-12 is a shorter 
questionnaire, thereby imposing less burden on the study 
participants;  hence,  it  is  likely  that  the  results  are  more 
reliable  [59].  Sensitivity  analysis  revealed  that  the  effect 
of  DT  on  quality  of  life  was  statistically  significant  fol-
lowing the exclusion of one study [32]. A possible expla-
nation is that the positive control group in the excluded 

study  received  physiotherapy,  and  the  beneficial  effect 
of physiotherapy on quality of life has been confirmed in 
previous studies [60]. Thus, the dance intervention group 
did not demonstrate better quality of life than the physio-
therapy group. Moreover, the benefits of dance interven-
tions in reducing social isolation have been documented 
[54].  It  is  established  that  reduction  of  social  isolation 
and  strengthening  of  social  connections  are  essential 
for  improving  the  well-being  and  quality  of  life  of  older 
adults.  This  may  explain  the  improvement  in  quality  of 
life  induced  by  dance  interventions  in  older  adults  with 
MCI.

In addition, this systematic review yielded encouraging 
results regarding the feasibility indicators of dance inter-
ventions.  The  study  outcomes  revealed  a  high  level  of 
participant  compliance,  with  dropout  rates  consistently 
below  20%.  Among  the  six  included  studies,  no  adverse 
events were reported, indicating the safety of dance inter-
ventions. It is noteworthy that four additional studies did 

 Huang et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2023) 23:695 

Page 14 of 16

not provide descriptions of adverse event reporting, and 
the  absence  of  reporting  in  these  studies  does  not  nec-
essarily imply the absence of adverse events. These find-
ings  highlight  the  attractiveness  of  dance  interventions 
as  a  potential  cognitive  intervention  approach  and  offer 
insights  for  improving  intervention  feasibility  in  future 
research.

Limitations
This review has some limitations. Firstly, due to the small 
sample size of some of the included studies, the effective-
ness  of  dance  interventions  needs  to  be  confirmed  and 
refined  in  future  investigations  with  larger  sample  sizes. 
Secondly,  there  was  substantial  heterogeneity  in  the 
included studies (e.g., type of dance, measurement tools, 
and duration and frequency of interventions). Moreover, 
most  subgroup  analyses  failed  to  effectively  reduce  het-
erogeneity,  which  may  have  influenced  the  effect  size  of 
the pooled results. Thirdly, sufficient blinding and alloca-
tion concealment methods were not performed in some 
of the included studies; this may have impacted the valid-
ity of the results. Lastly, as the languages of the included 
studies were limited to English and Chinese, there may be 
publication bias due to incomplete inclusion.

Conclusion
This  review  provided  evidence  for  the  positive  effects 
of  DT  on  global  cognitive  function,  specific  cognitive 
subdomains  (i.e.,  memory,  executive  function,  atten-
tion,  language),  and  mental  health  (i.e.,  depression  and 
neuropsychiatric  symptoms).  DT  is  a  mind-body  activ-
ity  with  the  potential  to  stimulate  neuroplasticity,  mak-
ing  it  a  promising  complementary  treatment  for  older 
adults with MCI. However, it’s essential to exercise cau-
tion in interpreting these results due to the limited num-
ber  of  included  studies  and  the  varying  quality  of  the 
evidence.  Future  research  should  aim  to  determine  the 
optimal  intervention  regimen,  assess  the  sustainabil-
ity  of  its  effects  over  time,  and  investigate  whether  DT 
yields superior cognitive and mental health-related ben-
efits  compared  to  other  non-pharmacological  therapies. 
Additionally, to enhance the robustness of future investi-
gations, more comprehensive tracking of adverse events, 
detailed reporting of participant attendance and dropout 
rates, and a thorough examination of the factors facilitat-
ing or hindering the engagement and adherence of older 
adults with mild cognitive impairment in dance interven-
tions should be incorporated into study protocols.
