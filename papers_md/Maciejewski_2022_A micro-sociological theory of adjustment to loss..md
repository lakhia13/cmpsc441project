Abstract

Although grief is a reaction to a social loss, it has been viewed almost exclusively through the 
lens of individual psychology and not sociology. In this article, we suggest that more attention to 
sociological aspects of grief is warranted. We propose a micro-sociological theory of bereavement 
and grief to complement, not replace, psychological perspectives. We assert that bereavement 
represents a state of loss-associated social deprivations (e.g., social disconnection). Further, 
we postulate that addressing social deprivations (e.g., enhancing social connection) will lessen 
severity of distressing, disabling grief and, thereby, promote adjustment to loss. Future research 
is needed to test our theory and the hypotheses that follow from it in the service of promoting 
adaptation to bereavement.

Introduction

Although grief is a reaction to a social loss, it has been viewed almost exclusively 
through the lens of individual psychology. Indeed, much of our work in this area has 
focused on psychological symptoms in bereaved individuals rather than the social impact 
of bereavement. We have sought to differentiate grief from other forms of intrapersonal 
psychological distress, (e.g., depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress), and our research 
helped to usher the inclusion of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) as an official individual 
psychopathological disorder into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM).1,2,3 Despite these advances, we believe that more attention to sociological aspects 
of grief and bereavement is warranted. In this article, we attempt to advance a micro-
sociological perspective on adapting to interpersonal loss to complement, not replace,

psychological perspectives. We introduce micro-sociological conceptions of bereavement 
within the theory and formulate consequences of the theory.

Core tenets of a micro-sociological theory of bereavement (see Figure 1)

In our nascent formulation of this theory, we adopt a symbolic interactionist perspective4,5 
and build on social interactionist notions, i.e., social worlds,6,7 social identities,8,9 and social 
interactions in the construction of and participation in those worlds and identities. Symbolic 
Interactionism10 provides a sociological framework for understanding how individuals 
interact with one another to create symbolic worlds and how these worlds shape individual 
behaviors.11 Adaptation to loss is a process of micro-social reorganization in the context of 
loss-associated social deprivation (“micro-” here referring to individual interaction within 
small groups, in contrast to “macro-“ which would refer to larger social interactions 
across organizations). It is a process of psychosocial reconstruction, of transition from 
a disintegrated social life moored to a constellation of lost and disrupted social worlds, 
identities, and patterns of behavior to a cohesive social life committed to the renovation of 
old and construction of new relationships.

Our micro-sociological theory of bereavement includes three basic principles: First, 
bereavement results in a partial void in one’s social state (what we refer to as a mourner’s 
social space). This void in the mourner’s social space needs to be filled. The size of the 
void created by the loss -- the amount of social space the deceased filled, and the ways in 
which the deceased filled it, leads to displacement from a prior state of social equilibrium 
and wholeness. Second, part of adapting to a significant interpersonal loss is the process 
of filling this social void, of establishing a new state of social equilibrium that satisfies 
one’s social needs and desires. Third, everyone’s grief is distinct in that bereavement and 
its associated grief are related to the physical loss of a unique relationship and social 
constellation. However, while each mourner’s social space is depleted in unique ways, there 
is also a universality to the experience. It is, thus, also true that everyone’s grief is similar in 
that every bereaved individual experiences a social vacuum created by bereavement.

For a bereaved individual, the physical separation from the other that occurs after the death 
results in a severe form of social deprivation for the mourner. The mourner must confront 
the consequential reality that this significant other and relationship is forever transformed. 
From a micro-sociological perspective, the bereaved individual has lost key dimensions of 
the dyadic relationship with the deceased person, and the absence of the deceased in their 
interactions in larger (but still micro) social groups. For example, a recently widowed man 
who had a close relationship with his now deceased spouse is likely to have his micro-social 
worlds, identities, and interactions altered in a variety of ways. It leaves a void, or vacancy, 
in his social space (see Box 1). First and foremost, this widower has lost the micro-social 
world, identity, and patterns of behavior that he had created and shared with his wife. 
However, other aspects of his social existence are also forever changed. The widower has 
not only experienced change in the relationship with his deceased wife or role, but also 
must renegotiate, reformulate, and reconsider his identity and interactions with other extant 
social relationships and casual acquaintances in his broader social world. These derivative 
effects of the lost relationship may exacerbate or ameliorate the widower’s sense of social

deprivation. His sense of belonging or connectedness with others in the micro-social space 
has been disrupted, and it no longer includes caring or nurturance of others, and the various 
other social dimensions filled by his wife. The void in one’s social space created by the 
loss hence depletes a mourner’s state of social health, completeness, and fulfillment. In 
this way, we assert that bereavement, at its core, represents a state of loss-associated social 
deprivation.

Adaptation to loss involves filling the social void created by the loss. For a bereaved 
individual, the meaning and significance of their former connection to the deceased 
person exist within extant and de novo social relationships. It is important to consider 
that surviving and emerging interpersonal relationships not only provide opportunities for 
socially rewarding interactions, but also may pose dilemmas for the bereaved survivor 
as might be the case for evolving social identities. The absence of the deceased affects 
emotions, daily routine, and ability to engage in potentially satisfying activities and 
experiences. Mourners must engage in micro-social reorganization to meet their social 
needs. Our theory leads us to postulate the following: the more effectively mourners are 
able to address their social needs and fill the social space vacated by bereavement, the less 
distressing and disabling their grief, and the more they will be able to return to a state of 
social connectedness, wellbeing, and health.

Micro-sociological interpretations of grief symptoms

Our preceding sketch of a micro-sociological theory of bereavement introduces a new 
paradigm within which one may interpret grief and PGD symptoms. A comparison 
of psychological and micro-sociological perspectives of grief symptoms has useful 
implications for both the assessment of grief and targets of grief interventions.

Table 1 presents items used to assess PGD in the DSM-5-TR and grief in the PG-13-R along 
with categorizations and interpretations of these symptoms within coincident psychological 
and micro-sociological domains. Within the psychological domain, the focal event is the 
death of a close other; symptoms of grief represent aspects of the bereaved individual’s 
psychological response to that death, a process of working through and reducing these 
symptoms. Within the micro-sociological domain, the focal event is the loss of a close 
relationship and related disruptions of the mourner’s social world; signs of grief represent 
aspects of the bereaved individual’s social deprivation due to that end; grief is a process of 
micro-social reorganization on a path toward fulfillment of social needs and desires, or as we 
conceptualize it, filling the social space vacated by the deceased close other.

Recent empirical research from the perspective of the new theory

To date, much more empirical research on grief has focused on psychiatry and clinical 
psychology rather than sociology. Further, work that does include and examine social factors 
in grief is neither cast nor interpreted in micro-sociological, symbolic interactionist terms. 
Nevertheless, there are some recent studies whose findings may be viewed as consistent 
with, and potentially supportive of, the micro-sociological theory of bereavement outlined 
above.

In addition to meeting the social needs outlined in Box 1, social relationships impact grief 
adjustment via psychological pathways. They offer important roles and opportunities to 
manifest aspects of the mourner’s identity and to further their sense of purpose in life. They 
also can facilitate adaptive meaning reconstruction of narratives that bereaved individuals 
develop of the life and death of a deceased close other, which is a central feature of adaptive 
grieving processes.12,13,14,15 [cross-reference Neimeyer article] Recent empirical studies 
have found that meaning reconstruction is inversely related to PGD symptomatology,16,17 
mediates associations between socially-relevant risks for PGD (e.g., attachment style, 
grief-related social support, and relationship to the deceased) and development of PGD 
symptomatology,18 and serves as a viable foundation for a new meaning-centered grief 
therapy.19

In close peer social relationships, e.g., close friendships and spousal relationships, 
individuals interact with others in meaningful ways that help define these micro-social 
worlds and their identities within in them. Thus, within our micro-sociological theory of 
bereavement, we would expect that: (Hypothesis 1) loss of a close other creates a large 
social void (state of bereavement) and it is a sizeable task (process of micro-sociological 
reorganization) to fill it, and (Hypothesis 2) social interactions within close relationships are 
an effective means for bereaved individuals to fill social spaces created by the loss. Findings 
from recent empirical investigations are consistent with these hypotheses.

Using data from a large-scale longitudinal observational cohort study, Lui et al.20 report 
that the death of a close friend adversely affects bereaved individuals’ physical and 
psychological well-being and emotional and social functioning for up to four years. Milman 
et al.18 report that spousal, as opposed to non-spousal, bereavement is associated with 
greater PGD symptoms, consistent with prior investigations. Each of these reports is 
consistent with our first hypothesis.

In a study examining different sources of school-based social support on grief and grief-
related growth among children and adolescents bereaved by the loss of a sibling, Sharp 
et al.21, report that social support from friends is associated with grief-related growth 
regardless of age, and inversely associated with grief among adolescents. The authors 
also report that peer support moderates associations between parent support, grief and 
grief-related growth, accentuating beneficial effects of parent support, for adolescents but 
not children. In a web-based study of adolescents bereaved by the loss of a parent, Hirooka 
et al.22 report that “having fun with friends” is positively associated with posttraumatic 
growth. In a longitudinal cohort study of couples bereaved by perinatal loss, Tseng et al.23 
report that greater marital satisfaction is associated with lower intensity of grief independent 
of effects of experience of infertility, number of living children and other factors on grief. 
Each of these reports is consistent with our second hypothesis.

Concluding Remarks

In this article, we propose a micro-sociological theory of bereavement, which provides novel 
conceptualizations of adaptive tasks, interpretations of symptoms and signs of grief and 
PGD, and insights into recent empirical investigations of bereavement and grief. It may also 
guide development of interventions targeting micro-sociological reorganization to fill the

social void created by the loss of a close other and thereby promote grief resolution. Future 
research should build on prior work on social rewards24 and attachment25 and examine 
the features of individuals and relationships that may best satisfy social needs. It should 
also evaluate interventions that facilitate micro-sociological reorganization in the service of 
promoting more fuller adaptation to interpersonal loss.

Basic Concepts of a Micro-Sociological Theory of Grief

Terminology

Bereavement – a state of loss-associated social deprivation

Grief – a process involving micro-social reorganization in the context of loss-associated 
social deprivation

Social space – the area filled by others in satisfying social needs

Social Needs

Belonging and connectedness to others

Caring and nurturance of others

Safety and security evoked by others

Identity and role clarification in relation to others

Feeling understood by other

Feeling appreciated, valued, and loved by others

Appreciating, valuing, and loving others

Axiom

The more effectively mourners satisfy their social needs (i.e., fill the social spaces 
vacated by bereavement), the less distressing and disabling their grief, and the more 
likely they will be to achieve a state of social completeness and wellbeing.
