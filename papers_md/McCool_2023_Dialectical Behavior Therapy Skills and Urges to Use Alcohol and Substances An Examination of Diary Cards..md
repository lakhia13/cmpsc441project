Abstract

Skills learned in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are a proposed mechanism that prompts 
behavior change. Few studies have examined the effects of DBT skills on treatment outcomes. 
No published studies have examined the effects of DBT skills on alcohol and substance use 
outcomes. This study examined 48 individuals in a community mental health facility that delivers 
DBT-adherent treatment. Utilizing intake data and diary cards, multilevel model analyses were 
conducted to examine the effects each DBT skills domain had on urges for participants that 
entered treatment with varying frequencies of alcohol and substance use. Emotion regulation 
and mindfulness skills domains were related to decreased urges for individuals that entered 
treatment with high frequencies of alcohol and substance use. Previous-day distress tolerance 
skills were associated with decreased urges and previous-day interpersonal effectiveness skills 
were associated with decreased urges for individuals that entered treatment with high frequencies 
of substance use. DBT skills may be a helpful mechanism to decrease urges for individuals that 
use alcohol and other substances. However, more research on why certain skills domains may be 
more effective is needed.

Introduction

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) was designed for high-risk patients at risk for suicide 
or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), which may result in death by accident. Initially, it showed 
efficacy for individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD; Linehan, 1993). The 
process of doing DBT is an intensive outpatient treatment for individuals. Doing effective 
DBT requires that the therapist and patient engage in multiple components going beyond

just individual therapy. Comprehensive DBT includes group skills training, telephone 
coaching, and the therapist being part of a consultation team (Linehan & Wilks, 2015) 
in addition to individual therapy. Standard (comprehensive) DBT programs effectively target 
and reduce symptoms of emotion dysregulation and NSSI behaviors commonly associated 
with BPD (Neacsiu et al., 2014). Over time, DBT has been implemented to treat various 
disorders, including substance use disorders (SUDs; Linehan et al., 1999, Linehan et al., 
2002, Axelrod et al., 2011).

As DBT began showing efficacy with some of the highest risk patients, those with BPD, 
other researchers started to use and research DBT with different populations and found 
that DBT can be effective in treating individuals with a multitude of disorders (e.g., eating 
disorders - Linehan and Chen, 2005; Depression - Lynch et al., (2003); PTSD - Harned, 
Wilks, Schmidt, & Coyle, 2018; with adolescents - Rathus & Miller, 2014; and with high 
conflict couples - Fruzzetti, 2012). Panos and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis that 
indicated preliminary evidence to suggest the effectiveness of DBT-informed treatments for 
various mental health disorders (Panos, Jackson, Hasan, & Panos, 2014).

Interestingly, DBT focuses on treating ineffective “problem” behaviors instead of focusing 
on a specific diagnosis for treatment, which is likely why DBT is efficacious with multiple 
diagnoses. One of the components of DBT that may help its efficacy with so many different 
diagnoses is that it is philosophically built upon the dialectic of acceptance and change. That 
patients (and therapists) need to accept the situation as it is and work to either change the 
situation (through some form of behavioral change) or change how they think or feel about 
the situation (through some form of cognitive change) (Linehan, 1993, Swenson, 2016).

Researchers have begun to examine DBT adaptations in various patient populations. DeCou 
et al.’s (2019), meta-analysis found promising evidence to suggest the efficacy of DBT 
for various mental health disorders in a myriad of settings. For example, DBT-informed 
treatment effectively reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms (Lothes et al., 2014) in a 
Partial Hospital (PH) setting with a heterogeneous sample. Mochrie et al. (2020) found that 
DBT helps in depressive and anxiety symptom reduction in individuals attending PH and 
intensive outpatient programs (IOPs).

DBT adherence can be successful in other therapeutic modalities (Swenson, 2016), with the 
key features being that the modes and functions of DBT are met. DBT adherent programs 
should include: DBT skills training, individual DBT psychotherapy, in-the-moment skills 
coaching, case management, and weekly DBT therapist treatment team meetings. Through 
these five modes of DBT, the program aims to improve patient motivation, generalize skills 
to patient’s behaviors, structure the environment, and enhance therapist capabilities and 
support motivation.

DBT in Partial Hospital and Intensive Outpatient Settings

In terms of PH programs, there is some preliminary evidence that DBT can be an effective 
treatment when utilized in this setting, specifically for individuals with BPD (Lenz & Del 
Conte, 2018). Moreover, Lothes et al. (2014) found that implementing DBT in a PH setting 
reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and suffering.

PH programs are often seen as a bridge between traditional (weekly) outpatient therapy 
and inpatient stays and are usually short, with many patients needing further treatment after 
discharge. Lothes et al. (2016) examined various symptoms in relation to treatment duration 
among 113 adults with mixed-diagnosis and found they spent an average of 23 days in the 
program. Lothes et al. (2021) found that the average length of stay was 26.68 (27 days) in 
data over five years of patients attending a PH program.

Findings from Lothes and colleagues (2016) showed that patients with a higher level of 
symptom acuity at intake, in combination with those who were able to attend the program 
for a longer duration, achieved more significant reductions in various clinical symptoms 
(e.g., depression, anxiety, hopelessness) from intake to discharge. Mochrie and colleagues 
(2020) found that individuals who opted to attend PH and IOP as stand-alone care had 
shorter treatment duration than those who started in a PH program and stepped down to IOP. 
Patients drove their care decisions based on symptom reduction and through a dialogue with 
their providers (therapist and/or prescriber) throughout treatment. These findings suggest 
that DBT can be effectively adapted for different treatment settings such as IOP and PH 
programs. However, there remains a lack of research in this area, particularly among patients 
with SUDs.

DBT for Individuals with a SUD

Foundational research on DBT for individuals with a SUD centers on randomized controlled 
trials (Linehan et al., 2002; Linehan et al., 1999). In these trials, DBT was more effective 
than treatment as usual for individuals with co-occurring BPD and SUD (Linehan et al., 
1999). Additionally, compared to other treatment modalities, DBT is more efficacious for 
individuals with opioid use disorder (Linehan, 2002). There is also literature supporting the 
use of DBT within intensive outpatient programs to treat SUDs. Specifically, DBT appears 
to treat symptoms of emotion dysregulation that affect substance use behaviors (Axelrod 
et al., 2011; Maffei et al., 2018). However, few studies examined the effects of DBT on 
individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).

Cavicchioli et al. (2019) found that stand-alone DBT skills training is associated with 
decreases in substance use behaviors, increases in emotion regulation, and increases in 
coping strategies for individuals in treatment for AUD and other co-occurring SUDs. 
Additional studies by Cavicchioli and colleagues (2020a; 2020b) continue to provide 
evidence for using stand-alone DBT skills training in treating individuals with AUD. While 
these studies utilized a global measure of DBT skills use, there are limited studies to date 
that examine the use of DBT skills in patients’ daily lives in relation to substance use urges 
and behaviors.

Mechanisms of Behavior Change in DBT

A mechanism of behavior change is behavior that a patient utilizes to promote later 
change in treatment goals (Magill et al., 2015). Lynch and colleagues (2006) proposed 
that DBT has unique mechanisms of behavior change. Amongst these mechanisms are the 
skills domains utilized in DBT skills training. These domains include emotion regulation, 
distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness skills. The unique skills

that Linehan (1993) identified targeted areas of skill deficits among individuals with BPD. 
As the biosocial theory postulates, individuals with BPD may utilize behaviors (NSSI, 
suicidal behavior, substance use, etc.) to decrease the intensity of unwanted emotional states 
(Linehan, 1993). Thus, DBT aims to teach individuals additional coping skills that can 
replace ineffective problem behaviors to regulate their emotions.

While the skills learned in DBT are proposed mechanisms of behavior change, few studies 
have examined their effects as mediators to date. Neacsiu et al. (2010) found that increased 
DBT skills use mediated the relationship between time in treatment and suicide attempts, 
control of anger, and NSSI. Additionally, increases in DBT skills use are associated with 
decreased substance use behaviors for individuals in treatment for AUD (Cavicchioli et al., 
2019). While these studies are critical in providing evidence that skills use changes behavior, 
they do not offer insight into DBT skills use at shorter time intervals.

Stepp and colleagues (2008) examined DBT daily diary cards and found that increased DBT 
skills use was associated with decreased BPD symptom severity. Additionally, Probst et al. 
(2018) examined DBT diary cards and found that on days individuals successfully utilized 
DBT skills, their suicidal ideation tended to be lower. The research focused on DBT skills 
use daily, and weekly intervals primarily focused on BPD symptoms (suicidal ideation, 
NSSI). To date, no studies have utilized DBT diary cards to examine the effects of DBT 
skills on urges to use alcohol and other substances.

Thus, the current study examined the weekly use of DBT skills on urges amongst individuals 
in a community mental health program with varying frequencies of self-reported alcohol 
and substance use. Utilizing the skills deficit model framework in DBT, each unique skills 
domain could significantly predict decreases in urges. For example, one purpose of distress 
tolerance (DT) skills is to survive crises without making things worse. Emotion regulation 
(ER) skills aim to reduce unwanted emotions linked to drinking behaviors and increase 
positive emotions (Koerner, 2012). Mindfulness skills may help individuals learn to notice 
urges and implement other strategies, and interpersonal effectiveness (IE) skills may help 
patients engage in effective drink/drug refusal skills. Therefore, we hypothesized that each 
skills domain would have a negative relationship for urges and that this relationship would 
be most substantial for individuals who entered treatment with a high frequency of alcohol 
or substance use. Additionally, to support a more causal relationship through temporal 
precedence (Cole & Maxwell, 2003), we also examined the effects of previous-day DBT 
skills domains on urges to use. In all, we examined eight total models; one for each skills 
domain on the same day and one for each skills domain on the previous-day.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Participants included 48 individuals from a community clinic’s DBT PH program in the 
southeastern United States. The sample was predominately white (N = 42; Black N = 3; 
Puerto Rican N = 1, Asian N = 1, Biracial N =1) females (N= 38), that worked blue collar 
jobs (N = 20). Participants primary and secondary diagnosis (if present) mostly consisted 
of major depressive disorder (N = 31 and N = 5, respectively). Approximately 18% of the

sample was formally diagnosed with AUD, and 17% were officially diagnosed with a SUD 
at intake into treatment. For a breakdown of demographic characteristics, including primary 
and secondary diagnoses, please see Table 1.

Materials

Baseline Alcohol and Substance Use—To decrease patient and clinician burden of 
the research paperwork at the community clinic, alcohol frequency was coded from the 
initial patient intake into the treatment. Research assistants coded alcohol use on a 0 to 7 
scale (0- no lifetime use, 1- use in lifetime, 2- one to two times every three months, 3- once 
per month, 4- once every two weeks, 5- once per week, 6- two to four times per week, 
7- almost every day). Overall, six participants endorsed drinking nearly every day during 
intake.

Baseline substance use was calculated in the same manner as baseline alcohol use. During 
intake, participants answered questions related to their frequency of cannabis, cocaine, 
opioid, and amphetamine use on a 0 to 7 scale (0- no lifetime use, 1- use in lifetime, 2- 
one to two times every three months, 3- once per month, 4- once every two weeks, 5- once 
per week, 6- two to four times per week, 7- almost every day). The four substance use 
items were averaged to create a mean frequency of substance use at intake into the clinic. 
Participants also answered questions measuring the DSM-5 substance use disorder criteria in 
the initial intake. Two participants met the criteria for a moderate substance use disorder, and 
eight met the criteria for a severe substance use disorder.

DBT Diary Cards.—Participants completed their DBT diary cards at the beginning of the 
group each weekday. During this time, they filled out their diary cards for the following 
day. For example, on Tuesday, they would fill out their diary card for Monday, and on 
Monday, they would fill in their diary card for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. On one side 
of their DBT diary card, they circled whether or not they used a specific skill on each day 
of the week. The diary card included seven skills in the mindfulness domain, seven skills 
in interpersonal effectiveness, eight skills in emotion regulation, and nine skills in distress 
tolerance. Participants reported their urges to use on the opposite side of the diary card 
(0-10). The total number of skills under each domain was summed to create the number of 
skills participants used under each domain per day. For descriptive statistics of daily DBT 
skills and baseline alcohol and substance use, please see Table 2.

Program Description—Participants met 4 hours per day, five days per week, in a DBT 
skills training constructed based on Linehan’s (2015) DBT training manual. The skills 
group included teaching the four core DBT skills domains, a check-in where participants 
discussed their use of skills, and challenges to implementing skills in their day-to-day lives. 
Participants also met with an individual DBT therapist weekly and had access to a 24-hour 
coaching phone. Additionally, therapists all belonged to a weekly DBT consultation team 
that monitored adherence to DBT. Lastly, all participants met weekly with a nurse and once 
weekly with a prescriber to manage medications while in the PH program. More detail on 
the PH program and qualifications for admission can be read in previous papers (Lothes et 
al., 2021; Mochrie et al., 2020; Mochrie et al., 2019). Some individuals transferred to the

Procedure

IOP program, which was primarily distinguished by the amount of time individuals spent 
in the DBT skills training group (9-hours per week in IOP versus 20-hours per week in 
PHP). The IOP program included three 3-hour DBT skills groups per week, access to a DBT 
individual therapist, an on-site prescriber, and a DBT coaching phone. Individuals in the 
PHP and IOP program were asked to consider abstinence sampling during their treatment. 
However, receiving treatment was not contingent on maintaining abstinence from alcohol or 
other substances.

The study was approved by the IRB at a local university. Informed consent was gained from 
every participant during their intake into the clinic. Following their initial intake interview, 
participants were placed into the PH program and completed their treatment, filling out 
their diary cards every day they were present during treatment. Out of a possible 3,344 
days, participants completed 2392 urges to use items, indicating a 71.53% completion rate. 
A previous study examining intake and discharge data over five years revealed an average 
stay of approximately 26 days (Lothes II et al., 2021). For some participants, insurance 
companies may approve additional days beyond the average 26. Therefore, we entered 
length of stay as a covariate into all models to control for length of stay and potential move 
to the intensive outpatient program.

Data Analysis

Because the data violated the assumption of independence in ordinary least squared 
regressions (i.e., the data was nested within participants across days), we analyzed our 
data using multilevel modeling procedures (Raudenbush et al., 1995; Raudenbush & Bryk, 
2002). To reduce the impact of person-level differences on level-1 parameter estimates, the 
daily skills variables (level-1 predictors) and preceding days’ urge to use (level-1 covariate) 
were all person-centered (Nezlek, 2011). Additionally, alcohol use frequency and substance 
use frequency at treatment entry (level-2 variables) and length of stay (level-2 covariate) 
were grand mean-centered (Nezlek, 2011). Lastly, we probed cross-level interactions in 
each model where a skills domain achieved a significant result. In the case of a significant 
interaction effect, we probed the interaction to determine the effects of DBT skills domains 
on urges for those at varying frequencies of alcohol and substance use at intake.

We modeled each of the four skill domains separately. Additionally, we modeled each 
skill domain in two separate models: the previous-day and the same-day skill domain. For 
example, we modeled ER skills in the following ways. We entered same-day regulation 
skills (level-1 predictor), baseline alcohol use frequency (level-2 predictor), baseline 
substance use frequency (level-2 predictor), length of stay (level-2 covariate), an interaction 
between same-day ER skills and baseline alcohol use frequency, and an interaction term 
between same-day ER skills and baseline substance use frequency into one model. For the 
second model, we entered previous-day ER skills (level-1 predictor), previous-day urges 
(level-1 covariate), baseline alcohol use frequency (level-2 predictor), baseline substance 
use frequency (level-2 predictor), length of stay (level-2 covariate), an interaction term 
between previous-day ER skills and baseline alcohol use, and an interaction term between

previous-day ER skills and baseline substance use frequency into one model. This process 
was repeated for each skill domain, resulting in eight models.

We utilized the lme4 (Bates et al., 2014) package in R to conduct our primary analyses and 
the interactions (Long, 2019) package in R to probe the interactions and calculate simple 
slopes. In the case of a significant interaction, simple slopes were calculated at plus 1 SD 
and minus 1SD for baseline alcohol and substance use frequencies. The data and code are 
openly shared at: https://osf.io/48n2s/?view_only=4370989543a94d9a9cd00f75f16b8628.

Results

ER skills

Length of stay, baseline substance use frequency, and baseline alcohol use frequency did not 
significantly predict urges in any of the eight models. Therefore, to simplify the presentation 
of the eight models, we present estimates, confidence intervals, t values, and p values of each 
skill domain in Table 3 and the estimates, confidence intervals, t values, and p values of the 
interaction terms in Table 4. We present the simple slope analyses’ estimates, t, and p values 
in the text below.

Same-day ER skills use significantly predicted decreases in urges. The interaction between 
same-day ER skills and baseline alcohol use frequency also achieved significance. We 
probed the simple slopes (Figure 1) and the results indicated a significant decrease in urges 
for those that entered treatment with higher alcohol use frequency (β = −0.229, t = −4.680, p 
< 0.001). For those that entered treatment with lower alcohol use frequency, the relationship 
between ER skills and urges did not achieve significance.

In the model of previous-day ER skills on urges, previous-day ER skills and previous-day 
urges significantly predicted urges. Additionally, the interaction between previous-day ER 
skills and baseline substance use frequency achieved significance. The simple slopes for the 
interaction (Figure 2) indicated a significant slope for those at −1SD of baseline substance 
use (β = −0.209, t = −4.499, p < 0.001) and no significant slope for those that entered 
treatment reporting no substance use.

Mindfulness skills

The same-day mindfulness skills model results indicated a significant main effect of 
mindfulness skills and significant interaction effects between mindfulness skills and baseline 
alcohol and substance use frequency. First, we conducted a simple slopes analysis for the 
interaction between mindfulness skills and baseline alcohol use (Figure 3). Individuals that 
entered treatment at higher alcohol use frequencies tended to experience decreases in urges 
on days they used more mindfulness skills (β = −0.269, t = −4.242, p < 0.001). Individuals 
that entered treatment with lower reported alcohol use frequency did not experience a 
decrease in urges relative to their mindfulness skill use. Next, we probed the interaction 
between same-day mindfulness skills and baseline substance use frequency (Figure 4). The 
results indicated that individuals who entered treatment at higher substance use frequencies 
tended to experience decreased urges when they used more mindfulness skills (β = −0.284, t

IE skills

= −4.247, p < 0.001). The simple slopes for those at low substance frequency did not achieve 
significance.

For the model assessing previous-day mindfulness skills, previous-day mindfulness skills 
were significantly associated with decreased urges. Previous-day urges were positively 
associated with urges. We observed no significant interaction effects between previous-day 
mindfulness skills and baseline alcohol or substance use.

In the model examining same-day DT skills, no predictor achieved significance. In the 
model examining previous-day DT skills, previous-day DT skills significantly predicted a 
decrease in urges. Previous-day urges again predicted an increase in urges. No interaction 
effects reached significance.

In the model examining same-day IE skills, no predictors achieved significance. In the 
model examining previous-day IE skills, IE skills significantly predicted a decrease in urges. 
Again, previous-day urges also predicted an increase in urges. The interaction between 
previous-day IE skills and baseline substance use frequency achieved significance. When 
probing the simple slopes (Figure 5), individuals who entered treatment at higher substance 
use frequencies tended to experience decreases in their urges on days after they reported 
using more IE skills (β = −0.206, t = −3.625, p < 0.001). There was no association between 
the previous-day’s IE skills and urges for individuals that entered treatment at low substance 
use frequencies.

Discussion

Overall, the study predictions achieved mixed results. Each skill domain significantly 
predicted decreases in urges in some fashion. Mindfulness skills appeared to be the most 
impactful across time and alcohol and substance use frequency. Specifically, same-day 
and previous-day mindfulness skills were associated with significant decreases in urges. 
Additionally, same-day mindfulness skills interacted with baseline alcohol and substance 
use frequencies. Those who entered treatment reported a high frequency of substance or 
alcohol use tended to experience the sharpest decrease in urges as they increased their use 
of mindfulness skills. Mindfulness skills are taught in many different treatment modalities, 
including DBT (Irving et al., 2009; Linehan, 1993; Sipe & Eisendrath, 2012; Witkiewitz & 
Bowen, 2010). However, the present study is the first to examine the relationship between 
DBT mindfulness skills and urges in daily life via DBT diary cards. With mindfulness skills 
impacting urges across time, it may be beneficial for those skills to be taught early in DBT 
treatment programs focusing on substance and alcohol use.

Additionally, same and previous-day ER skills were associated with decreased urges. Same-
day ER skills appeared to be most effective for those that drank more frequently, and 
previous-day ER skills appeared to be most effective for those that used other substances 
more regularly. These skills may be practical for urges as some hypothesize urges to 
be an emotional state (Franken, 2003). The ER skills domain aims to help patients

reduce unwanted emotions and understand and regulate the emotions they are experiencing 
(Koerner, 2012). Alcohol and substance use may be a behavior that aims to regulate 
emotions (Sher & Grekin, 2007), and replacing drinking with ER skills could be a potential 
mechanism that decreases urges.

For DT skills, only previous-day DT skills achieved significance. The DT skills aim to 
help patients in DBT tolerate crises without worsening the problems (Linehan, 2014). For 
individuals who use alcohol and drugs frequently, urges could be considered a crisis if the 
urges increase the likelihood of a lapse or other problematic behaviors. Same-day DT skills 
may not have reached significance as the temporality of the skills used and urges could be 
too spread out via a daily diary. Individuals may have been more likely to use DT skills 
when their urges were high. Thus it would appear in a daily diary study that DT skills 
do not affect same-day urges. Further studies utilizing ecological momentary assessment 
methodologies could further explore how DT skills affect urges in real-time.

Lastly, previous-day IE skills were associated with decreased urges. This association was 
most robust for individuals that entered treatment reporting high frequencies of substance 
use. IE skills could potentially affect urges in a variety of manners. First, they could directly 
impact urges via substance/drink refusal. Additionally, IE skills can be used to achieve 
meaningful relationships and interactions that thus maintain a regulated emotional state. 
More studies examining the mechanisms of individual IE skills are needed.

First, our study included a small number of participants from one DBT program in the 
southeastern United States. Furthermore, the PH program was not limited to those with an 
AUD or SUD. Therefore, the generalizability of our models is likely limited. Additionally, 
this study followed only 48 participants during their community clinic stay. This small 
number of individuals limits the power of the level-2 predictors and interactions. Also, the 
DBT diary cards only allow for a skill to be circled once daily, even if a participant may 
have used those skills multiple times during the day. This limits the accurate measure of 
the number of DBT skills used during a day. It could be that participants were utilizing the 
same DBT skill multiple times in one day and that the repetition of the skill helped account 
for a change in urges. Another limitation is the measure of urges on the diary card. Urges 
were measured as a single item that could account for substance use and alcohol urges. 
Additionally, the single-item measure of urges limits the measure’s reliability, and future 
studies would do well to examine multiple-item measures of the urge domain.

Limitations

Future Directions

Much research is needed to examine the effects of core DBT skills on urges and substance 
use as individuals could be using skills to prevent urges, reduce urges, or reduce actual 
alcohol and substance use Studies utilizing ecological momentary assessments could better 
understand the moment-to-moment relationship between DBT skills, urges to drink or use, 
and alcohol and substance consumption. It could be that certain skills may be more effective 
in reducing the link between urges and actual use and intensive longitudinal studies may 
help tease apart these complex relationships. The skills learned in DBT are theorized to

be a mechanism of behavior change unique to those in DBT treatment (Lynch et al., 
2006). Additional studies examining the growth rate of skills use over time and how that 
growth rate predicts behaviors related to alcohol and substance use could help spur unique 
implementations of DBT to those with an AUD and SUD. Future studies are needed to 
examine the proposed mechanisms of each skill as well. The paced breathing skill in DBT 
posits that breathing in for eight seconds and out for four seconds will slow the heart rate 
down and decrease the experience of distress. The opposite action emotion regulation skill 
aims to regulate specific emotions by engaging in behaviors opposite of the action urge 
related to the unwanted emotion (Linehan, 2014).

Studies examining each individual skills are warranted to better understand these 
proposed mechanisms and potentially develop more streamlined therapies. Additionally, 
understanding the proposed mechanisms may inform just-in-time interventions that could 
increase skills generalization outside of the traditional therapeutic context. Lastly, our study 
did not capture the potential of other DBT treatment ingredients and treatment timing to 
affect changes on urges. Further studies examining how phone coaching and the order in 
which the skills are taught could help better understand how individuals change substance 
use behaviors while receiving DBT treatment.

The current study was the first to examine the relationship between DBT skills domains 
and urges over time amongst individuals who entered treatment with varying frequencies of 
alcohol use. Within this small sample, the increased use of ER, DT, IE, and mindfulness 
skills were associated with decreased urges. This paper extended the skills deficit theory 
of DBT (Linehan, 1993). When individuals in DBT begin to use skills instead of other 
problematic coping mechanisms, there should be a behavior change. The present study 
found that specific skills domains may be more related to decreased urges depending 
on alcohol or other substance use frequencies. Future research is warranted to examine 
why these domains may be more closely related to decreased urges for certain groups of 
individuals.
