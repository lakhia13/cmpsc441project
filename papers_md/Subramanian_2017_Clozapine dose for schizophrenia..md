Background

A B S T R A C T

Schizophrenia and related disorders such as schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorder are serious mental illnesses characterised by
profound disruptions in thinking and speech, emotional processes, behaviour and sense of self. Clozapine is useful in the treatment of
schizophrenia and related disorders, particularly when other antipsychotic medications have failed. It improves positive symptoms (such
as delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms (such as withdrawal and poverty of speech). However, it is unclear what dose of
clozapine is most effective with the least side effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of clozapine at different doses and to identify the optimal dose of clozapine in the treatment of
schizophrenia, schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (August 2011 and 8 December 2016).

Selection criteria

All  relevant  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  irrespective  of  blinding  status  or  language,  that  compared  the  effects  of  clozapine  at
different doses in people with schizophrenia and related disorders, diagnosed by any criteria.

Data collection and analysis

We independently inspected citations from the searches, identified relevant abstracts, obtained full articles of relevant abstracts, and
classified trials as included or excluded. We included trials that met our inclusion criteria and reported useable data. For dichotomous
data, we calculated the relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects
model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias for
included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.

Main results

We identified five studies that could be included. Each compared the effects of clozapine at very low dose (up to 149 mg/day), low dose (150
mg/day to 300 mg/day) and standard dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day). Four of the five included studies were based on a small number
of participants. We rated all the evidence reported for the main outcomes of interest as low or very low quality. No data were available for
the main outcomes of global state, service use or quality of life.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We found no evidence of effect on mental state between low and very low doses of clozapine in terms of average Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale-Anchored (BPRS-A) endpoint score (1 RCT, n = 31, MD 3.55, 95% CI −4.50 to 11.60, very low quality evidence). One study found no
difference between groups in body mass index (BMI) in the short term (1 RCT, n = 59, MD −0.10, 95% CI −0.95 to 0.75, low-quality evidence).

Very low dose compared to standard dose

We found no evidence of effect on mental state between very low doses and standard doses of clozapine in terms of average BPRS-A
endpoint score (1 RCT, n = 31, MD 6.67, 95% CI −2.09 to 15.43, very low quality evidence). One study found no difference between groups
in BMI in the short term (1 RCT, n = 58, MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.76 to 0.96, low-quality evidence)

Low dose compared to standard dose

We found no evidence of effect on mental state between low doses and standard doses of clozapine in terms of both clinician-assessed
clinical improvement (2 RCTs, n = 141, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.61, medium-quality evidence) and clinically important response as more
than 30% change in BPRS score (1 RCT, n = 176, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10, medium-quality evidence). One study found no difference
between groups in BMI in the short term (1 RCT, n = 57, MD 0.20, 95% CI −0.84 to 1.24, low-quality evidence).

We found some evidence of effect for other adverse effect outcomes; however, the data were again limited.

Very low dose compared to low dose

There was limited evidence that serum triglycerides were lower at low-dose clozapine compared to very low dose in the short term (1 RCT,
n = 59, MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.49).

Low dose compared to standard dose

Weight gain was lower at very low dose compared to standard dose (1 RCT, n = 27, MD −2.70, 95% CI −5.38 to −0.02). Glucose level one hour
after meal was also lower at very lose dose (1 RCT, n = 58, MD −1.60, 95% CI −2.90 to −0.30). Total cholesterol levels were higher at very low
compared to standard dose (1 RCT, n = 58, n = 58, MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.80).

Low dose compared to standard dose

There was evidence of fewer adverse effects, measured as lower TESS scores, in the low-dose group in the short term (2 RCTs, n = 266,
MD  −3.99,  95%  CI  −5.75  to  −2.24);  and  in  one  study  there  was  evidence  that  the  incidence  of  lethargy  (RR  0.77,  95%  CI  0.60  to  0.97),
hypersalivation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.84), dizziness (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.81) and tachycardia (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.71) was
less at low dose compared to standard dose.

Authors' conclusions

We found no evidence of effect on mental state between standard, low and very low dose regimes, but we did not identify any trials on high
or very high doses of clozapine. BMI measurements were similar between groups in the short term, although weight gain was less at very
low dose compared to standard dose in one study. There was limited evidence that the incidence of some adverse effects was greater at
standard dose compared to lower dose regimes. We found very little useful data and the evidence available is generally of low or very low
quality. More studies are needed to validate our findings and report on outcomes such as relapse, remission, social functioning, service
utilisation, cost-effectiveness, satisfaction with care, and quality of life. There is a particular lack of medium- or long-term outcome data,
and on dose regimes above the standard rate.

Clozapine dose in schizophrenia

Background: Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects thinking and perception. People with schizophrenia often experience
profound  disruptions  in  their  speech,  emotional  processes,  behaviour  and  sense  of  self.  Antipsychotic  medication  can  be  a  helpful
treatment for schizophrenia; however, taking antipsychotic medication can have unpleasant effects. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug
that can be useful in treating schizophrenia, particularly when other antipsychotic medications have not worked. It is unclear, however,
what dose of clozapine is most effective with the least side effects. This review investigates the effects of receiving clozapine at four different
dose levels (high dose, standard dose, low dose, very low dose).

Searching: An electronic search for studies that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive different doses of clozapine was run in
August 2011 and again on 8 December 2016.

Results: We found five studies with 452 participants which met our inclusion criteria. Each compared the effects of clozapine at very low
dose (up to 149 mg/day), low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day) and standard dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day). None of the studies
examined the effects of clozapine at higher than the standard dose. There was nothing to choose between standard, low and very low
doses in terms of body mass index (BMI) measurements in the short term. However, weight gain was greater in those receiving the standard

dose compared to those receiving the low dose. The incidence of unpleasant side effects (which included feeling lethargic, producing too
much saliva, and feeling dizzy) was less at low dose compared to standard dose.

Quality of evidence: For main outcomes the quality was low or very low.

Conclusions: We found no evidence that might indicate the best dose of clozapine for patients with schizophrenia. Careful consideration
has to be given to balancing the advantages and disadvantages of different doses in relation to weight gain and other side effects. Overall
measurements of BMI were similar between groups; however, some side effects appear to be lower at lower doses. Overall, this review
highlights the lack of evidence-based information available for addressing the question of what dose of clozapine is most effective with
the least side effects. There is a need for large, well-designed and well-reported randomised clinical trials to address this question. There
is a particular need for such trials to look at longer-term outcomes, and to examine the effects of clozapine when given at greater than
the standard dose.

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% CI) is based on the as-
sumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: Confidence interval

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.

1 Risk of bias: rated as 'serious' (downgraded by 1) due to attrition bias, reporting bias, and sponsorship by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.
2 Indirectness: rated 'serious' (downgraded by 1) as proxy measure of pre-defined outcome
3 Imprecision: rated 'serious' (downgraded by 1) as only one study providing data, small number of participants (less than 200)

B A C K G R O U N D

is  a  serious  mental 

Schizophrenia 
illness  characterised  by
profound disruptions in thinking and speech, emotional processes,
behaviour  and  sense  of  self  (WHO  2013).  It  can  have  great
impact in terms of both human suffering and societal expenditure
(van  Os  2009).  It  is  among  the  world's  top  ten  causes  of  long-
term  disability,  leading  to  problems  in  social  and  occupational
functioning  and  self-care  (Meuser  2004).  Before  the  introduction
of  clozapine,  doctors  largely  relied  on  first  generation  (typical)
antipsychotics,  such  as  chlorpromazine,  to  control  persisting
symptoms  and  to  prevent  further  exacerbations  or  relapse  of
illness  (Kane  1990).  Clozapine  is  the  first  second  generation
(atypical)  antipsychotic  drug  introduced  to  the  market.  Arnt
suggested  that  second  generation  antipsychotics  are  those  that
do  not  cause  movement  disorders  (catalepsy)  in  rats  at  clinically
effective  doses  (Arnt  1998).  When  clozapine  was  introduced  it
proved  to  be  superior  in  controlling  treatment-resistant  illness,
with  fewer  extrapyramidal  side  effects  (EPSEs)  than  typical
antipsychotics  such  as  chlorpromazine  (Kane  1988).  However,
clozapine  was  largely  withdrawn  from  use  in  1975  following  the
death of some patients due to the development of agranulocytosis.
This  withdrawal,  however,  was  not  followed  worldwide.  For
example,  Scandinavia,  Germany  and  China  continued  to  use
clozapine. Subsequent studies demonstrated that clozapine could
be administered safely when patients are carefully monitored for
side  effects  such  as  agranulocytosis  (Kane  1988;  Naheed  2001).
Following this, clozapine was reintroduced in the USA in 1990 with
hopes  that  it  would  improve  quality  of  life,  cognitive  functioning
and  movement  disorders,  and  also  reduce  negative  symptoms
such  as  poverty  of  speech,  blunting  of  affect,  lack  of  volition
and  social  withdrawal  in  the  management  of  treatment-resistant
schizophrenia.  During  this  reintroduction,  some  safeguards  were
put  in  place;  for  example,  clozapine  is  recommended  to  be
used only in treatment-resistant schizophrenia along with regular
monitoring for side effects such as agranulocytosis.

Description of the condition

1. Schizophrenia

WHO 2013 estimates that about 24 million people worldwide are
affected by schizophrenia. The symptoms typically emerge in late
adolescence  or  early  adulthood.  It  is  unclear  as  to  what  exactly
causes schizophrenia, but both genetic and environmental factors
are  thought  to  play  a  role.  WHO  2013  identified  a  low  incidence
of  3  per  100,000,  whereas  McGrath  2008  identified  the  median
incidence of schizophrenia as 15.2 per 100,000 people. Saha 2005
found no significant difference in prevalence between urban, rural,
and  mixed  sites.  The  prevalence  of  schizophrenia  in  migrants  is
higher compared to native-born individuals and is lower in poorer
countries than in richer countries. Saha 2005 identified the median
point prevalence of schizophrenia (the proportion of people who
suffer from schizophrenia at a specific point in time) as 4.6 per 1000;
the median lifetime prevalence for persons (the number of people
in the population who have ever manifested the disease) was 4.0
per 1000; and the lifetime morbid risk (the likelihood of a particular
individual  developing  schizophrenia  in  their  lifetime)  as  7.2  per
1000.  Acute  schizophrenia  predominantly  manifests  itself  with
positive  symptoms  such  as  abnormal  experiences;  these  include
abnormal perceptions in the absence of a stimulus (hallucinations),
false  fixed  beliefs  (delusions),  and  disordered  thinking.  Chronic
schizophrenia  typically  manifests  itself  with  negative  symptoms.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Though there is no complete agreement as to the specification of
negative symptoms, it is generally agreed that they include poverty
of speech, blunting of affect, lack of volition and social withdrawal
(Gelder  2001).  More  than  50%  of  people  with  schizophrenia  are
not  receiving  appropriate  care  and  about  90%  of  people  with
untreated schizophrenia live in developing countries (WHO 2013).
Most cases of schizophrenia can be treated and those affected can
lead a productive life and be integrated in society. The incidence of
treatment resistance in schizophrenia is about 20% (Kerwin 2005).
Clozapine  reduces  psychotic  symptoms  in  30%  to  60%  of  such
schizophrenia  patients  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  adequate
trials of other antipsychotics (Buchanan 1995).

2. Schizophreniform disorder

According  to  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition, schizophreniform disorder is a condition
with  symptoms  similar  to  schizophrenia  but  lasting  less  than
six  months  (DSM-IV).  In  1937  and  1939,  follow-up  studies  were
undertaken  on  patients  who  initially  presented  with  symptoms
similar  to  schizophrenia.  Two  different  outcomes  were  identified
in  those  patients.  One  group,  whose  symptoms  were  typical
of  schizophrenia,  were  identified  as  having  a  poor  prognosis.
The  other  group,  whose  symptoms  were  similar  to  those  of
schizophrenia  but  who  had  prominent  affective  symptoms,
had  a  better  outcome;  Langfeldt  introduced  the  concept  of
schizophreniform  psychoses  to  describe  this  latter  group  (Noreik
1967;  Guldberg  1991).  Langfeldt’s  original  schizophreniform
cases  were  reviewed  by  other  researchers  using  DSM-III  and
International  Statistical  Classification  of  Diseases  and  Related
Health  Problems,  Ninth  Revision  (ICD-9)  criteria.  They  concluded
that  most  of  the  original  schizophreniform  cases  described  by
Langfeldt  possibly  appeared  to  more  closely  resemble  affective
disorders  with  psychoses,  rather  than  schizophrenia-like  illness
(Bergem  1990;  Guldberg  1991).  DSM-IV  uses  schizophreniform
disorder  to  define  a  disorder  that  would  otherwise  meet  the
diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia but lasts less than six months
(Gelder 2001). There are currently no reliable data on prevalence
rates  of  schizophreniform  disorder  (Kaplan  2005).  Treatment  is
similar  to  that  of  schizophrenia.  Good  prognostic  factors  for
schizophreniform illness include episodic illness, recurrent course
and a family history of mood disorders (Benazzi 2003).

3. Schizoaffective disorder

In  1933  Jacob  Kasanin  coined  the  term  schizoaffective  psychosis
(Kasanin  1933).  Schizoaffective  psychosis  can  be  considered  as  a
syndrome  on  the  continuum  between  schizophrenia  and  mood
disorders (such as depression and bipolar affective disorder) and
presents  with  symptoms  of  both  these  illnesses  (Danileviciūte
2002).  ICD-10  considers  schizoaffective  disorder  as  an  episodic
disorder  in  which  both  affective  and  schizophrenic  symptoms
are  prominent  but  which  does  not  justify  a  diagnosis  of  either
schizophrenia  or  a  depressive  or  manic  episode.  Studies  on
schizoaffective  disorder  suggest  that  it  is  relatively  common
in  clinical  settings.  Among  admissions  to 
inpatient  mental
health  facilities  for  functional  psychosis,  10%  to  30%  comprise
schizoaffective disorder. The lifetime prevalence of schizoaffective
disorder is estimated to be between 0.5% and 0.8% and the illness
typically presents with an episodic course (Azorin 2005). Psychotic
features may include both positive and negative symptoms along
with  affective  symptoms.  Outcome  is  predicted  by  premorbid
functioning,  number  of  past  episodes,  persistence  of  psychotic

features and degree of cognitive impairment. Vieta 2010 suggests
that  bipolar-type  schizoaffective  illness  can  be  treated  with
second  generation  antipsychotics,  either  alone  or  in  conjunction
with  a  mood  stabiliser.  The  depressive  type  of  schizoaffective
disorder  can  be  treated  with  a  second  generation  antipsychotic
in conjunction with either an antidepressant or a mood stabiliser.
Electroconvulsive  therapy  (ECT)  can  be  considered  in  refractory
cases. Prognosis appears to be better than for schizophrenia, but
worse than for affective disorder (Azorin 2005).

Description of the intervention

Prescribing  of  clozapine  requires  a  number  of  preparatory  steps.
For  example,  before  initiation  of  clozapine  a  base  line  physical
examination should be performed with an ECG and base line blood
tests, including full blood count. Patients must be registered with
the  clozapine  patient  monitoring  services,  and  full  blood  count
must be monitored once a week for the first 18 weeks, thereafter
fortnightly  for  34  weeks  and  then  once  in  every  four  weeks  for
the period of time clozapine is taken. For adults over 16 years of
age, clozapine should be started at a very low dose, e.g. 12.5 mg
once or twice a day. On the second day, 25 mg to 50 mg is given,
and, if well tolerated, the dose can be gradually increased in steps
of  25  mg  to  50  mg  daily  over  14  to  21  days  up  to  300  mg  daily
in divided doses. If necessary, the dose can be increased further.
Elderly  people  may  need  slower  titration.  During  initiation  and
titration, pulse and blood pressure (in standing and lying position)
should  be  monitored  regularly  to  identify  persistent  tachycardia
and  postural  hypotension.  If  clozapine,  for  whatever  reason,  was
omitted  for  a  period  of  48  hours,  it  should  be  restarted  from
lowest  dose  and  titrated  upwards.  Adverse  effects  of  clozapine
include  constipation,  troublesome  hypersalivation,  tachycardia,
ECG  changes,  hypertension,  drowsiness,  dizziness,  headache,
impaired  temperature  regulation,
tremor,  seizures, 
urinary incontinence, urinary retention, leukopenia, eosinophilia,
leucocytosis,  and,  less  commonly,  agranulocytosis,  and  other
cardiovascular and respiratory side effects (BNF 2012).

fatigue, 

Accessibility of clozapine

Upon  reintroduction  of  clozapine  in  the  USA  in  1990,  clozapine
was  recommended  to  be  used  only 
in  treatment-resistant
schizophrenia,  along  with  regular  monitoring  for  side  effects
such as agranulocytosis. The British National Formulary currently
recommends clozapine be used only in "schizophrenia (including

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

psychosis  in  Parkinson’s  disease)  in  patients  unresponsive  to,  or
intolerant  of,  conventional  antipsychotic  drugs"  (BNF  2012).  The
National  Institute  for  Health  and  Care  Excellence  recommends
clozapine  in  people  suffering  from  schizophrenia  who  did  not
respond  adequately  to  sequential  use  of  adequate  doses  of  at
least  two  different  antipsychotic  drugs,  at  least  one  of  which
should be a non-clozapine second-generation antipsychotic (NICE).
Clozapine  is  made  available  only  through  the  manufacturer's
proprietary  monitoring  system,  and  all  the  UK  manufacturers  of
clozapine  such  as  Novartis  (Clozaril),  Merz  (Denzapine),  and  Teva
(Zaponex)  require  that  the  patients,  prescribers  and  supplying
pharmacists  be  registered  with  their  relevant  patient  monitoring
service. Through shared care arrangements with local community
pharmacies dispensing clozapine, it is possible in the UK to initiate
clozapine  treatment  in  the  community  after  registration  with  the
patient monitoring services is completed (CMHP). However, general
practitioners  generally  do  not  prescribe  clozapine  in  the  UK.
Aitchison  1997  suggested  that  the  costs  of  prescribing  clozapine
could  be  recouped  on  savings  in  future  inpatient  care.  Wang
2004  indicated  that  if  clozapine  was  made  available  as  a  first-
line  antipsychotic,  it  might  possibly  lead  to  small  gains  in  life
expectancy, at moderate but acceptable costs. Kane 2011 opined
that clozapine still remains strikingly under-utilised and that many
practitioners across the world and across different clinical settings
do not use clozapine even when indicated.

How the intervention might work

Clozapine  (Figure  1)  was  the  first  atypical  antipsychotic  to  show
definite  benefit  in  treatment  of  patients  where  symptoms  failed
to respond to typical agents. Clozapine has the highest affinity for
dopamine  D4,  5-HT1C,  5-HT2,  alpha  1,  muscarinic  and  histamine
H1  receptors,  but  moderate  affinity  is  also  seen  for  many
other  receptor  subtypes  (Coward  1992).  Clozapine  causes  fewer
extrapyramidal  side  effects  (EPSEs)  than  typical  antipsychotics
(Kane 1988). Clozapine appears to be more active at the limbic site
than the striatal site and this might explain its low extrapyramidal
side effect profile. It is metabolized mainly in the liver. Norclozapine
is an active metabolite of clozapine. Monitoring the plasma levels
of  clozapine  and  norclozapine  helps  to  assess  compliance.  It
is  suggested  that  the  therapeutic  response  is  associated  with
clozapine blood levels between 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml (Kronig
1995).  Chemicals  that  affect  cytochrome  enzymes  can  reduce  or
increase plasma clozapine concentration.

Why it is important to do this review

O B J E C T I V E S

Different  guidelines  suggest  different  dosing  for  clozapine.  For
example,  BNF  2012  recommends  a  usual  dose  of  200  mg/day  to
450  mg/day  and  the  maximum  daily  dose  of  900  mg.  Merz,  the
UK  manufacturer  of  Denzapine,  also  advises  the  prescription  of
clozapine  at  a  dose  between  200  mg/day  and  450  mg/day,  with
maximum doses up to 900 mg/day. Novartis, the UK manufacturer
of  Clozaril,  suggests  that  while  many  patients  may  respond
adequately at doses between 300 mg/day and 600 mg/day, it may
be  necessary  to  raise  the  dose  to  the  600  mg/day  to  900  mg/
day range to obtain an acceptable response. Kaplan 2005 suggests
that daily doses between 250 mg/day and 450 mg/day are usually
considered adequate and daily dosage above 600 mg/day is seldom
indicated. Semple 2007 advises that usual doses of 200 mg to 450
mg daily can be used, and that an increase in frequency of seizures
occurs at doses greater than 600 mg/day. Stahl 2006 suggests using
300 mg/day to 450 mg/day with a maximum of 900 mg/day, and
that  doses  of  more  than  550  mg/day  may  require  concomitant
anticonvulsant medications to reduce the risk of seizures. Plasma
levels may help guide dosing, with studies suggesting that maximal
clinical efficacy may be achieved when plasma levels of clozapine
are between 200 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml (typically associated with a
dose of 300 mg/day to 400 mg/day (Kronig 1995; Simpson 1999).
However, it is important to note that the relationship between the
dose  of  clozapine  and  the  resulting  serum  level  is  weak  (Taylor
1995).  This  could  be  a  reason  why  there  is  wide  variation  of  the
clinically  effective  dose  in  different  individuals.  It  is  still  unclear
as  to  what  dose  of  clozapine  is  most  effective  with  the  least
side  effects.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  as  well  that  patient  non-
compliance  can  be  as  high  as  50%  under  outpatient  conditions
and  this  could  be  due  to  drug-related  side  effects  (Gaebel  1997),
and  lead  to  relapse.  Clozapine  produces  severe  adverse  effects.
Hence we will review the evidence for doses of clozapine that are
both tolerable and effective in the management of schizophrenia,
schizophreniform  and  schizoaffective  disorders.  This  is  one  of  a
series of reviews on the effects of clozapine (Table 1).

To  compare  the  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  clozapine  at  different
doses and to identify the optimal dose of clozapine in the treatment
of schizophrenia, schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We  included  all  relevant  randomised  controlled  trials,  reporting
useable  data,  that  compared  different  doses  of  clozapine,
irrespective  of  blinding  status  and  published  language.  Where
people  were  given  additional  treatments  along  with  clozapine,
we  included  the  trial  only  if  the  adjunct  treatment  was  equal
in  both  groups  and  only  the  clozapine  doses  were  randomised.
We  included  studies  on  treatment-resistant  illnesses  and  took
the  opportunity  to  examine  clozapine’s  effect  on  the  course  of
the  illness  (for  example  acute,  partial  remission,  remission,  first
episode).  We  excluded  case  series  and  non-randomised  trials,
and  quasi-randomised  trials  where,  for  example,  allocation  is
undertaken on alternate days of the week or by alphabetical order.

Types of participants

included 

We 
schizophrenia,
studies  on  people  with 
schizophreniform disorder and schizoaffective disorder diagnosed
by  any  criteria.  We  decided  to  include  schizophreniform  and
schizoaffective  disorders  as  these  conditions  may  be  caused  by
similar  disease  processes  and  may  require  similar  treatment
approaches (Carpenter 1994).

Types of interventions

We compared the efficacy of different doses of clozapine in different
arms in the same trial. We did not compare efficacy of clozapine to
any other antipsychotic or to placebo or to any other medications.
The  intervention  of  interest  was  clozapine:  oral  formulation,  any
dose,  comparison  of  different  doses.  We  predefined  the  dosage
categories as follows.

1. Very low dose clozapine: up to 149 mg/day.

Data extraction and management

1.1 Data extraction

One  review  author  (SS)  extracted  data  from  all  included  reports.
To  ensure  reliability,  a  second  review  author  (BV)  independently
extracted data from a random 25% sample of these reports. There
was  no  disagreement.  Had  there  been  disagreement,  we  would
have  documented  decisions  and  contacted  authors  of  studies
for  clarification  where  necessary.  We  extracted  data  presented
in  graphs  and  figures  only,  whenever  possible.  We  attempted
to  contact  authors  in  order  to  obtain  missing  information  or
clarification whenever necessary.

1.2 Forms

We extracted data onto standard forms.

Dosage - Clozapine in Intervention Field of STUDY

In a study-based register such as this, searching the major concept
retrieves  all  the  synonyms  and  relevant  studies  because  all  the
studies have already been organised based on their interventions
and linked to the relevant topics.

This register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources
(including  AMED,  BIOSIS,  CINAHL,  Embase,  MEDLINE,  PsycINFO,
PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates,
handsearches,  grey  literature,  and  conference  proceedings  (see
Group’s  Module).  There  is  no  language,  date,  document  type,  or
publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.

For previous searches, please see Appendix 1.

Searching other resources

1. Reference searching

We searched the reference lists of each included paper, but failed to
find any new studies.

2. Personal contact

Where possible, we contacted the first author of trials or citations
for  missing  information  on  unpublished  data  or  trials.  Where
contact with the first author was not possible through the Cochrane
Schizophrenia Group, we attempted to contact the other authors.
At  the  time  of  writing,  we  have  not  received  any  of  the  missing
data we requested, though one author indicated he will send the
requested information at a future date. We have discussed this in
detail under relevant Results sections.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

One  review  author  (SS)  inspected  citations  from  the  searches,
identified  relevant  abstracts,  obtained  full  articles  of  all  relevant
abstracts,  and  classified  studies  as  'included',  'excluded',  or
'with  information  missing'.  We  placed  the  last  under  'pending

We  included  continuous  data  from  rating  scales  only  if  (a)  the
psychometric  properties  of  the  measuring  instrument  had  been
described  in  a  peer-reviewed  journal  (Marshall  2000),  and  (b)
the  measuring  instrument  had  not  been  written  or  modified  by
one  of  the  trialists  for  that  particular  trial.  Ideally  the  measuring
instrument should either be:

(a) a self-report;

(b)  an  instrument  completed  by  an  independent  rater  or  relative
(not the therapist);

(c) a global assessment of an area of functioning and not sub-scores
which  are  not,  in  themselves,  validated  or  shown  to  be  reliable.
However  there  are  exceptions:  we  included  sub-scores  from
mental state scales measuring positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia.

We  realise  that  this  is  not  often  reported  clearly  and  we  note  in
Description of studies if this was the case or not.

2.2 Endpoint versus change data

There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change
data  can  remove  a  component  of  between-person  variability
from  the  analysis.  On  the  other  hand,  calculation  of  change
needs  two  assessments  (baseline  and  endpoint)  which  can  be
difficult  in  unstable  and  difficult-to-measure  conditions  such  as
schizophrenia.  We  primarily  used  endpoint  data,  and  only  used
change  data  if  the  former  were  not  available.  We  combined
endpoint and change data in the analysis by the use throughout of
mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences
(Deeks 2011).

2.3 Skewed data

Continuous  data  on  clinical  and  social  outcomes  are  often  not
normally  distributed.  To  avoid  the  pitfall  of  applying  parametric
tests  to  non-parametric  data,  we  aimed  to  apply  the  following
standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and
means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;

b)  when  a  scale  starts  from  the  finite  number  zero,  the  standard
deviation,  when  multiplied  by  two,  is  less  than  the  mean  (as
otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the
centre of the distribution (Altman 1996); c) if a scale started from
a  positive  value  (such  as  the  PANSS  which  can  have  values  from
30 to 210), the calculation described above was modified to take
the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present
if  2SD  >  (S  −S  min),  where  S  is  the  mean  score  and  S  min  is  the
minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start
and end point and the above rules can be applied. We did not come
across skewed endpoint data in our review, but if we had then we
would have entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer
than 200 participants as other data within the Data and analyses
section rather than into a statistical analysis. Skewed endpoint data
would pose fewer problems when looking at means if the sample
size is large, and we would have then entered these into syntheses.

When  continuous  data  are  presented  on  a  scale  that  includes  a
possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to
tell whether data are skewed or not, and we would have entered
skewed change data into statistical analysis.

2.4 Common measure

To  facilitate  comparison  between  trials,  where  possible  we  tried
to convert variables reported in different metrics (e.g. days spent
in hospital as mean days per year or per week or per month) to a
common metric (e.g. mean days per month).

2.5 Conversion of continuous to binary

Where  possible,  we  would  have  converted  outcome  measures  to
dichotomous data. This would have been done by identifying cut-
off  points  on  rating  scales  and  dividing  participants  accordingly
into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally
assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score
such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, Overall 1962) or
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, Kay 1986), this
could  be  considered  as  a  clinically  significant  response  (Leucht
2005a;  Leucht  2005b).  If  data  based  on  these  thresholds  had  not
been available, we would have used the primary cut-off presented
by the original authors. Where data on clinical improvement was
presented as 'very effective', 'effective' and 'no improvement', we
grouped these to form the dichotomous outcome of 'effective'/'no
improvement'.

2.6 Direction of graphs

Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the
left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for lower
dose of clozapine.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

One  review  author  (SS)  independently  assessed  risk  of  bias  by
using criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews  of  Interventions  to  assess  trial  quality  (Higgins  2011b).
A  second  review  author  (BV)  randomly  checked  25%  to  ensure
reliability. This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations
between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article
such  as  sequence  generation,  allocation  concealment,  blinding,
incomplete  outcome  data  and  selective  reporting.  There  was  no
disagreement.  If  there  had  been  disagreement,  we  would  have
resolved it by further discussion. The level of risk of bias is noted in
both the text of the review and in the 'Summary of findings' table.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Measures of treatment effect

1. Binary data

For  binary  outcomes  we  calculated  a  standard  estimation  of  the
risk  ratio  (RR)  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  (CI).  It  has  been
shown  that  RR  is  more  intuitive  than  odds  ratios  (Boissel  1999);
and  that  odds  ratios  tend  to  be  interpreted  as  RR  by  clinicians
(Deeks  2000).  The  number  needed  to  treat  for  an  additional
beneficial outcome/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH) statistic with
its  confidence  intervals  is  intuitively  attractive  to  clinicians  but
is  problematic  both  in  its  accurate  calculation  in  meta-analyses
and  interpretation  (Hutton  2009).  For  binary  data  presented  in
the  'Summary  of  findings'  table/s,  where  possible  we  calculated
illustrative comparative risks.

2. Continuous data

We estimated mean difference (MD) between groups for continuous
outcomes.  We  preferred  not  to  calculate  effect  size  measures
(standardised  mean  difference  (SMD)).  However,  if  very  similar
scales had been used, we would have presumed there was a small
difference in measurement and would have calculated effect size
and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the
specific instruments.

Unit of analysis issues

1. Cluster trials

Studies  increasingly  employ  'cluster  randomisation'  (such  as
randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of
clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account
for  intra-class  correlation  in  clustered  studies,  leading  to  a  'unit
of  analysis'  error  (Divine  1992),  whereby  P  values  are  spuriously
low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance
overestimated.  This  causes  type  I  errors  (Bland  1997;  Gulliford
1999).

There  were  no  cluster  trials  included  in  our  review.  If  there  had
been cluster studies, then where clustering was not accounted for
in primary studies we would have presented data in a table, with
a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis
error.  In  subsequent  versions  of  this  review  we  will  contact  first
authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients for
their clustered data and adjust for this by using accepted methods
(Gulliford 1999).

If  clustering  had  been  incorporated  into  the  analysis  of  primary
studies,  we  would  have  presented  these  data  as  if  from  a
non-cluster  randomised  study,  but  would  have  adjusted  for  the
clustering  effect.  Statistical  advice  has  been  sought  in  the  past:
it  was  advised  that  binary  data  should  be  presented  in  a  report
and  divided  by  a  'design  effect'.  This  is  calculated  using  the
mean  number  of  participants  per  cluster  (m)  and  the  intra-class
correlation  coefficient  (ICC):  [Design  effect  =  1  +  (m  −  1)  *  ICC]
(Donner  2002).  If  the  ICC  had  not  been  reported  we  would  have
assumed it to be 0.1 (Ukoumunne 1999). If cluster studies had been
appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation
coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis
with  other  studies  might  have  been  possible  using  the  generic
inverse variance technique.

2. Cross-over trials

We  only  used  data  from  the  first  phase  of  cross-over  studies.  A
major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs
if  an  effect  (e.g.  pharmacological,  physiological  or  psychological)
of  the  treatment  in  the  first  phase  is  carried  over  to  the  second
phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase participants
can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out
phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if
the condition of interest is unstable (Elbourne 2002). Because both
these  effects  are  very  likely  in  severe  mental  illness,  we  decided
to use data from the first phase of cross-over studies only. In our
review, the Simpson 1999 trial was conducted in three phases of 16
weeks each, lasting for a total of 48 weeks with the last two phases
being crossed over. For this trial we included the data from the first
16 weeks only (i.e. before cross-over occurred).

3. Studies with multiple treatment groups

There was no relevant additional treatment in any of the included
trials. If a study had involved additional treatment arms, we would
have presented the additional arms in comparisons only if relevant
and  would  not  have  reproduced  data  from  irrelevant  arms.  For
binary  data,  we  would  simply  have  added  these  and  combined
within  a  two-by-two  table.  For  continuous  data,  we  would  have
combined the data following the formula in the Cochrane Handbook
for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2011a).  In  cases
where  a  study  had  two  intervention  arms  which  both  fell  within
a  single-dosage  category  defined  in  Types  of  interventions  (for
example,  in  Chen  2013  where  both  the  301  mg/day  to  400  mg/
day intervention and the 401 mg/day to 500 mg/day intervention
fell  within  the  ‘standard’  dose  category),  means  and  standard
deviations were combined for continuous outcomes using methods
described in section 7.7.3.8 of Higgins 2011a.

Dealing with missing data

1. Overall loss of credibility

At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (Xia
2009). If more than 50% of data had been unaccounted for in any
particular  outcome,  we  had  decided  neither  to  reproduce  these
data nor to use them within our analyses. In this review, however,
loss of data was never more than 50% for any outcome or in any
arm. If the loss of data had been more than 50% but the total loss
had been less than 50%, we would have marked such data with (*)
to indicate that the result might have been prone to bias.

2. Binary

Those  who  left  the  study  early  were  all  assumed  to  have  the
same outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the
outcomes of death and adverse effects.

3. Continuous

3.1 Attrition

Had  attrition  for  a  continuous  outcome  been  between  0%  and
50% and completer-only data had been reported, we would have
reproduced these data.

3.2 Standard deviations

In  our  review,  there  were  few  data  whose  standard  deviations
(SDs) were missing. We tried to obtain the missing values from the
authors, but were unsuccessful. Where there are missing measures

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

of  variance  for  continuous  data,  but  an  exact  standard  error  (SE)
and confidence intervals available for group means, and either P
value or t value available for differences in mean, we can calculate
them according to the rules described in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a): When only the
standard error (SE) is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula
SD = SE * square root (n). The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a) present detailed formulae
for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals,
ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we could
calculate  the  SDs  according  to  a  validated  imputation  method
which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (Furukawa
2006). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce
error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study’s outcome
and  thus  to  lose  information.  We  examined  the  validity  of  the
imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values. In
our review we needed to exclude some outcome data as suggested
by this last option.

3.3 Last observation carried forward

We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation
carried  forward  (LOCF)  would  have  been  reported.  As  with  all
methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces
uncertainty  about  the  reliability  of  the  results  (Leucht  2007).  We
found  no  cases  where  less  than  50%  of  the  LOCF  data  were
available;  if  we  had,  we  would  have  reproduced  these  data  and
indicated that they were based on LOCF assumptions.

Assessment of heterogeneity

1. Clinical heterogeneity

We  considered  all  included  studies  initially,  without  seeing
comparison data to judge clinical heterogeneity. We inspected all
studies  for  clearly  outlying  people  or  situations  which  we  had
not  predicted  would  arise,  but  we  did  not  come  across  any  such
outlying conditions.

2. Methodological heterogeneity

included  studies 

We  considered  all 
initially  without  seeing
comparison  data  to  judge  methodological  heterogeneity.  We
simply inspected all studies for clearly outlying methods which we
had not predicted would arise, but we did not come across any such
outlying methods.

3. Statistical heterogeneity

3.1 Visual inspection

We  visually  inspected  the  graphs  to  investigate  the  possibility  of
statistical heterogeneity.

3.2 Employing the I2 statistic

We  investigated  heterogeneity  between  studies  by  considering
the  I2  method  alongside  the  Chi2  P  value.  The  I2  provides  an
estimate  of  the  percentage  of  inconsistency  thought  to  be  due
to  chance  (Higgins  2003).  The  importance  of  the  observed  value
of  I2  depends  on  (i)  magnitude  and  direction  of  effects,  and  (ii)
strength  of  evidence  for  heterogeneity  (e.g.  P  value  from  Chi2
  test,  or  a  confidence  interval  for  I2).  I2  estimates  greater  than
or  equal  to  50%  and  accompanied  by  a  statistically  significant
Chi2  statistic  are  interpreted  as  evidence  of  substantial  levels  of
heterogeneity  (Deeks  2011).  If  substantial  levels  of  heterogeneity

had been found in the primary outcome, we would have explored
reasons for heterogeneity (Subgroup analysis and investigation of
heterogeneity).

Assessment of reporting biases

1. Protocol versus full study

We  attempted  to  locate  protocols  of  the  included  randomised
trials but were unsuccessful. We therefore compared the outcomes
listed in the Methods section of the trial report with those actually
reported in the results.

2. Funnel plot

Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings
is  influenced  by  the  nature  and  direction  of  results  (Egger  1997).
These  are  described  in  Chapter  10  of  the  Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Sterne  2011).  We  are  aware
that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but
have  limited  power  to  detect  small-study  effects.  We  did  not  use
funnel plots as there were only three randomised controlled studies
included in this review.

Data synthesis

We  understand  that  there  is  no  closed  argument  in  favour  of
either a fixed-effect or a random-effects model. The random-effects
method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are
estimating  different,  yet  related,  intervention  effects.  This  often
seems  to  be  true  to  us  and  the  random-effects  model  takes  into
account differences between studies even if there is no statistically
significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the
random-effects model: it adds weight to small studies, which often
are  the  most  biased  ones.  Depending  on  the  direction  of  effect,
these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose
a  random-effects  model  for  all  analyses.  The  reader  is,  however,
able to choose to inspect the data using the fixed-effect model by
opening this review in RevMan 5 format and selecting to view by
"fixed effect" model under the properties section of each graph.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

1. Subgroup analyses

We  had  planned  to  report  data  on  subgroups  of  participants
(for  example,  those  who  received  additional  medications  or  had
additional diagnoses), but we did not encounter such subgroups.

1.1 Clinical state, stage or problem

This  review  provides  an  overview  of  the  effects  of  clozapine  for
people  with  schizophrenia,  schizophreniform  and  schizoaffective
disorder. Our aim was also to report data on subgroups of people
in  the  same  clinical  state,  stage  and  with  similar  problems  (for
example patients in agitated state, partial remission, remission or
first episode), but we did not come across any such subgroups.

2. Investigation of heterogeneity

We report if inconsistency was high. First, we investigated whether
data were entered correctly. Secondly, if the data were correct, we
visually  inspected  the  graphs  and  successively  removed  outlying
studies  to  see  if  heterogeneity  was  restored.  For  this  review  we
decided  that  we  would  present  the  data  if  this  occurred  in  no
more than 10% of the total weighting of the summary findings. If
not, we would not pool data but would only discuss the issues. If

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity had been
obvious,  we  would  have  stated  the  hypotheses  regarding  these
for  future  reviews  or  versions  of  this  review  and  would  not  have
undertaken analyses relating to these.

Sensitivity analysis

1. Implication of randomisation

We would have included in a sensitivity analysis primary outcomes
data  from  studies  where  randomisation  was  implied  but  was
not  clearly  described,  but  we  did  not  come  across  such  studies.
If  there  had  been  no  substantive  difference  when  the  implied
randomised studies were added to those with better description of
randomisation, then we would have employed all data from these
studies.

2. Assumptions for lost binary data

Where  assumptions  were  made  regarding  participants  lost  to
follow-up (see Dealing with missing data) we would have compared
the  findings  of  the  primary  outcomes  when  we  used  our
assumption  compared  with  completer  data  only.  If  there  had
been a substantial difference, we would have reported the results
and  discussed  them  but  would  have  continued  to  employ  our
assumption. Where assumptions were made regarding missing SDs
data  (see  Dealing  with  missing  data),  we  would  have  compared
the findings on primary outcomes when we used our assumption
compared with completer data only. We would have undertaken a
sensitivity analysis testing as to how prone results would have been
to change with completer data only compared to the imputed data
using the above assumption. If there would have been a substantial
difference,  we  would  have  reported  these  results  and  discussed
them but would have continued to employ our assumption. We did
not have to make such assumptions in our review.

3. Risk of bias

We  analysed  the  effects  of  excluding  trials  that  were  judged  to
be  at  high  risk  of  bias  across  one  or  more  of  the  domains  —
randomisation,  allocation  concealment,  blinding  and  outcome
reporting  and  other  bias  —  for  the  meta-analyses  of  the  primary
outcome.  If  the  exclusion  of  trials  at  high  risk  of  bias  did  not
substantially  alter  the  direction  of  effect  or  the  precision  of  the
effect  estimates,  then  we  included  data  from  these  trials  in  the
analysis.

4. Imputed values

We did not include any cluster trials. If any had been included, we
would have undertaken sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of
including data from trials where we had used imputed values for
ICCs in calculating the design effect. If substantial differences in the
direction  or  precision  of  effect  estimates  in  any  of  the  sensitivity
analyses  had  been  noted,  we  would  not  have  pooled  data,  but
would have presented them separately.

5. Fixed-effect and random-effects

We synthesised all data using a random-effects model.

Results of the search

The search strategy yielded 122 citations. One was a duplicate. We
closely inspected 23 full-text reports; and after excluding 18 full-text
reports, we included five studies in the review. A random 20% of the
citations were independently reviewed by one review author (BV)
to increase reliability. Details of the search results are illustrated in
the PRISMA table (Figure 2).

Included studies

5. Interventions

We included five studies with a total of 452 participants.

1. Study length

Chen 1998 and Chen 2013 were short-term trials lasting six weeks.
Sheng  1990  and  Liu  2005  were  also  short  term  (12  weeks).  The
Simpson 1999 trial was originally conducted in three phases of 16
weeks each, lasting for a total of 48 weeks. However, after the first
16 weeks, the non-responders in the trial were crossed over to other
arms and hence they were not randomised anymore after the initial
16 weeks. So, as per protocol, we included the results of only the
first 16 weeks (medium term: 13 to 26 weeks) from these citations.
There were no long-term studies (> 26 weeks).

We classified interventions into five groups according to clozapine
dosage.  Liu  2005  administered  clozapine  at  less  than  150  mg/
day  (very  low  dose),  at  150  mg/day  to  300  mg/day  (low  dose)
and  at  more  than  300  mg/day  (standard  dose).  Simpson  1999
administered  clozapine  at  100  mg/day  (very  low  dose),  300  mg/
day  (low  dose)  and  600  mg/day  (standard  dose).  Chen  1998
administered clozapine at 200 mg/day (low dose) and at 500 mg/
day (standard dose). Chen 2013 administered doses of 200 mg/day
to 300 mg/day, 301 mg/day to 400 mg/day and 401 mg/day to 500
mg/day.  Sheng  1990  administered  doses  of  300  mg/day  and  600
mg/day. No trial administered clozapine at more than 601 mg/day
(high dose) or more than 901 mg/day (very high dose).

2. Design

All included studies were randomised controlled trials. Chen 1998
is a randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy of clozapine
at  doses  of  200  mg  and  500  mg;  details  of  blinding  status  and  of
any sponsorship are unclear. Liu 2005 is a randomised controlled
trial  comparing  clozapine  at  doses  of  less  than  150  mg/day,  150
mg/day  to  300  mg/day  and  more  than  300  mg/day,  in  which
participants were allocated using a random number table; details
of blinding status and of any sponsorship are unclear. Chen 2013 is
a randomised trial comparing doses of 200 mg/day to 300 mg/day,
301 mg/day to 400 mg/day and 401 mg/day to 500 mg/day. Sheng
1990  is  a  randomised  trial  comparing  doses  of  300  mg/day  and
600  mg/day.  Simpson  1999  is  an  implied  randomised  controlled
trial  comparing  the  efficacy  of  clozapine  at  different  doses  of
100  mg/day,  300  mg/day  and  600  mg/day  in  50  patients.  The
trial  was  sponsored  by  Novartis  Pharmaceuticals  and  conducted
between  1992  and  1995;  the  participants  stayed  in  the  research
centre for four weeks for adaptation (naturalistic baseline with no
modification  in  their  treatment  regimen)  and  underwent  a  four-
week  haloperidol  treatment  followed  by  a  one-week  wash  out
before the first phase of clozapine treatment.

3. Participants

A total of 452 participants were included in the five trials. Chen 1998
conducted their study on a total of 176 male and female patients,
aged  between  17  and  55  years,  suffering  from  schizophrenia  and
with  illness  duration  of  8  (±  11  months)  on  average.  Liu  2005
included  87  male  patients  aged  between  18  and  45  years  and
used  CCMD-3  to  diagnose  patients  suffering  from  schizophrenia.
Chen  2013  and  Sheng  1990  randomised  90  and  51  patients  with
schizophrenia,  respectively.  Simpson  1999  was  conducted  on  a
total  of  22  males  and  28  females  with  a  mean  age  of  44.8  years
(range 35 to 54) suffering from schizophrenia, treatment refractory
or  schizoaffective  disorder,  diagnosed  by  DSM-III-R  criteria.  Mean
illness  duration  was  25.1  years  (range  1  to  38  years)  and  the
median  number  of  psychiatric  hospitalisations  was  five  (range  1
to  25).  Patients  had  not  shown  a  satisfactory  clinical  response
to  treatment  with  at  least  three  neuroleptic  drugs  (each  given
for  at  least  six  weeks  in  doses  equivalent  to  1000  mg/day  of
chlorpromazine).

4. Settings

Simpson  1999  used  a  research  ward  inpatient  setting  in  a  State
hospital in the USA. Liu 2005 was conducted in an inpatient setting
in  a  medical  college.  The  settings  for  Chen  1998,  Chen  2013  and
Sheng 1990 were unclear.

6. Outcomes

6.1 Rating scales

Details of the scales that provided usable data are shown below.
Reasons  for  exclusions  of  data  and/or  scales  are  given  under
‘Outcomes’ in the Characteristics of included studies table.

6.1.1 Mental state

6.1.1.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ‒ BPRS (Overall 1962)

The BPRS is an 18-item scale measuring positive symptoms, general
psychopathology  and  affective  symptoms.  High  scores  indicate
more  severe  symptoms.  The  original  scale  has  16  items  that  are
rated in interview format using Likert scale ratings from 1 (‘absent’)
to  7  (‘very  severe’)  with  scores  ranging  from  0  to  112.  A  revised
18-item  scale  is  commonly  used  with  scores  ranging  from  0  to
126. The BPRS-A is an anchored version of the BPRS. It describes
expected  symptoms  and  problems  for  each  of  the  seven  rating
options for each item. As such, it is thought that the BPRS-A anchor
points provide an increased level of standardisation, leading to an
improvement  in  rater  reliability  (Woerner  1988).  The  BPRS-A  and
its  subscales  have  been  validated  (Lachar  2001).  Chen  1998  and
Simpson 1999 reported data on the BPRS-A.

6.1.2 Adverse events

6.1.2.1  Treatment-Emergent  Signs  and  Symptoms  -  TESS  (NIMH
1985)

This checklist assesses a variety of characteristics for each adverse
event,  including  severity,  relationship  to  the  drug,  temporal
characteristics (timing after a dose, duration and pattern during the
day), contributing factors, course, and action taken to counteract
the effect. Symptoms can be listed a priori or can be recorded as
observed  by  the  investigator.  A  low  score  indicates  low  levels  of
adverse  effects.  Chen  1998  and  Chen  2013  reported  data  on  this
outcome.

Excluded studies

Of the 122 references identified using the search strategy, one was
a duplicate. We closely inspected 28 reports and excluded 23. Liu
2005a  and  Tang  2000  were  not  randomised  trials.  All  data  were
missing in de Leon 1995a and de Leon 2004 and we contacted the
author who confirmed that no further data were available. de Leon
2003  was  excluded  as  the  data  on  serum  antimuscarinic  activity
was missing at 16 weeks before the cross-over point. Potkin 1993
and Potkin 1994 also had all data missing from the reports and no
data were useable; we contacted the author regarding the missing

data but no response has been received at the time of writing. We
excluded Han 2001 as different doses of sulpiride were prescribed
in the clozapine arms. VanderZwaag 1996 and VanderZwaag 1997
compared the effectiveness of different serum clozapine levels, but
not the effects of different doses of clozapine. Nair 1998 and Nair
1999 were excluded because the authors compared those with and
without  probable  tardive  dyskinesia  in  subgroups  of  23  and  33
participants respectively from the Simpson 1999 trial, but provided
no additional data relevant to this review.

Studies awaiting classification

Abraham 1997 is a report of a trial conducted from 1992 to 1995,
reported  in  detail  in  Simpson  1999  where  it  is  mentioned  that
global  state  was  measured  using  the  Clinical  Global  Impression
(CGI)  and  these  data  would  be  discussed  in  Abraham  1997.
However, Abraham 1997 only retrospectively analysed the data on
responders and non-responders; four participants responded, but

it was unclear from the report which groups they belonged to and
the CGI data for the dosage groups were also missing. We contacted
the main trialist who indicated he would provide the missing data,
but this has not been received at the time of writing. If we receive
this subsequently, we will include it in an update of this review.

Ongoing studies

We did not identify any ongoing studies.

Risk of bias in included studies

None of the studies explicitly described the allocation process fully.
Some  of  the  studies  were  selective  in  presenting  their  data  on
outcomes. Some of the outcomes in the trials could not be used and
we have not received missing data we requested from the authors
of the trials. Simpson 1999 was a trial sponsored by a clozapine drug
company. See Figure 3, Figure 4.

Allocation

All five studies were described as randomised. Allocation in Liu 2005
was via a random number generator. Simpson 1999, Sheng 1990,
Chen  2013  and  Chen  1998  did  not  describe  the  methods  used  to
generate the allocation sequence. None of the studies reported on
how the results of allocation were concealed.

Blinding

Simpson 1999 was described as a double-blind trial with assessors
blinded  and  all  patients  receiving  the  same  number  of  identical
capsules  every  time,  although  the  authors  appear  not  to  have
tested  the  success  of  blinding  for  participants  or  evaluators.

This  may  increase  the  risk  of  observer  bias  with  potential  for
overestimation of positive effects and underestimation of negative
ones.  Chen  1998  and  Liu  2005  did  not  report  if  their  trials
were  blinded.  Chen  2013  and  Sheng  1990  did  not  report  how
blinding took place. Blinding may be less important for objective
outcomes  such  as  death,  but  the  studies  included  here  reported
only subjective outcomes.

Incomplete outcome data

Chen 1998, Chen 2013 and Sheng 1990 appear to have had no loss
to follow up. Liu 2005 reported on three participants who left the
study early with clear reasons for doing so. Simpson 1999 reported
the  number  leaving  the  study  early  and  explicitly  described  that

their last observations were carried forward; however, data on the
scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) were not
reported. de Leon 2007 reported data on patients who completed
the Simpson 1999 trial. However the number of patients on whom
measures were reported differed slightly from week to week, and
it is unclear why the number of patients on whom measurements
were  reported  at  each  week  differed,  who  had  missed  their
measurements and why the measurements were not taken.

Selective reporting

Simpson 1999 did not report on SANS. Sheng 1990 did not report
BPRS or TESS scores. Simpson 1999 reported responders' and non-
responders'  data  only  at  48  weeks,  which  is  after  the  cross-over
point at 16 weeks. No data is reported before the cross-over.

Effects of interventions

See:  Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison  Clozapine:
very low dose (up to 149 mg/day) versus low dose (150 mg/day to
300 mg/day) for schizophrenia; Summary of findings 2 Clozapine:
very low dose (up to 149 mg/day) versus standard dose (301 mg/
day  to  600  mg/day)  for  schizophrenia;  Summary  of  findings  3
Clozapine: low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day) versus standard
dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day) for schizophrenia

In  the  text  below,  data  from  Simpson  1999  have  been  adjusted
in  accordance  with  the  published  corrections  (Simpson  2001).
Specifically, the standard errors for BPRS-A endpoint scores which
were  originally  reported  by  the  authors  as  if  they  were  standard
deviations have been converted to standard deviations.

Comparison 1: clozapine: very low dose (up to 149 mg/day)
versus low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day)

1.1 Mental state: average endpoint scores (BPRS-A, high = poor)
– medium term

1.5 Adverse effects: 2a. metabolic – blood glucose – before and
after meal

No difference between the groups were found before a meal (n = 59,
1 RCT, MD −0.40, 95% CI −1.06 to 0.26), one hour after meal (n = 59,
1 RCT, MD −0.70, 95% CI −2.01 to 0.61), two hours after meal (n = 59,
1 RCT, MD 0.30, 95% CI −0.98 to 1.58) and three hours after meal (n =
59, 1 RCT, MD −0.70, 95% CI −1.59 to 0.19). There was no significant
difference in the overall analysis (n = 59, 1 RCT, MD −0.43, 95% CI
−0.89 to 0.03; Analysis 1.5).

1.6 Adverse effects: 2b. metabolic - lipid profile - short term

Participants on low-dose clozapine had significantly lower serum
triglycerides than those on a very low dose (n = 59, 1 RCT, MD 1.00,
95% CI 0.51 to 1.49). Otherwise there was no significant difference
between the groups in terms of serum total cholesterol (n = 59, 1
RCT, MD 0.50, 95% CI −0.12 to 1.12), high density lipoprotein (HDL)
(n = 59, 1 RCT, MD 0.04, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.22), low density lipoprotein
(LDL) (n = 59, 1 RCT, MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.36 to 0.56), Apo-A1 (n = 59,
1 RCT, MD 0.05, 95% CI −0.10 to 0.20) and Apo-B (n = 59, 1 RCT, MD
0.13, 95% CI −0.16 to 0.42). All Analysis 1.6.

1.7 Leaving the study early

Simpson 1999 found no significant difference in numbers leaving
the  study  early  between  the  groups  in  the  medium  term  for  any
reason  (n  =  31,  1  RCT,  RR  6.00,  95%  CI  0.31  to  115.56;  Analysis
1.7). Liu 2005 reported no significant difference between the groups
in  the  short  term  due  to  specific  side  effects  (n  =  60,  1  RCT,  RR
0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; Analysis 1.7). The overall analysis showed
no  significant  difference  in  the  numbers  leaving  the  study  early
between the very low dose and the low-dose groups in the short
and  medium  term  (n  =  91,  2  RCTs,  RR  1.50,  95%  CI  0.09  to  25.41;
Analysis 1.7).

Missing outcomes

Simpson 1999 found no significant difference in endpoint mental
state scores at 16 weeks measured using the BPRS-A (n = 31, MD
3.55, 95% CI −4.50 to 11.60; Analysis 1.1).

For  this  comparison,  no  studies  reported  on  global  state,  death,
behaviour, functioning, quality of life, satisfaction with treatment,
service use and economic costs.

1.2 Adverse effects: 1a. weight - BMI (kg/m2) – short term

Liu  2005  found  no  significant  difference  in  BMI  at  the  end  of  six
weeks in the very low dose group compared to the low dose group
(n = 59, MD −0.10, 95% CI −0.95 to 0.75; Analysis 1.2).

1.3 Adverse effects: 1b. weight gain (kg; average)

1  RCT,  MD  −1.10,  95%  CI  −3.93  to  1.73;  Analysis  1.3).  There  was
similarly  no  significant  difference  between  the  groups  in  weight
gain  at  16  weeks  (n  =  28,  1  RCT,  MD  −1.30,  95%  CI  −4.86  to  2.26;
Analysis 1.3).

1.4 Adverse effects: 1c. weight – body weight at endpoint (kg;

groups at the end of six weeks (n = 59, 1 RCT, MD 0.00, 95% CI −3.92
to 3.92; Analysis 1.4).

One study, Liu 2005, reported on two other adverse effects.

15.43; Analysis 2.1).

2.2 Adverse effects: 1a. weight – BMI (in kg/m2) – short term

Liu 2005 found no significant difference in body mass index (BMI)
at the end of six weeks in the very low dose group compared to the
standard-dose group (n = 58, 1 RCT, MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.76 to 0.96;
Analysis 2.2).

2.3 Adverse effects: 1b. weight – weight gain (kg; average)

weight gain in the very low dose group at 12 weeks (n = 27, 1 RCT,
MD −2.70, 95% CI −5.38 to −0.02), although no significant difference
between the groups at 16 weeks (n = 28, 1 RCT, MD −3.10, 95% CI
−6.73 to 0.53; Analysis 2.3).

Chen 1998 found a significantly greater incidence in the standard
compared to the low dose group for lethargy (n = 176, RR 0.77, 95%
CI 0.60 to 0.97; Analysis 3.10), hypersalivation (n = 176, RR 0.70, 95%

the study early for any reason between the groups in the medium
term (n = 34, 1 RCT, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.88; Analysis 3.12). Liu
2005 found no significant difference in numbers leaving the study

Summary of main results

We included five studies with data from 452 participants suffering
from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders diagnosed by any
criteria. We categorised doses of clozapine into five categories: very
low  dose  clozapine:  up  to  149  mg/day;  low-dose  clozapine:  150
mg/day  to  300  mg/day;  standard-dose  clozapine:  301  mg/day  to
600 mg/day; high-dose clozapine: 601 mg/day to 900 mg/day; and
very  high  dose  clozapine:  901  mg/day  and  above.  Simpson  1999
compared  the  effects  of  clozapine  at  doses  of  100  mg/day  (very
low), 300 mg/day (low dose) and 600 mg/day (standard dose) over
both  short  term  (up  to  12  weeks)  and  medium  term  (16  weeks).
Chen 2013 compared doses of 200 mg/day to 300 mg/day, 301 mg/
day to 400 mg/day, and 401 mg/day to 500 mg/day over 12 weeks.
Sheng 1990 compared doses of 300 mg/day and 600 mg/day over

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

12  weeks.  Liu  2005  compared  effects  of  three  different  doses  of
clozapine:  less  than  150  mg/day  (very  low  dose);  150  mg/day  to
300 mg/day (low dose); and more than 300 mg/day (standard) over
short term.

Liu  2005  reported  over  six  weeks  on  outcomes  including  leaving
the study early, body weight, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile
and  blood  glucose  levels  measured  before  meals,  and  one  hour,
two  hours  and  three  hours  after  meals.  Chen  2013  reported  on
mental state as clinical improvement (clinician assessed), and on
TESS scale scores. Outcomes reported by Sheng 1990 were mental
state as clinical improvement (clinician assessed), but the authors
did not report BPRS scores or TESS scale scores.

Chen 1998 compared clozapine at doses of 200 mg/day (low dose)
and 500 mg/day (standard dose) in short-term and reported data
over  six  weeks  on  outcomes  including  global  state  on  clinically
important response as defined by individual studies (curative rate:
BPRS  score  <  30%  change  =  no  improvement),  mental  state  on
the Brief Psychiatric Rating scale-Anchored (BPRS-A) and subscores
of  this  scale,  and  adverse  reaction  using  the  TESS  scale  and  the
incidence of lethargy, hypersalivation, dizziness, and tachycardia.

Simpson  1999  reported  on  leaving  the  study  early,  BPRS-A  total
scores.  Though  their  report  stated  that  they  measured  CGI  and
SANS, these data were not reported in the paper. Data on end body
weight, weight gain and BMI over shorter term and medium term
were reported in de Leon 2007. Data on BMI could not be used as it
was not presented according to doses. We also could not use data
on “clinically important response as defined by individual studies”
as the details of responders were presented only at 48 weeks and
not at 16 weeks (before cross-over). In addition, it is reported that
four people responded at end of 16 weeks, but it is unclear which
dosage group these four patients belonged to. Simpson 1999 stated
that data on CGI would be discussed in Abraham 1997, but we found
this  was  not  the  case.  We  contacted  the  author  for  data  on  CGI,
SANS, data on responders at 16 weeks and the details on which arm
the four responders belonged to but we have not received the data
at the time of writing.

There  were  no  studies  comparing  high  dose  or  very  high  dose  of
clozapine and none of the reports identified presented outcomes in
the longer term.

1 Comparison: clozapine: very low dose (up to 149 mg/day)
versus low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day)

Short term

We  found  no  evidence  relating  to  clinical  response.  In  terms
of  adverse  effects,  in  one  RCT  of  59  participants  there  was  no
difference between the groups in BMI at endpoint with the very low
dose  group  only  0.1  lower  (0.95  lower  to  0.75  higher)  (Liu  2005).
On  other  outcomes,  the  same  study  found  low-dose  clozapine
associated  with  lower  serum  triglycerides  compared  to  very  low
dose, but no differences between the groups in other elements of
the lipid profile, in blood glucose levels, in body weight at endpoint
or in leaving the study early.

Medium term

We found no evidence relating to clinical response. In one small RCT
of 31 participants (Simpson 1999), there was no difference between
the groups in average BPRS-A scores and no difference on change

in mental state score. On other outcomes, no difference was found
between the groups in terms of weight gain or number leaving the
study early (Simpson 1999).

2 Comparison: clozapine: very low (up to 149 mg/day) versus
standard dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day)

Short term

We  found  no  evidence  relating  to  clinical  response  in  the  short
term. In terms of adverse effects, in one RCT of 58 participants there
was no difference between the groups in BMI at endpoint with the
very  low  dose  group  only  0.1  higher  (0.76  lower  to  0.96  higher)
(Liu 2005). There was no difference in body weight at endpoint in
the same study, although the very low dose group had less weight
gain than the standard-dose group at six and 12 weeks. On other
outcomes, we found evidence in one study that the very low dose
group had lower glucose levels one hour post meal compared to
the  standard-dose  group,  but  otherwise  there  was  no  difference
between the groups in blood glucose measurements (Liu 2005); and
no  difference  between  the  groups  in  numbers  leaving  the  study
early. In the same study, at six weeks standard dose was associated
with lower serum triglycerides, serum total cholesterol and Apo-B,
but otherwise there was no difference between the groups in terms
of lipid profile (Liu 2005). These results should be interpreted with
caution as this trial was conducted only for six weeks with a small
number of participants.

Medium term

We found no evidence relating to clinical response in the medium
term. On other outcomes, no differences between the groups were
found in the medium term for weight gain or numbers leaving the
study early (Simpson 1999).

3. Comparison: clozapine: low dose (150 mg/day to 300 mg/
day) versus standard dose (301 mg/day to 600 mg/day)

Short term

We found no evidence relating to clinical response or to clinically
significant  response  in  global  state  in  the  short  term.  In  one  RCT
of 57 participants there was no difference between the groups in
BMI  at  endpoint  with  the  low-dose  group  only  0.2  higher  (0.84
lower  to  1.24  higher)  (Liu  2005).  On  other  outcomes,  there  was
no  difference  between  the  groups  on  body  weight  at  endpoint,
lipid profile or blood glucose measurements. Side effects measured
by  TESS  were  less  in  the  low-dose  group  in  two  studies  (Chen
1998;  Chen  2013),  and  the  incidence  of  lethargy,  hypersalivation,
dizziness and tachycardia were also less in the low-dose group in
one study (Chen 1998).

Medium term

We found no evidence from one RCT of 34 participants that mental
state at endpoint, numbers leaving the study early or weight gain
differed between the groups (Simpson 1999).

4. Missing outcomes

There was no information available on other important outcomes
such as clinically significant response in social or life skills, relapse,
prolactin increase, service use, satisfaction with care or quality of
life.

5. Summary

We identified just three randomised controlled trials that met our
inclusion criteria. We looked at a range of different doses including
very  low  (up  to  149  mg/day),  low  (150  mg/day  to  300  mg/day),
standard  (301  mg/day  to  600  mg/day),  high  (601  mg/day  to  900
mg/day) and very high (901 mg/day and above). All trials identified
compared  very  low  dose,  low  dose  and  standard  dose  only.  No
trials  were  identified  comparing  high  dose  or  very  high  dose  to
standard dose. Two studies were only of six weeks' and two were of
12 weeks' duration; one study relates to a trial of 48 weeks, but only
for a 16-week period before crossing over. The data for a number of
outcomes could not be extracted. Four of the five included studies
were based on a small number of participants.

The  quality  of  the  evidence  available  was  judged  very  low  to
low,  and  the  following  findings  should  be  interpreted  cautiously.
We  found  no  evidence  relating  to  clinical  response  in  the  short
or  medium  term.  At  the  end  of  six  weeks,  incidence  of  lethargy,
hypersalivation,  dizziness  and  tachycardia  was  lower  at  low-
compared to standard-dose regimes; also side effects as measured
by  the  Treatment  Emergent  Side  Effect  Scale  (TESS)  were  less  at
low compared to standard dose. At six weeks, very low dose was
associated with lower levels of blood glucose one hour post meal
than  standard  dose  and  weight  gain  was  the  least  in  this  group.
At  six  weeks,  standard  dose  was  associated  with  lower  serum
triglycerides, serum total cholesterol and Apo-B than very low dose,
and low-dose recipients had lower serum triglycerides than those
on very low dose. This might suggest that the lipid variation may
not be associated with doses of clozapine in the short term, such as
six weeks' duration, but more trials are needed to validate the side
effects of clozapine long term

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Completeness

We  suggest  that  the  studies  identified  are  insufficient  to  clearly
identify  what  dose  of  clozapine  is  optimal  for  people  suffering
from  schizophrenia  and  schizophreniform  psychosis  to  gain  a
desired  response  to  illness,  attain  remission  and  experience  an
improved  quality  of  life.  Important  information  on  outcomes
relevant  to  clinicians,  consumers  and  policy  makers  (such  as
relapse,  remission,  social  functioning  and  quality  of  life,  service
utilisation, cost-effectiveness, satisfaction with care, and quality of
life) is not currently available.

Applicability

The five studies in our review reported on 14 outcomes and only on
short-term and medium-term durations. We could not identify any
studies which compared high and very high doses of clozapine or
which considered outcomes long term. This can lead to difficulties
in generalising our findings in the management of chronic illness
such as schizophrenia. The evidence appears to be incomplete and
there are various limitations in the applicability of the results from
our review.

Quality of the evidence

The  quality  of  the  evidence  was  poor.  Only  one  of  the  included
studies  was  clearly  described  as  a  double  blind  trial;  the  other
studies were not clear about blinding status. In addition, data were
selectively  reported  in  some  papers,  which  raises  the  possibility
of bias. The quality of the evidence was also limited by the small

number  of  participants  reported  on  by  Simpson  1999  (n  =  31),
Chen  2013  (n  =  90),  Sheng  1990  (n  =  51)  and  Liu  2005  (n  =  59).
It  is  also  of  concern  that  two  trials  were  conducted  only  for  six
weeks. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness and medications such as
clozapine would need to be prescribed for a longer period of time
so that these results may not generalise in the longer term. More
good-quality  trials  are  therefore  needed  to  allow  findings  to  be
substantiated and firm conclusions to be drawn.

Potential biases in the review process

lower at lower doses. We were unable to identify any trials on high
and very high doses of clozapine.

3. For managers or policy makers

More  studies  are  needed  to  replicate  and  validate  findings  so
far,  and  to  ascertain  effects  on  outcomes  such  as  relapse,
remission,  social  functioning,  quality  of  life,  service  utilisation,
cost-effectiveness,  satisfaction  with  care,  quality  of  life.  There  is
a  particular  lack  of  medium-  or  long-term  outcome  data  and  on
above-standard dosing regimes.

We  are  not  aware  of  any  flaws  in  our  review  process.  The  search
for trials was thorough and the review authors followed the criteria
prespecified in the protocol. It is always possible, however, that we
could have failed to identify relevant studies.

Implications for research

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

To  our  knowledge  there  has  been  no  other  systematic  review  or
meta-analysis comparing different doses of clozapine.

Implications for practice

1. For people with schizophrenia

We found no evidence relating dose to clinical response in the short
or  medium  term.  A  standard  dose  (301  mg/day  to  600  mg/day)
helps  in  improvement  of  illness  but  causes  more  adverse  effects
than  lower  doses.  Evidence  from  our  review  indicates  that  the
very low dose of clozapine (< 150 mg/day) is associated with least
side effects. Evidence supports that the low dose (150 mg/day to
300 mg/day) could be the optimal dose to see a clinical response
with fewest side effects. Standard dose appears to be associated
with  more  side  effects  than  the  other  two  groups  which  might
necessitate  close  monitoring  of  weight,  lipid  profile  and  glucose.
We could not reach a conclusion on high dose and very high dose
of clozapine. Hence, in practice, every patient needs to be titrated
on  the  most  appropriate  dose  of  clozapine  necessary  to  gain  a
response, guided by close monitoring for emergence of side effects.

2. For clinicians

Based  on  effects  on  mental  state,  we  found  no  evidence  on  the
optimal dosing of clozapine. Careful consideration has to be given
to balancing the advantages and disadvantages of different dosing
schemes, in particular in relation to side effects which seem to be

the  CONSORT  statement  had  been
anticipated by the trialists (Moher 2001). Allocation concealment is
essential for the result of a trial to be considered valid and gives
the  assurance  that  selection  bias  is  kept  to  the  minimum.  Well-
described and tested blinding could have encouraged confidence
in  the  control  of  performance  and  detection  bias.  It  is  also
important to know how many, and from which groups, people were
withdrawn in order to evaluate exclusion bias. It would also have
been  helpful  if  authors  had  presented  data  in  a  useful  manner
which reflects association between intervention and outcome, for
example relative risk, odds ratio, risk or mean differences, as well as
raw numbers. Binary outcomes should be calculated in preference
to continuous results, as they are easier to interpret. If P values are
used, the exact value should be reported.

2. Specific

2.1 Reviews

Inspection  of  the  table  of  excluded  studies  does  not  suggest  any
particular need for additional review topics in relation to clozapine
dose  since  data  from  any  new  eligible  report  will  be  included  in
updates of this review.

A  number  of  the  excluded  studies  examined  adverse  effects  of
clozapine  at  differing  dose  regimes,  but  could  not  be  included
because  they  reported  results  by  serum  clozapine  level  and  not
by  clozapine  dose.  There  may  therefore  be  value  in  additionally
reviewing those studies that focus on serum clozapine levels under
a separate or modified protocol.

Clozapine is usually reserved for people suffering from treatment-
resistant  illnesses.  In  spite  of  clozapine  being  in  use  for  a  very
long time, there are still insufficient trials to clearly evidence which
dose of clozapine is optimal for people suffering from schizophrenia
and schizophreniform psychosis, to gain response to illness, attain
remission and improve quality of life.

Simpson 1999 

Methods

Participants

Allocation: implied randomisation trial, no details on method of allocation.
Blindness: double-blind, assessors blind to clozapine doses.
Duration: 16 weeks (first phase before cross over lasted 16 weeks; total of three phases lasting 48
weeks).
Setting: Research ward, State Hospital Clinical Research Centre, USA.

Diagnosis: treatment refractory schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-III-R).
N = 48 (number who completed first 16 weeks before any cross-over).
Age: 35 to 54 years.
Sex: M 22, F 28.
Racial origin: Caucasian 43, African American 7.

Consent: signed informed consent.
History: average length of illness: mean 25.1 years (range 1 to 38 years), median of five psychiatric hos-
pitalizations (range 1 to 25); patients had not shown satisfactory clinical response to treatment with at
least three antipsychotic drugs (each given for at least six weeks in doses equivalent to 1000 mg/day of
chlorpromazine).

Interventions

1. Clozapine: dose 100 mg/day. N = 14.
2. Clozapine: dose 300 mg/day. N = 17.
3. Clozapine: dose 600 mg/day. N = 17.

Outcomes

Mental state: (BPRS-A) total score.

Leaving the study early.

Notes

1. Patients stayed in research centre for four weeks for adaptation (naturalistic baseline with no mod-
ification in their treatment regimen). Before first phase of clozapine treatment, patients underwent a
four-week haloperidol treatment and then a one-week wash out. We contacted the main trialist to ob-
tain missing data on CGI, SANS, responders at 16 weeks, and on which dosage group the four respon-
ders belonged to but we have not received results at the time of writing.

44 out of 48 patients completed the first 16 weeks of the trial; four patients
had their last observation carried forward. If a patient had attained the max-
imum assigned dose for two weeks, his or her data were carried forward for
end-point analysis. However, as clozapine can take more time to exert its ef-
fect, if the patient leaves the study soon after two weeks, the last observation
carried forward might underestimate the efficiency of that particular dose of
clozapine.

This report presents additional results from the Simpson 1999 trial. Patients were allowed to adapt
to new clinical environment for minimum of four weeks, followed by four weeks of haloperidol
treatment and a one-week wash-out period. Participants who were randomised to 300 mg/day or
600 mg/day of clozapine were subsequently categorised as “improvers” or “non-improvers” based
on change in CGI scores, and these groups were compared on demographics, baseline character-
istics and BPRS scores. No information was given, however, on the dosage group to which the im-
provers and non-improvers belonged. We contacted the lead author who agreed to send the miss-
ing data, but at the time of writing this had not been received. If we subsequently receive this data,
we will include it in future versions of this review.

*maximum?dos* or *minimum?dos* or *threshold?dos* in title abstract and index terms of reference)]

This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, hand searches and conference proceedings (see group module).

Searching other resources

1. Reference searching

We searched the reference lists of each included paper, but failed find any new studies.

2. Personal contact

Where possible, we contacted the first author of trials or citations for missing information on unpublished data or trials.Where the first
author's contact was not possible through the Cochrane Schizophrenia group, we attempted to contact the other authors. At the time of
writing, we have not received any of the missing data we requested, though one author indicated he will send the requested information
in future. We have discussed this in detail under relevant sections of results.
