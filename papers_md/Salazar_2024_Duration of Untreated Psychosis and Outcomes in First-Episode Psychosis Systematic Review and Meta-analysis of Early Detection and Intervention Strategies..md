Background:  The role of duration of untreated psychosis 
(DUP) as an early detection and intervention target to im-
prove outcomes for individuals with first-episode psychosis 
is unknown.  Study Design:  PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant 
systematic review to identify studies until February 1, 2023, 
with  an  intervention  and  a  control  group,  reporting  DUP 
in both groups. Random effects meta-analysis to evaluate 
(1) differences in DUP in early detection/intervention serv-
ices vs the control group, (2) the efficacy of early detection 
strategies regarding eight real-world outcomes at baseline 
(service  entry),  and  (3)  the  efficacy  of  early  intervention 
strategies  on  ten  real-world  outcomes  at  follow-up.  We 
conducted  quality  assessment,  heterogeneity,  publication 

bias,  and  meta-regression  analyses 
(PROSPERO: 
CRD42020163640).  Study Results:  From 6229 citations, 
33  intervention  studies  were  retrieved.  The  intervention 
group achieved a small DUP reduction (Hedges’ g = 0.168, 
95%  CI = 0.055–0.283)  vs  the  control  group.  The  early 
detection  group  had  better  functioning  levels  (g = 0.281, 
95%  CI = 0.073–0.488)  at  baseline.  Both  groups  did  not 
differ  regarding  total  psychopathology,  admission  rates, 
quality  of  life,  positive/negative/depressive  symptoms, 
and  employment  rates  (P > .05).  Early  interventions  im-
proved quality of life (g = 0.600, 95% CI = 0.408–0.791), 
employment  rates  (g = 0.427,  95%  CI = 0.135–0.718), 
negative  symptoms  (g = 0.417,  95%  CI = 0.153–0.682),

relapse  rates  (g = 0.364,  95%  CI = 0.117–0.612),  ad-
missions  rates  (g = 0.335,  95%  CI = 0.198–0.468),  total 
psychopathology  (g = 0.298,  95%  CI = 0.014–0.582),  de-
pressive  symptoms  (g = 0.268,  95%  CI = 0.008–0.528), 
and  functioning  (g = 0.180,  95%  CI = 0.065–0.295)  at 
 follow-up but not positive symptoms or remission (P > .05).  
Conclusions:  Comparing interventions targeting DUP and 
control groups, the impact of early detection strategies on 
DUP and other correlates is limited. However, the impact 
of early intervention was significant regarding relevant out-
comes, underscoring the importance of supporting early in-
tervention services worldwide.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating and func-
tionally  limiting  disorders.1,2  To  ameliorate  poor  out-
comes of psychosis during its early clinical stages,3 early 
detection  and  early  intervention  have  the  potential  to 
impact  the  critical  period  before  and  after  the  first  epi-
sode of psychosis (FEP).4,5 Early detection focuses on the 
detection  of  early  signs  and  symptoms  and  is  based  on 
community  awareness6  and  outreach  efforts7  to  reduce 
delays  in  access  to  care,  which  are  currently  prolonged 
until an appropriate intervention is provided.8,9 Strategies 
for early detection include active strategies, such as work-
shops  for  referral  sources,  which  include  healthcare  (ie, 
community mental health or general healthcare services), 
educational,  or  community/governmental  organization 
professionals.10  Additionally,  general  public  awareness 
campaigns,  including  TV  or  radio  appearances,  theater 
advertisements, high school art contests, and sports spon-
sorships, are also potential outreach strategies to support 
early detection. Meanwhile, early intervention focuses on 
the provision of optimal treatments in these early phases 
of  the  psychotic  disorder  and  is  based  on  multidiscipli-
nary teams of mental health professionals for individuals 
with  early-onset  psychosis,  providing  multimodal  psy-
chosocial and psychopharmacological interventions.

Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is usually de-
fined  as  the  period  between  the  onset  of  psychosis  and 
the start of treatment,11 although other definitions have 
been  considered.12,13  DUP  has  been  studied  as  a  prog-
nostic factor in schizophrenia. DUP has been associated 
with  poor  outcomes,  including  poor  functioning.8,14–18 
There is also highly suggestive evidence for a relationship 
between  longer  DUP  and  more  severe  positive  symp-
toms, more severe negative symptoms, and lower chances 
of remission.16 Furthermore, there is suggestive evidence 
for an association between longer DUP and more severe 
global psychopathology.16 It has also been suggested that 
the association between DUP and psychosocial function 
may be an artifact of early detection, creating the illusion 

772

that  early  intervention  is  associated  with  improved  out-
comes.19 Hence, early detection programs may ascertain 
individuals with shorter DUP, less severe symptoms, and 
more individuals with affective psychosis.20

Interventions  to  reduce  DUP  based  on  early  detection 
and early intervention in FEP have been developed4,21 based 
on the hypothesis that prolonged DUP leads to significant 
neurological  and  psychosocial  damage  that  worsens  the 
illness course of psychotic disorders.22 Early Intervention 
services  (EIS)  have  been  implemented  to  reduce  DUP 
with  promising  results.  In  EIS,  multidisciplinary  teams 
of mental health professionals provide multimodal treat-
ment,  including  different  psychosocial  and  psychophar-
macological interventions that are tailored to the needs of 
each patient.4 EIS is often considered the gold standard for 
the treatment of patients with early-phase psychosis.4

A meta-analysis published in this journal, including 16 
studies up to April 2017, evaluated the efficacy of inter-
ventions  to  reduce  DUP,  with  non-significant  modest 
results  (Hedges’  g = 0.12,  P > .05).14  The  frequency  dis-
tributions of DUP are usually skewed, with outliers with 
very  long  DUP.23  Efforts  to  alter  DUP  by  establishing 
early detection and intervention services have the poten-
tial to both detect individuals with FEP earlier and also 
to  detect  and  intervene  in  those  individuals  that  would 
have otherwise remained untreated.24 Thus, the inclusion 
of these patients could offer an unrealistically pessimistic 
picture of the impact of early detection efforts based on 
the alteration of DUP, artificially increasing DUP. Thus, 
other outcomes and correlates targeted by early detection 
and early intervention strategies need to be evaluated be-
sides the reduction of DUP to understand the real-world 
impact of early detection and EIS in FEP. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis 
to evaluate the impact of early detection and intervention 
strategies  on  the  reduction  of  DUP  and  mental  health 
outcomes  in  first-episode  psychosis.  This  study  aimed 
to systematically review the evidence and provide meta-
analytic  data  for  (a)  differences  in  DUP  in  individuals 
in early detection and intervention services vs individuals 
from  the  control  group,  (b)  the  efficacy  of  early  detec-
tion strategies regarding real-world correlates at baseline 
(service  entry),  and  (c)  the  efficacy  of  early  intervention 
strategies on real-world outcomes at follow-up.

METHODS

This  systematic  review  was  conducted  according  to 
the  PRISMA  2020,  (Supplementary  table  1)25  and  the 
MOOSE checklists (Supplementary table 2),26 following 
the EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines.27

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

A  systematic  search  was  used  to  identify  relevant  arti-
cles,  and  three  qualified  psychiatrists  (GSP,  AA,  CAy) 

independently implemented a two-step literature search, 
looking at the titles and abstracts first, and the full text 
of the articles in a second step. The following terms were 
applied:  (“first  episode  psych*”  OR  “FEP”  OR  “early-
onset  psychosis”  OR  “DUP”  OR  “duration  untreated 
psych*”) AND (“reduc*” OR “decreas*” OR “early” OR 
“early intervention” OR “early detection” OR “service”). 
Researchers conducted the electronic search in PubMed 
and Web of Science database, incorporating the Web of 
Science Collection, BIOSIS Citation Index, KCI-Korean 
Journal,  MEDLINE,  Russian  Science  Citation  Index, 
SciELO Citation Index, and Ovid/Psych databases from 
inception until February 01, 2023, without language re-
strictions.  Second,  we  manually  reviewed  all  references 
from  the  selected  articles  and  extracted  relevant  addi-
tional  articles.  Articles  identified  were  screened  as  ab-
stracts,  and  after  the  exclusion  of  those  which  did  not 
meet our inclusion criteria, the full texts of the remaining 
articles  were  assessed  for  eligibility,  and  decisions  were 
made regarding their inclusion in the review.

The following inclusion criteria were used to select the 
articles: (a) individual studies, including conference pro-
ceedings; (b) conducted in individuals with FEP; (c) with 
both an intervention and a control group (including no in-
tervention or historic control or alternative later interven-
tion/treatment as usual—TAU—); (d) evaluating DUP in 
both  groups  as  an  outcome  measure  or  a  mediator  (as 
mean ± SD  or  median)  (definitions  in  Supplementary 
table 3); (e) reporting the impact of early detection or in-
tervention  in  ≥1  relevant  outcome  for  both  groups;  and 
(f) published in any language. Exclusion criteria were: (a) 
reviews, clinical cases, and protocols; (b) studies not re-
porting DUP in both groups; (c) studies without an inde-
pendent control group; and (d) studies not reporting any 
outcome of interest. For the meta-analysis, additional in-
clusion criteria were: (a) full reporting of the correlates or 
outcomes of interest (ie, mean ± SD or %, see below) in 
both groups and (b) non-overlapping samples as defined 
by the study program and recruitment period.

Outcome Measures and Data Extraction

Three  qualified  psychiatrists  (AA,  EMB,  JSV),  inde-
pendently  carried  out  data  extraction,  which  was  cross-
checked by another author (GSP). The variables extracted 
included:  author,  year,  program,  country,  sample  size, 
mean age, % males, DUP, % affective psychosis, control 
characteristics, main correlates/outcomes (positive symp-
toms, negative symptoms, total psychopathology, depres-
sive  symptoms,  quality  of  life,  functioning,  remission, 
relapse,  employment,  hospitalization)  at  baseline  and 
longitudinally at the end of the study, quality assessment 
(see below), and key findings including other outcomes. 
DUP, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, total psy-
chopathology,  depressive  symptoms,  quality  of  life, 
and  functioning  were  evaluated  using  continuous  data 

Duration of Untreated Psychosis

(mean ± SD) in both groups. For the intervention strat-
egies section, the results from baseline to the end of the 
study  were  evaluated.  Remission,  relapse,  employment, 
and admissions rates were evaluated categorically (%) in 
both groups, at baseline and follow-up, respectively.

Strategy for Data Synthesis

For  the  systematic  review,  we  provided  a  narrative  syn-
thesis of the findings, structured around core outcomes and 
themes,  excluding  findings  estimated  meta-analytically, 
which were not repeated or expanded in this section. For 
the  meta-analyses,  the  outcome  measure  was  estimated 
when ≥3 studies were available by calculating the Hedges’ 
g  for  all  correlates/outcomes  to  favor  comparability. 
Notably, the meta-analysis of DUP and the meta-analytic 
correlates of early detection strategies are cross-sectional, 
while the analyses of meta-analytic outcomes of early in-
tervention strategies are longitudinal and consider changes 
from  baseline  to  follow-up,  thus  allowing  the  evaluation 
of  changes  on  different  scales  for  the  same  outcomes. 
Since  high  heterogeneity  was  expected,  random  effects 
meta-analyses were conducted.28 The presence of publica-
tion bias was assessed by Egger’s test,29 complemented by 
the “trim and fill” method to correct for the presence of 
missing studies when a risk of publication bias (ie, small 
sample  bias)  was  detected.  Heterogeneity  among  study 
point estimates was assessed using Q statistics. The propor-
tion of the total variability in the effect size estimates was 
evaluated  with  the  I2  index30  and  considered  statistically 
significant when P < .05. I2 > 50% is typically considered 
an indication of high variability in the effect size estimates. 
We conducted sub-analyses and meta-regression analyses 
for our three main research questions whenever ≥4 studies 
were available, including ≥2 studies per category in the cat-
egorical  correlates/outcomes,  to  estimate  the  association 
between  the  efficacy  of  the  intervention  on  each  of  the 
correlates/outcomes  and  (1)  program  continent  (Europe 
vs America vs Australasia), (2) FEP diagnosis (% affective 
psychosis), (3) control content (TAU vs no intervention vs 
historic control), (4) mean age, (5) sex (% males), (6) DUP, 
(7) duration of the intervention—only for the intervention 
outcomes—, and (8) study quality (weak vs moderate vs 
strong). Further harmonization was not required for any 
of the outcomes as they were not dependent on different 
scales.  We  carried  out  “leave  one  out”  analyses  for  the 
meta-analysis on differences in DUP in individuals in early 
detection and intervention services vs individuals from the 
control group. All P values reported in the meta-analyses 
were  two-sided,  with  alpha = .05.  Comprehensive  Meta-
analysis (CMA) V331 was used to perform the analyses.

Risk of Bias (Quality) Assessment

The study quality was assessed using the “Effective Public 
Health  Practice  Project”  (EPHPP),32,33  as  most  studies 

773

G. Salazar de Pablo et al

were expected not to be randomized. The following items 
were evaluated as good, fair, or poor: (a) selection bias, (b) 
design,  (c)  confounders,  (d)  blinding,  (e)  data  collection, 
and  (f)  dropouts.  The  overall  quality  was  rated  in  three 
categories: weak, moderate, or strong. Studies were evalu-
ated as strong when none of the items was rated as poor; 
moderate  if  one  item  was  rated  as  poor;  and  weak  if  ≥2 
a–f items were evaluated as poor. After discussion with the 
corresponding author, 100% discrepancies were resolved.

Results

The  literature  search  yielded  6229  citations,  which  were 
screened  for  eligibility,  and  33  articles  were  finally  in-
cluded  in  the  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis 
(figure 1). The database included 9093 individuals: 5288 
in the intervention group and 3805 in the control group. 

The  total  sample  size  (including  both  intervention  and 
control groups) of the included studies ranged from 6534 
to 123435 individuals (Supplementary table 4). The mean 
age  of  the  sample  ranged  from  21.235,36  to  31.137  years. 
The proportion of males ranged from 45.3%38 to 81.5%.39

Meta-analysis of DUP

Altogether,  14  cohorts  from  12  different  EIS  (n = 2938) 
provided meta-analytic data to compare DUP in an inter-
vention (n = 1616) vs a control group (n = 1312). We found 
that the early detection/intervention group reduced DUP 
(g = 0.168,  95%  CI = 0.055–0.283)  compared  to  the  con-
trol group, with a small effect size (figure 2). Heterogeneity 
was  significant  among  the  services  (Q = 29.109  P = .006 
I = 55.34%).  Publication  bias  was  not  detected  (Egger’s 
test = 1.83, P = .309). In “leave one out” analyses, the sta-
tistical  significance  did  not  change  in  any  scenario:  the

maximum  ES  was  when  LEO  was  removed  (g = 0.197, 
95%  CI = 0.087–0.306),  and  the  minimum  ES  was  when 
OASIS was removed (g = 0.142, 95% CI = 0.033–0.267).

Meta-analytic Results of Early Detection Strategies

Studies  reported  (in  descending  order  of  frequency)  on 
negative symptoms (k = 10, n = 2255), positive symptoms 
(k = 8, n = 1637), functioning (k = 8, n = 2192), total psy-
chopathology (k = 7, n = 1934), employment rates (k = 7, 
n = 2554),  quality  of  life  (k = 4,  n = 1002),  depressive 
symptoms  (k = 3,  n = 610),  and  admission  rates  (k = 3, 
n = 754) (table 1, figure 3).

Compared to individuals in the control group, individ-
uals  in  the  early  detection  group  had  better  functioning 
levels  (g = 0.281,  95%  CI = 0.073–0.488)  at  baseline. 
Total  psychopathology  (g = 0.186,  95%  CI = −0.173 
to  0.546),  admission  rates  (g = 0.179,  95%  CI = −0.146 
to 0.504), quality of life (g = 0.154, 95% CI = −0.217 to 
0.525), positive symptoms (g = 0.078, 95% CI = −0.126 to 
0.283), negative symptoms (g = 0.078, 95% CI = −0.064 
to 0.219), employment rates (g = 0.025, 95% CI = −0.124 
to  0.173),  and  depressive  symptoms  (g = 0.003,  95% 
CI = −0.157 to 0.162), did not differ between both groups 
(table 1, figure 3) (forest plots available in Supplementary 
figure 1).

ment rates (k = 3, n = 259) (table 1, figure 4). Compared 
to  the  control  group,  early  intervention  improved  out-
comes longitudinally including quality of life (g = 0.600, 
95%  CI = 0.408–0.791),  increased  employment  rates 
(g = 0.423,  95%  CI = 0.134–0.712),

Other Non-meta-analytic Outcomes of Early Detection 
and Intervention Strategies

After implementing early detection strategies, differences 
were found in the referral patterns,20,40 although not con-
sistently.41 Police referrals decreased by 15.2% (χ2 = 10.5, 
P = .001),40  while  self  and  family  referrals  increased  by 
10.7%  (χ2 = 3.5,  P = .04)40  in  the  early  detection  group. 
Individuals  with  FEP  in  the  early  detection  group  were 
more  likely  to  get  clinical  care  without  previous  mental 
health  services  contact  (P = .003).6  Furthermore,  early 
detection services had relatively more patients with affec-
tive psychosis (χ2 = 4.011, P = .028),20 and low socioeco-
nomic status (χ2 = 8.659, P = .003),20 whereas premorbid 
functioning did not differ between the early detection and 
the control group.42

Regarding early intervention strategies, some studies 
did  not  find  significant  group  differences  in  help-
seeking  attempts,43  while  others  found  advantages 
for  the  intervention  vs  the  control  group  regarding 
decreased  delay  in  help-seeking  (P = .01) 44  and  in

compared  to  the  control  group,  individuals  with  FEP 
in the early intervention group had more friends after 1 
year  of   care  (P = .02), 45  greater  improvements  in  cog-
nitive symptoms (P < .001), 46 and perceived autonomy 
(P < .01) 47  after  2  years,  and  were  less  likely  to  live  in 
supported housing after 5 years (P = .02). 48 Compared 
to  the  control  group,  individuals  with  FEP  in  the  in-
tervention  group  had  lower  admission  rates  and  days 
hospitalized48,49 (although not consistently50), and were 
less  frequently  admitted  under  the  Mental  Health 
Act50 or in locked units51 (all P < .05). However, no in-
tervention  vs  control  group  differences  were  found  in 
the rates of  police involvement and use of  seclusion.51 
Individuals  in  the  early  intervention  vs  control  group 
had fewer suicide attempts49 and death by suicide35,49,52 
(all  P < .05),  lower  rates  of   antipsychotics40,53  (partic-
ularly  first-generation  antipsychotics37)  and  at  lower 
dose,40  with  lower  maximum  initial  dosages,54  as  well 
as lower rates of  benzodiazepines40 and anticholinergic 
medications.40  Satisfaction  with  care  was  high  in  the 
intervention  group  (3.9/5  for  patients  and  4/5  for  re-
latives).53  However,  family  satisfaction,  after  adjusting 
for  baseline  characteristics,  was  not  higher  anymore 
in  the  intervention  vs  the  control  group  in  one  of   the 
included  studies.55  In  the  early  intervention  vs  control 

group,  adherence  to  comprehensive  community  care 
was  higher,56  dropout  rates  lower,55  and  mental  health 
service costs were lower 8 years after the early interven-
tion ended (P = .01). 34 A summary of  the potential ad-
ditional benefits detected in our systematic review can

Heterogeneity, Publication Bias, and Meta-regression 
Analyses

Heterogeneity  across  the  included  studies  was  statisti-
cally  significant  in  5/8  correlates  in  the  early  detection 
group, ranging from 56.6% to 87.9% in those correlates. 
Meanwhile,  heterogeneity  was  statistically  significant  in 
4/10  outcomes  in  the  intervention  group,  ranging  from 
69.3% to 90.5% in those outcomes. Publication bias was 
not detected in any of the correlates at the time of service 
contact  in  the  early  detection  strategies.  Heterogeneity 
was detected in two of the early intervention strategy out-
comes, ie, admissions rates (P = .036) and remission rates 
(P = .003).

Regarding  admission  rates,  funnel  plot  inspection 
revealed  asymmetry  to  the  right.  Due  to  the  lack  of 
small  sample  bias,  we  did  not  adjust  results  with  the 
trim-and-fill  method,  and  the  original  value  was  main-
tained. Regarding remission rates, funnel plot inspection 

777

G. Salazar de Pablo et al

revealed  asymmetry  to  the  left.  Small  effect  bias  was 
thus corrected with the trim-and-fill method, decreasing 
the  effect  size  from  g = 0.306  (CI = −0.066  to  0.677)  to 
g = 0.180 (95% CI = −0.193 to 0.552) (funnel plots avail-
able in Supplementary figures 3 and 4).

In meta-regression analyses of DUP, none of the vari-
ables  evaluated  was  statistically  significant  (all  P > .05). 
In  meta-regression  analyses  of  early  detection  correl-
ates, greater efficacy of early detection strategies for the 
total  psychopathology  outcome  was  associated  with 
a  higher  mean  age  (β = .124,  P = .020),  and  a  lower  % 
of  males  (β = −.035,  P = .024).  Greater  efficacy  of  the 
interventions  for  quality  of  life  was  associated  with  a 
higher  proportion  of  individuals  with  affective  psy-
chosis  (β = 5.599,  P = .011),  while  greater  efficacy  for 
functioning  was  associated  with  a  higher  mean  age 
(β = 0.061,  P = .029).  There  was  no  significant  associ-
ation  between  other  evaluated  moderating  factors  in-
cluding  DUP,  continent,  control  content,  and  quality 
of  the  studies  with  other  early  detection  correlates  (all 
P > .05)  (Supplementary  table  5).  For  early  intervention 
outcomes, a stronger decrease in the DUP was associated 
with  a  greater  improvement  in  the  intervention  vs  con-
trol group in quality of life (β = .025, P = .023) but not 
the severity of positive symptoms (β = −.067, P = .431), 
negative symptoms (β = .053, P = .151), overall psycho-
pathology  (β = .0044,  P = .802),  functioning  (β = .005, 
P = .530),  remission  (β = .040,  P = .178),  or  number  of 
subsequent  admissions  (β = −.014,  P = .234).  A  higher 
%  of  males  (β = .080,  P = .014)  was  associated  with  a 
greater improvement in remission rates. There was no sig-
nificant association between other evaluated moderating 
factors with other early intervention outcomes including 
% affective psychosis, control content, age, or quality of 
the study (all P > .05) (Supplementary table 6).

Quality Assessment

The  quality  of  the  included  studies  ranged  from  weak 
(k = 16,  48.5%)  to  strong  (k = 3,  9.1%).  The  item  most 
frequently reported as good was data collection (k = 29, 
87.9%); The item most frequently reported as poor was 
blinding (k = 29, 87.9%) (Supplementary figure 6).

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic 
review and meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the 
role of DUP as a treatment target and moderator of early 
detection and intervention strategies for first-episode psy-
chosis. We aimed to look at the impact of early detection 
and intervention strategies on both DUP and related real-
world outcomes. We described the results from 33 studies 
narratively  and  performed  different  meta-analyses  with 
some  of  the  most  clinically  relevant  and  most  reported 
outcomes. We found that the intervention group reduced 

778

DUP  (g = 0.168)  compared  to  the  control  group.  While 
from  the  evaluated  variables,  the  early  detection  group 
only  had  better  functioning  levels  (g = 0.281)  at  service 
engagement/baseline  than  the  control  group,  the  early 
intervention  group  was  able  to  improve  8/10  outcomes: 
quality of life (g = 0.600), employment rates (g = 0.423), 
negative symptoms (g = 0.417), relapse rates (g = 0.364), 
admission  rates  (g = 0.335),  total  psychopathology 
(g = 0.298),  depressive  symptoms  (g = 0.268),  and  func-
tioning levels (g = 0.180) compared to the control group.
We  evaluated  the  role  of  DUP  as  a  determinant  of 
mental  health  for  individuals  with  FEP.  We  found  that 
the  early  detection/intervention  group  reduced  DUP 
compared to the control group, with a small effect size. 
Our updated results are somewhat more promising than 
those  from  a  previous  meta-analysis  reporting  changes 
in DUP,14 which found similar effect sizes (g = 0.12), but 
did not detect significant differences between the groups 
(P > .05).  However,  these  two  meta-analyses  both  sug-
gest that the current impact of early detection strategies 
on DUP is limited. We believe that there are some indi-
viduals  with  very  long  DUP,23  that  can  only  reach  care 
with  intensive  efforts  from  professionals,  which  may  be 
a  limiting  factor  that  prevents  early  detection  strategies 
from  having  a  greater  impact  on  DUP.  In  fact,  one  of 
the  included  studies  found  that  while  only  3.4%  of  the 
individuals in the control group had very long (>3 years) 
DUP,  this  number  reached  15.0%  in  the  intervention 
group  (P = .005).24  However,  we  cannot  rule  out  that 
some  of  the  strategies  may  have  simply  failed  in  their 
attempt to reduce DUP in individuals with FEP. In any 
case, evaluating the impact of the efforts to reduce DUP 
on  mental  health  outcomes  in  first-episode  psychosis 
through early detection and intervention strategies is an 
important  indication  of  their  real-world  effectiveness. 
Our  results  support  the  implementation  of  EIS  aiming 
to shorten DUP with both an early detection and inter-
vention component,57 even if the impact on DUP seems 
limited.  It  is  also  possible  that  robust,  comprehensive 
treatments in FEP improve outcomes regardless of DUP 
changes. Our superior results of early intervention strat-
egies (improving 8/10 outcomes) compared to early detec-
tion strategies would support this hypothesis.

Early detection strategies resulted in better functioning 
levels at baseline compared to individuals in the control 
group. However, the groups did not differ regarding total 
psychopathology,  admission  rates,  quality  of  life,  posi-
tive  symptoms,  negative  symptoms,  employment  rates, 
and depressive symptoms. One hypothesis would be that 
early detection may result in individuals entering services 
prior  to  more  severe  functional  deterioration.  However, 
although functioning is critical in psychosis and schizo-
phrenia,58 it seems that current detection strategies fail to 
detect individuals with FEP before more relevant symp-
toms  and  other  poor  outcomes  develop.  As  discussed 
above,  it  is  possible  that  the  detection  of  more  severely 

affected individuals that otherwise would have remained 
without  treatment  may  have  played  a  significant  role. 
However, it is also possible and desirable to refine actual 
detection strategies. For instance, it seems that informa-
tion  campaigns,59  especially  if  they  are  multi-focus60  in 
nature, can optimize detection strategies. Other strategies, 
like targeted health education to reduce DUP by helping 
to better identify signs of mental illness, have also shown 
promising results,61 since ongoing training correlated with 
a  DUP  reduction.61  Barriers  to  early  detection  include 
difficulties in detecting signs of early psychosis,6 worries 
about  stigma  or  coercive  treatment,6  and  family  diffi-
culties  in  judging  the  disease  appropriately.62  Moreover, 
developing  local  networking  activities  targeting  profes-
sionals  in the education and primary healthcare  sectors 
may help improve pathways to care.63 A longer DUP has 
been  associated  with  family  members  blaming  puberty 
or  ideology  for  the  psychosis  rather  than  considering  a 
mental health problem.62 This highlights the importance 
of outreach strategies and information campaigns in the 
community.  Regarding  the  best  detection  strategies  to 
reduce DUP and improve detection correlates, EIS typi-
cally provides treatment and support for both individuals 
experiencing  psychosis  and  individuals  who  are  at  high 
risk  of  developing  psychosis.64  Establishing  standalone 
services  for  Clinical  High  Risk  for  Psychosis  (CHR-P) 
with both an early detection and early detection compo-
nent seems to be the most effective method for reducing 
DUP,14 although the amount of available evidence is lim-
ited. Detection65 of individuals at CHR-P and early inter-
ventions66 directed towards the prevention of psychosis,67 
have the potential to maximize the benefits of early inter-
ventions in psychosis,3,4 favoring an earlier detection and 
potentially a reduction in the DUP.

In our meta-analysis, compared to the control group, 
early  interventions  improved  most  clinical  outcomes. 
Previous evidence suggests that EIS, even when these do 
not have a specific early detection component, can reduce 
DUP.68  Our  results  align  with  a  previous  meta-analysis 
that  found  that  EIS  was  superior  to  treatment  as  usual 
regarding  each  of  the  15  meta-analysed  outcomes.4 
Although  we  did  not  limit  the  included  studies  to  ran-
domized  interventions,4  apart  from  to  those  reporting 
DUP,  our  effect  sizes  were  similar  (small  to  medium). 
This finding suggests that the provision of early psycho-
social and psychopharmacological interventions is clearly 
beneficial  for  individuals  with  FEP,  possibly  regardless 
of  DUP.  Interestingly,  although  previous  evidence  sug-
gests  that  a  delayed  start  of  antipsychotic  medication 
could lead to an increased manifestation and severity of 
positive symptoms in the long term,69 the early interven-
tion did not have a significant impact on positive symp-
toms, according to our results. We found that rates and 
doses of antipsychotics may be lower in the early inter-
vention  group,40,53,54  probably  in  an  attempt  to  minimize 
side effects.70–72 The effect of this lower antipsychotic rate 

Duration of Untreated Psychosis

remains  unknown,  but  recently  several  meta-analyses 
have  shown  that  lower  than  therapeutic  antipsychotic 
doses  or  dose  reduction  during  maintenance  treatment 
are associated with a higher risk of relapse and hospital-
ization.73–77 In contrast, the number of studies evaluating 
remission  rates  was  low  (k = 4),  limiting  our  power  for 
this analysis, and the confidence intervals for the remis-
sion rates also crossed the null hypothesis line.

In  the  systematic  review,  other  potential  benefits  of 
early detection and early intervention strategies for other 
outcomes  are  suggested,  although  due  to  limited  data, 
this  was  not  accompanied  by  meta-analytical  evidence. 
Among  these  outcomes,  a  decrease  in  potentially  trau-
matic  experiences,  such  as  police  referrals,40  admissions 
in locked units,51 or admissions under the Mental Health 
Act,50 could be beneficial, as childhood and adult adversi-
ties have shown to be associated with increased psychotic 
symptoms  in  individuals  with  psychotic  disorders,78 
and  increased  risk  of  developing  psychosis.79,80  Among 
the  evaluated  outcomes,  the  benefits  of  EIS  on  suicide 
rates35,49,52  and  on  service  users’  satisfaction,53  pivotal  to 
favor  engagement  and  decrease  dropout  rates,  are  no-
table.  Finally,  from  a  management,  resource  allocation, 
and  funding  perspective,4  it  is  relevant  that  the  costs  of 
EIS seem to be lower than the control group costs,34 par-
ticularly due to lower inpatient costs.81

According to our results, early detection strategies were 
more  effective  in  older  female  individuals  for  total  psy-
chopathology, in individuals with affective psychosis for 
quality  of  life,  and  in  older  individuals  for  functioning. 
Meanwhile, early intervention strategies were more effec-
tive  in  individuals  with  a  more  pronounced  decrease  in 
DUP  for  quality  of  life  and  in  older  individuals  for  re-
mission rates. These findings suggest that some interven-
tions may improve some particular outcomes more easily 
in individuals with certain characteristics, while in others, 
achieving this benefit may be more challenging. Precision 
or personalized medicine considers individual variability 
when establishing, targeting, and delivering an interven-
tion.82,83 Therefore, the need to stratify interventions ac-
cording to individual characteristics has been suggested 
to improve outcomes.84,85 In fact, in early intervention for 
psychosis, individual characteristics may help detect pa-
tient subgroups requiring an adaptation in the duration 
of the interventions or in its specific content or may sug-
gest the need for higher-intensity interventions.4 The im-
plementation  of  EIS  varies  significantly  worldwide.  For 
instance,  there  is  almost  complete  nationwide  EIS  cov-
erage  in  Denmark  and  England,  while  almost  no  serv-
ices are available in many other European countries and 
low-income  countries.  It  has  been  suggested  that  these 
differences  are  likely  due  to  local  traditions  rather  than 
science.57

The  current  study  has  several  limitations.  First,  the 
number  of  available  studies  was  limited,  especially  for 
depressive  symptoms  and  admission  rates  in  the  early 

779

G. Salazar de Pablo et al

detection  correlates,  and  for  depressive  symptoms,  re-
lapse  rates,  and  employment  rates  for  early  intervention 
outcomes. Other outcomes (eg, police involvement) were 
not  meta-analysed  due  to  lack  of  data  but  included  in 
the systematic review. However, the database was exten-
sive  and  sufficiently  powered  to  evaluate  a  broad  range 
of correlates/outcomes. Second, some of the studies had 
a suboptimal design, including the use of historical con-
trol  groups  due  to  ethical  and  implementation  reasons. 
Consequently,  48.5%  of  the  studies  had  a  weak  study 
quality, according to the EPHPP. Particularly, for 87.9% 
of the included studies, there was no blinding, or this fea-
ture  was  not  reported.  We  conducted  meta-regression 
analyses for both the quality of the studies and the con-
trol  content  and  did  not  find  any  association  between 
these  factors  and  evaluated  correlates/outcomes.  Third, 
we  only  meta-analysed  studies  in  which  DUP  for  both 
groups  was  provided  as  mean ± SD,  as  we  were  not 
able  to  pool  median  DUP  following  expert  statistical 
advice.  Studies  using  median  DUP  were  included  for 
meta-analytic  results  of  early  detection  strategies  and 
meta-analytic  outcomes  of  early  intervention  strategies. 
However,  this  approach  has  allowed  us  to  obtain  more 
homogeneous  and  comparable  measures.  Fourth,  heter-
ogeneity  was  significant  for  DUP  and  other  outcomes, 
as detailed in the manuscript. Different factors may have 
influenced the observed heterogeneity, including the set-
ting where the intervention was conducted, and the du-
ration of the intervention. Nevertheless, heterogeneity is 
common in real-world scenarios, possibly being reflective 
of  our  having  captured  an  authentic  picture.  Fifth,  we 
could not determine for how long it would be appropriate 
for the interventions to be provided or their differential 
efficacy for discrete time periods. However, the duration 
of the intervention did not have a significant impact on 
any  of  the  outcomes  according  to  the  meta-regression 
analyses.  Sixth,  we  evaluated  nineteen  outcomes,  but 
we  did  not  apply  the  multiple-testing  correction.  Note, 
as  per  the  Cochrane  Handbook,  that  one  in  20  inde-
pendent statistical tests will be statistically significant at 
a  5%  significance  level.86  Seventh,  due  to  heterogeneity 
and  the  limited  number  of  included  studies,  we  could 
not  report  on  the  outcomes  of  specific  detection  or  in-
tervention strategies. Furthermore, all the studies evalua-
tion early intervention outcomes contain early detection 
components aiming to reduce DUP. Finally, the thresh-
olds  regarding  DUP  varied,  and  we  could  not  establish 
the target or minimum reduction of DUP, which would 
have  a  specific  or  threshold  impact  on  mental  health 
outcomes.  The  definitions  of  DUP  were  also  different. 
Notably, defining and reporting DUP presents reliability 
challenges  due  to  the  presence  of  different  levels  of  in-
sight in patients, blurry borders between attenuated and 
full  psychosis  symptoms,  and  different  levels  of  acuity 
and severity during the onset of symptoms. However, a 
meta-analysis of 369 studies found no differences in DUP 

780

values according to the definition.87 We conducted addi-
tional meta-regression analyses to evaluate any associa-
tion between the analysed outcomes and various factors, 
including  the  continent  where  the  intervention  was  car-
ried out, % of study participants with affective psychosis, 
control content, mean participant age, % of males, DUP, 
and duration of the intervention.

Conclusion

When  comparing  strategies  targeting  DUP  and  control 
groups, the impact of early detection strategies on DUP 
and  other  outcomes  is  limited.  However,  the  impact  of 
early  intervention  on  the  outcomes  evaluated,  including 
quality  of  life,  employment,  and  relapse  rates,  is  signif-
icant.  Our  results  support  the  implementation  of  EIS 
with both an early detection and intervention component 
using  robust  and  comprehensive  treatments,  even  if  the 
impact on DUP is limited. Further research into specific 
early  detection  and  intervention  components  using  cul-
turally sensitive approaches is required.
