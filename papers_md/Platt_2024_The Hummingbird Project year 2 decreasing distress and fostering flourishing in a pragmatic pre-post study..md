Multi-component  Positive  Psychology  Interventions  (mPPIs)  in  secondary 
schools have been shown to improve mental health outcomes for young people. 
The Hummingbird Project mPPI is a six-week program of workshops designed 
to introduce a variety of positive psychology (PP) concepts to secondary school-
aged children in schools to improve well-being, resilience, and hope. The effects 
on mental distress, however, were not explored. The current study, therefore, 
was  designed  to  replicate  the  effects  of  the  Hummingbird  Project  mPPI  on 
positive mental health and to also explore the effects on symptoms of mental 
distress. Secondary school-aged children (N =  614; mean age  =  11.46  years) from 
a sample of secondary schools located across the North West of England (N =  7) 
participated in the study; the majority of children were in Year 7 (94%). The PP 
concepts explored included happiness, hope, resilience, mindfulness, character 
strengths,  growth  mindset,  and  gratitude.  The  results  showed  significant 
improvements  associated  with  the  mPPI  in  well-being  (as  measured  by  the 
World Health Organization Well-Being Index; WHO-5), hope (as measured by 
the Children’s Hope Scale; CHS), and symptoms of mental distress (as measured 
by the Young Person’s Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation; YP-CORE) from 
pre-  to  post-intervention.  While  acknowledging  the  limits  due  to  pragmatic 
concerns  regarding  the  implementation  of  a  control  group,  the  effectiveness 
of  the  Hummingbird  Project  mPPI  on  well-being  was  replicated  alongside 
reducing  the  symptoms  of  mental  distress.  Future  evaluation,  however,  will 
need  to  implement  more  robust  designs  and  consider  follow-up  duration  to 
assess the longer-term effects of the Hummingbird Project mPPI.

Introduction

Mental  health  is  associated  with  improvements  in  educational  attainment,  greater 
productivity, reductions in mortality, increases in social interaction and engagement, reduced 
risk of both suicide and mental illness, reduced likelihood of risk-taking, and increased levels 
of resilience (Campion et al., 2012). Indeed, mental health is on a spectrum, distinguishing

those who flourish and live a good life and function well at the positive 
extreme, from those who languish, have low levels of satisfaction and 
may be living a life without purpose, meaning and fulfillment, etc., at 
the negative extreme (Keyes and Haidt, 2010). Mental illness is the 
second largest source of burden of disease in England. Mental illnesses 
are also more common, long-lasting, and impactful than other health 
conditions (Public Health England, 2019). Notably, 50% of lifetime 
mental illness starts by age 14 and 75% by the mid-20s (Kessler et al., 
2007).  In  the  United  Kingdom  (UK),  13.6%  of  children  aged 
11–16 years  can  have  a  mental  health  disorder  at  any  one  time 
(RCPCH, 2020).

The effects of mental illness in younger life can also be long-
lasting. A longitudinal study involving 17,634 children in England, 
Scotland, and Wales showed an association between psychological 
problems  in  childhood  and  employability  in  later  life  (Goodman 
et  al.,  2011).  The  Children’s  Society  (2020)  also  showed  that,  at 
15 years of age, children in the UK ranked lowest out of 24 European 
countries for life satisfaction and having a positive sense of purpose 
in life. They also ranked second in terms of sadness (The Children’s 
Society, 2020). Taken together, therefore, understanding why this is 
and finding ways to reduce mental illness in young people in the UK 
is a priority.

The role of schools in young people’s 
mental health

Globally,  children  in  OECD  countries  spend  an  average  of 
over 800 h a year in school (OECD, 2020). Since children spend 
such  a  large  amount  of  their  time  in  schools  and  over  several 
critical periods in their early development, schools have a large 
role to play in their cognitive, emotional and social development, 
social  skills,  academic  attainment,  and,  ultimately,  well-being 
(Fazel  et  al.,  2014).  Even  so,  in  the  UK,  the  Department  for 
Education saw a real-term budget cut of 7.4% between 2010 and 
2016  (Crawford  and  Keynes,  2015),  which  has  triggered  some 
significant impacts and challenges in schools. These include staff 
cuts and poorer retention, scaled-back curriculums, and increased 
levels of teacher ill-being.

While initiatives for embedding well-being into the curriculum 
in UK schools are nothing new (e.g., the Children and Social Work 
Act  2017  made  PSHE  [personal,  social,  health,  and  economic 
education] a statutory requirement at all schools in England from 
September 2020), many tend to run separate well-being initiatives 
alongside mainstream teaching (Spratt et al., 2006). Mental health 
outcomes can also be improved by delivering both mental health 
identification  and  prevention  programs  in  schools  (Levitt  et  al., 
2007). However, the engagement of affected parties, including school 
staff, counselors, and support staff, is necessary for the successful 
implementation of evidence-based interventions in school settings, 
and it has been shown that such engagement is lacking (Fazel et al., 
2014).  Fazel  et  al.  also  identified  a  number  of  other  challenges 
associated with the delivery of mental health interventions in schools. 
These  operate  on  three  levels:  individual  factors,  such  as  stigma, 
individual  risk  factors,  and  parental  issues;  community-related 
factors, such as geographic location and social status; and system-
related  factors,  including  access  to  funding,  waiting  times,  and 
availability of training.

The role of positive psychology in schools

Positive psychology (PP) and its application in schools through 
Positive Education provides a more holistic approach to education 
that  addresses  both  academic  success  and  well-being  without  one 
having to overshadow the other. Building on the science of well-being 
(Seligman, 2002), and more often based on Seligman’s (2011) PERMA 
Framework (positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, 
meaning,  and  accomplishment)  and  its’  adaptations,  Positive 
Psychology Interventions (PPIs) are now being developed for schools 
(Slade et al., 2017; Rashid and Seligman, 2018), and it has been shown 
that embedding well-being lessons as part of the school curriculum 
improves  student  mental  health  (Boniwell  et  al.,  2016).  As  a 
consequence, this includes benefits on academic performance, too. 
PPIs that run year-round as part of class timetables have also shown 
efficacy in not only improving well-being but also reducing stress and 
anxiety (Shoshani and Steinmetz, 2014). Such an approach, however, 
requires support on a number of levels, including embedding well-
being into teacher training, school leadership training, educational 
culture, and shifting mindsets too (Waters, 2011). To be effective at 
embedding well-being for students, teachers need to have positive 
well-being, too.

An alternative approach is to offer brief PPIs that run outside of 
the school’s usual curriculum. While the results of these have been 
mixed  (Suldo  et  al.,  2014),  leading  to  the  conclusion  that  the 
widespread adoption of brief school-based PPIs is not empirically 
supported  (Dawood,  2013),  more  recent  evidence  is  much  more 
optimistic.  For  example,  brief  PPIs  have  been  shown  to  enhance 
academic performance by increasing students’ motivation to study 
(Muro et al., 2018). They have also demonstrated a diverse range of 
benefits  to  students  in  terms  of  both  well-being  and  learning 
(Shankland and Rosset, 2017). A limitation of the majority of brief 
PPIs, however, is that they can focus on a single concept from PP, such 
as gratitude (Froh et al., 2010), character strengths (Quinlan et al., 
2015), or mindfulness (Sapthiang et al., 2019).

Although peer-reviewed research in this area is limited, especially 
when compared to that which uses a single PPI approach, PPIs that 
broaden  the  focus  to  include  multiple  concepts  from  positive 
psychology  [Multi-component  Positive  Psychology  Interventions; 
mPPIs] in schools have been shown to be more effective. For example, 
in her review of 12 school-based PPIs designed to increase student 
well-being and academic performance, Waters (2011) concluded that, 
while acknowledging that some limitations in, e.g., design exist, the 
effectiveness of PPIs is encouraging. The PP concepts utilized in her 
review included positive emotions, resilience, and character strengths. 
In more recent exploratory research of a mPPI designed to improve 
happiness and classroom behavior in a sample of at-risk high school 
students, DeBiase et al. (2022) also found that, while the effects were 
not as expected, even the small changes in a positive direction were 
promising, and especially for those working with at-risk populations 
of adolescents. Although limited by the small number of systematic 
literature reviews that have been carried out on the effectiveness of 
PPIs, the reporting of smaller effect sizes appears common (White 
et al., 2019). Indeed, in their meta-analysis of the effectiveness of PPIs 
more generally (i.e., not just in schools), White et al. found the effect 
sizes reported were much smaller, although they also justified this by 
differences across studies and their design, including issues related to 
methodology and the use of smaller sample sizes.

Multi-component positive psychology 
interventions

Given there is no ‘one fits all’ approach to PPIs, and with some 
PPIs found to be more effective and engaging for some students than 
others,  additional  benefits  of  adopting  a  mPPI  over  a  single  PPI 
approach  include  having  a  broader  reach,  greater  inclusivity  and, 
ultimately, a larger range of beneficial effects. One such mPPI carried 
out in secondary schools in the UK is the Hummingbird Project (Platt 
et al., 2020). Drawing on Seligman’s (2011) PERMA Framework, the 
Hummingbird Project mPPI involves teaching students concepts from 
positive psychology in class, which they then practice at home, using 
at-home activities. The delivery of the mPPI is approximately 1 h per 
week  over  5–6 weeks.  Indeed,  studies  discussed  above  have 
demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  interventions  that  target  each  of  the 
individual variables targeted in the Hummingbird Project.

The results of the Hummingbird Project mPPI following its’ first 
year  of  academic  delivery  showed  improvements  in  well-being, 
resilience,  and  hope  in  secondary  school-aged  children,  thus 
evidencing an increase in flourishing as conceptualized by Keyes and 
Haidt (2010). A limitation of this study, however, and one which this 
current study was designed to address, is that the effects on symptoms 
of mental distress were not also explored. Acknowledging that repeat 
doses may be necessary (Stockings et al., 2016), previous research has 
shown  that  school-based  mental  health  interventions  can  lead  to 
reliable and clinically significant changes in anxiety and depression 
(Punukollu  et  al.,  2020).  Such  information  would  be  of  particular 
interest to schools since mental ill-health has higher costs for schools 
than other public service sectors (Fazel et al., 2014). It would also be of 
interest  to  researchers,  as  evidence  for  the  effects  of  school-based 
anxiety prevention is mixed (Waldron et al., 2018).

The current study

The  current  study  aimed  to  explore  the  effects  of  the  mPPI 
Hummingbird Project on well-being in secondary school students 
following its’ second full academic year of delivery. The project had 
previously been piloted with 90 students in two schools and then 
delivered to 1,058 students in 14 schools across the North West of 
England [see Platt et al. (2020)]. Furthermore, it aimed to expand on 
prior findings of the Hummingbird Project mPPI (Platt et al., 2020), 
which found a small beneficial effect on indicators of flourishing, by 
also assessing the impact of the mPPI on symptoms of mental distress.
Given the time, funding, and resource difficulties faced by schools, 
a full randomized controlled trial was impractical; hence, a pragmatic 
approach using within-subject comparisons was adopted. The delivery 
was carried out by a single researcher, assisted by Undergraduate and 
master’s level psychology students recruited from two universities 
local to the schools. All participating schools were based in the North 
West  of  England  and  selected  from  those  who  chose  to  respond 
favorably to the offer of this free mPPI; some variability across schools 
did exist. As such, the current study explored whether any effect of the 
mPPI found would remain having accounted for individual, school, 
or local authority-related differences. These three levels have been 
chosen as proxies for the levels of individual, community, and system 
suggested  by  Fazel  et  al.  (2014)  discussed  above,  each  of  which  is 
expected to bring unique challenges that may negatively effect the 

outcomes of the PPI. [note: there are 353 local authorities in England. 
These provide the local government for their metropolitan borough, 
county, or district (National Audit Office, 2017)].

Using standardized measures of well-being and mental distress 
and  building  on  the  effectiveness  of  previous  research  using  the 
Hummingbird Project (Platt et al., 2020), it was hypothesized that:

i  The mPPI would improve the students’ levels of well-being and 
hope from pre- to post-intervention, having accounted for the 
potential  random  effects  from  local  authorities,  schools, 
or participants.

  ii  The mPPI would reduce students’ symptoms of mental distress 
from  pre-  to  post-intervention,  having  accounted  for  the 
potential  random  effects  from  local  authorities,  schools, 
or participants.

Method

Intervention

Year  2  of  the  Hummingbird  Project  involved  six  weekly  1-h 
sessions that took place during normal timetabled school hours, at 
different  stages  across  the  academic  year  depending  on  timetable 
availability in each school, delivered by a single researcher (Author 1), 
with support from Undergraduate and Masters Psychology students 
(trained by Author 1). An introduction to the mPPI for students and 
teachers  took  place  in  session  1,  along  with  a  discussion  of  what 
happiness means to each individual in the group. A range of concepts 
from positive psychology was then discussed in sessions 2 to 5, with 
activities  relating  to  each  concept.  The  concepts  covered  in  these 
sessions were as follows: happiness, hope and resilience, mindfulness, 
character  strengths,  growth  mindsets,  and  gratitude,  respectively. 
During  each  session,  students  took  part  in  a  range  of  activities 
intended to help them understand and use these concepts in their 
daily lives and were given a homework task to help them understand 
how each concept can improve their own mental health. The final 
session involved a recap of the topics covered in previous sessions, 
along with advice for students on how to incorporate these concepts 
into their lives in future.

Delivery of the project took place across the academic year in 
eight  secondary  schools  across  North  West  England.  However, 
delivery of the project had to be halted at one school before post-
intervention  testing  could  take  place  due  to  the  imposition  of 
lockdowns in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. All students were 
given a workbook to complete throughout the intervention, which 
then became theirs to keep at the end. The workbook was a place 
where students could record any work they completed in sessions and 
at  home,  as  well  as  their  thoughts  and  feelings  regarding  the 
experience. Students were also given questionnaires to complete as 
baseline and outcome measures.

Participants

Participants  were  an  opportunity  sample  of  727  students. 
However, due to COVID-19 restrictions, complete data could not

be obtained from 113 students in one school. As such, our final sample 
consisted  of  614  students.  Recruitment  of  participants  involved 
emailing  the  Head  Teachers  and  Special  Educational  Needs 
Coordinators of a number of schools in the region. Schools in the 
Cheshire West and Chester Local Authority were selected based on 
their location being in the top 40% for deprivation (MHCLG, 2019). 
The participant inclusion criteria for the intervention, which were 
provided  by  the  research  team  to  the  school,  were  as  follows:  (a) 
studying  at  a  secondary  school  and  (b)  willingness  of  the  school, 
parents,  and/or  carers  for  students  to  take  part  in  the  study. 
Furthermore, school staff allowed students to participate based on the 
student’s  form  group,  PSHE  group,  timetabled  lesson  group,  or 
perceived need for intervention; the researchers were not privy to the 
reason for perceived need. The schools were in control of this process, 
without interference from the research team.

Participants were aged between 11 and 15 (M = 11.46, SD = 0.70), 
and 46% were female, which was fairly representative of all schools in 
the study. A majority of participants (94%) were in Year 7, 2% were in 
Year 8, 2% were in Year 9, and 3% were in Year 10. White British 
students made up 82% of the sample, with the next most populous 
ethnic  group  being  British  Asian,  at  8%,  students  of  a  mixed 
background making up 5%, and Black British being 4% of the sample. 
The  remainder  were  of  Polish,  Romanian,  Turkish,  and 
Hungarian descent.

Instruments

Questionnaires 

included 
measures. These were as follows:

three  standardized  quantitative 

i  The  World  Health  Organization-Five  Well-Being  Index 
(WHO-5; Staehr, 1998) is a five-item well-being scale, with 
items measured on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = at no time; 5 = all 
of the time). Staehr (1998) has shown that Cronbach’s α = 0.75, 
and an example item is “I have felt cheerful and in good spirits.” 
The WHO-5 has been validated as a measure of well-being for 
adolescents  (De  Wit  et  al.,  2007),  showing  a  one-factor 
structure using confirmatory factor analysis. Cronbach’s α was 
0.82, and the WHO-5 showed a moderate to strong correlation 
with the CES-D (r = 0.67), with the mental health (r = 0.60) and 
self-esteem (r = 0.43) subscales of the CHQ-CF87, and with the 
DFCS  (r  = 0.34),  which  was  taken  to  confirm  concurrent 
validity. The same study used ROC curve analysis to show the 
WHO-5 cutoff point of 50 for the identification of mild-to-
severe depressive affect, with sensitivity at 89% and specificity 
at  86%.  For  our  sample,  the  WHO-5  demonstrated  good 
reliability  in  both  pre-intervention  (α  = 0.73)  and  post-
intervention (α = 0.84).

  ii  The Young Person’s Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation 
(YP-CORE; Twigg et al., 2016) is a monitoring tool with items 
covering  anxiety,  depression,  trauma,  physical  problems, 
functioning, and risk to self. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert 
scale (0 = not at all; 4 = most or all of the time). An example 
item  is  “I  have  not  felt  like  talking  to  anyone.”  Twigg  et  al. 
(2016) showed a one-week test–retest mean Time 1 score of 8.3 
(95% CI: 7.2–9.5; range: 0–27; SD = 5.6) and mean Time 2 score 
of 7.7 (95% CI: 6.5–9.3; range: 0–30; SD = 6.6). Mean change 

was shown not to be statistically significant (t = 1.2, df = 89, 
p = 0.23; Wilcoxon U = 1787, p = 0.15) with a negligible effect 
size (Hedges’ g = 0.09, 95% CI:-0.21 to +0.39). They found that 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient for Time 1 and Time 2 scores 
was as follows: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.65–0.86) and Spearman’s rho 
was  0.74  (95%  CI:  0.58–0.83).  They  also  demonstrated 
reliability for the YP-CORE when used in a non-clinical sample 
of  children,  with  Cronbach’s  α = 0.83.  Similarly,  our  sample 
demonstrated good reliability pre-intervention (α = 0.81) and 
post-intervention for (α = 0.84) the YP-CORE.

  iii  The  Children’s  Hope  Scale  (CHS;  Snyder  et  al.,  1997)  is  a 
measure of hope that uses six items on a 6-point Likert scale 
(1 = none of the time; 6 = all of the time). An example item is “I 
can think of many ways to get the things in life that are most 
important to me.” Snyder et al. (1997) demonstrated that the 
CHS has high internal consistency (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.72–
0.86) and high temporal stability [r (359) = 0.17, p < 0.01]. The 
internal reliability of the CHS was high for our sample, both 
pre-intervention (α = 0.87) and post-intervention (α = 0.92).

Data collection procedures

Pre-intervention  outcome  measures  were  administered  to 
participants  at  the  start  of  session  1  of  the  mPPI,  with  post-
intervention measures being administered at the end of session 6. 
Participants were assured of their anonymity in the outcome testing, 
encouraged to be as honest as possible, and informed that they had 
the right to withdraw from the study if they so wished. They were also 
informed  that  their  school  grades  would  not  be  affected  by  their 
participation in the study or by any of the answers they gave to the 
questions. Procedures were conducted in line with relevant guidelines 
and approved by the university ethics board. Once participants had 
completed both pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, responses 
were coded, and scores were calculated in line with each instrument’s 
published scoring guidance.

Data analysis procedure

The  repeated  measures  outcomes  followed  a  nested  structure: 
within participants (n = 614), within schools (n = 6), and within local 
authorities (n = 2).

All  analyses  were  performed  using  the  open  software  Jamovi 
(version  2.0.0,  The  Jamovi  Project,  2021).  To  test  our  hypotheses, 
mixed-effect model analyses were conducted as these provide more 
robust  estimates  than  repeated  measures  ANOVA  with  respect  to 
missing data and type 1 error rate (Mallinckrodt et al., 2001). Further 
mixed-effect  models  account  for  fixed  and  random  effects,  which 
provide a more comprehensive overview of the effect in the data by 
accounting for both the overall trends and the individual variations. 
These analyses were performed in the General Analyses for Linear 
Models in Jamovi (GAMLj) package version 2.4.8 (Gallucci, 2019). 
The GAMLj package is able to account for the nested data structure 
without explicit specification. Three models (one per outcome) were 
computed, which included the repeated measure (pre and post) as our 
fixed-factor predictor (time) and included correlated participant level,

school-level, and county-level random intercepts, using a restricted 
maximum-likelihood function with the bobyqa optimizer.

Results

Descriptive statistics for our full sample for each of the repeated 

measures outcome variables are presented in Table 1.

The  mixed-effect  models  reported  displayed  approximately 
normally  distributed,  homoscedastic  residuals.  Significant  main 
effects of time were consistently observed across all of the outcome 
variables (see Table 2), indicating the intervention to have salutary 
effects. However, the marginal R2 were low for all models, suggesting 
a small effect of the fixed factor. ICC for the models showed that the 
clustering for participants was substantial for all models. However, the 
similarity  of  observations  by  school  and  county  was  much  less 
important for the WHO-5 than for our YP-CORE and CHS outcomes. 
It  should  be  noted  that  results  were  found  to  be  unchanged  by 
removing all non-year seven students.

Discussion

The  findings  of  this  study  indicate  significant  positive 
improvements in all three of the outcome measures, with increases 
of 0.79 in well-being (WHO-5) and 0.67 in hope (CHS) and very 
small  reductions  of  −0.08  in  symptoms  of  mental  distress 
(YP-CORE) from pre- to post-intervention, while also accounting 
for  random  effects  from  the  local  authority,  school,  and 
participants. As such, these findings replicate the effects on well-
being  observed  by  Platt  et  al.  (2020)  following  the  first  year  of 
delivery of the Hummingbird Project mPPI. Like Shoshani and 
Steinmetz (2014), following a year-round delivery of PPIs, they 
also show that, even over a much shorter time period of delivery 
(i.e.,  five  to  six  weeks),  the  Hummingbird  Project  mPPI  also 
reduces mental distress alongside improving well-being. This is 
further supported by the small marginal R2 in the models (0.005–
0.01).  The  inter-class  correlations  (ICCs)  for  the  models  also 
support  the  inclusion  of  random  intercepts  for  participants  by 
accounting for a significant amount of variance in scores. This was 
particularly  noticeable  in  the  model  of  well-being,  indicating 
individual differences among participants to account for some of 
the effects observed. Conversely, school and local authorities had 
a  small  ICC,  suggesting  that  these  did  not  account  for  much 
variation in scores. As such, both hypotheses are supported. That

is to say, the mPPI improved participants’ levels of well-being and 
hope from pre- to post-intervention, accounting for the random 
effects from local authorities, schools, and participants. Also, the 
mPPI reduced participants’ symptoms of mental distress from pre- 
to post-intervention, accounting for the random effects from local 
authorities, schools, and participants.

These results add more evidence to the idea that PPIs need not 
take place over long durations, as in the example of Shoshani and 
Steinmetz  (2014),  using  time  and  resources  that  might  otherwise 
be used for more academic learning, which, as discussed earlier, can 
often be prioritized above student mental health (Waters, 2011).

Interventions  can  impact  on  three  levels—individual  factors, 
community-related factors, and system-related factors (Fazel et al., 
2014). The results here show that individual factors play a large part 
in  the  outcomes  of  the  Hummingbird  Project.  Though  a  large 
contribution of community factors, namely county (local authority) 
and school-related factors, were not shown, a large proportion of error 
variance remains in the models. This is not, however, uncommon 
when delivering interventions in uncontrolled settings, or by way of 
measurement  error  for  the  key  variables.  Research  designs  which 
afford greater experimental control would likely yield reduced error 
variability (Cohen, 1988), though the implementation of these designs 
is limited in education settings due to limited resources and constraints 
on  participant  burden  imposed  by  gatekeepers.  Indeed,  the  very 
imposition of these limits not only points to educators’ lack of priority 
of student mental health, discussed above, but also that school-related 
factors do have a significant effect on the efficacy of PPIs, even though 
this has not been demonstrated in this case. It is, therefore, important 
that researchers attempting to implement PPIs in the school setting 
attempt  to  account  for  such  factors.  It  would  also  be  advisable  to 
conduct further studies accounting for and attempting to measure 
these effects.

Although not compared statistically, compared to results from 
cohort  1  (Platt  et  al.,  2020),  this  second  year  of  delivery  of  the 
Hummingbird student cohort also displayed a larger improvement in 
well-being,  but  with  a  smaller  improvement  in  hope.  Given  the 
delivery of the mPPI was during the early part of the pandemic, and 
particularly early on, when the levels of uncertainty may have been 
more  heightened,  this  result  remains  optimistic.  Children  can 
be particularly vulnerable to the mental ill-health-related effects of 
uncertainty, particularly if others around them are experiencing the 
effects  of  uncertainty,  too.  Irrespective,  an  increase  in  well-being 
following the Hummingbird Project was still found. Also, while there 
was a smaller improvement in hope than those who participated in 
the  first  year  of  delivery  (which  may  also  be  explained  by  the 
heightened levels of uncertainty), a significant increase in hope was 
still found, too. It is important to note, however, that the children who 
participated in the second year of delivery were different from those 
who  participated  in  the  first  year  and,  as  such,  some  effects  of 
individual differences may be at play here.

With  the  dosage  of  the  intervention  being  relatively  small, 
associated small effects are promising. Larger doses may yield larger 
effects, although this would require further testing. It would also likely 
be difficult to implement due to the logistical constraints of testing in 
schools. It is also likely that, as the intervention facilitator did not 
benefit  from  having  a  pre-existing  relationship  with  the  students 
(Paulus  et  al.,  2016),  greater  effects  could  be  observed  should 
Hummingbird be delivered by a class teacher. Stockings et al. (2016)

have  shown  teacher  delivery  to  be  more  effective  than  clinician 
delivery for internalizing disorders. Although a recommendation for 
teacher training, as teachers seldom receive mental health training 
(Byrne et al., 2015) and report feeling uncomfortable intervening in 
student well-being issues for fear of making things worse (Hatton 
et al., 2017), the use of a facilitator may, therefore, be a necessity for 
brief mPPIs. It is also worth noting that facilitated interventions give 
students the time and opportunity to express feelings and emotions. 
They might also present teachers with the opportunity to see and hear 
what might be helpful for individual students. Hence, offering training 
to teachers so they can carry out the intervention within the classroom 
could be of interest to institutions as a way to incorporate the benefits 
of  the  interventions  into  the  whole  school  setting.  If  teachers  are 
finding benefit from the interventions, they are also more likely to 
be able to communicate this with enthusiasm to their students.

It stands to reason that improvements in levels of hope (CHS) 
would be found in participants in the project, not least because this is 
one  of  the  concepts  covered  in  the  intervention  itself.  However, 
improvements in mental distress resulting from an intervention that 
does not address this construct may at first seem counterintuitive. 
Promoting positive mental health can ‘buffer’ the negative effects of 
mental illness (Trompetter et al., 2017) and produce health and social 
benefits  (Lyubomirsky  et  al.,  2005;  Keyes,  2007).  Therefore,  an 
intervention that improves mental health can be expected to lead to 
improvements in educational attainment, productivity, longevity, and 
reduced risk of both suicide and mental illness (Campion et al., 2012). 
Indeed, an intervention that leads to flourishing can be expected to 
reduce languishing (i.e., low levels of satisfaction, purpose, meaning 
and fulfillment; Keyes and Haidt, 2010), as has been shown in the case 
of the Hummingbird Project.

Limitations

On the one hand, a limitation that could be raised is that the effect 
sizes were overall small. However, in response to this, the observed 
effect sizes for the present cohort of participants are within the range 
to be expected for universal prevention programs of this type delivered 
to school-aged children of 0.07–0.16 (Tanner-Smith et al., 2018), with 
the estimates (marginal R2) when converted to Cohen’s d (Cohen, 
1988) ranging from 0.14 to 0.20. While likely not perceptible at the 
individual level, they can also be meaningful at the population level 
(Cohen, 1988; Kraemer and Kupfer, 2006) in the context of prevention. 
The reporting of small effects following PPIs is also quite common 
(White et al., 2019), with even small changes in a positive direction 
promising, particularly for students at risk (DeBiase et al., 2022).

The  two  time  points  of  the  intervention  do  not  allow  for  the 
inclusion of varying slopes in the models. That is to say, one data point 
more  than  cells  per  individual  (i.e.,  three  data  points  for  random 
intercept and random slopes) is required. As such, it is impossible to 
estimate the varying rate of improvement, and the estimates are for 
the sample as a whole. It is also likely that rates of improvement are 
not fixed and differ at an individual level. Future studies, therefore, 
may want to increase the number of time points to allow for this more 
refined estimation and to measure any potential stability of change 
found between pre- and post-intervention.

Additionally, the lack of control groups in this study makes it 
impossible to state with certainty that the observed effect was due to

the intervention, or possibly a placebo effect. Furthermore, the lack of 
a control group makes it possible that the effects are in part due to 
regression  to  the  mean,  or  possibly  by  unaccounted-for  tertiary 
variables. Thus, describing the intervention as a causal factor for the 
salutary  effects  observed  would  be  beyond  the  scope  of  the  data. 
Studies that included a control group would be more able to speak to 
the causes of these observed improvements.

That said, when designing such a study, one must consider the 
difficulties of recruitment in a school context. Resources and time are 
limited  (Crawford  and  Keynes,  2015),  which  calls  for  pragmatic 
decisions. This was the case for the Hummingbird Project. Schools 
recruited into the study could not allocate more time to the study than 
was given, as participant burden for three-time points was judged too 
high and control groups were not deemed acceptable by gatekeepers. 
This  remains  a  limitation,  and  replication  with  robust  designs  is 
necessary to strengthen the evidence base for this mPPI.

Data for the well-being outcome (WHO-5) replicate previously 
published  findings  (Platt  et  al.,  2020)  with  effect  sizes  being 
comparable  (i.e.,  small  effects).  However,  while  the  effect  of  the 
Children’s Hope Scale did replicate, it was not of the same magnitude 
in  the  current  study,  being  smaller.  As  described  previously,  it  is 
possible that the national context impacted the outcomes of the study, 
but the lack of consistency may simply indicate that the variation in 
effect sizes is due to a cohort effect. Alternatively, the intervention 
delivery (facilitated by the lead author, IP) may have improved in line 
with the growing experience of the facilitator (Coetzee et al., 2021). 
The YP-CORE, measuring psychological distress, was an additional 
inclusion for the second year of the Hummingbird project; thus, it is 
a novel finding which will require replication.

Although the impact of the lockdowns on the outcomes of the 
study  cannot  be  clearly  established,  they  did  prematurely  end  the 
delivery of the intervention. Schools where delivery was impacted by 
the lockdown were omitted from the analyses, as these participants 
were unable to complete post-intervention measures. The potential for 
future school closures due to local or national contexts does suggest 
that in order for PPIs to reach those in need when they need it most, 
delivery must be flexible. Therefore, we recommend that the feasibility 
of an online version of the Hummingbird Project should be assessed. 
Comparing self-guided (completed at participant’s own pace following 
pre-prepared materials) against facilitated (completed with a facilitator 
at a mutually convenient time) online interventions would allow the 
comparison  of  the  effectiveness  of  varying  modes  of  delivery.  An 
online  facilitated  intervention  also  has  the  potential  to  be  more 
effective than a self-guided online intervention (Fischer et al., 2020), 
and  it  may  even  outperform  the  school-based  version,  given  the 
typically small effect sizes shown in such a setting. However, this is an 
empirical question, and data obtained from such a comparison would 
inform  decisions  where  resources  are  limited,  by  indicating  if  the 
relative gains in effectiveness are worth the resource cost.

The YP-CORE was used to measure symptoms of mental distress 
in this study and, compared to the effects of the Hummingbird Project 
on hope and well-being, its’ effects on symptoms of mental distress 
showed the smallest effect. Interestingly, however, the YP-CORE also 
had the smallest standard deviations. This suggests that participants 
displayed low distress symptomology and, as such, this might be an 
indication of restriction of range in scores. That is, the effects of the 
mPPI were subdued due to participants being clustered around low 
distress symptomology scores; higher scores, by and large, were not 
present. This is a limitation and yet also a possible strength. Even though 

standard deviations were small, a small effect of the mPPI was found. If 
participants had higher levels of distress, a larger effect size might have 
been found. The standard deviations for hope and well-being did have 
larger  standard  deviations  and,  as  such,  less  restriction  of  range. 
Although also an issue in younger children, 50% of lifetime mental 
illness starts by age 14 and increases to 75% by the mid-20s (Kessler 
et al., 2007). The majority of participants in this study were in Year 7 
(age 11–12 years). As such, future research needs to expand to older age 
groups to see if the benefits of the Hummingbird Project on mental 
distress increase with increasing age. By implementing a longer-term 
evaluation of the mPPI, the potential of the Hummingbird Project to 
‘buffer’ against the development of mental distress most often associated 
with older-aged secondary school students could also be explored. As 
no follow-up data are currently available, there is no option to explore 
this yet.

Conclusion

The findings of the current study concur with, and expand upon, 
previous  research  (Platt  et  al.,  2020)  by  demonstrating  small 
improvements  in  well-being  and  hope,  together  with  a  small  but 
significant reduction in distress from pre- to post-intervention. Since 
mental ill-health has higher costs for schools (Fazel et al., 2014), an 
mPPI which benefits both mental health and mental distress will be of 
more  interest.  The  effectiveness  of  this  mPPI  has  now  also  been 
demonstrated with regard to well-being and hope in two consecutive 
cohorts, which provides incremental support for the effectiveness of 
the Hummingbird Project mPPI. However, caution must be observed 
in interpreting these results, as causal inferences are not possible due 
to the pragmatic restraints which limited the study design. As such, 
and particularly given the replication crisis more generally, continued 
replication efforts are warranted to further the evidence base for this 
promising prevention program with more robust evaluation design.
