Abstract

This article reviews the prevalence and outcomes of perinatal intimate partner violence (IPV). 
Reported rates of perinatal intimate partner violence range from 3.7% to 9%. Perinatal IPV is 
associated with a multitude of mental and obstetric health outcomes that impact the mother and 
child. Perinatal medical providers have an opportunity to detect victims of IPV and facilitate 
services for this population. Screening, safety planning, and referral procedures are essential for 
addressing this public health problem.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health problem that involves physical 
violence, sexual violence, stalking, psychological aggression, or control of reproductive 
health perpetrated by a current or former intimate partner (see Box 1)1,2. An intimate partner 
is an individual with whom one has a close personal relationship; however, the 
characteristics of the relationship such the degree of contact or familiarity with one another 
can vary1. Based on results from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 
5.9% of women reported experiencing IPV in the past year2. Prevalence of lifetime exposure 
to specific forms of IPV is alarming, ranging from 8.6% for reproductive control to 47.1% 
for psychological aggression.

The highest rates of IPV are reported among women who are of reproductive age, with the 
greatest prevalence occurring among individuals 18 to 34 year’s old1, 2. Therefore, it is 
essential to investigate IPV among perinatal women. The current review outlines the:

Perinatal IPV

Perinatal IPV refers to experiences of violence that occur 12 months prior to pregnancy, 
during pregnancy, and up to one year following a pregnancy3–4. Based on population 
studies, estimated rates of perinatal IPV in the form of physical violence range from 3.7% to 
9%3–4. However, it is difficult to estimate the rates of perinatal IPV because these 
population-based studies have focused on physical violence, without adequately assessing 
for other forms of perinatal IPV such as sexual violence and psychological aggression. 
Further, frequencies of IPV are higher in clinic-based samples compared to epidemiological 
samples. Among 104 rural women attending prenatal care in the beginning of their third 
trimester, 20.2% experienced sexual IPV, 27.9% reported physical IPV, and 79.8% endorsed 
psychological aggression during their pregnancy5. Other clinic-based studies have reported 
rates of perinatal IPV up to 16.4% and 73% for physical and psychological IPV, 
respectively6–7. Perinatal providers are in a unique position to identify, evaluate, and 
facilitate services for women experiencing IPV.

Maternal Risk Factors and Mental and Obstetrical Health Associations of 

Perinatal IPV

Risk factors for perinatal IPV include lower socioeconomic status, being unmarried, housing 
instability, younger age, Medicaid insurance, and fewer years of education4, 8. Rates of IPV 
tend to be slightly higher during the year prior to pregnancy than during pregnancy. For 
example, based on data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) 
4.7% of women reported physical violence perpetrated by a partner in the year prior to 
pregnancy compared to 3.7% during pregnancy4. Exposure to IPV among perinatal women 
is associated with a host of pervasive and serious maternal mental and physical health 
consequences.

Mental Health

Perinatal IPV is associated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive 
disorder, and problematic substance use, which typically extend to postpartum periods (see 
Box 2)6, 9. It is important to distinguish the nature of perinatal IPV from other forms of 
traumatic events. In population-based studies, women exposed to various forms of 
interpersonal violence (e.g., child abuse, sexual abuse, IPV) have high rates of PTSD,

depressive, and substance use symptoms10–11. These symptoms are typically higher among 
individuals exposed to interpersonal violence compared to individuals who have other 
experiences of traumatic events such as natural disasters, armed conflicts, or accidents11. 
High rates of symptoms may result from IPV because of contextual factors, such as the 
relationship with the perpetrator and nature of the abuse. For example, within IPV the 
perpetrator may be someone who the individual depends on for emotional, financial, or 
instrumental (e.g., household chores, childcare) support. In addition, IPV is invasive, and, 
more often than not, involves repeated victimizations. Women exposed to IPV often 
experience ongoing legitimate fear about the potential for future harm, which can exacerbate 
distress12. These contextual factors are especially relevant to risk for developing mental 
health symptoms.

Perinatal physical, sexual, and psychological IPV are associated with PTSD during and after 
pregnancy. For instances, 40% of low-income pregnant women who reported perinatal IPV 
met criteria for PTSD13. A majority of these low-income pregnant women reported that 
other life events were distressful; therefore many women with perinatal IPV may have 
exposure to several traumatic events, which is associated with worse mental health 
outcomes11. Perinatal physical and psychological IPV are also associated with increased 
depressive symptoms during pregnancy14 and postpartum15. More specifically, among a 
large urban sample women who endorsed perinatal IPV were three times more likely to meet 
criteria for depressive disorders during pregnancy16. In addition, perinatal IPV was 
associated with increased risk of depression and PTSD symptoms among women who were 
up to 14-months post-delivery of their child 17. Finally, compared to women who are not 
exposed to perinatal IPV, women with exposure reported higher levels of suicidal ideation 
during pregnancy18 and subsequent to delivery19. During 2003 to 2007, 2.0 per 100,000 
births resulted in maternal suicide and 54.3% of the people who committed suicide 
experienced IPV that was suspected to relate to the suicide20.

Nicotine, drug, and alcohol use is also a concern among women exposed to perinatal 
IPV21, 22. Although many women are able to successfully refrain from using substances 
while pregnant, the prolonged stress and fear associated with IPV can make abstaining 
difficult. The self-medication model proposes that substance use is reinforcing because it 
reduces distress, therefore over time it becomes a pattern of learned behavior to cope with 
distress23. In support of this theory, more severe IPV, PTSD, and depression symptoms 
predicted greater problems with substance use among community samples of women24. 
With regards to perinatal IPV and nicotine use, physical IPV the year before and/or during 
pregnancy was associated with a 2.6 times increased risk of smoking cigarettes during 
pregnancy compared to non-abused women25.

Substance use and mental health symptoms also frequently co-occur among women exposed 
to perinatal IPV. In a primarily Latina sample of pregnant women, those with perinatal IPV 
and depressive symptoms were more likely to report co-occurring substance use problems26. 
Further, among a sample of women attending prenatal visits, women with positive alcohol 
use screens were 2.26 more likely to report physical IPV within the past year, and women 
who had positive depression screens were 3.37 times more likely to report physical IPV in 
the past year27. Taken together, research supports that women who report perinatal IPV are

also at increased risk to use alcohol, nicotine, and drugs compared to women who do not 
report IPV.

In summary, lifetime exposure to IPV and perinatal IPV poses significant risk for women to 
experience PTSD, depression, suicidal ideation, and smoke during perinatal periods25, 26. 
Furthermore, IPV six to twelve months after deliver results in higher levels of distress and 
depression compared to women who are not exposed to postpartum violence28. Therefore, 
providers need to be aware that exposure to lifetime IPV may elevate risk for mental health 
distress among perinatal women. The impact of perinatal IPV moves beyond mental health 
consequences to a range of obstetric health outcomes.

Obstetric Health

There is substantial evidence that perinatal IPV is linked to multiple obstetric complications. 
Exposure to IPV may impact women’s physical health through direct impact of physical 
violence that results in maternal or utero-placental injury. However, another mechanism is 
related to the body’s response to acute and chronic stress. The impact of exposure to acute 
and chronic stress can result in overactive and underactive responses in the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis29. The HPA axis regulates hormone secretion through a 
negative feedback system, which involves interaction between the hypothalamus, pituitary 
and adrenal glands that communicate signals to reduce or increase the production of 
hormones, such as cortisol or cortisol releasing factor. Exposure to IPV can impact the 
negative feedback system, thereby affecting the secretion of hormones in a manner that can 
have negative implications for autoimmune and inflammatory responses.

The physiological impact related to frequent and ongoing threat associated with IPV may be 
especially relevant to obstetric health. Women who experienced perinatal IPV are more 
likely to have high blood pressure or edema, vaginal bleeding in the second or third 
trimester, severe nausea, vomiting or dehydration, kidney infection or UTI, premature 
rupture of membranes and premature birth4. Women with IPV are five times more likely to 
experience placental abruption, or separation of the placenta from the uterus, a complication 
associated with fetal growth restriction, preterm birth and intrauterine fetal demise8. 
Regarding timing of perinatal IPV, exposure to IPV before and during pregnancy have both 
been associated with negative health outcomes, however some risks may become greater for 
women who experience abuse 12 months prior to becoming pregnant, including vaginal 
bleeding, severe nausea, vomiting or dehydration, and kidney infections or UIT4.

Perinatal IPV is also associated with miscarriages, preterm birth, and diminished intrauterine 
growth4, 30, 31, with results from one study supporting that psychological IPV had a greater 
impact than physical IPV on low birth weight31. Further, women who experience perinatal 
IPV are also less likely to breastfeed and more likely to discontinue breastfeeding after 4 
weeks of delivery32. The gravest risk is death of the fetus, baby, and mother. In a large 
national sample of women who had delivery-related discharges, women who reported 
perinatal IPV were four times more likely to have a stillbirth and three times more likely to 
have a delivery result in fetal death compared to non-abused peers33. Also, women exposed 
to IPV during pregnancy were three times more likely to be the victim of attempted or

completed homicide compared to those who did not endorse perinatal IPV34. Clearly, the 
potential health outcomes associated with perinatal IPV are extensive and severe.

Perinatal IPV is associated with increased health care costs, utilization of emergency room 
visits during pregnancy, and receipt of care in the intensive care unit (ICU) during 
pregnancy30. Unfortunately, women exposed to perinatal IPV are less likely to receive 
adequate prenatal care (i.e., receive care after the fourth month of pregnancy or attended 
fewer than 50% of expected prenatal health care appointments)35. Women exposed to IPV 
face several potential barriers to receiving medical treatment including ongoing abuse, inter-
personal and financial control from their perpetrator, economic stressors, and emotional 
barriers such as shame36. It is essential to increase access to services among this population 
because IPV is often chronic and the negative consequences of perinatal IPV extend past the 
short-term impact on the baby to longer-term developmental issues.

Long-term Impacts of Perinatal IPV on Children

Perinatal exposure to IPV has been shown to have long-term adverse consequences on 
children’s mental, cognitive, and physical health. For instance, youth exposed to perinatal 
IPV are at an increased risk of developing subsequent internalizing and externalizing 
problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, low self-esteem, anger and 
irritability, risky behaviors), and to struggle academically and socially37. Furthermore, health 
care utilization and costs for children with perinatal and postnatal exposure to IPV are higher 
and result in greater emergency department, primary care, and mental health visits38.

Executive Functioning

Pregnant women in abusive relationships are less likely to receive adequate prenatal care, 
have access to healthy foods, and are at increased risk of experiencing trauma-related stress, 
all of which has been linked to premature delivery, low-birth weight, abnormal brain 
development and impaired hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis functioning at birth 
and later in life39. As a result, perinatal exposure to IPV has been linked to long-term 
deficits in children’s executive functioning (e.g., impulsivity, poor-decision making), 
cognitive functioning (e.g., lower IQ levels and academic achievement), and delays in 
reaching appropriate neurodevelopmental milestones40. Exposure to IPV in the home from 
birth to age 3 years has also been associated with an increased risk of developing attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder41. Thus, perinatal IPV can have lasting effects on multiple 
aspects of a child’s executive functioning.

Attachment

Perinatal exposure to IPV can also have an adverse effect on mother-child interactions, or 
attachment. Perinatal IPV has been associated with less positive attunement to the infant, 
negative cognitions about parenting ability and self-efficacy, and decreased maternal 
responsiveness42. In turn, these can increase the risk of hostile interactions between the 
caregiver and child, and neglectful parenting practices43. It is important to understand the 
risks of perinatal IPV on the caregiver-child relationship, because relationships marked by 
qualities such as unpredictability, difficulty trusting, and unresponsiveness have been

associated with increased risk of developing externalizing problems and risk-taking 
behaviors across the lifespan (e.g., substance use, antisocial behavior, truancy)44. Providing 
caregivers with histories of IPV resources related to parenting is essential to preventing 
difficulties in the caregiver-child relationship.

Exposure to Additional Adverse Events

Most individuals experience more than one traumatic event across their lifetime, which is 
associated with more severe mental health symptoms11. Similarly, children exposed IPV in 
the home are also at an increased risk of experiencing a wide range of adverse events 
including: physical abuse, sexual abuse, community violence, and bullying45. They also have 
a two-fold increased risk of victimization or perpetration of IPV as adults. This demonstrates 
the cumulative impact that perinatal IPV may have on increasing risk for future exposure to 
adverse events across generations.

Summary of Impact

Perinatal IPV is associated with adverse mental health and obstetrical health consequences 
for the mother, fetus, and child (see Table 1). Although more research is needed to elucidate 
risk for the mental and obstetric health outcomes among pregnant women according to 
timing and form of IPV, there is adequate support that violence experienced immediately 
prior, during, and/or after pregnancy, as well as lifetime IPV, results in grave health 
consequences. Screening for IPV during perinatal care is essential to addressing the safety 
needs and obstetric health risks among this population.

Perinatal IPV Screening

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) recommends IPV screening for women of 
childbearing age, insuring that such screening would have a moderate net public health 
benefit46. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has developed 
guidelines into the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that require routine IPV screening and 
counseling as a preventive service for adolescent and adult women47. Additional 
organizations, including the American Medical Association (AMA), American Congress of 
Obstetrician Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Nurses Association (ANA) have 
mandated screening for IPV across health care specialties. The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention outline a list of all available screening tools for assessing IPV within 
healthcare settings (for a review of selected screening tools see Table 2)48. There are several 
considerations to weigh when choosing a screening tool. Important considerations can 
include:

•

Screening administration

Page 7

Screening results can differ based on type of administration. Self-report measures can often 
increase the likelihood of disclosure and may remove potential administrator bias, which at 
times could sway patients to respond a particular way49. For example, if a provider has a full 
patient load that particular day the provider may unintentionally send subtle messages to the 
patient to not endorse IPV (no eye contact, reading through screening questions quickly, 
asking questions as a negative, etc.). Provider-administered measures are also available, and 
potential benefits of provider administered screening includes building rapport and natural 
progression to safety planning. Therefore, it is important for each clinic to decide which 
administration of screening is preferred. There are many provider-administered screening 
tools that include standardized questions for providers to ask either all patients (universal 
screening) or patients who are at risk for IPV (targeted screening). Administration of 
screening when the partner is with the patient can further complicate the likelihood that an 
individual will report IPV, therefore, whenever possible, these screeners should be 
completed with the patient alone. This can be difficult to manage if a packet of screeners is 
provided to patients in the waiting room, as oftentimes perpetrators accompany their 
partners in the waiting room. Therefore, the timing and type of administration should be 
carefully considered for this sensitive topic.

Type of IPV assessed

When choosing a screening tool, it can be imperative to ensure that the types of IPV one is 
hoping to screen for is included in the measure. Not all measures of IPV include an 
assessment of physical, emotional, and sexual violence. Further, most screening questions do 
not assess for control of reproductive or sexual health. This may be important information to 
obtain post-delivery when discussing future birth control methods. Therefore, individual 
clinics may decide to add questions to existing screeners.

Question types

When assessing potentially traumatic events, like IPV, the questions used concerning 
violence exposure can be an important consideration. Screening tools rely on a series of 
questions that ask if someone has ever experienced a particular type of violence. 
Behaviorally specific questions that inquire if someone has ever experience a particular 
experience (e.g., “Has your partner ever strangled you?”) can elicit more accurate responses 
than general questions (e.g., “Has your partner ever abused you?”). Behaviorally specific 
questions have been informed by decades of research and generally yield more accurate 
responses48, 49.

Cultural considerations

There are a couple of cultural considerations when choosing IPV screening tools. First, in 
some cultures, there is a strong philosophy that IPV should be “kept in the family” and not 
discussed with those outside of the family. Therefore, it may be helpful to choose screeners 
that have been validated in ethnic minority populations. Second, many screening tools 
assume that the individual is in a heteronormative monogamous relationship. Therefore, it 
may be important to assess what type of relationship(s) the individual is a part of prior to

delivering the screening tool or to choose screening tools that do not assume the partner is 
male or that there is only one partner.

Safety Planning During Pregnancy

If an individual receives a positive screen for IPV, safety planning can be an important next 
step. Depending on what the individual wants to do, safety planning may include safety 
within the relationship, safety while leaving the relationship, and safety after leaving the 
relationship. Below are some safety planning strategies that a provider can help the patient 
prepare for based on the patient’s willingness to leave the relationship.

If the individual is not willing to leave the relationship, safety planning may focus on how to 
stay safe within the relationship, which can include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Identifying safe areas of the home

Gathering important documents such as copies of birth certificates

Making copies of important financial or ownership documents

Providing assistance with contraceptive health and screening for sexual health 
issues

Practicing how to escape if needed and have an escape bag packed

Identifying individuals to call in an emergency including a local domestic 
violence shelter or national hotline with trained advocates such as the Natural 
Disaster Violence Hotline

If the individual is preparing to leave the relationship, safety planning may focus on how to 
safely leave the relationship, which can include:

•

•

•

Contacting a local domestic violence shelter or national hotline

Documenting any injuries (provider can do this during the visit and place 
pictures in the medical record)

Identifying a safe place to stay

If the individual has recently left the relationship, safety planning may focus on how to stay 
safe after leaving the relationship, which can include:

•

•

•

•

Filing for a restraining order or order of protection

Changing the route to work and/or school

Changing the locks

Alerting neighbors, family, co-workers, or school personnel to call the police if 
they see the perpetrator

The aforementioned screening tools can be used to assist with identifying when safety 
planning is needed48. After a positive screen or endorsement of IPV, safety planning 
checklists can be completed with the patient and provider. The National Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence (http://www.ncdsv.org/images/DV_Safety_Plan.pdf) provides a thorough

safety-planning checklist that includes several different strategies to assist in facilitating 
safety at various steps of responding to IPV.

Referral to Treatment

Evidence suggests that individuals are more likely to utilize interventions suggested by their 
healthcare provider50 compared to any other official personnel. Additionally, pregnancy and 
pre-conceptional periods are time when women are most amenable to take advantage of 
interventions and make significant life-style changes. Importantly, findings have 
demonstrated that, at 2-year follow-up, women provided with referrals directly from the 
healthcare provider reported less violence and assault risk, as well as decreased healthcare 
costs51.

Depending on institution or clinic resources, intervention approaches can range from 
provider brief intervention and referral to treatment to “systems level” approaches. A 
“systems level” approach to intervention has proved most successful for IPV care52. Such 
approaches are designed to transform the entire organization to focus on IPV detection and 
care. The intervention areas of these programs aim to:

1.

Create a supportive environment,

Link victims to community organizations,

Systematic inquiry and referral integrated into the electronic health record, and

Provision of on-site IPV services.

However, not all clinics have the capability for on-site IPV services. Therefore, providers 
need to be well-informed regarding local resources including local victim advocacy non-
profits, shelters, and national hotlines. Many local IPV organizations have information cards 
of local referrals that can be provided to patients. When offering referrals, providers should 
demonstrate patience and compassion as it may take IPV victims a number of visits before 
following up on recommendations. A “warm hand-off” where providers contact a local 
agency or national hotline on the phone with the patient in the office can streamline 
connecting IPV victims to referrals.

IPV is a serious public health problem that involves various forms of physical and 
psychological aggression. Exposure to IPV has negative impacts on the body’s stress 
response and autoimmune functioning, which may in part explain the association between 
perinatal IPV and a range of obstetric consequences from increased vaginal bleeding to 
stillbirths. Although these health consequences typically come to the attention of providers, 
their relationship to IPV is much harder to detect. More research is needed to understand the 
mechanisms in which perinatal IPV leads to adverse obstetrical outcomes. Given the 
ongoing nature of IPV, and the mental health sequelae, perinatal care is a critical time period 
for providers to reach this population. Proper screening procedures, safety planning, and 
referrals are important methods to combat this public health problem.

Key Points

•

•

•

Violence perpetrated by an intimate partner is estimated to occur in between 
3.7% to 9% of perinatal women.

There is a pervasive impact of perinatal IPV on several psychological and 
physical outcomes relevant to the mother and child. These include grave 
outcomes such as suicidal ideation, stillbirths, and maternal death.

Screening for IPV during perinatal health care visits is essential to detect 
women who are at risk for the adverse obstetric health outcomes, facilitate 
safety planning, and initiate referral to mental health treatment.

Common Mental Health Symptoms Among Women Exposed to IPV

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms develops after exposure to one or more 
traumatic events and is characterized by four clusters of symptoms:

•

•

•

•

Re-experiencing or intrusive thoughts and memories about the traumatic event 
and intense reactions to cues that remind the individual of the event.

Avoidance of external (e.g., people or places) and internal cues (e.g., feelings 
or thoughts)

Changes in one’s cognitions and mood including exaggerated self-blame, 
decreased interest in pleasurable activities and ability to experience positive 
emotions.

Arousal and reactivity difficulties, such as increased irritability, exaggerated 
startle response, concentration difficulties, sleep problems, hypervigilance, 
and reckless behaviors.

Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms

interest or pleasure. Symptoms include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Changes in weight or appetite
