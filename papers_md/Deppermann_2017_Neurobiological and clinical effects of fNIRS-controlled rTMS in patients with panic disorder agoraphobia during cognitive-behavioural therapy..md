Background: A relevant proportion of patients with panic disorder (PD) does not improve even though they
receive state of the art treatment for anxiety disorders such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). At the same
time, it is known, that from a neurobiological point of view, PD patients are often characterised by prefrontal
hypoactivation. Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) is a non-invasive type of neurostimulation which
can modulate cortical activity and thus has the potential to normalise prefrontal hypoactivity found in PD. We
therefore aimed at investigating the eﬀects of iTBS as an innovative add-on to CBT in the treatment for PD.
Methods: In this double-blind, bicentric study, 44 PD patients, randomised to sham or verum stimulation, re-
ceived 15 sessions of iTBS over the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in addition to 9 weeks of group CBT. Cortical
activity during a cognitive as well as an emotional (Emotional Stroop) paradigm was assessed both at baseline
and post-iTBS treatment using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and compared to healthy controls.
Results: In this manuscript we only report the results of the emotional paradigm; for the results of the cognitive
paradigm please refer to Deppermann et al. (2014).

During the Emotional Stroop test, PD patients showed signiﬁcantly reduced activation to panic-related
compared to neutral stimuli for the left PFC at baseline. Bilateral prefrontal activation for panic-related stimuli
signiﬁcantly increased after verum iTBS only. Clinical ratings signiﬁcantly improved during CBT and remained
stable at follow-up. However, no clinical diﬀerences between the verum- and sham-stimulated group were
identiﬁed, except for a more stable reduction of agoraphobic avoidance during follow-up in the verum iTBS
group.
Limitations: Limitations include insuﬃcient blinding, the missing control for possible state-dependent iTBS ef-
fects, and the timing of iTBS application during CBT.
Conclusion: Prefrontal hypoactivity in PD patients was normalised by add-on iTBS. Clinical improvement of
anxiety symptoms was not aﬀected by iTBS.

1. Introduction

With a 12-month prevalence of 2–3% (Kessler et al., 2006; Wittchen

et al., 2011), panic disorder (PD) and comorbid agoraphobia represent
a massively impairing anxiety disorder (Barlow, 2002) posing a sub-
stantial economic burden (Zaubler and Katon, 1998), and high

comorbidity and/or chronicity are frequently observed in this group of
patients (Roy-Byrne et al., 2006). Fortunately, eﬀective treatment op-
tions exist, as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has been proven
eﬀective in numerous randomised controlled studies (Bandelow et al.,
2007; Hofmann and Smits, 2008; Schmidt and Keough, 2010). More-
over, pharmacotherapy has been conﬁrmed to be beneﬁcial in the
treatment of PD with/without agoraphobia (Bandelow et al., 2008).
However, up to one third of patients do not respond suﬃciently to ei-
ther approach (Diemer et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2012). Several factors
contributing to this phenomenon have been observed, e.g. disorder
duration (Scheibe and Albus, 1996; Slaap and den Boer, 2001). Thus,
despite a wide range of treatments available, improved therapeutic
strategies for PD and agoraphobia are still needed.

From a neurobiological point of view of PD, alterations of the “fear
network” in terms of hyperactivity of subcortical structures such as the
amygdala have been consistently observed (cf. de Carvalho et al.,
2010). Concurrently, a number of imaging studies have shown hy-
poactivation of the lateral prefrontal cortex, which is indirectly linked
to the amygdala and is known to be critically involved in voluntary
emotion regulation and cognitive control (Urry et al., 2006; Kent and
Rauch, 2003; but see Dresler et al., 2013 for a comprehensive review).
Since CBT works by changing problematic cognitions and prompting
inhibitory learning (Craske et al., 2014), hypothetically, on a neuro-
biological basis, these eﬀects of CBT should be associated with in-
creased prefrontal activation which has in fact been shown in a number
of studies (for a review see Clark and Beck, 2010). By implication, one
could further conclude that directly enhancing prefrontal activation
patterns in addition to CBT might enhance CBT outcome.

Based on the principle of electro-magnetic induction, repetitive
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is capable of modulating
cortical
activity locally and non-invasively (Wassermann and
Zimmermann, 2012). RTMS applied to the prefrontal cortex has been
shown to exert antidepressant eﬀects in several sham-controlled trials
(Schutter, 2009; Berlim et al., 2013), however, inconsistent ﬁndings
exist (Herwig et al., 2007). As a potential treatment option for anxiety
disorders, the technique has so far been less investigated (Paes et al.,
2011; Zwanzger et al., 2009). Although promising results have been
demonstrated in small controlled trials, open studies and case reports
(Mantovani et al., 2007; Paes et al., 2011; Zwanzger et al., 2009;
Zwanzger et al., 2002; Dresler et al., 2009), again so far the ﬁndings are
not conclusive and further controlled studies are needed to determine
the optimal stimulation characteristics (Prasko et al., 2007) To increase
cortical activity, the rTMS protocol intermittent Theta Burst Stimula-
tion (iTBS) is recommended (Huang et al., 2005).

To evaluate cortical eﬀects of neurobiological interventions, func-
tional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a non-invasive op-
tical imaging technique that applies near-infrared light to measure task-
related alterations of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin con-
centrations (Ferrari and Quaresima, 2012; Ehlis et al., 2014). Ad-
vantages compared to fMRI-investigations are considerable: fNIRS de-
vices are mobile and allow for a more comfortable investigation
without a potentially anxiety-inducing scanner environment, which
might be particularly favourable for patients with claustrophobic dif-
ﬁculties (cf. Ohta et al., 2008).

In the present pilot study, we aimed at investigating, whether iTBS,
applied concurrently to group CBT for PD, normalises prefrontal hy-
poactivity in terms of a “trans-situal characteristic” in this group of
patients but also during speciﬁc fear-relevant situations. Do to so, we
applied a cognitive task as well as an emotional task. Whereas the re-
sults of the cognitive task and the corresponding clinical data collected
during the ﬁrst three weeks of iTBS treatment have been published in
Deppermann et al. (2014), this manuscript focuses on the results of the
emotional paradigm (Emotional Stroop task) and the clinical data
which was collected over the whole time course of CBT. More speciﬁ-
cally, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) PD/agoraphobia pa-
tients are characterised by prefrontal hypoactivation, as assessed by

fNIRS, during a task that requires emotion regulation and cognitive
control (Emotional Stroop task) compared to controls. (2) CBT and add-
on iTBS normalises these activation patterns and (3) improves clinical
symptoms. (4) Changes in fNIRS patterns are correlated with treatment
eﬃcacy.

2. Materials and methods

Inclusion criteria, implementation of fNIRS and iTBS application
were identical to the procedures described in Deppermann et al. (2014)
but, for more clarity, will be delineated again in the following sections.

2.1. Participants

The study included 44 patients, aged 18–65 years and diagnosed
with PD with/without agoraphobia according to the DSM-IV-TR
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000). PD with/without agor-
aphobia was diagnosed by experienced clinical psychologists with the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Axis I Disorders (SCID-I; First
et al., 1996; Wittchen et al., 1997). In the PD group, comorbid psy-
chiatric disorders (except for bipolar or psychotic disorder, borderline
personality disorder, acute substance abuse disorders and acute sui-
cidality) were no exclusion criteria and the intake of psychopharma-
cological medication like selective serotonin (noradrenaline) reuptake
inhibitors was permitted if the dosage had been kept stable for at least
three weeks prior to baseline assessment.

23 healthy controls with no family history of mental disorders and
no current or past mental, somatic or organic brain disorder were in-
cluded. Groups did not diﬀer with respect to gender, age, years of
education, handedness, comorbid depression or duration of illness
(Table 1). After a comprehensive study description, written informed
consent was obtained. A clinical trial registration did not take place but
the study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Universities of
Muenster and Tuebingen. All procedures were in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki in its latest version.

2.2. Design

This multicentre study combined a 9-week CBT group intervention
with a sham-controlled iTBS augmentation within the ﬁrst 3 weeks of
CBT. Patients diagnosed with PD with/without agoraphobia were ran-
domised to either sham or verum iTBS. Enrolment took place between
01/2011 and 07/2013. Patients and therapists were blinded to iTBS
group assignment (Fig. 1).

2.3. CBT

CBT (based on Margraf and Schneider (1990) and Schneider and
Margraf (1998)) was conducted as a standardised treatment by trained
clinical psychologists, who were continually supervised by experienced
clinical psychotherapists. It was administered in a 9-week group setting
(except for session 6) with a maximum of 6 patients/group. Two
booster sessions took place after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Sessions
lasted 1 ½ hours each, respectively (Fig. 1).

2.4. iTBS

After randomisation, a (sham) iTBS protocol (Huang et al., 2005)
was applied over the left PFC in 15 daily sessions which always took
place at the same time during the day for each individual patient but
could vary between patients depending on their available free time
during the ﬁrst three weeks of CBT. We used a ﬁgure-of-eight coil (MCF-
B65, 2 × 75 mm diameter, n = 34, MAGSTIM 9925-00, 2 × 70 mm,
n = 9) using a MagOption/MagPro × 100 stimulator (MagVenture,
Denmark, n = 35), and a MAGSTIM RAPID2 T/N 3567-23-02 stimu-
lator (n = 9), respectively. The rTMS coil was placed over electrode

position F3 (left dorsolateral PFC) of the international 10–20 EEG
system (Herwig et al., 2003). In order to adjust the stimulation intensity
to the individual cortical excitability, the participants` resting motor
threshold was deﬁned prior to each iTBS application and stimulation
intensity was set to 80% of it.

As a manipulation check, after all 15 iTBS sessions were completed,
the participants were asked which stimulation (verum or sham) they
believed they had received.

2.5. Outcome measures

2.5.1. Emotional Stroop task

The Emotional Stroop task consisted of 15 panic-related and 15
neutral words presented in red, green, yellow and blue. The words
belonging to the two conditions did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly with regard
to the number of letters, syllables and frequency in spoken/written
language. Furthermore, they had already been used in prior studies
(e.g., Dresler et al., 2012). Participants had to indicate the word colour
independent of its meaning via button press. It is assumed that emo-
in contrast to neutral, words bind more attention due to
tional,

emotional interference, thereby increasing reaction times (RTs) and
error rates (ERs) for emotional words. For panic-related words, this
eﬀect should be more pronounced in PD patients (Dresler et al., 2012).
All 120 trials were presented in randomised order on a black LCD
screen. A ﬁxation cross (500 ms) preceded each stimulus (1500 ms),
while the inter-trial intervals (4000–8000 ms) were randomly jittered.
We assessed RTs and ERs as indices of emotional interference.

2.5.2. fNIRS measures

FNIRS measurements were conducted using the ETG-4000 Optical
Topography System (Hitachi Medical Co., Japan). The probe set con-
sisted of 52 channels arranged in a 3 × 11 optode array (16 photo-
detectors and 17 light emitters). It was placed with its central optode of
the lowest row on FPz stretching out towards T3 and T4, respectively,
according to the 10–20 international EEG system (Jasper, 1958).

We recorded changes of the concentration of O2Hb and HHb relative
to the individual resting baseline during the Emotional Stroop task for
the two conditions neutral words and panic-related words, respectively.
The sampling frequency was set to 10 Hz. Measurements took place at
baseline just before the beginning of the treatment period (within a
range of 48 h before the ﬁrst iTBS session) as well as after the com-
pletion of all 15 iTBS sessions. In order to avoid the measurement of
acute iTBS eﬀects, the post measurement was set to be performed after
at least 12 h past the last iTBS session (please also refer to Fig. 1).

2.5.3. Clinical outcome measures

Quantitative psychometric assessment was administered at baseline,
day 7 (iTBS-7), day 14 (iTBS-14), day 21 (post-iTBS), the end of CBT
(post-CBT, week 9), and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up after CBT
(Fig. 1). The following questionnaires were used:

The Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS; Bandelow, 1997) consists of
an observer-rated and a self-rated questionnaire assessing symptoms of
PD with or without agoraphobia with reasonable reliability and validity
(Bandelow, 1997). Each item scores from 0 to 4, with higher scores
indicating higher symptom severity. We assessed the total score in-
dicating global severity on both the observer-rated and the self-rated
questionnaires, as well as 5 subscores per questionnaire: a) panic at-
tacks, b) agoraphobic avoidance, c) anticipatory anxiety, d) disability
and e) worries about health (Bandelow, 1997).

The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A; Hamilton, 1996) is an
observer-based, clinical interview assessing a comprehensive range of
anxiety symptoms. Beside a total score, the subscales “somatic anxiety”
and “psychic anxiety” can be calculated. Higher scores indicate a
stronger severity.

The Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ; Eifert et al., 2000; Hoyer
et al., 2005) is a self-report questionnaire with good reliability and
validity, designed to assess heart focused anxiety (Eifert et al., 2000;

Hoyer et al., 2005). Each item scores from 0 to 4 with higher scores
indicating stronger symptoms. Beside a total score, 3 subscales (fear,
avoidance, attention) can be calculated.

2.6. Data preparation

Matlab was used to correct for fNIRS signal changes that were not
directly due to functional changes in haemoglobin concentration re-
lated to the attended tasks and included the following steps: the data
was ﬁltered with a high pass of 0.03 and a low pass of 0.5 Hz, manual
interpolation of channels which clearly displayed technical artefacts
according to a Gaussian distribution (circumjacent channels were taken
more into account), a correlation-based signal improvement (CBSI)
procedure according to Cui et al. (2010), automatic Gaussian inter-
polation for channels where the within-subject variance exceeded four.
Due to technical problems, complete data sets were only available from
n = 20 verum-stimulated patients, n = 21 sham-stimulated patients,
and n = 21 healthy controls. The data of the remaining participants
were segmented channel-wise in an event-related manner. A time frame
of 0–16 s after stimulus onset was extracted and adjusted for linear
drifts and baseline. The resulting averaged amplitude integrals (4–10 s
after stimulus onset) were taken as the basis for statistical analyses.

For the data of the clinical assessment (HAM-A, PAS, CAQ), a last
observation carried forward analysis (LOCF) was applied, if drop-outs
or complete omissions of questionnaires between any times of mea-
surement occurred. If there were questionnaire items missing, missing
values (if < 10%) were substituted by the mean value of the subject on
the relevant scale.

2.7. Regions of interest (ROI)

To assess the eﬀects of the stimulus-related oxygenation changes as
well as iTBS treatment, regions of interest (ROIs) were deﬁned a priori.
This was done in agreement with current ﬁndings on Emotional Stroop
paradigms which are known to activate prefrontal areas (such as our
site of iTBS application) as the major neural correlate of cognitive
control (Tupak et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011; Dresler et al., 2012). The
channels, including the left and right PFC ROIs, were chosen with re-
spect to a virtual registration procedure described by Tsuzuki et al.
(2007), Singh et al. (2005), Rorden and Brett (2000) and Lancaster
et al. (2000) (Fig. 2). In order to additionally verify that the expected
activation changes were unique to the predeﬁned ROIs, a control “non-
ROI” comprising all temporal channels was deﬁned.

2.8. Statistical analyses

Baseline sample characteristics were tested with one-way ANOVAs,

channels. PFC: prefrontal cortex; colour-coded channels
were used for analyses. (For interpretation of the references

χ2- or t-tests, depending on the variable in question. Fisher's exact test
was used for analysing baseline sample characteristics if there were
fewer than ﬁve cases per category.

To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of patient blinding regarding the iTBS
treatment condition, we conducted binomial tests of the subjectively
perceived iTBS condition (test proportion: 0.5) for each group.

Regarding fNIRS data, for both ROIs, 2 × 2 × 3 repeated mea-
surement analyses of variance (RM-ANOVAs) were conducted with the
within-subject factors condition (panic-related vs. neutral words) and
time (pre vs. post iTBS treatment) and the between-subject factor group
(verum vs. sham vs. controls). An RM-ANOVA was performed for the
temporal “non-ROI”.

Behavioural data (RTs and ERs) were analysed by means of RM-

ANOVAs.

For the clinical data, 2 × 3 RM-ANOVAs were conducted with the
within-subject factor time (baseline vs. post-iTBS) and the between-
subject factor group (verum vs. sham vs. controls) considering diﬀer-
ences between the three groups on the total scores (CAQ, HAM-A, PAS
self-rated). The content of the subscales of all questionnaires was
grouped according to the topics (as outlined in the Supplementary
material) and Bonferroni-Holm-correction (Holm, 1979) was applied
within each topic.

To analyse the course of iTBS eﬀects on clinical data over time, RM-
ANOVAs (7 × 2-design) were calculated with the within-subject factor
time (from baseline to follow-up 2) and the between-subject factor
group (verum vs. sham). The following post-hoc comparisons were
conducted: baseline vs. post-iTBS, baseline vs. post-CBT, baseline vs.
follow up 1, baseline vs. follow-up 2, follow-up 1 vs. follow-up 2, post-
iTBS vs. post-CBT, post-iTBS vs. follow-up 1, and post-iTBS vs. follow-
up 2 Two-tailed t-tests for matched samples were employed for post-hoc
analyses.

Correlations (Spearman's rho) between the CBSI concentrations and
the questionnaire subscales were calculated for the sham and verum
group at baseline and post-iTBS. To do so, the diﬀerence between ac-
tivation elicited by panic-related and neutral words was calculated.
Changes in these CBSI concentrations (CBSIpost-iTBS - CBSIbaseline) were
correlated with changes in the questionnaire scores (post-iTBS - base-
line).

Behavioural data (RTs and ERs) were available from n = 46 parti-
cipants (20 controls, 14 verum, 12 sham patients). Due to technical
problems, button presses were not recorded properly for the remaining
participants and one control subject had to be excluded due a too high
ER (> 2 standard deviations). Again, it was veriﬁed that groups did not
diﬀer signiﬁcantly concerning baseline characteristics (Table 1).

3. Results

3.1. Sample characteristics

Table 1 shows the sample characteristics for the verum and sham

672

groups as well as the healthy controls. No signiﬁcant group diﬀerences
for sociodemographic variables were found for the complete sample or
the sub-sample (values in brackets) used for the analysis of the beha-
vioural data. For clinical ratings, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences existed be-
tween verum and sham group. Compared to the control group, clinical
ratings were signiﬁcantly higher for both patient groups (Table 1).

3.2. Manipulation check

3.2.1. iTBS blinding check

One patient in the sham group and three patients in the verum
group did not respond when asked about perceived group allocation. In
the verum group, 14/19 patients guessed their treatment condition
correctly, as did 16/21 in the sham group. The proportion of correct
guesses diﬀered signiﬁcantly from chance (0.5)
in both groups
(p = 0.027 for sham group, p = 0.031 for verum group).

3.2.2. Emotional Stroop task - behavioural data

For the behavioural data, there was a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of the
factor time in terms of a decrease of performance from baseline to post-
iTBS regarding RTs
(F1,42 = 4.622, p = 0.037) as well as ERs
(F1,42 = 5.6, p = 0.007). Furthermore, a signiﬁcant main eﬀect for the
factor condition (F1 42 = 180, 109, p < 0.001) and the factor group
(F2,42 = 2.42, p = 0.04) was detected for ERs only. As can be seen in
Table 2, all subjects committed more errors for panic-related words
then for neutral words but the sham-stimulated patients generally
committed the fewest errors (verum vs. sham: t24 = 2.098, p = 0.047;
controls vs. sham: t29 = 2.958, p = 0.006). There were no signiﬁcant
interactions. Mean RTs and ERs are for all groups, times and conditions
are shown in Table 2.

3.3. fNIRS data - baseline diﬀerences and treatment eﬀects

The 2 × 2 × 3 RM-ANOVAs of CBSI concentrations revealed no
signiﬁcant main eﬀects, but a signiﬁcant three- way interaction of
condition ∗ time ∗ group for both the left (F2,59 = 4.017, p = 0.023)
and right PFC (F2,59 = 3.836, p = 0.027).

For the left ROI, separate post-hoc analyses for each time point
displayed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in prefrontal activation for panic vs.
neutral words for the two PD patients groups at baseline whereby the
patients showed less prefrontal activation in response to panic than to
neutral words (sham (panic vs. neutral): t20 = −2.643, p = 0.016;
verum (panic vs. neutral): t19 = − 2.126, p = 0.047), but not at post-
iTBS. No diﬀerence was found for the control group (Fig. 3a) at either
time point.

Further post-hoc analyses of the changes of CBSI concentration over
time (baseline vs. post-iTBS) in each group separately revealed a sig-
niﬁcant eﬀect for the left PFC only in the verum group with a decrease
in activation for neutral words (t19 = 2.220, p = 0.039) and an in-
crease
post-iTBS
(t19 = − 2.454, p = 0.024) (Fig. 3b).

panic-related words

for

to

Comparing the three groups (verum, sham, controls) directly with
each other, we further found a diﬀerentiation between the verum and
the sham group for neutral words, whereby CBSI concentration was
higher in the sham group (t39 = 2.208, p = 0.033). Concerning the
right PFC, pairwise comparisons of activation for panic vs. neutral
words showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences for any group at any mea-
surement time. Similar to the results of the left PFC, there was a sig-
niﬁcant change from baseline to post-iTBS in the verum group, where
the direction of change was the same as for the left PFC (increased
t19 = −3.062, p = 0.006, de-
activation for panic-related words:
creased activation for neutral words: t19 = 2.204, p = 0.040) (Fig. 3b).
Pairwise group comparisons showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in acti-
vation patterns only for post-iTBS with less activation for panic-related
words (t39 = − 2.052, p = 0.047) and more activation for neutral
words (t39 = 2.528, p = 0.016) in the control group compared to the

verum group. The same pattern emerged when contrasting the sham
and verum group: verum-stimulated patients showed more activation
for panic-related words (t39 = − 2.054, p = 0.047) and less activation
for neutral words (t39 = 2.420, p = 0.020). There were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in CBSI concentration levels between sham and control
group for either panic-related or neutral words at any measuring time.
Regarding the RM-ANOVA for the temporal control region, no sig-

niﬁcant eﬀects were observed.

3.4. Clinical data

For the total scores (PAS-total, HAM-A total, CAQ-total), 2 × 3 RM-
ANOVAs revealed signiﬁcant main eﬀects for the factors time and
group, as well as a signiﬁcant time × group interaction (all p ≤ 0.001).
For both time points (baseline and post-iTBS), patients (verum and
sham group) scored signiﬁcantly higher on the clinical ratings than
healthy controls. Post-hoc analyses further showed that patients' scores
(verum and sham) on HAM-A-total, observer- and self-rated PAS-total
and CAQ-total decreased signiﬁcantly from baseline to post-iTBS.
However, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the verum and sham group
were found (please refer to Deppermann et al., 2014).

For the entire group of patients (verum and sham), scores of all
subscales decreased signiﬁcantly from baseline to follow-up 2 after
6 months, as shown in a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of the factor time (all
p < 0.05, for further details please refer to the supplementary mate-
rial). However, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the sham
and verum group. Additionally, a signiﬁcant interaction of time and
iTBS group was found for self-rated agoraphobic avoidance (Table 3).
Post-hoc analyses revealed, under sham iTBS, a signiﬁcant decrease
from baseline to post-CBT, follow-up 1 and follow-up 2, but a sig-
niﬁcant increase of agoraphobic symptoms from follow-up 1 to follow-
up 2. Verum iTBS resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced self-rated avoidance
behaviour for the comparisons baseline vs. post-CBT, vs. follow-up 1
and vs. follow-up 2. Also, agoraphobic symptoms declined signiﬁcantly
from post-iTBS to follow-up 1 and follow-up 2 (Table 3).

For the remaining subscales, no signiﬁcant interactions of time and

iTBS group were found.

3.5. Correlation of fNIRS patterns and clinical data

Considering changes over time (post-iTBS - baseline), no signiﬁcant

correlations were discerned for the verum or sham group.

4. Discussion

In this randomised, sham-controlled iTBS study, we set out to in-
vestigate via fNIRS whether (a) we could conﬁrm prefrontal hypoacti-
vation in PD patients (as compared to healthy controls) during an
emotional regulation task (Emotional Stroop), and if (b) this hy-
poactivation could be normalised over a course of 15 sessions of iTBS
over the left dorsolateral PFC as an add-on treatment to state-of-the-art
CBT. Additionally, we assessed the impact of iTBS on clinical symptoms
and evaluated whether changes in functional activation (as assessed via
fNIRS) correlated with clinical change.

As expected, a signiﬁcant left lateral prefrontal hypoactivation in
response to panic-related, as compared to neutral, words could be de-
tected in both patient groups, but not in the control group prior to the
beginning of treatment. The eﬀect was restricted to the left PFC. Hence,
we were able to conﬁrm a left-lateralized reduced prefrontal response
to fear-related, compared to neutral, stimuli in PD patients which did
not occur in healthy controls.

Over the course of the combined iTBS and CBT intervention, this
baseline prefrontal hypoactivation of the left PFC disappeared for both
the sham and the verum group, pointing to a general, beneﬁcial eﬀect
of CBT which is in line with previous studies investigating the neuro-
biological eﬀects of CBT (Clark and Beck, 2010). It further speaks in
favour of the assumption that one mode of action of CBT is the mod-
iﬁcation of cognitive processes which are again related to prefrontal
activation (Clark and Beck, 2010). Further, when comparing changes in
CBSI concentration over the course of add-on iTBS, signiﬁcant altera-
tions were only found for the verum group, whereby prefrontal acti-
vation decreased for neutral words and increased for panic-related
words. These results are in line with our assumption that iTBS can
enhance prefrontal activity with respect to fear-relevant stimuli. In-
terestingly, these treatment eﬀects were not only found for the left
hemisphere, where the stimulation occurred, but also for the right PFC.
Previous studies (e.g., Ilmoniemi et al., 1997) have also reported that
rTMS may cause activation changes not only in the ipsilateral, but also
the contralateral hemispheres. In contrast, the sham and control group
did not show signiﬁcant activation changes over time.

To rule out that the iTBS-eﬀect for the verum group merely re-
presented a more general measurement eﬀect without task speciﬁcity,
we tested the temporal fNIRS channels for similar alterations in CBSI
concentration. However, no signiﬁcant activation changes were re-
vealed for this cortical non-ROI, supporting an interpretation in terms

of iTBS-induced prefrontal activation changes to fear-related stimuli.
Interestingly, this conclusion, in terms of a fear-speciﬁc modulation of
prefrontal activation patterns via iTBS, is also supported by the results
of our cognitive paradigm we assessed within the same study. Here we
observed general prefrontal hypoactivation which was, however, not
aﬀected by iTBS application (Deppermann et al., 2014).

While we found signiﬁcant clinical

improvement on all ques-
tionnaires, we could not ﬁnd a general therapy-enhancing eﬀect of iTBS
in the verum group. Speciﬁcally, for the verum and sham groups, we
found a signiﬁcant improvement of clinical symptoms from the begin-
ning of treatment interventions to the end of iTBS treatment. Also,
during the complete time course of CBT, symptom severity measured on
clinical total- and subscales further improved signiﬁcantly. For the total
scores of the clinical ratings, diﬀerences between the sham and verum
group could not be found, neither after iTBS treatment nor at the end of
CBT. However, the reduction of self-rated agoraphobic avoidance was
more stable over time in the verum group. Notably, agoraphobic
avoidance in the verum group decreased with some temporal delay
after the last iTBS session. This might be due to the general eﬀect of
CBT including the exposure session. However, delayed onset of action
has also been reported for rTMS for major depression (Schutter, 2009)
and might thus be a characteristic of rTMS treatment. More studies with
adequate follow-up assessments are needed to clarify this matter. The
lack of a general therapy-enhancing eﬀect of iTBS add-on treatment
might be a ceiling eﬀect. Alternatively, the timing of iTBS relative to
CBT might have been suboptimal. We delivered iTBS during the ﬁrst
three weeks of CBT, which were dedicated to psychoeducation about
PD. In contrast, the active parts of CBT (i.e., exposure sessions) took
place after the administration of iTBS. iTBS might have a stronger
clinical eﬀect if administered at the same time as the emotional
learning, considered central to CBT (Craske et al., 2014), is actually
taking place.

Looking at correlations between CBSI concentrations and clinical
data, we could not ﬁnd an association between treatment eﬃcacy and
changes in prefrontal activation patterns.

All participants committed more errors for panic-related than for
neutral words, indicating that the Stroop paradigm did induce emo-
tional interference as intended, in line with Dresler et al. (2012). The
fact that all participants showed this eﬀect may be due to the panic-
related words (e.g. death) being associated with negative emotions not
only in patients but also in the control group. In fact, an Emotional
Stroop eﬀect for negative words has been reported for healthy subjects
(e.g. Bar-Haim et al., 2007). Surprisingly, sham-stimulated patients
generally committed the fewest errors, whereas no diﬀerences between
the verum-stimulated patients and the control group could be found.
This ﬁnding is hard to interpret, but it should be kept in mind that the
behavioural data were only analysed for a smaller subsample, possibly
causing some eﬀects that are not representative for the whole sample.
Generally, more errors were committed at the second measurement
time accompanied with an increase in RTs pointing to a motivational
decrease. The missing diﬀerences in RTs between controls and PD pa-
tients might also be due to the relatively small subsample. Another
explanation, given by De Cort et al. (2008), might be that external
stressors like the experimental set-up (which may also increase the
general stress level in the control group) can explain a missing Stroop
eﬀect.

5. Limitations

Some considerations and limitations of this study should be dis-
cussed. As in the majority of clinical rTMS studies, the insuﬃcient
blinding certainly represents a limitation. However, only patients who
received verum iTBS showed an increase of panic-speciﬁc cortical ac-
tivation not only in the left, but also in the right, PFC. This could in-
dicate a more pronounced, broader cortical activation, speciﬁcally in-
duced by verum iTBS. For future studies, sham coils evoking scalp

muscle stimulations should be used (e.g., Mennemeier et al., 2010). It
should further be considered that other factors, like state-dependent
neural baseline activity, might also have inﬂuenced iTBS eﬀects.

For future iTBS studies, it might be interesting to investigate its
potential therapeutic add-on eﬀects by systematically manipulating the
activation of fear-relevant networks preceding iTBS application, and
the timing of iTBS relative to the phase and contents of concurrent CBT.
In this context, an especially interesting attempt might be the appli-
cation of iTBS in order to enhance extinction learning. In fact, Guhn
et al. (2014) could show that activating rTMS over the medial PFC
improved the extinction of a previously conditioned fear reaction in a
group of healthy adults. Regarding clinical populations, not much re-
search exist until now. Marin et al. (2014) discusses two studies (Osuch
et al., 2009; Boggio et al., 2010) were rTMS was successfully applied for
improved extinction processes in groups of patients suﬀering from post-
traumatic stress disorder. However, the authors also emphasise that
further systematic studies are needed before establishing rTMS as an
add-on tool in clinical applications. At last it might have been inter-
esting to perform an additional fNIRS measurement after the comple-
tion of CBT and not just after the ﬁrst weeks when additional iTBS
application took place. This way it would have been possible to further
analyse the duration of iTBS eﬀects on the one hand but also the general
eﬀects of CBT on a neurobiological level in more detail.

6. Conclusion

We were able to demonstrate prefrontal hypoactivity for panic-re-
lated stimuli in PD patients, which could be normalised by add-on iTBS.
Clinical ratings signiﬁcantly improved during iTBS/CBT. No signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were found between verum and sham iTBS, except for a
more stable reduction of agoraphobic avoidance in the verum group.
Thus, the therapeutic potential of a combination of iTBS and CBT re-
quires further investigation in future studies that systematically ma-
nipulate the mental activity (e.g., fear-network activation) of patients
during iTBS, as well as the timing of iTBS relative to CBT contents.
