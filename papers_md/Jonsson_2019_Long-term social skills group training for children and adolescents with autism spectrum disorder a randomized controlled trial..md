Abstract
Social skills group training (SSGT) is widely used for intellectually able children and adolescents with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD). Previous studies indicate small to moderate effects on social communication capacities. The duration of 
most available programs is relatively short, and extended training might lead to further improvement. This randomized 
controlled trial compared an extended 24-week version of the SSGT program KONTAKT with standard care. The weekly 
sessions gradually shifted in content from acquisition of new skills to real-world application of the acquired skills. A total 
of 50 participants with ASD (15 females; 35 males) aged 8–17 years were included. The study was conducted at two child 
and adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in Sweden. The primary outcome was the Social Responsiveness Scale–Second 
Edition (SRS-2) rated by parents and blinded teachers. Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive 
behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress. Assessments 
were made at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-months follow-up. Parent-rated SRS-2 scores indicated large effects post-
treatment [− 19.2; 95% CI − 29.9 to − 8.5; p < .001, effect size (ES) = 0.76], which were maintained at follow-up (− 20.7; 
95% CI − 31.7 to − 9.7; p < .0001, ES = 0.82). These estimates indicate substantially larger improvement than previously 
reported for shorter SSGT. However, the effects on teacher-rated SRS-2 and most secondary outcomes did not reach statisti-
cal significance. Our results suggest added benefits of extended SSGT training, implying that service providers might reach 
better results by optimizing the delivery of SSGT.

Introduction

Persistent challenges in social communication and social 
interaction across multiple contexts are main characteris-
tics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [1]. Effective inter-
ventions that address these difficulties are desirable, and 
should aim to provide autistic individuals with skills that 
enable them to gain improved self-confidence and control 
over their social lives. This could, in turn, prevent negative 
outcomes associated with ASD such as comorbid mental 
disorders [2], bullying [3], loneliness [4], and school absen-
teeism [5]. Despite widespread demand, however, access 
to evidence-based interventions for individuals with ASD 
remains limited.

Social skills group training (SSGT) is an umbrella term 
for interventions applying socially instructive techniques 
and behavioral modification principles in group settings 
to  improve  social  skills,  typically  used  in  the  clinical

management of children and adolescents with ASD in the 
normative intellectual range. The interventions vary con-
siderably in their content and structure. A recent systematic 
review, including 18 trials comprising a total of 745 par-
ticipants, indicated small to moderate effect sizes for par-
ent- and observer-report (g = 0.47 and 0.40, respectively) 
and non-significant effects for teacher-report [6]. Two sub-
sequently published large-scale randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) also suggested that the gains in terms of social skills 
are limited [7, 8]. The first of these trials was a multi-center 
trial performed at six German universities with specialized 
ASD outpatient clinics, in which 228 children and adoles-
cents were randomized to 12 sessions of a group-based cog-
nitive behavioral program or treatment as usual. This study 
reported a small effect size (d = 0.33) three months after the 
intervention ended [8]. The second trial, which is the largest 
to date, was a multi-center trial conducted at 13 child and 
adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in Sweden and coordi-
nated by our research center. A total of 296 children and ado-
lescents were randomized to a 12-week version of the SSGT 
‘KONTAKT’ or standard care only. The effect, as measured 
by the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale–Second 
Edition (SRS-2) [9] three months after completed training, 
was small (d = 0.16) and only statistically significant for the 
adolescent subsample (d = 0.33) and for girls (d = 0.40) [7].
The  scientific  evidence  base  for  SSGT  in  ASD  has 
evolved from initial small pilot trials conducted in university 
settings to more recent pragmatic multi-center trials per-
formed in real-world clinical settings. Despite this progress, 
there are still major gaps in the literature. For instance, the 
SSGT interventions have rarely been tested against active 
comparators, outcome measures are often unblinded, and 
the key components and mechanisms of change are poorly 
understood [6, 10]. Specially, one important and largely 
unanswered issue is to what extent more training provides 
additional benefits [6]. By understanding the potential ben-
efits of longer periods of training, service providers would 
be able to optimize the training in terms of both costs and 
effects. The duration of most SSGT programs investigated 
in previous studies was typically no more than 3–4 months. 
A few lasted only 4–5 weeks, while two programs lasted 
as long as 20 weeks [10]. Even though the intensity varied 
across different programs, their relatively short duration is 
in stark contrast to many other common interventions for 
individuals with ASD, such as early intensive behavioral 
intervention for young children with ASD which typically 
involves many hours of training per week over years. Added 
benefits from longer periods of training would certainly 
make sense from a theoretical perspective. Prolonged peri-
ods of focused practice are generally necessary for humans to 
acquire and maintain complex skills [11]. It is unlikely that 
social skills are exceptions. While such skills are acquired 
implicitly in typical development, individuals with ASD may 

need to learn them explicitly. Still, with enduring practice a 
transition from explicit to implicit processing might occur 
[12], making the performance of the new skills more natural 
and effective over time. In particular, individuals with learn-
ing challenges in certain areas are likely to benefit from pro-
grams that allow for overlearning so that a skill can slowly 
become an integrated part of their repertoire [13]. On the 
other hand, more intense interventions might increase the 
risk of fatigue, refusal, and drop-out. It should also be noted 
that long-term training does not necessarily mean more of 
the same. In particular, longer period of training allows for 
a gradual shift in content from the acquisition of new skills 
towards the application of these skills in situations of rel-
evance for the participants’ everyday lives. Additionally, an 
incremental increase in the tailoring of the intervention for 
each unique participant is possible.

This study aimed to estimate the effects of a longer ver-
sion of SSGT KONTAKT in children and adolescents with 
ASD. The program consisted of 24 weekly sessions, with 
a gradual increase in tailoring and focus on complex skills 
in real-world situations. We hypothesized that children and 
adolescents with ASD who received the program would 
show increased social communication skills and improved 
daily  adaptation  compared  to  a  control  group  receiving 
standard care only. We also hypothesized that the interven-
tion would reduce perceived stress, general symptom sever-
ity, and increase the global level of functioning.

Method

Study design

This was a 24-week RCT evaluating the effect of an extended 
version of KONTAKT as a complement to standard care, 
compared with standard care only. The study was conducted 
at two units within the regional child and adolescent mental 
health service in Stockholm, Sweden, between March 2013 
and September 2015. To reflect clients typically referred to 
real-world clinical services, a sample of children and ado-
lescents with ASD showing diverse psychiatric comorbidity 
was recruited. The study was conducted in parallel to the 
previously published evaluation of the shorter 12-week ver-
sion of KONTAKT [7]. The designs and procedures of these 
trials were largely identical as regards outcome measures, 
recruitment strategy, and training and supervision of the staff 
delivering the intervention. The studies had three points of 
assessment: baseline, posttreatment, and 3-months follow-
up. As a consequence of the difference in duration, the post-
treatment and follow-up assessment occurred 12 weeks later 
in the present trial, which precludes direct comparisons of 
the two trials. An additional difference was that the pre-
sent trial was conducted at only two of the 13 clinical units 

1 3European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2019) 28:189–201

where the shorter version was implemented. Coordinating 
activities, data management and analysis were conducted at 
the Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska 
Institutet, KIND. The study was approved by the Ethical 
Review Board in Stockholm (2012/385-31/4) and is regis-
tered with ClinicalTrials.gov [identifier: NCT01854346].

Participants

Eligible  participants  were  children  and  adolescents 
(7–17 years) with a diagnosis of ASD (F84.0, F84.1, F84.5, 
or F84.9) according to the International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [14] established by multi-
disciplinary assessment teams in regular healthcare services 
[15], and corroborated by met ASD cut-offs (modules 3 or 
4) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) 
[16] conducted by certified examiners. Eligible participants 
also had a previously established diagnosis of ADHD (F90.0 
or F90.8), anxiety disorder (F40, F41 or F43), or depression 
(F32 or F33), corroborated by the Kiddie-Schedule of Affec-
tive Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) [17] in case of 
uncertainty. They also had an IQ > 70 determined through 
the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-third or fourth 
edition (WISC-III/IV) [18, 19]. Exclusion criteria were a 
history of clinically assessed self-injury, conduct disorder 
(F91), hyperkinetic conduct disorder (F90.1), antisocial 
personality disorder (F60.2), borderline personality disor-
der (F60.3), any form of schizophrenia or related psychotic 
disorder (F20–F29) that would interfere with participation 
or require alternative treatment, and insufficient Swedish 
language capacities.

Procedure

The participants were recruited by either self-referral or by 
referral from mental health services. After a preliminary tel-
ephone screening interview, an extended interview was con-
ducted to verify each applicant’s eligibility. Relevant medi-
cal records were checked to verify reported diagnoses and 
to collect available results from WISC-III/-IV and ADOS 
assessments. If necessary, supplementary assessments were 
performed. The participants received a 100 SEK (11 EUR) 
voucher as an incentive for participating in the trial. Written 
consent was obtained from each participant and/or parent/
guardian after the study’s aims and procedures had been 
fully explained. The assessments comprised questionnaires 
for participants, parents, teachers and clinicians and inter-
views with the participants and their parents. The trial was 
conducted at one child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient 
unit (BUP-Brommaplan) and one academic clinical outpa-
tient unit (BUP-KIND) in Stockholm. Seven licensed psy-
chologists with a mean 3.75 years (SD = 3.47) of experience 
in working with ASD conducted the training. Trainers in 

the present trial and the simultaneously performed evalua-
tion of the short version of KONTAKT were systematically 
trained on the program, including theory, supervision, and 
feedback on recorded sessions [7]. Adherence to protocol 
was maintained by giving trainers continuous supervision 
throughout the trial (monthly 3-h sessions during the first 12 
weeks, and a 1-h session every second week the following 12 
weeks). Adherence was verified by screening random sam-
ples of video-recoded sessions, using a checklist containing 
11 items regarding protocol adherence and trainer skills in 
applying basic principles of the SSGT (e.g., positive rein-
forcement, modeling, prompting). Each item was scored “0” 
for no adherence, “1” for some adherence, and “2” for full 
adherence, and a mean score was derived across the items. 
Twenty-seven video recordings were screened. With a mean 
rating of 1.65 (SD = 0.30), the overall treatment fidelity was 
deemed satisfactory.

Randomization and masking

The randomization was performed by a senior researcher 
using computer-generated random numbers (http://www.
rando m.org) stratified by age groups (children aged 7–12 
and adolescents aged 13–17). Participants in each group 
were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group 
using block randomization in a 1:1 ratio. Parents and trainers 
were aware of the treatment conditions, while teachers were 
blinded to treatment conditions. The latter was ensured by 
a teacher survey showing no awareness of group allocation 
beyond chance.

Intervention

KONTAKT is a manualized and structured group training 
for children and adolescents with ASD in the normative IQ 
range, developed in Germany [20] and adapted for Swedish 
conditions [21, 22]. It aims to improve social interaction and 
communication skills, social motivation, awareness of self 
and others, problem-solving capacities, and self-confidence. 
The program applies elements of cognitive behavioral ther-
apy, computer-based cognitive training, behavior activation, 
psychoeducation, observational learning, and parent involve-
ment applying various mandatory, recurring, and variable 
treatment formats. Training sessions focus on understand-
ing social rules and relationships, initiating social overtures, 
developing conversation skills, identifying and interpreting 
verbal and non-verbal social signals, managing conflicts, 
and developing social communication coping strategies. 
The teaching formats include individual goal identification, 
group discussions, social and role play, emotion-processing 
training, group activities, and homework assignments. Chil-
dren are trained for 60 min. and adolescents for 90 min. per 
week in groups of 4–8 participants with 2–3 trainers. The 

1 3192 

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2019) 28:189–201

Swedish version of KONTAKT has a supplementary work-
book for group leaders, participants, and parents with addi-
tional information about content for each session of the treat-
ment to enhance clinical feasibility, treatment integrity and 
adherence. There are two versions of KONTAKT: a short 
version (12 weekly sessions), and an extended version (24 
weekly sessions). As mentioned above, a large-scale RCT 
evaluating the short version has previously been published 
[7]. The extended version used in the present study is com-
posed of two modules. The first part includes the 12 sessions 
from the short version. The second part (sessions 13–24) is 
based on the first part with an enhanced individually tailored 
program for each participant. Each participant prepares for 
the second part by updating his or her goals together with the 
trainer. In the second part, each participant is also respon-
sible for leading one group session, including activities and 
discussion. Activities outside the clinic are included in the 
second part, aiming to support the implementation and gen-
eralization of the acquired skills in real-life situations. Par-
ents/caregivers participate in the first, mid and last session 
of both the first and the second part of the intervention (6 
sessions in total), and in one individual meeting between the 
first and the second part to help formulate and update goals 
for the child/adolescent. Online Resource 1 describes the 
content of each session in more detail.

Standard care

Standard care included any ongoing support or intervention 
provided by regular health-care services (child psychiatry, 
paediatrics, habilitation centers, speech and language ther-
apy). Information on the standard care for each participant 
was retrieved from their medical records. These included 
pharmacological treatments, occupational therapy, paren-
tal psychoeducation, counselling, and individual cognitive 
behaviour therapy (Table 1). All participants randomized to 
standard care were offered to take part in KONTAKT after 
completion of the trial period.

Outcome measures

The outcome measures included in the present study were 
selected based on their relevance for the clinical context in 
which the study was conducted.

Primary outcome measure

Social  communication  skills  were  measured  using  the 
SRS-2 [9]. The SRS-2 is a 65-item instrument measuring 
autistic-like traits across five domains—social awareness, 
social cognition, social communication, social motivation 
and autistic mannerisms. It has demonstrated high external 
validity, excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.97) 

and good test–retest reliability of 0.95–0.97 [23]. Both par-
ent- and teacher-rated SRS-2 were included.

Secondary outcome measures

Adaptive skills were measured using the Adaptive Behavior 
Assessment System II (ABAS-II) [24]. The ABAS-II meas-
ures adaptive behavior using nine subscales composing three 
domains – cognitive skills, social skills, and practical skills 
at home, school and leisure time. It has been standardized 
and validated in both the US [24] and Sweden [25]. The 
Swedish standardization demonstrated excellent internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.97–0.98) and acceptable cor-
relations between parents’ and teachers’ ratings (r = 0.39). 
Symptom  severity  and  clinical  impression  of  everyday 
functioning were measured using the OSU Autism Clinical 
Global Impression scale (CGI) [26] and the Developmental 
Disabilities modification of the Children’s Global Assess-
ment Scale (DD-CGAS) respectively [26]. Both instruments 
have recently been validated for Swedish conditions, show-
ing acceptable inter-rater reliability for experienced raters 
(CGI-Aut, r = 0.72; DD-CGAS, r = 0.75) and sensitivity to 
clinical change [26]. Participant stress was measured using 
the Stress in Children questionnaire (SiC) [27]. The SiC is 
a 21-item instrument measuring stress using descriptions 
of physical and emotional symptoms of stress and has dem-
onstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.86). 
Parental stress was measured using the Perceived Stress 
Scale (PSS) [28]. The PSS is a 14-item instrument measur-
ing stress related to everyday life. The Swedish translation 
has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s 
α = 0.82) [29].

Adverse events

Information about potential adverse events was extracted 
from a course evaluation completed at posttreatment and 
follow-up by the parents. The main purpose of the course 
evaluation was to identify aspects of the intervention that 
could be improved, and to collect information that would be 
useful for future implementation purposes. The question-
naire included free text questions about observed changes in 
the children and adolescent after entering the treatment and 
possible drawbacks of the training. An adverse event was 
defined as any reported occurrence, which is unfavorable 
for the participant, regardless of causality.

Statistical analyses

Primary and secondary analyses were conducted accord-
ing to intention-to-treat principles including all randomized 
participants  for  whom  data  were  available  at  baseline.

was used to provide unbiased treatment effects for primary 
and secondary outcomes. The model was specified using 
time (baseline, posttreatment, follow-up), treatment group 
(KONTAKT + standard care vs. standard care only), and the 

time by group interaction as fixed effects, with a random 
intercept for each participant. The results were presented 
as least squares means from the mixed-effect models. The 
treatment effect was expressed as the group difference in 

1 3194

the change of least squares mean scores from pretreatment 
to  posttreatment/follow-up.  The  slope  of  the  regression 
line was compared between treatment groups. Effect sizes 
(ES) were estimated by dividing the group difference in the 
change of least squares mean scores from pretreatment to 
posttreatment/follow-up by the pooled standard deviation 
at pretreatment. Throughout the manuscript, positive effect 
sizes favor SSGT. Student’s t test and Pearson’s chi-squared 
test were used to determine if the two groups differed at 
baseline. The analyses were conducted using R software ver-
sion 3.2 and IBM SPSS statistics version 24. The original 
plan was to include a comparable number of participants 
in the present trial and the simultaneously conducted RCT 
evaluating the shorter version of KONTAKT [7] (a total of 
approximately 144 participants receiving either the short or 
the long version of KONTAKT and an equivalent number of 
controls), but for practical reasons the majority of the clin-
ics involved were only prepared to implement the 12-week 
version. This resulted in a smaller sample than expected for 
the present trial and limited power to detect small to medium 
effect sizes.

Results

Study flow and sample characteristics

A total of 59 children and adolescents were assessed for 
eligibility. Out of these, N = 50 met the inclusion criteria 
and were randomly assigned to either 24 weeks of KON-
TAKT + standard  care  (n  = 23)  or  standard  care  only 
(n = 27). Six participants discontinued the training and did 
not provide data posttreatment nor at follow-up. For the par-
ent-rated measures complete posttreatment data were avail-
able for 17 (74%) participants in the KONTAKT group and 
25 (93%) participants in the control group, while complete 
follow-up data were available for 16 (70%) participants in 
the KONTAKT group and 23 (85%) participants in the con-
trol group. Complete trainer-rated posttreatment assessments 
were available for 16 (70%) participants in the KONTAKT 
group and 25 (93%) participants in the control group, while 
complete follow-up assessments were available for 18 (78%) 
participants in the KONTAKT group and 26 (96%) partici-
pants in the control group. Complete teacher-rated posttreat-
ment assessments were available for 9 (39%) participants 
in the KONTAKT group and 16 (59%) participants in the 
control group, while complete follow-up assessments were 
available for 12 (52%) participants in the KONTAKT group 
and 13 (48%) participants in the control group. Teacher-rated 
data should be interpreted with caution due to an unsatisfac-
tory rate of complete data but are still reported for transpar-
ency reasons. Figure 1 shows participant flow from recruit-
ment to follow-up.

Baseline  demographic  and  clinical  characteristics  of 
the study participants are presented in Table 1. The groups 
did not differ significantly regarding diagnosis, age, gen-
der, IQ, or comorbidity, or SRS-2 scores at baseline. The 
mean parent-rated SRS-2 at baseline was 91.13 (SD = 30.75) 
for the KONTAKT group and 88.96 (SD = 20.27) for the 
control group, indicating a social communication problem 
severity typical of ASD. The standard care provided did 
not differ significantly between the groups, with the excep-
tion that a significantly larger proportion of the KONTAKT 
group received habilitation services (e.g., assistive cogni-
tive aids and heavy weighted blankets). The small group of 
participants in the KONTAKT group receiving such ser-
vices (n  = 4) scored higher on SRS-2 pretreatment but had 
improved to the same extent as the rest of the KONTAKT 
group posttreatment and at follow-up. The demographic 
characteristic of the participating parents did not differ sig-
nificantly (Table 2).

Primary outcomes

The group by time interaction indicated a significantly larger 
change in parent-rated SRS-2 total scores for the KONTAKT

to − 8.5; p < .001; ES = 0.76) and at follow-up (treatment 
effect − 20.7; 95% CI − 31.7 to − 9.7; p < 0.0001; ES = 0.82) 
compared to the standard care group, indicating large effect 
sizes in favor of KONTAKT (Table 3; Fig. 2a). There was 
no significant group by time interaction for the teacher-rated 
SRS-2 total score posttreatment (Table 3; Fig. 2b).

Secondary outcomes

There was a statistically significant difference between the 
groups in change scores on DD-CGAS posttreatment (treat-
ment effect 5.2; 95% CI 0.2–10.2; p < 0.05; ES = 0.83), but 
the effect was no longer statistically significant at follow-
up (treatment effect 1.8; 95% CI − 3.1 to 10.2; p = 0.48; 
ES = 0.29). There was no significant group by time interac-
tions for the remaining secondary outcomes (Table 4).

Adverse events

Parent-reported course evaluations were available for 16 of 
the 23 participants (70%) in the KONTAKT group. Occur-
rences defined as adverse events were reported by a total of 
seven parents and included the following: treatment non-
response (n = 3); missed time in school (n = 1); social with-
drawal and depressed mood as a possible consequence of 
increased awareness of challenges related to ASD (n = 1); 
feeling uncomfortable/annoyed with the other group mem-
bers (n = 2). We found no indications that the subgroup 
experiencing an adverse event deteriorated on the outcome

Discussion

The present study examined the effects of 24 weekly ses-
sions of SSGT KONTAKT compared with standard care 
for children and adolescents in the normative IQ range with 
ASD. The study was conducted in real-world clinical set-
tings with a sample of children and adolescents typical of 
clients with ASD referred to child and adolescent psychiatry. 
The positive effect on parent-rated social communication 
and other autistic trait related social skills was large, both 
posttreatment and 3 months after completion. The point esti-
mate suggested a substantially larger effect than what has 
been reported for shorter SSGT programs. Thus, this study 
endorses the potential benefit of prolonged training previ-
ously voiced by young individuals undertaking shorter social 
skills training programs [31].

Parallel to the present study, a large-scale RCT evaluat-
ing the 12-week version of the KONTAKT program was 
conducted by the same research group [7]. The procedures 
of the two studies were largely identical: they were con-
ducted during the same time period within the same clini-
cal settings, used staff with comparable training, recruited 
samples in the same manner, and included samples with 
highly similar characteristics. While the evaluation of the 
shorter version of KONTAKT led us to conclude that the 
intervention is feasible and safe in routine care, the esti-
mated effects were modest and inconsistent. Three months 
after completion the participants undertaking the 12-week 
training on average had improved 11 points from baseline on 
the parent-rated SRS. As a comparison, those participating 
in the 24-week training had on average improved 23 points 
3 months after completion. Thus, the average change score 
was more than twice the magnitude for the extended version. 
A few additional RCTs evaluating SSGT programs have 
included parent-rated SRS as an outcome measure, allowing 
for a rough comparison of the change scores in the treatment 
groups. A German multi-center study evaluating a 14-week 
SSGT-program derived from KONTAKT, reported a mean

reduction of 15 points on the parent-rated SRS in the treat-
ment group 3 months after the intervention [8]. Two studies 
of an intensive 5-week program in 7–12-year-olds yielded 
an average improvement of less than 10 points [32, 33]. The 
same was true for a small study of a 15-week social skills 
program based on cognitive behavioral principles [34], and 
a pilot study comparing two different 4-week social skills 

interventions in a limited sample [35]. A somewhat larger 
change (an average improvement of 14 points) was observed 
in a trial evaluating a multimodal anxiety and social skills 
intervention for adolescents [36]. Finally, two separate RCTs 
have evaluated the 14-week Program for the Education and 
Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) in children and 
adolescents aged 11–18 years [37, 38]. The treatment group

yielded an average improvement of 10 points in one of these 
studies [38] and 22 points in the other [37]. The latter was 
the only previous study we could find with results that were 
on a par with ours.

Group differences in teacher-rated SRS and secondary 
outcome measures did not reach statistical significance in 
the present study, with the exception of trainer-rated DD-
CGAS posttreatment. However, the estimated improvement 
on these measures was comparable to those reported for 
the shorter version of KONTAKT. The previous evalua-
tion of the shorter version indicated statistically significant 
effects in favor of the intervention on several of the second-
ary measures [7], which highlights the limited precision of 
the present study and stresses the need for larger samples 
to better estimate the true effect of long-term training. The 
results on adverse effects in the present trial were compa-
rable to those previously reported for the shorter version 
[7] and underscore the importance of identifying subgroups 
that are unlikely to benefit from this particular intervention 
and monitor closely the group dynamics. Some adverse 
reactions (e.g., related to intragroup dynamics and gained 
insights) might be avoided by minor adjustments to the 
intervention. Overall, our data on adverse events serve to 

illustrate the value of such information, which has not been 
routinely monitored and reported in psychosocial interven-
tion research [40].

While our preliminary results suggest that there are ben-
efits of extended training, there are also costs such as per-
sonnel and other resources as well as time and effort on the 
part of the client. Notably, a majority of clinics involved in 
the evaluation of KONTAKT were not prepared to imple-
ment the longer version for the present trial. To use available 
resources effectively, service providers must have access to 
information that enables them to make informed decisions 
about the optimal length of the intervention in terms of both 
costs and benefits. This would require not only estimates of 
higher precision than the ones we provide here, but also a 
more detailed “dose–response” characterization. This is a 
key component of the development and evaluation of phar-
maceutical products, where any given dose provides a mix-
ture of desirable and undesirable effects [39]. Dose–response 
curves for both effectiveness and unwanted effects can help 
to clarify if a dose is beyond further beneficial effects, or if 
the risk of undesirable effects increase or decrease with the 
length or intensity of the intervention. So far, this has not 
been an integral part of the development of psychosocial

interventions. While we believe that the “dose–response” 
analogue could be useful also in this research field, inher-
ent differences between social skills training and pharmaco-
logical treatment must also be considered. A “higher dose” 
of social skills training, for instance, is not necessarily just 
more of the same. There is a natural progress in the acquisi-
tion of a new skill, from practicing the skill in a controlled 
and safe environment to applying the skill in everyday life. 
Longer training will inevitably allow for more applied and 
individualized training, once the basic skills are acquired. 
The more favorable outcome of the extended version of 
KONTAKT suggested by the present study might, therefore, 
partly be explained by qualitative rather than quantitative 
differences between the two versions of the intervention.

Future research should attempt to clarify further the 
mechanisms  involved  in  SSGT  and  its  effects.  While 
longer duration allows for overlearning and consolidation 

of acquired skills, other aspects of the intervention might 
be just as important. It is, for instance, not clear if more 
intense  treatments  over  shorter  periods  of  time  would 
have the same benefits [32, 33]. Further, the role of parent 
involvement in maintaining the training and the acquired 
skills is an important focus of future investigation. It is, 
for instance, possible that the quality of parental involve-
ment improves over time, which would favor longer inter-
ventions. To move beyond the current standard of social 
skills training, including the KONTAKT program, future 
research also needs to identify characteristics of the train-
ing where there still is potential for improvement. Modern 
approaches to skills acquisition in general (e.g., deliber-
ate practice) would point to aspects such as high-quality 
feedback, methods to maintain focused practice and moti-
vation, and strategies to move past plateaus [11]. Another 
possibility would be to find ways to effectively shape the 

1 3European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2019) 28:189–201 

199

individual’s mental representation of social situations held 
in the long-term memory, making it possible to respond 
quickly and adequately in such situation despite the inher-
ent limitations of the short-term memory [41]. These are 
not explicit components of the KONTAKT program in its 
current form.

Limitations

The present study has some limitations that deserve to be 
addressed explicitly. First, the blinded teacher ratings were 
deemed unreliable due to a large amount of missing data. 
Thus, our conclusions are mainly based on unblinded par-
ent ratings, and we cannot rule out that their assessments 
were biased. Teachers, on the other hand, reported that 
they sometimes did not have sufficient insight to be quali-
fied to assess the abilities of individual students. This is 
unfortunate since gains observed by teachers would sug-
gest that the intervention effects have generalized outside 
the  home  environment.  Many  studies  in  this  field  rely 
solely on unblinded measures which underscores the need 
for blinded assessment tools that are both valid and obtain-
able [42, 43]. Second, no head-to-head comparison with 
a shorter SSGT program was included in the trial. We 
are fairly confident that the indirect comparison with the 
short version of KONTAKT presented in the discussion 
is valid, given the almost identical procedures used in the 
two trials. A major difference between the trials was that 
the present trial was conducted at only two of the 13 clin-
ics involved in the evaluation of the short version, but we 
find it unlikely that this discrepancy had a major impact 
on the outcome. Third, as mentioned above, the relatively 
small sample size resulted in estimates of limited pre-
cision. Thus, the point estimates reported here must be 
interpreted with caution. In addition, the limited sample 
did not permit analyses of moderators and mediators of 
the training effect. The previous evaluation of KONTAKT 
suggested that the effect partly was moderated by age and 
sex [7]. It would be of paramount interest to clarify if 
these differences also remain when the training period is 
prolonged, or whether different moderators apply. Finally, 
some  of  the  interventions  received  as  part  of  standard 
care (e.g., CBT and counseling) might have content that 
partly overlaps with KONTAKT. This might have led to an 
underestimation of the true effect of KONTAKT, although 
the low number of individuals receiving such interventions 
would suggest that any such effect was minimal. Similarly, 
four participants in the KONTAKT group (and none in 
the control group) received habilitation services such as 
heavy weighted blankets and cognitive aids for structur-
ing one’s daily living. We have no reason to believe that 

this had a noteworthy impact on the results and found no 
such indications.

Conclusion

The present study suggests that a long-term SSGT program 
can result in larger gains in social skills than has previously 
been reported for shorter SSGT programs. The gains were 
maintained 3 months after completion of the training. While 
these preliminary results should be interpreted with caution, 
they hold promise that continued efforts to fine-tune the con-
tent and form of social skills training programs eventually 
could enable service providers to use their resources more 
effectively and help young people with ASD to reach their 
full potential.
