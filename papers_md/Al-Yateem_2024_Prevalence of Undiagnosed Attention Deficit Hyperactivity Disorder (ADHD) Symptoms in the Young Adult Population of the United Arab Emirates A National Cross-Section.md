Abstract
Background  Attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  a  globally  prevalent  behavioural  disorder,  remains 
underdiagnosed, particularly among adults. This issue is exacerbated in the Arab region due to stigma and insufficient 
healthcare facilities and professionals. Despite the United Arab Emirates (UAE) efforts to improve mental healthcare, 
shortcomings persist. No studies in the UAE currently assesses the appropriateness of the screening system for ADHD and 
other behavioural issues. Furthermore, prevalence rates of ADHD, particularly within the young adult population, are absent.
Aim  To estimate the prevalence of ADHD amongst young adults attending university in UAE and examine its relationship 
with gender and academic outcomes.
Methods  A cross-sectional, correlational design was used. Young adults in their first year at university were recruited from 
different academic institutions across the UAE. The study utilized the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for data 
collection.
Results  A sample of 406 young adults, aged between 18 and 20 years of age were recruited. Approximately, 34.7% 
(n = 141) reported symptoms suggestive of probable ADHD. Significantly lower grade point average marks were observed 
in participants with ADHD symptoms (M = 3.15) compared to those without (M = 3.35). Females reported symptoms of 
probable ADHD at higher rates than males, indicating possibly a potential screening deficiency and a potential stigma 
consequence.
Conclusions  The study demonstrates a high prevalence of probable ADHD in young adults, particularly among females 
attending university in the United Arab Emirates. Implications for early screening, service provision, and greater professional 
health training on this disorder are required.

1   Introduction and Background

Attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is 
recognized  as  the  most  common  behavioural  problem 
in children internationally, including in the UAE and the 
Arab region. While global estimates suggest a prevalence 
ranging between 2 and 7% [1, 2], there are no recent studies 
that have measured the prevalence of ADHD among the 
UAE population. The most recent studies specific to the 
UAE were conducted in 2009 by Eapen and in 2011 by 
Khamais [3, 4], indicating prevalence rates ranging from 
4.1% to 12.5%, respectively. In the neighbouring country

of  Saudi  Arabia,  a  recent  meta-analysis  by  Aljadani  in 
2023 reported a pooled prevalence of ADHD at 12.4% [5]. 
Research has demonstrated that screening for, diagnosis, 
and documentation of ADHD can vary and is influenced by 
multiple factors such as stigma and healthcare professionals' 
training.  This  variability  can  lead  to  ADHD  being 
underrecognized and underdiagnosed in many countries, 
including those in the Arab region [1, 2].

ADHD  often  persists  into  adulthood,  potentially 
remaining  undiagnosed  in  this  population,  leading  to  a 
high prevalence of undiagnosed ADHD among adults [6]. 
A global systematic review and meta-analysis found that 
the prevalence of persistent adult ADHD (with a childhood 
onset) was 2.58%, and that of symptomatic adult ADHD 
(regardless of childhood onset) was 6.76%. This translates 
to approximately 139.84 million and 366.33 million affected 
adults globally in 2020 [7]. In a recent systematic review 
and meta-analysis which examined outpatient psychiatric 
clinics populations, even higher rates of adult ADHD were 
noted,  ranging  from  14.61  to  26.7%  depending  on  the 
diagnosis method. The study concluded that there are high 
rates of adult ADHD among psychiatric outpatient clinics, 
confirming  again  that  many  adults  with  ADHD  may  be 
undiagnosed or underdiagnosed [8].

ADHD  is  characterized  by  persistent  patterns  of 
inattention,  hyperactivity,  and  impulsivity  that  interfere 
with functioning or development [9]. In adolescents and 
young  adults,  ADHD  can  profoundly  impact  various 
aspects of life and increase the risk for other mental health 
disorders, leading to negative outcomes such as educational 
underachievement,  difficulties  with  employment  and 
relationships, and criminality [1, 10]. It is also worth noting 
that ADHD often co-occurs with other conditions, including 
oppositional behaviour, anxiety, and social and emotional 
problems, which can further complicate the prognosis and 
management of this disorder [11].

The  lack  of  diagnosis,  combined  with  the  profound  
functional impact of ADHD in adults, underscores the need 
for increased awareness, improved diagnostic procedures, 
and  effective  treatment  strategies  for  these  conditions. 
Research has shown that mental disorders are a leading 
cause  of  disability  in  the  Arab  region.  However,  Arab 
countries face a shortage of trained healthcare professionals 
and treatment facilities, along with a dearth of reliable and 
valid assessment tools for early screening and assessment, 
and the lack of the integration of mental health services into 
the primary healthcare system further compound mental 
health care in the Arab world [12, 13].

Mental  health  and  behavioural  problems  are  often 
stigmatized in many cultures around the world, with the 
Arab region and the Middle East being a notable example. 
A systematic review of the literature on stigma associated 
with mental illness in Arab culture found a large diversity 

in stigmatizing beliefs, actions, and attitudes towards the 
treatment of mental illness within the Arab population [14]. 
Limited knowledge and capacity among primary healthcare 
professionals to identify and diagnose mental health and 
behavioural problems has also been reported [15, 16].

Over  the  last  few  years,  there  has  been  concentrated 
efforts on the part of the UAE government to improve the 
healthcare system, including mental health care services., 
such as integrating mental health into primary healthcare 
settings and a focus on providing specialist mental health 
services  [17,  18].  The  UAE  has  also  established  school 
nursing clinics with the aim to promote the health of school-
aged children through early screening and prevention of 
illness [19]. Nonetheless, there is evidence to suggest that 
further efforts are required including strengthen the care 
services provided in these school clinics, and addressing 
the persistent shortage of mental health professionals and 
enduring cultural attitudes towards mental health that can 
impacting  help-seeking  behaviour.  Moreover,  given  the 
rates of behavioural problems in children and adolescents, 
specialized  services  that  are  capable  of  screening  and 
identifying potential diagnoses are required [20–22]. This 
is because early screening for ADHD and other mental and 
behavioural problems in children is of utmost importance, 
as it can significantly improve the outcome of treatment 
and  the  long-term  prognosis  of  these  conditions  into 
adulthood [23]. Once identified, psychosocial interventions 
are recommended as the first-line treatment for preschool 
children  (4–5  years  old)  and  can  be  used  as  adjunct 
therapy in elementary school children (6–11 years old) and 
adolescents (12–17 years old) [24, 25]. These interventions 
can  include  behaviour  therapy,  parent  training,  and 
classroom accommodations. Early intervention has been 
shown  to  improve  overall  social  and  cognitive  function 
more broadly and specifically can lead to better academic 
performance, improved self-esteem, and increased overall 
well-being. What is more, there is research to indicate that by 
deploying suitable treatment and support during childhood, 
the trajectory of ADHD can be altered, potentially reducing 
the impact of these negative outcomes in adulthood [1].

Given the importance of early screening and diagnosis 
of  ADHD  in  childhood  and  the  potential  limitations  in 
the UAE mental healthcare services, this study sought to 
examine early screening and diagnosis efforts for ADHD by 
evaluating the rates of undiagnosed ADHD-like symptoms 
in the young adult population in the UAE.

1.1   Study aim

The  aim  of  the  study  was  to  estimate  the  prevalence 
rates  of  undiagnosed  ADHD-like  symptoms  among 
young adults residing in the UAE, irrespective of their 
nationality. Further, the study also sought to examine the 

1 3Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health (2024) 14:45–53 

47

impact of these rates on clinical correlates, such as gender 
differences and academic achievement of the participants.

2.3   Measure

2   Methods

This  study  used  a  quantitative,  cross-sectional, 
correlational design. This design is the most appropriate 
to estimate prevalence.

2.1   Sample and Setting

The  study  included  young  adults  who  had  graduated 
from  the  school  system  in  the  UAE  and  commenced 
their university studies, with most in their first year of 
their  studies.  These  students  had  moved  beyond  the 
health screening system usually implemented in schools 
and  primary  healthcare  centres  and  were  now  adults. 
To  examine  rates  of  undiagnosed  ADHD  symptoms, 
participants  who  self-reported  a  formal  diagnosis  of 
ADHD by a healthcare professional were excluded from 
the  study.  This  was  ascertained  through  a  screening 
question at the beginning of our survey. In determining 
our sample size, we factored in a 5% margin of error, a 
95% confidence level, and an estimated population size of 
3 million for children and young adults below the age of 
24 years [26]. The required sample size was a minimum 
of 385 participants. The achieved sample size in this study 
exceeds this required sample size.

2.2   Data Collection

Following  ethical  approval  to  undertake  the  study,  the 
research team sought approval from four main universities 
located in the north, middle, and south of the UAE. These 
universities  were  approached  because  they  cover  the 
geographical and social diversities present in the UAE, and 
their student body represents all backgrounds found in the 
country. All four universities granted permission to collect 
data.

Students  were  invited  to  participate  in  the  study  and 
were presented with a QR code directing them to the online 
survey. The first page of the survey consisted of a consent 
form, and they could only proceed with the survey if they 
agreed to the ‘participate’ option of the consent form. The 
research team remained nearby as the participants completed 
the  forms,  ready  to  assist  if  they  faced  any  difficulties, 
answer their research-related questions, and encourage them 
to answer all the questions. Data collection took place in the 
period between February and April 2023.

The  Adult  ADHD  Self-Report  Scale  (ASRS)  is  a 
commonly  used  scale  to  screen  for  attention  deficit 
hyperactivity disorder in adults. It was developed by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with 
the Workgroup on Adult ADHD and consists of 18 items 
that  correspond  to  the  18  DSM-IV  criteria  for  ADHD 
[27]. Participants are asked to answer the questions based 
on how they have felt and conducted themselves over the 
past 6 months. Participants rate themselves on a five-point 
Likert scale with options ranging from "never," "rarely," 
"sometimes," "often," to "very often." For readers' clarity, 
here are a few sample questions from the ASRS:

•  How often do you have trouble wrapping up the final 
details of a project, once the challenging parts have 
been done?

•  How often do you have difficulty getting things in order 
when you have to do a task that requires organization?
•  How  often  do  you  have  problems  remembering 

appointments or obligations?

For  a  comprehensive  view  of  the  ASRS  checklist, 

please refer to Fig. 1.

Psychometric  properties  include  the  concurrent 
validity of the ASRS, which when compared to diagnostic 
interviews for ADHD had a sensitivity score of 68.7% and 
a specificity score of 99.5% (Kessler et al., 2005). The 
discriminant validity of the scale has also been established, 
showing that the ASRS can effectively differentiate ADHD 
from conditions such as depression and anxiety [28].

The  Cronbach's  alpha  coefficients  of  the  scale  were 
measured in different studies and ranged between 0.63 and 
0.72 [27, 29, 30]. The scale has been translated and used 
with an Arabic-speaking population, and the Cronbach's 
alpha for the Arabic version of the scale was measured at 
0.717 [2, 30–32].

The  reliability  and  validity  of  both  the  Arabic  and 
English versions of the scale were initially checked in this 
study before the full-scale investigation was conducted. 
Once  the  reliability  and  validity  were  established,  the 
full  study  was  carried  out.  After  data  collection  was 
completed and during the initial stages of data analysis, 
the  Cronbach's  alpha  was  recalculated  to  confirm 
reliability. The Cronbach's Alpha for the scale was 0.78 
at the beginning of data collection, and it increased to 
0.861  at  the  conclusion  of  the  data  collection  and  the 
commencement  of  the  final  analysis.  In  addition,  both 
item-to-item and item-to-scale correlations were assessed. 
All items on the scale had a positive moderate correlation 
with each other.

2.4   Ethical Consideration

Ethical  approval  was  obtained  from  the  University  of 
Sharjah Research Ethics Committee (Ref: REC-23-03-04-
03-S). The questionnaire was electronic, and the first page 
contained the consent to participate form. Participants 
could not proceed with the study unless they agreed and 
selected  the  "agree  to  participate"  option.  The  study 
was conducted fully anonymously; no personal data was 
collected from participants.

Finally, study data was kept confidential, and access was 
restricted solely to the study team. The data was stored on 
password-protected computers and drives.

2.5   Data Analysis

First,  the  Cronbach  alpha  coefficient  was  calculated. 
The  item-to-item  correlation  and  the  item-to-total 
scale correlations were calculated to assess the internal 
consistency and construct validity of the scale.

1 3Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health (2024) 14:45–53 

Descriptive statistics were then constructed to describe 
the study sample, their demographics, and the prevalence of 
ADHD symptoms among the sample and the subgroups. The 
prevalence of ADHD consistent symptoms among participants 
was calculated using two methods reported in the literature. 
The first method is based on the initial six items in the scale 
considered to be a strong predictor of the ADHD symptoms 
among participants. Within this method, if participant shows 
more than four positive symptoms this indicates person with 
probable ADHD. The second method of calculation is to 
consider all the items of the scale. Utilizing this method, a 
participant is considered to have ADHD-like symptoms if 
they had positive responses either to six or more inattention 
questions or to six or more hyperactivity–impulsivity questions 
or both [27].

Finally, inferential statistics were performed to assess 
if there were differences between the participants who had 
ADHD-like symptoms and others, particularly in relation 
to academic performance, and to determine if a particular 
gender had a more prevalent undiagnosed ADHD symptoms 
than the other group.

3   Results

A total of 406 participants were recruited. The majority 
of  the  participants  (n = 286)  were  aged  between  18  and 
20 years of age (70%), while the remaining were either 
21–24  years  of  age  (20%,  n = 79)  or  did  not  provide 
answer. Female participants were the majority in the study, 
comprising 72% (n = 294) and the mean academic score 
for participants reflected by the mean grade point average 
was 3.28 (SD = 0.5). Table 1 present the study participants’ 
demographics.

Within  the  sample,  34.7%  (n = 141)  reported  having 
more  than  six  symptoms  of  inattention  or  hyperactivity 
or both, indicating probable ADHD. When examining the 
impact of probable ADHD on academic performance, the 
GPA scores for participants with ADHD symptoms were 
lower (M = 3.15) compared to those without the symptoms 
of ADHD (M = 3.35), which was statistically significant 
(P < 0.001). When examining differences amongst males 
and females with probable ADHD, a significantly higher 
proportion  of  participants  who  reported  symptoms 
were  females.  Table  2  presents  distribution  of  gender 
across  probable  ADHD  participants  and  their  academic 
performance (i.e. GPA).

4   Discussion

The findings of the current study suggest that there is a 
relatively  high  rate  of  probable  ADHD  amongst  young 
adults  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE).  Notably,

approximately 35.6% of the sample reported having six or 
more symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity, indicative 
of potential ADHD. This aligns with previous literature that 
has suggested ADHD is a significant issue in the region, 
though it is often underdiagnosed or undiagnosed [1, 8].

A salient finding is that the existing screening services 
appear to have failed to capture 35% of students who exhibit 
probable ADHD symptoms, which may be as a result of 
several factors. Firstly, this may reflect problematic screening 
processes  and  thus  immediately  suggests  the  need  for 
improved training for healthcare professionals, particularly 
in  primary  care  settings  where  many  young  adults  are 
likely to seek help. Secondly, the stigma associated with 
ADHD and other mental health disorders may lead to the 
underreporting of symptoms by the parents of children as 
they were young, which has been reported as a significant 
issue in Arab cultures [12, 13].

Our study revealed a notable gender difference, with a 
larger  proportion  of  female  participants  identified  with 
ADHD symptoms. While ADHD symptoms might generally 
be more prevalent in males within the broader population, 
our  findings  potentially  underscore  an  underdiagnosed 
ADHD  scenario  among  females.  This  underdiagnosis 
can arise from sociocultural expectations and prevailing 
attitudes towards female behaviour. The cultural beliefs 
associated with family honour and marital prospects might 
lead to reduced reporting of ADHD symptoms by parents of 
females. Indeed, research suggests that ADHD in girls and 
women often goes unrecognized, not only due to different 
symptom manifestations, but also because of societal biases 
and cultural nuances specific to the region [1].

The  observed  stigma  that  may  contribute  to  the 
underdiagnosis of ADHD could have several sources [33,

34]. Cultural beliefs and attitudes towards mental health 
issues  are  likely  to  play  a  significant  role,  with  mental 
health often being a stigmatized topic in the Arab region 
[35, 36]. It is also important to consider the effect of these 
cultural  attitudes  on  the  family  and  social  networks  of 
individuals. They may be less likely to seek help due to 
fear of social judgement, which can exacerbate the issue 
of  underdiagnosis.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  our 
study found a significant association between the presence 
of  ADHD  symptoms  and  lower  academic  performance, 
measured  by  GPA.  This  aligns  with  prior  research 
suggesting that ADHD can have a substantial impact on 
academic performance due to difficulties with concentration, 
organization, and time management [10]. The academic 
implications of ADHD underline the importance of early 
diagnosis and intervention, which can help mitigate these 
negative effects and improve overall outcomes for students.
This study presents valuable insights into the prevalence 
and  impact  of  ADHD  symptoms,  particularly  in  school 
settings, and the notable percentage of females who may 
be underdiagnosed due to cultural stigma. It suggests that 
healthcare professionals should bolster their understanding 
of  these  conditions  through  professional  development, 
with an increased emphasis on the potential variance in 
ADHD  manifestations  among  different  demographics. 
Schools and higher educational institutions may consider 
routine screenings for ADHD in their health protocols, as 
early detection and intervention could result in improved 
academic and social outcomes.

Moreover, the study suggests the importance of public 
awareness  campaigns  to  reduce  stigma  associated  with 
ADHD  and  increase  understanding  of  the  condition. 
Policymakers  could  consider  directing  more  resources 
towards mental health services, enhancing ADHD screening 
tools,  and  increasing  the  availability  of  professionals 
trained  in  this  field.  Inclusion  of  ADHD  education  in 
healthcare  professional  curricula  is  also  highlighted, 
emphasizing its impact on academic performance and the 
risk  of  underdiagnosis.  Although  these  findings  present 
a  noteworthy  direction,  further  exploratory  studies 
could provide a comprehensive starting point for deeper 
understanding and more tailored interventions.

5   Conclusion

In conclusion, the study demonstrated high rates of probable 
ADHD  among  young  adults  attending  university  in  the 
United Arab Emirates, particularly among females. These 
rates may imply limitations in the screening process and 
suggest the necessity for enhanced professional training, 
particularly in primary care settings. It is also crucial to 
address the stigma surrounding ADHD and mental health 
disorders which may influence symptom reporting and deter 
help-seeking behaviour, an issue known to be prominent in 
Arab cultures.

5.1   Limitation of the Study

This study provides an overall estimate of the prevalence of 
undiagnosed ADHD in the young adult population, but it has 
limitations, notably concerning selection and information 
bias. The study was not designed as a typical prevalence 
study and did not rigorously address these biases, which 
could impact the applicability and accuracy of the findings.
Selection  bias  in  this  study  could  have  arisen  from 
the voluntary participation method used for recruitment. 
Participants  who  chose  to  participate  might  differ  from 
those  who  did  not,  such  as  already  self-identifying  as 
having ADHD symptoms. This self-selection process could 
potentially affect the results, as it might not represent the 
broader young adult population accurately. Additionally, 
the  study  recruited  participants  from  universities.  This 
introduces a risk of underrepresentation of individuals with 
more severe ADHD symptoms who might not be attending 
university due to their condition.

Furthermore, information bias might have influenced the 
results. Since the study relied on self-reported data, there is 
a risk of inaccurate or incomplete information. For instance, 
participants may misreport or underreport their symptoms 
due to stigma or lack of awareness about ADHD, which 
could affect the estimate of undiagnosed ADHD prevalence. 
In conclusion, while the study provides a valuable estimate, 
further  research  with  a  more  diverse  sample  and  robust 
bias management strategies would offer a more accurate 

1 3Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health (2024) 14:45–53 

51

and generalizable understanding of undiagnosed ADHD 
prevalence among young adults.

Finally, another limitation of our study is not directly 
accounting for the unique challenges faced by first-year 
students transitioning from school to higher education. The 
stressors associated with this significant change, from new 
academic demands to social adjustments, could influence 
the presence or perception of ADHD-like symptoms. Future 
studies could benefit from considering such educational 
transitions when evaluating the prevalence and impact of 
ADHD symptoms.
