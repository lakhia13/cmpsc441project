Abstract

Purpose:  The Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program tracks 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in selected counties within Georgia as part of the Autism 
and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. ADDM Network analyses have 
historically found a higher prevalence of ASD in areas of higher socioeconomic status.

Methods:  We linked 2018 data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social 
Vulnerability Index (SVI) to two Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance 
Program counties by census tract, grouped census tracts into tertiles representing low, medium, 
and high social vulnerability, and calculated ASD prevalence for each tertile, overall and by each 
of four SVI themes.

Results:  We found that overall prevalence was higher in areas of low compared to high 
vulnerability for the socioeconomic status and transportation themes, and in areas of medium 
compared to high vulnerability for all themes. This pattern was consistent among males but varied 
for females and by race or ethnicity.

Conclusions:  Linking ASD prevalence to SVI metrics can improve the understanding of 
inequities among children with ASD in racial and ethnic minority groups or those living in 
low-resource settings. These methods can be applied to other ADDM Network surveillance sites 
and public health surveillance programs.

Purpose

Page 2

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability characterized by the 
occurrence of persistent impairments in social interaction and the presence of restricted, 
repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities [1]. The Autism and Developmental 
Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is a population-based surveillance system that 
estimates the prevalence of ASD and other developmental disabilities among children in 
selected communities throughout the U.S. [2]. ADDM is modeled after the work of the 
Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP), which 
has tracked ASD in selected counties within metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia since 1996 [3]. 
The most recent estimate of ASD prevalence among 8-year-old children in MADDSP was 
21.8/1000 (1 in 46 8-year-old children) in 2018, similar to the 23.0/1000 (1 in 44) prevalence 
seen among all ADDM Network sites in 2018 [4]. Approximately a third of children with 
ASD in ADDM also had intellectual disability (ID).

Using single census variable measures of socioeconomic status (SES) (i.e., family poverty, 
college education, and median household income), ADDM Network reports based on data 
from 2002 to 2010 showed a higher prevalence of ASD in areas of higher SES [5–7]. While 
this association has been consistent over time for MADDSP, recently there has been an 
inverse association (lower prevalence in areas of higher SES) among other ADDM Network 
sites [4]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed the Social Vulnerability 
Index (SVI) to help public health officials and emergency response planners meet the needs 
of socially vulnerable populations in emergency response and recovery efforts [8]. Use of 
the SVI has been expanded beyond disaster relief efforts and has been applied to analyses of 
public health surveillance data by examining associations with COVID-19 vaccination rates 
[9] and stay-at-home orders [10], and emergency department visits for firearm injuries [11]. 
The SVI includes 15 census-based indicators, grouped into four themes (SES, household 
composition and disability, racial and ethnic minority status and language, and housing type 
and transportation) and an overall composite measure.

We applied SVI indicators to autism surveillance data from MADDSP to evaluate the 
application of a comprehensive SVI measure to describe patterns of ASD prevalence across 
communities and assess whether the prevalence of autism and co-occurring ID vary by SVI 
measure overall, by sex, and by race or ethnicity.

MADDSP conducts surveillance for 8-year-old children with ASD every 2 years. To 
identify children, staff request records from educational sources for children who receive 
special education services and from medical sources that evaluate and treat children with 
developmental disabilities based on select International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9) or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
codes for developmental disabilities. MADDSP staff then review records and abstract 
information for children who reside in the surveillance area. MADDSP conducts its work as 
a designated agent of the Georgia Department of Public Health and through memorandums 
of understanding with education sources.

Our primary analysis focused on data collected in Georgia’s DeKalb and Gwinnett Counties 
for 2018. Children were included in the analysis if they were 8 years old (born in 2010), 
lived in the surveillance area for at least 1 day during the 2018 surveillance year and had 
an address that could be geocoded to a census tract, and met the ASD case definition. 
Children met ASD case status if they had documentation in health, service, or education 
records that they had ever received any of the following: 1) a written statement from a 
qualified professional diagnosing autism, 2) a special education classification of autism 
(either primary exceptionality of ASD or an evaluation concluding criteria for autism 
eligibility was met) in public school, or 3) an ASD ICD code (ICD-9 codes between 299.00 
and 299.99 or ICD-10 codes in the F84 range except for F84.2) obtained from administrative 
or billing information. A child was classified as having ID based on scores of ≤70 on their 
most recent test of cognitive ability or a statement from a qualified professional about a 
child’s cognitive ability in a developmental evaluation [12]. We also abstracted sex and race 
or ethnicity for each child. We excluded 56/514 (10%) of ASD cases that were included in 
the 2018 MADDSP surveillance area based on county of residence but could not be linked to 
the census tract.

We obtained SVI variables for 2018 by census tract for DeKalb and Gwinnett counties 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s publicly available SVI data [13]. 
We estimated the population of 8-year-old children by census tract using the American 
Community Survey’s 5–9-year-old population estimates [14] and dividing by 5. We linked 
SVI data to 8-year-old ASD cases and population estimates by census tract. Next, we 
grouped census tracts into tertiles, classified as areas of high, medium, and low social 
vulnerability for each SVI measure (overall, 4 themes, and 15 individual indicators). 
We refer to the SVI measures as follows: “Overall” (overall SVI measure), “SES” 
(theme one: socioeconomic status), “Household” (theme two: household composition and 
disability), “Minority” (theme three: racial or ethnic minority status and language), and 
“Transportation” (theme four: housing type and transportation). We summed ASD cases and 
population estimates by these areas and calculated prevalence per 1000 (i.e., [number of 
8-year-old children with ASD/8-year-old population] × 1000) and 95% confidence intervals 
(95% CI) overall, by sex, and by race or ethnicity. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) 
to compare the prevalence between low, medium, and high SVI tertiles; differences were 
considered statistically significant if CIs did not include 1.00. We also calculated the 
prevalence for each census tract, grouped prevalence into high, medium, and low SVI areas, 
and mapped census tracts using ArcGIS Pro [Environmental Systems Research Institute, 
Inc., Redlands, CA]. Analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4 [SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC]. Due to small sample sizes, we do not present prevalence among Asian children within 
each theme.

To examine differences over time, we conducted a secondary analysis focused on the 
association of ASD prevalence with SVI overall and for the four themes for 2014 and 
2016. This analysis used the same methods and surveillance area as described previously; 
however, the case definition for ASD in 2014 involved an additional step of clinician review. 
A detailed description of methods in classifying ASD cases and how they changed between 
years has been previously described [15].

Results

We identified 458 8-year-old children in 2018 who met the case definition for ASD. 
Eighty-three percent of the children were male; 43% of children were Black, 28% White, 
14% Hispanic, 7% Asian, and 8% other or unknown race or ethnicity (Table A1). The 
population of 8-year-old children in the surveillance area was 23,136 yielding an overall 
ASD prevalence of 19.8 (95% CI 18.1–21.7) per 1000 children.

ASD prevalence varied across SVI themes (Table 1). Prevalence was higher in areas of 
low compared to high vulnerability for the SES (PR = 1.3 [95% CI 1.03–1.66]) and 
Transportation (PR = 1.6 [95% CI 1.24–1.98]) themes, and higher in areas of medium 
compared to high vulnerability for all themes. We further explored prevalence by sex and 
race or ethnicity (Table 1). Prevalence was higher among males than females across all 
tertiles for all themes. Associations between low versus high and medium versus high 
vulnerability among males were generally the same as those seen overall. Females had 
lower prevalence in areas of low compared to high vulnerability for the Minority theme 
(PR = 0.5 [95% CI 0.31–0.97]). Black children had higher ASD prevalence than Hispanic 
and White children across all tertiles for all themes (Table 1). Among Black children, the 
prevalence was significantly higher in areas of low compared to high vulnerability for the 
SES (PR = 1.5 [95% CI 1.03–2.31]) and Household (PR = 1.6 [95% CI 1.06–2.30]) themes, 
and in areas of medium compared to high vulnerability for the SES (PR = 1.6 [95% CI 
1.13–2.13]), Household (PR = 1.5 [95% CI 1.07–2.01]), and Transportation (PR = 1.5 [95% 
CI 1.03–2.07]) themes. Among White children, the prevalence was higher in areas of low 
compared to high vulnerability for the Transportation theme (PR = 2.1 [95% CI 1.26–3.64]), 
and in areas of medium compared to high vulnerability for the Minority theme (PR = 1.8 
[95% CI 1.15–2.98]). Among Hispanic children, the prevalence was significantly higher in 
areas of low compared to high vulnerability only for the SES theme (PR = 2.0 [95% CI 
1.09–3.84]).

We also examined prevalence among the 352 children with information available on ID 
(Table 2). For children with ASD and no ID, we saw higher prevalence in areas with low 
compared to high vulnerability overall (PR = 1.8 [1.26–2.53]), and for the SES (PR = 
2.15 [95% CI 1.47–3.10]), and Transportation themes (PR = 2.3 [1.61–3.36]), and in areas 
of medium compared to high vulnerability overall (PR = 1.7 [95% CI 1.22–2.47]), and 
for the SES (PR = 2.0 [95% CI 1.37–2.86]), Household (PR = 1.7 [95% CI 1.22–2.34]) 
and Transportation themes (PR = 1.9 [95% CI 1.28–2.78]). For children with both ASD 
and ID, we saw higher prevalence in areas of low compared to high vulnerability for the 
Transportation theme (PR = 1.5 [95% CI 1.02–2.28]).

Figure 1 illustrates prevalence by tertile for each individual SVI indicator. ASD prevalence 
was higher in areas with low compared to high vulnerability for the SVI indicator of persons 
with incomes below the poverty threshold (PR = 1.4 [95% CI 1.10–1.74]), not having a 
vehicle (PR = 1.5 [95% CI 1.17–1.87]) and living in multi-unit structures (PR = 1.5 [95% 
CI 1.20–1.91]). Prevalence was higher in areas of medium compared to high vulnerability 
for all SES and Minority theme variables, civilian with a disability (PR = 1.3 [95% CI 
1.03–1.66]), and not having a vehicle (PR = 1.4 [95% CI 1.06–1.75]).

We visualized the spatial distribution of social vulnerability and ASD prevalence in our 
surveillance area (Fig. 2). We saw higher ASD prevalence throughout most of Gwinnett 
County with a mix of high, medium, and lower vulnerability. In DeKalb County, we saw 
lower prevalence and high vulnerability in the south and low vulnerability with a range of 
prevalence in the northern part of the county.

Finally, we compared 2018 ASD prevalence by tertile of SVI theme to prevalence in 2014 
and 2016 (Table 3). While case counts and prevalence were similar between years, we saw 
differences in prevalence between tertiles by year. ASD prevalence was significantly higher 
in areas of low compared to high vulnerability for the SES (PR = 1.3 [95% CI 1.03–1.66]) 
and Transportation themes (PR = 1.6 [95% CI 1.24–1.98]) in 2018, and higher in areas of 
medium compared to high vulnerability for all themes in 2018 and the SES (PR = 1.6 [95% 
CI 1.28–2.02]) and Household themes (PR = 1.3 [95% CI 1.04–1.61]) in 2016. We saw no 
significant differences between areas for any theme in 2014.

Conclusions

Disparities in the prevalence of ASD by race or ethnicity and SES have been frequently 
observed. These longstanding disparities appear to be changing, and more comprehensive 
measures can help understand these changes. The SVI includes more encompassing 
measures than the SES indicators used in previous ADDM analyses. Using these SVI 
indicators, we found that ASD prevalence was generally higher in areas of low or medium 
vulnerability compared to areas of high vulnerability. However, the opposite pattern (higher 
prevalence in areas of high vulnerability) was seen among females and Black children 
for the Minority theme. Spatially, we saw variable patterns across our surveillance area 
reinforcing the importance of examining these associations at the smallest geographical area 
possible to better understand local-level community differences.

While it may be possible that children in highly vulnerable communities are less affected 
by ASD, it is more likely that families with higher social vulnerability lack the resources 
needed to access developmental screenings which could result in an ASD diagnosis. Poverty, 
unemployment, per capita income, and living in multi-unit structures may indicate fewer 
financial resources, including health insurance, which can impact access to care. Limited 
English proficiency or not having a high school diploma may make understanding the 
processes necessary to access developmental evaluations or awareness of ASD symptoms 
more challenging, particularly when symptoms are mild. Increased access to resources that 
educate parents on child development, such as Learn the Signs. Act Early. [16], may help to 
fill this gap. Finally, not owning a vehicle or being a civilian with a disability may speak to 
physical barriers to the ability to access needed services.

The higher ASD prevalence observed among females and Black children in areas of high 
vulnerability for the Minority theme might indicate a process toward better identification of 
ASD; however, given long-standing disparities in identification among these groups [17,18], 
more remains to be done. Associations observed between SVI and ASD prevalence in 2016 
and 2018, but not in 2014 could indicate shifts in the residency of children who are the 
most socially vulnerable or a widening of disparities in access to screening and diagnoses.

Applying SVI to future MADDSP data as well as other communities within ADDM could 
help to further explain variations between years.

Using a composite measure (the SVI) to assess associations between ASD prevalence 
and social vulnerability has several advantages. In previous ADDM network analyses, the 
association of SES and ASD prevalence was examined using individual census variables 
[4,6]. These variables were linked to ASD case data by census tract and tracts were ranked 
within and between ADDM sites. This method allowed for comparisons between ADDM 
sites but could not be applied to communities outside of the network. Because SVI measures 
are ranked nationally, applying SVI to ADDM surveillance allows for broader comparisons 
between communities and potentially also other diseases or conditions. In addition, the 
SVI expands beyond SES to examine a broader set of social factors that may play a 
role in explaining disparities in the identification of ASD within a community. While our 
findings related to ASD prevalence and SES are consistent with previous ADDM Network 
findings for Georgia [4,6], associations with the other SVI themes (Transportation, Minority, 
Housing) have not been previously described.

Our results are subject to some limitations. Data collected relies on the availability and 
completeness of existing records to ascertain ASD cases. Educational data are only collected 
from public schools; information for private or homeschooled students is not included. 
Sample sizes for some groups (females, Asian, and Hispanic children) were small, thus 
limiting our ability to detect statistical differences between tertiles. Records for 106 (23%) 
of children with ASD were missing information on cognitive ability; characteristics of these 
children may differ from children without this information. Our analysis is focused on 
separate groups of 8-year-old children each year, so we cannot describe trends over time. 
Our surveillance area is composed of one part of one metropolitan area and findings may 
differ when applied to other communities. Lastly, features associated with a census tract may 
not accurately represent the experiences of everyone living within that tract.

Linking SVI information to public health surveillance data can extend understanding of 
the associations between social determinants of health and other diseases or conditions. 
Experience gained from linking MADDSP data to SVI indicators will be applied to 
inform analyses in other ADDM sites. Results from this study can be used to improve 
understanding of inequities among children with ASD in racial and ethnic minority groups 
or those living in low-resource settings. Enhanced resources within these communities can 
lead to earlier identification and provision of services to improve outcomes.
