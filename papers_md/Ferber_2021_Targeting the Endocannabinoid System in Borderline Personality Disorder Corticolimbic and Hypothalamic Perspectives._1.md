Abstract:  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD)  is  a  chronic  debilitating  psychiatric  disorder 
characterized  mainly  by  emotional  instability,  chaotic  interpersonal  relationships,  cognitive  distur-
bance  (e.g., dissociation and suicidal thoughts) and maladaptive behaviors. BPD has  a high rate of 
comorbidity with other  mental disorders  and a high burden on  society.  In this  review, we focused 
on  two  compromised  brain  regions  in  BPD -  the  hypothalamus  and  the  corticolimbic  system,  em-
phasizing the  involvement  and potential contribution of the  endocannabinoid  system  (ECS)  to im-
provement  in  symptoms  and  coping.  The  hypothalamus-regulated  endocrine  axes  (hypothalamic 
pituitary  –  gonadal,  thyroid  &  adrenal)  have  been  found  to  be  dysregulated  in  BPD.  There  is  also 
substantial  evidence  for  limbic  system  structural  and  functional  changes  in  BPD,  especially  in  the 
amygdala  and  hippocampus,  including  cortical  regions  within  the  corticolimbic  system.  Extensive 
expression of CB1  and CB2 receptors of the ECS has been found  in limbic  regions  and the hypo-
thalamus.  This  opens  new  windows  of  opportunity  for  treatment  with  cannabinoids  such  as  can-
nabidiol (CBD) as no other pharmacological treatment has shown long-lasting improvement in the 
BPD  population  to  date.  This  review  aims  to  show  the  potential  role  of  the  ECS  in  BPD  patients 
through their most affected brain regions, the hypothalamus  and the corticolimbic system. The lit-
erature  reviewed does not  allow  for general indications of treatment with CBD in BPD. However, 
there  is  enough  knowledge  to  indicate  a  treatment  ratio  of  a  high  level  of  CBD  to  a  low  level  of 
THC.  A  randomized  controlled  trial  investigating  the  efficacy  of  cannabinoid  based  treatments  in 
BPD is warranted.

1. INTRODUCTION 

  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD)  is  a  chronic  de-
bilitating  psychiatric  disorder  characterized  by  emotional 
instability,  impulsive/aggressive  behavior,  chaotic  interper-
sonal  relationships,  cognitive  disturbances,  including  disso-
ciation,  severe  functional  impairment,  suicidal  thoughts  and 
attempts,  anhedonia  and  general  resistance  to  change  to-
wards more adaptive behavior, including deficits in decision 
making and pursuing long term goals [1-7]. Alongside these 
symptoms,  BPD  has  a  high  rate  of  comorbid  mental  disor-
ders and a high burden on society [6]. 

  There is a wide agreement in the recent scientific  litera-
ture regarding the etiological pathways of BPD, showing that 
childhood  adversity  is  a  strong  risk  factor  for  future  BPD 
symptoms [8-13]. Epidemiologically, the prevalence of BPD in

the USA is between 0.5 % and 5.9% in the general population, 
with a median of 1.35% [14]. A recent epidemiological study 
found  that  about  25.2%  of  the  general  population  had  1-2 
BPD  symptoms,  3.8%  had  3-4  symptoms,  1.1%  had  5  and 
above  BPD  symptoms,  while  only  69.9%  of  the  population 
had no BPD criteria [15]. Despite the prevailing assumption 
that BPD appears more among women than men, there is no 
significant  difference  between  adult  women  and  men  in  the 
prevalence of BPD, while the pattern of comorbidities differs 
[16, 17]. 

In  an  informative  Cochrane  review  [18]  based  on  1742 
participants in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other 
clinical trials, as well as on the APA guidelines for pharma-
cological treatment of BPD, the authors concluded that some 
beneficial effects were found for antipsychotics (flupentixol 
decanoate,  haloperidol,  thiothixene),  mood  stabilizers  (car-
bamazepine, valproate semisodium, lamotrigine, topiramate) 
and dietary supplements (omega-3 fatty acids) and that anti-
depressants  such  as  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors 
(SSRIs) are not widely used, but may be useful in comorbid

states,  which  are  very  prevalent.  Others  suggest  that  treat-
ment  with  SSRIs  has  effects  on  corticolimbic  connectivity 
and  reduces  amygdala  activation,  apparently  related  to  in-
tactness of 5-HT synaptic function 1. However, SSRIs have 
not been an  established treatment for  impulsive and  aggres-
sive behaviors among BPD patients, a major feature of BPD 
[19].  Saunders  and  Silk  [20]  found  twenty  randomized  pla-
cebo-controlled  pharmacological  trials.  However,  little  con-
cordance  was  found  among  the  included  studies.  A  more 
recent study analyzed the pharmacological treatment of 2195 
inpatients  with  BPD  between  2001  and  2011  [21].  The 
authors  note  that  contrary  to  the  guidelines,  about  90%  of 
inpatients  with  BPD  received  psychotropic  drugs  [21].  Ac-
cording  to  the  APA,  total  BPD  severity  is  not  significantly 
affected by any pharmacological treatment and no promising 
results are available for the core BPD symptoms [18]. There-
fore,  novel  treatment  approaches  are  urgently  needed.  The 
aims of this review are to map the most compromised brain 
regions  in  BPD  and  to  suggest  a  novel  treatment  approach 
targeting the endocannabinoid system (ECS). 

1.1. The Hypothalamic Perspective in BPD 

  The  endocrine  axes  which  are  regulated  by  the  hypo-
thalamus  [hypothalamic  pituitary  gonadal  (HPG),  thyroid 
(HPT), and adrenal (HPA) axes] synthesize hormones in the 
hypothalamus,  the  pituitary  and  in  the  gonads,  thyroid  and 
adrenal glands, respectively. The reproductive progress with 
age is modulated by the HPG via steroid hormones. Thyroid 
hormones  regulate  energy  metabolism  and  development 
through  the  HPT  axis.  The  HPA  axis  regulates  the  organ-
ism’s reaction to stressful conditions by the secretion of glu-
cocorticoids  (GCs)  such  as  cortisol  and  corticosterone  [22]. 
These  axes  were  found  to  affect  each  other  in  a  crossover 
manner.  Proteins  involved  in  one  axis,  such  as  hormone  re-
ceptors  or  specific  enzymes,  appear  on  the  hormone-
producing  tissues  of  the  other  axis.  For  example,  androgen 
receptors  are  present  in  the  thyroid  gland  [23].  Flood  et  al. 
[23]  performed  a  promoter  analysis  and  identified  several 
thyroid  receptor-responsive  elements  in  genes  expressed  in 
gonadal tissue and androgen receptor-responsive elements in 
genes  expressed  in  thyroid  tissue.  Thus,  the  HPG  and  the 
HPT  axes  are  activated  in  concert  in  the  manner  that  genes 
from one axis activate signaling to the other [24]. 

  Testosterone,  the  major  androgen  hormone  of  the  HPG 
axis,  is  found  to  be  elevated  in  association  with  disorders 
characterized by impaired  impulse control [25],  a  main fea-
ture of BPD. Another study found increased salivary  testos-
terone  levels  in  BPD  patients  compared  to  healthy  controls 
[26].  In  addition,  increased  hair  testosterone  levels  were  re-
ported in BPD patients compared to controls [27]. Progester-
one, estradiol and estrogen are regulated by the hypothalamic 
HPG  axis.  In  BPD,  lower  levels  and  cyclical  reductions  of 
these  hormones  showed  correlation  with  impaired  cognitive 
functioning,  including  thought  ruminations,  negative  think-
ing  and  emotional  stability,  which  are  a  pivotal  part  of  the 
BPD profile [28]. Another HPG endocrinological dysregula-
tion,  a higher prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome, has 
also been reported in women with BPD [29]. Thus, relevant 
data  indicate  that  women  with  BPD  have  higher  than  ex-
pected  serum  androgen  levels  and  thus  greater  chances  of 

having polycystic ovaries. Endocrinological dysregulation of 
the  reproduction  process  in  women  has  been  found  in  nu-
merous  studies  to  be  related  to  mood  disorders,  which  are 
very common in BPD [30]. 

In the HPT axis,  the thyroid hormones  T3 and T4 are re-
leased  from  the  thyroid  gland  in  response  to  thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH), which, in turn, is released from 
the  anterior  pituitary  gland.  The  thyrotropin-releasing  hor-
mone  stimulation  test  has  been  used  to  examine  potential 
HPT  endocrinological  dysregulation  in  BPD  and  to  test  for 
biological  differences  from  depressive  states,  including  ma-
jor  depression  [31].  However,  the  results  do  not  support,  in 
general,  a  blunted  response  in  BPD  patients,  while  the  evi-
dence  is  clearer  (and  significantly  more  frequent  than  in 
BPD) for Major Depression, where about 50% of the patients 
studied showed a blunted TSH response [32, 33]. 

  TSH  is  regulated  by  a  thyrotropin-releasing  hormone 
produced from the hypothalamus. Stress reactions have been 
associated with thyroid function [34]. Increased T4 levels are 
part of stress arousal reactions, which are also a problematic 
phenomenon  in  BPD,  showing  the  activity  of  the  HPT  axis 
in stress regulation and disorders  in the stress system. Early 
trauma,  common  in  BPD  life  history,  causes  changes  in  the 
reactivity to stress [35] and may cause lasting changes in the 
thyroid levels [36]. Specifically, altered thyroid activity lev-
els,  especially  FT3/FT4,  were  associated  with  exposure  to 
adversity  in  childhood  in  women  with  BPD,  especially  if 
they reported comorbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) [36]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the 
expression of interpersonal violence and serum  T3 levels  in 
female  patients  with  BPD  in  adulthood  [37]  has  been  re-
ported,  providing  further  support  for  HPT  involvement  in 
BPD. 

  HPA axis functioning seems to be altered  in BPD as re-
activity  to  stress  is  endocrinologically  dysregulated  in  both 
men  and  women  with  BPD.  There  is  a  correlation  between 
exposure  to  early  adversity  and  the  production  of  GC  hor-
mones [38]. Since the development of the hippocampus, the 
amygdala,  and  the  frontal  lobe  continue  after  birth,  stress 
events  on  early  childhood  development  may  lead  to  a  high 
increase  of  GC  hormones,  and  consequently  to  structural, 
functional  and  epigenetic  changes  on  those  areas  [39].  The 
test  for  HPA  functioning,  combining  dexamethasone  with 
Corticotropin  Releasing  Hormone  [CRH]  (DEX-CRH),  has 
been  found  to  be  sensitive  to  trauma  history,  a  major  etio-
logical factor in BPD [9, 19, 40, 41]. 

  The  role  of  the  HPA  axis  in  BPD  is  complex  [7,  42].  It 
has  been  proposed  that  BPD  patients  show  an  imbalance 
between  activity  in  central  noradrenergic  and  cholinergic 
symptoms  associated  with  the  HPA  endocrinological  dys-
regulation [43]. Accordingly, abnormalities in noradrenergic 
activity  have  been  later  noted  for  BPD  [44].  Given  the  ab-
normalities  in  stress  reactivity  in  BPD,  the  endocrinological 
dysregulation  of  HPA  function  and  cortisol  synthesis  re-
mains  an  unresolved  question  in  the  literature  [27,  42]. 
Dettenborn et al. [27] reported no difference in cortisol levels 
between BPD patients and healthy controls, but they concede 
that  higher  baseline  levels  of  cortisol  were  reported  in  BPD 
patients in most studies, compared to healthy controls. In addi-

Ferber et al. 

tion,  only  BPD  patients  compared  with  cluster  C  personality 
disorders demonstrated reduced cortisol levels with a blunted 
cortisol and heart rate reactivity in stress tests [27, 45]. In ad-
dition,  research  on  the  HPA  axis  functioning  in  adults  with 
BPD or adolescents with repetitive non-suicidal self-injury has 
shown  increased  cortisol  awakening  response  indicating  in-
creased  HPA  axis  activity  [46].  Accordingly,  ACTH:cortisol 
ratio was higher in BPD patients than in controls and cognitive 
evaluation of a stressor was impaired [47]. The hypothalamus 
modulates arousal states, including aggression, a major pheno-
type  of  BPD,  as  shown  by  research  in  both  rodents  and  hu-
mans [48], thus leading to a more adaptive reaction to arous-
ing stimuli. 

  Although GCs start adaptive coping processes, prolonged 
or inappropriate GC secretion as in chronic stress is dysfunc-
tional. Inappropriate processing of stressful stimuli and envi-
ronments may develop in the BPD individual, thus resulting 
in a risk of developing BPD [49, 50]. 

  Gender  differences  have  also  been  observed  in  BPD. 
Women with  BPD had decreased cortisol  levels in response 
to stress, whereas male BPD individuals showed an increase 
in cortisol levels in response to the same stress test [51]. Fi-
nally, in a large meta-analysis, it has been found that cortisol 
as  a  biomarker  of  the  HPA  axis  is  a  crucial  and  helpful 
measure  in  the  study  of  BPD,  a  population  vulnerable  to 
stress,  while  confounding  factors  such  as  comorbidities 
should be taken into consideration [52]. 

in 

  An  additional  genetic  perspective  indicates  that  BPD  is 
associated  with  polymorphisms 
the  CRH  receptor 
(CRHR)  and  the  FK506  Binding  Protein  5  (FKBP5)  genes. 
Specifically,  rs4713902  and  rs9470079,  two  FKBP5  poly-
morphisms, revealed significant associations with  BPD. To-
gether,  this  information  suggests  an  association  between  a 
genetically  modified  HPA  functionality  and  BPD,  thus  sup-
porting the role of the HPA axis in BPD development [35]. 

From  an  epigenetic  perspective,  the  GR  gene  (NR3C1) 
may be relevant for BPD. Increased  methylation of the pro-
moter  region  of  the  NR3C1  gene  has  been  related  to  both 
subjects with the early history of life trauma  and to patients 
with BPD. The results of a methylation study showed a posi-
tive  association  between  methylation  of  NR3C1  and  the 
clinical severity of the BPD patients. These results show the 
nature-nurture  perspective  as 
the  gene-
environment interactions that serve as evidence for the asso-
ciation  of  NR3C1  to  childhood  trauma  and  to  the  clinical 
severity of BPD symptoms [10]. 

they  present 

  Although the state of the art of the research on these three 
hypothalamic  axes  in  BPD  is  mostly  correlational,  there  is 
mounting  scientific  evidence  for  this  association.  Basic  re-
search allowing for causal inference is warranted. 

1.2.  The  Corticolimbic  Dysfunction 
Personality Disorder 

in  Borderline  

  There is substantial evidence for dysfunction of intercon-
nectivity  between  the  limbic  system  and  the  cortex  in  BPD 
[2,  53],  with  better  corticolimbic  connectivity  found  during 
instructed  emotional  regulation  [54].  Functional  neuroimag-
ing studies have brought support for changes  in temporopa-

rietal  areas  (fusiform  gyrus,  superior  temporal  gyrus  and 
inferior  parietal  lobule)  and  fronto-limbic  regions  (inferior 
frontal  gyrus,  amygdala,  medial,  dorsolateral  and  anterior 
cingulate  prefrontal  cortices),  possibly  mediating  impaired 
affective-cognitive processing in BPD [55]. 

Imaging studies including MRI, fMRI  and PET,  showed 
heightened  sensitivity  to  emotional  stimuli  in  BPD  together 
with  the  display  of  dysfunctions  in  the  prefrontal  cortex 
(PFC;  a  key  region  in  decision  making)  and  in  the  limbic 
system  especially  the  amygdala  (a  key  region  in  emotional 
regulation)  [56-58].  This  is  evident  while  the  individual  is 
viewing or listening to emotional, fearful, or traumatic stim-
uli or even in anticipation of such a stimulus, in the presence 
of a neutral stimulus or even in the resting situation without 
a  trigger  [2,  57].  Additionally,  in  fMRI  studies,  individuals 
with BPD showed more hyperactivity of the limbic system to 
emotionally evocative stimuli such as higher amygdala reac-
tivity  to  unpleasant  pictures  and  fearful  words  compared  to 
healthy  controls  [59].  However,  no  activation  of  the 
amygdala  in BPD  and in healthy controls has been detected 
in reaction  to positive stimuli [60, 61]. Furthermore, Duque 
Alarcón  et  al.  [12]  found  that  the  level  of  childhood  mal-
treatment negatively correlated with the score in social cog-
nitive  scale,  in  BPD  and  control  groups,  but  only  the  BPD 
patients  showed  hypoconnectivity  among  the  corticolimbic 
areas, which play a significant role in emotion regulation and 
social cognition [12]. These findings highlight a neural corti-
colimbic network characterizing the dysfunctions of patients 
suffering from BPD [2, 4, 62, 63]. 

  Theories  on  the  biological  underlying  processes  of  ag-
gression, which is part of the BPD profile, implicate prefron-
tal  and  limbic  structures.  More  accurately,  a  brain-circuit 
comprising the amygdala, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal 
gray  has  been  identified  in  a  growing  body  of  literature; 
heightened activation of this circuit  may set off reactive ag-
gression  [64-66].  This  anger-prone  neural  connectivity  has 
been found in women diagnosed with BPD [67]. 

In addition, age would appear  to play a role. In  imaging 
clinical studies, while gray matter volume deficits in the lim-
bic  structures  may  become  significantly  apparent  with  ad-
vancing  age  in  the  course  of  BPD,  parieto-occipital  rather 
than  frontal  gray  matter  deficits  are  characteristics  of 
younger aged BPD patients [68]. Moreover, some of the stud-
ies showed reduced volumes in prefrontal brain areas involved 
in stress regulation, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex 
and orbitofrontal cortex [69]. 

  The interpersonal difficulties and instability of BPD were 
also  apparent  in  functional  imaging  studies  showing  on  the 
neural  level  hyperactivity  of  the  amygdala  and  other  limbic 
regions  in  response  to  social  stimuli  such  as  interpersonal 
scenes or facial expressions [70]. BPD patients also showed 
heightened  sensitivity  to  social  threat  stimuli,  expressed  in 
faster  eye  fixation  on  the  threat  and  hyperactivation  of  the 
amygdala  [71].  Thus,  individuals  with  BPD  are  deficient  in 
neurocognitive  control  capacities  regarding  social  situations 
and social stimuli. 

Finally,  while  structural  neuroimaging  studies  in  BPD 
patients  showed  reductions  in  hippocampal  volumes,  they

also  reported  an  increase  in  hypothalamic  volume  [71].  In 
addition,  the  hypothalamic  volume  was  associated  with  a 
history of trauma in BPD (Mauchnik & Schmahl [72]). Thus, 
we argued in this review that the hypothalamic-corticolimbic 
regions  are  the  most  relevant  brain  areas  involved  in  the 
BPD disorder. 

1.3. The Endocannabinoid System 

  The  ECS  consists  of  cannabinoid  receptors  (e.g.,  CB1, 
CB2),  the  endogenous  ligands  that  are  interconnected  to 
these  cannabinoid  receptors  [mainly  the  endocannabinoids 
anandamide  (N-arachidonylethanolamine,  AEA)  and  2-
arachidonoylglycerol  (2-AG)],  and  enzymes  by  which  their 
biosynthesis  and  degradation  are  achieved  [e.g.,  fatty  acid 
amide  hydrolase  (FAAH)  and  monoacylglycerol  lipase 
(MAGL)]  [73-75].  In  the  central  nervous  system,  endocan-
nabinoids  are  produced  on  demand  and  released  from  the 
postsynaptic  neural  membrane  [76].  There  are  several  brain 
regions  that express  a high density of  CB receptors, includ-
ing,  hippocampus,  amygdala  and  PFC  regions,  which  show 
compromised functioning in BPD [77]. 

  CB1  receptors  are  widely  spread  in  the  brains  of  mam-
mals  [78].  They  are  found  mostly  in  presynaptic  terminals 
where  they  decrease  neurotransmitter  (e.g.,  GABA  and  glu-
tamate)  secretion  to  the  synapse.  They  are  also  present  in  a 
variety  of  peripheral  tissues.  The  CB2  receptor  is  also  a  G 
protein-coupled receptor and is encoded by the CB2 receptor 
gene (CNR2) located at chromosome p36.11 [79]. CB2 recep-
tors  are  found  on  enteric  neurons  and  also  expressed  by  im-
mune and epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [80-
82]. They are also found in glial cells as well, and to a much 
lesser  extent,  in  neurons of several brain  regions  such  as  the 
amygdala,  hippocampus,  cerebral  cortex,  hypothalamus  and 
cerebellum  [83,  84].  However,  others  reported  that  the  com-
parison of CB2 with CB1 gene expression in the CNS resulted 
in  relatively  insignificant  levels  of  CB2  receptor  expression 
[85, 86]. 

  During  the  period  in  which  the  CB1  and  CB2  receptors 
were discovered, researchers also reported their endogenous 
ligands  and  called  them  endocannabinoids  [87-92].  Their 
precursor  is  arachidonic  acid,  and  in  general  –  they  are  lip-
ids.  AEA,  one  of  the  two  main  endocannabinoids,  does  not 
only  act  via  CB1  receptors;  it  has  additional  binding  sites, 
including the vanilloid type 1 receptor [93]. The cannabinoid 
CB2 receptors  are  activated by AEA  and 2-AG [83, 84, 91, 
94]. 

  Given  that  ECS  receptors  localization  includes  brain  re-
gions,  which  are  compromised  in  BPD,  this  review  aims  to 
show  that  targeting  the  ECS  system  may  be  beneficial  for 
BPD  on  top  of  the  conventional  treatment,  which  has  been 
shown to be insufficient. There is a growing body of litera-
ture  showing  that  the  ECS  is  involved  in  the  regulation  of 
mood,  depression  and  anxiety,  known  phenotypes  of  BPD 
[95-99].  A  study  [100]  extensively  revisited  the  potential 
role  of  the  ECS  in  depression,  anxiety  and  mood  disorders, 
as  well  as  our  recent  review  on  the  potential  treatment  for 
mood  and  anxiety  disorders  by  cannabinoids  coupled  with 
terpenes, known as the "Entourage Effect" [101]. This line of 
research  is  also  supported  by  the  existing  large  body  of 

knowledge  regarding  the  epidemiological  and  clinical  asso-
ciation between cannabis use and suicidal behavior, a central 
phenotype of both BPD and depression [102, 103] and other 
psychiatric disorders [104]. 

  Regarding impaired social interaction, which is of utmost 
importance  for  BPD  daily  functioning,  Trezza  and  Vander-
schuren  [105]  found  in  animals  that  administration  of  AEA 
transporter inhibitor increased or decreased social interaction 
in  male  rats,  depending  on  the  selectivity  of  the  inhibitor. 
Specifically, the more selective inhibitor, N-arachidonoyl-(2-
methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)  amine  (VDM11),  increased  social 
interaction,  but  this  effect  was  blocked  when  the  CB1  an-
tagonist  SR141716A  was 
injected  30  minutes  before 
VDM11. A summary of research from this group and others 
showed  a  corticolimbic  network  modulating  social  play,  in 
which  the  nucleus  accumbens  (NAcC)  is  a  central  site  for 
opioid and dopamine modulation of social play, while endo-
cannabinoid  mediation  of  social  play  relies  on  basolateral 
amygdala  [106].  Furthermore,  the  functional  interaction  be-
tween  CB1  and  mu  opioid  receptors  in  the  NAcC  in  the 
modulation  of  social  play  was  shown  both  in  rats  and  in 
mice,  including  by  studying  receptor-knockout  mice  [107]. 
This ECS-opioid interaction may be relevant for determining 
the pain threshold in BPD, especially in cases of non-suicidal 
self-injury.  In  a  recent  pilot  study,  reduced  levels  of  AEA 
have  been  found  in  the  hair  of  women  with  BPD  showing 
long  term  ECS  deficiency  compared  to  healthy  controls 
[108]. 

  Another  report  found  that  serum  levels  of  AEA  were 
higher  in  patients  with  BPD,  compared  to  patients  with 
PTSD  and  a  healthy  control  group  [109].  Overall,  the  rela-
tionship  between  plasma  endocannabinoids  and  brain  func-
tion  is  challenging  to  interpret  [110,  111],  but  the  implica-
tions  of  ECS  in  BPD  are  demonstrated  in  animal  studies  of 
BPD phenotypes and in BPD patients. 

1.4. The Endocannabinoid System and the Hypothalamus 

found,  using 

  CB1  receptors  are  located  in  the  hypothalamus  and  the 
pituitary  gland,  and  they  regulate  all  the  hypothalamic-
peripheral  endocrine  axes.  Regarding  the  HPA,  ECS  can 
regulate  HPA  axis  stress  reactivity  and  therefore,  it  could 
play  a  role  in  both  the  pathophysiology  and  treatment  of 
BPD  [97].  In  addition,  the  ECS  system  regulates  panic-like 
defense responses, which are among BPD patients' character-
istics.  Accordingly, 
intra-
it  has  been 
hypothalamic  microinjections,  that  the  endocannabinoid 
AEA  reduced  the  defensive  behavior  of  rats  via  the  CB1 
receptor  [112].  Altogether,  endocannabinoids  are  important 
regulators  of  the  physiological  HPA  reactivity  to  stress  in 
pathological  conditions,  such  as  anxiety,  phobias,  depres-
sion, and posttraumatic stress disorders [113-115]. Endocan-
nabinoids  activate  presynaptic  CB1  receptors  in  the  hypo-
thalamus [116]. The successive activation of the CB1 recep-
tor signaling pathway is directed to the inhibition of the exci-
tatory neurotransmitter glutamate and its effects on the hypo-
thalamic  paraventricular  and  supraoptic  nuclei  [116].  Thus, 
the  ECS  may  contribute  to  HPA  regulation  by  terminating 
arousal  states,  thereby  facilitating  behavioral  and  emotional 
recovery in BPD.

Ferber et al. 

It  is  well  known  that  CB1  receptors  are  present  at  very 
high levels on inhibitory (GABAergic interneurons) and at to 
lesser  extent  on  excitatory  (glutamatergic)  terminals  [117], 
as  well  as  on  neurons  expressing  dopamine  D1  receptors, 
playing a specific role in the repertoire of different emotional 
behaviors  included  in  social  and  cognitive  activities,  which 
are affected in BPD [118-120]. Thus the unique BPD pheno-
type could be due to specific involvement of  CB1 receptors 
expressed on different neuronal subpopulations. 

  Regarding  the  HPG,  a  recent  review  has  described  the 
widespread  effects  of  the  ECS  on  specific  reproductive  as-
pects such as the production of follicles, oocyte maturation, 
secretion  of  reproductive  hormones  and  processing  of  the 
fertilized embryo [121]. In a perfusion experiment, the pulsa-
tile  secretion  of  gonadotropin-releasing  hormone  (GnRH) 
was  totally  antagonized  by  a  CB1  receptor  agonist  (WIN 
55,212-2).  Thus,  the  release  of  GnRH  can  be  inhibited  by 
activating  CB1  receptors  in  the  hypothalamus,  preventing 
anterior  pituitary  stimulation  [122].  Furthermore,  Scorticati 
et  al.  [123]  found  in  male  and  ovariectomized  female  rats 
that  the  release  of  GnRH  from  the  hypothalamus  was  de-
creased  by  the  central  administration  of  AEA.  Regarding 
gonadotropins,  in  females,  while  follicle  stimulating  hor-
mone (FSH) secretion seems to be unaffected by the admini-
stration  of  exogenous  or  endogenous  cannabinoids  [124], 
several  findings  suggest  that  cannabinoids  downregulate 
blood  luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  levels  [115].  In  monkeys, 
chronic administration (18 d) of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol-
Δ9-trans-(-), the main psychomimetic component of the can-
nabis plant) was shown to block estrogen and LH surges and 
the successive elevation in progesterone [125]. However, the 
same  animals  developed  tolerance  to  the  anti-reproductive 
effect  of  the  drug  after  a  few  months  of  treatment  [126].  A 
general  agreement  relates  the  LH-inhibitory  action  of  can-
nabinoids  to  a  supra-pituitary  reactivity,  possibly  at  the  hy-
pothalamic synaptic level. This may raise concerns regarding 
potential  side  effects  on  fertility  when  treating  people  with 
BPD with cannabis based medications [127]. 

  Regarding  the  HPT,  pioneer  studies  showed  that  mari-
juana is able to decrease  TSH and  thyroid hormones in rats 
[128, 129]. However, the picture is more complex. The activa-
tion of CB1 receptors blocked the secretion of TSH and a CB1 
antagonist  returned  this  important  secretion.  Thus,  the  HPT 
CB1  receptors  are  involved  in  BPD  compromised  emotional 
and  behavioral  functioning,  but  there  is  no  agreement  in  the 
literature on  the positive  effect  of  CB1 receptor  activation  in 
this  population  [130].  Specifically,  a  negative  effect  on  the 
optimal  functioning  of  the  HPT  has  been  demonstrated  for 
THC  [131].  Opposite  results  were  reported  by  others  for 
THC activity on CB1 receptors within the HPT [132]. 

In sum, all three axes of the hypothalamic function seem 
to  be  affected  by  the  activation  of  the  ECS  receptors  in-
volved  in  their  signaling  and  regulation.  Thus  the  ECS  has 
the potential to contribute to the return of the optimal hypo-
thalamic  regulation,  which  is  impaired  in  BPD  patients, 
while its manipulation may cause considerable side effects. 

  We  note  that  endocrinological  dysregulation  of  these 
three hypothalamic  axes has been documented  in other psy-
chiatric  disorders  such  as  mood  disorders  and  anxiety  [94, 

133-139].  Thus  the  ECS  may  be  a  more  general  target  for 
modulating mood, anxiety and arousal beyond age and gen-
der considerations. 

1.5. The Endocannabinoid System within the Corticolim-
bic Structures: A new Option of Treatment 

  Endocannabinoid  tone  in  the  corticolimbic  system  is  a 
critical regulator of anxiety [140], another very common co-
occurring  disorder  in  BPD.  Extensive  expression  of  CB1 
receptors  has  been  found  in  limbic  regions  such  as  the  hip-
pocampus  and  the  medial  PFC.  Many  preclinical  studies 
show that CB1 receptors in the corticolimbic system are im-
plicated in the antidepressant and anxiolytic like phenotypes 
(e.g.,  [141,  142]).  This  may  be  directly  relevant  for  under-
standing and treating the BPD population. 

  The  ECS  is  affected  by  stress  while  at  the  same  time,  it 
modulates  stress  exposure  [143].  Early  adversity  is  one  of 
the  causes  of  the  fragility  of  the  ECS  [143]  and  one  of  the 
developmental risk factors for the occurrence of BPD later in 
life. As such, the question if the ECS has a modulatory role 
in BPD is of importance. In addition, the double facets of the 
ECS, regulating stress reactivity and, at the same time, being 
affected  by  stress,  may  play  a  significant  role  in  BPD  be-
cause  this  disorder  is  characterized  by  functional  and  emo-
tional  fluctuations  and  vulnerability  to  stressful  conditions. 
The positive impact of a functioning ECS may be apparent in 
remissions  as  well  as  in  the  reduction  in  ECS  functionality 
during breakdowns. Currently, the double facets of the ECS 
are shown in rats exposed to restricted bedding rearing con-
ditions.  Specifically,  the  physiological  evidence  shows  that 
early life stress attenuates the hormonal (HPA axis) response 
to stress, while the enhancement of anandamide levels coun-
teracts  this  effect  [144].  Chronic  stress  has  complex  effects 
on cannabinoid CB1 receptor connectivity densities in corti-
colimbic  structures.  It  has  been  found  that  repeated  stress 
produces  an  increase  in  CB1  receptor  connectivity  in  the 
PFC, a reduction in CB1 receptor connectivity in the hippo-
campus and no effect in the amygdala in adult rats. In adult 
rats, a 40-day recovery from stress resulted in a return to the 
baseline  level  of  CB1  receptor  connectivity  in  the  PFC  and 
upregulation  in  the  hippocampus,  possibly  pointing  to  a  re-
bound effect. Adolescents showed this rebound too. In con-
trast, adolescents exposed to stress showed a downregulation 
effect  in  the  CB1  receptor  in  the  PFC  in  adulthood.  These 
findings show the relevance of age to the timing of exposure 
to stress, highlighting the critical period of early life stress, a 
common aspect in BPD anamnesis, and showing its effect on 
the  CB1  receptor  in  the  corticolimbic  system  [145].  Re-
cently,  another  contribution  to  BPD  has  been  found:  THC-
induced  reductions  in  adaptive  decision-making  processes 
are  regulated  by  the  reactivity  of  prefrontal  CB1  receptors 
[133].  Signaling  by  prefrontal  or  ventral  hippocampal  CB1 
receptors regulates mesolimbic dopamine pro-hedonic activ-
ity. However, both the anxiolytic effects and the  anxiogenic 
like effects of drugs that facilitate endocannabinoid signaling 
are  correlated  with  increases  in  AEA  levels  in  the  PFC  and 
the hippocampus [146-148] indicating that these regions are 
involved  in  the  divergent  cannabinoid  effects  [149].  The 
anxiolytic-like effects [150] attributed mainly to cannabidiol 
(CBD), a major cannabinoid of the Cannabis sativa plant, are

of  major  relevance  for  BPD  emotional  regulation;  however, 
the  anxiogenic-like  effects,  attributed  mainly  to  THC,  may 
raise concern.  Thus a ratio of high CBD  levels  to low  THC 
levels  would  seem  to  be  potentially  anxiolytic  and  optimal 
for CBD features. 

  There  is  currently  a  lack  of  valid  animal  models  that 
translate  the  key  features  of  BPD  [151].  However,  impair-
ment in social behavior may be a functional outcome both in 
BPD and in other psychiatric disorders (such as anxiety and 
schizophrenia). Given that CBD has been shown to improve 
social  withdrawal  in  animal  models  of  schizophrenia  [152-
153]  and  anxiety  [85],  the  social  aspects  of  BPD  may  be 
positively affected by CBD. 

  The  potential  therapeutic  effects  of  CBD  for  psychiatric 
and  other  medical  disorders  are  being  extensively  studied 
because  it  produces  desirable  effects  without  the  psychoto-
mimetic and anxiogenic effects attributed to another derivate 
of  the  plant,  THC,  even  in  cases  of  co-administration  of 
CBD  and  THC  [154].  Neuro-imaging  studies  indicate  that 
CBD is active in brain regions that express a high density of 
CB  receptors,  including,  hippocampus,  amygdala  and  PFC, 
which  are  dysfunctional  in  BPD  patients  [95,  154].  It  has 
been  recently  reported  that  the  yet  unknown  doses  of  CBD 
optimal for psychiatric treatment severely limit its indication, 
although safety has been validated. Moreover, small samples 
in  the  few  published  human  studies  on  the  treatment  with 
CBD  in  psychiatric  disorders  do  not  yet  warrant  a  general 
indication  [85].  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  there  is  no 

published  RCT  on  CBD  treatment  of  BPD,  and  no  estab-
lished  animal  model  for  BPD.  Given  the  potential  positive 
effects of CBD, such an RCT on a large sample is warranted. 

CONCLUSION 

The  Endocannabinoid  System  in  Borderline  Personality 
Disorder 

  The  ECS  system’s  receptors  are  present  in  the  compro-
mised brain regions in BPD within the corticolimbic system 
and  the  hypothalamus.  The  conventional  psychiatric  treat-
ment  fails  to  show  long-lasting  improvement  for  BPD  pa-
tients. Targeting the ECS system with novel pharmacological 
treatments,  especially  focusing  on 
the  CB1  receptor,  
may  help  the  BPD  population,  which  is  in  great  risk  and 
without a current tool to reduce this population’s symptoms.  
the  U.S.  National  Library  of  Medicine 
According  to 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov), there  is no clinical trial  investigat-
ing the usefulness of targeting the ECS system in BPD (e.g., 
through  CB1,  CB2  or  cannabidiol),  even  though  there  are 
several clinical trials currently investigating the usefulness of 
cannabidiol  in  psychiatric  disorders  that  have  some  similar 
symptoms to BPD-such as anxiety and emotional instability. 

  Moreover,  imaging  studies  are  needed  to  shed  light  on 
the distribution and activity of the CB2 receptor. This recep-
tor  holds  promise  to  BPD,  but  unfortunately  has  been  tar-
geted  less  in  basic  studies  and  clinical  trials.  In  sum,  the 
most  relevant  regions  for  targeting  the  suggested  new  treat-
ment  with  CBD  in  BPD  patients  from  this  review  (Fig.  1), 

Fig. (1). Adverse effects of  early stress exposure are a  risk factor  for the development of Borderline Personality Disorder. This depends on 
alterations  in  the  hypothalamus  and  the  corticolimbic  system.  The  Endocannabinoid  system  may  function  as  a  modulator  through  receptor 
crosstalk in these brain regions.
