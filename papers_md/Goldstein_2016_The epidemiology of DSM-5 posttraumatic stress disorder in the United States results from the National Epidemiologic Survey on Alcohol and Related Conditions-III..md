Abstract

Objective—To present current, nationally representative U.S. findings on the past-year and 
lifetime prevalences, sociodemographic correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, associated disability, 
and treatment of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Method—Face-to-face interviews with 36,309 adults in the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic 
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions–III. PTSD, alcohol and drug use disorders, and

education and lower incomes, and rural residents. PTSD was significantly associated with a broad 
range of substance use, mood, anxiety, and personality disorders, and past-month disability. 
Among respondents with lifetime PTSD, 59.4% sought treatment; an average of 4.5 years elapsed 
from disorder onset to first treatment.

Conclusions—DSM-5 PTSD is prevalent, highly comorbid, disabling, and associated with 
delayed help seeking. Additional research is needed to elucidate relationships identified herein, 
estimate PTSD-related costs, investigate hypotheses regarding etiology, course, and treatment, and 
support decisions about resource allocation to service delivery and research. Initiatives are needed 
to destigmatize PTSD, educate the public about its treatment, and encourage affected individuals 
to seek help.

INTRODUCTION

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by intrusive, involuntary, distressing 
remembering or reexperiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and 
changes in arousal and reactivity following direct experience, witnessing, repeated or 
extreme exposure to aversive details, or learning of the occurrence to a close other of actual 
or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. The most recent nationally 
representative PTSD prevalence estimates from the United States, based on Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) [1] criteria, were 3.5% 
(past-year) [2] and 6.4% to 6.8% (lifetime) [3–5]. Past-year prevalence estimates of DSM-IV 
PTSD from nationally representative general population surveys of other high-income 
Western countries included: 0.4% in Spain, 0.5% in Germany, 0.6% in Belgium, 1.2% in the 
Netherlands, 1.4% in France, 2.1% in New Zealand, and 3.8% in Northern Ireland [6]; and 
1.3%–1.5% in Australia [7, 8]. Lifetime estimates included 2.9% in Germany [9], 5.6% in 
Sweden [10], 7.8% in the Netherlands [11], 8.8% in Northern Ireland [12], and 9.2% in 
Canada [13]. The wide cross-national variability in prevalence estimates over both time 
frames reflects factors including differences in sampling design, assessment methodology, 
and historical context, e.g., the long period of conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 
20th century [12]. Cross-national differences in exposure to traumatic events [10, 13], 
distributions of preexisting vulnerability factors, e.g., chronologically primary psychiatric 
disorders [7], propensity to appraise, react to, and report events as traumatic [9], and 
availability of both formal (e.g., health and social services) and informal supports to buffer 
the effects of stressful events may also contribute. Sociodemographic correlates of PTSD in 
general population samples have included female sex, young age, previously married status, 
and low income [3, 4, 7, 14].

DSM-IV PTSD was associated with elevated odds of comorbid lifetime drug use disorders 
(DUDs, odds ratio [OR]=1.3) nicotine dependence (OR=1.3), mood (ORs=1.4–2.7), other 
anxiety (OR=1.3–1.9), schizotypal, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders (PDs; 
ORs = 2.1–2.5), and suicide ideation and attempts (ORs = 1.8–2.0) [3, 4, 15–17]. It was also 
associated with substantial burden through impairment in major life roles [4, 18–20];

common chronic medical conditions including cardiovascular disease, arthritis, asthma, 
chronic pain, diabetes, bone and joint conditions, and gastrointestinal disorders [20–23]; and 
high rates of health service utilization [24, 25].

These findings reflect data collected >10 years ago. The definition of PTSD underwent 
substantial revision in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fifth 
Edition (DSM-5) [26–28] . Classified as an anxiety disorder under DSM-IV, PTSD was 
moved into the new category of trauma- and stressor-related disorders in DSM-5. Under 
DSM-IV, but not DSM-5, PTSD could be diagnosed in individuals only exposed (e.g., to the 
events of September 11, 2001) while watching the news on television. In addition, events 
experienced by others are now qualifying exposures only if they befall relatives or close 
friends, and deaths of close others must be violent or accidental. DSM-IV Criterion A2 
(intense fear, helplessness, or horror) has been eliminated and the avoidance/numbing 
symptom cluster has been subdivided into avoidance (Criterion C) and persistent negative 
alterations in mood and cognitions (Criterion D). Further, symptoms of irritability, angry 
outbursts, and reckless or self-destructive behavior have been added under Criterion E 
(alterations in arousal and reactivity).

In view of the burdens of psychiatric and general comorbidity, medical care utilization, and 
functional impairment and disability associated with PTSD, and the considerable changes in 
its diagnostic definition under DSM-5, current, nationally representative epidemiologic data 
from a single, uniform source are urgently needed. This is particularly true because recent 
changes in population composition and historical context, including global terrorism, 
protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and their consequences, may be associated with 
changes both in PTSD prevalence and in relationships of PTSD to sociodemographic 
characteristics, disability, and help seeking. In addition, revisions under DSM-5 to 
diagnostic definitions of disorders with which PTSD co-occurs may be associated with 
changes in patterns and magnitudes of comorbidity. There is thus a critical need for up-to-
date national information from which to estimate economic and noneconomic burdens of 
PTSD, generate hypothesis-driven etiologic, nosologic, natural history, and treatment 
studies, and inform the allocation of resources to service provision and research.

Accordingly, we report the first nationally representative findings on prevalences, 
sociodemographic correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, disability, and treatment of DSM-5 
PTSD from the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related 
Conditions-III (NESARC-III) [29].

METHODS

Sample

As described in detail elsewhere, the NESARC-III’s target population comprised civilian, 
noninstitutionalized residents aged ≥18 years of U.S. households and selected group quarters 
[29]. Counties or groups of contiguous counties comprised primary sampling units; groups 
of Census-defined blocks, secondary sampling units (SSUs); and households within sampled 
SSUs, from which eligible respondents were selected, tertiary sampling units. Black, Asian, 
and Hispanic individuals were assigned higher selection probabilities than nonminority

household members. In households (n=1661) with ≥4 eligible minority adults, 2 respondents 
were selected. Data were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to reflect the U.S. civilian 
population based on the 2012 American Community Survey [30]. These weighting 
adjustments compensated adequately for nonresponse [31] . Total sample size was 36,309, 
reflecting a household response rate of 72%, a person-level rate of 84%, and an overall rate 
of 60.1%, similar to other recent U.S. national surveys [32, 33]. All respondents provided 
informed consent. The entire research protocol was approved by the institutional review 
boards of the National Institutes of Health and Westat, Inc. Respondents received $90.00 for 
their interview participation.

Assessments

The diagnostic interview was the NIAAA Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities 
Interview Schedule–5 (AUDADIS-5) [34], designed to measure DSM-5 PTSD, alcohol 
(AUD) and nicotine (NUD) use disorders, specific DUDs, and selected mood, anxiety, 
eating, and personality disorders (PDs).

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder—Respondents were queried about 19 potentially 
traumatic events (PTEs) they may have directly experienced, and 13 that they may have 
witnessed or learned about, or to whose details they may have been repeatedly exposed as 
the events befell others. An AUDADIS-5/DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis required ≥1 event; 
respondents reporting >1 event were assessed for remaining PTSD criteria concerning the 
event they nominated as their worst trauma. Respondents had to report ≥1 symptom of 
persistent intrusion (Criterion B), ≥1 of avoidance of stimuli (Criterion C), and ≥3 each of 
negative mood or cognitive changes (Criterion D) and increased arousal (Criterion E) [35], 
following the event, yielding a relatively narrow diagnostic definition. Respondents further 
had to report duration of ≥1 month and clinically significant impairment or distress. Past-
year and prior-to-the-past-year diagnoses were combined into a lifetime measure. Test-retest 
reliability of past-year and prior-to-the-past-year PTSD diagnoses was fair (κ=0.41 and 0.44, 
respectively); reliability of the dimensional PTSD criteria scale was good (intraclass 
correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.69) [36]. Procedural validity, assessed as concordance 
between the AUDADIS-5 and the semistructured, clinician-administered Psychiatric 
Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders, DSM-5 version (PRISM-5) [37] in 
a large general population sample, was fair to moderate across time frames (κ=0.34–0.46); 
concordance of dimensional criteria scales between the instruments was good (ICC=0.69) 
[38].

Other Psychiatric Disorders—Mood disorder diagnoses included primary major 
depressive (MDD), dysthymia/persistent depressive, and bipolar I. Anxiety disorders 
included primary panic, agoraphobia, social and specific phobias and generalized anxiety 
(GAD). Primary AUDADIS-5/DSM-5 mood and anxiety diagnoses excluded substance- and 
medical illness-induced cases. In addition to mood and anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, 
bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder and antisocial, schizotypal and borderline PDs 
were assessed.

Diagnostic criteria for AUD, NUD, and 10 specific categories of DUDs were operationalized 
in extensive AUDADIS-5 questions. Specific DUD diagnoses were aggregated to yield any 
past-year and any lifetime DUD. Consistent with DSM-5, lifetime AUD, NUD, and DUD 
diagnoses required ≥2 of 11 criteria related to the same substance either in or prior to the 
past year. Prior-to-past-year diagnoses required clustering of ≥2 criteria for the same 
substance in the same year.

As detailed elsewhere [36], test-retest reliability of AUDADIS-5 diagnoses and symptom 
scales in a large general population sample was mainly fair to excellent. Procedural validity, 
assessed as concordances between AUDADIS-5 and PRISM-5 diagnoses, were mostly fair 
to good; between their dimensional criteria scales, mainly good to excellent [38, 39].

Disability—Past-month disability was assessed with the 12-Item Short Form Health 
Survey, version 2 (SF-12v2) [40], a reliable and valid measure widely used in population 
surveys. SF-12v2 scales included in this study were Mental Component Summary (MCS), 
Social Functioning, Role Emotional Functioning, and Mental Health. Each has a score mean 
of 50, standard deviation of ±10, and a range of 0–100, lower scores indicating greater 
disability.

Statistical Analysis

All analyses utilized SUDAAN, version 11.0 [41], to account for the NESARC-III’s 
complex sample design. We estimated prevalences of lifetime exposures to specific PTEs, 
identification of particular events as worst traumas among respondents reporting any 
exposures, and PTSD by sociodemographic correlates using weighted percentages, and 
computed weighted means for continuous correlates of PTSD. We compared prevalences of 
events by PTSD status and sex using χ2 statistics with 1 degree of freedom. ORs obtained 
from multivariable logistic regressions estimated associations of PTSD with each 
sociodemographic characteristic, adjusted for all others. We estimated associations with 
psychiatric comorbidity using logistic regressions that adjusted for sociodemographic 
characteristics and all other substance use and psychiatric disorders, testing the hypothesis 
that PTSD is associated with pure (non-comorbid) forms of other disorders of interest. 
Eating disorders were too rare to assess comorbid associations with PTSD, but were adjusted 
for in comorbidity analyses. We assessed relationships of past-year PTSD to SF-12v2 scales 
using normal-theory regression. Regression (β) coefficients estimate associations of past-
year PTSD with SF-12v2 scale scores, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and 
additional past-year psychiatric comorbidity.

RESULTS

Prevalence, Onset, and Sociodemographic Correlates

Past-year and lifetime prevalences (%±SE) of PTSD were 4.7%±0.17 and 6.1%±0.21, 
respectively, with mean age±SE at first onset 23.7±0.38 years. Table 1 shows prevalences 
and ORs of PTSD by sociodemographic characteristics. Odds were significantly elevated in 
women, respondents who self-identified as Native Americans versus non-Hispanic whites, 
respondents aged <65, and those previously married, with <high school education, and with

family incomes <$70,000. PTSD was significantly less prevalent among self-identified non-
Hispanic Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic respondents, and Midwestern and 
urban residents.

Lifetime Trauma Histories and Most Stressful Events

In the total sample, 68.6% of respondents reported ≥1 PTE. Almost all queried events were 
reported significantly more frequently by respondents with than without PTSD (Table 2). 
Respondents with PTSD most commonly reported, in descending order of frequency, sexual 
abuse before age 18, seeing a dead body or body parts, victimization by intimate partner 
violence (IPV), own serious or life-threatening injury, and own serious or life-threatening 
illness. As shown in Supplementary eTable 1, men with PTSD were significantly more likely 
than women with PTSD to report own serious injury, seeing a dead body, injury in a terrorist 
attack, non-IPV physical assault, being mugged, combat, being a civilian in a war zone, 
juvenile incarceration, and exposure to someone else’s serious injury, kidnapping, and 
seeing a dead body. Women with PTSD were significantly more likely than men with PTSD 
to report sexual abuse before age 18, sexual assault in adulthood, physical abuse before age 
18, IPV victimization, being stalked, and exposure to someone else’s sexual assault in 
adulthood and someone else being stalked. Among respondents without PTSD, 66.5% 
reported ≥1 event, most commonly someone else’s serious illness, seeing a dead body, own 
serious illness, someone else’s serious injury, and own serious injury.

Percentages of respondents reporting any PTEs who identified specific events as their worst 
traumas are given in Table 3. Respondents with PTSD most commonly endorsed, in 
descending order, sexual abuse before age 18, IPV victimization, seeing a dead body, 
someone else’s serious injury, and own serious injury. Those without PTSD most commonly 
endorsed someone else’s serious illness, seeing a dead body, own serious illness, someone 
else’s serious injury, and own serious injury. Respondents with PTSD were significantly 
more likely than those without to nominate sexual abuse before age 18, sexual assault in 
adulthood, physical abuse before age 18, IPV victimization, being stalked, and combat, but 
less likely to endorse own serious illness, seeing a dead body, natural disaster, being 
mugged, serving as a peacekeeper, refugee status, or being exposed to adversities befalling 
others, including: someone else’s serious injury, serious illness, injury in a terror attack, 
natural disaster, sexual abuse before age 18, IPV victimization, non-IPV physical assault, 
kidnapping, and mugging. As shown in Supplementary eTable 1, men with PTSD were 
significantly more likely than women with PTSD to endorse own serious injury, own serious 
illness, seeing a dead body, combat, juvenile incarceration, and someone else’s serious 
illness, but women with PTSD were significantly more likely than men with PTSD to 
endorse sexual abuse before age 18, sexual assault in adulthood, IPV victimization, and 
being stalked.

Comorbidity

After adjustment for sociodemographic and diagnostic covariates, associations were 
statistically significant and positive with all examined past-year and lifetime disorders 
(ORs=1.2–3.3) except past-year AUD (Table 4). Associations were strongest with borderline 
and schizotypal PDs.

Disability and Treatment Utilization

Mean±SE MCS, Social Functioning, Role Emotional Functioning, and Mental Health scores 
on the SF12-v2 for respondents with versus without past-year PTSD are shown in Table 5. 
Unadjusted mean scores were 9 (Role Emotional) to 10 (Social Functioning, Mental Health, 
and MCS) points lower among respondents with than among those without PTSD. After 
adjustment for sociodemographics and additional past-year psychiatric comorbidity, 
differences by PTSD status were highly significant (β=−3.2 to −3.8, all ps < 0.001). Among 
respondents with lifetime PTSD, 59.4% reported any treatment, most commonly (54.6%) 
talking with a health care provider, counselor, or therapist, or prescribed medication 
(33.7%); self-help and support groups (17.2%), emergency department visits (11.7%) and 
inpatient hospitalizations (10.9%) were less frequent. Among help seekers, mean±SE age at 
first treatment was 28.2±0.57 years, reflecting a 4.5-year average lag from first onset of 
PTSD.

DISCUSSION

Past-year (4.7%) and lifetime (6.1%) prevalences of DSM-5 PTSD represent 10,972,986 and 
14,411,005 affected U.S. adults, respectively. Broadly consistent with previous findings [3, 
4, 42, 43], prevalences were higher among women and respondents aged <65 years, 
previously married, and with <high school education and household income <$70,000. Rates 
were also higher among Native American, but lower among Asian and Pacific Islander and 
Hispanic, versus non-Hispanic white, respondents, and lower among urban than rural 
residents. Past-year PTSD was less likely among Midwestern than Western residents. Taken 
together, these results indicate the need to characterize risk and protective factors, and 
underlying mechanisms, related to sociodemographic characteristics to improve 
understanding of the etiologies of both exposure to PTEs and PTSD and tailor prevention 
and intervention appropriately to subgroups at risk [3, 43].

In the total NESARC-III sample, lifetime prevalence of PTE exposure (68.6%) was higher 
than reported by Kessler et al. [42] based on DSM-III-R criteria, but lower than those in 
recent studies [3, 22, 44, 45] based on DSM-IV, including Wave 2 of the NESARC. These 
differences likely reflect the broader range of qualifying events in DSM-IV than DSM-III-R 
or DSM-5. Nevertheless, rank-orderings of the most common exposures, particularly among 
respondents with PTSD, and differences by sex, were generally similar to those reported 
previously [4, 42–44].

Respondent-reported worst traumas showed somewhat less consistency with previous 
results. Pietrzak et al. [4] found that respondents with DSM-IV PTSD most often reported 
serious illness or injury and unexpected death of someone close, sexual assault, seeing a 
dead body, and military combat as their worst events; those without PTSD, these 2 events, 
indirect experience of September 11, 2001 (e.g., television or radio broadcast), seeing a dead 
body, and own serious injury. Again, these divergences may reflect the tightening of 
Criterion A under DSM-5. Sex differences in endorsement among respondents with PTSD 
likewise reflected both convergence with (combat, seeing a dead body, own serious injury, 
sexual assault, and IPV victimization) and divergence from (own and someone else’s serious 
illnesses, being stalked, someone else’s serious illness or injury) previous findings [4].

Taken together, the present results are consistent with previous findings that assaultive 
trauma, including IPV and sexual abuse or assault, confers particularly high risk for PTSD 
[42, 46, 47], possibly reflecting potential for physical injury, self-blame, and social stigma 
[48–50]. Further, higher prevalences and endorsement as worst trauma of childhood sexual 
abuse, which commonly co-occurs with numerous other early-life adversities [51, 52], 
versus later sexual assaults are compatible with evidence that early trauma and cumulative 
adversity are associated with increased risk of PTSD following later trauma [53–56]. The 
present findings on the frequency with which respondents, particularly those with PTSD, 
reported serious illness and injury befalling others as traumatic events add to the evidence 
that indirect trauma exposure is associated with the development of PTSD [4, 57, 58].

After adjustment for sociodemographic and diagnostic covariates, and despite many changes 
in diagnostic definitions under DSM-5, associations of both 12-month and lifetime PTSD 
with substance use, mood, anxiety, and PD comorbidity were remarkably similar to those 
observed for lifetime DSM-IV PTSD by Pietrzak et al. [4, 15]. Stronger associations with 
adjustment only for sociodemographic characteristics (data not shown) suggest that factors 
common to PTSD and comorbid disorders partly explain the magnitudes of the associations. 
However, persistence of significant relationships after adjustment for additional comorbidity 
suggests important, unique disorder-specific contributors. These results, along with findings 
from previous epidemiologic [3, 4, 15, 59, 60] and genetic studies [61, 62], call for further 
study of factors underlying comorbidity with PTSD.

Past-year PTSD was significantly associated with all domains of disability as assessed by 
the SF-12v2 scales examined in this study, reflecting broadly ranging impairment in 
functioning even after sociodemographic characteristics and additional past-year psychiatric 
comorbidity were taken into account. Together with its substantial comorbidity, these 
findings highlight the clinical and public health significance of PTSD, and suggest that 
treatment interventions may need to address impairment in functioning across multiple 
domains in addition to PTSD symptomatology. Six in 10 respondents with lifetime PTSD 
reported treatment, most commonly counseling with a professional or prescribed 
medication, but with an average delay of 4.5 years following disorder onset. Contributors to 
this delay may include stigma, insurance coverage concerns, clinical complexity related to 
comorbidity such as MDD and substance use disorders, and difficulties in diagnosis 
reflecting symptom overlap of PTSD with disorders such as MDD and medical illnesses 
characterized by autonomic arousal [63]. Because early identification and treatment are 
important in improving clinical outcomes [64] and the most common treatment providers in 
this study included health professionals, these clinicians may play vital roles in identifying 
and connecting affected individuals to appropriate help.

Empirical support is growing for psychological PTSD treatments including prolonged 
exposure, cognitive processing, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing 
therapies [63, 65]. Empirical support is also growing for pharmacotherapies including 
fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, topiramate, and venlafaxine [65–67]. To date, screening for 
PTSD has not been shown to improve overall health outcomes [64, 68, 69]. Nevertheless, 
identifying and addressing trauma and its consequences are essential components of good 
clinical practice. Beyond improving clinical outcomes of PTSD, prompt identification and

appropriate management, including provision of or referral to evidence-based treatments 
when indicated, may mitigate adverse impacts of PTSD on health risk behaviors and 
treatment adherence for both PTSD and its comorbidities [63, 68, 70–72].

Study limitations include the NESARC-III’s cross-sectional design. Prospective 
investigations are needed to assess stability of prevalence estimates over time, clinical course 
of PTSD, and predictors thereof. Furthermore, the NESARC-III’s target population 
comprised civilian residents, including veterans, of households and selected group quarters. 
By excluding individuals currently on active military duty and those institutionalized in 
prisons or psychiatric facilities, it may have underrepresented those most likely to have high 
levels of trauma exposure or PTSD, leading to some underestimation of prevalences.

The narrow definition of PTSD in this study might also have missed some relatively mild 
cases, possibly underestimating prevalences and biasing associations with sociodemographic 
and clinical correlates. To examine this potential concern, we reanalyzed lifetime prevalence, 
sociodemographic correlates, PTE exposures, worst events, and psychiatric comorbidity, as 
well as past-month disability with adjustment for lifetime rather than 12-month psychiatric 
diagnostic covariates using a broad definition of PTSD. Under that definition, respondents 
were classified as having lifetime PTSD if they met DSM-5 Criteria A through E (≥ 2 
symptoms each required for Criteria D and E), with or without duration of ≥1 month and 
with or without impairment or distress. Although the prevalence of broadly defined lifetime 
PTSD was considerably higher (10.7%±0.27), the directions and magnitudes of associations 
with specific events, sociodemographic characteristics, lifetime comorbidity, and disability 
did not differ between narrowly and broadly defined PTSD.

An additional consideration involves assessment of PTSD based on worst trauma, versus 
assessment based on both the worst and another, randomly selected event [14, 47]. 
Respondents may not have defined their worst trauma uniformly, and using the worst event 
might overestimate PTSD prevalence. Nevertheless, the upward bias in worst event-based 
prevalence estimates is modest [14], and associations with key clinical characteristics are 
comparable to random event-based assessments. The worst-event approach is thus 
appropriate for assessment of trauma-related symptomatology when separate assessments 
for ≥2 events are infeasible [14].

Despite these limitations, the NESARC-III is the first epidemiologic survey of DSM-5 
psychopathology in U.S. adults. Based on a large, nationally representative sample, it 
provides current, comprehensive information on a wide range of common mental disorders, 
incorporates well-validated measures of functioning, and includes detailed characterization 
of help seeking. An additional strength to be drawn upon in future investigations is the 
availability of genetic data from a subsample of NESARC-III respondents. The present 
paper lays important groundwork for future studies utilizing the genetic data.

In conclusion, consistent with studies based on prior diagnostic systems, NESARC-III 
findings identify DSM-5 PTSD as a prevalent, highly comorbid, and disabling condition 
affecting millions of Americans and associated with long delays in treatment seeking. 
Studies can now characterize in greater detail the broad relationships, including sex

differences in trauma exposures and PTSD prevalence, identified herein, estimate current 
social and economic costs of PTSD, investigate hypotheses about etiology, course, and 
treatment utilization, and inform policy decisions about resource allocation to service 
provision and research. Present findings reinforce the need to destigmatize PTSD, educate 
the public, clinicians, and policymakers about its seriousness and the availability of effective 
treatments, and encourage more individuals with the disorder to seek help.
