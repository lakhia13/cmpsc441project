Abstract

We review some of the growing evidence of the costs of poverty to children’s neuroendocrine 
function, early brain development, and cognitive ability. We underscore the importance of 
addressing the negative consequences of poverty-related adversity early in children’s lives, given 
evidence supporting the plasticity of executive functions and associated physiologic processes in 
response to early intervention and the importance of higher order cognitive functions for success 
in school and in life. Finally, we highlight some new directions for prevention and intervention 
that are rapidly emerging at the intersection of developmental science, pediatrics, child psychology 
and psychiatry, and public policy.

brain development; early childhood; executive function; infancy; parenting; poverty; stress

Scientific attention has focused on the toxic consequences of stress for brain function and 
mental and physical health. It is has become increasingly clear that one of the mechanisms 
through which poverty affects the health and well-being of children and adults is through the 
toxic effects of stress on the brain. A growing body of evidence indicates that effects of 
poverty on physiologic and neurobiologic development are likely central to poverty-related 
gaps in academic achievement and the well-documented lifelong effects of poverty on 
physical and mental health.1–5

Here we review studies delineating the substantial effects of poverty on children’s biological 
and psychologic development, thus emphasizing the importance of early experience and the 
malleability of developmental processes that are shaped early in life to establish a 
foundation for later competence. We also review studies that demonstrate the efficacy of 
early intervention for children at risk, highlighting implications for policy.

Poverty and Brain Development

Although examinations of direct relations between income and brain structure and function 
are relatively recent, 2 prominent reports demonstrate that effects are particularly large and 
seen early in development for children in poverty. One study examined a cross-sectional 
sample of 389 children aged 4 to 22 years and found that children in families in poverty had 
reduced gray matter volumes in the frontal and temporal cortex and the hippocampus. When 
families were at 150% of poverty, these reductions were 3% to 4% below developmental 
norms. For children in families at 100% of poverty or below, reductions in these regions 
were 8% to 9% below developmental norms. Given the association of these regions with 
school readiness and school achievement, this analysis further examined the extent to which 
these gray matter reductions account for the well-known effect of poverty on academic 
outcomes. Mediation analysis of standardized achievement test data indicated that the 
measures of gray matter in frontal and temporal regions accounted for between 15% and 
20% of the income-related achievement gap.2 In a similar analysis examining cortical 
surface area with 1099 children and young adults aged between 3 and 20 years, both 
parental education and income were found to be positively related to surface area. 
Associations were greatest in the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions.6 As with the 
analysis of Hair et al,2 this study also found that the effects of income on brain development 
are largest for children in families whose incomes fell below the poverty line.

Effects of poverty on brain development start early and are seen in infancy. In a longitudinal 
analysis of 77 children participating in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) MRI Study of 
Normal Brain Development and seen between the early postnatal period and age 4 years, 
those in low-income or poor families were found to have total gray matter volumes that were 
nearly half a standard deviation smaller than their better-off counterparts. These reductions 
were particularly large in the frontal and parietal regions associated with executive function 
abilities.7 Growth modeling indicated that these associations are developmental, with 
reduced growth trajectories for total, frontal, and parietal gray matter volumes that were 
most pronounced for children in poverty. These results are consistent with an EEG study of 
6- to 9-month-old infants that found reduced high-frequency electrical oscillations in the 
frontal cortex, the seat of executive function abilities, among children in poverty relative to 
their higher-income counterparts.8 A second analysis from the NIH MRI study of 283 
children aged 11 years found that parental education as an indicator of socioeconomic status 
was positively associated with regional gray matter in the left superior frontal gyrus and 
right anterior cingulate gyrus, both regions associated with executive function abilities.4 
Similar longitudinal findings were seen in an analysis of 145 children followed 
longitudinally from preschool and who underwent MRI when they were approximately 10 
years old. In this analysis, household income-to-need was positively related to gray and 
white matter volumes; the quality of parenting that children received in early childhood and 
the number of stressful life events experienced were found to mediate some of the effects of 
income on the volume of the hippocampus.9

In combination, available evidence confirms that the shaping of children’s biology and 
behavior by experience starts early and happens rapidly. The burgeoning research evidence 
of the costs of poverty to children’s early development and the parallel evidence of the

benefits of early intervention have triggered a call to action on the part of many to 
“preserv[e] and support our society’s most important legacy, the developing brain.”10 Here 
we outline some developmental foundations that underlie the effects of poverty on brain 
development and consequences for early learning. We underscore the importance of 
addressing the negative consequences of poverty-related adversity early in children’s lives. 
In doing so, we also emphasize the need for an increased scientific focus on the malleability 
and plasticity inherent in development, particularly given the relatively slow time course of 
brain development in areas that underlie the higher-order self-regulation associated with 
executive function. Finally, we highlight some new directions for prevention and 
intervention that are rapidly emerging at the intersection of developmental science, 
pediatrics, child psychology and psychiatry, and public policy.

Adverse Effects of Poverty on Developing Brain

Traditionally research on child development in the context of poverty has focused on 
reduced stimulation and reduced opportunity for learning relative to children in higher-
income homes. Increasingly, however, research in a variety of disciplines is converging on 
the idea that in addition to reduced opportunity for types of stimulation that positively affect 
development, such as a rich and varied language environment,11 poverty is also 
characterized by an overabundance of types of stimulation that negatively affect 
development. Key mechanisms that link children’s exposure to poverty-related adversity and 
brain development include the presence of chronic stressors such as noise, including 
background noise such as that associated with ongoing and unmonitored television, 
household chaos, and conflict among family members that alter the physiologic response to 
stress, leading to potentially teratogenic effects of stress-related hormones on the developing 
brain and to a range of negative cognitive, emotional, and behavioral sequelae.12,13 
Importantly, poverty-related stressors have been theoretically argued and empirically shown 
to tune or program the physiologic response to stress in ways that alter neuroendocrine 
activity and consequently neural activity, thereby influencing the course of brain 
development and function14 (Text Box 1). Controlled experiments in rodents and to some 
extent nonhuman primates demonstrate that exposure to chronic stressors and the resulting 
corticosterone/cortisol increase from the prenatal period through adulthood is associated 
with alterations to the volume of the amygdala, atrophy of the hippocampus, and atrophy of 
pyramidal dendrites, neurons that are integral to prefrontal cortex function and 
communication between prefrontal cortex and numerous regions throughout the brain, 
including limbic structures that activate and terminate the stress response.15–18 Further, 
patterns of neural activity in the brain are altered under conditions of stress, suggesting that 
experience-dependent neural and behavioral responses to stimulation will be progressively 
established over time, biasing the developing individual to be reactive and defensive, rather 
than to engage in reflective and approach-oriented responses to stimulation.19,20

A number of studies have shown that cortisol and other stress markers are elevated in 
children in poverty.21–23 In addition, these studies have shown that effects of poverty on the 
stress response in part underlie the effects of poverty on the development of executive 
function and the regulation of emotion and attention. These effects are consistent with 
animal models demonstrating that glucocorticoids influence activity in, and thereby the

development of, brain structures and neural circuitry that are important not only for 
regulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) response to stress but also for 
executive function abilities.16 Executive function is essential for self-regulation and school 
readiness and is a basic building block of early cognitive and social competence. Available 
evidence indicates that effects of socioeconomic and early psychosocial disadvantage on 
cortisol and brain structure partially mediate effects of poverty on the development of 
executive function in childhood.24–26 Effects of poverty on brain development and executive 
function are likely one key pathway, along with reduced stimulation for learning, through 
which poverty is associated with gaps in school readiness and achievement and positive life 
outcomes. These effects are consistent with, albeit perhaps less severe than, those seen in 
studies examining effects of extreme stress and trauma, such as that associated with 
institutional rearing. Findings from studies of traumatic early rearing experience indicate 
alterations to the volume of the amygdala and hippocampus and total gray and white matter 
volumes in brain areas that underlie executive function and emotion regulation 
capabilities.27,28

Caregiving as a Key Mechanism

The foregoing provides an initial neurobiologic model detailing the ways in which early 
experience affects the development of stress-response physiology and the brain in areas that 
underlie the development of executive function and the self-regulation of behavior. In 
supportive and resource-rich environments, stress-response systems are understood to shape 
brain development in ways that are conducive to executive function and high levels of self-
control. In lower-resource, unpredictable environments, however, stress-response systems 
are understood to shape the brain in ways that promote highly reactive behavior and poor 
executive function ability—an adaptation appropriate for an unpredictable and threatening 
environment (Text Box 2).

A central aspect of this experience early in life is the quality of caregiving the infant 
receives.20 Importantly, the presence of toxic aspects of poverty have been argued to have a 
corrosive effect on the quality of caregiving provided by adults in ways that can exacerbate 
rather than mitigate effects of stress on children’s brains.29 Chronic stress in the context of 
poverty can adversely affect the style of caregiving that parents provide.30,31 As well, the 
maternal brain during pregnancy and the postpartum period is highly plastic for both good 
and for ill: While it is undoubtedly adaptive for new caregivers to experience substantial 
shifts in brain and neuroendocrine function that allow for greater attunement to infant cues 
after the birth of a new child, this plasticity also means that caregivers’ brains are open to 
insult neurologically, physiologically, and psychologically by stress, including the stresses 
associated with parenting.32,33 Here, early caregiving is understood to function as a mediator 
of the effects of stress on development. In rats, creation of poverty-like conditions by 
restricting the availability of material for nesting increases the likelihood of lower levels of 
caregiving competence that are in turn associated with problems with stress regulation and 
adverse cognitive and behavioral outcomes in offspring.34 Also in rats, an influential 
epigenetic model of early experience has demonstrated that specific aspects of maternal 
behavior in what can be considered the typical range alter gene expression in the pup 
hippocampus, with widespread downstream consequences for social and cognitive

development, including intergenerational transmission of this maternal behavior.35 This 
demonstration of epigenesis, albeit in rodents, makes clear that typical variation in context 
can affect the type of caregiving the infant receives, with meaningful implications for later 
development.36

In a body of emerging research with human caregivers, studies have shown that when 
families are faced with stressful psychosocial and physical conditions within the home, 
parents are at greater risk for becoming less sensitive and warm in their patterns of early 
caregiving. In turn, lower level of maternal sensitivity increases the likelihood that children 
will demonstrate elevated cortisol levels and lower executive function ability, with 
commensurate difficulty regulating emotion and behavior.37 Notably, however, just as early 
caregiving functions in a mediating role as a conduit for stressors in the environment, it also 
functions as a moderator, or a buffer of stress.38 To be sure, many families provide high 
levels of sensitive and nurturing caregiving despite the struggle to make ends meet. In 
families where parents are able to maintain positive, responsive styles of caregiving, the 
presence of the mother is inherently regulating for offspring, serving to dampen the HPA 
response to stress. This has been shown most clearly in experiments with rodents in which 
the presence versus absence of the mother can be manipulated and the effects on pups’ HPA 
activity, gene expression, and later development examined. The physical presence of the 
mother as a buffer on the HPA axis is seen even in the instance of low-quality early care in 
which neural systems associated with approach behavior and with early learning override the 
HPA response and potential learned aversions to the primary caregiver.39

In both rats and monkeys, however, intermittent stress induced by brief periods of separation 
from the mother is associated with benefits to the regulation of the stress response. These 
benefits are seen not only in the activity of the HPA axis but also in terms of the regulation 
of behavior in response to challenge and in terms of cognitive abilities, including 
performance on measures of working memory and inhibitory control.40,41 These data 
suggest the potential benefits of moderate stress and emphasize the importance of stress 
regulation as a central aspect of the influence of experience on development.

Opportunities for Repair

Given the inherently moderating or buffering effect of the primary caregiver on the HPA 
axis, efforts to ensure consistent high-quality care are particularly important for children in 
poverty. Extant research indicates that care-giving can serve as a key lever of change through 
which effects of disadvantageous experience on biology and behavior can be altered. The 
limits on malleability and the extent to which the developing child may be more or less 
sensitive to the effects of caregiving and experience at specific points in development—so-
called sensitive periods—are not yet fully known (although parameters are being discerned 
from the study of infants reared in conditions of severe deprivation42). Acquiring this 
information about the process of development constitutes a major scientific goal. To date, 
however, a focus on early caregiving provides partial explanation for why we find resilient 
outcomes or high levels of competence among a significant proportion of children 
experiencing exposure to economic stressors and high levels of adversity. This recurrent 
finding of resilience in the face of high levels of stressors is seminal: It alerts our fields of

developmental science, neuroscience, pediatrics, and child psychology and psychiatry that it 
is time move past the broad-brush recognition of the negative sequelae of poverty-related 
adversity for brain development to a more complex model of biological, interpersonal, and 
sociologic mechanisms that lead to individual differences among infants and children 
exposed to adversity. In so doing, we will gain new insights to the ways that children’s 
emotional and cognitive regulation can be supported in conditions of hardship and toxic 
stress.

Research examining optimal ways to support and ensure competent, contingent, responsive 
caregiving for children in poverty is paramount. Positive parenting behavior represents a 
tremendously valuable resource within communities affected by poverty. We would be well 
served to learn from parents and community leaders about ways to preserve, strengthen, and 
extend this care as a way to safeguard infant and child development in communities hard hit 
by economic disadvantage; several models of public health messaging to reinforce positive 
parenting practices have been recently launched to support parents’ positive practices as an 
important, population-level effort to support early “brain health”43 (eg, the Best Start 
Initiative in California, and the Talk to Your Baby, Their Brain Depends on It campaign in 
New York). Caregivers’ own mental health and management of stress becomes a viable 
target for community and public health support.

Pediatric primary care settings have proven to be an excellent venue for initial screening of 
parent and child mental health risk and for service provision. Screening of infants and 
toddlers as well as parents for mental health risk and referral to services leads to 
improvements in mental health and parenting behavior.44,45 The Reach Out and Read 
program, which provides parents with children’s books along with guidance and modeling 
of reading interactions during the pediatric primary care visit, has demonstrated 
effectiveness on child language development and parent–child interaction.46 An innovative 
expansion of this program using video-based feedback to enhance parent–child interaction 
has been shown to increase parent stimulation for development and to reduce maternal 
depression.47

In addition, several targeted parenting interventions delivered through social service 
agencies supporting children in the context of disadvantage are currently underway.48,49 Few 
completed studies, however, have incorporated measures of child physiology or 
neuroimaging. Several have indicated in high-risk samples of children that programs that 
increased the quality of care that children received from parents were associated with 
beneficial alterations to diurnal activity of the HPA axis, HPA axis reactivity to challenge, or 
both.50,51 Further, evaluation of a program focused on selective attention for preschool 
children in poverty demonstrated effects at the neural and behavioral levels from the 
combination of information for parents with attention training activities for children.52 In 
our own ongoing research, home visitors use a program incorporating video feedback to 
alert and focus parents’ attention to their own emotions, behaviors, and appraisals of their 
infants in the context of ongoing, everyday parenting tasks. Prior evaluations of this 
program, the Play and Learning Strategies (PALS) program, indicate that it is effective at 
increasing parenting stimulation and sensitivity with concomitant changes in child 
development indicators for families in poverty.53 We are midway through our empirical test

of this model using a randomized controlled trial design examining physiologic and 
behavioral measures of parent and child outcomes.

This increased integration of service delivery (such as child-focused educational supports 
combined with services targeting parenting) is not new. For example, early education 
programs serving young children (such as Early Head Start) have long recognized the 
importance of involving and supporting parents to attain goals of economic self-sufficiency 
as well as maintaining and strengthening positive caregiving skills. Increased awareness of 
the costs of poverty to infant and toddler brain development has arguably sparked greater 
policy interest in ways that various platforms of service delivery can be more effectively 
integrated. For example, a new set of “2 Generation” programs that primarily target adult 
postsecondary education and workforce development have been reengineered to also support 
parent–child relationships and early child health and development (eg, the Ascend Initiative 
led by the Aspen Institute). Family-serving community-based agencies and policy partners 
are often at the forefront of the design and implementation of innovative models of 
integrated service delivery, where child and parent health, educational attainment, and 
economic and housing security are approached in holistic and comprehensive ways (eg, 
http://www.liveworkthrive.org/).

In addition, we note that single-platform interventions involving one policy area (eg, center-
based early education and universal prekindergarten) can significantly reduce poverty’s 
negative sequelae when delivered with levels of high quality. Classic early intervention 
studies of the latter half of the 20th century indicated initial effects on general mental ability 
with long-term effects on academic achievement and a number of indicators of health and 
well-being.54 While neuroscientific methods have been of great value in highlighting the 
brain-based benefits of reading interventions with older children, we are aware of only one 
early education study that has directly examined treatment-related effects of preschool 
intervention targeting self-regulation on brain development using neuroimaging methods.52 
There are, however, relevant examples from reading and language interventions with older 
children.55,56 Even without this neuroimaging evidence, the extant findings from behavioral 
studies are impressive and persuasive with regard to the benefits of high-quality preschool 
education. For example, several studies have demonstrated that high-quality early education 
is associated with significant gains on measures of neurocognitive ability, such as executive 
function, greater skill in perspective taking (or theory of mind), the ability to regulate 
attention in response to emotional stimuli, and speed of information processing.57–61 
Further, one evaluation of a high-quality kindergarten program found that children in 
treatment classrooms in high-poverty schools had moderately elevated levels of cortisol 
indicative of positive stress relative to their counterparts in control classrooms.58 Finally, 
long-term follow-up of the Abecedarian early intervention program, which began in the 
1970s, found that as adults, participants randomly assigned to the intervention group had 
greatly reduced prevalence of indicators of risk for stress-related disease.62 Even though 
resilient functioning may come with some biological wear and tear for low-income children, 
greater self-regulation and cognitive control (or executive function) are robust predictors of 
greater health, greater wealth, lower substance use, and lower involvement in crime in 
adulthood63; investments in early classroom-based interventions that support executive

decades to come.

Conclusion

In supporting children’s physiologic reactivity, cognitive control, and self-regulation through 
parenting- and classroom-based interventions, prevention scientists, policy makers, and 
practitioners are essentially working hard to alleviate the costs of poverty for human 
development. Yet it is equally imperative to work further upstream—to lower parents’ and 
children’s exposure to poverty and associated stressors in the first place. Two avenues of 
policy innovation include supporting families in building higher levels of human capital so 
as to increase earnings and increasing federal and state income and non-income transfers 
(such as the Earned Income Tax Credit or Section 8 housing subsidies) to families so that 
they are less likely to be poor. Legislation introduced into the US Senate and the House of 
Representatives in summer 2015 for America’s College Promise Act would accomplish both 
of those things at once: It would potentially provide a federal match of $3 for every $1 
invested by states to dramatically lower the cost of tuition for community, technical, and 
tribal colleges for low-income young adults (https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/
docs/progressreportoncommunitycollege.pdf). In so doing, such policy would not only 
strengthen the earning potential of college-going young parents but would also lower their 
debt, leaving them with more income, reduced levels of poverty-related stressors, and more 
time and energy for their children. Such policy approaches to lifting families out of poverty 
provides tremendous opportunity for scientists to test ways that reducing poverty may 
benefit public health through key mechanisms of lowered allostatic load, improved 
caregiving, and healthier brain development. Reversing the negative consequences of 
poverty for children’s brain development is not just imaginable but is also actionable. 
Through home-, school-, pediatric medical home-, and community-based intervention, we 
can and must take those important steps—now.

Text Box 1

Effects of early stress on development have been demonstrated most clearly in the 
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis component of the stress response system. 
The HPA axis is characterized by a cascade of activity in which stimulation of the 
amygdala initiates the release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) from the 
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus leading to the secretion of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary and resulting release of the 
glucocorticoid hormone cortisol (corticosterone in rodents) from the adrenals. Circulating 
glucocorticoid then feeds back on the HPA system to inhibit CRH and the resulting 
production of cortisol.1 Although increase in circulating glucocorticoids resulting from 
HPA activity is relatively slow and enduring, on the scale of minutes and hours, CRH 
also stimulates the sympathetic adrenal system, the faster-acting component of the stress 
response (on a scale of seconds), leading to complex interactions between the HPA axis 
and the autonomic nervous system.2–4 In addition to fast and slow effects of stress on 
brain function, glucocorticoids affect brain structure through epigenetic processes. Levels 
of circulating cortisol/corticosterone affect processes in the cell nucleus and influence 
DNA transcription and gene expression.5,6 Interactions among the components of stress 
physiology are intricate, and more research is needed on how they are related to one 
another developmentally.

Text Box 2

The adaptability of stress physiology in response to experience is referred to as allostasis 
or biased homeostasis.1 Allostasis refers to the adjustment of resting levels of stress 
response physiology in response to experience. Unlike homeostatic systems that must 
maintain functioning within a relatively narrow band around a given set point to support 
the optimal functioning of the organism (eg, body temperature around 98.6°F), stress 
response systems are allostatic, able to adaptively adjust set points and ranges in response 
to experience as needed. In this process of allostatic adjustment, the brain plays the key 
mediating role as it is shaped by experience to adjust physiologic systems to meet an 
expected future.2 The process of the interactive adjustment of biological development by 
experience is referred to as experiential canalization.3 As applied to self-regulation 
development,4 experiential canalization refers to the way in which experience shapes 
stress response physiology in ways that promote behaviors appropriate for the context in 
which development is occurring. In the context of poverty, in which resources are scarce 
and the future unpredictable, stress physiology is hypothesized to shape brain 
development in ways that promote fast reactive and automatic responses to stimulation. 
In contrast, in high-resource, supportive environments, experience is hypothesized to 
shape brain development in ways that promote executive function and the intentional, 
thoughtful regulation of behavior.
