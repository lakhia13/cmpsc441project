Mental disorders (e.g., depression) and sedentary behavior are increasing, also among
emerging adults. One particular target group of emerging adults with high sitting times
and vulnerability to mental disorders are university students. In particular, anxiety and
depressive symptoms as well as stress symptoms are very common among university
students. The present manuscript discusses whether physical activity and exercise
interventions can help to promote the mental health of emerging adults such as university
students. The manuscript will summarize current scientiﬁc evidence and based on this
evidence, introduce an university-based scientiﬁc research project that investigates if
physical activity, exercise interventions and acute bouts of exercise of low- to moderate
intensity can buffer perceived stress, alleviate mental health symptoms and strengthen
well-being (psychologically and physiologically) among university students by positively
inﬂuencing depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress and emotion perception,
body awareness and subjective well-being including overall quality of life. The research
project, its concept, multimethod approach, and ﬁrst results from available studies
are discussed in relation to current scientiﬁc evidence, health care needs and future
developments. The results from the studies conducted within the research project so far
and that are brieﬂy summarized in this manuscript suggest that physical activity, mental
health and well-being are positively related, also in university students as an important
group of emerging adults. The results further suggest
that exercise interventions
comprising aerobic exercises of low- to moderate intensity may work best to improve
mental health (alleviate depressive symptoms and perceived stress) among university
students after a few weeks of intervention. In addition, acute bouts of certain types of
exercises (yoga in particular) seem to be particularly effective in changing perception of
bodily signals, cardiac activity and emotion processing immediately after the exercise.
The results underscore the importance of systematic investigations of the combined
examination of psychological and physiological factors that promote an active lifestyle
and that strengthen mental health and well-being (psychologically and physiologically)
among emerging adults such as university students.

Physical Activity Programs for Mental Health

INTRODUCTION

Mental disorders such as depression (major depressive disorder,
MDD) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), most of them
lifestyle related diseases (LSRD), are becoming the major causes
of ill health (1) According to the World Health Organization
(WHO),
the prevalence of mental disorders has increased
dramatically in recent decades, even in non-industrialized
countries (1). Today, risk of mental disorders, depression (MDD)
is no longer restricted to certain vulnerable
in particular,
population groups. Mental disorders such as depression (MDD)
constitute a public health burden and a major cause of premature
mortality and disability among all age groups and cultures [e.g.,
(2, 3)]. In Europe alone, the prevalence of depressive disorders
ranges between 5 and 10%, respectively (4).

Negative changes in lifestyle and health behavior, emotional
burden (stress), and reduced well-being including changes in
aﬀect, along with social, genetic, and demographic factors, are
common factors involved in the onset and in the chronicity
of many mental disorders such as MDD (5). As psychological
and lifestyle related factors, many of these factors are not
disease speciﬁc. They are signiﬁcantly contributing to physical
and mental health problems in general and impair physical,
mental, and social performance, and quality of life of each
individual. Therefore, mental health promotion is as important as
is physical health promotion. There is no health without mental
health (6).

Physical activity and regular exercise are essential for a
positive, active and health-promoting lifestyle. According to the
WHO, interventions aimed at increasing physical activity are
sustainable health promoting interventions (7). Positive eﬀects
of physical activity and of regular exercise on health have been
reported across all age groups in epidemiological studies and
prospective, longitudinal follow-up studies [e.g., for an overview,
(8, 9)]. As summarized in these studies, physical activity
and the person’s physical ﬁtness are factors, both associated
with a number of health improvements.
Improvements
can concern (a) physical health such as improved body
composition, healthier lipoprotein proﬁles and cholesterol levels,
better glucose, insulin and inﬂammation status, lower blood
pressure, better cardiac functions and autonomic balance of the
autonomous nervous system (ANS) and (b) improved and stable
well-being (10, 11).

Based, among others, on this evidence, the WHO [latest
version, see (7)] developed recommendations and guidelines for
physical activity and regular exercise to provide the population
and political, social and health-care decision-makers with general
recommendations for health promotion. The physical activity
guidelines distinguish between age and the degree or amount
of physical activity and regular exercise required for health
prevention, and the degree or amount of physical activity
and regular exercise necessary to achieve health gain and
health beneﬁts beyond the basic health prevention level. As
summarized in Figure 1, for health prevention, the physical
activity and exercise should include (a) a signiﬁcant amount
of moderate to vigorous (high-intensity) aerobic exercise (e.g.,
treadmill
endurance activities such as walking, swimming,

running, or cycling) to improve cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and
(b) additionally include activities that foster muscle strength
to improve muscular ﬁtness. Furthermore, as people age,
physical activity and the exercises regularly practiced should
trigger somatosensory processing and neurocognitive functions
falls
as well. This is recommended to prevent the risk of
and premature decline of mental executive functions in the
elderly: executive functions are signiﬁcantly involved in the
cognitive control of walking and the maintenance of mental
and motor mobility (12). In addition, the latest guidelines also
make speciﬁc recommendations for vulnerable target groups and
make recommendations how to increase physical activity of the
population (7).

These basics rules are the major building blocks in almost any
national physical activity guidelines and are also recommended
by the American College of Sports Medicine (13). They are
therefore in many countries current state of the art of health
promotion initiatives and recommended by health care providers
for daily practice to guarantee the maintenance of health and
well-being in the general population.

The need for global physical activity recommendations for
everyday life becomes reasonable when looking at the results
of recent studies [e.g., (14, 15)]. These studies attest physical
inactivity in a high proportion of the (world) population already
at young age and during adulthood. Recent national health
reports, for example for Germany, observed that about only
42.6% of the surveyed women and 48.0% of the surveyed men
reported to meet the WHO’s physical activity guidelines. In
other words, they do reach at least 2.5 h of endurance activity
per week during leisure time [e.g., (16)]. When the WHO’s
physical activity guidelines of weekly endurance and strength
training are considered together, only few women and men
in Germany and Europe women and men, aged between 18
and 84 years achieve the WHO’s physical activity and exercise
recommendation (17). When only considering adults at working
age (18–64 years), even less women and men are able to
exercise as recommended to maintain and promote a healthy
and active lifestyle (17). Thus, physical activity recommendations
comprising moderate intensity exercises are often not reached
neither globally nor nationally nor individually and adherence
to and maintenance of exercise recommendations is a general
problem, well known in the literature [e.g., (18)], not only in
the elderly.

In parallel with this global decrease in physical activity,
daily periods of predominantly sedentary behavior, whether
at work or during leisure time, have continuously increased
across age groups and signiﬁcantly in the majority of the young
population [e.g., (19, 20)]. Signiﬁcant relationships between
a preferentially sedentary lifestyle of 4–8 h sitting time daily
and negative mental and physical health outcomes have been
conﬁrmed by several studies for a number of health indicators
(metabolic, cardiovascular, mental/psychological) (21). Further
research suggests that a lifestyle characterized by excessive sitting,
even in the presence of physical activity, contributes to an
increased risk of chronic physical and mental conditions such
as depression (22). The majority of the world’s population
already leads a physically inactive lifestyle (23). In a recent

representative survey conducted among the adult population
in Germany, on average, adults have been found to sit about
8 h per day [e.g., (24)]. There is consensus that a lifestyle
characterized by sitting should be avoided at all costs (7).
In line with this, experts including the WHO [see (7)]
suggest that any physical activity could make an important
contribution to the global endeavor of ﬁghting sedentarism,
and at the same time help to promote health and avoid illness
among the population and age groups including emerging
adults (25).

One particular target group of emerging adults at risk of
mental disorders (26–28) and potentially also of increasing
sedentarism (29–31) are university students. University students
are young adults who, after completing their ﬁrst educational
career, pursue an academic education at a state or private
university usually ﬁnishing with a bachelor’s, master’s degree
or state examination. The aim is qualifying for an academic
profession or pursuing a subsequent qualiﬁcation for an
academic degree. The average years spent at university is 6
years. The workload during this time is high. The accumulated
work load for instance in a bachelor’s degree corresponds to
45–56.25 h/week, a time spent predominantly in terms of
sedentary activities in lecture halls, seminar rooms, or at the
desk at home. On average, this results in a daily sitting time
of approximately 6.4–11.25 h, 5-days a week. This sitting time
has been approved in international studies (29–32). Recent
international surveys have reported an increase in mental health
complaints and perceived stress among university students.
According to resent survey estimates, worldwide about every
ﬁfth student reports anxiety and depressive symptoms and

just as many students report to seek help for coping with
academic stress and mental health conditions [e.g., (27, 28)].
Statistics from university counseling centers complement these
numbers showing that roughly over half of the counseling
cases of the clients (university students) report already seeking
therapeutic help. However, according to recent surveys, most
mental disorders among college students aged 18–22 years are
untreated (26). The current Covid-19 pandemic is expected to
increase these numbers in emerging adults (33) and among
university students (34). Worldwide, 2.7% of the total world
population are university students. In future, an increase of 30
million of university students per year is expected globally due to
improved access to education. Accordingly, university students as
emerging adults with high cognitive demands, high self-reported
psychological stress, and high weekly sedentary time may
constitute an at-risk group in primary health care prevention who
could beneﬁt from exercise interventions in the short as well as in
long run.

However, which type of physical activity or exercise might be
most eﬀective for mental health promotion during adulthood, in
particular in emerging adults such as university students?

The positive health eﬀects of regular exercise of moderate
to high and vigorous intensity exercise that builds on aerobic
endurance and muscle strength exercise in an amount and
daily/weekly regularity recommended by the WHO guidelines
(see Figure 1) have been as outlined above investigated
intensively in the past in scientiﬁc research. Undisputed are the
results from epidemiologic studies according to which physically
active people who report practicing a daily or weekly routine of
regular exercise of moderate to high intensity have permanently

reduced impairments in general health and reduced mortality
risk [e.g., see for an overview (35, 36)].

In line with these observations, recent review- and meta-
analytic studies have revealed promising eﬀects of moderate
intensity exercise for alleviating depressive symptoms in the
treatment of patients with clinical diagnosis of depression (e.g.,
major depressive disorders, MDD) [e.g., for an overview (37,
38)]. These positive eﬀects associated with regular exercise
of moderate intensity encouraged medical recommendations
of exercise in the treatment of mental disorders such as
in conjunct with treatment as
MDD in addition to or
usual (psychotherapy and pharmacological
treatment). The
prescriptions of exercise interventions have been included
already in national guidelines. One prominent example is
the UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence
(39), who included exercise interventions in their report for
the treatment and management of depression in adults. The
report reviews the current clinical evidence and based on
it attempts to formulate exercise recommendations for the
treatment of depressive symptoms (39). The recommendations
address patients with a clinical diagnosis–irrespective of age-
and with persistent mild to moderate depressive symptoms
who should exercise 2–3 times a week for at least 45–60 min
per session for at least 10–14 weeks to achieve improvement
in the severity of depressive symptoms. The exercise should
in line with the WHO’s criteria (Figure 1) involve endurance
and resistance exercise. A health care professional should
supervise the exercise because in most studies, supervised-
exercise interventions have proven superior over unsupervised
exercise interventions
in these patient groups. Regarding
treatment of anxiety disorders by means of exercise, current
for the treatment of
evidence is less consistent
depression, but there is evidence that state anxiety is signiﬁcantly
reduced after acute bouts of moderate intensity exercise
[e.g., (40)].

than that

In summary, the recommendations of moderate intensity
exercise for mental health promotion are strengthened by
ﬁndings that exercise of moderate intensity has comparable
eﬀects in lowering symptoms as pharmacological treatment
with e.g., antidepressants in patients with MDD has (41, 42).
Therefore, a common opinion and hypothesis is that dose-
response relationships signiﬁcantly matter, not only for achieving
beneﬁts in physical health but in mental health as well. In
other words, it is assumed that if the exercises or the physical
activity carried out during an exercise session or exercise
intervention have no metabolic and no physiological eﬀects,
they cannot have any direct eﬀect on physical health or on
mental health for achieving changes in the physical symptoms,
the physiological symptoms or the neurobiology of mental
disorders. In fact, mental disorders such as major depressive
disorder (MDD) or anxiety are not just mental disorders. As
aﬀective disorders, the key symptoms of for example depression
comprise depressed mood and loss of interest in nearly almost
all activities approximately all days and these key symptoms
aﬀect the whole person and organism (DSM-5, Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). Mood
changes and loss of interest occur in companion with changes

in psychomotor and sleep patterns, appetite and concentration,
suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem
(DSM-5). Moreover, these physical and mental changes are
accompanied by changes in neurotransmitters, by changes in
brain functions and by changes in activity in prefrontal brain
regions and subcortical reward and memory brain systems,
i.e., brain regions and neuronal networks controlling emotions,
mood, motivation, cognition, behavior and aﬀect. Moreover,
depression-related changes in peripheral-physiological bodily
functions such as changes in blood pressure and heart rate
variability (HRV), changes in cortisol levels and inﬂammatory
parameters speak to altered functioning of the central, the
autonomous nervous system (ANS) and the immune system in
MDD [e.g., (43)].

So far, however, there is only little systematic research about
the eﬃcacy of exercise interventions in the ﬁeld of primary
prevention of health among the adult age groups, who are yet not
suﬀering from clinical symptoms [for overviews see for example
(36, 44, 45)]. A recent publication (46) summarizing data from
the HUNT cohort prospective follow-up studies is one of the
few studies that investigated the relationship between exercise
and mental health in healthy adults and controlled for the role
of exercise related dose-response eﬀects. The publication (46)
included a sample of 33 908 healthy, never depressed adults, with
a mean age of 45.2 years (SD = 16.5 years) who were investigated
two times in a time window of 11 years. The results suggest that
exercise of low intensity of about 1 h (walking) exercise a week
to be eﬀective in reducing the risk of depression by 12% with
little or no signiﬁcant additional depression alleviating beneﬁts
of exercise with a duration beyond 1 h a week. Similar promising
eﬀects that low-intensity exercise interventions comprising a
diversity of exercise types (aerobic exercise, yoga, dancing,
resistance training, etc.) can alleviate stress- and depressive
symptoms and improve mental health across a wide age range,
comes from recent reviews of meta-analytic studies (44, 47).
The meta-analyses suggest that a diversity of diﬀerent types
of exercise, speciﬁcally, mind-body exercises such as yoga have
proven equivalent to aerobic moderate intensity exercise such
as walking, swimming or cycling, in improving mental health
at least in clinical groups or vulnerable groups at risk of mental
ill health.

As far as the treatment of mental disorders in emerging
adults by means of exercise interventions is concerned, still
few systematic evidence is available so far. A recent scoping
review suggests that the current evidence is restricted to only
a few studies (48). Moreover, concerning primary prevention
of health in emerging adults, evidence that physical activity,
mental health and well-being are related comes mainly from
self-report studies [e.g., (49)]. In addition, systematic research
evaluating the eﬀectiveness of exercise interventions on mental
health of university students, depression in particular, seems
also still limited (50). A recent meta-analysis compared seven
exercise interventions for their eﬀectivity in alleviating depressive
symptoms in undergraduate college students and found that
mind-body exercises such as Tai Chi and yoga were best suited
to reduce depressive symptoms compared to team sports such as
basketball or badminton or dance (50) in the targeted groups.

AIM AND SCOPE OF THE PRESENT
MANUSCRIPT

As summarized in the previous section, the following important
and signiﬁcant question remains: can exercise interventions
of low- to moderate intensity and short duration as well as
acute bouts of exercise make an important contribution to the
primary prevention and the promotion of mental health and
well-being of emerging adults such as university students, yet not
suﬀering from clinically relevant mental health conditions? In
this manuscript, ﬁrst results from a still ongoing psychological
research project (Anem Fit&Well) will be summarized that
provides ﬁrst answers to this question. The research project
(Anem Fit&Well) and its studies examine the relationships
between physical activity, diﬀerent types of acute and regular
exercise, mental health and well-being in healthy adults with a
speciﬁc focus on emerging adults including university students.

In the following sections, the research project, its concept,
methods, and ﬁrst results from available, already published
studies are summarized and discussed in relation to current
scientiﬁc evidence, health care needs and future developments.
In particular, the results from 5 studies will be summarized
that investigated if physical activity, exercise interventions and
acute bouts of exercise of low- to moderate intensity can buﬀer
perceived stress, alleviate self-reported symptoms of mental
health conditions such as depressive and anxiety symptoms,
change cardiovascular activity during exercise and at rest, and
strengthen subjective well-being by positively inﬂuencing mood
and aﬀect, emotion perception, body awareness, and overall
quality of life.

The ﬁrst section under Materials and Methods will describe
brieﬂy the general framework of the research project in terms
of the theoretical understanding of concepts, the methodological
approach including systematic classiﬁcation of the exercises
chosen in the research project and its studies. Next, the study
designs, the participant samples, inclusion and exclusion criteria
of the already available studies are described and the major results
and conclusion drawn from the results are summarized in the
Results and Discussion. Finally, a future outlook will be provided
and the aims of the research project will be discussed in relation
to health care needs and future developments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Conceptual Framework of the Project
Theoretically, the research projects builds on a biopsychosocial
model
and understanding of health. A biopsychosocial
understanding of the eﬀects of exercise on mental health allows
to take physical and mental processes and their interaction
into consideration. As illustrated in Figure 2, this is critical
for the understanding of how psychological and physiological
mechanisms interact at diﬀerent exercise intensities to promote
mental health and well-being. So far, most studies and most
research programs focus on either the psychological or the
physiological mechanisms of exercise on mental health. Several
physiological and psychological variables have been suggested to
play a role [e.g., (51)]. Therefore, and as summarized in Figure 2,

methodologically, the present research project and its scientiﬁc
studies are following a multimethod approach that combines
psychological methods and psychophysiological methods to
investigate exercise-related health eﬀects on behavior, physiology,
and subjective experience in well controlled laboratory and ﬁeld
(survey, online) experiments.

Exercise Classiﬁcation and Methodology
There is a huge variation across exercise studies in the way
physical activity and the individual exercises included in the
exercise interventions are described. The exercise descriptions
of the study protocols of previous studies often vary in terms
of the outcome variables investigated in a particular study.
They vary across the research disciplines that carry out the
research (medicine, psychology, health and life science, etc.),
and the exercise descriptions vary with the preconditions of
measures available in a lab or research team/environment. This
makes comparison across studies diﬃcult. Therefore, one major
attempt of the research project Anem Fit&Well is to describe
the individual exercises and exercise interventions included in
its studies as best as possible according to the major dimensions
of exercise including type of exercise, exercise duration, and
intensity (52, 53). Moreover, frequency, density and duration
of the exercise sessions (its repetitions) are included if the
exercise comprises more than one exercise session. Notably, all
studies included in the research project follow the scientiﬁc
nomenclature (52, 53): the term physical activity (PA) is used
for the description of any activity that
is carried out on
a regular day including activities from or to work. In the
following sections,
the term physical activity (PA) is used
whenever to describe the habitual physical activity levels of the
participants engaged as study participants. The term “exercise”
is used for the exercises included in the research project
and its exercise intervention studies that are carried out as
planned, structured, repetitive and intentional movements with
the intention to explicitly improve or maintain mental health
(52, 53). Like for each individual exercise of the research project,
the exercise interventions are described along fundamental
exercise dimensions including frequency of
the individual
exercise sessions, number of repetitions of a session per day
or weeks (daily and weekly practice). The exercise protocols
allow comparison with physical activity recommendations from
the literature examining the relationship between mental health,
physical activity and exercise.

Standardized Assessment of Type of
Exercise and Exercise Intensity
The individual exercises included in the research project
comprise diﬀerent types of exercises [e.g., cardio, resistance,
coordination and balance, ergometer or treadmill exercise,
mind-body exercise (e.g., yoga)] whose movements (isometric,
isotonic, or isokinetic) and activity carried out can load on
the diﬀerent exercise dimensions (cardiorespiratory, endurance,
muscular strength, ﬂexibility, speed, balance, and coordination)
in varying degrees and whose intensity and duration range
above rest (> 1.5 MET), but below, at or if whished, above the
physiologically and metabolically eﬀective stimulus thresholds

(1.5–6 MET or beyond; short: MET, metabolic equivalents) see
Figure 3 for examples1.

Objective measures of exercise intensity (e.g., measures of
MET and of energy expenditure such as VO2 max, heart rate,
respiration) might not be available in all research units or
research labs, furthermore these measures are often diﬃcult
to obtain in online studies without wearable devices for
monitoring and recording of these measures. This makes cross-
comparison of exercises and exercises interventions described in
the literature often diﬃcult. To avoid this lack of standardization,
in the current research project, exercise professionals and
novices additionally rate the individual exercises on pre-chosen
standardized exercise dimensions. Expert ratings are an excellent
means and research tool for providing valid descriptions of the
exercises from an expert’s point of view (54). The Borg exercise
scale(s) of perceived exertion (55) ask for bodily and cognitive
exercise symptoms such as changes in heart rate, respiration or
breathing rate, sweating, or (muscle) fatigue. The scales are often
used as valid self-report methods to classify exercises. The Borg
scale has received good validity and can be used by health care
experts or by novices for exercise ratings. Its scores corresponds
well with the objective measure of the degree of heart rate
changes elicited by the exercise, at least for aerobic exercises

1Typically, exercises and physical activities with a maximum increase of only 30–
39% of the resting heart rate (below 3 MET) are below the physiological threshold
at which considerable adaption in performance and physiologic capacity in terms
of exercise training eﬀects can be expected. To achieve physical health-related
training eﬀects, the physical activities and exercises should preferably include
large muscle groups and be above a certain physiological threshold of energy
expenditure (EE) >6 MET and 75% of VO2 max (maximal aerobic capacity), i.e.,
the intensity range of moderate exercise.

(55). Its verbal descriptions allow categorization of exercise
activities into low, moderate and high intensity. Moreover,
besides the evaluation by experts and novices, the individual
exercises are compared to exercise descriptions in the literature.
For example, the general classiﬁcation schemes of physical
activity provided by the Compendium of physical activities (56)
comprise a plethora of physical activities grouped into daily
physical activities and sports activities (exercise planned and
structured). The Compendium provides MET values for each
activity, and based on these, the activities are classiﬁed as low,
moderate or high in intensity. Of note, the classiﬁcation system
of the Compendium of physical activities can only provide rough
average estimates of categorization of activities into those of low,
moderate or high intensity. In the present research project, the
classiﬁcation of the exercises based on the compendium (56) is
included as heuristic additional source of comparison.

Standardized Assessment of Mental
Health, Perceived Stress, Well-Being and
Habitual Physical Activity
Importantly within and across the scientiﬁc studies of the
research project, a number of standardized psychological self-
report measures as well psychological-experimental tasks and
tests are included for profound mental health assessment and
for capturing changes in perceived stress as well as in in
other psychological domains including well-being and quality
of life. Of note, mental health, well-being and quality of life
are broad constructs, especially well-being and quality of life
are often divided into subdomains of physical and psychological
well-being or objective and subjective measures of quality

of life, the latter often comprising aspects of physical and
mental health and well-being (e.g., material and physical well-
being) as well. In addition, subjective well-being focuses on
several factors such as mood, aﬀect or emotions as well as
a person’s capacity, resilience and satisfaction with one’s life
[e.g., (57)]. As brieﬂy illustrated in Figure 4,
the research
project and its studies aim to assess mental health, stress,

life and subjective well-
being with standardized questionnaires in addition to using
standardized questionnaires for detailed proﬁling of depressive
symptoms, anxiety, mood, body awareness and body image
included in the
to name but a few of
project’s psychological assessment. In addition, the psychological
assessment is not only based on self-report measures but aims
to include experimental psychological paradigms to capture
immediate changes in perception, cognition, and emotion or
body awareness, during or after the exercise intervention
compared to pre-exercise. In contrast to self-report measures,
experimental investigations include objective outcome variables
such as reaction times or task accuracy that can be further
combined with measuring changes in brain activity or heart
rate for psychophysiological assessment. Inclusion of a battery
of self-report measures and assessment tools that comprise
standardized self-report questions and short experimental
investigations can give comprehensive insight into exercise-
driven mental health eﬀects. Moreover, the default assessment
in the project
the participants’
includes the assessment of
habitual physical activity level. In addition, each participant is

screened for his/her physical activity habits, and, if possible
(e.g.,
in the laboratory), for cardiovascular/cardiorespiratory
ﬁtness according to standardized in house anamnestic screening
protocols. From a biopsychological understanding of health
undertaken in this research project, only a full assessment of this
kind can improve understanding of the when and why physical
activity and exercise interventions promote health and well-being
in healthy adults.

Study Description and Study Design
the study design of ﬁve intervention studies
In summary,
conducted within the research project and whose results have
already been published separately, all investigating university
students (gender-mixed samples or all-female samples) and
some including randomized control trial studies (RCTs) are
described in the following sections and their main ﬁndings
are outlined in a brief review in the Results section. The
original results of these studies can be found in the following
publications (58–62). An overview of the studies and the study
designs is illustrated in Figure 4. As illustrated in Figure 4,
study 1, study 2 and study 3 were using similar study protocols
comparing exercise interventions against cognitive interventions
or against a non-exercise control group (59, 61). Study 1, study
2 and study 3 were carried out during the time course of
a semester, i.e., when university students were at the campus
and actively enrolled in their studies. Study 1 was carried
out as an online intervention, study 2 was carried out in the
laboratory (59) and study 3 (61) was carried out weekly once

within the classroom across the term. Study 1 and study 2
were RCTs.

Study 1 Cardio Exercise vs. Cognitive Intervention vs.
Wait List
In study 1, all interventions (exercise, cognitive intervention
or wait list) lasted 6 weeks. In study 2 all interventions lasted
2 weeks. In study 1, the exercise intervention as well as the
cognitive intervention comprised 12 sessions within 6 weeks. The
12 exercise sessions increased in duration across the 12 sessions
from 8, 12, to 16 min, respectively. The cognitive intervention
and wait list followed the same time schedule. The exercise
intervention was semi-guided by a female and male exercise
model at the age of the volunteers (all university students, women
and men). The exercise sessions were delivered as exercise videos.
The exercise intensity of the exercises included in study 1 were
evaluated in a separate sample of volunteers by means of heart
rate measures. Moreover, the exercises were evaluated by experts
in a separate study (60). This suggested that the 16 min exercise
sessions of study 1 (59) were at moderate intensity and suited to
increase cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and muscular strength.

Study 2 Cardio Exercise vs. Motor Balance and
Coordination Exercise vs. Wait List
To better understand the contributions of the type of exercise
and the contribution of the duration of the exercise intervention
to mental health improvements, the exercises included in study
1 were also used in study 2 and in study 2 compared against

an exercise intervention comprising balance, coordination and
motor training. The eﬀects of the exercise interventions in study
2 were compared against a wait list control group and in contrast
to study 1, the exercise interventions were carried out across a
period of 2 weeks only, with 3 sessions per week (see Figure 4).
Thus, in study 2, the exercises of study 1 were carried out at the
same intensities but the individual exercise sessions (frequency)
was increased to 2 weeks instead of 6 weeks. Akin to the
participants of study 1, the participants of study 2 performed
the interventions on the same days, hours etc. to control and
exclude as many confounding factors as possible (changes in
circadian rhythm, etc). Moreover, study 2 included detailed
psychophysiological assessment of parameters of cardiovascular
ﬁtness of the participants and improvements therein pre- to
post intervention. Finally, participants of study 2 received the
same psychological assessment battery of questionnaires as the
participants of study 1, and although study 2 was conducted in
the laboratory, the exercises were presented akin to study 1 as
semi-guided exercise videos [for an overview see, (59)].

Study 3 Short Physical Activity Breaks vs. Cognitive
Intervention
In study 3, the duration and frequency of the interventions were
reduced to 1 session/week, the interventions were carried out
weekly once within the classroom across the winter term (1
session per week, starting at T1, T2 until T3; the distance between
T1, T2 and T3 was 3 weeks, follow-up at T4), guided by an
exercise model. The exercise interventions were carried out at

the beginning of the class and lasted about 5 min and no longer
than 10 min. Moreover, in contrast to study 1 and study 2, the
exercises included in study 3 consisted of a mix of exercises of
low intensity that comprised muscle relaxation and other types
of activities such as simple dance steps [see (61); and Figure 4 for
an overview and summary].

The cognitive intervention included in study 1 and study 3
comprised an expressive writing task (12 sessions, 6 weeks, study
1 or 1 session weekly across the winter term, study 3). The
participants in the expressive writing group of study 1 wrote
about their most stressful weekly events (59). In study 3, the
cognitive intervention included writing about positive events
following the in-house protocol of the author of this manuscript.
The eﬀects of a single session of expressive writing about stressful
events as well as of positive writing used in study 1 and study
3 is described in detail (63). The writing intervention of study
1 was carried out online, whereas in study 3, it was akin to the
exercise session carried out in the classroom, weekly, starting at
T1, T2 until T3 with a distance of 3 weeks between T1, T2, and
T3, respectively. Like in study 1 and study 2, the participants of
study 3 underwent detailed psychological assessment including
assessment of global physical activity, depressive symptoms, and
quality of life.

Study 4 Acute Bouts of Cycling Exercise of Moderate
Intensity vs. Control Group
Whereas, study 1, study 2 and study 3 used individual
exercises comprising aerobic cardio ﬁtness exercises, motor
balance and coordination training, and relaxation exercise
(study 3 only) to investigate speciﬁcally the mental health
beneﬁts of diﬀerent
types of exercises combined in the
the laboratory study 4 (62) investigated the
interventions,
eﬀectiveness of 4 sessions of ergometer exercise (bicycling
of moderate intensity) in a within study design in which
the same participants performed all exercise sessions and the
control condition.

Study 5 Mind-Body Exercise (Yoga) With Controlled
and Mindful Breathing vs. Without
The laboratory study 5 (64) used yoga exercises with and without
controlled breathing and mindfulness instructions as mind-
body exercise intervention and investigated the eﬀects of the
exercise after a single exercise session (see Figure 4). Moreover,
akin to study 2, the laboratory study 4 and the laboratory
study 5 included detailed psychophysiological assessment of
cardiovascular improvements pre- to post intervention and a set
of experimental tasks allowing ﬁrst answers to the question of the
role psychophysiological interactions play in the improvement
of cognitive-aﬀective processing, and body awareness after single
sessions of low to moderate intensity exercise.

Study Participants, Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Study 1 comprised a mixed gender sample, study 3 aimed at
including women and men, and study 2, 4 and 5 comprised
all
female samples (to keep psychophysiological recordings
constant). All participants were screened for mental and physical
health conditions because a history of mental or physical

injuries or cardiovascular
disorders and past and current
disorders and other health conditions were exclusion criteria. An
age of at least 18 years was an inclusion criterion as was German
as native language. Study 1 comprised n = 153 university students
(127 women), study 2 comprised n = 32 university students (n =
2 men), study 3 comprised n = 105 university students, whereas
study 4 included n = 30 university students (all-female) and study
4 included n = 34 university students (all-female sample). In
study 1 and study 3, participants with missing data or drop outs
were excluded from the ﬁnal analysis of pre-post intervention
eﬀects, resulting in smaller sample sizes, especially in study 3
[for a detailed overview of the study design and drop outs see
(59, 61)].

RESULTS

Habitual Physical Activity Behavior and
Sedentarism Among University Students
As summarized in this section and in Table 1, the RCT studies,
i.e., study 1 (mixed-gender sample) and study 2 (all-female
sample) yielded an overall sitting time of 7.45 h/day (study 1)
and 7.6 h/day (study 2) in the samples of university students.
Averaged across the study sample, 23.94% and 26.76% of
the participants of study 1 reported to not engage in any
vigorous or moderately intensive activities in their free time.
Regarding the total duration of their weekly physical activity (i.e.,
including activities at work, during transport or leisure), 14.79%
participants of study 1 and 30% of the all-female sample of study
2 did not reach the WHO guidelines of 150 min of moderate-
intensive physical activity, and about 7% (study 1) reported to
not engage in vigorous activity and this held true for both,
women and men [for an overview see (59)]. Study 3 conﬁrmed
this trend in sedentary behavior (574.62 min/week vs. 638.57
min/week corresponding to 9.6–10.64 h/week sitting). Thirty-ﬁve
percentage of the university students reported to spend between
15 and 25 h/week at the university and akin to the participants of
the study 1 and study 2, the participants of the study 3 reported
to be physically active only about 62.86–137.96 min/day and 15%
in total did not reach the WHO recommendations. Seventy-four
percentage of the all-female sample of study 5 (64) reported to
spend at least once a week in regular exercise activities such as
jogging, swimming, cycling, dancing, team sports, martial arts,
strength training, balance, or gymnastics.

Mental Health and Relationship With
Physical Activity Among University
Students
Importantly, akin to the results obtained for sedentarism and
physical activity behavior,
the assessment of mental health
yielded heightened scores of depression, anxiety and perceived
stress among university students. In study 1, only 63.40% of
the participants received an average score on the depression
inventory [Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II (65)] indicating
no depression. In study 2, 16.7% of the all-female sample reported
minimal depressive symptoms (on the BDI-II), while in study
3, depressive symptoms as assessed with the BDI-II ranged on

average from 3.85 (no depression)−10.14 (minimal depression).
Assessment of trait and state anxiety revealed that in study 1,
29.41% of the participants scored above the clinical cutoﬀ score
of trait anxiety and 41.83% reported state anxiety (comparable
to clinical samples) and this was conﬁrmed in study 2 in the
all-female sample [i.e., 30% (trait) and 23.3% (state) of the
participants obtained high scores on trait and state anxiety].
The participants in study 3 reported on average comparable trait
anxiety to the participants of study 1 and study 2, respectively.
As far as perceived stress is concerned, across studies, perceived
stress seemed to be more pronounced in the domains of perceived
stress due to uncertainty or excessive demands than perceived
stress due to actual negative life events among the study samples
of university students.

In accordance with the literature, the results of the RCT
studies 1–2 (59) showed signiﬁcant relationships between mental
health and regular physical activity and exercise. Signiﬁcant
negative correlations were found between the participants’ self-
reported overall habitual physical activity level [GPAQ, (66)] and
self-reported depressive symptoms, trait as well as state anxiety,
body dissatisfaction and self-reported psychosomatic stress
symptoms. Moreover, regular physical activity was positively
correlated with well-being and physical as well as psychological
quality of
life domains. In study 2, relationships between
physical ﬁtness and mental health were conﬁrmed by correlations

between the participants’ cardiovascular ﬁtness [assessed by heart
rate variability (HRV) at rest] and the degree of self-reported
depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Health Beneﬁts: Comparison of Exercises
Across Studies
When compared across the studies, particularly aerobic exercises
(cardio exercise) alleviated depressive symptoms and perceived
stress. These eﬀects are seen in women and men when the
exercises are carried out regularly, 3 times a week for a duration
of 6 weeks at exercise intensities comprising both,
low to
moderate intensities (study 1). Interestingly, when the same
exercise intervention is reduced to 2 weeks and the session
number per week are increased (3 sessions per week instead
of two sessions per weeks), these eﬀects cannot be found in
an all-female sample (study 2). Likewise, the results of study
3 in which a single session of exercise per week was carried
out for the period of the winter term and a weekly session
comprised a mix of 5–10 min of exercises with low intensity not
exclusively focusing on aerobic exercise, this did not signiﬁcantly
change self-reported depression in university students pre to post
intervention. In study 2, the exercise intervention comprising
balance and motor-coordination exercise only, was not superior
to cardio exercise in alleviating perceived psychological stress,
depression or anxiety symptoms when carried out for 2 weeks
[3 sessions/week, see study 2 in (59)]. However, it improved
the participants’ performance of motor balance and motor
coordination signiﬁcantly in the all-female sample of study 2 and
therefore, not just as known from the literature in the elderly.
The participants in study 3 performing low intensity exercise
executed for 5–10 min on 1 day per week showed signiﬁcantly
higher overall physical activity and less sedentary behavior at
the end of the intervention compared to the participants who
engaged in a cognitive intervention of positive writing carried
out at the same amount of time and frequency as the exercise
intervention (61).

Interestingly, four sessions of 22 min of ergometer exercises
[cycling at moderate intensity, see (62)] carried out with diﬀerent
attentional focus (internal vs. external) at moderate intensity
seem not to have diﬀerential eﬀects on cardiovascular activity
during the exercise compared to a control condition (no cycling)
in a sample of healthy women, however, the self-reported
attentional focus during exercise seems to inﬂuence both, the
degree of exertion from the exercise and the correlations with
measures of cardiac activity [see Table 4 in (62)]. In contrast
to the cycling exercise used in study 4, the results of study 5
(64) found signiﬁcant eﬀects on indicators of well-being after
a single session of mind-body exercise (yoga). In study 5,
women (all university students) performed yoga exercises either
with (exercise group 1) or without controlled breathing and
mindfulness instructions (exercise group 2) for 30 min. Self-other
referential emotional processing, awareness of bodily signals
and changes in cardiac activity (heart rate, respiratory sinus
arrhythmia, time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV as
estimates of parasympathetic cardiac control) were investigated
the exercise using standardized
before, during and after

experimental tasks, standardized questionnaires, and mobile
recording devices. This showed that a single session of yoga
exercise (of 30 min duration) can facilitate (a) emotional
processing, appraisal of bodily signals and cardiac adaptability
during the exercise as well as during aﬀective task processing
post- to pre-exercise in healthy women. Assessment of cardiac
activity showed that mean HR increased during the exercise
session. The results of the interventions used in the studies 1–5
are summarized in Figure 5.

DISCUSSION

is

There
exercise
currently open questions of whether
interventions of low to moderate intensity can improve or
promote mental health in emerging adults such as university
students. This question is the focus of the research project
described in this manuscript and its related studies. Emerging
adults such as university students are considered vulnerable to
mental health conditions, depression and anxiety in particular
as well as to the experience of stress [for a discussion, (67)].
Additionally, there is evidence that a majority of emerging adults
are not adhering to the physical activity levels recommended
in the national and international physical activity guidelines
[for metaanalytic results, see (31)]. The results of the already
reviewed above
available studies of
support the hypothesis that university students as emerging
adults are suﬀering from mental health problems including
depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress and that among

the research project

university students, both, the individual physical ﬁtness and
the individual regular exercise and physical activity behavior
are signiﬁcantly related to mental health and well-being.
Moreover, the studies suggest that these relationships hold true
in study samples of university students whose regular physical
activity behavior, on average, might range below the weekly
physical activity level recommended by the physical activity
guidelines. Moreover, the prevalence of sedentary behavior and
the amount of habitual physical activity behavior observed in
the studies conﬁrm results from previous studies among college
students (29) that also support the nationwide trend that a
signiﬁcant majority of the young emerging adult population
including university students spends too many hours/days
sitting (68). Recent recommendations suggests that sitting
more than 8 h/day is as damaging to one’s health as obesity or
smoking (69).

Of note, all the studies whose results are reviewed in the
manuscript were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic.
There is concerns and evidence from research that the mental
health of university students might be seriously aﬀected by the
consequences of the pandemic. Sadly, this is supported by own
survey data (58) collected during the ﬁrst wave and lockdown in
2020. The results show that compared to the prevalence scores
obtained in studies conducted before the pandemic, depression
and anxiety as well as threat perception (as type of stress) have
increased signiﬁcantly. Similar results are reported in the surveys
conducted in other countries across the world that were aﬀected
by lockdowns (34).

Physical Activity Programs for Mental Health

The exercise interventions investigated in the diﬀerent studies
summarized in the Results varied in the type of exercises,
the frequency and duration of the exercise sessions and the
intensity of the exercises. Reviewing the results across the studies
allowed giving ﬁrst answers to the question of when, i.e., at
which intensity, frequency and duration low to moderate exercise
interventions exert eﬀects on the mental health of university
students either immediately after a single exercise session or after
repeated and regular exercise sessions. The results of the studies
suggest that exercise interventions with a certain frequency (3
times weekly) and frequency and duration of the sessions (6
weeks) and of moderate exercise intensity are best suited to
decrease certain mental health problems such as depressive
symptoms and perceived stress pre to post intervention in
emerging adults (i.e., university students), reporting mild to
moderate symptoms in standardized questionnaires and yet
not having been diagnosed with a mental disorder [study 1,
(59)]. This does however not mean that exercise interventions
comprising exercises of low intensity do not have any positive
eﬀects on mental health and well-being of university students.
Motor balance and coordination training might be eﬀective as
well [study 2, (59)]. In addition, even one session comprising
a mix of low intensity exercise executed for 5–10 min on 1
day per week might motivate university students to adhere
to an active lifestyle with participants taking part
in this
intervention showing higher overall physical activity and less
sedentary behavior at the end of the intervention compared
to the participants who engaged in a cognitive intervention
of positive writing over the period of a semester [study 3,
(61)]. Moreover,
the results of study 5 (64) investigating
acute bouts of mind-body exercise (yoga) are particularly
promising because they support immediate adaptive eﬀects of
low intensity exercise (yoga exercise) on both, physical and
psychological health parameters. Although eﬀects of additional
exercise sessions were not
this
experimentally controlled study demonstrate that mind-body
exercise of
low intensity such as yoga can not only be
recommended as an exercise for mental and physical health
prevention in the elderly or in certain vulnerable target groups
but be recommended among university students as well. The
results support the notion that promotion of regular physical
activity and exercise of low- to moderate intensity is an important
health promotion task in order to help emerging adults such
as university students to buﬀer the psychological, cognitive and
emotional demands of pre-dominantly sedentary activities and
mental stress.

CONCLUSION

Limitations and Future Outlook
The results brieﬂy summarized in this manuscript await future
investigations. In particular, more evidence is needed from
studies that use combined examination of psychological and
physiological
factors to determine the mechanisms of how
exercise of
low and moderate intensity strengthen mental
health and well-being (psychologically and physiologically) and
promote an active lifestyle in emerging adults. In light of the
so far limited systematic research given (48), the present studies

and speciﬁcally, the approach of the research project described in
this manuscript can be considered a ﬁrst step into that direction
underscoring the importance of the relevance of systematic
scientiﬁc investigations. Moreover, as proposed by the research
project, future studies should focus more on “the individual
person” and consider the person’s individual preexisting physical
activity behavior, the individual’s needs, preferences, motivation
and reasons for exercise and physical activity behavior. The
results and the scientiﬁc approach taken by the research project
support the notion that theoretical assumptions from exercise
psychology, health psychology, but also from neuroscience and
emotion and motivation and sports psychology could be helpful
when examining mental health eﬀects of exercise interventions.
In the long run, the multidimensional approach suggested and
approached by the research project can give theoretically guided
and personalized exercise and physical activity recommendations
for building psychologically-driven exercise interventions that
strengthen mental health and well-being of emerging adults in
the ﬁeld of primary prevention. To this end, the investigation of
exercise-related eﬀects on mental health should as recommended
in this manuscript include a precise description of the exercise
and its health beneﬁts along several psychological and exercise
dimensions. A detailed and systematic description of both, the
exercise itself and its possible health beneﬁts, in addition to
a detailed description of the physical activity habits, sedentary
behavior, and mental proﬁle of the participants is mandatory
for a better understanding of how exercise of diﬀerent type
and intensity inﬂuences mental health. Moreover, the purpose
of the interventions (e.g., for improving physical health, mental
health, or both or other domains such as well-being) should
be clearly stated and if relevant may include a description of
training principles known from sports psychology and exercise
physiology [for an overview see (70, 71)].

Importantly, exercise adherence and dissemination of the
interventions also play a role. As outlined in this manuscript,
university students as emerging adults display high numbers of
activities (job, leisure time) with a high sitting time and sedentary
behavior. Therefore, the present research project also includes
and provides exercises in a format that can be easily integrated
into the daily activity without much need of persuasion or eﬀort.
For example the exercises of study 1–3 and study 5 could be
carried out as e.g., workout at home or at work. To this end,
the individual exercises are videotaped with diﬀerent exercise
models [women and men, e.g., see (59, 60)] at the age of
the target groups. Moreover, because guidance of exercise as
well as the physical appearance and expertise of the exercise
models can have a signiﬁcant impact on exercise adherence,
the individual exercises are also available as standalone (without
videos) as digital paper-pencil booklets [see e.g., (60)]. In these
exercise manuals, each exercise is given a verbal and a pictorial
description of its movements with feedback about its duration,
intensity and frequency. The manuals are currently available
in two languages, German and English, the latter reducing
language and cultural barriers [see e.g., (60)]. The exercises
investigated in the research project will be continuously updated,
include diﬀerent types of exercises (as illustrated in Figure 2).
Thus,
the exercises can be delivered to a broad audience
digitally and semi-guided with or without real and symbolic
