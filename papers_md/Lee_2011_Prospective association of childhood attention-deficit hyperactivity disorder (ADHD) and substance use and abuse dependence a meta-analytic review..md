Abstract

Given the clinical and public health significance of substance disorders and the need to identify
their early risk factors, we examined the association of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) with substance use (e.g., nicotine, alcohol) and abuse/dependence outcomes
(nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, other). To strengthen a potential causal inference, we meta-
analyzed longitudinal studies that prospectively followed children with and without ADHD into
adolescence or adulthood. Children with ADHD were significantly more likely to have ever used
nicotine and other substances, but not alcohol. Children with ADHD were also more likely to
develop disorders of abuse/dependence for nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and other
substances (i.e., unspecified). Sex, age, race, publication year, sample source, and version of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) used to diagnose ADHD did not
significantly moderate the associations with substance outcomes that yielded heterogeneous effect
sizes. These findings suggest that children with ADHD are significantly more likely to develop
substance use disorders than children without ADHD and that this increased risk is robust to
demographic and methodological differences that varied across the studies. Finally, few studies
addressed ADHD and comorbid disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), thus preventing a formal
meta-analytic review. However, we qualitatively summarize the results of these studies and
conclude that comorbid DBD complicates inferences about the specificity of ADHD effects on
substance use outcomes.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by an early onset of
persistent and impairing levels of inattention-disorganization and hyperactivity-impulsivity
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000). ADHD occurs in 5-10% of school-aged children
(Scahill & Schwab-Stone, 2000) and represents one of the most common referrals for mental
health and pediatric services in the U.S. (Barkley, 1998). ADHD is associated with
comorbid mood (e.g., depression, anxiety) and disruptive behavior disorders (oppositional
defiant disorder [ODD] and conduct disorder [CD]) (DBD), neuropsychological deficits
(e.g., verbal working memory), family problems (e.g., negative parent-child interactions),
poor academic achievement, and social dysfunction (e.g., peer rejection). These associations
have been reported in boys and girls, including as young as preschool who have been
followed prospectively into adolescence and young adulthood (Biederman et al., 2010; Lee,
Lahey, Owens, & Hinshaw, 2008; Owens, Hinshaw, Lee, & Lahey, 2009). Thus, ADHD

predicts a highly dispersed pattern of impairment across behavioral, academic, social,
affective, and family domains (i.e., multifinality).

Substance use disorders (SUD) (i.e., abuse and dependence) also constitute a substantial
clinical, public health, and economic concern in the United States and globally
(Demyttenaere et al., 2004). In 2000, substance dependence specifically accounted for $67
billion in economic loss due to crime, social problems, foster care, and other health services
(McLellan, Lewis, O'Brien, & Kleber, 2000). Among 18–59 year-old individuals
participating in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally-representative
study of English-speaking adults in the United States, lifetime prevalence estimates ranged
from 14.0% to 16.3% and 6.0% to 6.4% for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence disorders,
respectively (Kessler et al., 2005a). For SUD more broadly (i.e., combining abuse and
dependence), the lifetime prevalence in the same age range varied from 15.3% to 18.0%
(Kessler et al., 2005a). Although the 12-month prevalence of SUD in the same sample was
expectedly lower (0.4% for drug dependence to 3.1% for alcohol abuse disorder), the
severity of the disorders, based on functional impairment (e.g., suicide attempts, work
disability, poor social relationships), was moderate to severe for most individuals (Kessler et
al., 2005b). In terms of clinical significance, SUD are frequently comorbid with other
disorders. Substance abuse and dependence was each uniquely associated with increased
comorbidity with mood disorders across six countries, and with externalizing problems (e.g.,
CD, antisocial behavior [ASB]) in the U.S. and Canada specifically (Merikangas et al.,
1998). Finally, in addition to comorbidity, substance problems (e.g., binge drinking) are
often associated with violence, accidental injuries, risky behavior (e.g., sexually transmitted
disease), and poor health outcomes (e.g., hypertension) (Courtney & Polich, 2009). Thus,
SUD are highly prevalent, costly, impairing, and resistant to treatment (Goldstein et al.,
2009). To facilitate the development of interventions, there is an urgent need to identify
precursors of SUD, particularly early in development. Detection of individuals at risk for
SUD may facilitate implementation of early, targeted interventions to prevent the onset of
SUD or to minimize their negative sequelae.

There are several reasons that ADHD and substance problems may be related. First,
dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is central to current models of ADHD and SUD (Bedard
et al., 2009; Ray et al., 2010; Volkow, Fowler, Wang, Baler, & Telang, 2008; Volkow et al.,
2009) and methylphenidate (MPH) is a highly efficacious treatment for the core symptoms
of ADHD, although recent evidence suggests that therapeutic response may be time-limited
(Molina et al., 2008). Positron emission tomography (PET) suggests that MPH enhances
extracellular DA in the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate gyrus (Volkow, Fowler, Wang,
Ding, & Gatley, 2002). MPH, by virtue of activating positive attention networks and
distilling task-irrelevant stimuli, improves attention, vigilance, and motivation (Swanson,
Baler, & Volkow, 2010). Second, a recent review of neuroimaging studies of humans with
ADHD and SUD found replicated evidence of blunted striatal DA release and disrupted
neural circuitry between the anterior cingulate cortex and striatum with prefrontal cortex
(Frodl, 2010). Rodent and non-human primate models suggest the centrality of deficits in
response inhibition, including dysfunctional circuitry in ventrolateral frontal, cingulate
cortices, and basal ganglia regions, in both ADHD and SUD (Groman, James, & Jentsch,
2009). Third, offspring of adults with SUD are more likely to develop psychopathology,
including ADHD (Clark et al., 1997; Schuckit & Smith, 1996). Elevated substance use
problems have also been frequently reported in parents of children with ADHD (Chronis et
al., 2003; Lahey et al., 1988; Molina, Pelham, & Lang, 1997). Finally, the prevalence of
psychopathology, including SUD, is higher in first-degree relatives of ADHD probands than
in healthy controls (Biederman et al., 1992). Therefore, ADHD and SUD may share
common etiological influences, including similar genetic factors (Iacono, Malone, &
McGue, 2008; Young et al., 2009; see Biederman et al., 2009, for an exception).

In fact, there is a sizable body of research suggesting that ADHD is associated with elevated
substance use and related disorders (e.g., Boyle et al., 1993; Clure et al., 1999; Disney,
Elkins, McGue, & Iacono, 1999; Katusic et al., 2005; Mannuzza, Klein, Bessler, Malloy, &
LaPadula, 1993; Milberger et al., 1997a,b; Whalen, Jamner, Henker Delfino, & Lozano,
2002). In a large (n = 240) case-control study, children with ADHD were two times more
likely to develop substance dependence disorders than matched controls (Biederman et al.,
2006). ADHD was also robustly related (odds ratio > 9) to the likelihood of having an SUD
in a study of 968 male adolescents in Brazil (Szobot et al., 2007). Thompson, Riggs,
Mikulich, and Crowley (1996) assessed 171 adolescents with CD in a residential treatment
program and found that ADHD was significantly associated with severe CD and substance
problems. Similarly, ADHD was associated with severe substance dependence in a sample
of 367 clinic-referred male and female adolescents (Whitmore et al., 1997). However, null
associations between ADHD and substance problems have also been reported. In a sample
of 1,302 12-16 year-old adolescents, ADHD was unrelated to substance use and related
problems (Boyle & Offord, 1991). Similarly, in a prospective study of adolescents
diagnosed with ADHD when they were 7-11 years old, maltreatment, but not childhood
ADHD, independently predicted substance problems (De Sanctis et al., 2008). However, the
inconsistent association between ADHD and SUD may also reflect methodological
variability across studies including sample characteristics (e.g., sex, population-based vs.
clinic-referred) and assessment methods (e.g., structured interviews, self-report, abuse/
dependence vs. frequency). For example, in Biederman et al. (2010), girls were originally
ascertained when they were 6-16 years old. Thus, developmentally-sensitive assessments of
SUD must consider the censored nature of the age of participants at follow-up and the
potential that substance patterns may reflect age-related differences in substance exposure
and availability rather than diagnostic differences per se.

Overall, the predictive validity of ADHD for SUD is unknown. Although future research on
ADHD and substance outcomes must improve the methodological limitations described
above, it is crucial to understand what the literature currently suggests. The goal of this
meta-analysis was to characterize the most informative studies, which are likely to be
prospective follow-up studies of children with and without ADHD into adolescence/
adulthood. Prospective longitudinal studies significantly improve the empirical basis for
determining direction of effects, evaluating meditational processes, and differentiating
correlates, risk factors, and causal risk factors (Kraemer, Stice, Kazin, Offord, & Kuper,
2001). Indeed, temporal ordering of predictors and outcome is one of few methodological
devices available to disentangle correlated constructs (Kraemer et al., 2001). Second, meta-
analysis rigorously evaluates associations from smaller studies, which is often the case for
prospective longitudinal designs (Keenan & Shaw, 1997). To test the predictive validity of
ADHD and SUD from methodologically diverse samples, a meta-analysis may provide
superior traction relative to a single, larger study. Our aim was two-fold: (1) To meta-
analyze the prospective contribution of childhood ADHD (versus control) on dichotomized
measures of lifetime substance use and abuse/dependence across nicotine, alcohol,
marijuana, and cocaine; and (2) To test theoretically- and methodologically-relevant
moderators (i.e., age, sex, race (percent Caucasian), DSM version, sample source) of these
putative associations if and when significant heterogeneity in effect size was found.

without ADHD with substance use, SUD, or odds ratios provided; (e) publication between
1980 and August 2009 in English; and (f) a non-intervention design. We prioritized case-
control designs to improve the generalizability of the study to other children with ADHD
(i.e., diagnostic criteria + impairment) and to specifically compare the likelihood of SUD in
youth with and without ADHD. We also selected substance abuse/dependence outcomes to
emphasize clinical significance (Kazdin, 1999). Given that experimentation with substances
is often normative in adolescence (Moffitt, 1993), we chose outcomes that included
impairment (i.e., failure to fulfill obligations, failed attempts to quit). Given that ADHD also
predicts functional impairment, we cannot be certain that these clinically significant
outcomes are attributable to substance patterns rather than the influence of ADHD (e.g.,
impulsivity). However, clinically significant dichotomous outcomes also resonate with
person-centered research strategies that are central to developmental psychopathology
(Bergman, von Eye, & Magnusson, 2006). Dichotomization does not significantly reduce
statistical power and it yields meaningful effect sizes (i.e., odds ratios) (Farrington &
Loeber, 2000). Finally, the intervention selection bias is a threat to internal validity in
uncontrolled studies because treatment status is often positively correlated with negative
outcomes (Larzelere, Kuhn, & Johnson, 2004). That is, severity of psychopathology may
account for treatment status and outcome. To avoid misrepresenting the association of early
ADHD and later SUD, we did not control for treatment status. We also excluded controlled
intervention studies in an effort to focus on the naturalistic course of ADHD over time.

Search Procedure

We employed several strategies to identify the 27 studies included in this meta-analysis. We
conducted computer-based searches using the PsycInfo, PubMed, and Google Scholar
databases. These inquiries entailed searching according to the following keywords (or stems
when possible): alcohol, nicotine, smoking, tobacco, cigarette, marijuana, cannabis, cocaine,
substance(s), drug(s), ADHD, ADD, attention-deficit, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, hyperactivity, hyperactive, hyperkinetic, longitudinal, and prospective. Keywords
were combined by using the Boolean operators “AND” and “OR.” Unpublished
dissertations were also reviewed for potential inclusion. We also used the ancestry approach
where potential studies were identified from the reference sections of existing reviews on the
association of ADHD and SUD. Moreover, we thoroughly reviewed the bibliographies of
identified studies for additional studies and used both forward and backward searching. To
combat the file drawer problem, we also attempted to locate unpublished studies (Rosenthal,
1979). Emails describing our study and its inclusion criteria were sent to membership
listservs of research organizations including the International Society for Research in Child
and Adolescent Psychopathology, Division 53 (Society for Clinical Child and Adolescent
Psychology) of the American Psychological Association, and the Research Society on
Alcoholism. However, all of the studies included in our meta-analysis were published in
peer-reviewed journals. The majority of studies was excluded for the following reasons: (a)
they were qualitative reviews, (b) ADHD and substance constructs were only measured
using dimensional approaches (i.e., no formal diagnosis), or (c) ADHD designations did not
precede the measurement of substance use. When multiple studies with the same substance
outcome were derived from the same sample, the most recent publication was used (i.e., the
longest follow-up period from baseline). Coding of individual studies was conducted by two
intensively trained raters. We evaluated the reliability of all moderator codes (a total of 168)
and the percentage agreement was very high (95.2%). In cases where raters provided
contradictory judgments, disagreements were discussed and one of the authors (KLH) made
a final determination.

Moderator Variables

Page 5

We tested whether demographic/methodological factors across the studies moderated the
association between childhood ADHD and SUD for studies with heterogeneous effect sizes.
The following demographic characteristics were coded: (a) average age of the sample at
follow-up (in years); (b) gender composition (% male); and (c) racial diversity (%
Caucasian). Methodological characteristics of each study were coded as follows: (a) sample
source (clinic-referred vs. other), for both the ADHD and non-ADHD samples and (b)
version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) used to
diagnose ADHD (i.e., DSM-III and DSM-III-R versus DSM-IV). The final moderator was
the average number of years between the initial assessment and follow-up (less than 5 years
vs. 5 to 10 years vs. greater than 10 years).

Calculation of Effect Size

We calculated the odds ratio (OR) to estimate the effect size and significance of the
association between diagnostic status (ADHD vs. control) and two separate substance
measures: (a) use vs. no use and (b) abuse or dependence versus non-abuse/dependence. The
odds ratio was computed by the formula (a+d)/(b+c), where a represented the number of
individuals with ADHD who positively reported substance use or abuse/dependence; b
represented the number of youth with ADHD who denied substance use or abuse/
dependence; c represented the number of individuals in the control group who positively
endorsed substance use or abuse/dependence; and d represented the number of control youth
without substance use or abuse/dependence. When a cell had a value of 0, we followed
expert recommendations and inserted .5 to all four cells to calculate the effect size (Lipsey
& Wilson, 2001). An OR of 1 indicated that membership in the dichotomous substance
outcome category was equivalent in children with and without ADHD whereas an OR
greater than 1 indicated that the outcome was more likely in the ADHD group. An OR of
less than 1 indicated that the outcome was less likely to occur in the ADHD group. The
association of ADHD and substance outcome is statistically significant when the 95%
confidence interval for the OR effect size does not include 1.0. If the 95% confidence
interval included 1.0, the effect indicated statistical equivalence between the ADHD and
control group. For each study, the OR was separately calculated for each available substance
outcome measure. Thus, in the same study, as many as eight ORs could be derived that
corresponded to the three substance use outcomes (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana) and five
abuse/dependence outcomes (nicotine dependence, alcohol abuse/dependence, marijuana
abuse/dependence, cocaine abuse/dependence, and non-specified drug abuse/dependence).
Using these procedures, a total 65 effect sizes were calculated from 27 eligible studies.

Statistical analysis

We employed a random-effects model where an OR for each substance outcome was
weighted by the inverse variance of the OR. A random-effects model is more appropriate
when the variability of findings is assumed to be attributed to other factors than subject-level
sampling error (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). In addition to calculating the mean effect size and
its 95% confidence interval, we estimated heterogeneity of effects using the standard
Cochran's Q Test and publication bias using Egger's (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder,
1997) and Begg's tests (Begg & Mazumdar, 1994). We also calculated the Fail safe N to
assess the potential for a file-drawer problem and evidence that any of the moderator
variables predicted significant variance in the effect sizes where analyses resulted in
significant heterogeneity. The meta-analysis was performed using STATA 11 with the meta,
metareg, and metabias commands.

Results

To review, we evaluated the prospective contribution of childhood ADHD on measures of
lifetime adolescent/adult substance use and abuse/dependence. We conducted separate meta-
analyses across different substance types to examine the specificity of effects of early
ADHD. We utilized random-effects models to estimate the mean effect size (and 95%
confidence interval), statistical significance of the OR, and the χ2-based Q statistic for
heterogeneity. The Q statistic approximates a chi-square distribution with k − 1 degrees of
freedom, where k is the number of effect sizes, and it indicates the degree of consistency of
findings across studies (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). Each of these parameters was estimated for
the following dichotomous substance measures: (a) lifetime nicotine use, (b) nicotine
dependence, (c) lifetime alcohol use, (d) alcohol abuse or dependence, (e) lifetime marijuana
use, (f) marijuana abuse or dependence, (g) cocaine abuse or dependence, and (h) general
illicit drug abuse or dependence (i.e., drug type not specified in the original study).

Although Table 1 summarizes the clinical, demographic, and methodological features of all
27 studies included in the meta-analysis, we note that that there were 4142 to 4175 ADHD
probands and 6835 to 6880 non-ADHD controls available for analysis (depending on the
specific substance outcome analyzed). Based on studies that reported relevant data, the
overall sample consisted mostly of Caucasian (88.9%; 15 studies) boys (74.2%; 26 studies).
The average age at follow-up for participants was 18.9 years (24 studies). The sample size
for ADHD probands and non-ADHD controls, respectively, was as follows: 1648 and 2323
for lifetime nicotine use; 2459 and 2950 for nicotine dependence; 872 and 597 for lifetime
alcohol use; 1337 and 1195 for alcohol abuse or dependence; 600 and 2661 for lifetime
marijuana use; 943 and 1885 for marijuana abuse or dependence (excluding Gignac et al.
(2005)); 652 and 481 for cocaine abuse or dependence; and 542 and 637 for non-specific
substance abuse or dependence.

Nicotine Use and Dependence

As shown in Figure 1, children with ADHD were twice as likely to have a lifetime history of
ever having used nicotine (OR = 2.08, CI = 1.66, 2.60, p < .001) compared to children
without ADHD. The overall homogeneity statistic for nicotine use indicated that the effect
sizes of the nine studies included in this analysis were comparable (Q = 12.82, p = 0.12). A
similar association was also observed for childhood ADHD and nicotine dependence.
Children with ADHD were nearly three times more likely than children without ADHD to
report nicotine dependence in adolescence/adulthood (OR = 2.82, CI = 2.41, 3.29, p < .001)
(Figure 2). The overall homogeneity statistic for nicotine dependence indicated that the
twelve studies included in this analysis were largely uniform in their estimates (Q = 5.92, p
= .25).

Alcohol Use and Abuse/Dependence

Figure 3 summarizes the individual effect sizes for each study and the aggregated estimate
for lifetime history of ever having used alcohol for children with and without ADHD. Unlike
nicotine use, children with ADHD were no more likely to have ever used alcohol than
children without ADHD (OR = 1.27, CI = 0.85, 1.89, p = .25), as evidenced by the lower
bound of the confidence interval falling below 1.0. The overall homogeneity statistic for
alcohol use indicated that the five studies included in this analysis indicated a trend for
effect size heterogeneity (Q = 8.26, p = .08). For alcohol abuse/dependence, childhood
ADHD was significantly related to an increased risk for alcohol use disorder (OR = 1.74, CI
= 1.38, 2.20, p < .001) (Figure 4). Specifically, children with ADHD were 1.7 times more
likely to meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence than children without

ADHD. The overall homogeneity statistic for alcohol dependence indicated no significant
heterogeneity across the 11 studies (Q = 13.20, p = .21).

Marijuana Use and Abuse/Dependence

Childhood ADHD was robustly related to an increased odds of lifetime marijuana use (OR =
2.78, CI = 1.64, 4.74, p < .001). Specifically, children with ADHD were nearly three times
more likely to have reported ever having used marijuana than children without ADHD
(Figure 5). However, the overall homogeneity statistic for marijuana use indicated that the
seven studies included in this analysis showed statistically significant variability in their
effect size estimates (Q = 20.38, p < .01). This suggests that the overall effect size
associating early ADHD with a higher likelihood of future adolescent/adult marijuana use
should be interpreted cautiously. Results from our analysis of marijuana abuse or
dependence revealed that children with ADHD were more than twice as likely to have met
criteria for marijuana use disorder than children without ADHD (OR = 2.29, CI = 1.32, 3.99,
p = .003). However, the overall homogeneity statistic for marijuana abuse/dependence
indicated that the 10 studies included in this analysis showed significant variability in their
effect sizes (Q = 45.07, p < .001). In particular, Gignac et al. (2005) reported an effect size
that was more than two standard deviations above the grand mean. To assess the influence
of this study, we removed it and re-analyzed the data. Without the Gignac et al. (2005)
study, the homogeneity statistic was largely normalized (Q = 11.81, p = .16). The
recalculated effect size (OR = 1.58, CI = 1.16, 2.14, p = .003) revealed that children with
ADHD were approximately 1.5 times more likely than children without ADHD to develop
marijuana abuse or dependence (Figure 6).

Cocaine Abuse or Dependence

Children with ADHD were significantly more likely to develop cocaine abuse or
dependence in adolescence/adulthood than children without ADHD (OR = 2.05, CI = 1.38,
3.04, p < .001) (Figure 7). Children with ADHD were twice as likely to develop cocaine
abuse or dependence than children without ADHD. The Q test indicated minimal
heterogeneity in the five studies (Q = 1.80, p = .77), thus strengthening our inference that
each study was relatively consistent in its estimation of the association between ADHD and
cocaine abuse/dependence.

General Illicit Drug Abuse/Dependence

The overall effect for drug abuse/dependence, defined by studies that did not explicitly
specify the substance, also revealed higher rates abuse/dependence among children with
ADHD (OR = 2.64, CI = 1.77, 3.94, p < .001; Figure 8). Specifically, individuals with
ADHD were more than two and half times as likely as controls to develop general illicit
substance abuse/dependence. The overall homogeneity statistic indicated that the effect size
of the six studies included in the analysis were not heterogeneous (Q = 5.64, p = .34).

Publication Bias

We conducted the Egger's publication bias test and all tests were non-significant. The Begg's
funnel plots also suggested no evidence of publication bias. We also used Orwin's (1983)
formula for the fail-safe N to determine the number of studies that would be needed to
reduce the findings to non-significance. Using an OR of 1 as the critical effect size value, for
each outcome in which a significant group difference in substance use outcomes was found,
we determined the number of additional studies with an effect size showing equivalence
between groups (i.e., OR = 1) that would have needed to be included in our meta-analysis to
alter the effect of ADHD status. The following number of studies was indicated: 9 for
lifetime nicotine use, 25 for nicotine dependence, 11 for alcohol abuse/dependence, 18 for

lifetime marijuana use, 12 for marijuana abuse/dependence (excluding Gignac et al., 2005),
4 for cocaine abuse/dependence, 17 for general drug abuse/dependence. These numbers
suggest that it is relatively unlikely that unpublished studies would change the significant
contribution of ADHD to substance problems.

Moderators

To further explore the nature of the association between ADHD and future substance
patterns in those effect sizes with heterogeneity (i.e., alcohol use, marijuana use), we
examined potential moderators using the metareg command for simple regressions. We
separately tested the following variables as potential moderators: sex, average age at follow-
up, race (i.e., percent Caucasian), sample source for both the ADHD and non-ADHD
groups, version of the DSM used to ascertain ADHD, and average length of time between
initial assessment and follow-up.

Comorbid Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD)

Given the substantial comorbidity between ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders (DBD),
including ODD and CD (Barkley, 2006), as well as the robust relations between ODD/CD
and substance outcomes (see Flory & Lynam, 2003 for a review), the conclusions suggested
from this meta-analysis must be interpreted cautiously. We had initially intended to include
comorbid ODD/CD as a moderator of ADHD predictions of substance outcomes in our
meta-analysis. However, a careful review of the existing literature revealed surprisingly few
studies that adequately addressed this comorbidity and that satisfied our inclusion criteria.
For example, there was little consistency in the measurement of ODD/CD, particularly with
respect to temporal factors (i.e., some studies measured CD during childhood, some
concurrently during adolescence, and some used a combination). Therefore, this significant
variability prevented our ability to formally examine ODD/CD comorbidity in the meta-
analysis. Nevertheless, we strongly contend that DBD should be addressed, even if
informally. Thus, we review existing findings here so that they can be interpreted
concurrently with the results of the meta-analysis.

A thorough search of the literature identified 10 longitudinal studies of substance outcomes
that measured ODD/CD and ADHD. For the present summary, we included only
prospective longitudinal studies that utilized dichotomous measurement of all variables to
enhance comparability with the studies in the meta-analysis. All 10 studies prospectively
followed clinical or community samples of children with ADHD into adolescence or young
adulthood where group differences (e.g., ADHD alone vs. ADHD + ODD/CD vs. controls)
in substance outcomes were examined. Overall, our review suggests that comorbid ADHD +
ODD/CD children may demonstrate significantly greater substance problems than children
with ADHD only and controls (when included).

For instance, in a 10-year prospective study of youth with ADHD (n = 27), ADHD + ODD/
CD (n = 82), and controls (n = 91), children with ADHD + ODD/CD group had significantly
higher rates of regular tobacco use and alcohol and marijuana SUD than either the ADHD
only or control groups (August et al., 2006). Similarly, in a longitudinal study of 364
adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and 240 matched
controls, Molina, Pelham, Gnagy, Thompson, and Marshal (2007) found that adolescents
with concurrent ADHD and CD were more likely to have an alcohol use disorder than
controls. In this study, a direct comparison was not made between adolescents with ADHD
+ CD and those with ADHD alone; however, results indicated that those with ADHD + CD
reported nearly five times the rate of alcohol use disorders than did youth with ADHD alone.
In another prospective study of 177 clinic-referred boys, a significant bivariate relation

between childhood ADHD and adolescent tobacco use was reduced to nonsignificance once
childhood CD was included in the model (Burke, Loeber, & Lahey, 2001).

In an effort to further explore how the course of CD over time impacts the relation between
ADHD and substance outcomes, Biederman and colleagues conducted two studies of 140
boys diagnosed with ADHD. At the 4-year follow-up, cigarette smoking, drug and alcohol
dependence, and SUD in general were significantly elevated among participants with
persisting symptoms of CD (N=24) versus those with desisting symptoms of CD (N=18),
and those without CD (N=73) (Biederman, Mick, Faraone, & Burback, 2001). Similarly, at
the 10-year follow-up of the same sample, the presence of CD along with ADHD was
significantly associated with increased risk for psychoactive substance use disorders
(defined as alcohol or drug abuse or dependence) compared to ADHD alone (Biederman et
al., 2008). Loeber et al. (1999) also examined the effects of persistent delinquency and
ADHD on substance use among a large longitudinal sample of approximately 500 boys.
Results revealed that ADHD did not predict substance use once persistent delinquency and
internalizing problems were controlled.

Two older studies which did not use current DSM ADHD diagnostic criteria also found
results consistent with the six studies previously reviewed. August, Stewart, and Holmes
(1983) followed 22 purely hyperactive (later classified as meeting DSM-III ADD criteria)
and 30 hyperactive/unsocialized-aggressive boys for 4 years, examining alcohol and/or drug
abuse (broadly measured) at follow-up. Results revealed that no purely hyperactive boys
endorsed substance abuse, whereas a statistically significant 30% of the hyperactive/
unsocialized-aggressive boys did endorse substance abuse at follow-up. Similarly, in an 8-
year follow-up of 158 hyperactive children (later characterized as likely to meet DSM-III-R
ADHD criteria) and 81 controls, Barkley and colleagues found that purely hyperactive
children had no greater use of cigarettes and marijuana than controls whereas a comorbid
hyperactive/CD group had 2-5 times the use of these substances compared to purely
hyperactive or control youth (Barkley, Fischer, Edelbrock, & Smallish, 1990).

Interestingly, two studies found that ADHD was independently associated with substance
outcomes. In a 28-year prospective study of 492 children with ADHD and age-matched
controls, Lambert (2005) found that ADHD increased the odds of tobacco, cocaine, and
amphetamine dependence whereas child conduct problems did not increase these odds after
other variables were controlled. Similarly, among a very large sample of twins followed
from ages 11 to 18, Elkins, McGue, and Iacono (2007) found that, at the age 14 follow-up,
ADHD significantly predicted tobacco and illicit drug use initiation even when childhood
CD was taken into account. However, at the age 18 follow-up, ADHD did not predict any
substance outcomes independent of CD. One final study which was identified in our
literature search (Ernst et al., 2006) only included one participant with ADHD + CD. Thus,
their results are not generalizable.

Discussion

Childhood ADHD is a reliable predictor of negative outcomes across academic, social,
neuropsychological, and affective domains. Hence, multifinality, where multiple negative
outcomes share a common developmental origin, is a defining feature of ADHD (Cicchetti,
2006). However, far less is known about the prospective contribution of childhood ADHD to
subsequent substance use and related disorders (abuse/dependence) than these other
domains. To quantitatively characterize the association of ADHD on SUD and to strengthen
a potential causal inference by establishing temporal ordering, we focused on prospective
longitudinal studies (Kraemer et al., 2001). Our meta-analysis provides persuasive evidence
of three key findings: (a) childhood ADHD conferred a significant increase in the odds of

ever having used nicotine or illicit drugs, but not for alcohol; (b) childhood ADHD
prospectively predicted the likelihood of developing adolescent/adult nicotine, alcohol,
marijuana, and cocaine use disorders (i.e., abuse or dependence), as well as unspecified drug
abuse/dependence; and (c) empirical tests of potential moderators for outcomes with
heterogeneity in effect size estimates, consisting of demographic or methodological features
that varied across studies, were not significant. That is, the reported effect sizes for ADHD
and substance problems did not differ significantly by average age at follow-up, gender,
race, sample source (clinic-referred vs. school-/population-based), or DSM version used to
determine ADHD. In addition to the statistical significance of the association between
ADHD and substance problems, we emphasize the size of the effects: children with ADHD
were at least 1.5 times more likely to develop SUD across diverse forms of substances,
including nearly 3 times higher for nicotine dependence. Considered together, our results
suggest that early ADHD strongly predicts future substance abuse/dependence in
adolescence/adulthood and that this association is largely impervious to demographic and
methodological factors that varied across each study.

Overall, findings from previous studies of ADHD and comorbid ODD/CD predicting
substance use outcomes are somewhat consistent, and they suggest that the relation between
ADHD and substance outcomes in the literature (and potentially in our meta-analysis) may
be partially or fully accounted for by the comorbidity between ADHD and ODD/CD, which
is robustly related to substance outcomes. However, it is crucial to note that this
characterization is based on only ten published studies and a literature with highly variable
methods, including sample characteristics. For example, the study of Burke et al. (2001) was
based exclusively on clinic-referred boys whereas the Loeber et al. (1999) study was based
on a high-risk epidemiological sample. In fact, we were surprised at how infrequent
comorbid ODD/CD was accounted for in the literature (either statistically controlled or
explicit interactive effects between ADHD and ODD/CD). Thus, we echo the prescient
review of Lilienfeld and Waldman (1990) who observed that prospective studies of ADHD
and antisocial behavior (ASB) outcomes were likely contaminated by high rates of ODD/
CD. That is, the association between ADHD and substance problems cannot be adequately
discerned until its frequent comorbidity with ODD/CD is cogently addressed. Additionally,
researchers must adopt greater consistency in how ODD/CD is measured and
conceptualized. For instance, studies varied in their ascertainment of ODD/CD, ranging
from adult retrospective recall of childhood CD, to concurrent assessment of adolescent CD,
to measures of childhood ADHD and CD gathered concurrently in a prospective study, to
some combination of these strategies. This variability may influence how or whether the
relation between ADHD and substance outcomes is accounted for by comorbid ODD/CD.
Moreover, equifinality suggests that there are multiple pathways to SUD that may involve
ADHD and ODD/CD to varying degrees (Cicchetti, 2006).

Limitations and Guidelines for Future Research

Although dimensional perspectives on psychopathology, including ADHD and SUD, have
considerable empirical support (Barkley, 2003; Helzer et al., 2006; Neuman et al., 1999),
our meta-analysis was limited to dichotomous designations of ADHD and substance use and
abuse/dependence disorders. Thus, within each diagnostic group, there is likely to be
significant variability. For example, in two separate studies, children with ADHD varied
dramatically with respect to the precise combination of functional impairments
demonstrated in adolescence across affective, social, and behavioral domains, although
ADHD probands were reliably more impaired than youth without ADHD (Lee et al,. 2008;
Owens et al., 2009). Similarly, the family context of ADHD is likely to contribute to the
developmental course of ADHD (i.e., persistent vs. less severe) based on factors such as
parenting and parent psychopathology (Chronis et al., 2007). An important question not

addressed by this meta-analysis is if ADHD is associated with the timing of substance use
disorders (e.g., earlier onset). Other studies (Odgers et al., 2008) suggest that age of onset of
substance use is inversely related to negative outcomes and that this association is not
exclusively explained by more conduct problems in early-onset substance users. If ADHD is
related to an earlier onset of substance use/problems, this would suggest that preventive
interventions must be implemented earlier in development for children with ADHD.

This meta-analysis also did not clarify potential differences among ADHD subtypes, an
important consideration given that Combined-type ADHD is more strongly associated with
externalizing disorders than other subtypes (Lahey et al., 1994; 2004). Moreover, even if all
ADHD subtypes show significant associations with future SUD, one cannot assume that the
mechanisms underlying those associations are identical (Hinshaw & Lee, 2003). For
example, the association between Combined-type ADHD and SUD may be driven by
comorbidity with ODD/CD whereas the association between Inattentive-type ADHD and
SUD may be driven by the need to temporarily ameliorate neurocognitive deficits, including
sluggish cognitive tempo (Milich, Balentine, & Lynam, 2001). Similarly, because of our
dichotomous approach to ADHD, we were unable to examine the differential contribution of
inattention-disorganization versus hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms to SUD. Previous
evidence suggests that inattention and hyperactivity may be differentially related to
substance outcomes, including some studies implicating a stronger contribution from
inattention (Molina & Pelham, 2003) and others from hyperactivity (Lee & Hinshaw, 2006).
Finally, the intervention selection bias (Larzelere, Kuhn, & Johnson, 2004) threatens the
internal validity of uncontrolled studies because intervention status typically correlates
positively with psychopathology and its severity. Although our meta-analysis excluded
controlled intervention studies, the precise contribution of treatment status to variability in
substance outcomes was not definitively addressed.

Our preceding review of the potential importance of comorbid ODD/CD in studies of
ADHD and substance outcomes necessitates a careful discussion of comorbidity more
broadly, including ADHD and its frequent overlap with mood and anxiety disorders
(Angold, Costello, & Erkanli, 1999). Unfortunately, our meta-analysis was unable to
accommodate moderator analyses for disorders commonly comorbid with ADHD, including
ODD/CD, depression, and anxiety. Although there may be differential patterns of prediction
of SUD based on ADHD and its comorbidity (e.g., ADHD + ODD/CD), these groups may
also represent a latent continuums characterized by heterotypic continuity rather than
discrete disorders with separate etiologies (Patterson, DeGarmo, & Knutson, 2000; Shaw &
Winslow, 1997). In fact, common influences across these phenotypes (e.g., disruptive
parenting practices, deviant peer affiliation) may work synergistically with
neurodevelopmental influences that are particularly salient in adolescence, including striatal
dopamine and its influence on reward sensitivity and risk-taking (Galvan, 2010). Finally,
some dimensions of anxiety may actually protect individuals with ADHD from risk-taking,
externalizing behavior, or SUD (Levy, 2004). Thus, future research must consider
comorbidity and the potential for interactive effects with ADHD, particularly across time.

Our meta-analysis provides further evidence that childhood ADHD is prospectively
associated with a distressing array of negative outcomes, adding to previous studies that
implicated ADHD with elevated rates of comorbid mood, anxiety, and externalizing
problems (Biederman et al., 2010; Hinshaw, Owens, Sami, & Fargeon, 2006). In addition to
conducting prospective longitudinal studies, future research must obtain greater traction on
identifying the complex and potentially diverse mechanisms and pathways that lead from
early ADHD to later SUD. There is evidence that academic problems and peer difficulties
mediate the association between early behavior problems, including ADHD, and subsequent
depression (i.e., dual failure model; Herman, Lambert, Ialongo, & Ostrander, 2007; Burke,

Loeber, Lahey, & Rathouz, 2005; Capaldi & Stoolmiller, 1999). Previously identified
mediators of ADHD and SUD also include deviant peer affiliation, coping, and parental
support (Molina, Marshal, Pelham, & Wirth, 2005; Marshal, Molina, & Pelham, 2003). We
propose that neuropsychological correlates of ADHD, including executive function (EF)
deficits (e.g., response inhibition, planning, cognitive flexibility), should be tested as
mediators given that EF is strongly associated with ADHD and independently predicts
externalizing behavior and substance problems (Nigg et al., 2006). Given that mediators are
targets for intervention, they offer the possibility to interrupt the cascade of negative
sequelae associated with a predictor of negative outcomes. Thus, meditational analyses of
ADHD-substance linkages must be prioritized in future studies. We also advocate that
careful attention be paid to design features of existing studies and their potential influence
on results. Wide age ranges in prospective studies of children with ADHD require extended
follow-up to ensure that participants have equally entered periods of adolescent risk when
substance experimentation often emerges (Moffitt, 1993).

Although meta-analyses support the efficacy of MPH in the treatment of ADHD (Faraone,
Spencer, Aleardi, Pagano, & Biederman, 2004; Schachter, Pham, King, Langford, & Moher,
2001), there are unresolved questions about the development of future substance problems in
children treated with stimulant medication (Kollins, 2008; Volkow, 2008). For example,
Wilens, Faraone, Biederman, & Gunawardene (2003) reported that stimulant medication
substantially reduced the risk for future substance problems, but two recent studies failed to
replicate the protective effects of MPH (Biederman et al., 2008; Mannuzza et al., 2008). In
one study, exposure to stimulant medication was positively associated with future substance
use (Lambert & Hartsough, 1998). Given that MPH and amphetamines have similar neural
reward properties and that repeated exposure to stimulants alters the sensitivity of dopamine
receptors in non-human animals, concerns have been raised about the relative safety of MPH
and its potential to increase neural sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of stimulants (and
to substances more broadly) (Vitiello, 2001; Kollins, 2003). Despite neurodevelopmental
evidence that the timing of exposure to stimulants in non-human animals adversely affects
outcomes (i.e., earlier exposure was associated with worse outcomes), a recent study found
that children who received treatment with stimulants early in development (< 8 years old)
were less likely to develop substance problems than those treated with stimulants later in life
(8-12 years). Specifically, children in the latter group were more likely to develop non-
alcohol substance problems, and the association between age of stimulant treatment and
substance problems was mediated by antisocial personality disorder (Mannuzza et al., 2008).
Collectively, these studies underscore that treatment of ADHD with stimulant medication
and its prospective contribution to substance use problems must be more precisely
characterized in future studies.

Although the cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce substance problems
primarily through the prevention of mental disorders may be prohibitive, there is
considerable interest in the potential contribution of childhood ADHD to the development of
future SUD (Armstrong & Costello, 2002; Flory & Lynam, 2003; Molina et al., 2007;
Molina & Pelham, 2003). If ADHD is causally related to SUD, then tailored prevention
programs could be delivered to youth with ADHD prior to the developmental periods of
greatest risk for substance initiation and progression to problem use. For example, parent-
and family-based interventions for ADHD youth should emphasize the potential importance
of parental monitoring (i.e., knowing the child's peers, recreational activities, and
whereabouts after school), given its centrality to the onset of adolescent substance use and
subsequent prevention of deviant peer affiliation (Steinberg, Fletcher, & Darling, 1994). In
addition, interventions that reduce ADHD may also effectively reduce the risk of SUD and/
or make substance problems more responsive to interventions. This is a crucial consideration
given that psychopathology (e.g., ADHD, depression) and comorbid SUD are particularly

resistant to intervention (Goldstein et al., 2009; Wilens, 2003) and that patients often delay
treatment many years after the onset of the disorder (Kessler et al., 2001). We also
emphasize that SUD must be thoughtfully assessed among adolescents and adults with a
history of early ADHD. In particular, clinical ascertainment must differentiate
experimentation from problematic substance use (e.g., functional impairment), given that
children with ADHD were no more likely to have used alcohol than non-ADHD controls in
our analysis. In other words, over-simplified designations of substance use are likely to
betray important differences in underlying risk factors. For example, clinicians should
separately consider positive versus negative reinforcement processes underlying substance
problems given their differential contribution to risk-taking behavior in adolescents,
particularly as a function of individual differences in distress tolerance (MacPherson et al.,
2010).

In sum, childhood ADHD is associated with a substantially higher risk of a lifetime history
of nicotine and illicit substance use, in addition to nicotine dependence, alcohol, marijuana,
cocaine, and illicit drug abuse/dependence. Although the mechanisms governing these
associations are not yet fully understood, the findings from this meta-analysis underscore the
clinical and public health significance of ADHD and its persistent effects into adolescence
and adulthood (i.e., multifinality). To more rigorously evaluate a potential causal role of
ADHD in the development of SUD, ongoing intervention studies of ADHD must
concurrently assess substance problems and whether they respond favorably to standard
ADHD intervention methods (e.g., methylphenidate, behavior management). Furthermore,
more intensive neural (e.g., striatal, anterior cingulate cortex) and genetic (e.g., dopamine
neurotransmission) assays of potential common etiological influences on ADHD and SUD
should refine our understanding of their comorbidity and may signal logical targets for
pharmacological interventions.
