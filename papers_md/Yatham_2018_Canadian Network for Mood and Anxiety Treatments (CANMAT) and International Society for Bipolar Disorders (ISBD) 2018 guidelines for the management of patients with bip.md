updated after the first online publication 
on 21st April 2018].

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) previously pub-

lished treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, along with international com-

mentaries  and  subsequent  updates  in  2007,  2009,  and  2013.  The  last  two  updates 

were  published  in  collaboration  with  the  International  Society  for  Bipolar  Disorders 

(ISBD). These 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Treatment Guidelines represent the 

significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, includ-

ing updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacologi-

cal and psychological treatments. These advances have been translated into clear and 

easy to use recommendations for first , second, and third- line treatments, with consid-

eration given to levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, 

and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment- emergent switch risk. New 

to these guidelines, hierarchical rankings were created for first  and second-  line treat-

ments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in 

bipolar  I  disorder.  Created  by  considering  the  impact  of  each  treatment  across  all 

phases of illness, this hierarchy will further assist clinicians in making evidence- based 

treatment decisions. Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperi-

done, risperidone, and cariprazine alone or in combination are recommended as first- 

line  treatments  for  acute  mania.  First- line  options  for  bipolar  I  depression  include 

quetiapine,  lurasidone  plus  lithium  or  divalproex,  lithium,  lamotrigine,  lurasidone,  or 

adjunctive lamotrigine. While medications that have been shown to be effective for 

the acute phase should generally be continued for the maintenance phase in bipolar I 

disorder, there are some exceptions (such as with antidepressants); and available data 

suggest  that  lithium,  quetiapine,  divalproex,  lamotrigine,  asenapine,  and  aripiprazole 

monotherapy or combination treatments should be considered first-line for those ini-

tiating or switching treatment during the maintenance phase. In addition to addressing 

issues in bipolar I disorder, these guidelines also provide an overview of, and recom-

mendations for, clinical management of bipolar II disorder, as well as advice on specific 

populations, such as women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and 

adolescents, and older adults. There are also discussions on the impact of specific psy-

chiatric and medical comorbidities such as substance use, anxiety, and metabolic disor-

ders. Finally, an overview of issues related to safety and monitoring is provided. The 

CANMAT and ISBD groups hope that these guidelines become a valuable tool for prac-

titioners across the globe.

What are hierarchical rankings?

Hierarchical rankings of treatment op(cid:13)ons are new to the 2018 Guidelines. They were created for ﬁrst and second line treatment
recommenda(cid:13)ons for acute mania, depression, and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder; and will further assist clinicians in making
evidence based treatment decisions.  

These orders were created by considering the eﬃcacy of each treatment across all phases, as well as acute and maintenance safety and
tolerability and the risk for treatment emergent switch. Thus, for example if two treatments were shown to be similarly eﬀec(cid:13)ve in acute
mania, and if only one of these treatments has demonstrated eﬃcacy for maintenance treatment, or had be€er safety or tolerability, that
treatment would be placed higher in the hierarchical recommenda(cid:13)on.

When making treatment decisions, we recommend that agents listed higher in the hierarchy be tried ﬁrst, unless there are pa(cid:13)ent-speciﬁc
reasons for choosing an agent lower in the order (such as pa(cid:13)ent preference, prior treatment non/response, or clinical features which favor
treatments lower in the ranking).

and  hierarchical  rankings  of  treatment  options  for  acute  mania 

(Section  3)  and  depression  (Section  4)  are  reviewed,  and  include 

descriptions  of  clinical  features  that  may  help  direct  treatment 

choices. The  importance  of  long- term  maintenance  treatment  and 

promotion of treatment adherence for mood stability, as well as hi-

erarchical rankings of treatment options are discussed in Section 5. 

An expert review of the available evidence for treatments of bipolar 

II disorder (BDII) and recommendations based on those findings are 

presented in Section 6. The management issues related to specific 

populations, including women at various stages of the reproductive 

cycle, children and adolescents, older adults, and those with psychi-

atric or medical comorbidity are each discussed in Section 7. Finally,

applicable  for  practitioners  from  across  the  globe.  As  with  previous 

publications,  CANMAT will  strive  to  publish  regular  updates  to  these 

guidelines, incorporating new knowledge useful for practising clinicians.

As not all medications included in these guidelines will be available 

in all countries, including Canada, clinicians are advised to follow the 

recommendations of local regulatory bodies.

2.1 | Epidemiology

2.1.1 | Prevalence

Bipolar disorder is a common and disabling mental illness with signifi-

cant morbidity and mortality. The estimates of prevalence of BD vary. 

The World Mental Health Survey Initiative reported total lifetime (and 

12- month) prevalence estimates of 2.4% (1.5%) across BDI, BDII and 

subthreshold BD subtypes. While the prevalence rates for each sub-

type  varied  across  the  nine  countries  studied,  subthreshold  BD  was 

the most common at 1.4% (0.8%), followed by BDI at 0.6% (0.4%) and 
BDII  at  0.4%  (0.3%).6  While  Canada  was  not  included  in  this  study, 

similar  results  were  reported  from  the  Canadian  Community  Health 

Survey- Mental  Health,  which  found  the  lifetime  prevalence  of  BDI 
was 0.87% and that of BDII was 0.67%.7

as 30% of patients.40

In  addition  to  this  under- diagnosis,  there  are  also  concerns  that 
BD may be over- diagnosed in some circumstances.41 For instance, the 

symptoms of borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder 

medical  or  neurological  conditions,  substance  use,  and  medications 

must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 7).

Validated  self- report  instruments,  such  as  the  Mood  Disorders 

thus,  suicide  risk  is  substantially  higher  in  BD  than  in  the  general 
population  (10.7  per  100 000  per  year).46,47  The  fatality  of  suicide 
attempts  is  also  higher  in  BD  than  in  the  general  population.48,49 

Questionnaire (MDQ), may be used as a screening tool to flag patients 

Worldwide, approximately 43% of patients with BD report suicidal 

for  whom  a  more  detailed  assessment  is  needed.  It  is  important  to 

note, that such tools have poor sensitivity and specificity, especially in 

community or highly comorbid populations, and will thus have an ele-
vated risk of also flagging those with borderline traits.43 As such, tools 

such as the MDQ should be used only as an adjunct for screening clini-

ideation,  21%  a  plan,  and  16%  a  suicide  attempt  within  the  past

rate of 0.366 per 100 person years, compared to 0.217 for women.47

To improve the accuracy of diagnosis, it is important that clinicians 
strictly adhere to diagnostic criteria rather than relying on heuristics.44

The  association  between  various  treatments  and  suicide  risk 

has  been  reviewed  by  the  ISBD  Task  Force  and  others,  which  
suggest  that  lithium54  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  anticonvulsants  may 

contribute to preventing suicide attempts and deaths; although more 

data are needed to determine their relative efficacies. There were lim-
ited data on both antipsychotics and antidepressant agents.47 As the 

most common method of suicide in this population is self- poisoning, 

directly  to  the  primary  care  provider  with  attention  to  continuity  of 
care.58 Additional  psychosocial  treatments  (described  below)  may  also 

be selected to fit the specific needs and preferences of the patient.

A strong therapeutic alliance is central to improve treatment adher-
ence and outcomes.59,60 Providers should encourage individuals to ac-

tively participate in treatment planning, using a shared decision- making 
approach.61,62 Whenever possible, family members or key friends should

2.4 | Chronic disease management

Regular,  ongoing  monitoring  of  mood  symptoms  and  other  mea-

sures related to the patient’s own individual recovery, such as sleep, 
cognition,  functioning,  and  quality  of  life  is  encouraged.18  For  many 

patients,  daily  recording  of  mood  symptoms  such  as  through  a

can be perceived or experienced with interactions with others, includ-

ing health care providers, or internalized (self- stigma). Specific strate-

gies  to  reduce  stigma,  particularly  self- stigma,  by  enhancing  coping 

skills through improvements in self- esteem, empowerment, and help- 
seeking behaviour can improve outcomes in this population.71

2.6 | Psychosocial interventions

While pharmacotherapy is essential and forms the foundation for the 

successful  treatment  of  BD,  adjunctive  psychosocial  interventions 

may also be useful for acute depressive episodes, as well as in main-

tenance  treatment  to  prevent  relapse  and  to  restore  quality  of  life 
to the individual and family.72,73 No evidence exists, and hence there 

are  no  recommendations,  for  specific  psychosocial  interventions  in 

acute mania. Positive evidence has been found for psychoeducation, 

cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family- focused therapy (FFT), in-

terpersonal  and  social- rhythm  therapy  (IPSRT),  and  peer  support  in 

the  maintenance  phase  of  BD  and  these  interventions  are  included 

as recommended adjunctive treatment options. Additional studies are 

needed  before  conclusions  can  be  drawn  regarding  other  strategies 

such as family/caregiver interventions, dialectical behavioural therapy 

(DBT),  mindfulness- based  cognitive  therapy  (MBCT),  cognitive  and 

functional remediation, and online interventions (Table 10).

In general, provision of psychoeducation to all patients and fam-

ily members is recommended for prevention of relapse, particularly at 

illness  onset, with  selection  of  any  additional  psychosocial  therapies 

2.6.1 | Psychoeducation

Psychoeducation  broadly  includes  provision  of  information  about 

the nature of the illness, its treatments, and key coping strategies to 
the patient and family.74 Current psychoeducational models for BD 

teach  skill  development  in  detecting  and  managing  prodromes  of 

depression  and  mania,  ongoing  stress  management,  problem  solv-

ing, how to diminish the effects of stigma and denial of the illness, 

and provide tips on enhancing medication adherence and develop-

ing  healthy  lifestyles  (eg,  minimizing  the  use  of  alcohol,  tobacco, 

drugs,  stimulants  such  as  caffeine;  getting  regular  exercise;  and 

regulating sleep and wake times). A key goal is the creation of per-

sonalized coping strategies to prevent mood relapse.

Psychoeducation  may  be  delivered  individually  or  in  group  set-

tings. Empirical models of psychoeducation involve face- to- face inter-

action with a therapist, but new models are being tested that involve 
online  tools,  smartphone  apps,  and  workbooks.75  Consistent  with 

broader  theories  of  learning,  it  is  believed  that  psychoeducation  is 

enhanced when it features active learning, with attention to monitor-

ing the development of understanding, active skill development, and 

homework between sessions. Peer support and group learning are also

or engaging in treatment or causing them to conceal their illness, reduc-
ing social support, functioning and quality of life.70 Linked to stereotypi-

postulated to add efficacy to psychoeducation. Regardless of the type 

of model and content included, priority should be given to maximize 

cal negative attitudes that mental illness is due to personal weaknesses 

or  decisions,  or  associated  with  violent  or  criminal  behaviour,  stigma 

the  therapeutic  alliance,  convey  empathy,  and  consistently  monitor 
symptoms.76

relapse  in  the  intervention  group.90  Group  CBT  in  euthymic  pa-

tients  with  BD  is  also  a  new  direction  and  has  shown  to  increase 
time in remission.91

In MDD, CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and behavioural 

activation  have  been  explored  in  multiple  RCTs  and  in  general  dis-
play  similar  efficacies.92  Based  on  this  and  the  findings  of  the  study 
by Miklowitz and colleagues in acute bipolar depression,84 CBT is still 

recommended as an adjunctive second- line treatment for acute bipo-

lar  depression  (level  2). The  recommendation  is  also  second-line  for 

maintenance treatment (level 2) for patients with fewer episodes and 

CBT  in  BD  is  supported  by  several  published  manuals  and  typi-

2.6.3 | Family- focused therapy

FFT93 presumes that outcomes in BD may be enhanced with the sup-

port and cooperation of family or significant others, particularly in fam-

ilies characterized by high levels of expressed emotion. FFT focuses on 

the  intensity  and  number  of  sessions,  changes  in  medication  use,  or 

specific attributes of IPSRT. Two small studies failed to demonstrate 
specific benefits of IPSRT compared to control conditions.99,100 Other 

open studies have shown some pre- post benefits in very small sam-
ples.101-103 Again, since many psychosocial treatments for bipolar dis-

remediation, though, may show positive effects on cognition but not 
on functioning.119

Although somewhat like FFT, family/caregiver interventions con-

stitute a distinctly different psychosocial intervention in that the in-

tervention  is  given  to  the  family/caregiver,  not  the  person with  BD, 

and evidence exists that such interventions improve clinical outcomes 
in the patient.75,113 Clinical wisdom and common practice, however,

3.2 | Management of agitation

Agitation is common in mania, and is particularly frequent in patients 
who have mixed features.122 Defined in DSM- 5 as “excessive motor 
activity  associated  with  a  feeling  of  inner  tension”,5  agitation  can 

manifest as pacing or fidgeting in mild cases to uncooperative, threat-

ening, or aggressive behaviours in severe cases. Severe symptoms of 

agitation require prompt attention in order to reduce distress, mitigate 

potentially  dangerous  behaviour,  and  allow  for  an  assessment  and 
evaluation of underlying manic symptoms.123

A key step in treating agitation is preventing it, or at least mitigat-

ing its severity, by rapidly treating the causative manic episode. When 

addressing agitation in patients with BDI, clinicians need to be aware 

apy cannot be safely or reliably administered, then IM formulations 
should  be  considered.124  Because  of  the  strength  of  evidence  for 

efficacy  in  alleviating  agitation  in  this  population,  aripiprazole  IM 
(level  2),125,126  lorazepam  IM  (level  2),125,127  loxapine  inhaled  (Level 
1)128,129  and  olanzapine  IM  (level  2)127,130-133  are  recommended  as 
the first- line option. Sublingual asenapine (level 3),134 haloperidol IM 
(level 3),131,135,136 haloperidol IM + midazolam IM (level 3),131,137 hal-
operidol  IM + promethazine  IM  (level  3),131,137,138  risperidone  ODT 
(level 3),136 and ziprasidone IM (level 3)131,137,139 are recommended 
as  a  second- line  treatment.  Haloperidol  per  os  (PO)  (level  4),140,141 
loxapine  IM  (level  4)  (clinical  opinion),  quetiapine  PO  (level  4),141 
and  risperidone  PO  (level  4)140  are  included  as  third- line  options 

(Table 11).

Studies of olanzapine (level 2 negative) 173 or risperidone (level 3

probably  due  to  enzyme- inducing  effects  of  carbamazepine.  While 

this may be overcome by dosing adjustments, because such interac-

tions are unpredictable and effective doses have not been established, 

we are unable to provide a specific recommendation.

Nutraceuticals  such  as  branched  chain  amino  acids  (level  3),175

substance  abuse  or  those  with  a  history  of  head  trauma.188,191-195 

Because of its teratogenic potential, however, caution should be ex-

ercised  when  prescribing  divalproex  to  women  of  childbearing  age. 

Patients with specific factors such as a history of head trauma, comor-

Depressive  symptoms  co- occur  alongside  mania  in  10%- 30%  of 
cases,200,201  with  studies  suggesting  mixed  features  are  indicative  of

4 | ACUTE MANAGEMENT OF 
BI POLAR DEPRESSION

Psychotic features (mood congruent or incongruent)

4.1 | Presentations of bipolar depression

At least half of manic episodes are characterized by the presence of 
psychosis,206 and theories suggest that it is a nonspecific feature which 
improves alongside underlying manic symptoms.207 While the progno-

sis for patients experiencing mood- congruent psychotic features may 

not differ from those with an absence of psychotic symptoms, limited 

evidence  does  suggest  that  those  with  mood- incongruent  features 
have  a  more  severe  illness  with  poorer  long- term  prognosis.207-212 

There  is  no  evidence  of  superiority  of  any  first- line  monotherapy 

treatment in comparison to other monotherapy options in treating pa-

tients with psychotic features. Similarly, there is no evidence that any 

first- line  combination  therapy  of  lithium  or  divalproex  plus  an  atypi-

cal  antipsychotic  is  more  effective  than  other  first- line  combination 
therapy.174,193,213,214  However,  clinical  experience  suggests  that  the 

combination  of  lithium  or  divalproex  plus  an  atypical  antipsychotic 

is  more  appropriate  for  manic  patients  with  mood- incongruent  psy-

chotic  features  (ie,  other  than  grandiose  delusions).  Similarly,  in  pa-

tients where the diagnostic possibility of schizoaffective disorder with 

manic symptoms is considered, either use of an atypical antipsychotic 

or combination of an atypical antipsychotic with a mood stabilizer is 

more appropriate.

Rapid cycling

Rapid cycling, or a course of illness that includes four or more mood 
episodes  a  year,  affects  up  to  one- third  of  patients  with  BDI.215-218 

Hypothyroidism,  antidepressant  use  and  substance  abuse  are  often 

The  DSM- 5  criteria  for  bipolar  depression  are  unchanged  from 

DSM- IV.  Depression  is  characterized  by  a  minimum  of  2 weeks  of 

depressed mood and/or anhedonia and at least four other symptoms 

that include changes in sleep, appetite/weight, energy, psychomotor 

activity,  concentration,  thought  content  (guilt  and  worthlessness), 

and suicidal intent. For many patients with BD, the depressive polar-

ity is often more pervasive and more debilitating than manic states, 

with estimates that depressed mood accounts for up to two- thirds of 
the time spent unwell, even with treatment.12,223,224 Subsyndromal 

depressive symptoms, which persist despite treatment, are particu-

larly common and a major source of functional impairment in these 
patients.225-229 They should be treated aggressively.

DSM- 5 includes several specifiers that may accompany depressive 

episodes: anxious distress, mixed features, rapid cycling, melancholic 

features,  atypical  features,  mood- congruent  or  mood- incongruent 

psychotic features, peripartum onset, and seasonal pattern (Table 5). 

The utility of several of these specifiers in selecting treatment options 

for depression is discussed later in this section (see “Clinical features 

that help direct treatment choices”).

Principles related to management of suicidal ideation and risk (see 
Section  2  and47)  are  of  utmost  importance  during  depressive  epi-

sodes, as >70% of  suicide deaths and suicide attempts in patients 
with  BD  occur  during  this  phase.230,231  Depressive  episodes  with

Why are lithium and lamotrigine recommended as ﬁrst-line agents for bipolar depression? 
Reconciling conﬂic(cid:21)ng data

Lithium

In the only large double blind placebo controlled trial conducted to date, lithium was not more eﬀec(cid:8)ve than placebo for trea(cid:8)ng acute
bipolar depression(254). So, how does one jus(cid:8)fy recommending lithium as a ﬁrst-line agent?  

The mean serum lithium levels in this study was only 0.61 mEq/L and this may account for lack of eﬃcacy as a previous study demonstrated
that lithium monotherapy was as eﬀec(cid:8)ve as lithium plus paroxe(cid:8)ne in those with serum lithium levels of ≥0.8 mEq/L (247). 

Further, several small crossover trials demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher response rates to lithium than placebo in pa(cid:8)ents with acute
bipolar depression (245). As well, the STEP-BD study suggested that mood stabilizers which include lithium are as eﬀec(cid:8)ve as mood
stabilizers plus an(cid:8)depressants in trea(cid:8)ng acute bipolar depression, although the durable recovery rate was modest, and there was no
sub analysis focusing on lithium versus other an(cid:8)manic drugs (246). Thus, the ﬁndings of these studies jus(cid:8)fy a Level 2 ra(cid:8)ng of eﬃcacy
for lithium. 

Given that lithium also has clearly demonstrated eﬃcacy in preven(cid:8)ng mood episodes and in trea(cid:8)ng acute mania, our hierarchical
ranking thus jus(cid:8)ﬁes lithium as an important ﬁrst-line agent for bipolar depression, and based on overall evalua(cid:8)on of available studies,
it is our opinion that a trough lithium serum level of 0.8-1.2 mEq/L would be needed for clinical eﬀec(cid:8)veness.

Lamotrigine

Lamotrigine monotherapy was not superior to placebo in four double blind placebo controlled trials of acute bipolar depression on the
primary outcome (254). However, a meta-analysis conducted on the response rates from these studies as well as a BDII trial showed
superiority of lamotrigine (248). Moreover, methodological issues with the trials likely led to the eﬀect of lamotrigine being
underes(cid:8)mated-including the rela(cid:8)vely low ﬁnal dose (200 mg in most trials, which is lower that usually used in clinical prac(cid:8)ce) (255)
and short trial dura(cid:8)on (8 weeks in most trials) which, coupled with the slow (cid:8)tra(cid:8)on of lamotrigine, resulted in par(cid:8)cipants being on
the ﬁnal dose for only a short period (around two weeks). Further, lamotrigine was superior to placebo on Montgomery–Åsberg
Depression Ra(cid:8)ng Scale (MADRS) in one of the studies (249), and changes in symptoms on this scale have since been used to demonstrate
the eﬃcacy of other agents for acute bipolar depression. Finally, the addi(cid:8)on of lamotrigine to lithium (253) was superior to adding placebo
to lithium and there was a trend for superiority of addi(cid:8)on of lamotrigine to que(cid:8)apine vs placebo add on (252) in trea(cid:8)ng bipolar
depression. It is likely that these beneﬁcial eﬀects are due to the direct eﬀect of lamotrigine and not due to pharmacokine(cid:8)c interac(cid:8)on
between lamotrigine and concomitant medica(cid:8)ons. Furthermore, trial design issues, especially the fact that the six-week dose (cid:8)tra(cid:8)on
phase took up most of the 8 week trials, is likely to compromise eﬃcacy signals. Lastly, the short and long-term tolerability of lamotrigine
is a major beneﬁt. Taken together, we believe these data jus(cid:8)fy at least a Level 2 ra(cid:8)ng for lamotrigine for acute bipolar depression.

In addi(cid:8)on to this Level 2 ra(cid:8)ng for bipolar depression, lamotrigine also has demonstrated eﬃcacy in maintenance treatment and an
excellent tolerability proﬁle-features which qualify it to be a ﬁrst-line treatment for bipolar depression.

Why are armodaﬁnil and modaﬁnil third-line treatments for bipolar I depression? 

Armodaﬁnil adjunc(cid:17)ve therapy was assessed in three double blind randomized controlled trials.  Of these, one was posi(cid:17)ve (270) but in the
other two studies, it failed to separate from placebo on the primary eﬃcacy measure (286, 287) although in one of the trials several
secondary outcomes were posi(cid:17)ve (288). Furthermore, in a fourth trial, there was also sugges(cid:17)on of eﬃcacy based on some secondary
measures (289). Therefore, although two trials were nega(cid:17)ve on the primary eﬃcacy measure, based on one posi(cid:17)ve trial and some posi(cid:17)ve
secondary outcomes in two trials, this was given a Level 4 ra(cid:17)ng (expert opinion), and recommended as a third-line.

Although modaﬁnil has been shown to be eﬃcacious in the only trial (269), it was also recommended a third-line in light of the three nega(cid:17)ve
trials for armodaﬁnil.

Agents  that  may  be  applied  adjunctively 

include  aripipra-
zole  (level  4),266,267  armodafinil  (level  4)268,269  (Figure 3),  asenap-
ine  (level  4),270  levothyroxine  (level  3),271,272  modafinil  (level  2)268 
(Figure 3),  and  pramipexole  (level  3).273,274  rTMS  targeted  at  the  left 
or  right  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex  (level  3)275  may  also  be  used 

in  addition  to  medication.  Other  classes  of  antidepressants  such  as 

serotonin- norepinephrine	reuptake	inhibitors	[SNRIs]	and	monoamine	

oxidase  inhibitors  [MAOIs]  could  be  used  adjunctively  but  clinicians 

need to ensure adequate anti- manic prophylaxis in such situations, as 

SNRIs and MAOIs have a higher propensity than other antidepressants 
to induce manic switch and cause mood destabilization (level 2).276-278

Ancillary treatments such as adjunctive eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 
(level  2),169,279,280  N- acetylcysteine  (level  3),281  and  light  therapy  (level 
3),282  including  bright  light  delivered  midday  (level  3),283  are  also  rec-

ommended  as  third- line  treatment  options  to  use  adjunctively  to  other 

medications. There  may  be  additional  benefits  to  using  light  therapy  in 

combination  with  total  sleep  deprivation  (level  2),  although  there  is  lit-

tle clinical experience with this technique. While there is evidence from 
several  small  studies  that  intravenous  ketamine  (level  3)284  is  a  highly 

effective and fast- acting antidepressant, due to its invasive nature, short 

duration of effect, and lack of long- term safety data, it has been relegated 

to  a  third- line  treatment, with  recommendations  that  it  be  reserved  for 

patients with severe symptoms or significant suicidal ideation for whom 

other treatments have been unsuccessful. In clinical situations that priori-

tize rapidity of response to treatment, ketamine may be considered earlier 

in the treatment order, although clinicians need to be aware that the data 

for efficacy are limited and the effects do not appear to last longer. Further, 

there are case reports of manic switch, but the clinical trial data have not 
provided any confirmatory evidence.284 Also, clinicians need to be aware 
of potential abuse of ketamine, especially in domiciliary use situations.285

and/or when  a  rapid  response  is  important  for  medical  stabilization. 

Data  support  efficacy  for  brief  pulse  right  unilateral  placement,  al-

though there are insufficient data to guide the decision of unilateral 
or  bilateral  placement  for  bipolar  depression.261  Additional  second- 

line options include cariprazine, with efficacy demonstrated through 
a  large  RCT262  and  a  pooled  analysis  of  a  failed  RCT  and  a  positive 
RCT263 (level 2), although there is less clinical experience supporting 
its use. Olanzapine- fluoxetine combination (level 2)264,265 is effective 

and is also recommended as a second- line option.

4.4.6 | Agents not recommended for the 
treatment of acute bipolar depression

Antidepressants should not be used as monotherapy in patients with 

BDI  depression,  as  available  trials  do  not  support  their  efficacy  and 

there  are  concerns  about  their  safety  in  terms  of  mood  switching 
(level 2 negative).260,289-291

Aripiprazole  monotherapy  failed  to  separate  from  placebo  in  two 
bipolar depression trials.292 Although the pooled analysis reported sep-
aration,293  the  mean  difference  in  Montgomery–Åsberg  Depression 

Similar to the approach for treatment of a manic episode, multiple 

Rating Scale (MADRS) change score was only 1.12 points, which is not 

first-  and second- line agents and combinations should be trialled be-

fore considering initiating third- line agents in step 5.

4.4.5 | Step 5: add on or switch therapy (third- line 
agents)

Third-line

Third- line  options  are  listed  alphabetically  in  Table 15.  In  patients 

who  fail  to  respond  to  multiple  first-   and  second- line  agents,  third- 
line choices include monotherapy with carbamazepine (level 2)242 or 
olanzapine (level 1).242

clinically meaningful and it is thus not recommended (level 1 negative). 
Ziprasidone monotherapy or adjunctive therapy (level 1 negative),242,294 
lamotrigine in combination with folic acid (level 2 negative),251 and mife-
pristone  (adjunctive)  (Leve  2  negative)295  are  also  not  recommended 

due to evidence for lack of antidepressant efficacy (Table 15).

4.4.7 | No specific recommendation/agents that 
require further study

There are insufficient data to make a recommendation regarding the 
use of aspirin (adjunctive) (level 3 negative),296 celecoxib (adjunctive)

(level 3 negative),297 gabapentin (monotherapy) (level 3 negative),298

pioglitazone (adjunctive) (level 3),302,303 riluzole (level 4 negative),304 
and risperidone (adjunctive) (level 3).305 Although adjunctive therapy 

with pregnenolone separated from placebo at week 6, the change in 

depressive symptoms was not significantly different from week 8 to 
week 12 between the two groups (level 2).306

subsyndromal hypomanic or manic features, and this presentation is 

associated with more severe depressive symptoms, as well as a higher 
rate of substance use and cardiovascular disease.317 For many of these 

patients, combination therapy will be necessary to adequately address 
symptoms.318  Pooled  analysis  indicates  that  atypical  antipsychotics 

show a class effect in alleviating mixed features in bipolar depression, 

with olanzapine- fluoxetine combination, asenapine, and lurasidone all 
demonstrating efficacy.319 Lurasidone has further been shown to have 

efficacy in treating both depressive and hypomanic symptoms in MDD 
with mixed features.320 The ISBD Task Force recommends avoiding an-
tidepressants  in  patients  with  mixed  features260  and  the  CANMAT/

depression. However, clinical features of a depressive episode includ-

Anxious distress

Symptoms of anxiety are often experienced during a depressive epi-
sode,  and  are  predictive  of  more  persistent  depressive  symptoms311 
and  increased  suicidal  ideation.312  A  pooled  analysis  of  two  double- 

blind RCTs demonstrated that quetiapine is more effective than pla-

cebo in relieving symptoms of anxiety co- occurring alongside bipolar 
depression,313  and  olanzapine- fluoxetine  combination  has  also  been 
shown  to  be  effective.314  In  a  post  hoc  analysis,  lurasidone  was  ef-

As there is no evidence to support any specific agent to treat acute 

depression during a rapid cycling phase, appropriate pharmacotherapy 

should  be  selected  based  on  effectiveness  in  the  acute  and  mainte-

nance phases. Lithium, divalproex, olanzapine, and quetiapine all ap-
pear to have comparable maintenance efficacies in these patients.219

BIP OLAR DIS ORDER

5.1 | Need for long- term strategies

Almost  all  individuals with  BD  require  maintenance  treatment  to  pre-

vent  subsequent  episodes,  reduce  residual  symptoms,  and  restore 

functioning and quality of life. There is increasing evidence to suggest 

that, for a subgroup of patients, BD may be a neuroprogressive disease 

in which recurrences are associated with reductions in brain grey and 

white  matter volumes, worsening  cognitive  impairment,  a  decrease  in 

inter- episodic recovery and functioning, a higher rate and severity of re-

lapse, and a reduced rate of treatment response to both pharmacother-
apy and psychotherapy.325 It is therefore important that comprehensive 
treatment be initiated even after a first episode.63 Effective maintenance 

treatment, early in the course of illness, has been shown to reverse cog-

nitive impairment and preserve brain plasticity, particularly in those who 
remain  episode  free,326,327  and  may  therefore  lead  to  improved  prog-
nosis and minimization of illness progression.328 There are preliminary 

data suggesting that, after a first episode, lithium might be superior to 
quetiapine in both volumetric and cognitive outcomes.329,330

With treatment, 19%- 25% of patients will experience a recurrence 
every year, compared to 23%- 40% of those on placebo.331 Risk factors 
for  recurrence  include  younger  age  of  onset,332  psychotic  features,212 
rapid cycling,331 more (and more frequent) previous episodes,333 comor-
bid  anxiety,334  and  comorbid  SUDs.335  Persistent  subthreshold  symp-
toms also increase risk for subsequent mood episodes,334,336,337 and the 

exploring the reasoning behind poor adherence are important parts of 
treatment,341 as up to half of patients do not take their medications 
as prescribed.342-344 Unrecognized treatment non- adherence can lead 

physicians to believe that the patient is non- responsive, resulting in 

unnecessary dose increases (especially problematic for drugs with a 

narrow therapeutic index), medication switches, or adjunctive medi-
cations.341  Treatment  withdrawal  may  precipitate  recurrence;  50%- 

90% of patients discontinuing lithium experience a recurrence within 
3- 5 months,345,346 with rapid lithium discontinuation associated with 
greater  recurrence  risk  than  gradual  discontinuation.347  Withdrawal 
of  other  mood  stabilizers  also  predicts  recurrence.348,349  Risks  for 

hospitalization,  suicide,  and  lost  productivity  are  also  increased 
with  non- adherence  or  discontinuation.350-352  A  variety  of  patient , 

disorder ,  and  treatment- related  risk  factors  for  non- adherence  or 
partial adherence are outlined in Table 16.353

Meta- analyses  suggest  that  interventions  aimed  at  engaging  pa-

tients  in  treatment  may  more  than  double  adherence  compared  to 
treatment as usual or other control groups.354 Brief psychoeducational 

interventions focusing specifically on medication adherence can be in-
tegrated into clinical practice.354 Flexible and collaborative engagement 

to address individual risk factors for non- adherence is recommended 
to optimize acceptability of pharmacological therapies.353,355-357

5.3 | Psychosocial interventions for 
maintenance therapy

Although  pharmacotherapy  is  the  foundation  of  maintenance  treatment  in 

BD, it is often insufficient to prevent recurrence. Over the last two decades, 

several controlled trials have examined the efficacy of adjunctive psychosocial 

treatments in reducing recurrence. On average, adjunctive psychosocial treat-

presence of residual symptoms should therefore be an indicator of a need 

ments reduce recurrence rates by about 15%. Therefore, adjunctive psycho-

for further treatment optimization. Availability of psychosocial support 
and lower levels of stress are also protective against recurrence.337,338

social interventions are an important component of management of BD and 

should be offered for all patients.

5.2 | Treatment adherence

Concordance between clinician and patient views of illness and treat-
ment is a crucial determinant of adherence,339 and reinforces the need 
for a collaborative approach to the treatment alliance.340 Asking about 

As described in more detail in Section 2, psychoeducation is the 

only  first- line  psychosocial  intervention  for  the  maintenance  phase 

(level 1), which should be offered to all patients. Additional second- line 

options such as CBT (level 2) and FFT (level 2), and third- line options 

such  as  IPSRT  (level  2)  and  peer  support  (level  2)  should  be  offered 

based on individual strengths and needs.

Why is divalproex recommended as a ﬁrst-line maintenance treatment for bipolar I disorder? 

In the only large double-blind placebo controlled RCT of divalproex monotherapy (373), it was not more eﬀec(cid:143)ve than placebo in
preven(cid:143)ng relapse of mood episodes i.e. (cid:143)me to any mood episode. However, in this trial, lithium which has been shown in many other
studies to be eﬀec(cid:143)ve in relapse preven(cid:143)on, was also found to be no more eﬀec(cid:143)ve than placebo. Thus, these results suggest that this trial
was a failed trial and not a nega(cid:143)ve trial.  

Most modern studies of maintenance therapy use enriched design, meaning that those that responded in acute phase to the medica(cid:143)on
being tested are randomized to con(cid:143)nua(cid:143)on of the same drug or replacement with placebo. This prac(cid:143)ce to a large extent mirrors clinical
prac(cid:143)ce as clinicians are likely to con(cid:143)nue the medica(cid:143)on that worked in the acute phase for maintenance treatment. Interes(cid:143)ngly, in the
divalproex RCT, some but not all pa(cid:143)ents that were randomized into the double-blind phase were divalproex responders. In a post-hoc
analysis of this study, in this enriched subgroup of pa(cid:143)ents that responded to divalproex during the acute phase and randomized to
con(cid:143)nua(cid:143)on of divalproex vs switch to placebo, divalproex was more eﬀec(cid:143)ve in preven(cid:143)ng relapse of mood episodes compared with

Further, divalproex was superior to placebo on a number of other secondary eﬃcacy measures such as lower rates of discon(cid:143)nua(cid:143)on for
any mood episode or a depressive episode. Surprisingly, there was also a trend for superiority of divalproex rela(cid:143)ve to lithium in (cid:143)me to
any mood episode. Other RCTs have shown that divalproex is as eﬀec(cid:143)ve as lithium (221) in preven(cid:143)ng relapse of mood episodes. 

As well, two meta-analysis have concluded that divalproex is eﬀec(cid:143)ve in preven(cid:143)ng relapse of mood episodes (370, 372),  and a popula(cid:143)on

maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder (359).

bid with BD (Section 7).

5.5.7 | Agents not recommended for 
maintenance treatment

Perphenazine is not recommended for maintenance based on evidence 

that patients treated with perphenazine and a mood stabilizer follow-

ing an episode are more likely to have emergent depressive symptoms 

or intolerable side effects, compared to those maintained on the mood 
stabilizer alone (level 2 negative).397 Tricyclic antidepressant mono or 

normalities,  higher  brain  lithium  concentration,  increased  N- acetyl 

aspartate  and  lower  myo- inositol  peaks  on  magnetic  resonance 

spectroscopy,  as well  as  several variants  in  candidate  gene  studies, 
may  predict  response,418  but  these  studies  require  confirmation. 

Response to lithium in particular seems to be quite specific, as shown 

in  a  study  of  neurons  derived  from  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells. 

The neurons from people with BD were hyperexcitable and their ac-

tivity was selectively modified by in vitro lithium in accordance with 
clinical response.419

Responders to lamotrigine have a predominantly depressive polar-
ity as well as comorbid anxiety.420,421 Lamotrigine monotherapy is not 

appropriate for patients with frequent manic episodes, as it has limited 

efficacy in preventing mania.

Third-line

Quetiapine has been shown to be effective in preventing manic, 

depressive  and  mixed  episodes  in  patients  with  index  manic,  de-

pressive  and  mixed  episodes,  and  thus  may  be  particularly  valuable 
in  those  with  mixed  features.422  Asenapine  appears  to  be  effective 

in preventing both mania and depression, although the magnitude of 

prophylactic efficacy is greater for mania relative to depression. In a 

randomized open trial of carbamazepine versus lithium, responders to 

carbamazepine  were  more  likely  to  have  an  atypical  illness,  BDII  or 
schizoaffective disorder.405

Data  to  differentiate  anti- psychotic  medication  responders  from 

non- responders are lacking.

but not all are practical. For instance, it is difficult to evaluate a pre- 

treatment course in patients who started their treatment after one or 

two episodes (practice recommended by most treatment guidelines), 

and  biomarkers  are  intriguing  but  lack  sufficient  replication  and  are 

not readily available.

In patients with a history of a rapid cycling course, as indicated in 

previous  sections,  factors  associated with  rapid  cycling  must  be  ad-

dressed. These include discontinuation of stimulants and antidepres-

sants and treating hypothyroidism if present. With regard to treatment 

options, the evidence suggests that monotherapy with a single mood 

stabilizer is often ineffective and patients may require a combination 

of mood stabilizers to achieve mood stability.

Treatment- refractory bipolar disorder

Treatment  refractoriness  may  be  related  to  non- adherence  to  oral 

medications, failure to optimize evidence- based oral medication ther-

apy/therapies,  comorbidities  complicating  therapeutic  response  or 

true resistance to pharmacotherapy. Clinicians are advised to make a 

comprehensive assessment to determine factors responsible for treat-

ment  refractoriness. Adequate  doses  of  first   and  second- line  agents 

should be employed for an adequate period of time (eg, this is typi-

cally individualized based on the previous course of mood episodes in 

each  patient)  to  assess  prophylactic  response.  Comorbidities  should 

be addressed with pharmacological or psychological strategies as ap-

propriate.  While  genotyping  for  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  such  as 

2D6 and 3A4 which metabolize most psychotropic drugs is not rou-

tinely recommended, clinicians are advised to consider this in patients 

with refractory BD who have not responded to high doses of various 

first , second , and third- line treatments or their combinations in order

Why is lithium recommended as a second-line agent for bipolar II depression? 
Reconciling conﬂic(cid:21)ng data

In a 16-week double blind RCT, lithium was as eﬀec(cid:5)ve as sertraline and lithium + sertraline combina(cid:5)on (427) which qualiﬁes lithium for
Level 2 evidence. Addi(cid:5)onal suppor(cid:5)ng data come from a single-blinded trial which showed that lithium was as eﬀec(cid:5)ve as lamotrigine in
trea(cid:5)ng BDII  depression over 6 weeks (445). However, neither of these studies had a placebo arm. Posi(cid:5)ve placebo-controlled data come
from 4 small placebo-controlled crossover studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, in which lithium was eﬀec(cid:5)ve in a mixed sample of
BDI and BDII depressed pa(cid:5)ents (446-449). Results were reported separately for BDII in 2 of the studies and were iden(cid:5)cal to BDI
(pooled response rate = 65% for both) (446).   

In contrast, in the only modern a placebo-controlled parallel group study, lithium was not superior to placebo in BDII depression (254).
Further, lithium was less eﬀec(cid:5)ve than venlafaxine in a 12-week RCT (450).  

A poten(cid:5)al explana(cid:5)on might have to do with trough serum lithium levels. Lithium levels ranged from 0.8-1.3 mEq/L, and were o˜en at the
high end of that range in the older placebo-controlled RCTs while in the nega(cid:5)ve placebo-controlled RCT, the mean serum lithium level was
lower (<0.61 mEq/L in the combined BDI + BDII sample, not reported separately for BDII). Thus, the op(cid:5)mal serum level for trea(cid:5)ng bipolar
II depression is unclear. However, based on the placebo-controlled BDII trials, as well as placebo-controlled studies in BDI (247), a serum
level of 0.8-1.2 mEq/L appears most likely to be beneﬁcial.   

In addi(cid:5)on to the evidence for eﬃcacy in acute depression, lithium also has eﬃcacy in preven(cid:5)ng mood episodes in BDII (400, 452-454).
Therefore, in balance, we believe the evidence, though mixed, jus(cid:5)ﬁes recommending lithium as a second-line agent for BDII depression.

Should an(cid:22)depressants be used in bipolar II depression?
Addressing the controversy

The ques(cid:24)on of whether, and if so when and how, to use an(cid:24)depressants in BDII remains controversial due to concerns regarding both
safety (par(cid:24)cularly the possibility of hypomanic switch, mixed symptoms, and increased cycling) and eﬃcacy. 

With respect to safety, a meta-analysis that compared rates of an(cid:24)depressant-associated mood eleva(cid:24)ons in BDII, BDI, and MDD
reported that they were signiﬁcantly less frequent in BDII than BDI, and occurred almost exclusively into hypomania rather than mania
(454).  Switch rates were low even during an(cid:24)depressant monotherapy and with an(cid:24)depressants associated with high switch rates in BDI
(tricyclics, venlafaxine). An ISBD task force report on an(cid:24)depressants also concluded that their risk-beneﬁt ra(cid:24)o was more favorable in
BDII (261, 449). 

The issue of eﬃcacy is less clear due to limited evidence. RCTs have shown that sertraline monotherapy was as eﬀec(cid:24)ve as lithium and
lithium+ sertraline combina(cid:24)on, and that venlafaxine monotherapy was more eﬀec(cid:24)ve than lithium, suﬃcient for level 2 evidence for
these agents. In a RCT of BDI and BDII pa(cid:24)ents, bupropion was shown to be as eﬀec(cid:24)ve as sertraline and venlafaxine (277). Open-label
data also suggest eﬃcacy for ﬂuoxe(cid:24)ne, and there are maintenance data for venlafaxine and ﬂuoxe(cid:24)ne in preven(cid:24)ng relapses. These
posi(cid:24)ve ﬁndings should be balanced against the fact that paroxe(cid:24)ne and bupropion were not be“er than placebo for acute depression in
pa(cid:24)ents taking concomitant mood stabilizing medica(cid:24)ons. Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that 1) there are no placebo-controlled
acute-phase trials of an(cid:24)depressant monotherapy in BDII, 2) many an(cid:24)depressants have not been studied at all (and we do not believe it is
warranted to extend posi(cid:24)ve ﬁndings from sertraline/venlafaxine -or for that ma“er nega(cid:24)ve ﬁndings from paroxe(cid:24)ne/bupropion -to
“an(cid:24)depressants” generally), 3) the exis(cid:24)ng trials enrolled people with pure (non-mixed) depression, and their eﬃcacy/safety in the
broader spectrum of BDII pa(cid:24)ents is unclear, and 4) many of the exis(cid:24)ng trials have signiﬁcant weaknesses, including one or more of:
low dosing of the an(cid:24)depressant; sub-therapeu(cid:24)c dosing of comparator medica(cid:24)ons; and lack of replica(cid:24)on. 

All of this makes it par(cid:24)cularly diﬃcult to make evidence based recommenda(cid:24)ons regarding an(cid:24)depressants in BDII. We have restricted
our recommenda(cid:24)ons to the speciﬁc agents that have been studied, and we recommend bupropion, sertraline,and venlafaxine
monotherapy as second-line treatments; and ﬂuoxe(cid:24)ne as third-line. We further recommend that any an(cid:24)depressant, especially in
monotherapy, be reserved for pa(cid:24)ents with pure depression and avoided in those with mixed symptoms or a history of an(cid:24)depressant-
induced hypomania (261). Whether an(cid:24)depressants should also be avoided in pa(cid:24)ents with rapid cycling is unclear, since some studies
report poorer outcomes in rapid-cycling pa(cid:24)ents (455) while others do not (450, 456-458). Pa(cid:24)ents prescribed an(cid:24)depressants must be
educated regarding early-warning signs of hypomania and carefully monitored for them. Finally, there is a pressing need for further studies
of other an(cid:24)depressants in BDII, in both monotherapy and combina(cid:24)on therapy.

Why is lamotrigine a second-line recommenda(cid:13)on for bipolar II depression?
Reconciling conﬂic(cid:21)ng data

Lamotrigine monotherapy was studied in two trials in BDII depression: one in which 221 BDII pa(cid:5)ents received 200 mg/day or placebo for
8 weeks, and a second in which 206 BDI or BDII pa(cid:5)ents (N = 84 with BDII) received 100–400 mg/day for 10 weeks (254). Both produced
nega(cid:5)ve results. A meta-analysis conﬁrmed that lamotrigine was not superior to placebo in BDII depression, although it did separate from
placebo in BDI (248). Several methodological shortcomings likely resulted in the studies underes(cid:5)ma(cid:5)ng the drug’s eﬀect, including 1) a
slow (cid:5)tra(cid:5)on which resulted in subjects being on the target dose for a short (cid:5)me, 2) a target dose lower than that oŽen used in clinical
prac(cid:5)ce and in successful maintenance studies (255, 324), and 3) higher placebo response rates. In contrast, a single-blind RCT with a
rela(cid:5)vely high dose (ﬁnal peak dose=300mg) and a longer dura(cid:5)on (16 weeks) found that lamotrigine monotherapy was as eﬀec(cid:5)ve as
adequately-dosed lithium (mean ﬁnal serum level=1.1 mEq/L) in N=98 BDII pa(cid:5)ents (445). Two large RCTs in BDI+BDII and a 12-week
open-label trial in pa(cid:5)ents with BDI+BDII+BDNOS also reported that adjunc(cid:5)ve lamotrigine was eﬀec(cid:5)ve, but did not report results
separately for BDII (252, 253). Finally, lamotrigine has robust eﬃcacy in preven(cid:5)ng depressive relapse in BDI and BDII (324, 459). 
Taking all of these factors into considera(cid:5)on we recommend lamotrigine as a second-line treatment, par(cid:5)cularly for pa(cid:5)ents who can
tolerate a slow (cid:5)tra(cid:5)on and delayed eﬀect.

6.2.1 | General considerations for interpreting 
recommendations

The  treatment  of  BDII  has  been  understudied  relative  to  BDI.  This 

is  probably  due  to  the  long- standing  but  discredited  impression  of 

BDII as a less severe form of BD. The number of RCTs in BDII is sub-

stantially smaller than that in BDI, and those studies that do exist are 

frequently under- powered. It also remains common for trials to enrol 

patients with both BDII and BDI without reporting results separately, 

making it difficult to determine if there are clinically meaningful differ-

ences in treatment response between the two illnesses. This is impor-

tant because, while clinical experience and the results of many studies 

suggest that response to mood stabilizers and antipsychotics is similar 

in BDII and BDI, there are enough exceptions to suggest this should 
not be taken for granted.248,405,431 This is also the case for antidepres-

or quetiapine added to treatment as usual. They were equally effec-

for BDII, but BDII patients responded better to both treatments than 

did BDI patients.

Lithium. In three placebo- controlled RCTs conducted in the 1970s 

and 1980s (duration = 11- 25 months), lithium decreased the frequency 
and/or severity of hypomanic and depressive episodes.399,450,452 Serum 

lithium  levels  were  0.8- 1.2 mEq/L.  A  number  of  active  comparator 

studies also support lithium. As noted above, lithium was as effective 
as quetiapine in preventing relapse in a 6- month single- blind trial.453 A

+  BDII  found  the  two  drugs  to  be  equally  effective  in  preventing  re-
lapses.496 The authors noted that findings were similar for BDII and BDI, 

but results were otherwise not reported separately for BDII. In a 2.5- 

year study in BDII + BD NOS, lithium and carbamazepine were equally 

effective on most outcomes, although a numerical advantage favoured 
carbamazepine  for  reducing  clinical  plus  subclinical  recurrence.405  In 

contrast,  head- to- head  comparisons  with  antidepressants  (reviewed 

below) found that lithium was not as effective in preventing depressive 
relapse as fluoxetine or venlafaxine.469,497 This may be explained by the 

mean lithium levels, which were 0.7 mEq/L in both studies, while the 

fluoxetine trial was also enriched for fluoxetine responders.

Long- term naturalistic data also provide strong support for lithium.

Monotherapy  with  venlafaxine  (level  2)  or  fluoxetine  (level  3)  are

Venlafaxine. In a small 6- month RCT in patients with BDII who re-

sponded acutely to venlafaxine or lithium without hypomanic switch, 

there was a trend for lower rates of relapse into depression for patients 

treated with venlafaxine. Further, the rate of sustained response was 

significantly greater in those who continued venlafaxine compared to 
those who continued lithium.497 No hypomanic episodes occurred in 

either group.

Fluoxetine. In a 50- week RCT, the mean time to relapse into depres-

For  many  women,  stress  and  hormonal  changes  associated  with

Reconciling the paucity of RCT data with abundant clinical experience in determining level of
recommenda(cid:6)on for treatment of pediatric bipolar depression 

Aside from lurasidone, which has posi(cid:12)ve RCT data (597) alongside good tolerability, op(cid:12)ons include either treatments with substan(cid:12)al
tolerability concerns (olanzapine-ﬂuoxe(cid:12)ne combina(cid:12)on) or treatments with no RCT data (eg. lithium, lamotrigine) or without posi(cid:12)ve
RCT data (eg.que(cid:12)apine). In this instance, clinical experience combined with tolerability considera(cid:12)ons and adult data informed the
ranking of recommenda(cid:12)ons.   Lithium and lamotrigine have not been tested in RCTs in pediatric bipolar depression. However, there is
abundant clinical experience with these agents in trea(cid:12)ng depression in the pediatric group alongside posi(cid:12)ve open trials. Further, these
agents are recommended for trea(cid:12)ng acute bipolar in adult popula(cid:12)ons, and they have good tolerability. Thus, despite lack of RCT data,
they are recommended as second-line agents for trea(cid:12)ng acute bipolar depression in pediatric popula(cid:12)on. 

In terms of que(cid:12)apine, of the two nega(cid:12)ve RCTs (601, 602), one had a dose range of 300-600 mg/day but was limited to 32 par(cid:12)cipants
and had a 67% placebo response rate. The other study was dosed at only 150-300 mg/day and had a 55% placebo response rate. One can
argue that the que(cid:12)apine studies have been failed, rather than truly nega(cid:12)ve, studies. Therefore, given its demonstrated eﬃcacy in adult
bipolar depression and methodological problems in studies of pediatric bipolar depression and based on clinical experience, it is
recommended as a third-line op(cid:12)on. 

Ul(cid:12)mately, treatment decisions in general, but par(cid:12)cularly in the context of empirical uncertainty, should be informed by a thorough
discussion of compara(cid:12)ve risks and beneﬁts of compe(cid:12)ng op(cid:12)ons. Risk-beneﬁt ra(cid:12)os may diﬀer across pa(cid:12)ents depending on factors
such as BD subtype, comorbid anxiety, and sleep disturbance.

symptoms  often  do  not  improve  following  mood  stabilization,  and 

behavioural  dysregulation,  subthreshold  manic  symptoms,  cyclothy-

gested that the most potent predictors were family history, an earlier 
age of onset and the presence of psychotic symptoms.574 There is an 
increased prevalence of BD among offspring of parents with BD.575-
577 Although there is no uniform strategy for managing depression (or 

ADHD, anxiety, etc.) in the child of a parent with BD, increased caution 

is  warranted  when  prescribing  antidepressant  or  stimulant  medica-
tions as these have the potential to precipitate mania/hypomania.578 

Patients and their parents should be informed of the potential switch

vated  risk  for  accelerated  atherosclerosis  and  early  cardiovascular 

disease in this population, cardiovascular risk factors should also be 

assessed regularly and intervention implemented. Lifestyle manage-

ment including attention to diet, substance use, smoking and physi-

cal  activity  should  be  implemented  alongside  any  psychological  or 
pharmacological  interventions.582  Relatedly,  children  and  adoles-

cents are more susceptible than adults to the metabolic side effects 

of  psychiatric  medications,  particularly  the  atypical  antipsychotics 
that  are  considered  first- line  treatments.583  Taken  together,  these

and proportionally this population is one of the highest users of psy-

suggest that medications efficacious in adults overall will also be ef-

fective in older adults, although additional considerations regarding 

medication tolerability and age- related changes in pharmacokinetics 

and pharmacodynamics must be taken into account. Because of the

high  number  of  medical  comorbidities  as  well  as  physical  changes 

inent  in  older  adults,  depressive  and  cognitive  symptoms  are  more

often  observed,  and  hyperactivity,  aggression,  insomnia,  impulsiv-

patients to potential pharmacokinetic issues, drug- drug interactions, 

ity,  and  self- neglect  may  pose  a  significant  risk  to  the  patient  and 
others.629,630  Psychiatric  comorbidity  is  also  generally  lower  than  in 

younger patients, with anxiety and substance use being the most com-
mon.631 Compared to younger patients, older adults are less likely to 

utilize inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room services and more 
likely to use case- management and conservator services.632

Cognitive dysfunction is a significant concern for this population, 

with >30% showing significant deficits across all mood states, includ-
ing euthymia.633 This cognitive dysfunction is relatively stable, related 

to the number of mood episodes earlier in life, and does not appear 
to exceed normal aging in 2- 5- year follow- up.634-636 Lithium use has 
been associated with lower rates of cognitive disorders in BD,637 and 

higher lithium levels in drinking water may be associated with lower 
dementia  risks,638,639  although  prospective  trials  are  required  to  de-

side effects, and the need for ongoing monitoring (see Section 8).

Amongst  other  effects,  lithium  has  been  associated with  adverse 
neurological  effects645  and  renal  disease.646  Divalproex  has  been  as-
sociated with motor side effects645 and metabolic effects (weight gain 
and  diabetes  mellitus).647  Carbamazepine  induces  cytochrome  P450 

enzymes  and  can  reduce  the  levels  of  divalproex  and  other  medica-
tions.648 Regarding antipsychotics, which are now very commonly used 

for BD in older adults, dose reduction may be beneficial in some aging 

patients to lower the risk of motor, sedation, metabolic syndrome, and 
cognitive  effects.649  There  is  an  association  between  mortality  and 
antipsychotics in patients with dementia650 but it is unclear how this 

should be managed for patients with BD. Recently there have also been 
data linking antipsychotics with acute kidney injury.651

In particular, when lithium is used in this population, lithium level 

finitively assess this. Standardized instruments, such as the Montreal 

and renal monitoring should occur at least every 3- 6 months, as well 

Cognitive Assessment  (MoCA),  should  be  used  to  quantify  cognitive 

as 5- 7 days following a lithium dose adjustment or adjustment of non- 

dysfunction.  Because  of  the  link  between  cognition  and  functioning 
in BD,634,640 the impact of medications (particularly those with a high 

anticholinergic burden) on cognition should be considered when mak-

steroidal  anti- inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  antiontensin  II  receptor

Primary treatments for anxiety disorders: Should they be used to treat co-morbid anxiety in
bipolar disorder?

There are no large RCTs that examined the eﬃcacy of SSRIs, SNRIs, pregabalin or lorazepam in trea(cid:2)ng anxiety symptoms in BD pa(cid:2)ents
with co-morbid GAD. However, several RCTs assessed the eﬃcacy of these agents in pa(cid:2)ents with primary GAD and have been found to
be eﬀec(cid:2)ve (723). So,should clinicians employ these treatments in trea(cid:2)ng co-morbid anxiety symptoms in GAD? As with any clinical
decision, CANMAT recommends assessing risk-beneﬁt ra(cid:2)o. 

Pregabalin is eﬀec(cid:2)ve and is not associated with risk of mood destabiliza(cid:2)on and is well tolerated. Hence, pregabalin would be  considered
an appropriate op(cid:2)on although this has not been tested in BD popula(cid:2)on with co-morbid anxiety. Lorazepam also does not cause mood
instability but given the poten(cid:2)al dependence with longer-term use, only short-term use of lorazepam may be appropriate.  In the case of
an(cid:2)depressants, especially with SNRIs, the risk of manic/hypomanic switch is likely higher. Therefore, if an(cid:2)depressants are being
considered for trea(cid:2)ng anxiety symptoms, it is recommended to primarily use SSRIs. Further, if SSRIs are used, it is important to ensure
adequate mood stabiliza(cid:2)on with one or more prophylac(cid:2)c an(cid:2)manic agents (eg. lithium or divalproex or an atypical an(cid:2)psycho(cid:2)c).

Lorazepam and clonazepam do not provoke mood instability, they are rapidly eﬀec(cid:2)ve for the acute management of anxiety and they may
address early warning signs of mania by inducing sleep. While inappropriate prescribing may result in misuse and dependence and cau(cid:2)on
must be exercised when prescribing benzodiazepines to elderly pa(cid:2)ents in par(cid:2)cular, the use of benzodiazepines may be appropriate for
trea(cid:2)ng anxiety associated with bipolar disorder. Short-term use is desirable but some pa(cid:2)ents are unable to tolerate other anxiety
treatments and experience signiﬁcant symptoma(cid:2)c relief and func(cid:2)onal improvement due to the judicious use of benzodiazepines.

Anxiety disorders

Patients with BD frequently experience symptoms of anxiety and co-

morbid anxiety disorders (GAD, panic disorder, post- traumatic stress 

disorder  and  others).  Clinical  samples  indicate  that  24%- 56%  of  pa-

tients with BD meet criteria for one or more anxiety disorders, with 
the highest rates in women.720 Comorbid anxiety symptoms and anxi-

ety disorders are associated with a higher number of mood episodes 

and depressive symptoms, including suicidality and sleep disturbance, 

and  greater  impairment  of  psychosocial  functioning  and  quality  of 
life.721  The  presence  of  a  comorbid  anxiety  disorder  is  also  associ-
ated  with  high  rates  of  use  of  antidepressants,722  which  should  be 

Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder

Quetiapine was superior to placebo and divalproex in improving anxi-

that  quetiapine  monotherapy  significantly  reduces  symptoms  of 
GAD and panic disorder in patients with bipolar depression.290,313,725 

Negative trials include risperidone versus placebo in patients with BD 
and comorbid GAD and/or panic disorder726 and ziprasidone versus 
placebo in a similar trial.727

Treatment recommendations

Treatment  strategies  that  target  metabolic  disorders  should  include 

non- pharmacological lifestyle interventions. Replacing “high metabolic 

risk”  psychiatric  medications  with  medications  that  have  a  more  fa-

vourable profile is highly recommended if the therapeutic advantage 

of the high- risk agent over the alternative is minimal and metabolic/

weight issues persist. Bariatric surgery should be considered following 

unsuccessful attempts at the aforementioned strategies if the individ-

Table 24, as well as in treatment hierarchy tables in Sections 2- 4. As

sive renal failure is low, plasma creatinine concentrations and ide-

non- adherence,  these  potential  concerns  should  be  discussed  with 

patients  receiving  or  considering  treatment  with  various  agents  to 

help inform decision making.

8.3.1 | Weight gain

As described in Section 6, despite normal weight at illness onset,806 

it  is  common  for  patients  with  BD  to  become  overweight  or  obese, 

and  several  medications  used  to  treat  the  illness  may  also  exacer-

bate  this  effect.  The  likelihood  of  medications  to  cause  weight  gain 

ally estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for these patients 
should  be  measured  at  least  every  3- 6 months.652  Since  37%  of 
patients aged >70 years have an eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2,823 

a strict eGFR cut- off for lithium discontinuation is difficult. The UK 

National Institute for Healthcare and Excellence (NICE) guidelines 

for chronic kidney disease (CKD) recommend nephrologist consul-
tation  if  there  is  rapidly  declining  eGFR  (>5 mL/min  per  1.73 m2 
in 1 year, or >10 mL/min per 1.73 m2 within 5 years), if the eGFR 

falls  below  45  in  two  consecutive  readings,  or  if  the  clinician  is 
concerned.646,824

should  be  carefully  considered,  as  this  is  one  of  the  most  frequent

of 60% of cases.807 The medications most commonly associated with 

tion is also a complication, which, though reversible, can lead to reduc-
tions in glomerular filtration rate.825,826 Drugs that alter renal function 

weight gain are olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, gabap-

entin,  divalproex  and  lithium;  with  carbamazepine,  lamotrigine,  and 

ziprasidone  being  the  safer  or  options  associated  with  less  weight 
gain.808 Recent reviews further suggest that asenapine and aripipra-
zole (longer term use) 809 also may lead to weight gain, but the impact 
of lurasidone on weight is minimal.810 All patients should be regularly 

monitored for weight changes.

8.3.2 | Gastrointestinal symptoms

and general medical conditions characterized by decreased circulating 
volume all contribute to increased risk.827

8.3.4 | Haematological effects

Carbamazepine  may  be  a  risk  factor  for  leucopenia,828-830  although 
this  finding  is  not  robust.831  This  side  effect  is  generally  reversible 

with  dose  reduction  or  discontinuation.  There  is  also  some  concern 

about rapidly developing bone marrow suppression resulting from hy-
persensitivity, particularly in older patients.831,832

Both  lithium  and  divalproex  are  commonly  associated  with  nausea, 

Clozapine  carries  the  greatest  risk  for  drug- induced  changes  in 

vomiting, and diarrhoea, with 35%- 45% of patient experiencing these 
side effects.372,811 For lithium, this is particularly pronounced during 
treatment  initiation,  or  rapid  dose  increases.812  Gradual  dose  titra-

gramme which requires regular monitoring of haematological param-

eters: weekly at first and then every 2- 4 weeks later in the course of 
treatment.833

8.3.3 | Renal toxicity

Lithium  has  a  well- recognized  potential  for  renal  toxicity,  includ-

ing  nephrogenic  diabetes  insipidus  (NDI),  chronic  tubulointersti-

tial  nephropathy,  and  acute  tubular  necrosis,  with  NDI  reported 
in  20%- 40%  of  patients.814-816  Upwards  of  70%  of  patients  on 

chronic  lithium  treatment  will  experience  polyuria,  which  can 

cause  impairment  in  work  and  daily  functioning.  This  side  effect 
is commonly underreported, unless it is directly inquired about.817 

8.3.5 | Cardiovascular effects

Lithium can increase the risk of abnormal QT prolongation or T- wave 
abnormalities,834  an  impact  more  pronounced  with  age,  as  almost 

60%  of  older  patients  on  lithium  maintenance  therapy  have  ECG 
abnormalities.835 Several antipsychotics, including risperidone, olan-

zapine, ziprasidone and asenapine, are also associated with arrhyth-

mias,  QTc  prolongation,  and  other  cardiovascular  adverse  events. 

Long- term  administration  (ie,  10- 20+ years)  is  further  associated 

Clozapine  may  increase  the  risk  of  several  rare  but  serious  events 

with  decreased  glomerular  filtration  rate  and  chronic  kidney  dis-
ease.818  While  long- term  lithium  administration  is  probably  an 

such as dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Of the 

antipsychotics, lurasidone and aripiprazole are considered safe from 

important  risk  factor  for  developing  chronic  kidney  disease,  fac-

tors that may increase susceptibility include higher plasma lithium 

a cardiac perspective, although aripiprazole may increase the risk for 
hypotension.810

YATHAM eT Al.    |  145

8.3.6 | Endocrine effects

There  is  also  a  strong  link  between  lithium  maintenance  treatment 

and  hypothyroidism,  which  is  also  associated  with  increased  risk  of 
affective  episodes,  rapid  cycling,  and  more  severe  depression.836,837 

Routine screening of thyroid function is therefore recommended for 

all  patients  on  lithium  treatment.  Since  lithium  can  also  cause  hy-

however;  quetiapine,  clozapine,  and  olanzapine  will  generally  have 

higher rates of sedation compared to ziprasidone, risperidone, and ari-
piprazole.810 Lamotrigine and lithium have both been found to be less 
likely to cause sedation than divalproex.854,855

New onset oligomenorrhoea or hyperandronism is more common in 
divalproex users.839 While there are reports of an increased incidence 

of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in divalproex treatment, a recent 
meta- analysis did not support this.840 In those who develop PCOS on 

divalproex,  there  is  evidence  from  a  small  sample  that  discontinuing 
divalproex results in remission of some of the aspects of PCOS.841

tion and discontinuation of divalproex is critical to prevent morbidity 
and mortality858 Sustained release formulations and dose reductions 
may limit symptoms.802,859,860 While conventional antipsychotics such 

as haloperidol are often associated with EPS (including pseudoparkin-
sonism, akathisia, acute dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia),861 this risk is 
either absent or low with atypical antipsychotic agents.862,863 Among 

Hyperprolactinaemia  is  common  with  some  antipsychotics,  and 

the atypical agents, risperidone, aripiprazole, cariprazine, ziprasidone 

can have short- term and long- term adverse effects. Risperidone, ami-

sulpride  and  paliperidone  are  more  likely  than  other  compounds  to 
cause it.842 Hyperprolactinaemia can induce amenorrhoea, sexual dys-

function, and galactorrhoea, amongst other effects. In the long term, 
it  can  cause  gynaecomastia  and  osteoporosis.843 When  such  effects 

are seen, it may advisable to reduce the dose or switch to a different 
medication.844

8.3.7 | Cognition

and  lurasidone  are  more  likely  to  cause  EPS,  particularly  at  higher 
doses.810  In  older  patients,  impaired  swallowing  function  and  dys-

phagia have also been linked to atypical agents, particularly at higher 
doses.864,865

Although  rare,  neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  (NMS)  is  a  po-

tentially life- threatening adverse event associated with antipsychotic 

agents.  The  risk  with  atypical  agents  was  considered  negligible  ini-

tially; however, while the risk is very low, several atypical agents have 
nevertheless  been  associated  with  NMS.866  While  generally  unpre-

dictable,  the  risk  is  greatest  during  the  initial  phase  of  treatment  or 

While  many  patients  experience  cognitive  impairment,  these  deficits 

change of dosage, with intravenous or intramuscular administration, 

may be attributable to the disease itself, with more pronounced effects 
in those with more severe or chronic illness.845 While a small study has

restrained  or  dehydrated,  in  high  ambient  temperatures,  in  older 

led to suggestions that medicated patients who are euthymic do per-
form similarly to those not receiving treatment,846 other naturalistic tri-

als point towards the potential negative impact of several medications, 
with the effects of antipsychotics being the most significant.845 Lithium 

can  also  lead  to  impairment  in  processing  speed  and  memory,  which 
patients  may  find  distressing,847  although  recent  randomized  con-
trolled data suggest lithium is superior to quetiapine in this regard.329 

Indeed, the effects of lithium on neurocognition are complex and fur-
ther research is needed to fully elucidate its neurocognitive impact.848 

Anticonvulsants,  except  for  lamotrigine,  are  also  linked  to  subjective 
cognitive  impairment.847  Given  the  importance  of  cognition  on  a  pa-

tient’s function and quality of life, further studies are needed in this area.

8.3.8 | Sedation

Sedation is a concern for many, and is reported by over half of patients 
as a reason for treatment non- adherence.807 Divalproex and atypical 

antipsychotics are most likely to lead to these effects, with 30%- 50% 

of  patients  on  atypical  antipsychotics  experiencing  sedation,  com-
pared to 8%- 13% with placebo164,214,849-851 and 21%- 29% of patients 
on  divalproex.852,853  This  is  not  a  concern  with  all  antipsychotics, 

patients  and  in  patients  with  medical  or  psychiatric  comorbidities. 

Patients with a previous history of NMS and/or a personal or family 
history of catatonia are also at higher risk.867 Antipsychotics may also 

impact  thermoregulation,  with  case  studies  indicating  the  potential 
for both heat- related illnesses868 and hypothermia869; thus, patients 

should be made aware and monitored for these risks during periods 

of extreme temperatures.

8.3.10 | Dermatological reactions

Approximately 10% of patients being treated with lamotrigine will expe-

rience a non- serious rash, with 0.3%- 1% developing a serious rash such 
as toxic epidermal necrolysis and SJS,870 although for those initiated on 

a dose of 25 mg with a gradual titration increasing the dose by 25 mg 

biweekly, the risk of developing serious rash may be as low as 0.02% 
or 1 in 5000.871 In some cases, an even lower rate of titration may be 

used  (ie  12.5 mg/day  and  then  gradually  increase  as  per  instructions. 

Carbamazepine  is  also  associated  with  increased  risk  of  rash  and  SJS, 
especially in the first 8 weeks of therapy,872 although the baseline risk 

is extremely low. Similarly, while these can also occur with divalproex, 

the risk is extremely low. Nevertheless, it is important that patients be
