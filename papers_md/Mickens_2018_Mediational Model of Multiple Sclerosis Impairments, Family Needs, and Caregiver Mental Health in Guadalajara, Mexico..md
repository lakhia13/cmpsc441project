Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), especially those living in Latin America, often require assistance from family caregivers
throughout the duration of the disease. Previous research suggests that family caregivers may experience positive and negative
outcomes from providing care to individuals with MS, but few studies have examined the unmet needs of individuals providing
care to family members with MS and how these unmet needs may mediate the relationship between MS symptoms and
caregiver mental health. The current study examined the relationships among MS impairments (functional, neurological,
cognitive, behavioral, and emotional), unmet family needs (household, informational, ﬁnancial, social support, and health), and
caregiver mental health (satisfaction with life, anxiety, burden, and depression) in a sample of 81 MS caregivers from
Guadalajara, Mexico. A structural equation model demonstrated the mediational eﬀect of unmet family needs on the
relationship between MS impairments and caregiver mental health. These ﬁndings suggest that intervention research on MS
caregivers in Latin America may consider focusing on caregiver mental health problems by addressing unmet family needs and
teaching caregivers ways to manage the impairments of the individual with MS.

1. Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological
illness
that eventually results in physical disability and cognitive
impairments which limit an individual’s ability to function
independently [1]. Approximately 2.5 million people have
been diagnosed with MS worldwide [2], and research dem-
onstrates that worldwide prevalence rates are increasing
[3]. As with other countries, researchers have observed
that MS prevalence rates may be higher than previously
reported in Latin American countries such as Mexico,
where current prevalence rates vary by region and range
from 7 to 30 cases per 100,000 people [4, 5].

In Latin America, where rates of MS are increasing but
disparities still exist in its diagnosis and treatment [6, 7],
sociocultural values such as allocentrism, familism, and ﬁl-
ial obligation [8, 9] increase the likelihood that family
members will serve as informal caregivers to individuals
with MS. When compared to other racial/ethnic groups,
Latino caregivers often report limited use of formal sup-
port services [10, 11], larger informal social networks [8],
increased role strain [12], lower rates of institutionaliza-
tion [10], and higher rates of depression [13]. However,
very few studies have examined MS caregiving in Latin
America [14, 15], and associations in this region among
MS impairments, needs of family members providing care,

and caregiver mental health remain largely unknown.
Because of this major gap in the research literature, there
is a great need for research addressing the process of MS
caregiving in Latin America, as well as the impact of MS
impairments on family needs and caregiver mental health
in this region.

International research has established that compared to
noncaregivers, MS caregivers report higher levels of depres-
sion [16], anxiety [17], and decreased social support [18].
Patient factors such as level of disability [19–21], cognitive
impairments [22–25], behavioral changes [22, 23], inconti-
nence, and fatigue [26] contribute to increased caregiver
depression, strain, and burden. Although many of the ﬁnd-
ings on MS caregiver functioning emphasize the negative
aspects of caregiving, the literature also demonstrates that
MS caregivers report salubrious outcomes such as personal
growth, role fulﬁllment, positive emotions, and satisfaction
as a result of caregiving [11, 27].

MS caregiving can be understood using Pearlin et al.’s
[28] conceptual model of caregiver stress. This model
identiﬁes three domains of caregiving stress: (a) background
and context of the caregiving situation (i.e., caregiver age,
gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, relationship with
the patient, and family and social network composition),
(b) primary stressors (i.e., cognitive functioning of patient,
behavioral changes, problematic behaviors of the patient,
activities of daily living (ADLs), and instrumental ADLs),
and (c) secondary stressors (i.e., unmet needs for informa-
tion, reduced access to employment or need for ﬁnancial
assistance, limited social support, family conﬂict, conﬂict
with occupational and social role fulﬁllment, economic
strain, changes in self-concept, loss of self, role captivity,
mastery, competence, and gain). The model identiﬁes physi-
cal and emotional outcomes associated with stressors and
alleviated by mediators of stress (i.e., coping strategies and
social support). Moreover, Pearlin et al.
indicate that
stressors, mediators, and outcomes often interact and indi-
vidually or collectively inﬂuence caregiver mental health in
a direct, indirect, or cyclical pattern [28]. Because unmet
family needs can comprise both background (i.e., aﬀecting
family prior to involvement in caregiving roles) variables
and stressors associated with the caregiving experience
(i.e., lack of knowledge about disease process or need for
speciﬁc care information), clinicians and providers have
increased interest in studying the role of unmet needs on
caregiver psychological functioning.

Findings from studies of MS caregivers demonstrate that
primary stressors (i.e., patient functioning) have been associ-
ated with depression and burden. Although these studies
have examined aspects such as the patient’s cognitive func-
tioning, psychological functioning, physical disability, and
ADL impairments, few have examined unmet family needs
in the context of these patient-related stressors. Within the
framework of Pearlin et al.’s model [28], family needs (i.e.,
informational needs, ﬁnancial needs,
household needs,
health needs, and social support) are an extension of the
background/context and secondary stressor domains. Find-
ings from a previous study demonstrate that unmet family
needs are also are a central determinant of caregiver

adjustment, as they have been associated with increased
burden and depression among MS caregivers [14].

Given the often signiﬁcant impairments documented in
individuals with MS, the unknown levels of unmet family
needs, and the generally poor mental health that MS care-
givers report, many questions remain regarding the speciﬁc
connections among these sets of variables, especially in Latin
America. As such, the objective of the present study is to
examine unmet family needs as a mediator of the established
relationship between the care recipients’ MS impairments
(primary stressor) and caregivers’ mental health (outcome).
Based on prior research which suggests strong associations
between patients’ MS symptoms and their caregivers’ psy-
chosocial distress [16, 17, 19, 22, 24], it is hypothesized that
the relationship between MS impairments and caregiver
mental health will be signiﬁcantly mediated by unmet family
needs. At present, no studies in the MS caregiver literature
have examined this possible eﬀect, but based on Pearlin
et al.’s [28] model, primary stressors (e.g., patient func-
tioning) should be associated with reduced caregiver mental
health outcomes. Secondary stressors such as family needs
should be associated with both primary stressors (MS
impairments) and negative caregiver mental health outcomes
and could possibly account for the connection between these
two sets of constructs.

2. Method

2.1. Participants. Participants (n = 81) were a convenience
sample of self-identiﬁed MS caregivers recruited from The
Mexican Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis and the Depart-
ment of Neurosciences of the University Center for Health
Sciences, University of Guadalajara, Mexico. In order to
participate in the study, caregivers had to (a) be the primary
caregiver of an individual with a diagnosis of MS who was at
least six months past the date of diagnosis, (b) have provided
care to the person with MS for a minimum of six months, and
(c) have had no history of a cognitive, serious psychiatric, or
neurological disorder themselves. Initially, 86 participants
were approached, but after screening, ﬁve declined or did
not meet study criteria. Data were collected from a ﬁnal
sample of 81 caregivers. Demographic information for the
caregiver sample is provided in Table 1 and for the patient
sample in Table 2.

2.2. Measures. Eligible caregivers completed a battery of
questionnaires
in Spanish that assessed the following
domains: demographic information, MS-related impair-
ments as observed by the caregiver, family needs, and mental
health. Measures of depression, anxiety, caregiver burden,
satisfaction with life, and caregiver needs had been previously
translated to Spanish and validated in Spanish-speaking
samples prior to their use in this study. Spanish-speaking
norms were used for scoring and interpreting these mea-
sures where available. The measure of MS impairments
was translated (forward and backward) into Spanish and
then English using methods published by Chapman and
Carter [29] and Guillemin et al. [30] to ensure cross-
cultural equivalence. Both translations were compared by a

of common MS impairments. Assessed impairments are
grouped into ﬁve subscales: cognitive, emotional, behavioral,
neurological, and functional. Caregivers completed this
measure by reporting “yes” for the speciﬁc impairments that
their care recipient experienced and “no” for the impair-
ments that the care recipient did not experience. Item scores
are summed (yes = 1, no = 0) so that subscale scores with
higher values indicate domains with a larger number of
impairments. Although it is possible to calculate a total score,
only the subscale scores were used in the current study in
order to generate a latent construct.

2.2.2. Anxiety. Caregivers completed the Spielberger State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [32] as a measure of anxiety.
The STAI is a 40-item self-report measure with a two-factor
structure. The S-anxiety subscale measures anxiety as a tem-
porary emotional state, while the T-anxiety subscale assesses
anxiety as a ﬁxed personality trait [32, 33]. Both subscales can
be combined to create a total scale which was used in the
current study. Total scale scores range from 40 to 160, with
higher scores indicating increased anxiety. The Spanish ver-
sion of the STAI [34] was used in this study and has demon-
strated very good construct validity and internal consistency
in samples of male (state α = 0 93, trait α = 0 96) and female
(state α = 0 88, trait α = 0 82) Spanish speakers [35, 36].

2.2.1. MS Impairments. Caregivers completed the MS
Impairment Questionnaire (MS-IQ) [26], a 30-item checklist

2.2.3. Burden. Caregivers completed the Zarit Burden Inven-
tory (ZBI) [37]. Item scores are summed, and total scores

4

range from 0 to 88 with higher scores indicating greater bur-
den [38]. The ZBI has been validated and used in numerous
neurological caregiver populations including TBI caregivers
[39], dementia caregivers [37], and Parkinson’s caregivers
[40]. The Spanish version of the ZBI has demonstrated excel-
lent construct validity and internal reliability (α = 0 92) in
samples of Spanish-speaking individuals [41].

2.2.4. Depression. Caregivers completed the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [42] as a measure of depressive
symptoms experienced within a two-week period. Total
scores range from 0 to 27 with higher scores reﬂecting more
severe symptoms of depression. The Spanish version has
demonstrated strong construct and criterion validity, as well
as excellent internal consistency and convergent validity in
Spanish-speaking validation samples [43–45].

2.2.5. Satisfaction with Life. Participants completed the
Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) [46]. Higher total scores
represent higher life satisfaction [47]. Participants com-
pleted the Spanish version of the SWLS, which has high
internal consistency (α = 0 88) and good construct validity
in Spanish-speaking samples [48, 49].

2.2.6. Family Needs. The Family Needs Assessment Tool
(FNAT) [50] assesses the degree to which needs are met in
family caregivers of individuals with neurological conditions
in Latin America. The FNAT is comprised of 14 items and
has ﬁve unmet needs subscales: household (two items),
informational (three items), ﬁnancial (three items), health
(four items), and social support (two items). Higher scores
indicate greater areas of unmet needs. As with the MS-IQ,
although it is possible to calculate a total score on the FNAT,
only the subscale scores were used in the current study in
order to generate a latent construct.

2.3. Procedure. Prior to recruitment, the Institutional Review
Board of the Mexican Foundation of Multiple Sclerosis
reviewed and approved the study protocol. Staﬀ at the
Mexican Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis and the Depart-
ment of Neurosciences of the University Center for Health
Sciences, University of Guadalajara recruited prospective
study participants from a neurology clinic using verbal and
written advertisements. Interested participants contacted
the research staﬀ and were screened for eligibility. Eligible
caregivers completed informed consent forms prior to data
collection. During a 40-minute appointment at the Mexican
Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis, a staﬀ psychologist col-
lected sociodemographic information and administered a
battery of questionnaires to caregivers using a structured
interview format to ensure that the participants understood
the item content and did not skip any items.

2.4. Data Analysis

2.4.1. Preliminary Analyses. Frequencies and descriptive
statistics were run to summarize MS impairments reported
by caregivers, frequently reported unmet family needs, and
clinically signiﬁcant caregiver mental health problems.

2.4.2. Hypothesis Testing. A structural equation model (SEM)
was created with three latent variables: MS impairments,
family needs, and caregiver mental health. MS impairments
was comprised of shared variance from the ﬁve impairment
variables: functional, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and
physical. Family needs were comprised of shared variance
from the ﬁve types of family needs: household, informational,
ﬁnancial, health, and social needs. Caregiver mental health
was comprised of shared variance from the four mental
health variables: depression, burden, anxiety, and satisfaction
with life. This SEM was conducted using AMOS 20 [51].
Because most traditional SEMs in rehabilitation research
are run with at least 200 participants [52], and the sample size
in the current study is 81 participants, estimates of model ﬁt
are likely to be inaccurate; we report indices of model ﬁt
solely for reference. Instead, the focus of this analysis was
on the size and signiﬁcance level of the standardized β weight
for the indirect eﬀect of MS impairments on caregiver mental
health through family needs.

domains, as seen in Table 3. Of the neurological impairments
reported, more than 75% of participants reported tiring
easily, while over half reported paralysis, poor eyesight, loss
of sensation, and clumsiness. More than half of the sample
reported the following emotional symptoms: depression,
easily upset,
irritability, and mood changes. Commonly
reported functional and cognitive impairments were diﬃ-
culty walking, doing things slowly, forgetfulness, and diﬃ-
culty concentrating. Less than half of participants reported
behavioral symptoms but endorsed acting impulsively as
the most commonly observed behavioral symptom. Care-
givers’ item responses to the FNAT were ranked (identifying
the top ﬁve) by the percentage of unmet need endorsements.
As illustrated in Table 4, a majority of the unmet needs
identiﬁed were from the informational domain, while the
remaining needs were from the social support domain.

Total scores on the PHQ-9 ranged from 0 to 21 out of a
possible maximum score of 27. The sample mean of 5.92
(SD = 5.27) indicated frequent endorsement of mild symp-
toms of depression. As seen in Table 5, nearly half of the
sample reported clinically signiﬁcant levels of depression,
with 26% reporting mild symptoms, 16% reporting moderate
symptoms, and 1.2% reporting severe symptoms of depres-
sion. Both total and subscale scores (e.g., state and trait) of
the STAI were examined. Participants’ total scores ranged
from 11 to 93 out of a maximum score of 160. Nearly one-
third of participants reported clinically signiﬁcant symptoms
of state or trait anxiety with 32% reporting moderate
symptoms on the state subscale and 2.5% reporting severe
symptoms on the state subscale of the measure. Responses
on the trait subscale demonstrated that 31% of participants
reported moderate symptoms on the trait subscale, while
3.7% reported severe symptoms. Total scores on the ZBI
ranged from 0 to 62 out of a maximum score of 88. The
sample mean of 22.02 (SD = 14.72) indicated that on average
participants reported mild to moderate symptoms of burden.

Further review of clinically signiﬁcant scores revealed that
29.6% reported mild to moderate symptoms, 12.3% reported
moderate to severe symptoms, and 1.2% reported severe
symptoms of burden. Total scores on the SWLS ranged
from 10 to 35 out of a maximum score of 35. The sample
mean of 23.43 (SD = 6.35) indicated an overall feeling of
general satisfaction.

Two structural equation models (SEMs) were created
family needs mediated the
to examine whether unmet
relationship between MS impairments and caregiver men-
tal health. Both models included three latent variables: MS
impairments, family needs, and caregiver mental health.
the following ﬁve
MS impairments was comprised of

manifest variables (i.e., subscale scores from the MS-IQ):
neurological, cognitive, functional, behavioral, and emo-
tional symptoms. Family needs was created using the ﬁve
manifest variables (i.e., subscale scores from the FNAT) of
ﬁnancial, informational, household, health, and social sup-
port needs. Caregiver mental health was created using four
manifest variables of depression (PHQ-9 total score), anxi-
ety (total STAI score), burden (total ZBI score), and satis-
faction with life (total SWLS score). In total, the models
were comprised of 33 variables, of which 14 were observed,
16 were unique, and 3 were factors. The manifest variables
are directly measured by a total score or subscale score,
represented in Figure 1 (the second, structural model) by
rectangles. The latent variables are measured indirectly
and inferred mathematically from the shared variance of
the manifest variables. In Figure 1, the latent variables are
represented by ovals.

Normality tests revealed that the distributions of the
measured variables were all normal in a univariate sense in
terms of skewness (all coeﬃcients ≤ an absolute value of
0.93) and kurtosis (all coeﬃcients ≤ an absolute value of
1.17). Similarly, a Mardia’s coeﬃcient of 2.23 suggested that
the variables were not multivariate kurtotic. It was further
found by the calculation of Mahalanobis distance that
no single observation was meaningfully far from the mul-
tivariate centroid (all ps ≥ 0.01), and therefore there were
no multivariate outliers.

The ﬁrst measurement model SEM examined correla-
tions (e.g., bidirectional paths) between each of the latent
variables as opposed to directional paths. In this model,
only one statistically signiﬁcant correlation emerged between
MS impairments and caregiver mental health at r = −0 64
(p < 0 01). The bivariate relationships between MS impair-
ments and family needs (r = 0 34, p = 0 39) and family
needs and caregiver mental health (r = −0 55, p = 0 37)
were not statistically signiﬁcant. Although two of these
correlations were not statistically signiﬁcant, all three were
in the expected direction and were at least medium sized.
In the second SEM (Figure 1), MS impairments were
speciﬁed to lead directly to caregiver mental health, as well
as to have an indirect eﬀect on caregiver mental health
through family needs. In this model, MS impairments
was signiﬁcantly associated with caregiver mental health
(β = −0 51, p = 0 003). MS impairments were not signiﬁ-
cantly associated with family needs (β = 0 34, p = 0 39),
nor was family needs associated with caregiver mental health
(β = −0 38, p = 0 39). However, again all three directional
paths were in the hypothesized direction. The indirect eﬀect
of MS impairments on caregiver mental health through fam-
ily needs was statistically signiﬁcant (β = 0 13, p = 0 008),
suggesting the presence of an indirect eﬀect. The following
ﬁt indices are presented only for reference: the ratio of the
χ2 statistic to the degrees of freedom in the model was 1.59;
the goodness of ﬁt index (GFI) was 0.85; the adjusted good-
ness of ﬁt index (AGFI) and the normed ﬁt index (NFI) were
0.78 and 0.72, respectively; the incremental ﬁt index (IFI),
Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and comparative ﬁt index (CFI)
were 0.87, 0.84, and 0.87, respectively; and the root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA) was 0.09.

speciﬁc emphasis on identifying unmet family needs as
a possible mediator of the relationship between MS impair-
ments and caregiver mental health. As hypothesized, this
study’s ﬁndings supported that unmet family needs mediated
the relationship between MS impairments and caregiver
mental health.

Prior to this study, several researchers had identiﬁed a
very strong relationship between patients’ clinical symp-
toms and their caregivers’ psychosocial functioning. How-
if any, researchers have been able to identify
ever, few,
speciﬁc mechanisms or correlates that account
for this
relationship. The statistically signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect of
MS impairments on caregiver mental health through unmet
family needs is the ﬁrst time this ﬁnding has emerged in
the research literature. One possible interpretation of this
ﬁnding is that as patients experience impairments in multiple

domains, family caregivers may need additional support or
may have new needs that they did not have when the
patient’s health was more stable [53]. When these needs are
unmet, the family has fewer coping resources to draw upon
and family members may experience greater distress. Previ-
ous research on caregivers of individuals with moderate to
severe MS impairments has consistently identiﬁed increased
needs for social, informational, and ﬁnancial support, as well
as higher rates of burden, strain, and depression [22, 54–57].
Findings from this study suggest that parents are provid-
ing the majority of the care for their children. This expands
the deﬁnition of MS caregiver often seen in previous studies
from a singular perspective that includes a spouse or roman-
tic partner to a broader deﬁnition that can include parents,
siblings, or other individuals providing care to the patient
within their family system. As such, health care providers
may need to focus on the impact of the patient and their
illness on family overall. Consideration for the needs of the
family system is particularly warranted in this sample as the
overall health of the family unit is an important part of
Mexican and Latino American cultures. Because unmet
family needs were identiﬁed as a mediator of the relationship
between MS impairments and caregiver mental health, health
care providers may also want to assess the psychosocial
functioning of family members in the household and target
interventions toward the family system. There is the potential
for a multifamily group intervention that informs caregivers
about the eﬀects of caregiving on families. Such an interven-
tion may help bring together families within the community
and could help normalize feelings of burden, disappoint-
ment, guilt, and fear that caregivers may be too guarded to
share with others.

With regard to primary unmet needs identiﬁed in this
study, a large number of participants reported unmet
informational needs, which included speciﬁc requests for
“specialized information about the patient,” “complete infor-
mation,” and “to share [their] feelings with someone who has
been in the same situation.” Caregivers in this sample may
beneﬁt from general education about MS (e.g., disease course,
symptom types, and treatments), as well as speciﬁc informa-
tion about behavioral and emotional
impairments (e.g.,
resource identiﬁcation, and symptom
psychoeducation,
management strategies). Data from caregivers of individuals
with Alzheimer’s disease [58] and Parkinson’s disease [59]
have demonstrated decreased burden and caregiver stress
among individuals who complete psychoeducational pro-
grams for management of symptoms associated with these

illnesses [60]. Likewise, because of the speciﬁc interest identi-
ﬁed by these caregivers, MS caregivers could possibly beneﬁt
from education that assists with daily care needs or helps
caregivers understand and anticipate possible sequelae of
the disease.

Additionally, the caregivers may have had informational
needs that were not assessed. As such, a focus group or
follow-up survey to assess the type of information that
caregivers need is a feasible way to help meet the needs of
caregivers in this sample or other samples as diﬀerent care-
giver cohorts will likely have diﬀerent needs dependent on
the patient’s course, family composition, and family’s access
to medical resources. Moreover, although caregivers were
requesting information in this study, they indicated a need
to speak with other caregivers and to receive social support
in addition to pragmatic suggestions, recommendations,
and information. Interventions designed to facilitation dis-
semination of information through peer support, mentoring,
and support groups oﬀered in person or via telephone or
internet have demonstrated eﬃcacy in other caregiver popu-
lations [61] and could provide MS caregivers with increased
access to these resources as well.

Interventions designed to help caregivers determine how
to meet ﬁnancial and household needs could help alleviate
the negative mental health outcomes that caregivers in this
sample experienced. Addressing these needs may include
education about resources in the community (e.g., grants,
supplemental income, and respite care services) that are
available to families in the region or education about how
to delegate household tasks. Addressing these needs may
also require education about when to seek support outside
of the family (e.g., respite care) and ways to overcome cul-
tural barriers to accepting and accessing care outside of a
kinship network.

In addition to this key ﬁnding, mental health outcomes
reported by this sample diﬀered somewhat from other studies
of MS caregivers and individuals in Mexico. Epidemiological
data from Mexico suggest a lifetime prevalence of 7.2% for
major depressive disorder [62], which demonstrates that

reported rates of depression in the current study are higher
than those generally reported in the Mexican population.
Although few studies have examined anxiety among MS
caregivers, Argyriou et al. [63] reported mean scores that
reﬂected mild anxiety in their sample, while the scores in
the current study demonstrated subclinical mean values for
state and trait anxiety, even though one-third of the sample
endorsed moderate symptoms of anxiety. When comparing
this sample’s scores to epidemiological lifetime prevalence
data for anxiety in Mexico, participants in this sample
reported higher than expected anxiety (i.e., 14.3% prevalence
rate as reported by Medina-Mora et al. [62]). A comparison
with other studies of MS caregivers demonstrates that the
current sample’s percentages of MS caregivers experiencing
mild, moderate, and severe burden are much lower than rates
reported in other samples. For example, in another sample
of MS caregivers, Akkus [18] reported a mean ZBI score
of 36.42 (SD = 18.41), while Buchanan and Huang [64]
found that 40% of their sample described caregiving as
burdensome some of the time and 11.4% reported that
caregiving was burdensome all of the time. These ﬁndings
suggest the need for health care providers to continuously
assess the mental health of caregivers and to provide them
with access to services that can include emotional support
(e.g., support groups, volunteer organizations, nursing care,
spiritual/religious leaders, and communities) throughout
the disease’s duration.

4.1. Limitations and Future Research. The ﬁndings of this
limitations,
study should be viewed in light of several
which can be

considered potential areas
research. Unlike many samples of MS caregivers, care-
givers in the current study were predominately women
who were mothers of the care recipients. This is indeed
a rarity in the MS literature, as generally caregivers are
male spouses providing care for their wives with MS.
Future studies should examine the inﬂuence of gender
roles prominent in Latino cultures on caregiving behaviors
in both women and men MS caregivers and how these

8

Behavioural Neurology

roles might play out in same-gender and opposite-gender
caregiving relationships.

Because of the strong cultural values of familism and
the stigma associated with neurological illness, caregivers
within this sample may have underreported symptoms of
burden, depression, and anxiety. Given the desire to fulﬁll
cultural roles, Latina women, especially mothers, may not
perceive caregiving as burdensome or they may be reluc-
tant to disclose feelings of strain, anxiety, and sadness.
By contrast,
in other countries where male spouses or
romantic partners typically fulﬁll MS caregiving roles, per-
ceptions of burden may be stronger, as caregiving is a new
skill set for them.

Additionally, the reported household incomes of the
families in this sample may be higher than other caregivers
who do not receive subsidized care and who are not
employed while providing care. This study’s participants
were recruited from an urban university medical center and
a local chapter of the MS foundation. As such, this sample’s
utilization of care and access to resources may be greater than
most caregivers, especially those living in rural areas or
individuals living in underdeveloped societies where health
care is not as accessible. The ﬁndings in this sample may
overlook or underestimate the true needs and psychosocial
functioning of caregivers who do not have adequate
resources and thus cannot acquire medical care for their
loved ones and are not as well connected with community-
based organizations.

Unmet family needs was one of the most important
constructs assessed in the current study. At present, there
are few empirically validated neurological-speciﬁc family
needs assessments for use in Latin America other than that
used in the current study. As such, the FNAT was used
because the measure had been validated in a sample of care-
givers of individuals with neurological conditions in Latin
America [50]. Despite this strength, this measure’s limita-
tions include a narrow assessment of additional possible
family needs which may or may not be MS-speciﬁc. As
administered in the current study, only one individual in
the family completed the questionnaire. However, in order
to truly assess family needs, administration of the measure
should include reports from all family members of the
individual receiving care. As the measure is currently written
and administered, the results only oﬀer the perspective of
one reporter but attribute this variance to the perspectives
of others within the family unit. By including multiple
reporters, researchers can then diﬀerentiate between variance
observed within reporters (unique reporter variance) and
across reporters (e.g., shared variance).

Another way to improve the measure is to increase the
comprehensiveness and speciﬁcity of the constructs being
assessed. Although the items in the current measure come
from an aggregate of
items from needs assessments of
caregivers of individuals with MS and other neurological
disorders, the current measure does not include items that
assess potentially important aspects such as the need for
respite care, the speciﬁc types of information that caregivers
need, assistance with obtaining medical equipment, and the
need for holistic or nontraditional medical practices that

may be common and useful in Latin America. Including
these items may come from additional focus groups and
surveys with MS caregivers in other communities, espe-
cially communities of individuals who are hard to reach
or who do not regularly access medical care. As such,
the literature could greatly beneﬁt from an MS-speciﬁc
measure of family needs that has been developed using a
Spanish-speaking sample and has been empirically validated
in similar samples.

Similarly, the current study used the MS Impairments
Questionnaire, a 30-item checklist of MS symptoms devel-
oped by Knight et al. [26] to assess the types of symptoms that
patients experience. Although this questionnaire assesses the
general clusters of symptoms shown to be common in indi-
viduals with MS, the measure itself has not gone through
extensive psychometric evaluation. Additionally, several of
the items comprising this questionnaire are vague and may
into Spanish (e.g., “being unreliable”).
not translate well
Because of the importance of accurate assessment of MS
symptoms, this measure should undergo further revision
and evaluation in an attempt to assess additional symptoms
of MS, as some of the common symptoms such as sexual
dysfunction, attention problems, and heat sensitivity were
omitted. A revised version should also include a factor analy-
sis of items, as well as measure of disease severity or disability
since the presence of a symptom does not necessarily indicate
its functional impact or severity. As with the FNAT, a mea-
sure of MS symptoms should include multiple raters and/or
a review of medical records to support self-reported and
caregiver-reported data. Relying on the caregiver’s perspec-
tive may overlook symptoms that the caregiver is unaware
of (e.g., sexual dysfunction) and result in an incomplete
assessment of patient functioning.

Finally, although the assumptions of normality were met
for the SEM in the current study, the sample size was too
small to generate accurate ﬁt indices. Though they were pre-
sented for reference, they likely lack the stability that would
occur with sample sizes greater than 200. As a result, these
ﬁt indices should be interpreted with extreme caution, and
similar models should be run with larger samples in order
to more accurately assess whether the current model or other
models better ﬁt the patterns in the data.

5. Conclusions

This study provided empirical support for the mediational
role of unmet family needs in the relationship between MS
impairments and caregiver mental health in Guadalajara,
Mexico. These ﬁndings
that MS impairments
suggest
may aﬀect both the individual caregiver and the family
unit. As a result, MS rehabilitation interventions, especially
in Mexico and other Latin American countries, should
comprehensively assess and target the patient’s function-
ing, the family’s unmet needs, and the caregiver’s mental
health functioning. Doing so—if
supported by future
research—could improve services for a population that
has faced marginalization and a dearth of care within tra-
ditional rehabilitation settings.
