Patients’ assessment of professionalism and
communication skills of medical graduates
Fatima T Abadel* and Abdulla S Hattab

Abstract

Background: Professionalism and communication skills constitute important components of the integral formation
of physicians which has repercussion on the quality of health care and medical education. The objective of this
study was to assess medical graduates’ professionalism and communication skills from the patients’ perspective
and to examine its association with patients’ socio-demographic variables.
Methods: This is a hospital based cross-sectional study. It involved 315 patients and 105 medical graduates selected
by convenient sampling method. A modified and validated version of the American Board of Internal Medicine’s (ABIM)
Patient Assessment survey questionnaire was used for data collection through a face to face interview. Data processing
and analysis were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) 16.0. Mean, frequency distribution,
and percentage of the variables were calculated. A non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test was applied to verify whether the
patients’ assessment was influenced by variables such as age, gender, education, at a level of significance, p ≤ 0.05.
Results: Female patients constituted 46% of the sample, whereas males constituted 54%. The mean age was 36 ± 16.
Patients’ scoring of the graduate’s skills ranged from 3.29 to 3.83 with a mean of 3.64 on a five-point Likert scale. Items
assessing the “patient involvement in decision-making” were assigned the minimum mean values, while items dealing
with “establishing adequate communication with patient” assigned the maximum mean values. Patients, who were older
than 45 years, gave higher scores than younger ones (p < 0.001). Patients with higher education reported much lower
scores than those with lower education (p = 0.003). Patients’ gender did not show any statistically significant influence
on the rating level.
Conclusion: Generally patients rated the medical graduates’ professionalism and communication skills at a good level.
Patients’ age and educational level were significantly associated with the rating level.

Background
The importance of patients’ opinion in the evaluation
of doctors’ professional performance and the quality of
health care has been stressed in several studies [1-4]. The
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME) has focused on the importance of residents’
competence in professionalism and interpersonal and
communication skills [5,6]. Today, professionalism consti-
tutes an indispensable quality for any practicing physician.
Literature review emphasizes the following requirements
for professionalism:
integrity, honesty, compassion, a
commitment to keeping current with medical advances,
the ability to communicate effectively with patients,
and to respect patient autonomy [7-12]. Communication

with patients is the core clinical skill for the practice
of medicine. It has been defined as specific tasks and
observable behaviors that include interviewing to obtain
a medical history, explaining a diagnosis and prognosis,
giving therapeutic instructions and information needed
for informed consent to undergo diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures, and providing counseling to motivate participa-
tion in therapy or to relieve symptoms [13,14]. Respect for
patients’ needs and wishes are central to any human health
care system [15]. Clinical communication is complex in
nature, and both personal and curricular factors will influ-
ence how medical students master the relevant skills [16].
Lakoff et al. argued that communication skills appear to be
an integral part of one’s cognition where basic or general
communication skills are developed early in life, but the
theoretical knowledge about communication skills comes
years later and not through medical studies alone [17].

Positive doctor-patient relationship can increase the
patient’s perceptions of physician competence [18]. Re-
search has shown that physicians who exhibit negative
communication behaviors are more likely to have been
sued in the past for malpractice than those with more
positive doctor patient relationship [19-22]. Beckman,
et al. found that in 70% of malpractice depositions,
communication problems between physicians and patients
were identified [23].

The assessment of patients’ perception of the medical
graduates’ professionalism and communication skills during
their first postgraduate years could provide an early indi-
cator of the quality of the undergraduate curriculum and
educational process and constitutes an important compo-
nent of the evaluation of the quality of health care. These
issues have been well documented in the medical literature
[3,4,6,8,18,21,22]. To our knowledge, this is the first study
of its kind to be performed in Yemen.

This study aimed at answering the following question:
How do patients assess medical graduates’ professionalism
and communication skills in Aden hospitals?

Methods
Study design
This is a cross-sectional hospital-based study conducted
during the period from 1st January to 30th March, 2010. It
constitutes a part of a larger study which deals with the dif-
ferent areas of medical graduates’ competency: professional-
ism, communication skills, clinical skills, population health,
management of information, and critical thinking [24].

Study setting
The study was carried out in eight hospitals’ outpatient
clinics and inpatient wards, (four public and four private)
in Aden city, where the medical graduates were working
at the time of data collection.

Yemen is located at the south western corner of Asia.
It has an area of 527,970 square kilometers, 23.85 million
inhabitants, and is divided administratively into twenty
one governorates. Aden governorate is the commercial
and economic capital of the unified Yemen with nearly
one million inhabitants. Geographically Aden is located at
the south-western corner of the Arabian Peninsula. It
overlooks the Arabian Sea to the south and the Red Sea to
the west. Administratively, Aden governorate is divided
into eight districts [25].

The study population
This study was designed to include two different popula-
tions: medical graduates and patients.

had studied the same curriculum and were working at
Aden hospitals. One hundred and five graduates (61.9%
females and 38.1% males) were included in the study. All
of them were available at the time of data collection and
gave their consent to participate in the study.

Recruitment strategies

1. A list including the names of medical graduates

(2005-2009) and their work location was obtained
from hospitals’ administrations.

2. In coordination with the hospitals’ authorities and
heads of the departments, meetings were organized
with the potential research participants (medical
graduates). In these meetings, a detailed explanation
of the study objectives and methods were provided.

3. Potential research participants were asked to give

their consent to have their performance
(professionalism and communication skills) rated by
some patients whom they cared for, without
knowing which patients or when data will be
collected. Accordingly verbal consent was obtained.
None of the graduates who were approached
declined participation in the study.

Patients
Sample size The sample size was determined by con-
venient purposeful quota sampling method with which
every graduate will be assessed by three different pa-
tients; accordingly the sample was 315 patients [26]. The
participants were selected according to the following
criteria: adult patient (18 years or older), fully conscious
and verbally expressed willingness to participate in the
study.

Sampling methods A multi-stage stratified random sam-
pling was performed. First, four districts were randomly
selected. Then, two hospitals from each district were ran-
domly selected (one public and one private hospital).
Finally, the 315 patients were proportionally distributed
according to the proportion of graduates in the selected
hospitals. The sample frame for this study was the out-
patients’ clinics and the inpatients’ wards of the selected
hospitals where the medical graduates were working.
The patients were selected by systematic random sampling
method where every 3rd patient was approached. If the
patient refused to take part in the study or was ineli-
gible, the next eligible patient was selected. Thirty nine
patients declined participation in the study so they were
substituted by others.

Medical graduates
The study population covered all the medical graduates
of Aden University during the period 2005–2009 who

Data collection Data were collected through a direct
face to face interview. An exit interview was conducted
with the hospitals’ outpatients immediately after leaving

the consultation room. For the inpatients interviews were
conducted at the moment of discharge. All
interviews
were conducted by the same researcher with the same
method for all patients. The absence of time lag between
consultations and interviews minimize or adjusts for
recall bias. To guarantee the participants’ privacy, inter-
views were performed in a private side-room which was
secured by a special arrangement with the hospitals’
administration.

Instrument For data collection a validated Arabic version
of the ABIM’s Patient Assessment survey questionnaire,
which is a part of the Patient and Physician Peer Assess-
ment Module for maintenance of certification, was used
(Additional file 1) [27]. Different studies have validated
the ABIM domains not only in the context in which it
was originally developed in the USA [28-35] but also in
other non-western countries Taiwan, Iran, Japan and
Saudi Arabia [36-39].

Content validity of the survey questionnaire was exam-
ined by asking ten experts at the Faculty of Medicine to
judge if the items cover all aspects of the domain intended
to be measured. In addition, a pilot study was carried out
and the internal consistency reliability of the questionnaire
was calculated using (Cronbach’s alpha) and was found
to be >0.9.

The questionnaire included ten questions about differ-
ent aspects of professionalism and communication skills.
Patients were asked to rate each of these aspects on a
five-point Likert scale ranging from poor (being the
lowest level of competency, scored 1) to excellent (being
the highest level scored 5). The final version of the
questionnaire appears in Table 1.

Ethical considerations

1. The study protocol was approved by “the Committee
of Research and Postgraduate Studies, Faculty of
Medicine and Health Science, Aden University” which
is responsible for both ethical and scientific review in
compliance with Helsinki Declaration.

2. Permission of the hospitals’ authorities where the

study was conducted was obtained.

3. Verbal consent was obtained from all potential
participants after providing them with detailed
explanation of the objectives, importance and
benefits of the research. They were also assured that
all the collected data would be handled with full
confidentiality. Furthermore, they were informed
that they had the right to refuse participation, and/
or to withdraw at any moment.

Data analysis
Data processing was performed using the SPSS 16.0 soft-
ware package. Multi items of competency for each parti-
cipant were computed into singular mean and singular
percentage. For the convenience of analysis, the five-point
Likert scale was re-categorized into three groups: inad-
equate, good and very good, where the inadequate group
combined the fair and poor scores and the very good group
combined the very good and excellent scores.

The mean, frequency distribution and percentage of
the variables were calculated. A non-parametric Kruskal
Wallis test was applied to verify whether the raters’ as-
sessments were influenced by variables such as patients’
age, sex, education and residency at a (p ≤ 0.05) level of
significance.

Results
A total number of 315 patients who attended the selected
hospitals during the study period were interviewed;
54% of them were males. Female patients were younger
than males. The mean age was (36 ± 16). Most of the male
participants had primary education 63%. The majority of
females were illiterate 57.1%. Urban residencies were
72.7% (Table 2).

The socio-demographic characteristics of the medical
graduates are summarized in Table 3. A total number of
105 medical graduates participated in the study; among
them 61.9% were females. The mean age was 28.8 ± 2.30
years; ranging from 25 to 32 years. The graduates’ experi-
ence ranged from three months to four years. The highest
proportion of the graduates in this study was those with
four years of experience 41.9%, followed by those with 2-3
years of experience 38.1%. The majority of the graduates
58.1% work in public hospitals where 54.30% of them
work in the outpatient clinic whereas the remaining
45.70% work in the inpatient. The distribution of the
physicians in outpatient and in inpatient depends on
work load in the different sites and is liable for change
from time to time as perceived by the hospital administra-
tion. The majority of the graduates 47.6% work in internal
medicine while the remaining work in pediatrics 21%,
surgery 21% and obstetrics 10.5%.

Female patients were less likely than males patient to
rate the medical graduates’ professionalism and com-
munication skills at a very good 35.2% versus 37.1%,
but was not statistically significant. Patients’ age group
and education level were strongly associated with their

perception of the graduates’ performance. Among the age
group of >45 years, 52.5% rated the graduates’ competency
as very good (p: 0.001), Table 4.

The level of patients’ rating the graduates’ skills was
inversely associated with their education level. This is
illustrated in Table 4, where 40% of the illiterates perceived
the graduates communication skills and professionalism as
very good. In contrast, only 15.2% of the participants with
university education rated them as very good (p: 0.003).

Table 5 shows the mean values of the patients’ assessment
of the various items of professionalism and communication
skills, which ranges from 3.29 to 3.83. The items dealing
with the ability of establishing adequate communication
with patients (10, 2 and 3) scored the highest mean values:
3.83, 3.80 and 3.75 respectively: while the items addressing
patients’ involvement in decision-making and respect of
patient autonomy (9, 8 and 7) scored relatively low mean
values 3.54, 3.52 and 3.29 respectively.

patients’ perspective and to examine its association with
patients’ socio-demographic variables. Patients’ opinion
as an important dimension of the evaluation of the pro-
fessional performance and the quality of care has been
emphasized by several authors [1-4]. There is increasing
evidence that professionalism and communication skills
constitute an indispensable quality for any practicing
physician. It covers the following requirements: integrity,
honesty, compassion, a commitment to keeping current

with medical advances, and the ability to communicate
effectively with patients, and respect their autonomy [7-12].
The findings of the current study revealed that the
mean score value of the overall patients’ rating of medical
graduates’ skills was 3.64 on five-points Likert scale. Lower
mean score values 3 and 3.1 were reported from Kuwait
by Bu-Alayyan et al. and Al-Doghaither et al. [40,41]
respectively. Much lower mean score value 2.45 was
reported from Saudi Arabia [42]. On the other hand

higher mean score values 4.86, 4.81 and 3.81 were reported
from the USA by Wood et al. [43], Stewart et al. [44] and
Moor et al. [18] respectively. This wide variation in the
findings might be explained by the different study designs,
different instruments for data collection and the different
settings in which the studies were conducted.

Several studies indicate that the socio-demographic
variables could have significant impact on patients’
expectations, satisfaction and perception of the quality
of medical care [45,46]. Our study showed that patients of
older age group reported significantly higher level of
rating than those of younger age groups. This finding is
consistent with what has been reported by Campbell et al.
and by Kong et al. [45,46]. The lower level of rating
among younger age groups might be explained by the
critical attitude and higher expectations of these age
groups. Illiterate patients and those with lower educational
levels gave significantly higher scores of rating than those
with higher educational levels. This finding is supported
by a similar study conducted by Fiscella [47]. The differ-
ence in rating by educational level could be explained by
the greater exigencies of the highly educated patients.

Establishing adequate communication with the patient
has been identified as a corner-stone in the doctor patient
relationship, and constitutes a pre-requisite for appro-
priate diagnosis, management and quality care, which
in turn positively impacts patients’ satisfaction [16,48].
Also, patients’ involvement in decision-making is widely
recognized as an expression of patient respect and patient
autonomy [49-51]. In the current study, patients rated
the different items of graduates’ professionalism and
communication skills at a good level. The items assessing
the ability of establishing adequate communication with
patients scored the highest mean values, which is similar
to what has been reported by Clever et al. [52]. On the
other hand a relatively lower mean score values were given
to patient involvement in decision–making. Sekimoto et al.
[53] from Japan reported higher mean score values in this
area of competency. The findings of our study could be
explained by the dominance of the paternalistic approach
in the doctor patient relationship in the clinical practice
environment in which the graduates perform their duties.
This interpretation is consistent with what has been
reported by Roter et al. and Braddock et al. [54,55].

Further studies are recommended for better understand-
ing of the factors that influence patients’ perception of the
quality of communication skills and professionalism of the
medical graduates.

Study limitations
Due to constraints of time and resources, this study covered
only the graduates working in Aden hospitals. However, the
medical graduates of Aden university are deployed allover
the country, both in urban and rural areas that have wide

variation in working conditions, and facilities. To have more
reliable assessment, it is recommended that future studies
include larger and more representative samples that cover
different areas and settings of practice. Also, this study did
not investigate the organizational and structural features
of outpatients’ clinics and hospital wards which might
have significant influence on physicians’ performance and
the overall quality of care and consequently on patients’
rating level of professionalism and communication skills
[43-45]. Therefore, these aspects need to be addressed in
future studies.

Conclusion
Generally, patients rated the graduates’ professionalism
and communication skills at a good level. Patients’ age
and educational level were positively associated with the
rating level. Younger age groups and those with higher
education were more critical in their assessment. The
highest rating scores were observed for the items assessing
the ability of establishing adequate communication with
patient and the minimum scores for those dealing with
patient involvement in decision-making. The findings
of this study are very important for curriculum reforms
that should address the identified areas of competency
that need further improvement as well as for continuing
professional development programs. Graduates-assessment
should be conducted on regular basis, with feedback for all
stakeholders in order to make the necessary interventions
for promoting the professional competency and the quality
of care. Further studies on larger samples and different
settings are recommended.
