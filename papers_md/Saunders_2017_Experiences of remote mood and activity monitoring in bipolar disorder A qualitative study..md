Abstract

Background—Mobile technology enables high frequency mood monitoring and automated 
passive collection of data (e.g. actigraphy) from patients more efficiently and less intrusively than 
has previously been possible. Such techniques are increasingly being deployed in research and 
clinical settings however little is known about how such approaches are experienced by patients. 
Here, we explored the experiences of individuals with bipolar disorder engaging in a study 
involving mood and activity monitoring with a range of portable and wearable technologies.

Method—Patients were recruited from a wider sample of 50 individuals with Bipolar Disorder 
taking part in the Automated Monitoring of Symptom Severity (AMoSS) study in Oxford. A sub-
set of 21 patients participated in a qualitative interview that followed a semi-structured approach.

Results—Monitoring was associated with benefits including increased illness insight, 
behavioural change. Concerns were raised about the potential preoccupation with, and paranoia 
about, monitoring. Patients emphasized the need for personalization, flexibility, and the 
importance of context, when monitoring mood.

Conclusions—Mobile and electronic health approaches have potential to lend new insights into 
mental health and transform healthcare. Capitalizing on the perceived utility of these approaches 
from the patients’ perspective, while addressing their concerns, will be essential for the promise of 
new technologies to be realised.

Introduction

Page 2

Symptom assessment in bipolar disorder (BD), like many other mental health disorders, is 
based upon self-report measures. Self-reported symptoms are highly dependent upon an 
individual’s ability to accurately recall information and communicate complex mood states, 
aspects of assessment that many patients find difficult [1]. In addition, subjective self-report 
of manic and depressive symptoms is influenced by decreased illness insight, especially 
during manic or hypomanic episodes [2]. In recent years, the use of remote mood 
monitoring for BD has grown dramatically [3]. Reporting symptoms via text and e-mail in 
response to scheduled prompts overcomes the challenge of patient recall and is an easy and 
inexpensive way to collect mood data prospectively and longitudinally [4].

Objective monitoring, particularly activity monitoring, also has the potential to indicate 
clinically important changes in symptoms [5,6]. Many symptoms of BD manifest in changes 
of physical [7–9] and social activity [10]. Research exploring objectively monitored activity 
as an indicator of diagnostic classification and mood changes has benefited from advances in 
the sophistication and widespread accessibility of portable and wearable technologies. The 
increasing ubiquity of smart phones with in-built actigraphy, light and other sensors provide 
a platform for collecting such data remotely, whilst wearable activity monitors are 
increasingly popular and provide a practical solution to long-term activity monitoring. 
However, if such approaches are to be successful in the management of BD, they need to be 
acceptable to patients.

A number of studies are currently exploring multi-sensor monitoring in BD to explore 
whether objective measures can provide clinically meaningful information [11–14]. 
Although preliminary findings have demonstrated correlations with clinician-rated 
depressive symptoms [15] and accurate mood state recognition in small samples of BD 
patients [16], we know very little about the perceived clinical usefulness of monitoring from 
patients. Few studies have explored patient experiences of using these technologies [17,18], 
and those that have tend to focus on the usefulness and usability of device systems to collect 
and visualise data. In addition, some studies interpret device compliance as the sole indicator 
of tolerability [4,19]. We wanted to explore how patients interpret and use such data in ways 
that might be clinically useful. We conducted a qualitative study with the aim to explore the 
experiences of patients with BD who have engaged in remote mood and activity monitoring 
as part of the Automated Monitoring of Symptom Severity study (AMoSS), in order to 
understand the personal and clinical benefits to patients using these technologies, and to 
identify any potential barriers to use. A qualitative approach was employed because it is 
flexible, grounded in individual experiences, and because we know so little about how 
tolerable or acceptable automated symptom monitoring is to patients.

2  Material and Methods

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from East of England NHS Research Ethics 
Committee (13/EE/0288) and practice was informed by the principles manifest in the 
Declaration of Helsinki.

2.1  Participants

Page 3

Participants were 21 individuals who were members of the wider AMoSS sample of 50 BD 
participants. The AMoSS study is a prospective longitudinal study where participants 
monitor their mood daily using a study-specific smartphone app, complete weekly mood 
measures using the True Colours system (https://
www.oxfordhealth.truecolours.nhs.uk/www/en/) and wear movement sensing devices. In 
addition, participants have one week of intensive monitoring where they complete ten times 
daily mood ratings and monitor a number of physiological variables. Full study details can 
be found in the supplementary materials online (see also http://www.conbrio.psych.ox.ac.uk/
the-amoss-study). Recruitment into AMoSS was via outpatient secondary mental health 
services and advertising in the community. Exclusion criteria were minimal but included 
lack of capacity to consent and those who had been a psychiatric inpatient in the last month. 
Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants underwent screening by an 
experienced psychiatrist (KEAS) using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 
(SCID) and met criteria for DSM IV BD. Individuals were invited to interview when they 
had completed 12 weeks of mood and activity monitoring, or had withdrawn before this time 
(n = 1). Purposive sampling was used to ensure that those who had left the study and those 
who had submitted incomplete data were also included. No individuals refused to participate 
in an interview. Once data saturation occurred, no further participants were invited to 
interview.

2.2  Data gathering

In the majority of cases interviews were conducted in person (n = 13, 62%) and the 
remainder were conducted by phone. Interviews were conducted by one of three members of 
the research team (KEAS, PP, LA). Participant interviews were conducted using a semi-
structured topic schedule and were audio-recorded (for full topic schedule and more 
information about qualitative interviews see Supplementary Material). Interviews varied in 
length from 20 to 100 minutes.

Demographic data were gathered from all participants, including age, gender and current 
medication (Table 1). Quantitative feedback regarding frequency of questionnaire prompting 
and tolerability of actigraphy devices was collected on feedback forms between weeks 8 and 
12 of the study. Participants were asked to indicate, using 7-point Likert scales, the 
convenience of mood prompting and the convenience and comfort of monitoring devices (1 
being not at all uncomfortable/not at all inconvenient and 7 being very uncomfortable/very 
inconvenient). Feedback forms also provided an opportunity for participants to give more 
detailed written feedback regarding how devices were used and worn during the study, 
whether there were unwanted factors influencing data collection, and any other details of 
their experience using each device. Feedback forms were filled out by 95% of interviewed 
patients (n = 20). At the time of the interview, just one participant had decided to leave the 
study following three months of participation.

2.3  Data analysis

Qualitative data coding, management and analysis were conducted using NVivo software 
[20]. Interviews were conducted as part of an on-going and iterative process of data

collection and analysis. Audiotaped interviews were transcribed, reviewed, and uploaded to 
NVivo. Qualitative analysis used a framework technique [21]. The framework technique 
allows both thematic and case-based analysis (or a combination of both) while retaining a 
direct link to the data. It has been specifically developed for use in settings where there are 
specific questions, a limited time frame, a pre-designed sample (e.g. research participants) 
and a priori issues (e.g. tolerability and acceptability) that need to be dealt with. Although 
framework analysis can be used to generate hypotheses its main focus is to describe or 
interpret what is happening in a particular setting. Two members of the study team, a 
psychiatrist and research assistant, conducted an initial round of analyses independent of one 
another. The results of these analyses were then shared and discussed with the wider 
research team, leading to further refinement of the thematic framework. To reduce researcher 
bias, we discussed and maintained an awareness of preconceptions (facilitated by 
interviewer note-keeping and memos) and constantly linked the emerging thematic 
framework to the participant-derived data. Data gathering ceased when no further advance 
was being made in understanding the participants’ experiences of monitoring.

Quantitative data were summarised using standard statistical approaches. Data were not 
normally distributed, with a pronounced positive skew evident in the distribution of both 
convenience and comfort scores, and negative skew in the distribution of compliance scores. 
Therefore, non-parametric tests were used to make statistical comparisons.

3  Results

3.1  Qualitative interview findings

Six themes emerged from the interviews, which provided greater understanding as to how 
patients interpreted, reflected upon, and in turn utilised mood and activity monitoring within 
the context of managing BD.

Insight—The majority (n = 16, 76%) of participants described how the use of 

3.1.1 
mood and activity monitoring enhanced their understanding of their illness.

“I thought it was interesting because you’re doing it so often noticing how quickly 
your mood can change within a day.” Participant 3-F

“It’s really apparent to me that the more I do, like my mood’s quite good today 
because I went to the gym yesterday… … if my mood’s a bit low I might ea, eat 
unhealth-, make unhealthy food choices … … I definitely recognised that I do feel 
better if I’m more active.” Participant 1-F

“It’s probably made me more aware of … in that when I do think to look at the 
[True Colours] graph I can say if my depression’s dipping … or going up even that 
I’ll go right I’ll go for a walk at lunchtime, you know so I suppose it gives me a 
little sense of control.” Participant 2-F

Half the participants highlighted how monitoring their mood had been useful in enabling 
them to identify how they were feeling and that this in itself led to an improvement.

“My difficulty there was I recognised the pattern of behaviour and couldn’t name it 
and once I named it I was fine I brought my mood right down again… you see my 
anxiety starting to go up and then it goes like that and then it comes right down like 
that as soon as I’d named it and identified it.” Participant 5-F

“Having to sort of reflect on my mood, on my how I was feeling actually helped, 
helped me to sort of temper it and control It …

… sometimes if I was feeling you know particularly stressed or whatever, I would, I 
would, I would get out the phone and I’d do it [Mood Zoom] and that, and just that 
act would, would, would be helpful to me.” Participant 6-M

The relationship between mood states and sleep was noted by a number of participants (n = 
6, 29%).

“Because everyone has bad days and I think when you’ve got bipolar it’s kind of 
you’re always on the verge of thinking oh is this when I’m going to really crash. 
Just having a look at the graph and thinking actually no it might be just because I 
didn’t sleep well last night.” Participant 7-F

3.1.2  Behavioural change—In over half of participants, mood and activity monitoring 
was associated with a change in behaviour. The majority of change related to activity, with 
most finding that they had increased their exercise levels as a result of taking part in the 
study.

“I think it encourages you to do more exercise if you come to the end of the day 
and you have a choice of walking to the pub or driving I’m more likely to walk.” 
Participant 11-F

“Makes you think about the amount of exercise that you’re doing…it has made me 
move more and I will try, I do try and get more exercise in during the day. But 
yeah, I think it has actually changed my behaviour for the better.” Participant 8-M

Others commented on improving their sleep hygiene.

“I thought mmm I’d, I would like to get a bit more sleep and I’ll go to bed a bit 
earlier, because I do notice, that, my bi-, one of my … ways of managing bipolar is 
to get a good amount of sleep.” Participant 1-F

3.1.3  Context—A majority (n = 14, 66%) of participants spoke about the importance of 
context when monitoring mood. Concerns were raised that reactive mood changes might be 
misinterpreted as representing illness relapse. They emphasised that mood changes were to 
be expected in many instances. In some cases, participants expressed the desire to be able to 
record context in order to be able to reflect on possible patterns and triggers to their mood 
episodes.

“Had I done a workout and then filled in my AMoSS, the scores would’ve been 
really high, but then again there would be no way to say I’ve just done a workout.” 
Participant 4-F

“I started a new job in January and 3 days before then I really was incredibly 
anxious and you know yes it’s reflected in the score but there wasn’t anything that 
actually provided the context of why I might have been anxious at that time which I 
think would have been very very useful with this information because obviously if 
you’re anxious for no particular reason or you’re anxious for a trivial reason then 
that’s actually something that’s quite informative.” Participant 8-M

3.1.4  Concerns—Four participants spoke about the potential for monitoring to become 
preoccupying and thus unhelpful.

“I was thinking with all this self-monitoring you can go insane, you can go 
completely over board. In addition to the alcohol monitoring I also started doing 
budget monitoring and this is how you can go nuts …I realised I was spending an 
hour and a half or 2 hours a day just calculating what I was doing and I said “this is 
out of control, I need a life.” Participant 12-F

“Just sort of thought I think that generally you can examine your own navel too 
much and if you’re wondering if you’ve got a little bit of anxiety or those are 
normal things aren’t they and I didn’t want to sound abnormal.” Participant 13-F

A few (n = 3, 14%) expressed a desire to receive feedback or interpretation of their data.

“Just putting the data out into the ether suddenly felt quite, haven’t really, felt a bit 
alone with it all, is it actually, what are you getting out of it, I don’t think I’m 
getting out of it very much anymore. Um, needed a bit more reciprocal perhaps.” 
Participant 14-M

“Having some kind of reassurance about that or explanation I think would have 
been very very useful.” Participant 8-M

Two participants raised concerns as to how they might misinterpret monitoring when unwell 
and many others highlighted the need for such devices to look normal and not draw attention 
from the general public.

“It would freak me out if I had to do that while being paranoid… I think my main 
concern was with the paranoia and with having lots of equipment.” Participant 7-F

“It’s so ugly and it’s so noticeable and people will say or people will tease you 
about your watch or something else and so it brings into focus it’s something 
different.” Participant 11-F

“They’ll see the number, they might see the number on the front and that just looks 
like I expect a sort of serial prison number or something. Or it could be a tag.” 
Participant 6-M

3.1.5  Semantics and mood monitoring—Three participants raised concerns about 
the sensitivity of the daily Mood Zoom questions having noticed that their responses rarely 
changed.

“I almost answer the same things everyday like you know so I don’t, so I don’t feel 
like it was maybe accurately measuring me well enough.” Participant 10-M

One participant acknowledged that this might simply have reflected their current mood state.

“On the mood zoom I’d say I rarely went beyond the half way and I know as I 
scientist you use the full range but I suppose it was a reflection of my mood as 
well.” Participant 11-F

Some queried the mood descriptors we had used in the questionnaires as they felt that others 
may have been more relevant to them.

“Energetic, because sometimes, it’s, how sluggish do you feel? …I would like to 
take a few out like how I know for me have never changed from the whole time 
when you look at it, so that’s not monitoring a change for me.” Participant 15-F

“Sad and elated I think should be low and high because you can feel low and 
depressed but not feel sad if that makes sense. Equally, you can be high and full of 
ideas and running around like a mad thing but not necessarily feel elated…” 
Participant 8-M

Others (n = 6, 29%) raised semantic concerns stating that they would have preferred to have 
had greater explanation as to the meaning of the mood descriptors that were used.

“Elated… can mean happy but it can also mean manic and it can, you know and 
it’s, it’s kind of am I elated or do I just kind of feel normal and alright and positive 
and actually well then that’s not a zero on the scale, that’s probably you know and 
just sort working out the semantics of it.” Participant 13-F

“So what does 7 on the energetic scale feel like without any sort of measure of what 
that should be it’s kind of difficult to pick a number on that.” Participant 4-F

3.1.6  Enhancing clinical care—Eighteen participants (86%) thought that prospective 
mood and activity monitoring would be beneficial to enhance clinical decision making 
during routine clinical care, and make time spent with psychiatrists more efficient.

“I think they’d be able to make, … make objective decisions about medication 
changes … and frequency of interaction and yeah freq- …, yeah, yeah, … it’s, it’s 
… having, …, having … a little of our data about our moods, just health 
professionals would be able to make much better decisions I think” Participant 6-M

“I think if you’ve got an appointment with the psychiatrist and you’ve got like a 20 
minute appointment or something … … they could look at that data before they see 
you to get an overview whereas they’re assessing you on like how you are today.” 
Participant 1-F

Comments were made about how difficult it is to recall mood states and how monitoring can 
assist with this.

“I think it’s a really good thing to be looking at because I do find that if I’m not 
feeling well and then you don’t get an appointment for a week it’s so difficult to 
describe how you were feeling before and I think even with physical pain like as 
well as mood.” Participant 9-F

“If they could see at least I’ve been moving around and doing stuff during the week 
I think it would be useful for them. They have to take my word for it at the moment 
and although I won’t lie there are some days I say I’m sorry I haven’t got a clue 
what I did. I think it would be useful for them to get connected, involved in some 
sort of way. You might give them insight into why people react to what they’re 
doing.” Participant 16-M

Just one participant said that they did not want others to be able to access their data as they 
felt this may take some control away from them and they feared burdening others.

“I’ve never wanted anyone, I think if I, it might be useful but I don’t want it. If my 
mood is low or high I don’t want anyone to know until I’m ready to let them know 
and I know I should but I don’t want to put the pressure or the burden on to anyone 
else or friends…. I’ll choose when to seek help.” Participant 11-F

3.1.7  Tolerability and usability—Questionnaire responses revealed that once daily 
mood monitoring via the daily Mood Zoom questionnaires was found to be of little or no 
inconvenience (Mdn 1.5; Table 2). This contrasted with mood monitoring when mood 
samples were collected ten times daily during the ‘high-intensity’ phase of the study, where 
median reported convenience was ‘somewhat inconvenient’ (Mdn 3), a difference that was 
statistically significant (z = −2.31, P = 0.02, r = −0.39).

In addition, the majority of participants tolerated the study devices well. The GeneActiv 
watch (worn on the wrist and used to measure actigraphy, body temperature and light levels) 
and the Fitbit activity tracker were reported to be similarly tolerable (z = −0.57 P = 0.57). 
Free text questionnaire responses, provided further support for device usability and 
tolerability, although some participants commented on problems remembering to wear their 
technology or apply appropriate button-presses to activate certain functions.

“Unobtrusive – soon forgot I was wearing it.” – Participant 104-F

“Sometimes forgot to attach it to arm after shower before bed. Sometimes forgot to 
attach it to body in morning.” – Participant 21-M

Some participants noted that trackers did not capture all of their activities and thus, the data 
may not have been be entirely accurate (n = 6, 29%).

“It doesn’t register in certain circumstances – swimming (have to remove it), yoga, 
biking.” – Participant 108-F

Despite this, very few technical difficulties were reported with the devices over the study 
period.

3.1.8  Compliance—Compliance with both Mood Zoom daily questionnaires and True 
Colours weekly questionnaires was high (Table 3).

As reflected in the qualitative interviews and feedback questionnaires, compliance with 
activity monitoring devices was found to be relatively high throughout the 12-week study 
period. The GeneActiv watch was worn by participants for 96% of the time required. One 
participant lost their Fitbit within the first 2 weeks of the study. Of those that remained, 16

(80%) showed compliance of over 90% (defined as the percentage of days where at least 200 
steps were recorded); remaining participants showed compliance levels at 72%, 56%, 34% 
and 28%.

4  Discussion

Principal findings: mood monitoring and actigraphy was well accepted and tolerated by 
individuals with BD. Monitoring was reported by participants as having assisted them in the 
recognition of mood states. This awareness enabled them to link their mood with sleep, 
alcohol intake and exercise. In this way, insight appeared to be directly linked to behaviour 
change or behaviour reinforcement in many participants. Compliance with daily and weekly 
prompts to submit mood ratings was high (median 86% for Mood Zoom and 100% for True 
Colours). These findings are comparable to other studies that show compliance rates to 
remote mood and activity monitoring ranging from 75% [4] to 88% [15].

An increasing body of work suggests that interventions based on mobile or electronic health 
platforms are acceptable to patients [22]. However, the majority of previous studies have 
estimated acceptability from the frequency of use of the platform/intervention; study 
retention; response rates; and proportion of devices returned. We know of only four prior 
studies that have used qualitative methods to explore bipolar disorder patients’ experiences 
of mobile health technologies, despite the potential richness of data that this approach can 
contribute to the understanding of factors influencing patient engagement, including 
perceived utility. Two studies by Bardram et al. [17] and Frost et al. [18] reported that 
patients with BD had found the MONARCA system – a mobile application for personal 
monitoring in bipolar disorder – both usable and useful in disease management. However, no 
systematic qualitative analysis of patients’ experiences was conducted, and feedback was 
primarily relevant to the development of this specific application; there was little exploration 
of the broader influence of monitoring technologies on patients’ lives or disease 
management. Wenze, Armey and Miller [23] found that participants with BD (n = 14) who 
received automated feedback via a personal digital assistant for 2 weeks reported increased 
insight into mood patterns and behavioural changes (greater regularity in daily routines; 
more physical exercise) whilst Naslund et al. [24] found, working with patients with 
schizophrenia or BD (total n = 28) and using technology similar to the present study, that 
commercial wearable mobile health technologies were perceived as effective in supporting 
weight loss. However, these studies focussed on medication adherence and weight loss, 
respectively, and did not explore the impact of mobile monitoring on other aspects of illness 
management.

Our findings highlight important patient preferences for mood monitoring to be sufficiently 
flexible, comprehensive, and contextualized. Some individuals stressed that there was little 
opportunity to explain the context of individual mood ratings and that as a result some 
ratings might be misinterpreted as evidence of relapse. Feeling enabled to view and make 
sense of data was also clearly important to participants. In addition, patients largely 
preferred “low-friction” solutions to longitudinal monitoring of activity and sleep, where 
data collection required minimal input. A small number of participants expressed some 
unease about accessing and interpreting the data, and how monitoring might feed paranoia

during episodes of illness. Additionally, the potential for individuals to become overly 
preoccupied with monitored data was raised as a challenge. Given the relapsing and 
remitting nature of most major mental illness this is an area which warrants further 
exploration. The use of monitoring may also add to the stigma of mental illness by drawing 
attention to the user particularly if it requires the use of novel devices. More generally, there 
also needs to be consideration of the nature of personal data stored on such devices and the 
security of its storage.

Despite the concerns raised by participants, there was wide recognition of the potential for 
monitoring to facilitate earlier identification of mood changes or relapse, and enhance 
clinical care. At present, psychiatric assessment relies heavily on an anamnestic approach, 
which is prone to recall bias and dominated by current mood state. The ability for patients to 
monitor symptoms prospectively in real time presents an exciting opportunity to gain a more 
accurate and individualised insight into psychiatric illness. It also raises the possibility of 
more dynamic and flexible service provision and monitoring of individual treatment 
outcomes.

The forms of monitoring employed in our study were not generally seen to be inconvenient, 
although patients did indicate that completing our short (7-item) mood questionnaire at a 
rate of ten times a day could be intrusive. This raises questions about the frequency over 
which multi-day mood samples could be tolerably collected, particularly in longitudinal 
studies or interventions.

This is the first study to explore the tolerability of mood monitoring and actigraphy in 
people with BD. While mood monitoring apps for BD are widely available, few have been 
systematically assessed and download numbers have been used as a metric for tolerability 
[25]. The ubiquity of mobile technology makes it an attractive platform for the delivery of 
mood monitoring questionnaires while the sensors housed within smart phones and other 
portable or wearable devices are a further source of objective data. However, for these 
approaches to be successful in clinical research and practice, it is important to understand 
patients’ experience of using new technologies in this context as they need to be acceptable 
and tolerable.

The influence of current mood state on self-report was raised by participants; however they 
viewed frequent monitoring as assisting in reducing this potential bias, particularly in the 
recollection of previous mood states during clinical interactions. The possibility for 
monitoring to exacerbate underlying psychopathology is of concern and was raised by a 
couple of participants. We were unable to explore this objectively as none of the participants 
experienced a psychotic episode during the first three months of the study.

The study duration was relatively short, and the longer term acceptability of monitoring 
could not be explored. However, all participants were given the option to continue in the 
study for up to a year and 18/21 of them chose to do so, suggesting that approaches such as 
this may be tolerable for at least medium- to long-term data collection. The study involved a 
number of different devices and procedures and it is likely that those participants who chose 
to take part were more motivated to use these forms of monitoring, and as such may not be

representative of bipolar patients more generally. However, our purposive sampling allowed 
exploration of the experiences of participants who had withdrawn from the study or 
demonstrated low compliance with monitoring. Finally, our analysis team were of varied 
(both medical and non-medical) backgrounds, with different levels of involvement with 
participants during the study period, bringing varying perspectives to the analysis and 
reducing potential bias.

5  Conclusions

Mood and activity monitoring is well tolerated by individuals with BD; it is associated with 
greater understanding of the illness and facilitates more informed mood management. The 
ubiquity of mobile technology means that high frequency mood monitoring can be delivered 
more efficiently and less intrusively than has previously been possible. It is a powerful tool 
for self-management and the enhancement of clinical care. The increasing evidence base for 
other markers of mood such as geolocation, activity and vocal prosody in combination with 
machine learning approaches have the potential to transform the way in which mood is 
monitored, however, this will only be clinically useful if patients are prepared to tolerate it 
and perceive it to be helpful.
