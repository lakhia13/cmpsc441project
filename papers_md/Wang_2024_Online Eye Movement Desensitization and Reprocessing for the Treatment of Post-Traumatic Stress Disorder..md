Online Eye Movement Desensitization and 
Reprocessing for the Treatment of Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental illness associated with a high risk of suicide 
and self-injury, a poor prognosis, and difficult treatment.1 The reported prevalence of PTSD 
varies  between  different  countries  and  cultural  backgrounds.  The  lifetime  prevalence  in 
adults  in  the  United  States  is  6.1%1;  in  low-income  countries  like  those  in  Africa,  it  ranges 
from 30.6% to 37%;2 and in China it is 0.4%.3 Post-traumatic stress disorder is related to the 
occurrence and development of various mental diseases. It is more likely to be comorbid with 
other  mental  diseases,  and  the  prognosis  of  such  patients  is  worse.4,5 The  burden  of  PTSD 
on society is very high, and PTSD patients are faced with many occupational, financial, and 
interpersonal pressures.6

Current treatments for PTSD include psychotherapy, pharmaceuticals, and a combination of 
both. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is internationally rec-
ognized as a first-line treatment for PTSD and is a popular choice among psychotherapists 
and patients.7 However, traditional EMDR therapy has drawbacks, including high costs and 
travel expenses for patients. In China, long waiting times at major hospitals can further delay 
timely treatment, especially in economically underdeveloped areas. Eye movement desensi-
tization and reprocessing therapy is therefore rarely used in poor regions. Patients who live 
in these areas must travel by car or plane to receive EMDR treatment, adding to the financial 
cost and time. Fortunately, the rapid development of network technology means that online 
communication is becoming more convenient, thus greatly facilitating online diagnosis and 
treatment. Online EMDR therapy could therefore address the cost and time limitations associ-
ated with EMDR therapy for PTSD. 

Online EMDR therapy follows the same principles and steps as traditional EMDR therapy but 
is delivered online, often via video conference. This is different from computerized treatment, 
which is delivered without a therapist.8 Although there is currently only limited research on 
online EMDR therapy, surveys suggest that psychotherapists are conducting online psycho-
therapy  with  their  patients,9,10  especially  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Eye  movement 
desensitization and reprocessing associations around the world have drawn up guidelines 
for the practice of online EMDR therapy. The European EMDR Association suggests that only 
patients  who  have  previously  received  EMDR  therapy  from  the  therapist  and  who  have  a 
good relationship with them should receive online EMDR therapy.11 However, the Australian 
EMDR  Association  disagrees  with  this  stance.11  The  European  EMDR  Association  did  not 
recommend online EMDR treatment for patients with dissociative disorders or dissociative 
mechanisms, processing blocks and resistances, risk of suicide, or who have never received 
EMDR treatment.12

There  have  been  few  studies  published  on  online  EMDR.  Three  studies  examined  online 
EMDR combined with other treatments, but these were single-arm, non-blinded studies with 
small sample sizes. Although positive results were obtained, these studies require cautious 
interpretation. The earliest study was reported in 2013 in Australia. Spence et al13 conducted 
a single-arm, open-label trial involving 15 subjects diagnosed with PTSD. They were treated 
with network-based cognitive behavioral therapy combined with network-based EMDR for 
6 weeks. Four subjects withdrew, leaving 11 subjects who completed the study. After treat-
ment, 6 subjects no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and their depression and anxi-
ety also improved significantly after treatment. No serious adverse events were reported, thus

confirming  that  online  EMDR  treatment  was  feasible  and  relatively 
safe. Bongaerts et al14 tested the safety and effectiveness of online, 
trauma-focused  psychotherapy  in  6  patients  with  complex  PTSD. 
Prolonged exposure therapy, EMDR therapy, and exercise were used 
in  the  study.  All  6  subjects  completed  the  study.  During  the  treat-
ment period and a 1-month follow-up period, none of the subjects 
experienced any disease deterioration or adverse events. After treat-
ment, 4 subjects no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and 
remained in the follow-up. This study confirmed the relative safety of 
online  EMDR  treatment,  even  for  patients  with  complex  PTSD.  Eser 
Sağaltıcı et al15 conducted a study on online EMDR treatment in 16 
patients with PTSD caused by novel coronavirus, with 14 completing 
the study. Symptoms of trauma, depression, and anxiety were signifi-
cantly improved following treatment compared to before treatment.

Online  EMDR  therapy  is  now  performed  all  over  the  world,  and 
many EMDR associations have issued regulations regarding its use. 
Nevertheless, several challenges remain with this form of EMDR ther-
apy. Firstly, the online communication equipment and network may 
be unstable, leading to the interruption of treatment and thus affect-
ing the results. Fisher8 suggested having standby equipment ready to 
solve this problem. Secondly, it is risky for patients with unstable con-
ditions to use online EMDR therapy. The European EMDR Association 
advises that patients who are at risk of suicide should not undergo 
online EMDR therapy.11 Thirdly, the choice of site can be a problem 
for patient treatment. Online EMDR therapy requires a quiet space, 
and it may be difficult for some patients to find a place that meets 
this criterion. Patients have different attitudes toward online EMDR 
therapy. Those with place phobia and poor communication skills are 
more willing to receive online EMDR therapy, but those who are con-
cerned about privacy leakage and a poor network environment are 
reluctant to receive online EMDR therapy.10,16 

The development of online EMDR therapy makes it more convenient 
to obtain psychotherapy and can greatly reduce the treatment cost 
and  patient  time.  Online  EMDR  therapy  is  more  readily  accessible, 
and even patients in remote areas with poor medical resources can 
be  treated  at  a  lower  cost. This  is  important  for  achieving  an  equi-
table  allocation  of  medical  resources.  Currently,  however,  there  are 
no randomized controlled clinical trials with a high level of evidence 
regarding  the  benefits  of  online  EMDR  therapy  for  PTSD  patients. 
Moreover, there is still no uniform standard for the duration of online 
EMDR treatment, the time of each treatment, and how to ensure the 
safety of patients during treatment. In the future, it will be necessary 
to carry out randomized controlled clinical trials of online EMDR ther-
apy in PTSD patients to address these unknowns.
