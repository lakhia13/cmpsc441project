Summary This systematic review examines the con-
nections between eating disorders, body image distur-
bance, self-esteem, and emotion regulation in adults.
Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search
of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases
was conducted for articles published between 2010
and June 2024. Studies were included if they involved
participants aged 18 years and older, employed vali-
dated tools for measuring the variables, and presented
original research that speciﬁcally addressed these psy-
chological factors. Out of 1117 records, six studies
met the inclusion criteria, with mostly female samples
and a focus on body image, self-esteem, and emo-
tion regulation in relation to eating disorders. The
results indicate that body dissatisfaction is closely re-
lated to disordered eating behaviors, with a signiﬁcant
link to lower self-esteem and difﬁculties in emotion
regulation. Obese individuals with binge eating dis-
order (BED) were found to have more negative atti-
tudes toward obesity and greater levels of depression
than their non-BED counterparts. Women with bu-
limia nervosa showed higher emotion-focused cop-
ing, which is associated with low self-worth. Differ-
ences in gender were evident, with women exhibiting
greater vulnerability to body image dissatisfaction and
emotion dysregulation. The results show that treat-
ment for adults with eating disorders should focus
on the enhancement of self-esteem, the improvement

of body image perception, and the development of
adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Lastly, prac-
ticing self-compassion techniques in psychotherapy
could improve the treatment process for patients suf-
fering from eating disorders, low self-esteem, emotion
dysregulation, and body image disturbance. Future
studies should investigate these variables in various
non-Western cultural contexts for better understand-
ing and clinical intervention for the adult population.

Zusammenfassung
In der vorliegenden systema-
tischen Übersichtsarbeit werden die Verbindungen
zwischen Essstörungen, Störungen des Körperbildes,
Selbstwert und Emotionsregulation bei Erwachsenen
dargelegt. Nach den PRISMA-Leitlinien (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Me-
ta-Analyses) wurde eine systematische Suche nach
zwischen 2010 und Juni 2024 publizierten Artikeln
in den Datenbanken PubMed, Scopus und Web of
Science durchgeführt. Studien wurden dann einbezo-
gen, wenn die Teilnehmer:innen mindestens 18 Jahre
alt waren, validierte Instrumente zur Messung der
Variablen eingesetzt und Original-Forschungsergeb-
nisse dieser psychologischen Faktoren präsentiert
wurden. Von 1117 identiﬁzierten Studienerfüllten
sechs die Einschlusskriterien. Meist handelte es sich
um weibliche Stichproben und einen Fokus auf Kör-
perbild, Selbstwert und emotionaler Regulation im
Zusammenhang mit Essstörungen. Die Ergebnisse
zeigen, dass Unzufriedenheit mit dem Körper in
enger Beziehung zu gestörtem Essverhalten steht,

dabei besteht ein signiﬁkanter Zusammenhang mit
niedrigerem Selbstwert und Schwierigkeiten bei der
emotionalen Regulation. Bei adipösen Personen mit
Binge Eating Störung („binge eating disorder“, BED)
fanden sich mehr negative Haltungen zu Adipositas
und ein höheres Niveau an Depression im Vergleich
zu entsprechenden Personen ohne BED. Frauen mit
Bulimia nervosa zeigten höhere emotionsfokussierte
Bewältigungsstrategien, was mit niedrigem Selbstwert
einhergeht. Unterschiede beim Geschlecht waren evi-
dent, Frauen wiesen eine größere Vulnerabilität für
Unzufriedenheit mit dem Körperbild und emotionale
Dysregulation auf. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die
Therapie für Erwachsene mit Essstörungen den Fo-
kus auf die Erhöhung des Selbstwerts, Verbesserung
der Körperbildwahrnehmung und Entwicklung von
adaptiven emotionalen Regulationsstrategien legen
sollte. Schließlich kann das Praktizieren von Selbst-
mitgefühlstechniken in der Psychotherapie den Be-
handlungsprozess für Patienten mit Essstörungen,
niedrigem Selbstwert, emotionaler Dysregulation und
Störung des Körperbildes verbessern. In zukünfti-
gen Studien sollten diese Variablen in verschiedenen
nichtwestlichen kulturellen Kontexten mit dem Ziel
eines besseren Verständnisses und besserer klinischer
Interventionen für die erwachsene Bevölkerung un-
tersucht werden.

Introduction

Eating disorders are complicated and varied psycho-
logical illnesses with potentially disastrous effects on
individuals’ mental and physical health [59]. Profound
disturbances in eating habits and a strong preoccupa-
tion with body weight and shape can lead to disorders
such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge
eating disorder, causing signiﬁcant disease and mor-
tality [21, 33]. Individuals suffering from anorexia ner-
vosa deliberately starve themselves and have a strong
fear of gaining weight, which can be intensely harmful
[43, 48]. This leads to severe malnutrition and failure
of many organs, which may be life-threatening [42,
70]. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by repeated pe-
riods of excessive eating, followed by actions such as
vomiting or excessive activity to compensate for binge
eating [20, 26, 60]. These behaviors may result in med-
ical complications [20, 70]. Binge eating disorder, the
most widespread eating disorder, is characterized by
repeated periods of excessive eating without subse-
quent compensatory actions, often leading to obesity
and its relative comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes
and cardiovascular disease [2, 63]. The connection
between eating disorders and body image is well es-
tablished, with a poor body image often acting as both
a precursor and a perpetrator of disordered eating
habits [4, 30]. Body image encompasses an individ-

review

ual’s views, thoughts, and emotions about their phys-
ical appearance. Negative body image is discontent
with one’s body size, shape, or weight [23, 64]. Feelings
of discontentment may result in detrimental actions
focused on modifying physical appearance, which in
turn can provoke or intensify symptoms of eating dis-
orders [62, 68]. Furthermore, the negative psycho-
logical consequences of having a poor body image
go beyond just having an eating disorder. A poor
body image is closely linked to experiencing emo-
tional discomfort, such as sadness, anxiety, and a lack
of self-worth [35, 50, 54]. Emotions and their manage-
ment are crucial in the formation and maintenance of
eating disorders.
Individuals with disordered eating
habits often have difﬁculty controlling their emotions
and resort to utilizing food-related actions as a means
of dealing with unpleasant feelings like stress, depres-
sion, or anger [14, 53]. Emotional dysregulation has
a role in both the development and continuation of
eating disorders by strengthening unhealthy ways of
dealing with emotions [40, 46]. Low self-esteem is
another key factor intertwined with body image and
emotion regulation in the context of eating disorders.
It inﬂuences and is inﬂuenced by the other variables,
creating a feedback loop that can exacerbate disor-
dered eating behaviors [13]. Individuals with low self-
esteem are more vulnerable to the effects of negative
body image and emotional distress, which can lead to
the adoption of harmful eating behaviors as a means
of managing these feelings [15, 24]. This complex
interplay highlights the need for comprehensive in-
terventions that address all these factors to treat and
prevent eating disorders effectively [38, 52, 74]. While
extensive research has examined the relationship be-
tween eating disorders and these psychological vari-
ables in adolescents [27, 39, 56, 57, 61], less attention
has been paid to adults. Existing studies often focus
on individual factors, such as the connection between
eating disorders and body image [67] or body image
and self-esteem [16, 34], without considering the in-
terconnectedness of all these variables within adult
populations.

Method

Study protocol

This systematic review followed a structured approach
based on the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines
(Fig. 1), focusing on exploring the relationships be-
tween eating disorders, body image, emotion regula-
tion, and self-esteem in adults [49]. The study proto-
col was designed to identify, evaluate, and synthesize
research that examined the connections between
these psychological factors in adult populations. The
review speciﬁcally targeted studies involving indi-
viduals aged 18 years and older, excluding research
focused on adolescents. A systematic search was con-

ducted across three databases: PubMed, Scopus, and
Web of Science. A standardized set of search terms
was used across all three databases. Keywords re-
lated to “body image,” “emotional regulation,” “eating
disorders,” and “self-esteem” were used to capture rel-
evant studies published between 2010 and June 2024
(Table 1). The same core terms and time limits were
applied to ensure methodological consistency across
the databases. The protocol of this review is registered
in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024562669).

Eligibility criteria

The eligibility criteria for this systematic review were
established to ensure the inclusion of studies that
speciﬁcally addressed the relationships between eat-
ing disorders, body image, emotion regulation, and
self-esteem in adult populations. The criteria applied
included:

a) Studies must involve adult participants aged 18 years
and older. Research focusing exclusively on adoles-
cents or children was excluded to maintain a clear
focus on adult populations.

b) Included studies must investigate the relation be-
tween eating disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bu-
limia nervosa, binge eating disorder, obesity), body
image disturbances, and at least one of the follow-
ing psychological factors: emotion regulation or
self-esteem with consideration of emotions, or self-
esteem. Studies involving both clinical populations
(those diagnosed with eating disorders) and non-
clinical populations (those exhibiting dysfunctional
eating habits without a formal diagnosis) were in-
cluded.

c) Only original research articles, including quantita-
tive, qualitative, and mixed methods studies, were
considered.

d) Studies published between 2010 and June 2024 were

eligible for inclusion.

e) Only studies published in English were included to
ensure clarity and consistency in data interpreta-
tion. Exclusion criteria were also applied to reﬁne
the selection: (i) non-adult populations; (ii) stud-
ies that did not include eating disorders and did
not provide a clear and speciﬁc focus on body im-
age, together with either emotionregulation or self-
esteem.

A “clear and speciﬁc focus” was operationalized as
the explicit assessment or measurement of body im-
age disturbance in combination with validated scales
measuring either emotional regulation (such as emo-
tion regulation questionnaires, alexithymia scales,
emotional awareness scales) or self-esteem (such as
the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, self-worth or self-
conﬁdence measures). Studies that mentioned these
constructs superﬁcially, without a dedicated method-
ology or validated assessments, were considered in-
sufﬁciently focused and therefore excluded.

Study selection

After the initial search, records from the database
searches were imported into reference management
software, where duplicates were removed using the
reference management software Zotero (v. 6.0.26),
(Corporation for Digital Scholarship, Vienna, VA,
USA). This resulted in a total of 890 articles. The
screening process was conducted in two stages by
two independent reviewers (M.A. and M.S.R). The
titles and abstracts of the 890 records were reviewed

to assess their relevance to the objectives of this re-
view. Studies were excluded at this stage if they did
not meet the inclusion criteria. This stage resulted
in the exclusion of 779 articles. The remaining 111
articles were subjected to a full-text review.
In this
phase, articles were thoroughly evaluated according
to the predeﬁned eligibility criteria. Two researchers
independently reviewed all studies and discussed the
inclusion and exclusion of each study. A third re-
viewer acted as a referee in cases of disagreement.
Inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa) was not for-
mally calculated due to resource constraints and the
small number of included studies. However, disagree-
ments were minimal, and consensus was reached
through detailed discussion between reviewers and
referee involvement. Individual work on syntax and
bias prevention was carried out to ensure the in-
tegrity of the review process. Articles were excluded
for reasons such as focusing on adolescent popula-
tions (34 articles), not adequately addressing body
image evaluation (24 articles), insufﬁcient focus on
emotional factors (22 articles), or lacking convinc-

review

ing focus on self-esteem (25 articles). This rigorous
process resulted in the ﬁnal inclusion of six studies.

Synthesis and analysis of data

The data synthesis involved a narrative approach due
to the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms
of their methodologies, populations, and measured
outcomes. The results were organized into thematic
categories aligned with the study’s objectives: eat-
ing disorders, body image, emotion regulation, self-
esteem, gender differences. A qualitative synthesis in-
tegrated ﬁndings across studies, focusing on identify-
ing common patterns and themes. Where applicable,
quantitative data were also summarized, particularly
when comparing the prevalence and severity of eating
disorders across different populations. The synthesis
aimed to understand the interrelations between the
core variables of interest.

Result

Study characteristics

The six studies included in this review varied in their
aims, methodologies, and geographic locations, pro-
viding a broad perspective on the interconnections
between eating disorders, body image, emotion reg-
ulation, and self-esteem. All studies were published
between 2010 and June 2024 and focused on adult
populations, with a mix of both clinical and commu-
nity samples. The tools used in these studies were
well-established in the ﬁeld,
including the Eating
Disorder Examination (EDE), Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Scale (RSES), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
among others (see Table 2). The results consistently
highlighted signiﬁcant associations between the core
variables of interest, with variations observed across
different Western geographic contexts, including the
United States, Norway, Canada, and Germany.

Sample characteristics

The participants’ mean ages ranged from early adult-
hood (20.2 years) to middle adulthood (49.66 years).
The gender distribution was skewed toward females,
with all studies either predominantly or exclusively in-
cluding women. Ethnicity was reported in some stud-
ies, with diverse populations including White, African
American, Hispanic, and Asian American participants.
This allowed for an examination of cultural differences
in the manifestation and perception of body image
and eating disorders (see Table 3).

ing empirical studies across qualitative, quantitative,
and mixed methods research [28]. The MMAT was
chosen for its comprehensive approach, enabling
standardized assessments across different study de-
signs (Table 4). Common sources of bias included
potential selection bias, particularly in studies with
self-selected samples from clinical or community set-
tings, and measurement bias in studies using self-
report questionnaires prone to social desirability bias.
Despite these concerns, the overall quality of the stud-
ies was considered high, with most scoring well across
the MMAT criteria. Including validated measurement
tools and rigorous statistical analyses helped miti-
gate some inherent biases. Each study was evaluated
according to criteria relevant to its design category,
with quantitative descriptive studies assessed for clar-
ity in research questions, sampling strategy, sample
representativeness, measurement tool adequacy, and
statistical analysis suitability. Quantitative nonran-
domized studies were evaluated for group compa-
rability, control of confounding variables, and the
appropriateness of the intervention or exposure. Two
researchers independently reviewed all studies and
discussed all the included and excluded studies.

Eating disorders

This review examined six studies that investigated dif-
ferent eating disorders, with a particular emphasis
on binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa
(BN). It was found that individuals with BED showed
more severe eating disorder pathology compared to
those without BED (Fig. 2). This was demonstrated
by the increased scores on the subscales of the Eating
Disorder Examination (EDE), which included dietary
restraint, eating concern, weight concern, and shape
concern [5]. Similarly, in another study, women diag-
nosed with BN displayed signiﬁcantly higher levels of
concern across all EDE subscales compared to con-
trols, suggesting a more pronounced manifestation
of disordered eating behaviors [71]. In addition, the
study examined the connection between body dissat-
isfaction and disordered eating. The results revealed
that body dissatisfaction had an indirect impact on
disordered eating behaviors by affecting self-esteem
and depression levels [7]. The studies collectively em-
phasize the connection between disordered eating be-
haviors, whether in BED or BN, and psychological fac-
tors. These disorders are inﬂuenced by factors such as
low self-esteem, depression, and body image distur-
bance, which contribute to their severity [10, 32].

across all studies, especially in relation to their im-

presence of severe body image disturbances within
this particular group [37]. The study examined the
idea of body image ﬂexibility, which refers to the
capacity to embrace negative thoughts about one’s
body. The results revealed (Fig. 3) a correlation be-
tween higher BMI and lower body image ﬂexibility,
leading to increased levels of body dissatisfaction and

disordered eating behaviors [32].
In addition, it is
worth noting that body esteem, speciﬁcally weight
satisfaction, has been found to have a signiﬁcant cor-
relation with sexual dissatisfaction and dissociative
experiences during sex. This highlights the impor-
tant role that body image plays in both psychological
and sexual well-being [10]. The studies collectively

showed that body dissatisfaction and related con-
cerns are not only common in individuals with eating
disorders but also play a crucial role in driving these
disorders. In addition, research consistently supports
the link between body image and eating disorders.
Body dissatisfaction often leads to behaviors such as
restricted eating, compensatory actions, and binge
eating. This connection is especially prevalent in in-
dividuals with higher BMI or those diagnosed with
BED and BN [5, 71].

Emotion

Emotionl regulation, or its lack thereof, plays a signif-
icant role in the development of eating disorders and
body image issues (Fig. 4). Depression, a recurring
theme, has been found to directly impact binge eat-

ing, as individuals turn to disordered eating behaviors
as a way to cope with negative emotions [7]. Women
with BN displayed emotional dysregulation through
their use of coping strategies focused on emotions,
such as seeking escape and isolating themselves so-
cially. These behaviors were found to be signiﬁcantly
more prominent compared to the control group [71].
Self-compassion was found to play a crucial role in
mitigating the negative emotional impacts of higher
BMI, thus acting as a protective factor in the rela-
tionship between BMI and eating disorder pathology

emotional stress, dissociative experiences, and binge
eating in the context of sexual activities [10]. These
studies emphasize the signiﬁcance of emotion regu-
lation in the development and persistence of eating
disorders and body image concerns.

restrained eating [7]. On the other hand, men seemed
to adopt various coping strategies when faced with
depressive symptoms, such as turning to alcohol in-
stead of restricting their eating habits [5]. The studies
also emphasized the importance of self-compassion
in inﬂuencing the connection between BMI and eat-
ing disorder pathology in women. This suggests that
interventions aimed at boosting self-compassion may
have a greater impact on women’s response to treat-
ment [32].

Secondary outcomes

The six included studies also offered a further under-
standing of the relationship between psychological
factors and eating disorders. As an example, the
study found that weight bias plays a signiﬁcant role
in causing psychological distress and disordered eat-
ing behaviors, especially in individuals with BED [5].
Another secondary outcome examined was the role
of dissociation during sexual activities. The ﬁndings
indicate that women who use dissociation as a cop-
ing mechanism may be more prone to binge eating
and sexual dissatisfaction [10]. The studies also em-
phasized the signiﬁcance of considering cultural and
racial differences in the treatment of eating disorders.
African American participants reported lower levels
of weight bias compared to their White counterparts,
suggesting that cultural factors may play a role in the
internalization of body image concerns [37]. These
secondary outcomes indicate that a comprehensive
treatment approach, which takes into account these
additional psychological and sociocultural
factors,
may be essential for enhancing outcomes in individ-
uals with eating disorders.

Self-Esteem

Self-esteem played a crucial role in connecting body
image, emotions, and eating disorders (Fig. 5). Re-
search has shown a clear connection between low self-
esteem and behaviors such as compensatory eating,
restrained eating, and binge eating. This connection
is especially prevalent among women [7]. In individ-
uals with BED who are overweight, having low self-
esteem was found to be linked to feeling more dissat-
isﬁed with their body image. This dissatisfaction can
contribute to the continuation of disordered eating
behavior [37]. The studies also found that self-com-
passion may be more important than self-esteem in
preventing negative effects associated with body im-
age and eating disorders. This suggests that it may
be beneﬁcial to focus on promoting self-compassion
rather than traditional self-esteem interventions [32].
Furthermore, in the case of women with BN, having
low self-esteem was found to be a predictor of rely-
ing on emotion-oriented coping behaviors. It is worth
noting that these coping mechanisms are generally
less effective in managing stress and can even worsen
symptoms of eating disorders [71]. These ﬁndings
highlight the importance of self-esteem and related
constructs, such as self-compassion, in the psycho-
logical well-being of individuals with eating disorders.
It suggests that enhancing these factors may result in
more positive treatment outcomes.

Gender differences

Studies have found that women may be more suscep-
tible to the negative effects of body image dissatis-
faction and emotional dysregulation on eating disor-
ders. Research has shown that there are differences
in how men and women experience body dissatisfac-
tion, self-esteem, and symptoms of depression. These
differences can contribute to the development of dis-
ordered eating behaviors, such as binge eating and

Discussion

Overview of key ﬁndings

The ﬁndings of this systematic review highlight the
complex interconnections of eating disorders, body
image, emotion regulation, and self-esteem in adult
populations. These elements do not operate in iso-
lation; they interact in signiﬁcant ways that can in-
ﬂuence disordered eating. Notably, these interactions
differed between clinical and nonclinical populations.
Clinical populations consistently showed stronger as-
sociations between severe body dissatisfaction, emo-
tional dysregulation, and lower self-esteem with clin-
ical eating disorder diagnoses such as BED and BN.
Nonclinical samples primarily showed associations
between body dissatisfaction, subclinical disordered
eating behaviors, and moderate emotional distress,
suggesting differences in severity and mechanisms be-
tween clinical and nonclinical groups The six included
studies demonstrate that factors such as feelings of
dissatisfaction with one’s body, low self-esteem, and
difﬁculty regulating emotions are signiﬁcant contrib-
utors to disordered eating behaviors in adults. This
connection is particularly important because it sug-
gests that underlying psychological factors are crucial
in understanding how eating disorders develop and
persist. Such evidence supports recent research that
focuses on the multifaceted nature of eating disor-
ders, where psychological factors like body image
and self-worth play critical roles in their develop-
ment and continuation [25, 55]. This paper, therefore,
underlines the importance of gaining a deeper under-
standing of the relationships and dynamics among the
aforementioned factors, especially in adult popula-
tions that have been relatively overlooked in this area.
This interrelation is further supported by evidence,
noting that adults with eating disorders often display
maladaptive perfectionism, highlighting a tendency
to equate self-worth with body shape and weight,
which increases vulnerability to these disorders. The
role of negative affect, including feelings of sadness
and anxiety, in exacerbating body dissatisfaction and
poor self-esteem has been widely recognized as a risk
factor for the onset of disordered eating behaviors.
These ﬁndings point to the multifaceted etiology of
eating disorders, highlighting the need for a more
holistic approach to understanding and treating these
complex conditions [11, 17, 69].

The role of body image dissatisfaction

One important ﬁnding to be discussed is the impact
of body image dissatisfaction on the development and
severity of eating disorders. Individuals with BED and
BN consistently displayed elevated levels of weight
and shape concerns, which were strongly associated
with their eating pathology. This aligns with theoret-
ical perspectives on eating disorders, suggesting that

body dissatisfaction can trigger unhealthy behaviors
such as binge eating and compensatory actions [37,
Interestingly, evidence also suggests that body

image dissatisfaction is inﬂuenced by factors such as
self-esteem and depression, particularly in women [7].
This implies that interventions that solely target body
dissatisfaction may not be enough; instead, a more
comprehensive approach that considers the psycho-
logical dimensions is necessary [51]. Body dissatisfac-
tion may act as both a precursor and a consequence
of eating disorders, suggesting a cyclical relationship
that continues to maintain and exacerbate disordered
eating. For this reason, enhancing body image ﬂex-
ibility—or the ability to accept and manage negative
body-related thoughts—has been proposed as a pro-
tective factor against the development of eating dis-
orders [9, 58, 72]. This perspective underscores the
necessity of integrating therapeutic interventions that
address not only body dissatisfaction but also enhance
cognitive ﬂexibility and emotional resilience to dis-
rupt the cycle of disordered eating and body image
issues effectively.

Emotional dysregulation and eating disorders

The studies included in this review place signiﬁcant
emphasis on the role of emotion regulation, specif-
ically the dysregulation of emotions and the link be-
tween emotional distress, such as depression, and dis-
ordered eating behaviors, especially in women. It is
observed that some women may turn to dieting or
binge eating as strategies to cope with their emotions
[7]. There has been a clear link between negative emo-
tional states, such as anxiety and depression, and an
increase in binge eating episodes [36, 41]. Moreover,
the study emphasized the importance of self-compas-
sion in reducing the negative emotional impacts of
higher BMI and body image dissatisfaction. By cul-
tivating a compassionate attitude toward oneself, in-
dividuals may be able to decrease the risk of devel-
oping eating disorders [32]. The positive impact of
self-compassion aligns with previous research show-
ing its capacity to reduce the severity of eating disor-
der symptoms and enhance emotional well-being [6,
32]. Emotional dysregulation, especially when involv-
ing maladaptive strategies like emotional suppression
and avoidance, has been identiﬁed as a key factor in
both the development and persistence of eating dis-
orders. In this context, mindfulness-based interven-
tions have emerged as effective methods for helping
individuals develop healthier emotion regulation, fos-
tering awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of
emotions, and reducing disordered eating behaviors
[31, 40, 66].

Self-esteem and self-compassion

Turning to the role of self-esteem, it is evident that
self-esteem plays a crucial part in the development of

review

eating disorders, as research has consistently demon-
strated.
The ﬁndings indicate that interventions
focused on enhancing self-esteem may be highly
beneﬁcial
in preventing and treating eating disor-
ders, especially in women who often use emotion-
focused coping strategies [71]. The association be-
tween low self-esteem and disordered eating has been
extensively documented, with studies showing that
individuals with low self-esteem are more likely to en-
gage in behaviors such as binge eating and purging to
deal with feelings of inadequacy [29, 73]. However, the
review also highlights the potential beneﬁts of self-
compassion compared to self-esteem in protecting
against the negative psychological effects related to
body image and eating disorders. This suggests a pos-
sible shift in therapeutic focus [32]. Further research
suggests that self-compassion may provide greater
resilience against the internalization of negative body
image and eating disorder symptoms, indicating its
signiﬁcance alongside self-esteem [44]. Building self-
esteem has been associated with long-term improve-
ments in mental health and reductions in disordered
eating behaviors.
In terms of intervention strate-
gies, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has
shown efﬁcacy in improving self-esteem and reduc-
ing body dissatisfaction. On the other hand, self-
compassion-based interventions may contribute to
increased self-esteem and reductions in maladap-
tive perfectionism and body dissatisfaction [18, 19].
These therapeutic approaches illustrate the interplay
between self-compassion and self-esteem, demon-
strating how fostering self-compassion can mitigate
risk factors associated with disordered eating behav-
iors, thereby providing a more resilient self-concept.

Gender differences and sociocultural factors

Gender differences are a crucial factor in this review,
as ﬁndings indicate that women tend to be more im-
pacted by body image dissatisfaction and emotional
distress, which can lead to more severe eating disor-
der behaviors. The ﬁndings suggest that interventions
for speciﬁc genders are essential in addressing the dis-
tinct psychological challenges that women face con-
cerning body image and eating disorders [5, 7]. This
observation aligns with existing research that empha-
sizes how societal pressures related to body image can
differ by gender. Women, in particular, are subjected
to more intense scrutiny, leading to higher levels of
body dissatisfaction and a greater risk of developing
eating disorders [45, 65]. Women also often employ
emotion-focused coping mechanisms, which can ex-
acerbate these conditions. Consequently, the impor-
tance of gender-sensitive therapeutic approaches be-
comes clear [22]. While women are more frequently
diagnosed with eating disorders, emerging research
indicates that men are also affected by body dissatis-
faction and disordered eating, although often in differ-
ent forms, such as a focus on muscularity. Gendered

social pressures, including the idealization of slimness
for women and muscularity for men, can intensify
body dissatisfaction and drive unhealthy eating and
exercise habits. Therefore, developing a gender-sensi-
tive approach is crucial for recognizing and effectively
addressing the diverse ways body dissatisfaction man-
ifests [12, 25, 47]. This review highlights the impor-
tance of considering the interconnected psychological
factors of body image, self-esteem, and emotion regu-
lation when treating eating disorders in adults. Future
studies should prioritize the exploration of these vari-
ables in culturally diverse contexts and employ vari-
ous research methodologies. This broader approach
will enhance understanding and enable more effec-
tive treatment of eating disorders in adult populations.
Additionally, incorporating techniques to strengthen
self-compassion, emotion regulation, and body im-
age perception into therapies and clinical practices
may improve outcomes for individuals dealing with
eating disorders [8]. Overall, the ﬁndings suggest that
a holistic approach to treatment is crucial for effec-
tively managing eating disorders in adults. Such an
approach should include interventions that focus on
enhancing self-esteem, regulating emotions, and im-
proving body image perception.

Limitations and future directions

This systematic review provides insights into the com-
plex interplay between body image, self-esteem, emo-
tion regulation, and eating disorders in adult popula-
tions. However, it is important to acknowledge several
limitations. Firstly, all the included studies predomi-
nantly featured Western samples, which raises ques-
tions about the generalizability of the ﬁndings to non-
Western cultures. The existing research may not fully
capture how body image, self-esteem, and emotion
regulation manifest in diverse cultural settings, espe-
cially in collectivistic societies where the understand-
ing of body ideals and emotion regulation may dif-
fer signiﬁcantly from Western norms. Consequently,
future studies should aim to explore these variables
in more culturally diverse populations, considering
cross-cultural differences and including non-Western
perspectives to provide a more comprehensive under-
standing of eating disorders in adulthood. Addition-
ally, most of the studies included in this review had
a predominance of female participants, which limits
the conclusions that can be drawn about gender dif-
ferences. Although the results indicate a signiﬁcant
impact of body image dissatisfaction and emotional
dysregulation on women, more research is needed
to examine how these factors affect men, especially
considering the increasing prevalence of disordered
eating and body dissatisfaction among males. A fur-
ther limitation is that very few of the included studies
examined anorexia nervosa, so we cannot conclude
speciﬁcally about this disorder. Future studies should
adopt a balanced gender representation and investi-

gate the distinct experiences and challenges faced by
both men and women with eating disorders, as well
as those who identify outside the gender binary.

Conclusion

This systematic review highlights the interdependence
between eating disorders, body image, emotions, and
self-esteem in adults.
It emphasizes the intercon-
nection of these variables and their substantial inﬂu-
ence on the development and maintenance of disor-
dered eating behaviors. Body image dissatisfaction
and poor self-esteem may have a substantial inﬂu-
ence, resulting in the adoption of unhealthy eating
patterns. Emotional dysregulation exacerbates these
issues, leading people to rely on maladaptive coping
strategies such as excessive eating or severe dietary
restrictions. The results suggest that successful treat-
ment options should entail more than just address-
ing eating behaviors. An all-encompassing strategy
is required, which simultaneously tackles self-esteem,
emotional well-being, and body image perception. In-
tegrating self-compassion into treatment may provide
further beneﬁts by helping clients mitigate the nega-
tive psychological consequences associated with eat-
ing disorders. The study emphasizes the need for tai-
loring therapies to address gender-speciﬁc difﬁculties
since women seem to be more susceptible to the ad-
verse effects of body image worries and mental dis-
comfort. The gender disparity underscores the need
for customizing therapy methods to account for the
unique encounters of males and females.
