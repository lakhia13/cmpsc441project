Abstract

For most adults, sleep is a dyadic behavior. Only recently have studies explored the dynamic 
association between sleep and relationship functioning among bedpartners. The current study is 
the first to examine bidirectional associations between changes in insomnia and changes in marital 
quality over time, in the context of a marital therapy trial. Among husbands, improvements in 
marital satisfaction were associated with a 36% decreased risk of insomnia at follow-up. 
Regarding the reverse direction, counter-intuitively, wife baseline insomnia was associated with 
improvements in husbands’ marital satisfaction, but only among the non-treatment seeking 
comparison group. Results are discussed in terms of implications for sleep and marital therapy, 
and suggest that improving sleep may be an added benefit of improving the marital relationship.

Introduction

Sleep is a critically important health behavior, reliably and prospectively associated with 
diverse indicators of health outcomes including general well-being, risk for psychiatric 
disorders, and risk for chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases 
(Knutson, 2010; Troxel et al., 2010). A similarly robust body of research has found 
prospective associations between the quality of close relationships—in particular, marital or 
intimate partner relationships—and a host of mental and physical health outcomes (Gallo et 
al., 2003; Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser, 2002; Robles, 2014). Among health 
behaviors, sleep is uniquely associated with couple functioning because it typically occurs 
within a shared couple context. Indeed, emerging research has begun to highlight the 
interdependent nature of couple sleep (Gunn, Buysse, Hasler, Begley, & Troxel, 2015; 
Meadows, Arber, Venn, Hislop, & Stanley, 2009). However, sleep science has traditionally 
assessed sleep at the level of the individual, largely neglecting the influence of the partner 
and the quality of the bedpartners’ relationship (Troxel, Robles, Hall, & Buysse, 2007). In 
the present study, we seek to explore sleep in a dyadic context by exploring the association 
between sleep and relationship quality using a longitudinal approach that allows for an

examination of whether sleep predicts marital quality, whether marital quality predicts sleep, 
or whether these relationships are bidirectional.

Until recently, there has been scant research on the impact of close relationships on sleep. 
However, there are likely to be dynamic and bidirectional associations between sleep and 
relationship quality, via psychological, behavioral, and physiological pathways (Troxel et al., 
2007). For instance, given known effects of sleep disruption on mood, frustration tolerance, 
and cognitive functioning (Robles, Slatcher, Trombello, & McGinn, 2014), a poor night of 
sleep can lead to greater marital strife the next day. The reverse direction is also plausible—
feelings of safety and security which are largely derived from close interpersonal 
connections (Feeney & Kirkpatrick, 1996), are considered critical for optimizing restorative 
and high quality sleep by facilitating down-regulation of physiological and emotional 
arousal. In contrast, insecurity in close relationships are purported to increase sleep 
disturbance by increasing vigilance and anxiety, and upregulating arousal (Dahl, 1996). Such 
feelings of safety and security (or its absence) are likely to be particularly important for 
optimizing sleep quality in the context of couple relationships. In fact, several studies have 
shown that insecurity in close relationships (i.e., attachment anxiety)is an independent 
correlate of poor subjective sleep quality and decreased sleep depth (as measured by 
polysomnography) in both women and men (Carmichael & Reis, 2005; Hicks & Diamond, 
2011; Scharfe & Eldredge, 2001; Sloan, Maunder, Hunter, & Moldofsky, 2007; Troxel et al., 
2007; Verdecias, Jean-Louis, Zizi, Casimir, & Browne, 2009). However, most of the extant 
research on relationship quality and sleep has utilized cross-sectional designs and has not 
considered the potential for bidirectional associations that unfold over time.

Among the handful of studies that have employed longitudinal designs, the findings support 
the contention that sleep and relationship quality are bidirectional (Gordon & Chen, 2013; 
Hasler & Troxel, 2010; Kane, Slatcher, Reynolds, Repetti, & Robles, 2014; Rauer, Kelly, 
Buckhalt, & El-Sheikh, 2010); however, the direction of effects may be gender-dependent. 
For instance, in a 10-day daily experience study of heterosexual cohabitating couples, Hasler 
and Troxel (2010) found that higher levels of female relationship satisfaction during the day 
predicted better sleep for both herself and her partner that night. However, for males, better 
sleep at night predicted higher male (but not female) relationship satisfaction the next day. 
Similarly, Kane and colleagues (2014) found that greater self-disclosure predicted better 
sleep for wives, but not for husbands. Finally, in a large community sample of 241 couples, 
Rauer and colleagues (2010) investigated the longitudinal association between psychological 
abuse and subjective sleep quality over a 3-year follow-up period. The findings showed that 
for both men and women, higher initial levels of psychological abuse and increases in 
psychological abuse over time predicted greater sleep problems at the 3-year follow-up. 
However, the analyses were stratified by sex rather than being examined dyadically, which 
precludes an examination of whether cross-partner effects were present, as observed in the 
Hasler and Troxel (2010) study.

Collectively, these findings provide support for the contention that relationship quality and 
sleep quality are reciprocally linked, with some evidence that associations may be gender-
dependent. However, there is still a scarcity of data on how these processes unfold over time. 
Moreover, the existing literature involves observational studies using healthy, convenience

samples of couples, which may result in a restriction of range in marital quality. 
Observational designs may be less informative for understanding whether intervening on 
sleep or relationship quality has an impact on the other behavior. A handful of studies have 
shown that treating a sleep disorder (i.e., obstructive sleep apnea) is associated with 
improvements in bedpartner sleep and the couples’ relationship functioning (as reviewed in 
Troxel et al., 2007). To our knowledge, however, no prior research has examined the impact 
of a relationship intervention on sleep in couples.

The current study builds on the scant existing research by being the first to study the 
bidirectional associations between sleep and relationship as they unfold over time in a 
sample of distressed couples assigned to a marital therapy intervention and a comparison 
sample of non-distressed couples who did not receive the marital intervention. By utilizing 
an intervention design that included both distressed and non-distressed couples, our study 
may provide a more robust test of the interface between relationship functioning and sleep. 
By increasing variability in both constructs and by intervening on one of the key study 
constructs, we will not only examine these constructs without the restriction of range that 
limits previous research, but we may also observe whether improvements in relationship 
quality can also improve sleep. Recognizing the interdependence of sleep and relationship 
functioning within couples, we utilized actor-partner interdependence models to examine 
how relationship quality affects one’s own sleep and one’s partner’s sleep over time. We also 
examined how earlier actor and partner sleep influences changes in relationship quality over 
time. Specifically, we examined whether changes in marital satisfaction over a 3-month 
follow-up period are associated with initial (i.e., baseline) insomnia while statistically 
adjusting for other factors which are known to covary with insomnia and/or relationship 
functioning, including participant age, number of children1 in the home, depressive 
symptoms, and body mass index (BMI). Finally, based on Hasler and Troxel’s findings 
which showed gender-dependent effects in the magnitude of the direction of effects, and 
consistent with the broader literature suggesting that women may be more sensitive 
physiologically, behaviorally, and emotionally, to relational cues than are men (Kiecolt-
Glaser et al., 2002), we hypothesized that there would be stronger associations from 
relationship quality leading to insomnia over time for women, whereas for men, the reverse 
direction would evidence stronger associations.

Methods

Participants

The sample consisted of 216 participants—108 married couples—taking part in a larger 
marital intervention study (see Table 1). Participants were generally physically healthy based 
on specific exclusionary criteria. For example, exclusionary criteria included: chronic 
disease with a cardiovascular component, currently taking medications that influence blood 
pressure (as the parent study focused on cardiovascular outcomes), pregnant, or may become 
pregnant within the timeframe of our study (i.e., not preventing pregnancy). To ensure that 
we included distressed couples, we recruited from a community mental health clinic among 

1Number of children and age were entered as couple level variables because of the correlations between partners approached 1 (see 
Table 2), which is problematic statistically. We elected to use wife report for both of these variables.

Procedure

Measures

those seeking marital therapy. Thus, among the total sample of 216, 60 couples were actively 
seeking therapy. We used a multi-method approach (e.g., newspaper advertisements, flyers, 
internet, referral, etc.) to recruit a comparison group of well-adjusted couples from the 
community, who were not seeking marital therapy. All couples were screened to assess 
actual level of marital distress (see details below). Those seeking marital therapy were 
offered marital therapy at no cost and all couples received monetary compensation for 
completing the procedures of the study. Only those who were seeking marital therapy were 
assigned to the treatment arm of our study. Thus, our study is not a randomized clinical trial, 
but rather a comparison of treatment-seeking versus non-treatment seeking couples. This 
project received IRB approval by the Human Subjects committee at Brigham Young 
University.

Couples were first pre-screened over the phone to ensure they met the inclusion criteria. In 
addition to the criteria listed above, participants were also excluded if they were already 
receiving marital therapy, and if addiction and/or physical abuse were comorbid issues. If 
criteria were met, and after informed consent was obtained, participants completed a series 
of questionnaires that assessed general demographics variables (i.e. age, ethnicity, income, 
years married, number of children in the home), physical health (i.e. health history, sleep), 
mental health (i.e. depressive symptoms, general stress), and psychosocial measures (i.e. 
marital adjustment, social support). Participants completed the psychosocial and lifestyle 
assessments using a computerized survey tool (i.e., Qualtrics). Participants were also 
weighed and measured to assess body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. The 
identical procedures were repeated 12-weeks later, with the exception of BMI assessment 
which was assessed at baseline only.

Distressed couples seeking therapy received either the therapists preferred method of 
couple’s therapy (un-standardized method; n = 35) or emotion focused therapy (EFT, n = 25) 
during the 12-week period. EFT is a short term, structured approach to couples therapy with 
demonstrated efficacy, which focuses on restructuring key emotional responses (Denton, 
Burleson, Clark, Rodriguez, & Hobbs, 2000). We found no evidence that clustering within 
treatment type explained significant variance in outcomes, thus data from these groups were 
combined in analyses. The well-adjusted comparison group of couples received no 
treatment.

Distress Screening—The Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (RDAS; Busby, 
Christensen, Crane, & Larson, 1995) was used to assess level of marital quality at screening. 
The RDAS is an abbreviated 14-item version of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale that can 
reliably distinguish between distressed and non-distressed samples (Busby et al., 1995). The 
RDAS has demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability. For the Total RDAS Cronbach’s 
Alpha was.90, Guttman Split-Half = .94 and Spearman-Brown Split-Half reliability = .95. 
Based on prior research, scores on the RDAS < 48 (±5) are considered the clinical cutoff for 
distressed marital satisfaction (Anderson et al., 2014). Given that the RDAS has a 5 point 
margin of error, only cases where both members of the couple scored above 53 were

excluded from the therapy group. As expected from recruitment, the non-treatment seeking 
couples recruited from the community were indeed more well-adjusted and less distressed 
(M=52.9; SD=4.8) relative to those recruited from clinic intake (M=43.54; SD=7.6).

Marital Quality—In our analysis, the full 32-item version of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale 
(DAS; Spanier, 1976) was used to assess marital relationship quality using 4 sub-scales 
(dyadic satisfaction, cohesion, consensus, and affection expression) as well as total score. 
The DAS is a psychometrically sound instrument (Graham, Liu, & Jeziorski, 2006; Spanier, 
1976) that is perhaps the most widely used measure adjustment in couples in both clinical 
and research settings, and has been used widely in the marriage and health literature 
(Robles, 2014; Robles et al., 2014). The average score on the DAS for control couples was 
118.91 (SD = 13.93), the average score for intervention couples was 96.87 (SD = 19.01), 
where higher scores indicate better relationship quality (d = 1.30, 95% CI [1.00, 1.60]). At 
T2, couples continued to be significantly different from one another (with those in the 
control group having higher DAS scores than those in the intervention group); however, the 
difference between groups was smaller than at baseline (d = .78, 95% CI [.45, 1.10]). To 
account for these differences, we controlled for whether participants were in the intervention 
group or not and used the reliable change index (RCI, described in more detail below) to 
examine changes in marital satisfaction as a predictor of insomnia.

Insomnia—Three items drawn from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse, Reynolds, 
Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989)were used to assess the presence or absence of insomnia: 
sleep quality (on a 4-point scale ranging from Very Good to Very Bad), sleep latency 
(minutes to fall asleep), and minutes of wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO). Given that 
each of the sleep measures were correlated and that isolated sleep symptoms are prevalent in 
the general population, for parsimony, we created a composite, binary insomnia measure 
using clinical cutpoints that have been used in insomnia research (Edinger et al., 2004; 
Lichstein, Durrence, Taylor, Bush, & Riedel, 2003). Specifically, participants were coded as 
1 if they endorsed that their sleep quality was Very Bad or Fairly Bad or if their sleep latency 
or WASO was greater than 30 minutes; those who did not endorse any of the sleep 
symptoms at or above these threshold levels were coded as 0. Using this criterion, 47 
husbands and 53 wives reported insomnia at baseline and 24 husbands and 26 wives reported 
insomnia at follow up. Analyses (not shown) examining symptom counts (i.e., 0, 1,2, or 3 or 
more symptoms at or above the defined thresholds) revealed the same pattern of associations 
as with the binary measure. Therefore, we elected to present findings according to the binary 
outcome, as this is consistent with diagnostic criteria for insomnia.

Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)—The CES-D 
includes 20 clinically derived items and has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of 
depression (Radloff, 1977). In a nationwide survey of 2,500 participants, the scale’s 
reliability showed high consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha ranging from .75–.95 and in our 
sample, α = .87. We removed the sleep item from the CES-D scale to avoid redundancy with 
the sleep measure.

Results

Analytic Strategy

Page 6

To analyze our data, we used the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM), a dyadic 
data analytic approach that not only accounts for the nestedness of couple data but also 
explicitly models the dynamic, interdependent processes that characterize couple 
relationships. Unlike composite scores or analyzing partners separately, the APIM allows 
one to model the dynamic, interdependent influence of partners on one another. For 
example, one can model the impact of changes in wife’s marital satisfaction on husband 
insomnia (a partner effect) while accounting for the longitudinal stability of the husband’s 
insomnia over time (an actor effect). We conducted our analysis in Stata 13.1 (StataCorp, 
2013) using generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM) which allows for analysis of 
dependent variables that are not normally distributed. This flexibility was necessary because 
we had a binary outcome (i.e., insomnia present versus absent). We reported odds ratios 
(OR) when insomnia was the outcomefor ease of interpretation.

Our central research question was whether changes in marital satisfaction predicted 
insomnia at follow-up, after controlling for baseline insomnia and other covariates. To most 
directly answer this question, we included our treatment condition variable (0 = no-treatment 
group, 1 = treatment group) and the reliable change index (RCI) for marital satisfaction. In 
this case, the RCI is a pre-post change score that indicates how much people’s marital 
satisfaction changed during the course of study (Jacobson & Truax, 1991). Assignment to 
treatment group is a comparatively less sensitive measure of improvement, whereas the RCI 
offers a clearer measurement of how much participants’ relationship satisfaction changed 
over the course of the study, and thus more clearly answered the question of whether or not 
improvements in marital satisfaction predict changes in insomnia. We controlled for factors 
that are known to covary with both relationship functioning and insomnia, including baseline 
insomnia, body mass index, depressive symptoms (with the sleep item removed), age, and 
number of children in the home. Establishing a strong, unique relationship between variables 
and establishing the temporal ordering of an effect are key criteria in establishing causality 
(Hill, 1965). Observing a significant association between changes in marital quality when 
controlling for established covariates provides evidence of a strong, unique relationship 
between these variables, and the time lag between our two time points provides evidence for 
the direction of these effects (i.e. temporal ordering).

Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations and correlations within and 
between partners can be seen in Table 2 and our model can be seen in Figure 1. The average 
age of the sample was 28.86 (SD = 9.20). The ethnic breakdown of participants was as 
follows: 82% White (Caucasian), 7% Hispanic, 4.5% “Other”, 1.5% African American, 
1.5% Native American, 1.5% “Mixed”, 1% Asian, and 1% did not disclose their ethnicity. 
On average, couples had been together 5.4 years (SD = 7.8). Those in the intervention group 
had higher RCI values than those in the no-treatment group, indicating greater changes in 
marital satisfaction during the 3-month follow-up period (dHusbands = .60, 95% CI [.15, 
1.05]; dWives = .87, 95% CI [.40, 1.33]). Those in the intervention group were also older

(dHusbands = .39, 95% CI [.01, .78]; dWives = .41, 95% CI [.03, .79]) and had more children 
(dCouple = .48, 95% CI [.09, .87]). Husbands in the intervention group, but not wives, 
reported more depressive symptoms (dHusbands = .46, 95% CI [.07, .84]). There were no 
differences between groups for BMI or baseline insomnia.

Do Changes in Marital Satisfaction Predict Changes in Insomnia?

As expected, husbands (B = 1.02, 95% CI [.28, 1.75]) and wives (B = 1.40, 95% CI [.69, 
2.11]) who received treatment experienced more improvement in their marital satisfaction 
than those in the no-treatment group. Treatment seeking did not have a direct effect on either 
husband or wife insomnia. However, improvements in husband marital satisfaction over the 
3-month follow-up period were associated with lower odds of husband insomnia (OR = .64, 
95% CI [.40, 1.002]) at follow-up, even after controlling for both partners’ baseline insomnia 
and other covariates; indicating that for each standard deviation improvement in husband 
marital satisfaction, there was a 36% decrease in the odds of husband insomnia. For wives, 
improvements in their own marital satisfaction were not associated with wife insomnia at 
follow-up. A Wald test revealed that the difference in these parameter estimates was 
significantly larger for men than for women (χ2 (1) = 3.96, p < .05). We did not find 
evidence for partner effects (i.e., wife changes in marital satisfaction influencing husbands’ 
insomnia and vice versa).

To determine whether marital therapy influenced husband insomnia via the mechanism of 
improved relationship satisfaction, we examined this meditational path using the RMediation 
package (Tofighi & MacKinnon, 2011). Our results suggest that changes in marital 
satisfaction mediated the influence of marital therapy on husband insomnia (indirect effect = 
−.46, 95% CI [−1.16, 0.01]). Although the upper limit of the confidence interval just 
included zero, the vast majority of plausible estimates for the indirect effect fell below zero 
providing evidence that an effect is present.

Does Insomnia Predict Changes in Marital Satisfaction?

For our secondary research question, we examined whether insomnia at baseline predicted 
change in marital satisfaction over the 3-months of the study. To address this aim, we 
reversed the model showed in Figure 1, omitting T2 Insomnia and replacing it with T1 
Insomnia and examining husband and wife RCIs as our dependent variables. We tested for 
group interactions (no-treatment vs. intervention) and report different values for each group 
only when they were significantly different from one another; otherwise we collapsed across 
groups. As expected, the intercepts were different across groups such that both husbands (χ2 
(1) 8.53, p < .01) and wives (χ2 (1) 13.66, p < .01) in the intervention group experienced 
more change over the course of the study than those in the no-treatment group.

Insomnia had no significant impact on changes in ones’ own marital satisfaction for either 
husbands or wives (i.e., actor effects). However, we did find evidence for a partner effect, but 
only in the no-treatment comparison group; the influence of wife insomnia on changes in 
husband marital satisfaction was different between groups (χ2 (1) 6.30, p = .01). 

2Having the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval include an odds ratio of 1.00 is analogous to having p = .05

Specifically, in the no-treatment group, wife baseline insomnia predicted improvements in 
husband marital satisfaction (B = 1.14, 95% CI [.45, 1.84] whereas for those in the 
intervention group, there was not a significant association (B = −.75, 95% CI [−2.04, .55]). 
Regarding partner effects, there were no differences between groups nor did partner 
insomnia predict changes in marital satisfaction for either husbands or wives.

Discussion

These results add to an emerging literature that recognizes the dyadic nature of sleep for 
most adults. It is the first to study longitudinal sleep-marital functioning associations in a 
sample of treatment-seeking, maritally distressed couples and a non-treatment-seeking 
comparison group. Improvements in marital satisfaction were associated with lower risk of 
insomnia at the 3-month follow-up; however, contrary to our expectations and prior work, 
we found that this effect was only statistically significant for husbands—for each standard 
deviation increase in husband’s marital satisfaction, there was a 36% reduction in the risk of 
insomnia. Although these findings are in conflict with prior research and theory that suggest 
that women are more physiologically and emotionally responsive to marital distress than 
men, there is only limited data suggesting gender-dependent associations between marital 
distress and sleep. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of 
marital distress on both husbands’ and wives’ sleep.

Although the treatment group experienced greater improvement in marital satisfaction as 
compared to the no-treatment group, there was not a direct effect of treatment on insomnia 
symptoms at follow-up. However, our data suggest that marital therapy improved husband 
insomnia indirectly by improving marital quality. This effect was not isolated to those who 
received marital therapy; rather, improvement in husband marital satisfaction had a direct 
effect on insomnia irrespective of condition. Thus, these findings are intriguing in that they 
are the first to demonstrate that improving marital quality can have a measurable impact on 
insomnia. Importantly, the significant associations reported herein were independent of risk 
factors that are known to covary with both insomnia and marital distress, are consistent with 
the hypothesis that reducing marital distress may have an independent positive effect on 
sleep.

Regarding the reverse association where we examined whether insomnia predicted changes 
in marital satisfaction, we found only one significant effect; counter-intuitively, wife 
baseline insomnia predicted improvements in husband’s marital satisfaction, but only in the 
no-treatment group. Perhaps wives in non-distressed marriages who experience more sleep 
loss at night (either at onset or after onset) are engaging in conversation or sexual activity 
with their husbands, thus increasing husband marital satisfaction. More research is needed 
that examines not only sleep disturbance, but also related dyadic activities such as late night 
conflict, conversations, or sexual activity, as each of these could manifest as sleep 
disturbance on sleep measures such as those that we used, but that may reflect other 
relational processes. The lack of significant associations overall for the pathway from 
insomnia to changes in marital satisfaction is in contrast to the handful of other studies using 
observational designs (Gordon & Chen, 2013; Hasler & Troxel, 2010) which have shown 
that poor sleep predicts subsequent marital functioning. This inconsistency with the prior

literature may be due to the context of the study (i.e., as part of a marital intervention trial) 
or may be due to differences in the nature and timing of the assessments of sleep and marital 
functioning. Specifically, whereas our study evaluated insomnia as a predictor of changes in 
marital satisfaction over a 3-month period, both the Gordon and Chen study (2013) and the 
Hasler and Troxel study (2010) examined more proximal associations between sleep and 
next day’s marital functioning. Further research is needed to determine whether the proximal 
associations between poor sleep and marital distress cumulatively contribute to changes in 
marital distress over more extended periods of time.

Strengths and Limitations

These findings must be interpreted within the study strengths and limitations. Notably, this 
was the first study to examine the role of sleep in the context of a marital intervention. As 
such, these findings extend the limited, extant literature on bidirectional associations 
between sleep and marital functioning, by examining these pathways in a sample of 
distressed couples seeking marital therapy and a control group of couples that were not 
seeking therapy, which may enhance the variability in key study constructs, as opposed to 
prior work which has focused on convenience, community-based samples. Nevertheless, our 
sample was relatively small and consisted primarily of young, Caucasian couples, some of 
whom were seeking therapy in a low-income community clinic, some of whom were not. 
Also, given that there was some overlap in the marital satisfaction scores, there is clearly 
some heterogeneity in level of marital distress in both the treatment-seeking group and the 
non-treatment seeking group, which may have attenuated group differences. Furthermore, by 
design, the study was not a randomized clinical trial. Another strength of the study was the 
use of a well-validated instrument for assessing marital distress (DAS) and use of actor-
partner models to assess the dyadic and bidirectional associations between marital 
functioning and insomnia. However, the use of self-reports for both marital distress and 
insomnia may have introduced common method variance. Nevertheless, findings are 
supported by the fact that significant associations were observed even after controlling for 
depressive symptoms. It is also worth noting that we used specific items drawn from the 
PSQI to assess sleep, rather than the fully validated scale, which may limit the reliability and 
validity of the measure. On the other hand, as a measure of insomnia complaints, the 
measure used herein is consistent with frequency and symptom criteria used for the 
diagnosis of insomnia, with the exception that it does not assess daytime dysfunction 
(Edinger et al., 2004). Related to sleep assessment, given that the original intent of the study 
was not focused on examining sleep in couples, we did not have measures of diagnosed or 
undiagnosed sleep disorders, and did not directly assess whether or not participants were 
actually sleeping with their spouse on a regular basis. However, given that couples in this 
sample were relatively young and healthy, we would not expect a high prevalence of sleep 
disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and we controlled for baseline BMI which 
is a key risk factor for OSA.

Summary

This study highlights the important but understudied interface between changes in marital 
functioning in the context of marital therapy and insomnia. Given that sleep is a dyadic 
behavior for most adults and is critically important for health and well-being, it is surprising

that very little marital research has focused on the role of sleep in the context of marital 
interventions. By the same token, only recently have sleep researchers focused on the social 
nature of sleep (Rogojanski, Carney, & Monson, 2013; Troxel et al., 2007). To our 
knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that improvements in marital functioning 
are associated with improvements in sleep, although the findings were only significant 
among husbands. Clearly, these findings must be replicated with larger and more diverse 
samples, and using objective as well as subjective measures of sleep. Nevertheless, findings 
from this preliminary research add to the growing literature on the dyadic role of sleep, and 
suggest that improving sleep may be an added benefit of improving marital functioning 
within couples. Recognizing the dyadic nature of sleep is critical to inform the 
comprehensive assessment and treatment planning in the context of marital and sleep 
interventions.
