Over 125,000 women immigrate to Canada yearly—most in their childbearing years and many having given birth before
immigrating. We sought to (1) examine the background characteristics and mental health proﬁle of women separated from their
children due to migration and subsequently giving birth in Canada (“dual-country (DC) mothers”) and (2) contrast these with
those of “non-dual-country” migrant mothers. Of 514 multiparous migrant women giving birth, one-ﬁfth (18%) reported being
separated from their children due to migration. Over one-third of DC mothers were living in poverty (36.0% versus 18.6%,
P = 0.001), and one in seven was experiencing household food insecurity (16.3% versus 7.6%, P = 0.01). Over one-third had no
partner (40.2% versus 11.4%, P = 0.00), and nearly one-quarter reported no available support (23.1% versus 12.2%, P = 0.007).
Over three-quarters were asylum seekers or refugees (83.7% versus 51%, P = 0.00). More DC than non-DC mothers had symptoms
of postpartum depression (28.3% versus 18.6%, P = 0.04), symptoms of clinical depression (23.1% versus 13.5%, P = 0.02), and
anxiety related to trauma (16.5% versus 9.4%, P = 0.04). Results suggest that identifying DC mothers is a rapid approach to enable
clinicians to target a subgroup of women needing special attention.

1. Introduction

“The mother left 2 children behind [and] does not know what
has happened to them.” This is a nursing note on mother from
Zambia living in Toronto.

In 2010, there were an estimated 214 million migrants
worldwide [1]; between 2006 and 2010, 1.27 million
migrated to Canada [2]. More than 52% of the newcomers
to Canada are women, and of these, 65% are in their
childbearing years [2]. Over a ﬁve-year period in Canada
from 1996 to 2001, the fertility rate among immigrant
women was 3.1 children per woman—twice the national
fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman [3, 4]. Canadian
family reuniﬁcation policies and practices, such as a narrow
deﬁnition of family, lengthy application processing times,
and ﬁnancial requirements, can lead to prolonged separation
periods between family members [5]. The psychological

impact due to family separation is compounded by loss of
social networks and support, traumatic experiences before,
during, and after migration, and low economic status [6, 7].
The toll that migration status and acculturation adjust-
ments have on women’s health and well-being has given
rise to several studies [8–10]. Women who are separated
from their children due to migration report considerable
emotional strain including anxiety, loss, and guilt, and they
are at greater risk for depression [11, 12]. Migrant women
who recently gave birth in a new country display greater risks
of depression during pregnancy and are at higher risk for
symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), attributing their
symptoms among other reasons to social isolation, feeling
overwhelmed, and ﬁnancial worries [8, 13, 14]. Migration
class is associated with regulatory restrictions related to
eligibility for health care services at provincial and federal
levels [15]. Although research has looked at the impact

2

on women who are separated from their children due to
international migration [11, 12] and the health outcomes of
women giving birth in a new country [16], to our knowledge,
no studies have simultaneously examined the postbirth
health of women who are separated from their children due
to international migration and have subsequently given birth
in a new country (“dual-country” (DC) mothers).

Upon migrating, there may be a range of ways in which
a woman nurtures her relationship with her child(ren)
overseas such as ﬁnancial responsibility, training for adult
life, communication, and intimacy [6, 17]. The nature of
this relationship is not the focus of the current study, instead
we aim to describe the mental health risk proﬁle of women
separated from their children due to international migration
and who have subsequently given birth in Canada.

We hypothesized that DC mothers would have poorer
mental health proﬁles than non-DC migrant mothers, and
we posed the following research questions: (1) What are the
background characteristics and mental health proﬁle of DC
mothers? and (2) how do their characteristics and mental
health proﬁle diﬀer from non-DC mothers?

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Population. This study is a secondary analysis of
514 multiparous migrant women who participated in the
childbearing health and related service needs of newcomers
study. Details of this study have been reported elsewhere [16].
This dataset was ideal for this purpose because it was created
in the context of a Canadian prospective cohort study that
aimed to examine the health and related service needs of over
1,500 women and their infants. To be included in the original
study, women had to be Canadian-born or newly arrived
migrants (i.e., ≤5 years) with a known migration status
(refugees, asylum seekers, and nonrefugee immigrants), have
no major hearing impairment or mental condition, and give
birth to a live child who would go home with her. To be
included in the current study, mothers also had to have
been born outside of Canada, be multiparous, and have
answered the question “did any of your children stay in
the country you left?” Of these, 92 responded positively to
being separated from a child due to international migration,
characterising them as DC mothers and the remaining 422
as non-DC mothers. The study received approval from the
relevant research ethics boards and women gave informed
consent prior to entry into the study.

2.2. Data Collection. Data collection took place between
February 2006 and December 2009 at six Montreal, one
Vancouver, and ﬁve Toronto hospital birthing units. Mothers
were recruited and administered a series of 16 questionnaires
over three points of contact: in hospital by a research assistant
and at two home visits by a registered nurse at 7–10 days
and 4 months postpartum. The mothers’ medical records
were reviewed in-hospital and additional demographic and
migration data were obtained through interviews [18]. The
4-month visit was important as the nurse had established a
rapport with the mother to be able to ask intimate questions

regarding abuse and mental health. In the current study,
we examined mental health using the following indicators:
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, risk
of PPD, and clinical depression and anxiety symptoms.

The interview schedule included the Edinburgh Postnatal
Depression Scale (EPDS) [19], Harvard Trauma Ques-
tionnaire (HTQ) [20]—sections I and III, and Hopkins
Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL) [21], all of which have been
widely translated and used in a number of studies among
diverse cultural groups and validated against Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of American Psychiatric Association, IV
Version (DSM IV) for clinical diagnoses of mental mood
disorders [13, 22, 23]. PPD was measured by the 10-item
self-report EPDS with a score ≥10 to be suggestive of
minor/major PPD symptomatology [19]. The ﬁrst section
of the HTQ lists 16 items describing a range of exposures
to violence or torture, and a concern is noted if a mother
has witnessed or experienced at least one of the items [20].
The ﬁrst 16 questions of section III of this questionnaire
are scored and suggest symptoms of PTSD if ≥2.5 [20].
Symptoms of anxiety and depression are indicated if a
woman scored ≥1.75 in parts I and II, respectively, of the
HSCL [24]. Report of being “physically hurt” within the last
year was assessed with the Abuse Assessment Screen [25].
Social isolation was deﬁned as reporting somewhat disagree
to strongly disagree to “having relatives or friends that will
help me out even if I cannot pay them back” or “having
someone who loves and cares about me” according to the
Personal Resource Questionnaire [26]. All questionnaires
were available in 13 languages (Arabic, Cantonese, English,
French, Farsi/Persian, Mandarin, Punjabi, Russian, Serbo-
Croatian, Somali, Spanish, Tamil, and Urdu) and were back-
translated and assessed for cultural appropriateness [27].

2.3. Data Analysis. Bivariate analyses using chi-square and
Fisher’s exact tests were performed comparing DC with
non-DC mothers to answer our main research questions.
In exploratory analyses, sub-group comparisons of DC and
non-DC mothers within the most precarious migrant groups
(asylum seekers and refugees) were also conducted. Data
were analysed using PASW Statistics 18.

3. Results

Of 514 multiparous migrant women giving birth, one-ﬁfth
(18%) reported being separated from their children due to
international migration. Table 1 presents their background
characteristics and those of non-DC mothers. Two-thirds of
DC mothers did not complete high school (65.9% versus
45.5%, P = 0.00), over one-third were living in poverty
(36.0% versus 18.6%, P = 0.001), and one in seven was
experiencing household food insecurity (16.3% versus 7.6%,
P = 0.01). Over one-third had no partner (40.2% versus
11.4%, P = 0.00) and nearly one-quarter reported no
available support (23.1% versus 12.2%, P = 0.01). Over
three-quarters were asylum seekers or refugees (83.7% versus
51%, P = 0.000), and far less than half had their initial
prenatal visit during the ﬁrst trimester (42.2% versus 60.2%,

P = 0.05), and clinical depression related to trauma
(23.1% versus 13.5%, P = 0.02). Although it did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance, symptoms of PTSD were reported
more frequently in DC mothers (7.7% versus 3.8%, P =
0.16). Comparisons of DC to non-DC mothers restricted
to within the asylum-seeking/refugee group were not statis-
tically diﬀerent; however, rates of mental health outcomes
tended toward greater risks to DC mothers for all outcomes.
The highest was a 50% greater risk of PPD at 4 months
(29.9% versus 20.0%, P = 0.08), followed by a 38% greater
risk of PTSD (9.2% versus 5.7%, P = 0.29), and a 33%
greater risk of clinical depression (26.3% versus 17.5%, P =
0.10).

4. Discussion

that

Our study shows that the constellation of background
characteristics which describe DC mothers, combined with
their mental health proﬁles, suggest
they are an
extremely high-risk group warranting case ﬁnding and
additional support and care. Their mental health proﬁle is
poorer than other migrant mothers and is not explained by
being in a precarious immigration class. The mental health
issues they experience include symptoms of PPD risk for
clinical depression and anxiety related to trauma. And these
challenges are often experienced in the context of low formal
education, low household income, food insecurity, single
parenthood, lack of social support, limited time in Canada,
limited host language ability, absence of health insurance,
and having experienced a surgical birth.

Previous research has studied the impact of separation
on the mother [11, 12], however to our knowledge, none
has investigated the health or well-being of women who
subsequently gave birth in a new country. The rates of
harmful background psychosocial experiences and mental

health outcomes of DC mothers we found in our study are
greater than those found in studies of other populations.
For example, as regards food insecurity, 4.1% of Canadian
households with children have ever had to cut the size
of meals or skipped meals [28], compared to the nearly
four times greater rate of the DC mothers in our study.
Canadian studies have estimated the prevalence of physical
abuse during pregnancy in the general population to be
about 6% [29, 30]. Our estimates for non-DC mothers are
close to this rate (5.2%), while DC mothers were more than
twice the rate (14.8%).

DC mothers are at higher risk of PPD at 4-month post-
birth than non-DC mothers (28.3% versus 18.6%), although
both groups have higher rates than other studies which
report an average prevalence of 13% [31]. Our ﬁndings that
DC mothers exhibit symptoms over twice this rate may speak
to the constellation of factors making up their background.
DC mothers exhibited nearly twice the rate of signs of clinical
depression than non-DC mothers (23.1% versus 13.5%) and
more experienced anxiety (16.5% versus 9.4%). More of the
DC mothers had past experiences of violence and trauma,
and these past traumatic experiences could contribute to the
observed higher rates of depression and anxiety in addition
to separation from their children. Previous research has
shown both that “. . .having children who lived elsewhere
predicted the likelihood of major depression” [12] and that
being with one’s family can have a protective eﬀect on trauma
victims [7]. Anxiety is likely further exacerbated, since one
or more of her children remain in the country where she
experienced violence, and from where she has sought refuge.
Reducing the lengthy immigration application processing
time, ﬁnancial requirements, and narrow deﬁnitions of
family may reduce the long separation periods between
family members. Finally, asylum-seeking women who give
birth may further fear that their applications for asylum
may be rejected while their infant is permitted to stay

Obstetrics and Gynecology International

as a Canadian citizen, leaving them to be forced to choose
to remain illegally in Canada, return with the infant to an
unsafe environment, or leave the infant in Canada with other
caregivers.

Our study is not exempt from limitations. The relatively
small number of DC mothers in our study prevented us
from being able to perform multivariate analyses; however,
analyses restricted to the combined asylum-seeking and
refugee group did oﬀer evidence that the diﬀerence in the
two groups by immigration class was not responsible for
the diﬀerences in mental health outcomes. The tools used
for mental health risk do not constitute diagnostic tools on
their own, and referral and followup with community mental
health practitioners are warranted.

Care providers working with migrant women in the
perinatal period may wish to do screening to determine if
the woman is (or is soon to be) a DC mother, knowing that
she is more likely to experience poor mental health than
non-DC mothers. Referral to mental health workers and
relevant community agencies may be appropriate. Home
visits and community activities may help to address isolation
and minimize harmful mental health symptomatology.
Assistance in reducing lengthy immigration application pro-
cessing times through letter writing in support of a woman’s
case for family reuniﬁcation could help to reduce the long
separation periods between family members who could oﬀer
needed social support. This may be particularly beneﬁcial for
those who were victims of trauma since the literature shows
that being with one’s family can have a protective eﬀect [7].
Research to further examine the causes of food insecurity
such as isolation,
inaccessibility to food programs (e.g.,
food banks), or insuﬃcient income is warranted to develop
targeted policies and interventions. Future research on how
separation from children aﬀects mothers’ health and mental
wellbeing with a subsequent birth in a new country is also
needed.

5. Conclusions

The constellation of background characteristics which
describe DC mothers, combined with their mental health
proﬁles, suggests that they are an extremely high-risk group
warranting case ﬁnding and additional support and care.
Their mental health proﬁle is poorer than other migrant
mothers and is not explained by being in a precarious
immigration class. Mental health issues include symptoms
of PPD, risk for clinical depression, and anxiety related to
trauma. These concerns were often present in the context
food
of
insecurity, lack of social support, limited time in Canada,
limited host language ability, absence of health insurance,
and having experienced a surgical birth. Our results suggest
that identifying DC mothers is a rapid approach for obste-
tricians and gynecologists to identify a subgroup of migrant
women who may be at greater mental health risk than other
migrant mothers in their care. Additional support during
the perinatal period and policies to promote rapid family
reuniﬁcation warrant consideration.
