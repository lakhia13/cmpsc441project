Abstract 
Background  The Bergen 4-day treatment (B4DT) is a concentrated exposure-based therapy that has been shown 
to be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The current study sought to examine the effectiveness of B4DT 
for panic disorder (PD), when delivered with a combination of face-to-face sessions and videoconferencing.

Methods  Treatment was delivered to 50 patients from April 2020 to May 2021. Because of regulations dur-
ing the pandemic, a significant portion of the treatment was conducted via videoconference. The primary outcome 
measure was the clinician-rated Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), and secondary measures included patient-rated 
symptoms of panic disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, depression, and treatment satisfaction. Changes 
in symptom levels over time were estimated using multilevel models.

Results  Patients showed a significant reduction in clinician-rated symptoms of panic disorder (Measured by PDSS) 
from before treatment to post treatment (d = 2.18) and 3-month follow-up (d = 2.01). At three months follow-up 
62% of patients were classified as in remission, while 70% reported a clinically significant response. We also found 
a reduction in symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety, and the patients reported high satisfaction 
with the treatment.

Conclusion  The current study suggests that B4DT delivered in a combination of videoconference and face-to-face 
meetings may be a useful treatment approach. As the study is uncontrolled, future studies should also include more 
strictly designed investigations.

Introduction
Panic Disorder (PD) is characterized by the occurrence of 
sudden  and  intense  panic  attacks.  Panic  attacks  are  fol-
lowed  by  a  fear  of  physical  symptoms  and  fear  of  cata-
strophic  consequences  of  future  panic  attacks.  Patients 
therefore  engage  in  excessive  safety  behaviours,  avoid-
ance  and  worry  of  new  panic  attacks,  which  can  result 
in  a  vicious  circle  which  often  impairs  functioning  and 
reduces  quality  of  life  [1,  2].  Agoraphobia,  the  fear  of 
being in situations without an option to escape or getting 
help, is also very common in PD [3].

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been found to 
be  an  effective  treatment  for  PD  with  and  without  ago-
raphobia,  and  most  studies  include  CBT  delivered  with 
one or two weekly sessions [4–6]. According to Öst and 
Ollendick  [7],  concentrated  treatment  can  be  defined  as 
interventions with more than one session/week during a 
fairly short time period. There is evidence to support that 
treatment  can  be  delivered  in  more  concentrated  for-
mats [5, 8]. For instance, a 2-day intervention [9], a five-
day  treatment  [10]  and  a  concentrated  eight  day  format 
[11], which all showed promising results. In sum, emerg-
ing evidence suggests that the effectiveness of a standard 
CBT  versus  a  brief,  intensive  and  concentrated  formats 
may  be  comparable  [7,  12].  From  a  patient  perspective, 
concentrated  treatment  formats  may  have  some  advan-
tages and contribute to increased availability of treatment 
(i.e.,  travel  distance  to  the  clinic),  faster  recovery  and 
lower dropout rates [13].

One  concentrated  and  exposure-based  format  of  CBT 
is the Bergen 4-day treatment (B4DT), which is delivered 
during four consecutive days. The treatment is designed 
to  be  an  individual  treatment  delivered  in  a  group  set-
ting, with a 1:1 ratio between therapists and patients. The 
focus of the treatment is to help patients recognize how 
they  misinterpret  benign  bodily  symptoms  as  signs  of 
severe illness and that efforts to prevent the feared con-
sequences  through  control  of  the  symptoms  may  para-
doxically  maintain  and  intensify  the  problem.  Exposure 
tasks  are  not  designed  as  behavioural  experiments  to 
disconfirm  catastrophic  beliefs.  Rather  it  is  focused  on 
emotional  regulation,  willingness  and  skills  to  let  go  of 
their efforts to control symptoms and the negative conse-
quences they fear. This is done according to a procedure 
(“LEeaning  in  Technique”  or  “LET”)  that  focus  on  the 
willingness  and  how  to  “lean  in”  rather  than  hold  back 
while doing exposure tasks.

The  B4DT  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  treat-
ment  of  obsessive–compulsive  disorder  [13–17],  and  a 
pilot study (N = 29) for PD has demonstrated promising 
results [18]. In this study 90% of patients achieved treat-
ment response and 72% were considered to be in remis-
sion after three months [18]. These results have recently 

been replicated at a new site with 30 patients where 86% 
were considered in remission at three months follow-up 
[19].  A  third  and  larger  replication  of  B4DT  treated  58 
patients and found that 81% of patients were considered 
responders  at  three  months  follow-up,  and  81%  as  in 
remission [20].

The aim of the current study is to investigate the feasi-
bility, acceptability and effectiveness of the B4DT for PD 
when the treatment was delivered during the COVID-19 
pandemic,  where  a  significant  portion  of  the  treatment 
were delivered via videoconference.

Method
Participants and procedures

The study is a naturalistic investigation in a routine clini-
cal  setting,  with  no  comparison  group.  The  treatment 
was  offered  from  April  2020  to  May  2021  at  the  Clinic 
for 4-Day Treatment in Bergen, Norway, where the treat-
ment  format  was  developed. The  study  period  was  con-
current with the COVID-19-pandemic. All patients were 
referred to the Clinic for 4-Day Treatment and treatment 
was offered as a part of public health care. The study was 
approved  by  the  regional  committees  for  medical  and 
health research ethics in Norway (REK-midt, ID 468517). 
All  patients  signed  written  consent  for  participation.  A 
semi-structured interview using the panic disorder sever-
ity scale (PDSS) was performed before treatment, at post-
treatment,  and  at  three-months  follow-up.  Patients  also 
completed  questionnaires  online  before  treatment  (pre-
treatment),  one  week  after  (post-treatment)  and  three-
months after (follow-up).

The  study  sample  included  50  patients  who  received 
treatment between April 2020 and May 2021. 41 patients 
(82%)  were  given  a  diagnosis  of  PD  with  agoraphobia, 
while 9 (18%) were given a diagnosis of PD without ago-
raphobia.  Patients  were  not  offered  B4DT  if  they  were 
suicidal, psychotic, actively abusing alcohol or narcotics, 
bipolar  in  manic  phase,  had  a  severe  eating  disorder  or 
did not speak Norwegian.

Assessment
Diagnostic interviews

The  Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview 
(MINI) was used to assess PD diagnosis and to screen for 
comorbid disorders [21]. The interview screens for axis-I 
DSM-IV disorders, and the Norwegian version has been 
shown to have sound psychometric properties [22].

Primary  outcome  measure.  The  PDSS  is  a  seven-
item  interview  to  measure  PD  severity  [23],  and  has 
been  shown  to  have  good  psychometric  properties 
[24].  Criteria  presented  by  Furukawa  [25]  was  used  to 
define  clinically  significant  change,  where  remission 
was  defined  as  PDSS  scores  of  five  or  less  for  patients 

Hjelle et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:570 

Page 3 of 9

without  agoraphobia  and  scores  at  seven  or  below  for 
patients  with  agoraphobia.  Clinically  significant  change 
(response) was defined as a 40% or greater reduction [25]. 
The paper reports results from a study in routine clinical 
care,  and  no  interrater  assessment  was  performed.  The 
one-week assessment was performed by an independent 
therapist in the same team, who did not participate in the 
treatment group, while the three-month assessment typi-
cally  was  carried  out  by  the  patient’s  therapist  from  the 
group.

Secondary  outcome  measures.  Secondary  outcome 
measures  consisted  of  six  self-report  scales.  The  Body 
Sensations  Questionnaire  (BSQ)  was  used  to  self-report 
fear  of  bodily  symptoms,  which  are  considered  a  core 
element of PD [26]. Mobility inventory for Agoraphobia 
(MI)  was  used  as  a  measure  of  agoraphobic  avoidance 
[27,  28].  The  MI  is  divided  in  two  scales,  which  respec-
tively measures reduced mobility alone and together with 
others. Symptoms of depression were measured with the 
Patient Health questionnaire (PHQ-9; [29]). Symptoms of 
generalized anxiety were measured with the Generalized 
anxiety scale (GAD-7; [30]). Client Satisfaction Question-
naire (CSQ-8) was used to report treatment satisfaction, 
and  has  good  psychometric  properties  [31].  Work  and 
social impairment was measured by the Work and Social 
Adjustment  Scale  (WSAS;  [32]).  The  score  ranges  from 
0–40,  where  higher  scores  represent  a  larger  impair-
ment  in  work,  daily  chores,  social  activities,  and  ability 
to  maintain  personal  relations.  WSAS  have  been  shown 
to  have  strong  psychometric  properties,  in  measuring 
impairment in work, social life and daily functioning [33].

Treatment

The B4DT is a concentrated exposure-based treatment, 
which spans four days and is delivered to groups of 3–6 
patients.  The  treatment  is  a  combination  of  individu-
ally  tailored  exposure  sessions  and  group  sessions. The 
first  day  consists  of  patient  education,  with  an  empha-
sis on the case formulation for PD, factors that maintain 
the  disorder  and  exposure  technique  to  help  break  the 
pattern.  The  second  and  third  days  include  therapist-
assisted exposure to interoceptive symptoms relevant to 
the patient, and agoraphobic situations, with an empha-
sis on doing exposure with the “LEaning in Technique” 
(LET). Patients also shared experiences from the expo-
sure  sessions  in  the  group,  which  was  nuanced  by  rep-
etition of the psychoeducation. The last day focuses on 
a summary of principles, facilitating lasting change and 
relapse-prevention. All patients make a three-week plan 
for  self-exposure  to  consolidate  the  lessons  learned  as 
part  of  their  everyday  living.  A  more  detailed  descrip-
tion  of  the  treatment  structure  and  rationale  is  found 
elsewhere [18, 19].

As  the  treatment  was  delivered  during  the  COVID-19  
pandemic,  adjustments  were  made  to  the  treatment 
delivery to comply with national restrictions. This meant 
that a significant portion of the treatment was conducted 
via videoconference.

Therapists

Five clinical psychologists experienced with CBT and the 
B4DT led the treatment groups. Five groups were led by 
one therapist, two other therapists led three groups each, 
while  the  last  two  led  one  group  each.  The  group  lead-
ers  had  an  average  of  5.2  years  (range  2–15)  experience 
with  treatment  of  anxiety  disorders.  Twenty-six  thera-
pists participated in treatment, and therapist competency 
and  experience  with  the  treatment  format  varied,  as 
treatment was delivered as part of an implementation of 
B4DT in the region. All therapists had completed a two-
day  course  in  treatment  of  PD  and  were  certified  in  the 
B4DT,  which  involves  a  clinical  evaluation  after  partici-
pation on a minimum of two groups. The therapists were 
mainly  psychologists,  but  also  therapists  from  different 
health professions, such as nurses, psychiatrists, and psy-
chology students.

Statistical analyses

We used IBM SPSS Statistics (version 27) to perform sta-
tistical analyses. To investigate if the demographic varia-
bles were related to symptom severity prior to treatment, 
independent  samples  t-test  and  one-way  ANOVAs  was 
applied. A linear mixed model (LMM) design (with time 
as a fixed effect and intercept for each subject as a random 
effect) was used to investigate change in symptoms over 
time.  With  this  model  an  increase  in  power  is  achieved 
as  all  available  data  can  be  used  without  imputation  or 
listwise deletion [34, 35]. A diagonal covariance structure 
(heterogeneous  variance  and  zero  correlation  between 
elements)  was  applied  on  the  residuals,  as  this  provided 
a  good  fit  for  the  model.  Parametric  assumptions  were 
assessed  for  each  test  and  we  found  no  indication  that 
these  assumptions  were  violated.  Restricted  Maximum 
Likelihood  estimation  with  Satterthwaite  approximation 
was chosen to estimate t- and p-values. Both primary and 
secondary outcomes were inserted into separate analyses 
using this same procedure. To reduce the probability of a 
type-I  error  when  doing  multiple  independent  analyses, 
a  Bonferroni  correction  was  performed,  including  the 
LMM analyses for primary (PDSS) and secondary (PHQ-
9, GAD-7, BSQ, MI, WSAS). In order to investigate post-
hoc  differences,  two  dummy  variables  representing  the 
two time intervals (pre-post and post-FU) was added as 
a  covariate  to  the  main  analyses.  Effect  sizes  were  cal-
culated  as  Cohen’s  d = (M1  –  M2)/SDpooled  [36].  A  pear-
son R correlation was used to investigate the correlation

between  the  PDSS-scores  and  the  self-report  measures. 
The PDSS scores were compared to three previous stud-
ies on B4DT for PD by using independent samples t-tests.

Results
Feasibility

There  were  only  one  patient  that  dropped-out  of  the 
treatment (2%), and this patient was not included in the 
dataset.  50  patients  were  included  in  the  analyses.  The 
dataset  had  a  low  percentage  of  missing  data,  which  for 
PDSS were only 2.% percent across the three assessment 

times  (none  at  pre-treatment,  2%  at  post-treatment  and 
4%  at  follow-up).  Self-report  questionnaires  were  com-
pleted by all patients before treatment, 49 (98%) at 1 week 
and 43 (86%) at three months follow-up. See Fig. 1 for an 
overview of patient flow.

The treatment satisfaction of the treatment were high, 

as measured by an average score of 29.46 on the CSQ-8.

anxiety  disorder,  five  (10%)  obsessive–compulsive  dis-
order,  and  three  (6%)  post-traumatic  stress  disorder. 
Baseline PDSS-scores for patients with comorbidity did 
not  differ  significantly  from  patients  without  a  comor-
bid disorder, t(48) = -0.356,  p = 0.36. Twenty-one (42%) 
patients  reported  using  antidepressants,  mainly  SSRI 
and SNRIs, and these did not have a significantly higher 
PDSS  at  baseline  compared  to  those  who  were  not 
using  antidepressants, t(48) = 3.1,  p = 0.42.  No  changes 
were done to SSRI during active treatment period, and 
patients were on a stable dose at least four weeks before 
the time of treatment. Five patients (10%) used benzo-
diazepines sporadically and were instructed to not use 
these in the treatment period. No patients were in the 
acute  phase  of  PD,  and  the  duration  of  the  disorder 
ranged from 6 months to 40 years.

Primary outcome measure

Mean scores of the dependent measures and effect sizes 
across  all  time  points  are  found  in  Table  2.  The  PDSS 
showed  a  significant  effect  of  time  (F(2,50) = 140.99, 
p < 0.001),  indicating  significant  change  over  time/treat-
ment.  This  significant  reduction  in  PDSS-scores  was 
found  from  pre-  to  post-treatment,  (F(2,50) = 206.56, 
p < 0.001,  Cohen’s  d(d) = 2.18,  but  not  between  post  and 
follow-up,  F(2,50) = 0.03,  p = 0.863,  d(d) = 0.041.  At  one 
week  follow-up,  a  total  of  74%  was  in  remission,  while 
82%  had  a  clinically  significant  change.  Three  months 
after treatment, a total of 62% of patients were in remis-
sion,  while  70%  was  considered  to  have  a  clinically  sig-
nificant  change.  The  Bonferroni  analyses  showed  that 
the primary and secondary outcome measures were still 
below < 0.001 significance level after accounting for mul-
tiple comparisons. PDSS-scores for all patients across the 
three time-points are illustrated in Fig. 2.

was  found  from  pre-  to  post-treatment  (F(2,50) = 23.84, 
p < 0.001, d(d) = 0.52), but not from post-treatment to FU 
(F(2,50) = 0.73, p = 0.399, d(d) = 0.09) (Fig. 2).

Comparison with previous studies

PDSS  scores  from  pre,  post  and  follow-up  were  com-
pared  to  the  three  previous  B4DT  studies  on  PD  (see 
Table  4). We  found that  the  pre-treatment  PDSS scores 
was  not  significantly  different  from  the  other  B4DT 
studies,  except  Iversen  and  colleagues  [19],  t(77) = 6.37, 
p < 0.001. At one week post, the PDSS scores of the cur-
rent study did not differ from the three previous studies 
on  PD.  At  three-months  follow-up,  PDSS  scores  of  the 
current  study  did  not  differ  from  the  pilot  study  [18], 
t(77) = 0.954,  p = 0.343,  but  it  was  higher  than  Eide  and 
colleagues  [20],  t(106) = 3.64,  p < 0.001,  and  Iversen  and 
colleagues [19], t(78) = 2.988, p = 0.004.

Discussion
In  this  study,  we  examined  the  feasibility,  acceptability 
and effectiveness of the B4DT for PD adapted to COVID-
19  restrictions,  as  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  treat-
ment  were  delivered  by  videoconferencing.  The  results 
indicates that using videoconference formats in the deliv-
ery of concentrated exposure therapy can be a promising 
adaptation, especially when face-to-face treatment is dif-
ficult  due  to  COVID-19  restrictions,  geographical  dis-
tance, or challenges with in-person meetings. We found 
a substantial effect of treatment on PD severity (as meas-
ured  by  Panic  Disorder  Severity  Scale)  and  secondary 
measures  including  depression,  anxiety,  and  work  and 
social adjustment.

The  results  are  comparable  to  the  results  from  the 
B4DT  pilot  study  [18].  However,  the  PDSS  scores  from 
the  present  study  were  somewhat  higher  at  follow-up 
than  the  results  from  the  two  B4DT  replication  stud-
ies  [19,  20].  These  studies  were  conducted  with  highly 
experienced  B4DT-therapists  and  before  the  COVID-
19  pandemic.  In  contrast,  the  current  study  was  con-
ducted  during  the  pandemic  and  included  26  different 
therapists. We also found a substantial effect on BSQ and 
MI,  although  the  effect  was  somewhat  smaller  than  for 

PDSS. This is consistent with previous studies that have 
reported  lower  effect  sizes  for  MI  and  BSQ  compared 
to PDSS [37]. There should also be noted that the PDSS 
is  administered  by  clinicians,  while  the  PDSS  was  self-
report,  which  may  have  influenced  the  reporting.  Since 
MI  measures  mobility  in  different  settings,  the  fact  that 
the  treatment  was  conducted  under  COVID-19  restric-
tions, which limited the ability to visit public places alone 
or with others, may have affected the results. BSQ which 
assesses  fear  for  bodily  sensations,  may  also  have  been 
affected by the COVID-19 period, where there may have 
been  more  anxiety  about  bodily  sensations,  since  the 
listed symptoms might also be symptoms of COVID-19. 
BSQ,  which  assesses  fear  of  bodily  sensations,  may  also 
have  been  influenced  by  the  COVID-19  period.  During 
this  time,  there  may  have  been  increased  anxiety  about 
bodily sensations, as some of the listed symptoms could 
also  be  symptoms  of  COVID-19.  Further  studies  should 
therefore be done in different settings to explore the pos-
sible effect of PDSS of MI and BSQ.

The  difference  in  results  may  be  related  to  the  pan-
demic  and  some  reports  indicate  that  there  has  been  a 
significant  increase  in  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depres-
sion  during  the  pandemic  [38,  39].  Still,  we  did  not  find 
increased  baseline  symptoms  in  our  sample  when  com-
paring  symptoms  of  PD  prior  to  treatment  to  the  pre-
vious  studies.  There  is  also  a  chance  that  the  pandemic 
might  have  affected  the  consolidation  period  following 
the treatment. In contrast to studies pre-COVID we did 
find  a  reduction  in  remission  rate  from  post-treatment 
(72.1%)  to  follow-up  (62.3%),  and  long-time  follow-up 
of  this  sample  is  thus  warranted.  Some  patients  with 
PD  may  also  be  more  vulnerable  for  relapse  during  the 
COVID-pandemic, since the virus affects the respiratory 
system  which  also  is  where  the  fear  originates  for  many 
PD-patients [40].

Overall  the  results  are  consistent  with  previous  litera-
ture  showing  that  traditional  CBT  for  anxiety  disorder 
could  be  equally  effective  when  delivered  in  a  combina-
tion of videoconferencing and face-to-face [25, 26]. Our 
findings show that concentrated CBT such as the B4DT 
can  be  adapted  to  include  videoconferencing,  although

the results are somewhat lower than in previous studies 
on B4DT. There is still need for more studies to establish 
the  effectiveness  of  B4DT,  but  it  seems  to  be  a  promis-
ing  CBT-format  in  the  treatment  of  severe  anxiety  dis-
orders such as panic disorder [18, 19], and for obsessive 
compulsive  disorder  [13–17,  41].  The  structure  of  the 
B4DT  may  also  increase  adherence  and  facilitate  thera-
pist  competency,  as  it  involves  multiple  check  in  with 
colleagues, observation by colleagues, and almost contin-
uous monitoring of the entire treatment by both patients 
and therapists.

As the present study is a naturalistic report from ordi-
nary  mental  health  care,  and  as  is  common  in  settings 
like this, it has its limitations. There was no comparison 
group and thus we could not compare our results directly 
to  treatment  as  usual  or  other  treatments  for  PD.  The 
study  also  has  a  low  number  of  participants,  that  could 
enhance the effect size-estimates, thus overestimating the 
effectiveness  of  the  treatment.  We  note  that  even  if  the 
results  are  highly  encouraging,  there  is  not  yet  an  RCTs 
comparing B4DT for PD with other active treatment for-
mats and thus not a basis to draw conclusions regarding 
the relative effectiveness of different formats compared to 
each other. The study did not include measures of treat-
ment fidelity and competence, adherence, or compliance, 
and  therefore  could  not  investigate  if  variation  in  these 
variables  was  related  to  outcome.  The  high  number  of 
therapists  caused  by  the  concurrent  implementation  of 
B4DT,  could  also  affect  the  therapist  competency  and 
accumulated  experience  of  each  therapist.  On  the  other 
side,  as  there  are  3–6  therapists  in  each  group  working 
together,  this  may  increase  adherence  to  the  treatment 
manual. A strength of the treatment is the delivery in an 
outpatient  clinic  during  the  COVID-pandemic,  which 
may strengthen the ecological validity of the findings. In 
relation to the assessment aspect, it is important to high-
light  that  the  study  lacks  inter-rater  assessment  for  the 
clinically  administered  instruments.  Additionally,  it  is 
worth noting that the clinicians involved in the treatment 
were  responsible  for  conducting  the  three-month  PDSS 
interviews, which raises the possibility of their influence 
on the patients’ responses. These assessment procedures 
impose limitations on the conclusions that can be drawn 
from  the  study.  In  the  future,  long-term  follow-up  and 
more  strictly  controlled  studies,  preferably  with  active 
controls are warranted.

Conclusion
The  current  study  supports  B4DT  as  an  effective  treat-
ment  for  PD,  even  when  delivered  in  a  combination  of 
videoconference and face-to-face meetings. We conclude 

that  it  seem  both  feasible  and  useful  to  deliver  concen-
trated exposure therapy by hybrid formats.
