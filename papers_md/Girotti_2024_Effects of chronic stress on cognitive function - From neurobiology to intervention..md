Exposure to chronic stress contributes considerably to the development of cognitive impairments in psychiatric 
disorders such as depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post- 
traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),  and  addictive  behavior.  Unfortunately,  unlike  mood-related  symptoms, 
cognitive impairments are not effectively treated by available therapies, a situation in part resulting from a still 
incomplete  knowledge  of  the  neurobiological  substrates  that  underly  cognitive  domains  and  the  difficulty  in 
generating interventions that are both efficacious and safe.

In this review, we will present an overview of the cognitive domains affected by stress with a specific focus on 
cognitive flexibility, behavioral inhibition, and working memory. We will then consider the effects of stress on 
neuronal  correlates  of  cognitive  function  and  the  factors  which  may  modulate  the  interaction  of  stress  and 
cognition. Finally, we will discuss intervention strategies for treatment of stress-related disorders and gaps in 
knowledge with emerging new treatments under development.

Understanding how cognitive impairment occurs during exposure to chronic stress is crucial to make progress 

towards the development of new and effective therapeutic approaches.

1. Introduction

Stress is a prominent part of modern life. Humans, like other species, 
have  evolved  adaptive  mechanisms  to  limit  the  physiological  or  psy-
chological impact of stress. However, exposure to traumatic or cumu-
lative  stressors  can  considerably  contribute  to  the  development  of 
psychiatric disorders such as, depression, generalized anxiety disorder 
(GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD), and addictive behavior (Adams et al., 2018; Maeng and 
Milad 2017; Patriquin and Mathew 2017; Siegrist 2008; Sinha 2008). 
Indeed,  a  recent  article  reported  that  cases  of  depression  alone  were 
3-fold  higher  during 
to 
pre-pandemic data (Ettman et al., 2020).

the  COVID-19  pandemic  compared 

Cognitive impairment is a transdiagnostic domain shared by multiple 
psychiatric  disorders,  including  stress-related  disorders  (Millan  et  al., 
2012); for example, abnormalities in various cognitive functions such as 
cognitive  flexibility,  working  memory  and  behavioral  inhibition  have 
been documented in depression, PTSD and substance use disorder (Dossi 
et al., 2020; Ramey and Regier 2019; Snyder 2013), and a large body of 
evidence suggests that stress exacerbates cognitive impairments (Lupien 

et al., 2009). Unfortunately, unlike mood-related symptoms, cognitive 
impairments are not effectively treated by currently available therapies, 
and  large  gaps  still  exist  in  both  identifying  the  neurobiological  sub-
strates  that  underly  cognitive  domains  and  in  developing  effective 
interventions.

In this review, we will present an overview of the cognitive domains 
affected by stress with a specific focus on cognitive flexibility, behav-
ioral inhibition, and working memory. We will then specify how these 
cognitive domains are affected by acute and chronic stress (see Table 1
for a summary of relevant literature). Sex differences will be discussed if 
reported in the original paper, however, for an in-depth analysis of the 
interaction of sex and stress on cognitive function we refer the reader to 
recent  focused  reviews  (Bangasser  and  Kawasumi  2015;  Orsini  et  al., 
2022;  Swaab  and  Bao  2020;  Wellman  et  al.,  2020).  Finally,  we  will 
discuss intervention strategies for treatment of stress-related disorders 
and  gaps  in  knowledge  with  emerging  new  treatments  under 
development.

Overall, it is vital to understand the relationship between the effects 
of  stress  on  the  brain  and  how  cognitive  impairment  occurs  during 
exposure to chronic stress. Through better understanding of mechanisms 
underlying the relationship between stress and cognition, new avenues

2.1. Physiological response to stress

2. A brief overview of stress neurobiology

The neuroendocrine stress response is a remarkably well-conserved 
homeostatic  process  from  amphibians  to  mammals,  a  fact  that  un-
derscores its essential role in species survival and adaptation (Sapolsky 
2021).  Indeed,  the  response  to  stress  is  fundamentally  an  adaptive 
phenomenon directed toward the reallocation of physiological resources 
in response to an external or internal stimulus that has threatened ho-
meostasis.  This  process  of  active  adaptation  through  mobilization  of 
neuroendocrine  and  immune  mechanisms  has  been  called  allostasis 
(Sterling and Eyer, 1988. Allostatic load refers to the cost of this reba-
lancing process for the organism. In situations of acute or sporadic stress 
exposure, the cost is low and transient. However, in situations where 
either the stressor is persistent or the organism is debilitated, the pro-
longed  engagement  or  overstimulation  of  allostatic  systems  causes  a 
physiological burden that may lead to disease (McEwen 1998).

As an example, in socially complex species such as humans and non- 
human primates, the stress response can be activated and sustained in 
the absence of an “actual” contingent stressor, in part as a reaction to 
negative past experiences or in anticipation of negative future events. 
Such chronic engagement of the stress response system has been asso-
ciated with an array of health disturbances, including cardiovascular, 
immunological, and reproductive dysfunction and increased incidence 
of stress-related psychiatric disorders (Sapolsky 2021). Thus, the current 
view  is  that  stress-related  pathologies  develop  from  the  unnecessary, 
excessive, or over-lasting activation of the stress response system that 
takes a toll on organism physiology. Fortunately, given the conservation 
of  the  stress  response  across  species,  it  is  possible  to  investigate  the 
mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive stress response, including ef-
fects on cognitive function, in animal models designed for high trans-
lational validity.

For reasons of space, we will only briefly introduce the basic con-
cepts of autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to stress. We refer the 
interested reader to comprehensive reviews on the subject (Carrier et al., 
2021; Godoy et al., 2018; Gray et al., 2017; Hassamal 2023; McEwen 
and Akil 2020).

Acute stress can be defined as a real or perceived temporary chal-
lenge to the organism ability to maintain homeostasis and can be either 
physiological  or  psychological  in  nature.  The  organism  responds  to 
acute stress by rapidly mobilizing the autonomic and neuroendocrine 
systems, producing physiological changes that facilitate the response to 
the threat and the return to homeostasis. Autonomic system activation 
releases epinephrine (E, secreted by the adrenal medulla) and norepi-
nephrine (NE, from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves) that 
act on peripheral adrenergic receptors. Additionally, catecholamines are 
released  within  the  brain where  they activate  central  nervous  system 
receptors.  Acute  catecholamine  effects  are  short-lived,  disappearing 
within 1 h (Tank and Lee Wong 2015), and include cardiovascular ac-
tions, metabolic resource allocation and sustained alertness.

The  neuroendocrine  response 

is  under  the  control  of  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis  (HPA  axis).  Within  this  system, 
glucocorticoids  (cortisol  in  humans  and  corticosterone  in  rodents, 
CORT)  are  released  by  the  adrenal  cortex  in  response  to  circulating 
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH),  released  by  the  anterior  pitui-
tary.  Release  of  ACTH  is  in  turn  elicited  by  corticotropin-releasing 
hormone (CRH or CRF) produced by parvocellular neurons of the par-
aventricular  nucleus  of  the  hypothalamus  (PVN).  In  contrast  to 
catecholamine-driven  responses,  glucocorticoid  effects  can  be  both 
rapid  (within  minutes  after  the  stimulus)  and  long-lasting.  The  long- 
term effects develop over several hours and include transcriptional ef-
fects of activated glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and epigenetic effects, 
such  as  methylation  changes  in  target  genes  (Gray  et  al.,  2017;  Tho-
massin et al., 2001). Glucocorticoids can also bind to and exert activities 
through  the  mineralocorticoid  receptors  (MRs)  (de  Kloet  2013).

Neurobiology of Stress 33 (2024) 100670 

Glucocorticoids  participate  in  the  termination  of  the  stress  response 
through a negative feedback process mediated by GRs that reduces the 
secretion of CRH in the PVN and ACTH in the pituitary to limit the ef-
fects  of  these  hormones  (Keller-Wood  and  Dallman  1984).  Negative 
feedback  mechanisms  include  transcriptional  effects  that  are  both 
ligand-dependent (Lachize et al., 2009; McKay and Cidlowski 1998) and 
ligand-independent (Rainville et al., 2019), as well as signaling effects 
via membrane-bound GRs (Di et al., 2003). Finally, the HPA axis has a 
prominent circadian and ultradian rhythms that play an important role 
in the organism’s health (Lightman et al., 2020; Yao and Silver 2022).
With prolonged and/or intense stress exposure (chronic stress), the 
physiological  burden  to  reinstate  allostasis  may  produce  detrimental 
consequences  for  the  organism.  Chronic  secretion  of  glucocorticoids 
decreases GR expression in the brain which results in reduced negative 
feedback  and  dysregulation  of  the  HPA  axis  (for  review  see  (Herman 
et al., 2016; Tsigos et al., 2000)).

Because of lowered GR levels, CRH levels increase and the balance 
between MR and GR expression is changed; these alterations affect the 
function of other brain areas, notably the prefrontal cortex and hippo-
campus,  and  may  underlie  the  emotional  and  cognitive  impairments 
produced by chronic stress.

2.2. Impact of stress hormones on cognitive function

Indeed, persistent elevation of CORT or CRF has been associated with 
cognitive  impairment  especially  in  hippocampal  dependent  memory 
tasks (De Alcubierre et al., 2023; Henckens et al., 2016; Spannenburg 
and Reed 2023). For example, exposure to elevated glucocorticoids, in 
healthy humans produces reversible impairments in verbal declarative 
memory (Newcomer et al., 1999). In patients with Cushing Syndrome, a 
disorder characterized by hypercortisolemia, the most frequent cogni-
tive  symptoms  reported  are  impaired  memory  (83%)  and  shortened 
attention span (66%) (Starkman 2013). Possible mechanisms leading to 
these impairments were suggested by early animal studies showing that 
chronic stress or chronic glucocorticoid exposure produced hippocam-
pal and cortical atrophy, shorter dendritic branches and alterations in 

neurotransmitter levels (Cerqueira et al. 2005a, 2005b; Liston and Gan 
2011;  Magarinos  et  al.,  1996;  Radley  et  al.,  2006;  Wellman  2001). 
Measures  of  hippocampal  volume  in  humans  receiving  high  doses  of 
glucocorticoids have yielded mixed results with some studies showing 
decreases in volume (Bermond et al., 2005; Brown et al., 2004; Wilner 
et al., 2002) and others finding no change (Coluccia et al., 2008; Hajek 
et  al.,  2006).  In  Cushing’s  patients  smaller  hippocampal  and  cortical 
volumes were found to correlate with longer disease duration (Bauduin 
et al., 2020; Bourdeau et al., 2002; Starkman et al., 1992). Low gluco-
corticoids levels  also produce  impaired cognition, especially in visual 
memory and attention, as it has been shown in individuals with adrenal 
insufficiency  and  with  Addison’s  disease  (Klement  et  al.,  2009;  Tie-
mensma  et  al.,  2016).  In  rodents,  adrenalectomy  casues  dendritic 
retraction in the mPFC (Cerqueira et al., 2007b). Thus, glucocorticoids 
effects on brain function follow an inverted-U relationship (Joels 2006), 
where  both  low  and  high  levels  of  glucocorticoids  produce  deficits, 
brought  about  by  imbalanced  signaling  through  MR  and  GR.  Indeed, 
several pharmacological studies with agonists and antagonists of GR and 
MR have revealed the importance of each receptor in cognitive function 
(Otte et al., 2007; Piber et al., 2016; Vogel et al., 2016; Wingenfeld and 
Otte 2019; Yalin et al., 2021; Young et al., 2004). For a recent review see 
(de Kloet and Joels 2023).

Elevated CRH following chronic stress also has negative effects on 
cognition that are mainly mediated by CRFR1 receptors (Henckens et al., 
2016;  Maras  and  Baram  2012;  Uribe-Marino  et  al.,  2016).  Similar  to 
glucocorticoids,  elevated  CRH  produces  cortical  and  hippocampal 
plasticity  changes,  spine  actin  depolarization,  selective  loss  of  spines, 
and  detrimental  effects  on  learning  and  memory  (Chen  et  al.,  2013; 
Wang et al., 2011).

2.3. Rodent models of chronic stress

Various  rodent  models  of  chronic  stress  have  been  developed  and 
shown to produce behavioral and neuronal changes recapitulating ele-
ments of core symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders, or other stress- 
dependent psychophysiological disorders (for comprehensive reviews,

see (Buynitsky and Mostofsky 2009; Qiao et al., 2016). As prenatal and 
early life stress are addressed elsewhere in this issue, here we will focus 
on adult stress.

Adult life stress is a well-recognized risk factor for psychopathology, 
and several rodent models have been developed to study this. Here, we 
will focus on 3 types of adult chronic stress: repeated restraint, chronic 
intermittent cold stress and chronic unpredictable stress.

Repeated restraint stress has been used as a model of chronic stress 
since the early 1980s, initially to examine homotypic stress habituation 
of the adrenergic system, HPA axis, and c-Fos activation in the brain, 
phenomena that arise within 4–6 days of exposure (Cole et al., 2000; 
Girotti et al., 2006; Stone and Platt 1982; Watanabe et al., 1994). Studies 
investigating the duration of stress protocols as a variable revealed that 
distinct brain regions exhibit differential responses to varying lengths of 
stress exposure. Daily sessions of restraint stress as short as one week 
(Brown  et  al.,  2005;  Garrett  and  Wellman  2009)  caused  dendritic 
remodeling in the mPFC, whereas a longer duration of the same stress 
procedure was necessary to observe morphological changes in the hip-
pocampus. For example, Qiao et al., (2014) demonstrated a reduction in 
apical spine density in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 only when employing 
daily restraint stress for at least 3 weeks. Similarly, Watanabe and col-
legues (1992) reported apical dendritic retraction in CA3 after 3 weeks, 
the only time point they examined. McLaughlin and collegues (2007) 
found that 6 h of restraint for 21 days caused dendritic retraction in CA3, 
whereas 2 h of restraint stress for 21 days, 2 h for 10 days, and 6 h for 10 
days did not. In conclusion, morphology in the PFC appears to be more 
sensitive to stress than morphology in the hippocampus.

Additionally, repeated restraint has been shown to decrease sucrose 
preference (Mao et al., 2022), and increase aggression, allodynia, and 
inflammatory pain (Bardin et al., 2009; Wood et al., 2003).

Chronic intermittent cold stress (CIC stress) is a homotypic chronic 
metabolic  stressor  that  reproduces  behavioral  and  functional  changes 
paralleling those found in psychiatric disorders. For example, CIC stress 
has  been  shown  to  sensitize  the  HPA  axis  response  (Ma  and  Morilak 
2005),  sensitize  noradrenergic  reactivity  (Pardon  et  al.,  2003),  alter 
prefrontal  and  hypothalamic  neuronal  activity  (Acosta  et  al.,  1993; 
Correll  et  al.,  2005;  Moore  et  al.,  2001),  change  spine  and  dendritic 
morphology  in  the  orbitofrontal  cortex  (Adler  et  al.,  2020),  sensitize 
neuroimmune  activity  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  and  hypothalamus 
(Girotti et al., 2011) and increase microglia-induced neuroinflammation 
in the hippocampus (Lang et al., 2020).

Another widely used chronic stress paradigm is chronic unpredict-
able stress. First developed by Katz and colleagues (Katz et al., 1981) as a 
3 week variable stress paradigm that included severe stressors such as 
footshock,  cold  swimming,  and  immobilization,  this  paradigm  was 
subsequently modified by Willner and coworkers (Willner et al., 1987) 
who substituted the severe stressors with milder ones, to better repro-
duce the human experience of daily, light but persistent stress exposure. 
Other  variants  of  the  CUS/CMS  paradigm  have  also  been  developed 
(Banasr et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011). CUS/CMS induces a spectrum of 
behavioral abnormalities in rodents that parallel depressive symptoms 
including changes in reward sensitivity, decreased motivation, reduced 
grooming, and sleep changes. For a comprehensive review, see (Willner 
2005). Along with behavioral effects, chronic unpredictable stress also 
causes  structural  changes,  such  as  dendritic  morphology  and  spine 
changes (Dias-Ferreira et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011).

3. Effects of stress on executive function

3.1. Cognitive flexibility

Cognitive flexibility can be defined as the ability of an individual to 
adapt their behavior to a changing environment or the ability to sup-
press old information in order to learn new information. Indeed, a lack 
of cognitive flexibility often leads to perseverance of behaviors that are 
no  longer  beneficial,  or  the  inability  to  learn  a  new  set  of  “rules.” 

5 

Cognitive flexibility is often dysfunctional in patients with stress-related 
disorders,  including  depression  and  PTSD,  where  biased  attention  to 
perceived threats, ruminative focus on negative outcomes and persev-
erative  behaviors  are  often  a  main  symptom  of  the  disorder  (Clancy 
et al., 2016; Disner et al., 2011). For example, reduced cognitive flexi-
bility shortly after a stressful or traumatic event is predictive of PSTD 
symptom severity a full year later (Ben-Zion et al., 2018). Two examples 
of cognitive flexibility that have been studied in relation to stress will be 
discussed  in  this  review:  reversal  learning  and  extradimensional  set 
shifting.

3.1.1. Rodent models of cognitive flexibility

Several rodent models of cognitive flexibility exist, many of which 
were  originally  based  on  human  tests,  such  as  the  Wisconsin  Card 
Sorting Test (Merriam et al., 1999) or the Cambridge Neuropsycholog-
ical Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). One example is the attentional 
set-shifting  task  (AST)  developed  by  Birrel  and  Brown  (Birrell  and 
Brown 2000) as a rodent analogue of the ID/ED sub-test of the CANTAB 
cognitive test  battery developed  by  Sahakian and Robbins  for human 
and non-human primates (Robbins et al., 1998). Both reversal learning 
and set shifting are evaluated in this test. Briefly, in the AST, rats dig for 
a  food  reward  in  small  pots  defined  by  cues  along  two  stimulus  di-
mensions: the material with which they are filled (sawdust, beads, etc) 
and an odor with which they are scented. The rats must learn which of 
these dimensions is relevant for locating the reward, and then which cue 
within that dimension is associated with the reward. After mastering a 
given contingency, the rules are changed, and the rat must learn a new 
association. For instance, the odor clove signals reward at first and the 
odor nutmeg does not; after mastering this discrimination, the rule is 
switched, whereby nutmeg is now associated with the reward, and clove 
is not (a Reversal). Subjects are then required to learn this new rule until 
they meet a predefined criterion. During this phase, subjects will pro-
duce  errors  that  can  be  broadly  classified  as  “perseverative,”  i.e., 
persistent responses according to the obsolete rule, or “regressive,” i.e., 
relapses back to the old contingency after a series of correct responses. 
After  a  series  of  such  tests  in  which  the  same  stimulus  dimension  is 
informative regardless of how the rules are changed, the animals form a 
cognitive set, or a strategy that guides them in adapting to subsequent 
changes. Then, in the extra-dimensional (ED) cognitive set-shift portion 
of the test, odor is no longer the relevant dimension, but becomes the 
distractor, and the digging medium becomes the cue that signals reward. 
Thus, the animal must abandon the strategy of using odor as a guide and 
pay attention to tactile information instead. Cognitive flexibility in both 
reversal and set-shifting is measured by how readily the animal is able to 
suppress  the  old  information  and  learn  the  new  rule.  More  recently, 
operant-based  systems  to  measure  reversal  learning  and  set  shifiting 
have  been  developend  for  rats  and  mice,  using  operant  boxes  with 
retractable levers (Brady and Floresco 2015; Floresco et  al., 2008) or 
touchscreen pads (Turner et al., 2017).

3.1.2. Brain areas and circuits in reversal learning

Human imaging studies show increased activity in medial prefrontal 
areas  (Boehme  et  al.,  2017;  Cools  et  al.,  2002),  orbitofrontal  areas 
(Ghahremani et al., 2010; Remijnse et al., 2006), parietal cortex, insula 
and  cingulate  cortex  during  reversal  tasks  (Yaple  and  Yu  2019).  The 
orbitofrontal  cortex  is  especially  important  for  reversal  learning,  as 
evidenced  in  human  studies  (Hampshire  et  al.,  2012),  and  in  a  large 
body  of  animal  lesion  studies,  including  monkeys  (Dias  et  al.,  1996), 
mice  (Bissonette  et  al.,  2008)  and  rats  (McAlonan  and  Brown  2003). 
Other  brain  regions  important  for  reversal  learning  are  the  striatum 
(Cools et  al., 2002; Rogers et al., 2000b), amygdala (Izquierdo et  al., 
2013;  Schoenbaum  et  al.,  2003),  and  the  hippocampus  (Mala  et  al., 
2015).  Lesions  in  the  ventral  mid-thalamus  (rhomboid  and  reuniens 
nuclei)  and  mediodorsal  thalamus  have  also  been  shown  to  impair 
reversal learning (Chudasama et al., 2001; Linley et al., 2016). Recently, 
efforts have been directed at defining specific connectivity between the 

M. Girotti et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Neurobiology of Stress 33 (2024) 100670 

areas that functionally mediate reversal. Studies in humans and rodents 
show that major projection pathways involved in reversal include cor-
ticostriatal, thalamocortical, and cortico-amygdalar pathways. Thus, in 
human MRI studies, probabilistic reversal learning was associated with 
functional  connectivity  between  the  lateral  orbitofrontal  cortex  and 
ventral striatum (Morris et al., 2016b). In rats, optogenetically inducing 
long-term potentiation (opto-LTP) in a MDT to orbitofrontal projection 
produces deficits in reversal learning (Adler et al., 2020). In an elegant 
study using selective viral ablation, Groman and colleagues showed that 
OFC-amygdala-striatal  pathways  mediate  different  aspects  of 
value-reward  encoding  during  a  probabilistic  reversal  test.  Rats  with 
ablation of an OFC to nucleus accumbens projection showed deficits in 
reversal due to the inability to use negative outcomes to guide subse-
quent behaviors. By contrast, the ablation of an amygdala projection to 
OFC  created  deficits  by  not  allowing  rats  to  learn  from  positive  out-
comes.  Interestingly,  ablation  of  the  reciprocal  projection  (OFC  to 
amygdala)  enhanced  reversal  (Groman  et  al.,  2019).  These  nuanced 
outcomes may explain the inconsistencies in early reports of the effects 
of  amygdala  lesions  on  reversal  learning  (Izquierdo  et  al.,  2013; 
Schoenbaum et al., 2003; Stalnaker et al., 2007), and indicate the ne-
cessity of circuit-level analyses to precisely dissect the anatomical cor-
relates of reversal.

3.1.3. Neurochemical modulation of reversal learning

Glucocorticoids and CRH. Few studies have addressed the effects of 
elevated stress hormones on reversal learning; however, available evi-
dence  suggests  that  altered  stress  hormone  signaling  can  negatively 
impact  reversal  learning.  Thus,  mice  in  which  the  MR/GR  balance  is 
altered by overexpression of MR and underexpression of GR show def-
icits in reversal tasks and increased perseveration (Harris et al., 2013). In 
rats, blockade of CRFR1 in the prefrontal cortex prevents stress-induced 
deficits in temporal order memory and reversal learning (Uribe-Marino 
et al., 2016).

Serotonin. Ample evidence points to the involvement of serotonergic 
signaling  in  the  OFC  in  reversal.  Depletion  of  serotonin  either  by 
removal of dietary tryptophan, 5-7-DHT lesions or use of the tryptophan 
hydroxylase  depleting  agent  PCPA  impairs  reversal  in  humans,  non- 
human  primates,  and  rats  (Clarke  et  al.,  2007;  Lapiz-Bluhm  et  al., 
2009; Rogers et al., 1999). Receptor-specific manipulations with sero-
tonin  receptor  antagonists  or  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  suggest  a 
complex picture of regulation. Antagonism of 5HT2A receptors impairs 
performance (Furr et al., 2012; Hervig et al., 2020), whereas antagonism 
of 5HT2C receptor facilitates reversal (Boulougouris et al., 2008; Nilsson 
et  al.,  2012),  indicating  a  specificity  in  serotonergic  modulation  of 
reversal. In general, however, reduced serotonergic signaling in the OFC 
seems  to  be  associated  with  increased  perseveration  (Clarke  et  al., 
2004).

Dopamine. The importance of dopaminergic transmission in reversal 
behavior has been well documented, especially after extensive training 
on reversal learning, when the likelihood of reversal is “expected” (Costa 
et al., 2015; Klanker et al., 2015). There seems to be regional specificity 
to  the  effects  of  dopamine  on  reversal  learning.  Unlike  serotonin, 
depleting dopamine in the OFC does not affect reversal learning (Clarke 
et al., 2007), whereas depletion in the striatum impairs reversal learning 
(Clarke et al., 2011). In human studies, increased dopaminergic activity 
in  the  striatum  correlated  with  optimal  reversal  learning  (Clatworthy 
et al., 2009). Both D1 and D2 receptor subtypes are involved in modu-
lating reversal learning in humans, non-human primates, and rodents 
(Boulougouris  et  al.,  2009;  Izquierdo  et  al.,  2006;  Lee  et  al.,  2007; 
Marino  et  al.,  2022;  Mehta  et  al.,  2001;  Smith  et  al.,  1999;  van  der 
Schaaf et al., 2014). Recent evidence supports the notion that the dif-
ferential role of D1 or D2 receptors in reversal may be region-specific 
(Sala-Bayo et al., 2020; Verharen et al., 2019).

Glutamate. Glutamate transmission in specific areas of the OFC is also 
implicated in visual reversal learning (Hervig et al., 2020), but little is 
involved.  Subchronic 
known  regarding 

the  specific  receptors 

administration of the NMDAR antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) produces 
impairments in reversal learning (Abdul-Monim et al., 2007), but sub-
sequent  analyses  reported  no  stable  effect  of  PCP  on  reversal  (but 
reproducible negative effects  on set-shifting) (Janhunen et al., 2015). 
Given  the  diversity  of  glutamate  receptors  and  signaling  modes,  it  is 
likely that more selective targeting of receptors or receptor subunits is 
required  to  clarify  the  involvement  of  glutamatergic  transmission  in 
reversal. In this vein, a role for the metabotropic receptor mGluR5 seems 
indicated by the fact that mGluR5 knockout mice display impaired vi-
sual reversal (Lim et al., 2019). Additionally, multiple studies have re-
ported that antagonism or gene deletion of NMDA receptor subunit 2B 
(GluN2B) in OFC and dorsal striatum impairs reversal learning (Brigman 
et  al.,  2013;  Dalton  et  al.,  2011;  Thompson  et  al.,  2015a).  Further 
investigation  is  necessary  to  better  understand  the  role  of  glutamate 
signaling in reversal.

3.1.4. Stress effects on reversal learning

Human  studies.  Acute  stress  has  been  associated  with  both  better 
performance in reversal learning (Wieland et al., 2023), as well as im-
pairments (Raio et al., 2017) Conversely, early life stress and chronic 
adult  stress  impair  reversal  learning.  For  example,  in  healthy  young 
adults,  early  life  stress  correlates  with  increased  perseveration  on  a 
reversal task and increased propensity for increased alcohol use (Franco 
and Knowlton 2023). In an adolescent cohort with a history of early life 
stress, individuals with higher life stress scores had more difficulty in 
updating  contingencies  during  reversal  learning  tasks  (Harms  et  al., 
2018). In  a study  that used a  modified  reversal  learing task  to assess 
sensitivity  to  punishement  and  reward,  adult  females  with  high 
self-reported chronic stress showed increased perseverative errors in the 
punishment condition and reduced punishment sensitivity in the reward 
condition (Monni et al., 2023). Moreover, reversal learning deficits have 
been documented in several stress-related psychiatric disorders such as 
major depressive disorder (where it was accompanied by abnormalities 
in  the  OFC)  obsessive  compulsive  disorder,  and  generalized  anxiety 
disorder (Drevets 2007; Szabo et al., 2013), and in individuals repeat-
edly exposed to traumatic events (Levy-Gigi and Richter-Levin 2014).

Rodent studies. In rats, acute stress is generally associated with better 
performance in reversal learning (Bryce and Howland 2015; Graybeal 
et  al.,  2011;  Thai  et  al.,  2013).  In  contrast,  early  life  stress  impaired 
reversal learning in female mice, and this was associated with increased 
expression  and  density  of  parvalbumin  expressing  neurons  in  OFC 
(Goodwill  et  al.,  2018).  Chronic  intermittent  cold  stress  in  adult  rats 
results in robust deficits in olfactory reversal learning task (Danet et al., 
2010; Donegan et al., 2014; Furr et al., 2012; Lapiz-Bluhm et al., 2009; 
Patton et al., 2017; Wallace et al., 2014). Reversal impairments are also 
observed after two weeks of chronic unpredictable stress in both olfac-
tory and spatial reversal tasks (Bondi et al. 2007, 2010; Hill et al., 2005; 
Jett et al., 2015; Jett and Morilak 2013; Quan et al., 2011; Yu et al., 
2016). Mechanistically, chronic stress has been shown to decrease the 
levels of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and reduce activation of its 
downstream effector JAK2 in the OFC. Restoration of CNTF levels within 
this brain region was sufficient to correct the effects of stress on reversal 
learning  (Girotti  et  al.,  2019).  Functionally,  chronic  stress  effects  on 
reversal learning can be recapitulated by optogenetically inducing long 
term-potentiation  (opto-LTP)  in  the  OFC;  conversely,  chronic  stress 
deficits are ameliorated by optogenetic long term depression (opto-LTD) 
in the OFC (Adler et al., 2020). Interestingly, JAK signaling is involved 
in hippocampal LTD (McGregor et al., 2017; Nicolas et al., 2012), and it 
is possible that this signaling pathway is also implicated in establishing 
LTD  in  the  OFC.  Taken  together,  these  data  support  the  notion  that 
optimal reversal learning is associated with long-term depression in the 
OFC,  in  part  mediated  by  CNTF/JAK  signaling,  that  enables  flexible 
behavior. In support of this idea, it is worth noting that depotentiation is 
associated with other forms of reversal; for example, temporary depot-
entiation  in  the  hippocampus  accompanies  spatial  reversal  learning 
(Dong et al., 2013; Duffy et al., 2008; Mills et al., 2014; Morice et al.,

M. Girotti et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Neurobiology of Stress 33 (2024) 100670 

2007). Conversely, stress may produce reversal deficits by inducing a 
state  of  increased  excitability  and  hyperactivity  in  the  OFC  that  pre-
cludes  the  depotentiation  necessary  for  optimal  reversal.  Indeed,  this 
possibility is supported by morphological evidence that chronic stress 
associated with behavioral inflexibility produces hyper-elaboration and 
increased dendritic length and spine numbers in the OFC (Adler et al., 
2020; Liston et al., 2006).

3.1.5. Brain areas and circuits in set-shifting

Human  and  animal  studies  have  long  suggested  that  the  thalamo- 
fronto-striatal circuit is vital in set-shifting behavior. Prefrontal activ-
ity is associated with set-shifting performance in human subjects (Manes 
et al., 2002; Miller and Cohen 2001; Owen et al., 1991; Rogers et al., 
2000a;  Stuss  et  al.,  2000).  Animal  lesion  studies  indicate  that  mPFC 
damage  results  in  deficits  specifically  in  set-shifting  while  reversal 
learning remains unaffected (Birrell and Brown 2000; Bissonette et al., 
2008). Lesions of mediodorsal thalamus (Ouhaz et al., 2022) or ventral 
hippocampus (Mala et al., 2015; Placek et al., 2013) also produce def-
icits  in  set-shifting.  Optogenetically  inducing  long-term  depression 
specifically  within  MDT  terminals  in  the  mPFC  impairs  set-shifting 
(Bulin et al., 2020).

Recent  chemogenic  manipulation  using  designer  receptors  exclu-
sively  activated  by  designer  drugs  (DREADDs)  implicated  the  LC  in 
modulating the mPFC during set-shifting. Elevated activity in LC neu-
rons  projecting  specifically  to  mPFC  was  improved  set-shifting  and 
reduced  regressive  errors  (Cope  et  al.,  2019).  Further  studies  suggest 
that the LC may be important in “rule switching”, allowing the animals 
to acquire the new rule easier during set shifting (McBurney-Lin et al., 
2022).

3.1.6. Neurochemical modulation of set-shifting

Glucocorticoids  and  CRH.  Few  studies  have  addressed  the  role  of 
stress hormones in set-shifting. In humans, pharmacological stimulation 
of GR or MR does not have any effect on flexibility tasks (Deuter et al., 
2019;  Wingenfeld  et  al.,  2011).  However,  antagonizing  MR  with  spi-
ronolactone diminished set shifting performance in humans, suggesting 
a  potential  role  for  this  receptor  in  cognitive  flexibility  (Otte  et  al., 
2007).  CRH  effects  on  set-shifting  may  be  region-specific  and 
dose-dependent. In one study in rodents, intracerebral administration of 
CRH  impaired  set-shifting  with  an  inverted-U  dose  relationship. 
Conversely,  microinjection  into  the  locus  coeruleus  improved  perfor-
mance, (Snyder et al., 2012), consistent with evidence that CRH stim-
ulates NE release from the LC (Curtis et al., 1997) and that NE in the 
mPFC is required for optimal set-shifting (Lapiz and Morilak 2006).

Serotonin. Evidence suggests that, besides reversal, serotonin is also 
involved  in  set-shifting.  Serotonin  transporter  (SERT)  knockout  rats, 
which have increased extracellular serotonin, perform better than intact 
controls on set-shifting (Nonkes et al., 2012). However, in the opposite 
direction, serotonin depletion often has no effect on set-shifting (Clarke 
et al., 2005; Gallagher et al., 2003; Hughes et al., 2003). Serotonin re-
ceptor antagonists often ameliorate stress effects. For example, in rats, 
the  negative  effects  of  chronic  restraint  stress  on  set-shifting  were 
ameliorated  by  the  5-HT7  receptor  antagonist  amisulpride  (Hedlund 
2009; Hedlund et al., 2005; Leopoldo et al., 2011; Nikiforuk and Popik 
2013). The 5-HT6  receptor antagonists SB 271046 and sertindole were 
also shown to reduce deficits in set-shifting produced by PCP (Idris et al., 
2010; Rodefer et al., 2008).

Dopamine  and  Norepinephrine.  Dopamine  activity  in  the  mPFC  is 
required for optimal performance in set-shifting tasks. Thus, in monkeys, 
depletion of dopamine in the mPFC using 6-OHDA produced deficits in 
set-shifting  (Crofts  et  al.,  2001;  Robbins  and  Roberts  2007)  and  in 
humans increasing dopamine activity in the mPFC improved set-shifting 
(Apud et al., 2007). The role played by different dopamine receptors in 
this behavior is complex (Floresco 2013). For example, the D1 receptor 
antagonist SCH23390 infused within the mPFC impaired set-shifting in 
rats (Haluk and Floresco 2009; Ragozzino 2002), while mPFC infusions 

of  the  D4  antagonist L-745,870 improved  set-shifting  (McQuail et  al., 
2021).  Norepinephrine  also  contributes  to  attentional  set-shifting. 
Deafferentiation  of  noradrenergic  input  into  the  mPFC  results  in 
set-shifting  deficits  (McGaughy  et  al.,  2008;  Tait  et  al.,  2007).  In 
humans, tonic activity of noradrenergic neurons in the LC (assessed by 
pupillary dilation) facilitated set-shifting (Pajkossy et al., 2017). In an-
imals,  acute  activation  of  noradrenergic  signaling  in  the  mPFC  by 
administration of atomoxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine uptake 
inhibitor  (Newman  et  al.,  2008),  or  atipamezole,  an  α2-adrenergic 
autoreceptor antagonist (Bondi et al., 2010; Lapiz and Morilak 2006), 
both improved set-shifting.

Glutamate. Glutamate transmission is also implicated in set-shifting. 
Direct antagonism of AMPA or NMDA receptors, but not mGluR5, in the 
mPFC  produced  set-shifting  deficits  (Jett  et  al.,  2017).  By  contrast, 
systemic administration of the partial NMDA receptor agonist D-cyclo-
serine rescued set-shifting impairments induced by scopolamine (Siddik 
and  Fendt  2022).  Expression  of  the  GluA1  AMPA  receptor  subunit 
decreased  within  the  mPFC  of  stressed  animals  that  exhibited 
set-shifting deficits (Sun et al., 2022). Cortical expression of the NMDAR 
NR1 subunit is decreased in aged rats with set-shifting deficits (McQuail 
et  al.,  2021).  Electrophysiological  experiments  have  also  revealed 
increased AMPA/NMDA ratios on fast-spiking interneurons in the mPFC 
of aged rats with set-shifting deficits (McQuail et al., 2021).

3.1.7. Stress effects on set-shifting

Human studies. In humans, not many studies have addressed the ef-
fect  of stress  on  set-shifting  using the  Wisconsin Card  test  (WCST) or 
CANTAB tests and the results seem variable. For example, in one study 
using  the  WCST,  acute  stress  did  not  impact  cognitive  flexibility 
(Hendrawan et al., 2012), whereas in another study using a virtual TSST 
and a variant of the WCST, investigators reported improved cognitive 
flexibility (Delahaye et al., 2015). In work comparing sexes, it was found 
that acute stress reduced cognitive flexibility measured with the WCST 
in males but not in females (Kalia et al., 2018; Shields et al., 2016). In 
other studies using tests of cognitive flexibility other than the WCST, 
some investigators have reported a negative impact of acute stress on 
this  cognitive  domain  and  no  difference  between  males  and  females 
(Alexander et al., 2007; Hillier et al., 2006). In the few studies evalu-
ating chronic stress, the data collected with tests other than the WCST 
suggest  that  high  perceived  stress  correlates  with  set-shifting  deficits 
(Orem et al., 2008). Early life stress stress also correlated with decreased 
cognitive flexibility in adulthood, especially in individuals with a high 
degree  of  self-reported  ongoing  stress  (Kalia  and  Knauft  2020;  Kalia 
et al., 2021).

Rodent studies. In rodent studies, the  effects of  acute stress  on set- 
shifting  are  dependent  on  the  type of  stress  the  subject  is  exposed to 
prior to the set-shifting test. For example, a 15-min tail pinch is sufficient 
to produce deficits in set-shifting, but not reversal learning (Butts et al., 
2013), while a 30-min acute restraint stress does not alter set-shifting 
(Thai  et  al.,  2013).  Additionally,  a  single  prolonged  stress  paradigm 
(SPS) in which rats are acutely exposed to multiple stressors within a 
short  time  (a  common  model  for  PTSD),  also  resulted  in  set-shifting 
deficits (George et al., 2015). This suggests there may be a “threshold” 
above which acute stress produces set-shifting deficits. Subjects exposed 
to  chronic  restraint  stress  or  CUS  consistently  exhibit  deficits  in 
set-shifting  (Bondi  et  al.,  2008;  Fucich  et  al.,  2016;  Jett  et  al.,  2013; 
Liston et al., 2006; Morilak et al., 2005). Interestingly, CIC stress that 
impaired  reversal  learning  had  no  effect  on  set-shifting  (Lapiz-Bluhm 
et al., 2009). Chronic stress can lead to decreased activity in the mPFC in 
both  humans  and  animal  models  (Liston  et  al.,  2009),  and  reduces 
responsivity of the mPFC to afferent stimulation as measured by local 
field potentials (Jett et al., 2017). Reduced response to afferent input 
was unique to the MDT pathway to mPFC, as the response to stimulation 
from  the  ventral  hippocampus  remained  intact  after  CUS  (Jett  et  al., 
2017). Using optogenetics to induce long-term depression specifically 
within the MDT-mPFC pathway mimicked the effects of chronic stress on

set-shifting. By contrast, long-term potentiation induced optogenetically 
within  the  MDT-mPFC  pathway  of  stressed  rats  ameliorated  the 
stress-induced  deficits  in  set-shifting  (Bulin  et  al.,  2020).  Decreased 
mPFC  activity  and  responsiveness  also  correlate  with  stress-induced 
morphological  changes,  as  subjects  exposed  to  chronic  stress  exhibit 
reduced length of the apical dendrite and reduced dendritic branching in 
glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, and an overall loss of dendritic spines 
(Anderson et al., 2020; Cerqueira et al. 2005a, 2005b, 2007a, 2007b; 
Cook and Wellman 2004; Dias-Ferreira et al., 2009; Liston et al., 2006; 
Radley et al. 2004, 2006; Silva-Gomez et al., 2003).

3.2. Attention and behavioral inhibition

Broadly speaking, attention is the ability to actively process specific 
information in the environment while ignoring irrelevant information, 
whereas behavioral inhibition is characterized by the ability to restrain a 
response. Even within these general definitions, it is apparent that the 
two constructs are inter-related, in that a degree of inhibitory control is 
exerted during tasks of attention (when responses to extraneous stimuli 
need to be restrained) and vice versa, attention to environmental change 
is a prerequisite for inhibition of a response that has become ineffective 
(Bari  and  Robbins  2013). Indeed, as  we  will discuss  later,  behavioral 
tasks  measuring  deficits  in  attention  also  report  on  behavioral 
disinhibition.

Impulsivity is a component of normal behavior that manifests as loss 
of behavioral inhibition, including intolerance for delayed rewards, and 
actions performed hastily and without due consideration of the conse-
quences. High levels of impulsivity are associated with psychiatric dis-
orders such as attention-deficit disorder, bipolar disorder, substance use 
disorder,  and  other  addictive  disorders  (Winstanley  et  al.,  2006). 
Impulsivity manifests in both the innate tendency of the subject to ex-
press behavioral disinhibition (trait impulsivity) and in the response to 
environmental pressures that may produce disinhibited behavior (state 
impulsivity). Impulsivity can be conceptualized behaviorally and neu-
robiologically  under  two  broad  categories:  motor  impulsivity,  or  the 
inability to inhibit a prepotent motor response, and choice impulsivity, 
or  the  selection  of  a  small,  immediate  reward  in  favor  of  a  larger, 
delayed  reward  (Bari  and  Robbins  2013;  Dalley  and  Robbins  2017; 
Evenden 1999b; Winstanley et al., 2006).

3.2.1. Rodent models for attention and behavioral inhibition

3.2.1.1. Motor  impulsivity. The  5-choice  serial  reaction  time  test  (5- 
CSRTT)  is  used  to  measure  both  attention  and  response  inhibition  in 
rodents (Bari et al., 2008; Carli et al., 1983). Modified versions of this 
test,  e.g., the  4-choice serial  reaction  test  and  the  Sussex5CSRTT, are 
used in humans (Sanchez-Roige et al., 2016; Voon et al., 2014). In the 
rodent task, subjects are trained to detect brief flashes of light presented 
randomly in 1 of 5 holes and make a nose-poke response in the correct 
location to receive a food reward. Responses made before presentation 
of the stimulus (premature responses) are considered an index of motor 
impulsivity, whereas responses in one of the unlit holes (incorrect re-
sponses)  indicate  deficits  in  attention  (Eagle  and  Baunez  2010;  Sosa 
et al., 2021). The Go No-Go test is another motor inhibition test in which 
separate signals (different tones) are associated with “go” and “no-go” 
trials;  the  subject  must  respond  in  go  trials  but  inhibit  responding  in 
no-go  trials.  Motor  impulsivity  can  also  be  evaluated  by  considering 
“speed” 
the 
Stop-Signal-Reaction-Time Test (SSRTT). In this task, rats are presented 
with two levers. The animal is required to press in quick succession first 
the left then the right lever to receive a food pellet. On 20% of trials a 
stop  signal  (a  tone,  for  example)  is  played  after  the  left  lever  press 
signaling that the subject must withhold responding on the right lever to 
receive  the  reward  (Eagle  and  Baunez  2010;  Eagle  et  al.,  2008).  The 
critical measure in SSRTT is the time taken to stop the response. Thus, 

control,  measured 

inhibitory 

with 

of 

SSRTT specifically measures inhibition of actions that have been started 
and engage “stopping” processes, whereas Go No-Go and 5-CSRT tests 
measure the ability to inhibit the initiation of the response and engage 
“wait”  processes  during  inhibitory  responses.  Interestingly,  several 
studies have highlighted neuroanatomical and pharmacological differ-
ences between “waiting” and “stopping” impulsivity that provide useful 
frameworks  for  further  mechanistic  analysis  in  rodent  models  of 
impulsivity (Dalley et al., 2011; Dalley and Robbins 2017).

3.2.1.2. Choice  impulsivity. Impulsive  choice  is  exhibited  by  subjects 
who choose an immediately available small reward in preference to a 
larger but delayed reward. This type of decisional impulsivity is heavily 
shaped by reward valuation and the loss in perceived reward value when 
its delivery is delayed. In rodents, impulsive choice is often measured 
with delay-discounting tests (Evenden 1999a). Briefly, animals choose 
between two levers, one of which provides a reward of one pellet, the 
other a reward of 4 pellets. Over the period of the test the delay to the 
large reward increases from 0 s to 10, 20, 40,  and finally 60 s and a 
delay-discounting  curve  can  be  obtained.  Animals  typically  show  a 
strong preference for the larger reward early in the session when the 
delay is short or absent but shift their preference to the smaller reward as 
delay to the larger reward increases. Individuals who generate steeper 
discounting  curves,  such  that  each  unit  of  time-delay  has  a  greater 
negative effect on the valuation of the reward, are described as exhib-
iting more decisional impulsivity.

3.2.2. Brain regions and circuits involved in attention and behavioral 
inhibition

3.2.2.1. Motor  impulsivity. Many of the neuroanatomical substrates of 
behavioral  inhibition  have  been  identified  from  rodent  brain  lesion 
studies (for review see (Eagle and Baunez 2010)). To summarize, lesions 
in the OFC, dorsal medial striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN) affect 
stopping processes measured on SSRT as well as premature responding 
on  the  5-CSRTT.  Additionally,  lesions  in  the  infralimbic  cortex 
(Chudasama  et  al.,  2003b),  insular  cortex  (Dambacher  et  al.,  2015), 
ventral hippocampus (Abela et  al., 2013), and cingulate  cortex (Muir 
et al., 1996) all increase premature responding in the 5-CSRTT. The role 
of the nucleus accumbens may be more nuanced with differential effects 
mediated  by  the  shell  and  the  core  (Besson  et  al.,  2010;  Sesia  et  al., 
2008). Recently, using a cued sensory association task, the secondary 
motor cortex was implicated in coding and controlling premature motor 
output  (Guzulaitis et  al., 2022). In humans, motor impulsivity is  also 
associated  with  corticostriatal  and  corticosubthalamic  connectivity 
(Aron et al., 2003; Hannah and Aron 2021). Specifically, the STN is well 
recognized as an inhibitory modulator of cortico-striatal motor outputs 
(Morris et al., 2016a). Recent evidence from human studies of Parkinson 
disease (Mosley et al., 2020) confirms previous work that connectivity of 
premotor areas to the STN signal motor stopping (Aron et al., 2016) but 
also show a role of STN in facilitating disinhibitory control, possibly via 
connectivity of STN with prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (Dagher 
2020;  Mosley  et  al.,  2020).  In  rodents,  several  lines  of  evidence, 
including lesion studies (Baunez and Robbins 1997, Phillips and Brown 
2000) and disconnect studies (Chudasama et al., 2003a) have supported 
the notion of the STN as an “action stop” center. More recently, mapping 
of the underlying circuitry has confirmed the role of secondary motor 
cortex to STN connections (Adam et al., 2022) and mPFC to STN con-
nections (Li et al., 2020) in motor inhibition.

3.2.2.2. Choice  impulsivity. Lesion  studies  in  rodents  and  functional 
imaging studies in humans implicate the nucleus accumbens (NAC) core, 
basolateral  amygdala  (BLA),  hippocampus,  insula,  lateral  prefrontal 
cortex (PFC), posterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, and medial and 
lateral  orbitofrontal  OFC  in  delay  discounting  impulsivity  (Cardinal 
et al., 2001; Kable and Glimcher 2007; Tanaka et al., 2004; Winstanley

M. Girotti et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Neurobiology of Stress 33 (2024) 100670 

et al., 2004b). With respect to corticosubthalamic circuitry, lesions of 
the  STN  actually  reduce  impulsive  choice  (Winstanley  et  al.,  2005a). 
However, there is also evidence for a role of STN to mediate some as-
pects of cognitive or choice impulsivity, both in rodents and humans, 
with a putative regulation by associative and limbic cortices (mPFC and 
OFC) (Heston et al., 2020; Mosley et al., 2020). Indeed, a recent report 
showed that activity levels in the pre-supplementary motor area were 
shown to predict impulsive choice in a gambling test in humans (Lohse 
et al., 2023).

3.2.3. Neurochemical modulation of attention and behavioral inhibition

3.2.3.1. Motor  impulsivity. Glucocorticoids  and  CRH. Studies  that have 
investigated the role of stress hormones in impulsive responding did not 
report significant effects (Kentrop et al., 2016). Instead, stress hormones 
seem  to  affect attention.  In  particular, MR  blockade  impairs selective 
attention in healthy humans (Cornelisse et al., 2011a; Otte et al., 2007) 
and polymorphisms within the MR gene are associated with increased 
hyperactivity  and  decreased  attention  in  ADHD  cohorts  (Kortmann 
et al., 2013).

Serotonin.  Serotonin  neurotransmission  plays  an  important  role  in 
both  reward  evaluation  and  inhibitory  responses  (Desrochers  et  al., 
2022). Several lines of evidence, not all in concordance, have shown the 
importance  of  serotonin  in  motor  inhibition.  Thus,  in  some  studies, 
increased tonic extracellular serotonin levels in mPFC correlated with 
impulsive action in the 5-CSRTT (Dalley et al., 2002; Puumala and Sirvio 
1998). However, there is also evidence that depleting serotonin in the 
frontal  cortex increases  motor impulsivity  in  rodents (Harrison  et  al., 
1997; Winstanley et al., 2004a) and humans (Worbe et al., 2014) and 
that  increasing  serotonin  in  the  cortex  improves  wait  impulsivity. 
(Fonseca et al., 2015; Miyazaki et al. 2014, 2020). Thus, to fully char-
acterize  serotonergic  involvement  in  impulsivity  a  more  nuanced 
approach that considers receptor-, region- or circuit-specific effects may 
be necessary. With respect to receptor subtypes, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C 
receptors seem to have opposite effects on motor impulsivity; 5-HT2C 
receptor  antagonism  (in  prefrontal  cortex  and  accumbens)  is  associ-
ated  with  greater  premature  responding,  and  activation  of  these  re-
ceptors lowers premature responding in 5-CSRTT. Conversely, 5-HT2A 
receptor antagonism is associated with decreased premature responding 
and  activation  is  associated  with  increased  premature  responding  in 
5-CSRTT (Fletcher et al., 2007; Koskinen et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 
2008a; Silveira et al., 2020; Winstanley et al., 2004c).

Dopamine and norepinephrine. The dopaminergic and noradrenergic 
systems are also implicated in the modulation of impulsive responding 
in the 5-CSRTT, perhaps through cross-signaling. In particular, D2 re-
ceptor  availability  has  been  associated  with  high  trait  impulsivity  in 
humans (Volkow et al. 1993, 2001) and in rodents performing tests of 
motor impulsivity (Caprioli et al., 2013; Dalley et al., 2007; Pattij et al., 
2007).  Increasing  norepinephrine  (and  dopamine)  levels  with  NE  re-
uptake  inhibitors  such  as  atomoxetine  and  desipramine  decreases 
impulsive responding in the 5-CSRTT (Navarra et al., 2008; Paine et al., 
2007; Paterson et al., 2011; Robinson et al., 2008b). Finally, interactions 
between the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems were reported in 
a study where the beneficial effects of atomoxetine and duloxetine (a 
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) on decreasing motor 
impulsivity  were  blocked  by  a  D1-like  receptor  antagonist  (Sasamori 
et al., 2019).

Glutamate  and  GABA.  Other  neurotransmitter  systems  that  have  a 
role  in  impulsive  action  include  the  ionotropic  and  metabotropic 
glutamate  receptors (Higgins et  al., 2016; Isherwood et  al., 2017). In 
particular, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is differentially 
involved in impulsive action and impulsive choice, as positive allosteric 
modulation of this receptor reduces impulsive action but does not affect 
impulsive choice (Isherwood et al., 2015). GABAergic transmission also 
plays a role in motor impulsivity. Thus, high trait impulsivity in rats is 

associated  with  reduced  GABA  levels  in  the  ventral  striatum  and 
decreasing glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65/67) expression in the nu-
cleus accumbens increased impulsivity in low impulsivity rats (Caprioli 
et al., 2014; Sawiak et al., 2016).

3.2.3.2. Choice  impulsivity. Serotonin.  Serotonin’s  role  in  behavioral 
inhibition is not restricted to motor impulsivity but extends to choice 
impulsivity, although in this instance again, pharmacological effects are 
complex and outcomes have varied across studies. Some studies indi-
cated that depleting central serotonin in rodents does not produce ef-
fects  on  a  delay  discounting  task  (Winstanley  et  al.,  2004a),  in 
concordance with human studies. (Crean et al., 2002; Dougherty et al., 
2015;  Worbe  et  al.,  2014).  In  other  work,  however,  central  5-HT 
depletion  did  increase  impulsive  choice  in  rodents  (Mobini  et  al., 
2000) and serotonin efflux in the dorsal raphe nucleus is higher while 
waiting for delayed rewards (Miyazaki et al., 2011). Moreover, in ro-
dents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase selection 
of larger, delayed rewards (Bizot et al., 1999). Thus, serotonin effects 
appear to be complex and may depend on interplay with other neuro-
transmitter systems (Winstanley et al., 2005b).

Dopamine and norepinephrine. Depletion of dopamine in the striatum 
increases  discounting  rates  in  delay  discounting  tests  (Tedford  et  al., 
2015),  and  rats  with  higher  discounting  rates  have  a  blunted  cue 
dopamine  response  (Moschak  and  Carelli  2017).  Accordingly,  opto-
genetic stimulation that induces dopamine  release within the nucleus 
accumbens produces a shift toward waiting for delayed larger rewards in 
rats (Saddoris et al., 2015). Expression of D2 receptors is important for 
choice  impulsivity  as  knock-down  of  these  receptors  in  the  ventral 
tegmental area shifted preference for the smaller, immediate reward in 
rats  (Bernosky-Smith  et  al.,  2018).  As  with  other  neurotransmitters, 
however,  the  effects  of  dopamine  on  delay  discounting  seems  to  be 
region-dependent. Thus, discounting rates are increased by infusions of 
D2, but not D1, receptor antagonists in nucleus accumbens (Yates and 
Bardo 2017). Conversely, discounting rates are increased when D1, but 
not  D2,  antagonists  are  infused  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  (Loos  et  al., 
2010). These functional differences may be linked to the heterogeneity 
of  dopamine  receptor  expression  in  cortical  compared  to  subcortical 
regions.

A  large  volume  of  work  with  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors 
suggests  an  important  role  for  norepinephrine  not  only  in  impulsive 
action  but  also  in  impulsive  choice.  Pharmacological  increases  in 
extracellular  norepinephrine  levels  by  norepinephrine  transporter 
(NET) blockers, such as atomoxetine, consistently increase preference 
for larger delayed rewards in delay discounting tasks (Robinson et al., 
2008b; Sun et al., 2012). These effects appear to be mediated by the α2 
adrenergic receptor, as administration of α2 agonists decrease impulsive 
choice  (Nishitomi  et  al.,  2018)  and  α2  antagonists  increase  impulsive 
choice (Schippers et al., 2016). Despite the clear role of norepinephrine 
in  impulsivity  it  is  important  to  note  the  possibility  that  some  of  the 
behavioral  effects  described  above  may  be  in  part  due  to  changes  in 
dopaminergic  tone,  as  atomoxetine  also  increases  cortical  dopamine 
levels  (Bymaster  et  al.,  2002)  and  α2  agonists  have  been  found  to 
decrease dopamine release (Ihalainen and Tanila 2002).

Glutamate and GABA. Like motor impulsivity, choice impulsivity is 
also  regulated  by  excitatory  and  inhibitory  neurotransmitters.  Thus, 
levels of cortical glutamate-glutamine and GABA predict impulsive de-
cision  making  and  gambling  severity  in  humans  (Weidacker  et  al., 
2020). In rodents, ionotropic glutamate receptors have been shown to be 
implicated  in  delay  discounting  (Yates  and  Bardo  2017;  Yates  et  al., 
2015).

3.2.4. Stress effects on behavioral inhibition

Human  studies.  In  humans  there  is  evidence  that  both  acute  and 
chronic  stress  affect  behavioral  inhibition.  A  meta-analysis  of  in-
teractions of acute stress and risky behaviors revealed that overall, stress

Neurobiology of Stress 33 (2024) 100670 

exposure led to more disadvantageous and risky decisions than nonstress 
conditions  (Starcke  and  Brand  2016).  Interestingly,  stress  does  not 
uniformly increase impulsive responding, rather it interacts with trait 
impulsivity  as  a  factor  to  reveal  preexisting  biases  in  goal-directed 
behavior. Thus, in healthy adults acute stress impaired decision mak-
ing and speed of choice in both non-gambling and gambling settings, 
and  these  effects  were  more  pronounced  in  individuals  with  higher 
impulsivity (Canale et al., 2017; Raio et al., 2020). However, in humans 
other complicating factors, such as Individual perception of stress, may 
also affect choice behavior. In one study, researchers found that in the 
presence of an acute stressor individuals who are more likely to perceive 
stressful  situations  as  such  show  a  preference  for  larger,  delayed  re-
wards,  while  those  with  low  perceived  stress  prefer  short,  immediate 
rewards  (Lempert  et  al.,  2012).  The  authors  suggest  that  individuals 
with  high  perceived  stress  may  interpret  the  acute  stress  as  more 
threatening and this reduces their reward response in the short term. 
Indeed, a correlation between acute stress, decreased reward sensitivity 
and increased choice for later reward have been documented in previous 
work  (Bogdan  and  Pizzagalli  2006).  More  prolonged  stress  has  been 
linked to increased impulsivity and increased risk of developing specific 
addictive behaviors. In one study, greater lifetime stress exposure was 
significantly correlated with a greater tendency to make impulsive de-
cisions under negative emotionality and was predictive of developing 
food  addiction  but  not  alcohol  addiction  (McMullin  et  al.,  2021).  In 
another study, stress significantly correlated with higher impulsivity in 
methamphetamine users but not in cocaine users (Mahoney et al., 2015).
Rodent  studies.  Fewer  studies  have  addressed  the  role  of  stress  on 
impulsivity  in  rodents.  Perinatal  stress  has  been  shown  to  increase 
impulsive action but reduce impulsive choice in adulthood (reviewed in 
(Sanchez  and  Bangasser  2022)).  Moreover,  sex  difference  may  be  at 
play, as the type of perinatal stress applied elicits different effects on 
impulsivity (especially impulsive choice) in males versus females (Paine 
et al., 2021; Sanchez and Bangasser 2022). Conversely, administration 
of corticosterone to adolescent rats decreased premature responding at 
longer  intertrial  intervals  on  the  5-CSRTT  but  increased  delay  dis-
counting (Torregrossa et al., 2012). Thus, with the caveat that cortico-
sterone administration does not fully recapitulate the effects of natural 
stress,  it  appears  that  stress  experienced  before  adulthood  may  have 
differential  effects  on  impulsive  action  and  impulsive  choice.  Stress 
applied in adulthood is also capable of altering impulse control in ro-
dents.  Accordingly,  the  response  of  rats  in  a  motor  impulsivity  test 
analogous to the 5-CSRTT varies in a manner that is dependent on the 
type of stress used: while an acute stressor did not change performance, 
CIC stress lowered premature responses while CUS increased premature 
responses at longer intertrial interval times (Girotti et al., 2022). CUS 
also  increased  impulsive  choice  in  a  genetic  mouse  model  of  schizo-
phrenia (Buhusi et al., 2017). Taken together, a large body of evidence 
suggests that stress has a nuanced effect on impulsive responding that 
depends on individual baseline setpoints of goal-directed behavior.

3.3. Working memory

Working memory is defined as the temporary storage and manipu-
lation  of  content  used  to  perform  cognitive  tasks  such  as  language 
comprehension, learning, and reasoning (Baddeley 1992). This also re-
quires attentional processes, in particular focused or selective attention 
(Diamond 2013). In humans working memory can directly be assessed 
with simple ordering tasks (presenting subjects with random numbers 
and asking them to reorder them in ascending or descending order). The 
N-back task, in which the subject is presented with a series of stimuli and 
is asked to indicate when a current stimulus matches one from n steps 
earlier, is also a widely used task to assess working memory, although 
selective and sustained attention are also heavily employed in this task 
(Owen et al., 2005; Pelegrina et al., 2015).

3.3.1. Rodent models for working memory

In  rodents,  T-maze  alternation  tasks,  the  8-arm  radial  maze,  and 
object recognition tasks with variable lengths of delay are some of the 
most used tests of spatial and non-spatial working memory (Kinnavane 
et al., 2015; Lalonde 2002; Olton 1987; Warburton and Brown 2015). 
These  tasks  rely  on  the  intrinsic  propensity  of  the  animal  to  explore 
novel  locations  or  objects  when  given  a  choice  between  a  previously 
experienced situation and a novel one. Deficits in working memory will 
diminish preference for the novel location/object, as the animal does not 
retain information about previously encountered situations.

3.3.2. Brains areas and circuits of working memory

Human and non-human primate studies have revealed a central role 
of the frontal cortex in the regulation of working memory. Early studies 
in monkeys identified neurons in the PFC that maintain robust activity 
during cue presentation and during the delay period while the subjects 
keep stimulus information in working memory. This sustained activity is 
correlated with the ability to remember the information and is suscep-
tible  to  distractions  (Fuster  &  Alexander  1971,  1973).  Human  neuro-
imaging studies also found sustained activation in the lateral PFC while 
the subjects kept visual items in working memory (Courtney et al., 1998; 
Sakai et al., 2002). Moreover, specific involvement of parietal, sensory 
and  premotor  cortices  has  been  shown  in  both  human  and  primate 
studies  of  working  memory  (Khan  and  Muly  2011;  Klingberg  et  al., 
1997).

Rodent lesion studies have shown the importance of perirhinal, en-
torhinal cortex, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and insular cortex for 
recognition memory (Albasser et al., 2012; Barker and Warburton 2011; 
Bermudez-Rattoni 2014; Ennaceur and Aggleton 1997; Tuscher et al., 
2018;  Warburton  and  Brown  2015).  Subcortical  areas  involved  in 
recognition memory include thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum, septum, 
amygdala and cerebellum (for a comprehensive review see (Chao et al., 
2022)).  At the circuit level, electrophysiology  studies implicated con-
nectivity between PFC-thalamus (reuniens nucleus) and hippocampus as 
mediating  behavior  in  a  T-maze  test  (Hallock  et  al.,  2016;  Ito  et  al., 
2015).  Moreover,  chemogenic  inhibition  showed  that  reciprocal 
PFC-mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) projections mediate different phases 
of  working  memory  processing,  and  that  MDT  input  is  necessary  in 
sustaining  prefrontal  activity  during  working  memory  maintenance 
(Bolkan et al., 2017).

3.3.3. Neurochemical modulation of working memory

Glucocorticoids and CRH. Several reports indicate that alteration of 
stress  hormone  signaling  negatively  impacts  working  memory.  MR 
seems to be particularly important for working memory. For example, 
individuals with Addison’s disease performed better in working memory 
tasks when both receptors were activated compared to when only GRs 
were activated (Tytherleigh et al., 2004). In another study, mifepristone, 
a GR antagonist that shifts the MR/GR balance towards MR, improved 
spatial  working  memory  and  recognition  memory  in  individuals  with 
bipolar disorder (Young et al., 2004). CRHR1 signaling is also implicated 
in  working  memory.  In  humans  CRHR1  polymorphisms  interact  with 
early  life  stress  to  produce  deficits  in  working  memory  (Fuge  et  al., 
2014).  Administration  of  a  selective  CRFR1  antagonist  prevented 
cognitive impairments in recognition memory in stressed mice (Philbert 
et al., 2013).

Dopamine  and  Norepinephrine.  The  importance  of  dopamine  in 
working memory was established from observations that monkeys with 
dopamine  depletion  in  the  PFC  showed  profound  deficits  in  working 
memory (Brozoski et al., 1979). Early studies aimed at defining receptor 
subtypes unveiled a critical role for D1 receptors in the effect of dopa-
mine  on  working  memory.  Interestingly,  optimal  outcomes  follow  an 
inverted-U-shaped  dose-response  curve  where  both  insufficient  and 
excessive  D1  activation  result  in  impairments  (Williams  and  Castner 
2006; Williams and Goldman-Rakic 1995). Since D1 receptors are more 
abundant than D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex they have been the

Neurobiology of Stress 33 (2024) 100670 

focus of much early research; however, more recent studies have also 
highlighted a potential role for D2 receptor signaling in working mem-
ory.  For  example,  bromocriptine,  a  D2  receptor  agonist,  improved 
working  memory  in  a  variety  of  rodent  maze  tests  (Onaolapo  and 
Onaolapo 2013; Phelps et al., 2015; Tarantino et al., 2011), and treat-
ment with a D2 receptor antagonist (haloperidol) produced deficits in 
spatial  working  memory  and  object  recognition  (Terry  et  al.  2007a, 
2007b).

Noradrenergic  receptor  signaling  is  also  important  for  working 
memory, in particular α2 adrenoreceptors. Prefrontal cortex infusion of 
yohimbine,  a  noradrenergic  α2  receptor  antagonist,  impairs  perfor-
mance  on  working  memory tasks  (Li  et  al.,  1999),  whereas,  adminis-
tration  of  the  α2-adrenoceptors  agonist  guanfacine  improves  working 
memory functions in humans (Jakala et al., 1999; Swartz et al., 2008), 
monkeys (Arnsten et al., 1988) and rats (Hains et al., 2015).

Other neurotransmitter systems. In addition to catecholamines, there is 
evidence for an involvement of cholinergic receptors, with differential 
roles  of  nicotinic  and  muscarinic  receptors  in  different  aspects  of  the 
working memory processing (Granon et al., 1995). The glutamate sys-
tem  is  also  important  for  working  memory  function.  For  example,  in 
rodents, infusion of NMDA within the septum improves consolidation in 
a working memory task (Puma et al., 1998). Administration of NMDA 
receptor antagonists either systemically or locally within the dorsome-
dial PFC impairs spatial working memory in rats (Aura and Riekkinen 
1999; Gutnikov and Rawlins 1996). Interestingly, the NMDA antagonist 
AP5  infused  within  the  septum,  showed  dose-dependent  effects,  with 
improved  performance  in  a  recognition  task  at  low  doses  (Puma  and 
Bizot 1998) and impairment at high doses (Puma et al., 1998), under-
scoring the potential subtleties of pharmacological manipulation on this 
behavioral  measure.  Beside  excitatory  transmission,  evidence  shows 
that  inhibitory  transmission  also  modulates  working  memory.  For 
example, levels of GABA in the prefrontal cortex change during working 
memory tasks in humans (Michels et al., 2012; Yoon et al., 2016) and 
blockade of GABAA receptors in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys and 
rats reduces working memory capacity (Auger and Floresco 2014; Rao 
et al., 2000).

Finally, the role of serotonin in working memory is not well defined. 
Work in non-human primates suggests that 5-HT2A receptor stimulation 
facilitates spatial working memory (Williams et al., 2002), and studies in 
rodents indicate that prefrontal serotonin depletion may exert negative 
effects  on  select  aspects  of  working  memory  (Gonzalez-Burgos  et  al., 
2012). However, many outstanding questions remain, in part because 
serotonergic influence on working memory may, in fact, not be direct 
but derive from interplay with other neurotransmitter systems (such as 
the cholinergic system) (Ohno and Watanabe 1997).

3.3.4. Stress effects on working memory

Human  studies.  Stress  has  been  reported  to  have  mixed  effects  on 
working memory in healthy humans. Thus, some studies reported im-
pairments  in  working  memory  after  acute  stress  (Luethi  et  al.,  2008; 
Schoofs et al. 2008, 2009) or after acute administration of corticoste-
roids (Lupien et al., 1999). But other studies found no effect of stress 
(Porcelli  et  al.,  2008)  or  even  enhancement  of  working  memory 
(Cornelisse  et  al.,  2011b;  Weerda  et  al.,  2010).  Some  studies  showed 
enhancement of working memory in males but no effect or impairments 
in  females  (Cornelisse  et  al.,  2011b;  Qin  et  al.,  2009;  Schoofs  et  al., 
2013). One issue may be the use of widely different tasks to measure 
working  memory,  some  relying  on  visual  imagery,  others  on  letter 
recognition  or  digit-based n-back  tasks  that may  differentially  recruit 
other executive functions such as sustained attention.

Another  important  factor  influencing  stress  outcomes  on  working 
memory may be related to the timing of behavioral testing with respect 
to  stress  exposure.  In  a  recent  metanalysis  of  existing  literature  by 
(Geissler et al., 2023) the authors found that negative effects of stress on 
working memory are clustered within two timeframes of 0–9 min and 
25–50 min post-stressor. The authors suggest these timeframes represent 

effects mediated by sympathetic nervous system activation (early phase) 
and cortisol effects (late phase).

Rodent  studies.  In  rodents,  stress  has  also  been  shown  to  produce 
different  effects  depending  on  the  timing  and  stressor  type  (for  a 
metanalysis  see  (Moreira  et  al.,  2016)  Acute  stress  was  shown  to 
improve working memory with a mechanism attributed to glucocorti-
coid receptor-dependent regulation of glutamate receptors in the pre-
frontal  cortex  in  male  rats  (Yuen  et  al.  2009,  2011).  Another  group 
reported improved performance in male rats in the T-maze soon after 
application of acute footshock, but worse performance at later times of 
testing (Musazzi et al., 2019). In a study comparing male and female rats 
it was shown that 60 min restraint produced impairments in proestrus 
female rats but not male rats, whereas 2h restraint produced deficits in 
both sexes, leading the authors to conclude that high estrogen levels may 
render females more sensitive to the effects of stress on working memory 
(Shansky et al., 2006). With respect to chronic stress, some models have 
been shown to improve working memory, particularly in spatial working 
memory  tests  (see  (Conrad  2010).  However,  chronic  stress  is  also  re-
ported to impair working memory in male rats (Cerqueira et al., 2007a; 
Mika et al., 2012; Wright and Conrad 2008). In one study, one week of 
repeated restraint impaired working memory in male rats but not female 
rats (Wei et al., 2014). Early life stress has generally produced deficits in 
working memory in the male offspring (Banqueri et al., 2021; Brenhouse 
and Andersen 2011), and can exacerbate outcomes after additional in-
sults (Sanchez et al., 2021; Viola et al., 2019). Some studies, however, 
did not observe the negative impacts of early stress on working memory 
in males but did observe slight deficits in females, again highlighting 
that  stress  outcomes  are  greatly  nuanced  and  variable  depending  on 
protocols, sex, and age of testing (Sun et al., 2020).

4. Treatment strategies for cognitive impairment in stress- 
related psychiatric illness

This section will delve into current clinical interventions and novel 
therapeutic targets identified either preclinically or clinically for treat-
ment  to  mitigate  stress-induced  cognitive  dysfunctions.  When  appro-
priate, we discuss key preclinical mechanistic studies with translational 
potential. In other instances, such as the case concerning device-based 
neuromodulation approaches (section 4.2), we focus primarily on clin-
ical studies.

4.1. Pharmacological treatments

4.1.1. Monoamine neurotransmission targeting drugs

As  discussed  in  the  previous  sections,  monoaminergic  neurotrans-
mission  involving  serotonin,  norepinephrine  and  dopamine  exert  a 
critical role in brain circuits associated with cognitive functions.

in 

studies 

Pehrson and colleagues (Pehrson et al., 2015) conducted an in-depth 
review  of  preclinical 
rodents  on  monoamine 
neurotransmission-targeting  drugs  and  their  impact  on  cognition. 
Monoamine-targeting  drugs,  often  referred  to  as  conventional  antide-
pressants, are the leading prescribed  drugs to treat stress-related  psy-
chiatric  disorders.  While  conventional  antidepressants  have  shown 
varying degrees of clinical efficacy regarding mood improvement, their 
impact  on  cognitive  symptoms  remains  negligible  (Rosenblat  et  al., 
2015; Shilyansky et al., 2016), except for vortioxetine (Bennabi et al., 
2019), a multi-modal drug that is the only FDA-approved antidepressant 
for  which  the  prescribing  information  mentions  enhancements  in 
cognitive domains.

4.1.1.1. Serotonergic  system  targeting  drugs. As  previously  noted,  the 
serotonergic system has crucial regulatory effects on different domains 
of cognitive function. Not surprisingly then, several preclinical studies 
have supported the use of serotonergic modulators to improve cognitive 
deficits. For example, CIC-induced deficits in reversal learning in male 

11 

M. Girotti et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Neurobiology of Stress 33 (2024) 100670 

rats  were  rescued  by  acute  and  chronic  treatment  with  the  selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram (Danet et al., 2010). This 
effect was specific to the serotonin system because desipramine treat-
ment  (a  norepinephrine  reuptake  blocker)  did  not  rescue  the  CIC 
stress-induced reversal learning deficit (Danet et al., 2010). SSRIs such 
as  citalopram,  escitalopram  and  fluoxetine  have  also  shown  to  be 
effective in ameliorating CUS-induced set-shifting deficits in male rats 
(Bondi et al., 2008; Minchew et al., 2021; Nikiforuk and Popik 2011).

Vortioxetine,  an  N-arylpiperazine  derivative,  is  a  potent  selective 
inhibitor of the SERT, similar in this respect to other SSRIs. However, it 
also has potent actions at multiple 5-HT receptors (partial 5-HT1B ago-
nism,  5-HT1A  agonism,  and  5-HT1D,  5-HT3,  5-HT7  antagonism),  a 
property  not  shared  by  other  SSRIs.  In  addition,  vortioxetine  can 
modulate the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, 
GABAergic,  and  glutamatergic  systems  (Pehrson  et  al.,  2016).  An 
in-depth review of preclinical and clinical findings implicating the an-
tidepressant effects of vortioxetine was published by Sanchez and col-
leagues (Sanchez et al., 2015). Preclinical studies carried out in male rats 
have  also  shown  that  vortioxetine  efficacy 
in  rescuing  5-HT 
depletion-induced  deficits  in  reversal  learning  is  likely  due  to  its  ac-
tion  at  postsynaptic 5-HT  receptors,  as  PCPA-induced  blockade  of  se-
rotonin reuptake did not prevent the beneficial effects of vortioxetine 
(Wallace et al., 2014). In the same study, the authors also showed that 
chronic vortioxetine treatment rescued CIC-induced deficits in reversal 
learning. Vortioxetine has recently been shown to recover set-shifting 
deficits in male rats. (Vaiana et al., 2023). In a preclinical study rele-
vant to the study of depression and anxiety-related disorders, vortiox-
etine  mitigated  the  excessive  display  of  conditioned  fear  and  rescued 
adaptive coping behaviors compromised by chronic stress in male rats 
(Hatherall et al., 2017).

It is worth noting that, more recently, a promising target that has 
garnered  attention  in  the  realm  of  therapeutics  for  stress-related  psy-
chiatric disorders is the 5-HT4 receptors. As such, an extensive review of 
the role of 5-HT4 receptor pharmacology, its role in cognition, and its 
potential as therapeutics for stress-related psychiatric disorders has been 
published (Murphy et al., 2021).

4.1.1.2. Noradrenergic  system  targeting  drugs. Lapiz  and  colleagues 
demonstrated that naïve male rats treated subchronically with the NE- 
reuptake  blocker  desipramine  showed  improvement  in  set-shifting 
correlated with upregulation of mPFC NE (Lapiz et al., 2007). Chronic 
treatment with milnacipran, a serotonin-norepinephrine uptake inhibi-
tor, can also restore set-shifting compromised by stress (Craine et al., 
2023; Naegeli et al., 2013). In male rats subject to CUS, chronic treat-
ments with either the norepinephrine reuptake blocker desipramine or 
the SSRI escitalopram prevented the deficit in set-shifting induced by 
stress  (Bondi  et  al.  2008,  2010).  In  male  rats.  acute  postsynaptic  α1 
adrenergic receptor antagonism with benoxathian administration into 
the mPFC before testing prevented the beneficial effects of desipramine 
(Bondi et al., 2010), whereas infusions of β1  or β2  adrenergic receptor 
antagonists into the mPFC do not have a similar blocking effect (Lapiz 
and Morilak 2006). Furthermore, the same authors demonstrated that 
the systemic administration of atipamezole, an α2A-adrenergic receptor 
antagonist,  enhances  set-shifting  in  male  rats.  However,  while  the 
faciliatory effects of norepinephrine persisted during chronic stress, they 
became detrimental to reversal learning in male rats (Jett et al., 2013).
These data show that while antagonism of α2A-adrenergic receptor is 
associated  with  cognitive  improvement  (Bondi  et  al.,  2007),  it  is 
essential to recognize that treatments targeting the modulatory role of 
α2A-adrenergic  receptors  in  rescuing  stress-induced  cognitive  deficits 
will vary as a function of the inverted-U shaped noradrenergic-mediated 
response to stress (Arnsten 2011, 2015; Berridge and Arnsten 2013).

4.1.1.2.1. The α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist guanfacine. Guanfacine 
is  a  selective  and  potent  agonist  of  postsynaptic  α2A-adrenergic  re-
ceptors, capable of strengthening PFC network connections (Arnsten and 

Jin  2012;  Arnsten  2020).  Moreover,  guanfacine  treatment  exhibits 
pro-cognitive effects  across species (Arnsten  2020). In 2009, the FDA 
approved  a  long-acting  formulation  of  the  drug  (Intuniv™)  for  the 
treatment of ADHD in children.

Mice with a single copy deletion of the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) 
gene,  namely,  NF1  (±)  mice,  are  useful  for  the  study  of  ADHD  and 
associated deficits in inhibitory control, as NF1 mutations in humans are 
associated  with  ADHD  in  clinical  populations  (Hyman  et  al.,  2005; 
Hyman  et  al.,  2005)  Using  the  delay  discounting  test  as  a  proxy  for 
choice  impulsivity,  NF1  (±)  male  mice  displayed  greater  impulsivity 
when compared to the wild-type male mice. Treatment with guanfacine 
(0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) was effective in rescuing NF1 (±) mice deficits in choice 
impulsivity (Lukkes et al., 2020).

The  repurposing  of  guanfacine  for  various  indications  linked  to 
neurological  and  psychiatric  disorders  has  increased  significantly 
(Woolley 2023), bearing profound implications for the amelioration of 
cognitive  deficits  associated  with  cognitive  dysfunction  in  a  clinical 
population characterized as biotype 6 described in section 4.4.

4.1.2. Multiple neurotransmitter system targeting drug: modafinil success in 
the clinic

Modafinil is a prescription medication used to promote wakefulness 
and enhance cognitive function with a complex pharmacological profile, 
including the blockade of monoamines (noradrenaline, dopamine, and 
serotonin) as well as modulation of the glutamatergic and GABAergic 
system (Mereu et al., 2013). Modafinil is FDA-approved for use in in-
dividuals  with  multiple  sleep-associated  disorders,  effectively  aiding 
them  in  maintaining  alertness  during  waking  hours.  In  preclinical 
studies,  acute  but  not  chronic  modafinil  treatment  promotes  neuro-
genesis by increasing precursor cell proliferation and survival (Brandt 
et  al.,  2014).  Modafinil  treatment  reversed  stress-induced  spatial 
memory  deficits  in  rats  (Alam  and  Choudhary  2023).In  healthy  in-
dividuals,  short-term  modafinil  treatment  improves  cognition  and 
attentional  set-shifting  (Turner  et  al.,  2004).  Schizophrenia-related 
cognitive impairments were also improved with acute modafinil treat-
ment (Scoriels et  al., 2013; Turner  et al., 2004) but not with chronic 
administration (Sinkeviciute et al., 2018).

In remitted depressed patients with persistent cognitive symptoms, 
modafinil  treatment  significantly  improved  episodic  and  working 
memory,  but  no  beneficial  effects  were  detected  on  attention  and 
planning strategies (Kaser et al., 2017). Furthermore, although system-
atic reviews and meta-analyses of the clinical use of augmentation drugs 
for depression show favorable results for modafinil (Goss et al., 2013; 
Nunez  et  al.,  2022),  clinical  trials  evaluating  its  effects  on  various 
cognitive domains are lacking.

4.1.3. Ketamine as a breakthrough leading to novel therapeutic modalities: 
glutamatergic and GABAergic system-targeting drugs

Ketamine,  an  NMDA  receptor  channel  blocker,  is  a  rapidly  acting 
antidepressant with its (S)-isomer, (S)-ketamine (intranasal Spravato), 
approved by the FDA in 2019 for Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). 
The  fact  that  ketamine  is  mechanistically  distinct  from  conventional 
monoamine-based  antidepressants  has  stimulated  research  for  drugs 
that would reproduce its rapid therapeutic effects associated with the 
improvement of depressive symptomatology without the confounds of 
its psychotomimetic and abuse-related properties.

The  disinhibition  hypothesis  posits  that  ketamine  initially  blocks 
NMDA  receptors  on  fast-spiking  GABAergic  neurons,  thus  promoting 
local inhibition of interneuron (Zanos and Gould 2018). Consequently, 
transient  disinhibition  of  glutamatergic  pyramidal  cells  occurs  and 
rapidly induces AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in relevant 
corticolimbic circuits. Furthermore, the disinhibition-induced plasticity 
of excitatory synapses weakened by chronic stress has become a thera-
peutic principle for achieving rapid (24 h after treatment) restoration of 
stress-induced deficits in reward sensitivity related to mood disorders 
(Thompson et al., 2015b).

Neurobiology of Stress 33 (2024) 100670 

In preclinical studies, ketamine has shown promising effects in cor-
recting the effects of stress on executive functions. Ketamine adminis-
tered  24  h  before  testing  rescued  deficits  in  set-shifting  and  reversal 
learning in stressed male rats (Jett et  al., 2015). When ketamine was 
administered daily before stress, it prevented stress-induced deficits in 
set-shifting  (Nikiforuk  and  Popik  2014).  The  prophylactic  effects  of 
ketamine have been reviewed recently (Evers et al., 2022). Moreover, a 
subanesthetic dose of ketamine in combination with an AMPAkine re-
duces premature responses in a motor impulsivity test in non-stressed 
rats  (Davis-Reyes  et  al.,  2021).  Ketamine  administration  to  TRD  pa-
tients  has  been  linked  to  improvements  in  executive  function,  visual 
memory, and working memory (Gill et al., 2021; Shiroma et al. 2014, 
2022;  Stippl  et  al.,  2021).  In  addition,  ketamine  is  associated  with  a 
reduction in suicidal ideation, with indications associating this effect to 
enhanced inhibitory control (Lee et al., 2016; Zhang and Ho 2016). It is 
worth  noting  that  acute  ketamine  has  been  reported  to  also  induce 
cognitive  impairments  (likely  due  to  its  psychotomimetic-inducing 
properties) in healthy but not in TRD patients. Specifically, in healthy 
volunteers,  but  not  in  TRD  patients,  ketamine  administration  was 
correlated with transient decreases in working memory, attention, and 
long-term memory measured up to 1 h post treatment (Harborne et al., 
1996; Hetem et al., 2000; Morgan et al., 2004). Measures of functional 
connectivity in these cohorts revealed increases and decreases in fron-
tostriatal  functional  connectivity  in  TRD  and  healthy  individuals, 
respectively (Mkrtchian et al., 2021), reflecting the contrasting impacts 
of ketamine on executive function.

Given  the  side  effects  associated  with  the  use  of  ketamine  (Short 
et al., 2018), an alternative approach to promoting disinhibition of py-
ramidal neurons is to use subtype-selective modulation of benzodiaze-
pine  (BZ)  site–containing  GABAA  receptors  (GABAARs).  Although 
α5-containing  GABAARs  (α5-GABAARs)  comprise  only  10%  of  total 
brain GABAARs, the expression of α5-GABAARs is enriched in the hip-
pocampus  and  the  prefrontal  cortex.  Selective  a5-GABAAR  negative 
allosteric modulators (a5-GABAAR-NAMs) such as L-655,708, aIA, and 
MRK-016 are being developed as potential cognitive enhancers with the 
idea  of  selectively  targeting  hippocampus  and  cortex  (Atack  2011). 
Although selective a5-GABAAR-NAMs have been shown preclinically to 
improve memory in naïve rodents (Chambers et al., 2002; Street et al., 
2004),  they  have  not  been  extensively  tested  preclinically  in 
stress-induced  cognitive  dysfunctions.  Moreover,  poor  pharmacoki-
netics,  toxicity  issues,  and  low  tolerance  in  older  adults  prevented 
further testing in humans (Atack 2010, 2011; Atack et al., 2009).

A  more  recently  screened  selective  α5-GABAAR-NAM,  Basmisanil, 
mitigated  diazepam-induced  hippocampal-dependent  spatial  learning 
impairment  in male  rats (assessed using the Morris water maze), and 
improved  prefrontal  cortex-mediated  executive  function  in  male  non- 
human  primates  (evaluated  using  the  object  retrieval  task  in  cyn-
omolgus macaques) (Hipp et al., 2021). In addition, Basmisanil did not 
demonstrate anxiogenic or proconvulsant effects in male rats and Phase I 
clinical  studies  (Hipp  et  al.,  2021).  Therefore,  Basmisanil  possesses  a 
favorable profile for exploring the potential therapeutic advantages of 
α5-GABAAR modulation.

In  contrast  to  selective  NAMs  acting  through  the  a5-GABAAR 
benzodiazepine  binding  site,  S44819  is  a  recently  identified  GABA 
competitive  antagonist  at  a5-GABAAR.  It  shares  pro-cognitive  effects 
with NAMs in preclinical studies, including inhibiting a5-GABAAR tonic 
current, enhancing LTP, reversing scopolamine-induced spatial working 
memory  impairment,  and  improving  object  recognition  memory 
(Etherington  et  al.,  2017;  Ling  et  al.,  2015).  Additional  research  is 
needed  to  explore  its  potential  impact  on  stress-induced  executive 
function deficits.

In addition to the beneficial effects of a5-GABAAR-NAMs discussed 
thus far, there is a body of work showing that selective positive allosteric 
modulators of the a5-GABAAR (a5-GABAAR-PAMs) have potential for 
the  treatment  of  mood  disorders  as  well  as  cognitive  dysfunctions 
(Luscher et al., 2023; Prevot et al., 2019). Chronic treatment with the 

selective  a5-GABAAR-PAM  GL-II-73  rescued  stress-induced  and 
age-related  working  memory  deficits  in  mice  (Prevot  et  al.,  2019).  A 
putative  reconciliation  and  working  hypothesis  explaining  how 
a5-GABAAR-NAMs and a5-GABAAR-PAMs might exert similar outcomes 
has been proposed by Prevot and Sibille (Prevot and Sibille 2021) and is 
that both treatments increase signal-to-noise ratio of hippocampal and 
cortical transmission, although via distinct mechanism.

Many other compounds targeting the GABAergic system, collectively 
known  as  GABAkines,  are  currently  being  tested  for  the  treatment  of 
neurological  and  stress-induced  psychiatric  disorders  (Cerne  et  al., 
2022; Witkin et al., 2022; Zou et al., 2023).

4.2. Non-pharmacological treatments

4.2.1. Device-based neuromodulation

In contrast to pharmacological interventions, which predominantly 
target neurochemical communication between cells, device-based neu-
romodulation offers a distinct approach by selectively targeting specific 
components of neural cell activity, namely the membrane potentials in 
axons and dendrites. Device-based neuromodulation holds the potential 
to serve a dual role: first, as a valuable research tool, enabling the se-
lective and non-invasive alteration of neural excitability to explore its 
effects  on  brain  circuits  and  behavior;  second,  as  an  effective  non- 
invasive  therapeutic  approach  for  stress-induced  cognitive  dysfunc-
tions  (Begemann  et  al.,  2020).  In  this  section,  we  describe  clinical 
studies.

4.2.1.1. Transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (TMS). During  TMS,  an 
alternating  magnetic  field  produces  weak  electrical  currents  in  the 
brain. The precise control of the magnetic field allows for non-invasive 
targeted stimulation, making it a valuable tool in neuroscience research 
and clinical practice. In 2008, TMS became FDA-approved for TRD. In 
2017, deep TMS was approved as an adjunct treatment for OCD, and in 
2020, for smoking cessation. The disadvantage of TMS is that it must be 
applied in a specialized clinical facility, as the equipment is large and 
expensive.

To test the hypothesis that impulsivity could be associated with poor 
weight  management  in  obese  patients,  one  group  received  deep  TMS 
with  active  stimulation  in  the  PFC  and  insula  for  5  weeks,  while  the 
other  received  sham  stimulation.  The  results  showed  a  reduction  of 
impulsivity in patients receiving deep TMS accompanied by significant 
improvement in body mass index, illustrating the effectiveness of deep 
TMS  therapy  in  restoring  the  top-down  inhibitory  control  of  the  PFC 
(Luzi et al., 2021).

A  recent  review  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  repetitive  TMS 
(rTMS)  to  the  PFC  for  TRD  concludes  that  rTMS  is  reliable,  well- 
tolerated,  and  efficacious  (Adu  et  al.,  2022).  Nonetheless,  although 
emerging  evidence  substantiates 
in 
improving depressive symptomatology, there is a scarcity of literature 
supporting its long-term effects in cognitive symptom domains in TRD 
patients.  Furthermore,  to  establish  a  standardized  approach  to  rTMS 
implementation, further research is essential to explore variables such as 
frequency, intensity, pulse quantities, site of application, and inclusion 
of cognitive tests.

its  short-term  effectiveness 

Regarding  treatment  for  trauma-related  disorders,  a  meta-analysis 
performed  by  Cirillo  and  colleagues  (Cirillo  et  al.,  2019)  evaluating 
the  effects  of  rTMS  (ranging  from  1  to  20  Hz)  with  traditional 
figure-of-eight coils to DLPFC indicates that rTMS is effective for PTSD 
and generalized anxiety disorders.

4.2.1.2. Transcranial  direct  current  stimulation  (tDCS). tDCS  is  a  safe 
way to non-invasively manipulate brain activity using weak electrical 
currents between two electrodes, one acting as a positive pole (anode) 
and  the  other  as  a  negative  pole  (cathode)  over  the  targeted  cortical 
regions.  The  effects  of  tDCS  will  vary  based  on  the  polarity

configuration,  such  that  anodal  stimulation  promotes  cell  membrane 
depolarization,  consequently  increasing  brain  excitability.  Cathodal 
stimulation has the opposite effect. The advantages of tDCS are porta-
bility and relatively low cost.

Evidence-based  reviews  of  tDCS  effectiveness  in  neurological  and 
psychiatric disorders have been published (Fregni et al., 2021). Addi-
tionally,  although  the  tDCS-induced  current  density  is  restricted  pri-
marily to the brain region surrounding the electrodes, the effects can be 
extended 
to  distant  neural  networks,  promoting  broader 
connectivity-related  effects  (Ardolino  et  al.,  2005;  Cambiaghi  et  al., 
2020).  Researchers  have  increasingly  used  tDCS  to  investigate  how 
cognitive and behavioral functions are linked to specific brain circuits. 
For example, applying anodal tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC)  in  healthy  individuals  has  been  shown  to  improve  planning 
(Dockery et al., 2009), working memory (Zaehle et al., 2011), attention 
(Stone  and  Tesche  2009),  and  reduced  risk-taking  behavior  (Fecteau 
et al., 2007; Pripfl et al., 2013). Moreover, in patients with gambling 
disorder, anodal tDCS over the DLPFC improved decision-making and 
impulse control (Salatino et al., 2022). Another critical brain region with 
an established role in decision-making and impulse control is the OFC, 
and a small study in healthy individuals whereby anodal tDCS targeted 
the OFC showed improvement in decision-making and impulse control 
(Ouellet et al., 2015). A recent pilot study has established the feasibility 
of  the  use  of  tDCS  over  the  OFC  as  a  neuromodulatory  non-invasive 
treatment of OCD (Fineberg et al., 2023).

In  summary,  non-invasive  brain  neuromodulation  holds  great 
promise regarding treatment options for cognitive dysfunctions. Recent 
research,  with  its  emphasis  on  customizing  brain  stimulation  to  indi-
vidual requirements, is pivotal in enhancing the effectiveness and safety 
of these techniques for all individuals. This personalized approach seeks 
to extend the advantages of brain stimulation to a broader spectrum of 
patients. A limited preliminary study suggested that anodal tDCS may 
improve  extinction  consolidation  in  patients  with  PTSD  (Van’t  Wout 
et al., 2017).

4.2.2. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)

CBT encompasses a variety of techniques and strategies, including 
exposure therapy, aimed at identifying and modifying negative thought 
patterns and behaviors. Negatively biased cognitive inflexibility is pre-
sent  in  both  PTSD  and  depression,  and  it  manifests  as  the  automatic 
generation  of  thoughts,  reactions,  and  interpretations  consistently 
reinforced by avoidance behaviors.

Evidence-based  exposure  therapy  treatments  for  PTSD  revolve 
around reducing avoidance behaviors and actively engaging with trau-
matic memories. The cognitive element in the case of exposure therapy, 
where extinction plays a crucial role, is new learning-induced circuit- 
level plasticity, enabling cognitive flexibility and transitioning towards 
more adaptive and suitable behavioral responses. In a preclinical model 
of  prolonged  exposure  therapy,  one  session  of  cue-conditioned  fear 
extinction learning 24 h before testing rescued CUS-induced set-shifting 
impairments. Inhibition of protein synthesis within the IL mPFC during 
extinction  prevented  these  behavioral  effects,  and  the  activity  of  IL 
mPFC glutamatergic neurons was necessary and sufficient for the ther-
apeutic  effects  of  extinction  (Fucich  et  al.  2016,  2018;  Paredes  and 
Morilak 2019). At the circuit level, extinction reversed the CUS-induced 
attenuation  of  medial  dorsal  thalamus  glutamatergic  afferent-evoked 
electrical responses in IL mPFC (Fucich et al., 2018). While the ventral 
hippocampal afferent-evoked electrical responses in the IL mPFC were 
not affected by CUS, BDNF signaling within this pathway was necessary 
for the therapeutic effects of extinction (Paredes and Morilak 2023).

Although  exposure  therapy  successfully  improves  PTSD-related 
cognitive  dysfunctions  (Nijdam  and  Vermetten  2018),  a  significant 
shortcoming  is  the  high  drop-out  rate.  Therefore,  novel  therapeutic 
approaches to enhance the effectiveness of exposure therapy are needed, 
as discussed in 4.2.3.

4.2.3. Therapy enhancement by adjunct treatment

Research evaluating novel therapeutic agents given in combination 
with  well-established  standard  treatments,  especially  when  patients 
have  only  partially  responded,  has  gained  attention  in  clinical  and 
preclinical settings. The goal is to identify synergistic pairings that can 
enhance treatment effectiveness while minimizing the time it takes to 
achieve a response, and to minimize potential adverse effects or issues 
related to tolerability, to improve treatment results.

Krystal and Neumeister (Krystal and Neumeister 2009) proposed that 
combined  exposure  therapy  and  pharmacotherapy  for  PTSD  act  to 
enhance  neuroplasticity,  likely  by  activating  neurotrophic  factor 
signaling. In preclinical studies carried out in both male and female rats, 
combining  a  sub-therapeutic  dose  of  ketamine  with  an  abbreviated, 
sub-threshold  extinction 
learning  protocol  completely  reversed 
CUS-induced set-shifting deficits (Paredes et al., 2022). These outcomes 
may arise from molecular mechanisms shared by extinction and keta-
mine, such as enhanced neuronal plasticity in relevant circuitry (e.g., 
hippocampus-mPFC) or increased BDNF signaling (Paredes and Morilak 
2023). Other recent research combining the entactogen phenethylamine 
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA)  with  psychotherapy 
has shown improvement in PTSD symptoms Such studies suggest novel 
drugs that may be useful in combination with behavioral interventions 
to shorten treatment duration and potentially enhance efficacy (Bahji 
et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2023; Sessa et al., 2019).

4.3. Future directions and conclusions

One  promising  approach  to  achieve  better  treatment  outcomes  is 
associated  with  the  characterization  of  biotypes  of  stress-related  psy-
chiatric disorders, made possible by recent advances in brain imaging 
and computation. Six biotypes of depression have been characterized, 
and  each  one  of  those  biotypes  are  clustered  based  on  distinct  dys-
functions in large-scale brain connectivity amongst patients with vary-
ing degrees of symptomatology (Drysdale et al., 2017; Williams 2016). 
These  clusters  can  provide  valuable  insights  into  clinical  outcomes 
following treatment interventions. Of relevance to this review, biotype 6 
of  depression,  also  known  as  the  cognitive  dysfunction  biotype,  is 
characterized by disruption of cognitive control circuitry connectivity 
(heavily  linked  to  the  DLPFC/ACC/Precentral  Gyrus/Dorsal  Parietal 
Cortex) (Hack et al., 2023; Williams 2016), and no response to SSRIs 
(Tozzi et al., 2020). A clinical trial-guided study is currently in Phase 4, 
testing the drug guanfacine, which mechanism of action was discussed 
in 4.1.1.2, as a novel therapy for cognitive impairment in biotype 6 of 
depression, targeting the DLPFC (NCT04181736).

Therefore,  assessment  of  individual  brain  connectivity  maps  may 
inform predictions regarding treatment response, facilitating selection 
of more tailored and effective treatments for patients with varying de-
grees of executive function impairment.

In summary, the field is confronted with several crucial challenges.

1.  Mechanistic  Insights  into  Subtypes:  There  is  a  need  to  develop  a 
deeper  mechanistic  understanding  of  various  subtypes  of  stress- 
related  psychiatric  disorders  to  pave  the  way  to  develop  precise 
individualized therapeutic strategies. Preclinically, such insights will 
serve as a testing ground for tailored interventions.

2.  Emphasis on  Prediction  and  Prevention: Shifting  the  focus toward 
then predicting and preventing stress-related cognitive dysfunction 
is  a  crucial  challenge.  Identifying  subtypes  and  risk  factors,  and 
strategies to mitigate them, the field can lead to significant strides in 
reducing the overall burden of these conditions.

These challenges underscore the need for multidisciplinary comple-
mentary  research  combining  reductionist  science,  personalized  medi-
cine,  and  validated  animal  models  to  address  stress-related  cognitive 
dysfunctions and develop strategies to manage them before they prog-
ress to clinical disorder.
