Given the limitations associated with existing treatments for Attention Deficit/Hyperactive
disorder (ADHD), Physical Activity (PA) has been considered as an adjunct therapeutic
option. Previous research has generally found that PA reduces ADHD symptoms in children.
However, much less research has explored the same effects in adults, and especially
females, with ADHD. This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between PA
and ADHD in adults, and whether any relationship was moderated by proxy diagnostic
ADHD group, as well as exploring the roles of motivation and forms of exercise. 268 partici-
pants completed an online survey measuring proxy ADHD diagnosis; ADHD symptomatol-
ogy; PA level; forms of exercise performed, and motivation for exercise. In contrast to
previous research performed with child participants (which frequently found significant neg-
ative correlations), there was no significant relationship between PA level and total ADHD
symptomatology in adults, but there was a significant negative correlation between PA level
and inattentive ADHD symptomatology. The strength of relationship between PA level and
ADHD symptomatology did not differ based on ADHD proxy diagnostic grouping; PA level
based on motivation type; or PA level based on total forms of exercise performed. However,
it may be that clear relationships between PA and ADHD symptomatology are not easily
identifiable in adult populations when only broad, nonspecific variables/measures are used
(e.g., only measuring ADHD symptoms as a continuous total score, rather than considering
inattentive/hyperactive symptoms separately). Therefore, greater differentiation between
ADHD symptoms and subject characteristics (such as gender) might be required to better
establish potential relationships and effects in this area, and better inform any potential PA
based treatments.

1. Introduction

Attention Deficit/Hyperactive disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder character-
ised by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity, along with poor attention and

memory, to the point that it interferes with development or functioning [1]. For example, vari-
ous aspects of memory (e.g., working memory; verbal long-term memory) may be compro-
mised to varying degrees [2, 3], and executive functions (e.g., cognitive flexibility, inhibition,
and planning) can also be affected [2, 4], contributing to difficulties in organisation, decision-
making, and goal-directed behaviour. Moreover, deficits in social cognition can also lead to
challenges in forming and maintaining relationships [5], interpreting social cues [6], and
adapting behaviour across social contexts [7].

Prevalence rates vary widely, with reported estimates of between 2.2% [8] and 6–7% for
children and adolescents [9], and 2.8% [8] to 6.76% [10] for adults. The aforementioned symp-
toms of ADHD (e.g., inattention, impulsivity, poor decision making, working memory prob-
lems) can lead to lifelong challenges, including education and occupational difficulties and
instability [11, 12]; social and interpersonal problems [5, 11]; and difficulty managing finances
[11]. ADHD has also been associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour [13], as well as an
increased risk of both psychiatric (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance misuse [14] and other
comorbidities (e.g., sleep disturbance, obesity) [15]. There are also significant economic and
societal costs associated with ADHD [16–18]. In the UK for example, the mean annual cost of
social care, National Health Service and educational resources per adolescent with ADHD has
been estimated at £5,493, with an estimated annual total UK cost in the region of £670 million
in 2010 [16].

Current treatments for ADHD include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological
approaches, with most guidelines recommending a mixture of both [19]. However, benefits of
pharmacological interventions have been reported to diminish after 14–24 months [20, 21],
and many individuals with ADHD may be unresponsive to stimulants or unable to tolerate
side effects [22]. Similarly, whilst non-pharmacological interventions may be suitable for a
wider population, they have been reported to have both reduced efficacy [23, 24] and cost
effectiveness, relative to pharmacological approaches [25, 26].

With the need for alternative treatments (that are applicable to a wider population, with
fewer side effects, reduced costs, and greater longevity of effect), Physical Activity (PA) and/or
exercise (a subset of PA) have been considered as potential approaches [27–31]. PA has dem-
onstrated positive effects in the general population, such as: improving cognitive functions
(e.g., planning, scheduling, working memory, task coordination) [32]; reducing depression
and anxiety [33] and improving life expectancy [34, 35]. PA has also been shown to be effective
when incorporated into treatment interventions for conditions such as depression, anxiety,
stress and neurodegenerative diseases, leading to improved mood, quality of life, and executive
function [32, 36–39].

Recent evidence also suggests that PA and exercise may have beneficial effects for ADHD
symptomatology, by reducing cognitive deficits (e.g., improved attention, inhibition and speed
of information processing), negative physical/motor development, and socio-emotional diffi-
culties [27–31]. In male adults with ADHD (or expressing elevated ADHD symptoms), a
20-minute bout of exercise was found to enhance motivation for cognitive tasks and increase
feelings of energy [40], and whole-body vibration has been reported to improve attention [41]
and neuropsychological test performance [42]. Similarly, a positive association between PA
and reduced ADHD symptoms has been found in male adults with ADHD [43]. It may be that
PA has similar modes of action as pharmacological treatments, such as increased production
of catecholamines linked with ADHD symptoms [44]. Likewise, it is possible that longer-term
effects may, at least in part, be due to long-term neurostructural changes in the brain linked
with PA [45–47].

However, despite accumulating evidence that exercise and PA may have beneficial impacts

on ADHD, there are several shortcomings attached to existing studies—such as a lack of

PLOS ONEAssociation of exercise and ADHD symptoms

research exploring certain demographic groups. One such underrepresented group is adults
with ADHD, as highlighted by multiple review papers focusing purely on studies with children
[28, 29, 48–51], few containing coverage of both children and adults [30, 31, 44], and none
dedicated solely to adult-based samples. Additionally, among the reviews that include both
children and adults, the majority focus on children. For example, Den Heijer er al. [30]
reviewed 25 studies, but only four [40–43] focused on adult participants. As such, the relation-
ship between PA and ADHD remains relatively unexplored in adults compared to children,
indicating a significant gap in understanding.

Another major gap in our understanding, is the lack of research into ADHD in females,
which is particularly notable in the context of adult ADHD [28, 30]. For example, all four of
the studies focussed on adult participants in the review by Den Heijer et al., focussed exclu-
sively on males [40–43]. There are several reasons underpinning a lack of focus on female
adult populations, including the lower diagnostic rate amongst females, specifically, and adults
in general [9, 52], leading to a desire to restrict the inclusion criteria to the age and gender
groups with higher diagnosis rates [43]. However, recent evidence suggests underdiagnosis of
ADHD in both adults [8, 53], and specifically, in adult females [54–56]. Thus, addressing this
gap becomes even more pressing considering such findings.

There is also limited research into whether the apparent positive effects of PA on ADHD-
associated symptoms vary between individuals with or without a formal diagnosis of ADHD.
Additionally, it is unclear whether PA may differentially impact on specific subtypes and
ADHD symptom expression, such as inattentive versus hyperactive symptomatology. Current
findings are equivocal, with some studies suggesting that PA leads to greater positive effects on
ADHD-associated symptoms for individuals with ADHD [41, 57, 58], while others suggest the
opposite effect [59]. Mixed findings could be due to studies using a dichotomous classification
of ADHD based solely on the presence/absence of a clinical diagnosis. This approach might
result in undiagnosed individuals with ADHD either being missing from the ADHD group
and/or contained within the non-ADHD group, and overlooks how PA may have varying
impacts on individuals with specific symptoms of ADHD. Determining whether the relation-
ship between PA and ADHD symptomatology is different between ADHD and non-ADHD
diagnosed individuals, alongside exploring under researched demographics such as age and
gender, is essential. Such insights are crucial for informing potential PA based treatments and
determining which populations may benefit most from the treatment and in what way.

Furthermore, research into potential moderating factors on the effect of PA on ADHD
symptoms has received scant attention, including motivation for exercise [60] and form of
exercise [29, 61]. Previous research has suggested that motivation can affect participation in
exercise [60, 62] (with frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise all positively correlated
with a more autonomous sense of motivation) [62] and that the form and combination of exer-
cise can affect ADHD symptoms differently [29, 61].

Given the above, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between levels of
PA and ADHD symptoms in adults, while exploring the effects of potential moderating vari-
ables. To overcome some of the problems noted above relating to adults and female represen-
tation, a further aim was to investigate relationships among participants who may not have a
formal diagnosis, but who may reach psychometrically-defined subclinical (i.e., proxy) thresh-
olds for ADHD. Based on the previous literature, it was hypothesised that: 1) there would be a
significant negative correlation between PA level and ADHD symptomatology; 2) there would
be no significant difference between the relationship between PA level and ADHD symptom-
atology in participants with and without a subclinical, proxy diagnosis of ADHD; 3) there
would be a significant difference in PA level based on motivation for exercise; and 4) there
would be a significant difference in ADHD symptomatology based on main form of exercise.

2. Method
2.1. Design

The study was a cross-sectional observational study. The primary variables of interest were
PA, ADHD symptomatology, and ADHD proxy diagnosis. Potential moderating variables
were demographic variables (e.g., age; gender), mood, hours’ sleep, and comorbidities. Further
variables of interest were forms of exercise, motivation for exercise, and fitness tracking use.

2.2. Participants

Participants were recruited online via social media adverts, email invitations, Survey Circle
[63], and a University Psychology participant pool. The study was advertised as: ‘Physical exer-
cise: Links with attention, organisation and behavioural inhibition in adults’, and participants
were not offered any financial reimbursement or compensation for taking part. Following a
detailed information page, participants provided informed consent via an electronic consent
page with Yes/No check boxes. Participants who did not agree to all consent statements were
redirected to the end of the survey and their data was not used. To be eligible to take part, par-
ticipants had to be at least 18 years of age and a resident of the United Kingdom. Further exclu-
sion criteria—applied after data was collected—included: not completing the study in full;
having duplicate responses to another respondent with same IP address (likely same partici-
pant responding twice); having unusable International Physical Activity Questionnaire–Long
Format (IPAQ-L) data (e.g., answers filled in incorrectly; scoring above the maximum limit
for the IPAQ-L; having repeated answers for questionnaires (suggesting automatic selection
and invalid responses); counting as extreme outliers in the IPAQ-L (defined as exceeding the
3rd quartile of IPAQ-L score + 3*IQR), and counting as an outlier in Total Forms of Exercise
(TFE) done in the past week (defined as exceeding the 3rd quartile of TFE score + 3*IQR). No
further inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied.

Participants were recruited between 19/12/2020 and 08/05/2021. Initially, 389 participants
accessed the survey, although 121 were subsequently excluded for the following reasons: not
providing consent (n = 13); being under 18 years old (n = 1); not being a resident of the UK
(n = 42); not completing the study in full (n = 33); having duplicate responses to another
respondent with same IP address (likely same participant responding twice; n = 12); having
unusable IPAQ-L data (e.g., answers filled in incorrectly; n = 6); scoring above the maximum
limit for the IPAQ-L (n = 7); having repeated answers for questionnaires (n = 3); counting as
extreme outliers in the IPAQ-L (n = 3), and counting as an outlier in forms of exercise done in
the past week (n = 1).

This left 268 participants, of whom 200 (74.63%) were female. Age ranged from 18 to 71
(M = 25.88, SD = 9.08) years, with further demographic information presented in supplemen-
tary information (S1 Table). Options for the Gender and Ethnicity question were based on the
categories recommended for use by the UK government [64].

G-Power calculations indicated that for 95% power, with a rejection criterion of p < .05, and

medium effect size (f’ = .15), that 184 participants would be needed for a multiple regression
with 12 potential predictors. Any potentially identifiable information (e.g., IP address, location
data) was removed during initial data screening and prior to formal analysis. The research was
approved by a University Departmental Research Ethics Committee (Reference number 5003).

2.3. Materials

The online survey was conducted online using Qualtrics [65]. Participants were asked to sup-
ply standard demographic details (age, gender, ethnicity, education, employment) and to

details about their: (1) physical fitness (height, weight, hours of sleep); (2) potential comorbid
conditions and medication (e.g., “Have you ever been diagnosed with any of the following condi-
tions/disorders” [10 options, such as: none; mood disorder; sleep disorders; other; etc], “If so do
you take any prescribed medication?”); (3) what types of exercise they performed (“In the last 7
days which forms of exercise listed here have you done?” [37 options, such as: none, archery,
climbing, football, other, etc]); (4) use of fitness trackers (“Do you use any fitness trackers? If so,
what?”); and (5) motivation for exercise (“What is your main reason / motivation for exercis-
ing?” [options = don’t exercise; for my appearance; self-defence; for social reasons; to lose
weight; fitness and health; other]). In addition, the survey contained the following standardised
questionnaires (see supplementary material ‘S1 Appendix’ for their psychometric properties):
The Adult ADHD Self Report Scale– 6 (ASRS-6) [66, 67]. The ASRS-6 was used to clas-

sify the proxy diagnostic status of participants in the current study. It is a 6-item scale listing
different symptoms of ADHD and is used as a screening tool for proxy diagnosis levels of
ADHD in adults. Respondents are required to use a 5-item Likert scale to indicate the fre-
quency of occurrence of symptoms (0 = never to 4 = very often). If a respondent has 4 or more
scores equal and above 2 for items 1–3, and equal and above scale 3 in items 4–6, then they are
considered to have symptoms highly consistent with ADHD (i.e., proxy diagnostic group).

The ADHD Rating Scale–IV with Adult prompts (ADHD-RS-IV with Adult Prompts)
[68]. The ASRS-IV was used to measure Total ADHD Symptomatology (T-ADHD-S), Inat-
tentive ADHD Symptomatology (I-ADHD-S); and Hyperactive ADHD Symptomatology
(H-ADHD-S). It is an 18-item self-report questionnaire based on DSM-IV criteria that assesses
the severity and frequency of ADHD symptoms in adults (ADHD symptomatology). Each
item comprises a collection of prompts (e.g. “Do you rush through work or activities?”) relating
to a specific symptom of ADHD (e.g. carelessness). Respondents respond to each item by how
much the prompts affect them on a scale of 0–3 (0 = None; 1 = Mild; 2 = Moderate; 3 = Severe).
Each item is given the highest score generated by any of its prompts (e.g. if one prompt gener-
ates 3, but the rest 2, the score for the item is 3). Responses are then summed to provide a com-
positive total score (T-ADHD-S) ranging from 0–54, where higher scores indicate greater
severity of ADHD symptoms. The questionnaire can also be broken down into 2 subscales
(comprised of 9 items each): inattentive ADHD symptoms (I-ADHD-S), and hyperactive
ADHD symptoms (H-ADHD-S). This measure was chosen as it is tailored for adult partici-
pants and because of its comprehensive measurement of a range of ADHD symptoms.

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire–Long Format, last seven days, self-
administered (IPAQ-L 7S) [69]. The IPAQ-L was used to measure PA level. It is a 27-item
questionnaire used to measure physical activity over the last seven days. Data can be converted
to Metabolic Equivalents (MET), defined as the amount of oxygen consumed by the body
while sitting at rest. The questionnaire guidelines state the maximum amount of exercise that
can be done during a week is 16 hours a day, leading to a total range of 0–53760 METs. The
scale can be broken down into four subscales/domains: work; travel; domestic, and leisure.
This questionnaire was chosen due to it being well established in related research, the outcome
variable being METs (a commonly used outcome variable allowing data to be easily compared
across-studies), and its focus on a range of domains.

Other questionnaires. To investigate potential moderators, additional variables were
examined using various measures such as The Personal Health Questionnaire– 4 [70] (to mea-
sure mood); The Big Five Inventory– 10 (to measure personality) [71], and the Body Mass
Index (to measure physical fitness). Other self-devised questionnaires were developed to mea-
sure average hours slept (e.g., “How many hours of sleep a day do you get on average?) and fit-
ness app use (e.g., “Do you use any fitness tracking tools [Fitbit, smartphone apps, etc]”).
However, as these variables were not found to have significant links with key study variables,

they were not included in any further analysis and are not described in detail here (for further
detail see supplementary material ‘S2 Appendix’).

2.4. Procedure

Participants accessed the survey online via Qualtrics and consenting participants were asked
to complete: demographic questions; the ASRS-6; questions on physical fitness; questions on
comorbid conditions and medication; the ADHD-RS-IV with Adult Prompts; the IPAQ-L;
questions about what types of exercise they performed, and use of fitness trackers and motiva-
tion for exercise. All survey sections required a response (except for the questions in the
IPAQ-L a participant would have skipped), ensuring the survey was fully completed. There
was no time limit, and after excluding outliers (e.g., exceeding the 3rd quartile of total duration
+ 3*IQR), average completion time was 14 minutes, 37 seconds. Full procedural details can be
found in the supplementary material (S2 Appendix).

2.5. Data processing and statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics version 28 and PROCESS
v4.0 [72]. Additionally, JASP 0.16.3 was used to generate a correlation matrix.

IPAQ-L data was cleaned in accordance with the guidelines set out by the IPAQ group.
Data on comorbidities and forms of exercise were converted to ordinal data, by measuring
them as ‘Total Number of Comorbidities’ (TNC) and ‘Total Forms of Exercise’ (TFE) respec-
tively. Based on ASRS-6 scores, participants were categorised into either a non-ADHD or
proxy diagnostic group (participants who met the threshold of having symptoms highly con-
sistent with ADHD, as outlined in the materials subsection, were counted as ADHD proxy
diagnostic participants).

In terms of the statistical approach adopted, none of the variables were normally distrib-
uted, so non-parametric analyses were utilised, with median and IQR used as measures of cen-
tral tendency and dispersion respectively. Correlations between key variables (ADHD
symptomatology; PA level; TNC; TFE) were performed using Spearman’s Rank correlation.
Additionally, when investigating relationships between demographic variables and the two
main variables of interest (ADHD symptomatology and PA level), Kruskal-Wallis tests (for
education, ethnicity and employment), Mann Whitney U tests (for gender), and Spearman’s
Rank correlations (for age) were performed. To investigate the relationship between proxy
diagnostic group and gender, a chi square test of association was performed.

To investigate whether there was a significant negative correlation between PA level and
ADHD symptomatology (hypothesis 1), a three-stage multiple hierarchical regression was
conducted. ADHD symptomatology was the variable being predicted and PA level, age and
TNC were entered as predictor variables. A series of Spearman’s rho correlations were also
performed within the different subgroups (gender and proxy diagnostic groups) to further
investigate the relationships between PA and ADHD symptom subtypes.

A moderation analysis was then employed to investigate whether the relationship between

PA level and ADHD symptomatology differed in participants with or without a subclinical,
proxy diagnosis of ADHD (hypothesis 2). PA level was entered as the dependant variable (Y),
ADHD symptomatology as the independent variable (X), and ADHD proxy diagnosis as the
moderator (W) (see Fig 1).

To determine whether there was a significant difference in PA level based on motivation
for exercise (hypothesis 3), a Kruskal-Wallis Test was conducted. Finally, a Spearman’s rank
correlation was performed to assess the relationship between TFE and ADHD, allowing exam-
ination of whether ADHD symptomatology differed based on main form of exercise

(hypothesis 4). A regression analysis was additionally performed to ensure that findings were
not affected by PA level acting as a mediator between TFE and ADHD symptomatology (as PA
level and TFE had a high level of correlation).

3. Results
3.1. Descriptive and demographic statistics

Table 1 shows the mean (interquartile range deviations) for the variables. Preliminary analyses
of demographic variables, correlation coefficients, and a correlation matrix of scatterplots of
main study variables can be found in the supplementary material (S3 Appendix, S2 Table and
S1 Fig, respectively).

Table 2 shows the frequencies for Gender and Main motivation for exercise split by ADHD
proxy diagnostic group. Visual depictions of bar charts can be found in supplementary mate-
rial (S2 and S3 Figs).

Table 2 shows that within the proxy diagnostic group, there was a slightly higher ratio of
females (76.92%), compared to the non-ADHD group (73.17%). However, a chi-square test
found no significant difference in the prevalence of proxy diagnosis of ADHD between males
and females, χ2(1) = 0.79, p = .376, φ = .054 (three participants who selected ‘other’ or ‘prefer
not to say’ were not included in the analysis).

3.2. Relationship between PA level and ADHD symptomatology

To investigate the relationship between PA level and ADHD symptomatology (hypothesis 1), a
three-step hierarchical multiple regression was conducted with T-ADHD-S as the dependant
variable, and age and TNC added as control variables (Table 3). Age was entered in Step one,
TNC was entered in Step two, and PA level was entered in Step three. Prior to conducting a
hierarchical multiple regression, the relevant assumptions of this statistical analysis were
tested. Firstly, a sample size of 268 was considered sufficient for 3 independent variables to be
included in the analysis. The assumption of singularity was met as the independent variables
(Age, TNC and PA level) were not a combination of other independent variables. An examina-
tion of correlations revealed that no independent variables were highly correlated with one
another, and collinearity statistics (i.e. tolerance and VIF) were all within acceptable limits.
Thus, the assumption of multicollinearity was deemed to have been met. In addition, residual

and scatter plots indicated that the assumptions of normality, linearity and homoscedasticity
were all met.

In Step one, age significantly contributed to the regression model, F(1,266) = 5.22, p = .023,
accounting for approximately 1.9% of the variance in T-ADHD-S. When TNC was entered in
Step two, the overall regression model remained significant, F(2,265) = 18.15, p = < .001), with
TNC accounting for an additional 10.1% of the variance in T-ADHD-S. When PA level was
entered in Step three, the overall regression model remained significant F(3,264) = 12.2, p = <
.001), and accounted for 12.2% of the variance–but PA level only accounted for an additional
0.1% of variance and was not a significant unique predictor. In contrast, Age and TNC were both
significant unique predictors, with the latter being the strongest overall predictor. Thus, these
findings suggest that PA level and total ADHD symptomatology are not significantly associated.
To investigate relationships between PA and ADHD symptom subtypes, a series of Spear-

man’s rho correlations were performed within the different subgroups (Table 4). Results

showed that although there was no significant relationship between PA and T-ADHD-S in the
total sample (nor between PA and H-ADHD-S), there was a significant negative correlation
between PA and I-ADHD-S, r(266) = -.14, p = .02, and a significant negative correlation
between PA leisure and T-ADHD-S, r(266) = -.13, p = .03. This suggests that while there may
not be a significant relationship between overall PA level and total ADHD symptomatology,
significant negative relationships emerge when PA and ADHD symptomatology is split into
sub-measures, such as PA leisure (representing more Physical Exercise) and inattentive
ADHD symptoms.

Further, PA was not significantly correlated with any ADHD symptom types in the non-
ADHD group, but there were significant negative correlations between PA and I-ADHD-S in
the proxy diagnostic group r(102) = -.24, p = .016. Similarly, while PA was not significantly
correlated with any ADHD symptom types in males, there was a significant negative correla-
tion between PA and I-ADHD-S in females r(198) = -.18, p = .01). This suggests that that any
significant negative correlations between PA and inattentive ADHD symptomatology might
be specific to proxy ADHD individuals and females.

3.3. Effect of proxy ADHD diagnostic status on the relationship between
PA level and ADHD symptomatology

The moderating role of proxy diagnosis of ADHD on the relationship between PA level and
ADHD symptomatology (hypothesis 2) was assessed to determine if the strength of the corre-
lation was different between proxy diagnostic ADHD participants and non-ADHD partici-
pants. A test of unconditional interaction was performed using PROCESS macro (with proxy
ADHD diagnosis as moderator, PA level as predictor, and T-ADHD-S as the outcome), with
the change in R2 due to interaction of predictor and moderator (Table 5). Altogether, 26.12%
of the variability in T-ADHD-S was predicted by the variables, R2 = .26, F(3,264) = 31.11, p <
.001. The interaction (shown in Fig 2) was not significant, as the impact of PA level on
T-ADHD-S in non-ADHD participants was not significantly different from ADHD proxy
diagnostic participants (b = 0, 95% C.I. [>-.01, < .01], t = .242, p = .809). Table 6 presents the
conditional effect of PA at the two levels of Proxy ADHD diagnosis. This suggests that the rela-
tionship between PA and ADHD symptomatology is not significantly different based on
ADHD diagnostic status.

3.4. Effect of motivation for exercise on PA level

To determine whether there was a significant difference in PA level based on the main form of
motivation for exercise (e.g., “For social reasons”, “For my appearance”), a Kruskal-Wallis
Test was conducted (hypothesis 3). No significant differences, H(5) = 5.10, p = .404) were
found across the five categories of participants. Therefore, this suggests that PA level does not
differ based on an individual’s main form of motivation for exercise.

3.5. Relationship between forms of exercise and ADHD symptomatology

Next, In relation to whether ADHD symptomatology differed based on main form of exercise
(hypothesis 4), a Spearman’s rank correlation confirmed that there was no significant correla-
tion between TFE and T-ADHD-S, rs(266) = -.114, p = .063. However, to ensure that the find-
ings were not affected by PA level acting as a mediator between TFE and T-ADHD-S (as PA
level and TFE had a high level of correlation), PA level was also controlled for in a regression
analysis. Specifically, a two-stage hierarchical multiple regression was conducted, with
T-ADHD-S as the dependent variable (Table 7). PA level was entered in Step one, and TFE
entered in Step two. In Step one, PA did not contribute significantly to the regression model, F
(1,266) = 0.48, p = .498, and accounted for only 0.2% of the variation in T-ADHD-S. When
TFE was entered in Step two, it accounted of for an additional 0.9% of the variance in
T-ADHD-S, and the overall model was not significant, F(1,265) = 2.50, p = .115). In total, the
final model accounted for 1.1% of the variance in T-ADHD-S, which was not significant. As
such, this suggests that there is no significant relationship between total ADHD symptomatol-
ogy and the number of forms of exercise engaged in (after controlling for PA level).

4. Discussion

Building on initial research primarily conducted with children [27–31], the overarching aim of
this study was to investigate the relationship between levels of PA and ADHD symptoms in
adults, while exploring the effects of potential moderating variables. Addressing some of the
limitations of prior research in this area, a further aim was to investigate the relation between
PA and ADHD symptoms among participants who may not have a formal diagnosis, but who
may reach psychometrically-defined subclinical (i.e., proxy) thresholds for ADHD. In contrast
to prior research [27–31], there was no significant correlation between ADHD symptom sever-
ity or PA level. There was also no significant difference in the strength of correlation between
ADHD symptom severity or PA level based on proxy ADHD diagnosis. There was however a
significant negative correlation between inattentive ADHD symptom severity and PA level,
and between ADHD symptom severity and PA level in the leisure domain. Extending prior
research [29, 61, 62] no significant difference in PA level based on motivation for exercise was
found, and there was also no significant difference in ADHD symptomatology based on main
form of exercise. This means that hypothesis 1 was partially supported; hypothesis 2 was sup-
ported, and hypotheses 3 and 4 were not supported. The main findings of the study are dis-
cussed further below.

Based on prior literature [27–31], it was hypothesised that there would be a significant neg-
ative correlation between PA level and ADHD symptomatology (hypothesis 1). In contrast to
this, no significant correlation between PA level and total ADHD symptomatology was found

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0314508 February 11, 2025

PLOS ONEAssociation of exercise and ADHD symptoms

in the sample as a whole. This contrasts with previous research by Abramovitch et al. [43] who
found that individuals engaging in high levels of PA reported significantly fewer ADHD symp-
toms (i.e., behavioural impulsivity and worrisome and intrusive thoughts). When spilt by
ADHD subtype in this study though, PA was found to have a significant negative correlation
with inattentive ADHD symptomatology, and a positive (albeit not significant) relationship
with hyperactive ADHD symptomatology. The difference between the strength of these two
correlations was found to be statistically significant also [73], potentially suggesting that PA
may only have a significant effect on reducing inattentive ADHD symptoms, and not hyperac-
tive ones. The other possibility though is that individuals with predominantly hyperactive
ADHD symptoms are more likely to engage in PA than individuals with predominantly inat-
tentive ADHD symptoms. This would align with prior research finding that inattentive symp-
toms in childhood predicted reduced PA in adolescence, whilst the opposite was true for
hyperactive symptoms [74], and that individuals with hyperactive presentations may engage
with PA as a way of coping and self-treating their symptoms. However, these possible explana-
tions are not mutually exclusive (and both could potentially be contributing to the observed
findings) and would need to be investigated further via alternative experimental designs before
drawing more definitive conclusions.

Furthermore, greater understanding can also come from breaking down the PA measure-
ment into more specific subcategories, with PA from the leisure domain showing a significant
negative correlation with general ADHD symptoms and inattentive symptoms, but a positive
(non-significant) correlation with hyperactive ADHD symptoms. This could suggest that any
positive effects of PA on ADHD symptoms in adults may be reserved to physical exercise,
rather than other forms of physical activity. This view is supported by existing research that
has found increased benefits of voluntary exercise (which would likely be the case in the leisure
domain), compared to involuntary and forced exercise (which would be more similar to the
other domains) [75–77]. This finding could also support the earlier suggestion that individuals
with predominantly hyperactive ADHD symptoms are more likely to engage in PA than indi-
viduals with predominantly inattentive ADHD symptoms. Either way though, these nuanced
findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between physical activity versus physical
exercise when exploring the relationship between PA level and ADHD symptomatology.

However, our findings lend support for the second hypothesis, that there would be no sig-
nificant difference between the strength of relationship between PA level and ADHD symp-
tomatology in participants with and without a proxy ADHD diagnosis. Again, the findings
initially appear to contradict existing research reporting that the rate of improvement of PA on
ADHD symptomatology is slightly greater in ADHD subjects [41, 57, 58]. For example, Ponti-
fex et al. [57] concluded that only children with diagnosed ADHD exhibited exercise-induced
facilitations in action monitoring processes, and regulatory adjustments in behaviour, after
exercise. One explanation for the apparent difference in findings, is that previous research
only observed a significant acute effect of PA on ADHD. In contrast, the measure of ADHD
symptomatology in this study would likely only reflect a chronic effect of PA. If the differences
in effect size between ADHD and non-ADHD subjects is due to acute and not chronic term
effects, then this could not be reflected in a correlation study such as this. Additionally, Wigal
et al. [59] found that exercise caused a significantly greater increase in dopamine, norepineph-
rine and epinephrine for children without than with ADHD. It is also important to note, that
when looking at hyperactive or inattentive ADHD symptoms specifically when split by proxy
diagnosis, the only significant correlation was a negative one between inattentive ADHD
symptoms and PA level in ADHD proxy diagnostic participants. This could suggest that any
positive relationships between, and potential effects of PA on ADHD symptomatology, were
not only exclusive to inattentive ADHD symptoms, but also only reached a significant level for

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0314508 February 11, 2025

13 / 21

PLOS ONEAssociation of exercise and ADHD symptoms

subjects with a proxy, subclinical level of ADHD. This could also partially explain initial differ-
ences in findings highlighted earlier with Abramovitch et al. [43], as they only sampled indi-
viduals with ADHD. However, owing to the correlational design of the current study, these
findings could also suggest that only subjects with a proxy, subclinical diagnosis of ADHD as
well as predominantly inattentive symptoms, are significantly less likely to engage in PA than
other subjects (subjects without a proxy, subclinical diagnosis of ADHD; and subjects with a
proxy, subclinical diagnosis but with predominantly hyperactive symptoms). However, a
groupwise correlation analysis found that there was no significant difference in the strength of
correlation between PA level and inattentive ADHD symptoms when split by proxy ADHD
diagnosis (despite one correlation being significant, and one being non-significant), suggesting
that not too much weight should be given to this possibility.

It was also hypothesised that there would be a significant difference in PA level based on
motivation for exercise (hypothesis 3), which was not supported by the current data. While
most research into motivation and PA has been focused on levels of motivation (and therefore
is not applicable to the data in this study), the findings of this study, in regard to motivation
type, contradict the limited amount of relevant research. No significant difference was found
in PA level based on motivation type, which is partially supported by previous research from
Cash et al. [78] who found that there was no significant correlation between exercise frequency
and most reasons for exercise. However, direct comparison is difficult as their sample was
exclusively female and they also used different measurement tools (e.g., motivation was mea-
sured using the Reasons for Exercise Inventory and PA was measured by weekly exercise fre-
quency). Additionally, our findings conflict with research from Duncan et al. [62], who found
that greater frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise were correlated with more autono-
mous than controlling regulations. Reasons for this discrepancy are likely due to differences in
the measurement of motivation: while the current study based different motivation types
around potential different reasons, Duncan et al. [62] based it around self-determination the-
ory (e.g., intrinsic; identified; introjected; and external). This could suggest that while the pre-
cise reasons for motivation may not be important for improving PA engagement (and any
potential PA based intervention), their source (internal versus external) may be. This could be
particularly relevant to adults with ADHD as the extrinsic motivations for children to engage
in interventions (e.g., compelled to by parents/school) would be less present for adults who
would rely more on intrinsic motivations [79].

Unfortunately, it was not possible to fully explore our hypothesis that there would be a sig-
nificant difference on ADHD symptomatology based on main form of exercise (hypothesis 4),
as it was not possible to effectively group different forms of exercise. Therefore, the total num-
ber of different forms of exercise performed by an individual were instead investigated. Previ-
ous literature has suggested that more combined based PA interventions (involving both
aerobic and strength training) can lead to more positive benefits than singular based interven-
tions [29, 61]. Our findings seemed to conflict with this as there was no significant correlation
between total forms of exercise performed by a participant and ADHD symptomatology. How-
ever, like the main relationship between PA level and ADHD symptomatology, when ADHD
symptomatology was split by type, it was found that hyperactive ADHD symptoms had a non-
significant positive correlation with total forms of exercise, whereas inattentive symptoms had
a significant negative correlation. Hypothetically, this could suggest that any positive effects of
combining different exercise types are only found in inattentive ADHD symptoms/subtypes;
and/or individuals with predominantly inattentive ADHD symptoms are less likely to try out
different forms of exercise. However, note that the exact direction and nature of any such
effects would have to be determined via additional work with an alternative study design.

PLOS ONEAssociation of exercise and ADHD symptoms

Another unexpected finding was the lack of any significant difference in proxy diagnostic

rates of ADHD when split by gender. As already outlined, previous research has focused
largely on males due to higher diagnosis rates, potentially overlooking a large sample of
females with ADHD due to underdiagnosis. The findings of the study potentially support the
claim of female underdiagnosis in ADHD [55] and suggest that the prevalence rate is much
more even across males and females. Of particular interest was the finding that when the data
was split by gender, the negative correlation between inattentive ADHD symptoms and PA
level was not significant in males but reached a high level of significance in females (p = .01).

One possible implication of our findings to policy and practice, is that efforts to incorporate

exercise into treatment regimens for adult ADHD may benefit from being focused towards
individuals with the predominantly inattentive presentation of ADHD than other presenta-
tions (combined or hyperactive), either because: the positive effects of exercise are most signifi-
cant in inattentive ADHD symptoms; and/or individuals with predominantly inattentive
ADHD are less likely to already be engaged in exercise than those with other presentations.
However, owing to the correlational nature of our design, it should be acknowledged that our
findings could also suggest instead that individuals with hyperactive ADHD may be more
open and likely to engage with exercise-based interventions. This could then imply the oppo-
site: that exercise treatments could have greater effect when focused on individuals with hyper-
active than inattentive symptomatology. Thus, a dual approach may be beneficial: encouraging
exercise among individuals with a predominantly inattentive subtype, whilst leveraging the
tendency for those with hyperactive presentations to perhaps already engage in PA.

As there was no significant difference between motivation types on PA level, this also sug-
gests that motivation might not be a variable of importance when designing potential exercise
interventions. Instead, it suggests that if an individual can be motivated in some way, and this
motivation is primarily internal rather than external, this should lead to increased commit-
ment with any interventions [62]. Therefore, rather than interventions focusing their promo-
tion of exercise for a particular reason (e.g., focusing on specifically the health benefits, or
social aspects, or appearance etc), which might not be important or relevant to individuals
(and act as external regulations), professionals may benefit from adopting an individualistic
approach: taking time with individuals to find out what potential motivations are the most
important to them specifically (acting as internal regulations), and focusing on those to pro-
mote exercise. That is, interventions should be personalised, identifying and fostering the most
relevant motivations for each individual. In turn, this could enhance adherence to, and poten-
tially the effectiveness of, PA-based interventions. It is important to note though that this
study was not able to differentiate between the different forms of exercise and consequently, it
is unclear if any particular form of exercise should be promoted over others.

4.1. Limitations and future directions

Our study has a number of limitations that should be taken into account when considering its
implications for practice (i.e., intervention design) and suggestions for further research. Data
collection occurred between December 2021 and March 2022, at a time when COVID-19 lock-
down conditions were largely in place in the UK. This could have affected participants answers
on the IPAQ-L, as they might not have been able to engage in as much PA as normal. The sam-
ple was also biased towards females, students, and younger adults. This may have contributed
towards the main measures of PA and ADHD symptomatology not being normally distributed
as students may engage in less PA than the general population, thus leading to the negative
skew in the IPAQ-L. Therefore, given the composition of the sample and study context, our
findings may not be generalisable to a more diverse population. A lack of specificity in some

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0314508 February 11, 2025

15 / 21

PLOS ONEAssociation of exercise and ADHD symptoms

measurement types also limited the amount of analysis possible. Thus, future studies would
benefit from utilising more detailed and specific measures (i.e., types of exercise, motivation)
where practicable and feasible, to allow a more nuanced analysis and understanding of their
potential effects.

Additionally, future research could profitably focus on investigating potential cause and
effect relationships between PA and ADHD symptomatology. Longitudinal research could
focus on how likely adult individuals with ADHD are to undertake (and continue to engage
with) PA and/or how long-term PA effects different ADHD symptomatology. The effective-
ness of PA on different ADHD symptoms would need to be considered alongside how likely
individuals with different ADHD presentations are to engage with PA (during the develop-
ment of any potential PA treatment) to ensure that it would have the greatest efficacy.

To enable further evaluation of the potential effectiveness of PA on ADHD symptomatol-
ogy, and/or the likelihood of those with ADHD fruitfully engaging with PA, future work may
also wish to explore different types of ADHD symptoms and presentations, and to also differ-
entiate between inattentive and hyperactive subtypes, rather than treat ADHD as a monolith
category [27–31]. In turn, additional insights gained could help improve the efficacy and
potential cost-effectiveness of any interventions also (e.g., by allowing for greater determina-
tion on who would benefit the most from/be more likely to engage with any treatments).

Similarly, the findings highlight the importance of further addressing ADHD in females in
this area. Using subclinical/proxy diagnostic measures might allow for a much higher rate of
female participation, as well as supporting future research to more easily reach sufficient sam-
ple sizes for robust analysis. Secondly, the findings suggest that the correlation between PA
and ADHD symptomatology is different between genders. Whether this is due to the effect of
PA being different in females, or because ADHD in females makes them less inclined to per-
form PA than males, is currently unclear and warrants further investigation. As such, future
research should try to distinguish between demographic factors such as gender and ADHD
presentation type, as failing to do so may lead to overlooking potentially significant differences
among individuals with ADHD. Indeed, considering the nature of ADHD and its potential
interactions with various external factors, it is important that future research more broadly
considers potential confounding variables throughout the research process. For instance, PA
preferences and energy levels may vary across age, comorbidities may interact with ADHD
symptoms and affect individuals’ motivation or ability to engage in PA, and lockdown circum-
stances may result in decreased PA levels.

Additionally future research could focus on developing evidence-based standardisations for

different aspects measured in this study, to allow for greater analytical specificity. Research
into the effects and relationships of different types of motivation and forms of exercise would
be greatly enhanced by more clear-cut categorisations, also allowing for greater meta-analysis
and comparison between studies.

4.2. Conclusion

To conclude, the findings of this study suggest that the relationship between PA and ADHD
symptomatology is complex, and may need to be broken down into smaller, more specific fac-
tors to be properly understood. Specifically, while there was no significant relationship
between PA level and total ADHD symptomatology, further analysis suggests that significant
relationships may exist between specific subtypes of PA (such as physical exercise) and ADHD
(such as inattentive ADHD symptoms), as well as within specific subgroups (such as females
and individuals with ADHD). This underscores the need for additional detailed investigations
to further elucidate the relationship between PA level and ADHD symptomatology in adults,

and to enable evaluation of the potential effectiveness of PA as a potential adjunct therapeutic
option.
