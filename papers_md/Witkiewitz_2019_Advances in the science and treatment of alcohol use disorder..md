Advances in the science and treatment 
of alcohol use disorder
K. Witkiewitz1, R. Z. Litten2, L. Leggio3,4,5*

Alcohol is a major contributor to global disease and a leading cause of preventable death, causing approximately 
88,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Alcohol use disorder is one of the most common psychiatric 
disorders, with nearly one-third of U.S. adults experiencing alcohol use disorder at some point during their lives. 
Alcohol use disorder also has economic consequences, costing the United States at least $249 billion annually. 
Current pharmaceutical and behavioral treatments may assist patients in reducing alcohol use or facilitating alcohol 
abstinence. Although recent research has expanded understanding of alcohol use disorder, more research is 
needed to identify the neurobiological, genetic and epigenetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors 
most critical in the etiology and treatment of this disease. Implementation of this knowledge in clinical practice 
and training of health care providers is also needed to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment of individuals 
suffering from alcohol use disorder.

INTRODUCTION
In most regions of the world, most adults consume alcohol at least 
occasionally (1). Alcohol is among the leading causes of preventable 
death worldwide, with 3 million deaths per year attributable to alcohol. 
In the United States, more than 55% of those aged 26 and older 
consumed alcohol in a given month, and one in four adults in this 
age group engaged in binge drinking (defined as more than four 
drinks for women and five drinks for men on a single drinking 
occasion) (2). Excessive alcohol use costs U.S. society more than 
$249 billion annually and is the fifth leading risk factor for premature 
death and disability (3).

The morbidity and mortality associated with alcohol are largely 
due to the high rates of alcohol use disorder in the population. Alcohol 
use disorder is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for 
Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) (4) as a pattern of alcohol 
consumption, leading to problems associated with 2 or more of 
11 potential symptoms of alcohol use disorder (see Table 1 for criteria). 
In the United States, approximately one-third of all adults will meet 
criteria for alcohol use disorder at some point during their lives (5), 
and approximately 15.1 million of U.S. adults meet criteria for alcohol 
use disorder in the previous 12 months (6). The public health impacts 
of alcohol use extend far beyond those individuals who drink alcohol, 
engage in heavy alcohol use, and/or meet criteria for an alcohol use 
disorder. Alcohol use is associated with increased risk of accidents, 
workplace productivity losses, increased medical and mental health 
costs, and greater rates of crime and violence (1). Analyses that take 
into account the overall harm due to drugs (harm to both users and 
others) show that alcohol is the most harmful drug (7).

Only a small percent of individuals with alcohol use disorder 
contribute to the greatest societal and economic costs (8). For example, 
in the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey (total 
n = 43,561), a household survey conducted across the United States, 
11.8% met criteria for an alcohol use disorder (n = 5124) (6). Of these 
5124 individuals, 67.4% (n = 3455) met criteria for a mild disorder 
(two or three symptoms, based on DSM-5), 18.8% (n = 964) met 
criteria for a moderate disorder (four or five symptoms, based on DSM-5), 
and only 13.8% (n = 705) met criteria for a severe disorder (six or 
more symptoms) (6). There is a large treatment gap for alcohol use 
disorder, arising from the fact that many individuals with alcohol use 
disorder do not seek treatment. Those with a mild or moderate alcohol 
use disorder may be able to reduce their drinking in the absence of 
treatment (9) and have a favorable course; but it is those with more 
severe alcohol use disorder who most often seek treatment and who 
may experience a chronic relapsing course (10).

HISTORY OF TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER
Near the end of the 18th century, the Pennsylvania physician Benjamin 
Rush described the loss of control of alcohol and its potential treat-
ments (11). His recommendations for remedies and case examples 
included practicing the Christian religion, experiencing guilt and shame, 
pairing alcohol with aversive stimuli, developing other passions in 
life, following a vegetarian diet, taking an oath to not drink alcohol, 
and sudden and absolute abstinence from alcohol. Through the 1800s 
and early 1900s, the temperance movement laid the groundwork for 
mutual help organizations, and the notion of excessive alcohol use 
as a moral failing. During the same period, inebriate asylums emerged 
as a residential treatment option for excessive alcohol use, although 
the only treatment offered was forced abstinence from alcohol (12). 
The founding of Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) in the 1930s (13) 
and the introduction of the modern disease concept of alcohol use 
disorder (previously called “alcoholism”) in the 1940s (14) laid the 
groundwork for many of the existing treatment programs that re-
main widely available today. Over the past 80 years, empirical studies 
have provided support for both mutual support [A.A. and other 
support groups, such as SMART (Self-Management and Recovery 
Training)] and medical models of treatment for alcohol use disorder, 
as well as the development of new pharmacological and behavioral

initiatives (e.g., taxation, restrictions on advertising, and outlet density) 
and brief intervention programs (e.g., social norms interventions) 
that can be effective in reducing prevalence of alcohol use disorder 
and alcohol-related harms (1).

NEUROBIOLOGY OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDER
Alcohol use disorder is characterized by loss of control over alcohol 
drinking that is accompanied by changes in brain regions related to 
the execution of motivated behaviors and to the control of stress and 
emotionality (e.g., the midbrain, the limbic system, the prefrontal 
cortex, and the amygdala). Mechanisms of positive and negative re-
inforcement both play important roles with individual drinking 
behavior being maintained by positive reinforcement (rewarding and 
desirable effects of alcohol) and/or negative reinforcement mechanisms 
(negative affective and physiological states that are relieved by alcohol 
consumption) (15, 16). At the neurotransmitter level, the positive 
reinforcing effects of alcohol are primarily mediated by dopamine, 
opioid peptides, serotonin, -aminobutyric acid (GABA), and endo-
cannabinoids, while negative reinforcement involves increased 
recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor and glutamatergic systems 
and down-regulation of GABA transmission (16). Long-term exposure 
to alcohol causes adaptive changes in several neurotransmitters, includ-
ing GABA, glutamate, and norepinephrine, among many others. 
Discontinuation of alcohol ingestion results in the nervous system 
hyperactivity and dysfunction that characterizes alcohol withdrawal 
(15, 16). Acting on several types of brain receptors, glutamate represents 

one of the most common excitatory neurotransmitters. As one of 
the major inhibitory neurotransmitters, GABA plays a key role in 
the neurochemical mechanisms involved in intoxication, tolerance, 
and withdrawal. This brief review can offer only a very simplified 
overview of the complex neurobiological basis of alcohol use disorder. 
For deeper, more detailed analysis of this specific topic, the reader is 
encouraged to consult other reviews (15, 16).

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL 
SYNDROME
Alcohol withdrawal symptoms may include anxiety, tremors, nausea, 
insomnia, and, in severe cases, seizures and delirium tremens. 
Although up to 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder pres-
ent with some withdrawal symptoms after stopping drinking, only 
a small percentage requires medical treatment for detoxification, and 
some individuals may be able to reduce their drinking spontaneously. 
Medical  treatment  may  take  place  either  in  an  outpatient  or, 
when clinically indicated, inpatient setting. In some cases, clinical 
monitoring may suffice, typically accompanied by supportive care for 
hydration and electrolytes and thiamine supplementation. For those 
patients in need of pharmacological treatment, benzodiazepines (e.g., 
diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, oxazepam, and midazolam) 
are the most commonly used medications to treat alcohol withdrawal 
syndrome. Benzodiazepines work by enhancing the effect of the GABA 
neurotransmitter at the GABAA receptor. Notably, benzodiazepines 
represent the gold standard treatment, as they are the only class 
of medications that not only reduces the severity of the alcohol 
withdrawal syndrome but also reduces the risk of withdrawal seizures 
and/or delirium tremens. Because of the potential for benzodiazepine 
abuse and the risk of overdose, if benzodiazepine treatment for 
alcohol withdrawal syndrome is managed in an outpatient setting, 
careful monitoring is required, particularly when combined with 
alcohol and/or opioid medications (17).

a-2 agonists (e.g., clonidine) and -blockers (atenolol) are some-
times used as an adjunct treatment to benzodiazepines to control 
neuro-autonomic manifestations of alcohol withdrawal not fully 
controlled by benzodiazepine administration (18). However, because 
of the lack of efficacy of a-2 agonists and -blockers in preventing 
severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome and the risk of masking with-
drawal symptoms, these drugs are recommended not as monotherapy, 
but only as a possible adjunctive treatment.

Of critical importance to a successful outcome is the fact that 
alcohol withdrawal treatment provides an opportunity for the patient 
and the health care provider to engage the patient in a treatment 
program aimed at achieving and maintaining long-term abstinence 
from alcohol or reductions in drinking. Such a treatment may in-
clude pharmacological and/or psychosocial tools, as summarized in 
the next sections.

PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT 
OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDER
U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved 
pharmacological treatments
Development of novel pharmaceutical reagents is a lengthy, costly, 
and expensive process. Once a new compound is ready to be tested 
for human research use, it is typically tested for safety first via phase 
0 and phase 1 clinical studies in a very limited number of individuals. 

2 of 11

Witkiewitz et al., Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 : eaax4043     25 September 2019SCIENCE ADVANCES | REVIEWEfficacy and side effects may then be further tested in larger phase 2 
clinical studies, which may be followed by larger phase 3 clinical 
studies, typically conducted in several centers and are focused on 
efficacy, effectiveness, and safety. If approved for use in clinical 
practice, this medication is still monitored from a safety standpoint, 
via phase 4 postmarketing surveillance.

Only three drugs are currently approved by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for use in alcohol use disorder. The 
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram was the first medica-
tion approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder by the FDA, 
in 1951. The most common pathway in alcohol metabolism is the 
oxidation of alcohol via alcohol dehydrogenase, which metabolizes 
alcohol to acetaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase, which con-
verts acetaldehyde into acetate. Disulfiram leads to an irreversible 
inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase and accumulation of acetaldehyde, 
a highly toxic substance. Although additional mechanisms (e.g., in-
hibition of dopamine -hydroxylase) may also play a role in disulfiram’s 
actions, the blockade of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity represents 
its main mechanism of action. Therefore, alcohol ingestion in the 
presence of disulfiram leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, 
resulting in numerous related unpleasant symptoms, including 
tachycardia, headache, nausea, and vomiting. In this way, disulfiram 
administration paired with alcohol causes the aversive reaction, initially 
proposed as a remedy for alcohol use disorder by Rush (11) in 1784. 
One challenge in conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled 
alcohol trial of disulfiram is that it is easy to break the blind unless 
the “placebo” medication also creates an aversive reaction when 
consumed with alcohol, which would then provide the same mecha-
nism of action as the medication (e.g., the placebo and disulfiram 
would both have the threat of an aversive reaction). Open-label 
studies of disulfiram do provide support for its efficacy, as compared 
to controls, with a medium effect size (19), as defined by Cohen’s d 
effect size ranges of small d = 0.2, medium d = 0.5, and large d = 0.8 
(20). The efficacy of disulfiram largely depends on patient motiva-
tion to take the medication and/or supervised administration, given 
that the medication is primarily effective by the potential threat of 
an aversive reaction when paired with alcohol (21).

The next drug approved for treatment of alcohol use disorder 
was acamprosate; first approved as a treatment for alcohol depen-
dence in Europe in 1989, acamprosate has subsequently been approved 
for use in the United States, Canada, and Japan. Although the exact 
mechanisms of acamprosate action are still not fully understood, there 
is evidence that it targets the glutamate system by modulating hyper-
active glutamatergic states, possibly acting as an N-methyl-d-aspartate 
receptor agonist (22). The efficacy of acamprosate has been evaluated 
in numerous double-blind, randomized controlled trials and meta- 
analyses, with somewhat mixed conclusions (23–26). Although a 
meta-analysis conducted in 2013 (25) indicated small to medium 
effect sizes in favor of acamprosate over placebo in supporting 
abstinence, recent large-scale trials conducted in the United States 
(27) and Germany (28) failed to find effects of acamprosate dis-
tinguishable from those of a placebo. Overall, there is evidence 
that acamprosate may be more effective in promoting abstinence 
and preventing relapse in already detoxified patients than in helping 
individuals reduce drinking (25), therefore suggesting its use as 
an important pharmacological aid in treatment of abstinent pa-
tients with alcohol use disorder. The most common side effect with 
acamprosate is diarrhea. Other less common side effects may 
include nausea, vomiting, stomachache, headache, and dizziness, 

although the causal role of acamprosate in giving these side effects 
is unclear.

A third drug, the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone, was 
approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence by the FDA in 
1994. Later, a monthly extended-release injectable formulation of 
naltrexone, developed with the goal of improving patient adherence, 
was also approved by the FDA in 2006. Naltrexone reduces craving 
for alcohol and has been found to be most effective in reducing 
heavy drinking (25). The efficacy of naltrexone in reducing relapse 
to heavy drinking, in comparison to placebo, has been supported in 
numerous meta-analyses (23–25), although there is less evidence for 
its efficacy in supporting abstinence (25). Fewer studies have been 
conducted with the extended-release formulation, but its effects on 
heavy drinking, craving, and quality of life are promising (29, 30). 
Common side effects of naltrexone may include nausea, headache, 
dizziness, and sleep problems. Historically, naltrexone’s package 
insert has been accompanied by a risk of hepatotoxicity, a precau-
tion primarily due to observed liver toxicity in an early clinical trial 
with administrating a naltrexone dosage of 300 mg per day to obese 
men (31). However, there is no published evidence of severe liver 
toxicity at the lower FDA-approved dosage of naltrexone for alcohol 
use disorder (50 mg per day). Nonetheless, transient, asymptomatic 
hepatic transaminase elevations have also been observed in some 
clinical trials and in the postmarketing period; therefore, naltrexone 
should be used with caution in patients with active liver disease and 
should not be used in patients with acute hepatitis or liver failure.

Additional pharmacological treatments approved 
for alcohol use disorder in Europe
Disulfiram, acamprosate, and naltrexone have been approved for 
use in Europe and in the United States. Pharmacologically similar to 
naltrexone, nalmefene was also approved for the treatment of alcohol 
dependence in Europe in 2013. Nalmefene is a m- and d-opioid 
receptor antagonist and a partial agonist of the k-opioid receptor 
(32). Side effects of nalmefene are similar to naltrexone; compared 
to naltrexone, nalmefene has a longer half-life. Meta-analyses have 
indicated that nalmefene is effective in reducing heavy drinking days 
(32). An indirect meta-analysis of these two drugs concluded that 
nalmefene may be more effective than naltrexone (33), although 
whether a clinically relevant difference between the two medications 
really exists is still an open question (34). Network meta-analysis 
and microsimulation studies suggest that nalmefene may have some 
benefits over placebo for reducing total alcohol consumption (35, 36). 
The approval of nalmefene in Europe was accompanied by some 
controversy (37); a prospective head-to-head trial of nalmefene and 
naltrexone could help clarify whether nalmefene has added benefits 
to the existing medications available for alcohol use disorder. Last, 
nalmefene was approved in Europe as a medication that can be taken 
“as needed” (i.e., on days when drinking was going to occur). Prior 
work has also demonstrated the efficacy of taking naltrexone only 
on days that drinking was potentially going to occur (38).

In addition to these drugs, a GABAB receptor agonist used to 
treat muscle spasms, baclofen, was approved for treatment of alcohol 
use disorder in France in 2018 and has been used off label for alcohol 
use disorder for over a decade in other countries, especially in other 
European countries and in Australia (39, 40). Recent human labora-
tory work suggests that baclofen may disrupt the effects of an initial 
priming dose of alcohol on subsequent craving and heavy drinking 
(41). Meta-analyses and systematic reviews examining the efficacy 

3 of 11

Witkiewitz et al., Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 : eaax4043     25 September 2019SCIENCE ADVANCES | REVIEWof baclofen have yielded mixed results (35, 39, 42); however, there is 
some evidence that baclofen might be useful in treatment of alcohol 
use disorder among individuals with liver disease (43, 44). Evidence 
of substantial heterogeneity in baclofen pharmacokinetics among 
different individuals with alcohol use disorder (41) could explain the 
variability in the efficacy of baclofen across studies. The appropriate 
dose of baclofen for use in treatment of alcohol use disorder remains 
a controversial topic, and a recent international consensus statement 
highlighted the importance of tailoring doses based on safety, tolera-
bility, and efficacy (40).

Promising pharmacological treatments
Numerous other medications have been used off label in the treat-
ment of alcohol use disorder, and many of these have been shown to 
be modestly effective in meta-analyses and systematic reviews 
(23, 24, 26, 35). Systematic studies of these medications suggest 
promising findings for topiramate, ondansetron, gabapentin, and 
varenicline. The anticonvulsant drug topiramate represents one of 
the most promising medications in terms of efficacy, based on its 
medium effect size from several clinical trials [for a review, see (45)], 
including a multisite clinical study (46). One strength of topiramate 
is the possibility of starting treatment while people are still drinking 
alcohol, therefore serving as a potentially effective treatment to initiate 
abstinence (or to reduce harm) rather than to prevent relapse in 
already detoxified patients (45). Although not approved by the FDA, 
it is worth noticing that topiramate is a recommended treatment for 
alcohol use disorder in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (47). 
A concern with topiramate is the potential for significant side effects, 
especially those affecting cognition and memory, warranting a slow 
titration of its dose and monitoring for side effects. Furthermore, 
recent attention has been paid on zonisamide, another anticonvulsant 
medication, whose pharmacological mechanisms of actions are 
similar to topiramate but with a better tolerability and safety profile 
(48). Recently published and ongoing research focuses on a potential 
pharmacogenetic approach to treatment in the use of topiramate to 
treat alcohol use disorder, based on the possibility that both efficacy 
and tolerability and safety of topiramate may be moderated by a 
functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2832407) in GRIK1, 
encoding the kainate GluK1 receptor subunit (49). Human labora-
tory studies (50) and treatment clinical trials (51) have also used a 
primarily pharmacogenetic approach to testing the efficacy of the 
antinausea drug ondansetron, a 5HT3 antagonist, in alcohol use dis-
order. Overall, these studies suggest a potential role for ondansetron 
in alcohol use disorder, but only in those individuals with certain 
variants of the genes encoding the serotonin transporter 5-HTT and 
the 5-HT3 receptor. The anticonvulsant gabapentin has shown 
promising results in human laboratory studies and clinical trials 
(52–54), although a more recent multisite trial with an extended-release 
formulation of the medication did not have an effect of gabapentin 
superior to that of a placebo (55). Although the latter findings might 
be related to potential pharmacokinetic issues secondary to the specific 
formulation used, it is nonetheless possible that gabapentin may be 
more effective in patients with more clinically relevant alcohol with-
drawal symptoms (52). Several human laboratory studies support a 
role for varenicline, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist 
approved for smoking cessation, in alcohol use disorder [for a review, 
see (56)], and two of three clinical trials also support its efficacy on 
alcohol outcomes (57–59), especially in heavy drinkers who are males 
(59) and in male and female alcohol-dependent individuals who are 

also smokers (60). Additional details on the FDA-approved medica-
tions and other medications tested in clinical research settings for 
the treatment of alcohol use disorder are summarized in Table 2.

The medications and targets described above have shown promising 
results in phase 2 or phase 3 medication trials. However, owing to 
the development of novel neuroscience techniques, a growing and 
exciting body of data is expanding the armamentarium of targets 
currently under investigation in animal models and/or in early- 
phase clinical studies. Pharmacological approaches with particular 
promise for future drug development include, but are not limited to 
the following [for recent reviews, see, e.g., (56, 61–68)]: the antipsy-
chotic drug aripiprazole, which has multiple pharmacological actions 
(mainly on dopamine and serotonin receptors), the antihypertensive 
alpha-1 blocker drugs prazosin and doxazosin, neurokinin-1 antago-
nism, the glucocorticoid receptor blocker mifepristone, vasopressin 
receptor 1b antagonism, oxytocin, ghrelin receptor antagonism, 
glucagon-like peptide-1 agonism, and pharmacological manipulations 
of the nociception receptor (We are intentionally using a general 
pharmacological terminology for the nociceptin receptor, given that 
it is unclear whether agonism, antagonism, or both may represent 
the best approach.). New medications development is particularly 
important for the treatment of comorbid disorders that commonly co- 
occur among individuals with alcohol use disorder, particularly 
affective disorders, anxiety disorders, suicidality, and other substance 
use disorders. This aspect of alcohol use disorder is relevant to the 
fact that addictive disorders often present with significantly more 
severe symptoms when they coexist with other mental health disorders 
(69). Likewise, there is evidence that pharmacotherapy is most effective 
when implemented in conjunction with behavioral interventions (70), 
and all phase 2 and phase 3 medication trials, mentioned above, 
have included a brief psychosocial behavioral treatment in combina-
tion with medication.

BEHAVIORAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS 
FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER
Evidence-based treatments
A wide range of behavioral and psychological treatments are avail-
able for alcohol use disorder, and many treatments are equally effective 
in supporting abstinence or drinking reduction goals (71–74). Treat-
ments with the greatest evidence of efficacy range from brief inter-
ventions, including motivational interviewing approaches, to operant 
conditioning approaches, including contingency management and 
the community reinforcement approach, to cognitive behavioral 
treatments, including coping skills training and relapse prevention, 
and to acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches. Twelve-step 
facilitation, which was designed specifically to connect individuals 
with mutual support groups, has also been shown to be effective (75). 
In addition, harm reduction treatments, including guided self-control 
training and controlled drinking interventions, have been successful 
in supporting drinking reduction goals (70).

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have found that brief inter-
ventions, especially those based on the principles of motivational inter-
viewing, are effective in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. These 
interventions can include self-monitoring of alcohol use, increasing 
awareness of high-risk situations, and training in cognitive and 
behavioral techniques to help clients cope with potential drinking 
situations, as well as life skills training, communication training, 
and coping skills training. Cognitive behavioral treatments can be

delivered in individual or group settings and can also be extended

Acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly 
being used to target alcohol use disorder and show evidence of effi-
cacy in a variety of settings and formats, including brief intervention 
formats (76). Active ingredients include raising present moment aware-
ness, developing a nonjudgmental approach to self and others, and 
increasing acceptance of present moment experiences. Acceptance- and 
mindfulness-based interventions are commonly delivered in group 
settings and can also be delivered in individual therapy contexts.

Computerized, web-based, and mobile interventions have also been 
developed, incorporating the principles of brief interventions, behav-
ioral and cognitive behavioral approaches, as well as mindfulness 
and mutual support group engagement; many of these approaches 
have demonstrated efficacy in initial trials (77–79). For example, the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has 
developed the Take Control computerized intervention that includes 
aspects of motivational interviewing and coping skills training and 

was designed to provide psychosocial support (particularly among those 
assigned to the placebo medication) and also to increase adherence and 
retention among individuals enrolled in pharmacotherapy trials (80).
Mutual support group (e.g., A.A. and SMART) attendance and 
engagement have been shown to be associated with recovery from 
alcohol use disorder, even in the absence of formal treatment (81). 
However, selection biases (e.g., people selecting to attend these groups) 
raise difficulties in assessing whether other factors that are associated 
with treatment effectiveness may be the active ingredients for im-
proving outcomes among those who attend mutual support groups. 
For example, individuals who are highly motivated to change might 
be more likely to attend mutual support groups. Likewise, mutual 
support groups often provide individuals with increased social network 
support for abstinence (82). Motivation to change and having a social 
network that supports abstinence (or reductions in drinking) are both 
factors that are associated with greater treatment effectiveness (83).
As noted above, most behavioral and psychological treatments are 
equally effective with small effect size differences [Cohen’s d = 2.0 to 0.3 

5 of 11

Witkiewitz et al., Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 : eaax4043     25 September 2019SCIENCE ADVANCES | REVIEW(20)] between active treatments (84–88). Behavioral interventions 
have also been shown to be as effective as pharmacotherapy op-
tions, with a 16-week cognitive behavioral intervention shown to be 
statistically equivalent to naltrexone in reducing heavy drinking days in 
a large randomized trial (27). One of the challenges of examining 
behavioral interventions in randomized trials is that intervention 
blinding and placebo controls cannot be implemented in most contexts, 
other than in computerized interventions. Furthermore, the general 
therapeutic factors common to most behavioral interventions (e.g., 
therapist empathy and supportive therapeutic relationship) in treatment 
of alcohol use disorder are as powerful as the specific therapeutic 
targets of specific behavioral interventions (e.g., teaching skills in a 
cognitive behavioral treatment) in facilitating behavioral change (89).

Promising future behavioral treatments 
and neuromodulation treatments
With respect to behavioral treatments, there are numerous opportu-
nities for the development of novel mobile interventions that could 
provide treatment and recovery support in near real time. This mobile 
technology may also extend the reach of treatments to individuals 
with alcohol use disorder, particularly in rural areas. On the basis of 
a contextual self-regulation model of alcohol use (90), it is critical to 
address the immediate situational context alongside the broader social, 
environmental, and familial context in which an individual experiences 
the world and engages in momentary decision-making. Ambulatory 
assessment, particularly tools that require only passive monitoring 
(e.g., GPS, heart rate, and skin conductance) and real-time support 
via mobile health, could provide immediate environmental supports 
and could extend the reach of medications and behavioral treatments 
for alcohol use disorder. For example, a mobile device could poten-
tially signal a high-risk situation by indicating the geographic location 
(near a favorite drinking establishment) and the heart rate (increased 
heart rate when approaching the establishment). The device could 
provide a warning either to the individual under treatment and/or 
to a person supporting that individual’s recovery. In addition, de-
velopments in alcohol sensing technology (e.g., transdermal alcohol 
sensors) could greatly increase rigor of research on alcohol use dis-
order and also provide real-time feedback on alcohol consumption 
levels to individuals who are attempting to moderate and/or reduce 
their alcohol use.

Recent advances in neuromodulation techniques may also hold 
promise for the development of novel treatments for alcohol use 
disorder. Deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, 
transcranial electrical stimulation (including transcranial direct 
current stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation), 
and real-time neurofeedback have recently been tested as potential 
treatments for addiction, although evidence in favor of these treatments 
is currently uncertain and focused mostly on intermediate targets (e.g., 
alcohol craving) (91). These techniques attempt to directly target spe-
cific brain regions and addiction-related cognitive processes via 
surgically implanted electrodes (deep brain stimulation), electrical 
currents or magnetic fields applied to the scalp (transcranial electrical 
and magnetic stimulation, respectively), or individual self-generated 
modulation via feedback (neurofeedback). Although robust large scale 
trials with double-blind, sham controls, and long-term follow-ups 
of alcohol behavior change and relapse have not been conducted (91), 
the heterogeneity of alcohol use disorder suggests that targeting one 
specific neural region may be insufficient to treat such a complex 
disorder, with its multiple etiologies and diverse clinical courses (92).

Factors contributing to the effectiveness of treatments
Numerous models have examined factors that predict treatment 
readiness, treatment engagement, and treatment outcomes for alcohol 
use disorder. The transtheoretical model of change proposes that an 
individual’s own readiness to change his or her drinking behavior 
may have an impact on treatment engagement and effectiveness 
(93). The dynamic model of relapse proposes the involvement of 
multiple interacting biological, psychological, cognitive, emotional, 
social, and situational risk factors that are static and dynamic in their 
association with treatment outcomes (83). Neurobiological models 
of addiction focus on the brain reward and stress system dysfunction 
that contributes to the development and maintenance of alcohol use 
disorder, that is, the “addiction cycle” (15, 16). The alcohol and ad-
diction research domain criteria (AARDoC) (92), which have been 
operationalized in the addictions neuroclinical assessment (94), 
focus on the following three domains that correspond to particular 
phases in the addiction cycle: incentive salience in the binge/intoxication 
phase, negative emotionality in the withdrawal/negative affect 
phase, and executive function in the preoccupation/anticipation phase. 
Within each domain of the AARDoC, the addictions neuroclinical 
assessment proposes constructs that can be measured at multiple levels 
of analysis, such as craving in the incentive salience domain, negative 
affect and emotion dysregulation in the negative emotionality domain, 
and cognitive impairment and impulsivity in the executive function 
domain. The AARDoC acknowledge that environmental and con-
textual factors play a role in alcohol use disorder and treatment out-
comes. Moreover, because of the heterogeneity of alcohol use disorder, 
the significance of these domains in causing alcohol use disorder 
and alcohol-related problems will vary among individuals.

Each of the abovementioned theoretical models proposes factors 
that may affect treatment effectiveness; however, many of the con-
structs proposed in each of these models are overlapping and likely 
contribute to the effectiveness of alcohol use disorder treatment 
across a range of populations and settings. A heuristic model com-
bining components from each of these models is shown in Fig. 1. 
Specifically, this model highlights the precipitants of alcohol use that 
are influenced by the neurobiological adaptations proposed in the 
addiction cycle (indicated by bold font) and additional contextual 
factors (regular font) that decrease or increase the likelihood of 
drinking in context, depending on whether an individual uses effective 
coping regulation in the moment. The domains supporting alcohol 
use/coping regulation (negative emotionality, executive function, 
incentive salience, and social environment) may interact to predict 
alcohol use or coping regulation in the moment. For example, network 
support for abstinence could improve decision-making and decrease 
likelihood of drinking. Conversely, experiences of physical pain are 
associated with increases in negative affect and poorer executive 
function, which could both increase likelihood of drinking. Both of 
these examples require environmental access to alcohol and a desire 
to drink alcohol. Treatment effectiveness will depend on the extent 
to which a particular treatment targets those risk factors that are most 
likely to increase or decrease the likelihood of drinking for each in-
dividual, as well as the personal resources that each individual 
brings to treatment and/or that could be enhanced in treatment. 
A functional analysis of contextual risk and protective factors can 
be critically important in guiding treatment.

For example, there is considerable heterogeneity in treatment 
response to naltrexone, which may vary in efficacy in some individu-
als. Recent studies conducted to determine whether certain patients

genetic, and epigenetic factors, that predict the transition from alcohol 
use to alcohol use disorder, although basic science models suggest 
that a cycle of neuroadaptations could be at play (15, 16). We also 
lack a basic understanding of how individuals recover from alcohol 
use disorder in the absence of treatment and what neurobiological, 
psychological, social, and environmental factors are most important 
for supporting recovery from alcohol use disorder. Gaining a better 
understanding of recovery in the absence of treatment, particularly 
modifiable psychological, neurobiological, and epigenetic factors, 
could provide novel insights for medications and behavioral treat-
ment development. Among many other factors, special attention is 
needed in future studies to shed light on the role of sex and gender 
in the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorder and on 
the response to pharmacological, behavioral, and other treatments.
The heterogeneity of alcohol use disorder presents a major challenge 
to scientific understanding and to the development of effective treat-
ments for prevention and intervention (92). For example, a DSM-5 
diagnosis of alcohol use disorder requires 2 or more symptoms, out 
of 11, over the past year. That requirement equates to exactly 2048 
potential symptom combinations that would meet the criteria of 
alcohol use disorder. An individual who only meets criteria for tolerance 
and withdrawal (i.e., physiological dependence) likely requires a very 
different course of treatment from an individual who only meets the 
criteria for failure to fulfill role obligations and use of alcohol in 
hazardous situations. Gaining a better understanding of the etiology 
and course of alcohol use disorder, as well as identifying whether 
different subtypes of drinkers may respond better to certain treat-
ments (103, 104), is critical for advancing the science of alcohol use 
disorder prevention and treatment. Alternative conceptualizations 
of alcohol use disorder may also aid in improving our understanding 
of the disorder and reducing heterogeneity. For example, the pending 
International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition, will simplify 
the diagnosis of alcohol dependence to requiring only two of three 
criteria in the past 12 months: (i) impaired control over alcohol use; 
(ii) alcohol use that dominates over other life activities; and (iii) 
persistence of alcohol use despite consequences. The diagnosis will 
be made with or without physiological dependence, as characterized 
by tolerance, withdrawal, or repeated use to prevent or alleviate 
withdrawal (105). It remains to be seen whether simplification of the 
criteria set will narrow our conceptualization or potentially increase 
heterogeneity of this disorder among those diagnosed with alcohol 
dependence.

Placebo effect
An additional challenge to development of pharmacological treat-
ments for alcohol use disorder is the high placebo response rates seen 
in drug trials (106). The tendency for individuals to have a good 
treatment response when assigned to placebo medication reflects both 
the high probability of recovery without treatment and the hetero-
geneity in the disorder itself. Many people who enter treatment are 
already motivated to change behavior, and receiving a placebo medica-
tion can help these individuals continue the process of change. Gaining 
a better understanding of which kinds of individuals respond to 
placebo and of the overall physiological and behavioral complexities 
in the placebo response is critical to identifying those individuals 
who will benefit the most from active medication. More generally, 
very little is understood about how motivation to change drinking 
behavior may influence the efficacy of active medications, particularly

may benefit more from naltrexone have yielded mixed findings (95). 
Promising evidence suggests that individuals with the OPRM1 
A118G G (Asp40) allele may have a better response to naltrexone 
(96–98); however, a prospective study of medication response among 
individuals stratified by presence of the Asp40 allele did not provide 
support for the genotype by treatment interaction (99), and recent 
human laboratory studies have not confirmed the hypothesized 
mechanisms underlying the pharmacogenomic effect (100). Initial 
evidence suggests that naltrexone may be more effective in reduc-
ing heavy drinking among smokers (101) and among those with a 
larger number of heavy drinkers in their social networks (102). 
With respect to reinforcement typologies, recent work has found that 
naltrexone may be more effective among those who tend to drink 
alcohol for rewarding effects (103), and acamprosate may also be more 
effective for individuals who drink to relieve negative affect (104).

GAPS IN SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND NEW RESEARCH 
DIRECTIONS
Heterogeneity of individuals with alcohol use disorder
This review has briefly summarized the treatments currently avail-
able for alcohol use disorder that are relatively effective, at least in 
some patients. Many new treatments are also being developed, and 
some of them seem promising. Nevertheless, numerous gaps in sci-
entific knowledge remain. Notably, most people who drink alcohol 
do not develop an alcohol use disorder, most people with alcohol 
use disorder do not seek treatment, and most of those who do not 
seek treatment “recover” from alcohol use disorder without treatment 

Witkiewitz et al., Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 : eaax4043     25 September 2019SCIENCE ADVANCES | REVIEWvia adherence mechanisms. Additional research on targeted (i.e., as 
needed) dosing of medications, such as nalmefene and naltrexone 
(32, 38), would be promising from the perspective of increasing adherence 
to medications and also raising awareness of potentially heavy 
drinking occasions.

Recent developments in pharmacological  
and behavioral approaches
In addition to gaining a better understanding of the disorder and 
who benefits from existing treatments, the examination of molecular 
targets for alcohol use disorder could open up multiple innovative direc-
tions for future translational research on the treatment of alcohol use 
disorder. Recent research has identified many targets that might be 
important for future medication trials (67). For example, most of 
the medication development efforts in past decades have focused on 
pathways and targets typically related to reward processing and 
positive reinforcement. While important, this approach ignores the 
important role of stress-related pathways (e.g., corticotropin release 
factor and other related pathways) in negative reinforcement and in 
the later stages of alcohol use disorder, which is often characterized by 
physical dependence, anxiety, and relief drinking [for reviews, see 
(15, 16)]. Furthermore, it is also becoming more and more apparent 
that other promising targets may be identified by looking at the brain 
not as an isolated system but rather as an organ with bidirectional 
interactions with peripheral systems. Examples of the latter approach 
include the growing evidence suggesting a potential role of inflam-
mation and neuroinflammation and of the gut-liver-brain axis in 
the neurobiological mechanisms that regulate the development 
and/or maintenance of alcohol use disorder (107–109). Moving med-
ications development from phase 1 to phase 2 and 3 trials has also 
been a difficulty in the field. Future directions that might improve 
translation of basic science into clinical practice include the broader 
use of human laboratory models and pilot clinical trials (110), as well 
as expanding the outcomes that might be targeted in phase 2 and 
phase 3 trials to include drinking reduction outcomes (111, 112).

New directions for behavioral treatment development include a 
greater focus on identifying effective elements of behavioral treat-
ments and on the components of treatment that are most critical for 
successful behavior change (89, 113). Studies investigating the effects 
of specific treatment components are critical for refining treatment 
protocols to more efficiently target the symptoms of alcohol use dis-
order. Continued development of mobile health interventions will 
also help with disseminating treatment to a wider range of individuals 
struggling with alcohol use disorder.

Translation of addiction science to clinical practice
Last, but not the least, there is also a critical need for more research 
on dissemination and implementation, given the fact that many 
treatment programs still do not incorporate evidence-based practices, 
such as cognitive behavioral skills training, mindfulness-based inter-
ventions, and medications. Both pharmacological and behavioral 
treatments for alcohol use disorder are markedly underused; the 
recent Surgeon General’s report Facing Addiction in America (114) 
highlights the fact that only about 1 in 10 people with a substance 
use disorder receives any type of specialty treatment. Therefore, basic 
science and human research efforts will need to be accompanied by 
translational approaches, where effective novel medications and 
precision medicine strategies are effectively translated from research 
settings to clinical practice. Greater integration of alcohol screening 

and medication in primary care and other clinical settings, as well as 
research on best methods for implementation, has great potential 
for expanding access to effective treatment options (115). Because 
the heterogeneity of alcohol use disorder makes it highly unlikely 
that one single treatment will work for all individuals, it is important 
to provide a menu of options for pharmacological and behavioral 
therapies to both clinicians and patients. Reducing the stigma of 
alcohol use disorder and moving toward a public health approach 
to addressing this problem may further increase the range of accept-
able treatment options.
