Aims: To test if contingency management (CM) interventions for alcohol and drug abstinence 
were associated with increased alcohol and drug abstinence among American Indian adults with 
alcohol dependence who also use drugs.

Design: In this 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial, American Indian adults with alcohol 
dependence, who also used drugs, were randomized to four conditions: 1) incentives for 
submission of urine samples only (control condition), 2) CM incentives for alcohol abstinence, 3) 
CM incentives for drug abstinence, or 4) CM incentives for abstinence from both alcohol and 
drugs.

Setting: A Northern Plains Reservation in the United States.

Participants: 114 American Indian adults aged 35.8 years [10.4]; 51% [n=58] were female.

Intervention and Comparator: Participants received incentives if they demonstrated 
abstinence from alcohol (CM for alcohol, n=30), abstinence from their most frequently used drug 
(CM for drugs, n=27) or abstinence from both alcohol and their most frequently used drug (CM 
for alcohol and drugs, n=32) as assessed by urine tests. Controls (n=25) received incentives for 
submitting urine samples only.

Measurements: Primary outcomes were urine ethyl glucuronide (alcohol) and drug tests 
conducted three times per week during the 12-week intervention period. Data analyses included 
listwise deletion and multiple imputation to account for missing data.

Findings: The three CM groups were significantly (p<.05) more likely to submit alcohol 
abstinent urine samples compared with the control condition, with odds ratios ranging from 2.4 to 
4.8. The CM for drugs and CM for alcohol and drugs groups were more likely to submit urine 
samples that indicated drug abstinence, with odds ratios ranging from 2.5 to 3.2, than the CM for 
alcohol, but these differences were not significant in multiple imputation analyses (p>.05).

Conclusions: Contingency management (CM) incentives for abstinence were associated with 
increased alcohol abstinence in American Indian adults diagnosed with alcohol dependence who 
also used drugs, living on a rural reservation. The effect of CM incentives on drug abstinence was 
inconclusive.

Despite having the highest prevalence of alcohol and drug abstinence of any racial group, 
many American Indian (AI) communities experience disproportionately high levels of 
problematic alcohol and illicit drug use (1–4). Substance use in AI communities contributes 
to a higher than expected number of alcohol and drug use-related deaths and other negative 
consequences (5–7). AI adults are more likely to concurrently use alcohol and illicit drugs 
compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. (1, 8) presenting additional challenges 
to treating substance use problems in this population. These inequities are, in part, a 
consequence of over 500 years of colonization, genocide, forced migration, boarding 
schools, institutionalized poverty, and other efforts to marginalize AI peoples (9, 10).

Nonetheless, AI communities are engaged in cultural revitalization. This revitalization 
includes use of culturally grounded and Western intervention approaches to treat drug and 
alcohol use. Examples include the Wellbriety movement, which integrates principles from 
Alcoholics Anonymous and Native cultural concepts (11) and adapted Western cognitive 
behavioral approaches (12) that include AI cultural teachings. Despite these efforts, AI 
adults have higher rates of treatment attrition than whites (12–14). Further, little is known 
about the effectiveness of alcohol and drug treatments in AI communities (12, 15, 16). Only 
three randomized controlled studies of alcohol or drug treatments in AI or Alaska Native 
adults have been published (13, 17, 18). Each evaluated a different approach to treatment 
ranging from culturally grounded sweat lodges (17), to motivational enhancement therapy 
(18), or oral naltrexone (13). All observed intervention-related reductions in alcohol use; 
however, these studies did not focus solely on AI or Alaska Native populations and none 
addressed concurrent use of alcohol and drugs. Additional studies are needed to determine 
what interventions are effective for AI people.

Contingency management (CM) is a behavioral intervention where tangible reinforcers (e.g., 
prizes or gift cards) are provided when biologically confirmed alcohol or drug abstinence is 
demonstrated, typically in the form of a urine test (19). CM is associated with large 
increases in both illicit drug (19–21) and alcohol abstinence (22–24). CM is a strength-based 
approach that is easily adapted to improve cultural acceptability, can be implemented by 
non-clinicians and integrated into ongoing substance use treatment, or be delivered as a 
standalone intervention. It also is inexpensive, with an average cost of $300-$500 for 12 
weeks of treatment (22). These features make CM an ideal tool for reducing co-use of 
alcohol and drugs in rural AI communities. Our qualitative work in AI and Alaska Native 
communities demonstrates that CM aligns well with community values. Suggestions for 
adaption included incentives that build family relationships (e.g., movie tickets, fishing and 
camping gear) and integration of Indigenous language and cultural concepts when delivering 
the intervention (25).

This study investigated the impact of three different CM interventions on alcohol and drug 
use in a sample of 114 AI adults diagnosed with alcohol dependence, who also used drug 
and resided in a Northern Plains Reservation. The aims of the study were to:

1.

2.

Test if CM interventions targeting a) alcohol abstinence, b) drug abstinence and 
c) alcohol and drug abstinence were associated with increased biologically 
confirmed alcohol and drug abstinence, relative to a control condition where 
individuals received incentives for providing urine samples only (no abstinence 
was required) during a 12-week intervention period.

Compare secondary outcomes, such as self-reported alcohol and drug use and 
attendance of those randomize to the three CM conditions to the control 
condition.

3.

Test if primary and secondary outcomes differed across CM groups.

Our hypotheses were that CM groups would attain higher levels of alcohol and drug 
abstinence during the intervention period, relative to controls (Aims 1 and 2) and that 
primary and secondary outcomes would differ across CM groups (Aim 3).

Participants

Procedure

The study was a 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial where participants were randomized to 
receive 12 weeks of tangible reinforcers according to the following four conditions: 1) 
submitting urine samples only (no abstinence required- non-contingent control), 2) 
submitting urine samples that demonstrated alcohol abstinence (CM for Alcohol), 3) 
submitting urine samples that demonstrated abstinence from their most used drug (CM for 
Drugs), and 4) submitting urine samples that demonstrated abstinence from both alcohol and 
their most used drug (CM for Alcohol and Drugs). Participants provided urine samples and 
received reinforcers based on their group assignment three times a week for 12 weeks. 
Participants could receive treatment-as-usual from community providers, but it was not 
required. Participants also completed follow-up interviews at one, three, and six months after 
the intervention period. Due to excessive missing data, follow-up outcomes were not 
reported. This study was approved by the Washington State University Institutional Review 
Board and by a Tribal Resolution from the community’s Tribal Council. Our study protocol 
was published previously (26).

The study was conducted in partnership with a Northern Plains Reservation, with a 
population of more than 6,000 tribal members. Inclusion criteria were self-reported AI race; 
age 18–65 years; seeking help for alcohol or drug use; a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 
Fourth Edition diagnosis of current alcohol dependence assessed by the MINI 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (27); self-reported illicit drug or prescription drug use without a 
prescription in the past 30 days; and ability to read and speak English. Exclusions included 
having a significant risk of dangerous alcohol or drug withdrawal, as determined by the 
Principal Investigator; use of opioid medications as prescribed; pregnant or planning on 
becoming pregnant; and having a medical or psychiatric condition that compromised safe 
study participation.

Participants were recruited using a number of strategies. The study was advertised through 
the local media, and staff advertised the study and recruited participants at community 
events. Staff also regularly met with the tribal substance use treatment agency, primary care 
providers, and other social service providers to discuss the study and request referrals to the 
study. Interested individuals contacted the study staff and were screened for eligibility. 
Eligible participants provided written informed consent and completed a study enrollment 
interview.

Randomization.—Participants were assigned to intervention groups following a 2 x 2 
factorial design, using a stratified block randomization procedure, balanced on 1) sex at 
birth, 2) baseline positive urine test for alcohol, and 3) baseline positive urine test for drugs. 
We stratified based on baseline urine test results, as positive urine tests at the initiation of 
treatment are a powerful predictor of treatment outcome (22, 28–30). A university-based

Capture) (31).

Interventions

Reinforcement Procedures.—When eligible for reinforcement, each individual drew 
one chip from a bag containing 500 chips. Fifty percent of the chips said, “Good job” or a 
similar encouraging phrase in English or a Native language used in this community (no 
prize), 41.8% of the chips said “Small” and resulted in a prize worth $1, 8% said “Large” 
and resulted in a prize worth $20, and 0.2% said “Jumbo” and result in a prize worth $80. 
Chips were exchanged for prizes immediately after drawing. Prizes included toiletries, 
beading supplies, jewelry, gift cards to a local grocery store, clothing, fishing tackle, DVD 
players, and tablets. Participants drew for prizes based on the criteria for reinforcement 
described below. To assure fidelity, interventionists received in person training in the prize 
draw and CM protocol from experienced research coordinators, utilized checklists for 
tracking prizes, used electronic prize draw calculators to assure the correct number of prize 
draws were provided, and entered prize draw data into our study database. These data were 
checked weekly by a project manager. The Principal Investigator, project manager, and site 
team meet weekly to review fidelity via video conference.

Cultural adaptions included providing prizes that supported families, such as grocery store 
gift cards, diapers, fishing poles and camping gear. A.F., who is an elder and cultural expert, 
used the prize draw procedure as an opportunity to present information about relevant AI 
cultural concepts and teachings, such as teaching participants relevant words in their Native 
language and stories or teachings that were encouraging of recovery. This information was 
shared consistently across all groups.

Contingency Management Conditions.—Participants randomized into the 3 CM 
conditions received escalating reinforcement for alcohol or drug abstinent urine samples 
based on their condition. Participants in the CM for Alcohol group received prizes when 
their urine sample indicated no alcohol use. Participants in the CM for Drugs group received 
prizes when their urine sample was negative for their most used drug (as defined below). 
Those randomized to the CM for Alcohol and Drugs condition received prizes when their 
urine sample demonstrated abstinence from both alcohol and their most used drug.

Reinforcement Schedule.—When urine sample results met criteria for reinforcement, 
participants were allowed to draw at least three times for prizes. Participants received one 
additional prize draw for every three consecutive urine samples submitted that met criteria 
for reinforcement. Therefore, an individual who was continuously abstinent across the 12-
week intervention period would receive 12 draws at each of the three, week 12 visits (36 
prize draws in the last week). Positive or missing urine tests resulted in no prize draws for 
that visit, and a reset to three prize draws the next time an abstinent sample was provided. 
After three consecutive abstinent tests following a missing or positive test, participants were 
returned to the highest number of draws earned before the reset. The value of reinforcers 
available to participants who remained continuously abstinent was $667, though the mean 
value of reinforcers provided for CM participants was $155.22 (SD = $324.64).

Criteria for Reinforcement for Alcohol and Drug Abstinence.—Alcohol abstinence 
was defined as ethyl glucuronide (EtG) < 150 ng/mL and analyzed using the ThermoFisher 
EtG immunoassay on an Indiko benchtop analyzer (22, 26). At study entry a most used drug 
was identified. The most used drug was defined as the drug used most by the individual 
during the 30 days prior to enrollment per self-report. Urine drug test results for this drug 
were then used to determine if reinforcers would be provided for drug abstinence in the CM 
for Drugs and CM for Alcohol and Drugs groups. At each study visit, drug abstinence was 
tested using QuickScreen urine cups (Confirm Biosciences, San Diego, CA) or a 
ThermoFischer Indiko benchtop Analyzer (opioids). Potential most used drugs were 
amphetamine (d-amphetamine < 1,000ng/mL), methamphetamine (d-methamphetamine < 
1,000ng/mL), cocaine (benzoylecgonine < 300 ng/mL), cannabis (tetrahydrocannabinol < 
50ng/mL), and opioids (morphine < 299 ng/mL). With the exception of cannabis which 
could detect use for more than one week, the detection period of urine tests was two to three 
days (32).

Non-Contingent (NC) Control Condition.—Consistent with previous studies, 
participants in the NC control group received prize draws each time they submitted a urine 
sample. The number of prize draws was equal to the average number of prize draws earned 
by individuals in the CM conditions in the previous week, but never less than three prize 
draws per urine sample (21, 22, 26).

Treatment-as-usual.—Treatment-as-usual included outpatient addiction group and 
individual counseling that was provided by the tribal addiction agency, as well as services 
physical and mental health care offered through probation and primary care (e.g., Indian 
Health Service). These treatment resources were located across the street from our study 
office. Community members also had access to other social, cultural, and support services.

Measures

Outcomes—Our primary outcomes were alcohol (EtG) and most used drug abstinence as 
assessed by urine tests three times a week for 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included 
continuous EtG results, ranging from 0 to 2,000 ng/mL, and stimulant, opioid, and cannabis 
drug abstinence (33). We also analyzed attendance as a secondary outcome. Attendance was 
defined as submission of a urine sample at each of the 36 study visits.

Analytic Plan

Descriptive Statistics—For each primary and secondary biochemical outcome, we 
created binary indicators of abstinence at each urine test. We included time, and baseline 
values of the specific outcomes as pre-specified covariates across our estimated models.

Statistical Analyses—We performed an intention-to-treat analysis for outcomes 
comparing intervention groups. Primary outcomes were biochemically verified alcohol and 
drug abstinence measured longitudinally for 12 weeks. Consistent with previous CM studies, 
we used logistic generalized estimation equations (GEE) with the maximum likelihood 
estimation procedure to assess group differences in alcohol and drug use across the 12-week 
intervention (21, 34, 35). GEE are commonly used in analyzing repeated outcomes that are

nested within participants and provide a comprehensive assessment of group differences in 
use during treatment, as opposed to comparing groups at the end of treatment. GEE models 
utilize a type of listwise deletion for handling missing data (i.e., participants that have fewer 
than two observations are not included in the analysis). Our primary model compared 
alcohol and drug use in the three CM conditions to the control condition. Notably, while the 
design was a 2x2 factorial, we planned a priori to analyze our data using a collapsed 4-group 
variable for increased clarity, parsimony, and clinical utility (26). Secondarily, we compared 
the three CM groups to one another across outcomes as a set of planned comparisons using 
the Bonferroni correction procedure to protect against Type I error. Analyses controlled for 
time and baseline levels of the alcohol and drug outcome being analyzed.

Inferential results are presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
binary outcomes, and unstandardized regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals 
for continuous outcomes. We used a one-tailed alpha error rate of .05 as the threshold for 
statistical significance. We replicated GEE models using multiple imputation to handle the 
missing values in a sensitivity analysis, assuming data were missing at random, and in a 
manner consistent with previous CM studies and best practice handling of missing data in 
clinical trials (21, 22, 36–43). All analyses were performed using STATA version 14 
software.

Power—Sample size calculations were based on statistical power calculations for Aim 1 
(above). That is, that the three CM groups would be more likely than those in the control 
condition to submit urine sample that were consistent with alcohol and most used drug 
abstinence during the 12-week intervention period. Previous studies have demonstrated 
medium to large effect sizes (≥ 0.40 standard deviation units; OR=1.66) for CM procedures 
in reducing substance use compared to standard therapy (44, 45). Based on results of our 
previously completed CM trial for drug dependence, we anticipated at least an effect size of 
d=0.30 (corresponding to an OR=1.37) for the secondary analyses in this study. Assuming a 
within-participant correlation of r = 0.4 and a 2-tailed test with alpha set at 0.05, we 
expected at least 85% power to detect an effect size of 0.25 with n=120, our planned sample 
size. This is a conservative estimate, because we used longitudinal analysis techniques that 
made use of as many as 36 urine tests (3 urine test per week for 12 weeks) on each 
participant, substantially increasing our ability to detect smaller effects.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

One hundred and forty-two people were screened, 120 were consented, and 114 were 
randomized (Figure 1). The sample was 49.1% male, with an average age of 35.8 years (SD 
= 10.4 years), and 53.5% had a high school degree (See Table 1). At baseline, the most 
frequently used drugs included methamphetamine (50.9%), cannabis (36.8%), and 
prescription drugs (12.3%). Eight (7%) participants reported utilizing treatment-as-usual in 
the month prior to study enrollment.

Primary outcomes

Page 8

Group differences in percentage of alcohol and drug negative urine test results are displayed 
in Figure 2. All three CM groups were significantly more likely to submit alcohol abstinent 
urine samples compared to the control group (see Table 3). None of the three CM groups 
were significantly different from one another in terms of alcohol abstinence. The CM for 
Drugs and the CM for Alcohol and Drugs groups were significantly more likely to submit 
drug abstinent urine samples compared to the control group, as well as compared to the CM 
for Alcohol group, but were not significantly different from one another.

Results of multiple imputations analyses of EtG-assessed alcohol abstinence were consistent 
with our initial analyses, though most analyses resulted in smaller odds ratios, (see Table 3). 
The CM for Drugs and CM for Alcohol and Drugs groups were no longer significantly more 
likely to submit drug abstinent urine samples compared to the control group in multiple 
imputations analyses.

Secondary outcomes

Mean group differences in secondary outcomes are reported in Table 2. In GEE analyses, all 
three CM groups had significantly lower mean EtG levels, compared to the control group 
(see Table 3). The CM for Drugs group was significantly more likely to submit urine 
samples with lower mean EtG levels compared to the CM for Alcohol and Drugs group. 
Multiple imputation results remained similar for the outcome of alcohol EtG (see Table 3).

The three CM groups were significantly more likely to submit stimulant drug (i.e., cocaine, 
amphetamine and methamphetamine) abstinent urine samples over the intervention period 
compared to the control group. The CM for Drugs group was significantly more likely to 
submit stimulant abstinent urine samples when compared to the CM for Alcohol group. 
When investigating the effect of CM on stimulant use using multiple imputations, the CM 
for Alcohol group was no longer significantly more likely to submit drug abstinent urine 
samples compared to the control group; however, the CM for Drugs and CM for Alcohol and 
Drugs groups were significantly more likely to submit stimulant abstinent samples, relative 
to controls. Groups did not differ on cannabis abstinence assessed by urine tests (see Table 
3).

When investigating self-reported drug use, the three CM groups reported significantly less 
days of stimulant drug use compared to the control group. Those in the CM for Alcohol 
group also reported using cannabis an average of six more days compared to those in the 
control group. There were no other significant group differences in self-reported outcomes. 
When we investigated the effect of CM on self-reported alcohol and drug outcomes using 
multiple imputation, groups were not significantly different.

Each of the CM groups had significantly poorer attendance compared to the control group 
(see Table 2). Attendance was not significantly different across the three CM conditions.

This is the first study to demonstrate that CM is associated with increased alcohol abstinence 
in AI communities. Participants in the CM for Alcohol and CM for Alcohol and Drug 
groups were nearly three-fold more likely to be abstinent from alcohol compared to controls 
in multiple imputation analyses, a large effect that is equivalent to previous CM studies (22, 
34, 35). Participants who received CM for drug abstinence (alcohol abstinence was not 
targeted) were still more likely to submit EtG-negative alcohol tests, relative to controls. 
This finding replicates previous work demonstrating a clinically significant ancillary effect 
of CM on non-targeted alcohol and drugs (21, 22, 46).

Groups were not different in terms of most used drug abstinence when analyzed using 
multiple imputations. However, analyses of our secondary outcomes using multiple 
imputations indicated that participants in the CM for Drug and CM for Alcohol and Drugs 
groups were approximately four times more likely than the control group to submit stimulant 
drug-negative urine samples. This result is relevant to this community, where 51% of 
participants reported methamphetamine was their most used drug, and other AI people living 
on rural reservations, which are disproportionally affected by methamphetamine use. Low 
cost, effective, and culturally acceptable methamphetamine interventions are greatly needed 
in many rural AI communities. Previous studies indicate that CM is the most effective 
intervention for inducing methamphetamine abstinence, yet it is not widely implemented in 
clinical care (47).

Similar to studies in other populations where the control group received reinforcers for 
attendance (21), we found higher levels of attendance in the control group, compared to CM 
groups where attendance and abstinence were required. Therefore, reinforcers for attendance 
only are more likely to engage people with alcohol and drug problems than immediately 
requiring attendance and abstinence for reinforcement. Immediately requiring individuals to 
abstain from both alcohol and drugs had limited acceptability with participants, as 
attendance rates in this group were very low. Individuals might be more receptive to a 
sequenced approach that offers reinforcements for attendance first, followed by 
reinforcement for abstinence from one substance. This stepwise approach has been effective 
in other populations (48, 49).

Out study has some limitations. Our trial was conducted at a single site; thus results may not 
generalize to other AI communities. The use of a non-contingent control group resulted in 
lower levels of missing data in the control group, relative to the CM conditions. Though we 
used modern approaches to account for missing data, it is possible that differences in 
missing data across groups may have biased results. The requirement to submit urine 
samples three times a week for twelve weeks may have been a major barrier to participants 
residing in this rural community. To mitigate this barrier, we offered transportation to and 
from study appointments and located our study office in a centralized location near other 
substance use, medical, and social services. Despite these efforts, attrition was still high, 
particularly in the CM for alcohol and drugs group. A number of strategies might mitigate 
attrition, such as reducing the number of visits per week or utilization of other biomarkers 
that do not require in person attendance to monitor abstinence. Despite being adequately

powered to detect differences between each of the CM groups and the control condition, it 
may be that that we lacked the power to detect differences in outcomes when we compared 
CM groups to one another. While our site staff, including our lead interventionist who is an 
AI Elder (A.F.), integrated AI culture and language into our incentive intervention, a CM 
approach blended with culture as treatment (e.g., sweat lodges, AI ceremony) or AI cultural 
strengths (e.g., a family-based model) might increase retention and abstinence rates.

Despite these limitations, findings of this study demonstrate that incentives can be used to 
reinforce alcohol abstinence in a rural AI community, with large increases in alcohol 
abstinence during the intervention period. When investigating secondary outcomes, we also 
found that the CM for Drugs and CM for Alcohol and Drugs groups were more likely to 
submit a stimulant drug abstinent urine tests, relative to controls. This is an important 
finding given that methamphetamine use is a problem in many AI communities. In terms of 
selecting an approach to treat co-use of alcohol and drugs, our findings suggest that CM 
targeting drug abstinence might yield the best results, as those who received CM for drug 
abstinence were more likely to submit alcohol and stimulant-drug abstinent urine samples 
during the intervention period, relative to controls.

a The contingency management (CM) groups had significantly poorer attendance compared 
to the control group who received incentives for attendance only (p<.05). The two CM 
groups were significantly (p<.05) more likely to submit alcohol abstinent urine samples 
compared to the control condition (odds ratios ranging from 2.4 to 4.8). The CM for drug 
abstinence and CM for abstinence from both alcohol and drugs groups were significantly 
more likely than controls to submit urine samples consistent with abstinence from their most 
used drug (p<.05). Note: Timepoint 0 represents baseline. Weeks 1– 12 are intervention
