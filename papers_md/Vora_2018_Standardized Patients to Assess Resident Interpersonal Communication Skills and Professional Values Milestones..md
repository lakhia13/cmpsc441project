It has been a challenge to assess communication and professional values Milestones in emergency 
medicine (EM) residents using standardized methods, as mandated by the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). This paper outlines an innovative method of assessing these 
Milestones using an established instructional method. EM faculty mapped the communication and 
professional values Milestones to an existing communication and interpersonal skills scale. We identified 
six communication-focused scenarios: death notification; informed consent; medical non-compliance; 
medical error; treatment refusal; and advanced directives. In a pilot, 18 EM residents completed these six 
standardized patient (SP) encounters. Our experience suggests SP encounters can support standardized 
direct observation of residents’ achievement of ACGME Milestones. Further effort can be made to create 
a tailored, behaviorally-anchored tool that uses the Milestones as the conceptual framework. [West J

INTRODUCTION

Although effective communication with patients is an 

integral part of the role of all physicians and has gained 
the spotlight over the last decade, there is no established 
standard on how it should be taught and assessed during 
traditional medical training.1-6 The urgency to address this 
gap is evident, as the literature indicates that deficiencies in 
communication skills can lead to higher malpractice rates, 
patient dissatisfaction, and adverse patient outcomes.7-9 The 
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education 
(ACGME) endorsed “Interpersonal and Communication 
Skills” and “Professionalism” as two of the six core 
competencies. These competencies, and newly mandated 
ACGME Milestones, are challenging to assess in the clinical 
setting due to varying faculty frames of reference and the 
influence of factors external to resident performance.10 Faculty 
may use themselves, other doctors, or patient outcomes as 
frames of reference when assessing residents. In addition, 
faculty report that they often use “gut feeling” or “gestalt” to 
translate their observations to numerical assessment scores.10 

Standardized patient (SP) encounters with validated 
tools are an established method of assessing learners11 and 
may offer a more consistent way to assess residents. The 
literature supports a correlation between patient surveys and 
SP-based assessments of learners,12 as well as the use of SP 
feedback for training and assessment of residents.13-16 Using 
this established method can offer a more reliable assessment 
of these residency Milestones. This project aimed to pilot 
an innovative SP-based model to assess the interpersonal 
communication skills and professionalism Milestones of 
emergency medicine (EM) residents. 

METHODS

In 2005, the University of Illinois-College of Medicine 
at Chicago (UIC-COM) Clinical Performance Center (CPC) 
developed an institution-based competency tool to provide 
resident performance data to program directors (PD). The 
Communication and Interpersonal Skills Objective Structured 
Clinical Exam (CIS-OSCE) was administered and analyzed 
across specialties including internal medicine, family medicine,

surgery, pediatrics, neurology, and obstetrics-gynecology.17 Later, 
a many-faceted Rasch measurement model was used to further 
analyze each item on the scale and the results of this analysis 
were used to create an improved communication rating scale.18 
We used the new Revised Communication and Interpersonal 
Skills (RUCIS) scale, a four-category behaviorally anchored 
rating scale (Table).

Using a mapping method, four EM academic residency 

faculty integrated the Milestones into this existing RUCIS 
scale. Already being familiar with the Interpersonal and 
Communication Skills and Professionalism Milestones, the 
faculty members were given a chance to review the RUCIS 
Scale (with no modification to the anchors) and the details of the 
six communication tasks. They were then asked to individually 
map each of the behaviorally-anchored ratings on the RUCIS 
scale to a specific Milestone and level. Then the mapping was 
reviewed as a group and consensus was reached through iterative 
discussion until consensus was reached among all faculty (Table 
1). Eleven of the 13 RUCIS items were successfully mapped to 
specific levels of the two EM Milestones (Milestone 20 PROF1 

and Milestone 22 ICS1). In the 11 items, Levels 1 through 4 of 
both Milestones were represented, with Milestone 20 measured 
five times and Milestone 22 measured six times.  

In parallel to the Milestone mapping, the communication 
challenges were identified and developed. The six communication 
tasks were identified based on the previously developed patient-
centered communication competency assessment implemented 
in the CPC in 2003. The tasks were originally identified based 
on the communication literature and their salience to clinical 
practice. As noted by the authors, “they were designed to allow 
residents to demonstrate their skills across a range of patient ages, 
genders, and problems”.9 For our Milestone assessment initiative, 
the tasks used were the following: giving bad news; obtaining 
informed consent; patient education (addressing medication 
non-compliance); medical error; treatment refusal; and advanced 
directives. The cases for each of these tasks were either adapted 
to the EM setting from previous cases used by other specialties or 
were newly created and validated by EM faculty through iterative 
review. Each case was designed to present a communication 
task with an underlying communication challenge. For example,

Milestone: level

3. Listening to 
my story

( ) You rarely gave me any opportunity to tell my story and/or frequently interrupted me while I was 
talking, not allowing me to finish what I was saying. Sometimes I felt you were not paying attention 
(for example, you asked for information that I already provided).

( ) You let me tell my story without interruption, or only interrupted appropriately and respectfully. You 
seemed to pay attention to my story and responded to what I said appropriately.

( ) You allowed me to tell my story without inappropriate interruption, responded appropriately to 
what I said, and asked thoughtful questions to encourage me to tell more of my story.

( ) You were an exceptional listener. You encouraged me to tell my story and checked your 
understanding by restating important points.

4. Honest 
communication

( ) You did not seem truthful and frank. I felt that there might be something that you were trying to 
hide from me.

( ) You did not seem to hide any critical information from me.

( ) You explained the facts of the situation without trivializing negative information or possibilities 
(e.g., side effects, complications, failure rates).

( ) You were exceptionally frank and honest. You fully explained the positive and negative aspects of my 
condition. You openly acknowledged your own lack of knowledge or uncertainty, and things you would 
have to consult with others. When appropriate, you also suggested I seek a second opinion.

( ) Not applicable. There was no information for the clinician to provide.

5. Interest in 
me as a person

( ) You never showed interest in me as a person. You only focused on the disease or medical issue.

( ) In addition to talking about my medical issue, you spent some time getting to know me as a person.

( ) You spent some time exploring how my medical issue affects my personal or social life.

( ) You were exceptionally interested in me as a person. You not only explored how my medical 
problem affects my personal and social life, but also showed your willingness to help me address 
those challenges.

Standardized Patients to Assess Resident Interpersonal Communication Skills amd Professional Values  Vora et al. the communication task in the “giving bad news” case was for 
the resident to appropriately deliver a death notification and the 
communication challenge was for the resident to address the need 
for an autopsy of the deceased.

Each SP encounter was 10 minutes, with the SP completing 

the RUCIS scale immediately following the encounter. This 
was followed by 10 minutes for SP-to-resident debriefing. 
Professional actors were trained by an EM faculty member 
and an experienced SP trainer on each of the six cases. During 
the rigorous training, the actors reviewed and practiced the 
standardized scripting of each case and were tested on their 
accuracy and standardized portrayal of the patient. The SPs 
completed rater training for the RUCIS scale, which entailed 
discussing examples of each item and score with the trainers 
and watching video examples. The SPs were also trained in 
techniques of providing feedback to the residents according to the 
CPC protocol. A convenience subset of encounters were observed 
by an EM faculty member. At each session six residents rotated 
through the encounters and concluded the half day with an 
individual survey of their experience and a group debriefing.  

Piloting consisted of 18 residents representing all levels of 
EM residents or combined EM/Internal Medicine residents in the 
University of Illinois at Chicago Program (seven postgraduate 
year [PGY]-1 residents, six PGY-2, and five PGY-3). The six 
cases were new to all resident participants. Residents were 
assigned a simulation time slot during which they were excused 
from clinical duties. At the end of the academic year, the 
data were forwarded to the EM PD for use during the annual 
evaluation process for individual residents overseen by the 
Clinical Competency Committee (CCC) meeting. The scores 
were averaged across the six cases using the mapped Milestone 
level, and the resident’s level on Milestone 20 and Milestone 22 
were reported separately. 

This study was included under the Clinical Performance 

Center Institutional Review Board (or human subjects 
committee) approval. 

RESULTS

As this was intended as a pilot of an innovative Milestone 
assessment method, the sample size was small and collected data 
was limited. An individualized score report was provided to the 
CCC for each resident that included the Milestone score for each 
of the two Milestones. See Table 2 as an example. The score 
report was included for faculty to review as part of the resident’s 

file; but as this was a pilot, it was not incorporated in any specific 
numerical way into the resident’s overall Milestone score.

Additionally, in the individual survey 94% of residents 

agreed that verbal feedback from the SP was helpful and 
100% of residents felt the cases allowed them to demonstrate 
their communication and professionalism skills. In the faculty 
debriefing, residents uniformly agreed the SP encounter and 
feedback would improve the quality of care for future patients.

DISCUSSION

In this program, essential communication skills were 
assessed and EM residents received feedback from the SP as 
well as an EM faculty member in a simulated setting. This paper 
demonstrates the utilization of an established OSCE method for 
Milestone assessment that could provide useful, quantitative 
performance data to a residency CCC. Although the CCC did 
not use this pilot data in a structured way, there is potential for 
standardized incorporation of these scores in the future. Using a 
larger sample size, it would be important to look at the correlation 
of individual resident OSCE scores with other assessments in 
their file.19 Other possibilities would be to correlate resident 
scores to level of experience and comfort. Although in this pilot 
variability in resident scores across experience level was noted, 
the sample size was too small to report any statistically significant 
correlation data. Also, SPs were able to offer targeted feedback to 
individual learners and a difficult-to-obtain patient perspective. 
This method of assessment is reported in the literature,13,14 but 
further study is needed to assess resident communication skills 
Milestone improvement after SP debriefing.

In this pilot, a previously created tool was mapped to the 

Milestones. Since patient-centered care was the conceptual 
framework for the RUCIS scale and not the ACGME EM 
Milestones, it is necessarily limited in directly assessing 
ACGME EM Milestones. Further work is needed to create a 
new, targeted assessment tool that can be used in conjunction 
with the established OSCE methodology to specifically assess 
interpersonal communication and professional values Milestones. 
Using the Milestones as a conceptual framework, a behaviorally 
anchored tool could be created, similar to the CIS-OSCE, to 
assess specific behaviors as outlined by the ACGME Milestones. 
This type of tool could provide consistent, reliable, quantitative 
data to residency PDs and enhance the instruction and assessment 
of residents throughout their training with the ultimate goal of 
improving these skills in patient interactions.

(Average score across 6 cases based on Milestone levels 1-5)

LIMITATIONS

As this was a pilot study, there was an anticipated 
limitation in sufficient data collection to perform definitive 
quantitative analyses. Residents knew they were scheduled 
for communication OSCE encounters and may have focused 
on demonstrating strong communication. Thus, like many 
standardized assessments these can be best thought of as 
“maximal performance” assessments, which may not reflect

Vora et al. Standardized Patients to Assess Resident Interpersonal Communication Skills amd Professional Values learners’ typical performance or “worst-case” performance.20 
Also, as with many OSCEs, it is possible that residents who 
were scheduled earlier discussed some case content with later-
scheduled residents although the scores of later residents did not 
reflect this to be the case. 

Of note, when the Milestones were mapped to the RUCIS 

scale, level 5 of both Milestones was not represented in 
the current tool, although it is notable that residents are not 
expected to reach level 5 during residency training. This may 
speak to the need to develop specific assessment methods to 
measure higher level Milestones with OSCE assessments used 
for early level Milestones. In addition, the scores provided 
to the CCC reported a number as a continuous variable as 
opposed to an ordinal variable as required by the Milestone 
scale, which may have limited their usefulness. In the future, 
qualitative feedback from the PD or the CCC on the value of 
the mapped OSCE score could inform score report structure. 
This program was piloted at one institution, which would 
limit its generalizability. Due to these limitations, it would be 
worthwhile to explore creating a new assessment tool with the 
EM Milestones as the underlying conceptual framework. 

CONCLUSION

As competency-based medical education has come to the 

forefront, there is a need for reliable and valid methods of 
assessing communication and professionalism skills. This pilot 
supports the potential use of an established method to conduct 
a more rigorous assessment of interpersonal communication 
skills and professional values Milestones of EM residents. 
Future studies may also compare SP assessment to standard 
simulation assessment of these skills to further expand the 
Milestone assessment toolbox.
