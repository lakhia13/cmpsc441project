Autism (or autism spectrum disorder) was initially defined as a psychiatric disorder, with the likely cause maternal behavior (the
very destructive “refrigerator mother” theory). It took several decades for research into brain mechanisms to become established. Both
neuropathological and imaging studies found differences in the cerebellum in autism spectrum disorder, the most widely documented
being a decreased density of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex. The popular interpretation of these results is that cerebellar
neuropathology is a critical cause of autism spectrum disorder. We challenge that view by arguing that if fewer Purkinje cells are critical
for autism spectrum disorder, then any condition that causes the loss of Purkinje cells should also cause autism spectrum disorder.
We will review data on damage to the cerebellum from cerebellar lesions, tumors, and several syndromes (Joubert syndrome, Fragile X,
and tuberous sclerosis). Collectively, these studies raise the question of whether the cerebellum really has a role in autism spectrum
disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is now recognized as a genetically caused developmental disorder. A better understanding of the
genes that underlie the differences in brain development that result in autism spectrum disorder is likely to show that these genes
affect the development of the cerebellum in parallel with the development of the structures that do underlie autism spectrum disorder.

Key words: Purkinje cells; Joubert syndrome; tuberous sclerosis; Fragile X syndrome.

What is autism?

“Early infantile autism” was described in a series of papers by Leo
Kanner and collaborators (Kanner 1943, 1946, 1949, 1951, 1954,
1958, 1965, 1968, 1973, 1994; Kanner and Eisenberg 1957; Kanner
and Lesser 1958). It was characterized as a psychiatric disorder,
also called “infantile psychosis” and not as a neurological disorder.
Kanner (1954) suggested parental behavior as the cause in the
patients he saw, and for many years its cause was considered
from a psychoanalytic perspective (e.g. the “Refrigerator Mother”
http://www.autism-help.org/points-refrigerator-mothers.htm;
https://www.verywellhealth.com/why-refrigerator-mothers-were
-blamed-for-autism-260135). Bruno Bettelheim was a major force
behind that perspective (review of the history in Baker 2010).

In fact, the classification of autism as a psychiatric illness
remains until the present. The critical diagnostic tool for autism
is the DSM, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses
published by the American Psychiatric Association (Association
1980; American Psychiatric Association and American Psychi-
atric Association. Work Group to Revise DSM-III 1987; American
Psychiatric Association and American Psychiatric Association.
DSM-5 Task Force 2013). Autism was first recognized as an entity
apart from childhood psychosis or childhood schizophrenia in
1980 (in the DSM-III), with the criteria for autism modified in
subsequent DSM revisions. It was described as a “spectrum dis-
order” in the DSM-IV, 1994, but did not then include related
syndromes like Asperger’s Disorder (Asperger 1991), and Rett
syndrome in which patients can show “autistic features” (Percy
2011; Neul 2012). In the DSM-5, 2013, these separate categories
were abolished and the term “autism spectrum disorder, ASD” was
introduced to include those disorders.

ASD is behaviorally defined. The idea that its cause might be
structural differences in the brain rather than parental behavior
was first suggested by Williams et al. (1980). They noted abnormal
EEG findings and seizures as indicating that there must be “the
presence of an underlying neurologic disorder that is as yet unde-
fined.” The possibilities of brain abnormalities have since been
extensively investigated by either direct (histological studies of
postmortem brains) or indirect (structural imaging) studies. Many
studies have found pathology of the cerebellum, and the idea that
the cerebellum has a critical role in ASD now has wide support
(Bauman and Kemper 1985; Ritvo et al. 1986; Fatemi et al. 2002,
2012; Kern 2003; Allen 2005; Becker and Stoodley 2013; Rogers
et al. 2013; Skefos et al. 2014; D’Mello and Stoodley 2015; Hampson
and Blatt 2015; Soghomonian et al. 2017; Sydnor and Aldinger
2022).

We will here propose a different perspective: while the struc-
ture of the cerebellum may be affected in some cases of ASD,
several lines of evidence suggest that this neuropathology is
not the cause of ASD. We will first summarize the studies that
implicate the cerebellum in ASD, and then consider data that
challenge the interpretation of those findings.

The cerebellum in ASD: neuropathology
and imaging studies

Neuropathology studies are limited by the relatively small num-
ber of brains available for study. This problem is compounded by
the variability in the ASD population. The diagnosis of autism
or ASD can include subgroups of patients that may have other
neurological abnormalities. There is a wide range of IQs in the
ASD population; many also have an intellectual disability (ID; this

term has replaced “mental retardation;” the term “developmental
disability” has also been used; Lockyer and Rutter 1969; Williams
et al. 1980; Kemper and Bauman 1993; Courchesne et al. 1994;
Mitchell et al. 2022). While the underlying neurological substrate
for ID is not understood, it clearly is an indicator of atypical brain
development and function. Another complication is that many
ASD subjects also have epilepsy (Rutter and Lockyer 1967), often
associated with its own neuropathology and the use of antiepilep-
tic drugs that may affect the brain (Kokenge et al. 1965). Finally,
there are at least 25 different genetic syndromes (including Down
syndrome [DS], tuberous sclerosis [TS], Fragile X syndrome [FXS],
and Joubert syndrome [JS]) in which the behavioral profiles of
some patients support an ASD diagnosis, but these patients may
have other associated neuropathology (like multiple tubers in the
brain for TS, Asano et al. 2001) absent in subjects with “idiopathic”
(nonsyndromic) ASD. In assessing a role for the cerebellum it is
therefore important to ask if the cerebellum is implicated only in
a particular subset of ASD patients, defined either by coexisting
medical conditions or by the nature and severity of symptoms, or
if structural differences in the cerebellum are seen in everyone
with an ASD diagnosis. The locus of cerebellar deficits is also
crucial. While the same cell types in the same synaptic relations
to each other are present throughout cerebellar cortex, inputs,
outputs, and functions vary in different parts of the cerebellum
(Eccles et al. 1967). Are the same cerebellar abnormalities seen in
all ASD brains, or at least in brains of individuals with the same
constellation of symptoms?

Neuropathology and the cerebellum

Figure 1 illustrates the aspects of the anatomy of the cerebellum
in several species. There are 3 major anatomical features of the
cerebellum (Voogd and Glickstein 1998). The cerebellar cortex is
made up of several cell types arranged in layers. Beneath the
cortex is the cerebellar white matter (wm), and within the wm
are the cerebellar deep nuclei. The complexity of the cerebellum
varies among species (examples in Fig. 2 of Voogd and Glickstein
1998), but the cell types and laminar organization of cerebellar
cortex are similar among many mammals. Figure 1A shows a
superior and Fig. 1B a posterior view of a human cerebellum (for
other views see Angevine 1961). Note the many folds or folia in
the cerebellar cortex (Fig. 1A, example at arrow). Figure 1C shows
the molecular (ml), granule (gr), and Purkinje cell (arrows) layers
of cerebellar cortex on a Nissl-stained section of cerebellar cortex.
Figure 1D shows a section through human cerebellar cortex that
was immunostained for the calcium-binding protein calbindin.
The Purkinje cells and their dendritic trees are visualized by the
immunostaining (example at arrow), as are immunostained fibers
in cerebellar wm (arrowhead). Figure 1E shows a Nissl-stained and
Fig. 1F a calbindin immunostained cross section through cerebel-
lar cortex of a chimpanzee. The appearance of cerebellar cortex is
very similar to the human. The Purkinje cell layer is clearly seen
on the calbindin-immunoreactive section in f (example at arrow).
Figure 1G, J, and I shows Nissl-stained cross sections through the
cerebellar cortex of monkey (g), cat (h), and rat (i). Again, the gen-
eral appearance of the cerebellar cortex is similar in all species.

The most consistent finding of neuropathology studies has
been decreases in the numbers of Purkinje cells in ASD brains
compared with controls (e.g. Figure 1D and F, arrows). However,
different studies differ in whether this loss affects entire cerebel-
lum or only certain regions, and in the relative numbers of ASD
subjects affected. Williams et al. (1980) examined the brains of
4 patients and noted a reduction of Purkinje cells “generally in

the cerebellum” in one of them, patient 3. They did not, however,
regard that as a significant finding, summarizing their results
as “The apparent absence of neuropathologic findings in these
cases.” The next report of Purkinje cell loss was from Bauman and
Kemper (1985) who studied the brain of a single patient who was
disabled enough to require institutional care. They compared that
brain to a similar age-control brain. They found selective atrophy
of cerebellar cortex in lateral and inferior hemispheres with loss
of Purkinje cells in several lobules; the anterior lobe and vermis
were intact. There was also a loss of cells in the deep nuclei but
not in the inferior olive (IO); however, its cells were pale and small.
Several subsequent reports confirmed the finding of a decrease
in Purkinje cells. Ritvo et al. (1986) reported “significantly lower”
numbers of Purkinje cells in 4 ASD subjects. Arin et al. (1991)
in a brief report noted “diffuse” Purkinje cell loss in the entire
cerebellum in 4 cases but with the most profound loss, 50% to 95%,
in the paraf locculus and f locculus rather than the hemispheres.
Kemper and Bauman (1993) found a decrease of Purkinje cells
in 6 brains, most marked in posterolateral neocerebellum. Look-
ing beyond idiopathic ASD, Bauman et al. (1995) found reduced
numbers of Purkinje cells throughout the hemispheres of 3 cases
of Rett syndrome, and Bauman (1996) found decreased Purkinje
cells in the cerebellar hemispheres in Asperger’s syndrome and
Rett syndrome (at that time both independent diagnoses). Bailey
et al. (1998) found a reduced density of Purkinje cells in 5 out of 6
ASD cases. Whitney et al. (2008a) used immunohistochemistry for
calbindin (a protein expressed in Purkinje cells) and stereological
methods and found a reduced density of Purkinje cells in three-
sixth autistic brains. Skefos et al. (2014), also using stereology,
analyzed PC densities in 4 cerebellar regions, Crus I and II, lobule
X, and the hemispheric portion of lobules IV and VI in 8 cases.
They found autism cases had a lower overall Purkinje cell density
of about 11%. Wegiel et al. (2014) studied 14 ASD subjects, 8 with
ID, and found an average 25% decrease in Purkinje cells in the
cerebellar hemispheres compared with controls. (Regional and
case differences were not described.) Fatemi et al. (2002) found
that Purkinje cells in two-fifth autistic brains were smaller in area
(by 50%) than in control brains; but there were no differences in
Purkinje cell density. How do the findings of decreased numbers
of Purkinje cells align with the results of imaging studies?

Imaging studies of the cerebellum in ASD

While imaging studies allow the study of more subjects than
are available for post mortem brain analysis, they are limited
to measuring the relative sizes of different brain regions and
cannot identify differences at a cellular level. A decreased density
of Purkinje cells in the ASD brain might predict a decreased
cerebellar volume. However, a decreased cerebellar volume has
not been found. Brambilla et al. (2003) did a very detailed review
of MRI studies of autism from 1966 to 2003. Early studies found
a decrease in size of one or more lobules of the vermis rela-
tive to controls (Courchesne et al. 1988; Murakami et al. 1989;
Hashimoto et al. 1995). However, many subsequent studies found
no differences in the size of the vermis between ASD subjects
and controls (Nowell et al. 1990; Garber and Ritvo 1992; Holttum
et al. 1992; Kleiman et al. 1992; Piven et al. 1992, 1997; Hashimoto
et al. 1993; Ciesielski et al. 1997; Levitt et al. 1999; Manes et al.
1999; Elia et al. 2000; Brambilla et al. 2003, Table 1). The data
on overall cerebellar volume were also contradictory: Abell et al.
(1999) found the overall cerebellar volume was enlarged in ASD,
whereas Sparks et al. (2002) did not and Gaffney et al. (1987) found
that cerebella were smaller in autistic patients. In later studies
(after that review), Kaufmann et al. (2003) found that in ASD

vermal lobules VI and VII were smaller than in controls. Scott et al.
(2009) found that the MRI showed total vermis volume decreased
in autism; Sussman et al. (2015) found the volume of Crus 1 larger
than in the controls. Imaging studies thus do not show a clear
and consistent picture of cerebellar size differences between ASD
brains and controls.

Functional implications of cerebellar
abnormalities in ASD

There have been 2 major ideas about how the documented
cerebellar pathology might cause the symptoms of ASD. The
first hypothesis is that it is important for the motor deficits that
are often reported in ASD patients (Ritvo et al. 1986; Rosenhall
et al. 1988; Miyahara et al. 1997; Green et al. 2002; Takarae et al.
2004b; Becker and Stoodley 2013; Zalla et al. 2018; Bhat 2021;
Sydnor and Aldinger 2022). This perspective is in line with the

the cerebellum in coordination of
long-established role of
movement
(Stewart and Holmes 1904; Holmes 1917). The
implication of this view is that cerebellar deficits would be seen
only in the subset of ASD patients with motor symptoms.

Another interpretation is that abnormalities of the cerebel-
lum could also underlie the “core” features of ASD, social, and
communication deficits (Levisohn et al. 2000; Schmahmann 2004;
Becker and Stoodley 2013; Schmahmann et al. 2019; Bylemans
et al. 2023). A role for cerebellum in cognitive, affective, and
language functions was first suggested by studies of connections
of the cerebellum (Middleton and Strick 1997, 1998, 2000; Dum
et al. 2002; Kelly and Strick 2003), and supported by studies
of cerebellar lesions and functional imaging (Schmahmann and
Sherman 1998; Levisohn et al. 2000; Stoodley and Schmahmann
2009; Schmahmann et al. 2019). According to this view, cerebellar
deficits cause the defining symptoms of ASD and therefore should
be seen in every patient with an ASD diagnosis.

Purkinje cell loss: causation or correlation?

We propose a different interpretation of the neuropathological
and imaging data: while there may be differences in the cere-
bellum in some cases of ASD, the best-documented being the
decrease of Purkinje cells, there are strong arguments that this
cerebellar pathology does not cause the symptoms of ASD. One
way of evaluating the data is to ask if loss of Purkinje cells from
postnatal events like lesions or tumors or prenatal events as
in developmental disorders affecting the cerebellum also might
cause ASD. We will review data on damage to, and developmental
disorders of, the cerebellum that argue against a critical role
in ASD.

Purkinje cells and plasticity
How would Purkinje cell loss affect the circuitry and functions
of the cerebellum? Purkinje cells receive afferent inputs from
climbing fibers that arise from neurons in the IO (Desclin 1974);
each climbing fiber can innervate multiple Purkinje cells but, in
the adult, each Purkinje cell receives input from only one climbing
fiber. What happens to this circuitry if there are fewer Purkinje
cells than normal? One idea would be a parallel reduction in the
numbers of neurons in the IO, but that is not a consistent finding
(Bauman and Kemper 2005). Purkinje cells project to neurons in
the deep cerebellar nuclei? Might there also be fewer neurons in
the cerebellar deep nuclei, the targets of Purkinje cell projections?
Again, the data are inconsistent among studies. In some reports,
the reduction in Purkinje cells is only around 11% (Skefos et al.
2014); is this functionally significant? It is possible that there
are mechanisms of plasticity resulting in subtle alterations in
the circuitry that would allow essentially normal function. There
is developmental plasticity in the cerebellar circuitry: initially,
multiple climbing fibers innervate a single Purkinje cell but in
the adult it is only one (Bosman and Konnerth 2009). Plasticity
in the somatotopic maps in cerebral cortex in response to periph-
eral denervation is well-established (Kaas et al. 1983; Merzenich
et al. 1983a, 1983b; Wall et al. 1986). In those studies, the map
reorganizes to allow an expanded representation of adjacent body
parts. A cerebellar equivalent might entail subtle reprogramming
of movements to allow use of the muscles inf luenced by the
intact Purkinje cells. Such plasticity could result in an absence of
obvious movement deficits even with fewer than normal numbers
of Purkinje cells.

Cerebellar lesions in adults
Postnatal cerebellar damage will also cause loss of Purkinje cells,
might those patients also show ASD symptoms? That is cer-
tainly true for other neurological disorders; a good example is
Parkinson’s disease (PD) where loss of cells in the substantia nigra
results in the symptoms of PD regardless of how those cells are
lost (Langston et al. 1984; Parent and Parent 2010).

The classical symptoms of cerebellar lesions in adults are
weakness, hypotonia, and ataxia (Stewart and Holmes 1904;
Holmes 1917). These are very different from the relatively
subtle motor deficits most commonly described for ASD:
“clumsiness,” stereotyped behaviors, difficulty in learning some
motor tasks, and abnormalities in postural control, gait, and eye
movements (Berkson and Davenport 1962; Rosenhall et al. 1988;
Ghaziuddin and Butler 1998; Takarae et al. 2004a; MacDonald
et al. 2012; Eggleston et al. 2017; Lim et al. 2018; Bojanek et al.
2020).

Cerebellar tumors, cerebellar mutism, and ASD
Another set of patients with damage to the cerebellum are chil-
dren who have undergone surgical removal of posterior fossa
tumors. Some of those patients then experience a syndrome
called cerebellar mutism, after a delay of about 1 to 12 days, there
is a complete absence of speech in children who were previously
verbal. Cerebellar mutism occurs in a minority (10% to 30%) of
surgical cases, is of limited duration (1 to 3 mo), and there is
spontaneous recovery usually with residual dysarthria (Pitsika
and Tsitouras 2013; Tamburrini et al. 2015; Gora et al. 2017).

There may be deficits in cognitive function in tumor resection
patients who do not have mutism; Levisohn et al. (2000) analyzed
neuropsychological and motor function in 19 children who had
undergone surgery for removal of cerebellar tumors. Most (14) had
deficits in fine motor control, 6 had deficits in “affect regulation,”
and 7 had expressive language deficits but none met the criteria
for ASD.

The phenomena of cerebellar mutism and other speech deficits
in patients with cerebellar tumors (Ackermann et al. 1992) sup-
port a role for the cerebellum in expressive language. However,
the recovery of speech makes cerebellar mutism dissimilar to
the permanent language deficits seen in ASD children (Kanner
1946).

Abnormal development of the cerebellum: JS
Joubert et al. (1969) described a single child with agenesis of the
vermis, ataxia, and mental retardation. Since that initial report,
more children with JS have been described, most with cognitive
impairment (described as “developmental delay,” mental retar-
dation, or ID); many also have impaired vision and control of
eye movements as well as respiratory and renal problems (e.g.
Boltshauser and Isler 1977; Friede and Boltshauser 1978; Lambert
et al. 1989; Kendall et al. 1990; Spahiu et al. 2022; Fang et al. 2023).
JS can result from mutations in several different genes (Ferland
et al. 2004; Louie and Gleeson 2005), with resulting variability in
symptoms. Two reports linked JS with autism. Holroyd et al. (1991)
evaluated 2 children: one met the DSM-III criteria for autism
and the second had “autistic features.” That report was taken as
evidence for the importance of the vermis in ASD. Support for
that point of view came from a study of 11 children (Ozonoff
et al. 1999), in which 3 met the criteria for autism and 1 for
pervasive developmental disorder (DSM-IV criteria), and 7 others
had one autistic symptom. However, ASD in JS is not a consistent
finding. Takahashi et al. (2005) reported that none of a sample of
32 children with JS met the Autism Behavior Checklist criteria for
autism. In a study of 36 adults with JS, only one met the diagnosis
of ASD (Romaniello et al. 2022). Hickey et al. (2018) evaluated
3 adult brothers with JS and described global developmental
delay and functional deficits fitting “cerebellar cognitive affective
syndrome” but not ASD. Uda et al. (2023) described 2 siblings both
with ID, but neither was described as autistic. Overall, the data
from many studies of JS do not support the idea that ASD always
accompanies this syndrome nor do they support a critical role for
the vermis in ASD.

Tuberous sclerosis
TS is a genetic disorder with widespread effects on the brain,
including the cerebellum. A major brain abnormality is the forma-
tion of tumors called tubers (Asano et al. 2001). These are found
in skin, heart, lungs, and kidneys as well as in brain (Henske et al.
2016). There is a lot of variability among patients in the locus and

98 | Cerebral Cortex, 2024, Vol. 34, No. 13

extent of the tubers (Asano et al. 2001; Ertan et al. 2010) as well
as a lot of variability in the severity of functional impairment in
TS (additional references in Scherrer et al. 2020). About 30% to
50% of TS patients meet the criteria for ASD (Smalley et al. 1991;
Scherrer et al. 2020; Capal et al. 2021; Mitchell et al. 2022). Is it
then possible to correlate the locus of tubers with the occurrence
of ASD? Several studies have argued that the critical structure is
the cerebellum; cerebellar tubers are rather rare in TS (Jurkiewicz
et al. 2006). Eluvathingal et al. (2006) found cerebellar lesions
in 21/78 TS patients and that the number of these correlated
with measures of “autistic symptomatology.” Weber et al. (2000)
also found that the number of cerebellar tumors (in 29 patients)
correlated with the score on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale.
One problem in interpreting these studies is the different distri-
butions of cerebellar tubers in different cases; it is also necessary
to describe the numbers and locations of cerebellar tumors in
TS patients who do not meet the criteria for ASD. Furthermore,
a number of studies have implicated other brain regions, e.g. the
fusiform gyrus and limbic and paralimbic regions (Scherrer et al.
2020), the prefrontal cortex (Dedeoglu et al. 2023), and patterns
of connectivity (Prohl et al. 2019), and decreased wm in cortico-
cortical tracts (Vanes et al. 2022). Again, the data from TS do not
clearly support a role for the cerebellum in ASD.

Fragile X syndrome
Fragile X is a syndrome that results from mutations in the FMR1
gene. It causes ID, and roughly 30% of FXS patients meet the
criteria for ASD (Turk and Graham 1997; Greco et al. 2011). There is
evidence that the cerebellum may be affected in FXS. Sabaratnam
(2000) studied the brains of 2 men, one of whom met ASD criteria,
and found loss of Purkinje cells in that case. Kaufmann et al.
(2003), using imaging, found a smaller volume of vermal lobules
V to X in 9 boys with FXS who did not meet criteria for ASD.
Greco et al. (2011) reported about a 40% loss of Purkinje cells in
the vermis in the brains of 3 FXS patients (only one of whom had
ASD). These studies support the idea that the development of the
cerebellum may be affected in FXS but do not support the idea
that it is the cerebellar deficits that cause ASD.

A case of cerebellar agenesis
If relatively minor defects in the cerebellum, e.g. an 11% loss of
Purkinje cells, can underlie autism then one would predict that
autism would be inevitable in the total absence of the cerebellum.
That, however, does not seem to be the case. Yu et al. (2015)
described a woman with cerebellar agenesis who had mild MR and
classical cerebellar motor symptoms: cerebellar ataxia and dys-
metria, but normal word comprehension and expression. Again,
this case suggests that the link between the cerebellum and ASD
is not compelling.

Indirect effects of cerebellar damage on cerebral cortex

Another theory of the role of the cerebellum in ASD is “cerebel-
lar diaschisis.” The idea of “diaschisis” was first introduced to
describe a decrease in activity in some brain region in response
to removal of its neuronal input (discussion in Reivich 1992). The
term “crossed cerebellar diaschisis” was then used to describe
measurable metabolic changes (oxygen consumption and glu-
cose utilization) in the cerebella of adult patients contralateral
to a supratentorial lesion (review in Pantano et al. 1986). The
term has been used in a very different way in the context of
ASD. The hypothesis is that the cerebellar defects are primary
and that the development and function of the cortex are then
affected secondarily (Limperopoulos et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014;
D’Mello and Stoodley 2015; Stoodley and Limperopoulos 2016).

One specific idea is that cerebellar neuropathology affects the
development of cortical language areas (D’Mello and Stoodley
2015). Evaluating this hypothesis would require knowledge of the
timing of the cerebellar deficits relative to the development of
cortex; at present, it is not known when in development the
cerebellar abnormalities occur. This hypothesis would also predict
structural/functional differences in language areas of the cortex,
which could be examined in postmortem brains in subjects whose
language abilities have been documented.

Despite the widespread acceptance of an important role for
the cerebellum in ASD, there are data from multiple sources that
argue against it. The results of neuropathological and imaging
studies are inconsistent and often contradictory about which
part of the cerebellum is involved and how. Many patients with
cerebellar damage or abnormal cerebellar development (e.g. JS,
TS, FXS, cerebellar mutism, and cerebellar lesions) do not show
characteristics of ASD.

Other brain regions in ASD

Neuropathological studies have found abnormalities in other
brain regions in ASD, including the cerebral cortex, the amygdala,
and the limbic system (starting with the early observations of
Bauman and Kemper 1985; Kemper and Bauman 1993, 1998).
How compelling is the evidence for the role of these regions in
causing ASD?

One series of studies focused on the organization of cortical
minicolumns, with a basic finding of narrower minicolumns in
some cortical regions of ASD brains including prefrontal cortex
but not primary visual cortex (Casanova et al. 2002a, 2002b,
2006a, 2006b; Buxhoeveden et al. 2006). However, in another study
(McKavanagh et al. 2015), the opposite result was found: cortical
minicolumns in ASD subjects were wider, not narrower and this
difference was found in primary auditory cortex as well as in
higher order cortical areas. The contradictions among studies
suggest the need for analysis of more brains.

Another region of interest for ASD has been the amygdala
(reviews in Sweeten et al. 2002; Amaral et al. 2003). Abnormal
development of the amygdala was proposed as the substrate for
the deficits in social behavior in ASD (Baron-Cohen et al. 2000).
However, lesion experiments in nonhuman primates instead sug-
gested the amygdala as important for fear responses not social
behavior (Amaral et al. 2003). Again, the assumption behind such
studies is that lesions of a structure should mimic the effects
of abnormal development of that structure (a similar approach
was taken for the limbic system by Bachevalier 1994). This idea is
probably oversimplified as there may be mechanisms of plasticity
in prenatal development that would not be seen in postnatal
lesion studies. Furthermore, several neuropathological and imag-
ing studies did not find differences in the amygdala (review and
references in Sweeten et al. 2002). Thus the importance of the
amygdala in ASD is not established.

Other approaches: connections
Another approach to understanding the neural differences under-
lying ASD has been to use imaging techniques, especially dif-
fusion tensor imaging, to look at connections among structures
(Schuetze et al. 2016; Tomasi and Volkow 2019). These stud-
ies relay on averaging data from many cases and have not so
far established a definitive pathway or structure clearly linked
to ASD.

Perspective and future directions

While it is clear from many studies that there are abnormalities in
ASD brains, no one structure has been established as crucial; the

neuroanatomical basis for ASD remains as mysterious as it was
in 2008 (Amaral et al. 2008). What directions for future research
look promising?

One overall concern is the selection of subject populations,
both for neuropathology and for imaging studies. The present
definition of ASD as a “spectrum disorder” means that people
with very different abilities may be included in an ASD diagnosis.
The brain, and genetics, of someone with only impaired social
skills are likely to be very different from the brain of someone
with ID/DD, no expressive language, seizures, and self-injurious
behaviors, even if both people have the ASD diagnosis. Studies
of people with similar profiles may be the most useful; a recent
example is the finding of subtle anatomical differences in Broca’s
area in a carefully selected ASD population (Brun et al. 2016).

(There are also social consequences of the “spectrum” diagno-
sis; advocates would argue that people with “severe autism” are
not getting the supports that they need https://www.ncsautism.
org/).

Another direction may be analyses of the brain at a more ml
level. Many of the neuroanatomical studies so far have looked for
neuropathology at a structural level, observable on Nissl- or Golgi-
stained sections, e.g. the structure of the cortical minicolumns,
the decreases in Purkinje cell numbers. It might be profitable
to explore more subtle differences in cell function/neurochem-
istry, for example, in the numbers of cells synthesizing particular
transmitters, the density of receptors for particular transmitters
or balance among different receptor subtypes, or the density of
transporters for these receptors. Only a few such studies have
been done, and in in limited brain regions (Oblak et al. 2009, 2013;
Muller et al. 2016).

Another promising line for research for understanding the
brain differences underlying ASD are genetic studies. The idea
of a genetic basis for ASD was dismissed by Kanner (1954) who
thought the cause was parental behavior. (Rereading his report
allows an alternative interpretation of the parents he describes:
that they were indeed themselves “on the spectrum.”) Family
and twin studies argued for a genetic role in autism (Folstein
and Rutter 1977; summary in Bespalova and Buxbaum 2003).
The idea of a genetic/developmental basis is now accepted (e.g.
Sandin et al. 2014). The genetics are not as simple as for TS, DS,
or FXS; there are many, many genes that affect the risk of ASD
(Bespalova and Buxbaum 2003; Martin et al. 2007; Betancur 2011;
Geschwind 2011; Cotney et al. 2015; Kawamura et al. 2021; Fu et al.
2022; Scala et al. 2022). There appears to be an overlap between
risk genes for ASD and for schizophrenia (Tromp et al. 2021; Fu
et al. 2022), a modern echo of the old view of early childhood
autism as related to childhood schizophrenia. The broadness of
the “spectrum” as currently defined complicates both the selec-
tion of subjects and the understanding of the results. A more
complete understanding of the genes underlying brain devel-
opment in ASD should eventually identify all of the disrupted
developmental processes and allow understanding of which brain
regions are critical for ASD. Again, it seems essential that this
enterprise recognizes that there are very different subpopulations
of people with ASD, all presently considered part of the “spec-
trum.” Functionally, very different subgroups are likely to have
different genes affecting different subsets of brain regions and
circuits.
