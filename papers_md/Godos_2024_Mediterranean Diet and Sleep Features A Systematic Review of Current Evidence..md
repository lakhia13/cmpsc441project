Abstract: The prevalence of sleep disorders, characterized by issues with quality, timing, and sleep
duration is increasing globally. Among modifiable risk factors, diet quality has been suggested to
influence sleep features. The Mediterranean diet is considered a landmark dietary pattern in terms of
quality and effects on human health. However, dietary habits characterized by this cultural heritage
should also be considered in the context of overall lifestyle behaviors, including sleep habits. This
study aimed to systematically revise the literature relating to adherence to the Mediterranean diet
and sleep features in observational studies. The systematic review comprised 23 reports describing
the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and different sleep features, including sleep
quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and insomnia symptoms. The majority of the included
studies were conducted in the Mediterranean basin and reported a significant association between
a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a lower likelihood of having poor sleep quality,
inadequate sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness or symptoms of insomnia. Interestingly,
additional studies conducted outside the Mediterranean basin showed a relationship between the
adoption of a Mediterranean-type diet and sleep quality, suggesting that biological mechanisms
sustaining such an association may exist. In conclusion, current evidence suggests a relationship
between adhering to the Mediterranean diet and overall sleep quality and different sleep parameters.
The plausible bidirectional association should be further investigated to understand whether the
promotion of a healthy diet could be used as a tool to improve sleep quality.

The Mediterranean diet has been widely investigated as a healthy and environmentally
sustainable dietary pattern, alongside being a palatable diet and relatively easy to accept

in non-Mediterranean cultures [1,2]. The main features characterizing this dietary pattern
include a prevalence of plant-derived foods, such as vegetables, fruit, and whole grains
as the main sources of energy, vitamins, phytochemicals, and fiber; nuts and legumes as
source of healthy fats and proteins; moderate intake of animal-derived foods, including
meat, fish, dairy, eggs, and poultry, to be consumed alternatively; occasional consump-
tion of elaborated sweets; adoption of extra-virgin olive oil as dressing; and moderate
consumption of wine (generally occurring over the course of meals) providing peculiar
phytochemicals, such as (poly)phenols [3,4]. Convincing evidence suggests that adherence
to the Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of cardio-metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative
diseases, and certain cancers [5]. Interestingly, several studies also investigated the poten-
tial relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and other lifestyle factors
potentially affecting mental and brain health [5]. Considering that the Mediterranean diet,
especially when evaluated in individuals living in the Mediterranean context, should refer
not only to eating habits but also to an overall lifestyle, researchers have hypothesized that
adoption of such a dietary pattern could be associated with better sleep features [6].

Sleep is considered a key physiological process for the human body. Aside from its
effects on the brain [7], poor sleep is also related to a higher risk of type-2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease [8]. Importantly, sleep disorders may represent a prodromic factor
for mental and brain health issues, being associated with cognitive and affective disorders,
as well as neurodegenerative conditions in general [9]. Lifestyle factors that may alter
the circadian rhythm, such as extreme mental stress, may also contribute to the burden
of sleep disorders [10]. Among other factors, dietary habits may play some role in sleep
quality [6]. In this context, the joint effect of a healthy diet (such as the Mediterranean
diet) and good sleep quality might be of paramount importance in preventing a large set
of chronic non-communicable diseases, especially those concerning the central nervous
system [11]. The aim of this study was to systematically review published studies so far
exploring the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and
sleep features (including quality and duration) in observational studies.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Selection

A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed/EMBASE), from their inception
up to January 2023, was conducted to identify studies examining the association between
adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and sleep features. Relevant terms were
included in the search strategy to identify potentially relevant studies as follows: (Mediter-
ranean diet OR dietary pattern OR dietary score OR dietary adherence) and (sleep OR
apnea OR insomnia OR sleepiness) with no restrictions. Furthermore, the studies to be
included were also checked to identify whether they were potentially relevant for the
purpose of the present systematic review. The search, study selection, and reporting were
independently performed by two authors following the Meta-analyses Of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines [12]. The study protocol has been registered
in PROSPERO (CRD42022345280).

2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The following inclusion criteria were considered when assessing the potentially rel-
evant studies: (i) having an observational design (such as, cohort, cross-sectional, or
case-control), (ii) included adult population (≥18 years old), (iii) reported data regard-
ing the association between the Mediterranean diet and sleep features (i.e., sleep qual-
ity, duration, daytime sleepiness, etc.). On the contrary, studies conducted on (i) chil-
dren or adolescent population (<18 years old), (ii) pregnant women, and (iii) patients
with end-stage degenerative diseases were not considered suitable for the purposes of
this review.

2.3. Data Extraction

A standardized electronic form was used as guidance to extract the data from all
eligible studies. The data collected were the following: (i) name of the first author and
publication year; (ii) study design and location; (iii) age and sex of individuals included;
(iv) sample size; (v) methods of assessment of dietary habits and adherence to the Mediter-
ranean diet; (vi) methods of assessment of sleep-related outcomes; (vii) and summary of
the study findings.

3.1. Main Characteristics of the Included Studies

The process of study search and selection is shown in Figure 1. Out of the initial
2255 potential articles identified, 1853 and 338 studies were not included based on the title
and abstract evaluation, respectively, leaving 64 articles to be evaluated in full length. After
a detailed review of the studies, 41 reports were excluded for at least one of the following
reasons: 13 studies were conducted on children and/or adolescents, 27 studies did not
report data on the sleep features or reported different exposure, and 1 was conducted
on pregnant women. After checking for potential missing reports from the bibliographic
references of the identified studies, a final pool of 23 articles [13–35] was selected to be
included in the present study according to the eligibility criteria.

Figure 1. Flow chart of the study selection process.

The main characteristics of the 23 observational studies selected for inclusion in the
systematic review are presented in Table 1. A total of 18 studies were conducted on the
adult general population, and 5 in individuals with health conditions. Nineteen had a cross-
sectional design, while four [14,15,21,24] studies provided longitudinal data on exposure
or outcome, yet were cross-sectionally analyzed. Eighteen reported on both sexes, 2 solely
on males and 3 on females. Concerning the geographic area, 16 articles’ studies were
conducted in Europe, 5 in North America and 2 in Asia, with the majority of the studies
being conducted in the Mediterranean basin (n = 13). Most studies applied subjective scales
and tools as well as clinical symptoms to assess sleep quality features. Dietary intakes
were most often registered by food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and adherence to the
Mediterranean diet assessed through a variety of instruments as listed in Table 1.

Higher adherence to the MD was inversely
associated with having insomnia
symptoms; however, this was only
in women.

Higher adherence to the MD diet was
associated with better sleep quality and
with lower risk of changes in sleep
duration at follow-up.

Individuals with moderate–high adherence
to the MD were more likely to have an
adequate sleep duration (6–7 vs.
<6 h/night; p < 0.01), when compared to
those with low adherence, and less likely to
report insomnia symptoms occurring with
short sleep (vs. no insomnia or short sleep
alone; p < 0.05).

Sleep quality was positively associated
with MD adherence (p < 0.001), whereas no
association with sleep duration was found.
When taking into account age, sleep quality
was positively associated with MD
adherence only in participants aged
≤75 years (p < 0.001).

For each point increase of the MD score,
individuals were 10% more likely to have
adequate sleep quality. When considering
weight status, a significant association
between adherence to the MD and sleep
quality was found in normal/overweight
individuals, although not in obese
participants.

No correlation between adherence to the
MD and sleep quality or other sleep

High long-term adherence to the MD was
inversely associated with excessive daytime
sleepiness. On the contrary, adherence to
the MD was not associated with probable
REM sleep behavior disorder.

A significant association between high MD
adherence and better sleep quality was
found (p < 0.001).

Short sleepers had lower adherence to the
MD diet, when compared to normal
sleepers. Considering sleep quality, short
sleepers with poor sleep quality had lower
odds of having high adherence to the MD,
compared to normal sleepers with good
sleep quality.

A significant association between higher
baseline MD adherence level and better
sleep quality (p < 0.01), higher sleep
efficiency (p < 0.001), and fewer sleep
disturbances (p < 0.01) was found at 1 y of
follow-up.

3.2. Mediterranean Diet and Sleep in Mediterranean Countries

Among investigations conducted in the Mediterranean region, a longitudinal study
conducted on 1596 participants (aged ≥ 60 years) reported that high adherence to the
Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower risk of changes in sleep duration and
a better sleep quality [odds ratio (OR): 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29, 0.68,
p < 0.001)] [14]. However, the majority of studies published to date had a cross-sectional
design. A study including 172 Italian participants (mean age 52 years) to the obesity-
prevention program the Obesity, Programs of Nutrition, Education, Research and Assess-
ment of the best treatment (OPERA) investigated the influence of adherence to Mediter-
ranean diet and sleep quality, assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); the
authors showed that participants with lower PSQI scores (“good sleepers”) had higher
adherence to the Mediterranean diet compared to “poor sleepers”, who reported higher
PSQI scores (p < 0.001) [22]. In another cross-sectional study conducted among 1936 Ital-
ian adults from the Mediterranean healthy Eating, Aging, and Lifestyles (MEAL) study,
recruited among the general population in Southern Italy, reported a higher prevalence of
adequate sleep quality among individuals with higher adherence to the Mediterranean
diet (Q1: 72.4% vs. Q4: 58.9%; p < 0.001) and increased likelihood of better sleep quality
compared to those less adherent (for the highest vs. lowest quartile, OR = 1.82, 95% CI:
1.32, 2.52; 1-point increase, OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.16) [17]. When considering weight
status, a significant association between adherence to the MD and sleep quality was found
in normal/overweight individuals (for the highest vs. lowest quartile, OR = 2.30, 95% CI:
1.49, 3.54; 1-point increase, OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.16), but not in obese participants [17].
Similarly, in a cross-sectional study, involving 1639 subjects (mean age of 73 years) from
the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD), Mediterranean diet
adherence was positively associated with sleep quality (p < 0.001) and in particular in
participants aged ≤ 75 years, whereas there was no association with sleep duration [16].
From the same cohort, another study investigating the probability of prodromal symptoms
of Parkinson’s disease and Mediterranean diet adherence showed that daytime somnolence
was less prevalent in the higher quartile of Mediterranean diet adherence compared to
the lower (43.2% vs. 49.6%, respectively; p = 0.029) [18]. Furthermore, a cross-sectional
study, involving 957 subjects (median age 50 y) enrolled among indigenous and minority
populations in Northeastern Greece showed an association between high Mediterranean
diet adherence and long sleep duration (p = 0.002), long time in bed (p = 0.002) and better
sleep quality (p = 0.009) [28]. Finally, a French multicenter population study involving
5886 subjects aged 65 years and older investigating sociodemographic, behavioral, and
clinical parameters associated with insomnia symptoms (difficulty with initiating and
maintaining sleep) showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was inversely
associated with having insomnia symptoms, but only in women [13]. In contrast to the
aforementioned studies, some investigations reported null findings. A cross-sectional study
including 70 individuals (mean age 53 years) enrolled in the context of the FIT-AGEING
study, an exercise-based randomized controlled trial conducted in Spain showed no associ-
ation between Mediterranean diet adherence assessed through the 14-point questionnaire
PREDIMED and sleep quality assessed with PSQI and wrist accelerometers [20]. Finally,
few studies have been conducted in the context of the COVID-19 lockdown, showing
null results. A study on a convenient sample of 745 adults (median age of 39 years) who
resided in Cyprus during the Spring 2020 lockdown [25] and an Italian cross-sectional
study conducted on 604 individuals (mean age of 29.8 years) [26] aiming to evaluate the
effects of COVID-19 lockdown on dietary habits and sleep quality reported significant
findings on the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and sleep quality in
men, but not in women. It is noteworthy to underline that these studies were conducted
under special conditions and were hard to compare with other general-population studies.

3.3. Mediterranean Diet and Sleep in Non-Mediterranean Countries

Most significant findings have been reported also in studies conducted in non-
Mediterranean countries.
In a longitudinal study conducted on two cohorts (Nurses’
Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study including 11,493 women with
a mean age of 42 years and 5907 men with a mean age of 57 years, respectively) the asso-
ciation between the Mediterranean diet adherence and sleep quality (through the Mayo
Sleep Questionnaire and The Epworth Sleepiness Scale used to measure excessive daytime
sleepiness) considered as a prodromal feature of Parkinson’s disease was tested. While the
diet was examined from 1986 every 4 years, sleep features were tested in 2014–15 result-
ing in an inverse association between high Mediterranean diet adherence and excessive
daytime sleepiness [21]. Also, another cohort study involving 402 women with a mean age
of 37 years established a significant association between the Mediterranean diet and sleep
quality after a 1-year follow-up (β = −0.30 ± 0.10, p < 0.01); moreover, they observed a
significant association between Mediterranean diet adherence and lower sleep disturbances
(β = −0.30 ± 0.12, p = 0.01) and higher sleep efficiency (p = 0.01) [24].

Among studies focusing on sleep duration, a longitudinal study examining the relation
between Mediterranean-style diet, sleep duration and insomnia symptoms in a total of
nearly 2000 participants showed that compared with low MD adherence, moderate–high
adherence was associated with a healthier sleep time (6–7 vs. <6 h/night; p < 0.01) and
less insomnia symptoms (p < 0.05). Furthermore, participants with an unchanging MD
score in the preceding 10 years had fewer insomnia symptoms compared to participants
with a decreasing score (p < 0.01) [15]. Similarly, a cross-sectional study conducted on
22,627 individuals (mean age of 61 years) from the Swedish EpiHealth cohort study, showed
that short sleepers (<6 h/night) were less likely to have high adherence to the Mediterranean
diet (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.87), also in combination with sleep quality (OR = 0.67,
95% CI: 0.52, 0.86) [23]. Another cross-sectional study conducted on 2169 Costa Rican
adults showed a significant association between inconsistent weekday–weekend sleep and
lower Mediterranean diet scores that did not change with sex (β: −0.08, CI: −0.16, 0.006; P,
interaction with sex = 0.93); in women, compared with the recommended sleep duration,
sleep duration <7 h per night was associated with a lower score (β: −0.35, CI: −0.63, −0.07
p = 0.016) [29]. Other studies further investigated overall sleep features, including daytime
sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, and overall sleep quality. A cross-sectional study involving
917 Arab women (mean age 36) exploring the relationship between Mediterranean diet
adherence, sleeping habits, and insomnia showed a significant association between their
Mediterranean-diet-adherence score and better sleep and reduced insomnia symptoms
(p = 0.015) [27]. A cross-sectional study involving 400 health professionals, male adults
working in different healthcare centers affiliated to Baqiyatallah University of Medical
Science across the Tehran province, investigated the relationship between MIND diet, sleep
quality (PSQI), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale; ESS) and insomnia (Insomnia
Severity Index; ISI): individuals with higher adherence to the MIND diet had 42% lower
odds of daytime sleepiness (95% CI: 0.35, 0.98; p-trend = 0.044); moreover, the highest
tertile of MIND diet adherence was significantly associated with better sleep quality (T3
vs. T1, OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.98; p-trend = 0.042) and lower odds of insomnia in the
multivariate-adjusted model (T3 vs. T1, OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.93; p-trend = 0.031) [30].
However, in a cross-sectional study, a total of 970 men (mean age 71 years) from the Uppsala
Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) were involved to investigate the potential
influence of Mediterranean diet adherence on sleep disturbance; no significant association
between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and sleep quality was reported among the
participants [19].

3.4. Mediterranean Diet and Sleep in Health Conditions

Some studies explored the association between the Mediterranean diet and sleep fea-
tures in individuals with health conditions. A total of 309 women with breast cancer were
involved in a cross-sectional study to investigate the influence of Mediterranean diet adher-
ence on quality of life: in the multivariate model adjusted for age, cancer stage, BMI, type
of surgery, comorbidities and combined therapy, a significant inverse association between
Mediterranean diet adherence and insomnia was observed (β = −0.131; p = 0.029) [32]. A
cross-sectional study included 563 patients with multiple sclerosis aged between 18 and
65 years to evaluate the effects of the Mediterranean Diet on sleep disturbance: the results
showed a significant inverse association between Mediterranean diet adherence and sleep
disturbance (β: −0.187; 95% CI: −0.358, −0.017; p = 0.032) [34]. Another cross-sectional
study investigated the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and insomnia in
269 individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) aged between 21 and 70 years. The
authors reported that the patients with the highest Mediterranean diet adherence had
53% lower odds of having insomnia (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.95) [33]. In contrast, in a
cross-sectional study, 162 participants with OSA with a mean age of 67 years were recruited
to focus on the potential effects of MIND adherence on sleep quality but results showed
no significant association between MIND and sleep problems and daytime sleepiness [35].
Moreover, a cross-sectional study conducted on 205 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
with a mean age of 53 years investigated a possible correlation between sleep quality
and Mediterranean diet adherence: results showed that after adjustment, no significant
association was observed between Mediterranean diet and sleep score [31].

4. Discussion

In this study, observational studies investigating the relationship between adoption
of the Mediterranean diet and sleep-related outcomes were systematically reviewed. The
evidence evaluated in this systematic review investigated the relationship between adher-
ence to the Mediterranean diet and sleep quality, including duration, morning sleepiness,
and insomnia. Overall, most studies showed that higher adherence to a Mediterranean
dietary pattern was associated with better sleep features. Although most studies had a
cross-sectional design, the findings are in line with those reported from randomized clinical
trials, suggesting that dietary intervention with a Mediterranean diet may improve sleep
features [36,37].

The main characteristics of the Mediterranean diet may affect brain health and, conse-
quently, be related to sleep features [6,38]. As previously mentioned, the Mediterranean diet
is mainly a plant-based dietary pattern characterized by richness in antioxidant vitamins
(i.e., vitamins C and D) and phytochemicals, such as (poly)phenols, which may contribute
to preventing microglia activation, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production,
and ultimately inhibit neuroinflammation [39]. At the molecular level, (poly)phenols can
inhibit the activation of certain transcription factors, such as the nuclear factor-kappa B
(NF-κB), that are known to be involved in the cellular inflammatory response, leading to the
downregulation of the production of mediators, including cytokines such as interleukin-1β
(IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [40]. Moreover, (poly)phenols demonstrate
neuroprotective effects by modulating signaling pathways within neurons, for instance
by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, involved in
the cellular antioxidant activities [40], and stimulating the sirtuin family receptors, which
regulate some cellular processes related to inflammation and stress response [40]. Besides
phytochemicals, plant richness in minerals, such as zinc and magnesium, has been called
out as potentially favoring sleep quality by the promotion of inhibitory effects on the brain
and some regulation of sleep and wakefulness [41,42].

Some effects on the central nervous system may also depend on the quality of macronu-
trients contained in characteristic foods included in the Mediterranean dietary pattern.
The Mediterranean diet is, in fact, considered a relatively high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet:
however, consumption of fish, olive oil, and oilseeds assure a high consumption of healthy

Nutrients 2024, 16, 282

11 of 15

fats, such as mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA, respectively),
which have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, playing a role in serotonergic and
dopaminergic transmissions, and influencing membrane stability, signal transduction, and
fluidity [43]. Specifically concerning the anti-inflammatory mechanisms, omega-3 PUFA
eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3; DHA) are pre-
cursors of 3-series prostaglandin (PG), 5-series leukotrienes (LT), and 3-series thromboxane
(TX), which are reported to compete with eicosanoids synthesized from omega-6 arachi-
donic acid (20:4, n-6; AA) and exert anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties [44].
Moreover, preference for home cooking as opposed to ready-to-eat meals, having fruits
and nuts as snacks over unhealthy snacks, and supposedly low consumption of meat
products in favor of plant sources of proteins (i.e., legumes) or poultry, eggs and dairy
products may lead to lower consumption of hydrogenated trans fats and long-chain sat-
urated fatty acids [45,46]. Both trans-fatty acids and long-chain saturated fatty acids can
activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of immune cells, including microglia in the
brain, which initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines; the pathways activated involve the Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and the
Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (including extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun n-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK, which can
lead to the expression of inflammatory mediators and the activation of transcription factors
that promote inflammation in macrophages, monocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic
cells [47]. Concerning carbohydrates, the main source of daily energy in the Mediterranean
diet should be provided by whole-grain products: a high dietary content of carbohydrates
is generally related to better sleep, while, conversely, lower intake has been associated
with a longer time spent in slow-wave sleep and less time in rapid-eye-movement (REM)
sleep [48]. Moreover, the high content in complex molecules and fiber would provide a
lower glycemic index, which has been related to improved sleep quality [49]. Conversely,
a high intake of added simple sugars (supposed to be low in the Mediterranean diet) has
been associated with a worsening of hippocampal function possibly mediated by neuroin-
flammatory processes [50]. The neurophysiological mechanisms behind such observations
are still under investigation: one can hypothesize that carbohydrates may affect tryptophan
content in the central nervous system, which is needed to synthetize serotonin, also impor-
tant for melatonin production [51]. Another potential mechanism relies on the hypothesis
that glucose-sensing neurons in the hypothalamus may affect hypothalamus [52].

Besides the direct role of macronutrients toward brain function, the content in short-
chain saturated fats, fiber, and protein quality (plant vs. animal protein), as well as non-
nutrient compounds (i.e., polyphenols), has been demonstrated to modulate the gut mi-
crobiota, which in turn may exert certain effects on the brain via the gut–brain axis and
potentially affect sleep features [53]. Indigestible complex carbohydrates, when unpro-
cessed by human enzymes, undergo fermentation by the intestinal flora, resulting in the
production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) during fermentation [54]. These SCFAs,
encompassing acetate, propionate, and butyrate, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects that can
extend to the brain through neuronal and glial signaling pathways, as well as immune
system activation. An imbalance in intestinal flora, known as “dysbiosis”, may induce
heightened permeability of the intestinal mucosa, leading to a condition commonly referred
to as “leaky gut” [55]. Consequently, bacterial elements, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
derived from bacterial cell walls, attach to circulating macrophages and monocytes, trigger-
ing an inflammatory response (activation of the immune system with promoted synthesis
of pro-inflammatory cytokines) [56]. Moreover, bioactive compounds such as (poly)phenols
have also been shown to modulate the activation of genes involved in circadian clock genes
and leptin, the hormone regulating the energy balance by suppressing hunger [57]. Disrup-
tions in the sleep–wake cycle may lead to variations in the taxonomic configurations of gut
microbiota, which in turn have been associated stress/anxiety episodes and sleep-related
issues [58,59].

The results presented in this systematic review are strengthened by good consistency
across studies and the inclusion of some relatively large cohorts. However, the findings
should be interpreted in light of some limitations. First, the observational design of
the studies included does not allow for assessing the direction of the association or a
causal relationship. Several studies provided cross-sectional analyses, further limiting
the evidence concerning a possible causative role of diet on sleep or vice versa. Second,
adherence to the Mediterranean diet was generally calculated through derivative methods,
such as FFQs and 24 h recalls, which are likely to be limited by recall bias and affected
by social desirability bias, which in turn could lead to either under or over estimation of
food intake. Third, most of the studies evaluated sleep features using only self-reported
questionnaires and not objective tools (i.e., actigraphy). Lastly, the large variety of tools used
to test sleep features, instruments to evaluate the level of adherence to the Mediterranean
diet, and risk measures to assess the associations between these factors made it impossible
to perform a quantitative summary analysis of the evidence.

5. Conclusions

In summary, adoption of a Mediterranean dietary pattern appears to be linked with
improved sleep characteristics. Despite the possibility of a causal relationship, the outcomes
of this study consistently demonstrate that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is
associated with overall better sleep quality. These findings could support the inclusion
of the Mediterranean diet in intervention programs to promote healthy eating aiming to
improve sleep quality or sleep-related features. The appealing aspect of the Mediterranean
diet, which includes flavorful foods with inherently robust organoleptic and nutritional
properties, could be an additional incentive for its adoption especially if compared to
interventions limiting certain foods’ or nutrients’ intake.
