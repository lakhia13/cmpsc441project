Pharmacological and genetic evidence support a role for an involvement of the dopamine D2-receptor (D2-R) in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous molecular imaging studies have suggested lower levels of D2-R in thalamus, but results
are inconclusive. The objective of the present study was to use improved methodology to compare D2-R density in whole thalamus
and thalamic subregions between ﬁrst-episode psychosis patients and healthy controls. Differences in thalamocortical connectivity
was explored based on the D2-R results. 19 antipsychotic-naive ﬁrst-episode psychosis patients and 19 age- and sex-matched
healthy controls were examined using high-resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and the high-afﬁnity D2-R radioligand
[11C]FLB457. The main outcome was D2-R binding potential (BPND) in thalamus, and it was predicted that patients would have lower
binding. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in a subgroup of 11 patients and 15 controls. D2-R binding in whole
thalamus was lower in patients compared with controls (Cohen’s dz = −0.479, p = 0.026, Bayes Factor (BF) > 4). Among subregions,
lower BPND was observed in the ROI representing thalamic connectivity to the frontal cortex (Cohen’s dz = −0.527, p = 0.017, BF >
6). A meta-analysis, including the sample of this study, conﬁrmed signiﬁcantly lower thalamic D2-R availability in patients.
Exploratory analyses suggested that patients had lower fractional anisotropy values compared with controls (Cohen’s d = −0.692,
p = 0.036) in the inferior thalamic radiation. The ﬁndings support the hypothesis of a dysregulation of thalamic dopaminergic
neurotransmission in schizophrenia, and it is hypothesized that this could underlie a disturbance of thalamocortical connectivity.

INTRODUCTION
The dopamine system has for several decades been of central
importance for research on the pathophysiology and treatment of
schizophrenia. Well over one hundred molecular imaging studies
have investigated the in vivo effects of antipsychotic treatments,
showing that all currently licensed antipsychotic drugs block
dopamine D2 receptors (D2-R) [1, 2]. Moreover, a causal role for
D2-R in the disease mechanism of schizophrenia has been
suggested by genetic studies [3]. Molecular imaging studies have
shown a slight
increase in striatal D2-R in psychosis and
schizophrenia patients compared with controls, although this
was not signiﬁcant in the subsample of antipsychotic-naive ﬁrst-
episode patients [4]. However several other brain regions have
been considered more important in generating the diversity of
symptoms observed in schizophrenia. Further investigations of
dopaminergic function outside of the striatum is therefore needed
in order to understand the pathophysiology of the disorder.

A region of key interest in schizophrenia is the thalamus, which
is richly interconnected to the cortex, and plays a central role in
coordinating signaling both to and in between cortical regions
[5, 6]. In a series of positron emission tomography (PET) studies
using the high-afﬁnity D2-R radioligands [11C]FLB 457 and [18F]
Fallypride, which were developed for low-density extrastriatal
regions [7, 8], D2-R binding has shown to be lower in thalamus in
patients with psychosis compared with controls [9–12]. However,
no differences, or increases have also been observed using these
radioligands [13–16]. A meta-analysis, which also included studies
using other radioligands, showed lower thalamic D2-R binding in
patients (d = −0.32), but
the difference was not statistically
signiﬁcant [17]. Importantly, the analysis included several studies
with patients with previous exposure to medication and in later
disease stages, and some of the studies used radioligands with
low signal-to-noise for quantifying D2-R in extrastriatal brain
regions. Hence, additional studies are needed to conﬁrm if there

indeed is a decrease of D2-R in thalamus in schizophrenia,
preferably using high-afﬁnity radioligands in samples not affected
by antipsychotic drug treatment and other confounders stemming
from chronical illness.

The thalamic complex is functionally heterogenous, being part of
parallel circuits with distinct physiological implications. Neuropatho-
logical studies in schizophrenia have primarily shown a signiﬁcant
reduction in the number of neurons in the thalamic mediodorsal
and pulvinar subregions [18–20].
In some of the previous PET
studies, low D2-R binding was found speciﬁcally in medial [9–12]
and posterior subregions of the thalamus [10]. However, the low
resolution of the PET systems used in these studies and the diversity
in region of interest (ROI) deﬁnition limit the conclusions that can be
drawn. Additionally, none of the previous studies based the regional
analysis on underlying functional anatomy.

The primary aims of this study were to (1) conﬁrm previous
observations of lower D2-R binding in the thalamus in psychosis and
schizophrenia patients, (2) extend the subregional D2-R analysis
using improved methodology, and (3) based on subregional D2-R
differences, investigate aberrations in thalamo-cortical connectivity
in an exploratory manner. For these purposes, we used high-
resolution PET and the high-afﬁnity radioligand [11C]FLB457 to
examine 19 drug-naive ﬁrst-episode psychosis patients and 19
matched healthy control subjects. Thalamic subregions were
deﬁnied using a connectivity-based atlas. An exploratory diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of thalamic structural connectivity was
performed based on the PET results for a subgroup of individuals.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Patients and healthy control subjects
The study was approved by the Stockholm Regional Ethics Committee (Dnr
2010/879-31/1) and the Radiation and Safety Committee at the Karolinska
University Hospital. All subjects provided written consent after receiving a
complete description of the study, according to the Helsinki declaration.
Patients with ﬁrst-episode psychosis, as deﬁned by ﬁrst contact with
psychiatric services due to psychotic symptoms, were recruited from
outpatient clinics and psychiatric wards in the Stockholm region. At time of
recruitment and during their participation in the study, all patients were
fully naive to antipsychotic drugs. The ﬁnal patient sample consisted of
19 subjects (11 males, 8 females, mean (SD) age 29.3 (6.3)). Patients fulﬁlled
criteria for the following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders IV diagnoses at inclusion: schizophrenia (N = 6), schizophreni-
form disorder (N = 5), psychotic disorder NOS (N = 5), and delusional
disorder (N = 3), as assessed using SCID-I. Symptoms were rated using the
Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

Nineteen healthy control subjects (11 males, 8 females, mean (SD) age
29.2 (5.9)) were recruited by advertisement
to match against a
corresponding patient of the same age (±2 years) and the same sex.
Control subjects were healthy according to medical history, clinical
examination, routine laboratory blood test as well as a brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) examination.

Two patients and two healthy control subjects used nicotine on a daily
basis. Eight patients received anxiolytics (benzodiazepine (5 patients,
oxazepam, mean = 11 mg,
range 5–15 mg) and/or antihistamines (5
patients)) during their participation in the PET study. For exclusion criteria
see Supplementary information.

MRI, DTI examinations, and ROI delineation
Structural MRI data was obtained using a 3-T General Electric Discovery
MR750 system (GE, Milwaukee, WI, USA). T1-weighted images were used
for ROI delineation, and T2-weighted FLAIR images were assessed for
pathology by a neuroradiologist. One control subject was examined on a
1.5T GE Signa system (Milwaukee, WI) instead of the 3 T-system.

Diffusion-weighted data were collected for a subset of 11 patients and
15 control subjects with a spin-echo sequence in the axial plane with
diffusion gradients in 60 directions and b-values of 1000 s/mm2. Images
were acquired with a ﬁeld of view of 240 mm and a slice thickness of
290 mm, with a voxel size of 1.875 × 1.875 × 2.9 mm.

Thalamic ROIs were obtained using the FMRIB FSL v.5.0.7 software [21].
For whole thalamus ROI, the FSL Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas was used

with a 50% probability threshold. For thalamic subregionals delineation,
the Oxford Thalamic Connectivity Atlas [22] (probability thresholding at
50%) was used to extract the following ROIs: (1) Anterior part of the
mediodorsal nucleus and ventral anterior nuclei with DTI projections to
the prefrontal cortex (THA-PFC ROI); (2) the most medial part of the
mediodorsal nucleus, parts of the anterior complex and medial and inferior
pulvinar
(3) ventral
posterolateral nucleus which projects to primary motor cortex (THA-M1);
(4) ventral lateral nucleus and the ventral anterior nucleus which project to
premotor areas (THA-PreMC); and (5) anterior parts of the pulvinar that
project to posterior parietal cortex (THA-PPC) (Fig. 1). For additional details
see Supplementary information. Since we had no hypothesis of hemi-
spheric differences, right and left hemisphere ROIs were pooled to increase
count statistics.

that projects to the temporal cortex (THA-TC);

A cerebellum mask was also extracted using the maximum probability
FSL MNI FNIRT atlas. The mask was then trimmed to exclude voxels close to
the vermis, the cortex, and the most inferior part of the PET image, as has
been described previously [23]. Subsequently, all ROIs were warped back
into the individual T1-image space.

PET examinations and data quantiﬁcation
All patients and all healthy controls were examined using the high-
resolution research tomograph (Siemens Molecular Imaging, Knoxville, TN,
USA) at the Karolinska Institutet PET center. A drug toxicology screen was
performed prior to the PET examination. [11C]FLB 457 was prepared as
described previously [24] and injected into the antecubital vein as a rapid
bolus. Mean (SD) injected activity was 425.95 (47.98) MBq, mean (SD)
speciﬁc activity was 374 (203) Gbq/micromol, and mean injected mass was
0.4–0.7 microg. All emission scans were 90 min long. Non-invasive Logan
Graphical Analysis [25] with cerebellum as reference region was used to
obtain BPND values in all thalamic ROIs. All quantitative analyses were
performed using the “kinﬁtr” package in R [26]. For additional details,
see Supplementary information.

Exploratory DTI analysis
The thalamus and its subregions (i.e., as deﬁned by Oxford Thalamic
Connectivity Atlas, see above), connect to cortical regions by axons
gathered into white matter tracts, radiations. Based on the results of the
PET analyses of thalamic subregions we chose to study the two major
radiations leading to and from the TH-PFC ROI, the anterior thalamic
radiation (ATR) and inferior thalamic radiation (ITR) [22, 27]. This was done
by manual dissection according to existing protocols [28, 29] on whole
brain tractography with a fractional anisotropy threshold of 0.2 and an
angle threshold of 30°, using ExploreDTI
[30]. See Supplementary
information and Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed description and
illustration. Motion and eddy current correction of the data was performed
using ElastiX [31]. Diffusion-weighted sequences were only available for a
subset of the study subjects (11 patients and 15 healthy controls).

Statistical analysis
In this study, the statistical analyses and procedures related to analysis of
PET data (whole thalamus and subthalamic analyses) were pre-registered a
priori and are hence considered to be conﬁrmatory analyses. The DTI
analyses were considered to be exploratory in nature, with the aim of
generating new hypotheses regarding connectivity changes associated
with an aberrant thalamic D2-R system. Since previously reported effect
sizes of patient-control differences in thalamic D2-R availability have been
small to medium in size [17], we elected to form directed (i.e. one-sided) a
priori hypotheses in this study, in conjunction with paired matching of
patients and controls, in order to maximize the power of the tests. This
entails us making more speciﬁc predictions about the effect, which affords
us a higher degree of sensitivity, assuming that these predictions were
appropriate. In this way, we are leveraging the ﬁndings of prior research to
improve the power of our research design while minimizing the number of
these
participants who must be exposed to radioactivity to test
hypotheses. The preregistration protocol
further
(https://osf.io/nhr3w/)
outlines the a priori predictions and the rationale behind the chosen
statistical tests.

To examine patient-control differences in [11C]FLB 457 BPND, we
performed a frequentist paired-sample t-test using a one-sided hypothesis,
i.e. expecting patients to have lower [11C]FLB 457 BPND (speciﬁed a priori in
the preregistration document). We examined the whole thalamus as well
as thalamic subregions (setting α = 0.05). We also applied a Bayesian

paired-sample t-test,
in which we made use not only of the expected
direction of the effect, but also the expected magnitude observed in
previous studies. This was done using a meta-analytical effect size on D2-R
patient-control differences in thalamus and its uncertainty as a prior over
the research hypothesis, which we compared to the null hypothesis of no
difference [32] (see Supplementary information for details). This approach,
also speciﬁed a priori in the preregistration document, allows us to make
even more speciﬁc predictions compared to the frequentist approach, by
taking previously available information into account when shaping the
research hypothesis. By using the Bayes Factor (BF) we then evaluated
whether the collected data are more consistent with the hypothesis of
decreases in thalamic D2-R binding in psychosis and schizophrenia
patients (H1), or with the null hypothesis of no effect (H0). A BF in favor
of H1 relative to H0 (BFH1:H0) above 3 is commonly interpreted as moderate
evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, and in the present
study would be viewed as support for a successful replication of the
previous ﬁndings of lower patient binding. A BF in favor of H0 relative to
H1 (BFH0:H1) above 3 is commonly interpreted as moderate evidence in
favor of the null hypothesis,
indicating that no difference in binding
between patients and controls gained support in our study [33].

To correct for multiple comparisons in the subregional analysis, a
permutation procedure was employed [34] to estimate the average
increase in type I error, while taking the dependency between the ﬁve ROIs
into account, resulting in a family-wise error corrected α of 0.0356
(see Supplementary information for additional details).

The statistical analyses presented in the main text deviates from the
preregistration in one important manner. When deﬁning the alterna-
tive hypothesis for the BF test of whole-thalamus difference above, we
opted to also include the study by Talvik et al. [12], Yasuno et al., Slifstein
et al. [13], and Veselinovic et al. [15] in addition to the studies reported in
the Kambeitz et al. meta-analysis [17]. A systematic literature search was
performed dating from January 1st 2013 to March 16th 2021 to make sure
no additional studies were overlooked, allowing us to shape an H1
informed by all previous published literature (see Supplementary informa-
tion and Supplementary Fig. 2 for additional details). For full transparency
the results from the BF-analysis carried out as written in the preregistration
are also reported in the Supplementary information (the overall conclusion
does not differ between these two analyses). In the results section, we

Molecular Psychiatry (2022) 27:1233 – 1240

consequently opted to present meta-analytic results on thalamic D2-R
availability differences between patients with psychotic disorders and
healthy controls, combining the results from this study with the previous
literature (based on the literature search above). One analysis was
conducted using all published studies, similar to Kambeitz et al., and we
also performed a separate analysis including only studies using either of
the two high-afﬁnity radioligands [18F]Fallypride or [11C]FLB457, which
low-density D2-R regions than all other
have higher sensitivity for
radioligands used. A further addition to the preregistration protocol
is
that frequentist and BF two-sample t-tests were also performed (presented
in the supplementary tables), in addition to the paired t-tests. All statistical
analyses were carried out using R (v. 3.5.1 “Feather Spray”) or JASP (v.
0.10.2).

For the DTI analyses, the literature has shown both increases and
decreases of
fractional anisotropy in psychosis and schizophrenia,
although most studies appear to report increases [35, 36]. Since the
analyses were exploratory, we opted to make use of a two-sided t-test,
without any corrections for multiple comparisons. P-values from these
analyses are hence to be considered only as continuous assessments of
indirect evidence against the null, and not of conﬁrmatory nature [37].
Since DTI data was only available for a subset of the subjects, matching
was not possible and the analysis was unpaired. For information on
patient-control matching see Supplementary information.

RESULTS
Patients were moderately ill, with average PANSS and CGI scores
of 65.6 and 4.5 respectively, and the duration of illness was
12.1 months. Additional demographic, radiochemical, and clinical
variables for patients and healthy controls are presented in
Table 1.

compared with healthy controls (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The BFH1:H0
from the Bayesian paired t-test indicated that the data was ~5
the alternative
times more likely to have originated under
hypothesis compared to the null hypothesis of no difference.

Meta-analyses
When combining the results from this study with previous
literature on D2-R availability differences in the whole thalamus,
the meta-analysis showed a signiﬁcant overall lower binding in
patients with psychotic disorders compared with healthy controls
(pooled effect size −0.29, Fig. 3a). This was also the case when
including only studies performed using the two high-afﬁnity
radioliogands [18F]Fallypride and [11C]FLB457, with a slightly larger
pooled effect size of −0.37 (Fig. 3b).

Analysis of D2-R availability in thalamic subregions
Among the thalamic subregions deﬁned by the Oxford Thalamic
Connectivity atlas, the thalamus-PFC ROI showed the largest effect
(Table 2), with BFH1:H0 indicating that there was 6 times more
support for the alternative hypothesis compared to the null hypoth-
esis (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The difference was also signiﬁcant with a p-
value (0.017) below the family-wise error rate corrected alpha
threshold. No other subregion in the thalamus showed signiﬁcant
differences, and support for either hypothesis was inconclusive
according to the Bayesian paired t-tests (BFH1:H0 and BFH0:H1 < 3).

DTI analysis
The ﬁnal objective of the study was to explore possible differences
in structural thalamocortical connectivity using DTI, with fractional
anisotropy of the white matter tracts as the parameter of interest.
For
the ITR, data were skewed and the non-parametric
Mann–Whitney U-test was used when comparing patients and
healthy subjects. Patients showed lower fractional anisotropy values
(mean = 0.375, 0.017 SD) compared with healthy control subjects
(mean = 0.389, 0.020 SD, Cohen’s d = −0.692, p = 0.036) in the ITR,
whereas fractional anisotropy values of the ATR showed very similar
values in patients (mean = 0.423, 0.0145 SD) and controls (mean =
0.426, 0.023 SD, Cohen’s d = 0.128, p = 0.75).

PANSS correlations
Associations were explored between the PANSS total, PANSS positive
and PANSS negative scores and BPND in the whole thalamus and in

the Thalamus-PFC subregion, ﬁnding no signiﬁcant correlations
(see Supplementary information).

Robustness checks
After observing a signiﬁcant difference between patients and
controls in injected mass (Table 1) we examined the association
between injected mass, speciﬁc molar activity, and [11C]FLB457
BPND, ﬁnding no association (see Supplementary information). No
signiﬁcant difference was observed between the cerebellar SUV of
patients and controls (Supplementary Table 1). There was also no
difference in thalamic volumes between patients and controls
(Supplementary Table 2).

Two-sample (unpaired) p-values for the BPND patient-control
comparisons in whole thalamus and thalamic subregions showed
similar results as in the main analysis (Supplementary Table 3). We
also re-ran the main analyses after having excluded four
participants with partially incomplete or missing data, ﬁnding
somewhat higher p-values but unchanged effect sizes (Supple-
mentary Table 4).

We performed a set of robustness-checks over the alternative
hypotheses in the BF t-tests. These also provided evidence in favor
of alternative hypothesis of lower D2-R availability in patients
(Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig. 3, and Supplemen-
tary information).

Funnel plots for the meta-analyses are shown in Supplementary

Fig. 4, revealing no apparent publication bias.

Finally, we performed an additional meta-analysis excluding
Talvik et al. [38] and Yasuno et al. [10], since there was some
overlap in the sample between these studies and Talvik et al. [12]
and Suhara et al. [14], respectively. This exclusion did not change
the overall ﬁnding of lower thalamic D2-R availability in patients
compared with healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION
In this PET study examining thalamic D2-R in a sample of only
drug-naive psychosis patients compared to healthy controls we
observed lower binding in patients. This is the ﬁrst study
investigating thalamic subregions in psychosis patients using
high-resolution PET. By employing a connectivity-based atlas we
identiﬁed lower D2-R levels in a thalamic subregion with
projections to the frontal cortex. In a subgroup of patients, we

observed a tentative result of lower fractional anisotropy values
compared with controls in the ITR, which predominantly projects
to and from the thalamus and the orbitofrontal, temporal and
insular cortex. Taken together, the PET results strengthen the
evidence for changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission in the
thalamus as a part of the pathophysiology in schizophrenia. Based
on the exploratory DTI analyses, we further hypothesize that these
may underlie aberrant connectivity between regions shown to be
of importance for the pathophysiology of the disorder. Notably, an
increase or no change in striatal D2-R has been observed in
schizophrenia and psychosis patients [4], suggestive of regionally
speciﬁc alterations of dopaminergic transmission.

Previous studies investigating D2-R in thalamus have yielded
inconsistent results. Two early studies using [11C]FLB457 in drug-
naive samples showed lower D2-R binding in the thalamus
[10, 12]. The sample in Talvik et al. [12] was then extended to 18
patients in a study using the medium afﬁnity radioligand [11C]
raclopride showing lower D2-R in the right thalamus compared
with controls [38]. A more recent study using [11C]FLB457 in a
combination of drug naive and drug free patient showed no
difference in thalamic binding [13]. In two studies, single photon
emission computer tomography (SPECT) and the radioligand [123I]
epidepride was used in 25 and 6 antipsychotic-naive patients
respectively, showing no signiﬁcant difference in binding between
patients and controls [39, 40]. Two studies that employed PET and
the radioligand [18F] Fallypride in a combination of drug-naive and
drug-free patients, showed lower BPND values medial thalamic
subregions [9, 11] whereas one study showed an increase in whole
thalamus [16] and yet another one found no difference [15].
Finally,
two studies using the agonist and D3-R preferring
radioligand [11C]PHNO in 13 drug-free and 12 drug-naive patients
respectively showed no signiﬁcant difference compared with
controls [41, 42].

structures

in the brain. Of

In these studies, sample sizes have generally been small, and
several studies have had methodological limitations. SPECT has
much lower spatial resolution than PET, a factor which is critical
when examining smaller
the
[18F]Fallypride and [11C]FLB457 are high-
radioligands used,
afﬁnity tracers, while [11C]raclopride shows low speciﬁc binding
and poor convergent validity in thalamus [43, 44]. Importantly,
several studies included patients previously treated with anti-
psychotics [9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 41], which has been shown to result in
increased D2-R levels in post-mortem and in vivo studies [45, 46].
Thus, medication effects may have masked “true” reductions in
baseline D2-R in some previous studies. In the present study we
exclusively included antipsychotic-naive patients, and used high-
resolution PET in combination with a high-afﬁnity radioligand for
D2-R. To inform our analysis, we used all previously published data
on differences between healthy controls and drug-free patients
with psychotic disorders or schizophrenia, conﬁrming support in
favor of decreased D2-R availability in patients. Finally, by adding
the results from this study to the previous studies in a meta-
analysis, we show an overall signiﬁcantly lower D2-R availability in
patients (Fig. 3) (despite possible medication effects in previous
studies), which is major step towards resolving the uncertainty in
the previous literature.

It should be noted however that the overlap between the
patient and healthy control group is large in both the current
study and in the meta-analyses, with the 95% CIs being both
compatible with a medium sized, as well as a negligible group-
difference. This suggests that a subgroup of patients may differ in
thalamic D2-R receptor levels compared with healthy participants,
but that there will also be patients in the population showing little
to no aberration. Further studies in larger samples are needed to
identify such subgroups.

The thalamic complex includes a large number of cytoarchi-
tectonically distinct nuclei, each being components of circuits with
distinct physiological and functional implications [22, 47]. Whereas

previous studies have explored arbitrarily deﬁned thalamic
subregions, we used an atlas of thalamic subregions based on
DTI connectivity data [22], which in combination with high-
resolution PET provides an increase in functional-anatomical
speciﬁcity. Our results are consistent with aberrant dopaminergic
functioning in the subregion relaying to the prefrontal cortex. The
role in the
frontal cortex is believed to play an important
pathology behind psychotic disorder, and has been centrally
implicated in both positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of
schizophrenia [48–50].

From a functional neuroanatomical perspective, the frontal
cortex is a large and heterogenous area. Using DTI we attempted
to be more speciﬁc, assuming that altered receptor levels are
related to alterations in structure that is reﬂected in the white
matter structure and DTI metrics. Our combined PET (pointing at
prefrontal cortex) and DTI
results suggest changes in DA

frontal insular cortex, which is included in the thalamus-PFC ROI
used [22]. In contrast, we did not observe any differences in the
ATR, which has been implicated in other DTI studies on
antipsychotic-naive ﬁrst-episode psychosis patients [51]. Orbito-
frontal cortex and insula have both shown structural changes in
antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia subjects as measured with
voxel-based morphometry [52, 53] and are central to in reward
processing and self-awareness, two functions that are thought to
be perturbed in schizophrenia [50, 54].

A possible factor underlying the observed changes in dopamine
receptor levels may be loss of synaptic connections. Post-mortem
studies have shown widespread loss of synaptic structures, as well
as reduction of synaptic markers in schizophrenia [55, 56].
Recently a PET study employing the radioligand [11C]UCB-J, which
binds to the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A showed widespread

lower binding in patients compared with controls,
indicating
lower synaptic density in cortical regions as well as the thalamus
[57]. Further, mechanistic data based on patient-derived cellular
models indicate increased microglial synapse elimination in
schizophrenia and link the schizophrenia risk locus containing
the complement component 4 isotype genes to excessive synapse
elimination [58]. This motivates further investigations into the
relationship between synaptic loss and connectivity in thalamo-
cortical projections, and dopaminergic function in schizophrenia.
A potential limitation of the present analysis is that a series of
studies have shown that a small amount of speciﬁc [11C]FLB457
binding is present in the cerebellum for most subjects [59–61],
such that a more ideal quantiﬁcation of binding would be to
measure radioactivity in arterial blood to use as an arterial input
function. Although non-signiﬁcant differences between the
cerebellar SUV of patients and controls were observed, cerebellar
binding cannot be fully excluded as a potential confounder.
Another possible confounder is that of partial volume effects,
meaning that smaller volumes in patients could lead to increased
loss of signal, resulting in false low BPND values. However, volumes
for whole thalamus as well as
thalamic subregions were
numerically higher in this speciﬁc patient sample, making this
explanation unlikely. Finally, 5 patients had received low doses of
bensodiazepines at the time of PET which may have inﬂuenced
the results [62]. Apart from the limitation constituted by the
modest sample size, there are technical constraints in the DTI
analysis such as the low and anisotropic resolution. In addition,
tractography of the ITR suffers from its orbitofrontal course which
is a distortion-prone region in MRI. Our anatomical description is
however in line with that of other researchers using DTI [22, 28]
and the animal literature [27].

In conclusion, our ﬁndings support

the hypothesis of a
thalamic dopaminergic neurotransmission in
dysregulation of
schizophrenia. Based on the results, we hypothesize that such
dopaminergic aberrations could in turn could underlie a
disturbance of speciﬁc thalamocortical circuits. This should be
investigated in future studies, including a larger sample of drug-
naive patients examined with DTI.
