## What are arts and creative therapies?


Arts and creative therapies are treatments which involve creative activities within therapy sessions. They use different art forms, such as drawing, music or dance. And they're provided by a trained professional.

You don't need to have any art skills. And people of any age can benefit from them. Different people will have different experiences of arts and creative therapies, but in general they aim to:

- Allow you to communicate thoughts and feelings that you find difficult to put into words

- Help you make sense of things and understand yourself better

- Give you a safe time and place with someone who won't judge you

- Help you find new ways to look at problems or difficult situations

- Help you to talk about complicated feelings or difficult experiences

- Give you a chance to connect with other people

Therapy sessions can take place in a one-to-one setting, or in a group. A range of settings provide them. This includes charities such aslocal Minds, day centres, hospitals and private therapists.

Art therapy lets you express feelings you can't find words to explain. You talk through the image with your therapist and communicate through it, taking the pressure off.


## What can arts therapies treat?


Guidelines from theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)recommend that arts therapies are considered for everyone who haspsychosisorschizophrenia. This includes related conditions such asschizoaffective disorder.

Research suggests that arts and creative therapies may help with other mental health problems. But it's difficult to be sure, because many studies have included only small numbers of people. More research is needed.

Arts and creative therapies may help if you find it difficult to put your thoughts and feelings into words. They may also help with addressing painful feelings or experiences oftrauma.

Some people find that doing a creative activity with their therapist helps put them at ease. It can also make the session feel less intense.

It helps when I struggle to find the words, when I'm too angry, despairing or confused to know what I think. It gives me a voice.


## What are the different types of arts and creative therapies?


The main types of arts and creative therapies in the UK are:

- Dance movement psychotherapy

Art therapy involves using art materials. For example, you might use pens, pencils, crayons, paint, chalk, clay or collaging. You might also use digital media, such as photos or video. You don't need to have any art skills or experience.

With support from your therapist, you might use art materials to express your feelings or experiences. And your therapist might sometimes provide ideas or prompts. For example, some art therapy groups focus on a particular theme or activity each session.

Your therapist won't judge your art or tell you what it means. They'll help you explore what it means to you and how you felt about making it.

For example, you may talk about why you chose a particular colour or material in your artwork. But not everything you make will need to have a meaning.

Some people find that art therapy helps them to:

- Communicate feelings or thoughts they find difficult to talk about

- Look at a problem or situation in a new way

- Explore difficult or painful experiences

- Understand themselves better

- Feel more comfortable in therapy

Find out more from theBritish Association of Art Therapists (BAAT).


### Art has been a healing tool


It helps soothe my nervous system and gather my attention, even if just for a moment. My sketchbook is my safe space.


### Dance movement psychotherapy


Dance movement psychotherapy (also known as dance therapy) involves using body movement and dance. For example, you might explore different types of movements and rhythms. You don't need to have any dance skills or experience.

Some people find that dance movement therapy helps them to:

- Feel more in touch with their body and physical surroundings

- Address difficult feelings about their body or appearance

- Explore difficult experiences through movement rather than words

Find out more from theAssociation for Dance Movement Psychotherapy UK (ADMP UK).

The therapists were able to tell a lot from what you'd created. It helped open up topics for conversation. Or get a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions out of your head.

Dramatherapy involves using different types of drama and performance activities.

For example, you might invent characters, tell stories, play games or do mimes. You might also use puppets, masks or other objects. Not all activities will involve talking, and you don't need to have any acting skills or experience.

Some people find that dramatherapy helps them to:

- Express or resolve difficult thought or feelings

- Safely explore being playful and using their imagination

- Explore how mental health problems affect their body

Find out more from theBritish Association of Dramatherapists (BADth).

It allowed me to use my imagination for something positive.

Music therapy involves exploring music and sound. You don't need to have any musical knowledge or experience to do it. For example, you don't need to know how to play any instruments, read music or be a good singer.

Together with your therapist, you might listen to music or use different types of instruments to explore ways of communicating and expressing your feelings. Music therapists often provide instruments that are easy to use, such as cymbals, wood blocks or bells. Or you might use your voice to make sounds or sing.

There is no right or wrong way of using music to communicate your feelings. You and your therapist might make sounds together in a way that feels therapeutic for you.

Some people find that music therapy helps them to:

- Connect with their therapist and other people using music

- Communicate difficult thoughts or feelings

- Express themselves in new ways

Find out more from theBritish Association for Music Therapy (BAMT).

Producing music can untangle my thoughts and re-establish order.


## How are they regulated?


It's good practice for any therapist to be a member of a relevant professional body. This means they've signed up to meet professional standards. For some types of therapists, this is required.


### Regulation of art, drama and music therapists


Anyone who refers to themselves an art therapist, art psychotherapist, dramatherapist or music therapist must be registered with theHealth and Care Professions Council (HCPC). You can check if a therapist is registered using theHCPC's Check the Registerservice.

They must also belong to the professional body for their type of therapy:

- British Association of Art Therapists (BAAT)

- British Association of Dramatherapists (BADth)

- British Association for Music Therapy (BAMT)


### Regulation of dance movement psychotherapists


Dance movement psychotherapists aren't regulated by the HCPC, so aren't on their register. Dance movement psychotherapists are accredited by theAssociation for Dance Movement Psychotherapy UK (ADMP UK). The ADMP UK website has a register you can search.

I felt I was understood in a way no one else could. That is the thing with music, it feels like it understands what you are going through.


## How can I access arts and creative therapies?


Arts and creative therapies can be difficult to access. The services that are available often depend on where you live.

These are some ways that you may be able to access arts and creative therapies.

You may be able to access arts and creative therapies through the NHS as part of a mental health service. This could be in the community, or as part of your treatment if you spend time in hospital.

But whether this is available varies from area to area. Your GP orcommunity mental health team (CMHT)should be able to tell you what's available in your area. They may be able to refer you to a local service.

For more information about speaking to your GP, see our page ontalking to your GP.

Some charity sector organisations offer arts therapies. This sector is sometimes also called the voluntary sector or third sector.

Find out more about seeking support through the charity sector on ourfind a therapistpage.

You can also access arts therapies privately, although this can be expensive. You can find details of therapists in your area by searching the register of the professional body for each type of therapy:

- Art therapist finder (BAAT website)

- Dance therapist finder (ADMP UK website)

- Drama therapist finder (BADth website)

- Music therapist finder (BAMT website)

Or visit our page onfacing barriers to seeking helpif you're struggling to access the therapy you need.

Many people also find that doing creative activities on their own, or in groups as part of a hobby, helps their mental health. So finding ways to be creative without using a therapist can be a good way to support your wellbeing too.


## What if they don't work for me?


As with all treatments, different things work for different people at different times. If something hasn't worked for you, it's important not to blame yourself. While some people find arts and creative therapies helpful, not everyone does.
