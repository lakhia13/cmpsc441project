CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE

The Diagnosis of and Treatment 
 Recommendations for Anxiety Disorders 

Borwin Bandelow, Thomas Lichte, Sebastian Rudolf, Jörg Wiltink, Manfred E. Beutel

SUMMARY
Background: Anxiety disorders (panic disorder/agoraphobia, generalized 
anxiety disorder, social phobia, and specific phobias) are the most common 
mental illnesses. For example, the 12-month prevalence of panic disorder/
agoraphobia is 6%. 

Methods: This guideline is based on controlled trials of psychotherapy and 
pharmacotherapy, retrieved by a systematic search for original articles that 
were published up to 1 July 2013. Experts from 20 specialty societies and 
other organizations evaluated the evidence for each treatment option from all 
available randomized clinical trials and from a synthesis of the recommen-
dations of already existing international and German guidelines. 

Results: 403 randomized controlled trials were evaluated. It was concluded 
that anxiety disorders should be treated with psychotherapy, psychopharmaco-
logical drugs, or both. Response rates to initial treatment vary from 45% to 
65%. Cognitive behavioral therapy is supported by higher-level evidence than 
any other psychotherapeutic technique. Psychodynamic therapy is recom-
mended as a second-line treatment. Among anxiolytic drugs, the agents of first 
choice are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-
 norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The patient’s preference should be 
 considered in the choice of treatment. Drug treatment should be continued for 
6 to 12 months after remission. If psychotherapy or drug treatment is not 
 adequately effective, then the treatment should be switched to the other form, 
or to a combination of both.

Conclusion: The large amount of data now available from randomized 
 controlled trials permits the formulation of robust evidence-based recommen-
dations for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Future work should more closely 
address the necessary duration of psychotherapy and the efficacy of combined 
psychotherapy and drug treatment.

A nxiety  disorders  are  the  most  common  mental 

illnesses (1). Women are much more frequently 
than  men.  Specific  phobias,  with  a 
affected 
12-month  prevalence  of  10.3%,  are 
the  most 
 common  type  of  anxiety  disorder  (2),  although 
 persons  suffering  from  them  rarely  seek  treatment. 
The next most common type is panic disorder/agora-
phobia (6.0%), followed by social phobia (2.7%) and 
generalized  anxiety  disorder 
(2.2%).  Anxiety 
 disorders  have  not  become  more  common  in  recent 
years and decades (3, 4). They often arise in combi-
nation with other anxiety disorders, major depression, 
somatoform  disorders,  and  addictive  disorders  (5). 
They are now thought to originate from an interaction 
of psychosocial, genetic, and neurobiological  factors. 

The S3 guideline on anxiety disorders
The  S3  guideline  on  anxiety  disorders  (6)  is  avail-
able free of charge, in both short and long versions, 
on 
(in 
the  website  www.awmf.org/leitlinien 
 German).  S3  guidelines  are  required  to  meet  the 
 highest  qualitative  requirements  of  the  DELBI 
 criteria (7). This guideline was issued by 20 special-
ty societies and other organizations (eTable 1). It was 
created  over  the  period  2008–2014  by  a  guideline 
committee of 36 persons, including specialists, gen-
eral practitioners, and patient representatives (eTable 
2). After  ten  working  sessions,  the  final  text  of  the 
guideline  was  created  by  a  steering  committee  (B. 
Bandelow,  M.  Beutel, T.  Lichte,  S.  Rudolf)  and  put 
to a vote of the remaining participants in two consen-
sus  conferences.  Each  participating  group  had  one 
vote;  recommendations  were  accepted 
they 
 received at least 75% of all votes cast. The resulting 
guideline was presented to the boards of the partici-
pating  societies.  Professor  Ina  Kopp  of  the Associ-
ation  of  Scientific  Medical  Societies  in  Germany 
(Arbeitsgemeinschaft  der  wissenschaftlichen  medi-
zinischen  Fachgesellschaften,  AWMF)  assisted  in 
the  creation  of  the  guideline  and  moderated  all 
 working sessions and consensus conferences.

if 

This guideline, like other guidelines, is explicitly 
not intended to serve a regulatory function; it neither 
mandates  nor  forbids  anything.  Rather,  it  provides 
important  contextual 
individual 
treatment  decisions,  which  should  also  properly 
 depend  on  the  treating  person’s  experience  and  on 
the preference of the patient.

It  is  planned  that  this  guideline  will  be  dissemi-
nated  through  presentations  by  members  of  the 
guideline  committee  at  scientific  conferences  and  at 
continuing  medical  education  sessions,  and  by  pro-
viding  a  patient  version  (www.awmf.org/leitlinien). 
An update in 5 years is projected.

Because  of  the  large  number  of  clinical  trials 
evaluated  for  the  guideline,  references  will  not  be 
given  for  every  statement  in  this  article;  rather,  the 
reader is referred to the long version of the S3 guide-
line (in German only) for more information. 

Methods
Already  existing  guidelines  on  the  subject  were 
sought by electronic search. Guidelines meeting the 
specified  quality  criteria  were  selected  in  a  peer-
 review process (eTable 3). The guideline committee 
performed its own literature searches when discrep-
ancies between existing guidelines were found, when 
subject areas were not adequately covered, or when 
new trials potentially resulting in different evidence 
levels  were  found  to  have  been  published  since  the 
appearance of the reference guidelines. All available 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment 
of  anxiety  disorders  published  up  to  1  July  2013 
were examined. The inclusion criteria were: original 
publication  in  a  peer-reviewed  journal;  therapeutic 
trials of anxiety disorders defined according to ICD 
or  DSM  (panic  disorder/agoraphobia,  generalized 
anxiety disorder, social phobia, or specific phobia) in 
adults;  not  exclusively  subgroup  analysis;  use  of  a 
control group (for drug trials, a placebo or reference 
drug;  for  psychotherapy  trials,  a  waiting  list,  an 
 active  control  [i.e.,  a  supportive  conversation  with 
the  patient,  without  applying  specific  therapeutic 
techniques], or treatment as usual [TAU]); for drug trials, 
use of a commercially available and approved drug.

retrieved  by  this  search,  and  21  further  ones  were 
identified  by  a  manual  search.  Of  the  1317  publi-
cations  found  in  total,  1100  were  excluded  after 
screening of the titles and abstracts. The full texts of 
the  remaining  217  articles  were  obtained.  48  were 
excluded  because  they  met  specifically  defined  ex-
clusion  criteria  (e.g.,  double  publication,  subgroup 
analysis only, sample size <10 for each arm at study 
baseline,  and  lack  of  an  adequate  control  group, 
among others); 169 were included in the analysis. A 
similar  procedure  was  followed  for  the  remaining 
anxiety disorders (see the long version of the guide-

474 

line). Finally, a total of 403 RCTs were evaluated for 
the guideline. 

The quality of each trial was evaluated according 
to the criteria enunciated in the SIGN Statement (9). 
Methodological flaws led to the exclusion of trials or to 
downgrading of their evidence level. Common reasons 
for  downgrading  the  evidence  level  included  small 
sample size (particularly in non-inferiority compari-
sons), failure to state the primary efficacy measure, or 
respectively failure to apply a Bonferroni correction 
for  multiple  testing,  and  inappropriate  methods  of 
statistical analysis.

Decisions  to  base  guideline  recommendations  on 
the  results  of  RCTs  alone  have  often  met  with 
 criticism in the  past,  and,  indeed,  in  the case  of  the 
present  guideline,  this  decision  was  controversial 
within the guideline committee itself. It was pointed 
out that RCTs generally involve a selected group of 
patients:  patients  with  comorbidities  are  often  ex-
cluded, and suicidal patients are as a rule excluded. 
Yet an analysis of psychotherapy and drug trials evalu-
ated for the guideline did not indicate that these types 
of  treatment  differed  systematically  with  respect  to 
the  inclusion  of  comorbid  patients.  In  uncontrolled 
studies, it cannot be determined whether an observed 
improvement  was  due  to  the  treatment  itself  or  to 
spontaneous  remission,  tendency of regression to the 
mean, or non-specific attention effects; therefore, the 
guideline  committee  agreed  that  the  recommen-
dations should, essentially, be based on the results of 
RCTs.  Although,  according  to  the  protocol,  results 
from  open  studies,  case  series,  and  single  case  re-
ports  were  also  admissible,  there  was  no  concrete 
case in which a decision about an evidence level had 
to  be  made  on  the  basis  of  such  publications.  This 
was  due  to  the  lack  of  sufficiently  informative  non-
 randomized  studies,  and  the  sufficient  availability  of 
controlled trials.

While  the  evidence  categories  were  based  exclu -
sively  on  the  efficacy  of  the  various  treatments 
studied,  the  recommendation  grades  also  took  risks 
into account, e.g., drug adverse effects (eTable 4). 

the 

Diagnosis
In  Germany,  anxiety  disorders  are  evaluated  in  the 
outpatient and inpatient settings according to the 10th 
edition  of 
International  Classification  of 
 Diseases  in  its  German  modification  (ICD-10  GM) 
(10;  see  brief  description  in  Table  1).  In  primary 
care,  the  diagnosis  “mixed  anxiety  and  depressive 
disorder”  (ICD-10  F41.2)  is  often  made;  according 
to ICD-10, however, this diagnosis is impermissible 
if  either  anxiety  or  depression  is  severe  enough  to 
merit being diagnosed in itself. As no clinical trials 
have  been  conducted  on  the  treatment  of  this  entity 
according  to  its  proper,  restricted  definition,  the 
present  guideline  does  not  contain  any  recommen-
dations about its treatment. 

Anxiety  disorders  often  go  unrecognized,  partly 
because  patients  frequently  complain  of  pain,  sleep

Description

Diagnostic tips

Anxiety attacks of sudden onset, with physical manifestations of anxiety (palpita -
tions, irregular heartbeat, sweating, tremor, trembling, dry mouth, dyspnea; feeling 
of choking or of tightness in the throat; chest pain, pressure, or tightness; nausea 
or other abdominal discomfort; dizziness, unsteadiness, lightheadedness, or faint 
feelings; feeling of unreality, as if in a dream, or as if “not really there”; chills or hot 
flashes; numbness, paresthesia) and fear of losing control, going mad, losing 
consciousness, or dying. These panic attacks develop abruptly and reach a peak 
within 10 minutes. 

In agoraphobia with panic disorder, patients experience not only panic attacks as 
described above, but also fear of places where it might be difficult or embarrass -
ing to escape if a panic attack should occur. Such patients most commonly have 
panic attacks in crowds, on public transport, or in confined spaces (e.g., eleva-
tors). Fear of being alone is also common. Having an accompanying person on 
hand lessens anxiety. 

Patients suffer from somatic anxiety symptoms (tremor, palpitations, dizziness, 
nausea, muscle tension, etc.) as well as from difficulty concentrating, nervous-
ness, insomnia, and other psychic symptoms. They usually cannot say what, in 
particular, they are afraid of, yet they are plagued by constant worry, e.g., that they 
(or a relative) might have an accident or become ill. They also worry about being 
in a permanently worried state (“meta worries”).

Panic attacks can arise out of the blue; in 
the majority of cases, however, panic dis-
order is associated with agoraphobia. 

When a patient reports agoraphobia, the 
diagnosis of panic disorder should be 
considered.

In contrast to panic disorder, the physical 
manifestations of anxiety do not arise to-
gether in the form of an attack, but rather 
in shifting combinations, as a more or 
less permanent state. Patients with panic 
disorder fear for their own health; patients 
with generalized anxiety disorder worry 
more about the health of close persons or 
relatives. 

Social phobia 
F40.1

These patients are afraid of situations in which they are the center of attention – 
e.g., public speaking, visits to authorities, conversations with superiors on the job, 
or with persons of the opposite sex. They are afraid of appearing clumsy, embar -
assing themselves, or being judged negatively. 

In many cases, the affected persons are 
ashamed to discuss their social fears, 
with the result that the condition remains 
undiagnosed.

Specific (isolated) phobias 
F40.2

Such phobias are restricted to individual, circumscribed situations, often related to 
animals, or other natural phenomena (e.g., cats, blood, heights). 

Patients very rarely seek professional 
help for isolated phobias.

Mixed anxiety and depressive 
disorder 
F41.2

The simultaneous presence of anxiety and depression, with neither predomi -
nating. However, neither component is sufficiently severe to justify a diagnosis of 
 anxiety or depression in itself. 

If the criteria for both an anxiety disorder 
and major depression are fulfilled, both 
diagnoses should be made, rather than 
mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.

disturbances,  or  other  somatic  problems  as  their 
main symptom, rather than of the underlying anxiety 
(11). The  differential  diagnosis  of  anxiety  disorders 
must  include  other  common  mental  disorders,  such 
as  other  anxiety  disorders,  major  depression,  and 
 somatoform  disorders,  as  well  as  somatic  diseases 
such  as  coronary  heart  disease,  bronchial  asthma, 
and others (Table 2).

Health care provision
The  primary  care  physician  is  often  the  first  doctor 
contacted by the patient, and therefore plays a major 
role  in  its  care.  Some  15%  of  patients  remain 
 exclusively under the treatment of their primary care 
physicians  and  do  not  consult  a  specialist  (12). 
 Psychotherapy is provided by psychotherapists, who 
can be either physicians or certified psychologists in 
Germany.  If  the  symptoms  fail  to  improve  suffi-
ciently,  if  the  patient  becomes  suicidal,  or  if  other 
complications arise, the patient should be referred to 
a  psychiatrist.  Anxiety  disorders  can  usually  be 
treated on an outpatient basis. Indications for hospi-
talization include suicidality, lack of further options 

for outpatient management, very severe anxiety, and 
marked comorbidity. 

Treatment recommendations
The  accepted  indications  for  treatment  are:  the 
 presence  of  an  anxiety  disorder  as  defined  by 
ICD-10  GM,  moderate  to  severe  subjective  distress 
as  perceived  by  the  patient,  and  psychosocial 
 problems and other complications resulting from the 
anxiety  disorder  (e.g.,  substance  abuse).  The  treat-
ment  recommendations  are  summarized  in  Table  2 
(for a more detailed version, cf. Table 1 in the text of 
the guideline [in German]). Anxiety disorders can be 
treated  with  psychotherapy  and/or  drug  treatment 
and  other  interventions.  In  meta-analyses,  both  psy-
chotherapy  and  medication  have  been  found  to  have 
moderate to high effect sizes in pre–post comparisons 
and  in  comparisons  with  control  groups.  Response 
rates for the form of treatment initially chosen are in 
the range of 45% to 65%.

The treatment plan should be chosen after careful 
consideration  of  individual  factors  (the  patient’s 
preference,  previous  treatment  attempts,  severity,

the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder can be 
found in Bandelow et al. (2013) (13).

Psychotherapy 
The  large  number  of  RCTs  of  cognitive  behavioral 
therapy (CBT) carried out to date for each of the four 
types of anxiety disorder have documented the effi-
cacy of CBT in comparison to active controls and to 
waiting  lists.  CBT  should  be  based  on  empirically 
validated  treatment  protocols  (manuals).  Patients 
with avoidance behavior (e.g., agoraphobic patients) 
should  receive  CBT  with  exposure,  i.e.,  confronta-
tion with anxiety-inducing situations. Exposure ther-
apy  was  found  to  be  more  effective  when  the  patient 
was accompanied by the therapist (14). 

As  psychodynamic  methods  have  rarely  been  con-
sidered in previous guidelines due to a lack of studies, 
the  guideline  group  carried  out  an 
independent 
 literature search in order to integrate recently published 
studies  of  manualized  short-term  psychodynamic 
 therapy.  The  RCTs  on  psychodynamic  therapy  were 
markedly fewer in number, and lower in quality, than 
those  on  CBT,  and  some  comparison  studies  have 
shown  CBT  to  be  superior.  It  is  thus  recommended 
that  patients  with  panic  disorder/agoraphobia, 
 generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia should 
be  offered  psychodynamic  psychotherapy  if  CBT  is 

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2014; 111: 473−80 

ineffective  or  unavailable,  or  if  the  (adequately 
 informed)  patient  expresses  a  preference 
for 
 psychodynamic  treatment.  For  specific  phobias,  the 
available  studies  are  exclusively  of  behavioral 
 therapy,  which  should  be  performed  as  exposure 
treatment.

The current state of the data does not permit  any 
valid generalization about the necessary duration of 
psychotherapy,  as  most  trials  were  conducted  for 
periods of 10 to 24 weeks, and only a few of them in-
volved  a  comparison  of  the  efficacy  of  treatment 
when carried out for a shorter or longer time. The du-
ration  of  treatment  should  be  planned  individually 
depending  on  the  severity  of  illness,  comorbidities, 
and  the  overall  psychosocial  situation.  For  specific 
phobias,  the  available  studies  show  that  exposure 
treatment  can  be  performed  successfully  in  a  few 
sessions. 

techniques 

The  guideline  committee  also 

investigated 
 nontherapist-supported 
that  are  per -
formed  via  computer  or  over  the  Internet.  Many 
studies of such treatments have been published in the 
last  few  years,  but  there  is,  as  yet,  insufficient 
 evidence  to  conclude  that  they  are  as  effective  as 
 individual  CBT.  Moreover,  treatments  without  per-
sonal  contact  are  not  reimbursable  by  the  statutory 
health  insurance  carriers  in  Germany.  Medicolegal

problems can also arise (e.g., in case of suicidality), 
and  the  matter  of  data  privacy  has  not  yet  been  ad-
equately  addressed.  Patients  with  panic  disorder/
agoraphobia  can  be  offered  therapist-unsupported 
 interventions  based  on  CBT  and  involving  books, 
audio material, computers, or the Internet as a form 
of  self-help,  to  bridge  the  time  interval  before 
 therapy  is  scheduled  to  begin  or  as  adjunctive  treat-
ment  to face-to-face therapy.

Group  CBT  has  also  been  studied  in  randomized 
controlled trials, but there is still too little evidence to 
conclude that group CBT is as effective as individual 
treatment.  It  seems  reasonable,  however,  to  conduct 
self-assurance  training  in  groups,  e.g.,  for  patients 
with social phobia; in such cases, the treatment should 
involve  both  individual  and  group  therapy.  Offering 
group therapy is also justified if individual therapy is 
unavailable. 

The guideline committee found too little evidence 
to support any recommendation about other forms of 
psychotherapy  (applied  relaxation, 
interpersonal 
therapy, client-centered therapy, others). 

Pharmacotherapy
Grade  A  recommendations  were  issued  for  drugs 
from two categories: the selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors  (SSRI)  and  the  serotonin-norepinephrine 
reuptake  inhibitors  (SNRI).  Grade  B  recommen-
dations  were  issued  for  the  tricyclic  antidepressant 
clomipramine (for panic disorder) and for pregabalin 
(for generalized anxiety disorder). Benzodiazepines, 
though  effective,  should  not  be  prescribed,  as  they 
have  major  side  effects  (including  the  development 
of  dependence).  Only  in  exceptional  cases—e.g.,  in 
the setting of severe heart disease, contraindications 
for  the  standard  drugs,  suicidality,  and  other  situ-
ations—benzodiazepines can be given for short-term use 
after their risks and benefits have been carefully weighed.
Drug treatment should be conducted according to 
generally  accepted  medical  standards.  The  patient 
must  be  informed  about  adverse  effects,  possible 
 interactions,  contraindications,  and  warnings;  the 
prescriber  should  obtain  this  information  from  the 
current  summary  of  product  characteristics  for  the 
drug  in  question.  Patients  starting  treatment  with 
antidepressants  should  be  told  that  they  generally 
take effect after a latency period of about two weeks 
(range, 1 to 6 weeks).

SSRI  and  SNRI  have  a  relatively  flat  dose-
 response  curve,  i.e.,  about  75%  of  patients  respond 
to  the  initial  (low)  dose.  For  some  patients,  it  is 
 reasonable  to  begin  treatment  at  half  of  the  usually 
recommended dose. Dose adjustment may be neces -
sary  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic  function.  To 
prevent  agitation  and  insomnia  at  the  start  of  treat-
ment, the drug should be given in the morning or at 
midday.  Some  patients  will  need  doses  at  the  upper 
end of the indicated range and should be given them 
if  necessary.  Treatment  with  an  SSRI  or  an  SNRI 
should  be  continued  as  maintenance  therapy  at  the 

same  dose  that  was  successful  in  acute  treatment. 
Once remission has been achieved, pharmacotherapy 
should  be  continued  for  6  to  12  months,  or  even 
longer  if  drug  discontinuation  leads  to  recurrent 
anxiety,  if  the  anxiety  disorder  is  especially  severe, 
or  if  the  patient's  history  indicates  that  prolonged 
treatment may be needed. The dose should be slowly 
tapered  at  the  end  of  treatment  to  avoid  discontinu-
ation syndromes.

There is too little evidence to support any recom-

mendation for drug treatment for specific phobias. 

Combined psychotherapy and drug treatment, 
and the management of refractory anxiety 
There have been a number of comparative studies of 
psychotherapy, drug treatment, and a combination of 
both  in  the  treatment  of  panic  disorder;  most  have 
 indicated  that  a  combination  is  superior  to  mono -
therapy  of  either  type.  For  generalized  anxiety 
 disorder,  studies  of  this  type  are  lacking;  for  social 
phobia,  the  evidence  is  inconsistent.  No  study  indi-
cated  that  combination  therapy  was  worse.  If  either 
psychotherapy  or  drug  treatment  is  ineffective  in  an 
individual case, there should be a switch to the other 
type of treatment, or to a combination of the two. If 
there  is  no  response  to  the  first  drug  after  4  to  6 
weeks of treatment, a second standard drug should be 
given  instead.  In  case  of  a  partial  response,  raising 
the  dose  can  be  considered  first.  Table  3  contains  a 
stepwise  plan  for  drug  treatment  options  in  case  of 
drug inefficacy or intolerance. If a switch to a differ-
ent  standard  drug  is  unsuccessful,  there  can  be 
 another  switch  to  drugs  recommended  as  a  second-
line treatment, e.g., tricyclic antidepressants or preg-
abalin.  Medicolegal  issues  should  be  considered 
whenever drugs that have not been approved for the 
treatment of anxiety (e.g. quetiapine [in Europe]) are 
given off label. 

The treatment of anxiety disorders in older 
patients
The treatment of older patients has been studied only 
in generalized anxiety disorder, probably because the 
other  anxiety  disorders  are  less  commonly  seen  in 
older patients. The few available studies on CBT in 
persons  over  age  65  have  shown  a  lower  degree  of 
efficacy  than  in  adults  aged  18  to  65.  As  for  drug 
treatment in older patients, a few studies have shown 
efficacy for duloxetine, venlafaxine, pregabalin, and 
quetiapine.  In  older  patients,  possible  drug  interac-
tions  and  contraindications  must  be  considered 
 carefully,  along  with  the  following  additional  fac-
tors:  increased  sensitivity  to  anticholinergic  effects, 
the  increased  risk  of  orthostatic  hypotension  and 
ECG  changes,  the  increased  risk  of  falling,  and 
 possible paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines. 

Pregnancy and breastfeeding
For pregnant women, the risk of an untreated anxiety 
disorder must be weighed against the risk of damage 

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2014; 111: 473−80

to  the  unborn  child  as  a  result  of  treatment.  The 
physician  should  consider  whether  psychotherapy 
may be preferable to drug treatment for this reason. 
Some  authors  report  increased  risks  with  anti -
depressant  drugs  (15–17),  which  should,  therefore, 
be  given  with  caution.  Likewise,  a  risk  assessment 
has to be done when the patient is breast feeding. 

Exercise
Exercise  is  recommended  as  a  treatment  for  panic 
disorder  (aerobic  training,  e.g.,  jogging  5  km  three 
times a week). There is, however, too little evidence 
to  support  a  recommendation  for  exercise  as  mono-
therapy.  In  the  studies  performed  to  date,  exercise 
was  less  effective than  a drug  (18)  and no  more ef-
fective than relaxation as a control treatment (19). 

Self-help groups
Patients  should  be  informed  about  self-help  and 
family support groups and encouraged to participate 
if appropriate. 

KEY MESSAGES

● Anxiety disorders should be treated with psychotherapy, 

medication, or both. 

● Of all psychotherapeutic techniques, cognitive behavior -
al therapy is supported by the highest-level evidence. 
● Psychodynamic therapy is recommended as second-

line treatment. 

● The anxiolytic drugs of first choice are the selective 

 serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and the serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI). 

● If either psychotherapy or psychotropic drugs are inad-
equately effective, the treatment should be switched to 
the other form, or to a combination of both. 

Conflict of interest statement  
All participants in the creation of this guideline have declared their 
 conflicts of interest (e.g., having received lecture honoraria from drug 
companies or having been an advocate for a particular form of treatment). 
The guideline committee tried to base its recommendations exclusively on 
objective evaluation of the scientific evidence despite these potentially 
distorting influences. Participants with a relevant conflict of interest 
 abstained when recommendations were put to a vote. 

Prof. Bandelow has served as a paid consultant to Lilly, Lundbeck, Otsuka, 
and Pfizer and has received reimbursement of meeting participation fees 
and of travel and accommodation expenses from Pfizer and Servier. He 
has received honoraria for lectures at scientific meetings and continuing 
medical education events from AstraZeneca, Glaxo, Janssen, Lilly, Lund-
beck, Meiji-Seika, Otuska, Pfizer, and Servier. 

Prof. Beutel has received payment from Pfizer, Servier, and Boehringer-
 Ingelheim for preparing scientific meetings and continuing medical 
 education events.

Dr. Rudolf, Prof. Lichte, and PD Wiltink declare that no conflict of interest 
exists.

“Must not”: recommendation 
against the measure in question
 based on level Ia and Ib evidence.

“Should” recommendation: well-conducted clinical trials, other than RCTs, 
support the recommendation either directly (evidence levels II or III) or by 
extrapolation (evidence level I) if the studies do not directly address the 
subject in question.

“Should not”: recommendation 
against the measure in question
 based on level II and III evidence.

“May” recommendation: expert committee reports or expert opinion and/or 
clinical experience of recognized authorities  (evidence level IV) or extrapo-
lation from evidence of levels IIa, IIb, or III. This recommendation grade in-
dicates that no directly applicable clinical studies of sufficiently high quality 
are available for consideration.
