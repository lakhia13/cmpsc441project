Abstract

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe psychiatric condition that affects up to 2.7% of the population and is highly
linked to functional impairment and suicide. Despite its severity, there is a lack of knowledge about its pathophysiology. Studies
show genetic inﬂuence and childhood violence as factors that may contribute to the development of BPD; however, the
involvement of neuroinﬂammation in BPD remains poorly investigated. This article aimed to explore the pathophysiology of BPD
according to the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inﬂammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress substances
that exacerbate neuronal damage. Few articles have been published on this theme. They show that patients with BPD have a
lower level of BDNF and a higher level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-6 in peripheral blood, associated
with increased plasma levels of oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine.
Therefore, more research on the topic is needed, mainly with a pre-clinical and clinical focus.

Key words: Borderline personality disorder (BPD); Neuro-inﬂammation; BDNF; cytokines; Oxidative stress

Introduction

(BPD)

Borderline personality disorder

is a severe
psychiatric disorder that results in high suicide rates,
functional and occupational
impairment, and intensive
medical and psychiatric treatment, creating high social
costs (1). BPD involves rapid and intense emotional
ﬂuctuations,
inconsistent and unstable identity, and
troubled interpersonal
relationships (2). Two recent
studies suggest a prevalence of BPD of 0.7 to 1.2% and
0.7 to 2.7% in adults (3,4). However, in individuals with
psychiatric disorders (outpatient and in-hospital) BPD
varies from 15 to 28% (5). In psychiatric emergency units,
patients with BPD account for 10 to 15% of medical care
(6) and represent 6% of primary care medical appoint-
ments (7). Often, patients do not receive a proper BPD
diagnosis because they are not evaluated by a mental
health professional. Consequently, they are not referred to
the most appropriate treatments.

Although BPD is a public health problem,

there is
its pathophysiology. Some

a lack of knowledge about

studies suggest that mental disorders have an important
relationship to neurotrophin dysregulation (8), inﬂamma-
tory markers (9), and oxidative stress (10). There are
papers that show higher levels of some cytokines and
oxidative stress markers in psychotic patients (11),
anxious patients (12), bipolar patients (13), and attention
deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHA) patients (14).

A combination of factors inﬂuences the development of
BPD (15), including genetic heritability (16) and childhood
violence (17). Other variables include emotional abuse
and negligence (18), in addition to low parental care or
excessive mother care (19). These adversities inﬂuence
children’s development (20) and trigger stress response
(21). As stress is a risk and an aggravating factor for BPD,
being associated with systemic inﬂammation (13), inﬂam-
mation may also be a cause and a consequence of BPD.
Furthermore, it has been shown in animal models that,
in some brain regions, such as hippocampus, prefrontal
cortex, and amygdala, alterations in levels of brain

markers are related to development of mental disorders
(22), such as depression (23) and schizophrenia (24).

Considering that BPD is a disorder that causes intense
individual and family suffering, this paper intends to make
a narrative review about BPD and its relationship to neuro-
trophins, inﬂammatory markers, and oxidative stress.

Material and Methods

A literature search was conducted in Pubmed, Scielo,
and Cochrane databases. The timeframe for publications
was from 1960 to 2022 due to the lack of papers in the area.
The term ‘‘borderline personality disorder’’ was mandatory,
and the terms ‘‘oxidative stress’’, ‘‘neurotrophin’’, ‘‘inﬂam-
mation’’, ‘‘inﬂammatory cytokines’’, or ‘‘BDNF’’ were ﬂexible.
Papers in English language regarding clinical and experi-
mental approaches involving BPD, peripheral inﬂammatory
markers, oxidative stress, and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) composed the inclusion criteria (Table 1).
Studies on bipolar disorder as well as approaches that did
inﬂammatory biomarkers, oxidative
not provide data of
stress markers, and BDNF were excluded.

Neuroimmune mechanisms involved in BPD

Neurotrophins

Neurotrophins are molecules that provide neuron
survival and development, deﬁne cell and systemic
functions, and promote neuroplasticity (25,26). After the
the ﬁrst substance in 1950,
the neuronal
discovery of
growth factor (NGF) (27), other neurotrophin have been
identiﬁed, such as BDNF, neurotrophin-3 (NTF-3), and
neurotrophin-4 (NTF-4) (28). Each of
these molecules
links its structures to tropomyosin-related receptors TrkA,
TrkB, or TrkC (29).

Among them, BDNF is the best-studied molecule (30).
Its fundamental role in learning and memory processes
(31) and in cognitive and behavioral functions related to
personal mood are well known (8).

BDNF synthesis occurs with the help of a precursor
protein called proBDNF, which is stored in axons and
dendrites (32) and induces its proteolytic cleavage in intra-
or extracellular spaces (33,34). This produces a mature
molecule that may cause physiological changes. BDNF
binds to the TrkB receptor when in contact with neural
tissues, causing dimerization due to neuron depolariza-
tion, with calcium inﬂux through voltage-dependent
calcium channels or NMDA-type calcium-permeable
glutamate receptors, triggering intracellular signaling that
leads to DNA transcription and cell response.

In this way, damage to structural or functional neural
areas – such as amygdala (responsible for feelings such
as fear and arousal), hippocampus (responsible for
reward and learning comprehension), and orbitofrontal
cortex (responsible for decision making and reward
processing) – predisposes patients to the development

Braz J Med Biol Res | doi: 10.1590/1414-431X2023e12484

of psychiatric disorders (35). Indeed, BDNF concentration
changes in neural areas became an essential research
element on brain disorders due to high BDNF concentra-
tion and expression in the amygdala, hippocampus, and
brain cortex (22).

Central nervous system (CNS) BDNF levels can be
predicted by BDNF level in peripheral blood (36). This was
the difﬁculty to
an important discovery because of
measure BDNF in live human brains and because of the
BDNF capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier in its free
form (not bound to other substances or receptors) in either
direction (37). As the production of BDNF in cells other
than neurons and glial cells (38) is considered irrelevant,
measurement of BDNF levels in peripheral blood in
equivalent to BDNF levels in the CNS (39).

A study found decreased levels of BDNF in platelets of
24 BPD patients compared to 18 healthy control individ-
uals. In addition, this study compared 18 male patients
that did not use any antipsychotic drugs for one month
or any antidepressant medication for three weeks with
18 control group individuals (11 male patients) (40). In
contrast, another study found increased BDNF levels in
115 BPD outpatients compared to 52 healthy controls.
Of the BPD outpatients, 108 were female and 55 used
antidepressant drugs (41).

Those results strengthen the importance of

the
correlation between BDNF and BPD.
In addition, until
the writing of this paper, only 2 clinical articles were found
that correlated the dosing of BDNF in patients with BPD.

BPD and inﬂammatory cytokines

Another hypothesis that explains the pathophysiology
of BPD is related to neuroinﬂammatory processes that are
linked to the immune system itself. The immune system,
which is divided into an innate and an acquired system,
interprets changes in the environment to create appro-
priate responses, identifying substances and organisms
that are harmless or could be dangerous (42). The innate
system represents the ﬁrst line of defense and provides
a fast response and recruitment of defense cells using
cytokines and chemokines, which are the substrate of
inﬂammation. In contrast, the acquired immune system
can take up to 5 days to produce adequate responses.

Among various proteins produced to provide immune
protection, cytokines represent a broad group that may
the immune system – innate
be produced by cells of
(granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells,
and natural killer cytotoxic cells) or acquired (helper
T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and B cells) (43). Depending
on the response, they can produce an inﬂammatory or
anti-inﬂammatory response.

However, it was not until the discovery of techniques
that enabled cytokine detection in the 20th century, such
as ﬂow cytometry (44), that it was possible to investigate
psychiatric immunology and ﬁnd an association between
an imbalanced immune system, cytokines, and mental

decade. One of those ﬁndings described the correlation

these diseases seem to be related to several pathways,
including kynurenine (46).

In the CNS, the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway starts
with the conversion of
tryptophan into kynurenine by
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), IDO2, or trypto-
phan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Then, kynurenine can follow
two metabolic branches: one implicated in neuroprotection,
producing NMDA and a7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
antagonist or one related to neurotoxicity, with production of

lead to upregulation of
tryptophan-kynurenine pathway that generates neurotoxic
and pro-apoptotic catabolites, probably worsening BPD
symptoms.

The need for research on this area is evident, mainly
because there are only two published studies involving
cytokines in patients with BPD. The ﬁrst study included
12 female patients with BPD, without any medication for
inﬂammatory
8 weeks, showing an increased level of
cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-6 (49) compared to a
healthy group of 12 female individuals. The second study
included 38 female patients with BPD, 11 of which were
using serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) to treat nervous
bulimia or depression, and found increased levels of

TNF-a and IL-6 (50) compared to 22 healthy women.
These ﬁndings demonstrate the importance of under-
standing the link between BPD and inﬂammation.

BPD and oxidative stress

In the search for possible biomarkers for BPD
pathophysiology, the interaction between BPD and oxida-
tive stress was explored in this study. The topic has
gained importance in the ﬁelds of biochemistry, medicine
and life sciences (51).

The concept of oxidative stress was introduced to the
scientiﬁc community over 30 years ago (52). Oxidative
stress results from an imbalance between oxidant and
antioxidant chemical species, leading to a dysfunction of
redox signaling and cell physiology (53). Redox signaling
acts through reversible modiﬁcations on cysteine resi-
dues, induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
target proteins within kinase cascades,
ion channels,
apoptotic cascades, and phosphatases (54,55).

-), hydroxyl

However, ROS, which are by-products of aerobic
metabolism that include substances such as superoxide
radicals (OH-), and hydrogen
anion (O2
peroxide (H2O2), are no longer considered only sub-
stances that cause damage to lipids, carbohydrates,
proteins, and DNA (56). Now, they are also considered
signaling molecules (57) that are important in physiologi-
cal and biochemical processes of the human body.

Thus, it is not the presence of ROS, but its excess that
can cause irreversible and harmful chemical changes in
the body (57). As an example of this negative role, lipid
peroxidation, a reaction that results from the interaction of
ROS and lipids, produces malondialdehyde (MDA), a
biomarker of oxidative stress that is measured by reactions
with thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) (58). In animal and human
studies (59,60), TBARS have been used to evaluate levels
of oxidative stress. In addition, other substances that may
reﬂect oxidative stress level are glutathione (GSH) (61),
catalase, and superoxide dismutase (62).

ROS are produced mainly by mitochondria (63) and
may result from physiological processes or pathological
conditions. Despite the enzymatic and non-enzymatic
defense systems, ROS accumulation may occur and
the body, especially the
seriously affect some parts of
CNS, which is very dependent on oxygen. The dys-
regulation of redox signaling in the CNS leads to neuro-
degeneration and may contribute to neuropsychiatric
diseases (10).

Although it is already a consensus in the scientiﬁc
literature that changes in MDA and glutathione (GSH) (64)
are responsible for brain changes in some mental
disorders (65),
there are only 2 studies evaluating
oxidative stress in BPD. One of them included 43 BPD
patients (27 females, with a mean age of 36.3 years), and
found an increase in 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-
DG), the oxidized form of guanine, in peripheral blood,
which indicated a rise in oxidative stress (66).

Braz J Med Biol Res | doi: 10.1590/1414-431X2023e12484

The other study included 49 BPD patients (43 females
with mean age of 29.8 years) and aimed to analyze
oxidative and inﬂammatory responses and their correla-
tion with clinical ﬁndings. The results show a decrease in
antioxidant enzymes (catalase, dismutase, glutathione
peroxidase) and an increase in TBARS in BPD patients. In
addition, there was a rise in NFkB, iNOS, COX2, Keap1,
and NQO1 inﬂammatory factors and a decline in IkBa
levels in those patients (67). The patients had a mean of
17 years of BPD diagnosis, 34% used antipsychotic and
antiepileptic drugs, and more than 65% used antidepres-
sants and benzodiazepines.

Therefore, different oxidative stress patterns are
present
in BPD. The importance of such patterns for
pathophysiology still needs to be established by future
research. A possible explanation is that oxidative stress may
be induced by inﬂammatory response (62). As with BPD,
a condition that leads to high inﬂammatory markers, it is
understandable that oxidative stress can lead to an increase
in inﬂammatory markers in other pathologies. On the other
inﬂammation can be triggered or enhanced by
hand,
oxidative stress through activation of nuclear factor-kappa
B (NF-kB), which controls the expression of many genes,
including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), which are involved in pro-
inﬂammatory cytokine production (68). This bidirectional
connection between inﬂammation and oxidative stress may
be involved in BPD neurobiology (67).

Furthermore, prospective studies have shown that the
use of antioxidant compounds in mental disorders seems
to improve disease symptomatology (69,70). A recent
study of the Neuropsychopharmacology Laboratory of the
Federal University of Ceará (UFC) described that a-lipoic
acid, a powerful antioxidant with anti-inﬂammatory effects,
decreased lipid peroxidation levels and improved mea-
surements of psychopathology when used in 10 patients
with schizophrenia (71). This result suggests that oxida-
tive stress and inﬂammatory markers play an important
role in neural damage in BPD.

Conclusions

BPD is a health problem that has a signiﬁcant prev-
alence in the population. However, more research on its
pathophysiology is still needed to seek effective pharma-
cological treatments and reduce the stigma and dysfunc-
tion faced by patients.
The results of

this paper show that alterations in
BDNF, inﬂammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress are
still rarely studied in BPD, indicating that the search for
speciﬁc biomarkers and molecular pathways for
this
mental disorder are still in the very beginning.

Understanding the relationship between BPD, inﬂam-
mation, and oxidative stress may support future ﬁndings
on the use of antioxidants or anti-inﬂammatory agents as
adjuvants in the treatment of mental disorders.
