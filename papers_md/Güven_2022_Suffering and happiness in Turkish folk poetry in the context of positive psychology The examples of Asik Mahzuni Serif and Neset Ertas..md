The widespread adoption of positive psychology at the beginning of the century 
has fortified the scholarly foundations of “happiness.” Thus, researchers have 
focused on “happiness” rather than “suffering” in boosting the joy of life within 
positive psychology, aiming for individuals to achieve peace with themselves 
and society. With the developments in positive psychology, over recent years, 
the idea of integrating both positive and negative aspects of human nature to 
build a better life for oneself and others has contributed to the rise of second-
wave  positive  psychology  (PP  2.0).  The  present  study  aimed  to  explore 
suffering and happiness in Turkish folk culture through a sample of poems by 
Asik Mahzuni Serif and Neset Ertas. The study results indicated that suffering-
themed  concepts  were  mentioned  more  than  happiness-themed  concepts. 
Within the theme of suffering, the world was the most frequently mentioned 
concept  in  Mahzuni’s  works.  He  emphasizes  in  his  works  that  the  world  is 
the source of many sufferings. In Ertas’s poems, moreover, love was found to 
be the most frequently mentioned suffering-themed concept. Ertas considers 
love to be the most significant source of suffering. It was also determined that 
while separation is the least used concept in the theme of suffering in Mahzuni’s 
verses,  it  is  never  mentioned  in  Ertas’s  poems.  Other  concepts  pointing  to 
the  theme  of  suffering  are  poverty,  ignorance,  longing,  death,  and  slavery. 
We found that the theme of happiness is mentioned much less frequently than 
the  theme  of  suffering.  While  the  most  used  happiness-themed  concept  is 
misery/remedy, in Mahzuni’s words, love is cited in Ertas’s poems. Expressing 
the view that suffering can be an opportunity for people, Mahzuni emphasizes 
in his poems that people can grow by learning lessons from their suffering. 
Ertas,  moreover,  sees  love  as  the  most  important  source  of  happiness.  The 
other concepts referencing happiness in the poems were friend, mother, soft 
answer, and spring. Overall, the results suggest that suffering is an important 
source of building resilience, which, in turn, can produce happiness. People 
can grow with the help of the experience of suffering so that this experience 
can contribute to their flourishing.

1.  Introduction

The concept of positive psychology, which centers on positive 
character traits, strengths, and virtues and aims to contribute to the 
individual’s attainment of happiness, is not new. The notion that 
people may improve their flourishing has persisted through the 
centuries and across cultures. Thus, the background to the concept 
dates much further back. Throughout the ages, philosophers have 
always attempted to reveal the significance of a decent, virtuous, 
and  moral  life.  For  example,  Aristotle,  the  famous  Greek 
philosopher, also drew attention to the importance of noble life and 
emphasized happiness as the highest good for humanity (Taylor, 
2001). Maslow (1954) argued that psychology was a branch of 
science that had been successful in focusing on the adverse aspects 
of personality traits; however, it seemed to ignore the individual’s 
strengths  and  potential.  Approximately  40 years  after  Maslow 
emphasized  the  importance  of  an  individual’s  strengths  and 
potential,  Seligman  asserted  that  psychology  should  be  more 
involved  in  the  positive  aspects  of  human  nature  (Lopez  and 
Gallagher, 2011). Seligman argued that psychology had ignored its 
ultimate missions, such as curing mental disorders, identifying 
individuals’ abilities, and contributing to their enjoyment of a more 
productive  and  meaningful  life  (Linley,  2009).  Seligman  then 
called on psychologists to create a science of character and virtue 
that  would  nurture  the  best  in  people.  Shortly  after  this  call, 
he announced the development of positive psychology to offer 
people  a  robust  vision  of  life.  According  to  Seligman  and 
Csikszentmihalyi (2000), the fundamental task of psychology is 
not only to fix an individual’s undesirable states but also to work 
on their strengths and virtues (Sheldon and King, 2001).

Positive  psychology  is  also  the  scientific  study  of  optimal 
human functioning with the goal of understanding the factors and 
states that enable people and communities to thrive (Seligman and 
Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). From this perspective, many variables 
(e.g., optimism, hope, gratitude, social support, humor, creativity, 
forgiveness, and self-confidence) fall within the scope of positive 
psychology  (Lopez  and  Gallagher,  2011).  In  particular,  the 
widespread adoption of positive psychology at the beginning of the 
century has fortified the scholarly foundations of “happiness.” Thus, 
researchers  have  widely  focused  on  “happiness”  rather  than 
“suffering” in boosting the joy of life within positive psychology, 
aiming  for  individuals  to  achieve  peace  with  themselves  and 
society. With the recent developments in positive psychology, the 
idea of integrating both positive and negative aspects of human 
nature to build a better life for oneself and others has contributed 
to  the  rise  of  second-wave  positive  psychology  (PP  2.0;  Wong, 
2010, 2019). It not only focuses on life’s positive aspects but also 
welcomes its adverse aspects as a whole. In addition, focusing on 
both positive and negative psychological qualities and states will 
contribute more to the wellbeing of the individual and society, and 
such  a  focus  should  be  a  seminal  research  area  of  psychology 
(Lomas,  2016;  Arslan,  2019;  Yıldırım,  2019;  Burke  and  Arslan, 
2021;  Arslan  and  Wong,  2022).  As  such,  second-wave  positive 
psychology (PP 2.0) emphasizes that we may need to accept that 

life have negative aspects, as well as positive ones (Wong, 2010; 
Lomas, 2016).

1.1. Suffering and happiness in Turkish 
folk poetry in a cultural context

The  literature  features  a  plethora  of  studies  on  positive 
psychology that point out the importance of happiness (Diener, 
1984; Lyubomirsky, 2007). Diener (1984) defines happiness as 
experiencing frequent and intense emotions and life satisfaction. 
According  to  Michalos  (2008),  a  happy  person  is  one  who 
demonstrates less fear, hatred, tension, guilt, and anger but more 
energy and vitality; who is self-confident and emotionally stable, 
healthy, and fulfilling; who has a high social orientation, love, 
social relationships, an active lifestyle, and a meaningful job; and 
who  is  relatively  optimistic,  carefree,  and  present-oriented. 
While  positive  psychology  is  widely  about  happiness  and 
emotions, Wong’s PP 2.0 (Wong, 2019) has focused on suffering 
as  the  gateway  to  happiness  and  argued  that  happiness  is 
impossible  without  overcoming  the  dark  side  of  human  life 
(Wong,  2020).  Therefore,  second-wave  positive  psychology 
stresses the assumptions that suffering is necessary for happiness, 
and  enduring  happiness  or  flourishing  can  only  be  achieved 
through  the  dialectical 
integration  of  opposites  (Wong 
et al., 2021).

The meanings attributed to “suffering” and “happiness” may 
vary  by  culture,  and  PP  2.0  emphasizes  the  importance  of 
understanding the unique experience and expression of happiness 
in different cultures (Wong, 2011). For example, some cultures 
enjoy high levels of happiness despite being fraught with crime 
and  economic  difficulties  (Veenhoven,  2022),  which  may 
be because individuals adopt values, beliefs, feelings, thoughts, 
standards, schemas, and judgments for suffering or happiness 
through their cultures. In this sense, the analysis of culture may 
bring noteworthy contributions to explaining “happiness” and 
evaluating  individuals’  behaviors  and  personal  characteristics. 
The  impact  of  culture  on  individuals  is  often  visible  through 
values. Folk culture, an important indicator of culture, has an 
important function in maintaining social life through creating, 
nurturing, and transferring social values, judgments, beliefs, and 
thoughts to other generations. More specifically, folk poetry and 
songs in folk culture are more evident reflections of culture; thus, 
Turkish folk poetry embodies significant traces of Turkish culture. 
Folk poets often address society’s cultural characteristics in their 
verses; their poems sometimes express suffering and sometimes 
convey  happiness.  In  these  poems,  one  may  encounter 
deteriorations in the social structure due to neglect of science or 
elevated  injustice.  Folk  poetry  functions  as  a  mirror  of  both 
culture  and  society,  allowing  us  to  understand  the  social  and 
cultural structures of a specific period. This is also the case in 
Turkish  folk  poetry;  Turkish  folk  poets  sometimes  talk  about 
happiness with love and sometimes suffering due to longing for 
loved ones.

1.2. Purpose of the study

2.1. Validity and reliability of the study

The  present  study  attempted  to  trace  suffering  and 
happiness  in  Turkish  folk  poetry.  Accordingly,  poems  in 
Turkish folk poetry were investigated and interpreted based 
on the emerging schemas of “suffering” and “happiness” in the 
context of second-wave positive psychology. This study aimed 
to provide a further understanding of suffering and happiness 
in the Turkish folk culture through a sample of poems by Asik 
Mahzuni Serif and Neset Ertas. A total of 240 poems by Neset 
Ertas  were  extracted  from  Garip  Bulbul  Neset  Ertas  (Neset 
Ertas, A Lonely Nightingale; Parlak, 2013), while 144 poems 
by Asik Mahzuni Serif were taken from the book Iste Bizim 
Mahzuni  (Here  is  Our  Mahzuni;  Yağız,  1999).  However,  it 
should be noted that these poems may not correspond to the 
total number of works produced throughout the poets’ lives 
since they must have produced poems that have never been 
released. Almost all the verses of both poets are composed as 
folk songs. While the logic of traditional folk songs relies on 
anonymity, these poems were so popular and well known that 
nobody  thought  about  their  anonymity.  In  this  study,  the 
selected poems were coded and interpreted around suffering 
and  happiness  in  Turkish  culture.  Considering  that  the 
literature hosts no such comparative study seeking the traces 
of positive psychology in Turkish folk poetry, it can confidently 
be  asserted 
findings  will  bring  significant 
the 
contributions to the field.

2.  Method

The  research  employed  cultural  analysis,  a  qualitative 
research method. The aim of cultural analysis is to define and 
interpret the culture of a particular group of people within the 
concepts,  processes,  and  perceptions  pertaining  to  that 
culture. Thus, every detail about the target subject needs to 
be investigated in-depth. The data were collected using the 
document analysis technique, a data collection technique in 
qualitative research. In this regard, the researcher first went 
through the selected poems two times. The researcher then 
grouped the poems by their themes of suffering and happiness 
and determined the codes for each theme. This was used to 
generate the frequency of keywords related to suffering and 
happiness in the poems. Finally, the researcher interpreted the 
findings in light of the biographies of both poets and examined 
the extent to which the poems reflected the general attitudes 
and  opinions  of  society  through  the  previous  findings.  An 
effort was then made to infer cultural-specific implications 
about  suffering  and  happiness  from  the  themes  and  codes. 
Accordingly, the researcher collected 144 poems by Mahzuni 
and 240 poems by Ertas, determined the codes of the themes 
mentioned, and attempted to uncover how the poets addressed 
suffering and happiness in their poems.

To contribute to the reliability of the research, the researcher 
analyzed  the  data  two  times  at  a  specific  time  interval  (about 
3 months)  and  considered  the  compatibility  ratio  between  the 
themes and codes emerging in both analyses. Accordingly, the 
specified  ratio  was  calculated  to  be  0.94  using  the  formula 
suggested  by  Miles  and  Huberman  (2016).  Therefore,  it  can 
be  argued  that  the  analysis  performed  in  this  research  was 
highly reliable.

With regard to validity, the researcher considered credibility, 
transferability, dependability, and confirmability, as proposed by 
Lincoln and Guba (1986). In terms of credibility, the researcher 
reviewed the relevant literature and included the relevant findings 
in  section  1.  In  addition,  the  problem  situation  was  clearly 
presented to promote credibility. The research design and methods 
are explained in detail in section 2 to promote the transferability 
of the study. In addition, a detailed explanation of the data analysis 
process is believed to contribute to the transferability. The present 
study  clearly  describes  the  data  analysis  process  and  the  data 
obtained  through  the  themes  and  codes  to  improve  the 
dependability of the research. Finally, to ensure the confirmability 
of the research, the researchers collected the published poems by 
both poets and did not rely on the poets’ life stories and thoughts 
in their poems to determine the codes and themes.

3.  Results

In this study, suffering and happiness were sought in Turkish 
folk  poetry  in  the  context  of  positive  psychology,  with  the 
researcher analyzing 144 poems by Mahzuni and 240 poems by 
Ertas. The findings revealed that the poems by both poets mainly 
addressed concepts that would evoke suffering (f: 400) and that 
the  frequency  of  expressions  evoking  happiness  was  almost 
one-third of those prompting suffering (f: 139; Table 1).

3.1. Suffering in the poems of Mahzuni 
and Ertas

The results revealed that nine suffering-related concepts were 
used 400 times in total, 106 times by Mahzuni and 294 times by 
Ertas,  on  the  theme  of  suffering.  The  identified  concepts  are 
presented later.

3.1.1. The world

In the poems analyzed, the world is considered a temporary 
place  where  people  cannot  be  happy  and  are  always  worried. 
Accordingly, the world order is characterized by suffering. In fact, 
the world is such a place that only liars and bad people would 
be happy. Mahzuni and Ertas emphasize that the world is not a 
place of happiness but suffering.

Mahzuni uses “world” the most as a concept to evoke suffering 
(f: 35). According to him, it is a world of liars that hurts people. It 
is almost a cemetery and does not make him excited. He has never 
been happy in the world:

What they call the world is a cemetery
I do not know when it makes me happy
I’m a flower blooming in the vineyard of friendship
The wind of the ignorant makes me wither
(Dünya dedikleri mezarlık imiş
Bilmem ki ne zaman güldürür beni
Bir çiçeğim verdim dostluk bağında
Eser cahilin rüzgarı soldurur beni; Yağız, 1999, p. 99).

Do not disturb transitory life (world).
It cozily hangs out.
My tears are hidden to me
It goes watering the troubled and the carefree
(Dokunma keyfine yalan dünyanın
İpini eline dolamış gider
Gözlerim yaşı bana gizlidir
Dertliyi dertsizi sulamış gider; Yağız, 1999, p. 129).

My heart’s mourning never ends
What would I do with the world of the cruel?
Not as good as an ant
Those who lavish advice on me, oh dear!
(Bir zaman bitmiyor gönlümün yası
Neyleyim ki dünya kahpe dünyası
Bir karınca kadar yoktur faydası
Bol keseden öğüt verenler vah vah; Yağız, 1999, p. 95).

Ertas  also  uses  “world”  75  times  in  his  poems  to  imply 
suffering. Like Mahzuni, he states that the world is a lie, a place 
where people cannot be happy and cannot find love:

Oh! In this fake world.
I wanted to be happy but could not …
The love of my strange heart
I wanted to find it but could not …
(Ah şu yalancı dünyada
Gülem dedim, gülemedim
Garip gönlümün yarini
Bulam dedim, bulamadım; Parlak, 2013, p. 313).

This world is a realm in which humans are always aggrieved:

A lonely man, troubled in the world …
Set off upon drinking the poison of the suffering.
Unfortunately, he failed to find the way,
Confused on the way, leaving …
(Bir garip, dünyada derdin elinden
Derdin zehrini içmiş, gidiyor.
Ne çare ki, gidememiş yolundan
Kaybetmiş yolunu; şaşmış, gidiyor; Parlak, 2013, p. 350).

For Ertas, the world is temporary and a big lie. We suffer all 

the time and cannot be happy and laugh in this world.

Are you the only one bewailing your fate? (x2)
I could not be happy either in the fake world
Do you think me happy?
In the world stealing my life in vain
Oh! In the fake world (x2)
In the world pretending to smile at my face
(Hep sen mi yandın, hep sen mi yandın?
Ben de gülemedim yalan dünyada
Sen beni gönlünce mutlu mu sandın?
Ömrümü boş yere çalan dünyada.
Ah yalan dünyada, yalan dünyada.
Yalandan yüzüme gülen dünyada; Parlak, 2013, p. 431).

3.1.2. Poverty

For both poets, poverty is an apparent reason for human 
suffering since those without sufficient financial means would 
suffering, 
be 
and unhappiness.

state  of  deprivation, 

in  a  constant 

“Poverty” is mentioned 24 times in Mahzuni’s poems. In one 
of his poems, he states that some people are unfair to others, and 
that is why people become poorer:

Those cheating the poor of their rights never end
More than flesh and blood can bear
The brave is in need even of onions.
I do not know, should I burst it out or not?
(Yoksulun sırtından doyan doyana.
Bunu gören yürek nasıl dayana.
Yiğit muhtaç olmuş kuru soğana.
ilmem söylesem mi, söylemesem mi?; Yağız, 1999, p. 73).

Uttering that such injustices hurt people, the poet claims that 

the suffering would lead people to age:

Mahzuni Serif, kill your pain!
Sometimes, find your remedy in misery
Like Pir Sultans, the gallows
I do not know, should I get hanged on or not?
(Mahzunî Serif ’im dindir acını
Bazan acılardan al ilacını
Pir Sultanlar gibi darağacını
Bilmem boylasam mı, boylamasam mı?; Yağız, 1999, p. 73).

Ertas also includes “poverty” 13 times in his poems. He states 
that the rich are much more valued in society and that the poor 
are not cared for and are despised:

Oh, my lonely, suffering friend!
Why is not your spring or winter shadowless?
Do you have—they do not ask—bread to eat?
If you are rich, they say either Bey or Pasha
If you are poor, they say either Abdal or Cingan (Gypsy)!
(Ey garip gönüllüm, dertli yoldaşım
Niye belli değil baharın, kışın?
Var mıdır, sormazlar; ekmeğin, aşın
Zengin isen; ya Bey derler, ya Paşa
Fakir  isen;  ya  Abdal  derler,  ya  Cingan  hâşâ!;  Parlak,  2013, 
p. 389).

They do not say, “Who asks about his condition?”
They do not say, “He is low in the eyes of the ignorant.”
They do not say, “Who gives jobs to the lonely?”
If you are rich, they say either Bey or Pasha
If you are poor, they say either Abdal or Cingan (Gypsy)!
(Kim onun halını sormuş, demezler
Cahilin gözünde hormuş, demezler

Gariplere kim iş vermiş, demezler
Zengin isen; ya Bey derler, ya Paşa
Fakir  isen;  ya  Abdal  derler,  ya  Cingan  hâşâ!;  Parlak,  2013, 
p. 389).

3.1.3. Love

To love and be loved may be among the highest feelings one 
can experience in the world. However, when love is one-sided, the 
lover  can  suffer.  Thereby,  people  falling  in  love  are  likely  to 
confront all kinds of difficulties.

Mahzuni includes “love” 20 times in his poems. According to 

him, all kinds of troubles come to those falling in love:

I can no longer trust the tombstone
The act of God is mysterious
Do you know what happens to lovers?
If you are afraid, do not be Mahzunî again!
(Artık güvenemem mezar taşına
Akıl ermez şu Hüda’nın işine
Neler gelir Asikların başına
Korkarsan Mahzunî olma bir daha; Yağız, 1999, p. 67).

In another poem, he expresses suffering because of his love for 

a beautiful woman:

It is incomprehensible why God did this!
Do you know what happens to the braves?
I am burned of her moon face, crescent brow
Ah! My life is running out.
(Akıl ermez oldu neden işine,
Neler gelir yiğitlerin başına
Yandım mah (ay) yüzüne hilâl kaşına
Ah çektikçe ömrüm sökülmektedir; Yağız, 1999, p. 123).

In Ertas’s poems, the most frequently used concept that evokes 
suffering is “love.” He uses it 91 times in his poems and states that 
when love falls into one’s heart, it burns and ruins it.

Flames of love captured my lonely heart
This heart of mine is on fire, dear for you!
The arrow of suffering sank into my lonely heart
This heart of mine is bleeding, dear for you!
(Aşk ataşı düştü garip gönlüme
Yanıyor bu. gönlüm, yar senin için
Derdin oku battı garip gönlüme
Kanıyor bu. gönlüm yar senin için; Parlak, 2013, p. 323).

Ertas says that love blows the lover’s mind and that they will 

almost burn to ashes when falling in love:

Your love drove me crazy
Burned and turned me into ashes
Made me a slave to others

Oh dear, me!
(Aşkın beni del’eyledi
Yaktı, yaktı, kül eyledi
El âleme kul eyledi
Yar beni, beni beni; Parlak, 2013, p. 325).

3.1.4. Ignorance

Ignorance draws attention as a suffering-themed concept 
in both poets’ works. While Mahzuni says eight times in his 
poems that ignorance hurts people, Ertas uses it 10 times in 
his poems.

Mahzuni describes the impact of ignorance thus:

Ignorance blew my mind
And made me feel cheap
We have no place in the world
Hear us, father!
(Cehalet aklım uçurdu
Beni yerlere geçirdi
Yerimiz yoktur dünyada
Duy baba duy duy; Yağız, 1999, p. 64).

In one of his poems, Ertas emphasizes that ignorance is the 

source of all kinds of troubles and almost dehumanizes people:

Because of illiteracy
Ignorance comes out and spreads!
Because of lovelessness and disrespect
One gets tired of humanity!
(İlimsizlik, bilgisizlik yüzünden
Cehalet hortlayıp çıkar mı çıkar!
Sevgisizlik, saygısızlık yüzünden
İnsan, insanlıktan bıkar mı bıkar!; Parlak, 2013, p. 435).

3.1.5. Longing

Referring to the desire to see something, a person, or a place, 
longing is intertwined with suffering in folk poetry. A longing 
person  suffers  because  of  a  state  of  absence.  While  Mahzuni 
mentions “longing” seven times in his poems, it appears 65 times 
in Ertas’s poems.

Mahzuni expresses his longing for his village as follows:

Ertas also states in one of his poems that longing for his loved 

one hurts him:

Heart’s suffering, suffering for love
Longing is tough
One not suffering cannot know it
Ask the meaning of suffering to sufferers
(Gönül derdi, yar derdi
Hasret; yaman, zor deddi
Onu çekmeyen bilmez
Çekenlere sor, derdi; Parlak, 2013, p. 427).

3.1.6. Death

Acknowledged to be as natural in human life as birth, death does 
not  bring  happiness  to  people  as  much  as  birth.  Since  death  is 
conceived of as a kind of separation, poets consider it to be among 
those concepts that bring suffering. While “death” is mentioned three 
times in the poems by Mahzuni, it appears 10 times in Ertas’s poems.
Mahzuni  states  that  many  people  die  and  are  sent  to 

cemeteries every year, which makes one suffer in this world:

Oh, the cemetery full of flesh
Those coming to you never end
Damn, big world!
Those smashing each other never end
(Yürü bre bol mezarlık
Her yılda varan varana
Kahrolasın koca dünya
Birbirin kıran kırana; Yağız, 1999, p. 96).

Ertas  also  conveys  his  longing  for  his  father  in  his  poem 

dedicated to his father:

I’ve come a long way, for my longing
Where is my father, Muharrem?
Why does my wounded nightingale not make a sound?
Oh, my afflicted father; where is that Kerem (kindness)?
(Uzak yoldan geldim, hasretim için
Hani, nerde babam, Muharrem nerde
Yaralı bülbülüm ses vermez, niçin?
Yüreği yanığım, o Kerem nerde?; Parlak, 2013, p. 489).

Oh! I’ve pined for seeing you, Bercenek (Mahzuni’s village)
Oh! Foggy, foggy our lands
My tears have become full of ash
Oh! Foggy, foggy our lands
If I cry for them, they think I’m crazy
(Vay göresim geldi Berçenek seni
Dumanlı dumanlı oy bizim eller
Aktı gözüm yaşı oldu bir çanak
Dumanlı dumanlı oy bizim eller
Oturup ağlarsam delidir derler; Yağız, 1999, p. 64).

3.1.7. Slavery

Slavery also makes one suffer. While Mahzuni uses “slavery” 
five times in his poems, Ertas refers to this concept nine times in 
his works.

Stating that people have been suffering from slavery since the 
start  of  human  existence,  Mahzuni  emphasizes  his  rebellion 
against this situation as follows:

Are you descended from Adam or Noah?
My arm, where did you get this chain?

I was a man too in this world of the cruel
My arm, where did you get this chain?
(Adem’den mi geldin Nuh’tan mı kaldın?
Kolum nerden aldın sen bu. zinciri
Ben de bir adamdım kahpe dünyada
Kolum nerden aldın sen bu. zinciri?; Yağız, 1999, p. 93).

Ertas  also  states  that  he  lost  his  job,  friends,  and  freedom 

when imprisoned:

I outstayed my welcome in prisons
I lost my love, my friend
Are all my buddies mad at me?
Oh, prison! You burned me
I wish I got rid of the guard’s words
(Hapishanelere attım postumu
Kayıp ettim yârenimi, dostumu
Bütün ahbaplarım bana küstü mü?
Yandım mahpushane, senin elinden
Kurtulaydım gardiyanın dilinden; Parlak, 2013, p. 489).

3.1.8. Injustice

Injustice is among the conditions that hurt people. While one 
can identify it in four places in Mahzuni’s verses, Ertas does not 
use it in his works.

Mahzuni emphasizes that people are likely to suffer in the 

absence of a conscientious distinction between right and wrong:

Unless justice from the conscience
Unless the unjust is seen in the way of the Lord
Unless a deputy gets tired like a peasant
Neither bandit nor shepherd withers
(Vicdan adaleti kurulmadıkça
Haksız hak yolunda görülmedikçe
Mebus köylü gibi yorulmadıkça
Ne eşkıya biter, ne çoban biter; Yağız, 1999, p. 65).

3.1.9. Separation

Finally, this study addressed separation as a feeling that causes 
people to suffer. Despite its necessity from time to time, separation 
often  brings  sorrow  to  people.  While  it  is  not  included  in 
Mahzuni’s works, it appears 21 times in Ertas’s poems.
that  separation 

is  sorrowful  and 

Ertas  states 

that 

he experienced it many times:

The pain of separation
Have I suffered less (x2)?
Its smoldering fire
Have I suffered less (x2)?
(Ayrılığın acısını
Az mi çektim, az mı çektim
İçten içe sızışını
Az mı çektim, az mı çektim; Parlak, 2013, p. 328).

3.2. Happiness in the poems of Mahzuni 
and Ertas

The findings revealed that in both poets’ works, expressions 
implying  happiness  are  used  less  often  than  those  evoking 
suffering.  In  the  poems  analyzed,  the  researcher  identified  six 
themes  implying  happiness:  love,  friend,  mother,  soft  answer, 
spring, and misery/remedy. While these concepts are repeated 
seven times in Asik Mahzuni Serif ’s poems, they are found 132 
times in Ertas’s works.

3.2.1. Love

Love  may  be  considered  the  most  prominent  source  of 
happiness for people. While it is mentioned only two times in 
Mahzuni’s poems, it is included 89 times in Ertas’s works, the most 
frequently cited happiness-themed concept.

In one of his poems, Mahzuni says that life will be much more 

appealing when people love each other:

When two hearts become one
It will be a feast, a relief
When two hearts engage in one joy
It will be a feast, a relief
One sacrifices himself for his friend
(İki gönül bir olunca
Bayram olur seyran olur
İki gönül bir sevince
Bayram olur seyran olur
Bir dost dosta kurban olur; Yağız, 1999, p. 161).

Ertas describes how love makes him happy and how it causes 

changes to his body and soul:

I’ve crossed the garden wall
And knotted into ivy roses
I’ve kissed, loved, and said goodbye to my lover
Oh! I’m burning (x3)
I’m fallen into the rosebud
Persian shawl to her wasp waist
(Bahçe duvarından aştım
Sarmasik güllere dolaştım
Öptüm, sevdim, helalleştim
Yanıyorum, yanıyorum, yanıyorum hele
Mayil oldum gonca güle
Acem şalı, ince bele; Parlak, 2013, p. 334).

3.2.2. Friend

Friendship occupies a substantial place in life since humans 
are social beings. Having a reliable friend brings happiness and 
confidence.  While  mentioned  17  times  in  Ertas’s  poems,  this 
theme is not encountered in Mahzuni’s works.

Ertas states that having a friend brings happiness and removes 

worries and sorrows:

When sending regards to friends
When friends receive my greetings
When the lover smiles at me
Will there be suffering on Job’s skin, for God’s sake, hey!
(Dostlara selamı saldıktan keri
Dostlar selamımız aldıktan keri
Canan yüzümüze güldükten keri
Dert kalır mı Eyüp teninde, ya hu, dost, ya hü!; Parlak, 2013, 
p. 384).

3.2.3. Mother

The fact that maternal affection is often cited in the works of 
Turkish literature may indicate its significance. Maternal affection 
is known to be a source of happiness. While “mother” is mentioned 
14 times in Ertas’s poems, it is not mentioned in Mahzuni’s works.
Ertas  emphasizes  that  one’s  mother  is  a  great  source  of 

happiness and that she shines like the Sun:

You’re a match for hearts
You’re a love burning in hearts
You’re the Sun to hearts
You’re divine light, Mother (x2)
(Her gönüle bir eşsin sen
Kalpte yanan bir aşksın sen
Gönlümüze güneşsin sen
Nursun ana, nursun ana; Parlak, 2013, p. 361).

3.2.4. Soft answer

Fruitful human relations are attributed to kindness, delicacy, 
and  grace.  Many  cultures  even  have  a  proverb  saying,  “A  soft 
answer  turns  away  wrath.”  People  responding  politely  and 
elegantly may have an influence over others, which becomes a 
source of happiness for everyone engaged in such conversations. 
While “soft answer” is mentioned eight times in Ertas’s poems, 
Mahzuni does not refer to it in the poems analyzed.

Ertas states that a soft answer will sweeten the mouth like 
honey; that is, the kind and elegant speech will have a positive and 
pleasing effect on people:

A thousand and one tastes for tongues
All for humans
They say sweet, for honey
Nothing is sweeter than the lover
(Bin bir tat var. diller için
Hepsi de kullar için
Tatlı derler, ballar için
Yardan tatlısı bulunmaz; Parlak, 2013, p. 488).

3.2.5. Spring

Spring  is  the  season  of  revival  referring  to  happiness.  The 
blooming of flowers, the greening of trees, the warming of the 

weather,  and  the  waking  of  animals  from  their  hibernation  in 
spring often evoke the joys of life. While “spring” is included four 
times in Ertas’s poems, it is not mentioned in Mahzuni’s works.

Ertas notes that flowers bloom and rose scents spread when 
spring comes. He regards it as a season that makes people happy:

Spring has arrived; all kinds of flowers have bloomed
The rose in spring; how beautiful the rose is in spring
Buds have bloomed, roses are sprinkled
The rose in spring; how beautiful the rose is in spring
(Bahar gelmiş, türlü çiçek açılmış
Baharda gül, gül, baharda ne güzel
Açılmış goncalar, güller saçılmış
Baharda gül, gül, baharda ne güzel; Parlak, 2013, p. 332).

3.2.6. Misery/remedy

If an individual learns lessons from adverse conditions and 
grows  as  a  person,  they  will  be  able  to  cope  with  subsequent 
adverse  events.  Thus,  people  with  robust  traits  try  to  turn 
something  negative  in  their  favor  by  learning  from  past 
experiences. While “misery/remedy” is mentioned five times in 
Mahzuni’s works, it could not be found in Ertas’s poems.

Mahzuni emphasizes that people can sometimes learn from 

their miseries and use them to “cure” themselves:

Mahzuni Serif, kill your pain!
Sometimes, find your remedy in misery
Like Pir Sultans, the gallows
I do not know, should I get hanged on or not?
(Mahzuni Serif ’im dindir acını
Bazen acılardan al ilacını
Pir Sultanlar gibi darağacını
Bilmem boylasam mı, boylamasam mı?; Yağız, 1999, p. 73).

4.  Discussion

Recent developments in positive psychology have evolved into 
the  second  and  third  waves,  going  beyond  the  individual  and 
positive focus toward multi-cultures, complex systems, and the 
psychology of transcending suffering (Wong et al., 2022). Second-
wave positive psychology (PP 2.0) has, especially, emphasized the 
importance of suffering for growth and wellbeing (Wong et al., 
2021) and of understanding the expression of happiness in the 
cultural  context  (Wong,  2011).  In  addition,  PP  2.0  focuses  on 
suffering as the gateway to happiness (Wong, 2019) and underlines 
that happiness is impossible without overcoming the dark side of 
human life (Wong, 2020). Therefore, it is important to examine 
suffering and happiness in the cultural context to provide a better 
understanding of the association between these constructs. To this 
end, the present study aims to provide a further understanding of 
suffering and happiness in Turkish folk culture through a sample 
of poems by Asik Mahzuni Serif and Neset Ertas.

Poetry is a form of art that helps people to express feelings, 
thoughts,  and  suffering,  which  may  also  be  an  effective 
intervention for improving mental health and wellbeing (McArdle 
and Byrt, 2001; Tegnér et al., 2009). Although the mechanism by 
which happiness works remains elusive, cultures are known to 
exert  a  substantial  influence  on  the  attributions  of  happiness. 
Given that culture is an individual’s lifestyle in the simplest sense 
(Taylor, 1871), folk poetry may be among its integral features. 
Findings from this study have supported this notion, indicating 
that suffering is the gateway to happiness (Wong, 2019). Suffering 
is mentioned more than happiness in the poems. Consistent with 
the  second-wave  positive  psychology  approach  (Wong,  2011, 
2019),  the  results  have  suggested  that  suffering  is  essential  to 
establish  flourishing,  and  people  can  make  a  better  life  by 
accepting and overcoming suffering.

While  suffering  was  mentioned  400  times  in  the  poems, 
happiness appeared 139 times. The concepts clustered under the 
theme  of  suffering  were  identified  as  the  world,  poverty,  love, 
ignorance, longing, slavery, injustice, and separation. Of these, the 
world  was  cited  most  often  in  the  works  of  Mahzuni  (f:  35), 
although Ertas also used it extensively (f: 75). Both poets used the 
concept of the world in a social sense and state that the world is a 
painful place for people. Poverty was used more extensively in 
Mahzuni’s poems (f: 24) than in Ertas’s (f: 13). The same applied 
to injustice (f: 4 and 0, respectively). Although it might be thought 
that Mahzuni tends toward more social issues, similar frequencies 
of the use of ignorance (f: 8 and 10, respectively) and slavery (f: 5 
and 9, respectively) in both poets’ works imply that Ertas is not 
insensitive to social issues either. The poems also included the 
concepts of longing and death in relation to suffering. Finally, the 
concept of separation, which was not mentioned in Mahzuni’s 
works but used 21 times in Ertas’s poems, can also be considered 
an element leading to individual suffering. These results suggest 
that, in Turkish folk poetry, poets often reflect social troubles, 
sorrows, and happiness. While sometimes expressing misery in 
regard to disasters and adverse social events where people are 
harmed, folk poets also sometimes convey love through the arrival 
of spring and happiness in their poems.

Previous  research  on  Ertas’s  works  (Akgün,  2006;  Parlak, 
2013; Aktaş and Şimşek, 2014) has consistently reported that he is 
a poet of suffering and misery; it has always mentioned the cries 
of suffering in his poems called “Bozlak.” Mahzuni also mainly 
addresses  societal  problems,  troubles,  and  suffering.  For  this 
reason,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  concepts  of  ignorance, 
slavery, injustice, and poverty are more evident in both poets’ 
works in relation to the theme of suffering, a finding that overlaps 
with the views of Yağız (1999) and Parlak (2013). However, it is 
interesting  that  Mahzuni  rarely  adopted  happiness-oriented 
concepts in his works. While he used such images only seven 
times in his poems, they appear 132 in Ertas’s works. The most 
frequently used happiness-oriented concept in Ertas’s works was 
determined to be love (f: 89), but only two poems of Mahzuni 
included this concept. Moreover, the concepts of the friend (f: 
17), mother (f: 14), soft answer (f: 8), and spring (f: 4), which 

appeared in Ertas’s works, could not be found at all in Mahzuni’s 
poems. It can be concluded that Ertas adopted these concepts in 
relation to the poet himself. In addition, the concept of misery/
remedy was identified in the poems of Mahzuni but not in those 
of Ertas. From the perspective of positive psychology, Mahzuni 
emphasizes  that  suffering  is  a  cause  of  upsets  but  also  an 
important  source  of  building  resilience,  which,  in  turn,  can 
produce happiness. In other words, an individual can grow with 
the help of the experience of suffering so that that misery can 
become a remedy.

In  summary,  both  poets  extensively  used  the  suffering 
theme in their poems and paid less attention to the happiness 
theme.  This  may  be  due  to  both  poets’  adverse  experiences 
during their lifetime. Considering the Turkish cultural context, 
suffering  is  also  a  key  source  of  growth,  resilience,  and 
flourishing for human beings. According to both poets, life is 
short and temporary. In the world, we constantly witness all 
kinds of injustice, and we suffer because of what we go through. 
From this point of view, although the world seems not to be a 
place of happiness for either poet, we should persist in life with 
an attitude of love, consider negatives as an opportunity to grow, 
and try to realize ourselves since the negatives in this short life 
are all temporary.

5.  Conclusion  and  limitations

The present study aimed to explore suffering and happiness 
in the poems of two prominent representatives of Turkish folk 
poetry in the 21st century, Asik Mahzuni Serif and Neset Ertas, 
in  the  context  of  second-wave  positive  psychology. The  study 
results have first revealed that suffering is an inescapable part of 
human life and is widely utilized in Turkish folk poetry. Then, 
suffering  is  a  cause  of  upsets  but  also  an  important  source  of 
building resilience, which, in turn, can produce happiness. These 
findings suggest that suffering makes people stronger and better, 
and the best way to achieve durable happiness is to overcome 
suffering.  However,  further  research  needs  to  provide  a  deep 
understanding  of  the  relationship  between  suffering  and 
happiness in the cultural context. For instance, folk poetry as a 
therapeutic intervention may improve resilience and happiness, 
which, in turn, reduces suffering; however, randomized control 
studies are needed.

The results of this study should also be considered in light of 
some limitations. First, the study is limited to the data obtained 
from the poems of Mahzuni and Ertas. Therefore, future studies 
could be examined the poems by different poets in the Turkish 
culture  to  provide  a  deep  understanding  of  the  link  between 
poems  and  positive  psychology.  Furthermore,  research  might 
be provided comparisons with poets from other countries, other 
classes,  and  genders.  Next,  both  poets  are  considered 
contemporary  folk  poets;  therefore,  further  research  can 
be recommended to explore the poems by classical folk poets and 
to compare the results with those obtained in this research. In this

way, it may be convenient to identify the themes that dominate
