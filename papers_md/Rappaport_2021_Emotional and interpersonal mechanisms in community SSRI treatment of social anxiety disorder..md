Background: Affective and interpersonal behavioural patterns characteristic of social anxiety disorder show improvement during treat-
ment with serotonin agonists (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), commonly used in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. 
The present study sought to establish whether, during community psychopharmacological treatment of social anxiety disorder, changes 
in positive or negative affect and agreeable or quarrelsome behaviour mediate improvement in social anxiety symptom severity or follow 
from it. Methods: Adults diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (n = 48) recorded their interpersonal behaviour and affect naturalistically 
in an event-contingent recording procedure for 1-week periods before and during the first 4 months of treatment with paroxetine. Partici-
pants and treating psychiatrists assessed the severity of social anxiety symptoms monthly. A multivariate latent change score framework 
examined temporally lagged associations of change in affect and interpersonal behaviour with change in social anxiety symptom sever-
ity. Results: Elevated agreeable behaviour and positive affect predicted greater subsequent reduction in social anxiety symptom severity 
over the following month of treatment. Elevated negative affect, but not quarrelsome behaviour, predicted less subsequent reduction in 
symptom severity. Limitations: Limitations included limited assessment of extreme behaviour (e.g., violence) that may have precluded 
examining the efficacy of paroxetine because of the lack of a placebo control group. Conclusion: The present study suggests that inter-
personal behaviour and affect may be putative mechanisms of action for serotonergic treatment of social anxiety disorder. Prosocial be-
haviour and positive affect increase during serotonergic treatment of social anxiety disorder. Specifically, modulating agreeable behav-
iour, positive affect and negative affect in individuals’ daily lives may partially explain and refine clinical intervention.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia) describes 
a  syndrome  of  characteristic  physiologic,  affective,  cognitive 
and behavioural responses that reflect persistent anxiety related 
to  social  or  interpersonal  situations.  Within  the  cognitive– 
behavioural  formulation,  anticipation  and  interpretation  of 
negative  social  outcomes  contribute  to  elevated  anxiotypic 
physiologic and affective responses. For example, the diagnos­
tic criteria for social anxiety disorder describe fear that one will 
be  negatively  evaluated  in  social  interactions  with  others.1 
Through  limiting  social  interaction,  interpersonal  behaviours 
reduce  exposure  to  anticipated  negative  evaluation  and  may 
provide temporary relief from attendant social anxiety.2 Over 
time, persistent anxiety may lead individuals with social anx­
iety disorder to develop a greater sensitivity to anxiotypic re­
sponses,3  which  could  increase  avoidance  of  social  situations. 
However, interpersonal behaviour (e.g., quarrelsome behaviour) 

may beget negative responses (e.g., quarrelsome behaviour) 
from others.4 Thus, interpersonal behaviours that limit social 
interaction  may  also  increase  the  likelihood  of  negative  so­
cial outcomes, including feared negative social evaluation.

Serotonergic medications (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors  [SSRIs])  have  demonstrated  effectiveness  in  treat­
ing social anxiety disorder in adults5,6 and currently comprise 
first­line  pharmacological  treatment  for  social  anxiety  disor­
der.7,8 However, specific mechanisms by which SSRI medica­
tions ameliorate social anxiety disorder symptoms are largely 
unknown.  Consistent  with  broad  interest  in  mechanisms  of 
action,9  a  growing  body  of  research  examines  putative  bio­
logical, neural and psychological targets that may explain the 
anxiolytic  effects  of  SSRI  medications.10  Administration  of 
SSRIs  to  adults  with  social  anxiety  disorder  may  modulate 
specific  physiologic,  cognitive,  affective  and  interpersonal 
patterns that contribute to the maintenance of social anxiety 
disorder. For example, research with community adults and

modulation — such as through the administration of trypto­
phan,12,13  SSRIs14  or  selective  serotonin  and  norepinephrine 
reuptake  inhibitors15,16 —  is  associated  with  increased  com­
munal (e.g., agreeable) behaviour,17,18 increased dominant be­
haviour19 and decreased aggression.20

Two theories, the Social Interaction Model and the Cognitive 
Neuropsychological Model, implicate serotonergic regulation 
in cognitive, affective and interpersonal processes. Although 
they  identify  different  putative  mechanisms,  both  theories 
suggest  that  improvements  in  characteristic  cognitive,  affec­
tive or interpersonal processes may mediate and explain the 
well­documented  effectiveness  of  serotonergic  medications. 
As  proposed  by  Young  and  colleagues,21  the  Social  Interac­
tion  Model  suggests  that  serotonergic  medications  increase 
prosocial  behaviour  and  decrease  behavioural  variability, 
which subsequently improves the quality of a person’s inter­
personal  interactions  and  social  relationships.  Alternatively, 
the  Cognitive  Neuropsychological  Model,  proposed  by 
Harmer  and  colleagues,22,23  suggests  that  serotonergic  and 
norepinergic medications facilitate changes in cognitive pro­
cessing  (e.g.,  attention  and  memory),  ameliorating  deficits 
previously implicated in multiple anxiety disorders.

Existing  research  describes  psychological  (i.e.,  cognitive, 
affective, behavioural) and neural correlates of serotonergic 
pharmacotherapy, but further research is needed to identify 
whether  changes  in  psychological  function  follow  from  or 
precede and influence subsequent improvements. Statistical 
innovations can distinguish between these 2 scenarios. The 
latent  difference  score  (also  known  as  the  latent  change 
score)  framework  leverages  structural  equation  modelling 
to examine change over time and lagged associations of ab­
solute level and change in multiple processes over time.24,25 
For  example,  Hawley  and  colleagues26  used  a  latent  differ­
ence score model to find that higher monthly perfectionism 
predicted  less  subsequent  reduction  in  symptom  severity 
over  the  following  month  of  psychotherapy  for  major  de­
pressive disorder.

Extant research has been largely limited to self­report and 
laboratory­based  assessment  of  change  in  psychological 
processes.  Although  laboratory­based  assessment  is  well 
suited to the study of specific cognitive, affective and neural 
processes, examination of the social aspects of social anxiety 
disorder indicates the need  to clarify the naturalistic  mani­
festation  of  psychological  processes  in  individuals’  daily 
lives.  Ecological  momentary  assessment  and  related  meth­
odologies provide high temporal density assessments taken 
during  participants’  daily  lives.27  These  methodologies  are 
appropriate  for  clarifying  the  naturalistic  manifestation  of 
psychological processes in diverse real­world contexts rele­
vant to the interpersonal problems critical to social anxiety 
disorder.  For  example,  ecological  momentary  assessment 
research identified replicable dynamics of affect28 and inter­
personal  behaviour29  that  predict  later  functional  impair­
ment.30,31  Moreover,  temporal  patterns  derived  from 
ecologic al  momentary  assessments  provide  enhanced  reli­
ability32 and are not as influenced by traditional limitations 
of self­report, such as recall bias.33

The  present  study  presents  secondary  data  analysis  of  a 
study  that  demonstrated  improvement  in  specific  affective 
and  behavioural  patterns  characteristic of social anxiety dis­
order  (e.g.,  communal  behaviour)  during  pharmacological 
treatment as usual, namely during SSRI (i.e., paroxetine) ad­
ministration.34 Because SSRI medications are well established 
first­line  treatments  for  adult  social  anxiety  disorder,  the 
present study examines whether improvements in affect and 
communal  behaviour  precede  and  predict  later  improve­
ments in social anxiety symptom severity during community 
psychopharmacological treatment.

This study was conducted in Canada following the princi­
ples of the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Re-
search Involving Humans,35 which states that randomized clin­
ical trials with 2 or more treatment groups can be conducted 
only when there is equipoise or genuine uncertainty among 
experts regarding the relative effectiveness of each treatment. 
Previous  clinical  trials  have  demonstrated  the  efficacy  and 
 effectiveness  of  paroxetine  compared  to  placebo.  Therefore, 
there  is  no  equipoise  between  paroxetine  and  placebo  treat­
ment  groups;  the  inclusion  of  a  placebo  group  would  have 
been  inconsistent  with  the  Tri-Council  Policy  Statement. 
 Instead, paroxetine was administered in an open­label design 
with  no  placebo  or  control  condition.  In  the  present  study, 
rather than evaluating the clinical effectiveness of SSRI medi­
cations, paroxetine administration facilitated an examination 
of whether changes in affective and behavioural correlates of 
social  anxiety  disorder  mediated  improvement  in  symptom 
severity.

Methods

Participants

Participants  aged  20  to  60  years  (mean  ±  standard  deviation 
33.92 ± 11.49) were recruited from the Montreal metropolitan 
area via community advertisements for a study of social anx­
iety disorder. Of participants who called to express interest, 48 
provided  informed  consent  and  attended  a  baseline  assess­
ment, which  included a description  of the study and clinical 
assessment to establish the primary diagnosis of social anxiety 
disorder, baseline severity of social anxiety disorder, concur­
rent  diagnoses  and  suitability  for  treatment  with  paroxetine 
(Paxil).  Nine  participants  (18.75%)  withdrew  before  parox­
etine  administration.  The  39  participants  (19  [48.7%]  female) 
who began paroxetine administration approximated the edu­
cational  distribution  of  Montreal,  Quebec,36  although  psychi­
atric comorbidity was lower than expected.37 Baseline assess­
ment  (see  Measures)  indicated  severe  symptoms  of  social 
anxiety disorder38,39 and mild depressive symptoms based on 
the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale.40

Inclusion  criteria,  exclusion  criteria  and  demographic  de­
tails  about  the  sample  are  provided  in  Rappaport  and  col­
leagues.34 As reported in that paper, 31 participants (79.49%) 
completed baseline assessment and at least 3 months of treat­
ment.  Four  (8.33%)  discontinued  treatment  after  1  month; 
4 (8.33%) discontinued after 2 months. Compared to partici­
pants  who  started  paroxetine  administration,  withdrawal

Design and procedure

This  study  followed  an  open­label,  single­arm,  nonrandom­
ized, uncontrolled design that followed adults during the first 
4  months  of  psychopharmacological  treatment  as  usual  for 
 social anxiety disorder. Affect and communal behaviour were 
assessed using a measurement­burst design: participants com­
pleted  1  week  of  a  standardized  event­contingent  recording 
procedure at baseline (i.e., before initiating paroxetine admin­
istration) and after 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of treatment. Follow­
ing baseline assessment, to minimize potential adverse effects, 
study  psychiatrists  (G.P.  and  P.B.)  supervised  participants  in 
initiating paroxetine controlled­release (Paxil CR) titrated from 
12.5  mg/d  to  25  mg/d  according  to  each  participant’s  re­
sponse. Participants met with study psychiatrists monthly (i.e., 
at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks) to evaluate adverse effects and com­
plete clinician­ and participant­report assessments of the sever­
ity of social anxiety disorder symptoms. Participants provided 
informed consent before baseline assessment. This study was 
approved by the McGill University Research Ethics Board.

Event-contingent recording procedure
Participants  reported  on  their  affect  (positive  and  negative), 
interpersonal  behaviour  (agreeable,  quarrelsome,  dominant, 
submissive)  and  perception  of  the  behaviour  of  others  with 
whom they interacted.29 To minimize recall bias, participants 
completed a record immediately following substantial inter­
personal  interactions,  defined  as  interactions  lasting  longer 
than 5 minutes.

Measures

Clinical assessment
Psychiatric  diagnoses  were  evaluated  using  the  semistruc­
tured Mini­International Neuropsychiatric Interview version 
5,41  conducted  by  study  psychiatrists.  The  severity  of  social 
anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed dimension­
ally via clinician report on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale 
(LSAS)42 and via participant report on the Social Interaction–
Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS).43 On the 
LSAS, study psychiatrists rated participant fear/anxiety and 
avoidance  of  24  social  situations;  on  the  SIAS  and  SPS,  par­
ticipants endorsed agreement with 20 items reflecting anxiety 
in social situations (e.g., “When mixing socially, I am uncom­
fortable”). Two items in the SIAS were reverse­coded. Previ­
ous research has demonstrated the reliability and validity of 
the  LSAS,  SIAS  and  SPS,  including  reliability  at  each  time 
point for the present data.34

Affect
Participants recorded event­level positive and negative affect 
based on 9 items balanced for affective intensity.44 Items were 
averaged at each event to compute occasion­specific positive 
and  negative  affect.  Positive  and  negative  affect  were  then 

averaged  separately  over  events  within  each  measurement 
wave (i.e., within each monthly 1­week assessment) to com­
pute  the  average  positive  and  average  negative  affect  re­
ported by each participant at each assessment wave. Previous 
research  demonstrated  reliability  and  validity  in  ecological 
momentary assessment and event­contingent recording pro­
cedures  in  similar  community29  and  clinical  samples,45  in­
cluding the present study.34

Interpersonal behaviour
The present study conceptualized interpersonal behaviour ac­
cording to the interpersonal circumplex model, which organ­
izes the range of interpersonal behaviours on a biaxial system 
defined  by  orthogonal  dimensions  of  communal  (agreeable 
v. quarrelsome) and agentic (dominant v. submissive) behav­
iour. Participants reported their agreeable, quarrelsome, domi­
nant and submissive behaviours at each event by reporting on 
representative  behaviours  using  the  Social  Behaviour  Inven­
tory  (SBI;  e.g.,  “I  showed  sympathy”).29,46  Items  representing 
each of the 4 poles were summed and ipsatized at each event to 
adjust  for  each  participant’s  general  endorsement  tendency.47 
Similar to affect, agreeable behaviour and quarrelsome behav­
iour were averaged separately over events within each meas­
urement wave to compute the average agreeable and quarrel­
some  behaviour  reported  by  each  participant  at  each 
assessment  wave.  Agreeable  and  quarrelsome  behaviour  as­
sessments were then multiplied by 10 to enable computational 
modelling.  Within  an  event­contingent  recording  procedure, 
the SBI has demonstrated strong psychometric properties,29 in­
cluding agreement with observer report of participant behav­
iour,48 suitability for use in clinical samples49 and sensitivity to 
change during pharmacological intervention.12,34

Data analysis

Data analysis followed 3 steps to build bivariate latent change 
score  models,  which  evaluate  time­lagged  associations  of 
 affect  and  communal  behaviour  with  later  change  in  social 
anxiety  severity.24,25  First,  we  developed  a  measurement 
model  for  social  anxiety  symptom  severity  and  extracted 
 latent social anxiety severity from a factor model as indicated 
by monthly clinician­ and participant­report assessments (see 
Appendix 1, Table S1, available at jpn.ca/190164­a1). Second, 
we  fit  separate  latent  change  score  models  to  each  construct 
(e.g., mean positive affect) to examine change in social anxiety 
severity,  agreeable  and  quarrelsome  behaviour,  and  positive 
and negative affect over time. Each latent change score model 
followed the dual­change score framework to partition linear 
change over time from proportional change over each month 
of  pharmacological  treatment.25  Within  each  latent  change 
score  model,  we  found  no  statistical  evidence  of  phi  (ϕ; 
p values > 0.10), which assesses whether early change in each 
process  (e.g.,  from  baseline  to  month  1)  predicts  the  magni­
tude  of  later  change  (e.g.,  from  month  1  to  month  2).  Subse­
quent analyses were conducted without ϕ paths.

Finally, in separate models, we combined the latent change 
score model describing change in social anxiety severity with 
that  describing  change  in  agreeable  behaviour,  quarrelsome

the approach developed by Grimm and colleagues,24 4 bivari­
ate latent change score models evaluated time­lagged associa­
tions  of  affect  and  communal  behaviour  with  previous  and 
subsequent change in social anxiety severity. The resulting bi­
variate  latent  change  score  models  examined  whether  the 
level  of  each  affective  or  interpersonal  process  (e.g.,  mean 
positive affect) predicted subsequent change in social anxiety 
severity. These models simultaneously examined whether the 
change in each process predicted subsequent change in social 
anxiety  severity.  In  both  cases,  the  bivariate  latent  change 
score model adjusted for  linear and nonlinear change across 
time.  Importantly,  the  bivariate  latent  change  score  model 
represented both variables together and allowed for recipro­
cal  influence.  Thus,  the  bivariate  latent  change  score  models 
also examined and adjusted for the alternative possibility that 
the level of, or change in, social anxiety severity may predict 
subsequent change in each process (e.g., mean positive affect).
Given  the  large  number  of  bivariate  latent  change  score 
models  under  consideration,  the  present  study  limited 
exam ination  to  affect  and  communal  (i.e.,  agreeable  and 
quarrelsome) behaviour, which extant evidence implicates in 
the pharmacological treatment of social anxiety disorder.10,21 
Relative to change from baseline to 12 weeks, there was little 
additional  change  in  affect,  communal  behaviour  or  social 
anxiety  severity  from  12  to  16  weeks  of  treatment.34  There­
fore,  to  examine  temporal  patterns  of  change,  the  present 
study  analyzed  only  data  collected  before  the  final  assess­
ment in week 16.

Analyses  were  conducted  in  R  version  3.5.250  using  the 
ggplot251 and OpenMx packages.52 Structural equation mod­
elling estimation used full information maximum likelihood, 
which  is  robust  to  data  missing  at,  or  conditionally  at,  ran­
dom.53  Because  of  model  complexity,  confidence  intervals  
(CIs) were estimated using bootstrapping.

Ethical standards

The  authors  assert  that  all  procedures  contributing  to  this 
work  comply  with  the  ethical  standards  of  the  relevant 
 national  and  institutional  committees  on  human  experi­

 revised in 2008.

Results

Change in affect, communal behaviour and social anxiety 
symptom severity

Over  time,  participants  demonstrated  increased  mean  posi­
tive  affect  and  agreeable  behaviour,  along  with  decreased 
mean negative affect, quarrelsome behaviour and social anx­
iety symptom severity (see Table 1 for descriptive data, and 
Table 2 and Fig. 1 for change described by each latent change 
score model). Improvements in symptom severity, affect and 
interpersonal  behaviour  were  consistent  with  previous 
evidence  from  multilevel,  mixed­effects  growth  curve  and 
location­scale  analyses.34  Including  latent  social  anxiety 
severity,  all  5  individual  latent  change  models  indicated 
good or adequate fit to the data (Table 2). For all 4 models of 
affect  and  communal  behaviour,  strict  measurement  invari­
ance  was  confirmed  by  nonsignificant  increases  in  the  log­
likelihood  when  constraining  all  residual  variances  to  be 
equal across time (p > 0.13); see Appendix 1 for information 
on time invariance of social anxiety severity). Parameter esti­
mates (Table 2) and expected means (Fig. 1) represented each 
latent change score model of best fit (i.e., with no ϕ paths and 
time invariant residual variances).

Association of change in affect and communal behaviour 
with change in social anxiety symptom severity

Having  clarified  the  models  of  best  fit  for  change  in  affect, 
communal  behaviour  and  social  anxiety  severity,  we  used 
 bivariate latent change score models to examine time­lagged 
associations of change in social anxiety severity with levels of 
and  change  in  positive  affect,  negative  affect,  agreeable  be­
haviour and quarrelsome behaviour (Fig. 2). All 4 models fit 
the data well or adequately (Table 3). Three of the 4 models 
indicated  that  improvements  in  affect  and  agreeable  behav­
iour  preceded  and  predicted  subsequent  improvements  in 
social  anxiety  severity.  Higher  levels  of  positive  affect  (B  = 
−1.41, 95% CI −3.84 to −0.31; p = 0.009) and agreeable behav­
iour  (B  =  −2.16,  95%  CI  −7.66  to  −0.29;  p  =  0.001)  predicted 
greater  subsequent  reduction  in  social  anxiety  severity  over 
each  following  month.  Similarly,  higher  levels  of  negative 
 affect  (B  =  1.31,  95%  CI  0.45  to  3.87;  p  <0.001),  but  not

Fig. 2: Example of a bivariate latent change score model. This model was run 4 separate times to examine the association of change in 
social  anxiety  severity  with  change  in  positive  affect,  negative  affect,  agreeable  behaviour  and  quarrelsome  behaviour,  which 
were  entered  in  the  observed  variables  ot0,  ot1,  ot2  and  ot3.  Solid  lines  indicate  estimated  paths;  dotted  lines  indicate  paths  fixed  at  1; 
a indicates time-invariant regression of change in social anxiety severity on prior level of the psychological process; b indicates time-
invariant regression of change in the psychological process on prior level of social anxiety severity; c indicates regression of change in 
social anxiety severity on prior change in the psychological process; d indicates regression of change in the psychological process on 
prior  change  in  social  anxiety  severity.  A  time-invariant  covariance  was  estimated  between  concurrent  measures  of  the  psycho-
logical process and social anxiety severity (e.g., ot1 with at1). ∆ = change; B0 = intercept for the psychological process modelled; B1 = 
linear slope for the psychological process modelled; B0sa = intercept for social anxiety severity; B1sa = linear slope for social anxiety 
severity; o = one of the 4 psychological processes (e.g., positive affect); sa = the factor score for latent social anxiety severity (see Data 
Analysis);  sanx  =  social  anxiety;  t0  =  baseline;  t1  =  4  weeks  after  treatment  initiation;  t2  =  8  weeks  after  treatment  initiation;  t3  = 
12 weeks after treatment initiation.

Psychological treatment mechanisms 
 quarrelsome behaviour (B = 3.70, 95% CI −3.38 to 14.57;  p = 
0.18),  predicted  less  subsequent  reduction  in  social  anxiety 
severity over each following month.

Despite  limited  power,  we  found  no  evidence  that  level  of 
or change in social anxiety symptom severity predicted subse­
quent  change  in  positive  affect  or  communal  behaviour  (p  > 
0.35).  Notwithstanding  possible  α  inflation  due  to  multiple 
testing,  higher  levels  of  social  anxiety  severity  —  but  not 
change  in  social  anxiety  severity  (p  =  0.11)  —  may  predict 
greater subsequent reduction in negative affect (B = −0.23, 95% 
CI −0.90 to 0.08; p = 0.03). Similarly, we found no evidence that 
change in affect or communal behaviour predicted subsequent 
change in social anxiety severity (p > 0.23). After adjusting for 
temporally lagged associations, we found no evidence of con­
current  correlations  of  social  anxiety  symptom  severity  with 
affect or communal behaviour at baseline (p > 0.06) or of cor­
related linear change over the course of treatment (p > 0.09).

Discussion

The  present  study  documents  increased  positive  affect  and 
agreeable  behaviour,  along  with  decreased  negative  affect 
and  quarrelsome  behaviour,  in  the  daily  lives  of  adults  re­
ceiving SSRI treatment (i.e., paroxetine) for social anxiety dis­
order. Moreover, in 3 of 4 models tested, improvements in af­
fect and agreeable behaviour preceded and predicted greater 
subsequent  reduction  of  social  anxiety  symptom  severity  as 
reported by participants and their treating psychiatrists.

Evidence that improved agreeable behaviour predicts sub­
sequent  clinical  improvement  is  consistent  with  the  Social 
 Interaction Model. For example, extant evidence also demon­
strates that serotonin modulation via administration of tryp­
tophan12  or  SSRI  medication18  increases  prosocial  behav­
iour14–16  and  reduces  behavioural  variability,54  including  in 
the  present  study.34  Similarly,  evidence  that  increased  posi­
tive  and  decreased  negative  affect  predicts  subsequent  clin­
ical  improvement  is  consistent  with  the  Cognitive  Neuro­
psychological  Model.  For  example,  extant  evidence  also 
demonstrates  that  among  healthy  volunteers55  and  individ­
uals  with  a  depressive  disorder,56  administration  of  sero­
tonergic medications may increase face emotion recognition, 
which  is  also  implicated  in  the  etiology  of  neuroticism  and 
depressive disorders.57,58 Emerging research further indicates 
potential neural correlates of SSRI administration, which may 
reflect normalization of aberrant pretreatment activity.59 The 
present  results  provide  an  important  extension  of  previous 
research  to  demonstrate  that,  during  standard  psychophar­
macological  treatment,  improvements  in  affect  and  com­
munal behaviour precede and predict subsequent clinical im­
provement in social anxiety severity as assessed by both the 
patient and the clinician.

By assessing affect and communal behaviour naturalis tically 
in  an  event­contingent  recording  design,  improvements  in 
 affect  and  communal  behaviour  represented  changes  mani­
fested in participants’ daily lives. Increased agreeable and de­
creased  quarrelsome  behaviour  may  facilitate  positive  social 
encounters  by  disrupting  a  cycle  of  interpersonal  problems 
that may maintain social anxiety disorder.60 By demonstrating 

putative  psychological  targets  for  pharmacological  treatment 
as usual of social anxiety disorder, the present data encourage 
further research into the psychobiological mechanisms under­
lying pharmacological and psychological interventions.

Limitations

The  present  results  warrant  consideration  in  light  of  several 
limitations,  which  should  be  addressed  in  future  research. 
The SBI assesses the range of behaviours typical in interper­
sonal  interactions  of  community  adults.46  Although  it  has 
been well validated in community29 and clinical samples,45 in­
cluding among individuals with social anxiety disorder,49 the 
SBI does not include rarer, clinically relevant behaviours. For 
example, given evidence implicating serotonergic dysregula­
tion  in  aggression,20  future  research  is  needed  to  examine 
changes in interpersonal aggression that is more severe than 
quarrelsome behaviour.

The present study also provides an initial examination into 
whether  affective  and  interpersonal  changes  precede  or  fol­
low from improvements in social anxiety symptom severity. 
Given  the  relatively  small  sample  size,  evident  statistically 
significant  results  in  3  of  4  models  illustrate  the  strength  of 
the  associations  documented  here.  Future  research  with  a 
larger sample is necessary to fully rule out an alternative ex­
planation  that  social  anxiety  severity  may  also  predict  latter 
change in affect or communal behaviour.

Finally, consideration of ethical research practice — specif­
ically the principle of equipoise — prevented the inclusion of 
a placebo control group, randomization and clinical blinding. 
Future  research  is  needed  to  evaluate  alternative  explana­
tions, such as the beneficial impact of clinical attention or re­
flecting  on  one’s  affect  and  interpersonal  behaviour.  How­
ever, previous research with community adults demonstrates 
that  mean  affect  and  interpersonal  behaviour  are  highly 
 stable over multiple weeks.29,46 High stability over time sug­
gests that the event­contingent recording procedure may not 
substantially bias participant report.

Conclusion

The  present  study  extends  previous  evidence  of  increased 
prosocial  behaviour,  increased  positive  affect  and  reduced 
negative  affect  following  serotonin  modulation  with  SSRI 
medication. Specifically, the present study demonstrates that 
during treatment as usual with paroxetine, improvements in 
affect and agreeable behaviour in participants’ daily lives tem­
porally  precede  and  predict  subsequent  reduction  in  social 
anxiety  symptom  severity.  Although  it  is  preliminary,  evi­
dence  that  affective  and  interpersonal  changes  mediate  clin­
ical improvement during pharmacological treatment as usual 
encourages  further  research  to  examine  affect  and  interper­
sonal behaviour as putative mechanisms of action to partially 
explain and refine the treatment of social anxiety disorder.
