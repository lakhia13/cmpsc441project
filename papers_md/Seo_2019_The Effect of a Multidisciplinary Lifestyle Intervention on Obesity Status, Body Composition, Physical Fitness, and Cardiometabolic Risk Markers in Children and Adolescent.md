Abstract: This study aimed to develop a multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention program targeted
at children and adolescents with moderate to severe obesity, and assess the additional effects of
exercise intervention when compared to usual care. Overall, the 103 enrolled participants were
≥85th percentile of age and sex-speciﬁc body mass index (BMI). Participants were divided into
groups that received 16 weeks of either usual care or exercise intervention. The BMI z-score of
the overall completers decreased by about 0.05 after the 16-week intervention (p = 0.02). After the
intervention, only the exercise group had a signiﬁcantly lower BMI z-score than the baseline score by
about 0.1 (p = 0.03), but no signiﬁcant group by time interaction effects were observed. At the 16-week
follow-up, signiﬁcant group by time interaction effects were observed in percentage body fat (%BF)
(β = −1.52, 95%CI = −2.58–−0.45), lean body mass (LM) (β = 1.20, 95%CI = 0.12–2.29), diastolic
blood pressure (β = −5.24, 95%CI = −9.66–−0.83), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (β = −1.67,
95%CI = −2.77–−1.01), and wall sit test score (β = 50.74, 95%CI = 32.30–69.18). We developed
a moderate-intensity intervention program that can be sustained in the real-world setting and is
practically applicable to both moderate and severe obesity. After interventions, the exercise group
had lower %BF and cardiometabolic risk markers, and higher LM and leg muscle strength compared
to the usual care group.

1. Introduction

Over the past few decades, the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents has increased
worldwide [1–3]. Children and adolescents with obesity are at high risk of transitioning to adult
obesity [4]. Previous studies have found that obesity in childhood and adolescence increases the
incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as hypertension

(HTN), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidemia (DL), and arteriosclerosis in adulthood [5,6],
and also increases the risk of CVD in childhood and adolescence [7].

Particularly in childhood and adolescence, as the prevalence of obesity increases, the prevalence
of severe obesity also increases in westernized countries [1,2,8]. In Korea, according to the statistical
analysis of a sample of student health examination data in 2016, the obesity rate of elementary, middle,
and high school students increased from 11.6% in 2007 to 16.5% in 2016, and the severe obesity rate has
more than doubled in 10 years, from 0.8% in 2007 to 1.9% in 2016 [9]. When compared to obese children,
children with severe obesity are at greater risk of adult obesity, early atherosclerosis, HTN, T2DM,
DL, MetS, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, fatty liver disease, and premature death [8]. Severely
obese children and adolescents have a threefold increased risk of MetS compared to moderately obese
children and adolescents [10,11]. An increasing gradation of obesity was associated with a higher risk
of HTN, while severe obesity has a nearly threefold increased risk compared to moderate obesity in
children and adolescents [12]. The Bogalusa Heart Study demonstrated that 39% of children with
moderate obesity had at least two cardiovascular risk factors, while 59% of children with severe obesity
had at least two cardiovascular risk factors [13].

A recent systematic review has shown that lifestyle-based weight loss interventions with 26 or
more hours of intervention contact are likely to reduce excess weight in children and adolescents after
six to 12 months [14]. Another recent review of studies on children and adolescents with morbid obesity
showed positive weight loss results, indicating that younger children have a greater reduction in body
mass index (BMI) z-score compared to adolescents. This emphasizes the importance of providing
multidisciplinary interventions early in life and tailoring interventions to the needs of adolescents [15].
However, many of these previous intervention programs for obese children and adolescents were
difﬁcult to apply in real-world settings, such as home-visit models [16], high intensity intervention
programs [17], or inpatient treatment [18,19]. Therefore, when the children and adolescents return
to the real-world setting, they regain their weight [15,20]. Thus, we developed a moderate-intensity
multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention program that is both sustainable in the real-world setting and
practically applicable to both moderate and severe obesity. We also assessed the effectiveness of
our intervention program on obesity status, body composition, physical ﬁtness, and cardiometabolic
risk markers.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Design and Participants

Overall, 103 participants aged between six and 16 years (63 boys and 40 girls), with a BMI ≥85th
percentile of age and sex-speciﬁc BMI according to the 2007 Korean National Growth Charts [21],
were recruited for the Intervention for Childhood and Adolescents Obesity via Activity and Nutrition
(ICAAN) study through recruitment notices on the website, other social networking services, television
(TV), newspapers, and ﬂyers. Overweight was deﬁned as a BMI ≥85th percentile for age and sex,
while mild to moderate obesity was deﬁned as a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 or ≥95th percentile for age and
sex, while severe obesity was deﬁned as a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 or ≥120% of the 95th percentile [21,22].
There are several studies that set BMI ≥97th percentile as the inclusion criteria for studies on severely
obese children and adolescents [23,24]. Therefore, most of the participants in this study had moderate
to severe obesity.

The ICAAN study was designed to test an intervention preventing excessive weight gain and to
improve several health indices in children and adolescents with obesity in Korea. The design of the
ICAAN study is a quasi-experimental intervention trial with two active treatment groups receiving a
16-week intervention program, which included 16 weeks of usual care (usual care group) or exercise
(exercise group). This program is a multidisciplinary program that includes medical consultation and
behavioral modiﬁcation by doctors, nutritional counseling and education by clinical dietitians, exercise
training and ﬁtness test by exercise specialists, evaluation and assessment of the family environment

by social workers, physical measurement and blood sampling by nurses, and lifestyle monitoring
and feedback through smart bands by research coordinators. The ﬂowcharts describe the strategy of
recruiting the participants and administering the intervention (Figures 1 and 2). We used a consecutive
randomization procedure as a principle in assigning participants, but also considered geographic
reasons and personal circumstances. A senior researcher who was not blinded to the research aims
carried out the allocation.

This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki,
and all of the procedures involving human participants were approved by the Hallym University
Sacred Heart Hospital’s Institutional Review Board (approval number: 2015-I134). Written informed
consent was obtained from all of the participants and their parents or caregivers. This study was
registered at cris.nih.go.kr (identiﬁer: KCT0002111).

2.2. Intervention

2.2.1. Usual Care Group

All of the ICAAN programs were conducted within the hospital. The conformity of the
intervention was monitored by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and performed
as planned during the follow-up period. Figure 2 shows the ﬂowchart of the intervention. All of
the participants received usual care. Usual care consisted of one-to-one medical consultation,
workbook provision for goal setting and behavioral modiﬁcation, exercise counseling, physical activity
monitoring and feedback, and one-to-one nutritional counseling.

At the ﬁrst visit, a doctor explained the results of the anthropometric measurements and laboratory
tests, and assessed the health risks and lifestyle of all of the participants. The doctor conducted
four-weekly one-to-one medical consultations during the intervention for goal setting, after reviewing
the workbooks. The contents of the workbook are shown in Table 1.

In addition to medical consultations, all of the participants received exercise counseling from
the doctor, focusing on an increase in the amount of physical activity and reduction in inactive time.
To ensure and promote participants’ daily physical activity levels, all of the participants were asked to
wear a physical activity tracker (iBODY24 Planner +, Greencomm, Korea) throughout the intervention
period. All of the participants were instructed to walk more than 8000 steps per day, and a text message
was sent once a week to encourage daily physical activity.

One-to-one nutritional counseling, according to the Nutritional Care Process (NCP) protocol,
was conducted every four weeks by a clinical dietitian for all of the participants. The NCP contains four
distinct but interrelated steps: nutritional assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring/evaluation;
and it enabled systematic and efficient nutritional counseling. The contents of the nutritional intervention
comprised five sessions (Table 2), and each session was conducted with customized nutritional counseling
for 25 min.

2.2.2. Exercise Group

The participants in the exercise group also received the usual care during the intervention period.
In addition, they were instructed to participate in a 12-week exercise program from the ﬁfth week
of the intervention. The exercise program required participants to exercise three days/week for
60 min/session (one group exercise session and two home-based exercise sessions) at 60% to 90%
of the maximal heart rate (HR). Our group exercise program is a circuit training using body weight,
consisting of six different exercises (Table 3). Each exercise was performed for one minute, with 30–40 s
rest, and it took approximately nine to 10 min to complete one bout of the entire workout (named an
ICAAN Exercise). During group exercise, participants wore a HR monitor (Polar H7 Bluetooth HR
Sensor, Polar, Finland) to ensure an appropriate level of exercise intensity. The home-based exercise
was a review process of the group exercise. The goal was to perform the following more than twice a
week at home: 30 min of aerobic exercise such as running or cycling as well as an ICAAN Exercise for
30 min. In the home-based exercise, a physical activity tracker was used for monitoring, and the daily
exercise journal completed by the exercise group was reviewed weekly for feedback.

2.3. Questionnaire

6 of 16

The questionnaires completed by the children and adolescents included dietary habits, physical
activity, drinking, smoking, sleeping time, screen time (TV/computer use), inactive time, and mental
health (depression, stress, etc.). The questionnaire items completed by the parents or caregivers included
education, monthly household income, past medical history, marital status, and the child’s birth-related
variables (birth weight, type of feeding, etc.). We used the Children’s Depression Inventory [25–27], and the
Global Physical Activity Questionnaire [28], all of which are valid questionnaires.

2.4. Dietary Assessment

Dietary intakes were collected using three-day food records (two weekdays and one weekend
day). The participants’ nutrient intakes were assessed using a computer-aided nutritional analysis
program (CAN Pro, Web version 5.0, The Korean Nutrition Society, Seoul, Korea, 2015).

2.5. Anthropometric Measurements and Body Composition

Body weight and body composition were measured by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (InBody
720 Body Composition Analyzer, BioSpace Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) after a 10-hour fast and voiding,
with the participant barefoot, wearing indoor and lightweight clothing. Height was measured by
a stadiometer (DS-103, DongSahn Jenix, Seoul, Korea), with the participant barefoot. Weight and
height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively. BMI values (weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) were converted into percentiles and z-scores were based on
the age and sex-speciﬁc BMI of the 2007 Korean National Growth Charts [21]. Waist circumference
(WC) was measured at the midpoint between the last rib and the top of the iliac crest to the nearest
0.1 cm, using a non-elastic tape measure. The measurements of these variables were also carried out in
parents. To assess body composition, an additional whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) (Lunar Prodigy Advance with pediatric software version enCore 14.0, GE Medical Systems
Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) scanner performed a series of transverse one-centimeter scans starting at the
participant’s head and progressing toward the feet after a 10-hour fast and voiding. DXA assessments
were made by a certiﬁed radiology technologist. Finally, we used the values measured in the DXA for
body composition analysis.

2.6. Blood Pressure and Blood Samples

The mean value of the blood pressure (BP) of participants was measured twice in the right arm
in the seated position using an oscillometric device (DINAMAP ProCare 200, GE Medical Systems,
Milwaukee, WI, USA). Venous blood samples were obtained after 12 hours of fasting to determine the
fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (CRP). FPG was measured using ultraviolet assay with hexokinase (Cobas 8000 C702, Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). Insulin was measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Cobas
8000 e802, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). HDL-C and LDL-C were measured using a homogeneous
enzymatic colorimetric test (Cobas 8000 C702, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). TG, AST, ALT, and GGT
were measured using enzymatic assay (Cobas 8000 C702, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). CRP was
measured using turbidimetric immunoassay (Cobas 8000 C702, Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
The homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to determine insulin
sensitivity, and was calculated using the following formula: (FPG Level (in milligrams per deciliter) ×
Fasting Plasma Insulin Level (in microunits per milliliter))/405.

2.7. Fitness Test

7 of 16

Cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and muscular strength tests were performed by trained professional
personnel using the step test, arm (bicep) curl test, and wall sit test. In the step test, to measure
cardiorespiratory ﬁtness, participants climbed up and down a 30-cm height step box for three minutes
to match the metronome speed set at 96 beats/min (24 steps/min). Post-exercise HR was measured for
one minute after the end of the test. The arm curl test measured the muscular strength of the upper
extremities. We measured the number of times the full extension and curl was performed for 30 s
with a two kg (female) or four kg (male) dumbbell while sitting in a chair. The wall sit test was used
to measure the muscular strength of the lower extremities. We measured the time taken to maintain
posture by leaning against the wall as if sitting on a desk with legs open to shoulder width leg.

2.8. Procedures

The primary outcome of the study was the BMI z-score, standardized by the use of age and
sex-speciﬁc BMI from the 2007 Korean National Growth Charts [21], and percentage of the 95th
percentile of age and sex-speciﬁc BMI (%BMIp95th). Secondary outcomes included (1) body composition
variables (WC, body fat (BF), and lean body mass (LM)); (2) cardiometabolic risk markers (BP, FPG,
insulin, HOMA-IR, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, AST, ALT, GGT, and CRP); (3) nutrition (total energy intake);
and (4) cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and muscular strength. All of the questionnaires and tests were
completed at baseline and at 16 weeks.

2.9. Sample Size Estimation

Sample size estimation at 80% power with a two-sided signiﬁcance level set at 0.05 showed that a
minimum of 34 participants, 17 in each group, were required to observe signiﬁcant differences in the
BMI z-score changes between groups. We used sample size estimation for a two-sample means test
under the null hypothesis indicating that the means of the two groups are equal. We assumed that
the response within each group is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 0.1 and a true
difference in BMI z-score changes between groups of 0.1.

2.10. Statistical Analysis

The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to evaluate the normality of the data. The analysis was conducted
by transforming the data to a logarithmic scale to achieve a bell-shaped (approximately normal)
distribution on the required variables. We compared the baseline characteristics of the two treatment
groups using two-tailed t tests for independent samples (after checking for normal distributions of
continuous variables). In addition, we used the Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test for
categorical variables. The paired t test was used to compare the pre-intervention and post-intervention
outcomes (baseline and at 16 weeks). Mixed effects linear regression models for repeated measures
were used to analyze between-group differences in primary and secondary outcomes over time.
Intercept was used for the mixed model random effects at the individual level.

All of the statistical analyses were conducted using Stata/MP, version 14.0 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX, USA). All of the statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical signiﬁcance was determined
at a p-value < 0.05.

3. Results

3.1. Baseline Characteristics

Of the 103 participants, 38.8% were girls, 34.0% had severe obesity, 80.6% had a BMI ≥97th
percentile for age and sex, and the mean age of the participants was 12.56 ± 1.96 years. There were
no signiﬁcant differences in the proportion of severe obesity (31.0% versus 40.6%, p = 0.34) and the
proportion of BMI ≥97th percentile for age and sex (81.7% versus 78.1%, p = 0.67) between usual

care and exercise groups at baseline. After the 16-week intervention period, 70 participants were
followed up, and the follow-up rate was 68.0%. The reasons for the loss to follow-up were: parents or
family-related problem (n = 4, 12.1%), child-related problem (n = 6, 18.2%), lack of willingness (n = 3,
9.1%), disconnection (n = 5, 15.2%), and no data (n = 15, 45.5%). There were no signiﬁcant differences
in the main outcomes between the followed-up and dropped-out groups at baseline, except for HDL
levels (48.23 versus 43.55, p = 0.02).

We deﬁned participants who have data at both baseline and 16-week follow-up as completers,
and performed analysis on all of the participants (n = 103) and completers (n = 70) separately, using
baseline data. Table 4 shows the anthropometric measurements and the secondary outcome variables
for all of the participants and completers. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the usual care
and exercise groups at baseline.

3.2. Changes in Primary Outcomes

The overall completers’ baseline and 16-week BMI z-scores were 2.32 and 2.27, respectively;
there was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease after the intervention (p = 0.02). After the intervention,
only the exercise group had signiﬁcantly lower BMI z-scores (2.24 ± 0.56 versus 2.32 ± 0.52, p = 0.03)
and %BMIp95th (114.10 ± 1.13% versus 116.02 ± 1.12%, p = 0.04) than at baseline (Table 5). However,
after adjustment for confounding variables including sex, age, parental obesity, parental education,
monthly household income, marital status, and sleep time, by mixed effects linear regression,
there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in the BMI z-score and %BMIp95th between the
two intervention groups (β −0.02, 95%CI −0.13 to 0.10; β −1.00, 95%CI −1.03 to 1.02, respectively)
after the 16-week follow-up (Table 5).

3.3. Changes in Secondary Outcomes: Body Composition, Cardiometabolic Risk Markers, Nutrition,
and Cardiorespiratory Fitness, and Muscular Strength

After the intervention, both groups had higher LM (usual care group: 41.26 ± 10.96 kg versus
40.18 ± 10.98 kg, p < 0.001; exercise group: 44.55 ± 6.04 kg versus 42.85 ± 6.41 kg, p < 0.001) and
lower total energy intake (usual care group: 2022.5 ± 521.6 kcal versus 2367.2 ± 424.9 kcal, p = 0.001;

exercise group: 1965.4 ± 409.0 kcal versus 2509.8 ± 559.9 kcal, p < 0.001) than at baseline (Table 6).
In the usual care group, BF (p = 0.01) at the 16-week follow-up was higher than at baseline (Table 6).

4. Discussion

In this study, two types of lifestyle interventions for obese children and adolescents were
compared. In the exercise group, the BMI z-score signiﬁcantly decreased by about 0.1 after 16 weeks of
intervention compared with the score at baseline, but there was no signiﬁcant difference in the BMI
z-scores between the usual care and exercise groups. This study also demonstrated that in children
and adolescents with obesity, the intervention achieved positive effects on body composition, physical
ﬁtness, and cardiometabolic risk markers. At the 16-week follow-up, signiﬁcant improvement over the
intervention period was found in the exercise group compared with the usual care group with %BF,
LM, DBP, CRP, and wall sit test score.

A recent systematic review has shown that lifestyle-based weight management interventions,
above a threshold of 26 estimated contact hours, were generally effective in reducing excess weight
in children and adolescents after six to 12 months. This was typically seen with absolute BMI
z-score reductions of 0.2 or more, compared with little or no reduction in the control groups [14].
However, interventions with fewer than the estimated 26 h of contact, over three to 24 months, showed
statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁts at the six to 12-month follow-up, and the standardized effect sizes were
usually small, generally reﬂecting absolute BMI z-score reductions of 0.1 or less in the intervention
groups [14]. Moreover, an intervention study (which included participants who were overweight,

Nutrients 2019, 11, 137

12 of 16

had obesity, or severe obesity) suggested that an intensive behavioral weight loss intervention that has
demonstrated efﬁcacy in decreasing BMI z-scores may have incrementally smaller effects in children
as weight classiﬁcation increases [29]. Therefore, considering that this study is a moderate-intensity
intervention applicable to both moderate and severe obesity, the effect size was not signiﬁcantly
different from these previous studies. Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to expect a large difference between
the two groups in this study, because the usual care group, which is an active comparator, received
monthly medical counseling, exercise counseling, and nutritional counseling (NCP protocol), unlike
the controls in other studies.

For the body composition, we observed signiﬁcant improvement not only of %BF, but also of LM
in the exercise group compared to the usual care group. Previous randomized controlled trials for
inpatient or family-based treatment of children and adolescents with severe obesity has shown group by
time interaction effects for %BF [18,23]. However, in some previous studies, fat-free mass (FFM) rather
decreased after interventions, and a reduction in FFM was associated with a decrease in metabolic
rate. This appears to be a major factor in later weight regain in obese children [19,30]. These previous
intervention programs included moderate calorie restriction; it is well-known that hypocaloric diets
result in a decreased resting metabolic rate by the reduction in FFM [31,32].
In addition to the
physiologic increase in LM due to growth, balanced diet and personalized nutritional education rather
than energy restriction seem to have contributed to the positive effect of body composition in this
study. Therefore, at least the participants in this study may be expected to have no later weight regain.
In this study, we observed improvements in DBP and CRP. Several studies have reported positive
effects on BP after interventions [14,23]. However, cardiometabolic outcomes were sparsely reported
in trials of less intensive interventions, and were generally not associated with improvements in BP,
lipid levels, or insulin or glucose levels. In a recent review of studies on children and adolescents with
morbid obesity, cardiovascular risk parameters were only investigated in three of the included studies;
the results demonstrated that children achieved positive effects on cardiometabolic risk markers (LDL,
TG, and insulin sensitivity) [15]. Considering the relatively short duration and moderate intensity of
this intervention, there might be a limitation in the improvement of all of the cardiometabolic indices.
Recent studies have shown that grip strength and other muscle strengths as well as various
strength trainings have positive effects on cardiometabolic outcomes [33–36]. Therefore, in this study,
improvement in the strength of the lower extremities (measured by the wall sit test in the exercise
group after the intervention) could be expected to have a positive effect on cardiometabolic outcomes,
in addition to the effect of weight control in obese children and adolescents.

In this study, the follow-up rate was 68% after the 16-week intervention period. While some
previous studies had follow-up rates of more than 70% during the intervention periods of three to six
months [37–39], others had follow-up rates of less than 70% [40,41]. In the intensive intervention study
or the study on severe obesity, the follow-up rate tended to be low [42,43]. Overall, the follow-up rates
varied from 60% to 85% during intervention periods of three to six months in previous intervention
studies on obesity among children and adolescents [37–43]. Therefore, this study seems to be feasible
because it showed a follow-up rate close to 70%, even though it included severe obesity, and that
moderate intensity intervention was performed.

This study had some limitations. In spite of the consecutive randomization procedure, we could
not completely allocate the participants in both groups randomly for geographical reasons and personal
circumstances. However, there were no signiﬁcant differences in the main outcomes between the usual
care and exercise groups at baseline. Another limitation is the short duration of the follow-up. While it
is important to evaluate the long-term efﬁcacy of this intervention, our primary objective was to ensure
the feasibility and acceptability of our intervention program before launching a larger and longer trial.
In addition, the small sample size was also a limitation. As a ﬁnal limitation, we did not assess the
multi/interdisciplinarity of the team. However, during the program, there was no problem with the
integration or harmonization of our team, subjectively.

The strength of this study is that the protocol was intended to be easily applied in real-world
settings. Many of the previous best practice interventions for obese children and adolescents were
difﬁcult to apply in real-world settings; hence, the weights were regained after returning to the
real-world settings [15,20]. Therefore, we developed an intervention program that can be easily
performed and can be continued on its own after the intervention, by reﬂecting the real-world
setting. As a result, positive effects were observed on body composition, cardiovascular risk markers,
and physical ﬁtness in the exercise group (who were trained through repeated circuit training that
can be easily performed at home), compared to the usual care group. In other words, a better effect
was obtained by adding a practically applicable exercise program to the usual obesity care. Another
strength of this study is the expectation that weight regain can be prevented by continuing with this
exercise program.

5. Conclusions

We have developed a moderate-intensity multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention program that
can be sustainable in the real-world setting and practically applicable to both moderate and severe
obesity. After a 16-week multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention, the exercise group had a lower %BF
and cardiometabolic risk markers, with higher LM and leg muscle strength, compared to the usual
care group.

It is expected that the physical ﬁtness and cardiometabolic risk markers as well as the body
composition in obese children and adolescents can be improved through education and practicing
circuit training exercises, such as the ICAAN Exercise, which obese children and adolescents can easily
follow. This should be done in conjunction with nutrition and psychological counseling in clinical
practice. Therefore, a long-term intervention is necessary to conﬁrm the effectiveness of this program
