Abstract: Background and objectives: Suicide in adolescents represents a major public health concern.
To date, a growing number of suicide preventive strategies based on the use of new technologies are
emerging. We aimed to provide an overview of the present literature on the use of new technologies
in adolescent suicide prevention. Materials and methods: An electronic search was run using the
following keywords: Technology OR Technologies OR APP OR Application OR mobile application)
AND (Adolescent OR youth OR puberty) AND (Suicid* OR Self-harm OR self-destruction). Inclusion
criteria were: English language, published in a peer-reviewed journal, suicide prevention with the
use of new technologies among adolescents. Results: Our search strategy yielded a total of 12 studies
on the use of telemedicine, 7 on mobile applications, and 3 on language detection. We also found
heterogeneity regarding the study design: 3 are randomized controlled trials (RCT), 13 are open-label
single group trials, 2 are randomized studies, and 1 is a cross-sectional study. Telemedicine was
the most adopted tool, especially web-based approaches. Mobile applications mostly focused on
screening of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and for clinical monitoring through the
use of text messages. Although telepsychiatry and mobile applications can provide a fast and safe
tool, supporting and preceding a face-to-face clinical assessment, only a few studies demonstrated
efﬁcacy in preventing suicide among adolescents through the use of these interventions. Some studies
suggested algorithms able to recognize people at risk of suicide from the exploration of the language
on social media posts. Conclusions: New technologies were found to be well accepted and tolerated
supports for suicide prevention in adolescents. However, to date, few data support the use of such
interventions in clinical practice and preventive strategies. Further studies are needed to test their
efﬁcacy in suicide prevention among adolescents and young adults.

1. Introduction

Mental health problems and, more speciﬁcally, suicide are relevant public health con-
cerns in adolescence [1,2]. Up to 20% of adolescents suffer from a psychiatric disorder [3],
and psychiatric disorders account for about 45% of the years lived in disability for those
between 10 to 24 years of age [4]. Suicide is one of the major causes of death worldwide
among youth, ranking second for the 15–19 age group [5]. Thus, suicide prevention in ado-
lescents should be considered a priority among public health policies [6]. Suicide ideation
is strongly predictive of suicide attempts and suicide mortality [7]. Thus, efforts aimed at
preventing, detecting, and, eventually treating suicidal ideation might also prevent suicide
attempts and deaths from suicide [8].

Nowadays the use of technology is increasing in medical ﬁelds and specialties and,
even in psychiatry, the concept of “telepsychiatry” is acquiring a more deﬁned identity [9].

Moreover, given the recent public health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians
require new tools for delivering services and preventive interventions [10,11]. Technology
is providing new frontiers in psychiatry, and the usual face-to-face suicide risk assessment
of patients has now often been replaced with consultations based on digital tools [12–16].
Thus, regarding suicide prevention, fast and effective response to the patient’s needs,
avoiding delay, might be implemented using new technologies [12,17].

The focus of the present paper was to investigate some of the existing approaches to
suicide prevention based on new technologies and data collection targeted at the adolescent
population. Adolescents are avid users of technology. Almost a quarter of adolescents
are online constantly and more than 90% are online daily [18]. Adolescents and young
adults are technologically savvy, and a large proportion of them own a smartphone or other
devices that allow for different types of interactions; phone calls, texts, Facebook messages,
Tweets, and blog posts are just a few examples of possible communication channels used to
keep social connections and to share ideas, thoughts and emotions. Thus, there is no doubt
about the importance of interventions based on new technologies in suicide prevention
among youths. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effec-
tiveness of digital interventions (focusing on smartphone apps) for the self-management
of suicidal ideation or self-harm among both adults and adolescents [19]. However, to
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst qualitative overview of the current literature regarding the
use of a broader range of new technologies speciﬁcally developed for preventing suicidal
behavior among adolescents. Thus, the aims of the present paper were: (1) to provide a
systematic review of available and published studies focusing on interventions based on
the use of new technologies and (2) to provide a detailed picture of the currently available
preventive strategies using digital tools for adolescents.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Search Strategy and Information Sources

A computerized literature search of the MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE
databases, following PRISMA checklist [20], using the following keywords: (Technology
OR Technologies OR APP OR Application OR mobile application) AND (Adolescent OR
youth OR puberty) AND (Suicid* OR Self-harm OR self-destruction). Examining references
cited in identiﬁed reports extended these electronic searches.

2.2. Study Selection

As shown in Figure 1, a total of 1107 records resulted from the initial database search.
The ﬁrst selection of records was made by two reviewers (G.S. and L.P.) by analyzing
the title and abstract of the records, and only research studies focusing on the use of
technologies in suicide prevention among adolescents were considered. Overall, 87 studies
were ﬁrst screened and considered potentially relevant for our purpose.

We included original articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals, that focused
on suicidal behavior and its prevention with the use of new technologies among adolescents.
We excluded articles not written in the English language, studies of behaviors other
than suicidal behavior, papers considering an age-range population different from adoles-
cence (age range 10–25 years) [21], and case reports. At the end of the screening process,
20 articles were included in our qualitative synthesis (Figure 1). Three reviewers selected
the studies (A.F., G.S., L.P.). Disagreements in the selection process and/or extraction of
data was solved by consensus and involving an additional senior reviewer (M.P.).

2.3. Data Extraction

Three investigators (A.F., G.S., L.P.) independently extracted data from the chosen
reports. Measures extracted from each study sample included the following: country
of origin, years in which data were collected, total sample size, duration of follow-up,
the proportion of women, mean age, suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation and/or suicide
attempt), psychiatric diagnoses, self-harming behaviors, and concomitant medication.

2.4. Risk of Bias within Studies

To assess risk of bias, a quality assessment was completed using the National Institutes
of Health Quality Assessment Tool of Controlled Intervention Studies (Table 1), designed
to examine study quality according to Cochrane collaboration criteria [22,23].

3. Results
3.1. Studies’ Selection, Characteristics and Limitations

The 20 papers included in the qualitative synthesis are characterized by great het-
erogeneity regarding both the study design and the technologies adopted for preventing
suicide in adolescence (see Table 2).

Focusing on the study design, 2 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) [24,25],
12 were open-label single group trials [26–37] 2 were randomized studies [38,39], 4 were
retrospective cohort studies [40–43]. The overall sample consisted of 221,419 adolescents.
The concomitant psychiatric diagnosis was included in seven studies; six studies took into
account depressive disorders [27,28,30,31,33,38], two autism spectrum disorders [27,42]
and two anxiety disorders [31,38]. Only one study [24] included concomitant medication.
Suicidal behavior was investigated differently in the studies; nine studies focused only
on suicidal ideation [25,26,28–30,34,39,41,43], six on suicide attempts [24,27,32,33,40,42];
and two analyzed both suicide ideation and suicide attempts [36,38]. Given the results
obtained from the literature search, three main different technological tools were found:
telepsychiatry, mobile health intervention, language detection.

3.2. Telepsychiatry

Our search strategy found 11 studies on the use of telepsychiatry as a tool for suicide
prevention. In 2016 a British study tested whether a text-messaging intervention to support
adolescents who self-harm (TeenTEXT) could be administered by clinicians at child and
adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) within the context of everyday clinical practice.
Despite the interest by clinicians in using the intervention, they found very limited engage-
ment in practice, and only six patient–clinician dyads were recruited [37]. Thus, the study
failed to demonstrate any effect of the intervention in preventing suicide. In the same year,
Robinson and colleagues started a pilot study to test the efﬁcacy of a newly designed eight-
module Internet-based program, trying to identify suicidal ideation among adolescents
(21 secondary school students). At the end of the study, there was a signiﬁcant reduction
in all dimensions that were targeted as outcomes of interest (depression, hopelessness, and
suicidal ideation), suggesting that Internet-based programs could have a role in preventing
suicide among the youth [28]. Chen and colleagues developed an automated text message
intervention using a platform for both depression (EpxDepression) and autism spectrum
disorder (ASD; EpxAutism) [27]. They focused their research on depression and autism
(with six and three participants, respectively) with two subtypes of the platform: EpxDe-
pression and EpxAutism. The platform utilized an automated system to triage patients into
three risk categories based on their responses and alerted clinicians directly when patients
met speciﬁc risk criteria. EpxDepression detected thoughts of self-harm in patients before
their case managers or caregivers were aware of such ideation [27].

In 2018, an Australian study from two mental health services (headspace Camperdown
and headspace Campbelltown) tested a new technology for online assessment called
the “Mental Health eClinic (MHeC)” [36]. Comparing online assessment and standard
assessment in face-to-face services, they found good agreement between the two techniques
(68%, kappa = 0.39). The authors found that the online assessment placed a greater focus on
the history of mental health problems (p = 0.001), as well as any previous suicide planning
(p = 0.002) and current comorbidity with cannabis misuse (p = 0.03) as indicators of the
progression of the disease. They concluded that the online assessment process could be a
more efﬁcient way of detecting the lifetime severity of the disorders.

A recent randomized trial (n = 110) compared the effectiveness and acceptability of
the Case-ﬁnding and Help Assessment Tool (YouthCHAT, a self-report, electronic screener
of several domains such as drug use, depression, gambling, etc.) with a face-to-face
assessment [39]. The results demonstrated that YouthCHAT was a time-saving method,
with a mean difference of 8 min 25 s. compared to standard assessment. Moreover,
YouthCHAT was found to be an effective and acceptable screener for use in a secondary
school youth populations, with similar or signiﬁcantly higher detection rates than the
face-to-face assessment [39].

Dickter and colleagues [30] tested the impact of an Internet-based depression pre-
vention intervention (CATCH-IT) on risk factors for suicide (such as suicidal ideation,
hopelessness, low self-esteem, and social isolation). The program consisted of self-guided,
online modules based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychother-
apy aimed at increasing skills for developing resilience and decreasing vulnerability to
depressive symptoms. The authors found a signiﬁcant change in suicidal ideation in
adolescents at risk of depression after using the platform, even with very small effect sizes.
Mean suicidal ideation across all participants decreased by 3.3% (p < 0.05; d = 0.22) [30].
Interestingly, when they analyzed only those who completed all 14 modules (n = 24), mean
suicidal ideation decreased by 8.8%, with a moderate effect size (p = 0.01; d = 0.60). Recently,
Han et al. investigated whether web conferencing technology-based online focus groups
(W-OFGs) are an efﬁcient method to involve young people, who have suicidal thoughts,
in suicide prevention programs. They found a high rate of participation (70%) and good
acceptability by users [32].

An Australian study analyzed the association between sexting and suicidal behaviors,
as well as with several other mental health negative outcomes (body image issues, and
information and communication technology [ICT] safety risks, including cyberbullying and
late-night Internet use). Milton, et al. [35] run a survey using computer-assisted telephone
interviewing (CATI) and found that sexting (both receiving and sending) were signiﬁcantly
associated with reporting suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the past 12 months. Using an
ecological study, Runkle and colleagues [29] analyzed the role of crisis text lines during
a weather-related disaster in North and South Carolina, USA (Hurricane Florence). The
aim was to study the psychological impact of a disaster on youth from an analysis of
the variation of crisis text volume before and after the hurricane. The adolescents were
seeking help for several problems, including stress and anxiety, depression, and suicidal
thoughts. As a low-cost and immediate service, the crisis-texting platform succeeded
in providing 24/7 mental health support for the youths. Based on this experience, the
authors highlighted how text-based crisis support services could identify the mental health
consequences of a disaster along with the measuring the situational awareness in an
impacted community.

3.3. Mobile Health Interventions

Smartphone applications can be considered to be an evolution of telepsychiatry. Five

studies focused on the use of a mobile app to prevent suicide [24,31,33,34,38].

Kennard and colleagues evaluated suicidal behavior using the app BRITE in the
ASAP (As Safe as Possible) study [38]. In this study, 66 inpatients were recruited and then
monitored using BRITE (suitable for both IOS and Android software). The participants
received daily text messages to rate their level of emotional distress (on a scale of 1–5, with
5 being “most upsetting”). Based on their level of distress, participants were offered a
range of distress tolerance and emotion regulation skills. However, despite its acceptability,
this randomized controlled trial did not detect any substantial clinical effects on either
suicidal ideation or attempts; but a non-signiﬁcant reduction in the rate of suicide attempts
among the participants assigned to ASAP plus treatment as usual was observed (hazard
ratio = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.05, 1.09).

Grist and colleagues explored the safety, use, and acceptability of the BlueIce app [31].
This mobile phone app was tested for reducing and preventing self-harm among adoles-
cents. Forty participants were recruited from a child and adolescent mental health services
(CAMHS), all aged between 12 and 17 and with a history of self-harm. The results from
this study showed that BlueIce was helpful and safe in supporting adolescents, and it also
showed some effectiveness in managing thoughts of self-harming [31].

There is now a growing number of studies on new mobile interventions that have

showed feasibility, even if they have not yet been tested for their efﬁcacy [44].

3.4. Language Detection

Four studies adopted language detection as a suicide prevention strategy. In this
approach textual features are extracted from online posts (forums, tweets, and other
social media) for detecting suicidality. Statistical classiﬁcation algorithms, using logistic
regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are applied to
disclose patterns and relationships between text features and suicidality [40–43].

Aladag and colleagues screened 508,398 Reddit posts longer than 100 characters,
posted between 2008 and 2016 on SuicideWatch, Depression, Anxiety, and ShowerThoughts
subreddits. They chose 785 posts to analyze; textual parts were extracted from posts for
discriminating suicidality, then statistical classiﬁcation algorithms (logistic regression,
random forest, and then support vector machine) were applied to detect relationships
between the extracted text and suicidality. Four different experiments were conducted
trying to discriminate different levels of suicidality among posts. The ﬁndings from
this study showed that text-mining methods could be used to detect posts with suicidal
ideation online, on a real-time base using a Javascript or mobile app library [40]. Grant
and colleagues also adopted a text mining approach to analyze 63,232 posts from the
social media platform Reddit, speciﬁcally the subreddit called r/SuicideWatch [43]. They
extracted informal latent topics from online social media expressing suicidal ideations.
They ﬁrst evaluated the latent topics and then compared them to risk factors proposed
by domain experts. Thus, they identiﬁed speciﬁc informal terminology used online and
compared it to speciﬁc risk factors, to build up new models to detect suicidality.

Brown and colleagues applied a quality text analysis software (ATLAS.ti 7)(N = 52
participants) to detect and investigate expressions related to active suicidal thoughts
on Instagram. The language used was then compared to the language emerging from
interviews. No differences in activity and language use were found to be associated with
acute suicidality, and authors concluded that other machine learning approaches might be
more appropriate for detecting suicidality on social networks [41].

Downs and colleagues screened 230,465 documents obtained from a large autism spec-
trum disorder (ASD) electronic health records system using a natural language processing
(NLP) system. They then tested NLP on 500 ASD patients as a tool to evaluate positive
and negated suicide intentions. The study showed that NLP could be useful to detect
suicidality within the health records of young people with ASD [42].

4. Discussion

The use of tele-communication and the Internet has progressed from the use of the
telephone in the 1970s and, later, the Internet for crisis intervention [45]. The present litera-
ture overview examined all available studies focusing on suicide prevention interventions
among adolescents and young adults based on the use of new technologies. Across the
20 included studies, we found that three main technological tools have been tested as
suicide preventive interventions: telemedicine, mobile health interventions, and language
detection. The results of this overview showed that most of the studies focused their inves-
tigation on the adoption of telemedicine in psychiatry for preventing suicide in adolescents.
As deﬁned by the American Psychiatric Association, telepsychiatry is deﬁned as “a subset
of telemedicine, [which] can involve providing a range of services including psychiatric
evaluations, therapy (individual therapy, group therapy, family therapy), patient education
and medication management” [9].

Most of the studies we identiﬁed were Internet-based interventions, most of which
demonstrated good acceptability and satisfaction among users [30,39]. Interestingly, older
reports showed less engagement from users [37], suggesting that new generations might
be more easily involved in the use of digital tools. However, despite the acceptability
of these new digital tools for telepsychiatry, only a few studies demonstrated efﬁcacy in
preventing suicide among adolescents through the use of online and telephone-based
interventions [27,30]. Of note, telepsychiatry might be considered especially suitable
for reaching populations characterized by low engagement with traditional health care

facilities, such as adolescents [46]. Moreover, telemedicine is already supporting new
promising methodologies in detecting suicidal behaviors among selected populations, such
as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) [47,48]. Web platforms might also be involved
in school programs aimed at preventing suicide in students [44].

We also found several studies testing different mobile apps for smartphones, especially
for screening for depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation [31] and for clinical monitoring
through the use of text messages [38]. Results from this review showed that the use of a
mobile app is a fast and easy way to reach adolescents, to keep in contact with them and
to monitor their suicidal behaviors [38]. Moreover, given the very high rates of suicide
attempts and deaths from suicide after discharge from psychiatric facilities [48,49], it
seems important to develop new digital tools (such as the app BRITE) for screening and
supporting such a high-risk population [38]. A large proportion of suicidal behaviors occur
within the ﬁrst three weeks of outpatient treatment following hospital discharge [50,51],
meaning that even rapid referral to outpatient care may only partially alleviate the high rate
of suicidal behavior after hospital discharge. Thus, a tailored app can provide a fast and
safe tool, supporting and preceding a face-to-face clinical assessment after discharge [38].
A few studies focused on the use of language detection to identify suicidality among
social media users. With the rise in sophistication and use of online social networks, suicidal
thoughts have been increasingly expressed in online forums, tweets, and other social media,
resulting in a vast collection of thoughts and motivations associated with suicide [43]. The
challenge consists in developing language detection programs that can reveal suicidal
intent from posts on social media. Some of the studies we found focused on Reddit,
which is a suitable social media platform because of a speciﬁc suicidal subsection and
because it allows longer posts [40,43]. Interestingly, language detection can also be applied
to electronic health records [42], suggesting future possibilities for studies using large
electronic databases. Despite the limited amount of evidence, some authors have already
developed algorithms able to recognize people at risk of suicide from the exploration of
the language on social media posts, precise and timely enough to promise some clinical
effectiveness [52]. However, little thought has focused on useful ways of responding to
such online communications when they occur.

Many of the studies in this review suffer from signiﬁcant theoretical and practical
limitations. Most studies on commercial apps have not adhered to rigorous evidenced-
based procedures, and the results usually lack validation by medical standards. Moreover,
no systematic assessment has been conducted on the relative validity and reliability of
active self-reporting and passive data collection, which is one of the major advantages of
using digital tools such as smartphone or web platforms. Notably, most of the studies
focused on patients individually, whereas their social context (such as family members and
caregivers) can be equally important in preventing suicide among adolescents. Moreover,
several ethical issues arise (such as privacy and social media suicide prevention protocols)
from the use of new technologies, especially language detection, that need to be addressed
before their use for screening and monitoring. Furthermore, the cultural implications
of the implementations need to be discussed [52]. In addition, adolescents are widely
using recently introduced social media platforms that have not been considered yet for
suicide preventive interventions (such as tik-tok) [53], and further studies are needed to ﬁll
this gap.

In general, the new and fast-developing technological tools (including language
detection) might be part of suicide preventive strategies in adolescents in the future [52],
supporting training for new strategies for suicide risk management [44]. However, beside
technological developments, evidenced-based interventions to prevent suicidality in young
people involve friends, families, school teachers, caregivers and clinicians [54]. It appears,
therefore, to be more realistic that the new technologies will supplement existing strategies
in the future rather than substituting for them. Nonetheless, such digital tools might be
complementary with subjective approaches to suicide prevention, promoting a stronger
connection with clinicians [55].

Limitations

The ﬁndings of the present review should be interpreted in light of several limitations.
These include, in particular, high levels of heterogeneity of methods and outcomes across
the studies, incomplete reporting of suicidal ideation and attempts, sometimes-unclear
diagnoses, the involvement of special populations (such as Australian indigenous people),
and sampling from particular geographic areas or socioeconomic groups that may not gen-
eralize to others. Given the heterogeneity of methods and study outcomes, a quantitative
synthesis of results was not feasible. Finally, most of the studies considered did not provide
sufﬁcient data to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the intervention in reducing suicidal behavior
among adolescents. Of note, a further limitation is that many new studies on technological
tools are still not published, and so the present overview might have missed some of the
existing digital tools that are being tested to prevent suicide in adolescents. Moreover,
we focused our search on a few speciﬁc technological tools (telemedicine, mobile applica-
tions, and language detection), and we might have missed some of the new technological
tools available.

5. Conclusions

The present ﬁndings suggest that new technologies provide well-tolerated and ac-
ceptable support for suicide prevention in adolescents. However, only limited data at
the present time support the use of such interventions in clinical practice and prevention
strategies. Overall, while there is some promise of these interventions for reducing suici-
dal ideation and attempts, whether this can be clinically useful remains unclear. Further
studies are needed to test the efﬁcacy of new technologies in suicide prevention for adoles-
cents and young adults, and further studies are needed to compare validated face-to-face
interventions with interventions based on new technologies.
