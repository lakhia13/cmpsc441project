Interest in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as yoga in primary
schools has grown. Evidence shows promise, as youth who engage in yoga to promote
mindfulness show improved coping skills, increased socio-emotional competence and pro-
social skills, academic performance, attention span, and ability to deal with stress.

Objective

This study reports the results of a program evaluation of a universal health and wellness cur-
riculum, Pure Power, designed to teach youth yoga techniques, mindfulness, and emotion
regulation.

Methods

A non-randomized comparison design examined outcomes among participants from
schools that completed the intervention with highest fidelity of implementation (n = 461) and
from students in matched comparison schools (n = 420). Standard measures of coping,
emotion regulation and emotion dysregulation, spelling, and math achievement were
collected.

Results

Analyses suggest the youth in the intervention schools demonstrated relative improvement
on measures of emotion regulation, spelling, and math.

Conclusions

Challenges in implementation in real-life settings are vital to identify. The data provide some
real-world evidence for the effectiveness of a universal health and wellness curriculum on
emotion regulation and positive academic outcomes. Training school staff to deliver the
intervention may foster implementation. Future research should test the effectiveness of

Introduction

Children who experience traumatic and adverse life experiences (TRACEs) [1] are at an ele-
vated risk of behavioral and mental health concerns [2, 3]. TRACEs involve experiencing a
threat (e.g., physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, exposure to violence) or deprivation (e.g.,
physical and emotional neglect, parental separation) and the types of adversity, duration of
adversity, cumulative experiences, and interactions among experiences of adversity are all
important in a child’s development [4]. Duration of stressors may be acute or chronic, such as
whether a child experienced an environmental disaster or was born into poverty [4]. Chil-
dren’s perception and interpretation of adversity are associated with a myriad of challenges in
emotional development, and following adversity, children may experience further social and
academic challenges [5, 6]. School-based interventions that target general wellness may foster
resilience in the wake of adversity, and so are an important avenue for primary prevention of
mental health problems and to improve academic achievement among youth at risk for
TRACEs [7].

In the face of stress and adversity, children who develop adaptive coping and emotion regu-
lation strategies are less likely to experience negative effects and be better at managing stressful
situations [8, 9]. An integrative model of coping strategies includes three broad strategies that
have received attention in empirical studies [10]. First, children may engage in the solution-
focused strategy, which includes identifying and seeking solutions to resolve problems. Second,
the emotion-oriented coping strategy focuses on emotion regulation or the ability to regulate
negative emotional states, such as anxiety, shame, fear, guilt, anger, or despair. Third, children
may engage in an avoidant-oriented strategy, which entails avoiding stressors or adversity by
distancing in various ways [11].

Mindfulness and mindfulness training have been shown to have positive effects on coping
and emotion regulation. Mindfulness is described as "paying attention in a particular way: on
purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally” [12]. Mindfulness encourages non-
judgmental attention to the present moment while reducing negative feelings stemming from
unpleasant experiences [13]. In children, interventions utilizing mindfulness may support
emotion regulation and healthy coping mechanisms in response to stress [14]. Effectively,
mindfulness is thought to enhance the ability to engage in solution-focused strategies and
emotion regulation through promoting goal orientation, problem disengagement, and mobi-
lizing resources to focus on acceptance and awareness while minimizing avoidance-oriented
coping by fostering an attitude of non-attachment towards stressful life experiences [15, 16].
A notable and widely used set of techniques that can promote mindfulness is yoga [17].
Yoga is a mindfulness-based practice that combines breathing, posture, meditation, and move-
ment [18]. Decades of research on adults find that yoga and mindfulness instruction aid in
addressing the negative impacts of stress and adversity on emotional and behavioral function-
ing by reducing feelings associated with anxiety and depression while improving attention
modulation [14]. In adult populations with health concerns, a meta-analysis found that yoga
and mindfulness programs effectively manage and reduce stress [19]. Interest in the effective-
ness of mindfulness-based interventions such as yoga in primary schools has grown. Prelimi-
nary evidence shows some promise, as youth in second grade to twelfth grade who engage in
yoga to promote mindfulness showed improved coping skills, increased socio-emotional

competence and prosocial skills, decreased alcohol use, and teacher-rated improvements in
academic performance, attention span, and ability to deal with stress and feelings of anxiety
[20–24].

Overall results on mindfulness-based interventions in youth are mixed [22, 23]. For exam-

ple, a multi-year longitudinal study [25] measuring the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based
stress reduction intervention in 12–18-year-olds found that youth significantly improved their
internalizing problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, and somatization) as measured by the Behav-
ioral Assessment System for Children. A randomized, controlled intervention study [26] com-
pared primary coping scores on the Response to Stress Questionnaire prior to and after sixth-
grade female students completed a mindfulness-based intervention or a control condition for
six weeks. This study found no significant interactions between the control or intervention
groups and primary coping skills. A separate study found that in a small sample of elementary
school youth diagnosed with anxiety or depression, an eight-week-long mindfulness-based
intervention did not improve scores of anxiety or depression on the Behavior Assessment Sys-
tem for Children [27]. The need for further longitudinal studies is clear, as it is posited that the
effects of yoga interventions only emerge in the long term (~6–7 months post-intervention)
[28]. One reason for mixed findings is the lack of fidelity assessments and the difficulty deliver-
ing yoga-based practices with fidelity [29]. Attempts to examine the effectiveness of school-
based yoga highlight methodological limitations beyond intervention length, such as lack of
controls, lack of experimental designs, few replicable interventions, and little fidelity monitor-
ing of intervention curriculums [30, 31].

The present study reports the results of a program evaluation of a universal health and well-

ness curriculum, Pure Power, designed to teach youth yoga techniques, mindfulness, and
healthy emotion regulation. The data presented here draws upon a study with implementation
and delivery fidelity data that were previously reported [29] (additional detail in the proce-
dures section). In this report, we sought to provide insights on implementation from an out-
comes perspective. Our goal was to identify schools where implementation fidelity was
maximized to conclude the intervention was delivered successfully and then evaluate the rela-
tionship between exposure to the curriculum and relative improvement on areas of coping,
emotion regulation/dysregulation, and achievement when compared to schools that experi-
enced greater barriers and difficulty with implementation. Exposure to the Pure Power curric-
ulum was hypothesized to improve children’s coping skills and emotion regulation/
dysregulation, as well as improve indices of academics as measured by standardized spelling
and math scores.

Method

The study received IRB approval from Stanford University (Approved 09/23/2014, eProtocol #
31715); the original study protocol (IRB approval documents) are available as supplements.
This study was initially planned and received IRB approval as a multifaceted examination of
brain function, sleep patterns, and biopsychosocial emotional data among at risk youth with a
practical program evaluation component [32] of the wellness curriculum. The study was not
originally conceived of as a formal clinical trial, but was later registered as a clinical trial at the
request of the PLOS ONE editors (ID: NCT06014970). Data from the research protocol on the
fMRI [33] and sleep assessments [34] has been previously published. These studies involved
smaller subsamples of the larger study. This paper focuses on the largest groups of participants
and on students’ self-reported program evaluation outcomes following involvement in the
wellness curriculum. Allocation was non-randomized. The intervention model was parallel
assignment with no masking of condition (students in the wellness curriculum schools knew

they were receiving the wellness curriculum). The original recruitment plan was 800 children
but was based on school level recruitment; based on the schools, a total of 1,176 were recruited
with 881 participants from high fidelity schools and matched comparisons analyzed in this
study (see details under participants and in the flow diagram).

Participants

A CONSORT flow diagram is presented in Fig 1. The S2–S7 Tables provide details on sample
sizes for each condition and comparison group across each of the assessment points. Authors
had no access to information that could identify participants during or after data collection.
Data were collected from school districts in the San Francisco Bay Area beginning in the fall of
2014. At study entry, 1,176 children (47.1% female) were recruited, with ages ranging between
7 and 13 (M = 9.19, SD = 1.14 from grades 3 to 5). Data included in current analyses came
from eight schools in underserved communities in the Bay Area and utilizes three time points
taken roughly one year apart. We analyzed data from students who were in schools that com-
pleted the intervention with implementation fidelity (n = 4) and in comparison schools
(n = 4). Due to variations in fidelity ratings across intervention schools and demographic char-
acteristics of potential control schools, "matched pairs" were created that pair high-fidelity
intervention schools with demographically matched control schools (more details below
under design, data analyses, and results sections). Demographics of matched pair schools are
presented in S1 Table. The sample of youth was predominantly Hispanic (60.1%), followed by
American Indian (4.9%), African American (4.1%), Pacific Islander (3.0%), and non-Hispanic
White (1.1%). In total, 988 (91.1%) youth met criteria for free or reduced lunch. Comparisons
between intervention and control schools indicated that these groups did not differ on age or
gender distribution. Dependent on the amount and combination of assessments completed at
each of the three time points (e.g., questionnaires, saliva collections, sleep assessment, brain

scans), students received between $25 and $750 for their participation. Informed consent was
obtained from both parents as well as child participants.

Measures

The Response to Stress Questionnaire (RSQ) [35] was used to evaluate youth’s coping and
emotion regulation strategies. The RSQ is comprised of a checklist of stressors that may be
experienced during stressful situations. Following the checklist of stressors, a possible total of
57 questions ask individuals how they respond to stressors they recently experienced. Youth
rate how often they cope with a stressor in a certain way on a 4-point Likert scale (ranging
from 1, "Not at all," to 4, "A lot"). The RSQ is divided into two major subscales: School-Related
Stress Experiences and Stress Reactivity. Stress Reactivity is further divided into two composite
scores: involuntary engagement and primary control. Examples of School-Related Stress Expe-
riences include rating how stressful school-related situations have been in the past six months
(e.g. "Doing badly on a test or paper," "Having trouble studying," and "Not understanding
homework"). The stress reactivity subscale assesses how youth respond to school problems;
responses may manifest as rumination (e.g., "I can’t stop thinking about what I said or did"),
intrusive thoughts (e.g., "Thoughts about school problems just pop into my head"), physiologi-
cal arousal (e.g., "When I’m dealing with school problems, my heart races"), emotional arousal
(e.g., "When I am faced with school problems, I get anxious"), and involuntary action (e.g., "I
can’t always control what I do"). The Involuntary Engagement composite score is an average
of scores on the rumination, intrusive thoughts, physiological arousal, emotional arousal, and
involuntary actions subscales. The Primary Control composite score is an average of scores on
the emotional expression, emotion regulation, and problem-solving subscales.

School achievement. School achievement was assessed with the Wide Range Achieve-
ment Test-Revised Spelling and Math scale scores (WRAT-R) [36]. The WRAT-R spelling and
math scales were chosen as the academic achievement assessment as it collects a considerable
amount of information in a short testing period (ranging from 15 to 45 minutes) and is easy to
administer [37]. The spelling subscale was a phonetic test that assessed the degree to which stu-
dents could encode sounds into written words. The math computation subscale measured stu-
dents’ ability to identify numbers, count, and solve written computational problems.

Emotional and behavioral dysregulation.

Internalizing symptoms (i.e., anxiety and

depression) and externalizing problems (i.e., attention and hyperactivity) were assessed via a
self-report version of the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2)
[38]. The BASC-2 evaluates the self-perception of youth’s feelings and behavior. Questions
about self-reported anxiety assessed worrying/nervousness (e.g., "I worry most of the day").
High levels of depression indicated youth experienced feelings of sadness, being overwhelmed,
or a lack of care (e.g., "I feel like I just don’t care anymore"). For attention problems, high
scores indicated problematic levels of paying attention (e.g., "I have trouble paying attention to
the teacher"), while a high score of hyperactivity suggested problematic levels of activity (e.g.,
"I have trouble sitting still").

Procedures

Pure Power is a yoga and mindfulness curriculum developed and delivered between 2014–
2018. The curriculum was delivered in K-8 suburban public schools. The school district serves
a historically underserved community. The University Institutional Review Board approved
this study, which complied with the Helsinki Declaration guidelines. Families were informed
of the curriculum and study prior to consenting. Signed assent forms were also obtained from
participating students. A consent form written in both English and Spanish was distributed to

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301028 April 4, 2024

PLOS ONEProgram evaluation of a mental health and wellness curriculum

families prior to the start of the study. Due to the sample size and minimal risk posed by the
study, a waiver of documentation of informed consent was obtained from the Institutional
Review Board and implemented with agreement from the participating schools. Researchers
explained the study to students prior to starting, and signed assent was obtained from all stu-
dents who agreed to participate. Students’ caregivers were given the opportunity to opt stu-
dents out of the study by signing and returning an opt-out form to the school.

The manualized Pure Power curriculum (pureedgeinc.org/curriculum) was delivered as an
assigned class by yoga instructors to students twice weekly. Full details on Pure Power instruc-
tors, including training procedures, are provided in Espil et al. [29]. Pure Power sessions took
place in designated school classrooms and were an average of 35 minutes. Children were sup-
plied with yoga mats. Fidelity measurements were taken from the beginning of class, through-
out the instruction, and ended when all youth finished the session. Study assessment measures
were administered in the classroom setting at the designated assessment time points (baseline
pre-intervention, 1-year follow-up, and approximate 2-year follow-up). Study personnel read
all RSQ and BASC-2 questions and answer options aloud. Students were instructed to silently
circle their answers and not share their answers with other students. Students received no
assistance on how to complete WRAT math or spelling problems.

Yoga and mindfulness instruction were delivered in four parts: open breathing, content
instruction, posture/movement instruction, and rest. Opening breathing: students were first
instructed in a brief breathing exercise. Examples of breathing exercises include "anchor
breathing" (i.e., placing hands on the chest or stomach, breathing to feel the body movement
with each breath, and focusing the mind) and more active breathing exercises (i.e., audibly
inhaling through and exhaling out the nose). Following the opening breathing exercise, stu-
dents would either transition to rest, a posture or movement task, or content instruction. Con-
tent instruction: the curriculum included brief, five-minute content instruction. Themes in
content instruction included different "powers," such as the power to tame temper, focus, be
calm, and cultivate growth. Modules also included topics about neuroscience. The content
delivery was flexible and could occur at any point in the curriculum, either as an independent
session segment or between yoga movements or rest. Posture/Movement instruction: the
majority (70%) of the session time was allotted to posture and movement instruction. Instruc-
tors were given a teaching guide from a manual. The general sequence of posture/movement
instruction was as follows: 1) warm-up postures, 2) balancing or standing poses, 3) backbends
and floor postures, and 4) closing poses that led to a final resting posture. Rest: during the rest
period (4 minutes), students were instructed to lie down on their backs, close their eyes, and
concentrate on breathing and sensations (curriculum is available at PureEdgeInc.org in both
English and Spanish).

Fidelity Observation Procedure. Details of fidelity training, assessment monitoring, and
outcomes are in Espil et al. (2021). Overall, the conclusion was that many aspects of the inter-
vention could be delivered with high reliability and that intervention fidelity varied by identi-
fied schools. We address this in the data analytic plan. More information about the structure
of fidelity monitoring and analysis is described by Espil et al. [29].

Design and data analysis plan

As noted above, due to variations in fidelity ratings across intervention schools and demo-
graphic characteristics of potential control schools, "matched pairs" were created that pair
high-fidelity intervention schools with demographically matched control schools. The pairs
were created by authors in the intervention team. When conducting the initial analyses, the
data analysis team was initially masked to intervention versus control groups. The outcome

was then presented to the intervention team and then unmasked for writing this report. In
total, there were four matched pairs ("Pair A," "Pair B," "Pair C," and "Pair D"), wherein the
intervention school in "Pair A" demonstrated the best fidelity, and the intervention school in
"Pair D" had relatively lower fidelity.

To determine differences in scores on the RSQ, BASC-2, and spelling and math achieve-
ment on the WRAT-R, we conducted 3-way repeated measures factorial ANOVA [2 (group) x
3 (time) x 4 (matched pairs)] for each outcome. In the event of significant interactions, post-
hoc analyses were performed to interpret patterns of interactions. All data were analyzed using
the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 28. With (n = 461) intervention stu-
dents (n = 420) in matched comparison schools, the study is well powered to identify all
repeated measures, between, and between -within interactions. Power analysis indicated suffi-
cient power to detect medium to large effects with power estimates well above.95. Power analy-
sis using G*Power [39, 40] indicated that the power to detect small effects for the most
complicated analyses (using effect size f = .1, and desired power = .95, alpha = .050, two tailed)
would require 912 denominator degrees of freedom and total n = 464. Power to detect small
effects with desired power = .80 (alpha = .050, two tailed) would require 608 denominator
degrees of freedom and total n = 312. The above suggests all analyses were power above.80
with most in the above.90-.95 range.

Results
Implementation

Upon completion of data collection, it was determined by the implementation team that not
all intervention-targeted schools adequately received the intervention protocol and that there
was general variability in implementation fidelity across schools. The implementation team
reviewed facilitator notes and fidelity data [29] and determined which schools maintained the
highest fidelity to the curriculum during implementation. For each school, an overall school-
specific fidelity score was calculated by computing the mean fidelity score across all fidelity rat-
ing items that were found to have statistically significant reliability. Based on the availability of
four control schools with sufficient sample data to conduct matched comparisons, the four
intervention schools with the highest overall mean fidelity rating scores were selected for
matching and further analysis. Of note, the four intervention schools with the highest overall
fidelity scores corresponded with the schools independently identified by the intervention
facilitators as having been most successful—with the overall highest quality of instruction and
fewest barriers to implementation—during the intervention period.

As noted, the implementation team then matched control schools to these treatment
schools based on grade range, school size, percentage of students receiving free or reduced
lunch, and percentage of students identified as English Language Learners. The implementa-
tion team then sent the data analysis team at ISU a masked data set. The exclusion of problem-
atic cases with invalid or concerning response patterns (as identified by “extreme caution”
results on BASC validity scales for the V “nonsensical” Index and Response Pattern Index) did
not alter analysis results or significant findings.

Outcomes. All missing data were handled analysis-by-analysis. Examination of the distri-
bution of scores indicated non-normal distribution across externalizing variables, with atten-
tion displaying a mildly high kurtosis of 2.10 at Time 1. When Mauchly’s test of sphericity
indicated the assumption of sphericity had been violated and equal variances could not be
assumed, the degrees of freedom for within-subjects effects were modified via the Green-
house-Geisser procedure. When equal variances could not be assumed, post-hoc tests were
supplemented with non-parametric alternatives (i.e., Friedman’s test). In the case of

differences in significant findings between parametric and non-parametric alternatives, differ-
ences are described in the supplement (S-p. 2).

RSQ coping: Primary control. ANOVA results for the RSQ primary control composite
and subscales are listed in Table 1. Overall, for the primary control composite, there was a sig-
nificant effect of time [F (1.91, 999.27) = 4.79, p < .01], no time x study group interaction, no
time x matched pair interaction, but there was a significant effect of time x study group x
matched pair [F (5.74, 999.27) = 2.40, p < .05]. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons indicated all
youth, regardless of the study group, scored lower on Time 1 compared to Time 2 (mean dif-
ference = .05, SE = .02, p < .05) and Time 3 (mean difference = .07, SE = .02, p < .001). This
effect is illustrated in Fig 2, and further details are provided in S1 Table in the supplemental
information, including n’s for all cells and detailed differences.

For the emotion regulation subscale, there was no effect of time, a significant time x study

group interaction [F (2, 1026) = 3.15, p < .05], no time x matched pair interaction, and no
effect of time x study group x matched pair. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that the
control group scored significantly higher than the intervention group at Time 1 (mean differ-
ence = .16, SE = .04, p < .001) with the intervention group scores increasing to the level of the
control group by Time 3. The finding is illustrated in Fig 2 (additional details in S2 Table).

For the emotion expression subscale, there was a significant effect of time [F (1.93, 997.92)
= 5.69, p < .05], no time x study group interaction, no time x matched pairs interaction, and a
significant effect of time x study group x matched pair [F (5.78, 997.92) = 2.47, p < .05]. Post-
hoc analyses on matched pairs suggested that effects were largest in Pair D. Matched pair
effects are detailed in supplemental information (S2 Table), and the overall effect is illustrated
in Fig 2. For the problem-solving subscale, there was a significant effect of time [F (1.96,
1011.31) = 5.18, p < .01] with scores increasing over time, no time x study group interaction,
no time x matched pair interaction, and no effect of time x study group x matched pair.

WRAT: Academic achievement. Repeated measures ANOVA results for academic

achievement scores are listed in Table 2 and effects are illustrated in Fig 3. For spelling scores,
results indicated there was a significant effect of time [F (1.93, 825.92) = 532.45, p < .001] with
scores increasing over time, a significant time x study group interaction [F (1.93, 825.92) =

and a significant effect of time x study group x matched pair [F (3.85, 825.92) = 9.80, p < .001].
Post-hoc analyses indicated the control group performed significantly higher (mean differ-
ence = 1.03, SE = .51, p < .05) than the intervention group at Time 1. However, at Time 2 and
Time 3, there were no significant differences in mean scores (p >.05). This interaction is plot-
ted in Fig 3. Additionally, the treatment group significantly improved scores from Time 1 to
Time 2 and Time 1 to Time 3. Further post-hoc analyses indicated that effects were largest in
Pair B (see S3 Table in supplement for details).

For math scores, results indicated a significant effect of time [F (1.79, 797.48) = 246.22, p <

.001] with scores increasing over time, a significant time x study group interaction [F (1.79,
797.48) = 4.06, p < .05], a significant time x matched pair interaction [F (5.38, 797.48) = 2.36,
p < .05], and a significant effect of time x study group x matched pair [F (3.58, 797.48) = 3.25,
p < .05]. Post-hoc analyses indicated the control group scored significantly higher than the
intervention group at Time 1 (mean difference = 1.54, SE = .47, p < .001) and Time 3 (mean
difference = 1.34, SE = .56, p < .05). There were no differences in math scores at Time 2. This
interaction is plotted in Fig 3. Further post-hoc analyses indicated that schools in Pair A per-
formed higher than other pairs at multiple time points. Full details are provided in S3 Table in
supplemental information.

There were no clear patterns of differential effects of the intervention on the BASC sub-
scales nor the RSQ Involuntary Engagement Composite or Subscales. Details of these analyses
are in the supplemental analyses text and in the S4–S7 Tables and S1 Checklist.

Discussion

Yoga and mindfulness instruction may aid in addressing the negative impacts of stress and
adversity on emotional and behavioral functioning in adults [14, 19]. Interest in the effective-
ness of mindfulness-based interventions such as yoga in primary schools has grown as an ave-
nue for primary prevention. This study adds to the literature which suggests some promise
[20–24]. On the positive side, exposure to the Pure Power curriculum was associated with
improved children’s coping skills, emotion regulation, indices of academics as measured by
spelling and math scores. However, consistent with previous literature [22, 23], our results
were mixed with a primary take-home finding that implementation (and therefore sustainabil-
ity) of the program is challenging. Schools demonstrated variability in the fidelity of interven-
tion implementation. For example, unforeseen circumstances had an impact on curriculum
delivery, such as cancellation of classes for health-related reasons, variability of support from
administration and teachers at individual schools, variability in how schools managed behav-
ioral concerns (e.g., sending students out of class instead of keeping them in class), and the
necessity to at times use substitute instructors, such as in the case of illness or injury, of which
who may not have had the same experience level and rapport with students as the regular
teacher. Program evaluation of these types of programs need to be flexible in fitting into the
routine and the unforeseen vicissitudes of the school context [7], such as variability in staff
support and facilities, as well as the complex logistics of delivering such programming [29]. To
address the sustainability of the program, the Pure Power curriculum has evolved to target

teachers as both targets of the training and facilitators of the intervention (https://pureedgeinc.
org/trainings/). Unlike Yoga instructors, teachers are trained in pedagogy in primary schools
and possibly better facilitators of the curriculum because of the training they have engaging a
room of school children. Further, in research evaluating yoga and mindfulness programs, it
will be important to measure and consider the fidelity of program implementation and to
incorporate fidelity measures into research design and analysis plans.

The data presented here adds to the literature and builds upon the implementation and
delivery fidelity data that were previously reported [29]. Unlike the study in 12–18-year-olds
who reported that youth significantly improved their internalizing scores as measured by the
BASC [25], we did not find differential effects on the BASC. Still, our findings were similar to a
study who did not report improvement scores of anxiety or depression on the BASC [27].
Again, unlike the study that did not find differential effects on the RSQ scales [26], we did find
differential effects. Improved spelling could reflect improved network connections since this
has been associated with spelling and math [41, 42] and with improved coping/emotion regu-
lation skills [43]; this may be particularly helpful for kids with limited resources, which reflects
the population of this study. Such improved emotion regulation may prevent the development
of PTSD [8, 44].

While this study adds to the existing knowledge, there are several limitations. The main
limitation is the non-randomized design. Thus, causal effects should not be interpreted, but
rather, findings should be interpreted similarly to other longitudinal designs examining tem-
poral associations. Although common in effectiveness trials conducting treatment research
in community mental health settings [45, 46], loss of data due to dropout at post-interven-
tion and follow-up may have lowered the ability to draw conclusions about treatment

outcomes. Another limitation is that multiple schools were not able to organize sufficient
time or space to implement the intervention. This limitation highlights that, while the pro-
gram may have feasibility, there is a need for additional work on implementation in certain
contexts [47]. Similarly, while we observed positive developmental trajectories in some out-
comes in the intervention group, not everyone improved on all outcomes at follow-up.
Finally, we did not measure academic outcomes with grades; we used spelling and math test
scores as rated by school administrators, counselors, or teachers using the WRAT-R. An
important future step will be to analyze academic outcomes in other areas and collect data
from other stakeholders.

In conclusion, challenges to implementing yoga and mindfulness-based programming in

real-life settings are vital to identify. This study provided some real-world evidence for the
effectiveness of a universal health and wellness curriculum on emotion regulation and positive
academic outcomes. Given the results, training school staff to effectively and consistently
deliver the intervention may foster implementation. Future research should test the effective-
ness of who delivers the intervention; for example, teacher-delivered groups vs. other wellness
personnel. Ideally, training school staff to deliver the intervention could foster implementation
by utilizing individuals trained in teaching grade-school classrooms. Testing the effectiveness
of teacher-delivered groups in contrast to external facilitators is an important future research
direction.
