The Paradox of Mental Health: Over-Treatment and
Under-Recognition

The PLOSMedicineEditors*

Among all the conditions in the world of
health, mental health occupies a unique
and paradoxical place.

On the one hand is over-treatment and
over-medicalization of mental health is-
sues, often fueled by a pharmaceutical
industry interested in the broadening of
the boundaries of
‘‘illness’’ and in the
creation of more and wider diagnostic
categories and thus markets for ‘‘selling
sickness.’’ On the other hand exists
profound under-recognition of the suffer-
ing and breadth of mental health issues
affecting millions of people across geogra-
phies, which is a global problem.

As a journal, PLOS Medicine has covered
both sides of the mental health ‘‘coin,’’ and
we continue to make mental health in
general a priority area. We recognize that
the whole of the field of mental health
research is relatively underdeveloped, and
that a particular scarcity of clinical trials
exists from outside high-income settings
and for non-drug interventions. As a result,
we also support efforts to improve capacity
in mental health research whilst commit-
ting to the publication of the state of the art
in research and commentary [1,2].

Over-treatment, especially when it re-
sults
is a
from ‘‘disease mongering,’’
persistent and troubling issue. The harms
of over-treatment arise from situations
life experiences (such as
where normal
are
menopause,
deemed illnesses [3] or when diseases are
‘‘created’’ from mild problems and symp-
syndrome or
toms
female sexual dysfunction) [4,5]. In both
situations, people become patients, and
their problems are deemed to need
medical
treatment when they may not
need it or could be harmed by it, or when
nonmedical options are available. Over-
diagnosis and over-treatment have been
shown for a range of human conditions
[3], but this phenomenon as it relates to
mental health is particularly powerful [6].
For example, the widespread over-diagno-
sis of conditions such as bipolar disorder,
autism spectrum disorder, and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorders
(ADHD),
especially among children, is now being
documented—the US Centers for Disease

Control recently estimated that 6.4 million
children aged 4 to 17 had received an
ADHD diagnosis at some point in their
lives
(amounting to 11% of all US
children)—a 41% increase in the last
decade that has been met with alarm
and concern by many doctors and parents
[7]. Two thirds of these children are said
to be on medication for the condition.
Recent Canadian data [8] reaffirm the
concerns with excessive labeling of normal
child behavior as pathological. Over-
diagnosis in mental health risks unneces-
sary tests and treatment,
the stigma
associated with being labeled mentally ill,
testing,
and the considerable costs of
treatment, and wasting resources
that
could be better utilized elsewhere [3,5].

The recent DSM-5 process is a lightning
rod for these concerns: this month’s update
of the psychiatric diagnostic manual has
been widely criticized for continuing the
tradition of broadening diagnostic categories
and adding new conditions that redefine
more people as having mental illness and in
need of pharmaceutical treatment [9,10].
That decisions about DSM-5 categories are
made by experts with financial ties to the
industry that benefits most from a widened
patient population [11,12],
is particularly
worrying.

In perhaps the most dedicated venue for
discussions of this topic, the Selling Sickness
(http://www.sellingsickness.
conferences
com), which PLOS Medicine has been instru-

in shaping, have brought together
mental
academic researchers, medical reformers,
consumer advocates, and health journalists
with shared interests
in examining the
problem of disease mongering and develop-
ing strategies and coalitions for change. The
inaugural conference in 2006 coincided with
our launch of the PLOS Medicine Disease
Mongering Collection (http://bit.ly/18i6j6h)
that to this day remains astonishingly rele-
vant. In February 2013 we participated
again, this time in a roundtable on the role
of the medical media where we outlined our
responsibility as editors to avoid the spin in
published articles and the journal’s press
releases that can fuel hype about new disease
categories and treatment
[13]; we also
highlighted another important role of jour-
nals in fighting disease mongering: to require
that all clinical trials be registered and data be
reported and shared, so that the full picture of
the benefits and harms of tested interventions
can be seen (see, for example, http://www.
alltrials.net). The conference’s Call to Action
petition
(http://sellingsickness.com/final-
statement/) is available for readers to view
two comrade
and sign. Later in 2013,
conferences, PharmedOut
(http://www.
pharmedout.org/) and Avoiding Overdiag-
nosis
(http://www.preventingoverdiagnosis.
net/), will continue the conversation about
both the extent and the prevention of over-
diagnosis, and will undoubtedly provide new
insights into the problems associated with
over-treatment of mental health.

Equally important, however, is the vast
under-recognition of mental health condi-
tions, especially in the developing world.
This neglect has occurred at multiple
levels including at the national level, where
many countries have failed to establish
adequate mental health policy. At the level
of global health agendas, mental health
was essentially ignored in the Millennium
Development Goal program and failed to
elevate to prominence at the recent United
Nations special assembly on non-commu-
nicable disease.

As many others have noted [14–16],
this neglect makes little sense: more than
13% of the global burden of disease is
attributable to neuropsychiatric disorders,
and over 70% of this burden lies in low-
and middle-income countries
(LMICs).
Almost a quarter of the world’s disability
burden is now attributable to mental and
behavioral disorders (including depression,
anxiety, Alzheimer disease, and schizo-
phrenia) [17]. And yet mental health has
far to receive the political
failed thus
funding com-
priority and international
mensurate with its global toll [14]. There
are signs this tide is shifting, and several
prominent groups and organizations are
working to raise the profile of global
mental health. PLOS Medicine has provided
a forum for that effort over the last few
years, publishing packages of care for
mental health disorders in LMICs [18]

In addition, we’ve recently published
high-quality research on a range of topics
within mental health that contributes to
improved clinical practice, policy, and
action. This includes definitive evidence
on the long-term health consequences of
sexual abuse [20] and trafficking [21], a
genome-wide analysis
establishing the
limited ability of genetic data to predict
antidepressant response [22], and a meta-
analysis reporting the relative benefits and
harms of adjunctive antipsychotic medica-
tions in depression [23]. These studies add
to a growing evidence base, and signal a
growing recognition of the importance of
mental health.

Still, our understanding of all aspects of
mental health is relatively underdevel-

and harm from over-treatment remains
limited, and so the new initiatives and calls
