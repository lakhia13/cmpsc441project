Abstract: Background: Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRVB) is a treatment in which patients
learn self-regulation of a physiological dysregulated vagal nerve function. While the therapeutic
approach of HRVB is promising for a variety of disorders, it has not yet been regularly offered
in a mental health treatment setting. Aim: To provide a systematic review about the efﬁcacy
of HRV-Biofeedback in treatment of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders. Method:
Systematic review in PubMed and Web of Science in 2020 with terms HRV, biofeedback, Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, panic disorder, and anxiety disorder. Selection, critical
appraisal, and description of the Random Controlled Trials (RCT) studies. Combined with recent
meta-analyses. Results: The search resulted in a total of 881 studies. After critical appraisal, nine
RCTs have been selected as well as two other relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups
treatment as usual, muscle relaxation training and a “placebo“-biofeedback instrument revealed
signiﬁcant clinical efﬁcacy and better results compared with control conditions, mostly signiﬁcant.
In the depression studies average reduction at the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale was 64%
(HRVB plus Treatment as Usual (TAU) versus 25% (control group with TAU) and 30% reduction
(HRVB) at the PSQ scale versus 7% (control group with TAU). In the PTSD studies average reduction
at the BDI-scale was 53% (HRV plus TAU) versus 24% (control group with TAU) and 22% (HRVB)
versus 10% (TAU) with the PTSD Checklist (PCL). In other systematic reviews signiﬁcant effects
have been shown for HRV-Biofeedback in treatment of asthma, coronary artery disease, sleeping
disorders, postpartum depression and stress and anxiety. Conclusion: This systematic review
shows signiﬁcant improvement of the non-invasive HRVB training in stress related disorders like
PTSD, depression, and panic disorder, in particular when combined with cognitive behavioral
therapy or different TAU. Effects were visible after four weeks of training, but clinical practice in a
longer daily self-treatment of eight weeks is more promising. More research to integrate HRVB in
treatment of stress related disorders in psychiatry is warranted, as well as research focused on the
neurophysiological mechanisms.

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a neurobiological marker of the autonomic nervous
system (ANS) with decreased HRV indices being associated with a variety of negative
physical and psychological outcomes [1–5]. Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRVB) is

a non-invasive treatment, in which patients are assumed to self-regulate a physiological
dysregulated vagal nerve function by restoring the autonomic homeostasis [6–8]. This is
relevant for stress-related disorders such as sleep disorders, anxiety, asthma, ﬁbromyalgia,
recovery of heart failure, and others. In this time of COVID-19 more knowledge about self-
control, Digital Health and a balance in the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is relevant.
HRVB affects cardiovascular homeostatic reﬂexes by increasing ﬂexibility and recov-
ery from ﬁght or ﬂight adaptive situations [9]. Thousands of studies have been published
about HRV and HRVB. Most of the studies are focused on HRV as marker for instance as
predictor of physical outcomes anxiety disorders and PTSD, cancer recovery [10–13]. HRVB
has been characterized as making visible the neurophysiological effect of meditation [14].
Work-related stress develops gradually and effects both the physical and mental health of
those experiencing it, which can eventually lead to burnout. Work related stress symptoms
include insomnia, sleep disturbances, menstrual disorders, irritation, and depression [2].
HRV represents the ability to adapt to stress and is a marker of physiological stress [1].
Higher HRV amplitude indicates better self-regulation and is associated with lower cardio-
vascular risk and alleviating symptoms of stress, anxiety [15–17]. A recent meta-analysis
afﬁrms the efﬁcacy of HRVB with wearable devices on self-reported stress [18].

In this study different HRV-Biofeedback devices are reported like StressEraser, Inﬁnity
HRV-Biofeedback and Balance Manager. In this study we will focus on HRV-Biofeedback
studies as additional treatment in clinical practice.

In 1996, the Taskforce of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American
Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology formulated deﬁnitions of the various HRV met-
rics [1]. These international standards: High Frequency(HF), Very Low Frequency(VLF),
and Low Frequency(LF) are derived by spectral analysis of the interbeat interval (RR).

VLF (very low frequency = 0.003–0.04 Hz), when measured over long time frames,
has been interpreted as reﬂecting sympathetic activity (Action); LF (low frequency = 0.04–
0.15 Hz) reﬂects the combination of sympathetic and vagal balance (Balance), though recent
studies have questioned this interpretation, and HF (high frequency = 0.15–0.4 Hz) is
interpreted as reﬂecting vagal activity (Calm/sleepy) (see Figure 2).

We can describe this as ABC: Action, Balance, or Calm/Sleepy, where A indicates

dominance of VLF (Action in the mind or body)

B indicates Balance between sympathetic and vagal activity or LF, and C indicates

dominance of HF (Calm/sleepy) (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. HRV (Heart Rate Variability) patterns (tachogram).

Autonomic Balance is the marker of the state of the ANS. Unconscious perception of
safety is reﬂected in higher HF values, while threat produces HF (vagal) withdrawal and
sympathetic activation. Autonomic balance is deﬁned in terms of complex heart rate (HR)
patterns that increase and decrease in response to respiratory ﬂuctuations (Figure 2).

Figure 2. HRV as composition of 3 oscillation processes [7]

However, when clients shift to slow effortless breathing patterns (as shown above),
they stimulate reﬂexes in the Autonomous Nervous System (ANS) and Central Nervous
system (CNS) that, over time, “rewire” these systems so as to enhance ANS ﬂexibility. This
formula, during slow effortless breathing, LF: (VLF+LF+HF) can be used as an index of the
client’s success in achieving their training goals. This formula is used in HRV-Biofeedback
instruments Balance Manager and StressEraser Pro. After 20 years of research and clinical
work, this formula was maybe more effective than LF:HF.

HRVB is a natural oscillation between the breathing cycle and heartrate. Inhalation
temporarily suppresses vagal activity, causing a decrease in the inter-beat interval and
an increase in heart rate; exhalation activates vagal activity, causing an increase in the
inter-beat interval and a decrease in heart rate [19]. Heart rate is a dynamic function that
varies in each moment. An HRV pattern (tachogram) is a composition of three oscillation
processes: Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), baroreﬂex, and vascular rhythm [19].

Until 1996, HRV was primarily used as marker of the autonomic nervous system, but
in 1996 Paul Lehrer (in collaboration with Evgeny Vaschillo) reported the observation that
if you breath in the frequency of the baroreceptor and you slow down the tertiary oscillator
(quietly not moving too much) than the ANS come into autonomic balance.

The body can be brought into the state of autonomic balance through guided breathing
with HRV-Biofeedback. Breathing in the resonance frequency (between 0.05 and 0.15 Hz,
which is the same as 4–7 breaths per minute) can be compared to guiding someone on a
swing by pushing the swing at the correct moment to optimize their swing (resonance).
Breathing at resonance frequency trains the reﬂexes of the cardiovascular system, in particu-
lar the baroreﬂex [19]. Breathing in the resonance frequency (resonance between respiratory
and baroreﬂex rhythms) and using HRV-Biofeedback creates autonomic balance in the
ANS and in this study we will show the effects of training Autonomic Balance with HRVB.
Long standing stress, PTSD and traumatic incidents can disturb stability of the Vagus
nerve and create complex disturbances in heartbeat, HRV and hyperarousal, allowing
overactivation in the Sympathetic Nervous System [6,20,21]. Our nervous system is con-
tinuously evaluating risk in the environment through an unconscious process of neuro-
ception [22]. That is why it is innovative and important to integrate neurophysiological
body-focused and self-regulating methods like HRVB in treatment of depression, trauma,
and anxiety [23,24]. Reduced HRV amplitude has been found in patients with major de-
pression disorder (MDD) [25]. HRV is a biological marker of the autonomic nervous system

2. Method

In 2016, we published a systematic review and we now present an updated systematic
review [7]. This review is based on searches in PubMed and Web of Science with an
evidence- based critical review based on the GRADE method [27]. GRADE means Grades
of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation. GRADE can be compared
to the Prisma Statement with search terms: HRV (and synonyms) combined with PTSD,
combat disorder, depression, depressed mood, anxiety, panic disorder (Figure 3).

Studies were screened by title and summary. This produced 881 articles. These articles
have been judged by two raters with GRADE criteria, based on relevance (design, valida-

3.1. HRVB as Additional Treatment of Depression

One of the ﬁrst single blind RCT HRVB studies was focused on 46 female depressed
welfare-to-work recipients in California. The HRVB-group (n = 20) and the control group
treated by progressive muscle relaxation (n = 26) received antidepressant medicine [30,40].
The HRVB group showed signiﬁcant reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)
score from 35.0 (SD 8.0) towards 17, (SD 12.6) in the ﬁrst 4 weeks and after 8 weeks even
towards 7.8. In the control group, reduction was smaller: from 30.1 (SD 10.2) towards 16.9
(SD 13.3) in 8 weeks. Reduction of 78% HRVB, versus 44% in the control group.

Another early RCT study with StressEraser focused on 60 patients after myocard
infarct [31]. HRVB was integrated with dialectic behavioral therapy in conjunction with
sertraline medication. The control group only used sertraline medication. The reduction
on BDI scale was 76% after 12 weeks daily exercising 20 min with HRVB (BDI from 30.9
towards 7.5) versus 29% reduction in control group (BDI from 30.5 towards 22.0).

A third RCT as a bio behavioral intervention for depressive symptoms in patients after
cardiac surgery was in Italy [32]. HRVB group and control group, TAU group, received
both TAU that consisted of daily counseling sessions such as dietary and smoking cessation
counseling, weight management, and stress-management according to the guidelines of
the American Heart Association and the American Association of Cardiovascular and
Pulmonary Rehabilitation. The HRVB group added 2 weeks of daily 45 min biofeedback.
The signiﬁcant reduction measured by CES-D (Centre Epidemiological Study-Depression)
scale after 2 weeks was 42% compared with the control group’s 1% reduction.

The psychophysiological mechanisms underlying depression as a risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease, cardiac morbidity, and fatal cardiac events after surgery are still debated.
In the Netherlands, a scientiﬁc clinical consortium called Beneﬁt is focusing on cardiac
rehabilitation and prevention of cardiac diseases using lifestyle interventions and self-
regulation programs such as non-smoking programs, personal lifestyle coaching, blended
care with eHealth, HRV-Biofeedback, and mindfulness.

Another study in the Netherlands (University of Amsterdam), in cooperation with
Paul Lehrer (USA), is a randomized controlled trial with 20 pregnant and 30 non-pregnant
women, mean age 31.6 years [33,41]. The intervention consisted of a 5-week HRVB training
with weekly 60–90 min sessions and daily exercises with StressEraser. Research has
convincingly shown that high levels of maternal stress, anxiety, and depression during
pregnancy are not only harmful for the women herself, but may also affect the child she
is carrying. The control group was a wait-list group. The Depression Anxiety Stress
Scale (DASS) and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered pre- and post-
intervention. Effect sizes were larger in the HRVB group on all scales. The DASS depression
scale women started with a score of 5.45 and after 5 weeks went down to 2.8 (reduction
49%). The wait-list reduction was 35%.

In total, two studies of the Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan were selected
for review: HRVB with heroin users with depressive symptoms and patients with Major
Depression Disorder [37,38]. The prevalence of major depressive episodes among heroin
users has been found to be 25%. The nine participants had weekly sessions with HRVB
software. They had a reduction of 20% on the BDI depression scale, and 25% on the BDI
cognitive depression scale.

In 2019, at Kaohsiung Medical University, there was a RCT study with 48 participants
with MDD depression and insomnia [38]. The HRVB group received weekly 60-min
sessions for 6 weeks, and the control group received medical care only. The signiﬁcant
reduction at the BDI-II scale was 38 versus 1% in the control group. The signiﬁcant
reduction on the sleep disorder scale (PSQI) was 28% in the HRVB group and 5% in the
control group. In 2019, at Alliant University in San Diego USA, a dissertation was presented
with 37 participants with MDD and a Latino background [36]. There are different factors
that appear to limit the access and quality of mental health care for Latinos, including lack
of insurance, cultural barriers, stigma, distrust of medical providers, expression of distress,
and fear of deportation. The HRVB participants received four HRV-Biofeedback sessions,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3329

were trained in diafragmatic breathing and ﬁnding their personal resonance frequency.
They were provided with an app to be used as a pacer for daily exercising 10–20 min during
4 weeks in addition to sessions with their psychotherapist.

TAU participants completed four consecutive weeks of psychotherapy. Pre- and
post-tests show 39.9% reduction in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): from 16.42
(SD2.93) towards 10.85 (SD6.81). With the TAU group reduction was 6.6% from 17.70 (SD
4.61) towards 16.52 (SD 6.57). In the Anxiety test (GAD-7) reduction was 41.3%: from 11.08
(SD3.40) towards 6.50 (SD3.37) versus TAU 8.8% reduction: from 15.36 (SD 4.41) towards
14.00 (SD4.56).

3.2. HRVB as Additional Treatment of PTSD

Although the connection between HRV and PTSD was already well-known the ﬁrst
RCT study of HRVB and PTSD was reported in 2009 [28,42–44]. In total, 76 participants
were recruited from an urban residential therapeutic community program for the treatment
of PTSD with comorbid substance use disorder. After randomization, 38 participants joined
the 4 weeks daily program. The HRVB group trained 20 min daily with the StressEraser and
the control group received daily 20 min Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR). The HRVB
group had signiﬁcantly (p = 0.001) greater reductions in depression scores compared to
PMR (Progressive Muscle Relaxation) In HRVB group BDI-II reduced 53% (from 26.4 to 12.3)
and 24% (from 25.95 to 19.47). On the scale, 29–63 = severe depression; 20–28 = moderate
depression; 14–19 = mild depression; 0–13 = minimal depression. Reduction on PCL scale
was 27% (HRVB) compared to 18% (PMR).

A second RCT study, with PTSD and HRVB, was focused on participants of US
Department of Veteran Affairs—MEDVAMC [29].
In an 8 weeks program of weekly
sessions with the Resonance Frequency protocol of Lehrer et al., veterans were trained in
autonomic balance.

PCL score reduced signiﬁcantly by 16% with HRVB while the TAU control group
(only TAU) reduction after 8 weeks was 9% (not signiﬁcant). Patients reported a satis-
faction score of 8 (scale 1–10) and more than 50% wanted to continue using breathing in
resonance frequency.

In 2014 a systematic review for psychiatric disorders with integration of treatment with
HRVB was published [45]. In 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis was published
showing HRVB improves emotional and physical health, and performance [46]. Their
initial review yielded 1868 papers from which 58 met inclusion criteria. HRVB has the
largest effect sizes for depression (Hedge g = −0.72 and p < 0.0005), anger (g = −0.54
and p < 0.02), emotion regulation (g = −0.34 and p < 0.0005), asthma (g = −1.357), and
athletic performance (g = −90), and smaller effect sizes on PTSD (g = 0.29) and quality
of life (g = 0.14). The average effect size of the 58 studies for HRVB and paced breathing
versus control conditions was found to be small to medium Hedge g = 0.37. High effect
size g = −0.8 medium effect size: g = −0.5 and small effect size: g = −0.2.

In our study, we focalized on Depression, PTSD and Anxiety and with the GRADE
method we got a smaller selection of 10 studies. Most of the selected studies showed a large
effect size [46]: [28] PTSD study: g = −0.739 [29] PTSD study: g = −0.296 [30] Depression:
g = −0.748 [32] Depression: g = −0.958

4. Discussion

In the ﬁrst review of RCT studies of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback the conclusion
was: “a number of research studies have given at least tentative support for the effectiveness
of HRVB for a wide range of medical and emotional disorders.” [19].

While the ﬁrst studies and RCTs were mostly done in USA, you can see the emergence
of high quality studies from all over the world (Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and
the UK, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Brazil, and Australia).

In our manuscript the systematic review is focused on depression, PTSD, and anxiety.
Effects were visible after 4 weeks of HRVB-training, but clinical practice in a longer daily
self-treatment of 8 weeks showed more reduction on the BDI. Daily HRV-Biofeedback was
more effective than weekly training, as we see in the studies of Rene and Chaudri with the
StressEraser [31,40]. Perhaps three 8 min a day or two 10 min a day sessions are the most
effective7.

Interestingly, in the systematic review it was stated: “an interesting implication of our
ﬁndings is that length of treatment and home practice does not inﬂuence the effect size.
Perhaps learning how to breathe at resonance frequency provides a sufﬁcient method for
most of the beneﬁcial effects.”(p. 125) [46].

The StressEraser, used in many of the HRVB studies was a noninvasive portable
handheld device attempting to increase RSA using a respiratory training system. A highly
sensitive infrared light sensor detects tiny changes in the rate at which blood pulses through
the ﬁngertip. The ﬁnger sensor has a photoplethysmograph to identify every pulse. The
StressEraser (Figure 4a) was a very effective device, because the resonance frequency
(resonance between heart rhythm and breathing rhythm) was automatically seen on the
screen. StressEraser is not any more available since 2015. However, the StressEraser Pro
(Figure 4b) has been developed for iPhone with more detailed information of HRV patterns:

In this StressEraser Pro, you can read the tachogram, the frequency spectre with VLF
(Orange), LF (purple), and HF (green) and the training effect score: LF/(VLF+ LF + HF).

For Samsung phones the HRV biofeedback device ResCalm (Figure 5) has been devel-
oped in South Korea with 10 playful wave patterns like hills, mountains, and motivating
wave movements. Data deﬁnition is the same as the Balance Manager (Figure 6) for
Windows computer.

Additionally, in the Inﬁnity HRV biofeedback devices (Figure 7), playful pictures are

effective in the treatment.

Figure 7. Inﬁnity biofeedback.

All these devices were very effective, because users can install their personal frequency
and their preferred rate of inhalation–exhalation. While searching for different systematic
reviews, we also found a study that used HRV-Biofeedback devices that only used the
frequency of 0.1 Hz [63]. That study did not show signiﬁcant results compared with the
devices where a client can install a personal breathing frequency like Balance Manager,
StressEraser Pro, and Inﬁnity.

In spite of the signiﬁcance and efﬁcacy of HRVB showed in this systematic review
HRVB is not yet integrated into standard treatment. One of the most popular therapies
is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) [64]. In most trials ACT is reported to be
superior or equally effective as cognitive behavioral therapy [65].Maybe it would be more
efﬁcient for our health system to integrate psychophysiology like ACT, HRV-Biofeedback
and mindfulness in treatment of depression, PTSD, and anxiety disorders, because of the
efﬁcacy, more self-control of the client, and lowering the cost of treatment [66].

Limitations

The search strategy was bias-free but limited to articles published in English.

5. Conclusions

More than 4000 studies that investigated HRV, show the relevance of HRV in neuro-
science related to a range of medical and emotional disorders and especially stress related

disorders. Stress related disorders have a connection to a disturbance of the Autonomic
Nervous System and a dysregulated Vagus nerve.

This systematic review shows signiﬁcant improvement of the non-invasive HRVB
training in stress related disorders like PTSD, depression and panic disorder, in particular
when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy or other TAU.

After critical appraisal from the 881 studies about depression, PTSD and anxiety, eight
RCT studies and two related studies have been selected. The RCTs with control groups
treatment as usual combined with muscle relaxation training, and a “placebo“-biofeedback
instrument revealed signiﬁcant clinical efﬁcacy and better results compared with control
conditions, mostly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001).

In the depression studies average reduction at the Beck Depression Inventory scale
was 64% (HRVB plus TAU) versus 25% (control group with TAU) and 30% reduction
(HRVB) at the PSQ scale versus 7% (control group with TAU).

In the PTSD studies average reduction at the BDI scale was 53% (HRVB plus TAU)
versus 24% (control group with TAU) and 22% (HRVB) versus 10% (TAU) with the PCL
scale. Even with studies with groups from 26 to 60 participants there is signiﬁcance efﬁcacy,
so the effect size is very interesting.

In the different meta-analyses, signiﬁcant effects have been shown of HRVB in treat-
ment of asthma, angina pectoris, coronary artery disease, sleeping disorders, prevention of
postpartum depression, and stress and anxiety.

More research on the integration of HRVB in the treatment of stress related disor-
ders in psychiatry is warranted. In addition, research focused on the neurophysiological
mechanisms will solidify the scientiﬁc basis of HRVB.

Nevertheless, because ﬁnancial support for behavioral research has not reached the
level necessary to test thousands of, meta-analysis may be the best alternative for evaluating
these effects.
