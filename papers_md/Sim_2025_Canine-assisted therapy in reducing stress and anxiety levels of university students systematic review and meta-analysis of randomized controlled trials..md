Abstract
Background  Due to the high prevalence of mental health issues among university students worldwide, canine-
assisted therapy (CAT) has emerged as a potential intervention to reduce student stress and anxiety. This study 
systematically reviews and meta-analyzes the effects of CAT on reducing stress and anxiety levels among university 
students.

Methods  Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we conducted a systematic search across multiple databases (APA 
PsycINFO, PubMed, Duke Libraries, CNKI, Wanfang, and Google Scholar) for randomized controlled trials published 
in English and Chinese. Only studies incorporating professionally trained dogs and handlers were included. Two 
reviewers (SS and ZL) independently extracted data, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
2 tool. Effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to account for the anticipated clinical 
and methodological heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore moderators such as intervention 
duration, baseline stress levels, and control condition types. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Egger’s 
test, and trim-and-fill analysis.

Results  Of 290 identified studies, 15 met the inclusion criteria and 14 were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-
analysis yielded a statistically significant overall effect size of g = -0.67 (p <.001), indicating a moderate reduction 
in stress and anxiety among university students receiving CAT. Forest plots revealed effect sizes ranging from 
approximately − 1.34 to -0.13 across studies. Although substantial heterogeneity was observed, subgroup analyses 
showed that CAT was significantly more effective for students with high baseline stress and anxiety levels. Funnel-plot 
asymmetry suggested possible bias, but Egger’s test was non-significant. Trim-and-fill analysis imputed two missing 
studies, adjusting the pooled effect to g = -0.59, indicating the findings remain robust.

Conclusion  CAT demonstrates promise in alleviating stress and anxiety among university students. Despite 
methodological variations and potential publication bias, the findings suggest that CAT may offer a feasible and

Background
Discussions  are  increasingly  pointing  to  a  growing  cri-
sis  in  student  mental  health  [1].  In  2021  alone,  approxi-
mately  73%  of  students  in  the  United  States  reported 
persistent  psychological  distress,  a  significant  increase 
since  2013,  reflecting  a  50%  rise  in  mental  health  chal-
lenges  within  this  population  [2].  The  causes  of  these 
issues  include  academic  workload  pressure,  loneliness, 
inadequate  sleep,  and  being  away  from  family  [3].  Pro-
longed exposure to stress can contribute to the develop-
ment  of  more  severe  mental  health  conditions,  further 
increasing  anxiety  rates  among  university  students  [4]. 
Understanding  different  approaches  to  intervening  in 
anxiety  and  stress  is  crucial,  as  these  issues  significantly 
affect  students’  daily  functioning,  life  satisfaction,  and 
overall quality of life [5, 6]. When left unaddressed, stress 
and anxiety are associated with risk factors such as aca-
demic  burnout,  relationship  difficulties,  decreased  pro-
ductivity,  and  increased  dropout  rates  [7].  In  extreme 
cases, students may adopt maladaptive coping strategies, 
including  excessive  alcohol  consumption,  social  with-
drawal, avoidance behaviors and even suicidal tendencies 
[5].

In  response  to  the  impact  of  stress  on  both  academic 
performance  and  overall  well-being,  universities  have 
introduced  various  stress-reduction  interventions  such 
as  mindfulness  programs,  peer  support  groups,  and  on-
campus counseling services [8, 9]. However, the effective-
ness  of  these  interventions  remains  inconsistent  due  to 
underutilization  and  low  student  uptake.  Peer  support 
may  deter  students  from  disclosing  personal  issues  to 
their peers, while mindfulness programs face operational 
challenges: universities must invest in staff training, pro-
gram  delivery,  and  materials,  and  students  must  dedi-
cate  considerable  time  and  effort  to  learn  and  maintain 
mindfulness  practices  [10,  11].  On-campus  counseling 
services are often strained under high demand, leading to 
long waiting times for students and increased counselor 
burnout and turnover [12]. Clinical interventions require 
qualified  professionals  and  depend  heavily  on  student 
motivation  and  engagement,  which  can  further  limit 
their  accessibility  and  impact  [13].  Given  these  consid-
erations,  there  is  a  need  for  interventions  that  are  more 
accessible  and  convenient  for  students,  making  canine-
assisted therapy a promising option.

Canine-assisted  therapy  is  a  complementary  interven-
tion using professionally trained dogs to enhance individ-
uals’ physical, social, emotional, or cognitive functioning 

[14,  15].  Therapy  dogs  and  their  handlers  undergo  spe-
cialized  training  to  ensure  that  interactions  are  benefi-
cial  and  secure  [15].  Often  referred  to  as  humans’  best 
friends, therapy dogs have been successfully incorporated 
into various settings, including nursing homes, hospitals, 
and  schools,  tailored  to  diverse  populations  [16].  Even 
briefly  interacting,  such  as  hugging,  petting,  and  sitting 
next to therapy dogs, can lower levels of stress hormones 
like  epinephrine  and  norepinephrine,  increase  endor-
phin  levels  and  oxytocin,  leading  to  decreased  stress, 
anxiety, and pain, improve mood, and better social bond-
ing [15]. Recent studies have shown that canine-assisted 
therapy effectively reduces stress among nurses [17] and 
enhances the quality of life for Alzheimer’s patients [18].
Practically,  canine-assisted  therapy  is  relatively  inex-
pensive, as dogs are easily transportable and can engage 
with  a  larger  number  of  people  during  a  single  drop-in 
session,  making  it  a  cost-effective  option  for  university-
based  interventions  [19].  A  report  indicated  that  62% 
of  surveyed  universities  in  the  United  States  provide 
animal-assisted  therapy  (AAT)  programs,  the  majority 
of  which  exclusively  involved  dogs  [20].  This  suggests 
that  canine-assisted  therapy  is  a  viable  intervention  for 
addressing the escalating mental health concerns in uni-
versities, particularly given the high burnout rate among 
counselors and the financial implications of hiring more 
professional counselors [12].

Theoretically,  canine-assisted  therapy  (CAT)  is  based 
on social support theory, offering a source of social con-
nectedness  and  combating  feelings  of  loneliness  and 
isolation  [21].  Social  support,  as  defined  by  Thoits  [22], 
refers  to  the  social  resources  individuals  can  rely  on 
when dealing with life challenges and stressors. Accord-
ing to this theory, social support has several dimensions: 
First,  social  support  can  be  conceptualized  as  perceived 
support,  reflecting  an  individual’s  belief  that  support  is 
available  when  needed  [22].  Second,  support  can  take 
various  forms:  instrumental,  informational,  or  emo-
tional. CAT primarily provides emotional support, which 
involves  expressions  of  sympathy,  caring,  esteem,  value, 
or encouragement [23]. Additionally, such social relation-
ships  extend  beyond  human  interactions  to  encompass 
connections  with  animals.  As  McNicholas  and  Collis 
[24] noted, pets can complement existing human support 
networks  and,  in  some  cases,  even  serve  as  substitutes 
for  lacking  human  connections.  Pets  provide  support 
that  releases  individuals  from  relationship  obligations, 
facilitates  reorganization,  and  helps  rebuild  routines.  In 

Sim et al. BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies          (2025) 25:303 Page 3 of 15

this  context,  CAT  presents  a  unique  type  of  social  sup-
port  that  nurtures  emotional  connection  in  individuals. 
Furthermore,  having  a  supportive  social  network  has  a 
direct impact on wellbeing, especially when it is large and 
is perceived to offer support, which can improve quality 
of life and reduce stress [25]. Consequently, the dogs and 
handlers involved in CAT play a crucial role in engaging 
individuals in social interactions and offering social sup-
port, thereby buffering them from stress and anxiety [21].
Recognizing  that  heightened  stress  and  anxiety  can 
decrease  students’  quality  of  life  and  performance  [26], 
CAT  has  emerged  as  a  promising  intervention  across 
diverse  populations.  Previous  research  has  linked  CAT 
and  animal-assisted 
interventions  to  mental  health 
improvements  such  as  reduced  anxiety  and  pain-related 
symptoms in children [27, 28], as well as decreased PTSD 
symptoms  in  mixed-age  samples  [29,  30].  These  find-
ings support CAT’s broader potential as an intervention 
for  promoting  psychological  well-being.  Despite  this, 
research specifically examining CAT’s impact within uni-
versity settings remains limited. We identified nine rele-
vant meta-analyses on animal-assisted therapy (Table 1), 
but  only  one  focused  on  higher  education  [31].  While 
Huber  et  al.  [31]  explored  a  range  of  mental,  cognitive, 
and  physiological  outcomes,  with  stress  and  anxiety  as 
only part of the focus, their review also included general 
animal-assisted  interventions  (AAIs)  involving  various 
animals beyond dogs. Although that work provides help-
ful insights, our study takes a more focused approach to 
examine professionally facilitated CAT and its effects on 
stress and anxiety in university students. By doing so, we 
aim  to  build  on  existing  literature  and  provide  a  clearer 

picture  of  how  CAT  may  help  support  mental  health  in 
this population.

Therefore, this paper aims to systematically review the 
effectiveness  of  canine-assisted  therapy  (CAT)  in  reduc-
ing  stress  and  anxiety  among  university  students.  To 
address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis focusing 
specifically  on  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  to 
establish  a  robust  cause-and-effect  relationship  between 
CAT  and  mental  health  outcomes.  By  synthesizing  evi-
dence  from  these  trials,  we  aim  to  provide  a  clearer 
understanding  of  CAT’s  potential  in  supporting  student 
mental wellness.

Methods
PROSPERO registration

Our  systematic  review  and  meta-analyses  were  devel-
oped  following  the  PRISMA  2020  statement  [36].  As  of 
April  2025,  our  PROSPERO  registration  record  has  ID 
number CRD42024518138.

Study selection

We  focused  on  studies  involving  undergraduate  and 
graduate  students  of  all  genders,  including  those  who 
prefer  not  to  disclose  their  gender.  Students  clinically 
diagnosed  with  anxiety  disorders  were  also  eligible  for 
inclusion,  given  previous  research  demonstrating  the 
effectiveness of canine-assisted therapy (CAT) in treating 
anxiety [37].

This  meta-analysis  exclusively  examined  CAT.  While 
conducting an overview of all similar treatments assisted 
by animals, we observed a standard confusion in the con-
cepts  and  experimental  designs  of  these  interventions.

For  instance,  it  was  often  unclear  whether  the  animals 
and  caregivers  involved  were  professionally  trained,  or 
whether  handlers  were  present  during  sessions.  Many 
animal-assisted  interventions  share  overlapping  features 
but also differ in important ways. However, inconsistent 
terminology  and  vague  criteria  make  it  hard  to  clearly 
distinguish  between  different  types  of  animal-assisted 
therapy.

To  address  this,  we  used  strict  inclusion  criteria  to 
define CAT in our study. For an intervention to be consid-
ered CAT in our study, it must have two key criteria: (1) 
the incorporation of professionally trained dogs certified 
by  relevant  organizations;  and  (2)  the  dog  handler  must 
be present during the treatment [38]. The standardization 
of incorporating professionally trained, certified dogs and 
requiring  the  presence  of  a  handler  during  CAT  is  cru-
cial for the safety, therapeutic efficacy, and ethical treat-
ment of the therapy dog  [39]. Certified  dogs are trained 
to  remain  calm,  responsive,  and  adaptable  in  various 
therapeutic settings, reducing risks (e.g., agitation or bit-
ing) associated with patient inappropriate behaviors such 
as  abrupt  gestures,  rough  handling,  and  direct  interac-
tions [39, 40]. The handler plays a key role in supervising 
interactions, recognizing and mitigating signs of stress in 
the dog, and upholding ethical standards during sessions. 
Research  shows  that  therapy  dogs  can  experience  stress 
or  burnout  if  not  properly  managed,  which  may  reduce 
the  therapy’s  effectiveness  and  negatively  impact  animal 
welfare [39–41]. Professional organizations like IAHAIO 
and AAII emphasize the importance of handler involve-
ment to ensure safe, ethical, and effective CAT sessions. 
Without these elements, both the outcomes and integrity 
of  the  intervention  could  be  compromised  [39,  42].  For 
studies included in our analysis, if the presence of a han-
dler was not explicitly stated, we assumed a handler was 
present since this is standard practice in CAT. With these 
established criteria, even though some papers might not 
name  the  intervention  particularly  as  canine-assisted 
therapy,  we  still  included  them  in  our  review  as  long  as 
they  involved  trained  therapy  dogs  and  professional 
handlers.

In contrast to CAT, several related interventions, such 
as  animal  visitation  programs  (AVPs),  animal-assisted 
psychotherapy  (AAPT  or  AAP),  and  broader  animal-
assisted  interventions  (AAI),  were  excluded  from  this 
study.  AVPs  may  involve  informal  interactions  with  ani-
mals  that  are  not  professionally  trained,  which  does  not 
meet  this  study’s  requirement  of  incorporating  certified 
therapy  dogs  [43].  AAPT,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  goal-
directed, clinical intervention conducted by professional 
psychotherapists, where the animal is integrated as a key 
part of the therapeutic process aimed at reducing symp-
toms [44]. Therefore, it primarily focuses on patients with 
clinically diagnosed mental illnesses [45]. For example, an 

intervention  led  by  a  psychologist  that  teaches  mindful-
ness  by  encouraging  participants  to  pet  a  dog’s  fur  with 
the explicit goal of reducing anxiety would qualify as ani-
mal-assisted  psychotherapy  [44].  In  contrast,  CAT  does 
not require clinical diagnoses or licensed therapists and is 
typically used in broader wellness or prevention contexts, 
such as providing stress relief for university students who 
may not have a diagnosed mental illness.

Broader  animal-assisted 

interventions  (AAI)  were 
excluded for two main reasons. First, AAI is an umbrella 
term  that  includes  a  range  of  practices,  such  as  animal-
assisted  activities  (AAA),  animal-assisted  education 
(AAE),  and  animal-assisted  therapy  (AAT)  [46].  AAT 
itself  can  involve  a  variety  of  animals,  including  dogs, 
cats,  guinea  pigs,  birds,  dolphins,  and  others  [33].  CAT 
is  a  specific  subtype  of  AAT  that  focuses  exclusively  on 
professionally trained dogs. Because this study centers on 
dog-based  interventions,  only  those  falling  under  CAT 
were included. Second, AAA and AAE may involve staff 
from  various  backgrounds,  including  educators,  activ-
ity  coordinators,  or  volunteers  [47],  while  CAT  requires 
trained  dog  handlers  to  ensure  safety  and  structure. 
Therefore,  AAA  and  AAE,  which  may  not  consistently 
involve  trained  animals  and  handlers,  were  excluded 
from this study.

The  main  comparator  in  this  study  was  the  control 
group  of  students  who  were  not  exposed  to  the  canine-
assisted  therapy  intervention.  Control  group  designs 
may  vary  across  studies,  such  as  waitlist  control,  only 
handler  control,  watching  videos  about  dogs’  control, 
and  completing  unrelated  tasks.  Our  study  also  focused 
exclusively  on  randomized  controlled  trials  to  estab-
lish  a  causal  relationship  between  the  intervention  and 
its  effects  on  students’  stress  and  anxiety  levels.  We  did 
not  include  cross-sectional  or  within-subjects  pre-post 
designs,  but  only  studies  that  consist  of  canine-assisted 
therapy as the treatment group and other forms of con-
trol groups.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the decrease in reported stress 
and anxiety levels in the group exposed to canine-assisted 
therapy. Studies were included if they reported either or 
both constructs. Measurement of stress and anxiety lev-
els  was  based  on  standardized  and  validated  self-rating 
scales; we did not consider observers’ ratings. According 
to  the  American  Psychological  Association  [48],  anxi-
ety  is  “an  emotion  characterized  by  feelings  of  tension, 
worried  thoughts,  and  physical  changes  like  increased 
blood  pressure.”  Since  anxiety  could  be  categorized  into 
state and trait anxiety, we focused on state anxiety when 
studies  reported  anxiety  levels  separately.  State  anxiety 
is  conceived  as  a  situational  increase  in  feelings  of  inse-
curity, while trait anxiety is a relatively stable personality

characteristic  [49].  With  most  canine-assisted  therapy 
being  implemented  only  occasionally  in  universities, 
examining its effect on state anxiety would be more bene-
ficial for future recommendations, such as implementing 
it before stressful events like exams. Meanwhile, stress is 
defined  as  a  state  of  worry  or  mental  tension  caused  by 
a  difficult  situation  [50].  Additionally,  to  explore  poten-
tial  moderators  of  the  effectiveness  of  canine-assisted 
therapy  in  reducing  stress  and  anxiety,  we  conducted 
subgroup  analyses  based  on  variations  in  intervention 
duration,  control  condition  type,  baseline  stress/anxiety 
levels, and risk-of-bias ratings.

Sources and search strategy

We conducted a systematic literature search on April 10, 
2025,  across  several  primary  databases:  APA  PsycInfo, 
PubMed, Duke Libraries, CNKI, and Wanfang. To maxi-
mize  sensitivity,  we  did  an  all-field  search  in  each  data-
base rather than limiting our query to titles and abstracts. 
In addition, we used Google Scholar as a supplementary 
source  to  identify  any  additional  peer-reviewed  publica-
tions  and  hand-searched  the  reference  lists  of  relevant 
systematic  reviews  and  included  studies  for  potentially 
eligible  publications.  All  references  were  imported  into 
Covidence for deduplication and subsequent screening.

Our  search  strategy  focused  on  three  core  concepts: 
the  population  (university  students),  the  intervention 
(canine-assisted  therapy  and  related  animal-assisted 
interventions),  and  the  outcomes  (stress  and  anxiety). 
For example, we combined terms such as “college,” “uni-
versity,”  “undergraduate,”  and  “graduate”  for  the  popula-
tion;  “canine-assisted  therapy,”  “dog-assisted  therapy,” 
“animal-assisted  therapy,”  and  similar  variants  for  the 
intervention;  and  “stress,”  “stress  levels,”  “anxiety,”  and 
“anxiety levels” for the outcomes. This approach ensured 
that studies addressing all three concepts were retrieved. 
Detailed search strings for each database are provided in 
the  supplementary  materials.  An  example  of  the  search 
string is as follows:

(“canine-assisted  therapy”  OR  “canine  therapy”  OR 
CAT  OR  “dog-assisted  therapy”  OR  “dog  therapy”  OR 
“canine-assisted  intervention”  OR  “animal-assisted  ther-
apy”  OR  “animal  therapy”  OR  “animal-assisted  inter-
vention”  OR  AAI)  AND  (college  OR  undergraduate  OR 
graduate  OR  “higher  education”  OR  “university  stu-
dents”)  AND  (stress  OR  “stress  levels”  OR  anxiety  OR 
“anxiety levels”).

Two  reviewers  (SS  and  ZL)  independently  screened 
titles and abstracts based on predefined inclusion criteria. 
Eligible  studies  were  those  mentioning  canine-assisted 
therapy,  targeting  university  students,  and  reporting 
measures  of  stress  or  anxiety.  Articles  that  passed  this 
initial  screening  underwent  full-text  review  to  verify 
study design, intervention implementation (including the 

use of trained therapy dogs and handlers), and outcome 
measurement.  A  checklist  based  on  mutually  agreed 
criteria  was  used  during  screening  (see  supplementary 
materials), and any disagreements were resolved through 
discussion.  We  restricted  our  search  to  randomized 
controlled  trials  published  in  English  or  Chinese.  Only 
peer-reviewed,  published  studies  were  considered;  gray 
literature was excluded. Our search included studies pub-
lished  up  to  April  2025,  and  any  articles  published  after 
this were not considered for inclusion.

Data extraction

Data  extraction  was  completed  by  both  reviewers  inde-
pendently  using  an  Excel  sheet.  We  collected  data  on 
study designs, study participants, sample sizes, treatment 
conditions,  control  conditions,  baseline  measurements, 
reported  post-measurements,  duration  of  interventions, 
and  the  risk  of  bias.  Risk  of  bias  was  assessed  using  the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool [51]. Each study was 
evaluated for randomization process, deviations from the 
intended intervention, handling of missing outcome data, 
consistency  of  outcome  measurement,  and  selection  of 
reported  results,  with  each  domain  rated  as  “low  risk,” 
“some concerns,” or “high risk.”

To  compute  the  effect  sizes  of  each  study,  we  primar-
ily  extracted  post-means  and  standard  deviations  from 
treatment and control groups, following the recommen-
dation  by  Lipsey  and  Wilson  [52]  for  practical  meta-
analysis.  If  means  and  standard  deviations  were  not 
reported,  we  extracted  t-test  values  instead.  For  stud-
ies  reporting  results  from  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS) 
regression  models  with  a  dummy-coded  treatment  vari-
able  (e.g.,  treatment = 1,  control = 0),  we  extracted  the 
unstandardized regression coefficient, its standard error, 
the  standard  deviation  of  the  dependent  variable,  and 
group sample sizes to compute standardized effect sizes. 
These were included only when the regression compared 
treatment  versus  control  within  an  RCT.  If  data  such 
as  sample  sizes,  intervention  duration,  or  baseline  val-
ues  were  missing,  we  contacted  the  authors  to  request 
the  information.  Missing  data  with  no  author  response 
were  imputed  through  mean  substitution;  in  the  case  of 
subgroup analyses, such studies were excluded. Any dis-
agreements  during  the  extraction  process  were  resolved 
through discussion, and when needed, we consulted the 
supervising author (CN).

Data analysis

We  conducted  a  random-effects  meta-analysis  using 
Stata/SE  18.0  as  we  anticipated  both  clinical  and  meth-
odological  heterogeneity  among  canine-assisted  therapy 
studies  [31].  Given  the  considerable  variability  in  inter-
vention  protocols,  participant  characteristics,  and  out-
come measures in this field, the random-effects model is 

Sim et al. BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies          (2025) 25:303 most appropriate because it assumes that each study esti-
mates a  different true effect [53], thus  providing a more 
conservative  and  generalizable  estimate  of  the  overall 
intervention effect.

Effect  sizes  (Cohen’s  d)  were  computed  using  the 
extracted  post-intervention  means  and  standard  devia-
tions,  or  t-test/regression  statistics  when  necessary.  The 
practical  meta-analysis  effect  size  calculator  [54]  was 
used  to  calculate  effect  sizes  and  standard  errors  for 
the  meta-analysis.  Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted 
to  examine  the  impact  of  intervention  duration,  differ-
ences based on risk-of-bias levels, and the effect of con-
trol condition type on intervention effectiveness. Control 
conditions  were  classified  as  passive  if  they  involved  no 
structured  engagement  (e.g.,  waitlist,  routine  academic 
activities)  and  as  active  if  they  involved  structured  or 
interactive  components  (e.g.,  interacting  with  handler-
only sessions, watching animal-related videos). To assess 
the robustness of our findings for the intervention dura-
tion  subgroup,  we  also  conducted  a  sensitivity  analysis 
by  excluding  multi-session  studies  and  re-running  the 
analysis.

For  both  meta-  and  subgroup  analyses,  we  reported 
Hedges’  g,  95%  confidence  intervals,  and  p-values.  The 
chi-square test of group differences was also reported for 
subgroup analyses to determine if effect sizes differed sig-
nificantly across groups. We considered Hedges’ g values 
of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 as small, medium, and large overall 
intervention  effect  sizes  [55],  respectively,  and  a  p-value 
less  than  0.05  as  significant.  Heterogeneity  across  stud-
ies  was  assessed  using  the  I²  statistic.  We  interpreted  I² 
values  of  0–30%  as  insignificant,  30–60%  as  moderate, 
60–75% as substantial, and 75–100% as considerable het-
erogeneity  [56].  Small-study  bias  was  assessed  through 
Egger’s  test,  while  potential  publication  bias  was  evalu-
ated  using  trim-and-fill  analysis  and  funnel  plots.  All 
tests  and  analyses  were  conducted  using  Stata/SE  18.0’s 
built-in functions; no external packages were used.

In addition, to account for differences in how baseline 
stress and anxiety were measured across studies, we stan-
dardized the baseline scores using z-scores. First, we cal-
culated the pooled mean baseline score by weighting each 
study’s  baseline  score  according  to  its  sample  size.  We 
then estimated the pooled standard deviation by combin-
ing the variances from all studies while adjusting for the 
total  number  of  studies.  Finally,  we  computed  a  z-score 
for each study, representing how much its baseline stress 
and anxiety level deviated from the overall pooled mean. 
Based on these z-scores, we categorized studies into low 
(z < 0)  and  high  (z > 0)  baseline  stress/anxiety  groups  in 
the later section to conduct a subgroup analysis.

Results
Study selection

After  running  our  search  strategy  across  the  selected 
databases,  we  retrieved  a  total  of  290  records  (Fig.  1). 
Automatic  deduplication  in  Covidence  identified  34 
duplicates, and an additional 2 duplicates were removed 
manually, leaving 254 articles for screening. Following the 
title  and  abstract  screening,  224  records  were  excluded 
for not meeting the eligibility criteria (e.g., incorrect pop-
ulation, intervention, or study design), leaving 30 articles 
for  full-text  review.  Of  these,  15  were  further  excluded 
during  full-text  review  for  reasons  such  as  not  using  a 
randomized controlled trial design, not measuring stress 
or anxiety outcomes (e.g., measured general mood only), 
involving mixed-species interventions (e.g., both cats and 
dogs), or using an intervention format outside the scope 
of our review (e.g., a therapy dog passively wandering in a 
lecture hall). Specific reasons for exclusion at the full-text 
stage  are  provided  in  the  supplementary  materials.  No 
additional  eligible  studies  were  identified  from  the  Chi-
nese databases.

In  total,  15  individual  studies  [13,  21,  57–69]  met  al.l 
inclusion criteria. One study [61] met al.l inclusion crite-
ria at the abstract and full-text screening stages; however, 
it  was  excluded  from  the  meta-analysis  due  to  insuffi-
cient  statistical  reporting.  Specifically,  the  study  did  not 
provide  post-intervention  means,  standard  deviations, 
t-values,  or  enough  information  (e.g.,  standard  error  of 
regression  coefficients)  to  compute  an  effect  size,  and 
our attempts to extract usable data did not meet our pre-
defined extraction requirements. The remaining 14 stud-
ies were included in the meta-analysis.

Study characteristics

Most  of  the  included  studies  were  conducted  in  West-
ern  countries–  3  in  Canada,  9  in  the  USA,  and  3  in  the 
UK–  with  a  total  sample  of  1868  university  students. 
Individual  sample  sizes  ranged  from  39  to  357  partici-
pants  (M = 124,  SD = 87).  In  most  studies,  the  number 
of  female  participants  exceeded  that  of  males,  with  an 
overall male-to-female ratio of 1:3 (Male N = 424; Female 
N = 1322),  and  the  average  age  of  participants  was  19.61 
years  (SD = 2.37).  Most  studies  did  not  screen  for  prior 
anxiety  or  mental  illness  diagnoses;  only  one  reported 
that  33%  of  participants  had  previously  been  diagnosed 
with an anxiety disorder [57]. All interventions involved 
live, in-person interactions with a therapy dog accompa-
nied by a trained handler. Intervention session durations 
varied considerably, from as short as 1 min to as long as 
120 min (M = 32, SD = 31.6). All studies allowed students 
to  interact  freely  with  therapy  dogs;  students  could  pet, 
sit with, or play with the dogs based on their preferences. 
Most  studies  implemented  a  single-session  interven-
tion; however, two studies administered the intervention

Fig. 1  PRISMA flow chart. A total of 290 records were identified from databases, and 36 studies were removed before screening. Of 254 studies that were 
screened for titles and abstracts, 30 studies were eligible for full-text review. 15 studies were included in the review and 14 in the meta-analysis after 
finalization

over  6  and  7  weeks,  respectively  [60,  64].  Control  con-
ditions  also  varied.  Examples  included  waitlist  controls 
[64],  watching  videos  of  dogs  [63],  and  completing  the 
Family  Life-Space  Diagram  [13].  The  waitlist  condition 

was the most common (N = 3), while a larger number of 
studies  used  active  controls  (e.g.,  engagement  with  han-
dlers,  interaction  with  other  participants,  or  viewing 
non-animal-related  presentations;  N = 8)  compared  to 

Sim et al. BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies          (2025) 25:303  
passive controls (e.g., continuation of daily routines such 
as studying; N = 7).

Regarding outcome measures, 6 studies (40%) assessed 
anxiety  using  the  State-Trait  Anxiety  Inventory  (STAI), 
5  studies  (33%)  evaluated  stress  via  versions  of  the  Per-
ceived  Stress  Scale  (PSS),  and  the  remaining  studies 
used  alternative  tools  such  as  momentary  stress  ratings 
or  diagram-based  measures  like  the  Family  Life-Space 
Diagram.  Although  the  majority  of  studies  reported 
reductions  in  stress  and  anxiety  levels  in  the  interven-
tion group, four of them did not yield statistically signifi-
cant  results  [13,  58,  60,  68].  Additional  details  on  study 
designs  and  individual  study  results  are  provided  in  the

Main effect

Results  from  random-effects  meta-analysis  revealed 
a  statistically  significant  overall  effect  size  of  g  =  -0.672 
(95% CI [-0.892, -0.452], z = -5.99, p <.001), indicating a 
moderate  effect.  However,  four  specific  studies  [13,  58, 
60, 68] had no statistically significant effects. Among all 
studies, Trammell [67] demonstrated the strongest effect 
size  of  -1.342  (95%  CI  [-1.997,  -0.687]),  while  Ward-
Griffin  et  al.  [68]  reported  the  smallest  significant  effect 
size of -0.129 (95% CI [-0.379, 0.122]). Additionally, high 
heterogeneity  was  observed  across  the  included  stud-
ies  (I2 = 72.81,  p <.001),  suggesting  substantial  variability 
between intervention effects (Fig. 2).

Note. N = Analyzed Participants; All studies were conducted in Western countries (e.g., Canada, USA, and UK). All interventions involved students interacting with 
both dogs and handlers concurrently, while the control design varied across studies. Estimates of Cohen’s d were computed using post-intervention means and SDs 
of the intervention and control groups or t-test/regression statistics

Vertical dash line represents the weighted mean difference

Furthermore,  the  funnel  plot  (Fig.  3)  raises  concerns 
regarding potential publication bias, as 5 out of 14 stud-
ies fall outside the 95% confidence interval. For example, 
the  largest  effect  size  of  -1.34  by  Trammell  [67]  origi-
nated  from  the  study  with  the  second  smallest  sample 
size  (N = 44),  suggesting  possible  small-study  effects.  To 
formally  assess  this,  we  performed  an  Egger  test,  which 
yielded  a  non-significant  result  (z  =  -1.27,  p =.21).  Even 
though we did not find significant results for small study 
bias, it is still important to note that Egger’s test has low 
power  to  detect  this  bias  when  there  are  few  studies. 
Thus,  we  complemented  it  with  a  trim-and-fill  analysis 
for  a  more  comprehensive  assessment  of  potential  pub-
lication bias.

Trim and fill analysis

The  trim  and  fill  analysis  imputed  two  potentially  miss-
ing studies on the right side of the funnel plot, suggesting 
that smaller or non-significant studies may be underrep-
resented.  The  observed  effect  size  was  − 0.672  (95%  CI 

[-0.892, -0.452]), while the adjusted effect size after impu-
tation  was  − 0.592  (95%  CI  [-0.816,  -0.368]).  Although 
this adjusted effect size is slightly smaller in magnitude, it 
still reflects a moderate and statistically significant effect 
of  canine-assisted  therapy  in  reducing  stress  and  anxi-
ety  among  university  students.  The  adjusted  funnel  plot 
(Fig. 4) showed a more symmetrical distribution, provid-
ing  some  evidence  that  the  trim-and-fill  method  helped 
account for funnel plot asymmetry.

However,  as  suggested  by  Sterne  et  al.  [51],  the  trim-
and-fill  procedure  assumes  that  funnel  plot  asymmetry 
is  solely  due  to  publication  bias  and  may  not  perform 
well  when  substantial  heterogeneity  exists.  Given  the 
high  heterogeneity  observed  in  our  meta-analysis,  these 
results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Other  fac-
tors,  such  as  clinical  diversity  or  methodological  vari-
ability  across  studies,  may  also  contribute  to  the  initial 
asymmetry.

Fig. 5  Summary of the risk of bias. No studies were identified to have an overall low risk of bias

Risk of bias

Across  5  risk  of  bias  domains  and  75  total  outcomes, 
17 of them were rated as low-risk, 43 were evaluated to 
have some concerns, and 12 were identified as high-risk. 
Overall, no studies were assessed as low-risk; 5 out of the 
14 studies had some concerns, while the remaining were 
classified  as  high-risk.  Similar  to  previous  meta-analy-
ses  conducted  on  animal-assisted  interventions,  such  as 
Huber  et  al.  [31],  we  found  that  most  studies  could  not 
implement  blinding  procedures  since  the  presence  of 
therapy  canines  during  the  intervention  made  it  obvi-
ous  to  both  researchers  and  possibly  the  participants 
that they were in the treatment condition. This, in turn, 
might have likely influenced the self-reported outcomes, 
thereby  causing  many  studies  to  be  rated  as  “some  con-
cerns”  and  high-risk.  The  overview  of  the  risk  of  bias 
results can be referred to in Fig. 5, and specific details can 
be found in the supplementary materials.

Subgroup analyses
Risk of bias

To address potential biases arising from variations in the 
risk of bias among studies included in our meta-analysis, 
we  conducted  a  subgroup  analysis  comparing  the  effect 
sizes  of  studies  categorized  as  “some  concerns”  and 
“high-risk”.  The  pooled  effect  size  for  studies  with  some 
concerns  was  − 0.780  (95%  CI  [-1.232,  -0.328]),  while 
for  high-risk  studies,  it  was  − 0.607  (95%  CI  [-0.859, 
-0.456]).  We  further  evaluated  the  differences  in  effect 
sizes  between  these  groups  using  a  chi-square  test  of 
group differences, yielding a non-significant result (Qb = 
0.43, p =.513). In general, our findings suggest that while 
studies  with  some  concerns  showed  a  larger  effect  size 

on average compared to high-risk studies, this difference 
was not significant.

Baseline differences

Another potential bias in our analysis is that the samples 
across  studies  were  not  homogeneous  in  their  baseline 
stress  and  anxiety  levels,  which  may  have  either  overes-
timated or underestimated the effect of CAT. To account 
for  this  bias,  we  divided  the  studies’  baseline  z-scores 
into  two  groups:  a  low  baseline  stress/anxiety  group 
(z < 0) and a high baseline stress/anxiety group (z > 0). We 
then conducted a subgroup analysis to examine whether 
CAT’s effectiveness varied depending on students’ initial 
stress and anxiety levels.

Our  analysis  revealed  that  the  pooled  effect  size  for 
the low stress/anxiety group was − 0.494 (95% CI [-0.778, 
-0.209]),  which  is  smaller  in  magnitude  than  the  pooled 
effect size of -0.909 (95% CI [-1.225, -0.593]) for the high 
stress/anxiety group. The chi-square test of group differ-
ences  indicated  a  statistically  significant  difference  (Qb 
=  3.67,  p <.05)  between  the  two  groups.  Furthermore, 
heterogeneity  was  more  pronounced  in  the  low  stress/
anxiety group (I² = 73.17, p <.001) compared to the high 
stress/anxiety  group  (I²  =  59.65,  p <.05).  Overall,  our 
subgroup  analysis  of  baseline  differences  suggests  that 
variations in students’ pre-intervention stress and anxiety 
levels likely contributed to the heterogeneity of the main 
outcome.

Passive and active controls

To examine whether the type of control condition influ-
enced the effectiveness of canine-assisted therapy (CAT), 
we  conducted  a  subgroup  meta-analysis  comparing 
studies  using  passive  versus  active  control  conditions. 

Sim et al. BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies          (2025) 25:303  
Interventions  compared  to  passive  controls  (e.g.,  wait-
list or typical study routines) yielded a pooled effect size 
of  -0.503  (95%  CI  [-0.815,  -0.191]),  while  those  com-
pared  to  active  controls  (e.g.,  interaction  with  a  handler 
or  engagement  in  attention-matched  tasks)  showed  a 
stronger  effect  size  of  -0.834  (95%  CI  [-1.046,  -0.622]). 
Although  the  test  of  subgroup  differences  did  not  reach 
statistical  significance  (Qb = 2.96,  p =.085),  the  results 
suggest  a  potential  trend  toward  greater  CAT  effective-
ness when compared with more actively engaging control 
conditions.

Intervention duration

To  explore  potential  differences  in  intervention  effec-
tiveness based on duration, we categorized sessions into 
three  groups:  0–14  min  (short),  15–29  min  (medium), 
and ≥ 30 min (long). Currently, there are no standardized 
thresholds for session length in canine-assisted interven-
tions.  However,  prior  research  suggests  that  both  brief 
(5  min)  and  longer  (20  min)  sessions  can  significantly 
reduce  stress  [59],  and  one  study  found  no  significant 
differences  in  outcomes  between  sessions  lasting  2-,  5-, 
and 10 min [70]. Given this variability and the absence of 
established  standards,  we  selected  our  cutoffs  to  reflect 
common ranges reported in the literature. This approach 
may  help  clarify  how  session  length  relates  to  interven-
tion  effectiveness  and  improve  replicability  in  future 
studies.

In  the  short-duration  group  (0–14  min),  the  pooled 
effect size was − 0.883 (95% CI [-1.170, -0.596]), with no 
observed  heterogeneity  (I²  =  0.00,  p =.564),  suggesting  a 
consistent and strong effect of brief sessions in reducing 
stress and anxiety. This consistency is notable given that 
one of the interventions [63] was as short as 1 min. The 
medium-duration group (15–29 min) also demonstrated 
a reduction in stress and anxiety, with a pooled effect size 
of -0.651 (95% CI [-1.001, -0.300]). However, substantial 
heterogeneity  was  observed  (I²  =  74.52,  p <.01),  indicat-
ing variability across studies. Similarly, the long-duration 
group  (≥ 30  min)  yielded  an  effect  size  of  -0.497  (95% 
CI  [-0.906,  -0.088])  with  high  heterogeneity  (I²  =  79.66, 
p <.001), suggesting that longer sessions may be effective 
but vary in impact.

A  chi-square  test  of  group  differences  indicated  that 
the differences between duration categories were not sta-
tistically significant (Qb = 2.31, p =.283). Therefore, while 
all  durations  show  beneficial  effects,  no  specific  ses-
sion length appeared as significantly more effective than 
others.

Two of the included studies implemented multi-session 
interventions  lasting  several  weeks  [60,  64].  To  examine 
their  influence,  we  also  conducted  a  sensitivity  analysis 
excluding  these  studies.  The  effect  sizes  and  direction 
of  results  remained  consistent,  and  no  meaningful 

Page 12 of 15

differences  were  observed  across  subgroups.  This  sup-
ports the robustness of our findings since the inclusion of 
multi-session  studies  did  not  substantially  alter  conclu-
sions about intervention duration.

Discussion
Overall,  our  meta-analysis  demonstrates  that  canine-
assisted therapy (CAT) effectively reduces university stu-
dents’  stress  and  anxiety,  with  a  moderate  pooled  effect 
size. However, the substantial heterogeneity suggests that 
CAT’s  effectiveness  may  vary  depending  on  the  study 
context.  Although  Egger’s  test  was  not  significant,  the 
fact  that  one  of  the  smallest  trials  produced  the  largest 
effect size points to possible small-study effects and calls 
for cautious interpretation.

Subgroup analyses help clarify some of this variability. 
Specifically,  CAT  produced  a  significantly  larger  effect 
among  students  with  high  baseline  stress  and  anxiety 
compared to those with lower baseline levels. This find-
ing suggests that CAT may function more effectively as a 
targeted preventive intervention, particularly for individ-
uals  already  experiencing  heightened  psychological  dis-
tress.  Additionally,  there  were  no  significant  differences 
in effect sizes between passive control groups (e.g., wait-
list)  and  active  control  groups  (e.g.,  attention-matched 
activities), suggesting that the observed benefits of CAT 
are not solely due to novelty or attention effects.

the 

shortest 

Although 

intervention 

duration 
(0–14  min)  group  showed  the  largest  effect  size,  sub-
group differences by session length were not statistically 
significant.  This  implies  that,  while  intervention  length 
might influence outcomes, no specific duration emerged 
as  definitively  superior.  Instead,  the  consistent  positive 
effects  across  all  durations  indicate  CAT’s  adaptability 
and  its  potential  to  be  tailored  flexibly  to  various  pro-
gram structures.

While  potential  publication  bias  cannot  be  entirely 
ruled out, given the funnel plot asymmetry and the impu-
tation of two potentially missing studies via trim-and-fill 
analysis,  the  adjusted  effect  size  remained  statistically 
significant.  This  strengthens  the  overall  conclusion  that 
CAT  is  a  promising  intervention  for  improving  student 
mental health.

From  a  theoretical  standpoint,  our  findings  align  with 
social  support  theory.  That  is,  interactions  with  therapy 
dogs  and  handlers  may  serve  as  a  source  of  social  sup-
port,  resulting  in  reduced  students’  anxiety  and  stress 
levels  [22]. This  unique  form  of  social  support  provided 
by therapy dogs complements human support networks, 
as suggested by McNicholas and Collis [14, 24]. The non-
judgmental,  unconditional  support  facilitates  emotional 
relief,  helping  individuals  reduce  their  stress  and  anxi-
ety levels. In particular, CAT facilitates emotionally safe,

referred  to  in  this  analysis  as  canine-assisted  therapy 
(CAT).  Currently,  there  is  no  standardized  theoreti-
cal  framework  for  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  AAT/
CAT, leading to wide variations in intervention protocols, 
treatment goals, and outcome measures. For example, the 
duration  and  frequency  of  therapy  dog  interactions  var-
ied considerably, ranging from brief one-minute sessions 
to multi-week programs. Differences were also observed 
in  the  design  of  control  conditions  and  outcome  assess-
ments,  further  contributing  to  methodological  incon-
sistencies.  Therefore,  addressing  these  challenges  by 
standardizing  research  procedures,  such  as  establishing 
consensus  definitions  and  treatment  guidelines,  would 
help  improve  replicability  and  intervention  reliability  in 
future CAT studies.

It  is  also  worth  noting  that  although  this  study  aligns 
with  social  support  theory,  we  did  not  directly  measure 
social  support  factors  such  as  emotional  support,  feel-
ings of connectedness, or social isolation. Future studies 
should include explicit assessments of these constructs to 
better understand the mechanisms by which CAT influ-
ences  mental  health.  By  examining  the  role  of  therapy 
dog  interactions  in  fostering  a  sense  of  connection  and 
emotional  relief,  future  studies  can  have  deeper  insight 
into the broader psychological benefits of CAT and clar-
ify how social support mediates its effects on stress and 
anxiety reduction.

Implications

The implications of these findings are important for uni-
versity  administrators  considering  the  implementation 
of CAT programs on their campuses. Despite the meth-
odological  limitations  identified,  CAT  is  still  a  promis-
ing  solution  for  addressing  the  growing  mental  health 
challenges faced by university students, especially in the 
aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its cost-efficiency, 
scalability,  and  high-popularity,  combined  with  demon-
strated effectiveness in reducing stress and anxiety, make 
CAT a feasible option for institutions aiming to promote 
student well-being.

Universities  may  also  consider  integrating  CAT  into 
broader, multifaceted mental health strategies by pairing 
it with existing services such as counseling, mindfulness 
programs,  or  peer-led  support  groups.  This  integrated 
approach  could  encourage  greater  student  engagement 
and  enhance  the  overall  effectiveness  of  mental  health 
initiatives.  Moreover,  institutional  investment  in  struc-
tured  CAT  programs  (clear  protocols  for  screening, 
supervision,  and  feedback)  would  contribute  to  the  sus-
tainability  and  standardization  of  these  interventions, 
ensuring long-term benefits for student populations.

low-stakes  social  interactions,  which  may  serve  as  an 
important buffer against stress and anxiety.

In  summary,  this  study  contributes  to  the  growing 
body  of  literature  supporting  the  effectiveness  of  CAT 
in  reducing  stress  and  anxiety,  while  also  offering  new 
insights  into  potential  moderating  factors  such  as  base-
line  distress  and  intervention  duration.  It  advances  the 
field through rigorous inclusion of RCTs and by focusing 
specifically  on  university  students,  an  underrepresented 
population in previous meta-analyses.

Limitations and future directions
Included evidence

Similar  to  the  previous  AAI  meta-analysis  by  Huber  et 
al.  [31],  a  key  limitation  of  the  included  studies  is  the 
predominance  of  female  participants,  with  proportions 
ranging  from  60  to  95%.  This  imbalance  in  participant 
demographics  may  limit  the  generalizability  of  the  find-
ings to the broader university student population, partic-
ularly given gender-based differences in stress perception 
and  coping  styles  [50,  71].  The  overrepresentation  of 
female participants is likely due to recruitment practices 
in  fields  such  as  psychology  and  nursing,  which  tend 
to  have  higher  proportions  of  female  students.  Future 
research should aim to address this limitation by recruit-
ing  more  gender-diverse  samples  and  by  examining 
potential  gender  differences  in  CAT’s  impact  on  stress 
and anxiety reduction among university students.

Another  limitation  is  the  high  risk  of  bias  present  in 
many  studies,  largely  due  to  factors  inherent  to  CAT 
interventions. First, carers and individuals delivering the 
interventions  were  often  aware  of  participants’  group 
assignments,  as  therapy  dog  interactions  are  conspicu-
ous (participants would see and interact with dogs), mak-
ing  blinding  infeasible.  Second,  outcome  assessments 
may  have  been  influenced  by  prior  knowledge  of  CAT’s 
potential benefits, as many participants were psychology 
students who may have been familiar with the effects of 
human-animal  interactions.  Third,  a  substantial  num-
ber  of  studies  lacked  pre-registration,  meaning  analyses 
were  not  always  conducted  according  to  a  pre-specified 
plan finalized before unblinded outcome data were avail-
able,  raising  concerns  about  outcome  reporting  flexibil-
ity.  Future  research  should  adopt  stronger  trial  designs, 
including  pre-registration  of  outcomes  and  the  use  of 
validated,  objective  stress  and  anxiety  biomarkers  to 
enhance internal validity.

Review process

In  addition,  the  studies  included  in  this  review  exhib-
ited high methodological heterogeneity, which may have 
influenced the interpretation of our results. We propose 
that this heterogeneity is partly attributable to the broad 
range  of  criteria  for  animal-assisted  therapy  (AAT), 

Sim et al. BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies          (2025) 25:303 Conclusion
This meta-analysis provides strong evidence that canine-
assisted  therapy  (CAT)  is  an  effective  intervention  for 
reducing  stress  and  anxiety  among  university  students, 
with an overall moderate effect size and consistent ben-
efits  across  session  durations  and  control  conditions. 
These  findings  suggest  that  CAT  can  be  successfully 
implemented in higher education settings, especially for 
students experiencing high levels of pre-existing stress or 
anxiety. Importantly, this study contributes to existing lit-
erature  by  isolating  the  effects  of  CAT  within  university 
student  populations.  While  methodological  limitations 
remain, the results support the inclusion of CAT as part 
of a complementary suite of mental health interventions 
within universities.

Future  research  should  focus  on  improving  study 
design rigor, exploring long-term outcomes, and examin-
ing CAT’s differential effectiveness across diverse student 
subgroups.  Establishing  standardized  intervention  pro-
tocols and directly assessing mechanisms, such as social 
support  and  emotional  bonding,  will  also  be  essential 
to  optimizing  CAT’s  effectiveness.  Ultimately,  a  deeper 
understanding  of  CAT’s  therapeutic  potential  will  help 
position  this  unique  intervention  as  a  valuable,  accessi-
ble, and student-centered approach to mental health care 
in higher education.
