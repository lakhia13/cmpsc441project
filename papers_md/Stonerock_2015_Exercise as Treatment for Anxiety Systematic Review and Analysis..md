Analysis

Abstract

Background—Exercise has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety, but few studies have 
studied exercise in individuals pre-selected because of their high anxiety.

Purpose—To review and critically evaluate studies of exercise training in adults with either high 
levels of anxiety or an anxiety disorder.

Methods—We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in which 
anxious adults were randomized to an exercise or non-exercise control condition. Data were 
extracted concerning anxiety outcomes and study design. Existing meta-analyses were also 
reviewed.

Results—Evidence from 12 RCTs suggested benefits of exercise, for select groups, similar to 
established treatments and greater than placebo. However, most studies had significant 
methodological limitations, including small sample sizes, concurrent therapies, and inadequate 
assessment of adherence and fitness levels.

Conclusions—Exercise may be a useful treatment for anxiety, but lack of data from rigorous, 
methodologically sound RCTs precludes any definitive conclusions about its effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION

Anxiety, a psychological state characterized by apprehensive expectation or fear, is among 
the most commonly experienced psychiatric symptoms (1). Data from the National 
Comorbidity Study-Replication suggest that in the United States, the lifetime prevalence of 
any anxiety disorder is approximately one in three, more than any other diagnostic category 
(2). Some elevation in anxiety symptoms, whether affective (fear, apprehension) or 
physiological (racing heart, trembling, etc.), is a criterion common to all of these disorders.

However, other diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders can be quite heterogeneous, such as 
the frequency and severity of symptoms as well as whether triggers for these symptoms are 
specific or more generalized. Subsyndromal anxiety symptoms also can impair individuals’ 
psychosocial functioning and can necessitate use of health care resources (3). Anxiety 
represents a risk factor for lower health-related quality of life (4), increased risk of all-cause 
mortality (5), and a variety of physical health problems, particularly cardiovascular disease 
(CVD).

Findings from a number of prospective epidemiological studies report a strong association 
of anxiety with mortality in healthy individuals (5, 6, 7) and in CVD patients (8, 9, 10, 11, 
12, 13, 14). It has been shown that elevated anxiety scores were associated with increased 
risk of mortality after accounting for established risk factors in 934 men and women with 
CVD (15). Moreover, elevated anxiety symptoms have been shown to be associated with a 
2-fold increased risk of mortality in coronary bypass patients (11, 12, 13) and in outpatients 
with CVD (9, 16, 17). One study (10) reported that CVD patients with Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder (GAD) assessed two months following hospital discharge showed a 2.3-fold 
increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and another (17) reported a 2.8-fold increased risk 
of adverse events in acute post-MI patients in which anxiety was measured one month 
following hospital discharge. Similarly, a 2-fold increased risk of adverse events was 
observed in stable CVD patients with elevated anxiety during annual clinic visits (18). High 
anxiety has also been associated with increased risk for the development of hypertension 
(19), heart disease (20), and of increased cancer mortality in longitudinal studies of early 
adults (5, 21), even when controlling for other medical risk factors. Among healthy 
individuals, anxiety can be associated with unhealthy behaviors such as physical inactivity, 
smoking, and poor diet, leading to increased risk for developing health issues (22, 23).

Several empirically-supported treatments have shown efficacy for anxiety reduction, 
including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) (24, 25, 26) and psychotropic medications, 
particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (25, 27, 28, 29). However, these 
treatments may be associated with significant drawbacks and treatment barriers. For 
example, although SSRIs can be effective for some, they are not effective for everyone and 
may be associated with adverse side effects (30), which can lead to treatment dropout (31). 
Although CBT also has empirical support as a structured intervention for anxiety disorders, 
access can be limited by a myriad of factors, including availability of trained providers and 
economical considerations (32). Such issues represent barriers to effective treatment for 
individuals with elevated anxiety, creating the need for alternative therapies.

Exercise may represent a promising, affordable, and easily accessible treatment option for 
individuals with anxiety. Exercise is distinguished from other forms of physical activity in 
that it is a planned, structured, repetitive endeavor with the goal of improving physical 
fitness (33). A number of observational studies document an inverse association of exercise 
and symptoms of anxiety. For example, in one study of 8098 adults (34), individuals 
exercising “regularly” had a reduced risk of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder 
compared to their sedentary counterparts (odds ratios [OR] from 0.64 to 0.78 for exercisers). 
In another study of 19,288 participants in the Netherlands Twin Registry (35), individuals 
reporting 240 minutes a week of moderate exercise reported less anxiety and neuroticism

compared with non-exercisers. Although encouraging, data from observational studies 
cannot prove that exercise caused reduced risk for an anxiety disorder. Anxious persons may 
be less likely to be physically active and engage in exercise (35).

Interventional studies of healthy individuals without an anxiety disorder have demonstrated 
reductions in state anxiety immediately after performing single bouts of exercise (36, 37, 38, 
39). However, such studies do not address the question of whether accumulated bouts of 
exercise reduce anxiety levels, nor do they address whether individuals with an anxiety 
disorder could benefit from repeated bouts of exercise. Interventional studies also have 
examined the effects of multiple bouts of exercise on anxiety, albeit primarily among 
individuals who were not selected on the basis of high anxiety levels. For example, one 
study of 357 older adults found that assignment to regular exercise participation was 
associated with significant anxiety reduction at 12 months compared to assignment to 
control (40). Similarly, state and trait anxiety decreased among participants with elevated 
blood pressure in a study of a 12-week Tai Chi program, compared with sedentary controls 
(41). However, participants in these trials were not experiencing clinically significant 
anxiety prior to intervention.

Depression may co-occur with anxiety (2, 9, 42, 43), and a number of comprehensive 
reviews of the literature on exercise for depression have been conducted (44, 45, 46). 
However, there have been relatively few reviews of the literature on exercise for anxiety. 
Those that exist have not distinguished studies that targeted anxious individuals a priori, nor 
have they provided a critical analysis of the quality of the research. Reviews that included 
results of exercise interventions on anxiety outcomes typically have found a robust and 
beneficial relationship (47, 48). However, these reviews have primarily included studies of 
non-anxious participants, and the clinical significance of reduced anxiety in non-anxious 
individuals is questionable. Other reviews have failed to differentiate single-bout and 
chronic exercise (48) or anxious and non-anxious individuals (49). In one recent review 
(50), only studies of individuals with diagnosed anxiety disorders were included, possibly 
omitting important information from those with significant anxiety but without a specific 
diagnosis. A critical review is needed in order to establish the quality and quantity of 
available evidence that this potentially valuable intervention is effective for treating anxious 
individuals.

The purpose of this review is to describe and critically evaluate published exercise 
interventions targeting individuals with elevated anxiety or with a diagnosis of an anxiety 
disorder. We also provide a review of meta-analyses of research concerning the relationship 
between exercise and anxiety, to complement our review of the randomized clinical trials 
(RCTs) that have been conducted targeting participants with elevated anxiety levels.

METHOD

We conducted a systematic search (July 2014) for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in 
which participants were pre-selected on the basis of either a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder 
or elevated symptoms of anxiety and then randomized to treatment with exercise as one of

the treatment arms of the trial. These criteria were chosen so that all experimental data 
concerning exercise as an intervention for anxious individuals would be included.

Inclusion Criteria

We included all RCTs that met the following criteria: (1) article published in English in a 
peer-reviewed journal; (2) participants were at least 18 years old; (3) participants had 
elevated anxiety symptoms using a validated assessment instrument, or were diagnosed with 
an anxiety disorder; (4) exercise intervention consisted of >1 exercise sessions; and (5) 
anxiety was an outcome measure. Several studies have examined the immediate effects of 
single bouts of exercise on anxiety (37, 38, 51), which were not included in this review. We 
did include RCTs of participants with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although 
DSM-5 now classifies PTSD separately from anxiety disorders (1).

Procedures

We first conducted a comprehensive search using CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, 
PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. Articles were identified with titles or abstracts that 
included terms, or variants thereof, from each of the following groups: (1) physical activity 
or exercise; (2) anxiety or phobia or panic; (3) randomly or randomized or clinical trial. 
These articles were compiled in an EndNote database. Next, every unique abstract in the 
database was examined to determine whether any inclusion criteria for the review were 
unequivocally unmet (e.g., study of children or non-humans, participants without elevated 
anxiety, etc.). Those articles were discarded, and the remaining studies were retained for 
data extraction. A random subset of articles (N = 25) was selected for double review, to 
confirm that the articles should be excluded and to establish inter-rater reliability. No 
discrepancies were observed during this double review (100% agreement). If there was any 
uncertainty about whether inclusion criteria were met, the article was retained for further 
examination.

Next, two randomly assigned raters independently reviewed the full text of each remaining 
article and removed those in which basic inclusion criteria were not met (e.g., absence of an 
exercise intervention). We also removed publications from consideration that either did not 
report anxiety outcomes or did not compare exercise to a control or comparison group. This 
level of review was conducted using a standardized form enumerating the inclusion criteria. 
Some of the studies reviewed during this step allowed individuals to participate if they had 
either elevated anxiety or another condition (e.g., depression, medical comorbidities). In 
these cases, we eliminated studies that did not provide data on anxiety-related outcomes 
specifically for the participants with elevated pre-treatment anxiety.

Each of the remaining publications was randomly assigned to two reviewers for data 
extraction. Information gathered in this step included study sample characteristics, 
experimental design, measures of anxiety, modality, intensity, and duration of exercise, 
methodological features such as intention to treat, blinding, and allocation concealment, 
primary (i.e., anxiety-related) and secondary outcomes, and results. Extracted data were 
compiled on a standardized form and reviewed for inter-rater discrepancies, which 
reviewing authors resolved via mutual discussion. In the rare instances in which

discrepancies remained after this discussion, these were resolved by a third independent 
rater.

During this process, if multiple publications were found to be referring to the same RCT, a 
final round of data extraction was conducted. A third reviewer, treating the articles as a 
single study, extracted data that was submitted for discrepancy resolution with the preceding 
reviewers. Thus, if critical information had only been reported in one of the publications, the 
quality of the RCT was evaluated on the basis of all available study data.

Study quality and relative risk of bias from design of each RCTs were also assessed using 
the PEDro Scale (52), a widely used instrument to rate the overall quality of RCTs. PEDro 
scores are summarized across domains and those with higher scores (range: 0-10) are 
considered to have better quality. Briefly, after the first PEDro item, specification of 
eligibility criteria, the remaining 10 items are worth 1 point apiece and comprise the 
following criteria: random allocation of participants to groups; allocation concealment; 
similarity of groups at baseline; blinding of participants; blinding of interventionists; 
blinding of assessors of at least one key outcome; obtainment of a key outcome variable 
from 85% or more participants; intention-to-treat data collection and analysis; results 
reported for between-group differences on at least one key outcome; point measurements 
and measurements of variability reported for at least one key outcome. Because of our 
selection criteria, all studies automatically received a point each for randomizing 
participants to conditions and for reporting between-group differences on a key outcome. 
However, all studies also lost 2 points total for items 5 (blinding of all subjects) and 6 
(blinding of all therapists), which were not relevant, as participants were randomized to 
receive exercise and the interventionists delivering the exercise treatment obviously could 
not be blinded to treatment condition.

Review of Meta-Analyses

In addition to our review of individual RCTs, we also surveyed the existing meta-analyses 
on exercise and anxiety. Our article search initially returned 203 unique records that were 
either review articles or meta-analyses. We included meta-analyses identified through our 
search that met similar criteria to the RCTs: anxiety as a primary focus of the meta-analysis, 
exercise as an intervention for anxiety, adult participants, and random assignment to 
treatment groups, in which at least one treatment was exercise. Our literature search did not 
reveal any meta-analyses that concerned both elevated anxiety symptoms (not diagnoses 
alone) and multiple sessions of exercise. Because of the few meta-analyses and critical 
reviews in the area, we elected not to exclude meta-analyses that permitted single-bout 
exercise interventions.

RESULTS

Figure 1 displays the process by which articles were selected for inclusion in this review. A 
total of 3272 records were collected using our search methods. A total of 401 duplicate 
records were identified and removed, yielding 2871 unique articles reviewed at the abstract 
level. The majority of studies (n = 1856, 56.7%) were excluded at the abstract level because 
elevated anxiety or a diagnosis of anxiety was not identified as one of the participant

selection criteria. After abstract-level review, 33 of the 2871 publications (1.1%) remained 
and were examined at the full-text level. Full-text review resulted in exclusion of an 
additional 14 publications. Reasons for exclusion were the following: patients did not have 
elevated anxiety (53, 54, 55); anxiety was not measured or reported as an outcome (56, 57, 
58); participants were not randomized or there was no explicit indication that participants 
were randomized to treatment (59); exercise was not clearly required as part of the 
intervention (60, 61). Notably, in two studies we identified for full-text review, all study 
groups engaged in some form of exercise, so that there was no valid non-exercise 
comparison group. In one trial, 22 individuals participating in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) 
with high anxiety related to outdoor walking were assigned to either walking or cycling at 
equal work output, with no non-exercising control (62). In the other trial, 70 psychiatric 
inpatients were randomized to either aerobic exercise (walking, jogging) or resistance 
exercise (strength training) (63). Finally, three studies were removed because outcomes were 
not reported specifically on anxious participants. One trial (64) included elevated anxiety 
among many other possible inclusion criteria, such as physical health problems or 
depression, and anxiety outcomes were not reported separately. Similarly, one study (65) 
selected participants on the basis of any non-psychotic DSM diagnosis, and another study 
(66) enrolled patients with elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression, and these groups 
were not distinguished from one another.

As a result, 19 articles concerning exercise RCTs among anxious individuals were 
identified. In the process of data extraction, we determined that in seven cases, multiple 
publications referred to the same trial. These cases comprised the following: a study among 
46 individuals with diagnoses of Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia comparing jogging, 
clomipramine, and waitlist control (67, 68, 69); a study comparing unsupervised gym 
exercise to mindfulness-based stress reduction among 56 individuals with Social Anxiety 
Disorder (SAD) (70, 71, 72); a study of 30 individuals with GAD assigned to resistance 
exercise, aerobic exercise, or waitlist control (73, 74); a study of 85 individuals with 
diagnoses of GAD, Panic Disorder, or SAD who participated in both group CBT and either 
unsupervised exercise or healthy eating education (75, 76); a study of 201 patients with 
elevated anxiety or depression and recent acute myocardial infarction assigned to CR or 
usual care (77, 78). As a result, we ultimately identified 12 RCTs that met our inclusion 
criteria (Table 1).

Sample Characteristics

The samples included in these RCTs were conducted in North America, Europe, the Middle 
East, and Australia. Of the 12 RCTs identified, 6 were conducted in the United States, 2 in 
Germany, and 1 each in France, Israel, Norway, and Spain. Samples varied greatly in gender 
composition (range: 11-100% female) and age (range: 19-64 years). Most studies sampled 
from a general population of adults; two studies recruited patients from primary care 
settings; one study was conducted among individuals with intellectual disabilities at a 
residential center (79), and one recruited hospital nurses exclusively (80).

Diagnoses and anxiety symptoms used for study inclusion also varied greatly. Panic 
Disorder, the most common criterion for inclusion, was studied in four RCTs. High general

anxiety symptoms (e.g., elevated scores on a self-report measure) or a Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder (GAD) diagnosis were only used as inclusion criteria for four studies (73, 74, 75, 
76); (77, 78); (81). Two studies (82, 83) examined anxiety sensitivity rather than anxiety 
symptoms, and two other studies required that participants have concurrent anxiety and 
depression symptoms (77, 78, 81). We identified one RCT of participants with symptoms of 
PTSD (80). One RCT (77, 78) included individuals with elevated anxiety symptoms, 
depressive symptoms, or both; we included this in our review because not only were 92% of 
participants identified as anxious, but also primary outcomes were reported for those 
participants who were anxious specifically.

Six studies assessed pre-treatment anxiety using structured diagnostic interviews and five 
studies relied on self-report measures. One study reported that participants had been 
“diagnosed with anxiety” without providing further information (79).

Exercise Interventions

Aerobic exercise was the most common exercise modality, employed in 8 RCTs (66%) and 
in tandem or compared to resistance exercise in two others. Six of the RCTs reported 
exercise intensity, ranging from 50% to 90% of maximum heart rate or work output. The 
length of the exercise interventions was also highly variable, and ranged from two weeks to 
six months. In one RCT (70, 71, 72), participants were directed to exercise on their own for 
24 sessions over 8 weeks, but participants were not observed and adherence to the exercise 
prescription apparently was not measured. In their study design, aerobic exercise was used a 
control group and compared to mindfulness-based stress reduction.

Exercise was supervised in eight of the RCTs. In two others (67, 68, 69, 84), participants 
had only one of three weekly running sessions supervised by an exercise trainer. Exercise 
was not supervised in the remaining two studies (70, 71, 72, 75, 76).

None of the RCTs compared different levels of exercise intensity or examined a dose-
response relationship between exercise intensity and anxiety reduction.

Two studies (62, 63) of anxious participants involved multiple sessions of exercise, but were 
excluded in the final review because all participants exercised, leaving no appropriate 
comparison group. One study that was included (73, 74) compared two different modalities 
of exercise (aerobic vs. resistance), at equal work output, to a waitlist control. One other 
study (80) compared participants completing a mindfulness-based stretching exercise routine 
to individuals receiving no intervention. Although the intensity of exercise was not 
stipulated as part of the intervention, the routine was characterized as increasing in intensity 
over several weeks. Thus, we elected to include this study for further review.

In half of the studies, RCTs compared exercise interventions to a waitlist condition or no 
intervention or usual care. In the other studies, the efficacy of exercise was compared to that 
of psychological interventions such as CBT (75, 76, 85), relaxation training (84), 
mindfulness-based stress reduction (70, 71, 72), psychiatric medication or placebo (67, 68, 
69), or non-exercise physical activity and vocational activities (79).

Study Quality

Page 8

We compiled information concerning study design to determine relative strength and quality 
of the RCTs. Blinded outcomes assessments were conducted in 5 of the 12 studies; 5 of the 
remaining 7 used self-report outcome measures exclusively. Similarly, only 5 studies 
controlled for outside protocol interventions for anxiety, directing participants to discontinue 
or avoid starting another treatment prior to entering the study. One of the RCTs (73, 74) 
found that 4 of 30 participants had been exposed to an outside intervention during the study, 
although post hoc analyses showed no significant difference in primary outcomes between 
these and other participants. A third of the studies included a co-intervention for some or all 
participants, either medication or talk therapy.

With respect to sample size, only one of the 12 RCTs had a sample size over 100 
participants (77, 78); in half of the studies, fewer than 50 participants were included in the 
trial, with no more than 19 participants assigned to exercise. The participant attrition rate 
tended to be high, ranging from 0 to 52% (mean attrition = 18.4%). Half the studies reported 
20% or greater attrition, with three studies having more than a 30% dropout rate. Intent-to-
treat (ITT) analysis was employed in only 50% of studies. Of note, at least one study 
indicated that an ITT analysis was performed, but reported primarily an analysis of study 
completers (67, 68, 69). Only one of the RCTs (85) made reference to allocation 
concealment during randomization.

Regarding quality ratings, PEDro scores were calculated using all applicable methodological 
characteristics, such as randomization, blinding, attrition rate, analysis, and risk of reporting 
bias. All PEDro scores for the RCTs fell within the low to medium range, between 4 and 7. 
However, it is important to note that each study started with a minimum of 2 points based on 
the eligibility criteria for inclusion in our review (random assignment to groups, outcomes 
reported on key variable), and studies were penalized 2 points because participants and 
interventionists could not be blinded to treatment condition (exercise versus non-exercise 
control). In addition, it should be noted that summary scores provide a limited assessment of 
study bias, particularly regarding threats to internal validity (86, 87, 88). For example, 
contamination of exercise with concurrent therapies was observed in some of the RCTs, 
such as mindfulness training (80) and CBT (77, 78); although this is not counted as a 
methodological weakness within the PEDro scoring system, it poses a major threat to the 
internal validity of the study.

Anxiety Measures

Measures used to assess anxiety outcomes were highly variable. The most common 
instruments were the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (89), with an original, 
modified, or translated version used in 4 of the 12 studies, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory 
(BAI) (90), used in 3 of the 12 studies. Other instruments included the Agoraphobia 
Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ) (91), Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory (ASI) (92) and ASI-
Revised (ASI-R) (93); Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ) (91); Clinical Global

Interaction Anxiety Scale-Straightforward Scale (SIAS-S) (103); State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory (STAI) (104). Of note, five studies employed measures that were not used in any 
of the other RCTs.

Results of the Exercise Interventions

Regarding the effectiveness of exercise interventions, 4 of the 12 studies reported that the 
group receiving an exercise intervention showed superior anxiety outcomes compared to 
those of the control group, such as reduction in anxiety symptoms (80, 81) or reduction in 
anxiety sensitivity (82, 83). Three RCTs showed no significant post-test difference between 
exercise and no-exercise groups (71, 72, 75, 76, 85). In one of these cases (85), participants 
who performed aerobic and resistance showed comparable improvements on general anxiety 
symptom measures to those who received group CBT. However, on several measures of 
panic and agoraphobia, the CBT group showed greater improvement compared to the 
exercise group.

The remaining five studies also had mixed results. One study of patients with intellectual 
disability in a residential setting (79) compared aerobic exercise with a leisure program 
consisting of large body movements focused on stability, flexibility, and balance, as well as 
vocational activities as a control condition. The aerobic or leisure programs, but not 
vocational activities, were associated with significant reductions in anxiety symptoms. 
Another RCT found that resistance exercise, but not aerobic exercise, yielded significant 
reductions in symptoms of GAD (73, 74). In a study of patients recovering from acute 
myocardial infarction, participants in CR and usual care both exhibited similar reductions in 
anxiety symptoms, though those who engaged in the rehabilitation achieved improvement 
sooner (77, 78). Patients who enrolled in CR also participated in group-based CBT, 
however, so one cannot attribute these benefits specifically to exercise. In a study of 
individuals with Panic Disorder (67, 68, 69), clomipramine showed equivalent or superior 
outcomes to aerobic exercise, although both treatments performed better than placebo. 
Finally, in a comparison of exercise and relaxation training for treating Panic Disorder (84), 
both treatment groups improved. Exercise showed greater improvement than relaxation 
training at 4 weeks, but this effect did not persist after 6, 8, and 10 weeks.

Surprisingly, only four of the 12 RCTs reported significant improvements in fitness after 
exercise treatment. One study (67, 68, 69) observed statistically significant improvements in 
HAM-A and BAI scores for participants who either ran or took clomipramine for 10 weeks, 
compared to controls, although a measure of fitness—timed running distance—was 
comparable at post-test for all study groups, including the non-exercisers. In another study, 
Herring and colleagues (73, 74) observed improvements in leg strength for resistance 
exercisers but not aerobic exercisers. In three other studies, exercise and control groups 
showed no significant differences in fitness levels after training. In five studies, fitness 
levels or post-exercise improvements were not reported or measured.

Only two of the 12 RCTs included post-treatment follow-up to assess the sustained effects 
of the intervention. In one study (80), mindfulness-based exercise, but not aerobic exercise, 
showed a benefit at 8 weeks after training was completed. In the other study (77, 78) that

found CR patients to show improvements in anxiety compared to patients in usual care, this 
difference did not persist after the completion of the 8-week program. The extent to which 
participants continued to exercise after the intervention period was not assessed in either 
study.

Review of Meta-Analyses

From the 203 records identified as reviews or meta-analyses, we identified 5 published 
meta-analyses of studies of exercise interventions on anxiety (47, 48, 49, 105, 106) (Table 
2). The most inclusive of these meta-analyses included any type of exercise intervention 
(106), whereas the most restrictive analysis required a 3-week minimum of exercise 
participation (47). Of the five meta-analyses, four concluded that exercise is an effective 
treatment for anxiety, with effect sizes ranging from 0.22 (small) to 0.56 (moderate). 
However, participants without elevated anxiety or with no anxiety diagnosis were included 
in these analyses. Because only one meta-analysis restricted its scope to include only 
participants without elevated anxiety (48), the utility of exercise to ameliorate anxiety in 
clinical samples could not be determined.

The remaining meta-analysis by Bartley and colleagues (105) addressed exercise RCTs 
among individuals with any diagnosed anxiety disorder (aside from PTSD). Results found 
no significant difference between exercise and control conditions for anxiety outcomes (ES 
= 0.02). Moderator analyses suggest that this non-significant finding could be attributed to 
between-study heterogeneity. When analysis was restricted to studies comparing exercise 
with placebo or waitlist controls, exercise showed a significant effect (SMD = 1.42), but no 
significant difference was found for exercise compared to other anxiolytic treatments such 
as CBT (SMD = -0.28). Thus, results of the meta-analysis suggested that exercise provided 
similar benefit to other established treatments for anxiety and resulted in superior outcomes 
compared with treatment or placebo treatment. It should be noted that moderator analyses 
based on a subsample of available studies is problematic because only 7 studies met 
inclusion criteria for the full analysis, and the analysis combined a heterogeneous group of 
anxiety disorders into a single entity. RCTs among individuals with elevated anxiety 
symptoms but without an anxiety diagnosis were not included, and the diagnoses present 
were similarly heterogeneous to those found in our current review.

DISCUSSION

The present systematic review sought to describe what is known about the efficacy of 
exercise for treatment of anxiety. Our search identified 12 RCTs and 5 meta-analyses that 
satisfactorily addressed this issue. We systematically reviewed the extant studies and 
extracted data on sample characteristics, study design, key methodological features, and 
anxiety outcomes. The majority of studies concluded that, as a treatment for elevated anxiety 
or anxiety disorders, exercise offers benefits comparable to established treatments, including 
medication or CBT, and better than those of placebo or waitlist control. However, review of 
available RCTs and meta-analyses revealed that most studies suffer from significant 
methodological limitations that leave the issue of the use of exercise to treat anxiety 
unresolved.

Because of the heterogeneity in the definition of “anxiety” and “exercise” across the various 
RCTs, we believe that it is inappropriate to combine the data from these diverse studies in a 
quantitative way. We therefore elected to perform a comprehensive, qualitative review of 
the extant studies. This approach contrasts with prior reviews (49, 50), which have 
attempted to evaluate the exercise-anxiety relationship statistically, including through meta-
analysis. Given the important methodological differences and shortcomings of the studies 
we identified, we instead elected to provide a more qualitative and critical analysis of the 
existing literature.

One recent review (50) limited its scope to exercise RCTs only among individuals with 
anxiety diagnoses. This group located a total of 8 RCTs meeting their inclusion criteria. 
Three of the trials evaluated by this group (67, 68, 69, 75, 76, 84) also met the inclusion 
criteria for the present review. The remaining five studies did not meet our inclusion criteria. 
These studies comprised trials (a) among individuals with any non-psychotic psychiatric 
diagnosis, not anxiety alone (65), (b) with a single-bout exercise intervention (37), (c) with 
no non-exercise control group (63), (d) with an intervention that did not require exercise for 
all participants receiving it (60), and (e) with an outcome measure encompassing general 
quality of life rather than anxiety specifically (57). Our perspective is that these studies by 
design cannot provide sufficient evidence either for or against the hypothesis that exercise 
reduces symptoms of anxiety in anxious individuals. In contrast, 9 additional RCTs were 
included in the present review. These studies comprised five exercise trials to reduce anxiety 
among individuals with anxiety diagnoses, to include Social Anxiety Disorder (70, 71, 72), 
GAD (73, 74), PTSD (80), Panic Disorder (85), and any anxiety diagnosis (79). In addition, 
our review included four trials among individuals with elevated symptoms of anxiety (77, 
78, 81) or anxiety sensitivity (82, 83). We believe that including these trials more accurately 
represents the available evidence concerning exercise as a treatment for anxiety.

Unlike depression, for which many RCTs exist and have been the subject of many reviews 
and meta-analyses (44, 45, 46), research on exercise in patients with anxiety is significantly 
more limited. Furthermore, whereas depressive symptoms may be conceptualized along a 
single continuum (107, 108), anxiety disorders represent distinct clusters of symptoms 
within a broad constellation of diagnoses. One exception to this pattern would be GAD. 
However, GAD and broad anxiety symptoms were studied in only 3 RCTs. The most 
commonly represented disorder in our review, Panic Disorder (4 of 12 RCTs), has a lifetime 
prevalence of less than 5%, well below the lifetime 30% prevalence of anxiety disorders as a 
whole (2). Because of the great heterogeneity in inclusion criteria in exercise RCTs for 
anxiety, we cannot be confident that exercise will improve symptoms of anxiety in any 
given diagnostic group.

We also observed great variation in exercise interventions, with studies involving different 
modes of exercise for different durations and varied intensities. We were surprised to 
discover that aerobic fitness often was not measured, and when it was, it often did not 
improve after exercise interventions, despite the fact that anxiety was reduced. For example, 
participants in one study (67, 68, 69) showed lower HAM-A and BAI scores among 
participants assigned to running, but at 10-week post-test, their timed running distance was 
not different from controls. Interestingly, in the one RCT that compared two exercise

modalities (73, 74), resistance exercise showed better fitness and lower POMS-T scores at 
post-test, but aerobic exercise did not. Most studies failed to document improvements in 
cardiorespiratory function associated with exercise training (e.g., changes in VO2 or 
submaximal heart rates at matching workloads), which also is problematic, as such changes 
in physical fitness would provide an important manipulation check to verify that the exercise 
intervention was sufficient to produce expected cardiopulmonary benefits and improved 
functional capacity. Similarly, few studies used the same instruments to measure anxiety 
outcomes, and in many cases, these measures appear to be specific to one population (e.g., 
those with panic symptoms or PTSD symptoms), limiting generalizability.

Existing RCTs also had other methodological problems that limit our ability to draw 
definitive conclusions. One third of the trials did not control for outside interventions for 
anxiety. For example, in the one RCT that had a sample of over 100 participants, 
participants assigned to exercise also received CBT and relaxation training concurrently (77, 
78), which seriously detracted from the methodological quality of the study. Another RCT 
only delivered exercise in the context of a mindfulness intervention (80). Attrition of 20% or 
greater was noted in half of the trials. Intent-to-treat analysis was reported in only half of the 
studies, with one of these reporting primarily an analysis of completers (67, 68, 69). In many 
cases, self-report outcomes were the only posttest measures of anxiety employed. Taken 
together, examination of what are widely considered the most important methodological 
quality indicators revealed that existing studies have significant methodological weaknesses 
and a moderate risk of bias.

One way to determine the strength of exercise as an effective treatment for anxious 
individuals is to observe a dose-response effect. Such evidence would be critical to 
establishing a direct treatment effect of exercise on anxiety. Unfortunately, this important 
issue has been minimally explored in the literature. A prior meta-analysis (49), which found 
an overall benefit of exercise for anxiety reduction, attempted to quantify a dose-response 
relationship. One trial of individuals with Panic Disorder did compare directly the effects of 
a single bout of light or heavy physical activity on panic symptoms, finding that more 
intense activity did have a greater antipanic effect (37). However, this study enrolled a 
sample of only 18 participants and had no non-exercise control group. Because no rigorous 
RCTs have conducted a direct, experimental comparison of exercise volume (intensity and 
duration) on anxious participants, an optimal dose of exercise cannot be determined. 
Randomizing participants to differing intensities or frequencies of exercise is needed to 
determine the optimal dose of exercise to reduce anxiety. This approach has been used 
successfully in research on exercise for depression (109) but has not been investigated for 
anxiety.

Our review revealed that exercise interventions often were unsupervised and that intensity 
and frequency of exercise was typically either not reported or not manipulated as part of the 
study design. For example, some running interventions encouraged participants to increase 
their pace over several weeks, but only one session per week was supervised (67, 68, 69, 
84), and in other RCTs, participants were directed to do exercise of their choosing (70, 71, 
72). Of note, some trials of single-bout exercise have suggested that a dose-response effect 
may exist, though findings have been equivocal. For example, one study found that healthy

individuals completing 20 minutes of low-intensity resistance exercise with weightlifting 
machines had immediate reductions in state anxiety, whereas anxiety increased among the 
high-intensity group (110). Another study found significant reductions in anxiety sensitivity 
for healthy individuals completing low- and high-intensity treadmill exercise, with greater 
reductions among the high-intensity group (111). Importantly, individuals can give differing 
self-reports of their affective response after a single bout of exercise, depending on how 
soon this self-report is solicited (112). Further research to address the optimal dose of 
exercise is needed.

Few studies have examined exercise as an adjunctive treatment. We identified one RCT (75, 
76) that examined the effect of exercise compared to education control among anxious 
participants receiving group CBT; no treatment group differences were observed. Another 
study (84) used a 2x2 design to explore the utility of aerobic exercise and an SSRI 
(paroxetine), separately and combined, with no differences for combined versus unimodal 
treatment. Further research is needed to confirm whether adding exercise to other treatments 
confers a benefit to individuals with anxiety.

The issue of the mechanism(s) by which exercise affects anxiety seldom has been studied, 
although several potential pathways have been identified (113). Potential physiological 
explanations include regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increases 
in serotonergic and noradrenergic levels in the brain, and endogenous opioid release. 
Psychological factors may also play a key role. For example, interventions such as CBT for 
anxiety often employ exposure to feared sensations or situations, combined with prevention 
of maladaptive responses that provide short-term relief (24). The mechanism by which CBT 
is effective remains poorly understood (114). However, in this case, the intervention is 
intended to promote habituation and a reduction in anxiety symptoms (24). Indeed, two 
studies we reviewed (82, 83) aimed to reduce anxiety sensitivity through aerobic exercise, 
which can create sensations similar to anxiety or panic (e.g., rapid heartbeat). Interestingly, 
one study that did not meet our inclusion criteria (62) involved individuals participating in 
CR who had elevated anxiety specific to walking. Anxiety improved among individuals who 
were assigned to walk for exercise but not in those assigned to cycling, suggesting that 
exposure to a specific feared stimulus may have helped. Alternatively, exercise may 
improve self-efficacy through progressive positive feedback, such as fitness gains (113). 
Existing evidence from RCTs does not adequately address whether exercise can reduce 
anxiety via improvements in fitness and related physiological changes, psychological 
changes, or a combination of factors; indeed, the relative paucity of evidence leaves open 
the question of whether a direct mechanism for exercise to reduce anxiety exists.

We included studies in our review in which participants’ anxiety symptoms did not 
necessarily meet criteria for anxiety disorders in DSM-5. For example, two of the identified 
RCTs address high anxiety sensitivity, a marker that may serve as a precursor to panic 
attacks or GAD. In addition, one RCT (80) was conducted among individuals with PTSD, a 
diagnosis which is now in a separate classification from anxiety disorders (1). We included 
these RCTs to address anxiety as broadly as possible, in light of the scarcity of the existing 
literature and the heterogeneity of populations sampled; we also did not identify any 
completed RCTs among individuals with DSM-5-diagnosed anxiety disorders.

Although a few RCTs included participants with one of several anxiety diagnoses, no single 
study addressed the issue of whether one anxiety disorder was more responsive to exercise 
than another, or whether situational anxiety symptoms responded as well to exercise as did 
persistent symptoms of anxiety. Testing for such moderator effects would be valuable but 
would require trials with larger samples than have been used to date.

The present review has several limitations. We did not personally contact researchers about 
unpublished RCTs, so the potential bias of the ‘file drawer effect’ (115, 116) could not be 
determined. However, because such unpublished studies were likely to suffer from 
significant methodological weaknesses or yield ‘null’ effects, it is unlikely that these 
additional data would alter our conclusions. Second, we limited our search to individuals of 
ages 18 years and over. Although we elected not include children in our review, we 
performed an additional search of our database for studies of exercise in anxious children. 
We failed to identify a single RCT of exercise training in persons under 18 years old that 
met our inclusion criteria. Therefore, we cannot comment on the potential benefits of 
exercise for children with elevated anxiety and suggest that this is an important, and 
understudied, area for future research.

In summary, findings from the present review suggest that exercise could be a useful, 
affordable, accessible treatment for anxiety. However, there appears to be a paucity of data 
from well-designed RCTs, and the methodological limitations in the existing trials of 
exercise preclude drawing definitive conclusions about its effectiveness. Indeed, the existing 
literature is marked by small trials with weak internal validity. At present, the existing body 
of evidence is not of sufficient scientific rigor to recommend it as a treatment among 
individuals with clinically elevated anxiety. Future research will require robust experimental 
designs and greater attention to critical methodological details including appropriate control 
groups, adequate sample sizes, use of intent-to-treat analysis, blinding of assessors, 
allocation concealment, monitoring of exercise adherence and intensity, documentation of 
aerobic “training effects,” and selection of well-validated instruments to assess anxiety 
before and following treatment.
