Abstract

Social isolation has been recognized as a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in humans 
for more than a quarter of a century. Although the focus of research has been on objective social 
roles and health behavior, the brain is the key organ for forming, monitoring, maintaining, 
repairing, and replacing salutary connections with others. Accordingly, population-based 
longitudinal research indicates that perceived social isolation (loneliness) is a risk factor for 
morbidity and mortality independent of objective social isolation and health behavior. Human and 
animal investigations of neuroendocrine stress mechanisms that may be involved suggest that (a) 
chronic social isolation increases the activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical axis, 
and (b) these effects are more dependent on the disruption of a social bond between a significant 
pair than objective isolation per se. The relational factors and neuroendocrine, neurobiological, 
and genetic mechanisms that may contribute to the association between perceived isolation and 
mortality are reviewed.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic social isolation has long been recognized as a risk factor for broad-based morbidity 
and mortality. The early evidence for this association came from epidemiological studies, 
where social isolation has typically been defined in terms of objective features of the social 
environment such as the absence of a spouse, having less than monthly contact with friends 
and family, and/or having no participation in organizations, clubs, or religious groups (e.g., 
House et al. 1988). At that time, health behaviors were already known to have a strong 
impact on morbidity and mortality, and the primary explanation for the association between

isolation and mortality—the social control hypothesis—emphasized the impact of friends 
and family on a person’s health behaviors. Specifically, the hypothesis posits that 
internalized obligations to, and the overt influence of, network members (e.g., spouses, 
family members, friends) encourage individuals to exhibit good health behaviors such as 
adequate sleep, diet, exercise, and compliance with medical regimens, and discourage 
individuals from health-damaging behaviors such as smoking, excessive eating, drug abuse, 
and excessive alcohol consumption (House 2001, Umberson 1987). In sum, the social 
control hypothesis places the focus on the social control of a person’s health behaviors.

SOCIAL ISOLATION: A SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE PERSPECTIVE

A contrasting perspective that places social endocrinology front and center begins with the 
proposition that the brain is the key organ for forming, monitoring, maintaining, repairing, 
and replacing salutary connections with others as well as regulating physiological processes 
relevant to morbidity and mortality (Cacioppo & Berntson 1992). The human brain does not 
simply respond to stimuli (including people) in an invariant fashion, but rather it categorizes, 
abstracts, interprets, and evaluates incoming stimuli in light of current states and goals as 
well as prior knowledge and predispositions.

The demographic and environmental factors associated negatively with perceived social 
isolation [or what Weiss (1973) termed loneliness] include marriage, having offspring, 
higher levels of education, and larger number of siblings (Distel et al. 2010), whereas those 
factors related positively to loneliness include male gender, physical health symptoms, 
chronic work or social stress, small social network, and lack of a spousal confidant (e.g., 
Hawkley et al. 2008).1 However, the same objective social relationship (e.g., spouse) can be 
perceived as caring and protective or as exploitive and isolating based on a host of factors 
including an individual’s prior experiences, current attributions, and overall preference for 
social contact. Moreover, people may find themselves with others who heighten their sense 
of threat and isolation (e.g., an untrustworthy sibling or an arch enemy), or they may choose 
to be alone at times while still feeling connected to others (e.g., a new mother taking a break 
from caregiving). Accordingly, the association between indices of perceived and objective 
social isolation is mediated by the perceived quality of social relationships, and perceived 
social isolation (i.e., loneliness) has been found to predict increased morbidity and mortality 
(e.g., Caspi et al. 2006, Holt-Lunstad et al. 2010, Patterson & Veenstra 2010, Penninx et al. 
1997, Seeman 2000) even after adjusting for objective social isolation and health behaviors 
(Luo et al. 2012, Luo & Waite 2014; see also Hawkley et al. 2009).

Why is the perception of social isolation important to consider? Sociality has costs (e.g., 
competition for food and mates, exploitation, increased risk of pathogen transmission) as 
well as benefits (e.g., mutual protection and assistance, transmission of foraging skills). The 
social structures and behaviors relevant to mitigating the costs of sociality (e.g., dominance 
hierarchies, signals of submission, ostracism, punitive altruism) and those relevant to 
garnering the benefits of sociality (e.g., mother-infant attachment, cheating) ultimately 

1Ethnic differences in loneliness tend to be attributable primarily to differences in socioeconomic status, and the (inverse) association 
between income and loneliness is explicable in terms of marital status, with loneliness lower and family income higher in married than 
unmarried individuals (cf. Hawkley et al. 2008).

contribute to survival and reproduction, but they do so differently and appear to be 
instantiated differently in the brain. Human and animal research on the effects of social 
isolation on the brain suggests the involvement of multiple, functionally distinct brain 
mechanisms including neural mechanisms involved in social threat surveillance and aversion 
(e.g., amygdala, anterior insula, anterior cingulate), social reward (e.g., ventral striatum), and 
attention to one’s self-preservation in a social context (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, medial pre-
frontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus, temporal parietal junction) (Bickart et al. 2012; 
Cacioppo et al. 2009, 2012, 2013; Eisenberger & Cole 2012; Klumpp et al. 2012).

In many contexts across human history, a chief threat to a person’s reproductive success and 
survival has come from other humans. The perception of isolation from others—of being on 
the social perimeter—is not only unhappy but also signals danger across phylogeny. Fish 
have evolved to swim to the middle of the group when predators approach (Ioannou et al. 
2012), mice housed in social isolation rather than in pairs show sleep disruptions and 
reduced slow wave sleep (Kaushal et al. 2012), and prairie voles when isolated from their 
partner and subsequently placed in an open field show less exploratory behavior and more 
predator evasion (Grippo et al. 2014). These behaviors reflect an increased emphasis on self-
preservation when on the social perimeter, an emphasis that increases the likelihood of 
survival. For instance, fish on the edge of a school are more likely to be attacked by 
predatory fish, not because they are the slowest or weakest, but because it is easier to isolate 
and prey upon those on the social perimeter (Ioannou et al. 2012).

These behavioral results suggest a more general principle, specifically, that perceived social 
isolation activates neural, neuroendocrine, and behavioral responses that promote short-term 
self-preservation. Among the range of neural and behavioral effects of perceived isolation 
documented in human adults are an increased implicit vigilance for social threats along with 
increased anxiety, hostility, and social withdrawal; increased sleep fragmentation and 
daytime fatigue; increased vascular resistance and altered gene expression and immunity; 
decreased impulse control in favor of responses highest in the response hierarchy (i.e., 
prepotent responding); increased negativity and depressive symptomatology; and increased 
age-related cognitive decline and risk of dementia (cf. Cacioppo & Hawkley 2009).

Indeed, growing evidence indicates that loneliness increases attention to negative social 
stimuli (e.g., social threats, rejection, exclusion). For instance, lonely compared to nonlonely 
individuals worry more about being evaluated negatively and feel more threatened in social 
situations (even when they are not more likely to be rejected; Jones et al. 1981), and these 
differences are found when loneliness is measured across individuals or is manipulated 
experimentally (Cacioppo et al. 2006). The effects of loneliness on attention to potential 
social threats appear to be largely implicit. In a modified emotional Stroop task, lonely 
participants relative to nonlonely participants show greater Stroop interference for negative 
social compared to negative nonsocial words (see review by Cacioppo & Hawkley 2009). 
Stroop interference is used to gauge the implicit processing of stimuli, so these results 
suggest that loneliness is associated with a heightened accessibility of negative social 
information. Consistent with this reasoning, Yamada & Decety (2009) investigated the 
effects of subliminal priming on the detection of painful facial expressions and found that

lonely individuals are more sensitive to the presence of pain in dislikable faces than are 
nonlonely individuals.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging research also indicates that loneliness is associated 
with greater activation of the visual cortex in response to negative social images in contrast 
to negative nonsocial images (Cacioppo et al. 2009), and eye tracking research similarly 
shows that individuals high in loneliness are more likely to first fixate on and to spend a 
greater proportion of their initial viewing time looking at socially threatening stimuli in a 
social scene, whereas individuals low in loneliness are more likely to first fixate on and 
spend a greater proportion of their initial viewing time looking at positive stimuli in a social 
scene (Bangee et al. 2014). Further evidence for the effect of perceived isolation on 
nonconscious processes in humans comes from cross-sectional and longitudinal research 
showing that loneliness predicts more fragmented sleep (Cacioppo et al. 2002a, Kurina et al. 
2011). Finally, whether measured in a hospital laboratory (Cacioppo et al. 2002b) or over the 
course of a normal day using ambulatory procedures (Hawkley et al. 2003), loneliness is 
associated with elevated tonic vascular resistance—a marker of threat surveillance (Mendes 
et al. 2002).

These changes observed in human and animal studies support short-term self-preservation 
by preparing the individual to detect and defend against any potential assault as well as to 
identify and solicit any socially mediated resources (e.g., food, shelter, reproductive 
opportunities) that may become available. These effects extend beyond early developmental 
periods, in part through mechanisms in the adult brain that permit adaptation to the 
functional demands of a fluid social environment. Although the function of these 
physiological and behavioral adjustments may be to increase the likelihood of short-term 
survival, they carry long-term costs, especially when the perception of social isolation 
becomes chronic.

To the extent that the brain is the central organ for evaluating interpersonal relationships, the 
neuroendocrine system becomes an important system through which perceived social 
isolation may operate, at least in part, to affect morbidity and mortality. We begin with a 
brief description of the two major neuroendocrine axes that respond to stressors—the 
sympathetic adrenomedullary (SAM) axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical 
(HPA) axis, and we examine the regulation of these axes by prefrontal and limbic regions of 
the central nervous system. We then summarize the human literature on the association 
between the perception of loneliness and neuroendocrine activity, emphasizing where 
possible the research designed to investigate the putative causal role of perceived isolation 
on neuroendocrine regulation.

Although the evidence from the human literature is suggestive, mechanistic animal studies in 
which adult animals are experimentally assigned to normal or socially isolated housing 
conditions are important for evaluating the causal effects of an individual being deprived of 
mutual assistance and companionship on neuroendocrine activity. We therefore also review 
representative animal investigations on the effects of isolation on neuroendocrine responses 
and briefly discuss recent literature on the impact of direct sympathetic innervation of 
lymphoid tissue (i.e., tissue responsible for the production of lymphocytes and antibodies).

We focus on experimental studies involving adult mammals because we seek to determine 
the possible role of the HPA and SAM axes in the association between perceived isolation 
and mortality in adults. We conclude with discussions of inconsistencies in the extant 
literature as well as the neurobiological mechanisms that may have been conserved across 
phylogeny to produce the sympathetic and neuroendocrine effects of perceived social 
isolation. Although also pertinent, a review of the oxytocinergic system and relevant animal 
and human literature is beyond the scope of this article. However, interested readers may 
wish to consult recent reviews of oxytocin and its effects on social endocrinology and 
behavior (e.g., Heinrichs et al. 2009, Insel 2010, Love 2014, Olff et al. 2013, Ross & Young 
2009, Taylor 2006).

THE NEUROENDOCRINE STRESS AXES

Schematics of the SAM and HPA axes are depicted in Figure 1. A cascade of signals travels 
from the prefrontal cortex and limbic regions (e.g., amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria 
terminalis) to the brain stem (e.g., locus coeruleus) and to the paraventricular nucleus of the 
hypothalamus. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) includes (a) sympathetic nerve fibers 
that directly innervate most major organ systems and locally release the catecholamine 
neurotransmitter norepinephrine, and (b) an adrenal-medullary (SAM) component mediated 
by splanchnic nerve innervation of the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, which 
releases catecholamines into the bloodstream. The direct innervation of the adrenal medulla 
by the SNS permits rapid neuroendocrine responses to acute stressors, and most of the 
circulating epinephrine (but only a small percentage of circulating norepinephrine) comes 
from the adrenal medulla (see Figure 1).

The HPA axis is sensitive to the interpretation by the brain of threats and stressors, and it 
influences a wide range of physiological, behavioral, and health outcomes (e.g., 
Charmandari et al. 2005, Hostinar et al. 2014, McEwen & Gianaros 2011, Sapolsky et al. 
2000). Unlike the adrenal medulla of the SAM axis, the adrenal cortex of the HPA axis is 
necessary for survival, and the HPA axis includes a negative feedback mechanism to limit its 
circulating hormonal outputs. The cascade of signals from prefrontal cortex and limbic 
regions to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus triggers the secretion of 
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) into the hypophyseal portal circulatory system. 
CRH has hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic actions, including the promotion of the 
release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary gland into 
circulation (see Figure 1).

ACTH travels through the blood to the adrenal cortex, where it stimulates the secretion of 
glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol in humans and most mammals, corticosterone in rodents) 
into circulation. The vast majority of circulating cortisol is bound to large proteins (e.g., 
cortisol binding globulin, albumin), and only a small fraction of unbound cortisol is thought 
to be biologically active—that is, to be free to bind to glucocorticoid receptors. This is 
important because the proportion of the glucocorticoids that is biologically active differs 
across tissues (e.g., salivary, blood, serum, urine), which means that assays from these 
tissues can reflect different aspects of HPA functioning. Assays of salivary cortisol have

become popular in human behavioral and biomedical research because cortisol levels 
measured in saliva are correlated with unbound cortisol levels in serum or plasma.

Glucocorticoids are small, lipophilic molecules that cross the blood-brain barrier, where they 
are involved in a number of processes including neuronal cell birth, differentiation, 
apoptosis, dendritic arborization, and synaptic function (McEwen & Gianaros 2011, 
Riedemann et al. 2010). Circulating glucocorticoids that pass through the blood-brain barrier 
also regulate HPA activation by acting on glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus 
(McEwen & Gianaros 2011). Specifically, the hippocampus, through inhibitory projections 
to the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus, contributes to the maintenance of 
cortisol concentrations within bounds by inhibiting the secretion of CRH from the 
hypothalamus as well as the production of ACTH in the pituitary gland (Chrousos 2009, 
Hawkley et al. 2012, Hostinar et al. 2014).

Glucocorticoids are released in a pulsatile fashion across the day to regulate numerous 
physiological processes including energy mobilization, inflammation, reproduction, and 
immune functioning. The release of these glucocorticoids has a circadian rhythm, with levels 
highest in the morning and lowest in the evening. Significant stressors can also alter HPA 
activity, for instance by increasing the frequency or magnitude of the pulsatile release either 
transiently or chronically (thereby producing transient or chronic changes in circulating 
cortisol levels), altering the maximal cortisol concentrations observed approximately 30 to 
45 minutes after awakening (termed the cortisol awakening response), or flattening the 
circadian rhythm.

A major focus in recent years has been on the environmental factors early in life that have 
lasting effects on HPA functioning and stress reactivity (e.g., Hostinar et al. 2014, Meaney & 
Szyf 2005). However, the HPA axis in adults remains responsive to metabolic needs, 
physiological inputs, and psychogenic stressors including social-evaluative threats 
(Dickerson & Kemeny 2004), and alterations of the activity of the adult HPA axis are 
associated with numerous deleterious psychological and physical health outcomes (Chrousos 
2009, Fries et al. 2009, Gunnar & Vazquez 2001) (for an overview of gene regulation by the 
HPA axis in adults, see sidebar Gene Regulation by the HPA Axis).

GENE REGULATION BY THE HPA AXIS

Glucocorticoids regulate a diverse array of physiologic processes by simultaneously 
altering the transcription of hundreds of genes. Following HPA axis activation, 
glucocorticoids circulate through the bloodstream to reach virtually every cell type in the 
body. Glucocorticoid molecules are small and easily diffuse across cell membranes and 
into the cytoplasm, where they can bind to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). 
Glucocorticoid binding prompts GRs to dissociate from their resting antagonist 
molecules and traffic into the nucleus of the cell, where they can bind to genes that 
contain specific DNA sequences called glucocorticoid response elements (GREs; a 
typical GRE is G.ACA…TGT.C, where “…” can be any nucleotide). In many cases, GR 
binding to a GRE serves to flag a gene for transcription into RNA and translation into a 
protein that can alter cellular function. Many metabolic effects of glucocorticoids are

mediated by such transcriptional induction of genes involved in glucose production. 
Some anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by transcriptional 
induction of molecules that inhibit immune responses. GR molecules can also inhibit the 
transcription of specific genes either by binding to their DNA sequences in locations that 
block access by other stimulatory molecules or by binding to stimulatory molecules in 
the cytoplasm and blocking their translocation to the nucleus. For example, many anti-
inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by GR antagonism of the 
proinflammatory transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. GR transcriptional repression 
also mediates the negative feedback loop in the hypothalamus that prevents accumulation 
of excessive glucocorticoid levels. The combination of strong transcriptional activation of 
some gene sets and transcriptional repression of other gene sets allows one specific 
hormonal signal to influence a diverse array of biological processes in a wide range of 
different cell types. GR signaling is itself subject to inhibition by other cellular signaling 
pathways via phosphorylation of GR proteins in the cytoplasm and by transcriptional 
downregulation of the NR3C1gene that encodes the GR protein. These dynamics can 
result in a state of glucocorticoid resistance in which normal or high levels of HPA 
activity have little or no effect on cellular function because the GR fails to translate the 
hormonal stimulus into a gene transcriptional response. Several studies now suggest that 
social threat in general, and loneliness in particular, is associated with glucocorticoid 
resistance and a complementary increase in proinflammatory gene expression that may 
contribute to some of the adverse health outcomes associated with perceived social 
isolation.

Neuroendocrine outputs are regulated by brain circuits, which translate perceptual and 
evaluative processes into specific patterns of hormonal release. The prefrontal cortex 
modulates attention, working memory, conflicting inputs, and emotion regulation as well as 
integrates information from plans (e.g., goals) and prior knowledge, information from 
peripheral afferents, and information from the environment—including the social 
environment—to coordinate neural, hormonal, and behavioral responses (Hostinar et al. 
2014, McEwen & Gianaros 2011). The prefrontal cortex also plays a role in orchestrating 
anticipatory neural, hormonal, and behavioral responses to minimize threats and 
perturbations. Environmental challenges and stressors can also increase the release of 
dopamine and acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex; dopamine and acetylcholine then play a 
role in modulating anxiety (Berntson et al. 2003), attention, and working memory (e.g., 
Sarter & Bruno 1997).2

Importantly, the prefrontal cortex has extensive neuroanatomical and functional connectivity 
with the limbic system, which in turn permits the modulation of HPA activity by the 

2Vagal afferents convey visceral information to the nucleus tractus solitarus, the major visceral relay nucleus of the brain stem (cf. 
Berntson et al. 2003). The nucleus tractus solitarus issues a direct noradrenergic projection to forebrain areas such as the amygdala, 
and via an excitatory input to the paragigantocellularis can also activate the ascending noradrenergic system arising in the locus 
coeruleus (Figure 1). The locus coeruleus, in turn, projects to the basal forebrain cholinergic system as well as to the amygdala and 
cortex. Thus, there are noradrenergic and cholinergic projections through which afferent information can impact appraisals of 
environmental circumstances, stimuli, and events (Berntson et al. 2003). Norepinephrine is principally synthesized in the brain in the 
locus coeruleus and—in addition to serotonin released from the raphe nuclei and dopamine from the ventral tegmental area, nucleus 
accumbens, striatum, and substantia nigra—has modulatory effects on the cortical and limbic regions involved in the control of the 
HPA axis (Riedemann et al. 2010).

resulting environmental appraisals, including appraisals of the quality of companionship and 
mutual assistance available in the social environment—a strong determinant of perceived 
social isolation (Hawkley et al. 2008). Within the limbic system, the central and medial 
nuclei of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are connected by 
cells throughout the stria terminalis, and both the amygdala and the BNST project to 
hypothalamic and brain stem areas that mediate autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral 
responses to aversive or threatening stimuli (Walker & Davis 2008). The BNST, like the 
amygdala, is composed of multiple distinct subnuclei, which differentially regulate HPA 
activation (Choi et al. 2007, Ulrich-Lai & Herman 2009). Connections also exist between 
the hippocampus and BNST; the hippocampus modulates the actions of the BNST through 
glutamate, whereas the amygdala acts on the BNST through CRH and gamma-aminobutyric 
acid (Riedemann et al. 2010).

The amygdala and the BNST are involved in fear and anxiety conditioning, respectively 
(Davis 1998)—two acquired behaviors that permit anticipatory responses to a potentially 
threatening situation. The amygdala appears to be especially important for rapid-onset, 
short-duration behaviors that occur in response to specific threats, whereas the BNST 
appears to mediate slower-onset, longer-lasting responses that frequently accompany 
sustained threats (or the surveillance for threats) and that may persist even after threat 
termination (Walker et al. 2003). Outputs from the basolateral amygdala activate medial 
portions of the central amygdala to rapidly elicit phasic fear responses via projections to the 
hypothalamus and brain stem. The basolateral amygdala also projects to the lateral portion 
of the BNST, which contributes to a slower-developing, more sustained response (Walker & 
Davis 2008). We return to this distinction of the temporal effects of the amygdala and BNST 
on HPA activity in the Concluding Remarks section.

NEUROENDOCRINE ACTIVITY AND PERCEIVED SOCIAL ISOLATION 

(LONELINESS)

The extant human research suggests that perceived social isolation (loneliness) and social 
threats are associated most consistently with activity of the HPA axis (cf. Dickerson et al. 
2011, Hawkley et al. 2012). Some data also suggest an association between perceived social 
isolation and increased circulating levels of catecholamines, although the SAM findings are 
less numerous and consistent (e.g., Edwards et al. 2010, Hawkley et al. 2006) and may be 
attributable at least in part to differences in perceived stress rather than perceived isolation 
per se (Hawkley et al. 2006).

In an early set of studies of medical students, loneliness was found to be associated with 
poorer cellular immune competence, as indexed by significantly higher Epstein-Barr virus 
antibody titers (Glaser et al. 1985) and natural killer cell activity (Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 
1984a). To investigate whether the HPA axis might be involved, Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 
(1984b) investigated the association between loneliness and urinary cortisol levels in newly 
admitted nonpsychotic psychiatric inpatients. Loneliness and stressful life events were 
measured by self-report, and a median split was performed on each self-report measure to 
divide participants into high or low groups on loneliness and high and low groups on recent

stressful life events. Analyses indicated that inpatients in the high lonely group had 
significantly higher levels of urinary cortisol than inpatients in the low lonely group, 
whereas the inpatients grouped in terms of high or low levels of recent stressful life events 
did not differ in urinary cortisol levels. Assays of natural killer cell activity and 
blastogenesis (cell proliferation to the mitogen, phytohemagglutinin) were lower in the 
lonely than nonlonely groups, and loneliness was found to be the best predictor of these 
immune measures, although the correlations were low.

Subsequent investigations suggest that loneliness is typically associated with higher levels of 
HPA activation, although the strength of the association may vary depending on the 
chronicity of loneliness, the specific tissue assayed, the parameter used to gauge HPA 
activity, the time of day of the measurements, and the reliability (e.g., number) of the 
measurements. Using an experience sampling methodology, Cacioppo et al. (2000) 
measured salivary cortisol levels in undergraduate students at nine random points during a 
normal day. Results indicated that loneliness was positively correlated with salivary cortisol 
levels, but this association reached statistical significance only for chronic loneliness. 
Interestingly, the percent of time spent alone was not associated with salivary cortisol levels. 
Using a similar methodology at four points in time across the day, Pressman et al. (2005) 
similarly found loneliness to be related to salivary cortisol levels, although this association 
reached statistical significance only for salivary cortisol levels measured an hour after 
awakening and at night. Subsequent work has confirmed that the association between 
loneliness and overall salivary cortisol levels is generally positive but small (Edwards et al. 
2010, Hawkley et al. 2006, Steptoe et al. 2004).

As mentioned above, cortisol levels are characterized by a strong basal diurnal rhythm, with 
levels high in the morning and typically increasing 50% to 60% in the first 30 to 45 minutes 
after awakening (i.e., the cortisol awakening response), dropping rapidly over the first few 
hours after waking, and then declining more slowly across the rest of the day until finally 
reaching a low point around midnight (e.g., Adam 2006). The variations in HPA activity 
across the day are often much larger than those found between groups or in response to 
quotidian stressors, making the time and conditions of measurement important 
considerations. Steptoe et al. (2004) reported that differences in loneliness across 
respondents, controlling for waking salivary cortisol value, gender, socioeconomic status, 
smoking, time of waking, and body mass, were associated with the cortisol awakening 
response, with higher levels of loneliness associated with larger cortisol increases.

Associations identified in cross-sectional studies do not address the causal role of perceived 
social isolation. To address this limitation, Adam and colleagues (2006) measured salivary 
cortisol at waking, 30 minutes after waking (the cortisol awakening response), and at 
bedtime, and loneliness was measured using an end-of-day diary each day for three days in a 
longitudinal, population-based study of older adults. Multilevel growth-curve modeling was 
used to estimate three HPA indices for each person: waking cortisol levels, slope from 
waking to bedtime, and size of the cortisol awakening response. Results averaged across the 
three days replicated those of Steptoe et al. (2004), showing that loneliness was related to 
larger cortisol awakening responses. When across-day (i.e., longitudinal) analyses were 
performed, loneliness predicted the size of the cortisol awakening response the following

day independent of other variables such as demographic factors, nervousness, or perceived 
stress, whereas the cortisol awakening response did not predict the subsequent levels of 
loneliness. These longitudinal results were replicated in a study of high school students 
(Doane & Adam 2010); in addition, Doane & Adam (2010) found that momentary and daily 
assessments of loneliness were associated with momentary salivary cortisol levels, and trait 
loneliness was associated with a flattening of the diurnal cortisol rhythm.

Glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) influence a wide range of physiological functions that 
include glucose regulation, metabolism, inflammatory control, cardiovascular activity (e.g., 
endothelial function, atherosclerosis), cellular and humoral immunity, reproductive 
processes, and neurodegeneration and apoptosis. Among these effects (e.g., carbohydrate 
metabolism) are relatively quick-acting nongenomic effects (Borski 2000), but most are 
mediated by slower-acting genomic effects, where up to 20% of the expressed genome in a 
tissue is susceptible to the direct and indirect influences of glucocorticoids, estrogens, and 
androgens (Chrousos 2009, Hawkley et al. 2012). For instance, cortisol acts on the 
glucocorticoid receptors in leukocytes, leading to a suppression of proinflammatory gene 
networks [e.g., blocking of nuclear factor (NF)-κB-mediated transcription of 
proinflammatory cytokine genes such as IL1B, IL6, IL8, and TNF ]. Although negative 
feedback mechanisms in the brain operate to constrain cortisol concentrations, animal 
models of social disruption suggest that social factors can lead to glucocorticoid resistance 
in which the glucocorticoid receptor becomes less efficient in transducing endogenous 
glucocorticoid signals (e.g., Cole et al. 2009, Hanke et al. 2012, Pace et al. 2007, Powell et 
al. 2013), thereby increasing an inflammatory biology that can contribute to the development 
of diseases ranging from type II diabetes and atherosclerosis to neurodegeneration and tumor 
metastasis. Mechanistic studies have shown that the effects of social threat on glucocorticoid 
resistance are mediated in part by sympathetically induced alterations in immune cell 
production (hematopoiesis) (Hanke et al. 2012, Powell et al. 2013).

Given the association between loneliness and HPA activity, Cole (2008) investigated the 
extent to which loneliness was associated with glucocorticoid resistance using data from a 
nationally representative sample of adults ages 54 and older from Taiwan. Cortisol, through 
its effects on the glucocorticoid receptors in leukocytes, normally stimulates an increase in 
the concentrations of neutrophils and a decrease in the concentrations of lymphocytes and 
monocytes in circulating blood. Cole (2008) used the strength of the glucocorticoid 
regulation of the circulating neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio and of the circulating 
neutrophil:monocyte ratio as a marker for receptor functional activity in leukocytes. The 
rationale is that the extent to which the glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive 
(resistant) to glucocorticoid signals should be reflected in an attenuation of the established 
positive correlation between cortisol levels and the circulating neutrophil:lymphocyte and 
neutrophil:monocyte ratios. Cole (2008) found that loneliness was associated with smaller 
neutrophil:lymphocyte and neutrophil:monocyte ratios, consistent with leukocyte 
glucocorticoid resistance.

Research has also linked loneliness to a proinflammatory gene expression profile (see 
sidebar Gene Regulation by the HPA Axis). Genome-wide microarray analyses revealed a 
reduction in the expression of genes bearing glucocorticoid receptor response elements, an

upregulation of proinflammatory gene transcripts (e.g., mRNAs encoding proinflammatory 
cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, and bioinformatic indications of activated NF-
κB transcription factor), and a downregulation of anti-inflammatory markers (e.g., 
bioinformatic indications of reduced transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor) 
in middle- and older-age adults who are high in loneliness compared with those low in 
loneliness (Cole et al. 2007, 2011). A reduction in glucocorticoid receptor signaling has a 
permissive effect on NF-κB activation (Almawi & Melemedjian 2002), so the impaired 
transcription of glucocorticoid receptor–regulated genes may also indicate an upstream 
activation of proinflammatory transcription factors that could contribute to the increased risk 
of inflammatory disease in chronically lonely individuals.3

Although a significant body of human research, including longitudinal studies, suggests that 
perceived social isolation affects the HPA axis, inflammation, and immunity, the causal role 
of social isolation is difficult to test conclusively in humans. The idea that the brain is the 
key organ of social connections and processes should be true for other species for which 
sociality has been a central feature of life for millions of years. Mechanistic animal studies 
therefore may provide a more direct test of the causal effects of a member of a social species 
being deprived of companionship and mutual assistance. There is not an animal literature on 
loneliness per se, but there is a large literature in which social animals are randomly 
assigned either to normal social living conditions or to socially isolated living conditions. 
We turn next to this literature, specifically experimental studies of the effects of social 
isolation on HPA and SAM activity in adult animals. As the review shows—and paralleling 
the research on perceived isolation in humans—the nature of the relationship that is 
disrupted by isolating an animal and the duration of isolation are important influences on the 
neuroendocrine response to social isolation.

ANIMAL STUDIES OF NEUROENDOCRINE ACTIVITY AS A FUNCTION OF 

SOCIAL ISOLATION

Correlational research in adult baboons indicates that relative social isolation (i.e., negative 
deviations from median values on a composite measure of social connectedness) is 
associated with elevated levels of basal cortisol (Sapolsky et al. 1997) (see Table 1). A major 
advantage of using animal models is the ability to experimentally manipulate social isolation 
from conspecifics, controlling for other aspects of the environment (e.g., amount of space 
available, complexity of the environment, thermoregulation), to investigate its effects on the 
SAM and HPA axes. Experimental studies in animals have manipulated social isolation 
acutely (e.g., social isolation for one hour, sometimes repeated daily) and chronically (e.g., 
social isolation for days or weeks).

3Although not the only factor in the activation of NF-κB, glucocorticoids do play a key role. NF-κB is normally sequestered in the 
cytoplasm by inhibitory protein IκB. Glucocorticoids induce the activation of IκB. NF-κB can also be activated by cytokines [e.g., 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1] and microbial and viral infections. These immune challenges activate IκB 
kinases, which in turn phosphorylate IκB. Phosphorylation of IκB releases a nuclear localization signal on NF-κB, and once NF-κB is 
in the nucleus, it actively stimulates the transcription of proinflammatory genes encoding cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, 
antimicrobial molecules, and cell death mediators.

Research on acute social isolation shows it typically produces an acute neuroendocrine 
response. Studies in monogamous prairie voles, for instance, show that a single acute (e.g., 
one hour) or repeated acute (e.g., one hour per day for four weeks) social isolation from a 
group or from a same-sex sibling increases corticosterone levels (e.g., Pournajafi-Nazarloo 
& Partoo 2011). This finding is in line with a large body of studies describing the separation 
of an animal from conspecifics as a stressor (Garrido et al. 2012; Zlatković & Filipović 
2012, 2013). Studies in Wistar rats provide information about the temporal dynamics of the 
effect of repeated acute social isolation on levels of corticosterone: Levels peak at the 5- and 
15-minute intervals, then plateau through the 30-minute interval, and finally return to 
baseline after 90 minutes of social isolation (Ferland & Schrader 2011). Similar temporal 
dynamics in the effects of acute social isolation on cortisol also have been found in cows 
(Rushen et al. 1999) and sheep (Parrot et al. 1988) (see Table 1).

In the marmoset, acute and chronic isolation have been shown to increase levels of basal 
cortisol. Adult marmosets exposed to a brief 15-minute period of social isolation (Cross et 
al. 2004) and to 11 hours of social isolation (Smith & French 1997), relative to normally 
housed animals, exhibited increased cortisol levels. Prolonged social isolation (6–20 weeks) 
in adult Geoffroy marmosets prior to cohabitation with an opposite-sex partner, compared to 
the animals that had remained with their natal group prior to cohabitation, exhibited higher 
cortisol levels that remained elevated over the course of the 90-day cohabitation period 
(Smith et al. 2011).

Studies in rats similarly suggest that chronic social isolation increases corticosterone levels 
when experimental animals are socially isolated from a group of same-sex rats (Djordjevic et 
al. 2010; Dronjak et al. 2004; Garrido et al. 2012; Zlatković & Filipović 2012, 2013), but 
inconsistencies have also been observed (cf. Pournajafi-Nazarloo & Partoo 2011). There are 
two important factors to consider in this literature, however. First, most investigations use 
small sample sizes due to concerns about cost and animal welfare. There is a growing 
appreciation for an unintended consequence of small sample sizes, however. As Button et al. 
(2013) detail, a small sample size reduces the likelihood of detecting a true effect (due to 
low statistical power), increases the likelihood that the effect size of a true effect is 
overestimated (due to the use of p < 0.05 to identify when an effect has been “detected” and 
the larger sampling error associated with smaller sample sizes), and increases the likelihood 
that a statistically significant effect is not truly different from zero (due to differences in the 
base rates for tests of true and untrue effects). The predictable outcome is a literature with 
somewhat inconsistent results. Despite this inconsistency in statistical significance, meta-
analyses of an unbiased literature nevertheless can produce a cumulative science because 
true causal effects should produce a more consistent pattern of findings (i.e., effect sizes) 
across studies than effects attributable simply to sampling error.

Second, and in line with human research indicating that the meaning of the presence or 
absence of a conspecific is an important determinant of the resulting HPA response, the 
effect of social isolation on the HPA axis in animals may not be a general effect but may 
depend on the social structure and dynamics of the species—that is, the brain’s 
interpretation of the social environment. For instance, studies in monogamous prairie voles 
show that animals that are chronically isolated from their pair-bonded partner show

increased corticosterone levels (e.g., Bosch et al. 2009, McNeal et al. 2014) and higher 
corticosterone levels after a resident-intruder test (Grippo et al. 2007a), whereas prairie voles 
that are chronically isolated from a conspecific for whom partner preference is low (e.g., 
same-sex sibling) show no such increase in corticosterone levels (Bosch et al. 2009, Grippo 
et al. 2007b, Klein et al. 1997, Pournajafi-Nazarloo & Partoo 2011, Stowe et al. 2005). 
Similar effects have been found in other monogamous species, such as Siberian dwarf 
hamsters (Castro & Matt 1997) and nonhuman primates (Mendoza & Mason 1986a,b; Smith 
& French 1997).

The importance of conspecific preference is nicely illustrated in research by Mendoza & 
Mason (1986a,b), who tested the strength and quality of the relationship (with different 
measures such as social distance between cage mates and proximity within arm’s reach) 
among members of two species: the monogamous titi monkeys, which are known to form 
strong mutual pair bonds, and the polygynous squirrel monkey. Members of both species 
had been housed in heterosexual pairs for several months but were found to respond 
differently to social isolation. Following one hour of social isolation from their pair mates, 
the normally monogamous titi monkeys (for whom partner preference is high) showed a 
significant increase in plasma cortisol, whereas the normally polygynous squirrel monkeys 
(for whom partner preference is relatively low) did not (Mendoza & Mason 1986a).

The titi monkey and the squirrel monkey do not differ simply in terms of their HPA 
reactivity. The titi monkeys show elevated HPA activity when isolated from their 
monogamous partner, but they do not show HPA activation when separated from their infant 
(Mendoza & Mason 1986b). In contrast, the HPA axis in the squirrel monkeys is 
unresponsive to isolation from polygamous partners or adult peers (Hennessy 1986, 
Mendoza et al. 1992), but the separation of squirrel monkey mothers from their infant 
produces significant increases in plasma cortisol levels in both the mother and the infant 
(Coe et al. 1978, Mendoza et al. 1978, Vogt & Levine 1980).

These results are consistent with the notion that it is not the objective presence of or absence 
of a conspecific that determines HPA activation but rather the brain’s interpretation of the 
presence or absence of the conspecific. Paralleling this specific pair-bond effect, adult 
domesticated dogs (Canis familiaris), who show “vocalization and destructiveness 
immediately after their owner’s departure, intense greeting on reunion, and a persistent 
shadowing to maintain proximity to the owner during other times” (Tuber et al. 1996, p. 
103), have reduced glucocorticoid levels in the presence of their human caretaker, even when 
placed in a novel environment, whereas the presence of a long-term familiar (either a same-
sex or an opposite-sex) kennel mate does not reduce their stress in a novel environment 
(Tuber et al. 1996).

A few studies have investigated the effects of social isolation on glucocorticoid receptors. 
For instance, chronic social isolation from same-sex peers in rats elevates nuclear 
glucocorticoid protein in prefrontal cortex (Djordjevic et al. 2010), downregulates 
glucocorticoid receptor expression in the prefrontal cortex (Djordjevic et al. 2010), and 
decreases cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus (Dronjak et al. 2004). 
Although only suggestive, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic social

isolation contributes to glucocorticoid resistance and a corresponding reduction in the 
negative feedback that constrains HPA activation.

Although most of the published research on chronic social isolation and stress hormones in 
adult animals has focused on the HPA axis, several studies have measured SAM activity. As 
in the human literature, the effects of chronic social isolation on SAM activity and plasma 
catecholamine levels are less consistent across studies than are the effects of chronic 
isolation on HPA (see Table 1). Castro & Matt (1997), for instance, studied male Siberian 
dwarf hamsters to investigate the effects of four weeks of social isolation from a female 
partner versus pair housing with the female partner on plasma cortisol, catecholamine, and 
testosterone levels. The isolated males showed elevated plasma cortisol levels but similar 
levels of epinephrine and testosterone (and lower levels of norepinephrine) compared to pair-
housed males. In a study of Wistar rats, Dronjak et al. (2004) measured HPA and SAM 
activity to investigate the effects of three housing conditions: one animal per cage (social 
isolation), 6 animals per cage (normal housing), and 12 animals per cage (social crowding). 
Chronic social isolation increased basal levels of ACTH and corticosterone, whereas no 
effect of social isolation (or social crowding) was found for basal catecholamine levels. 
Gavrilovic and colleagues (2010), in contrast, reported increased plasma levels of 
epinephrine and norepinephrine in adult male Wistar rats following 12 weeks of social 
isolation. A study of neuroendocrine responses to acute isolation in adult female dairy goats 
also documented increased norepinephrine levels but no change in epinephrine or cortisol 
levels (Carbonaro et al. 1992). Experimentally imposed social isolation thus can have 
different effects in various animal models; this may be due to species- and sex-related 
differences in the natural social conditions of the animal populations studied and resulting 
differences in the contrast condition created by experimental social isolation (which can 
sometimes result in reduced physical activity and conspecific aggression, particularly in 
males) and small sample sizes.

Finally, there is evidence in the animal literature that the chronic social isolation of an adult 
animal from preferred partners enhances neuroendocrine responsiveness to acute stressors. 
Although contrary evidence exists (cf. Djordjevic et al. 2010), chronic social isolation in 
rodents relative to control animals has been shown to increase catecholamine (Dronjak et al. 
2004; cf. Dronjak & Gavrilovic 2006) and corticosterone responses to acute stressors 
(Dronjak et al. 2004, Ferland & Schrader 2011, Grippo et al. 2007b).

ANIMAL AND HUMAN STUDIES IN RETROSPECT

The cumulative human and animal research suggests that perceived social isolation—that is, 
chronic isolation from a meaningful (e.g., pair-bonded) conspecific rather than isolation per 
se—is associated with increased HPA activity. Moreover, longitudinal studies in humans and 
experimental studies in animals indicate that perceived isolation has a causal effect on the 
HPA axis. Important differences are also apparent. The animal research, for instance, 
suggests that chronic social isolation between meaningful pairs not only elevates basal levels 
of glucocorticoids (see Table 1) but also tends to enhance the neuroendocrine response to an 
acute stressor (i.e., stress reactivity)—an effect not typically observed in the human 
literature. Most quotidian stressors in industrialized societies are neither extreme nor life

threatening. As Sapolsky (2001) noted, people in contemporary societies are not getting 
their ulcers from being chased by saber-toothed tigers, they are inventing social stressors. 
Accordingly, the acute stressors used commonly in human studies are relatively mild (e.g., 
public speaking, serial subtraction) models of the stressors encountered in modern societies. 
In contrast, the acute stressors used in animal studies are relatively severe (e.g., two hours of 
immobilization simulating the collapse of a burrow, two hours in a 4°C chamber). The 
difference in the effects of chronic social isolation on stress reactivity in the human and 
animal literatures, therefore, may be attributable to the use of relatively mild acute stressors 
in human studies. This raises two testable hypotheses: (a) that chronic social isolation from a 
meaningful social partner enhances stress reactivity in an animal model for intense but not 
for mild acute laboratory stressors, and (b) given that exposure to extreme acute stressors in 
modern societies is rare for most individuals, the effects of perceived social isolation on 
basal HPA functioning may be more deleterious for human health and longevity than are its 
effects on HPA and SAM reactivity to acute stressors.

The most appropriate animal model for investigating the mechanisms underlying perceived 
isolation and mortality may depend not only on the nature of the relationship between 
conspecifics but also on the specific mechanism under scrutiny. For example, social isolation 
of male adult rodents is generally associated with a substantial reduction in physical activity 
(and attending decreases in activity-related SNS activity) and a notable decrease in fighting 
and other overtly aggressive behavior. Once reintroduced into social settings, isolated male 
rodents often display a greater propensity for dominant/aggressive behavior (Blanchard et al. 
2001), which has parallels in the increased negativity/hostility profile observed in lonely 
individuals but possibly less so in the socially withdrawn/anxious/depressed profile observed 
in lonely humans (Cacioppo et al. 2006). In small rodent models, repeated social threat from 
an aggressive conspecific may also model important aspects of the chronic sense of social 
threat and hostility seen in lonely humans. The animal model for repeated social threat 
activates neuroendocrine responses in both the HPA and SAM axes, and it also induces 
proinflammatory/glucocorticoid-resistant immune dynamics (Hanke et al. 2012, Powell et al. 
2013) analogous to those observed in lonely humans (Cole 2008; Cole et al. 2007, 2011). 
Experimental molecular studies show that the proinflammatory gene-regulation dynamics 
observed in mouse paradigms involving repeated social threat derive in part from 
catecholamine-mediated alterations in immune cell development within the bone marrow, 
which generates a population of glucocorticoid-resistant monocytes that are primed for 
hyperinflammatory responses as they subsequently circulate throughout the body (Hanke et 
al. 2012, Powell et al. 2013). This pattern is similar to the immunologic effects observed in 
lonely humans (Cole et al. 2007, 2011), but it is not observed in rodents subject to objective 
social isolation.

To the extent that human loneliness stems from a chronic sense of social threat and a 
diminished reward from social interactions (Cacioppo & Patrick 2008, Cacioppo et al. 
2014), nonhuman primate models of repeated low-grade social threat may also help

induce both socially anxious behavior and immunoregulatory alterations that resemble those 
observed in lonely humans (Sloan et al. 2007). Experimentally imposed social instability 
also induces SNS innervation of the lymph node tissues in which immune cells coordinate 
responses to tissue injury and infection (Sloan et al. 2007, 2008) even though social 
instability does not appear to alter circulating SAM catecholamine levels. Such observations 
suggest that nonhuman primate models may provide an ethologically valid context for 
analyzing the effects of perceived social isolation and may play an important role in 
identifying the most appropriate small rodent models for mechanistic investigations.

PUTATIVE UNDERLYING NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS

The distinction between the effects of the amygdala versus the BNST on HPA activity may 
also be relevant to understanding how social isolation affects neuroendocrine activity and 
mortality in contemporary society. There is now a sizable literature in humans and animals 
for social buffering, including an attenuation of the sympathetic and HPA response to a 
stressor (Cacioppo et al. 1998, Hostinar et al. 2014). As noted above, however, social 
buffering has not been a particularly robust finding in human studies of the effects of 
perceived social isolation on autonomic and neuroendocrine activity in adults. Instead, 
perceived social isolation has typically been associated with changes in tonic functioning 
such as basal differences in sympathetic vascular tonus (as gauged by vascular resistance), 
cortisol awakening responses, elevated evening cortisol levels, circulating glucocorticoid 
levels, and decreased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity (e.g., Cacioppo et al. 2003, 
Hawkley et al. 2012).

In an early test of the buffering hypothesis, cardiovascular activity was measured in healthy 
young adults who were high or low in loneliness prior to and during a series of laboratory 
stressors. Analyses revealed two main effects—higher vascular resistance in lonely than 
nonlonely participants and higher vascular resistance during the stressors than during the 
baseline—whereas the interaction did not approach significance (Cacioppo et al. 2002b). 
That is, there was no difference between these groups in stress reactivity. The basal 
differences in vascular resistance between lonely and nonlonely participants were also 
apparent when participants performed postural adjustments (sitting, standing; Cacioppo et 
al. 2002b) and during rest whether in the laboratory or during the course of a normal day 
(Hawkley et al. 2003). In a similar study, Steptoe et al. (2004) reported the interaction to be 
significant, but it held only for women and only for diastolic blood pressure, not systolic 
blood pressure or heart rate.

Rather than the social buffering of stressors, several studies suggest that perceived social 
isolation may diminish the generally salubrious effects of interacting with others. In an 
experience sampling study, undergraduate students were just as likely to interact with other 
people whether or not they felt socially isolated. For those who felt isolated, the interactions 
were rated as being of poorer quality and as providing less support and comfort (Hawkley et 
al. 2003). Importantly, the presence of others did not differentially affect the ratings of the 
severity of stressors for individuals who did and did not feel socially isolated; instead, social 
interactions, which themselves are a potential uplift and a source of pleasure for most 
individuals, were experienced less positively by individuals who felt socially isolated. These

behavioral findings suggest that perceived social isolation may both increase surveillance for 
social threats and decrease the rewards that one derives from interpersonal relationships. 
Consistent with this idea, a functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that 
perceived isolation was associated with (a) stronger activity in the visual cortex in response 
to unpleasant social relative to unpleasant nonsocial visual stimuli and (b) weaker activity in 
the ventral striatal area in response to pleasant social compared to pleasant nonsocial visual 
stimuli (Cacioppo et al. 2009).

Both the amygdala and the BNST are involved in HPA adjustments in conditions that permit 
anticipatory or preparatory responses to a potentially threatening situation. The amygdala is 
especially important for rapid-onset, short-duration behaviors that occur in response to 
specific threats, whereas the BNST appears to mediate slower-onset, longer-lasting 
responses that frequently accompany sustained threats and that may persist even after threat 
termination (Walker & Davis 2008). These differences raise the possibility that the BNST 
plays a key role in the effects of perceived social isolation from a significant conspecific on 
basal HPA functioning. CRH is produced not only by neurons in the medial parvocellular 
region of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus but also by cells in the lateral 
central amygdala that release CRH into the lateral BNST (Walker & Davis 2008). The 
BNST, through projections to the brain stem and paraventricular nucleus of the 
hypothalamus, produces neuroendocrine and autonomic responses that appear as changes in 
relatively tonic activity.

The receptors for CRH, namely CRHR1 and CRHR2, are differentially distributed in the 
brain (the former are widely distributed, whereas the latter are found in only a few nuclei 
including the central amygdala and BNST). The anxiogenic effects of CRH are mediated by 
CRHR1, whereas anxiogenic and anxiolytic effects are mediated by CRHR2. The HPA axis 
is also under the influence of oxytocin and vasopressin, and these hormones exert opposite 
effects on the HPA axis, with oxytocin decreasing and vasopressin increasing HPA axis 
activity (De Boer et al. 2012). Given the prevalence of oxytocin receptors in the BNST, 
central amygdala, and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, Dabrowska et al. (2011) 
investigated the distribution of CRHR2 in the BNST, paraventricular nucleus, and supraoptic 
nucleus of the hypothalamus in relation to oxytocin, oxytocin receptors, CRH, and arginine-
vasopressin. Their results indicated a reciprocal neuroanatomical relationship between CRH-
containing neurons in the BNST and oxytocin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus. 
Moreover, the colocalization of CRHR2 and oxytocin in hypothalamic neurons and in axon 
terminals throughout the BNST suggests that the BNST is involved in a potential feedback 
loop between the hypothalamic oxytocin system and the forebrain CRH system (Dabrowska 
et al. 2011). How precisely this feedback loop operates is not fully known, but given the role 
of oxytocin in pair bonding and in suppressing HPA activity, one might posit that the 
presence of companionship and mutual assistance lowers HPA activation in part through its 
effects on the BNST and the hypothalamic oxytocin system or, conversely, that the removal 
from or absence of companionship and mutual assistance raises HPA activation in part 
through its effects on the BNST and the hypothalamic oxytocin system.

Other mechanisms, such as the development of glucocorticoid resistance, also warrant 
further empirical investigation. In these studies, it will be important to distinguish between

the SAM neuroendocrine component of sympathetic activation (which does not seem to be 
consistently associated with loneliness or glucocorticoid resistance and other 
proinflammatory dynamics) and the effects of direct SNS nerve fiber delivery of 
norepinephrine into immune system organs such as spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus, and 
into diseased tissues such as tumors (Lutgendorf et al. 2009, 2011; Sloan et al. 2007, 2008). 
Studies examining systemic SAM catecholamine levels in parallel with localized SNS-
derived catecholamines have found a surprising degree of discontinuity between the two 
(Lutgendorf et al. 2009, 2011), and social processes appear to be much more strongly related 
to the latter (as are immunobiological alterations in animal models; Sloan et al. 2007).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Social isolation has been recognized as a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in 
humans for more than a quarter of a century. The brain is the key organ of social connections 
and processes, however, and the same objective social relationship can be experienced as 
caring and protective or as exploitive and isolating. The extant evidence indicates that the 
perception of social isolation (i.e., loneliness) is also a risk factor for broad-based morbidity 
(both physical and psychological) and mortality. However, the causal role of loneliness on 
neural and neuroendocrine mechanisms is difficult to test conclusively in humans. 
Mechanistic animal studies provide a means to evaluate the effects of social isolation on the 
HPA axis, autonomic functioning, and SAM axis. Adult animal studies of the effects of 
social isolation on HPA and SAM activity are reminiscent of two findings in the human 
literature: (a) chronic social isolation is associated with relatively consistent increases in 
HPA axis activity but little alteration in SAM catecholamine activity, and (b) the effects of 
chronic social isolation appear to be more dependent on the disruption of a social bond 
between a significant social pair (e.g., as indexed by behavioral measures of partner 
preference in animals or rated quality of relationships in humans) than isolation from others 
per se. The experimental research in adult animals further demonstrates that social isolation 
can have a causal effect on neuroendocrine functioning.

The incredible complexity of social life within and across species, the plethora of brain 
mechanisms needed to make sense of and respond to an ever-changing social world, and the 
still nascent level of understanding of the social brain underscore the importance of 
integrating human and animal research to determine which specific animals and paradigms 
are best for modeling a specific process or mechanism and delineating the pathways through 
which social relationships, or their absence, impact health and longevity. Experimental 
animal models of repeated social threat (but not chronic social isolation) have been found to 
generate immunobiological dynamics that resemble those observed in lonely human beings 
and thus may provide an experimental framework in which to analyze the increased risk of 
inflammation-related diseases observed in the human social epidemiology of loneliness. In 
these studies, functional alterations in the HPA axis (glucocorticoid resistance) and the SNS 
(innervation of immune system organs regulating leukocyte development) interact to 
promote a proinflammatory “defensive regime” in gene expression that ultimately increases 
the risk of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic 
diseases while simultaneously undermining resistance to viral infections. The 
correspondence of the behavioral, neurobiological, and genomic effects of repeated social

threat in animals and those of human loneliness suggests that it may be important for future 
studies to define more precisely the specific brain dynamics and the specific cognitive 
processes that are most engaged by perceived social isolation. To date it is clear that a full 
understanding of the core psychological and biological features of human loneliness requires 
a consideration of the brain’s interpretation of the social environment.

Figure 1. 
Schematics of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, the sympathetic 
adrenomedullary (SAM) axis, and the innervation of the lymph node tissue by the 
sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The HPA axis controls circulating glucocorticoid (GC) 
levels through a cascade that starts with signals from the prefrontal cortex [e.g., medial 
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)] and limbic regions [e.g., amygdala, 
bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNST)] to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, 
which secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) into the hypophyseal portal 
circulatory system. This activity stimulates the anterior pituitary to release 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH travels through the blood to the adrenal 
cortex, where it acts on melanocortin type 2 receptors to stimulate the secretion of GC 
hormones (cortisol in humans and most mammals; corticosterone in rodents) into 
circulation. GC regulation is accomplished systemically via a negative feedback loop 
involving higher structures of the HPA axis (notably the hippocampus), whereby increases in 
circulating cortisol concentrations inhibit CRH secretion from the hypothalamus and 
diminish the production of ACTH in the pituitary gland by binding to glucocorticoid and 
mineralocorticoid receptors (GR and MR, respectively); both processes lead to a decrease in 
cortisol secretion from the adrenal gland. The SAM axis controls circulating epinephrine 
(EPi) levels. The SNS, through preganglionic neurons (the splanchnic nerve), projects from 
the central nervous system directly to cells in the adrenal medulla, which secretes primarily 
EPi (in addition to smaller amounts of norepinephrine and dopamine) into the circulatory 
system, where it serves to heighten metabolism and increase available energy. In addition, 
there is direct SNS nerve fiber delivery of norepinephrine into immune system organs such 
as the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus; immune cells coordinate responses to tissue injury 
and infection. Artwork courtesy of Tianyi Li, adapted for publication by Annual Reviews.
