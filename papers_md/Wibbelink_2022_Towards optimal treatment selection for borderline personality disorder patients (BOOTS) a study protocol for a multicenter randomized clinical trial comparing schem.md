Abstract 
Background:  Specialized evidence-based treatments have been developed and evaluated for borderline personal-
ity disorder (BPD), including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Schema Therapy (ST). Individual differences in 
treatment response to both ST and DBT have been observed across studies, but the factors driving these differences 
are largely unknown. Understanding which treatment works best for whom and why remain central issues in psy-
chotherapy research. The aim of the present study is to improve treatment response of DBT and ST for BPD patients 
by a) identifying patient characteristics that predict (differential) treatment response (i.e., treatment selection) and b) 
understanding how both treatments lead to change (i.e., mechanisms of change). Moreover, the clinical effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness of DBT and ST will be evaluated.

Methods:  The BOOTS trial is a multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted in a routine clinical setting in several 
outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. We aim to recruit 200 participants, to be randomized to DBT or ST. Patients 
receive a combined program of individual and group sessions for a maximum duration of 25 months. Data are col-
lected at baseline until three-year follow-up. Candidate predictors of (differential) treatment response have been 
selected based on the literature, a patient representative of the Borderline Foundation of the Netherlands, and 
semi-structured interviews among 18 expert clinicians. In addition, BPD-treatment-specific (ST: beliefs and schema 
modes; DBT: emotion regulation and skills use), BPD-treatment-generic (therapeutic environment characterized by 
genuineness, safety, and equality), and non-specific (attachment and therapeutic alliance) mechanisms of change 
are assessed. The primary outcome measure is change in BPD manifestations. Secondary outcome measures include 
functioning, additional self-reported symptoms, and well-being.

Discussion:  The current study contributes to the optimization of treatments for BPD patients by extending our 
knowledge on “Which treatment – DBT or ST – works the best for which BPD patient, and why?”, which is likely to yield

Background
Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  is  a  complex  and 
severe mental disorder, characterized by a pervasive pat-
tern of instability in emotion regulation, self-image, inter-
personal  relationships,  and  impulse  control  [1,  2].  The 
prevalence  in  the  general  population  is  estimated  to  be 
between 1 and 3% [3–5], and 10 to 25% among psychiat-
ric outpatient and inpatient individuals [3]. BPD is asso-
ciated  with  severe  functional  impairment,  high  rates  of 
comorbid mental disorders, and physical health problems 
[5–7]. In addition, BPD is characterized by low quality of 
life; lower compared to other common mental disorders 
such  as  depressive  disorder,  and  comparable  to  that  of 
patients with severe physical conditions, such as Parkin-
son’s disease and stroke [8]. Moreover, BPD is related to 
a  high  risk  of  suicide  (3–6%,  or  even  up  to  10%  [9,  10]) 
and suicide attempts or threats (up to 84% [11, 12]), and 
an increased mortality rate [13]. Besides the detrimental 
effects of BPD on the individual patient, BPD also poses 
a  high  financial  burden  to  society.  BPD  patients  make 
extensive use of treatment services resulting in markedly 
higher healthcare costs of people with BPD compared to 
people  with  other  mental  disorders,  such  as  other  per-
sonality disorders [14] and depressive disorder [15]. BPD 
is also associated with high non-healthcare costs, includ-
ing costs related to productivity losses, informal care, and 
out-of-pocket costs [16, 17].

Interventions: dialectical behavior therapy and schema 
therapy

BPD has traditionally been viewed as one of the most dif-
ficult mental disorders to treat [18]. During recent years, 
a number of promising treatments have been developed 
and  evaluated,  including  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy 
(DBT)  [19,  20]  and  Schema Therapy  (ST)  [21,  22].  DBT 
is  a  comprehensive  cognitive  behavioral  treatment  for 
BPD, rooted in behaviorism, Zen and dialectical philoso-
phy [19]. ST is based on an integrative cognitive therapy, 
combining  cognitive  behavior  and  experiential  therapy 
techniques  with  concepts  derived  from  developmen-
tal  theories,  including  attachment  theory,  and  psycho-
dynamic  concepts  [23].  For  detailed  information  about 
these treatments, the reader is referred to the Methods/
design section.

Several  studies  have  demonstrated  the  effectiveness 
and  the  efficacy  of  DBT  and  ST  for  BPD,  although  the 
evidence  is  mostly  based  on  low-to-moderate-quality 
evidence,  and  trials  focusing  on  DBT,  but  especially  ST, 
are  limited  [24,  25].  In  addition,  substantial  reductions 
in  direct  and  indirect  healthcare  costs  have  been  found 
for both treatments [26]. However, research on the com-
parative  effectiveness  and  cost-effectiveness  of  the  two 
interventions  is  lacking.  Moreover,  research  on  media-
tors and moderators of treatment effects is limited. This 
gap warrants attention, as treatment effectiveness can be 
optimized  by  identifying  mechanisms  within  treatments 
that  are  associated  with  improvement  and  patient  char-
acteristics  that  predict  (differential)  treatment  response 
[27]. Optimizing treatment effectiveness of DBT and ST 
for  BPD  is  highly  needed  since  a  substantial  proportion 
of  patients  does  not  respond  fully  to  either  DBT  or  ST. 
A  systematic  review  found  a  mean  percentage  of  non-
response  of  46%  among  BPD  patients  treated  with  spe-
cialized  psychotherapies,  including  DBT  and  ST  [28]. 
In  addition,  more  than  one-third  of  the  patients  did 
not achieve a reliable change in BPD symptoms or even 
showed an increase in BPD severity after DBT or ST [29–
31]). Finally, dropout rates up to 30% have been found for 
DBT and ST [32, 33]. Individual differences in responses 
to  both  ST  and  DBT  have  been  observed  across  stud-
ies, but the factors driving these differences in treatment 
response among BPD patients are largely unknown. This 
state of affairs leaves the principal question “What treat-
ment, by whom, is most effective for this individual with 
that specific problem, under which set of circumstances?” 
([34],  p111),  historically  one  of  the  key  questions  domi-
nating the psychotherapy research agenda, fully open in 
the treatment of BPD individuals [35, 36]. Identifying fac-
tors  that  specify  which  patients  will  benefit  most  from 
which treatment (i.e., treatment selection, or also known 
as precision medicine or personalized medicine; [37, 38]) 
will lead to fewer mismatches between patients and treat-
ments, and in turn to better outcome and more efficient 
use of healthcare resources.

Treatment selection

Several  factors  predicting  treatment  response  irre-
spective  of  type  of  treatment  (i.e.,  prognostic  factors; 
[35])  among  BPD  patients  have  been  reported  in  the 

Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89 

Page 3 of 28

literature.  The  overwhelming  list  of  candidate  vari-
ables  and  the  general  lack  of  replication  hampers  the 
research  among  BPD  patients  on  prognostic  factors 
[39].  Research  among  BPD  patients  on  prescriptive 
factors  (i.e.,  factors  that  predict  different  outcomes 
depending  on  the  treatment;  moderators)  is  very 
scarce  indeed.  Arntz  et  al.  [39]  examined  the  effect  of 
several  potential  predictors  of  (differential)  treatment 
response  across  ST  and  Transference  Focused  Psycho-
therapy (TFP) among BPD patients. The authors failed 
to find prescriptive factors, but it should be noted that 
the  sample  size  was  inadequate  to  detect  subtle  differ-
ences  between  treatments.  In  addition,  Verheul  et  al. 
[40]  found  that  patients  with  a  high  frequency  of  self-
mutilating  behavior  before  treatment  were  more  likely 
to  benefit  from  DBT  compared  to  treatment  as  usual, 
whereas for patients with a low frequency of self-muti-
lating behavior effectiveness did not differ.

Historically, research has focused on a single variable 
to  predict  treatment  response,  but  often  failed  to  find 
consistent  and  clinically  meaningful  moderators  [41–
44]. However, it is highly unlikely that a single variable 
is responsible for the differences in treatment response 
[43,  45,  46]. In recent decades, novel approaches com-
bining  multiple  predictors  to  determine  the  optimal 
treatment for a particular patient have been introduced, 
including the methods of Kraemer ([47]; optimal com-
posite  moderator)  and  DeRubeis  and  colleagues  ([35]; 
statistically  derived  selection  algorithm).  Several  stud-
ies  have  found  that  a  combination  of  predictors  was 
predictive of differential treatment response (e.g., [48–
50]).  For  example,  by  using  the  method  of  DeRubeis 
and  colleagues,  it  was  investigated  in  an  effectiveness 
study among BPD patients which of two different treat-
ments  (DBT  and  General  Psychiatric  Management; 
GPM)  would  have  been  the  optimal  treatment  option 
for  a  particular  patient  in  terms  of  long  term  outcome 
[45].  The  authors  found  that  BPD  patients  with  child-
hood  emotional  abuse,  social  adjustment  problems, 
and  dependent  personality  traits  were  more  likely  to 
benefit  from  DBT  compared  to  GPM,  whereas  GPM 
excelled for patients with more severe problems related 
to impulsivity. The authors also provided an estimate of 
the advantage that might be gained if patients had been 
allocated to the optimal treatment option. The average 
difference  in  outcomes  between  the  predicted  optimal 
treatment  and  non-optimal  treatment  for  all  patients 
was  small-to-medium  (d = 0.36),  while  the  advan-
tage  for  patients  with  a  relatively  stronger  prediction 
increased  to  a  medium-to-large  effect  (d = 0.61).  This 
suggests that treatment allocation based on a treatment 
selection  procedure  may  substantially  improve  out-
comes for BPD patients.

Mechanisms of change

Another principal way to improve treatment response is 
to capitalize on mechanisms underlying change in treat-
ments  [27,  45,  51,  52].  Studying  mechanisms  of  change 
helps  to  identify  core  ingredients  of  interventions  and 
points the way to enhancing crucial elements, while dis-
carding  redundant  elements.  Presumably,  this  would 
maximize (cost-)effectiveness and efficiency as well. Since 
the  1950s,  research  on  change  processes  has  increased 
exponentially [53]. However, the majority of the trials on 
BPD have focused on outcomes, and only a few addressed 
how  treatments  exerted  a  positive  effect  on  patient  out-
comes  [54,  55].  Rudge  et  al.  [56]  reviewed  studies  on 
mechanisms  of  change  in  DBT.  They  concluded  that 
there  is  empirical  support  for  behavioral  control,  emo-
tion  regulation,  and  skills  use  as  mechanisms  underly-
ing  change  in  DBT.  Recently,  Yakın  et  al.  [57]  examined 
schema modes as mechanisms of change in ST for cluster 
C,  histrionic,  paranoid,  and  narcissistic  personality  dis-
orders.  They  found  that  a  strengthening  of  a  functional 
schema  mode  (i.e.,  healthy  adult  mode)  and  weakening 
of four maladaptive schema modes (i.e., vulnerable child 
mode,  impulsive  child  mode,  avoidant  protector  mode, 
and  self-aggrandizer  mode)  predicted  improvements  in 
PD symptomatology. However, changes in these schema 
modes,  except  for  self-aggrandizer  mode,  also  predicted 
improvements  in  outcome  in  treatment-as-usual  and 
clarification-oriented  psychotherapy,  suggesting 
that 
modifying  the  strength  of  schema  modes  might  reflect 
common  mechanisms  of  change. The  question  of  speci-
ficity  of  mechanisms  of  change  is  interesting,  especially 
since  both  DBT  and  ST  have  their  roots  in  cognitive 
behavior therapy and show similarity in certain treatment 
parameters, but differ substantially in techniques, explan-
atory  model,  and  terminology  [58].  Clarifying  the  treat-
ment-specific  and  non-specific  mechanisms  of  change 
may  be  key  to  furthering  the  effectiveness  of  both  DBT 
and ST, and potentially also for psychotherapy in general.

Current study

BPD-tailored  treatments,  like  DBT  and  ST,  are  con-
sidered  treatments  of  choice  for  BPD  [25].  However, 
knowledge  on  the  comparative  (cost-)effectiveness  of 
DBT and ST is lacking, as is knowledge on mechanisms 
of  change  and  patient  characteristics  that  predict  (dif-
ferential)  treatment  response.  We  will  therefore  per-
form  a  multicenter  randomized  clinical  trial  (RCT) 
comparing  DBT  and  ST  for  BPD  patients  to  elucidate 
the  question  “Which  treatment  –  DBT  or  ST  –  works 
the  best  for  which  BPD  patient,  and  why?”.  The  main 
aim  of  the  BOOTS  (Borderline  Optimal  Treatment 
Selection)  study  is  to  improve  treatment  response  of 

 Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89

DBT and ST for BPD patients by optimizing treatment 
selection  through  the  identification  of  a  prediction 
model based on patient characteristics that predict (dif-
ferential) treatment response. By doing so, this study is 
a  first  step  into  the  development  of  a  treatment  selec-
tion procedure for BPD patients. Moreover, the results 
of  this  study  can  serve  as  a  starting  point  for  future 
studies with the ultimate goal of implementing a treat-
ment  selection  procedure  that  can  be  used  in  clinical 
practice to guide BPD patients and clinicians in select-
ing  the  optimal  treatment.  In  addition,  we  aim  to  elu-
cidate  the  mechanisms  by  which  DBT  and  ST  lead  to 
change,  thus  pursuing  the  other  main  avenue  towards 
improving BPD treatments.

This study has four primary objectives. The first objec-
tive  of  this  study  is  to  develop  a  treatment  selection 
model  based  on  a  combination  of  patient  characteris-
tics  that  predict  (differential)  treatment  response  across 
DBT and ST. Candidate predictors of (differential) treat-
ment response have been selected based on the literature, 
suggestions of  a patient representative  of  the  Borderline 
Foundation of the Netherlands, and clinicians’ appraisals 
of  BPD  patient  characteristics  that  predict  (differential) 
treatment response across DBT and ST. Semi-structured 
interviews were conducted among 18 expert clinicians to 
identify patient characteristics they deemed predictive of 
(differential)  treatment  response.  The  extensive  invest-
ment in the identification of pertinent predictors is a les-
son  learned  from  Meehl  [34],  who  noted  that  actuarial 
methods will not outperform clinical judgment when the 
actuarial  method  is  based  on  inadequate  knowledge  of 
relevant variables. According to Westen and Weinberger 
[59],  clinical  expertise  can  serve  the  important  function 
of  identifying  relevant  variables  for  use  in  research.  In 
addition, the majority of studies examining predictors of 
treatment response are based on randomized controlled 
trials  with  a  primary  focus  on  treatment  effectiveness 
[60],  which  could  result  in  the  preclusion  of  potentially 
relevant predictors due to the lack of instruments assess-
ing  these  constructs  [39,  61].  Moreover,  findings  in  the 
literature  may  be  affected  by  publication  bias,  since  sta-
tistically significant predictors of treatment response are 
more  likely  to  be  published  [46].  Therefore,  candidate 
predictors  of  (differential)  treatment  response  are  not 
only based on the literature, but also on clinical expertise 
and experience-based knowledge. We hypothesize that a 
combination  of  multiple  patient  characteristics  will  pre-
dict  and  moderate  treatment  effectiveness  of  DBT  and 
ST.  Hypotheses  on  the  effects  of  single  patient  charac-
teristics  will  not  be  formulated  as  research  among  BPD 
patients  often  failed  to  find  consistent  prognostic  fac-
tors, while research on prescriptive factors or a combina-
tion  between  factors  is  scarce.  In  addition,  there  was  in 

general a lack of consensus between the 18 expert clini-
cians  on  patient  characteristics  predicting  (differential) 
treatment response across DBT and ST.

Second,  we  aim  to  elucidate  how  DBT  and  ST  exert 
their  effect  by  gaining  a  better  understanding  of  the 
mechanisms  of  change  of  DBT  and  ST.  A  first  step 
towards  more  insight  into  mechanisms  of  change  is  the 
identification of mediators. Mediators are easily confused 
with  mechanisms  of  change,  despite  important  differ-
ences [62]. A mediator is an intervening variable (partly) 
accounting  for  the  statistical  relationship  between  the 
intervention and outcome, and might serve as a statisti-
cal proxy for a mechanism of change [63]. In this study, 
we will examine potential BPD-treatment-specific, BPD-
treatment-generic,  and  non-specific  mediators.  Based 
on  empirical  research  and  the  presumed  mechanisms 
of  change  (e.g.,  [55–57]),  we  hypothesize  that  change  in 
skills  use  and  emotion  regulation  are  the  mechanisms 
underlying  change  in  DBT,  and  that  change  in  schema 
modes  and  beliefs  are  the  mechanisms  of  change  in  ST 
(i.e.,  BPD-treatment-specific  mechanisms  of  change).  In 
addition,  a  therapeutic  environment  characterized  by 
genuineness of the therapists and group members, safety, 
and equality is considered to be especially important for 
BPD treatment [64–67] and is, therefore, assumed to be 
a  BPD-treatment-generic  mechanism  of  change.  Finally, 
attachment  and  therapeutic  alliance  are  the  presumed 
non-specific mechanisms of change [68, 69].

Third,  the  comparative  effectiveness  of  DBT  and  ST 
will  be  examined.  Accumulating  evidence  suggests  that 
symptoms and psychosocial functioning are only loosely 
associated  [70,  71].  Patients  with  BPD  are  characterized 
by  significant  impairments  in  vocational  functioning, 
relationships, and leisure [72]. In addition, social adjust-
ment  of  BPD  patients  is  considerably  lower  than  social 
adjustment seen in other mental disorders, such as major 
depressive disorder and bipolar I disorder [73]. Moreover, 
although  several  studies  found  that  even  as  psychopa-
thology  after  treatment  of  BPD  decreased,  impairments 
in quality of life and functioning often (partly) persist [74, 
75].  A  more  comprehensive  view  of  recovery  is  there-
fore  needed.  This  notion  is  underscored  by  qualitative 
research  that  has  shown  that  patients  define  recovery 
by personal well-being, social inclusion, and satisfaction 
with  life  [76,  77].  Therefore,  the  current  trial  will  track 
outcomes  in  multiple  domains  including  symptoms, 
functioning, and well-being.

Finally,  the  cost-effectiveness  of  DBT  and  ST  will  be 
compared. Individual ST seems a cost-effective treatment 
[78,  79].  However,  although  group  ST  combined  with 
individual ST is widely used in clinical practice, the cost-
effectiveness of this combined program is yet unknown. 
An international RCT evaluating the (cost-)effectiveness 

Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89 

Page 5 of 28

of group ST for BPD is currently in progress [80]. More 
economic  evaluations  of  DBT  are  available  and  support 
the cost-effectiveness of DBT. However, the studies vary 
highly  in  their  design  and  the  number  of  trials  is  still 
somewhat  limited  [26,  81,  82].  Therefore,  an  economic 
evaluation  will  be  performed  and  a  societal  perspective 
will  be  applied,  including  indirect  and  direct  healthcare 
costs.

In addition to these primary objectives, several second-
ary  investigations  will  be  performed,  including  (but  not 
limited to): 1) the heterogeneity of BPD, 2) substance use 
(disorders)  among  patients  with  BPD,  3)  perspectives  of 
patients  and  therapists  in  key  areas,  including  predic-
tors,  mechanisms  of  change,  the  treatments,  and  the 
implementation  of  the  results  in  clinical  practice,  and 
4)  psychometric  evaluations  of  several  Dutch  question-
naires (e.g., Dialectical Behavior Therapy-Ways of Coping 
Checklist, Ultrashort BPD Checklist).

Methods/design
Design

The  study  is  a  multicenter  RCT  with  two  active  condi-
tions  (DBT  or  ST).  The  study  is  set  at  various  Dutch 
mental  healthcare  centers  accessible  through  the  pub-
lic  health  system,  including  Antes  (Rotterdam),  GGZ 
inGeest  (Amsterdam),  GGZ  NHN  (Heerhugowaard), 
GGZ Rivierduinen (Leiden), NPI (Amsterdam), Pro Per-
sona  (Ede  and  Tiel),  PsyQ  (Rotterdam-Kralingen),  and 
PsyQ/i-psy  (Amsterdam).  For  an  overview  of  the  study 
design,  including  the  enrollment,  randomization,  inter-
ventions, and assessments, see Fig. 1.

The Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medi-
cal Center (MEC-AMC) Amsterdam approved the study 
protocol  (registration  number  NL66731.018.18).  The 
study is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register, part 
of  the  Dutch  Cochrane  Center  (registration  number 
NL7699), and complies with the World Health Organiza-
tion Trial Registration Data Set. Modifications to the pro-
tocol require a formal amendment to the protocol which 
will be examined by the MEC-AMC. The trial adheres to 
the  SPIRIT  methodology  and  guidelines  [83],  see  Addi-
tional file 1.

Patients

Patients are eligible if they 1) are between 18 and 65 years 
old, 2) have a primary diagnosis of BPD (diagnosed with 
the  Structural  Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-5  Personality 
Disorders; SCID-5-PD), 3) have a BPD severity score > 20 
on  the  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  Severity  Index, 
version  5  (BPDSI-5),  4)  have  an  adequate  proficiency  in 
the  Dutch  language,  and  5)  are  motivated  to  participate 
in  (group)  treatment  for  a  maximum  of  25 months  and 
are  willing  and  able  to  complete  the  assessments  over  a 

period of three years. Patients will be excluded if they 1) 
fulfill the criteria of a psychotic disorder in the past year 
(diagnosed  with  the  Structural  Clinical  Interview  for 
DSM-5 Syndrome Disorders; SCID-5-S), 2) have current 
substance  dependence  needing  clinical  detoxification, 
3)  have  been  diagnosed  with  a  bipolar  I  disorder  with 
at least one manic episode in the past year, 4) have been 
diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder (diagnosed 
with  the  SCID-5-PD),  in  combination  with  a  history  of 
physical violence against multiple individuals in the past 
two years, 5) have an IQ below 80, 6) have a travel time to 
the mental healthcare center longer than 45 min (except 
when the patient lives in the same city), 7) have no fixed 
address, and 8) have received ST or DBT in the past year.

Sample size

We aim to include 200 participants. Each center intends 
to  recruit  at  least  18  patients.  For  the  power  analysis, 
we  adopted  the  minimal  statistically  detectable  effect 
approach  [84].  A  sample  size  of  200  will  be  sufficient 
to  have  80%  power  to  detect  moderators  of  treatment 
effects  that  have  an  effect  size  of  Cohen’s  f  of  .20  (small 
to medium effect size), based on a two-tailed significance 
level  of  p < .05.  In  addition,  the  study  has  80%  power  to 
detect medium effect-sized (i.e., Cohen’s f = .25) modera-
tors  of  treatment  effects,  based  on  a  two-tailed  signifi-
cance level of p < .01.

Regarding  the  effectiveness  study,  with  a  sample  size 
of N = 200 the study is powered at 82% to detect a group 
difference  with  a  medium  effect  size  of  Cohen’s  d = .50 
at  a  two-tailed  significance  level  of  p < .05  and  assuming 
a  model  with  center  as  random  effect  and  an  intraclass 
correlation  value  of  0.05  corresponding  to  the  center  by 
treatment interaction [85, 86].

Finally,  a  sample  size  of  N = 200  will  be  sufficient  to 
have  98%  power  to  detect  a  medium  effect  size  of  the 
mediation  effect  (rr = .09;  [87–89]),  assuming  path  a 
(relation  between  the  predictor  and  mediator)  and  path 
b (relation between the mediator and outcome measure) 
both have a medium effect size (r = .30), and based on a 
simplified trivariate mediation model [90].

Recruitment

Patients  are  recruited  in  the  respective  participating 
mental healthcare centers. Patients diagnosed with BPD 
or for whom this is deemed likely are invited to partici-
pate in the screening process. After reading and hearing 
information  about  the  study  and  signing  an  informed 
consent (see Additional file 2, Appendix A), patients will 
start  with  the  screening  process.  Not  only  new  refer-
rals  can  be  included,  but  also  patients  who  are  already 
receiving treatment for mental disorders (except patients 
receiving ST or DBT).

Randomization

A  central  independent  research  assistant  randomizes 
the  patients  per  center  after  a  final  check  of  the  inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria, and after all baseline meas-
ures  have  been  completed.  Generally,  patients  will  be 
randomized  using  computerized  covariate  adaptive 
randomization  [91–93],  taking  into  account  gender 
and  severity  of  BPD  (BPDSI-5  score ≤ 24;  BPDSI-5 
score > 24).  By  using  this  method,  the  imbalance  of 
baseline  characteristics  between  the  treatments  will 
be  minimized.  Patients  are  allocated  to  the  treatment 
group  that  results  in  the  least  imbalance  between  the 
treatments with an allocation probability of 0.8 to pre-
serve  unpredictability  [94].  Groups  in  both  treatments 

are  semi-open  which  implies  that  new  patients  can 
enter  the  group  if  treatment  slots  are  available.  There-
fore,  treatment  capacity  will  be  taken  into  account  by 
using unequal ratios if needed (e.g., 2:1 or 1:3).

In  exceptional  cases,  an  alternative  randomization 
method will be used if one or more treatment slots are 
available  in  only  one  condition  and  there  is  no  avail-
able  treatment  slot  in  the  other  condition.  To  prevent 
long  waiting  times  for  treatment  and  empty  places  in 
the  groups,  the  available  treatment  slot(s)  in  one  con-
dition  will  be  randomized  over  2*k  patients  whereby k 
stands for the number of available treatment slots, and 
randomization  is  done  in  the  subsample  of  k  patients 
that wait the longest. Randomization over 2*k patients 

Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89

guarantees unpredictable outcomes. For example, if one 
treatment slot is available in DBT and there is no avail-
able  treatment  slot  in  ST  at  that  moment,  nor  within 
the  foreseeable  future,  the  available  treatment  slot  in 
DBT  will  be  randomized  over  two  patients  waiting  for 
treatment.  Sensitivity  analyses  will  be  performed  by 
excluding patients that have been randomized using the 
alternative randomization method.

Procedure and assessments

Patients  with  BPD  or  suspected  of  BPD  are  invited  to 
the screening process by the research assistant or intake 
staff member. After providing written informed consent, 
patients  are  assessed  for  eligibility  to  participate  in  the 
study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. First, 
to  assess  DSM-5  syndrome  disorders,  the  SCID-5-S  is 
administered. The SCID-5-PD will also be administered 
in case the SCID-5-PD is not part of the standard intake 
procedure  of  the  mental  healthcare  center.  Second,  the 
BPDSI-5  and  a  screening  interview  to  assess  the  moti-
vation  and  availability  of  the  patient  are  conducted.  A 
simple “yes” answer to the questions posed by the inter-
viewer  (e.g.,  “Are  you  motivated  and  available  for  treat-
ment,  including  individual  and  group  sessions?”)  is  not 
sufficient.  Patients  need  to  elaborate  on  their  answers 
and  follow-up  questions  are  asked  if  needed.  Patients 
who  are  eligible  for  participation  will  be  invited  for  the 
baseline  assessment,  including  interviews  and  com-
intake 
puter-based  self-report  questionnaires,  and 
staff  members  will  fill  out  a  questionnaire  (i.e.,  intake 
questionnaire;  see  the  Measures  section)  about  these 
patients.  After  completing  the  baseline  assessment, 
patients  will  be  randomized  as  soon  as  treatment  slots 
become  available.  Patients  will  be  informed  that  they 
have been allocated to one of the treatment conditions, 
but the name of the treatment will not be communicated 
to the patient until the first treatment session. If patients 
cannot be randomized within several months after com-
pleting the baseline assessment because of unavailability 
of treatment slots, the BPDSI-5 will be re-assessed after 
three months and the BPDSI-5 and cost interview will be 
re-assessed after six months.

After the treatment phase has started, patients are reas-
sessed  every  six  months  during  the  two  years  of  treat-
ment. These assessments are a combination of interviews 
and  computer-based  self-report  questionnaires.  In  addi-
tion, a selection of measures are also assessed every three 
months,  by  computer-based  self-report  questionnaires. 
After  end  of  the  treatment,  two  follow-up  assessments 
(six  and  12 months  after  end  of  the  treatment)  will  be 
administered. An overview of the measures is presented 
in  Table  1.  Candidate  predictors  of  (differential)  treat-
ment response that are assessed only once at baseline are 

not included in Table 1. These measures can be found in 
the Measures section.

All assessments are performed by trained local research 
assistants blind to the patients’ treatment condition, with 
exception  of  the  SCID-5  interviews,  demographic  inter-
view,  and  cost  interview.  The  SCID-5  interviews  can  be 
administered  by  trained  research  assistants  as  well  as 
trained  intake  staff  members,  both  blind  for  condition. 
The  demographic  interview  and  cost  interview  contain 
questions  on  healthcare  utilization  and  are  therefore 
performed by non-blinded local research assistants. Due 
to the nature of the interventions, blinding of therapists 
and  patients  is  not  possible.  All  interviews,  except  for 
the  SCID  interviews,  are  audio-recorded.  Participants 
receive  financial  compensation  for  their  involvement  in 
the  study.  Patients  who  discontinue  their  treatment  or 
deviate  from  the  treatment  protocol  will  be  encouraged 
to continue the assessments.

Treatments
Format

For patients of both DBT and ST, treatment has a maxi-
mum  duration  of  25 months  and  starts  with  a  pretreat-
ment  phase  of  approximately  four  weeks  consisting  of 
several (ST: ± three; DBT: ± five) individual sessions in 
which  patients  are  prepared  for  the  group  sessions  and 
become  accustomed  to  their  therapists  and  the  treat-
ment  model.  After  the  pretreatment  phase,  patients 
receive  a  combined  program  of  individual  sessions  and 
group  sessions  (i.e.,  treatment  phase).  Group  sessions 
of  both  treatments  are  offered  in  a  semi-open  format. 
If  treatment  slots  are  available,  new  patients  can  enter 
the ST group every 10 weeks and for DBT groups at the 
start  of  a  mindfulness  skills  module.  In  DBT,  the  treat-
ment  phase  has  a  maximum  duration  of  12 months  and 
consists  of  weekly  group  sessions  (i.e.,  skills  training 
groups;  150 min),  weekly  individual  psychotherapy  ses-
sions  (50 min),  and  between-session  consultation.  The 
between-session  consultation,  often  called  telephone 
consultation  although  all  kinds  of  technology  can  be 
used [95], is offered to the patient within limitations set 
by  the  individual  therapist,  varying  between  access  to 
between-session  support  within  working  hours  to  24/7 
access to between-session support, which is officially the 
standard in DBT. In ST, the treatment phase has a maxi-
mum  duration  of  18 months  consisting  of  weekly  group 
(90 min)  and  individual  (45 min)  psychotherapy  sessions 
for  a  period  of  12 months,  continued  by  weekly  group 
psychotherapy  sessions  and  biweekly  individual  psycho-
therapy sessions for a period of six months. Following the 
treatment  phase,  patients  continue  their  treatment  with 
a maintenance phase. The maintenance phase of DBT is 
a  recently  developed  blended  aftercare  program  with  a

authors  (e.g.,  [96–98])  to  extend  the  duration  of  DBT

aftercare program consists of monthly individual psycho-
therapy  sessions,  three-monthly  group  sessions,  and  an

to DBT handouts and worksheets [99]. The maintenance

apy  sessions  for  a  period  of  three  months,  continued 
by  three  months  of  one  individual  session  each  month.

working weeks a year, patients will receive about 167 h of 
treatment if they follow the treatment protocol. Patients 
who  have  completed  treatment  successfully  before  they 
reach  the  maximum  number  of  treatment  sessions  are 
allowed  to  complete  treatment  earlier,  although  the 
assessments  will  be  conducted  at  the  originally  planned 
assessment  points.  Early  termination  of  treatment 
requires  substantial  improvements  in  the  primary  and 
secondary  outcomes  and  is  decided  in  joint  decision  by 
the patient and therapist. The treatments are covered by 
the public health insurance. See Table 2 for an overview 
of the treatment formats.

Schema therapy (ST)

ST, developed by Jeffrey Young [22, 100], is based on an 
integrative cognitive model, combining cognitive behav-
ior  therapy  and  experiential  techniques  with  insights 
from  developmental  theories,  including  attachment  the-
ory, and psychodynamic concepts [23]. Central concepts 
are early maladaptive schemas and schema modes. Early 
maladaptive schemas can be defined as broad, pervasive 
patterns  of  thoughts,  emotions,  memories,  and  cogni-
tions  regarding  oneself  and  relationships  with  others, 
developed  during  childhood  [22].  ST  assumes  that  the 
frustration of core needs and early traumatic experiences 
lead to the development of early maladaptive schemas. A 
schema  mode  refers  to  an  activated  set  of  schemas  and 
the  associated  coping  response  (i.e.,  overcompensation, 
avoidance, and surrender), and describes the momentary 
emotional, cognitive, and behavioral state of the patient. 
The  following  schema  modes  are  characteristic  of  BPD 
[101]: 1) vulnerable child mode, associated with a fear of 
abandonment  and  strong  emotions,  such  as  loneliness, 
sadness,  and  helplessness,  2)  angry  and  impulsive  child 
mode,  characterized  by  anger,  frustration,  hostility,  and 
impulsivity,  3)  punitive  parent  mode,  representing  the 

internalized voice of very punitive and critical attachment 
figures  and  associated  with  self-criticism,  self-hatred, 
guilt, and self-denial, 4) detached protector mode, char-
acterized  by  attempts  to  cut  off  the  self  from  needs  and 
feelings, resulting in symptoms of detachment, substance 
misuse, social withdrawal, and self-harm, and 5) healthy 
modes, reflecting in functional thoughts, cognitions, and 
behavior  (i.e.,  healthy  adult  mode)  and  the  feeling  that 
core needs are been fulfilled (i.e., happy child mode). The 
first four modes are maladaptive schema modes and cen-
tral to BPD. The last two modes are functional and often 
only  weakly  present  at  the  beginning  of  the  treatment 
[102].  Idiosyncratic  schema  mode  models  usually  cover 
additional  modes,  depending  on  the  specific  problems 
and comorbidity of the patient.

ST aims to enable patients to fulfill their needs, reduce 
maladaptive  schema  modes,  and  strengthen  adaptive 
schema modes. In this study, ST is offered in a combined 
group-individual  format  developed  by  Farrell  and  Shaw 
[103].  The  group  acts  as  an  analogue  of  a  family  with 
the other patients as “siblings” and the two therapists as 
“parents” [103]. The group may speed up and amplify the 
effect of treatment by offering corrective emotional expe-
riences, peer support, opportunities for in vivo practice, 
and  a  sense  of  understanding  [104].  The  individual  ST 
follows the protocol as described by Arntz and Van Gen-
deren [105].

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)

DBT  is  a  comprehensive  cognitive  behaviorally  based 
treatment  for  BPD,  integrating  strategies  from  cogni-
tive  and  behavioral  treatments,  Zen-based  acceptance 
strategies,  and  dialectical  strategies  [19,  106].  Linehan 
[19,  20]  proposed  a  skills  deficit  model  in  which  emo-
tion  regulation  is  central.  More  specifically,  the  model 
holds  that  the  problematic  behaviors  associated  with 

  
 
Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89 

Page 10 of 28

BPD  (e.g.,  suicide  attempts,  self-injury,  substance  use) 
are in fact best understood as dysfunctional attempts to 
regulate  emotions.  Emotion  dysregulation  results  from 
the complex transaction between dispositional emotional 
vulnerabilities  and  an  adverse  invalidating  environment. 
Therefore,  the  treatment  involves  balancing  problem 
solving  strategies  with  loads  of  validation.  DBT  aims  to 
help  patients  develop  new  skills,  enhance  motivation, 
ensure generalization of skills use, and change their envi-
ronment  if  needed.  In  addition,  DBT  aims  to  enhance 
therapists’ motivation to deliver effective treatment [20].

DBT involves skills training groups, individual therapy, 
between-session  consultation,  and  therapist  consulta-
tion  team  meetings.  DBT  skills  training  groups  teach 
patients  behavioral  skills  in  four  different,  yet  inter-
related,  areas:  mindfulness,  interpersonal  effectiveness, 
emotion  regulation,  and  distress  tolerance  /  radical 
acceptance.  Individual  therapy  focuses  on  motivational 
issues  and  the  acquisition  and  use  of  skills  in  daily  life. 
A  predetermined  ordering  of  treatment  targets  is  used 
in  individual  sessions  and  part  of  different  stages  of  the 
treatment. Stage 1 focuses on stabilizing the patient and 
behavior  control.  Targets  in  this  stage  of  the  treatment 
include: 
life-threatening  behavior,  therapy-interfering 
behavior,  quality-of-life-interfering  behavior,  and  behav-
ior  skills.  Stage  2  focuses  on  reducing  posttraumatic 
stress and requires exposure to trauma-related cues [19]. 
Finally, Stages 3 and 4 target self-respect and the sense of 
incompleteness. However, due to time constraints, some 
patients might not enter all stages and most studies have 
focused on Stage 1 DBT [107]. Individual therapists pro-
vide between-session (telephone) consultation if needed. 
According  to  the  guidelines  of  DBT,  access  to  between-
session  consultation  outside  of  office  hours,  preferably 
by  the  individual  therapist,  is  part  of  DBT  [19].  In  this 
trial,  between-session  consultation  by  the  individual 
therapist  will  be  within  limitations  set  by  the  therapist, 
which  can  vary  between  support  provided  within  work-
ing  hours  to  24/7  access  to  telephone  consultation.  As 
access  to  between-session  (telephone)  consultation  will 
vary between centers and individual therapists, the effect 
of  therapist’s  availability  for  between-session  support 
will be examined. Finally, DBT therapists meet weekly in 
a  DBT  consultation  team  to  motivate  and  support  each 
other.

Therapists, training, and supervision

The  therapists  in  this  study  will  be  licensed  psycholo-
gists,  psychotherapists,  psychiatrists,  or  psychiatric 
nurses.  Individual  and  group  schema  therapists  must 
have completed a basic training in individual ST. Group 
schema therapists must have also completed a four-day 
training  in  the  group  schema  therapy  model  of  Farrell 

and  Shaw  [103].  All  schema  therapists  receive  a  one-
day  training  in  experiential  techniques  by  a  certified 
ST  trainer.  DBT  therapists  are  required  to  complete  a 
three-day  training  in  DBT  and  at  least  one  member  of 
the  DBT  team  must  have  completed  the  10-day  inten-
sive  DBT  training.  In  addition,  DBT  therapists  receive 
a  two-day  kick-off  training  by  certified  DBT  trainers 
to  expand  their  knowledge  of  DBT.  Moreover,  DBT-
therapists  were  given  the  opportunity  to  participate 
in  a  one-day  training  in  imaginal  exposure.  Accord-
ing  to  Linehan  [19],  reducing  behaviors  and  stress 
response  patterns  related  to  traumatic  life  events  is  a 
primary  DBT  target.  Reducing  posttraumatic  stress  is 
mostly part of Stage 2 of DBT and involves exposure to 
trauma-associated cues [19, 108]. However, some of the 
DBT  therapists  expressed  concerns  about  their  ability 
to  apply  the  principles  and  procedures  of  exposure  to 
treat  traumatic  memories  in  BPD  patients.  Therefore, 
the  opportunity  to  participate  in  a  one-day  exposure 
training was offered to the therapists.

Before the start of the study, schema therapists should 
have  received  at  least  10  individual  supervision  ses-
sions  by  a  licensed  supervisor.  There  is  no  requirement 
for  the  minimum  number  of  DBT  supervision  sessions. 
During  the  study,  therapists  receive  supervision  over  a 
period  of  two  years  by  certified  supervisors.  ST  super-
vision  is  provided  through  teleconferencing  biweekly  in 
the beginning, then (two-)monthly after six to 12 months, 
depending on the experience of the therapists. DBT ther-
apists receive supervision at location every three months. 
Moreover, there will be weekly DBT team meetings (i.e., 
DBT consultation team meetings) and biweekly ST team 
meetings.  All  individual  ST  sessions  will  be  audiotaped, 
while  individual  DBT  sessions  and  ST  and  DBT  group 
sessions will be videotaped. These recordings are used for 
supervision and treatment adherence ratings. Treatment 
adherence,  a  component  of  treatment  integrity  (i.e.,  the 
extent to which a treatment is implemented as intended; 
[109]), refers to the extent to which the therapist utilizes 
prescribed techniques and procedures and avoids the use 
of  proscribed  techniques  and  procedures  [110].  Adher-
ence  will  be  assessed  in  a  random  selection  of  session 
recordings by trained raters (master psychology students) 
blind  for  condition.  Master  psychology  students  will  be 
trained by ST and DBT experts by using session record-
ings  not  used  in  the  final  adherence  rating  to  practice 
with the instruments. Individual ST sessions will be rated 
on  an  adapted  version  of  the  Therapy  Adherence  and 
Competence  scale  for  ST  for  BPD  [111]  and  group  ST 
sessions will be rated on the Group Schema Therapy Rat-
ing  Scale  –  Revised  [112].  Individual  DBT  sessions  will 
be  rated  on  the  Dutch  translation  of  the  observer-rated 
version  of  the  DBT  Adherence  Checklist  for  Individual 

Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89

Therapy  [113].  An  observer-rated  instrument  will  be 
developed to assess the skills training groups.

Other treatment

During the treatment, patients are not allowed to engage 
in  any  other  form  of  psychological  treatment.  However, 
in case of acute crisis, the crisis procedures of the treat-
ments  will  be  followed  (e.g.,  telephone  consultation  by 
the  therapist,  contact  a  crisis  line,  visit  the  emergency 
room, hospitalization, individual crisis management ses-
sions).  Any  additional  treatment  will  be  recorded  and 
included in the analyses. Patients will only be withdrawn 
from the study at their request.

Coronavirus disease (COVID‑19) pandemic

This  study  is  conducted  during  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic. The pandemic is expected to have adverse effects 
on  patients  with  mental  health  disorders  [114].  In  addi-
tion, in case face-to-face treatment is restricted in mental 
healthcare  centers  because  of  government  and  health-
care  center  policy,  the  treatment  will  be  delivered  via 
videoconferencing.  Consequently,  differences  between 
patients  will  arise  regarding  the  amount  of  treatment 
sessions delivered during the pandemic and/or via vide-
oconferencing.  We  will  control  for  a  potential  influence 
of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  by,  for  example,  adding 
dynamic  regression  parameters  that  include  the  impact 
of time in treatment during the pandemic. The definition 
of  the  indicator  variable  indicating  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic  will  be  decided  before  start  of  the  data-analyses 
(e.g., dummy variable indicating pandemic/no pandemic 
or  continuous  variable  indicating  the  amount  of  time  in 
treatment  during  the  pandemic),  given  the  unpredict-
ability  of  the  current  situation.  Moreover,  exploratory 
analyses  may  be  conducted  to  investigate  the  potential 
influence  of  the  deviating  treatment  format  (i.e.,  online 
vs.  face-to-face  individual  sessions  and/or  group  ses-
sions) on the treatment effectiveness.

In addition, the assessments will be conducted via vide-
oconferencing  or  phone,  and  the  computer-based  ques-
tionnaires  will  be  completed  by  participants  at  home,  if 
face-to-face  assessments  are  not  allowed.  Before  receiv-
ing  the  treatment  and/or  assessments  via  videoconfer-
encing, patients will sign an additional informed consent 
form (see Additional file 2, Appendix B).

Data management, storage, monitoring, 
and dissemination

Data is collected with a unique identifier for each patient 
(i.e.,  pseudonym)  using  the  online  survey  software  pro-
gram Qualtrics [115] and the web tool Lotus, which has 
been  especially  developed  for  longitudinal  research  by 
the University of Amsterdam. The list of pseudonyms and 

personal information of patients within a particular men-
tal healthcare center is securely stored at the center and 
only  accessible  for  the  research  assistant  and  coordina-
tor  of  this  center.  A  different  set  of  pseudonyms  is  used 
for data collected by clinicians (i.e., intake questionnaire 
and  recordings).  The  list  with  the  combination  of  both 
pseudonyms of patients is only accessible for the research 
assistant  and  coordinator  of  the  center  and  the  author-
ized  researchers.  The  data  is  stored  on  a  secure  storage 
server of the University of Amsterdam, accessible only to 
authorized researchers.

All (serious) adverse events reported by the patient or 
observed  by  clinicians  or  researchers  will  be  recorded. 
There is no data monitoring committee and the study will 
not be audited. The results of the study will be dissemi-
nated  in  scientific  journals  and  presentations  at  (inter)
national scientific conferences.

Measures

The  instruments  include  screening  measures,  measures 
to assess potential predictors and mediators of treatment 
response,  and  outcome  measures.  The  instruments  that 
were  not  available  in  Dutch  were  translated  (i.e.,  Brief 
Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire, Dialectical Behav-
ior  Therapy-Ways  of  Coping  Checklist,  Gordon  Test  of 
Visual  Imagery  Control,  Positive  Mental  Health  scale, 
and  social  problems)  by  bi-lingual  experts.  The  trans-
lations  were  checked  for  consistency  with  the  original 
version.  Items,  questionnaires,  and  interviews  that  have 
been developed or modified by the authors are available 
upon request by the first author.

Screening

Mental  disorders  The  SCID-5  is  a  semi-structured 
interview  used  to  diagnose  DSM-5  disorders.  Personal-
ity disorders are assessed with the SCID-5-PD [116] and 
syndrome  disorders  are  assessed  using  the  SCID-5-S 
[117], which is an extended version of the SCID-5 Clini-
cian Version (SCID-5-CV; [118]). Additional file 3 offers 
an  overview  of  all  syndrome  disorders  that  are  assessed 
by  the  SCID-5-S.  Based  on  a  first  psychometric  evalua-
tion  in  a  psychiatric  patient  sample,  Somma  et  al.  [119] 
found an adequate interrater reliability of the SCID-5-PD. 
In addition, the SCID-5-CV has demonstrated good psy-
chometric properties [120–122].

Before  administering  the  SCID-5-S  and/or  SCID-5-PD, 
self-report screening questionnaires (SCID-5-SPQ; [123], 
and  SCID-5-SV;  [124])  may  be  administered.  In  accord-
ance  with  the  instructions  for  administering  the  SCID, 
disorders  and  criteria  of  disorders  not  affirmed  by  the 
screening  questionnaires  and  not  considered  as  false

negatives  by  the  clinician  will  be  assumed  to  be  absent. 
The SCID-5 will be assessed during the screening phase 
and 12 months after end of the treatment.

disappointments.  In  previous  research  among  Dutch 
patients with a personality disorder, the subscale demon-
strated moderate to good reliability [129].

Motivation and availability  A 13-item semi-structured 
motivation  interview  is  used  to  assess  several  exclusion 
criteria (e.g., no fixed address, have received ST or DBT 
in the past year) and patient’s motivation and availability.

Predictors

As mentioned, candidate predictor variables of (differen-
tial) treatment response have been selected using a multi-
method approach (i.e., literature, suggestions of a patient 
representative of the Borderline Foundation of the Neth-
erlands,  and  semi-structured  interviews  with  18  expert 
clinicians). Additional file 4, Table 1 offers an overview of 
the predictors that have emerged during the semi-struc-
tured interviews with clinicians. Additional file 4, Table 2 
offers an overview of the predictors based on the litera-
ture and suggestions of a patient representative. The can-
didate predictors of (differential) treatment response are 
assessed at baseline. Only the measures that are not part 
of the screening, mediator or outcome measures will be 
briefly described in this paragraph.

Autistic traits  Autistic traits are assessed by the abbre-
viated  version  of  the  Autism  Spectrum  Quotient,  the 
AQ-10  [125].  The  AQ-10  consists  of  10  items  rated  on 
a  four  point  Likert  scale.  The  AQ-10  has  demonstrated 
acceptable  psychometric  properties  in  an  adult  general 
population sample [126].

Commitment  Patient  commitment  to  treatment 
is 
measured with a selection of items of the subscale Moti-
vation to Engage of the Treatment Motivation Scales for 
forensic  outpatient  treatment  (TMS-F;  [127]).  The  four 
items can be rated on a seven point Likert scale.

Experiential  avoidance  The  Brief  Experiential  Avoid-
ance  Questionnaire  (BEAQ;  [128])  is  a  15-item  scale 
assessing experiential avoidance across six domains (i.e., 
behavioral avoidance, distress aversion, suppression, pro-
crastination,  repression/denial,  and  distress  endurance). 
The  items  can  be  rated  on  a  six  point  Likert  scale.  The 
BEAQ  has  shown  good  psychometric  properties  among 
psychiatric outpatients [128].

intolerance  Frustration 

is 
Frustration 
assessed  by  the  Frustration  Tolerance  subscale  of  the 
Severity  Indices  of  Personality  Problems  (SIPP-118; 
[129]). This subscale consists of eight 4-point Likert scale 
items measuring the capacity to cope  with  setbacks and 

intolerance 

Insight  A  modified  version  of  the  Self-Reflection  and 
Insight  Scale  (SRIS;  [130,  131])  is  used  to  assess  self-
reflection  and  insight.  The  SRIS  contains  20  five  point 
Likert  scale  items.  The  SRIS  has  shown  good  reliability 
and validity in student samples [130, 132].

Internal  locus  of  control 
Internal  locus  of  control, 
defined  as  the  extent  to  which  a  person  experiences  an 
outcome as the result of their own behavior or personal 
characteristics  rather  than  external  circumstance,  is 
assessed  by  the  Locus  of  Control  scale  (IE;  [133]).  The 
IE  contains  10  five  point  Likert  scale  items.  Previous 
research has demonstrated adequate psychometric prop-
erties [133, 134].

Level  of  personality  functioning  The  Level  of  Personal-
ity Functioning Scale-Brief Form 2.0 (LPFS-BF 2.0; [135]) 
assesses  impairment  in  personality  functioning  accord-
ing to the DSM-5 alternative model for personality disor-
ders. The LPFS-BF 2.0 contains 12 four point Likert scale 
items.  Based  on  a  first  psychometric  evaluation  among 
Dutch  patients  referred  to  a  specialized  mental  health-
care center for personality disorders, the LPFS-BF 2.0 has 
demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties [135].

Mental  imagery  capacity  Mental  imagery  capacity  is 
assessed with the 12-item Gordon Test of Visual Imagery 
Control  (TVIC;  [136]).  The  TVIC  assesses  the  ability  to 
visualize and manipulate a given scenario in response to 
a set of cues. Participants can response on a three point 
Likert scale. In addition to the 12 Likert scale items, we 
measure  the  time  it  takes  the  participant  to  visualize 
the scenarios. Finally, we have added two 100 mm visual 
analog  scale  (VAS)  items  measuring  how  well  partici-
pants see the scenarios that were described and how dif-
ficult  it  was  for  the  participant  to  visualize  the  different 
scenarios.  The  TVIC  has  demonstrated  fair  to  satisfac-
tory internal consistency and validity among community 
samples and undergraduates [137–140].

Mentalizing capacity  Mentalizing capacity is measured 
using an eight-item version of the Reflective Functioning 
Questionnaire (RFQ-8; [141]). The RFQ-8 comprises two 
dimensions:  uncertainty  about  mental  states,  reflecting 
hypomentalizing, and certainty about mental states, indi-
cating  hypermentalizing.  The  RFQ-8  uses  a  seven  point 
Likert  scale.  In  previous  research  among  BPD  patients, 
the questionnaire has demonstrated satisfactory psycho-
metric properties [141–143].

Perfectionism  The  eight-item  Frost  Multidimensional 
Perfectionism  Scale-Brief  (F-MPS-Brief;  [144])  assesses 
perfectionism  across  two  dimensions  (evaluative  con-
cerns and striving). Items are rated on a five point Likert 
scale.  Psychometric  properties  of  the  F-MPS-Brief  were 
found  to  be  good  in  clinical  and  community  samples 
[144].

traits  Personality 

Personality 
traits  are  measured, 
among  others,  with  the  Ten-Item  Personality  Inventory 
(TIPI; [145, 146]), which is a brief measure of the Big-Five 
personality  dimensions.  The  10  items  can  be  rated  on  a 
seven point Likert scale. The TIPI has shown low to mod-
erate  internal  consistency  and  adequate  validity  among 
students [145, 146].

Positive  mental  health  Positive  mental  health,  often 
referred  to  as  mental  well-being,  is  assessed  using  the 
nine-item  Positive  Mental  Health  scale  (PMH-scale; 
[147]).  The  items  can  be  rated  on  a  nine  point  Likert 
scale.  Based  on  a  previous  study  on  the  psychometric 
properties of the PMH-scale in student, patient and gen-
eral  samples,  the  PMH-scale  was  found  to  be  a  reliable 
and valid instrument [147].

and  maladaptive 

Psychopathology 
personality 
traits  The  Minnesota  Multiphasic  Personality  Inven-
tory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF; [148]) measures 
a wide  range  of psychopathology symptoms,  personality 
characteristics,  and  behavioral  proclivities.  The  MMPI-
2-RF  consists  of  338  true-false  items  aggregating  onto 
51  individual  scales.  The  psychometric  properties  of 
the MMPI-2-RF varied from inadequate to good among 
normative,  outpatient,  and  inpatients  samples,  as  docu-
mented in detail in the Technical Manual [149].

Readiness to change  Readiness to change is assessed by 
two subscales (contemplation and action) of the 24-item 
version of the University of Rhode Island Change Assess-
ment  (URICA;  [150–152]).  Both  subscales  are  meas-
ured  by  six  5-point  Likert  scale  items  and  have  demon-
strated good reliability across a diversity of studies (e.g., 
[153–155]).

Rigidity  Rigidity  is  measured  by  the  Rigidity  subscale 
of  the  Computerized  Adaptive  Test  of  Personality  Dis-
order-Static  Form  (CAT-PD-SF;  [156]).  The  Rigidity 
subscale contains 10 five point Likert scale items reflect-
ing  an  unwillingness  to  consider  alternative  perspec-
tives and inflexibility in values and beliefs. The subscale 
has  demonstrated  good  reliability  among  community 
adults with current or a history of mental health treat-
ment [156].

Social  problems  By  using  the  social  problems  list, 
derived  from  the  Improving  Access  to  Psychological 
Therapies  (IAPT)  program  [157],  social  problems  (e.g., 
financial  problems,  housing  problem,  and  unemploy-
ment) are assessed in direct discussion with the patient.

Social support  The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived 
Social  Support  (MSPSS;  [158])  is  assessed  to  investigate 
perceived support from three sources: significant others, 
family, and friends. The MSPSS contains 12 items which 
can be rated on a seven point Likert scale. Psychometric 
properties of the MSPSS are satisfactory among psychiat-
ric  outpatients  and  BPD  patients  [159,  160].  In  addition 
to  the  MSPSS,  the  research  assistant  rates  the  patient’s 
social  network  taking  into  account  the  size  of  the  net-
work and potential pathogenic influences.

Stigma  of  immutability  BPD  has  been  associated  to 
stigma  of  immutability  [161].  We  have  developed  five 
7-point  Likert  scale  items  assessing  the  extent  to  which 
participants believe that BPD is resistant to treatment.

Trauma  The  Traumatic  Experience  Checklist  (TEC; 
[162])  is  used  to  assess  traumatic  experiences,  includ-
ing  emotional  abuse,  emotional  neglect,  sexual  abuse, 
sexual  harassment,  physical  abuse,  and  threat  to  life/ 
bizarre  punishment/  intense  pain.  The  TEC  includes  30 
descriptions  of  various  traumatic  experiences.  The  TEC 
has  demonstrated  favorable  psychometric  properties  in 
Dutch psychiatric patients [162].

Verbal  intelligence  The  Dutch  version  of  the  National 
Adult Reading Test (DART; [163]) is used as a proxy for 
verbal intelligence. The DART is a reading test including 
50 irregularly spelled words. Based on previous research, 
the DART yields an adequate estimation of verbal intel-
ligence and has shown adequate psychometric properties 
across a variety of populations [164].

Other patient characteristics, collected using a self‑report 
In addition to the questionnaires, partici-
questionnaire 
pants fill out several questions developed by the authors 
about  the  willingness  and  ability  to  engage  in  a  thera-
peutic  relationship,  perceived  suitability  of  DBT  and  ST 
(treatment preference), and the absence or presence of an 
attachment figure in the past.

Other  patient  characteristics,  collected  using  a  question‑
naire filled out by clinicians (intake questionnaire)  Cli-
nicians responsible for the intake assessment will fill out 
the  nine-item  intake  questionnaire  for  each  participant, 
including  questions  about  the  willingness  and  ability  to 
engage in a therapeutic relationship, the willingness and

ability to examine the link between childhood history and 
present problems, high vs. low level borderline personal-
ity organization [165], the request for help, the degree to 
which  a  syndrome  disorder  might  interfere  with  treat-
ment response, and perceived suitability of DBT and ST. 
These questions have been formulated by the authors.

Mediators

Both  treatments  include  non-specific  (attachment  and 
therapeutic  alliance),  BPD-treatment-generic  (therapeu-
tic  environment  characterized  by  genuineness,  safety, 
and  equality),  and  BPD-treatment-specific  (ST:  beliefs 
and  schema  modes;  DBT:  emotion  regulation  and  skills 
use) mechanisms of change. The proposed mediators are 
repeatedly  measured:  at  baseline,  except  for  measures 
requiring  information  about  the  therapy  (i.e.,  therapeu-
tic  environment,  therapeutic  alliance,  and  attachment 
styles  with  respect  to  the  most  important  therapist  and 
group members), and every six months after start of the 
treatment phase. In addition, a selection of the proposed 
mediators  (i.e.,  selection  of  schema  modes,  skills  use, 
beliefs,  and  therapeutic  environment)  are  also  collected 
every  three  months  after  start  of  the  treatment  phase, 
during the first two years.

Attachment  The  Experience  in  Close  Relationships-
Relationship Structures Questionnaire (ECR-RS; [166]) is 
a brief version of the Experience in Close Relationships-
Revised  (ECR-R;  [167]).  The  ECR-RS  measures  attach-
ment  patterns  in  different  relational  domains,  such  as 
relationships  with  parents  and  friends. The  ECR-RS  can 
also  be  adapted  to  measure  a  person’s  general  attach-
ment  style.  In  this  study,  three  versions  of  the  ECR-RS 
are used, measuring general attachment style and attach-
ment styles with respect to two targets (i.e., most impor-
tant  therapist  and  group  members).  The  ECR-RS  con-
tains  nine  items,  assessing  two  attachment  dimensions: 
attachment-related  anxiety  and  avoidance.  The  items 
can  be  rated  on  a  seven  point  Likert  scale. The  ECR-RS 
has  shown  adequate  psychometric  properties  in  a  large 
web-based sample (N > 21.000), comparable to the ECR-R 
[166].  As  experience  with  the  treatment  is  required  in 
order to be able to complete the questions about the most 
important therapist and group members, these questions 
will be filled out three weeks after start of the treatment 
phase.

Idiosyncratic  dysfunctional  beliefs  were  elicited 
Beliefs 
with a semi-structured interview at baseline. Three to five 
idiosyncratic dysfunctional beliefs related to the self (e.g., 
“I am worthless”), others (e.g., “People always reject me”), 
and  emotions  (e.g.,  “Expressing  emotions  is  a  sign  of 

weakness”)  are  formulated.  Participants  rate  the  degree 
to  which  they  believe  in  each  statement  on  a  100 mm 
VAS at baseline and at every subsequent assessment. This 
procedure has been used in previous research (e.g., [168, 
169]). The VAS has found to be useful for assessing vari-
ations  in  intensity  of  beliefs  in  patients  with  a  personal-
ity  disorder  [169].  In  addition  to  the  idiosyncratic  dys-
functional beliefs, participants rate the credibility of one 
functional belief (“I consider myself a good person”) on a 
100 mm VAS.

Emotion  regulation  Emotion  regulation  is  assessed  by 
the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form 
(DERS-SF; [170]), a brief version of the widely used DERS 
[171].  The  DERS-SF  measures  non-acceptance  of  emo-
tional  responses,  difficulties  engaging  in  goal-directed 
behavior,  impulse  control  difficulties,  limited  access  to 
emotion  regulation  strategies,  lack  of  emotional  clarity, 
and lack of emotional awareness. The awareness subscale 
is  excluded  based  on  recommendations  of  among  oth-
ers  Hallion  et  al.  [172]  and  Bardeen  et  al.  [173].  Lack  of 
emotional  awareness  is  assessed  by  the  Awareness  sub-
scale  of  the  Difficulties  in  Emotion  Regulation  Scale  18 
(DERS-18;  [174]).  The  DERS-SF,  without  the  awareness 
subscale, consists of 15 items. The Awareness subscale of 
the  DERS-18  is  measured  by  three  items.  All  items  can 
be rated on a five point Likert scale. Both questionnaires 
have demonstrated good psychometric properties among 
outpatients [172].

Schema  mode  ratings  The  Schema  Mode  Inventory 
(SMI;  [175])  measures  the  extent  to  which  16  different 
(dysfunctional  as  well  as  functional)  schema  modes  are 
endorsed. The SMI consists of 143 items that are scored 
on  a  six  point  Likert  scale.  Previous  research  using  a 
sample  of  non-patients  and  patients  with  a  syndrome 
disorder  and/or  personality  disorder  has  demonstrated 
acceptable psychometric properties [176]. The five mala-
daptive schema modes that are central to BPD (i.e., vul-
nerable  child,  angry  child,  impulsive  child,  detached 
protector, and punitive parent; [101]) and one functional 
schema mode (i.e., healthy adult) are assessed every three 
months during the first two years.

Skills  use  The  59-item  Dialectical  Behavior  Ther-
apy-Ways  of  Coping  Checklist  (DBT-WCCL;  [177])  is 
an  adaptation  of  the  Revised  Ways  of  Coping  Check-
list  (RWCCL;  [178]).  The  DBT-WCCL  measures  DBT 
skills  use  and  maladaptive  coping  skills  use  over  the 
previous  month.  All  items  are  assessed  using  a  four 
point  Likert  scale.  The  DBT-WCCL  has  shown  ade-
quate  to  excellent  reliability  and  validity  among  BPD 
patients [177].

Page 15 of 28

Therapeutic  alliance  The  therapeutic  alliance  is  meas-
ured  with  the  Working  Alliance  Inventory-Short  (WAI-
S;  [179,  180]).  The  WAI-S  consists  of  three  subscales 
(agreement  on  goals,  agreement  on  tasks,  and  bond 
between  patient  and  therapist),  each  consisting  of  four 
items  which  can  be  scored  on  a  five  point  Likert  scale. 
Observed  psychometric  properties  of  the  WAI-S  were 
satisfactory in a patient sample [179, 181]. Since experi-
ence with the treatment is required in order to be able to 
complete  the  WAI-S,  the  WAI-S  will  be  filled  out  three 
weeks after start of the treatment phase.

therapeutic  environment 

Therapeutic  environment  Key  characteristics  of  a  pro-
moting 
(i.e.,  genuineness, 
safety, and equality) are assessed by 13 items formulated 
by  ST  experts  (A.  Arntz  and  O.  Brand-de  Wilde)  and 
rated  on  a  100 mm  VAS.  The  items  measure  the  extent 
to which the participant feels a) the individual therapist, 
group  therapists,  and  group  members  are  genuine  with 
him/her; b) he or she can tell the individual therapist and 
group therapists everything; c) safe in the individual and 
group therapy; d) safe to show vulnerability and express 
negative feelings in the individual and group therapy; e) 
the individual and group therapists take personal respon-
sibility for their mistakes; and f ) the individual and group 
therapists  see  him/her  as  equal.  Since  experience  with 
the treatment is required in order to be able to complete 
this questionnaire, this questionnaire will not be assessed 
at baseline.

Primary outcome

BPD  severity  The  primary  outcome  measure  is  the 
change  in  severity  and  frequency  of  the  DSM-5  BPD 
manifestations between baseline until three-year follow-
up,  assessed  with  the  total  score  of  the  Borderline  Per-
sonality  Disorder  Severity  Index  version  5  (BPDSI-5; 
[182,  183]).  The  BPDSI-5  is  a  semi-structured  interview 
consisting  of  70  items  rating  the  nine  DSM-5  BPD  cri-
teria over the prior three months. All items are rated on 
a  11-point  Likert  scale  (0 = never  to  10 = daily),  except 
for  the  subscale  Identity  Disturbance  which  is  rated  on 
a 5-point Likert Scale (0 = absent to 4 = dominant, clear, 
and  well-defined)  and  multiplied  by  2.5.  The  total  score 
consists of the sum of the nine criteria scores and ranges 
from 0 to 90. The scores on the BPDSI-5 subscales pro-
vide information on the severity of each of the nine cri-
teria.  The  BPDSI-5  is  a  modified  version  of  the  BPDSI-
IV [182, 183] in which a few questions have been slightly 
reworded  and  exact  frequency  scores  have  been  added 
in addition to the Likert scale. The BPDSI-IV has proven 
to  be  a  reliable  and  valid  measure  among  non-patients 

and  (BPD)  patients  [182,  183].  Previous  research  has 
shown  that  a  cut-off  score  of  15  differentiates  between 
BPD  patients  and  controls  [183].  In  addition,  a  score  of 
20  distinguishes  BPD  patients  from  non-BPD  patients 
[183–185].

Secondary outcome measures

As accumulating evidence suggests that BPD severity and 
level  of  functioning  are  only  loosely  associated,  atten-
tion  will  be  paid  to  outcomes  in  different  areas,  includ-
ing symptoms, functioning, and well-being. The outcome 
measures  are  administered  at  baseline  and  every  six 
months  after  start  of  the  treatment  phase.  In  addition, 
patients’  ratings  of  experienced  burden  due  to  BPD 
manifestations  and  well-being  are  collected  every  three 
months after start of the treatment phase, during the first 
two years.

Costs  Costs,  including  healthcare  costs,  patient  and 
family costs, and costs outside the healthcare sector, are 
measured using a retrospective cost interview especially 
designed for BPD patients [80]. Healthcare costs include 
visits  to  general  practitioners,  hospitals,  crisis  centers, 
psychologists and psychiatrists, use of medication, social 
work,  paramedical  care,  and  alternative  treatments. 
Patient  and  family  costs  include  informal  care  (i.e.,  care 
provided  by  the  patient’s  family,  friends,  or  neighbors) 
and  out  of  pocket  costs  (e.g.,  drugs,  alcohol,  excessive 
spending).  Costs  in  other  sectors  include  productiv-
ity  losses  from  unpaid  work  (study  and  voluntary  work) 
and paid work. Since it is difficult to distinguish between 
BPD-related  costs  and  costs  due  to  other  psychological 
disorders  [17],  only  a  distinction  will  be  made  between 
costs  due  to  psychological  disorders  and  costs  due  to 
somatic  diseases.  The  cost  interview  will  be  conducted 
by  trained  research  assistants  using  a  recall  period  of 
six  months  (baseline  assessment),  the  number  of  weeks 
since randomization (assessment six months after start of 
the  treatment  phase),  or  the  number  of  weeks  since  the 
previous assessment (assessments 12, 18, and 24 months 
after  start  of  the  treatment  phase  and  both  follow-up 
assessments).

Dutch  guidelines  [186,  187]  will  be  used  to  determine 
total  costs.  Healthcare  costs  will  be  calculated  by  vol-
umes  of  resource  use  multiplied  by  their  corresponding 
unit costs, derived from Hakkaart-van Roijen et al. [186]. 
Prescribed  medication  costs  will  be  determined  based 
on  national  reference  prices.  Informal  care  costs  will  be 
computed by multiplying the number of hours the patient 
receives  informal  care  by  shadow  prices  [186].  Shadow 
prices will also be used to value lost productivity in study 

 Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89 

Page 16 of 28

and  voluntary  work.  Productivity  losses  from  paid  work 
will be valued according to the Human Capital Approach 
[188]. Out of pocket costs, such as alcohol and excessive 
spending,  will  be  directly  retrieved  from  the  cost  inter-
view or, in case of over-the-counter medication, from the 
Dutch Pharmacotherapeutic Compass [186].

ment  status)  will  be  collected  using  a  semi-structured 
demographic interview. During this interview, additional 
patient characteristics such as treatment history, request 
for help, medication use, substance use, and duration of 
BPD manifestations will be recorded. For an overview of 
all characteristics, see Additional file 4.

Experienced  burden  due  to  BPD  Patient’s  self-reported 
experienced burden of BPD manifestations are measured 
using the Ultrashort BPD Checklist, a shortened version 
of the validated BPD Checklist [189]. The Ultrashort BPD 
Checklist consists of nine to 11 5-point Likert scale items 
(the number of items will be based on the upcoming vali-
dation study), each related to a specific DSM-5 BPD cri-
terion.  Based  on  an  initial  psychometric  evaluation,  the 
Ultrashort BPD Checklist showed good to excellent psy-
chometric  properties  in  a  sample  with  BPD  and  cluster 
C patients, patients with a syndrome disorder, and non-
patients, similar to the BPD Checklist [189].

General psychopathological symptoms  The Brief Symp-
tom Inventory (BSI; [190, 191]) is a self-report instrument 
measuring  general  psychiatric  symptoms  at  the  time  of 
assessment. The  BSI  is  a  short  version  of  the  Symptom-
Check-List  (SCL-90-R)  and  contains  53  items  assessing 
nine  symptom  dimensions:  somatization,  obsession-
compulsion,  interpersonal  sensitivity,  depression,  anxi-
ety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psy-
choticism. All items are assessed using a five point Likert 
scale. Previous research in Dutch community and patient 
samples  has  demonstrated  good  reliability  and  validity 
[191, 192].

Global functioning and impairment  Global functioning 
and impairment is assessed by the 36-item World Health 
Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHO-
DAS  2.0)  interview  version  [193].  The  WHODAS  2.0  is 
a  general  measure  to  assess  disability  in  six  major  life 
domains (cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life 
activities, and participation). For each item, participants 
have  to  report  how  much  difficulty  they  experienced  in 
the last 30 days. The six domain scores and overall func-
tioning score have shown good psychometric properties 

in a general population sample as well as a patient sample 
[193].

Quality  of  life  Generic  quality  of  life  is  assessed  using 
the  5-level  EuroQol  5D  version  (EQ-5D-5L;  [194]).  The 
questionnaire  measures  five  health  state  dimensions 
(mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities,  pain/discomfort, 
and  anxiety/depression).  Each  dimension  is  divided  into 
five severity levels: no problem, slight problems, moder-
ate  problems,  severe  problems,  and  extreme  problems. 
The  profiles  from  the  five  health  state  dimensions  are 
assigned a value based on the Dutch social tariffs to gen-
erate  health  utilities  [195].  These  utilities  will  be  used 
to  calculate  Quality  Adjusted  Life  Years  (QALYs)  by 
multiplying  the  change  in  utility  values  between  assess-
ments by the length of the period between assessments. 
In  addition  to  the  five  health  state  dimensions,  the  EQ-
5D-5L  contains  a  VAS  item  which  records  the  patient’s 
self-reported  health  status  ranging  from  0  (worst  health 
you  can  imagine)  to  100  (best  health  you  can  imagine). 
The EQ-5D-5L has shown to be a reliable and valid meas-
ure among different patient groups in different countries 
[196].

As  a  complement  to  the  EQ-5D-5L,  the  Mental  Health 
Quality  of  Life 
seven-dimensional  Questionnaire 
(MHQoL-7D; [197]) will be administered. The MHQoL-
7D  is  a  recently  developed  instrument  to  assess  quality 
of life specifically in people with mental health problems. 
The MHQoL-7D consists of seven quality of life domains 
(self-image,  independence,  mood,  relationships,  daily 
activities,  physical  health,  and  hope)  and  a  VAS  item 
which  records  the  patient’s  self-reported  psychological 
well-being.  A  study  into  the  psychometric  properties  of 
the  MHQoL-7D  is  currently  running.  The  MHQoL-7D 
will only be included in the analysis if it is demonstrated 
to  be  a  psychometrically  sound  instrument  and  Dutch 
social tariffs are available.

Sleep 
Insomnia  complaints  are  assessed  by  the  Insom-
nia  Severity  Index  (ISI;  [198]).  The  ISI  contains  seven 
items  that  are  scored  on  a  five  point  Likert  scale.  The 
ISI  has  shown  to  be  a  valid  measure  in  community  and 
insomnia  patient  samples  [198],  although  the  reliabil-
ity was questionable in some studies (e.g., [199, 200]). In 
addition  to  insomnia,  the  number  of  nights  with  night-
mares  and  the  total  number  of  nightmares  in  the  week 
prior  to  the  assessment  are  measured  using  the  Night-
mare  Frequency  Questionnaire  (NFQ;  [201]).  Based  on 
previous  research  among  posttraumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD) patients, the NFQ appears reliable for measuring 
nightmare frequency [201].

Well‑being  Well-being  is  measured  using  a  single  item 
measuring  happiness  [202]  and  the  Outcome  Rating 
Scale (ORS; [203]). The single item measures general hap-
piness in the months prior to the assessment on a seven 
point  Likert  scale.  Reliability  and  validity  were  good 
among  undergraduates  [202],  and  sensitivity  to  change 
was excellent in a BPD sample [184]. The ORS consists of 
four VAS items assessing four areas of functioning: indi-
vidual  (personal  well-being),  interpersonal  (family  and 
close relationships), social (work and/or school function-
ing), and overall (general sense of well-being). We slightly 
adapted  the  third  dimension  of  the  ORS  by  exclud-
ing  friendships,  because  of  its  overlap  with  the  second 
dimension  (interpersonal  functioning).  Hafkenscheid 
et al. [204] reported adequate psychometric properties of 
the ORS is a Dutch outpatient sample.

Statistical analyses

The statistical analyses for the (cost-)effectiveness, mech-
anisms  of  change  and  treatment  selection  studies  are 
under  development.  For  example,  according  to  Cohen 
et al. [48], the treatment selection field is still in its devel-
opmental  stage  and  statistical  methods  are  constantly 
evolving. Recently, great efforts have been made by sev-
eral  authors  (e.g.,  [205,  206])  to  select  the  optimal  pre-
diction  model  by  comparing  different  variable  selection 
techniques.  Considering  the  ongoing  advances  in  meth-
odological  approaches,  the  statistical  analyses  described 
below  should  be  considered  as  examples  of  appropriate 
analytic  methods.  We  will  determine  the  optimal  meth-
ods at the time of the analyses. An update of the proto-
col  will  be  published,  including  the  selected  statistical 
methods, before start of the data-analyses. The statistical 
analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-
treat (ITT) principle (i.e., including all patients that have 
been randomized and received at least one treatment ses-
sion).  In  addition  to  the  primary  analysis  based  on  the 
ITT  principle,  a  completers  analysis  will  be  conducted 
by excluding patients who dropped out prematurely (i.e., 
termination of the treatment before planned end, without 
patient and therapist agreeing that enough improvement 
has been reached to justify the termination) or deviated 
from the protocol (e.g., sought other psychological treat-
ment  in  addition  to  the  study  treatment).  No  interim 
analyses are planned.

Treatment selection

A  two-step  approach  will  be  applied  to  determine  the 
optimal treatment for a particular patient by identifying 
patient  characteristics  that  predict  (differential)  treat-
ment response. First, we will examine which of the can-
didate  predictors  (see  Additional  file  4  for  an  overview) 

predict  (differential)  treatment  response.  Many  differ-
ent  variable  selection  approaches  can  be  used  to  iden-
tify  which  of  the  candidate  predictors  contribute  to  the 
prediction  of  treatment  outcome,  for  example  elastic 
net  regularization  [207],  Bayesian  additive  regression 
trees [208], or a combination between different variables 
selection  procedures  [48].  Second,  individual  treatment 
recommendations  are  generated  based  on  a  prediction 
model  including  the  variables  that  predict  (differential) 
treatment  response.  For  each  patient,  the  most  benefi-
cial  treatment  will  be  identified  by  using  the  prediction 
model to estimate the predicted outcomes for both treat-
ments including the difference in predicted outcomes.

Our primary analysis will focus on individual treatment 
recommendations  based  on  change  in  BPD  manifesta-
tions and will therefore reveal the advantage in symptom 
relief that may be gained if patients are allocated to their 
predicted optimal treatment compared to their predicted 
non-optimal treatment. To investigate the advantage that 
may  be  gained  in  other  outcomes,  such  as  functioning 
and  cost-effectiveness,  generalization  analyses  will  be 
performed  by  testing  the  performance  of  the  prediction 
model for these outcomes.

Mechanisms of change

It  is  hypothesized  that  the  treatments  exert  a  remedial 
effect  on  the  frequency  and  severity  of  BPD  manifesta-
tions by their impact on the BPD-treatment-specific (ST: 
beliefs and schema modes; DBT: emotion regulation and 
skills  use),  BPD-treatment-generic  (therapeutic  environ-
ment characterized by genuineness, safety, and equality), 
and  non-specific  (attachment  and  therapeutic  alliance) 
mechanisms  of  change.  Since  potential  mediators  and 
outcome  will  be  assessed  multiple  times,  temporal  pat-
terns  of  change  can  be  studied  by  performing  media-
tion analysis for longitudinal data, for example multilevel 
autoregressive  mediation  analysis  [209]  or  multilevel 
structural  equation  modeling  [210].  By  using  advanced 
statistical  models,  the  hierarchical  structure  of  the  data 
(repeated  measures  nested  within  patients,  who  in  turn 
are  nested  within  centers)  can  be  taken  into  account 
and possible concurrent and temporal relations between 
mediators and outcome can be investigated.

Clinical effectiveness

Change  in  the  outcome  measures  and  the  relative  effec-
tiveness of the two treatment conditions will be analyzed 
using mixed regression so that all available data are used, 
and taking into account the dependencies among obser-
vations  nested  within  individuals  nested  within  cent-
ers.  Potential  center  effects  are  modeled  by  including  a 
random  effect  which  enables  generalization  of  results 
outside  the  trial  and  maximizes  statistical  power  [211]. 

 Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89 

Page 18 of 28

Since group sessions in both treatments are offered in a 
semi-open  format,  patients  will  start  with  group  treat-
ment  at  different  time  points.  One  can  imagine  that 
patients  starting  treatment  at  the  same  time  point  are 
more interdependent compared to patients starting treat-
ment at different time points. Therefore, we will take into 
account, if needed, the interdependency of patients. The 
underlying distributions of the mixed regression models 
will be determined based on the variable type (i.e., scale 
or  nominal)  and  the  distribution  of  residuals  (e.g.,  nor-
mal, gamma, negative binomial).

Cost‑effectiveness

The cost-effectiveness evaluation will be performed from 
a  societal  perspective  and  includes  a  cost-effectiveness 
analysis  (CEA)  and  cost-utility  analysis  (CUA).  The  pri-
mary  clinical  outcome  for  the  CEA  will  be  the  severity 
of the BPD manifestations and for the CUA utility scores 
will  be  derived  from  the  quality  of  life  instrument(s), 
both  with  a  time  horizon  of  12 months  after  the  end  of 
treatment.  The  net  benefit  will  be  used  to  express  cost-
effectiveness. For each patient, the net benefit will be cal-
culated  by  subtracting  the  costs  incurred  by  the  patient 
from the amount that the society is willing to pay for the 
health  benefit  [212].  The  development  of  the  net  ben-
efit  over  time  and  differences  between  the  treatments 
will  be  modeled  using  multilevel  modeling  in  which  the 
hierarchical  structure  of  the  data  and  potential  missing 
values  are  taken  into  account.  The  best  fitting  model  to 
describe  the  development  over  time  and  the  appropri-
ate distribution of the net benefit data (e.g., gamma dis-
tribution,  log-normal  distribution)  will  be  based  on  the 
data.  Cost-effectiveness  acceptability  curves  (CEACs) 
will be drawn showing the probability that one treatment 
is  more  cost-effective  compared  to  the  other  treatment, 
given the observed data, for a range of willingness-to-pay 
values. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to address 
the  uncertainties  in  methodology  and  assumptions  and 
to test for the robustness of findings.

Additional substudies

Several  secondary  studies  will  be  conducted,  including, 
but  not  limited  to,  the  investigation  of  the  heterogene-
ity  of  BPD  and  substance  abuse  among  BPD  patients,  a 
qualitative  study  into  the  perspectives  of  patients  and 
therapists,  and  psychometric  evaluations.  First,  BPD  is 
characterized  by  considerable  heterogeneity  [165,  213]. 
Over the past years, researchers have attempted to iden-
tify  BPD  subtypes  based  on  different  indicator  variables 
(e.g.,  DSM-5  criteria,  interpersonal  characteristics,  tem-
perament) and different statistical strategies (e.g., explor-
atory  factor  analysis,  Q-factor  analysis,  finite  mixture 
modeling) [214]. The BPD subtypes that emerged differed 

substantially between studies. According to Hallquist and 
Pilkonis [214], advances in classifying BPD subtypes can 
be  made  by  using  a  theoretical  model  as  guidance,  for 
example  Kernberg’s  theory  [215].  Therefore,  a  substudy 
into  the  heterogeneity  of  BPD  will  be  performed  based 
on  theoretically  justified  indicators  and  state-of-the-art 
statistical methods.

A  second  substudy  will  focus  on  the  co-occurrence 
of  substance  abuse  and  BPD.  Research  suggests  that 
patients with BPD and substance abuse have more severe 
problems,  including  higher  rates  of  suicide  attempts, 
more  treatment  noncompliance,  and  increased  risk  of 
violence,  compared  to  BPD  patients  without  substance 
abuse (e.g., [216–218]). However, few trials have assessed 
the effectiveness of treatments for BPD patients with sub-
stance abuse. In addition, research into the effect of BPD 
treatment on substance abuse is also limited [219]. Third, 
qualitative research will be conducted to explore the per-
spectives of patients and therapists in key areas, includ-
ing  predictors,  mechanisms  of  change,  the  treatments, 
and  the  implementation  of  the  results  in  clinical  prac-
tice.  Finally,  psychometric  evaluations  of  several  Dutch 
questionnaires  (e.g.,  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy-Ways 
of  Coping  Checklist,  Ultrashort  BPD  Checklist)  will  be 
performed.

Discussion
This article described the study protocol of a multicenter 
RCT focusing on the (differential) treatment effectiveness 
of DBT and ST for patients with BPD. The primary aim of 
the  study  is  to  improve  treatment  outcome  of  DBT  and 
ST  for  BPD  patients  by  optimizing  treatment  selection 
through  identifying  patient  characteristics  that  specify 
which  patients  will  benefit  most  from  which  treatment. 
In addition, we aim to elucidate the change mechanisms 
of DBT and ST, which is crucial for improving treatments 
and, in turn, treatment response [51, 52, 220]. Finally, the 
comparative  effectiveness  and  cost-effectiveness  of  DBT 
and ST will be compared.

This  trial  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  gain  more 
insight  into  one  of  the  main  questions  dominating  the 
psychotherapy research agenda: “What works for whom 
and why?”. Although DBT and ST share some important 
characteristics, different interventions related to different 
assumed core deficits in BPD are provided [58]. As each 
treatment  provides  a  different  therapeutic  milieu  and 
focuses  on  different  goals  and  tasks,  a  particular  treat-
ment may be a better fit with some patients compared to 
others  [45].  In  this  study,  patient  characteristics  of  (dif-
ferential) treatment response will be identified and indi-
vidual  treatment  recommendations  (DBT  or  ST)  will  be 
generated. In addition, for each patient, an estimate will 
be provided of the potential advantage in symptom relief 

Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89 

Page 19 of 28

that might be gained in case the patient was allocated to 
his  or  her  indicated  treatment.  Moreover,  the  potential 
advantage  in  other  outcomes,  for  example  functioning 
and  cost-effectiveness,  will  also  be  estimated.  Knowing 
which  treatment  is  most  cost-effective  for  whom  may 
lead to more efficient allocation of healthcare resources, 
which  is  important,  as  the  current  healthcare  system  is 
characterized  by  constraints  in  resources  (e.g.,  people, 
time,  budget;  [221]).  However,  before  a  treatment  selec-
tion  procedure  can  be  implemented  in  clinical  practice, 
replication  and  external  validation  of  the  prediction 
model  is  needed.  Subsequently,  a  prospective  study  in 
which  the  patient  and  clinician  collaborate  in  select-
ing  the  optimal  treatment  (i.e.,  shared  decision  making; 
[222]),  guided  by  treatment  recommendations  based 
on the prediction model, should be conducted to evalu-
ate the advantage of a treatment selection procedure. By 
using a state-of-the-art approach, the results of the cur-
rent study can serve as the starting point for future stud-
ies into personalized medicine among BPD patients, and 
is therefore of great importance.

In  addition,  this  trial  provides  insight  into  the  com-
parative  (cost-)effectiveness  of  DBT  and  ST.  Although 
the  effectiveness  of  both  treatments  has  been  estab-
lished,  DBT  and  ST  have  not  been  directly  compared. 
Therefore,  and  because  outcome  measures  differ  sub-
stantially between studies on the effectiveness of DBT or 
ST,  hypotheses  concerning  the  differential  effectiveness 
can  hardly  be  formulated.  According  to  the  “Dodo  Bird 
effect” [223, 224], all evidence-based psychotherapies are 
equally  effective,  suggesting  that  DBT  and  ST  will  pro-
duce equivalent outcomes. However, a meta-analysis into 
the  comparative  effectiveness  of  evidence-based  treat-
ments for personality disorders demonstrated that some 
treatments  may  be  more  effective  than  others  [225].  In 
addition,  Fassbinder  et  al.  [226]  hypothesized  that  ST 
may  be  more  effective  than  DBT  in  reducing  psychiat-
ric comorbidity and improving quality of life, while DBT 
may lead to a better and faster reduction in self-harming 
and suicidal behaviors. Moreover, although not assessed 
in  direct  comparison  with  ST,  the  meta-analysis  of 
Storebø et al. [25] into psychological treatments for BPD 
indicated that DBT may be especially effective for BPD-
severity,  self-harm,  and  psychosocial  functioning.  They 
also  pointed  out  that  more  research  into  the  effects  of 
BPD-tailored  treatments,  including  head-to-head  com-
parisons, is needed. By focusing on an array of outcomes, 
this study will extend our knowledge on the potential dif-
ferential effects of DBT and ST.

This study has several strengths. First, this RCT is quite 
inclusive in terms of patient characteristics, and as such 
designed  to  reflect  clinical  practice  to  enhance  ecologi-
cal validity. Second, this trial is conducted by a research 

group  including  researchers  with  balanced  allegiance 
to  either  ST  or  DBT  and  an  independent  researcher 
(i.e.,  C.J.M.  Wibbelink),  to  prevent  the  potential  effect 
of  research  allegiance  on  treatment  outcomes  [227]. 
Third,  we  adopt  a  broad  view  on  treatment  response  by 
including outcome measures reflecting different areas of 
recovery  (e.g.,  BPD  symptoms,  functioning,  well-being). 
Focusing  on  outcomes  beyond  symptom  reduction  is 
in line with patients’ view on recovery [76, 77]. In addi-
tion,  it  follows  a  multi-method  assessment  approach,  as 
the  outcome  measures  include  both  self-report  ques-
tionnaires  and  semi-structured  interviews.  Fourth,  we 
include a large amount and broad range of patient char-
acteristics  potentially  predictive  of  (differential)  treat-
ment response across DBT and ST. Finally, the presumed 
mediators and outcomes will be frequently measured on 
multiple  time  points  during  the  treatments  and  media-
tion analyses will be performed by using state-of-the-art 
statistical analysis methods [228]. This allows us to estab-
lish concurrent as well as temporal relationships between 
the mediators and outcomes [228]. However, according to 
Lemmens  et  al.  [229],  understanding  psychotherapeutic 
change may be too challenging, even in optimal research 
designs. Psychotherapy consists of a complex interplay of 
multiple  mechanisms  on  different  levels.  Finding  that  a 
construct  (e.g.,  therapeutic  alliance)  mediates  treatment 
outcome does not explain how changes in this construct 
lead to changes in the outcome as it could involve several 
processes  (e.g.,  cognitions,  behaviors,  emotions,  neural 
systems) [63]. It is therefore highly questionable if these 
complex  processes  can  be  assessed  by  relatively  simple 
mediational models. As such, this is one of the potential 
limitations of the current study.

This study has several other limitations that should be 
considered when evaluating the results. First, as power is 
conventionally set a 80% [84, 230–232], we used a mini-
mum  criterion  of  80%  power  for  the  power  analyses. 
However,  this  means  that  we  accept  a  20%  chance  of  a 
false negative result. Second, since DBT and ST are both 
evidence-based  treatments  for  BPD,  differential  effects 
in  treatment  outcome  may  be  small  or  non-existing.  To 
demonstrate  equivalence  or  small  effects  between  treat-
ments, a very large sample size is needed. The sample size 
of  the  current  study  is  not  large  enough  (i.e.,  does  not 
have  ≥80%  power)  to  reliably  detect  a  small  differential 
treatment effect. However, the comparison of treatments 
is not the main aim of the study. In addition, according to 
Luedtke et al. [233], a sample size of at least 300 patients 
per  condition  is  required  to  have  sufficient  power  for 
applying  multivariable  prediction  models.  Nonetheless, 
they also noticed that a smaller sample size might be jus-
tified if studies are designed to develop prediction models 
that can be tested in future studies. Moreover, the results 

 Wibbelink et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:89 

Page 20 of 28

of this study can contribute to building a database includ-
ing trials on BPD that can be analyzed with meta-analytic 
techniques.

Second, this study does not include a no treatment con-
trol  group,  which  might  affect  internal  validity.  When 
improvements are found in both treatments, but no sig-
nificant differences between the treatments, the absence 
of a control group implies that it cannot be ruled out that 
non-specific  factors  such  as  attention  or  time  (matura-
tion)  caused  the  improvements.  However,  including  a 
control  group  receiving  no  treatment  would  clearly  be 
unethical (e.g., patients are at risk of suicide). For similar 
reasons, it is not possible to standardize medication use 
and  crisis  management  sessions.  Any  additional  treat-
ment or medication use will be monitored and included 
in the analyses.

Third,  one  of  the  treatment  elements  of  DBT  is  out 
of  office  hours  between-session  (telephone)  consulta-
tion by the individual therapist. The targets of telephone 
consultation include, among others, reducing self-harm 
and  suicidal  behavior  and  teaching  patients  how  to 
apply learned skills in everyday life in order to encour-
age skills generalization [19]. In the current study, some 
centers  provide  24/7  access  to  telephone  consultation 
by  the  patient’s  individual  therapist,  while  the  other 
centers provide telephone consultation within the limi-
tations  of  the  individual  therapists,  or  within  working 
hours.  In  case  of  emergency,  the  standard  emergency 
procedures  of  each  center  will  be  followed.  Although 
outside of office hours availability is considered to be an 
essential  element  of  DBT  by  some  authors  [113,  234], 
the  link  between  telephone  consultation  and  outcome 
in DBT has not been evaluated [95, 235]. There is some 
preliminary  support  for  the  importance  of  telephone 
consultation  [236].  However,  studies  into  the  effective-
ness  of  DBT  that  did  not  apply  24-h  telephone  consul-
tation  by  the  individual  therapist  have  found  positive 
outcomes (e.g., [235, 237]). Van den Bosch and Sinnaeve 
[238]  studied  treatment  programs  of  25  DBT  teams  in 
the Netherlands. They found that only 36% of the DBT 
teams  applied  telephone  consultation  according  to  the 
guidelines  of  DBT.  It  can  therefore  be  concluded  that 
the  current  study  is  a  good  reflection  of  clinical  prac-
tice,  which  enhances  generalizability  of  our  findings. 
Notwithstanding,  we  will  monitor  between-session 
(telephone)  consultation  within  centers  and  examine 
potential effects.

Fourth, in this study, a component of treatment integ-
rity  (treatment  adherence)  will  be  assessed,  which  is, 
surprisingly,  not  standard  procedure  in  trials  investigat-
ing  BPD  treatments  [25].  However,  treatment  integrity 
also constitutes of treatment differentiation and therapist 
competence  [110].  Treatment  adherence  and  treatment 

differentiation  are  closely  related,  in  contrast  to  treat-
ment  adherence  and  therapist  competence  [239].  Treat-
ment  adherence  represents  a  quantitative  aspect  of 
treatment  integrity  (i.e.,  how  frequently  a  therapist  uti-
lizes  prescribed  techniques  and  procedures  and  avoids 
proscribed  techniques  and  procedures),  while  compe-
tence  represents  a  qualitative  aspect  (i.e.,  how  well  pre-
scribed  techniques  and  procedures  are  implemented) 
[109].  Adherence  does  not  necessary  presuppose  com-
petence;  even  with  adequate  adherence,  therapists  may 
deliver  the  treatment  in  an  incompetent  manner.  The 
absence  of  competence  ratings  may  threaten  the  valid-
ity  of  our  results  [109].  Moreover,  treatment  adherence 
will  be  assessed  by  trained  master  psychology  students, 
whereas  for  DBT,  adherence  ratings  by  reliably  trained 
therapists  are  considered  the  gold  standard  [240,  241]. 
However,  students  will  receive  a  training  from  experi-
enced therapists.

Fifth, it is a subject of some debate whether the EQ-5D 
is  a  valid  instrument  to  measure  quality  of  life  in  BPD 
patients,  which  can  affect  the  economic  evaluation  [81]. 
According to Brazier [242], the EQ-5D might not meas-
ure  what  matters  to  patients  with  psychiatric  disorders. 
In  addition,  in  a  cost-effectiveness  study  among  BPD 
patients, van Asselt et al. [79] found contradictory results 
on  the  incremental  risk  ratios  when  recovery  was  based 
on  the  EQ-5D  compared  to  the  BPDSI-IV.  In  contrast, 
adequate  responsiveness  of  the  EQ-5D  has  been  found 
in a BPD sample [243]. In addition, Soeteman et al. [244] 
concluded that the EQ-5D is sensitive to changes in the 
health  status  of  patients  with  cluster  B  personality  dis-
orders.  In  addition  to  the  EQ-5D,  quality  of  life  will  be 
assessed  by  a  recently  developed  instrument  specially 
developed  for  patients  with  mental  health  problems 
(MHQoL-7D;  [197]).  The  validation  of  this  instrument 
is  currently  in  progress,  but  preliminary  results  are 
promising [197]. Another point for consideration is that 
conclusions with regard to the most cost-effective treat-
ment  choice  can  be  affected  by  the  amount  the  society 
is  willing  to  pay  for  an  additional  unit  of  effectiveness 
(i.e., willingness-to-pay threshold). Soeteman et al. [244] 
concluded  that  outpatient  psychotherapy  for  cluster  B 
personality  disorder  patients  is  the  optimal  treatment 
choice  in  case  society  is  not  willing  to  pay  more  than 
€12.274;  otherwise,  day  hospital  psychotherapy  was  the 
optimal treatment choice. To date, there is no consensus 
about reasonable willingness-to-pay thresholds, although 
guidelines  have  been  proposed  by  the  Dutch  healthcare 
authority  [245].  We  will  therefore  calculate  the  prob-
ability of each treatment being cost-effective for different 
willingness-to-pay values. As a result, the optimal treat-
ment choice can be different for different willingness-to-
pay values.

Finally,  this  study  is  conducted  during  the  COVID-
19  pandemic.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  significant 
disrupted  effects  on  society  and  is  related  to  increased 
burden  of  mental  health  among  individuals  with  mental 
disorders  [246,  247].  Moreover,  some  authors  suggest 
that  patients  with  severe  psychopathology,  including 
BPD, may be especially at risk for symptom deterioration 
[247,  248].  In  addition,  some  patients  will  temporarily 
receive  treatment  via  videoconferencing  in  case  face-to-
face treatment is restricted in mental healthcare centers. 
Research  on  the  effectiveness  of  online  individual  psy-
chotherapy  has  found  positive  effects  for  several  mental 
health disorders, including PTSD [249], anxiety disorders 
[250],  and  depression  [251].  However,  research  on  the 
effectiveness of online group psychotherapy is scarce [95, 
252]. Consequently, we will control for a potential effect 
of the COVID-19 pandemic in the analyses.

Conclusion
Specialized  evidence-based  treatments  have  been  devel-
oped  and  evaluated  for  BPD,  including  DBT  and  ST. 
However,  BPD  patients  vary  widely  in  their  response  to 
treatment, and poor response to one treatment does not 
imply poor response to another treatment. The selection 
of the optimal treatment for a particular patient is a daily 
task of the clinician, but very scant evidence is available to 
guide  these  decisions.  This  study  will  extend  our  knowl-
edge on one of the main issues in psychotherapy research; 
understanding for whom a treatment works and how. As 
such, this study helps pave the way for an evidence-based 
personalized medicine for patients with BPD.
