BF irst, do no harm^ is an oft-quoted adage regarding

physicians’ obligation to help patients in ways that
do not end up making things worse. Should not the same
principle apply to organizational leaders attempting to im-
prove health care delivery systems? What if transformation
initiatives designed to improve patient care create additional
stress that negatively impacts the work experience and thereby
ends up degrading patient care? Such questions are frequently
asked by both leaders and front-line participants of organiza-
tions encountering increased pressure to transform health care
delivery to reduce costs and improve care.

A pervasive indicator of ongoing stress for physicians and
other health care professionals is burnout, which encompasses
feelings of exhaustion, and is experienced by 30 to 50% of
practicing physicians.1 Specific components of burnout in-
clude emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a de-
creased sense of personal accomplishment. These negative
feelings have important organizational consequences, includ-
ing provider turnover and worse patient outcomes.2 Improving
the physician work experience by reducing negative feelings
such as burnout seems a worthy pursuit in and of itself. Indeed,
assuring a positive provider work experience has been pro-
posed as the quadruple aim in health care; along with the triple
aim of enhancing patient experience, improving population
health, and reducing costs.3 Given that burnout often accom-
panies feelings of having too much to do and being pulled in
multiple different directions, it seems at least plausible that
extra work created by well-intended transformation initiatives
designed to make things better for both patients and health
care providers may actually have the unintended consequence
of making things worse.

In this issue, the study BThe Effects of a Primary Care
Transformation Initiative on Primary Care Physician Burnout
and Workplace Experience^ by Peikes and colleagues exam-
ines the effect of participation in a large-scale health care
transformation initiative—the Comprehensive Primary Care
(CPC) program—on the physician work experience, with an
emphasis on burnout.4 CPC is a multi-payer primary care

transformation initiative instituted by Medicare from October
2012 through December 2016. CPC specifically required care
delivery changes and provided enhanced payment, data feed-
back, and learning support. The authors obtained survey
responses from over 1000 physicians, and compared
responses from those participating in the CPC practices to a
matched group of others not participating in the CPC program.
Although a high percentage of physicians reported feeling
burned out, there was no evidence that responses from those
involved in the CPC initiative differed meaningfully from
responses provided by the control group.

There are several possible explanations why the current
study did not identify differences in burnout related to partic-
ipation in the CPC. Perhaps the most plausible reason is that
the transformation initiative was simply not designed to de-
crease burnout as a primary outcome. Specifically, three areas
have been consistently associated with burnout: loss of auton-
omy and low perceived control, lack of meaning in work, and
working in inefficient systems with excessive workload.5 Oth-
er drivers of burnout include a high burden of responsibility,
discordance between individual and organizational values,
unsupportive work environments, and isolation.6 Although
CPC did not focus specifically on any of these critical ele-
ments, practice facilitation potentially improved the work
environment along some of these lines. At the same time, the
CPC intervention certainly created the need for organizational
change and thereby likely at least temporarily decreased feel-
ings of control and inefficiency. Perhaps these competing
pressures simply acted as offsets, resulting in little or no
difference in the work environment of health care providers.
From the optimist perspective, it is good to see that physician
burnout was not higher in CPC practices compared to other
practices. Overall, the results of this study add to the growing
body of knowledge making it clear that a considerable number of
physicians feel burned out, and that transforming health care
delivery in ways that improve working conditions and health
outcomes is challenging. Although early evaluations of transfor-
mation initiatives such as the medical home model and team-
based approaches to care delivery found some evidence of de-
creased burnout,7 data since then has been mixed and little
support has been garnered for transformation initiatives that
universally decrease physician burnout.

Even interventions designed specifically to decrease burn-
out are often linked only to moderate improvement.8 Most
studies of burnout suggest that both an individual and

organization-level approach are needed.9 A recent meta-
analysis of burnout intervention found that few interventions
focused specifically on primary care practice, and that inter-
ventions which focused more on organizational-directed, as
opposed to physician-directed, were most effective.8 It may
not be the content of the transformation intervention itself that
matters but rather the effectiveness with which the transfor-
mation is implemented. In other words, simply engaging or
not engaging in a transformation initiative may have little
impact on perceptions such as burnout; however, the way that
the initiative is carried out may make all the difference.

Our own work evaluating the effectiveness of a large-scale
health care delivery transformation in Veterans Health Admin-
istration has led us to identify specific aspects of how a
transformation is implemented that significantly impact the
work experiences of front-line physicians and other employ-
ees.10 Our work also points to the high rates of burnout in
clinical staff in addition to physicians, including nurse practi-
tioners, nurses and clerical staff. Yet, burnout is reduced under
three conditions: guidance by supportive leadership, provision
of adequate resources, and facilitation of effective team-
work.10, 11 Supportive leaders ensure open communication
and engage front-line providers and other staff in transforma-
tion initiatives by integrating new practices with ongoing
clinic procedures. One of the most critical resource these
leaders provide is adequate staff that helps assure those carry-
ing out the transformation are not overburdened by the need
not only to provide care to patients but also to learn new skills
and implement change. Developing stable teams that work
together and support one another to share the burdens of
implementing change also helps reduce individual stress and
change fatigue. In short, successful implementation of a trans-
formation initiative requires significant time and effort, and
those charged with carrying out changes experience stress and
burnout when new burdens are added to ongoing duties with-
out additional time and resources to learn and enact new
behaviors. Thus, organizations need to consider the work
experience of physicians and other primary care team mem-
bers as they seek to transform health care delivery. When

effects on the well-being and engagement of healthcare work-
ers are not taken into account, a likely result is frustration and
quite possibly an initiative that ends up making things worse.
