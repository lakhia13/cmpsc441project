health care – a scoping review of international 
best-practice strategies and service models

Abstract
Background  Psychiatric disorders are among the most common health problems in children and adolescents, with 
a recent prevalence rise due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing demand for service provision in this patient 
population, together with infrastructural, financial and staff limitations in child and adolescent mental health services, 
calls for an adaptation/advancement of current models of service provision. This review offers an internationally 
informed overview of best-practice child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) strategies and care models, with the 
aim of assisting decision-makers in implementing topical CAMH care models.

Methods  Using a pre-defined structured search strategy, we aimed to identify core topics within published CAMH 
strategies and care model documents from seven countries within the Global North, which represented a range of 
differing healthcare systems, geographical regions, and public health traditions. From the retrieved documents, we 
then systematically extracted data in an iterative process, and summarised these narratively by applying qualitative 
content analyses.

Results  Our search retrieved the following key components of CAMH strategies: awareness-raising activities, 
prevention/promotion, detection, treatment, telemedicine, care pathways, transitional psychiatry, vulnerable patient 
groups, user participation, infrastructure, workforce development, implementation, digital case management tools, 
and data acquisition/research. Recommendations for CAMH care organisation often followed a public mental 
health approach, with a focus on mental health promotion, cross-sectional organisation, and funding of CAMH care 
services. As key principles of best-practice CAMH care models, we identified increased flexibility of care settings, early 
intervention, and a strengths-oriented approach, with overarching mental health services research alongside.

Conclusion  In order to design robust models of CAMH care and to mitigate current shortcomings, actions on the 
policy level (e.g., CAMH strategy development with a focus on mental health promotion, installation of cross-sectoral 
governance), at the organisational level (e.g., re-organisation of treatment settings and pathways of care) and at the 
individual level (e.g., user involvement, workforce development) are recommended. To this purpose, we strongly 
advocate the use of cross-sectoral and participatory approaches for CAMH care structures with accompanying health 
services research.

Central message

 • Cross-sectoral, participatory approaches, which focus on the educational sector as well as on prevention 

and workforce development strategies, have a great potential to improve the mental health of children and 
adolescents.

Keywords  Child and adolescent mental health, Child health services, Adolescent health services, National strategies, 
Prevention and care models, Child and adolescent psychiatry, Mental health services, Child and adolescent mental 
health services, School mental health services

Background
Mental disorders are one of the most common conditions 
among children and adolescents worldwide, with a preva-
lence between 9 and 22% [1]. The mental health of chil-
dren  and  adolescents  was  further  affected  substantially 
by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  with  a  significant  reduc-
tion  in  health-related  quality  of  life  and  a  greater  extent 
of depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress reactions [2]. 
The  increasing  need  for  care  in  this  group  of  patients, 
with  concurrent  staffing  and  infrastructural  limitations 
in child and adolescent psychiatric care, leads to consid-
erations  to  adapt  current  models  of  care  provision  and 
delivery.

In this study, we aim to provide an overview of interna-
tional  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  (CAMH)  care 
strategies and models (e.g., identifying  elements of care, 
coordination,  professional  groups  involved,  compre-
hensive mental health strategy). Mental health care may 
include  prevention,  treatment,  rehabilitation,  diagnostic 
services, and other types of support. Effectiveness analy-
ses  of  individual  care  components,  or  an  assessment  to 
what  extent  recommendations  are  already  implemented 
in  different  countries,  are  not  within  this  paper’s  scope. 
Our  results  should  support  decision-making  in  the  fur-
ther development of CAMH care structures.

Methods
Literature search of national strategies

Between April and June 2022, we conducted a structured 
hand  search  for  national  strategies  and  models  address-
ing  CAMH  care  and  prevention  in  the  following  online 
resources  and  databases:  websites  of  national  ministries 
of health, websites of national public health institutions, 
Google  (Scholar),  World  Health  Organization  MiND-
bank [3], Europe encyclopedia of National Youth Policies 
YouthWiki [4]. For the literature search, various keywords 
relating  to  CAMH  were  combined  with  the  respective 
country as well as with relevant keywords such as strat-
egy, model, care pathway, prevention.

Selection of countries and national strategies

For  this  scoping  review,  we  tried  to  capture  a  broad 
variety  of  CAMH  care  strategies  and  models.  We 
tried  to  achieve  this  by  aiming  for  at  least  one  country 

representing each European region (according to the UN 
Geoscheme  for  Europe  [5])  and  by  representing  coun-
tries with different health care systems and public health 
traditions. At the same time, we took into account trans-
ferability  of  the  findings  to  the  Austrian  system  (ratio-
nale:  the  original  results  were  of  particular  interest  for 
Austrian  decision  makers).  This  was  done  by  restricting 
countries  to  those  from  the  Global  North  and  within 
them, selecting countries with the highest Human Devel-
opment  Index  (HDI),  2020  report  [6].  Considering  this 
transferability,  we  excluded  Asian  countries  due  to  the 
differences  in  health  care  systems  and  societal  culture. 
Further,  only  countries  who  had  documents  available  in 
English  or  German  language  and  with  a  minimum  pop-
ulation  size  of  5  million  inhabitants  were  considered. 
This combination of criteria led to a set of six countries: 
Australia,  Switzerland,  Czechia,  Spain,  Norway,  and  the 
United  Kingdom.  In  addition,  Germany  was  included 
due to its proximity to Austria and high comparability of 
the  health  systems. The  final  set  of  selected  countries  is 
depicted in Fig. 1. Regarding the selection of documents 
within countries, the primary sources were national doc-
uments. If no national document was available, a limited 
number of regional documents were included. It was not 
the aim of our review to present a comprehensive country 
overview in quantitative terms (e.g., describing frequen-
cies of certain characteristics of CAMH care models) but 
rather to capture the diversity and types of concepts.

Document selection, data extraction and analysis of 
national strategies

From  the  literature  search,  we  identified  128  national 
references. From these, we included national documents 
that  describe  a  strategy  or  model  of  care  specific  for 
CAMH. In case no such specific document was available, 
we  included  a  general  mental  health  strategy  or  model 
that  has  a  subchapter  for  children  and  adolescents.  We 
excluded  documents  that  were  indication  specific  (e.g., 
depression,  substance  abuse,  suicide).  Further  exclusion 
reasons  were  evaluation  documents,  surveys,  situational 
analyses, or information campaigns.

We  then  prepared  data  extraction  tables  (available 
upon request) for each of the selected documents, decid-
ing  iteratively  which  information  to  extract.  This  pro-
cess  resulted  in  14  topic  areas  for  which  we  extracted

information from the documents: information activities, 
prevention/promotion,  detection,  treatment,  telemedi-
cine,  care  pathways,  transitional  psychiatry,  vulnerable 
patient  groups,  user  participation,  infrastructure,  work-
force development, implementation, digital tools for case 
management,  and  data  acquisition/research.  If  avail-
able, we also extracted the documents’ key principles as 
well as conclusion sections. After all 14 topic areas were 
extracted  from  the  documents,  we  reached  our  conclu-
sion to the strategies by reviewing the findings and iden-
tifying patterns through qualitative content analyses.

For quality assessment of the included documents, we 
used an adapted version of the Appraisal of Guidelines for 
Research & Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument [7]. This 
tool  was  used  to  assess  six  domains:  scope  &  purpose, 
stakeholder  involvement,  rigor  of  development,  clar-
ity  of  presentation,  applicability,  and  editorial  indepen-
dence. The  process  steps  of  quality  assessment  and  data 
extraction  were  carried  out  by  one  researcher  (RJ)  and 
controlled by a second researcher (VH). In the process of 
adapting the preliminary categories for data extraction, a 
third researcher (IZ) was consulted for advice.

Results
Included national strategies

We  included  twelve  relevant  documents  [8–19]  from 
seven  countries,  published  between  2013  and  2022,  for 

our  analysis  of  CAMH  strategies  and  models.  Table  1 
gives  an  overview  of  included  documents  per  selected 
countries.

Key principles

All  included  documents  stated  key  principles  on  which 
CAMH  services  should  be  based.  While  these  varied 
broadly across countries, most often mentioned key prin-
ciples  were  to  increase  the  focus  on  prevention,  early 
improve 
detection/intervention  (including  efforts  to 
mental  health  literacy),  improved  coordination  and  that 
CAMH services should be evidence-based including the 
need  for  more  mental  health  services  research.  Addi-
tional key principles were to strengthen participation, to 
take special treatment needs into account, and to estab-
lish  low-threshold  services  that  are  culturally  sensitive 
and needs-based.

The  general  style  of  the  documents  differed  in  some 
regards.  While  some  documents  were  rather  strategic 
(Czechia,  Germany,  Spain),  others  were  describing  con-
crete  models  (Australia,  Norway,  United  Kingdom)  or 
a  combination  of  both  (Switzerland).  Some  documents 
explicitly provided an evidence base for each recommen-
dation  (e.g.,  Czechia,  Norway),  while  others  gave  more 
jurisdictional context (Switzerland, Germany). One doc-
ument  in  particular  followed  a  thorough  participatory 
approach, with the foreword of the document directed at

Topic areas in included documents

The  majority,  but  not  all  of  the  14  topic  areas  were 
described in each of the included documents. The docu-
ment from Czechia addressed the fewest number of topic 
areas,  while  Australia  and  Spain  were  the  only  coun-
tries  addressing  all  topic  areas.  Table  2  gives  an  over-
view  which  topic  areas  were  described  in  the  included 
documents.

Information activities, prevention/promotion, detection

All  countries  recommend  information  and  awareness 
raising  activities  to  increase  health  literacy  and  reduce 
stigma.  Several  distribution  channels  (traditional  and 
social  media),  targeting  children,  adolescents,  car-
ers,  and  less  often  professionals,  are  recommended.  For 

strengthening  mental  health  promotion  and  illness  pre-
vention,  the  focus  is  on  increasing  early  help-seeking, 
and improving interpersonal relationships (e.g., reducing 
violence  and  improving  respectfulness).  One  key  target 
group  of  these  activities  are  parents  with  a  mental  ill-
ness,  as  there  is  rising  awareness  of  the  negative  impact 
parental mental illness can have on children. One recom-
mendation  in  this  area  is  to  introduce  specialised  pro-
grammes aimed at developing parenting skills, especially 
for families under psychosocial stress, in order to reduce 
the  risk  of  traumatisation  of  children.  Another  recom-
mendation is to increase care for these affected families, 
to counteract the existing disadvantages. The key setting 
of promotion and prevention activities is within schools. 
Similarly,  the  recommended  core  setting  for  screening 
and early detection in the documents is the school envi-
ronment,  involving  different  professionals  (e.g.,  school 
health nurses).

Treatment, telemedicine, care pathways, transitional 
psychiatry

Vulnerable patient groups, user participation, 
infrastructure

Regarding treatment, the necessity to broaden the range 
of settings is highlighted, ranging from home-treatment, 
treatment  and  other  outreach 
inpatient-equivalent 
approaches,  to  inpatient  treatment.  To  allow  family-
focused  care,  alternatives  to  hospital  care  are  described 
as  important.  As  for  medication,  the  need  to  improve 
safety by installing measures to reduce the wide off-label 
use is emphasised. Suggestions on the mode of care deliv-
ery  include  telehealth  and  face-to-face  approaches  in 
single- and/or group settings. The increased use of digital 
applications  is  mainly  recommended  for  detection,  self-
care, and better system navigation. Australia has defined 
the  expansion  of  telehealth  tools  as  a  priority  activity, 
however,  with  funding  extensive  evaluation  research 
alongside.

Suggestions on care pathways and integrated care play 
a  prominent  role  aiming  at  integrating  services  across 
different  sectors,  such  as  health  and  education.  A  key 
suggestion  is  to  establish  a  single  point  of  access  and  to 
provide a coordinator for each patient/family. The path-
ways to access hospital care should be clearly defined and 
linked  to  quality  indicators  monitoring  waiting  times  or 
“no  shows”.  The  care  pathways  are  recommended  to  be 
in  line  with  the  different  developmental  stages  through-
out  child  and  adolescence,  e.g.,  which  service  networks 
and interventions are required at each stage of develop-
ment. For better management of transitional phases (e.g., 
when entering schools, or from adolescent to adult psy-
chiatry), a shared recommendation is to move away from 
age  thresholds  to  needs-based  transitions  depending  on 
developmental stages, including extending ages for tran-
sition into adult mental health care up to 25 years.

A  broad  number  of  especially  vulnerable  groups,  at 
greater  risk  for  developing  a  mental  illness  and  often 
requiring complex care arrangements, have been identi-
fied  across  all  documents.  These  include  culturally  and 
linguistically diverse groups. Measures to better and rou-
tinely detect circumstances that make a child vulnerable 
and  installing  a  lead  professional  for  case  management 
(shifting  the  responsibility  for  coordination  from  the 
family  to  the  professionals)  are  recommended.  Further, 
an  additional  re-distributing  of  resources  to  better  care 
for  these  vulnerable  children  and  adolescents  are  sug-
gested. These resources are recommended to cover inter-
preter  services,  additional  time,  personnel,  and  material 
resources,  developing  social  and  emotional  wellbeing 
services  for  diverse  populations,  and  appropriate  refer-
rals  to  specialist  mental  health  services.  Another  topic 
described  across  most  documents  is  strengthened  user 
participation.  The  aim  is  to  provide  more  tailored  care 
and better navigation in care pathways, by involving users 
in both individual care planning but also in the systemic 
design processes of the services.

Regarding  infrastructure  and  resources,  the  countries 
recommend infrastructure to be accessible and culturally 
safe. For financing, an increase in budget is required for 
interprofessional  collaboration,  psychotherapy  and  psy-
choeducational  programmes,  and  for  policies  aimed  at 
preventing inequality in youth. Examples are ring-fenced 
budgets jointly provided by the health, social and educa-
tional ministry. Additionally, new reimbursement mecha-
nisms for providers are suggested to fund a combination 
of outpatient services for children with complex needs.

Workforce development, implementation, digital tools, 
data acquisition/research

The  workforce  qualification  and  professional  develop-
ment  is  another  topic  area  described  across  most  docu-
ments. Most countries suggest broadening the traditional 
health  workforce  with  additional  workers  (e.g.,  allied 
health  specialists,  family  therapists,  diverse  and  LGB-
TIQ + health  workers,  peer  support  workers).  A  specific 
highlight is put on developing the competences of school 
teaching  staff  (led  by  mental  health  specialists),  as  well 
as implementing a designated wellbeing staff member in 
all schools. For the implementation strategy and process, 
some  countries  created  inter-ministerial/cross-sectional 
committees, with individual responsibilities from manag-
ers of health centers, school health services and munici-
palities.  To  guide  implementation,  it  is  recommended 
to  identify  what  is  working  in  some  regions  and  rolling 
it out to the whole country, with phases of implementa-
tion described as an establishment phase, an embedding 
phase, and a full operational phase.

Almost all countries recommend increasing data acqui-
sition  and  research  with  the  aim  of  monitoring  changes 
in  mental  disorder  prevalence  and  effects  of  interven-
tions. A broad range of specific research topics and study 
designs  are  listed,  including  (cross-sectoral)  mental 
health  service  research  allowing  benchmarking  of  ser-
vices  (e.g.,  waiting  times  and  user  satisfaction).  Several 
countries  are  in  the  process  of  implementing  national 
mental  health  services  datasets  for  data  acquisition  and 

sharing  across  relevant  sectors.  Most  countries  further 
suggest increasing the availability of digital tools for case 
management  (e.g.,  tools  to  facilitate  clinical  decision 
making  and  cross-sector  video  conferences)  and  docu-
mentation  (e.g.,  continued  development  of  trans-organ-
isational electronic patient record systems).

Establishing a child and adolescent mental health strategy

Drawing inspiration from the recommendations in inter-
national  CAMH  strategies  and  models,  the  following 
Fig. 2 may serve as a starting point for health policy dis-
cussions  on  establishing  and  further  adapting  a  stand-
alone  CAMH  strategy.  In  this  guiding  principle,  the 
importance of a participatory design approach is empha-
sised.  Further,  health  services  research  plays  a  central 
role for the depicted components (current status analysis, 
development of a mental health strategy, operationalisa-
tion, implementation, and evaluation).

Quality assessment

The  assessment  of  the  overall  quality  of  the  documents 
ranged  from  62  to  95%.  Reasons  for  lower  ratings  were, 
among  others:  the  views  and  preferences  of  the  target 
population were not always included, the target users of 
the  documents  were  not  always  clearly  defined,  and  no 
application of systematic methods to search for evidence, 
and  the  recommendations  were  not  always  explicitly 
linked to supporting evidence (see Table 3).

Discussion
Main findings

We found that all countries included in this report advo-
cate a public mental health approach that is characterised 
by  encouraging  mental  health  promotion  and  preven-
tion. For this aim, the educational sector is essential and 
should  be  supported  with  additional  staff  and  men-
tal  health  training  for  educators.  In  this  cross-sectoral 
approach,  in  terms  of  professionals  involved  and  their 
responsibilities,  CAMH  is  shifting  from  a  psychiatry-
focused  (more  medical-oriented)  model  to  multi-pro-
fessional  teams  with  shared  responsibility  and  equal 
contributions from different professional groups.

Interpretation

Mental health policies are a logical first step in recognis-
ing  need  for  care  and  prevention,  and  subsequent  pro-
gramme development. Mental health policies are guides 
for actions, such as programme development, financing, 
and access to care [20]. In this context, all the countries 
selected  for  our  analysis  have  a  general  mental  health 
strategy and, in the majority, additionally a CAMH strat-
egy and a suicide prevention strategy exists. For adopting 
CAMH services, the documents suggest that prevention 
and  care  should  be  based  on  the  needs  of  children  and 
their families, rather than on the existing care structures. 
This  needs-based  approach  increases  the  relevance  of 
user  participation  and  involvement,  focusing  on  spe-
cial support for vulnerable groups, and through creating 
structures  within  CAMH  services  that  promote  coor-
dination  of  services  according  to  individual  needs  (e.g., 
single points of access, coordinators for improved system 
navigation).

Based on the recommendations from the national doc-
uments,  a  CAMH  strategy  with  a  common  vision  and 
shared goals, integrating mental health promotion, illness 
prevention  and  mental  health  care  across  relevant  sec-
tors (health, social care, education, and criminal justice) 
is  advisable.  In  particular,  strengthening  the  outpatient 
area  (e.g.,  home-treatment  services)  to  overcome  hospi-
tal bed and psychiatrist shortage, as well as informal care 
offers  in  flexible  settings  with  improved  care  pathways 
is  essential.  This  extension  would  also  be  more  in  line 
with the optimal mix of mental health services as recom-
mended  by  the  World  Health  Organization.  A  CAMH 
strategy  needs  to  be  linked  with  other  existing  strate-
gies (e.g. child and adolescent health strategy). An aspect 
that was barely mentioned in the included documents is 
the  role  of  perinatal  and  infant  mental  health.  However, 
when designing a CAMH service, insights from perinatal 
and  infant  mental  health  care  models  and  pathways  can 
inform  care  models  in  the  older  ages  [21]. The  need  for 
increased  focus  on  vulnerable  patient  groups  becomes 
evident when considering recent research findings, such

as  the  multinational  EU-GEI  study.  In  this  study,  social 
vulnerability due to migration (and post-migration expe-
riences) was associated with double the odds of psychosis 
in first-generation migrants [22]. An ideal CAMH service 
addresses the issues of culturally and linguistically diverse 
groups,  by  putting  increased  focus  on  these  vulnerable 
patient  groups.  Interpretation  services  are  important, 
but  additional  measures  addressing  this  patient  group 
are  also  required.  These  include  promoting  respect  and 
reducing  stigma  towards  social  minority  groups,  and 
increasing  adolescents’  empathy  and  tolerance  towards 
what is different and diverse. For this purpose, measures 
are  called  for  to  reduce  inequalities,  such  as  redistribu-
tion of existing therapeutic resources towards psychoso-
cial and/or economically challenged families.

Furthermore,  the  recommendations  from  the  national 
documents  are  in  accordance  with  the  results  from 
the  ROAMER  project  (ROAdmap  for  MEntal  health 
Research  in  Europe).  The  defined  priorities  regarding 
public  mental  health  from  an  expert  consensus  fall  in 
three overarching goals: to identify causes, risk and pro-
tective  factors  for  mental  health  across  the  lifespan;  to 
advance  the  implementation  of  effective  public  mental 
health interventions; and to reduce disparities in mental 
health [23].

A particular role in further improving CAMH is within 
the  educational  sector.  While  a  comprehensive  integra-
tion  of  mental  health  and  mental  disorder  topics  in  the 
teaching  content  is  recommended,  additional  school 
staff  (e.g.,  well-being  staff )  and  further  development 
of  the  mental  health  competences  for  school  teaching 
staff,  guided  by  mental  health  specialists,  is  a  key  rec-
ommendation  in  the  included  documents.  The  school 
setting  is  essential  for  information  activities  and  reduc-
tion  of  stigma,  and  to  further  achieve  the  goal  of  an 
open-minded  and  strengths-based  (rather  than  deficit-
oriented)  approach  to  mental  health,  focusing  on  child’s 
functioning (rather than on the diagnosis). School-based 
interventions  for  CAMH  can  yield  moderate  to  strong 
effects for a range of emotional and behavioural problems 
when implemented with evidence-based cognitive behav-
ioural interventions [24]. Regarding adolescents at risk of 
suicide, mental health literacy programmes in the school 
setting (such as the Teen Mental Health First Aid) aim to 
increase recognition and support towards affected peers 
[25].

The recommendations in the documents are not always 
supported  with  evidence  and  implementation  require-
ments.  For  example,  it  is  unclear  if  there  are  any  draw-
backs to moving away from age  as a transition criterion 
and what the training requirements of implementing the 
suggested approach would be. Current research projects, 
for example the preparation of a clinical research facility 
for transitional psychiatry in Austria [26], could provide 

the basis for implementation studies or outcome studies 
of such an adapted model of care.

Furthermore,  the  countries  recommend  additional 
health  service  research,  implementing  a  national  men-
tal  health  dataset  for  coordinated  data  acquisition  and 
increasing  the  availability  of  digital  tools  for  manage-
ment  and  documentation.  In  this  context,  indicators  for 
planning  CAMH  services  and  monitoring  CAMH  can 
be  utilised  to  create  a  better  way  of  dealing  with  cur-
rent  shortcomings  in  care  and  prevention  [27,  28].  A 
report  from  the  United  Nations  Children’s  Fund  (UNI-
CEF) highlights that routine monitoring of mental health 
and mental healthcare is seriously lacking, especially for 
CAMH [29]. As part of our own research, a collection of 
internationally  identified  indicators  covering  the  broad 
spectrum of mental health (such as risk factors, preven-
tion  and  promotion  factors,  life  satisfaction,  supply  and 
utilization  of  services,  quality  of  care,  and  sociodemo-
graphic indicators) is publicly available [30]. It may serve 
as a starting point for defining core-indicator sets.

Limitations

For identifying data in our study, we used a targeted hand 
search  (instead  of  a  systematic  literature  search).  We 
expected that CAMH care models and strategies are usu-
ally not published in scientific journals, but rather as grey 
literature on relevant websites (e.g., ministerial, or public 
health).  As  other  authors  might  have  identified  a  differ-
ent  set  of  documents  for  analysis,  our  research  findings 
are not fully reproducible. In addition, we were only able 
to  consider  a  selection  of  countries  based  on  the  HDI 
as  an  indicator.  As  the  HDI  combines  three  dimensions 
we considered it a better fit for our study purpose com-
pared to other indicators, such as gross domestic product 
(GDP).  However,  other  indicators  could  have  also  been 
used for country selection.

Further,  excluding  Asian  countries  is  a  limitation,  as 
there  are  Asian  countries  with  a  higher  HDI  rank  than 
those  included  in  our  study,  with  healthcare  systems 
comparable to western systems (such as Japan or Singa-
pore). Due to the selection strategy, and to the literature 
search  being  limited  to  June  2022,  there  is  a  possibility 
that other (or novel) CAMH policies or models exist that 
are  not  included  in  our  study.  Furthermore,  we  did  not 
collect  data  on  the  extent  to  which  the  strategies  have 
already been implemented in the selected countries.

We  excluded  documents  addressing  specific  indica-
tions (e.g., medical guidelines), general health (instead of 
specific to mental health), or all ages (instead of specific 
to  children  and  young  people).  These  excluded  docu-
ments might contain some supplementary information.

Furthermore,  when  extracting  data  from  the  docu-
ments, the information on the identified topic areas could 
not always be clearly assigned to the identified categories 

Jeindl et al. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health          (2023) 17:135 due to overlaps. Many aspects of mental health are inter-
twined, and although we have tried to match them care-
fully with the topic areas, there may have been alternative 
ways of assignment.

Conclusion
Based  on  our  findings,  we  strongly  advocate  the  use  of 
cross-sectoral  and  participatory  approaches  for  CAMH 
care  structures. The  involved  sectors  (health,  education, 
social  and  youth  justice)  should  integrate  mental  health 
promotion,  prevention  and  care  in  a  shared  vision.  For 
this  purpose,  health  service  research  should  accompany 
the strategic developments, aiming to create better ways 
of  dealing  with  shortcomings  in  care  in  general,  and  for 
vulnerable patient groups specifically.
