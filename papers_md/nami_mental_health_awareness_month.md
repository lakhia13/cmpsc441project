## Join NAMI’s Mental Health Awareness Month Campaign This May


This May, take action, raise your voice, and help change the conversation around mental health! Since 1949, Mental Health Awareness Month has been a driving force in addressing the challenges faced by millions of Americans living with mental health conditions. Now, more than ever, NAMI needs you to be part of this movement. Whether by sharing your story, spreading awareness, or advocating for change, every action helps break the stigma and build a more supportive world for all.


### Theme: “In Every Story, There’s Strength”


Mental health journeys are unique, but the strength found within them is universal. “In Every Story, There’s Strength,” highlights the resilience and diverse experiences that shape mental health journeys within our community. NAMI’s campaign celebrates the power of storytelling to fuel connection, understanding, and hope for those navigating their own mental health path. 💚 Each story shared is a testament to the possibility of recovery and the strength that lies within us all.


## Turn Your Struggles into Strength—Let’s Build Hope Together


Every challenge you’ve faced has shaped you into who you are today. By embracing and sharing your experiences, you empower others to do the same. Together, we create a movement of courage, healing, and connection. Share your mental health story with us by sending in a video, a message, a quote, or using#MyMentalHealthon social media.
