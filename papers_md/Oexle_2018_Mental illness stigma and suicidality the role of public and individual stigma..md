public and individual stigma

Aims. Suicide rates are increased among unemployed individuals and mental illness stigma can contribute to both
unemployment and suicidality. Persons with mental illness perceive negative attitudes among the general public and
experience discrimination in their everyday life (=public stigma components) potentially leading to self-stigma and
anticipated discrimination (=individual stigma components). Previous research found evidence for an association
between aspects of mental illness stigma and suicidality, but has not yet clarified the underlying pathways explaining
how different stigma components interact and contribute to suicidal ideation.

Method. Public and individual stigma components and their association with suicidal ideation were examined among
227 unemployed persons with mental illness. A path model linking public stigma components (experienced discrimin-
ation, perceived stigma) with suicidal ideation, mediated by individual stigma components (anticipated discrimination,
self-stigma), was examined using structural equation modelling within Mplus.

Results. Our sample was equally split in terms of gender, on average 43 years old and about half reported no suicidal
ideation during the past 30 days. In bivariate analyses all stigma components were significantly associated with suicidal
ideation. In the path model and controlling for symptoms, the association between experienced discrimination and sui-
cidal ideation was fully mediated by anticipated discrimination and self-stigma. Perceived stigma’s contribution to sui-
cidal ideation was fully mediated by anticipated discrimination, but not by self-stigma.

Conclusions. In general, programmes addressing multiple stigma components seem to be most effective in improving
suicide prevention. Besides interventions targeting negative attitudes and discriminating behaviours of the general pub-
lic, programmes to support persons with mental illness in coping with perceived and experienced stigma could improve
suicide prevention. Future studies should test the short- and long-term effects of such interventions on suicidality and
further investigate the role of stigma coping (e.g. secrecy) and emotional consequences (e.g. hopelessness and loneliness)
for the association between stigma components and suicidality.

Introduction

Persons with mental illness are additionally distressed
by negative attitudes and discriminating behaviour of
the general public (Rüsch et al. 2005). Past efforts to
decrease public stigma were only partly successful,
improving mental health literacy levels among the
general population but not changing the social rejec-
tion of persons with mental disorders (Schomerus
et al. 2012). Therefore, persons with mental
illness
still face negative stereotypes (e.g. people with mental
illness are incompetent), prejudice (e.g. ‘Yes, applicants
with mental illness are incompetent and I don’t like
them’) and discrimination (e.g. ‘I will not hire a person

with a mental illness’), which are the central elements
of mental illness stigma (Rüsch et al. 2005). Besides per-
ceiving negative attitudes (‘What the public thinks
about persons with mental illness like me’), persons
with mental illness also experience discrimination in
their everyday lives (‘How members of the general
public have treated me’). As those two aspects reflect
attitudes and behaviours of the general public, for the
purpose of this paper we will refer to perceived stigma
and experienced discrimination as public stigma com-
ponents. In our model (Fig. 1) public stigma compo-
nents affect the way individuals with mental illness
think about themselves (self-stigma) and whether they
anticipate future discrimination (anticipated discrimin-
ation). Self-stigma occurs if and when negative stereo-
types are internalised (‘Because I have a mental
illness, I am incompetent’), leading to poor self-esteem
and behavioural futility (Corrigan et al. 2016). Based
on personal experience and stigma perception, persons

with mental illness may anticipate future discrimination
(‘The public will treat me unfairly in the future’), often
motivating them to keep their illness secret and avoid
social situations for fear of being rejected (Link et al.
1989). We refer to self-stigma and anticipated discrimin-
ation as individual aspects of stigma since they reflect
individual views and reactions to stigma. Among per-
sons with mental illness public and individual stigma
components were found to contribute to low help-
seeking rates, poor clinical outcomes, social isolation,
emotional distress and reduced access to housing and
employment (Rüsch et al. 2005).

stigma’s

One aspect which only recently attracted scientific
attention is
contribution to suicidality.
Perceived stigma was associated with increased sui-
cidal ideation among persons labelled as mentally ill
or with deficits in emotional clarity (Oexle et al.
2016a; Wang et al. 2016). Stigma stress (occurring
when perceived stigma-related harm exceeds personal
coping resources) was associated with suicidal idea-
tion, mediated by social isolation (Xu et al. 2016a). In
longitudinal studies self-stigma or an increase in
stigma stress predicted suicidal ideation after 1 year
(Oexle et al. 2016b; Xu et al. 2016b). Some studies
already analysed pathways between public and indi-
vidual stigma components on suicidal ideation: Oexle
et al. (2016a) found that secrecy and hopelessness
mediated the association between perceived stigma
and suicidal ideation. One other study found discrim-
ination experiences to contribute to suicidal ideation
by leading to self-stigma, social isolation and hopeless-
ness (Farrelly et al. 2015). Based on these findings,
addressing public and individual stigma could con-
tribute to suicide prevention (Rüsch et al. 2014).
However, previous studies mostly focused on single
stigma components. More research on different roles
of multiple stigma components is needed in order to
inform suicide prevention programmes. The link
between stigma and suicidality among unemployed
individuals is particularly relevant since mental illness

stigma contributes to high unemployment rates among
persons with mental
illness and suicide rates are
increased among unemployed persons (Stuart 2006;
Milner et al. 2013).

Therefore, the present study examined a multi-
component model of the association between public
and individual stigma components and suicidal idea-
tion from the perspective of persons with mental ill-
ness. Building on previous findings we developed a
path model linking public stigma components as per-
ceived and experienced by individuals with mental ill-
ness (experienced discrimination, perceived stigma)
with suicidal ideation, mediated by individual stigma
components (anticipated discrimination, self-stigma)
(Fig. 1). We expected: (i) all included stigma compo-
nents to be positively associated with suicidal ideation;
and (ii) the associations between public stigma compo-
nents and suicidal

Methods

Study design and participants

Data were derived from the AloHA project (AloHa:
Arbeitslosigkeit und Hilfe-Aufsuchen), a study on
unemployed persons with mental health problems.
The study was advertised at unemployment agencies
Interested individuals com-

pleted a short telephone screening interview to deter-
mine eligibility. Inclusion criteria were being aged
between 18 and 64 years and current unemployment
receiving full disability pension were
(persons
excluded). Furthermore, individuals had to show psy-
chological distress as indicated by a score ≥13 on the
K6 Psychological Distress Scale (Kessler et al. 2003)
OR have current alcohol- or substance abuse with a
score ≥1 on items 2–4 of the CAGE-AID screening
tool for current alcohol- and substance-use disorders
(Brown & Rounds 1995). Conservatively and for the

sake of specificity, we omitted item 1 (cut down) from
the CAGE-AID score because in previous studies
nearly half of normal controls endorsed that item
(see Hinkin et al. 2001). In addition to fulfilling either
the K6 or CAGE-AID criterion, participants needed
to reach a score of ≥17 (range of possible scores: 12–
60) on the WHO-Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0
(Üstün et al. 2010), corresponding approximately to
the 85th general population percentile and to the aver-
age disability level of persons with one mental dis-
order (Andrews et al. 2009). We thus only included
participants with significant illness-related disability.
In total, 590 persons participated in the screening of
whom 331 fulfilled eligibility criteria and were invited
to participate in a questionnaire survey. Three hundred
and one persons completed the baseline assessment.
Participants with increased suicidality scores were
offered to discuss treatment options with a psychiatrist
and received information leaflets about nearby mental
health services and emergency help-lines.

Measures

The 5-item Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS)
was used to assess current suicidal
ideation (van
Spijker et al. 2014). On the first item, participants
rated suicidal thoughts during the past 30 days on a
11-point scale (0/never – 10/always). Persons who
scored 1 or more were then asked to which extent
these thoughts were controllable (0/no control at all –
10/full control), distressing (0/not at all – 10/extremely),
interfering with their daily life (0/not at all – 10/
extremely), and how close they were to a suicide
attempt (0/not at all close – 10/have made an attempt).
Item two (controllability) was reverse coded and a sum
score from 0 to 50 indicated current suicidal ideation
(Cronbach’s alpha in this sample α = 0.94).

Experienced discrimination was assessed by the
respective subscale of
the Internalized Stigma of
Mental Illness Inventory (ISMI; Ritsher et al. 2003).
The subscale consists of five statements reflecting typ-
ical discrimination and participants rated the extent to
which those statements reflected their personal experi-
ence on 4-point Likert scales (1/strongly disagree – 4/
strongly agree; e.g. ‘People ignore me or take me less
illness’). A
seriously just because I have a mental
total experienced discrimination mean score was calcu-
lated across all items (Cronbach’s alpha in this sample
α = 0.89). Perceived stigma was assessed by the
Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Questionnaire
(PDDQ; Link et al. 1989). Participants
indicated
whether 12 statements reflected their perception of
public attitudes towards persons with mental illness
on 6-point Likert scales (1/not true at all – 6/very
true; e.g., ‘Most people think less of a person who

Questionnaire on Anticipated Discrimination (QUAD;
Gabbidon et al. 2013). Participants rated their agree-
ment with 14 statements about discrimination expecta-
tions on 4-point Likert scales (1/strongly disagree – 4/
strongly agree; e.g. ‘If the police know I have a mental
health problem they will treat me unfairly’). A total
anticipated discrimination score was calculated as the
mean across all items (Cronbach’s alpha in this sample
α = 0.91). Self-stigma was measured using the self-
apply subscale of the Self-stigma of Mental Illness
Scale Short Form (SSMIS-SF; Corrigan et al. 2012a).
Participants rated their agreement with five statements
reflecting self-stigmatising attitudes on 9-point scales
(1/strongly disagree – 9/strongly agree; e.g., ‘Because
I have a mental illness, I am dangerous’). A self-stigma
sum score from 5 to 45 was calculated across all items
(Cronbach’s alpha in this sample α = 0.64). Psychopath-
ology was measured using a 9-item version of the
revised Symptom Checklist 90 (Klaghofer & Brähler
2000), yielding a total mean symptom score.

Statistical analyses

Only participants who identified themselves as having
a mental illness in response to a filter question (‘I have
a mental illness/see myself as having a mental illness
or am impaired due to mental illness’) were asked to
provide information on experienced discrimination,
anticipated discrimination and self-stigma associated
with mental illness. Therefore, 227 individuals were
included in the statistical analyses. Using SPSS
Version 21, we compared those 227 individuals v. the
74 excluded participants who did not self-identify as
mentally ill regarding suicidal
ideation, perceived
stigma, and socio-demographic variables (t-tests for
continuous variables and chi-square (χ2) tests for cat-
egorical variables) to rule out potential bias introduced
by the exclusion. Variable distributions were checked
visually, characteristics of the sample were described
independent and
and correlations between the
dependent variables were calculated (Pearson correla-
tions for continuous independent variables and point-
biserial correlations for categorical independent vari-
ables). Finally, the hypothesised model (Fig. 2) was
tested as a structural equation model (SEM) using
maximum-likelihood
estimation within MPlus
Version 7.4 (Muthén & Muthén 1998). In line with pre-
(Kenny 2015) acceptable

confounding effects.

Results

Regarding psychological distress and substance use
criteria the analysed sample consisted of 154 persons
fulfilling criteria based on the K6, 16 persons fulfilling
criteria based on the CAGE-AID and 57 persons fulfill-
ing criteria of both K6 and CAGE-AID. Compared with
the 227 individuals included in the analyses, persons
excluded due to the lack of self-identification as mentally
ill were less distressed by suicidality (M = 8.0, S.D. = 10.9;
M = 3.0, S.D. = 7.0; t = −4.5, p < 0.001) and symptoms (M
= 3.2, S.D. = 0.7; M = 2.4, S.D. = 0.7; t = −8.1, p < 0.001). No
significant differences between the two groups were
found regarding perceived stigma, age, length of lifetime
unemployment and gender (all p > 0.15).

As expected the distribution of suicidal ideation was
skewed, with nearly half of participants (47%) report-
ing no suicidal thoughts during the past 30 days

(Table 1). Compared to the midpoint of the scales, on
average medium experienced discrimination, medium
perceived stigma, medium anticipated discrimination,
low to medium self-stigma and medium symptom
levels were observed. Participants were on average
43 years old and about half female. The average length
of lifetime unemployment was about 5 years, ranging
from 3 days up to 30 years.

Suicidal ideation was significantly and positively
associated with experienced discrimination, perceived
stigma, anticipated discrimination, self-stigma and
symptoms (all p < 0.01). No significant associations
ideation were found for age, gender
with suicidal
and length of
lifetime unemployment. Therefore,
only symptoms were included as a confounder in the
subsequent SEM analysis (Table 2).

Fit indices of the final model suggest acceptable fit
(Table 3). Path estimates are shown in Fig. 2.
Previously observed direct effects of public stigma
components (experienced discrimination, perceived
stigma) on suicidal ideation lost significance, while
individual stigma variables significantly contributed

to the outcome. Total indirect effects were significant for
experienced discrimination (β = 0.11, 95%CI 0.03–0.21),
but not for perceived stigma (β = 0.04, 95%CI −0.03 to
0.11). Experienced discrimination indirectly contributed
to suicidal ideation via both self-stigma (β = 0.01, 95%CI
0.01–0.11) and anticipated discrimination (β = 0.07, 95%
CI 0.01–0.15). Perceived stigma increased suicidal idea-
tion via anticipated discrimination (β = 0.06, 95%CI 0.01–
0.13), but not via self-stigma (β = −0.02, 95%CI −0.06 to
0.01). The estimated model explained 22% of the total vari-
ance in suicidal ideation (R2 = 0.22). We also tested an
alternative model, including covariance between experi-
enced discrimination and perceived stigma as well as
between anticipated discrimination and self-stigma. As
the fit was bad, the model was rejected.

Discussion

Our findings provide initial evidence how public and
individual aspects of stigma contribute to suicidal
ideation among unemployed persons with mental
health problems. As hypothesised and in line with pre-
vious findings, all included stigma components were
positively associated with suicidal
ideation. In the
path analysis, we found that individual stigma compo-
nents completely mediated the association between
public stigma and suicidal ideation.

More experienced discrimination increased both
self-stigma and anticipated discrimination, which

(Link et

then both contributed to suicidal ideation. While we
it
expected the same pattern for perceived stigma,
was only associated with anticipated discrimination,
not with self-stigma. This is in line with previous
observations that the sole awareness of stigma does
not always lead to self-stigma, as perception alone is
not necessarily self-relevant
1989;
Corrigan et al. 2009). A recent investigation based on
a different sample than the one included in the current
study found perceived stigma to be associated with
suicidal ideation only among persons labelled as men-
tally ill for whom stigma was self-relevant (Oexle et al.
2016a). Although all included individuals in the cur-
rent study identified themselves as having a mental ill-
ness, some participants might have judged perceived
stigma as less self-relevant. Nevertheless, as it leads
to increased anticipated discrimination, perceived
stigma contributed to suicidal ideation. While no pre-
vious study examined the effect of anticipated discrim-
ination on suicidal
ideation, we found a robust
association between the two. As the anticipation of
being discriminated is common among persons with
mental illness, even if discrimination is not experi-
enced (Thornicroft et al. 2009; Lasalvia et al. 2013),
this finding is noteworthy and deserves more scientific
attention. While our model included public stigma as
perceived and experienced by persons with mental ill-
ness as well as individual stigma components, we did
not
include stigma coping and emotional conse-
quences as potential mediators. In line with previous
findings (Farrelly et al. 2015; Oexle et al. 2016a; Xu
et al. 2016a) loneliness and hopelessness could mediate
the association between stigma components and sui-
cidal ideation. In contrast to earlier studies (Milner
et al. 2013) we did not find an association between
the length of unemployment and suicidal ideation.

Findings on the association between mental illness
stigma and suicidal ideation are rare and previous
studies employed heterogeneous study designs mainly
focused on single stigma components. Additionally,
some previous findings were subject to bias as ana-
lyses were not controlled for confounding effects
such as symptom levels or binary outcome measures
were used. Our study addressed a meaningful gap
by analysing data derived from unemployed indivi-
duals, a hard to reach population with increased

suicide rates. A continuous outcome measure was
used and our analyses accounted for the complexity
of mental illness stigma as perceived and experienced
by people with mental illness as well as controlled for
symptoms. The generalisability of findings is limited
due to self-selection of participants and the sampling
criteria. As merely unemployed persons with mental
health problems were included, associations might be
different in other samples. However, our results are
in line with previous findings among other samples
and lifetime unemployment was considered as a
potential confounding variable. Due to cross-sectional
data no firm conclusions about causality can be drawn.
Nevertheless, the present study provides meaning-
ful information for future programmes targeting men-
tal
to improve suicide
prevention. In general, multi-faceted approaches tar-
geting both public and individual stigma components
are likely to be most effective. Perceived stigma and
experienced discrimination among persons with men-
tal illness could be reduced by interventions targeting
negative attitudes and discriminating behaviour of the
general public, such as programmes including social
contact with stigmatised persons and education
(Corrigan et al. 2012b; Thornicroft et al. 2016). In line
with our results, such interventions are likely to also
reduce individual stigma components (Evans-Lacko
et al. 2012). Additionally, persons with mental illness
should be supported in coping with perceived stigma
and experienced discrimination. While self-stigma can
be reduced by interventions using psycho-education
and peer support (Mittal et al. 2012), evidence for pro-
grammes reducing anticipated discrimination is lacking.
Future research should examine short- and long-term
effects of anti-stigma interventions on suicidality.
