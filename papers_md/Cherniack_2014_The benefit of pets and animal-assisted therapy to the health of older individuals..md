Many studies utilizing dogs, cats, birds, fish, and robotic simulations of animals have tried to ascertain the health benefits of pet
ownership or animal-assisted therapy in the elderly. Several small unblinded investigations outlined improvements in behavior in
demented persons given treatment in the presence of animals. Studies piloting the use of animals in the treatment of depression and
schizophrenia have yielded mixed results. Animals may provide intangible benefits to the mental health of older persons, such as
relief social isolation and boredom, but these have not been formally studied. Several investigations of the effect of pets on physical
health suggest animals can lower blood pressure, and dog walkers partake in more physical activity. Dog walking, in epidemiological
studies and few preliminary trials, is associated with lower complication risk among patients with cardiovascular disease. Pets may
also have harms: they may be expensive to care for, and their owners are more likely to fall. Theoretically, zoonotic infections and
bites can occur, but how often this occurs in the context of pet ownership or animal-assisted therapy is unknown. Despite the poor
methodological quality of pet research after decades of study, pet ownership and animal-assisted therapy are likely to continue due
to positive subjective feelings many people have toward animals.

1. Introduction

2. Potential Benefits of Animals

Two-thirds of all US households [1, 2] and close to half
of elderly individuals own pets [3]. Investigations involving
pets and other animals attempting to improve the health of
older individuals have involved many species, including dogs,
cats, and manufactured simulations of animals [4]. In this
paper, the evidence for the impact of animals on the health
of the elderly is assessed. Given the small number of pub-
lished manuscripts, a systematic review was not attempted.
Rather, the studies considered were obtained by performing
a PubMed search using terms including “pets, elderly, and
animal-assisted.” Additional articles were obtained from the
reference lists of the original articles found.

2.1. Effects on Mental Health. The most frequently studied
use of animals with elderly participants has been to alleviate
manifestations of cognitive disorders, such as agitation [5].
All of the studies were unblinded, not all were controlled, but
most, though not all, showed small but statistically significant
improvements in behavioral symptom scores in the animal-
assisted interventions.

One trial, the sole study that used a bird, uniquely noted
that animals conferred psychological benefits to cognitively
unimpaired older individuals; 144 persons without cognitive
impairment in nursing homes in Italy were exposed to either
a canary, a plant, or neither of the two [6]. The individuals

assigned to care for a canary or plant were provided with care
instructions and participated in a three-month intervention,
the details of which were not specified in the paper. Subjects
who cared for the bird had significantly better scores at
the end of the intervention on subscales of psychological
symptoms in the Brief Symptom Inventory and LEIPAD-II-
Short Version, which subjects in the other two groups did not.
Other investigations explored the effects of animals on
demented elderly individuals (see Table 1). A dementia unit
for US veterans piloted the use of a pet dog to elicit for
socialization. Twelve demented patients exhibited a signifi-
cant larger number of social behaviors, such as smiling or
speaking in the presence of the dog, implying that animals
might create benefit apart from any effect on cognition [7].

Another uncontrolled trial suggested that animals could
help alleviate problematic behaviors in demented individuals.
This trial enrolled elderly residents of two US nursing homes
who had MMSE scores of 15 or below who were treated
with animal-assisted therapy [8]. The participants,
in a
recreational room for one hour a day, met with a dog and its
trainer. They could engage in a variety of activities including
feeding, petting, grooming the animal, socializing with the
trainer, and discussing pets the subjects previously owned.
Subjects achieved a mean 25 percent, significantly better
scores on the CMAI index of behavioral disturbance after the
intervention.

Two further studies, in addition, piloted the efficacy
of animal-assisted therapy on cognition and mood in cog-
nitively impaired older persons. Twenty-five moderately
demented residents of a nursing home were divided into two
groups [9]. In the intervention group (mean Folstein Mini-
Mental (MMSE) score 15.3, mean fifteen-question Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS) score 5.9), the subjects experienced a
weekly hour and a half activity for 60 days in which they inter-
acted with trained pet therapy dogs. The participants either
walked, played with, petted, or held the animals under the
supervision of a trainer. In the control group (mean MMSE
score 18.3, mean GDS score 7.4, which was not significantly
different than in the intervention group) the subjects watched

the animals enter the nursing home but did not interact
with them. Unfortunately, after the intervention, both groups
increased their MMSE and lowered their GDS scores, but the
changes in both groups between pre- and postintervention
values were not significant. A second small study examined
four moderately to severely demented residents of a nursing
home who were videotaped for behavioral responses prior to
and during an animal therapy session with a dog [10]. The
residents displayed significantly fewer signs of agitation and
more social behaviors during animal therapy.

An additional trial uniquely explored the possibility that
animals might confer physical benefits to older persons with
dementia and, furthermore, used fish, which did require
the subjects to handle the animals. In this study, demented
individuals in several nursing homes successfully gained
weight after fish tanks were installed [11]. Sixty-two older
persons who resided in the dementia units of three different
nursing homes containing tanks in recreational and dining
rooms that allowed a twenty 30 × 20 inch viewing area with
background lighting to compensate for potential resident
visual impairment were compared with another group of
residents who had a “scenic ocean picture” added to similar
rooms. Residents in each of the homes had different exposure
times to either the fish tanks or the pictures. When the data
from the subjects who were exposed to the fish tanks was
pooled together, there was a mean 1.65 lb weight gain between
three months before the tanks and four months after the tanks
were placed (𝑃 < .000) but no gain in the control group.

Animals might provide other benefits to demented indi-
viduals, such as improving their ability to socialize, as sug-
gested in several trials. In one study, which was not blinded,
33 individuals who lived in a nursing home were exposed
to animals during 41.1 hours of animal-assisted therapy and
33.8 hours of recreational therapy without animals [12]. Long
conversations between alert participants were more likely to
occur in therapy groups when animals were present, but brief
conversations were more likely when animals were absent.
In another trial, a videotape captured the social interac-
tions between 36 nursing home residents in ninety-minute

Current Gerontology and Geriatrics Research

occupational therapy sessions with or without a dog present
[13]. Residents were more likely to have verbal interactions
with the dog in the session. In a third investigation, thirteen
demented residents were exposed to a plush mechanical toy
dog that could sit up and wag its tail, or a robotic dog
that could respond to seventy-five commands [14]. Subjects
responded to both objects, similarly, by talking to it or
clapping their hands when it moved.

Nurses have written their personal, qualitative observa-
tions that animals relieve loneliness and boredom, foster
social
interaction, and add variety to the lives of such
persons, indirectly suggesting other possible advantages to
human interactions with animals not thus far documented
in clinical trials [5, 15]. In one survey, the nursing staff of
an intermediate care unit delineated their perceptions of
“cat mascots,” animals that spend the day in the unit [16].
There was no formal regulation of the interaction between
the cats and the patients, nor any formal measures of the
interaction. However, the nurses did state their opinions that
the cats increased patient interactivity with their other people
and their environment, and that the patients enjoyed their
presence.

Pets may also positively influence the behavior of
demented elderly owners.
In one comparison survey,
demented pet owners were less likely to exhibit verbal
aggression but were otherwise similar to non-pet owners in
likelihood of vegetative, hyperactive, or psychotic behaviors
[17].

Thus far however, none of these studies on the use of
animals in demented subjects have suggested a mechanism
for how animals might alter the behavior of such individuals.
One might speculate that animals might create a distraction
to inhibit disruptive behavior or serve as a surrogate for
human interaction to learn or practice social behavior.

Several investigations have also piloted the use of animals
in the treatment of depression with mixed results. One small
trial showed even a brief intervention conferred some benefit.
Thirty-five individuals who were about to receive electro-
convulsive therapy (ECT) spent 15 minutes with a dog and
animal trainer or the same period of time reading magazines
before ECT treatment sessions [18]. All subjects had both
types of pretreatment every other day. Individuals reported
lower levels of fear about the upcoming ECT rated on visual
analogue scales when they had sessions with the dog. In a
similar trial, forty-two depressed patients spent time waiting
for ECT in rooms with or without aquariums. The presence
of aquariums did not influence the pretreatment anxiety, fear,
or depressive symptoms the patients experienced [19].

Animal-assisted therapy has been considered in the
treatment of depression in institutionalized individuals in a
number of studies. In one investigation, twenty-eight resi-
dents of an Italian nursing home had three-hour treatment
sessions once a week for a month and a half with a cat or
no change in their usual routine [20]. A nurse supervised
individuals in a therapy room, who could pick up or play
with the cat. The individuals who interacted with a cat did
not have any significant difference in Geriatric Depression
Screen score, or cognition as measured by MMSE, but did
have sixteen-point lower systolic blood pressure (𝑃 = 0.05)

and five-point lower diastolic blood pressure (𝑃 = 0.05) than
subjects who were not exposed to the cat. In an additional
survey, subjective rankings of pet attachment were actually
associated with higher ratings of depressive symptoms in
older individuals living in rural areas [21]. In another trial
of 68 nursing home residents in Australia, individuals who
visited a dog reported less fatigue, tension, confusion, and
depression [22]. Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy
were divided into two groups, one of which had a weekly
hour-long session of therapy with a dog and one of which
did not [23]. Those patients at sessions at which a dog was
present rated their symptoms of depression and anxiety half
as severe as those who did not. Taken together, these studies
imply a rather modest benefit at best for animals in depressed
individuals.

A meta-analysis was conducted of five studies of the
use of animal-assisted activities therapy in the treatment of
depression in institutionalized subjects [24]. None of the five
studies whose data was pooled for the meta-analysis was
ever published in a scientific journal; four were printed in
doctoral dissertations and the fifth was published in a book
chapter almost thirty years ago. The meta-analysis concluded
that such therapy could alleviate depressive symptoms with
a “medium effect size.” Neither the meta-analysis nor the
previously referenced manuscripts commented on possible
mechanisms of an effect.

Other studies have examined if pets might assist the treat-
ment of individuals with schizophrenia. Two investigations
suggested that animals could improve social behaviors in
elderly schizophrenics. Twenty schizophrenics, at least sixty-
five years old, had three-hour visit every week for a year with
a dog or cat and a therapist [25]. The subjects were taught to
ambulate with the animals on a leash, bathe, feed, or groom
them. A control group had a weekly news discussion session
simultaneously with the animal therapy group. Schizophren-
ics exposed to animals had significantly improved mean
scores on social functioning as part of the Social-Adaptive
Functioning Evaluation scale which members of the control
group did not. There were no differences between groups on
survey instruments describing the subjects’ impulse control
or self-care.

In another investigation, 21 schizophrenic inpatients were
divided into an intervention and control group [26]. Both
had 45-minute meetings twice weekly with a psychologist for
a total of 25 sessions. In the intervention group, a therapy
dog and handler participated. The dog was the focus of
interventions tailored to improved communication, social
skills, and cognitive rehabilitation. The control group had
similar sessions, except without the dog. Subjects in the
intervention group had significantly better scores on the
social contact score in of the Living Skills Profile and total
score on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Score scale.

Not all investigations noted that schizophrenics derive
benefit from animals. Fifty-eight older psychiatric inpatients
in one trial were randomized to spend five sessions of either
an hour a day with either pet therapy or an exercise group
[27]. There was no difference in a forty-question psychiatric
symptom score between groups. In addition to the trials
of animal therapy in older persons with mental illness,

qualitative research comprising focus groups of individuals
recovering from acute episodes of psychiatric disease has out-
lined what subjects perceive to be benefits of pet ownership,
such as companionship and a reinforced sense of self-worth
[28]. However, subjects sometimes were troubled by their pet
care responsibilities and grieved over the loss of pets.

Furthermore, several studies have implied that animals
offer psychological or social benefits to the elderly indepen-
dent of disease state. In one investigation, the effects of ani-
mals on the degree of loneliness of long-term care residents
were assessed using a survey instrument [29]. Thirty-five
people who lived in a nursing home had an experience in
which, for two and a half months, they interacted with several
animals including dogs, cats, and rabbits for two hours each
[30]. They scored significantly higher on the Patient Social
Behavior Score during and after the intervention. In another
study, forty-five residents of three facilities were divided into
those who received thirty-minute animal-assisted therapy
once a week for a month and a half, the same therapy three
times a week, or not at all. Residents who received any animal
therapy scored significantly lower on the UCLA Loneliness
Scale than those who did not. In a case series, a robotic dog
improved the loneliness scores on one assessment instrument
of five medically ill elderly persons [31]. In a qualitative
survey, dog owners over age of 70 in Austria stated that
dogs provided companionship and a sense of purpose [32].
However, finally, in few cases, animal-assisted therapy has
even been utilized to provide subjective benefit to critically
ill patients in intensive care units [33].

2.2. Effects on Physical Health. Numerous studies have
recorded evidence of the effects of animals on the physical
health of elderly individuals. Several have attempted to quan-
tify physiological benefits of the presence of animals on the
effects of stress (see Table 2). One study exposed hypertensive
pet owners to the stress of solving an arithmetic problem and
making a speech [34]. The investigators instructed half of the
subjects to acquire a pet, and the total subject population
was restudied after six months. Those who owned a pet had
significantly lower increases in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure in response to the stressor than those who did not.
In an additional investigation, the presence of a dog in the
room alleviated an increase in blood pressure in response to
the stress of public speech [35]. Eleven community-dwelling
older individuals with hypertension, mean age 81.3, were

asked to speak in the presence or absence of a dog while
blood pressure was being recorded. Participants who spoke
in the presence of a dog had a significantly lower diastolic
blood pressure (mean difference = 12.8 mmHg, 𝑃 = 0.006)
than in the absence of the dog. Another 10 healthy dog
owners of a canine achieved a significant systolic and diastolic
blood pressure reduction and subjective measures of anxiety
after performing a stressful task whether their own dog or
not was used [36]. There was a greater improvement of
outcome measures when the subject’s own dog was used,
which lasted up to an hour. Finally, in a small case series of
community-dwelling elderly individuals aged 65 to 91, one
group of participants received a weekly visit from a nurse
with a dog for a month, while one group had visits without
the dog [37]. Those who were in contact with the dog had a
significantly lower mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure
than those who did not (mean decrease 8 mmHg systolic and
4 mmHg diastolic, 𝑃 < .01 difference in the intervention
group from baseline). Taken together, these investigations
imply ameliorating effect of pet ownership on the physiologic
effects of stress.

Epidemiologic studies suggest pet owners may acquire
physical benefits, such as improved blood pressure and
greater physical activity. Among 5741 individuals in Australia,
those who possessed pets had a significantly lower resting
systolic blood pressure, a mean 5 mg/dL lesser cholesterol,
and 84 mg/dL triglyceride levels which were statistically sig-
nificant [38]. In another survey of 1179 elderly persons (mean
age 70), pet owners had comparatively reduced systolic mean
arteriolar and pulse pressure, and lesser risk of hypertension
(O.R. = 0.62) [39].

Other investigations imply that dog walking encourages
individuals to take part in physical activity (see Table 3).
In another study, dog owners in Canada (not exclusively
elderly, but including participants up to age 80) were more
likely to visit multiuse or walk-through parks than individuals
who did not possess dogs [40]. An investigation of 5902
individuals in the US noted a positive relationship between
dog walking and amount of total walking time [41]. Dog
owners were more likely to walk at least 150 minutes a week
(O.R. 1.69; 95% CI 1.13–1.59) and were more likely to involve
themselves in any physical activity during leisure time (O.R.
1.69; 95% CI 1.33–2.15). Dog walking was also associated
with likelihood of walking in 608 Washington state residents
(𝑃 < .01) [42]. A recent analysis of a cohort of 545 Scottish
participants, all at least 65 years old, dog owners were more

Summary of results

Pet owners more likely to use parks
Dog walkers most likely to perform leisure-time
physical activity

Dog owners more likely to walk (O.R. = 1.69)
Dog owners more likely to engage in physical
activity, walking
Dog walking associated with physical activity

Dog owners walked longer times
Pet owners experienced slower deterioration in
activities of daily living

Dog walkers had more physical activity

Dog owners walked longer times
Dog ownership not associated with recommended
physical activity large dog owners walked more than
small dog owners

likely to report themselves at the highest level of physical
activity than those not possessing dogs [43]. Among 3,075
elderly individuals (aged 70–82) in Memphis and Pittsburgh,
dog owners were twice as likely but non-dog owners half as
likely to take part in physical activity compared to people who
did not own pets [44].

Dog walking may encourage participants to take part in
other beneficial physical activities and to preserve their func-
tionality. In the largest survey to date, the California Health
Interview Survey, comprising more than 55,000 individuals,
dog owners more commonly walked as a leisure time activity
than those who did not own a pet (O.R. 1.6; 95% CI 1.5–
1.8) but were less likely to walk for transportation (O.R. 0.91;
95% CI .85–.99) [45]. In an epidemiological survey of more
than one thousand elderly persons at least 65 years old in
Canada, the loss of ability to perform activities of daily living
of persons who did not own pets progressed at a greater rate
than for pet owners [46]. In a Japanese survey of 5283 adults
up to age of 79, dog owners were 1.54 times more likely to
obtained recommended amounts of physical activity [47].
Among 127 elderly persons in Colorado, those possessing
pets ambulated longer distances (𝑃 < .05) and had lower
triglycerides (𝑃 < .01) than those without animals [48].

However, dog ownership may not be enough to guarantee
greater physical activity. In one Australian study, owners of
large dogs spent more time walking than those who owned
small dogs, and dog ownership per se was not associated with
greater probability of obtained recommended activity levels
[49]. While none of the manuscripts considering the effect
of dog walking on physical activity specifically considered
mechanism, one might speculate that, rationally, the need
to walk a dog might create a need to walk more, and that
increased physical activity might be more associated with the
pet’s needs than those of their owners.

Pet ownership may confer additional benefits to patients
with cardiovascular disease (see Table 4). Participants in a
treatment trial of antiarrhythmia drugs who owned dogs were

less likely to die over a year than others, including those who
owned other types of animals [50]. Patients owning pets who
were released from a coronary care unit were significantly
more likely to survive after one year [51]. Individuals who had
sustained a myocardial infarction in the past year and walked
their dogs for fifteen minutes three times daily improved
their exercise capacity on stationary bicycles (𝑃 < .05) [52].
Further analysis of a trial in which 460 pet owners were
implanted with a defibrillator (mean age = 61) revealed
that possession of pets rendered participants less likely to
die (𝑃 = 0.036) in the following 2.8 years [53]. In another
survey, seventy-six persons with congestive heart failure were
divided into three groups, one of whom visited a dog for 12
minutes, one of whom visited a person for 12 minutes, and
one of whom did not receive either [54]. Those who were
exposed to the dog had a lower systolic pulmonary artery or
capillary wedge pressures, and reduced serum epinephrine
concentrations. Sixty-nine in-patients with congestive heart
failure participated in an ambulation training program in
which they walked with a dog and a trainer [55]. When
matched with a “historical sample” of congestive heart failure
patients, subjects who walked with a dog walked twice as
far as the “historical sample” (mean 230.07 steps/day versus
120.2 steps/day, 𝑃 < .0001). Not all studies imply that pets
are beneficial for cardiovascular disease; in one follow-up
study of patients admitted to a unit for “acute coronary
syndrome” those owning a pet were more prone to death
or rehospitalizations a year later [56]. Nevertheless, given
the preponderance of the evidence, the American Heart
Association has released a statement acknowledging the
relationship and causality of pet ownership in the attenuation
of cardiovascular disease risk [57].

3. Harms of Animals

While the use of pets and animal therapy might confer several
potential health benefits to older persons, harms also exist.

Pet owners fall and sustain fractures as a result of their
animals. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention
noted that there were 86,629 falls a year attributed to dogs
and cats, with a mean injury rate of 29.7 per 100.000 persons
a year from 2001 to 2006 [58]. Older persons above 75 had the
highest injury rates (68.8 for those 65–74, and 70.6 for those
75 and older), twice as high as those between 35 and 44 (28.6).
A case series from Australia also reported 16 fractures to
elderly individuals who were at least aged 65 [59]. Most of the
injured were women, and individuals commonly tripped over
the pets or fell while bending down to feed them. The pets
were most commonly dogs and cats, but they also included
birds, a goat, and a donkey.

Other harms may be present, as well. Pets can be expen-
sive, time-consuming, and complex to care for. The average
lifetime cost of an average-sized dog can be $10,000 and a cat
$8,000 [1]. The pets need adequate food, housing, hygiene,
and veterinary care [60]. Elderly persons may, because of
physical or cognitive limitation, be less able to provide such
care than younger persons. In addition, the pets might
damage an elderly person’s property, although there are no
reports in the published medical literature. Pets that are not
safeguarded properly by their owners might also be a threat
to other people and to the environment. The pets could
potentially injure others, harm their property, or create fear
or mistrust. The animals might damage the environment (e.g.,
destroying animals and plants, creating waste).

Institutionalized elderly may also be less able to interact
appropriately with animals. One qualitative report of the
reactions of staff to an institutional cat mascot stated that
residents placed the cat in garbage and toilet and nearly ran
over its tail with wheelchairs [16].

Animals have the potential to cause human infection and
trauma. Concern about human infections caused by pets
has been mentioned as a possible adverse consequence to
pet ownership in the elderly [61]. Greater than 200 different
zoonotic infections exist [62]; however their exact incidence
in the elderly who own pets or participate in animal-assisted
treatments has not been documented and remains unknown.

Similarly, there may be traumatic injury from animal bites or
scratches, but similarly, how frequently this takes place as well
as the impact of any events is uncertain. The aforementioned
report of an institutional cat mascot mentioned that a cat
scratched a patient but did not give further details as to this
or other human injuries [16].

Pets might also cause psychological harm. Humans can
become very attached to their pets, and when they lose them,
they may undergo grief reactions similar to those with loss
of other people [32, 60]. The results of any investigations of
such losses on human health in the elderly have not been
published.

4. Future Directions and Conclusions

Preliminary studies have suggested the potential benefits
of animals on the physical and psychological health in
humans. Despite over four decades of research, these studies
remain preliminary. They are compounded by methodologic
problems including small sample size and lack of adequate
controls and blinding. A review of animal research more
than a decade ago outlined barriers [63] that still need
to be overcome, including access of animals to subjects
in institutional settings, fear of zoonotic diseases, lack of
standardized survey instruments, and recruitment of animal
handlers. There have yet to be blinded animal investigations.
In addition, the potential influence of the differences
in demographic characteristics of human subjects (e.g.,
differences in education, ethnicity, and income) remains
uncertain. In one study, elderly Latino pet owners, mean age
66, responded to a survey of their attitudes toward their dogs
and health [64]. Two-thirds considered the dogs to be their
“best friends” and “reason for getting up in the morning” and
their health to be better “than most people,” and seventy-five
percent deemed their health “excellent.” Future investigations
can clarify such influences.

Thus far, studies on the effects of animals on both mental
and physical health have reported modest benefits. Trials
of animal-assisted therapy demonstrated improvements in

Potential benefits

Potential harms

Table 5: Potential benefits and risks of animals in the elderly.

Increased physical activity
Improved survival in cardiovascular disease
Improved circulatory hemodynamic responses
Less behavioral disturbance in demented patients
Improved socialization in demented patients
Weight maintenance in demented patients
Less anxiety, fear in depressed patients
Improved social behavior in schizophrenics
Less loneliness

behavioral symptom scores in small numbers of subjects of
limited duration. Investigations on the influence of animals
on physical health, particularly epidemiological studies, that
imply that the presence of animals can reduce cardiovascular
risk, are more robust methodologically, but prospective trials
demonstrating clinical benefit still need to be performed.
New uses of animals may be piloted in the future. For
example, in one preliminary report, a dog was trained to
detect human melanomas by smell [65]. The use of animals
as pets and in therapy may also have harms, but their
incidence is rare, and these hazards have been even less well
documented than the benefits. There has been no formal
determination if whether these benefits outweigh the costs
of feeding and caring, which are listed for comparison
in Table 5. However, many reports describe participants’
subjective positive feelings towards animals. These positive
subjective feelings that people have toward animals together
with growing evidence of a potential role in the treatment of
cardiovascular disease may motivate their continued use of
therapy and ownership.
