Self-harm, comprising non-suicidal self-injury, and suicide attempts, is a serious and
potentially life-threatening behavior that has been associated with poor life quality and
an increased risk of suicide. In forensic populations, increased rates of self-harm have
been reported, and suicide is one of the leading causes of death. Aside from associations
between self-harm and mental disorders, knowledge on self-harm in forensic psychiatric
populations is limited. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical needs
of a cohort of forensic psychiatric patients, including self-harm and possible risk factors
thereof. Participants (N = 98) were consecutively recruited from a cohort of forensic
psychiatric patients in Sweden from 2016 to 2020. Data were collected through ﬁle
information, self-reports, and complemented with semi-structured interviews. Results
showed that self-harm was common among the participants, more than half (68.4%)
of whom had at some point engaged in self-harm. The most common methods of
non-suicidal self-injury were banging one’s head or ﬁst against a wall or other solid
surface and cutting, and the most common method of suicide attempt was hanging.
The most prominent functions of non-suicidal self-injury among the participants were
intrapersonal functions such as affect regulation, self-punishment, and marking distress.
Self-harm in general was associated to neurodevelopmental disorders (p = 0.014, CI
= 1.23–8.02, OR = 3.14) and disruptive impulse-control and conduct disorders (p =
0.012, CI = 1.19–74.6, OR = 9.41), with reservation to very wide conﬁdence intervals.
Conclusions drawn from this study are that self-harm was highly prevalent in this sample
and seems to have similar function in this group of individuals as in other studied clinical
and non-clinical groups.

INTRODUCTION

Every year 800 000 people in the world commit suicide. This corresponds to one suicide every 40 s
(1). In forensic populations, i.e., oﬀenders with or without varying degrees of mental disorders,
suicide is one of the leading causes of death (2, 3), and it has been reported that suicide is ﬁve to 10
times higher in prison populations than in general populations (2, 4, 5). Studies in prison settings

Self-Harm in Forensic Psychiatry

have found some environmental factors (e.g., being in a single
cell), psychiatric factors (previous suicide attempts, recent suicide
ideation, mental illness), and criminological factors (being on
remand, having received a life sentence, and having a violent
index oﬀense) particularly important in identifying individuals
with a high risk of suicide (6). One of the main risk factors
for suicide in prison populations is previous non-suicidal self-
harm behavior; the risk of completed suicide has been found to
be 30 times higher among people who demonstrate non-suicidal
self-harm behavior than among those who do not (6–8).

The term self-harm is broad and refers to both non-suicidal
self-injury (NSSI) and self-inﬂicted harm with the intention
of committing suicide (suicide attempt) (9). This behavior is
considered a global public health issue and is common in the
general population (2.9–41.5%) (10, 11). In prison settings, the
prevalence of non-suicidal self-harm and suicide attempts has
been reported to vary from 7 to 47.6% (12, 13). In a Swedish
prison cohort, the actual lethal intention of apparent suicide
attempts was found to be as low as 6% (14). To our knowledge,
few studies discuss the intention of suicide attempts. However,
one study found that individuals with personality disorders had
signiﬁcantly lower intention of completed suicide than those
with substance use or unknown psychiatric disorders (15). In
sum, self-harm constitutes a signiﬁcant challenge not only in
parts of the general population, but also in forensic settings
such as prisons. However, while it is important to determine the
prevalence of such a challenging behavior, understanding why
some individuals injure themselves is essential for designing and
implementing treatment and prevention.

(∼1,800)

One speciﬁc setting where knowledge on self-harm is scarce
is within forensic psychiatry. Every year, ∼350 individuals
are convicted to forensic psychiatric care in Sweden. Forensic
psychiatric patients
(16) are a relatively small
group compared with the signiﬁcantly larger group of people
imprisoned in Sweden (∼5,000) each year (17). In international
comparisons, it has been demonstrated a signiﬁcant variation
in both the number of forensic beds available, length of care
and patient group characteristics [e.g., gender distribution; (18)]
Nevertheless, a common denominator for all forensic psychiatric
contexts is that forensic psychiatric patients require substantial
eﬀort and skill in terms of health care and intervention. These
patients’ clinical presentations are characterized by a complex
spectrum of mental disorders and comorbid psychosocial
problems, antisocial behaviors, and early adverse experiences
(16, 19). The few studies on non-suicidal self-harm and suicide
attempts among forensic psychiatric patients report alarmingly
high rates (∼61%) (2, 20, 21). The severity of self-harm varies
greatly in these populations, which raises questions about the
function of this behavior. To our knowledge, this has not been
studied previously in forensic psychiatric patients, but theoretical
and clinical studies in other populations indicate that self-harm
may function as an emotion regulation strategy (22–28).

The clinical presentations and overrepresentation of self-harm
in forensic psychiatric patients make clear that this population
is extremely vulnerable in this area. Forensic psychiatric care
urgently needs to help these patients, but knowledge upon which
to base evidence-based practice is scarce.

AIMS

The explorative purpose of this study was to describe the clinical
characteristics of a cohort of consecutively recruited forensic
psychiatric patients with non-suicidal self-injury and suicide
attempts and possible risk factors thereof, with the following
speciﬁc aims:

(1) Describe the psychosocial, criminological, and psychiatric
characteristics of a cohort of forensic psychiatric patients,
(2) Determine the prevalence, characteristics of non-suicidal
self-injury and suicide attempts and functions of non-suicidal
self-injury in forensic psychiatric patients,

(3) Identify possible psychosocial and clinical risk factors of

non-suicidal self-injury in forensic psychiatric patients.

METHODS

Participants
This study was conducted in a consecutively recruited cohort
of forensic psychiatric patients. All patients who met the initial
criterion of being cared for at a high security forensic psychiatric
clinic in Sweden during the data collection period of November
2016 to November 2020 were candidates for participation. To
be included, patients had to have a longer predicted stay than
8 weeks at the clinic and be able to fulﬁll the tasks in the study
without an interpreter. Also, all patients were assessed by their
treating psychiatrist prior to participation and were excluded
if assessed as unable to provide informed consent. The sample
included only patients sentenced to forensic psychiatric care.
Patients with remand statues or ongoing prison sentences with
temporary need for involuntary psychiatric care were excluded
from the study.

The aim was to collect 100 participants, but due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, inclusion of participants was terminated
in November 2020 after 98 patients had participated. The study
was based on 98 participants (56% participation rate). For a
detailed overview of the inclusion of participants (see Figure 1).
The mean age of the participants was 34.9 years (range 19–
62, SD = 10.7) and 86.7% were male (n = 85). The mean
length of stay in the current forensic psychiatric care period was
23.5 months (range 1–135, SD = 33.5), with most participants
(n = 87, 88.8%) being treated under special care supervision,
indicating a signiﬁcant risk of recidivism. Only 14.3% (n = 14)
of the participants had previously been in forensic psychiatric
care. According to the Swedish National Forensic Registry report
from 2019, the median age of forensic psychiatric patients in
Sweden was 40 years, and 84% of the patients were male. The
majority (90% for males and 84% for females) were being treated
under special care supervision and 14% of the male patients
and 11% of the female patients had previously been under
forensic psychiatric care. Given this, the current sample seems
representative of the population forensic psychiatric patients in
Sweden. However, during data collection, nine participants chose
to terminate their participation before all data had been collected
and one self-report was assessed as unreliable. The characteristics
of the nine patients who chose to terminate their participation

could be summarized by the following: 90% male, all with
diﬀerent current primary diagnoses and index crimes. Since the
participants had been informed that they could terminate their
participation at any time without giving a cause, no data on
reason of dropout is available.

Procedures
Information on the study was given to all 184 eligible participants
by one of the two data collectors (the ﬁrst author and a fellow PhD
student), both with clinical experience with forensic psychiatric
patients. After receiving oral and written information on the
study, those who chose to participate provided written informed
consent. Thereafter, the data collectors gathered all available
ﬁle information, including the forensic psychiatric investigation
(FPI), medical records from psychiatric health care facilities,
detailed reports on previous living circumstances and criminal
history, written court verdicts, and incidents during current
treatment. The data collectors then met each participant, on one
or several occasions depending on the participant’s needs, to
conduct self-report questionnaires. When the information from
ﬁles was considered insuﬃcient, complementary semi-structured
interviews were conducted. A data collector was present for all
participants while they answered the questionnaires to provide

any necessary support (e.g., emotional support or interpretation
of questions). After data collection was completed for each
participant, all data were assessed for quality through a review
by the data collector and a senior clinician and researcher in the
ﬁeld. Every participant received a small monetary compensation
for their contribution to the study.

Measures
Psychosocial Background
Sociodemographic information (e.g., age and gender) and
schooling,
information on psychosocial background (e.g.,
institutionalization during childhood, work experience, alcohol
and substance use), and information on previous psychiatric
health care was obtained from ﬁles and complemented with
interviews with the participant. Information on psychosocial
background (e.g., parents absent during childhood) was asked
as “Did the participant grow up with one or both parents absent
during a signiﬁcant part of their childhood?” and responses were
categorized as “No,” “Yes, mother absent,” “Yes, father absent,” or
“Yes, both parents absent.” Information on institutionalization
was divided into two categories: shorter stay (<4 weeks) and
longer stay (≥4 weeks). Information on previous criminality was
collected through the FPI and retrieving written court verdicts

Self-Harm in Forensic Psychiatry

from the local district court. Criminal behaviors were categorized
as follows: lethal violence (murder/manslaughter), assaults (not
lethal or sexual), other violent crimes (threats and violence
against an oﬃcer, unlawful threat, and ﬁre setting/arson), sexual
assaults (all sexual acts prohibited by the Swedish Penal Code),
theft or robbery, economic crimes, traﬃc oﬀenses, drug oﬀenses,
and unlawful possession of weapons. Responses were then
divided into: “No,” “Yes, single occasion (one time),” or “Yes,
repeated occasions (two times or more).”

Mental Health
Clinical factors regarding mental health including substance
use disorders, both lifetime occurrence and current primary
and secondary diagnoses of mental disorders, were collected
through medical ﬁles and the FPI. In the ﬁles, diagnoses
were speciﬁed in DSM-IV (29), ICD-9 (30), or ICD-10 (31)
format and were therefore converted to DSM-5 (32) by a
senior clinician, a psychologist and researcher (author MW)
with considerable experience in the ﬁeld. Information on
diagnoses was categorized into (1) current diagnoses (primary
and secondary) and (2) diagnoses at any point in a participant’s
life (from child and adolescent psychiatry until current stay
within forensic psychiatric care). We found that one participant
had a schizophrenia diagnosis both as a current main diagnosis
and as a secondary diagnosis. This proved to be a miscoding in
the medical ﬁle, and the patient was coded in our study as having
schizophrenia only as primary diagnosis.

Self-Harm
Information on lifetime self-harm was collected from ﬁles and
self-reports, complemented by interviews. Data on NSSI (any
occasion, number of occasions, age at onset, type of self-injury,
and function of the behavior) and suicide attempts (any attempt,
age at onset, violent attempts, risk of completed suicide at
most serious attempt) were collected separately. The self-report
instrument Inventory of Statements About Self-injury (ISAS)
(33), designed to comprehensively assess the frequency and
functions of NSSI, was also used to collect information on NSSI.
The ISAS assesses NSSI in two parts: (1) the lifetime frequency
of 12 NSSI made intentionally but without suicidal intent, and
(2) the 13 functions of NSSI. In the ﬁrst part of the ISAS,
participants are asked to estimate the number of times they
have used speciﬁc methods of NSSI. Additional multiple-choice
questions assess descriptive and contextual factors including age
at onset, pain experienced during the NSSI act, whether the
behavior is performed alone or in the presence of others, time
between the ﬁrst urge to self-harm and the actual act (<1, 1–3,
3–6, 6–12, 12–24 hr, and >1 day), and whether the participant
wants to stop self-harming. Only participants who conﬁrmed one
or more NSSI behaviors in the ﬁrst part were asked to proceed to
the second. The second part evaluates the 13 potential functions
of NSSI by three items per function rated as “0: not relevant,” “1:
somewhat relevant,” or “2: very relevant”: aﬀect regulation, anti-
dissociation, anti-suicide, autonomy, interpersonal boundaries,
interpersonal inﬂuence, marking distress, peer bonding, self-
care, self-punishment, revenge, sensation seeking, and toughness.
Scores
for each function range from 0 to 6. These 13
functions constitute two overall factors: interpersonal factors

(e.g., interpersonal inﬂuence, peer bonding), and intrapersonal
functions (aﬀect regulation, self-punishment) (33). The ISAS
factors have previously presented good internal consistency
and expected correlations with both clinical and contextual
factors, supporting the reliability and validity of ISAS (34). The
Swedish translation of the ISAS has demonstrated good internal
consistency for the interpersonal and intrapersonal factors in
a female population with known and severe self-harm (35).
The ISAS has not been validated in forensic settings with an
explorative objective, nor has any other self-report assessment
of self-harm. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha was used to
calculate internal consistency for the ISAS self-report items,
demonstrating good internal consistency (α = 0.898 for the
intrapersonal scale and α = 0.859 for the interpersonal scale; both
over the acceptable value of 0.7). Analyses on ISAS-factors were
performed on the 43 participants who had answered the ISAS.

In the Results section we specify suicide attempts because
we believe this is of clinical relevance. Participants were asked
“Have you ever made a suicide attempt with the intention to
die?” Participants who answered “Yes” were asked to report
their most recent method of suicide attempt, any attempt of
suicide in the last 6 months, any substance use in conjunction
the latest attempt.

backgrounds and information on self-harm. For the third aim,
we performed chi-square tests of independence to examine
associations between self-harm and psychosocial and clinical
factors deemed relevant based on previous research. We
performed all bivariate analyses with the general self-harm
variable as dependent variable, which was created by merging
two variables (suicide attempt yes/no and NSSI yes/no). Eﬀect
sizes, conﬁdence intervals, and odds ratios (ORs) were reported
for ease of
interpretation. Several diagnoses could not be
analyzed in relation to self-harm due to a low number of
participants in each cell (see Table 5 in the Results section
for more information). The authors are aware of the large
variation of mental disorders in this population, and that a
small representation in some disorder categories might lead
to statistical power issues. However,
this is an explorative
study why we argue for the need to examine the sample
for
thoroughly regarding this issue. We did not correct
multiple comparisons because of the explorative purpose of
the study.

RESULTS

Psychosocial, Criminological, and Clinical
Characteristics of Forensic Psychiatric
Patients
The psychosocial backgrounds of the participants are presented
in Table 1. For gender-speciﬁc distributions, see Table A1. A
subgroup of the participants had not graduated from compulsory
primary school (n = 19, 19.6%), while 25 participants (25.8%)
had completed high school. A minority had initiated studies at
the university level (n = 6, 6.2%) or completed a vocational
training education (n = 4, 4.1%). As reported in Table 1, almost
one in three of the participants had bullied other children
during childhood, with the majority (n = 21, 22.6% of the
total cohort) having done so repeatedly. Truancy was reported
for more than three in four of the participants, with many
(n = 58, 61% of the total cohort) demonstrating a high rate
of truancy. Among the participants who grew up with one
or both parents absent, 27 (27.6%) reported one single parent
as absent, while in 13 cases (13.3%) both parents had been
absent during a signiﬁcant time of their childhood. About
one in three participants had been institutionalized during
childhood, and longer stays (several months or years) was

more frequent (n = 32, 32.7%) than shorter stays (a couple
of weeks; n = 4, 4.1%). This was also the case with foster
care placements, where a longer stay was more frequent (n
= 21, 21.4%) than a shorter stay (n = 7, 7.1%). The gender-
speciﬁc distributions presented in Table A1 in the Appendix,
demonstrated some trends regarding gender diﬀerences, e.g.,;
female participants were more often than males in some kind of
a partner relationship, reported much less work experience than
their male counterparts, and had to a lower degree bullied others
during childhood.

The mean age at ﬁrst prosecuted oﬀense was 22.3 years
(median = 18, range 15–50) among the participants, and the
mean age of onset at ﬁrst crime (not prosecuted) was 14.7
(median = 14, range 6–47). For male participants, the age
range of ﬁrst prosecuted oﬀense was 15–50, while for female
participants the range was 20–41 (see Table A2). The number
of previous convictions per participant ranged from 1 to 50,
with a mean number of convictions at 7.4 for the whole cohort.
The maximum number of previous convictions reported among
the female participants was 6 times. The mean number of
prison sentences was 1.7 (range 0–38). Female participants who
had committed an oﬀense of lethal violence (n = 4, 30.8%)
had done so at a single occasion. No woman had committed
an oﬀense of lethal violence at multiple occasions. Overall,
the majority of the female participants reported assaults (n
= 11, 84.6%), other violent crimes (non-sexual) (n = 11,
84.6%), theft or robbery (n = 10, 77%), and drug oﬀenses (n
= 10, 77%). For detailed information on the criminological
background of the cohort, see Table 2 and Table A2 for gender-
speciﬁc distributions.

As seen in Table 3, a majority of

the participants had
a current or history of diagnosis within the spectrum of
schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. The most frequent
current primary diagnosis at
time of participation in this
spectrum was schizophrenia (n = 19, 19.4%), predominantly
paranoid or unspeciﬁed, followed by unspeciﬁed schizophrenia
or other psychotic disorder (n = 18, 18.4%). A common category
in previous diagnoses was substance-related and addictive
disorders, with almost two in three (62.2%) participants having
received such a diagnosis at some point during their lifetime.
The most common substance use disorder was “Other” or
“Unknown)” (n = 37, 37.8%), followed by cannabis-related
disorders (n = 20, 20.4%) and stimulant-related disorders (n =
15, 15.3%).

gender diﬀerences in psychiatric (co-)morbidity were visible,
except for substance-related and addictive disorders and speciﬁc
disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders. This was
valid for both lifetime prevalence and current diagnoses.

Comorbidity was common in this sample at the time of
participation. The majority of the participants had one secondary
diagnosis (n = 43, 43.9%), 15 (15.3%) had two additional
diagnoses, 10 (10.2%) had three, and 3 (3.1%) participants
had four additional diagnoses. The most common secondary
diagnoses were substance-related and addictive disorders. Some
diagnoses belonging to the spectrum of disruptive, impulse-
control, and conduct disorders had a low lifetime occurrence
or no representation in this sample (Pyromania: n = 0 [0%],
Kleptomania: n = 1 [1%], and Other speciﬁed disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorder: n = 3 [3.1%]).

Prevalence, Characteristics, and Function
of Self-Harm in Forensic Psychiatric
Patients
In total, 67 (68.4%) of the participants had engaged in self-
harm (non-suicidal self-injury and/or suicide attempts) at some
point during their lifetime. Of those, n = 54 (55.1%) were
male. All female participants in the study (n = 13) reported
a history of NSSI or suicide attempt. Fifty-seven (58.2%) of
the participants had made one or more suicide attempts, seven
(12.5%) during the previous six months. Only one (n = 1) of the
female participants had never attempted suicide. The mean age
at ﬁrst suicide attempt was 21.5 years of age (median 19 years;
range 9–53, SD = 9.0). Most recent suicide attempts included
several diﬀerent methods. Of alternatives listed, hanging was
the most common (n = 14, 26.4%), followed by self-poisoning
(n = 12, 22.6%), cutting (n = 9, 17%), self-strangulation (n =
5, 9.4%), choking/swallowing objects (n = 3, 5.7%), jumping
from heights (n = 2, 3.8%), and traﬃc related attempts (n =
2, 3.8%). Six (11.3%) participants had made another type of
suicide attempt not given as an alternative. Asked to specify
their method, they reported “caused infection,” “ran out on an
iced lake,” “drove a car into a tree,” “started a ﬁre in prison
cell,” “injected air into blood,” and “tried to overdose.” The
physical consequences of the participants’ most serious suicide
attempts were none or minimal for 20 (40%), minor for 8 (16%),
moderate for 11 (22%), moderately diﬃcult for 6 (12%) and
severe or nearly lethal for 5 (10%). The most commonly used
method of suicide attempt for male and female participants,
respectively were hanging/strangulation for men (n = 13, 15.3%
of male participants), and cutting for women (n = 6, 46.2% of
female participants).

More than half of the participants (n = 56, 59%) had engaged
in NSSI (mean age at onset 18 years, SD = 8.3, range 4–41). The
mean age at the last episode was 28.25 years (SD = 8.3, range
13–45). The majority of those who had self-harmed with non-
suicidal intent had not done so under the inﬂuence of drugs (n =
31, 66%) and, although, other data on the exact circumstances of
the NSSI episode were not collected, many participants often told
the data collector that these episodes had occurred during their

arrest or early in their admission to forensic psychiatry. The most
common method of NSSI was banging or hitting oneself (M = 31
occasions) along with cutting (M = 30 occasions). The majority
of the participants who reported cutting as an NSSI (n = 13,
14.9%) had only done so once. Male participants reported more
single occasions of cutting, while female participants reported
mostly repeated occasions of cutting. The lowest frequency of
cutting reported by female participants was 10 times (n = 3), and
the rest of the female participants (n = 7) who had cut themselves
reported high frequencies (50–1,000 times). Several participants
who scored high on frequencies of NSSI stated that the frequency
was impossible to count and therefore reported an estimation.
Regarding pain experience while self-harming, almost half of the
participants who had self-harmed (n = 21, 45.7%) stated “yes,”
14 (30.4%) stated “sometimes,” and 11 (24%) stated “no.” The
majority (n = 38, 82.6%) reported that they preferred being alone
while self-harming. The participants were also asked to estimate
a time interval from their ﬁrst thought of self-harm to the self-
harm act. The majority (n = 31, 70%) reported “<1 h,” 11% (n =
5) answered “1–3 h,” 9% (n = 4) answered “3–6 h,” and 6.6% (n =
3) answered “6–12 h” or “more than 1 day”. When asked if they
wanted to stop self-harming, 81.8% (n = 36) of the participants
answered “yes.”

Overall, the participants reported intrapersonal functions as
the more relevant functions of NSSI. As seen in Table 4, the
two most commonly reported functions of NSSI were aﬀect
regulation and self-punishment, followed by distress signaling.
The distribution of the participants’ self-reported NSSI functions
were, for the majority of the scales, positively skewed, explaining
the large SD for some of the scales in Table 4. See Table A4 for
gender-speciﬁc distributions.

DISCUSSION

This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of self-
harm and its functions and possible risk factors in a cohort
of consecutively recruited forensic psychiatric patients. The
participants reported many aggravating circumstances during
their childhood, along with repeated criminal behaviors, both
violent and non-violent, and a high prevalence and comorbidity
of mental disorders, primarily within the schizophrenia spectrum
and other psychotic disorders and substance-related and
addictive disorders. More than half (68.4%) of the participants
had at some point during their lifetime engaged in self-harm
(NSSI and/or suicide attempt), and 58.2% had a history of
one or multiple suicide attempts. The most commonly reported
functions of NSSI were intrapersonal functions such as aﬀect
regulation, self-punishment, and marking distress, and self-harm
in general was associated with neurodevelopmental disorders
and disruptive impulse-control and conduct disorders, although,
we acknowledge the wide conﬁdence intervals and made no
corrections for multiple comparisons. Gender diﬀerences in
psychosocial, criminological and clinical characteristics were
obvious, with female gender being a risk factor for self-harm.

Psychosocial, Criminological, and Clinical
Characteristics of Forensic Psychiatric
Patients
Results in this study conﬁrm previous ﬁndings that forensic
psychiatric patients constitute a vulnerable group who have

experienced stressful events since childhood. Many participants’
childhood had been marked by seemingly complex relationships
with peers and family and troubled educational histories with
repeated truancy (61%) and school failures; one in ﬁve had not
graduated from compulsory primary school. Almost two in ﬁve
grew up without both parents present during a signiﬁcant part
of their childhood. Childhood institutionalization or placement
in foster care, usually for long periods, was also common. Over
the years, researchers have discussed the negative relationship
between some children’s temperaments and their parents’ poor
parenting and the subsequent eﬀect on the child’s behavioral
adjustment in adolescent and adulthood (37, 38). Some children
who are naturally more aggressive, easily frustrated, and have
a hard time expressing themselves in a prosocial manner may
frustrate their parents, who in response may disengage from
parenting or become more sporadic and inconsistent toward the
child, unfortunately intensifying the destructive development of
these already vulnerable children or adolescents. The participants
in our study were all once children, many of whom, for some
reason, had diﬃculties getting through their basic education, had
a high rate of truancy, and bullied their peers. For some, their
childhood circumstances led to institutionalization or foster care
placement for long periods of time. Taken together, the ﬁndings
suggest a profound lack of parental support, something that
needs to be investigated in future research. Regarding gender
diﬀerences, the results suggest more externalizing childhood
behaviors in male forensic psychiatric patients (e.g., bullying
others), and more intimate partner relationships and lower
degrees of work experience in the female patients. These are
ﬁndings that are important for the rehabilitation to society for
forensic psychiatric patients, since male and female patients may
have diﬀerent needs. Yet, this needs to be further investigated
with a sample including more female patients.

Self-Harm in Forensic Psychiatry

The criminal histories of participants in this study included
repeated assaults, threats, arson, theft, sexual violation, property
crime, and drug-related crime,
in accordance with reports
from the Swedish National Registry of Forensic Psychiatry
(16). Considering possible gender diﬀerences, the male patients
demonstrated a more diverse criminological background than
the female patients, with a lower age at onset conﬁrming the
suggestion above of more externalizing childhood behaviors
in male forensic psychiatric patients. Male participants were
lethal violence
overrepresented in multiple occasions of
compared to the female participants, yet the proportion of
female participants that committed lethal violence at one
occasion (30.8%) was larger than the proportion of male
participants (18.8%). According to a Swedish study (39) there
is a declining gap between genders in committed crimes. The
authors argue that there are multiple possible explanations to
this, yet with the deﬁnitive consensus that there is an increase in
females committing crimes. The present study was conducted at
a high-security forensic psychiatric clinic with special admission
criteria. The results might have been diﬀerent if the study had
recruited from lower-security clinical settings.

The mean age of onset within the diﬀerent crime categories
follow previous ﬁndings of criminal development in diﬀerent
forensic populations such as violent oﬀenders (40), with the
youngest mean ages of onset in drug related crimes (15.9 years)
and theft or robbery (16.4 years), and the oldest mean age
of onset for lethal violence (27.6 years). The age of onset for
some of these crimes was in some cases as low as 5 years of
age. Taken together, the criminal background of the participants
seems characterized by a focus on violent criminality, yet with
a versatility that must be seen in light of the context for
recruitment: a high-security forensic psychiatric clinic. Thus,
this pattern cannot be expected to translate to all forensic
psychiatric contexts but may be speciﬁc to those referred to
care facilities with high security. However, the results clearly
demonstrate the need for early childhood interventions and
support to prevent the criminological path of some forensic
psychiatric patients, and for continued explorations of gender
diﬀerences in criminological characteristics.

Representation of gender in the sample (predominantly
male) was in line with reports from the Swedish National
Registry of Forensic Psychiatry (16). The most common
primary psychiatric diagnosis at the time of participation was
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. While
schizophrenia (paranoid and unspeciﬁed) was the overall most
common (primary or secondary) diagnosis in this sample,
over 64.3% of
the participants had at some point during
their lifetime been diagnosed with some kind of substance-
related and addictive disorder. According to previous research,
forensic psychiatric patients are more likely than a general
psychiatric population to be treated with a combination of
diﬀerent antipsychotic medications and higher doses (19). For
the current cohort of forensic psychiatric patients suﬀering
from high comorbidity of psychotic disorders and substance use
disorders, the pharmacological treatment could be immensely
challenging for clinicians.
the prevalence of
neurodevelopmental disorders in this sample was lower at the
time of participation than the lifetime prevalence. Although,

Interestingly,

symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders might decrease with
time for some individuals (41, 42), these disorders may not
be adequately accounted for in forensic psychiatric care, since
psychotic disorders, especially in a more acute phase, might
overshadow other mental disorders. In fact, this could be a valid
concern for many other mental disorders, such as personality
disorders, as symptoms might be harder to tease out in an
overall complex clinical picture. Regarding possible gender
diﬀerences in psychiatric morbidity, it is known that women
overall tend to report higher lifetime prevalence of mood and
anxiety disorders (43) and BPD (44), and women in forensic
psychiatry tend to be overrepresented in BPD (45). Although,
we found that BPD was common in female participants, no
such conclusions could be drawn from the current sample
because of the low number of women represented. However,
the results indicate diﬀering psychiatric (co-)morbidity between
female and male forensic psychiatric patients, something that
needs to be explored in samples with a larger proportion of female
patients before conclusions can be drawn. The current ﬁndings
of a complex psychiatric comorbidity in forensic psychiatric
patients emphasize the need for a forensic psychiatric care that
accounts for both comorbidity and gender diﬀerences and tailor
interventions accordingly.

Prevalence, Characteristics, and Function
of Self-Harm in Forensic Psychiatric
Patients
The prevalence of self-harm in the current study was high,
in line with previous studies on forensic samples (46, 47).
More than half of the participants reported self-harm, including
suicide attempts, at least once. This is a serious behavior that
can lead to death or other serious physical injuries, and the
consequences of self-harm are visible not only within health
care or the individuals’ personal suﬀering, but also in health
economics. The societal costs of self-harm are often explained
in terms of the costs, the need, and the length of hospitalization
and/or medical treatment and psychosocial assessment related
to the self-harm event (48). This study found three particularly
interesting characteristics of self-harm: (1) hanging was the most
common method of suicide attempt, (2) the most serious suicide
attempt usually had no or minimal physical consequences, and
(3) the most frequent form of NSSI was banging one’s head or ﬁst
against a wall or cutting oneself.

Hanging as the most commonly used method of suicide
attempt corresponds well with ﬁndings that hanging is the most
frequently used method for completed suicide among men in
Europe (49). Researchers argue that the chosen method of suicide
is often inﬂuenced by the possibility of succeeding with the
suicide without being detected (49). Results in our study show
that most participants did choose a lethal method for their most
serious suicide attempt, but they survived with minimal or no
physical consequences. We suggest this might be because the
suicide attempt was made in a forensic or care setting where the
person had no possibility of being alone without supervision for
any signiﬁcant length of time. The suicide attempt, therefore,
may not have been made with lethal intent, but could have
had another function. However, since no detailed data on the

Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org

Laporte et al.

Self-Harm in Forensic Psychiatry

circumstances around the suicide attempt were collected, this
needs to be further investigated in future studies. Our ﬁndings
can be contrasted against ﬁndings from patients with severe
depressive disorders, where 32% had made a previous suicide
attempt (50). We collected no further information on the
circumstances or context of the most frequently used method
of NSSI (banging ﬁsts or head against wall or cutting), but
participants often told the data collector that these episodes of
NSSI and/or suicide attempt had occurred during their arrest
or early in their admission to forensic psychiatry. This provides
increased support for the proposition that mentally disordered
oﬀenders are especially vulnerable to self-harm in critical time of
their initial deprivation of liberty due to criminal oﬀending and
staﬀ must be extra vigilant about the risk for self-harm in such
contexts. All female participants reported some form of self-harm
(NSSI and/or suicide attempt) and reported high frequencies
of the NSSI behavior cutting, while male participants more
frequently reported hanging/strangulation. Early studies argue
for gender diﬀerences in self-harm behavior (51–53), while more
recent studies [e.g., (54)] show that self-harm rates in men are not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those among women. Although, the
current study showed a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
male and female participants concerning self-harm, general
conclusions regarding gender diﬀerences cannot be drawn from
this study because of the low number of female participants.

Previous studies on the functions of NSSI tend to fall on two
sides: intrapersonal or interpersonal functions. The results of
this study point to an intrapersonal orientation of the functions
of NSSI, most prominently aﬀect regulation, self-punishment,
and distress signaling. This was especially prominent among
female participants, although, the women also reported more
interpersonal functions regarding interpersonal inﬂuence and
self-care. This pattern is similar to that in discussions dominating
the research ﬁeld of self-harm today and shows that the functions
of NSSI in forensic psychiatric patients, despite the inﬂuence of
severe mental disorders, are comparable to those in other clinical
and non-clinical groups (55–57) and that gender diﬀerences
need to be considered. This information gives a unique insight
into forensic psychiatric patients’ perspectives on self-harm and
is crucial for decisions on interventions directed toward self-
harm in forensic psychiatry. Patients in forensic psychiatry also
demonstrate, as evidenced earlier and in the current study, severe
mental disorders and have also often experienced a traumatic
childhood (58, 59).

Psychosocial and Clinical Risk Factors of
Self-Harm
There were no statistically signiﬁcant associations between self-
harm (NSSI and/or suicide attempts) and any of the psychosocial
variables studied. Furthermore, no strong associations to any
speciﬁc psychiatric diagnosis were demonstrated. However, self-
harm was associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (p =
0.014, CI = 1.23–8.02, OR = 3.14) and disruptive impulse-
control and conduct disorder (p = 0.012, CI = 1.19–74.6, OR
= 9.41), although, the wide conﬁdence intervals should be
acknowledged. In numerous previous studies, self-harm has been

associated with BPD, although, participants in the majority of
those clinical studies have been female, and women are known
to be overrepresented in BPD (44, 60, 61). In this study, we
could not test the association between self-harm and BPD due
to a low prevalence of the speciﬁc diagnosis in the sample.
However, a high rate of self-harm was reported in several other
diagnostic groups. Of the 67 participants who reported self-harm,
45 demonstrated a disorder within the spectrum of schizophrenia
and other psychotic disorders. Even though, female gender
increased the risk of self-harm 1.2 times, no gender-speciﬁc
diﬀerences were demonstrated when the males in this sample
were analyzed separately.

Given the NSSI functions reported by the participants, this
could suggest they considered NSSI a way of expressing distress
and frustration. However, conclusions about the function of NSSI
must be drawn with caution and need to be further investigated
in this particular group. Self-harm is a well-researched area,
but not in forensic populations, and the diﬀerences in both
the environmental and psychosocial backgrounds between a
general population sample and a forensic sample must be taken
into account.

Strengths and Limitations
The sample in the current study was large considering previously
reported diﬃculties in recruiting participants from forensic
psychiatry (62), and the number of total forensic psychiatric
patients existing in Sweden, representing ∼5% of the total
population and characteristics in line with the total population.
However, the distribution of psychiatric diagnoses was not varied
enough for analyses with self-harm as a dependent variable.
Thus, in-depth analyses on self-harm in relation to possible risk
factors were not feasible. Also, the current sample was recruited
from a high-security forensic psychiatric clinic and may thus
not be generalizable to forensic psychiatric settings in general.
Diﬀerences in the legal context also need to be considered,
since forensic psychiatric patients might be legally deﬁned
diﬀerently in other jurisdictions. Furthermore, we acknowledge
the limitations due to sample size, aﬀecting the statistical analysis
possibilities. Also, since the current study was cross-sectional, no
conclusions on causality can be drawn from the current ﬁndings.
Another limitation of this study is that the instrument used to
collect self-report information on NSSI has not previously been
used in a forensic sample. Although, the psychometrics of the
instrument had acceptable values, this should be studied further.
In the ﬁrst part of the ISAS participants report the number of
NSSI incidents. This becomes problematic in terms of reliability
as the number rises as it did in our sample. Multiple participants
reported more than 100 up to 1000 NSSI incidents. Without
questioning the accuracy of their information, this result raises
concern about whether this instrument is suitable for a sample
with substantial NSSI. This has been pointed out as problematic
in previous research (63, 64). Finally, we made no corrections for
multiple comparisons, due to the study’s explorative design.

Conclusions
This study conﬁrms forensic psychiatric patients as a vulnerable
patient group with a complex and severe clinical presentation in

combination with early maladjustment to society, where gender
diﬀerences need to be considered. The results demonstrate
that self-harm is a common and serious issue in a forensic
psychiatric sample, with a higher prevalence than in the general
population. Although, self-harm was signiﬁcantly associated with
neurodevelopmental disorders and disruptive, impulse-control,
and conduct disorders, the conﬁdence intervals were large in both
cases and therefore no conclusions can be drawn in relation to
clinical diagnosis. Self-harm was not associated with any speciﬁc
psychosocial characteristics, but the predominant functions of
NSSI in forensic psychiatric patients—aﬀect regulation, self-
punishment, and distress signaling—indicate that this group of
vulnerable and exposed individuals may express their distress in
a self-destructive manner.
