Abstract
Background  To diagnose and manage adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum 
Disorder (ASD), or their co-occurrence (ADHD + ASD), clinicians must identify specific features that differentiate 
these diagnostic categories. Self-report questionnaires targeting specific features are widely used and, together with 
clinical assessments, provide reliable diagnoses. Although affective lability is present in various psychiatric disorders, 
it lacks specificity when screening for ADHD in the general population, and its discriminant value for ADHD, ASD, and 
ADHD + ASD has not been studied.

Methods  This study involved 300 adults without intellectual developmental disorder (188 male) who received an 
ADHD (n = 174), ASD (n = 68), or ADHD + ASD (n = 58) diagnosis after a multidisciplinary consensus decision according 
to DSM-5 criteria. Before clinical assessment, all patients requesting evaluation for one of these diagnoses completed 
questionnaires on an online platform. The assessment instruments included a modified version of the Barkley Adult 
ADHD Rating Scale (BAARS IV) for ADHD, the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and the Empathy Quotient (EQ) for ASD 
features, and the Affective Lability Scale (ALS) for affective lability. Total scores and sub-scores of the instruments were 
compared among the three groups. Additionally, stepwise logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify 
specific measures that contribute to group discrimination.

Results  Results revealed distinct patterns in symptomatology as expected. The ADHD and the ADHD + ASD groups 
presented significantly higher ALS total score compared to ASD. Stepwise logistic regression analyses identified 
specific measures contributing to group differentiation. ASD vs. ADHD + ASD discrimination included BAARS IV 
current total score and EQ total score. The subscale anger from ALS in addition with BAARS IV past total score and AQ 
total score were the factors that discriminated ADHD diagnosis from the co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD. Finally,

Self-report dimensions

Background
Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD)  is 
characterized by the developmentally inappropriate man-
ifestation  of  inattention,  impulsiveness,  and/or  hyperac-
tivity, persisting across time and resulting in impairment 
across  multiple  domains  of  life  activities.  On  the  other 
hand, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized 
by  persistent  deficits  in  social  interaction  and  commu-
nication,  coupled  with  restrictive,  repetitive  patterns  of 
behavior  or  interests  (Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual 
of  Mental  Disorders  [DSM]-Fifth  Edition  [1]),.  These 
conditions,  originating  in  childhood,  usually  extend 
into  adulthood,  prompting  a  growing  need  for  research 
and  clinical  attention  regarding  their  persistence  into 
this  life  stage.  The  heightened  awareness  of  ADHD  and 
ASD  in  adulthood,  coupled  with  increased  referrals  for 
or requests of diagnoses, necessitates diagnostic services 
capable of providing evidence-based assessments for this 
age  group  [2–6]. The  prevalence  of  co-occurring  neuro-
developmental and psychiatric conditions contributes to 
diagnostic  overshadowing,  increasing  the  complexity  of 
healthcare provision [7, 8].

Notably,  ADHD  emerges  as  the  most  prevalent  co-
occurrence  of  ASD  [9],  with  estimates  ranging  from  40 
to 70% [10–12]. Moreover, subthreshold ADHD traits are 
prevalent  in  ASD  [13].  Conversely,  ASD  and  ASD  traits 
are  reported  to  be  present  in  10–20%  of  adult  ADHD 
patients  [13–17],  prompting  the  consideration  that  the 
diagnostic  categories  of  ADHD  and  ASD  may  not  dis-
tinctly  align  with  separate  underlying  mechanisms  or 
dysfunctions  [18,  19].  While  traditionally  approached 
through the lens of cognitive control, ADHD, as an exam-
ple of developmental disability, may benefit from an emo-
tion  regulation  perspective  [20].  Notably,  the  emotional 
dimension  in  ADHD,  although  recognized  for  years  (e.g 
[21]).,,  is  yet  to  be  incorporated  into  the  core  diagnos-
tic  criteria  for  the  condition  [22].  Co-occurring  features 
in  ADHD  and  ASD  likely  contribute  to  emotional  diffi-
culties  [23],  emphasizing  the  transdiagnostic  nature  of 
emotion  regulation  [24,  25].  Deficits  in  emotion  regula-
tion  have  been  identified  in  children  with  both  ADHD 
and  ASD  [26].  In  a  comparative  analysis  [27],  no  sig-
nificant  differences  in  emotion  recognition  factors  were 
observed  among  ASD + ADHD,  ASD-only,  and  ADHD-
only  groups.  The  ASD + ADHD  group  exhibited  a  more 

pronounced deviation from the control group compared 
to  the  non-co-occurring  groups,  underscoring  the  need 
for nuanced approaches in understanding and diagnosing 
these conditions.

The  Affective  Lability  Scale  (ALS),  a  widely  used  self-
report  questionnaire,  gauges  the  tendency  of  emotions 
to  shift  and  oscillate  between  depression  and  elation,  as 
well  as  depression  and  anxiety.  The  short  version,  ALS-
18,  demonstrates  robust  psychometric  properties  and 
elevated scores in adults with ADHD or ASD, compared 
to  controls  [28].  In  the  context  of  adults  with  ADHD 
and  no  co-occurring  conditions,  the  study  of  ALS-18 
indicated that affective lability is present in ADHD even 
in  the  absence  of  psychiatric  comorbidities.  However, 
while  affective  lability  seems  to  be  present  in  ADHD,  it 
is also observed in various psychiatric disorders, limiting 
its  specificity  when  screening  for  ADHD  in  the  general 
adult population [29]. However, the latter study does not 
address  the  discriminant  value  of  affective  lability  and 
its  subscales  among  various  neurodevelopmental  condi-
tions,  particularly  between  ADHD  and  ASD.  This  study 
aims to examine the discriminative potential of affective 
lability,  as  measured  by  the  ALS-18,  in  distinguishing 
between ADHD, ASD, and ADHD + ASD groups. Affec-
tive lability, as mentioned above is particularly prominent 
in ADHD populations and may contribute to challenges 
in  managing  emotions  and  adapting  to  environmen-
tal  demands.  This  emotional  variability  is  also  evident 
in  ASD,  though  it  may  manifest  differently  due  to  dis-
tinct  profiles  associated  with  social  communication  and 
repetitive  behaviors.  The  ALS-18  provides  a  structured 
measure  of  affective  lability  across  different  emotional 
dimensions, enabling a nuanced assessment of emotional 
shifts that may be relevant for diagnostic differentiation. 
The  reliability  and  validity  of  the  ALS-18  in  ADHD  and 
ASD populations [e.g. 28] show that it captures patterns 
of  emotional  variability  that  are  both  clinically  relevant 
and  indicative  of  broader  affective  dysregulation.  Given 
the  transdiagnostic  nature  of  affective  lability  and  its 
potential role in distinguishing neurodevelopmental pro-
files, this study hypothesizes that the ALS-18 can provide 
meaningful  discriminative  utility  among  ADHD,  ASD, 
and ADHD + ASD groups.

In  our  previous  study  [13]  we  estimated  the  rate  of 
co-occurrence  of  ADHD  and  ASD  in  adults  without

intellectual developmental disorder that were referred for 
a diagnostic assessment for suspected neurodevelopmen-
tal conditions for the first time in their lives, and exam-
ined how the total score and individual trait dimensions, 
such  as  the  current  and  past  inattention,  hyperactivity, 
and  impulsivity  that  are  derived  from  the  Barkley  Adult 
ADHD  Rating  Scale-IV  (BAARS-IV),  the  five  subscales 
deriving from the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), and 
the total score of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) could help 
a  clinician  in  everyday  clinical  practice  to  identify  vari-
ables that could differentiate patients with ADHD, ASD, 
and ADHD + ASD. We found that the dimensions of cur-
rent impulsivity, attention to detail, imagination, and EQ 
total  score  discriminated  adults  with  ADHD,  ASD,  and 
co-occurring ADHD + ASD. In that sample, traits related 
to affective lability were not explored.

In  the  present  investigation,  conducted  within  our 
Adult  Neurodevelopmental  Clinic,  we  examined  a  dis-
tinct  sample  from  our  previous  study  that  comprises 
individuals  diagnosed  with  ADHD,  ASD,  or  a  co-occur-
ring  diagnosis  of  ADHD + ASD  (a  mix  of  diagnostic 
backgrounds,  some  receiving  their  diagnoses  in  child-
hood,  while  others  were  diagnosed  for  the  first  time  in 
adulthood).  Our  primary  aim  was  to  examine  the  dis-
criminative  potential  of  affective  lability,  as  measured 
by  the  ALS-18,  in  distinguishing  ADHD,  ASD,  and 
ADHD + ASD. Additionally, we explored the contribution 
of  other  self-report  measures  (BAARS-IV,  AQ,  and  EQ) 
to  provide  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  symptom 
differentiation  across  these  neurodevelopmental  condi-
tions.  The  chosen  self-report  instruments,  namely  the 
BAARS-IV,  AQ,  EQ,  and  the  ALS-18,  were  utilized  to 
comprehensively assess not only various aspects of neu-
rodevelopmental traits but also features related to affec-
tive  lability.  By  employing  these  measures,  we  sought  to 
contribute nuanced insights into the discriminative util-
ity of these instruments in the diagnostic process.

Methods
Recruitment

The  research  group  included  300  adults  that  were 
assessed  at  the  Adult  Neurodevelopmental  Department 
within  the  1st  Department  of  Psychiatry  of  our  Univer-
sity  and  received  ADHD  and/or  ASD  diagnosis  during 
a  three-year  period  (2020–2023).  The  Adult  Neurode-
velopmental  Department  stands  as  the  only  nationwide 
center that accepts referrals from the general population 
across the country for the diagnosis of ASD and ADHD 
in  adults.  The  multidisciplinary  team  that  carries  out 
all  assessments  consists  of  psychiatrists  endowed  with 
extensive  experience  in  the  diagnosis  and  support  of 
neurodevelopmental  conditions  in  adults  and  trained  in 
Autism  Diagnostic  Observation  Scale  (ADOS),  Autism 
Diagnostic  Interview–Revised  (ADI-R),  and  Diagnostic 

Interview  for  ADHD  in  Adults  (DIVA).  Additionally, 
the  team  encompasses  clinical  psychologists,  a  speech 
and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and a 
social  worker.  To  be  included  in  the  study,  subjects  had 
to  be  adults  without  intellectual  developmental  disor-
der  and  fluent  phrase  speech.  Exclusion  criteria  were 
the  presence  of  acute  psychopathology  requiring  urgent 
psychiatric  support,  IQ < 70  according  to  the  Wechsler 
Adult  Intelligence  Scale  (WAIS),  a  known  genetic  cause 
and inability to understand the Greek language. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all the participants.

Procedure

The  assessment  procedure  adhered  to  a  standardized 
diagnostic  protocol  meticulously  delineated  in  previ-
ous  studies  [13,  30].  The  only  difference  (in  the  pres-
ent  study)  was  that  instead  of  using  emails,  all  referred 
patients were required to engage with an online platform 
dedicated to the collection of medical research data. This 
platform facilitates the remote and electronic acquisition 
of volunteer data, incorporating questionnaires for auto-
mated  evaluation.  Subsequently,  the  gathered  informa-
tion  is  systematically  organized  in  a  database,  prepared 
for  subsequent  analysis  [31].  Utilizing  this  data  collec-
tion  platform  that  enforced  completion  of  all  forms  in 
their  entirety,  we  did  not  encounter  instances  of  miss-
ing  data.  The  administered  questionnaires  encompass 
demographic,  educational,  occupational,  and  clinical 
queries,  along  with  a  battery  of  screening  instruments, 
including  a  modified  version  of  the  BAARS-IV,  the  AQ, 
the  EQ,  and  ALS-18.  Patients  underwent  a  comprehen-
sive  psychiatric  examination  conducted  by  experienced 
psychiatrists  in  our  department,  exploring  the  potential 
presence  and  pervasiveness  of  suspected  neurodevelop-
mental  conditions,  as  well  as  the  co-occurrence  of  psy-
chopathology.  Whenever  feasible,  family  members  were 
consulted for both current and lifetime symptomatology. 
If  necessary,  patients  were  directed  to  other  members 
of  the  multidisciplinary  team  or  subjected  to  laboratory 
assessments.  The  semi-structured  interview  DIVA  was 
universally  administered,  while  the  ADOS  and  ADI-R 
were  selectively  employed  for  more  complex  cases.  The 
ultimate  diagnosis  concerning  the  presence  of  ADHD 
and/or  ASD  emerged  from  a  consensus  meeting  of  the 
multidisciplinary  team,  grounded  in  the  DSM-5  criteria 
and informed by a comprehensive review of all available 
information.

Participants

The  sample  consisted  of  300  participants  (male = 188), 
aged  between  18  and  69  years  (M = 31.1,  SD = 10.51).  A 
total of 174 subjects (58%) were diagnosed with ADHD, 
68 (22.7%) with ASD, and 58 (19.3%) with ADHD + ASD. 
Among the entire cohort diagnosed with ADHD, sole or

p = 0.067).

Measures of ADHD and ASD dimensions and ALS
Barkley adult ADHD rating Scale-IV (BAARS-IV; [32])

A  modified  version  of  the  BAARS-IV  was  employed  for 
the  evaluation  of  self-reported  ADHD  traits.  This  ques-
tionnaire,  consisting  of  18  items,  appraises  the  DSM-IV 
criteria for ADHD and incorporates clinical response and 
recovery cutoffs established on population-based norms. 
The BAARS-IV demonstrates satisfactory levels of inter-
nal  consistency,  test–retest  reliability,  as  well  as  robust 
construct  and  discriminant  validity.  It  encompasses  18 
items  each  for  assessing  current  behavior  (within  the 
last  6  months)  and  childhood  behavior  (for  ages  5–12), 
utilizing  a  four-point  rating  scale  (0,  1,  2,  3).  A  score  of 

two or higher indicates the presence of a symptom. Nine 
items pertain to evaluating inattentive features, while the 
remaining  nine  assess  hyperactive/impulsive  features. 
Higher  scores  indicate  more  severe  symptomatology.  In 
the  context  of  our  study,  we  categorized  hyperactivity/
impulsivity  items  into  two  distinct  subscales:  impulsiv-
ity (four items) and hyperactivity (five items). The ADHD 
trait  subscales  considered  for  analysis  encompass  inat-
tention  for  ages  5–12  (scoring  between  0  and  9  points), 
hyperactivity  for  ages  5–12  (scoring  between  0  and  5 
points),  impulsivity  for  ages  5–12  (scoring  between  0 
and  4  points),  inattention  in  the  last  6  months  (scor-
ing  between  0  and  9  points),  hyperactivity  in  the  last  6 
months (scoring between 0 and 5 points), impulsivity in 
the last 6 months (scoring between 0 and 4 points), total 
score  for  ages  5–12  (scoring  between  0  and  18  points), 
and total score for the last 6 months (scoring between 0 
and  18  points).  Based  on  our  previous  research  [13]  in 
Greek population, Cronbach’s α for all subscales has been 
found to be between 0.70 and 0.91.

Autism spectrum quotient (AQ; [33])

The AQ was initially designed to identify ASD in adults 
without intellectual developmental disorder. Comprising 
50  items,  with  10  items  per  subscale,  participants  rated 
each statement on a four-point Likert scale (1—“strongly 
agree,” 
3—“slightly  disagree,” 
agree,” 
4—“strongly disagree”). The total AQ score and five sub-
scale scores [social skills, attention switching, attention to 
detail, communication, and imagination] were computed 

2—“slightly

using  the  relevant  key.  Higher  scores  indicate  more 
severe symptomatology. Woodbury-Smith and colleagues 
[34] were the pioneers in assessing the AQ’s potential as 
a screening tool in clinical practice, concluding its strong 
predictive  ability  for  diagnosing  ASD  in  adults  without 
intellectual  developmental  disorder.  However,  doubts 
were raised [35] about the AQ’s utility in predicting ASD 
caseness  in  patients  attending  an  adult  ASD  diagnostic 
service, particularly when relying on the total AQ score. 
Subsequently,  another  study  [36]  conducted  a  more 
recent  analysis  suggesting  favorable  measurement  prop-
erties of the AQ, with adequate sensitivity and specificity 
to differentiate individuals with ASD from those without. 
Nonetheless,  they  emphasized  that  the  AQ  cannot  be 
considered a unidimensional measurement. In our study, 
we included the following five AQ subscales in the analy-
sis: social skills, attention switching, attention to details, 
communication,  imagination,  along  with  the  total  AQ 
score. Based on our previous research [13] in Greek pop-
ulation,  Cronbach’s  α  for  most  subscales  and  total  score 
range  between  0.73  and  0.84,  demonstrating  adequate 
internal consistency.

Empathy quotient (EQ; [37])

The  Empathy  Quotient  (EQ)  serves  as  a  self-assess-
ment  tool  designed  to  gauge  empathy  in  adults  without 
intellectual  developmental  disorder,  adopting  either  a 
one-factor  or  a  three-factor  dimension  (e.g  [38–40]).,. 
Comprising  40  questions  that  probe  empathic  tenden-
cies  and  20  filter  items,  participants  provide  responses 
on  a  four-point  Likert  scale,  yielding  scores  within  the 
range of 0 to 80 points. Diminished EQ scores, indicative 
of  empathy  deficits  have  been  repeatedly  demonstrated 
for  individuals  with  ASD  compared  to  typical  controls 
(e.g  [41]).,.  Notably,  the  EQ  exhibits  an  inverse  corre-
lation  with  the  AQ  [42].  Validation  of  the  EQ  has  been 
conducted  within  a  Greek  adult  population,  affirming 
robust psychometric properties, and endorsing both the 
one-  and  three-factor  models  [43].  Based  on  our  previ-
ous research [13], Cronbach’s α for the Greek EQ version 
has been found to present adequate internal consistency 
(α = 0.71).

Affective lability Scale - Short form [44]

The  ALS-18  is  constructed  on  a  three-factor  model 
assessing  affective  lability,  capturing  swift  transitions 
from  a  euthymic  mood  to  alternative  emotional  states 
such as elation, depression, and anger. Generally regarded 
as  a  measure  of  temperament,  respondents  rate  the 
extent to which each item reflects their emotional experi-
ences during the preceding week on a scale ranging from 
very uncharacteristic of me to very characteristic of me, 
scored from 0 to 3. The ALS-18 yields a total score (rang-
ing from 0 to 54) and encompasses three subscale scores: 

Anxiety/Depression (ranging from 0 to 15), Depression/
Elation (ranging from 0 to 24), and Anger (ranging from 
0  to  15).  Higher  scores  indicate  more  severe  symptom-
atology.  The  Greek  version  of  the  ALS-18  demonstrates 
robust  psychometric  properties,  exhibiting  commend-
able  internal  consistency,  reliability,  as  well  as  concur-
rent and discriminative validity. Notably, it manifests an 
elevated  score  in  individuals  with  neurodevelopmental 
conditions [28].

Statistical analysis

Statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS-28®.  We 
visually  inspected  histograms  to  evaluate  normal  dis-
tributions  of  variables.  We  used  chi-square  test  for  the 
comparison  of  proportions,  while  one-way  analysis  of 
variance (ANOVA) was employed for assessing continu-
ous  variables  across  the  three  study  groups.  To  mitigate 
type  I  errors  stemming  from  multiple  testing,  Tukey’s 
HSD  test  was  applied  as  a  post-hoc  analysis  following 
ANOVA  to  test  for  all  pairwise  differences.  Addition-
ally,  multiple  logistic  regression  analyses,  employing  a 
forward  stepwise  method,  with  removal  and  entry  cri-
teria  set  at  p-values  of  0.1  and  0.05,  respectively,  were 
conducted to identify variables differentiating the inves-
tigated  neurodevelopmental  conditions.  Odds  ratios, 
with  95%  confidence  intervals,  were  computed  from 
these logistic regression analyses. We performed a series 
of  multiple  stepwise  logistic  regression  analyses  with 
dependent variables that were used to define the groups 
with  different  neurodevelopmental  conditions.  All  key 
assumptions for logistic regression were met. Linearity in 
the logit was assessed using the Box-Tidwell test, multi-
collinearity was evaluated based on Standard Errors, and 
model  fit  was  confirmed  using  the  Hosmer-Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit test. All reported p-values are two-tailed, 
with statistical significance set at p ≤ 0.05.

Total Scores and all sub scores in both 5–12 years (past) 
and  last  6  months  (current)  scales  in  the  ADHD  group 
were significantly higher compared to the ASD group. In 
the 5–12 years BAARS IV Hyperactivity and 5–12 years 
Impulsivity  sub  scales,  score  was  significantly  higher  in 
the ADHD + ASD group compared to the ASD group. No 
significant  difference  in  the  5–12  years  BAARS-IV  Inat-
tention subscale was observed between the ADHD + ASD 
and ASD groups.

In  the  last  6  months  BAARS-IV  Hyperactivity  and 
Impulsivity  subscales,  scores  were  significantly  higher 
in the ADHD + ASD group compared to the ASD group. 
Additionally,  a  trend  towards  significance  was  observed 
for  the  last  6  months  BAARS-IV  Inattention  subscale

Stepwise logistic regression for group differentiation 
(Table 5)

A  series  of  stepwise  logistic  regressions  were  run  to 
determine  which  of  the  ASD  &  ADHD  traits  measures 
and  the  ALS  subscales  (distinct  subscales  and  total 
scores)  would  best  discriminate  between  ASD,  ADHD, 
and  ADHD + ASD  groups. The  variables  included  in  the 
stepwise  logistic  regression  models  were:  BAARS-IV 
inattention (5–12 years), BAARS-IV hyperactivity (5–12 
years),  BAARS-IV  impulsivity  (5–12  years),  BAARS-
IV  inattention  (last  6  months),  BAARS-IV  hyperactivity 
(last  6  months),  BAARS-IV  impulsivity  (last  6  months), 
BAARS-IV  total  score  (5–12  years),  BAARS-IV  total 
score  (last  6  months),  AQ  social  skills,  AQ  attention 
switching,  AQ  attention  to  detail,  AQ  communication, 
AQ imagination, AQ total score, EQ total score, ALS-18 
total  score,  ALS-18  anxiety/depression,  ALS-18  depres-
sion/elevation, and ALS-18 anger.

ADHD vs. ASD  Results showed (see Table 5) that BAARS 
IV  past  total  score,  current  Inattention,  AQ  total  score, 
and EQ total score could discriminate ADHD participants 
from ASD participants. The odds ratios represent the like-
lihood of being in the ASD group (coded as 1) relative to 
the ADHD group (coded as 0) for each predictor. As seen 
in Table 5, for every one-unit increase in BAARS IV past 
total  score,  the  odds  of  being  placed  in  the  ASD  group 
decrease by 12%. For every one-unit increase in BAARS

IV  current  Inattention,  the  odds  of  being  placed  in  the 
ASD group decrease by 25%. For every one-unit increase 
in  EQ  total  score,  the  odds  of  being  placed  in  the  ASD 
group  decrease  by  5%.  Conversely,  for  every  one-unit 
increase in AQ total score, the odds of being placed in the 
ASD group increase by 10%.

ADHD  vs.  ADHD + ASD  Results  showed  (see  Table  5) 
that BAARS IV past total score, AQ total score, and ALS 
Anger could discriminate ADHD participants from those 
having ADHD + ASD. The odds ratios represent the like-
lihood  of  being  in  the  ADHD + ASD  group  (coded  as  1) 
relative  to  the  ADHD  group  (coded  as  0)  for  each  pre-
dictor. As seen in Table 5 for every one-unit increase in 
BAARS  IV  past  total  score,  the  odds  of  being  placed  in 
the  ADHD + ASD  group  decrease  by  16%.  Conversely, 
for every one-unit increase in AQ total score, the odds of 
being placed in the ADHD + ASD group increase by 20%. 
Finally,  for  every  one-unit  increase  in  ALS  Anger  sub-
scale, the odds of being placed in the ADHD + ASD group 
increase by 10%.

ASD vs. ADHD + ASD  Results showed (see Table 5) that 
BAARS  IV  current  total  score  and  EQ  total  score  were 
found  to  significantly  discriminate  between  ASD  and 
ADHD + ASD participants. The odds ratios represent the 
likelihood of belonging to the ADHD + ASD group (coded 
as  1)  compared  to  the  ASD  group  (coded  as  0)  for  each 
predictor. As seen in Table 5, for every one-unit increase 
in BAARS IV current total score, the odds of being placed 
in  the  ADHD + ASD  group  increase  by  20%.  For  every 
one-unit  increase  in  EQ  total  score,  the  odds  of  being 
placed in the ADHD + ASD group increase by 5%.

Discussion
In  our  investigation,  we  assessed  the  rate  of  co-occur-
rence  of  ADHD  and  ASD  in  patients  referred  to  an 
Adult  Neurodevelopmental  Department.  Additionally, 
we examined parameters of commonly used self-admin-
istered screening tools that facilitate clinicians in distin-
guishing  between  individuals  presenting  with  ADHD, 
ASD,  and  the  co-occurrence  of  ADHD + ASD.  Impor-
tantly, our study moved beyond the mere co-occurrence 
statistics  and  explored  the  nuanced  interplay  of  symp-
tomatology  traits  and  affective  lability.  While  previous 
research  [13]  concentrated  only  on  ADHD  and  ASD 
traits, the current research expanded this scope by inves-
tigating  the  potential  of  affective  lability  to  serve  as  an 
additional  discriminative  factor.  Our  findings  indicated 
that  the  ALS  Anger  subscale  significantly  differenti-
ated  ADHD + ASD  from  ADHD,  suggesting  that  anger-
related  affective  lability  may  be  an  important  emotional 
trait  in  co-occurring  cases.  Our  results  support  the 
notion  of  incorporating  emotional  dimensions  into  the 

Pehlivanidis et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:391 Page 8 of 14

diagnostic  framework,  aligning  with  recent  calls  for  a 
more  holistic  understanding  of  ADHD  [20,  22,  45,  46]. 
Our sample included individuals with a mix of diagnos-
tic backgrounds, some receiving their diagnoses in child-
hood,  while  others  were  diagnosed  for  the  first  time  in 
adulthood.  This  heterogeneity  underscores  the  growing 
recognition  of  ADHD  and  ASD  in  adults,  particularly 
as  these  neurodevelopmental  conditions  were  tradition-
ally  considered  to  be  limited  to  childhood.  Additionally, 
two other factors may further explain the late diagnoses. 
First, prior to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of ADHD was not 
permitted  if  a  diagnosis  of  ASD  was  present,  as  these 
conditions were considered mutually exclusive, with ASD 
superseding  ADHD  diagnostically.  Second,  the  overlap-
ping symptomatology of neurodevelopmental conditions 
may lead to diagnostic overshadowing, where the symp-
toms of one disorder mask those of the other, potentially 
delaying  the  identification  of  the  second  diagnosis  until 
adulthood.  Understanding 
individual  neurodevelop-
mental traits in first-time adult diagnoses has important 
implications for assessment, as adults may present differ-
ently from children and may be more reflective of adap-
tive strategies or compensatory behaviors developed over 
time.

Co-occurrence ADHD-ASD

In  the  present  study  among  300  adults  without  intellec-
tual  developmental  disorder,  it  was  observed  that  58% 
received  a  diagnosis  of  ADHD  exclusively,  22.7%  were 
diagnosed  solely  with  ASD,  and  19.3%  received  a  dual 
diagnosis of both ADHD and ASD. Within the subgroup 
of  232  individuals  diagnosed  with  ADHD,  25%  concur-
rently  met  the  criteria  for  ASD,  while  among  the  126 
subjects  diagnosed  with  ASD,  46%  fulfilled  the  criteria 
for  co-occurring  ADHD.  The  rate  of  co-occurrence  was 
even higher compared to our previous study [13] with a 
different  sample  consisting  of  238  newly  diagnosed  par-
ticipants.  In  that  sample,  63.4%  of  patients  were  diag-
nosed with ADHD, 24.4% with ASD and 12.2% with both 
ADHD  and  ASD.  Of  the  total  number  of  180  patients 
who received an ADHD diagnosis either as a sole or co-
occurring diagnosis, 16.1% received a co-occurring ASD 
diagnosis  while  of  the  87  subjects  diagnosed  with  ASD, 
33.3%  fulfilled  the  criteria  for  an  ADHD  diagnosis.  Dif-
ferences could be attributed to the fact that newly diag-
nosed patients may demonstrate less severe ASD and/or 
ADHD features.

Our findings align with previous research findings indi-
cating  heightened  levels  of  ADHD  features  in  individu-
als  with  ASD  and,  conversely,  elevated  yet  lower  rates 
of ASD features in those with ADHD. More specifically, 
a  study  [47]  reported  a  similar  trend,  with  19.2%  over-
lap  between  ASD  and  ADHD  among  260  consecutively 
assessed  adults.  In  a  naturalistic  study  within  an  adult 

psychiatric population, 37% of the 84 patients diagnosed 
with ASD met the criteria for co-occurring ADHD [48]. 
Previous  research  [49]  found  that  43%  of  122  adult  out-
patients with ASD received a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. 
Another study [50] reported that, among 31 adults with 
ASD  and  average  intellectual  function,  36.7%  met  the 
DSM-IV  criteria  for  current  ADHD  “caseness”.  Simi-
lar findings [6] noted that up to 40% of adults with ASD 
exhibit features of ADHD. However, a retrospective case 
review [51] suggested a lower rate of co-occurring ADHD 
in  ASD  adults,  with  only  9.7%  meeting  ICD-10  criteria 
for both conditions; the authors acknowledged potential 
bias,  as  an  ADHD  clinic  in  the  same  facility  might  have 
diverted referrals away from the ASD clinic.

Conversely,  a  study  [14]  investigated  co-occurrence  in 
ADHD adults and reported that over 10% of the clinical 
cohort had a current or past diagnosis of ASD, indicating 
a  noteworthy  association  between  the  two  conditions. 
In a clinical sample of 53 adults with ADHD [17], 15.1% 
of  the  individuals  were  diagnosed  with  ASD,  and  18.9% 
scored  higher  than  32  on  the  AQ.  Evidence  [16]  from  a 
non-clinical  sample  of  334  adults  showed  a  significant 
correlation  between  ADHD  and  ASD  traits,  especially 
between inattention and social and communication skill 
deficits.  A  study  [15]  that  examined  ASD  features  in  56 
adults with ADHD using the ADOS-2 found that ADHD-
ASD  symptom  overlap  was  identified  in  20%  of  them, 
especially  in  dysfunctional  reciprocal  social  interaction 
and communication.

Our  findings  support  the  hypothesis  that  diagnostic 
categories  of  ADHD  and  ASD  may  not  distinctly  align 
with  separate  underlying  mechanisms  or  dysfunctions 
[18,  19].  There  is  a  need  for  a  dimensional  framework 
that  examines  neurodevelopmental  domains  across  tra-
ditional  diagnostic  boundaries.  Although  ADHD  and 
ASD  are  distinct  diagnoses,  a  dimensional  approach 
that considers them on a spectrum may provide valuable 
insights into why ADHD traits are more frequently diag-
nosed in ASD populations than the reverse. Specifically, 
ADHD and ASD share some overlapping characteristics 
[1], such as challenges with executive function, attention 
regulation,  and  social-emotional  processing.  However, 
ASD  encompasses  a  broader  and  more  complex  neuro-
developmental  profile,  with  social  and  communication 
challenges  often  central  to  its  presentation  [1].  Within 
this  broader  ASD  profile,  traits  commonly  associated 
with ADHD—such as impulsivity, inattention, and affec-
tive  lability—may  be  readily  observed  and  identified  as 
clinically  significant.  Thus,  individuals  with  ASD  may 
more  frequently  meet  diagnostic  criteria  for  ADHD,  as 
these traits can appear as extensions of or intensifications 
within  their  broader  neurodevelopmental  profile.  Con-
versely,  the  traits  that  are  unique  to  ASD—such  as  defi-
cits in social reciprocity, focused interests, and repetitive 

Pehlivanidis et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:391 Page 9 of 14

behaviors [1]—may not be as readily identified within the 
ADHD  profile.  Adults  with  ADHD,  who  often  present 
without  significant  social  or  communicative  difficulties, 
are  probably  less  likely  to  meet  the  broader  and  socially 
oriented criteria for ASD, contributing to the asymmetry 
in co-occurrence rates between the two diagnoses.

This  dimensional  perspective  supports  the  utility  of 
assessing  ADHD  and  ASD  traits  with  measures  like  the 
BAARS,  AQ,  EQ,  and  ALS,  which  allow  for  a  continu-
ous evaluation of symptomology across both conditions. 
Such tools capture the gradations of neurodevelopmental 
traits  that  are  often  present  in  co-occurring  ADHD  and 
ASD, aiding in differentiating between ADHD, ASD, and 
their overlap.

BAARS IV dimensions

Patients  diagnosed  with  ADHD  exhibited  significantly 
higher  scores  in  the  self-report  ADHD  features  in  com-
parison  to  those  diagnosed  with  ASD,  as  anticipated. 
However, their symptom scores did not surpass those of 
individuals diagnosed with ADHD + ASD. The same was 
found  for  all  ADHD  trait  subscales  (see  Table  2a&2b). 
Results  from  stepwise  logistic  regression  (see  Table  5) 
show  that  the  ADHD  measures  that  served  as  discrimi-
nant factors between ADHD and ASD were the BAARS 
IV past total score (at ages 5–12) and BAARS IV current 
Inattention (in the last 6 months). Higher BAARS IV past 
total scores decrease the odds of being in the ASD group. 
Similarly,  higher  BAARS  IV  current  Inattention  scores 
decrease  the  odds  of  being  in  the  ASD  group. This  sug-
gests that early manifestations of ADHD traits and recent 
attentional  difficulties  could  help  distinguish  the  two 
neurodevelopmental conditions. This finding also under-
scores the importance of considering both historical and 
current  symptomatology  in  differential  diagnosis.  The 
persistence  of  ADHD  traits  from  childhood  into  adult-
hood  provides  a  strong  historical  indicator  suggesting 
that  childhood  ADHD  features  often  continue  to  affect 
individuals  later  in  life.  The  prominence  of  recent  inat-
tention, a core characteristic of ADHD, in differentiating 
the two groups suggests that in ASD inattention may be 
more  situational.  The  emphasis  on  current  inattention 
also underscores the relevance of recent symptomatology 
in  understanding  the  current  impact  of  the  conditions 
on patients’ functioning. This understanding can inform 
more targeted intervention strategies.

Furthermore,  the  BAARS  IV  past  total  score  (at 
ages  5–12)  could  discriminate  ADHD  patients  from 
ADHD + ASD  patients.  Higher  BAARS  IV  past  total 
scores  decrease  the  odds  of  being  in  the  ADHD + ASD 
group.  This  finding  suggests  that  the  severity  or  nature 
of  childhood  ADHD  features  varies  between  these 
groups,  providing  critical  insights  for  differential  diag-
nosis. Individuals with ADHD alone may exhibit a more 

straightforward  and  consistent  profile  of  childhood  fea-
tures,  such  as  pronounced  patterns  of  hyperactivity, 
impulsivity, and inattention. In contrast, the presence of 
ASD in ADHD + ASD patients can modify or obscure the 
presentation  of  these  features,  resulting  in  a  more  com-
plex  clinical  picture.  Research  indicates  that  ASD  can 
influence  how  ADHD  features  manifest.  For  example, 
ASD  traits  such  as  social  communication  difficulties, 
focused  interests,  and  sensory  sensitivities  may  interact 
with ADHD features, potentially altering their expression 
(e.g  [52,  53]).,.  Children  with  co-occurring  ADHD  and 
ASD  may  show  different  attentional  patterns,  often  due 
to focused interests or hyperfocus on specific tasks asso-
ciated  with  ASD,  which  can  sometimes  mask  or  mimic 
inattentiveness typically seen in ADHD (e.g [52]).,. Addi-
tionally,  repetitive  behaviors  and  focused  interests  asso-
ciated with ASD may make hyperactivity and impulsivity 
less immediately obvious, as the behaviors might appear 
more structured or routine-driven compared to the more 
erratic,  spontaneous  activity  seen  in  ADHD  alone  (e.g 
[54]).,. Distinguishing between ADHD and ADHD + ASD 
is  vital  for  developing  tailored  support  strategies  that 
address the unique needs of each group.

The BAARS IV current total score (in the last 6 months) 
was found to be a discriminant factor between ASD and 
ADHD + ASD  patients.  Higher  BAARS  IV  current  total 
scores  increase  the  odds  of  being  in  the  ADHD + ASD 
group. This finding underscores the importance of recent 
symptomatology  in  distinguishing  between  these  neu-
rodevelopmental  conditions.  Recent  ADHD  traits  may 
reflect  differences  in  symptom  severity  or  presentation 
between ASD and ADHD + ASD patients.

In  our  previous  study  [13]  with  subjects  who  received 
for  the  first  time  in  their  lives  an  ADHD  or/and  ASD 
diagnosis,  the  subscales  Inattention  and  Impulsiv-
ity  in  the  last  6  months  were  the  discriminating  factors 
between ADHD and ASD patients. Also, current impul-
sivity and past hyperactivity discriminated ADHD + ASD 
from  ASD  subjects.  The  fact  that  current  symptomatol-
ogy seemed to be of greater value in that newly diagnosed 
sample  might  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  apparently 
their  symptomatology  had  never  been  so  prominent 
in  the  past.  Also,  in  that  sample  which  had  mild  symp-
tomatology,  it  might  have  been  easier  to  report  features 
of  hyperactivity  that  would  be  disturbing  in  various  cir-
cumstances  during  childhood,  than  deficits  in  attention. 
Finally,  a  recall  bias  could  contribute  to  this  finding,  as 
individuals  receiving  their  first  diagnosis  may  underre-
port childhood symptoms due to uncertainty about their 
neurodevelopmental  history.  In  contrast,  those  with  a 
prior diagnosis of ASD and/or ADHD may be more likely 
to recall and report symptoms from childhood that align 
with their known condition.

AQ dimensions

Total  score  and  all  AQ  sub  scores  in  the  ADHD  group 
were  significantly  lower  compared  to  the  ASD  group, 
as  expected.  Furthermore,  all  AQ  sub  scores  in  the 
ADHD  group  were  significantly  lower  compared  to  the 
ADHD + ASD  group.  No  significant  difference  in  AQ 
sub  scores  was  found  between  ASD  and  ADHD + ASD 
groups.  Stepwise  logistic  regression  analysis  demon-
strated  that  AQ  total  score  discriminated  ADHD  and 
ASD  patients  as  well  as  ADHD  and  ADHD + ASD 
patients.  Higher  AQ  total  scores  increase  the  odds  of 
being in the ASD group compared to the ADHD group. 
Similarly,  higher  AQ  total  scores  increase  the  odds  of 
being in the ADHD + ASD group compared to the ADHD 
group.  This  finding  highlights  the  relevance  of  autism 
spectrum traits in differentiating between these neurode-
velopmental conditions. The AQ assesses various features 
associated  with  ASD,  including  social  communication 
difficulties  and  focused  interests,  which  may  distinguish 
ASD  patients  from  those  with  ADHD.  ASD  patients 
may  exhibit  significantly  higher  AQ  scores  compared  to 
ADHD patients due to the presence of more pronounced 
autistic  traits.  ASD  patients  for  instance  exhibit  signifi-
cantly  higher  scores  on  AQ  subscales  related  to  social 
skills and communication, reflecting their core deficits in 
these areas compared to ADHD patients.

EQ dimensions

Total score in the ADHD group was significantly higher 
compared  to  the  ASD  group  but  not  compared  to  the 
ADHD + ASD group. The ADHD + ASD group presented 
a significantly higher score compared to the ASD group. 
Total  EQ  score  was  indicated  as  a  significant  discrimi-
nant  measure  between  ASD  and  ADHD  participants, 
as  well  as  between  ASD  and  ADHD + ASD  participants. 
Higher EQ total scores decrease the odds of being in the 
ASD  group  compared  to  the  ADHD  group.  Similarly, 
higher EQ total scores increase the odds of being in the 
ADHD + ASD  group  compared  to  the  ASD  group.  Indi-
viduals  with  ASD  are  often  characterized  by  deficits  in 
empathy,  which  may  manifest  as  significantly  lower  EQ 
scores compared to those with ADHD or ADHD + ASD. 
These results might indicate that the presence of ADHD 
traits,  particularly  inattention  and  impulsivity,  modu-
lates  social  cognition  in  individuals  with  co-occurring 
ASD  and  ADHD.  One  possible  explanation  is  that  indi-
viduals  with  ADHD,  and  those  with  ADHD + ASD,  may 
exhibit higher social motivation and more frequent social 
interactions  than  individuals  with  ASD  alone.  Addition-
ally,  it  is  possible  that  individuals  with  ADHD + ASD 
develop compensatory strategies, such as social masking 
or  learned  social  scripts,  which  could  partially  account 
for  their  relatively  higher  EQ  scores  compared  to  the 
ASD  group.  Another  factor  to  consider  is  the  role  of 

impulsivity in self-reported empathy, as individuals with 
ADHD  may  overestimate  their  empathic  abilities  due  to 
difficulties  in  self-awareness  [55].  Future  studies  inte-
grating  objective  measures  of  social  cognition,  such  as 
performance-based  tasks  or  behavioral  assessments, 
would  provide  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of 
how  empathy  manifests  in  ADHD,  ASD,  and  their  co-
occurrence.  Recognizing  these  differences  in  empathy 
levels can enhance the specificity of ASD diagnoses and 
inform tailored support interventions. Interventions tar-
geting  empathy  development  may  be  particularly  ben-
eficial for individuals with ASD, whereas ADHD-focused 
interventions  may  prioritize  other  symptom  domains, 
such as impulsivity, inattention, or emotional regulation, 
where  evidence  for  targeted  approaches  is  more  estab-
lished.  This  distinction  does  not  diminish  the  potential 
value  of  empathy-focused  interventions  for  individuals 
with  ADHD + ASD  but  reflects  the  current  emphasis  on 
addressing primary areas of functional impairment asso-
ciated  with  ADHD  traits.  Further  research  is  needed  to 
explore effective interventions tailored specifically for the 
co-occurrence of ASD and ADHD.

ALS dimensions

The  ADHD  group  presented  a  significantly  higher  total 
score  compared  to  the  ASD  group  but  a  significantly 
lower  total  score  compared  to  the  ADHD + ASD  group. 
The  ASD  group  presented  a  significantly  lower  score 
compared  to  the  ADHD + ASD  group.  No  significant 
differences  were  found  among  the  groups  for  the  sub-
scale  Anxiety-Depression.  The  ASD  group  scored  sig-
nificantly  lower  in  the  sub  scale  Depression-Elation 
compared  to  the  ADHD + ASD  group.  Individuals  with 
ASD may exhibit less variability in mood swings or affec-
tive  states  related  to  depression  and  elation.  This  could 
be  attributed  to  the  characteristic  rigidity  or  stability  in 
mood expression often seen in individuals with ASD. The 
lower  scores  observed  in  the  ASD  group  alone  may  not 
necessarily  reflect  reduced  emotional  lability  but  could 
stem  from  difficulties  identifying  and  describing  their 
own  emotions,  a  known  challenge  in  ASD  often  linked 
to  alexithymia  [56].  Alexithymia  can  limit  the  ability  to 
recognize  and  articulate  internal  emotional  experiences, 
resulting in underreported symptoms despite the poten-
tial  presence  of  significant  mood  variability.  The  higher 
total ALS score in the ADHD + ASD group compared to 
the ADHD group suggests a possible cumulative effect of 
both  conditions,  where  the  impulsivity  and  rapid  mood 
shifts  of  ADHD  may  interact  with  the  internal  sensitiv-
ity  and  sensory  overwhelm  typical  of  ASD,  produc-
ing  greater  overall  emotional  lability.  The  ADHD  group 
score  was  significantly  higher  compared  to  the  ASD 
group in the Anger subscale but significantly lower com-
pared to the ADHD + ASD group. The ASD group scored 

Pehlivanidis et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:391 Page 11 of 14

significantly lower in the Anger subscale compared to the 
ADHD + ASD group. The significantly higher score in the 
ADHD group may be consistent with the Impulsive and 
reactive  nature  often  associated  with  ADHD,  aligning 
with  recent  evidence  [57]  that  suggested  an  association 
between  ADHD  and  dysregulated  emotional  experi-
ences  by  connecting  these  two  distinct  aspects  of  Emo-
tion-Related Impulsivity. The significantly lower score in 
the  ASD  group  might  be  indicative  of  the  characteristic 
social communication challenges in ASD that may mask 
the expression of anger. The ADHD + ASD group’s signifi-
cantly higher score may suggest an additive effect of both 
conditions, resulting in increased anger expression com-
pared to each condition alone.

Results  from  the  stepwise  logistic  regression  showed 
that  the  ALS  Anger  subscale  was  a  significant  discrimi-
nant  factor  between  ADHD  and  ADHD + ASD  groups. 
Higher  ALS  Anger  subscale  scores  increase  the  odds  of 
being in the ADHD + ASD group compared to the ADHD 
group. This observed significance underscores the poten-
tial  relevance  of  affective  dysregulation,  particularly  in 
anger expression, in distinguishing these clinical popula-
tions.  The  ALS  Anger  subscale  specifically  captures  the 
intensity  and  variability  of  anger  responses,  reflecting 
a  dimension  of  affective  dysregulation.  This  finding  is 
particularly  relevant  given  that  anger  dysregulation  has 
been associated with underlying impulsive tendencies in 
ADHD, often manifesting as an immediate, high-arousal 
response to perceived frustration or restriction. Individu-
als with ADHD frequently experience intense and rapidly 
fluctuating anger, likely due to the difficulties in impulse 
control and emotional regulation commonly reported in 
this population [58]. When ADHD co-occurs with ASD, 
however, additional emotional and social-cognitive com-
plexities emerge that may intensify these anger responses. 
Anger might serve as a significant discriminant factor in 
ADHD + ASD  because  the  co-occurrence  of  these  con-
ditions  introduces  a  unique  constellation  of  emotional 
regulation difficulties, with ASD traits compounding the 
dysregulation already present in ADHD. Individuals with 
ASD  may  often  experience  challenges  in  recognizing, 
interpreting,  and  expressing  emotions,  which  can  lead 
to  an  accumulation  of  emotional  tension.  When  these 
ASD-related traits intersect with the impulsive and reac-
tive emotional tendencies of ADHD, the result may be an 
amplified  or  more  outwardly  expressed  anger  response. 
Thus, anger may become a more dominant or observable 
feature in the ADHD + ASD profile, reflecting a complex 
interplay  between  impulsivity,  emotional  reactivity,  and 
social-cognitive  processing  challenges.  The  ALS  Anger 
subscale  captures  the  intensity  and  frequency  of  anger 
responses, providing a window into this heightened emo-
tional  reactivity.  In  individuals  with  both  ADHD  and 
ASD, anger may reflect not only difficulties in emotional 

modulation but also an underlying frustration with social 
or environmental expectations, which can be particularly 
pronounced  in  ASD.  Consequently,  these  individuals 
may display a more pronounced pattern of anger-driven 
affective lability, complicating the diagnostic picture and 
underscoring  the  need  for  careful  assessment  of  anger-
related  traits  when  differentiating  ADHD + ASD  from 
ADHD alone.

Given  these  findings,  our  study  suggests  that  anger-
related affective lability may be a key emotional marker in 
ADHD + ASD  cases,  potentially  aiding  clinicians  in  rec-
ognizing co-occurring presentations that require tailored 
interventions.  Future  studies  should  further  explore  the 
specific mechanisms by which anger variability differen-
tiates ADHD + ASD from ADHD and examine how these 
traits  influence  adaptive  functioning  in  various  settings. 
Additionally,  it  is  important  to  consider  alexithymia,  a 
trait  commonly  observed  in  individuals  with  ASD,  as  a 
potential  confounding  factor  in  self-reported  emotional 
experiences,  as  it  may  influence  how  individuals  with 
ASD  and  ADHD + ASD  perceive  and  report  their  emo-
tional states, including anger. Future research integrating 
alexithymia  assessments  alongside  measures  of  affective 
lability could provide a more comprehensive understand-
ing of emotional dysregulation patterns in these neurode-
velopmental conditions.

In  clinical  settings,  psychometric  tools  for  assessing 
affective lability, such as the ALS-18, alongside other self-
reported screeners, may play an important role in guiding 
targeted  interventions.  By  capturing  specific  emotional 
traits,  these  tools  allow  clinicians  to  identify  individual 
symptom profiles. This approach facilitates the develop-
ment  of  tailored  interventions  that  address  the  unique 
emotional and behavioral needs of each patient, enhanc-
ing  support  relevance  and  efficacy.  Future  research 
should  continue  exploring  how  self-reported  screeners 
can support precision in support planning for adults with 
ASD, ADHD, and their co-occurrence.

Limitations

Current  results  should  be  cautiously  interpreted  in  the 
light of limitations and have limited generalizability. The 
cross-sectional design restricts our ability to infer causal-
ity  or  trace  developmental  trajectories,  highlighting  the 
need  for  future  longitudinal  studies.  In  addition,  during 
the diagnostic process, some clinicians were not blind to 
certain  scales;  however,  all  were  blind  to  the  ALS  scale. 
As detailed in a previous publication from our team [30], 
diagnoses  are  made  following  a  thorough  psychiatric 
examination, based on DSM-5 criteria and integrating all 
necessary  information  from  a  multidisciplinary  team.  A 
potential  limitation  of  this  study  is  the  reliance  on  self-
report  measures,  which  may  be  limited  when  assess-
ing  childhood  features  retrospectively.  Additionally,  our 

Pehlivanidis et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:391 as 

such 

treatments, 

sample,  primarily  consisted  of  individuals  seeking  neu-
rodevelopmental  assessments, 
introducing  potential 
selection  bias.  This  may  have  led  to  an  overrepresenta-
tion  of  individuals  with  heightened  symptom  awareness 
or  a  perceived  need  for  formal  diagnosis,  which  could 
have  influenced  the  observed  patterns  of  affective  labil-
ity and self-reported features. Consequently, the findings 
may not fully generalize to individuals with undiagnosed 
or  less  pronounced  ADHD  or  ASD  features  who  are 
not  seeking  clinical  evaluations.  Future  research  should 
include  more  diverse  populations  and  consider  factors 
such  as  socioeconomic  background  and  cultural  influ-
ences  to  enhance  the  generalizability  of  our  findings. 
Furthermore,  features  of  anxiety  and  depression  may 
have influenced ALS-18 and EQ scoring, although acute 
psychopathology  requiring  urgent  psychiatric  support 
was an exclusion criterion for participation in the study. 
The medication status of participants at the time of com-
pleting self-report questionnaires was also not reported. 
Pharmacological 
antidepres-
sants,  mood  stabilizers,  or  stimulants,  could  influence 
self-reported  symptoms,  particularly  affective  lability. 
Although  our  findings  indicate  that  the  anger  subscale 
of  the  ALS-18  significantly  differentiates  between  the 
ADHD + ASD  and  ADHD  groups  (among  other  vari-
ables),  these  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution. 
Affective  lability,  especially  anger,  may  be  influenced  by 
several  factors,  including  socioeconomic  status,  psy-
chiatric  co-occurrences,  and  psychotropic  treatments. 
Moreover,  alexithymia,  a  trait  particularly  common  in 
ASD,  may  have  impacted  participants’  ability  to  accu-
rately report emotional variability, potentially influencing 
ALS-18  scores.  Due  to  data  constraints,  these  variables 
were not included in the current analysis. Future studies 
would benefit from incorporating such factors to provide 
a more comprehensive understanding. While self-report 
questionnaires  effectively  capture  participants’  subjec-
tive experiences of affective lability, complementing them 
with objective assessments could offer further insight into 
the  underlying  mechanisms  contributing  to  mood  vari-
ability in these populations. Another potential limitation 
of  our  study  is  the  division  of  the  BAARS-IV  hyperac-
tivity/impulsivity  subscale  into  separate  impulsivity  and 
hyperactivity  subscales.  Although  this  subdivision  was 
intended  to  provide  a  more  granular  understanding  of 
symptom expression, it represents a study-specific adap-
tation.  Therefore,  findings  from  these  subscales  should 
be  interpreted  cautiously.  Additionally,  the  selective  use 
of ADI-R and ADOS-2 for ASD, guided by clinical judg-
ment rather than systematic administration, may be con-
sidered  a  limitation.  However,  all  diagnoses  were  made 
in accordance with DSM-5 criteria and standard clinical 
procedures,  within  a  multidisciplinary  framework.  Fur-
thermore,  we  did  not  include  ‘previous  diagnosis’  as  a 

Page 12 of 14

variable in the analysis due to potential biases related to 
diagnostic  timing  (e.g.,  childhood  vs.  adulthood),  differ-
ing  diagnostic  frameworks  (e.g.,  pre-DSM-5),  and  accu-
racy  of  self-reported  information.  As  a  cross-sectional 
study, our findings reflect assessments conducted within 
our national referral center, emphasizing current clinical 
profiles rather than diagnostic history.

Conclusions, implications for clinical practice, and future 
research

This  study  bridges  a  critical  gap  by  exploring  affective 
lability  in  the  context  of  co-occurring  ADHD  and  ASD. 
Our  findings  contribute  to  the  limited  literature  on 
the  emotional  dimensions  of  neurodevelopmental  co-
occurrences  in  adults,  emphasizing  the  need  for  further 
research to explore these interactions.

While  our  study  builds  upon  existing  knowledge,  it 
also  presents  novel  contributions  that  advance  the  field. 
By  employing  a  comprehensive  set  of  measures,  includ-
ing the BAARS-IV, AQ, EQ, and ALS-18, we offer a more 
nuanced  understanding  of  the  trait  dimensions  that  dif-
ferentiate  ADHD,  ASD,  and  their  co-occurrence.  In 
particular,  anger  features,  as  measured  by  the  ALS-18, 
emerged  as  a  useful  discriminator  between  adults  with 
ADHD and ADHD + ASD. This depth of analysis provides 
a richer framework for future research to build upon, set-
ting a precedent for incorporating emotional dimensions 
into the diagnostic criteria of neurodevelopmental condi-
tions especially ADHD and its co-occurrence with ASD.

Rather  than  advocating  for  its  use  as  a  stand-alone 
diagnostic  criterion,  we  propose  that  affective  labil-
ity  should  be  considered  as  part  of  a  broader,  multidi-
mensional  assessment  framework.  The  identification  of 
distinct  affective  profiles  across  neurodevelopmental 
conditions  underscores  the  need  for  clinicians  to  sys-
tematically  assess  emotional  instability  when  evaluating 
ADHD and ASD in adults.

Moreover, beyond its diagnostic implications, affective 
lability  may  represent  a  meaningful  therapeutic  target. 
Recent  evidence  suggests  that  interventions  targeting 
emotional instability—such as emotion regulation train-
ing, mindfulness-based therapies, and adapted cognitive-
behavioral  therapy—may  yield  substantial  benefits  for 
these  populations  [e.g.,  59].  Given  the  transdiagnostic 
nature  of  affective  lability,  future  studies  should  investi-
gate  its  relative  contribution  to  quality  of  life  and  func-
tional outcomes in comparison to core ADHD and ASD 
features.

The  distinctions  unveiled  in  our  study  hold  practical 
implications  for  clinicians  engaged  in  the  diagnosis  and 
management  of  adult  neurodevelopmental  conditions. 
The  inclusion  of  a  self-report  questionnaire  addressing 
emotional  dysregulation  prior  to  a  thorough  psychiatric 
examination for the assessment of adult ADHD, ASD and 

Pehlivanidis et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:391 Page 13 of 14

their co-occurrence may be helpful in the diagnostic pro-
cedure of these clinical entities. The identification of spe-
cific  trait  dimensions  that  differentiate  between  ADHD, 
ASD,  and  their  co-occurrence  provides  a  roadmap  for 
more  tailored  interventions.  Clinicians  can  leverage  this 
nuanced  understanding  to  develop  targeted  assessment 
tools and intervention strategies that address the unique 
needs  of  individuals  with  varying  neurodevelopmental 
profiles.
