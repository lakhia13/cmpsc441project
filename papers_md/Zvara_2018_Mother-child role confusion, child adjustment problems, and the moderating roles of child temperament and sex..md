Abstract

Role confusion is a deviation in the parent-child relationship such that a parent looks to a child to 
meet the parent’s emotional needs and abdicates, in part, the parental role in exchange for care, 
intimacy, or peer support from the child. In addition, a child may initiate role-confused behavior in 
order to gain closeness to a parent who is otherwise preoccupied by his or her own needs. The 
current study examined associations between mother-child role confusion at age 5 (coded role 
confusion from recorded free-play mother-child interactions) and teacher reports of internalizing 
and externalizing symptoms, and peer problems, at grade 1. The sample (N = 557) is from a 
longitudinal study of families in rural communities, the Family Life Project (FLP). Mother-child 
role confusion predicted internalizing symptoms and peer problems (but not externalizing 
symptoms) above and beyond other dimensions of maternal parenting (sensitivity and harsh 
intrusiveness), demographic factors, and prior levels of outcome variables. However, some effect 
sizes were small, making replication desirable. Temperament and child sex were important 
moderators: girls with difficult temperaments and boys with easy temperaments were more 
vulnerable to internalizing symptoms (but not externalizing symptoms or peer problems) in the 
context of role confusion. We discuss the singular importance of role confusion, a construct that 
has been largely unrecognized by developmental psychologists until recently, for behavioral 
outcomes of children as they transition into middle childhood.

An evolutionary tension often exists between a parent’s need to reproduce (in order to 
promote his or her genes on to the next generation) and an individual child’s need for 
nurturance in order to successfully develop, adapt, and reach the age of reproductive 
viability (Hrdy, 1999, 2009). Moreover, a parent has other needs such as the desire for care, 
intimacy, and companionship. Ideally, a parent had childhood needs for nurturance met by 
his or her parents and has current needs met primarily by romantic partners and other adults 
(Cox & Paley, 1997; Howes & Cicchetti, 1993). The parent is then able to focus time and 
effort on meeting the needs of his or her child. However, when a parent’s own needs- 
particularly emotional needs- remain unmet, it can lead him or her to look to the child to fill 
that void (for a review of this literature see Macfie, Brumariu, & Lyons-Ruth, 2015). Further, 
being dependent on a parent for physical and emotional security, a child is likely to comply 
or even initiate role confusion to achieve the closest relationship possible in these 
circumstances (Davis & Cummings, 1994)

Role confusion (also termed role reversal or boundary dissolution) is a shift in parent and 
child roles such that a parent abdicates all or part of the parental role in order to meet his or 
her own adult needs. Specifically, a child may, in part, take the role of parent 
(parentification), or a parent may behave in a seductive manner towards a child (seductive 
caregiving) or tell a child about his or her adult concerns (spousification). Finally, a parent 
may fail to set appropriate limits (e.g., squabble) as if he or she were the child’s peer 
(Bavolek & Keene, 1999; Jurkovic, 1998; Main, Kaplan, & Cassidy, 1985; Sroufe, 
Jacobvitz, Mangelsdorf, DeAngelo, & Ward, 1985; Vulliez-Coady, Obsuth, Torreiro-Casal, 
Ellertsdottir, & Lyons-Ruth, 2013)

Role confusion is a dyadic construct such that both parent and child may be active 
contributors to the dynamic. It differs from traditional parenting constructs, such as 
sensitivity or harshness, which assess only parent-driven behavior. For example, a child may 
assume the role of parent (parentification) by attempting to control the parent in a caregiving 
or punitive manner (Main et al., 1985). Although this may appear as a positive adaptation by 
the child during the toddlerhood period in which we often observe normative emergence of 
empathy and prosocial behaviors, it is often inappropriate for a child to bear these 
responsibilities at such a young age and may compromise other aspects of social and 
emotional experience and development (Zahn-Waxler & Radke-Yarrow, 1990). Controlling 
caregiving is an extension and sometimes co-occurring form of this inappropriate 
relationship dynamic and both forms of parentification behaviors are associated 
prospectively with internalizing and externalizing symptoms (O’Connor, Bureau, Mccartney, 
& Lyons-Ruth, 2011)

Although the roles of child as parent, spouse, or peer seem disparate, what they have in 
common is that their goal is to meet a parent’s needs instead of the child’s needs. The term 
“confusion” does not refer to a subjective sense of confusion, but rather it refers to an 
observer’s viewpoint (Vulliez-Coady et al., 2013). A child may perform functions that a 
parent usually performs for a child, or another adult usually performs for the parent. 
Although there has been little focus on role confusion in the developmental literature, there 
is evidence that it adversely affects child development into adulthood (Macfie et al., 2015),

and that it transmits from one generation to the next (Macfie, McElwain, Houts, & Cox, 
2005)

In the transition between kindergarten and first grade, perceived availability and support are 
more relevant for child-parent attachment than proximity (Bretherton, 1992). As children 
transition to formal schooling, they must navigate new relationships with teachers and peers 
and adjust to the demands of classroom routines (Pianta, Cox, & Snow, 2007). To do this, 
children need flexible emotion regulation and the ability to form healthy peer relationships. 
From a developmental psychopathology perspective (Cicchetti, 1984, 2013; Sroufe & Rutter, 
1984), failure to negotiate a series of inter-dependent tasks such as a secure attachment, 
emotion regulation, and peer relationships in early childhood, makes the development of 
psychopathology more likely. Role confusion may compromise successful adaptation during 
this period due to the parent’s inability to provide support for the child’s developing 
emotional and regulatory abilities while simultaneously demanding support from the child to 
meet their adult needs. Difficulties with emotion regulation, in conjunction with a parent 
seeking to keep the child close to meet the parent’s emotional needs, may further hamper the 
development of the child’s peer relationships and social adjustment. Both poor emotion 
regulation and impaired peer relationships may cause the transition to middle childhood and 
the context of formal schooling to be problematic

The aim of this study was to examine role confusion at age 5 years and its associations with 
internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and peer relationships at grade 1 while 
controlling for other parenting dimensions, demographics, and prior levels of outcome 
variables. In addition, child sex and temperament were examined as moderators of these 
associations.

The Effect of Role Confusion on a Child’s Emotion Regulation and Peer 

Relationships

Emotion regulation refers to a child’s ability to maintain optimal arousal for positive 
adaptation (Blair & Diamond, 2008). Emotion regulation begins developing during the first 
year of life, with rapid development thereafter (Kopp, 1982; Kopp & Neufeld, 2003; 
Rothbart & Bates, 2006; Bridgett, Burt, Edwards, & Deater-Deckard, 2015). Difficulties 
with emotion regulation in the preschool period predict current and future behavior problems 
at school age (Cole, Teti, & Zahn-Waxler, 2003). Emotion regulation may not develop 
adaptively if a parent is preoccupied with his or her own emotional needs at the expense of 
the child’s needs. Father-child role confusion in the toddler period predicted externalizing 
symptoms in kindergarten (Macfie, Houts, McElwain, & Cox, 2005), and role confusion 
with both parents in the toddler period predicted internalizing symptoms at age 7 (Jacobvitz, 
Hazen, Curran, & Hitchens, 2004). Furthermore, role confusion at ages 4 to 12 predicted 
both internalizing and externalizing symptoms two years later for children of divorce 
(Johnston, Gonzàlez, & Campbell, 1987). Thus, there is some support from longitudinal 
studies that role confusion adversely affects outcomes associated with emotion regulation 
abilities.

If a parent needs a child to stay close to help regulate the parent’s own emotions, the child 
may not have the opportunity to develop relationships with peers. Indeed, role confusion 
with mothers and fathers in the toddler period predicted peer problems in kindergarten 
(Macfie, Houts, et al., 2005). Moreover, role confusion with mothers at 42 months predicted 
difficulty with peer relationships (playing with a child of the opposite sex) at age 10 to 11. 
These children were more unpopular and less competent with peers (Sroufe, Bennett, 
Englund, Urban, & Shulman, 1993). However, prior studies on parent-child role confusion 
have limitations, including small sample sizes (N = 47 to N = 85). Furthermore, to our 
knowledge, none of these studies controlled for other aspects of parenting or prior levels of 
outcome variables in order to isolate the specific effect of role confusion, and none 
examined the moderating effects of temperament or child sex.

Moderation by Child Temperament and Child Sex

Role confusion may not affect children equally. Known moderators include whether role 
confusion is appropriate culturally (Mayseless, Bartholomew, Henderson, & Trinke, 2004), 
developmentally (Stein, Rotheram-Borus, & Lester, 2007; Tompkins, 2007), or in terms of 
perceived fairness regarding familial obligations (Fuligni et al., 2009; Kuperminc, Jurkovic, 
& Casey, 2009; Telzer & Fuligni, 2009). In addition to these potential moderators, it is 
possible that the associations between role confusion and child outcomes are influenced by 
child temperament and child sex (for a review see Macfie et al., 2015).

To our knowledge, there is no empirical examination of child temperament as a moderator of 
role confusion and child outcomes, but temperament repeatedly has been evidenced to 
moderate other aspects of parenting on child outcomes (e.g., Bradley & Corwyn, 2008; 
Kochanska & Kim, 2013). Thomas & Chess (1977) first characterized temperament as 
“difficult or easy” with dimensions associated with a difficult temperament (e.g., fearfulness, 
negative emotionality) predicting both internalizing and externalizing problems (Eisenberg, 
et al., 2001) and dimensions associated with easy temperament (e.g., positive emotionality) 
buffering children from the risk from unresponsive parenting (Kochanska & Kim, 2013). A 
bioecological model underlies several theories of how children’s temperamental 
characteristics lead to variation in rearing behaviors. For example, a diathesis-stress model 
posits that an environmental stressor is more likely to negatively affect vulnerable 
individuals (e.g., those with difficult temperaments) (Monroe & Simons, 1991; Ingram & 
Luxton, 2005). Although there have been no studies on the effect of temperament on role 
confusion (Macfie et al., 2015), we predicted that child temperament would moderate the 
effect of role confusion such that children with a difficult temperament would have more 
internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and peer problems when exposed to role 
confusion than would children with easy temperaments.

Second, we examined child sex as a potential moderator because previous studies have been 
inconclusive regarding the associations between child sex and experiences of role confusion. 
Although fathers have increased their involvement with children as of the turn of the 21st 
century, mothers were still more likely than were fathers to be primary caregivers (Cabrera, 
Tamis-LeMonda, Bradley, Hofferth, & Lamb, 2000). Girls may learn to be caregivers, too, 
and stay close to their mothers, whereas boys may be encouraged to be more independent

(Chodorow, 1978). Indeed, being a girl was associated with caring for mother, and being a 
boy was associated with doing chores in an urban poverty sample in middle childhood and 
adolescence (McMahon & Luthar, 2007). Furthermore, girls may feel more responsible for 
their mothers’ emotional needs and experience increased empathy and guilt (Zahn-Waxler & 
Robinson, 1995), which may engender internalizing symptoms. Girls experiencing role 
confusion at 24 months with both parents were more likely to become depressed, whereas 
boys were more likely to develop attention deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors by age 7 
(Jacobvitz et al., 2004). Moreover, by staying close to mothers, girls may have less 
opportunity to engage in appropriate peer relationships as evidenced by Macfie and 
colleagues (2005) who reported mothers’ role confusion with girls, but not boys, in the 
toddler period predicted later peer problems. Guided by these few studies, we predicted that 
role confusion would be positively associated with internalizing symptoms and peer 
problems for girls and positively associated with externalizing symptoms for boys.

Finally, we examined the interactions between child temperament, sex, role confusion and 
child problems. Although some studies have examined the relations between child 
temperament, sex, and parenting with respect to child outcomes, these studies yielded mixed 
results, and none focused on parental role confusion. Miner and Clarke-Stewart (2008) did 
not find support for their hypothesis that child temperament, sex, and less sensitive parenting 
would relate to behavior problems for boys and girls. In contrast, Leve and colleagues 
(2005) found that harsh discipline at age 5 years predicted greater externalizing scores for 
girls with difficult temperaments, but not for boys. Furthermore, Pitzer, Jenned-Steinmetz, 
Esser, Schmidt, and Laucht (2011) reported that fearful-inhibited boys were positively 
affected by sensitive parenting, whereas girls who were low in self-control and/or fearful, 
developed fewer problems with controlling parenting behavior. Given these findings, we 
predicted that role confusion would have a stronger effect for internalizing symptoms and 
peer problems among girls with difficult temperaments compared to girls with easy 
temperaments and there would be no associations for boys. In contrast, role confusion was 
predicted to have a stronger effect for externalizing among boys with difficult temperaments 
compared to boys with easy temperaments and no associations for girls.

The Current Study

First, we identified the need to isolate role confusion from two well-researched parenting 
dimensions: sensitivity and harsh intrusiveness. This is missing from prior studies of role 
confusion, leaving the unique effect of role confusion on child development unclear. When 
parenting is sensitive, the parent supports the child’s developing emotion regulation (Morris, 
Silk, Steinberg, Myers, & Robinson, 2007). Low levels of parental sensitivity were 
associated with greater levels of internalizing symptoms (Kok, et al., 2013; van der Sluis, 
van Steensel, & Bögels, 2015), externalizing symptoms (Denham et al., 2000; Wang, Christ, 
Mills-Koonce, Garrett-Peters, & Cox, 2013), and lower quality peer relationships (Mize, 
Pettit, & Meece, 2000). Similarly, parenting behavior that is harsh or intrusive is associated 
with internalizing symptoms (Granic & Patterson, 2006; Creswell, Murray, Stacey, & 
Cooper, 2011), externalizing symptoms (Rubin, Burgess, Dwyer, & Hastings, 2003), and 
problematic peer relationships (Soenens, Vansteenkiste, Smits, Lowet, & Goossens, 2007). 
Second, in addition to controlling for parental sensitivity and harsh intrusiveness, we also

controlled for demographic factors of poverty, maternal education, and minority status, 
which are missing as control variables in prior studies.Next, using a large sample from a 
longitudinal developmental study, we tested the main effects of observed role confusion at 5 
years of child age on teacher-reports of internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, 
and peer problems in 1st grade. We next examined the moderating effects of child sex, child 
temperament, and child sex by temperament on these associations.

Method

Participants

Data was collected by the Family Life Project (FLP), a longitudinal, multi-method, multi- 
respondent study of rural poverty that explores the ways in which child, family, and 
contextual factors shape child development. The FLP enrolled 1,292 families when the 
family’s infant was two months old. The subsample of families included in the current study 
(N = 557) consists of those who completed the 60-month home assessment and first grade 
school assessment, which involved the child’s teachers completing questionnaires about the 
child’s behaviors via a secure online survey site. Among the subsample of families (N = 
557), we had full data on all the predictor variables and covariates; therefore, no missing 
data procedures were required. Independent sample t-tests revealed no significant 
differences between the subsample used in the current analysis and the remaining members 
of the FLP sample from which the subsample was drawn with regard to any of the 
demographic or predictor variables.

The subsample was balanced with respect to child sex (49.6% female children), and race 
(40.5% African American) and was similar to the larger FLP sample from which it was 
derived (47.7% female children and 40.8% African American). At the 60-month visit, mean 
age for mothers was 25.6 (6.1) and 7.7 (1.5) for children, 49.7% of the mothers reported 
being married, and mean income-to-needs was 1.9 (1.7). For the current study, we used data 
from child age 6 months through the first-grade visit. Specifically, the three outcome 
variables (internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and peer relations) were from the grade 
1 assessment, the three parenting variables were from the 5-year home visit, and the 
covariates were from the 6-, 15-, and 36- month and age 5 data collection time points. 
Families received gift cards to local businesses as compensation for their time. Given that 
speaking English as their primary language was an inclusion factor for study recruitment 
(due to the prohibitively high financial cost of training interviewers and preparing and 
coding all measures in other languages), there were only 15 Latin/Hispanic families in the 
larger FLP sample. These 15 families are included and represent .027% of the current 
subsample. All data used in this study were stripped of any identifying information prior to 
analyses and deemed exempt from approval by the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill (UNC-CH) Institutional Review Board because the research involved the study of 
existing deidentified data.

Procedures

Two trained research assistants collected data during home visits. We obtained primary 
caregiver literacy through administration of the Kaufman Functional Academic Skills Test

Measures

(K-FAST, Kaufman, 1994) at the 2-month visit. All caregivers reading at the 8th grade level 
or above independently completed the questionnaires, while those reading below had the 
questionnaires read to them. Caregivers completed questionnaires regarding demographic 
variables. At the 60-month visit, in addition to questionnaires, mother and child were 
digitally recorded in a dyadic play activity and later coded for parenting behaviors and role 
confusion. This activity included (1) mother and child together building towers using 
wooden blocks to match a model provided, and, (2) a card game called Slapjack. For the 
tower building task, an examiner told mothers that this was a task for the child to complete, 
but that they could provide any assistance deemed necessary. For the card task, an examiner 
instructed mothers that when the card turned up was a Jack, both the mother and child were 
to slap the pile; the first one to slap the pile won those cards. The mother then taught the 
game to her child and the mother and child played the game. The two digitally recorded 
episodes lasted approximately 15 minutes in total. Teacher report of child behaviors in 
preschool and in 1st grade were collected via web-based questionnaires.

Maternal parenting behaviors.—Video recordings of the parent-child interaction at 60 
months of age were used for assessing maternal parenting behaviors. Using six global rating 
scales (supportive presence, positive regard, detachment/disengagement, intrusiveness, 
stimulation of cognitive development, and negative regard) adapted from those used by the 
NICHD Study of Early Child Care (Cox & Crnic, 2002; NICHD ECCRN, 1999), coders 
rated parenting behaviors on a 7-point scale (where 1 = not at all characteristic and 7 = very 
characteristic) across all 15 minutes. For all scales, coders underwent training until 
acceptable reliability (ri > .80) was achieved and maintained on every scale. Once acceptable 
reliability was established, coders began coding while continuing to code at least 20% of 
their weekly cases with a criterion coder. We assessed reliability on the independent scores 
of two coders. Each coding pair met biweekly to reconcile scoring discrepancies; we utilized 
the final consensus scores in all analyses. All coders were blind to other information about 
the families. The average inter-rater reliability across pairs of coders was ri > .80 for all 
scales. Informed by an exploratory factor analysis with an oblique rotation (i.e., Promax), 
the individual subscales were composited in order to obtain overall sensitive parenting (the 
mean of supportive presence, stimulation for cognitive development, positive regard, and 
reverse scored detachment) and harsh-intrusive parenting scores (the mean of intrusiveness 
and negative regard). The factor loadings (with second factor in parentheses to show 
differentiation) for the sensitive parenting composite in this sample were .93 (−.05), .88 (.
41), .82 (11), and .73 (.23) for supportive presence, stimulation for cognitive development, 
positive regard, and reversed detachment, respectively, and .89 (−.10) and .81(−.25) for 
intrusiveness and negative regard, respectively.

Role confusion.—In the same observations, we assessed role confusion using a dyadic 
scale that captures the extent to which the caregiver solicits inappropriate attention, 
affection, intimacy, or support from the child (rather than following the child’s activities and 
cues); and/or the extent to which the child seeks to maintain a relationship with the parent by 
initiating controlling behaviors towards the parent (Sroufe et al.,1985; Cox, 1997). The child 
may, in part, take the role of parent, peer, or spouse, towards his or her parent. For example,

the child may behave in a controlling parental manner toward the parent either in a 
caregiving (e.g., trying to cheer the parent up) or in a punitive (e.g., by harshly commanding 
the parent) manner. The parent may accept this reversal in roles, e.g., by meekly deferring to 
the child and letting him or her boss the parent around. The parent may behave as if he or 
she was the child’s peer, e.g., by squabbling with the child and abdicating from setting 
necessary limits. Or, the parent may treat the child like a spouse, e.g., by speaking in hushed, 
intimate tones, engaging in provocative teasing, or being physically seductive (“Don’t you 
want to give Mommy a kiss?”). Whereas a sensitive caregiver allows the child to take the 
lead during the interaction to acknowledge the child’s ability, role confusion is an abdication 
of the provision of emotional support to the child. The parent instead seeks to meet his or 
her own emotional needs at the expense of child’s need to complete the task.

The scores for role confusion were derived from a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 
to 7 (on which 1 = not at all characteristic and 7 = very characteristic) with a single score 
across all 15 minutes. Higher scores on the role confusion scale reflect a parent failing to 
maintain the parental role, with the child acting as parent, intimate partner, or playmate. A 
‘1’ is scored when it is always clear who is the parent and who is the child. The parent is 
clearly comfortable in his or her role, remains in charge of the situation, provides directives, 
sets limits if necessary, and communicates expectations to the child. Any physical contact is 
completely responsive to the child’s needs and is proportionate (not overbearing) to the 
nature of the current interaction. A ‘4’ is scored when the roles of parent and child begin to 
dissolve. There is some ambiguity about who is the parent and who is the child sporadically 
throughout the session. There may be general hesitancy on the part of the parent, who may 
sometimes defer to the child instead of exerting control when needed. The parent may at 
times encourage a playmate or partner relationship; or, parent and child may be engaged in a 
power struggle, bickering somewhat like peers (e.g., ‘You do it;’ ‘No, you do it;’ ‘No, 
you…’). More rarely, role confusion at this level may also be characterized by one high level 
but isolated instance of physical intimacy not responsive to the child’s needs (e.g., child is 
picking up toys; parent grabs him/her towards her for a kiss). A ‘7’ is scored when it is 
unclear who is the parent and who is the child throughout the session. The parent fails to 
take charge and set limits, a playmate relationship may predominate, or the child may take 
on the role of parent controlling the situation, with the parent meekly deferring to and 
obeying the child. There may be a high amount of seductive behavior present with the 
parent’s needs always taking precedence over the child’s. Intermediary scores reflect 
qualitatively distinct, ordinal differences between the middle and extreme ratings.

Interrater reliability across pairs of coders was ri > .80. There is support for construct 
validity for the role confusion scale using a normative sample. Mothers role confusion with 
their own mothers (Macfie, McElwain et al 2005), disorganized attachment in infancy 
(Macfie, Fitzpatrick et al., 2008), and marital conflict (Macfie, Houts, Pressel, & Cox, 2008) 
predicted role confusion in the toddler period, which in turn predicted externalizing, 
internalizing, and peer problems in kindergarten (Macfie, Houts et al., 2005). The role 
confusion coding from the FLP has also been used in a study of mothers with histories of 
childhood sexual trauma (Zvara, Mills-Koonce, Carmody, & Cox, 2015).

Child temperament.—Child temperament at age 15 months was assessed by the Infant 
Behavior Record (IBR; Bayley, 1969) as adapted by Stifter and Corey (2001) and completed 
independently by both home visitors. The IBR captures individual differences in behavior 
during the administration of the Bayley scales. The IBR was applied to behavior observed 
globally across the entire visit: social approach (3 items, e.g., responsiveness to persons, to 
examiner, to caregiver--higher scores indicate greater friendliness and approach-oriented 
behaviors); positive affect (2 items, fear reverse coded, happiness--higher scores indicate 
more happiness); attention (3 items, responsiveness to objects or toys, tendency to persist in 
attending, behavior constancy in response to demands of visit, toys--higher scores indicate 
more persistent attention); gross movement (1 item, amount of gross bodily movement--
higher scores indicate more movement), reactivity (1 item, ease with which child is 
stimulated to react, either positive or negative--higher scores indicate greater sensitivity or 
excitability); and irritability (1 item; irritability--reverse coded).

We created a composite measure of child temperament based on independent observations of 
multiple dimensions of child behavior by two trained data collectors who observed the child 
across the home visit. First, for each temperament dimension (social approach, positive 
affect, attention, gross movement, reactivity, and irritability), indicator items were averaged 
within coders and the averages were averaged across coders. We based this process on (1) 
high internal consistencies (within coder) for each temperament dimension (social approach 
α = .75, positive affect α = .76, attention α = .79, gross movement α = .79, reactivity α = .
75, and irritability α = .71), and (2) on high inter-rater reliabilities (across coders) for each 
dimension (social approach α = .78, positive affect α = .78, attention α = .88, gross 
movement α = .74, reactivity α = .73, and irritability α = .70). Next, based on significant 
correlations between these temperament dimensions (ranging from .70–88, with irritability 
reverse coded), we created an overall composite temperament score by averaging these 
dimensions (with irritability reverse coded) and report a high internal consistency for this 
measure (α = .79). This overall composite score was used in the analysis and this approach 
is consistent with other publications utilizing this measure (e.g., Blair, Raver, Granger, 
Mills- Koonce, & Hibel, 2011). Low values represent a more difficult temperament.

Child symptoms.—We assessed children’s internalizing symptoms, externalizing 
symptoms, and peer problems at grade 1 using the teacher version of the Strengths and 
Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997). The SDQ is a 25-item report of child 
behaviors rated on a 3-point Likert scale: 0 = not true, 1 = somewhat true, 2 = certainly true. 
For the internalizing symptoms subscale, teachers reported on children’s behavior with items 
including, “often unhappy, depressed, or tearful,” “nervous or clingy in new situations, 
easily loses confidence”. Children’s externalizing symptoms were assessed by taking the 
mean of the sum of conduct problems and hyperactivity subscales, consistent with the Child 
Behavior Checklist externalizing composite (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1978). Example 
items for externalizing symptoms were, “often loses temper” and “restless, overactive, 
cannot stay still for long”. We utilized the 5-item subscale for peer problems and the 5-item 
subscale for internalizing symptoms in current analyses. For the peer problems subscale, 
teachers reported on children’s behavior with such items as, “rather solitary, prefers to play 
alone”, and “generally liked by other children.” Cronbach’s alphas for internalizing

symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and peer problems at the grade 1 visit were α = .80, α 
= .84, and α = .73, respectively.

Covariates.—Poverty status, maternal education, and ethnic minority status are important 
correlates of parenting (see Conger, Conger, & Martin, 2010, for a review) and thus the 
family’s income-to-needs ratio, maternal education, and race were included as covariates. 
We controlled for prior behavior (internalizing and externalizing symptoms, peer problems) 
using preschool teacher report of the SDQ at age 36 months. The same items are included in 
the SDQ for the preschool and grade 1 visit. Cronbach’s alphas for internalizing symptoms, 
externalizing symptoms, and peer problems at the preschool visit were α = .73, α = .68, and 
α = .61, respectively. Income-to-needs ratios were calculated by dividing the total household 
income from all possible sources by the federally determined poverty threshold for the 
number of people living in the household for that year. Income-to-needs ratios above 1.0 
indicate that a family is able to provide for basic needs, whereas values below 1.0 indicate 
that they are not. Because income-to-needs ratios showed stability over time (r = .68, p < .
01), we averaged the family’s income-to-needs ratios from the 6 months to 60 months 
measurements and used the resulting variable as a covariate. Given that the overwhelming 
majority of African American families resided in one study site, study location was also 
included as a covariate to address a potential confound between site and ethnicity.

Results

Overview of Analyses

We conducted all analyses using SAS version 9.4. Predicator variables were centered before 
commencing analyses. Means, standard deviations, and correlations among study variables 
are presented in Table 1. Child sex is coded 1 for males and 0 for females, child race was 
coded 1 for black and 0 for white, and maternal education was coded 1 for having earned a 
high school diploma or equivalent and 0 for no diploma. We computed sequential regression 
models to examine the unique associations of role confusion, child temperament, and sex to 
internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and peer problems, above and beyond the 
effects of other domains of parenting (sensitivity and harsh intrusiveness), and covariates 
including household income-to-needs, race, maternal education, and study site. We 
examined separate models for internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and peer 
problems. In each model, we entered control variables on the first step. On the second step, 
we examined whether child temperament and sex were significant predictors of child 
internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and peer problems. On the third step, we 
entered observations of three parenting variables (sensitive, harsh intrusiveness, and role 
confusion) to examine whether role confusion would predict child socioemotional 
adjustment beyond other domains of parenting, temperament, and covariates (Hypothesis 1). 
On the fourth step, we entered interaction terms for role confusion X temperament and role 
confusion X sex (hypotheses 2a and 2b). In the fifth and final step, we examined the 
moderating role of child sex by testing the three-way interactions, i.e., temperament X sex X 
role confusion (Hypothesis 3).

Although we proposed a diathesis stress framework, we approached the evaluation of the 
three-way interaction through an exploratory lens proposed by Roisman et al. (2012), rather 
than presuming that the data necessarily reflected a diathesis stress and not a differential 
susceptibility model should evidence appear consistent with that theoretical framework. 
Specifically, Roisman and colleagues (2012) proposed guidelines to better differentiate 
diathesis-stress from differential susceptibility by testing for non-linearity, as differential 
susceptibility effects can be an artifact of imposing a linear predictor model on a nonlinear 
diathesis-stress phenomenon (Roisman et al., 2012, p. 308). We, therefore, estimated an 
additional model to test for nonsignificant linear effects as would be expected from a 
diathesis stress model as compared to a differential susceptibility framework (Roisman et al., 
2012).

Examining the intercorrelations among key variables revealed that role confusion at age 5 
was positively related to internalizing (r = .09, p < .05) symptoms at grade 1, and harsh 
intrusive parenting (r = .10, p < .05) at age 5. Sensitive parenting at age 5 was inversely 
related to externalizing symptoms (r = −.20, p < .01), and peer problems (r = −.14, p < .01) 
at grade 1. Similarly, harsh intrusive parenting at age 5 was related to externalizing 
symptoms (r = .24, p < .01), and peer problems (r = .15, p < .01) at grade 1. Although child 
sex was related to peer problems (r = .13, p < .01) and externalizing symptoms (r = .26, p < .
01), it was not related to any of the parenting variables. Similarly, child temperament was 
related to peer problems (r = −.13, p < .01), but not to any of the parenting variables.

Testing of Hypotheses

Main effects and the moderating effect of child temperament and sex.—We first 
tested Hypothesis (1) that role confusion at age 5 would predict internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms and peer problems at grade 1, and that child temperament 
(Hypothesis 2a) and child sex (Hypothesis 2b) would moderate these relationships. In the 
next step, we tested Hypothesis (3) with a three-way interaction (role confusion X 
temperament X sex) to determine if the interaction between role confusion and child 
temperament differentially affected boys and girls.

Internalizing symptoms.—On initial examination, we found a significant main effect of 
preschool behavior problems (β = .15, p < .01), maternal education (β = .13, p < .05), and 
intrusive parenting (β = −.06, p < .01), on grade 1 internalizing symptoms. Findings further 
revealed that role confusion at age 5 predicted internalizing symptoms at grade 1, as 
hypothesized, above and beyond the effects of numerous covariates (listed above), other 
domains of parenting (sensitivity, harsh intrusiveness), and prior levels of behavior 
problems, (β = .04, p < .05). However, we did not find significant results for either the role 
confusion X temperament or role confusion X sex interactions. The three-way interaction 
(i.e., role confusion X temperament X sex), was significant, (β = −.12, p < .001). As 
recommended by Roisman et al. (2012), to test for nonlinear effects, we next examined the 
quadratic interactions (role confusion X role confusion) and (role confusion X role 
confusion X temperament), and found that they were not significant, β = −.01, p = .67 and β 
= −.03, p = .08, respectively. Therefore, the model without nonlinear effects represented the 
final model (see Table 2).

We next probed the significant interaction and found that for girls with difficult 
temperament, role confusion was positively associated with internalizing symptoms. The 
strength of this association (i.e., the slope) decreased with easier temperaments and became 
a negative association (internalizing symptoms decreases as role confusion increases) for 
those girls with the easiest temperamental characteristics (Figure 1a). Furthermore, at the 
mean level of role confusion, internalizing symptoms did not vary as a function of 
temperament. However, at just 1 SD above or below the mean level of role confusion, there 
were significant differences in internalizing symptoms by temperament (p = .02 for −1 SD; p 
< .001 for +1 SD). These findings suggest that, for girls experiencing role confusion, 
internalizing symptoms are very much dependent on temperament. Conversely, for boys, 
there was a positive association between role confusion and internalizing symptoms for 
easier temperaments, easing into a null association for more difficult temperaments similarly 
across levels of child temperament (Figure 1b). At the mean level of role confusion as well 
as 1 SD above, internalizing symptoms were not differential between temperaments. For 
boys at 1 SD below or 2 SDs above the mean level of role confusion, there were significant 
differences in internalizing symptoms by temperament (p = .01 for −1 SD; p = .01 for +2 
SDs).

Peer problems.—We found a significant main effect of preschool peer problems (β = .15, 
p < .001), child sex (β = −.07, p < .05), and difficult temperament (β = - .04, p < .01) on 
grade 1 peer problems. As hypothesized, findings revealed that role confusion at age 5 
predicted peer problems at grade 1, above and beyond the effects of numerous covariates 
(listed above) and other domains of parenting (sensitivity, harsh intrusiveness), β = .02, p < .
05(see Table 3). However, contrary to our hypotheses, we failed to find evidence of 
moderation by child temperament and child sex.

Externalizing symptoms.—Preschool externalizing behavior (β = .41, p < .001), and 
child sex (β = −.15, p < .001) had significant main effects on grade 1 externalizing 
symptoms. Contrary to our hypotheses, we failed to find an association between role 
confusion and child externalizing behavior above and beyond other domains of parenting, 
nor did we find evidence of any moderating effects of child temperament or child sex (see 
Table 4).

Post hoc analyses.—Given the unique associations of role confusion on child behavior 
above and beyond the effects of other domains of parenting, we ran additional exploratory 
analyses to determine how much variance role confusion alone accounted for in the 
outcomes of interest without the inclusion of sensitive and harsh intrusive parenting in the 
models. After adjusting for covariates, there was no significant main effect of role confusion 
on internalizing or externalizing symptoms or peer problems at grade 1 (β = 03, p = .06, β 
= .01, p = .59, and, β = 02, p = .10, respectively); however, there was a trend towards 
significance for internalizing symptoms. We further tested the interactions between role 
confusion, temperament, and sex for all three outcomes of interest and found a significant 
three-way interaction between role confusion X temperament X sex, for internalizing 
symptoms, (β = −.126, p < .001). When we probed this interaction, we found the same 
pattern of associations reported above for internalizing symptoms for boys and girls.

Consistent with our prior analyses, no significant interactions emerged for role confusion 
and temperament or sex with regards to externalizing symptoms or peer problems.

Discussion

The current study increases our understanding of the associations between parent-child role 
confusion and children’s internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and peer 
problems at school age above and beyond the effects of other domains of parenting, 
numerous demographic covariates, and prior levels of behavior problems. Perhaps most 
importantly, it suggests that these associations are outcome specific and are moderated by 
child factors such as sex and temperament suggesting an array of unique developmental 
processes associated with this relational experience for young children. Although the study 
benefits from a large sample and longitudinal study design, as well as observational 
methodologies and multiple reporters of child behaviors, it is one of the first of its kind and 
requires extension and replication. However, the notable findings, as discussed below, 
highlight the clinical and developmental significance of parent-child role confusion 
dynamics in the adjustment of children during the transition to middle childhood.

As predicted (Hypothesis 1), role confusion at age 5 years was associated with internalizing 
symptoms and peer problems at grade 1; however, contrary to hypothesis, role confusion 
was not associated with externalizing symptoms. Although the effect sizes of role confusion 
on internalizing symptoms and peer problems were small, this is not necessarily unexpected 
given the atypicality of the phenomenon and the extensive use of controls in analyses. 
However, replication of these findings is necessary. These findings confirm and extend 
previous reports linking role confusion to internalizing symptoms (Jacobvitz et al., 2004; 
Johnston et al., 1987) and peer problems (Sroufe et al., 1993) by suggesting that role 
confusion may have an independent effect on child development above and beyond other 
domains of parenting. As noted by previous findings, young children evidenced extreme 
anxiety when the mother emphasized her own needs in interaction with the child due to her 
depression, and the children evidenced inhibition of assertiveness towards peers (Rubin, 
Both, Zahn-Waxler, Cummings, & Wilkinson, 1991).

We further found a significant three-way interaction between role confusion, child 
temperament, and sex in their association with internalizing symptoms at grade 1. Findings 
generally adhered to a diathesis-stress model, in which a non-optimal environment (i.e., role 
confusion) was more likely to impact children adversely who had temperamental 
vulnerabilities. However, these patterns of association also varied as a function of child sex, 
suggesting that a difficult versus an easy temperament serves as a protective or risk factor 
depending on whether the child is male or female. We found that, in the context of role 
confusion, difficult temperament was related to internalizing symptoms for girls, but not for 
boys. In contrast, boys with easy temperaments (less fearfulness, more positive affect, and 
more approach-oriented behaviors) were more vulnerable to the effects of role confusion.

With regard to girls, our findings not only suggest that a difficult temperament may be 
related to higher ratings for internalizing symptoms in the context of role confusion, but also 
that an easy temperament (less fearfulness, positive affect) may be a protective factor. One

possible explanation may be that, compared to boys, girls who require more external support 
for emotional regulation are more likely to please the parent rather than to be disruptive 
(Koslowska, 2001). In so doing, girls may sacrifice their own needs for attention, comfort, 
and guidance in order to accommodate the emotional needs of the parent. Moreover, girls 
experiencing role confusion who have an easy temperament may feel self-esteem related to 
performing a caregiving role for the parent, which may be internalized as a positive 
experience and improve their sense of efficacy and control. As our findings suggest, 
however, although compliance and attempts to please the mother may be the only way to 
maintain a close relationship with her, such behaviors may precede the onset of internalizing 
problems in girls. In contrast to other studies that have reported that an easy temperament 
did not bestow a protective factor from developmental outcomes (Kochanska & Kim, 2013), 
our findings suggest that, for girls who are more temperamentally easy (i.e., low fear, high 
positive affect), role confusion, even at higher levels, is not related to internalizing 
symptoms. However, replication of this three-way interaction is needed to improve 
confidence in the finding.

For boys, however, the findings suggest a different story. At 1 SD above the mean for role 
confusion, we found a significant association between role confusion and internalizing 
symptoms for boys across all levels of temperament. However, at higher levels of role 
confusion (2 SDs above the mean), we found that boys with easy temperaments were more 
vulnerable. Whereas an easy temperament may have bestowed a protective factor for girls, it 
had the opposite association for boys. Given the nature of role confusion whereby mothers 
look to children for emotional support, it is likely that boys who are less fearful, more 
engaging (easy temperament) may be more susceptible to the effects of role confusion as 
mothers may find them more malleable to their demands for care. In contrast, boys who are 
more temperamentally difficult may, over time, be less of a target for role confused 
parenting behaviors if they are temperamentally less able to serve in that patient and 
supportive role for the parent.

Contrary to expectation, we did not find (Hypothesis 2a) a significant interaction between 
role confusion and child temperament in the prediction of internalizing and externalizing 
symptoms and peer problems. Children with difficult temperaments were not more 
susceptible to the effects of role confusion than were children with an easy temperament. 
Nor did we find (Hypothesis 2b) a significant interaction between role confusion and child 
sex in the prediction of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, or peer problems. 
Although we found the main effect of temperament and role confusion on peer problems, 
and the main effect of child sex on externalizing behavior, the interactions were not 
significant. Children’s temperamental predisposition and sex have been shown to potentiate 
associations between family risk factors (e.g., parenting) and child psychopathology 
(Bradley & Corwyn, 2008; Leve et al., 2005). However, the complex nature of role 
confusion may require more nuanced approaches to understanding the associations between 
mothers and children in this relationship pattern.

In considering directions for future research, we note that there is little research on role 
confusion in middle childhood. Difficulty regulating emotions in social contexts and 
forming peer relationships at grade 1 may become crystallized patterns of problematic

behavior by late childhood and early adolescence (Eron, 1990). Furthermore, in future 
studies of sex differences in role confusion, more complex processes may become apparent. 
In the current study, the interaction of sex with temperament is an example of our growing 
understanding of conceptual complexity. Our post hoc analyses provide additional support 
for the unique relations of role confusion to child internalizing symptoms. Although the 
main effect model was not significant (p = .06), the significant three-way interaction 
between role confusion, child sex, and temperament provides evidence for a significant 
association.

In findings unrelated to our hypotheses, there was no significant correlation between 
maternal sensitivity and maternal role confusion, either positive or negative, which suggests 
that there may be several profiles of mother-child relationships. In some, role confusion may 
be positively associated with maternal sensitivity, and in others, negatively associated. In 
parallel with role confusion in children being characterized as either controlling caregiving 
or controlling punitive (Main et al., 1985), mothers seeking to get their needs met by their 
children may be either caregiving (sensitive), or punitive (insensitive). Exploratory post hoc 
analyses revealed no significant interaction between role confusion and sensitive parenting 
for any of the three outcomes tested. Future research should further examine whether the 
association between role confusion and sensitive parenting is related to additional 
characteristics of the mother and/or the child than those examined in the current study. 
However, we did find a small positive association between role confusion and harsh intrusive 
parenting. This is consistent with early work by Sroufe and Ward (1980), which found that 
mothers who exhibited role confusion were more likely to use physical punishment or 
threats to achieve compliance. Furthermore, our findings suggest that sensitive and harsh 
intrusive parenting are strongly associated with parental education, income and race, while 
role confusion is less likely to be associated with these factors, further highlighting the 
unique nature of role confusion. It is possible that, in contrast to sensitive and harsh intrusive 
parenting, role confusion represents a parent’s unmet emotional needs, in part stemming 
from childhood, which may cut across demographic factors.

Consistent with previous reports, we found a significant association between all three child 
behavior problems tested and family income-to-needs (See Conger et al., 2010 for a review). 
We further noted a significant correlation between maternal education, child race and 
externalizing symptoms, and peer problems. Taken together, these results suggest that 
demographic factors such as low levels of household income and maternal education may 
serve as unique risk factors for children’s behavior problems. Furthermore, finding a 
significant correlation between temperament and peer problems indicates that children with 
difficult temperament may be at higher risk for experiencing rejection from peers as their 
regulatory difficulties may have an influence on peers’ attitudes and behaviors toward them. 
This finding adds to the growing body of research linking negative emotionality to peer 
rejection (Hasenfratz, Benish-Weisman, Steinberg, & Knafo-Noam, 2015).

There were many strengths of this study, including the use of data from a large sample of 
families living in rural communities (with an oversampling of low-income families), a 
longitudinal design, and the use of independent observations of child-parent interactions 
rather than parent report measures. However, there are limitations that merit consideration.

First, despite the relatively diverse nature of our sample, the findings only generalize to 
families in rural communities living in poverty, excluding Hispanic families who only speak 
Spanish, and, as such, warrants additional research and replication in socio-economically 
and ethnically more diverse samples. Moreover, although our measure of temperament has 
the benefit of being an observational measure independent of the mother’s perspective, we 
assessed it at 15 months and only in terms of easy versus difficult. It would have been better 
to utilize a more concurrent and nuanced measure of temperament observed independently.

Another limitation concerns the fact that we observed role confusion at only one point in 
time. Given evidence suggesting that other domains of parenting such as parental sensitivity 
change over time (Hirsh-Pasek & Burchinal, 2006), future work should examine continuity 
and change in role confusion across childhood and adolescence. Along these same lines, 
future research needs to consider factors, such as serious health conditions, that may require 
children to take on responsibilities typically undertaken by adults. Furthermore, a more 
nuanced approach to studying role confusion would allow for a greater understanding on this 
maladaptive form of parenting, but also its relations to child adjustment. Identifying the 
differential effects of child as parent (parentification), child as spouse (spousification), and 
parent as peer would inform efforts to bring child development back onto an adaptive 
pathway.

Additionally, because role confusion affects not only the mother-child dyad, but also the 
family system, assessment of fathers, when possible, would be informative. Importantly, our 
role confusion assessment captured the extent to which the mother solicited inappropriate 
attention, affection, intimacy, or comfort from the child, rather than providing needed 
structure and support. It is likely that mothers who turn to their children to meet their 
emotional needs may not be aware that their child is seeking to receive care, not provide it. 
Consequently, these mothers may believe that their children are well adjusted. Furthermore, 
although in the current study teachers reported on child behavior, future research should 
explore maternal ratings of child behavior in addition to provide a richness of perspectives.

Findings from this study provide evidence that role confusion may specifically place an 
undue burden on young children in terms of internalizing symptoms and peer problems. 
Moreover, girls may be more at risk of internalizing symptoms in the context of role 
confusion when they have a difficult temperament, and boys may be more at risk of 
internalizing symptoms when they have an easy temperament. Findings highlight the 
importance of designing early interventions to help parents meet their own needs for care, 
intimacy, and peer-like play with one another or with other adults so they can provide 
adequate care for their children, allowing them to grow and develop with their needs for 
nurturance and support fully met.
