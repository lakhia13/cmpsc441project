Background:  Parents’  knowledge  and  misconception  about  attention-deficit  hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) influences their children’s access to care, its management and outcome. The 
study aimed to investigate parents’ knowledge and perceptions of ADHD.

Methods: The cross-sectional survey of 79 parents of children (aged 5–17 years) with ADHD at 
a  specialist  child  psychiatry  clinic  in  KwaZulu-Natal  Province,  South Africa,  consisted  of  a 
socio-demographic  and  clinical  questionnaire,  and  the  Knowledge  of  Attention  Disorders 
Scale questionnaire, was carried out.

Results:  Twenty-six  (32.9%)  parents  consulted  a  traditional  healer,  of  whom  84.6%  did  so 
before consulting a medical doctor, with 61.5% reporting that the healer suggested psychiatric 
referral. Most parents had some knowledge of their child’s ADHD diagnosis but held various 
misconceptions about its treatment and associated factors: 92.4% believed that reducing sugar 
or  food  additives  were  effective  to  reduce  symptoms;  78.5%  that  treatments  focussing  on 
punishment reduced the symptoms; 67.1% that prolonged use of stimulant medications leads 
to increased addiction (i.e. drug, alcohol) in adulthood.

Conclusion:  Many  parents  had  misconceptions  about  ADHD’s  causes  and  treatment,  some 
having  consulted  traditional  healers,  indicating  the  need  to  increase  awareness  among 
health  practitioners  to  ensure  timeous  treatment  access. A  parent  focussed  psycho-education 
programme  is  required  that  provides  information  about  causes,  symptoms,  treatment 
and prognosis.

Introduction
Parental knowledge, attitude or perception about psychiatric conditions is essential for young 
children,  as  these  are  the  people  who  rely  to  access  care,  ensure  treatment  adherence  and 
provide support to improve the outcomes.1 According to the Health Belief Model,2 knowledge 
of  mental  conditions  and  their  management  determines  treatment-seeking  behaviour,  this 
being  key  to  improving  the  outcomes  for  children.3 Attention-deficit  hyperactivity  disorder 
(ADHD)  is  one  of  the  most  common  childhood-onset  psychiatric  disorders  and  has  a  stable 
worldwide prevalence of 5% – 7%,4,5,6 including in Africa5 and South Africa.6

Attention-deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  accounts  for  a  significant  number  of  child  referrals  to 
psychiatric and paediatric mental health services. Although the incidence of ADHD is comparable 
in both white and African Americans in the United States (US), fewer children of the latter were 
diagnosed and treated, which may be because of the complex barriers extending from the home 
to the health care system.7 Factors such as education and awareness programmes, cultural and 
public perceptions, physician characteristics, parent knowledge and attitude or perception and 
various environmental exposures may influence access to and the quality of care that children 
with ADHD  receive.8  Poor  or  inadequate  commitment  by  parents  to ADHD  management  will 
result in inadequate treatment adherence to pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, 
or  even  its  discontinuation.9  Parental  commitment  to  treatment  may,  in  turn,  be  influenced  by 
several  factors,  including  knowledge  of  and  attitude  to  ADHD,  socio-economic  status,  stress, 
coping mechanisms and cultural factors.4,10

Although  it  has  been  scientifically  accepted  that ADHD  is  a  childhood-onset  neurobiological 
disorder11  and  that  medication  is  the  mainstay  of  treatment,12  public  controversy  about  it

remains prevalent, being fuelled by perceptions from society, 
including parents, teachers and even health professionals.13 
There  are  also  many  misconceptions  relating  to 
its 
causes,  symptoms,  treatment  and  course.10  Misconceptions 
commonly relate to the sources of information, for example, 
television and social media, parenting practices and the side 
effect profiles of psychotropic medications, particularly the 
stimulant  methylphenidate.  Based  on  these  perceptions, 
parents  tend  to  balance  the  advantages  and  disadvantages 
of  using  ADHD  medications,  with  some  opting  for  less 
evidence-based treatment.1,14,15

In  an  Australian  community  study  of  parents  and 
adolescents, while many participants were knowledgeable 
about ADHD, there were gaps in their knowledge about its 
genetic aetiology and course of illness, with many caregivers 
expressing concerns about over-medication.15 A community 
study  in  the  US  on  adolescents  at  high  risk  of  developing 
ADHD  because  of  family  history  reported  that,  although 
many of their parents, teachers and health care professionals 
were  familiar  with  the  diagnosis,  there  were  several 
misconceptions  relating  to  its  treatment  and  the  potential 
addictive  effect  of  medication.16  This  has  been  further 
supported by a review of the literature on surveys among 
parents, teachers and professional regarding ADHD.13

A  study  in  Iran  in  2007  of  parents  of  children  with ADHD 
found  that  their  knowledge  of  the  condition  was  relatively 
poor,  particularly  relating  to  its  biological  and  genetic 
causation  and  their  limited  awareness  led  to  delays  in 
accessing  care.17  Although  a  South  African  study  assessed 
primary  school  teachers’  knowledge  and  misperceptions  of 
ADHD in the Western Cape province,18 there appears to be 
very limited data from Africa on the subject.

Parental knowledge of ADHD may be influenced by multiple 
psycho-socio-cultural factors, including educational level, race, 
culture,  stigma,  access  to  the  Internet  and  mental  health 
services.19 Bussing et al. suggested that cultural variations may 
affect  ADHD  knowledge  in  the  US,1  although  this  was  not 
borne out in a later study.16 In a more recent (2017) study in Iran, 
parental knowledge in a clinical sample correlated significantly 
with  educational  level.10  In  addition,  parental  knowledge, 
attitudes  and  awareness  may  also  be  influenced  by  the 
information  sources,  with  patients  and  carers  traditionally 
relying on the physician for psycho-education, although there 
is an increasing reliance on the Internet and other media.13 In 
the more recent Iranian study by Dodangi and colleagues, 52% 
of parents of affected children reported that the television was 
the most common source of information.10

The  literature  therefore  notes  that  several  misconceptions 
about ADHD  persist,  specifically  related  to  diagnosis  and 
treatment, which may be influenced by various factors that, 
in  turn,  could  affect  adherence  and  outcome.  Against 
this  backdrop  of  ADHD  being  one  of  most  common 
neuro-developmental disorders in children, and because of 
the  reliance  on  parental  knowledge  and  attitudes  to  its 
treatment to ensure an optimal outcome, it is important to 

investigate  this  aspect  in  the  South African  setting,  where 
there are limited mental health resources.

This  study  therefore  aimed  to  describe  the  knowledge 
and  misconceptions  towards  ADHD  among  parents  of 
children  receiving  care  at  a  public  sector  outpatient 
psychiatric 
in  KwaZulu-Natal  province, 
South  Africa.  We  also  aimed  to  explore  any  associations 
characteristics 
between  parents’ 
and  the  Knowledge  of  Attention  Deficit  Disorder  Scale 
(KADDS) sub-scale scores or misconceptions.

Method
Participants
This 
a 
questionnaire interview with 79 adults (18 years and older) 
biological  parents  of  children  (aged  5–17  years)  with  an 
established clinical diagnosis of ADHD, as per the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual (DSM 5) criteria20 who were referred 
to study researcher. Inclusion criteria were English-speaking 
parents of children with ADHD at a specialist child psychiatry 
outpatient  service  and  had  been  under  treatment  for  a 
minimum of 6 months. The diagnosis of ADHD was based on 
the  clinical  assessment  by  using  DSM  5  criteria  by  senior 
psychiatry registrars under the supervision of or by a child 
psychiatrist. Carers who were not biological parents were not 
included in this study.

All  parents  were  invited  to  participate  in  the  study,  with 
survey  being  completed  on  their  clinical  visit.  All  surveys 
were  completed  by  the  principal  investigator  (N.R.)  after 
written  informed  consent  was  obtained,  with  data  being 
collected from May 2017 to March 2018.

Instruments
Two  instruments  were  used  to  obtain  data:  a  parent 
socio-demographic questionnaire and the KADDS.

Socio-demographic  and  clinical  questionnaire:  A  socio-
demographic and clinical questionnaire was used to obtain 
child and parent variables and consisted of three sections. 
Section 1 obtained the parent’s demographic details, such 
as  age,  gender,  occupation,  educational  level,  household 
income and the number of children. They were also asked 
if they had consulted a faith healer and whether they had 
suggested  psychiatric  treatment.  Section  2  obtained  the 
child’s socio-demographic (age, gender, educational level) 
and  clinical  characteristics  from  the  parents,  which  were 
confirmed by chart review for variables, such as diagnosis, 
duration  of  illness  and  treatment.  Section  3  explored  the 
sources  of  parents’  knowledge  and  misconceptions  about 
ADHD and was based on a review of the literature. Data on 
their experience of stigmatisation, support systems, ADHD 
causes, sources of information and perception of the health 
care received were collated. Stigma was defined for parents 
as a mark of shame, disgrace or disapproval that results in 
an  individual  being  rejected,  discriminated  against  and 
excluded from main society.

Knowledge  of  Attention  Deficit  Disorder  Scale:  The 
KADDS is a 36-item rating-scale questionnaire21 that uses a 
true, false or do not know format and enables a comparison 
between  the  parent’s  knowledge  and  their  attitudes 
(perceptions),  that  is,  their  misconceptions.  The  KADDS 
was developed to measure knowledge and misconceptions 
in  three  sub-scales:  symptom  or  diagnosis  (9  items), 
treatment  (12  items)  and  associated  features  (i.e.  general 
knowledge about the nature, causes and outcome) (15 items) 
among  parents,  teachers  and  mental  health  professionals, 
being  used  in  this  study  for  the  former  only.  Knowledge 
was  measured  by  correct  scores  and  misconceptions  by 
incorrect responses.

the  original  36 

The  questionnaire  does  not  make  provision  for  a  total 
score,  with  each  item  being  assessed  individually  and  the 
sub-scale scores being compared. The items in the KADDS 
scale  have  statistical  reliability  and  validity,  with  research 
having  been  conducted  on  the  internal  consistency  of  its 
total  score,  based  on 
items  scale 
(three  items  are  still  for  further  testing),  revealing  a  high 
internal  consistency,  ranging  from  0.81  to  0.86.18  Internal 
consistency  was  found  in  the  present  study,  with  the 
Cronbach’s  alpha  for  the  total  score  being  0.551,  possibly 
because  of  poorer  proficiency  in  English  as  English  may 
have a second language for some participants. The KADDS 
scale  was  used  previously  in  the  Western  Cape  Province, 
South  Africa,  in  a  study  that  assessed  primary  school 
teachers’  knowledge  and  misconceptions  of  ADHD.18  The 
tools were piloted on 10 parents prior to data collection to 
ensure that all questions were comprehensive. It provided 
insight on how best to phrase the survey questions and to 
ensure that they were all understood.

Statistical analysis

from 
The  quantitative  data 
questionnaire  were  entered  and  analysed  by  using  the 
Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 26 software by 
using descriptive statistics. The variables from the KADDS 
questionnaire were also descriptively analysed by using the 
number and per cent for the categorical variables, with their 
frequency distribution being examined, and the means with 
standard  deviation,  medians  and  inter-quartiles  ranges 
being  used,  as  appropriate.  The  three  sub-groups  of  the 
KADDS  (knowledge  and  misconceptions  about  diagnosis, 
treatment  and  associated  factors)  were  compared  by 
conducting chi-square tests on t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum 
test, with a p < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. 
The  data  are  presented  in  three  sections:  (1)  correct 
knowledge,  (2)  incorrect  knowledge  (misconceptions)  and 
(3)  associations  between  misconceptions  with  parent 
characteristics.

Ethical consideration 
The  study  was  approved  by  the  University  of  KwaZulu-

Ethics 

(Ref  BE036/17).  Permission  was  also  obtained  from  the 
Department  of  Health  and  written  informed  consent  from 
the parents.

Results
Of the 82 parents who were invited to participate, 79 agreed 
and  3  refused.  The  results  were:  (1)  the  parents’  socio-
demographic  and  health-seeking  behaviour,  (2)  children’s 
clinical  characteristics,  (3)  the  source  of  the  parents’ 
knowledge,  being  followed  by  (4)  the  KADDS  sub-scale 
scores 
(knowledge  and  misconceptions)  and  possible 
associations between the parent factors.

Parents’ socio-demographic characteristics and 
health-seeking behaviour

The majority of parents were 41–50 years old (49.4%), female 
(n  =  57,  72.2%),  married  (59.5%)  and  black  (49.4%);  did  not 
have a tertiary education (n = 66, 83.5%); and had two children 
(45.6%). Seven (8.9%) of the parents had two or more children 
with ADHD, whereas the majority (n = 71, 91.1%) had only one 
affected  child  (Table  1).  The  sociodemographic  data  of  the 
parents are presented in Table 1.

Consultation with a faith healer

Table  2  shows  the  summary  of  the  data  on  those  parents 
who  consulted  a  faith  healer  about  their  child’s  condition, 
with  26  (32.9%)  parents  indicating  that  they  had  done  so. 
Twenty-two  (84.6%)  of  the  26  parents  had  done  so  before 
seeking  medical  treatment,  eight  (36.4%)  having  found  it 
useful and 16 (76%) noting that they had been advised to seek 
psychiatric treatment at a health facility.

Children’s demographic and clinical 
characteristics

Table 3 indicates that most of the 90 children were male (n = 74, 
82.2%). In terms of age, 57.7% were 10 years and older, 67.7% 
(n = 61) attended mainstream schools, and although 87.7% had 
been diagnosed at least 2 years previously, 95.5% had been on 
treatment for more than a year. 

Source of attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder information
All the parents (N = 79, 100%) reported being informed of 
the  diagnosis  of  ADHD  by  a  medical  doctor,  with  the 
majority being satisfied about obtaining information on the 
diagnosis (N = 77, 97.4%) and treatment (N = 76, 96.2%), but 
data on type and quality of information received were not 
collated.  However,  the  majority  reported  experiencing 
stigma  (N  =  60,  75.9%)  relating  to  their  child’s  illness. 
Although  doctors  (n  =  79,  100%)  and  clinic  staff  (n  =  79, 
100%)  were  the  most  common  providers  of  information, 
there  were  other  sources  (n  =  79,  100%),  such  as  teachers 
(n  =  71,  89.8%),  the  media  (n  =  70.  88,  6%)  (newspaper 
and  television),  the  Internet  (n  =  45,  56.9%)  and  other 
parents (n = 36, 45.5%). Fifty-seven (72.1%) parents mainly

•  Association  between  KADDS  sub-scale  scores  with 

parent characteristics:

The small sample size must be noted as a limiting factor.

In addition, the analysis of the parent’s socio-demographic 
factors  and  KADDS  sub-scale  scores  is  summarised  in 
Table 5. 

Discussion
The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge and 
misconceptions  of  ADHD  among  parents  of  children 
receiving  treatment  for  ADHD  at  an  urban  public  sector 
psychiatric  unit  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  and  to  establish  any 
associations  with  their  socio-demographic  characteristics. 
The key findings of this study were that parents of children 
with ADHD  all  had  knowledge  of  the  diagnosis  of ADHD, 
and  despite  majority  believing  that  they  had  received 
information on diagnosis and treatment from the clinic, there 
was  gaps  in  knowledge  on  symptoms,  treatment  and 
associated features as evidenced by the mean scores for the 
three sub-scales on KADDS. Misconceptions about punishment 
as a treatment modality for ADHD, sugar intake associated 

stimulants 

symptoms, 

causing  addiction  and 
with 
‘outgrowing’ ADHD were most common. In addition, almost 
a third of parents consulted a traditional healer with support 
clinical staff being the main source of knowledge on ADHD.

Consultation with a faith healer

As  per  the  World  Health  Organization,  only  10%  of  people 
with  neuropsychiatric  conditions  are  estimated  to  have 
access to mental health services.22 In South Africa, there is a 
glaring lack of child mental health services, with faith healers 
playing an important role in trying to bridge that gap, as they 
are generally accessible. Providing mental health education 
for  faith  healers  may  facilitate  appropriate  and  timeous 
referral  faith  healers  maybe  the  first  point  of  contact  for 
parents  when  seeking  an  understanding  of  unusual 
behaviour.23 In this study, 32.9% of parents seeking medical 
care at an urban facility consulted a traditional healer, further 
emphasising  the  critical  role  they  play  in  the  local  socio-
cultural context and the need to integrate them in a holistic 
health service. No studies on the extent of traditional health-
seeking behaviour for children with ADHD were found.

Parents’ source of attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder information
All  parents  (100%)  in  this  study  claimed  to  have  received 
information  from  the  medical  staff  of  the  clinic,  the  other 
most  common  sources  being  schoolteachers  (89.8%),  the 
media  (88.6%)  and  Internet  (56.9%).  Other  studies  reported 
the media (radio and television)10,24 as being common sources, 
which  suggests that  access to suitably  trained medical staff 
may  vary  between  countries.  The  most  common  source  of 
information  in  other  studies  is  the  media  (radio  and 
television),10,24  which  is  in  contrast  to  the  findings  of  this 
study where all parents claimed to have received information 
related to ADHD from the treating medical staff of the clinic. 
Media is the third most common cause of information in this 
study. This may represent a form of subjective bias reporting 
from parents or suggests that parents in this context have less 
access  to  media  for  health  education.  This  suggests  that 
health  care  services  need  to  ensure  that  appropriate 
psychoeducation and support around ADHD is provided as 
they  appear  to  be  the  main  source  of  information.  This  is 
critical  in  primary  health  care  settings  where  parents  may 
have  even  greater  challenges  accessing  reliable  knowledge 
sources.

Knowledge of attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder and associated factors

Although all parents were aware of the ADHD diagnosis, the 
mean  scores  for  the  three  sub-scales  of  6.1  (symptom  or 
diagnosis),  6.4  (treatment)  and  6.9  (associated  features) 
(maximum  score  15,  9  and  12)  suggest  that  there  were  still 
gaps in their knowledge.

These  scores  are  consistent  with  the  literature,  which 
demonstrated that parents have knowledge but still harbour 
misconceptions  relating  to  ADHD.13,15,16  The  current  study 
found  no  association  between  educational  level  with 
improved  knowledge  on  any  KADDS  sub-scales.  This  is 
contrary to the literature that higher education is a positive 
factor  in  health-seeking  behaviour.25  Traditionally  studies 
suggest that while the parents recognised that there could 
be  a  behavioural  problem  with  their  children,  their  own 
educational levels may affect their health-seeking behaviour 
lower 
with  relevant  health  authorities.  Parents  of 
educational  and 
less 
knowledgeable about appropriate treatment behaviour for 
their  children  in  other  international  studies;1,26,27  however, 
possibly,  access 
to  a  specialist  service  with  more 
individualised  care  may  have  modified  this  finding.  The 
lack  of  positive  association  between  education  and  better 
knowledge of symptom and treatment sub-scales suggests 
the  need  to  in  addition  further  explore  this  and  other 
parental  variables  in  a  larger  study  that  is  possibly  better 
placed  at  community-level  services  as  access  to  care  may 
also be measured in those contexts.

Misconceptions on Knowledge of Attention 
Deficit Disorder Scale towards attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder

In line with other studies, this study showed some common 
parental  misconceptions  that  are  present  in  research  from 
developed and developing countries.10,16 The misconceptions 
regarding  the  sugar  intake-associated  symptoms  of  ADHD 
(most common misconception in this study), use of stimulant 
leading  to  addiction,  reliance  on  punishment  to  bring 
behavioural  change  and  outgrowing ADHD  were  common 
in this and other studies.28,29,30,31,32,33 An earlier American study 
suggested that black Americans strongly accepted the ADHD 
‘sugar’  aetiology.30  In  the  study  the  authors  proposed  that 
this  may  be  because  of  factors  such  as  different  cultural 
thresholds  and  perception  of  bad  behaviour,  beliefs  that 
ADHD  is  not  a  medical  condition,  discrimination,  lack  of 
trust of health professionals and economic constraints based 
on  socio-cultural  differences.31,32  Perold  and  colleagues 
reported  similar  findings  relating  to  ADHD  and  the  sugar 
myth  amongst  teachers  in  South  Africa,  who  believed  that 
sugar  was  the  cause  and  the  children  would  outgrow  the 
symptoms.18  This  suggests  that  as  health  care  workers,  we 
need  to  provide  more  information  on  the  role  of  diet, 
particularly  sugar  and  ADHD  symptoms.  There  is  also  a 
need  for  more  and  better  qualitative  studies  to  understand 
the influences that drive these misconceptions.

Another common misconception was related to the addiction 
potential of stimulants, as this may be associated with poorer 
medication adherence if the parents have concerns about the 
treatment options. In this study, 67% of parents believed that 
a prolonged use of stimulant medications leads to increased 
risk of substance addiction (i.e. drug, alcohol) in adulthood, 
and  these  findings  being  consistent  with  the  literature.30,34 
This  is  an  important  misconception  that  should  be  more 
actively focussed in psychoeducation as it has treatment and 
prognostic  implications.  Parents  need  to  be  aware  that 
untreated  ADHD  is  a  risk  factor  for  substance  use.35  This 
study did not further explore the associations with regard to 
misconceptions and parental factors as the study sample size 
limits credibility of findings.

The findings of  this study  have  important implications in 
planning various interventions about ADHD education, as 
parents are the most significant role players who influence 
child  health  outcomes.  By  providing  accurate  knowledge, 
relating to misconceptions, myths and misperceptions will 
fade and potentially alter the health-seeking behaviour of 
parents with children of ADHD. Ideally, paediatric mental 
health  care  should  be 
integrated  and  available  at 
community-based  services  to  improve  access  and  allow 
early  referral  of  children  requiring  more  complex  care  to 
specialist services and hence better utilising scarce mental 
health  resources.  This  will  enable  parents  to  have  better 
problem  recognition,  selection  and  utilisation  of  health 
resources.3  The  psycho-education  content  on  ADHD 
therefore needs to be reviewed to address common myths 
held  by  parents.  We  also  need  to  consider  if  the  gaps  are 
because  of  insufficient  staff  training  in  communication 
skills  and  ADHD  knowledge.  We  also  need  to  provide 
information – including tailored information, avoiding use 
of  jargon  and  inviting  questions  for  clarification  and 
providing  psycho-education  in  the  first  language  such  as 
isiZulu  for  parents  so  that  it  bridges  their  gaps  in 
knowledge.

Limitations
The study had several limitations such as the small sample 
size,  which  limit  generalisability,  and  the  study  setting 
being  in  an  urban  area  and  at  a  specialist  hospital,  which 
may prevent the results being generalisable to other settings. 
The  inclusion  of  English-speaking  parents  only  may  have 
biased the sample, as many people attending public sector 
facilities  speak  isiZulu  as  their  first  language,  their 
knowledge and misconceptions were not captured and they 
may have been more vulnerable to poorer psycho-education 
as  some  information  may  be  lost  in  translation.  The 
convenience  sampling  and  the  participants’  profile  are 
not representative of the national South African demography 
that  may  further  limit  the  generalisation  of  the  findings. 
Although  the  KADDS  has  been  used  in  the  South African 
setting,  the  lack  of  a  validated  multilingual  tool  to  assess 
ADHD  knowledge  and  misconceptions  in  this  setting  is 
another limitation. However, the study does provide insight

into  parent’s  knowledge  and  perceptions  of  ADHD  in  an 
African mental health care setting.

Recommendations
There is a need for more focussed psychosocial interventions 
to address the gaps in knowledge and misconceptions held 
by  parents  of  children  with  ADHD.  A  community-based 
participatory  research  study  would  be  useful  to  determine 
needs and more appropriate, sustainable interventions.

Conclusion
The study findings reveal substantial knowledge gaps among 
parents  of  children  with  ADHD  regarding  treatments  and 
associated features of ADHD and the need to consider more 
appropriate  interventions  to  address  these  better  in  clinical 
staff  and
