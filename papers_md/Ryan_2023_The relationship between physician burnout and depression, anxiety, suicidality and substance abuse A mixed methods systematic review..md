Introduction: The World Health Organization deﬁnes burnout as a problem
associated with employment, a category distinct from psychological disorders
such as depression, anxiety, suicidality and disorders of substance abuse.
Evaluating the association between burnout as an occupational exposure and
psychological morbidity may indicate that burnout can act as an occupational
risk factor for mental ill-health. The systematic review explores this relationship
in physicians due to the increased risk in this population and the implications for
healthcare delivery.

Methods: A mixed methods systematic review of the literature was conducted
across Medline, Cinahl Plus, PsycInfo, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library.
Databases were systematically searched using keywords relating to physician

articles were screened for eligibility by two independent researchers. Data
extraction was performed and studies assessed for risk of bias. Quantitative and
qualitative results were integrated using a convergent segregated approach and
results portrayed as a narrative synthesis.

Results: Sixty-one articles were included in the review. There was notable
heterogeneity in the measurement and criteria used to deﬁne burnout limiting
the assimilation of results. Despite this, all studies that measured the association
between depression and burnout reported a signiﬁcant association. Studies
that reported association between burnout and anxiety were similarly uniformly
consistent. Most studies that reported the association between burnout and
suicidality indicated that a signiﬁcant association exists however difficulty in
measurement of suicidality may have inﬂuenced variability of results. The reported
association between substance abuse and burnout was more variable, suggesting
that any association is likely to be weak or inﬂuenced by other variables. Qualitative
studies described the manifestations of chronic workplace stress as well as
perceived links with psychological morbidity. These included lack of time for
work-life balance, the contribution of professional relationships and a culture of
invulnerability that exists among physicians.

Conclusion: The systematic review cannot conclude causality but suggests that
physician burnout is associated with depression, anxiety and suicidality. Qualitative

the need for longitudinal research and provides considerations for intervention
strategies to prevent the development and progression of burnout.

1. Introduction

Burnout

syndrome is a condition caused by excessive
workplace stress and is often characterized by the dimensions
of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal
accomplishment (1, 2). The World Health Organization deﬁnes
burnout as “a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress
that has not been successfully managed” (3). As such, physicians
and other healthcare workers have been identiﬁed as an at-risk
group due to the number of occupational factors associated with the
profession (4, 5). Studies comparing rates of burnout in physicians
to other members of the workforce ﬁnd consistently higher rates
of burnout in physicians (6, 7). Overall prevalence of physician
burnout can be diﬃcult
to quantify given the heterogeneity
deﬁnition criteria for burnout within the literature. However, the
most commonly quoted prevalence estimates are 50% or greater (8)
giving some indication of the scale and gravity of the problem.

Burnout in physicians has well-documented associations with
sub-optimal patient care (9) and poor clinical outcomes, as well as
absenteeism and decreased productivity (10). Mathematical studies
estimating the cost of physician burnout to healthcare systems
suggested an overall cost of $4.6 billion within the American
healthcare system and $7,600 per physician (11). This estimate does
not consider the cost of burnout that is harder to quantify, such as
eﬀect on other healthcare staﬀ and disruption to patient continuity
of care. The association between burnout and outcomes for the
aﬀected individual makes up a smaller proportion of this research
subgroup. Many studies that evaluate individuals with burnout,
consider burnout as an endpoint as opposed to an exposure or
possible risk factor for other outcomes leaving a gap in the literature
of the impact of burnout in relation to secondary associations for
example of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and suicidality for
the physician as an individual (12).

Suicide is among the highest causes of physician mortality
and is reportedly the only cause of death where the risk is higher
among physicians than the general population (13). Rates of suicide
are twice as high among physicians than the general public, with
female physicians being between twice and six times as likely to
die by suicide than other female groups (14). This contrasts with
lower rates of illness such as cardiovascular disease, tobacco-related
cancers and stroke (6). It is likely that lower rates of physical illness
can be accounted for by knowledge of risk factors, the impact
of health-related behavior, symptoms and access to services (7).
This poses the question as to why rates of suicide continue to
be high despite similar knowledge, with few physicians receiving

mental healthcare before their deaths (15). Denial of symptoms,
self-diagnosis and treatment, stigma and concerns about career
prospects have been hypothesized as possible barriers to help-
seeking, although research in this area is limited (16).

Mood disorders such as depression and anxiety which are
also highly prevalent among physicians have been identiﬁed as
important risk factors for physician suicide (16). Lifetime risk of
depression among physicians is suggested to be as high as 15%
for men and 20–30% for women (17) as compared to reported
lifetime risk estimates among the general population of 9% for men
and 15% for women (18). Comorbid substance misuse disorders
are common among physicians with mood disorders, suicidal
ideation or completed suicide (19). Although established, the
relationships between substance abuse, mood disorders and suicide
are complex, and causation is likely to occur in both directions
with some physicians self-medicating due to underlying mood
disorders and in others mood disorders may be precipitated by
substance misuse (20). Overall rates of alcohol and substance
abuse have a similar prevalence to the general population, however
severity of addiction at presentation and late presentation are
features that are more common in this group. Referral to services
is frequently made by concerned colleagues due to absenteeism,
intoxication at work or poor work performance (21). Despite
late presentation, evidence from intervention programs speciﬁcally
targeting physicians suggest highly successful treatment rates for
those who engage with services (22, 23).

Although a relatively small area of burnout

research,
occupational stress and burnout have been identiﬁed as factors
associated with psychiatric morbidity (24, 25). Controversy exists
regarding the nature of the relationship between burnout and
well-deﬁned illness such as depression, anxiety and substance
abuse. For example, researchers have argued that the considerable
overlap between features of depression or clinical anxiety and
burnout would suggest that they should not be considered as
distinct entities (26). Others highlight the importance of the
distinction, which avoids pathologizing burnout as it has the
potential for modiﬁcation at an organizational, structural and
societal level (27) and should therefore only be considered an
occupational risk factor for the development of psychiatric illness.
As part of the description in the ICD 11, the WHO categorically
states that burnout exists in the context of the workplace and
should not be applied to symptoms that occur in other parts of
life (3). The objective of this research is to further investigate
the relationship between physician burnout and the outcomes of
depression, anxiety, substance abuse and suicidality. Clarifying

the nature of the association between burnout and depression,
anxiety, substance abuse and suicidal ideation may help to identify
strategies required to modify this relationship, an eﬀective point of
intervention as well as the type of specialist services needed.

There has been an exponential increase in the volume of
research conducted into burnout within the last decade (28) and the
range of research goals and interests varies considerably. Burnout
research can be broadly categorized six subgroups; contributing
factors, prevalence, measurement and validation of psychometric
tests, interventions and treatment, consequences of burnout and
studies aiming to determine the underlying physiological processes
or identify biomarkers (28). This research will focus on the
consequences of burnout for physicians, exploring the association
between burnout and outcomes of depression, anxiety, suicidality
and/or substance abuse addressing the gap in the literature for this
association within this high-risk group.

1.1. Aims and objectives

The aim of

this research was to undertake a systematic
review of existing literature to answer the research question
“What is the relationship between physician burnout and depression,
anxiety, suicidality and substance abuse?” using a mixed-methods
approach to both measure the association between burnout (as an
occupational exposure) and each of the speciﬁed outcomes and to
explore the nature of this association.
The research objectives were:

a) To systemically search the literature to identify articles relating
to the association between physician burnout and depression,
anxiety, suicidality and/or substance abuse.

b) To critically appraise and assimilate identiﬁed studies to
describe the association between burnout and outcomes of
depression, anxiety, suicidality and/or substance abuse.

c) Explore the nature of any identiﬁed associations between
burnout and depression, anxiety, suicidality and/or substance
abuse through qualitative literature synthesis.

2. Methods

The study protocol was designed in accordance with
the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Review and
Meta-analysis-Protocol (PRISMA-P) guidelines (29). The protocol
was registered with the International Prospective Register for
Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD 42020172938). Protocol
was adhered to throughout the research process in keeping with
PRISMA guidance. Ethical approval was received from Edinburgh
University Usher ethics committee.

2.1. Research design

A mixed methods systematic review of the literature was carried
out. Burnout as a phenomenon occurs as a result of complex
interaction between environment, personality and experience (30).

To explore the relationship between burnout and depression,
anxiety, suicidality or substance misuse it
is important not
only to measure the degree of association but also explore the
perceived links that account for this association through the lens
of those aﬀected. A mixed methods approach was chosen so that
quantitative ﬁndings may investigate and measure the degree of
association, while qualitative ﬁndings may be used to enrich the
understanding of the social processes involved.

2.2. Search strategy

search terms

for each aspect of

The research question was clariﬁed using a PEO format
(Population, Exposure, Outcome). The PEO format is considered
to be more suitable for research questions relating to etiology
and risk than the traditional PICO (population,
intervention,
comparator, outcome) format (31). A comprehensive selection
of
the research question
were identiﬁed during initial scoping review as well as subject
heading searches of
selected databases. Search terms were
adapted for the key concept headings of (i) physicians, (ii)
burnout, (iii) depression, (iv) anxiety, (v) suicide, and (vi)
substance abuse. Searches were conducted across the following
electronic databases; Medline, Cinahl Plus, PsycINFO, Web of
Science and the Cochrane Library. Relevant articles were also
identiﬁed by means of hand-searching reference lists of included
studies. The ﬁnal
terms used and search strategy for each
database can be seen in Supplementary material 1 limits were
set in terms of publication date or type. Limits were set to
English Language.

2.3. Screening and study selection

Searches of selected databases was performed on February
15th 2020. In keeping with PRISMA guidelines, title/abstract
and full text screening were carried out by two independent
reviewers, with a third reviewer available for any disagreements
should they arise (29). Studies were accepted or rejected based on
predeﬁned eligibility criteria as outlined in Table 1, with reasons for
exclusion recorded.

2.4. Quality assessment

All included studies underwent a quality assessment by two
reviewers. Quantitative studies were assessed using the Joanna
Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool speciﬁc to the study
design, cross-sectional or cohort study (32). Qualitative studies
were assessed using Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP)
Qualitative Research Assessment Tool (33). Both the JBI and CASP
tools allow for objective assessment without scoring systems and
studies may be included or excluded based on results. The format
is similar in both tools with questions regarding potential areas
of bias to be answered as “Yes” “No,” or “Unclear.” For the
purposes of this review, studies were deemed low, moderate, or

2.5. Data extraction

Data was extracted and recorded using pre-piloted data
extraction forms. Using a parallel approach to data extraction,
quantitative and qualitative studies were assessed separately
using diﬀerent data extraction tools. For quantitative studies
the following data was recorded; (i) bibliographic information,
(ii) study design, (iii) study population characteristics—type of
physician, stage of training, (iv) number of participants, (v)
measure of burnout used, (vi) what outcome(s) were measured,
(vii) measure of outcome used and (viii) results (i.e., measure of
association). For qualitative studies the following information was
recorded; (i) bibliographic information, (ii) setting, (iii) research
method, (iv) study aims, (v) number of participants, (vi) themes
explored, (vii) data analysis and (viii) authors conclusions.

The search was carried out on February 15th 2020. Initial
searches resulted in 2,159 articles for review. Once duplicates were
removed 1,312 articles remained. One thousand three hundred
and twelve articles underwent title and abstract screening by
two independent reviewers, of which 1,227 were excluded. Three
articles were identiﬁed from reference list searching and included in
full text review. Eighty-eight articles underwent full text screening
by both reviewers. Twenty-seven studies were excluded following
full text screening for reasons outlined in 1. Sixty-one articles were
subsequently included in the systematic review. Of the included
studies, 53 used purely quantitative research methods (35–86), ﬁve
studies contained only qualitative data (87–91) and three studies
were designed using mixed methods (92–94). PRISMA P ﬂow
diagram of search and included studies can be seen in Figure 1.

2.6. Evidence synthesis

Evidence was synthesized using a convergent segregated
method whereby results were analyzed separately, in parallel and
subsequently integrated in a narrative synthesis (34). Aggregation
of quantitative results by means of meta-analysis was limited by
heterogeneity of studies (35). This was primarily due to variation
of population characteristics as well as variability of measurement
tools and criteria used to deﬁne burnout. A descriptive method was
chosen, where results are presented by narrative synthesis. Evidence
was then integrated using a conﬁgurative analysis whereby themes
were compared, linked and juxtaposed between qualitative and
quantitative evidence.

3.2. Quantitative

3.2.1. Quantitative quality assessment

Quality of included studies containing quantitative data was
assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools (95).
The checklist for cross-sectional studies was used to assess cross-
sectional studies and checklist for cohort studies was used to assess
the one included cohort study (36). The checklist for cross-sectional
studies consists of eight questions, each to be answered yes, no
or unclear. In this review studies were given an overall rating
based on answers. Studies were considered to be high quality if
all questions were answered yes, moderate quality if 6–7 questions
were answered yes or any questions answered unclear and low
quality if more than two questions were answered no.

Sixteen cross-sectional studies were given an overall rating of
high quality, 32 studies were deemed to be of moderate quality
and ﬁve were given an overall rating of low quality. The one
included cohort study was given an overall rating of moderate
quality (36). No studies were excluded based on quality, however
quality assessment was used to inform the interpretation of
results. Quantitative quality analysis results table can be seen in
Supplementary Table 2.

3.2.1.1. Study participants

All studies described inclusion criteria that represented the
population of interest in the review. Ten studies (36, 37, 43, 46,
57, 60, 63, 68, 77, 78, 84) did not mention survey response rates.
No deﬁnitive criteria for acceptable survey response rates exist,
however 10 included studies (35, 40, 52, 54, 62, 65, 67, 71, 74, 82, 83)
had response rates of <40% which would be uniformly considered
low (96). All included studies provided detailed descriptions of
participants demographic information.

3.2.1.2. Exposure and outcome measurement

Measurement of exposure was considered low quality in only
four studies (43, 73, 75, 82). One study used a single question
surrogate adapted from the MBI to assess burnout domains
(82). Two studies used measures of overall occupational stress
or distress as measures of burnout (73, 75) and one study
drew correlations from a larger study and therefore did not
describe exposure measurement in detail (43). Studies that used
“self-reported” presence or absence of outcome as a means of
outcome measurement were assessed as low quality as they lacked
external validity.

3.2.1.3. Confounding factors

Thirty-one studies used appropriate methods to account for
potential confounding factors (35, 37, 40, 41, 46, 47, 50, 52–
54, 57, 58, 60, 62–65, 69, 71–77, 80, 82, 83, 85, 86). Of these one used
a control group (44) whereas all others used multivariate analysis to
account for confounders.

3.2.1.4. Cohort follow-up

The one included cohort study did not report loss of follow-
up over time and only included participants that completed
surveys throughout follow-up (36). There was no mention of
incomplete data or eﬀorts made to address incomplete response
rates, indicating possible selection bias.

by combining the results of all domain scores. Other measures
of burnout included the Oldenburg burnout inventory used in
two studies (62, 77) the Copenhagen Burnout inventory (56),
the Burnout Measure (54), the Copenhagen Psychosocial Stress
Questionnaire (75), the Health Professional Stress Inventory (73)
and the Hamburg Burnout Inventory (67) used in one study each.

3.2.2. Quantitative results
3.2.2.1. Study and population characteristics

Quantitative studies consisted of 54 cross-sectional studies
and one cohort study (36). Study populations were well-deﬁned
and covered a range of specialties and grades of physicians.
Twelve studies did not specify grade or specialty but included
all physicians (35, 43, 51–53, 56, 66, 67, 70, 78, 82, 85). One
study speciﬁcally investigated consultant physicians (63) whereas
twenty studies speciﬁcally investigated residents, interns or trainees
(36, 37, 39–42, 44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 54, 55, 62, 69, 73, 74, 81, 93, 97).
Specialties investigated included Internal Medicine (36–39, 57, 69,
75, 77), Psychiatry (38, 41, 61, 79), Orthopedics (40, 71), Obstetrics
and Gynecology (42, 58, 74–76, 86), Pediatrics (44, 57, 75, 93),
Oncology (45, 64, 92), General Surgery (46, 55, 65, 75, 83), Family
Medicine/General Practice (47, 68, 77), Emergency Medicine (48,
57, 73, 81), Intensive care (59, 84), Plastic Surgery (59), Anesthesia
(60, 72, 75, 84), Vascular Surgery (59) and Neurology (75). Number
of study participants per study ranged from 48 (42) to 7,905 (65).
Studies were conducted across 24 countries. The majority were
conducted in the USA (36–38, 42, 46–48, 51, 55, 60, 62, 65, 73, 74,
81–83, 86), four studies were conducted in Japan (50, 64, 79, 93),
three in each of France (40, 45, 71), Turkey (44, 68, 78) and
China (53, 69, 70), two studies in each of Italy (41, 77), Finland
(43, 61) and the UK (58, 63) and one study in all remaining
countries including the Netherlands (39), Egypt (49), Brazil (52),
Hong Kong (35), Lebanon (54), Pakistan (56), Malaysia (57), India
(92), Israel (59), Canada (66), Austria (67), Germany (75), Romania
(76), Mexico (80), Lithuania (84), and Denmark (85). Participation
across all studies was voluntary and subjects were recruited via
hospital email lists, training college registers, governing bodies and
teaching conferences. Among studies that reported response rates,
rates ranged from 16% (67) to 100% (69).

3.2.2.2. Measure of exposure

All studies used a validated measurement tool to assess levels
of burnout. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was the most
frequently used burnout assessment tool, used in 46 studies (35–42,
44–53, 55, 57–61, 63–66, 68–72, 74, 76, 78–86, 92, 93). There were
notable diﬀerences in the interpretation of MBI results with regards
classifying and quantifying burnout. The presence of burnout was
deﬁned as a dichotomous outcome in 23 studies (35, 36, 38, 39, 46,
48–52, 55, 57–59, 64, 65, 69, 80–84, 86), based on one or all domain
cutoﬀ scores. Eleven studies (40, 41, 45, 47, 63, 70–72, 79, 85, 92)
categorized levels of burnout as ordinal variables such as low,
moderate or high based on overall score (40, 41, 45, 47, 63, 70–72,
79, 85) or burnout domain scores (92). Twelve studies interpreted
burnout scores a continuous variable, 10 of which analyzed each
domain score separately (37, 42, 44, 53, 60, 61, 66, 68, 74, 76,
78, 93) and two studies (60, 61) used an overall burnout score

3.2.2.3. Depression

Depression as an outcome was investigated by n = 42 studies
(36–38, 40–42, 44–52, 54–59, 61–64, 66–69, 71–76, 78, 80, 81,
84, 86, 92, 93). Three studies used “self-reported current or
history of depression” as a measure of depression (58, 61, 76)
whereas all others used validated depression screening or diagnostic
questionnaires. The most frequently used questionnaire was the
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), used in 14 studies (37, 38,
40, 41, 45, 46, 50, 54, 55, 62, 64, 84, 86, 92). The PHQ is
most commonly used in its 9-question form (PHQ9), other forms
included the abbreviated PHQ2 and longer PHQ12. The PHQ uses
nine questions to address depression severity and is an abbreviated
version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Health Disorders
Patient Health Questionnaire (PRIME-MD) (98), a diagnostic
instrument for common mental disorders. The full PRIME-MD
tool was used in ﬁve studies (36, 51, 59, 80, 81). Six studies used
the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)
(42, 47, 73, 74, 93, 99). Other tools employed included the Beck’s
Depression Inventory used in four studies (49, 66, 68, 78), the
Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale employed by Karaoglu et al.
(44), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) used by three
researchers (52, 56, 57) and the Harvard National Depression Scale
used by Looseley et al. (72).

3.2.2.3.1. Association of burnout and depression

Despite notable

variation in the measurement

and
interpretation of burnout score, all 45 studies that investigated
the relationship between burnout and depression reported a
statistically signiﬁcant association (36–38, 40–42, 44–52, 54–
59, 61–64, 66–69, 71–76, 78, 80, 81, 84, 86, 92, 93). Thirteen
studies reported the relationship between presence of burnout
and the risk of depression or depressive symptoms as odds ratios
(OR) (40, 45, 52, 57, 58, 61, 62, 67, 69, 71, 80, 84, 86) which
ranged from 0.89 (57) to 10.68 (69). Studies that measured
correlation between overall burnout score or burnout severity
with overall depression score reported similar signiﬁcant results
with correlation measuring between r = 0.41 (61) and r = 0.74
(54, 67). Five studies compared the prevalence of positive
depression screens between those with burnout or high burnout
and those with low or no burnout and evaluated for statistically
(see Figure 2). The only longitudinal
signiﬁcant diﬀerences
cohort study included in the review (36), aimed to evaluate
the association between persistent burnout and depression
in internal medicine residents in Colorado during their ﬁrst
3 years of residency. While they found signiﬁcantly higher
rates of depression in those with persistent burnout they also
reported that both burnout and depression scores decreased
over time.

FIGURE 2
Prevalence of depression in those with burnout compared to those no/low burnout.

Twelve studies evaluated the association between depression
and burnout domains separately (44–50, 61, 63, 64, 68, 78,
92). Consistent signiﬁcant associations were also found between
the EE burnout domain and depression whereas other domains
were less frequently measured, less consistently signiﬁcant and
where signiﬁcant showed weaker association. Correlation between
burnout domain scores and depression scores was measured
by eight studies (44, 47, 49, 50, 63, 64, 68, 78), all of which
found statistically signiﬁcant correlation between EE scores and
depression scores which ranged between r = 0.16 (64) and
r = 0.7 (50). Only four studies found signiﬁcant correlation
between DP and depression scores (47, 49, 63, 78), with 3
other studies reporting correlations that were not statistically
signiﬁcant (50, 64, 68). Correlation that was signiﬁcant was
generally lower than that with EE, between r = 0.3 (78) and
r = 0.6 (49). Only 4 studies used PA as a burnout domain
during analysis as not all studies considered this to be required
for overall measurement of burnout (49, 64, 68, 78). Of these, 3
studies reported signiﬁcant negative correlation between PA and
burnout scores (49, 64, 78) and one reported a correlation that
was not signiﬁcant (68). Similarly, those studies that reported
odds ratios between burnout domains and depression reported
consistently positive associations between EE and depression (45,
46, 61, 92) with less consistent or weaker association with other
domains (45, 46). One of these studies only used the domain
EE for multivariate analysis (92) and one study found that only
EE and overall MBI score were independently associated with
depressive symptoms using logistic regression (61). The studies
which measured the association between burnout and depression
can be seen in Table 2. Results of the association between burnout

and depression categorized by statistical analysis used can be seen
in Supplementary Table 3.

3.2.2.4. Anxiety

Anxiety as an outcome was measured by n = 12 studies (44,
46, 52–54, 56–58, 63, 68, 70, 92). Only two studies assessed anxiety
as their primary outcome (53, 70) both of which used the Zung
Self-rated Anxiety Scale as a measure of anxiety symptoms. One
study used ‘self-reported symptoms’ as a measure of outcome with
all others using validated anxiety questionnaires. The Depression,
Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) was used in two studies (56,
57). Other tools used to measure anxiety included the Hospital
Depression and Anxiety Scale used by Karaoglu et al. (44), the
Speilberg State Trait Anxiety Index and State trait personality Index
used by Lebares et al. (46) and Khan et al. (63), respectively, and the
Beck’s Anxiety Inventory used in one study (68).

3.2.2.4.1. Association of anxiety and burnout

Twelve studies assessed the relationship between burnout or
burnout domains and anxiety (44, 46, 52–54, 56–58, 63, 68, 70, 92),
six of which assessed burnout domains separately (44, 46, 63, 68,
92, 100). Although a fewer number of studies, similar to results
for depression, all studies found signiﬁcant association between
burnout and anxiety or the EE domain and anxiety. Other burnout
domains were less consistently signiﬁcant.

Six studies investigated the association between presence of
burnout or overall burnout score and anxiety symptoms, all of
which reported a signiﬁcant association. Three of these studies
reported the risk of anxiety in the presence of burnout as odds
ratios which ranged between 1.08 (57) and 3.95 (58). Two studies

measured the correlation between burnout scores and anxiety

and 0.47 (70).

Six studies used separate burnout domains and evaluated the
association of at least one domain with anxiety disorders or
symptoms. The largest included study aimed to investigate anxiety
disorders and related factors among 1,134 Chinese physicians (53)
and found signiﬁcant correlation between both EE and DP and
anxiety disorders. The studies which measured the association
between burnout and anxiety can be seen in Table 3. Results of
association categorized by statistical analysis used can be seen in
Supplementary Table 4.

3.2.2.5. Suicidal ideation

Suicidal

ideation or suicidal risk and its association with
burnout was assessed by n = 16 studies (35, 39, 41, 45, 46,
51, 54, 55, 58, 61, 65, 71, 72, 77, 79, 86). The presence or
absence of suicidal ideation as a self-reported binary outcome
was used by ﬁve studies (35, 39, 58, 61, 79). Pompili et al.
(77) used the Beck’s Hopelessness Index as a measure of suicide
risk, a 20-question scale that measures feeling of hopelessness
which has been shown to correlate with suicidal risk (101).
Other tools used included the suicidal ideation component of
the PHQ used in six studies (45, 46, 51, 54, 55, 71), a Suicide
Ideation and Behavior Questionnaire (79) and a suicidal ideation
question from the Meehan Inventory (65) were used in one
study each.

3.2.2.5.1. Association of suicidal ideation and burnout

Fifteen studies investigated the relationship between suicidality
and burnout (35, 39, 41, 45, 46, 51, 54, 55, 58, 65, 71, 72, 77, 79, 86).
Of these only Siu et al. (35) reported on both suicidal ideation
and previous suicide attempts. Ten studies reported signiﬁcant
association (35, 39, 45, 46, 51, 54, 58, 65, 77, 86). Four studies
(40, 41, 61, 72) reported higher levels of suicidal ideation in those
with burnout but without a measure of association or correlation.
One study found no statistically signiﬁcant association between
burnout and suicidal ideation (55).

Only three studies were designed with the primary aim of
investigating suicidal ideation or risk (39, 65, 77) and each of
these reported a signiﬁcant positive association with burnout or
a burnout domain. The largest study investigated 7,900 surgeons
and reported that for each point increase in EE and DP scores
and each point decrease in PA score participants were 5.7 to 10%
more likely to report suicidal ideation (65). They also reported that

the increase in prevalence of suicidal ideation increased in relation
to severity of burnout and that this relationship was independent
of depressive symptoms. Van der Heijdan et al. (39) reported
increased suicidal ideation among 2,000 Dutch medical residents
with burnout (20.7 vs. 7.6% p < 0.0001) as well as signiﬁcant
correlation between burnout domains and suicidal ideation (r =
0.25, p < 0.001; r = 0.17, p < 0.001; r = −0.07, p < 0.01 for
EE, DP, and PA, respectively). Siu et al. (35) reported a statistically
signiﬁcant higher percentage with suicidal ideation in those with
“high” burnout levels compared to “low” burnout levels (10% vs.
2.7, p = 0.03) however there had were no suicidal acts reported
by any participant. The studies which measured the association
between burnout and suicidality can be seen in Table 4.

3.2.2.6. Alcohol and substance misuse

The association between alcohol or substance misuse and
burnout and analyzed by n = 16 studies (35, 42, 43, 46,
47, 54, 58, 60, 62, 72, 80, 82–86). The most frequently used
measurement tool was the Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation
Test (AUDIT) which was employed by six studies (46, 54, 80,
82, 83, 85). AUDIT contains 10 questions that relate to alcohol
consumption and alcohol consumption behavior and acts as a
tool for identifying harmful alcohol consumption (102). Other
outcome measures included the CAGE questionnaire, a four-
question screening tool used to identify harmful drinking habits
(103), which was used in two studies (84, 86). One study used
the Alcohol Behavior Index (43) and one used validated single
question screening tool (62). Self-reported substance use or alcohol
consumption questionnaires with cutoﬀ scores given for harmful
consumption was used in two studies. Substance Misuse was
assessed by four studies (54, 58, 80, 82), two of which used
the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Tool
(ASSIST) while the other two studies used self-reported use
of substances.

3.2.2.6.1. Alcohol and substance misuse

Of the 16 studies that explored the relationship between
burnout and substance misuse, 14 studies reported the association
between alcohol consumption (35, 42, 43, 46, 47, 54, 62, 72, 80, 82–
86) and burnout while only four studies measured the association
with other substances (58, 60, 80, 82). One study speciﬁcally
mentions cannabis use (60) otherwise speciﬁc substances were
not named. Only one study reported a statistically signiﬁcant
association between abuse of substances other than alcohol and
burnout (58).

Fourteen studies reported the relationship between alcohol
misuse and burnout and eight of these reported no signiﬁcant
association. Inconsistent results suggest that any association that
exists is likely to be weak or subject
to other confounding
variables. The three largest studies, that were designed speciﬁcally
to investigate the association between burnout and alcohol misuse
did however report a signiﬁcant positive association (43, 82, 83).
The largest included study was a cross-sectional analysis of over
7,000 surgeons which found that signiﬁcantly more participants
with burnout also had symptoms of alcohol misuse (29.6 vs.
25% p < 0.0001) and alcohol dependence (34.9 vs. 25% p <
0.00001) than those without (82). This study also reported a
signiﬁcant increase in the alcohol misuse or dependence with
increasing frequency of features of EE and DP. Similarly, a large
cross-sectional analysis designed to investigate the association
between alcohol misuse and burnout domains reported positive
association between burnout and risky alcohol behavior (OR 1.89
p < 0.014) and signiﬁcant associations with each burnout domain,
the largest of which being with DP (OR 2.23 p < 0.00001) (85).
This study also investigated the association between burnout and
alexithymia, or the inability to identify and describe feelings (104)
and found a signiﬁcant association. The ﬁndings suggested that
alexithymia acted as a mediator between burnout and alcohol
misuse, particularly between DP and alcohol misuse. The studies

which measured the association between burnout and misuse can
be seen in Table 5.

3.3. Qualitative

3.3.1. Study design and aims

A total of seven qualitative studies were included in the review
(87–92, 94). Five studies were purely qualitative in design (87–
91) and two used mixed methods (92, 94). All qualitative studies
used in depth interviews as a data collection method. Number
of participants ranged from 10 (90) to 47 (88). Qualitative study
characteristics are outlined in Table 6.

3.3.2. Qualitative quality assessment

Quality assessment of qualitative studies was conducted using
the CASP Tool for qualitative studies (33). The included qualitative
studies and their quality appraisal scoring can be seen in
Supplementary Table 6. The tool contains ten questions relating to
research design, recruitment, data collection including relationship
with participants and ethical issues and data analysis and ﬁndings.
Each question is answered yes, no or unclear as appropriate. For the
purposes of this review, studies were given a rating of low, moderate

or high based on number of questioned answered yes. Studies were
considered high quality if nine questions or more were answered
yes, moderate if between ﬁve and eight questions were answered
yes and low if less than ﬁve questions were answered yes.

Three studies were given considered high quality (88, 91, 92),
three were considered moderate quality (89, 90, 94) and one study
was deemed low quality (87).

3.3.2.1. Study design and recruitment

All included studies outlined the aims and research question
clearly and all were suited to qualitative research methods.
Recruitment of participants was clearly described and justiﬁed
by Daruvala et al. (92), Riley et al. (88) and Wainwright et al.
(91) including details regarding whether saturation was achieved
and how this was decided. Spiers et al. (89) attempted to recruit
participants from groups that self-identiﬁed as living with mental
illness as well as groups living without or recovered, however
recruitment for those living with mental illness was much more

successful than other groups. There was no mention of recruitment
method in other studies (87),
introducing the possibility of
selection bias.

3.3.2.2. Data collection

All included studies used in-depth interviews as means of
data collection. All but one study (87) clearly described interview
strategy including whether cues and prompts were used. A
sample of topics guides used were provided two studies (88,
89). The relationship between the interviewer and participants
was addressed by four studies with only one study speciﬁcally
stating that reﬂexivity was practiced by interviewers throughout
the process (88). Potential ethical concerns were discussed and
addressed by four studies (89–92).

3.3.2.3. Data analysis and ﬁndings

Rigorous data analysis was employed by six of the seven
included studies (88–92, 94). This included detailed description of

Work-environment factors featured as an important factor
common to the development of both burnout and mental illness
in six of the included qualitative studies. Findings from Riley
et al. (88) suggest that burnout is most strongly linked to lack
of empathy related to chronic overwork, one study participant
described how “working too many sessions. . . you lose your milk
of human kindness.” The theme of lack of time for personal life and
non-clinical duties including shift duration, lack of leave and night
duty is also explored by both Daruvala et al. (92) and Hamader
et al. (87). Hamader et al. (87) aimed to highlight reasons for
high levels of burnout and depression and ranked lack of sleep,
long shifts, stressful shifts and night shifts among their top causes
of burnout, anxiety and depression. Similarly, Loiselle et al. (94)

and Wainwright et al. (91) document exhaustion due to multiple
commitments and lack of time for non-clinical duties as factors in
the development of burnout and depression. Nearly all interviewees
in Wainwright’s (91) study discussed how both work-related and
non-clinical work-related pressure led to bouts of exhaustion with
one participant describing it as “constantly running on empty.”

3.2.4.2. Chronic workplace stress and interpersonal
relationships

Almost all participants in a report on the experience of general
practitioners living with mental illness describe chronic states of
anxiety at work (88), with some reporting physical symptoms of
anxiety such as panic attacks, hyperventilation and nausea. Other
participants describe features of depression related to work such
as crying on way home from a day’s work or easy irritability and
anger. Spiers et al. (90), Wainwright et al. (91), and Hamader et al.
(87) describe factors identiﬁed as contributing to the development
of chronic work-related stress. Wainwright et al. (91) identiﬁes
a number of participants who spoke about feeling unsupported
and unsafe or on-edge at work. Both Hamader et al. (88) and
Spiers et al. (90) identify lack of collegiality and unsupportive
workplace relationships as a source of work-related stress. One
participant used language described as “violent” when describing
the interactions with colleagues such as “awful,” “livid,” and “blood
bath” (90). However, Spiers et al. (90) and Wainwright et al. (91)
also discuss and acknowledge the protective role of supportive work
environments and relationships. Wainwright et al. (91) describes
the importance of sharing the training experience with peers and
Spiers et al. (90) gives numerous examples of how the supportive
relationships oﬀer an outlet for inevitable work-related distress.

3.2.4.3. Culture of invulnerability

When investigating barriers and facilitators to help seeking
among distressed physicians Spiers et al. (90) identiﬁes a “culture of
invulnerability” among physicians, with similar themes described
by Wainwright et al. (91), Loiselle et al. (94), and Riley et al. (88).
Spiers et al. (90) described the pressure toward “presenteeism”
among physicians with several participants describing being ill as
a sign of failure. Riley et al. (88) also describes the perception of
illness as “failure” or as one interviewee describes it the belief “that
you’re not strong enough.” Wainwright et al. (91) records how
participants perceived others to think that seeking professional help
is a sign of weakness. An important example of the normalization
of chronic stress and illness is a description of how suicidal
thoughts can become both constant and normalized among general
practitioners, with one interviewee describing it as “ﬁlling his
waking thoughts and nights” (88). Loiselle et al. (94) attributes the
normalization of chronic stress to lack of knowledge of self-care and
concludes that this has implications for managing burnout which
ultimately leads to clinical depression.

3.2.3.4. Intervention targets

Three studies discuss possible intervention targets to prevent
the development of work-related stress, burnout, depression and
anxiety. Similar to the overarching themes, described in all studies,
intervention targets broadly relate to work conditions and time

include “asserting boundaries” such as not taking on too much and
therefore maintaining a work-life balance. Wainwright et al. (91)
also highlights the importance of time for non-clinical activities
as a target to prevent the development of burnout, anxiety and
depression. Both Hamader et al. (87) and Wainwright et al. (91)
describe how adequate support, supervision and mentorship may
be preventative, by providing psychological support and promoting
collegial exchange. Spiers et al. (90) and Wainwright et al. (91)
discuss the need to address stigma and move toward a culture
change that acknowledges and supports distress at work. Finally,
Wainwright et al. (91) highlights a recognition among physicians
about their own responsibility for self-care, an important target for
managing chronic occupational stress.

4. Discussion

4.1. Integration of qualitative and
quantitative ﬁndings

Quantitative ﬁndings suggest signiﬁcant relationships between
physician burnout and depression and anxiety but less signiﬁcant
or unclear relationships between physician burnout and substance
abuse and suicidality. Qualitative studies explored factors related
to burnout, anxiety, depression and suicidality as a continuum and
add insight and depth to the association identiﬁed in quantitative
studies. Key areas explored that relate to the development and
progression of both exposure and outcome included work related
factors such as daily stress and time pressure, challenging or
supportive workplace relationships and culture regarding sick
leave, mental illness and help-seeking. This will be explored further
in the discussion section.

Daily work-related stress exacerbated by the quantity of time
spent at work and the lack of time for personal activities formed
a central theme of qualitative data. Many quantitative studies also
explored and addressed factors described in qualitative interviews
and their mediating roles in the development and progression of
burnout. Williford et al. (55), who found a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in depression scores in those with burnout asked
participants to rank factors that they perceived to be associated
with the risk of developing burnout. The highest ranked factor was
lack of time for exercise, self-care and doing things they enjoyed.
This was followed by conﬂicting work and personal commitments,
a by-product of lack of time. While several quantitative studies
investigated the association between hours worked, shift work
and burnout or outcomes, results were inconsistent. Nomura
et al. (93) and Haik et al. (59) found no signiﬁcant association
between hours worked, night shifts and burnout and Shanafelt et al.
(65) similarly reported no association between hours worked and
suicidal ideation. There were however frequent associations drawn
between outside work activities and decreased levels of burnout
and depression, such as time for self-care (92) and increased levels
of physical activity (47). This might suggest that number of hours
worked or shift patterns may be less important than quality of time
spent not at work and work-life balance. Janko et al. (62) found
higher levels of burnout in those without access to programmatic
social events. Wainwright et al. (91) suggests that recognition

of the importance of self-care such as prioritizing outside work
activities may be an important target for the prevention of burnout,
depression and stress.

The role of collegiality and work relationships is another
factor that qualitative studies suggest links workplace stress with
burnout and progression to mental illness. While describing the
experience of physicians living with mental illness, Spiers et al. (89)
describes the inﬂuence of poor work relationships as “sometimes
actively destructive” but also highlights the protective eﬀect of
collegial relationships. Supportive mentorship is suggested as an
outlet for the inevitable work-related stress experienced by general
practitioners. Hyman et al. (60), who found signiﬁcant correlation
between mental composite scores and burnout scores, also found
that professional and personal support was associated with lower
EE scores. Janko et al. (62) also identiﬁed that those in the highest
burnout quartile had higher rates of depression also found that
trainees with a self-identiﬁed mentor had signiﬁcantly lower overall
burnout scores.

Finally, a culture of

invulnerability among physicians is
described by both Hamadar et al. (87) and Riley et al. (88)
whereby admitting personal struggle and accessing support services
is seen as “weakness” or “failure.” Riley et al. (87) noted that
although feelings of chronic anxiety were prevalent among General
Practitioners, even some of those aﬀected did not identify as
having mental
ill-health. One large cross-sectional study that
found a signiﬁcant association between burnout and suicidal
ideation that was independent of depression and symptoms of
depression also found that those with suicidal ideation were less
likely to seek professional help and more likely to self-prescribe
(65). Talih et al. (54) reported a positive association between
burnout, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation and also found
that burnout correlated with self-administration of psychotropic
medication and that more than 50% of those with suicidal ideation
had not sought professional help. Reluctance to seek professional
help was also reported to be associated with burnout by Rath
et al. (86) as well as with depression and substance abuse. Willford
et al. (55) asked study participants to rank barriers to help
seeking in severe burnout, shame and denial ranked among the
highest reasons for not accessing support services. Spiers et al.
(89) noted that no participant spontaneously spoke about available
support services despite describing personal issues with burnout
and mental health.

None of the included qualitative studies explored alcohol or
substance abuse as an outcome of burnout or occupational stress.
This adds weight to the inconsistent ﬁndings of quantitative
studies, suggesting that substance or alcohol abuse may be a
coping mechanism that is more individual speciﬁc instead of
directly correlated.

4.2. Findings in the context of existing
literature

A review of burnout literature that analyzed quantity and
content of publications prior to 2011 described an exponential
rise in relevant material after 2005 (28). Considering that studies
included in the current systematic review were predominantly

Frontiers in Public Health

15

frontiersin.org

Ryan et al.

10.3389/fpubh.2023.1133484

published after this date, it is apparent that its relevance continues
to increase. The large volume of recently published material
prompts the need for methodologically appropriate assimilation
and interpretation of data. While a number of systematic reviews
of the literature have been published, the focus primarily has
been on prevalence in diﬀerent subgroups, interventions, and the
impact on patient centered outcomes such as patient safety and
quality of healthcare delivery. To the best of our knowledge this
is the only systematic review to investigate the relationship between
physician burnout and the speciﬁc outcomes of depression, anxiety,
suicidality and substance abuse and to include qualitative ﬁndings
to explore the perceived links between exposure and outcome.

The results of this review indicate a consistently positive and
strong association between burnout and depression and between
burnout and anxiety. This is in keeping with ﬁndings among other
occupations. Koutsimani et al. (108) reported similar ﬁndings in a
systematic review that examined the relationship between burnout
and depression and burnout and anxiety in all employed adults.
The review included only studies that measured correlation and
performed a meta-analysis. It was noted that the correlation was
not so strong as to suggest that burnout, depression or anxiety
are the same entity and concludes that treating them as separate
constructs will have implications for potential intervention and
targeted solutions. There was also signiﬁcant heterogeneity of
included studies in the review, for reasons similar to those that
precluded meta-analysis in the current review.

The current systematic review found inconsistent association
between burnout and suicidality and between burnout and
substance abuse. Suicide has a well-documented association with
depression, however despite similar prevalence of depression
among physicians and the general population (109) rates of suicide
are higher (110). The question remains as to whether burnout
acts a predictor of suicidality independent of depression. Shanafelt
et al. (65) reported a strong association between burnout and
suicidal ideation that increases with burnout severity and argues
that burnout is an independent risk factor after controlling for
depression. Medical students were excluded from the current
review however a large cohort study of American medical students
also found burnout to be independent risk factor for suicidal
thoughts and reports reversibility of suicidal ideation with recovery
from burnout over time (109). Inconsistencies in results regarding
suicidality may be attributed to the challenges measuring suicidal
ideation or diﬀerence between suicidal ideation and overall suicide
behavior. Suicidal
ideation is one of the strongest predictors
for suicidal acts (111) but is subjective and notoriously diﬃcult
to measure (112). Both stigma and “normalization” of suicidal
thoughts, as described in qualitative studies included in the review,
may lead to study participants denying true intentions. A study
that investigated whether the suicidal ideation section of the PHQ 9
predicted suicide in American Veterans found that suicidal ideation
as indicated by response to PHQ 9 was signiﬁcantly associated with
death by suicide. It was also reported however, that 71% of suicides
that occurred during the study time period occurred among those
who reported no suicidal ideation (113).

Findings relating to alcohol and substance misuse favor no or
very small association with burnout with the majority of studies
ﬁnding no signiﬁcant association. Four studies did ﬁnd increased
rates of alcohol misuse in those with burnout indicating that an

association may exist. Pederson et al. (85) noted a signiﬁcant
association that was strongest in the DP domain. DP has been
discussed in the literature as a coping strategy for EE (114). It
may follow that substance and alcohol abuse may be a maladaptive
coping mechanism employed by some physicians with burnout
instead of directly and uniformly correlated. It is likely that genetic
predisposition, opportunity and personal factors also contribute
(115). A qualitative analysis of physicians abusing prescription
medication found that those using substances to alleviate stress
and anxiety had initially been using the medication to manage pain
and were self-prescribing, indicating that substance misuse did not
necessarily directly result from stress but may occur as a form of
self-treatment (116). Measurement of substance and alcohol misuse
present similar challenges as often those eﬀected will be reluctant to
admit to the problem for fear of repercussion.

Only seven qualitative studies that addressed the research
question were identiﬁed by the current review indicating a
relative scarcity of qualitative data. However, qualitative research
surrounding burnout as a phenomenon does exist. A systematic
review and qualitative metasynthesis of physician’s perspectives on
burnout describes organizational, relation and individual factors
associated with the development of burnout (117). The review
ranks and structures the factors as a timeline. The development
of burnout is described as beginning with organizational factors
such high workload, stress and lack of time, followed by relational
factors including relational diﬃculties with other professionals
and ultimately individual factors such as guilt, helplessness and
doubt are experienced last. Factors highlighted as protective
mirror stress factors but are ranked in the opposite direction.
Individual protective factors such as self-care were considered
most important followed by supportive relationships and ﬁnally
organizational factors. The researchers point out that those aﬀected
will protect themselves individually ﬁrst and foremost but suggest
that relation and organization protective factors should play a
more prominent role in the prevention of burnout, given their role
in its development. Although this qualitative analysis of burnout
contains no mention of other psychological outcomes, many of
the same themes are explored in relation to the progression of
burnout and development of mental illness in the current review.
This would suggest that the factors identiﬁed as risk factors for the
development of burnout may be implicated in the development of
depression, anxiety or suicidal ideation without intervention.

Qualitative studies included in the current review explore both
a “culture of invulnerability” that exists among physicians and
“normalization” of chronic stress, anxiety and features of mental
illness including suicidal thoughts. These factors are explored as
barriers to help seeking that may contribute to the progression of
burnout to psychological morbidity. This may also oﬀer insight
into the reason for the timeline of protective factors described
by Sibeoni et al. (117). Admitting to personal struggle has been
described as “failure” or “weakness” thus prompting physicians
to seek individual solutions such as resilience and self-care ﬁrst.
Lebares et al. (118) found that mindfulness and resilience traits were
associated with lower levels of burnout, anxiety and depression
but also suggests that organizational based interventions should be
developed concomitantly. Fostering a healthy work environment
would support the individual while allowing them to draw on
their natural strengths. This is supported by two systematic reviews

Frontiers in Public Health

16

frontiersin.org

Ryan et al.

10.3389/fpubh.2023.1133484

designed to investigate and compare burnout interventions that
suggest that organizational based interventions have a higher
treatment eﬀect (119) which is longer lasting (120) than individual
based interventions.

In a systematic review that examines the personal and
professional consequences of burnout in physicians, Williams et al.
(121) describes the phenomenon of burnout as a “loss spiral”
or “burnout cascade.” It is hypothesized that the severity of
consequence relates to the progression of burnout. Initially loss of
empathy or intention to leave predominate, followed by depression
or anxiety and ﬁnally suicidal ideation or physical health problems
at the terminal end of the spectrum. Burnout is considered as
a continuum rather than an end-state and research attesting to
positive association between burnout and all factors considered
to be relevant to the “loss spiral” is explored. This study most
closely relates to the current review and ﬁndings complement one
another. Both report signiﬁcant association between burnout and
depression and burnout and anxiety. These outcomes are studied
in more detail in the current review with inclusion of more relevant
studies adding weight and credibility to the association. The current
review ﬁnds a weaker association between burnout and suicidality
which may be accounted for by the association only occurring
in the case of severe or end-stage burnout as is described by
Williams et al. (116). Williams et al. (116) reports an association
with alcohol abuse and it is described as a means of coping with
increasing distress. The current review questions this association as
results are inconsistent and favor no direct association. However,
as discussed, individual coping style and personal factors may
account for the link between burnout and alcohol abuse. Williams
et al. (116) discuss the need for organizational processes and
eﬀective leadership in preventing progression through the burnout
cascade through targeted interventions. Changing the workplace
culture that discourages help-seeking and promoting team-work
and support are described as “resources” that make up for the loss
in the “loss spiral.” Qualitative ﬁndings from the current review
that explore workplace stress, burnout, depression, anxiety and
suicidality as continuum support this view.

4.3. Limitations

There was limitation from the review methods and search
strategy chosen as due to language and budgetary constraints,
studies with no English translation were excluded allowing for
potential exclusion of relevant studies.

There is considerable heterogeneity of

included studies
particularly relating to population characteristics and measurement
of exposure and outcome. This not only precludes meta-analysis
of results but may also aﬀect the generalizability of ﬁndings.
Most studies featured subgroups of physicians and focused on
either one institution or one group of institutions. Although study
results are not suﬃciently diﬀerent as to suggest that degree of
association was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between subgroups, caution
must be taken when considering study results together. There were
also notable diﬀerences in method of measurement of exposure
and interpretation of measurement results. Although the most

commonly used measurement tool was used in 46 of 54 studies,
interpretation of measurement score was much more variable.
While 17 studies evaluated burnout domain scores as separate
continuous variables as is recommended by MBI guidelines (114)
the remainder used alternative interpretations such as deﬁning
burnout “cutoﬀ ” scores and evaluating burnout as a dichotomous
variable. While rationale for interpretation is clearly outlined in all
studies, diﬀerences may inﬂuence overall strength of association as
the interpretation of exposure is not consistent across all studies.
Previous systematic reviews have noted diﬀerences in eﬀect sizes
when diﬀerent measurement tools are used and speciﬁcally noted
lower eﬀect sizes when the MBI is used compared to other burnout
measurement tools (122). Results may therefore diﬀer depending
on measurement tool used and may distort results when considered
as a whole.

This review was carried out prior to the increase in burnout
literature relating to physicians and burnout related to the COVID
pandemic. Future studies could update this review encompassing
evolving literature studying the association of depression, anxiety,
substance abuse and suicidality within the context of workplace
burnout during and after the COVID Pandemic.

There are a number of limitations within the included studies
which need to be considered. For example the participants of
included studies may have been subject to selection bias and
not representative of the study population. By design cross-
sectional analysis is vulnerable to selection bias (123). Participation
was voluntary across all studies and therefore respondents may
represent a self-selected group. Speciﬁc to this review, participants
with burnout may be less likely to respond due to lack of time or
motivation or alternatively more likely to respond due to interest
in the subject matter. This can be addressed with sample size
calculation or high response rates. Many studies used internet-
based surveys to address conﬁdentiality concerns and encourage
response rates. Recall bias can play a role in the measurement
of exposure and outcome. Cross-sectional analysis takes place in
a single moment in time and therefore responses may only be
representative of current state or short time-period prior to survey
as opposed to overall long-term state. Further to this cross-sectional
analysis allows for limited means to account for confounding
factors may distort reported association between exposure and
outcome (123). Only half of
included studies addressed the
possibility of confounding. One study used a control group to
control for confounding; however, this study was deemed to have
low overall quality.

Additionally, often there was inability of study design to
the depression or
determine causality. Many studies report
depressive symptoms as a risk factor for burnout calling into
question the direction of causality.

5. Conclusion

The current systematic review presents ﬁndings suggestive of
a signiﬁcant association between both burnout and depression
and burnout and anxiety in physicians and an important
relationship between burnout and suicidality. The relationship
between substance misuse and physician burnout is less clear
with results indicating that any association may be related to
speciﬁc components of burnout or confounded by other personality
or environmental variables. Lack of longitudinal data limits any
assumption regarding causality or direction of the association
and is therefore a suggested target for future research. Similarly,
heterogeneity of criteria used to deﬁne burnout limits comparison
of results and future research may beneﬁt from consensus regarding
burnout measurement. Detailed description of the manifestations
of chronic workplace stress, burnout, depression, anxiety and
suicidal
ideation provided by qualitative results highlighting
the importance, nature and consequences of the relationship.
Qualitative data also suggests perceived links that facilitate the
progression of workplace stress and burnout to psychological
outcomes including lack of time for work-life balance, a workplace
culture that normalizes psychological distress acting as a barrier to
help-seeking and poor collegial relationships. The WHO deﬁnes
burnout as a problem related to employment (3). Our results
indicate that as such it may act as risk factor for more serious
psychological morbidity in physicians and that both individual and
organizational interventions may be beneﬁcial.
