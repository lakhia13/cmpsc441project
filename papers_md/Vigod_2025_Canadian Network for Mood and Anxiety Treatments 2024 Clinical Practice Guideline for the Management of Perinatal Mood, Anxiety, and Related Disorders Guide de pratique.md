Abstract
Background: The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) publishes clinical practice guidelines for
mood and anxiety disorders. This CANMAT guideline aims to provide comprehensive clinical guidance for the pregnancy and
postpartum (perinatal) management of mood, anxiety and related disorders.

Methods: CANMAT convened a core editorial group of interdisciplinary academic clinicians and persons with lived experi-
ence (PWLE), and 3 advisory panels of PWLE and perinatal health and perinatal mental health clinicians. We searched for
systematic reviews of prevention and treatment interventions for perinatal depressive, bipolar, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive
and post-traumatic stress disorders (January 2013–October 2023). We prioritized evidence from reviews of randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs), except for the perinatal safety of medications where reviews of large high-quality observational studies
were prioritized due to the absence of RCT data. Targeted searches for individual studies were conducted when systematic
reviews were limited or absent. Recommendations were organized by lines of treatment based on CANMAT-deﬁned levels of
evidence quality, supplemented by editorial group consensus to balance efﬁcacy, safety,
tolerability and feasibility
considerations.

Results: The guideline covers 10 clinical sections in a question-and-answer format that maps onto the patient care journey:
case identiﬁcation; organization and delivery of care; non-pharmacological (lifestyle, psychosocial, psychological), pharmaco-
logical, neuromodulation and complementary and alternative medicine interventions; high-risk clinical situations; and mental
health of the father or co-parent. Equity, diversity and inclusion considerations are provided.
Conclusions: This guideline’s detailed evidence-based recommendations provide clinicians with key information to promote
the delivery of effective and safe perinatal mental healthcare. It is hoped that the guideline will serve as a valuable tool for
clinicians in Canada and around the world to help optimize clinical outcomes in the area of perinatal mental health.

Plain Language Summary
The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments publishes guidelines for healthcare providers, to aid them in staying
up-to-date with the latest and best evidence around treatments for mood and anxiety problems. This is the ﬁrst time that
CANMAT is publishing a guideline that focuses speciﬁcally on mental health during pregnancy and postpartum (the perinatal
including both medication and non-medication
period). The guideline primarily focuses on treatment recommendations,
options. It explains when and how to use these treatments to make sure they are as effective as possible. Importantly, the
guideline was developed in close collaboration with a diverse group of people, including people who have experience with
mood and anxiety problems during the perinatal period, as well as clinicians from various ﬁelds of expertise. In creating
this guideline, we reviewed scientiﬁc papers that combine results from multiple studies and considered the quality of the
research when making recommendations. We also aimed to include equity, diversity and inclusion in our considerations.
We hope that this clinical guideline will be a helpful tool for healthcare providers to improve care for people experiencing
mental health issues during pregnancy and after childbirth.

Résumé
Avant-propos Le Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) publie des guides de pratique pour les
troubles de l’humeur et les troubles anxieux. Le présent guide du CANMAT vise à offrir des lignes directrices complètes pour
la prise en charge pendant la grossesse et le post-partum (périnatal) des troubles de l’humeur, de l’anxiété et des troubles
connexes.

Méthodes Le CANMAT a réuni un groupe de rédaction interdisciplinaire composé de cliniciens du monde universitaire, des
personnes ayant un vécu expérientiel (PAVE) et 3 comités consultatifs formés de PAVE, de cliniciens spécialisés en santé
périnatale et de cliniciens spécialisés en santé mentale périnatale. Nous avons recherché des revues systématiques portant sur
des interventions préventives et thérapeutiques pour les troubles suivants en période périnatale : troubles dépressifs, bipolaires,
anxieux, obsessionnels-compulsifs et de stress post-traumatique (janvier à octobre 2023). Nous avons privilégié les données
probantes issues des revues d’essais contrôlés randomisés (ECR), à l’exception de notre évaluation de l’innocuité périnatale des
médicaments, où nous avons donné la priorité aux synthèses d’études observationnelles de grande envergure et de haute qualité
en raison de l’absence de données issues d’ECR. Des recherches ciblées d’études individuelles ont été effectuées lorsque les
synthèses systématiques étaient limitées ou inexistantes. Les recommandations ont été organisées par lignes de traitement sur la
base des critères établis par le CANMAT pour la qualité des données, ainsi qu’en nous appuyant sur le consensus du groupe de
rédaction pour assurer l’équilibre de diverses considérations, notamment l’efﬁcacité, l’innocuité, la tolérabilité et la faisabilité.
Résultats Ce guide comporte 10 sections cliniques sous forme de questions-réponses qui suivent le parcours de soins du patient :
dépistage; organisation et prestation des soins; approches non pharmacologiques (psychosociales, psychologiques ou liées au mode
de vie), pharmacothérapies, neuromodulation, interventions complémentaires et alternatives; situations cliniques à risque élevé; et
santé mentale du père ou de la partenaire. Le guide tient compte des principes d’équité, de diversité et d’inclusion.
Conclusions Les recommandations détaillées de ce guide, fondées sur des données probantes fournissent aux cliniciens des
renseignements pertinents pour promouvoir la prestation de soins de santé mentale qui sont sûrs et efﬁcaces en période
périnatale. Nous espérons que cette ligne directrice s’avérera un outil précieux pour les cliniciens du Canada et du
monde entier aﬁn d’optimiser les résultats cliniques dans le domaine de la santé mentale périnatale.

Introduction

Mood, anxiety and related disorders are some of the most
common conditions that arise in pregnancy and in the year
after childbirth.1–3 When untreated or undertreated, perinatal
mood, anxiety and related disorders (PMADs) can negatively
impact the well-being and quality of life of affected persons,
and the health and development of their children and fami-
lies.3,4 This makes the identiﬁcation and management of
PMADs a public health priority.

Clinical practice guidelines can synthesize best practices to
help guide the delivery of timely, effective, high-quality care.5
The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments
(CANMAT) is a not-for-proﬁt scientiﬁc and educational organiza-
tion that produces clinical guidelines outlining the latest research
and treatment options for managing mood, anxiety and related
disorders (www.canmat.org). Previous CANMAT guidelines
for major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder
(BD) included sections on perinatal populations.6,7 This
PMAD-speciﬁc CANMAT guideline aims to provide a
more comprehensive guidance on best practices in care and
engage a target audience beyond psychiatrists to include all cli-
nicians (e.g., family physicians, midwives, nurses, obstetricians,
pediatricians, psychotherapists, social workers and others) who
may require this knowledge for case identiﬁcation, referral and/
or management.

This guideline summarizes the evidence for interventions to
including speciﬁcally MDD,
prevent and treat PMADs,
anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorders (OCD),
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and BD in pregnancy
and up to 1 year postpartum. Postpartum psychosis, a severe
postpartum clinical presentation that is strongly associated
with bipolar disorder, is also included. The guideline also
covers clinical presentations of mood, anxiety and related dis-
orders that are unique to the perinatal period such as fear of
childbirth and symptoms of PTSD that arise in relation to
experiences of trauma around the time of birth, sometimes
termed childbirth-related PTSD (CB-PTSD). While other
types of mental disorders also affect people in pregnancy
and/or postpartum—on their own or comorbid with PMADs
(e.g., autism, attention-deﬁcit-hyperactivity disorder, eating
disorders, personality disorders, substance and alcohol use dis-
orders and others)—they were considered to be outside the
scope of this initial guideline.

Throughout the guideline, we strive to use language inclu-
sive of women and gender-diverse childbearing people and
their partners, including those who are transgender, non-binary
and two-spirit.8,9 We aimed to include evidence related to
equity, diversity and inclusion in each section of the guideline,
focusing on speciﬁc considerations related to age, sexual and
gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture and disability.

Key Caveats

There are some key caveats to consider when reading this guide-
line. First, while the ﬁrst year postpartum is a conventional cut-off
point in the literature, many PMADs continue beyond this period.
The evidence and recommendations in this guideline may still be
applicable after the ﬁrst year postpartum, especially when consid-
ering issues related to lactation and interventions adapted to focus
on parenting or the maternal-child dyad. Second, in the PMAD
literature, many studies utilize symptom scales, and not diagnostic
interviews for study inclusion. While symptom scales correlate
highly with diagnostic interviews, it is difﬁcult to differentiate
in some cases whether the results of such research would apply
to those with diagnosed PMADs speciﬁcally.10 Many individuals
with PMAD symptoms—even when they do not meet diagnostic
criteria for a mental disorder per se—may beneﬁt from treatment,
but throughout the guideline we aim to distinguish between inter-
ventions evaluated in populations with elevated symptoms versus
those with diagnosed disorders when possible. Third, while the
guideline is meant to assist clinicians in managing PMADs
using an evidence-based approach, it is not meant to replace clin-
ical judgement nor is it a legal or policy care standard. Clinicians
and decision-makers will want to consider the recommendations
in the context of their own settings (e.g., availability of speciﬁc
psychotherapies, medication and/or other treatments) and their
local regulations of clinical practice. Fourth, the guideline evi-
dence review is updated to October 2023, so clinicians are encour-
aged to keep up to date with the latest research so as to provide
their patients with the best possible care. Finally, the guideline
is written in technical, academic language, with the target audi-
ence being healthcare professionals. This is not necessarily
easily accessible for patients or families who are trying to decipher
the guidelines for their own personal educational needs, so there
will be an accompanying Patient and Family Guide.

Methods

The development of the guideline followed the structured meth-
odology of previous CANMAT guidelines.7,11 The project was
led by a core editorial group of 15 PMAD experts spanning psy-
chiatry, psychology, pediatrics, nursing and public health, and 2
persons with lived experience (PWLE). Meetings of the core
group were biweekly by video-conferencing for the duration of
the project (April 2023 to October 2024), supplemented by
email communication. The project received input from the
CANMAT Board and 3 advisory panels comprising 27 individu-
als with diverse experiences and backgrounds from across
Canada: (a) PWLE (n = 10), (b) non-mental health clinical
experts,
including midwifery, obstetrics and gynecology,
nursing, pediatrics and primary care (n = 8) and (c) perinatal
mental health clinicians (n = 9)
(Supplement 1. Advisory
Panels). Advisory panel members were engaged for input and
feedback through structured surveys, email communication,
focus groups and 1:1 discussions with the co-leads and other
members of the project team.

Scope and Structure

The current guideline follows a question-and-answer format, with
a focus on clinical questions relevant to the management of
PMADs (Table 1). The questions were initially drafted by the
core editorial group and CANMAT Board, then revised based
on feedback from the advisory panels. Advisory panel members
were asked to provide input on the nature and importance of the
questions, how they were worded, and the rank order in which
questions should be presented. They were also asked their per-
spective on whether there were any key clinical questions
missing and the extent to which equity, diversity and inclusion
were addressed. Feedback was reviewed and incorporated by
the core editorial group, who approved the ﬁnal set of questions
by consensus agreement. The ﬁnal questions were then shared
back to the advisory panel members.

Evidence Review

systematic

and French-language

PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL,
Cochrane and Web of Science databases were searched for
English-
and
meta-analyses published from 1 January 2013 to 29 October
2023. A list of key terms and subject headings were developed
by the team, and reﬁned by a medical librarian, according to 2
concepts: (a) mood, anxiety and related disorders and (b) the
perinatal life stage. Large well-conducted randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) are the highest standard of evidence, so we priori-
tized reviews that synthesized the results of RCTs in the current

reviews

guidelines. In the absence of systematic reviews of RCTs (e.g.,
for medication safety in pregnancy), systematic reviews of
large observational studies were included. Targeted searches
for single RCTs and other studies were conducted when sys-
tematic review data were limited or absent (Supplement 2.
Search Strategy).

After removing duplicates, 12,718 articles were identiﬁed
for title and abstract screening, 733 underwent full-text
review and 470 systematic reviews of interventions (RCTs,
or observational studies in the setting of medications in preg-
nancy only) were identiﬁed (Supplement 2). Due to a paucity
of systematic reviews relevant to BD, a targeted search on
case identiﬁcation and pharmacotherapy was conducted,
resulting in an additional 89 studies. During study selection,
articles on epidemiology and key foundations of manage-
ment not explicitly covered in the 10 guideline questions
and other clinical practice guidelines were ﬂagged as poten-
tial reference documents, but not included for data extraction
or quality appraisal (N = 942). Study selection was com-
pleted by 2 independent reviewers, with a third reviewer to
adjudicate conﬂicts.

Data extraction and quality appraisal were conducted in 2
stages. First, to prioritize the most contemporary evidence,
data from included studies published in the 5 years prior to
the end of the search date (2018–2023) were extracted and
appraised. If the reviews published in the 5 years prior to the
search date did not provide adequate data for recommenda-
tions to be made, data were extracted and appraised from the
remaining reviews. In the end,
this was done only for
Question 9. In total, data were extracted from 298 of the
studies included in the search using a standardized data extrac-
tion form based on the Template for Intervention Description
and Replication checklist. Quality appraisal was based on the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and
Evaluations framework.12,13

After data extraction and quality appraisal,

the authors
assigned a “Level of Evidence” to each type of prevention or treat-
ment intervention based on study design, size and quality for the

totality of the evidence, as deﬁned in previous CANMAT guide-
lines (Table 2). The section leads of the given question/section (3
to 5 authors/section) reviewed the quality appraisal of the articles
pertaining to their speciﬁc sections and assigned the Level of
Evidence based on the criteria in Table 2. Any discordance was
resolved through input of the co-leads and additional authors
when necessary to reach a consensus decision. In this guideline,
green circles are used to indicate that there is positive empirical
evidence that the intervention is effective, and red squares are
used when there is empirical evidence that the intervention is
not effective. Blue circles are used to represent the strength and
quality of the evidence on safety of the intervention in pregnancy
and/or lactation. The blue circles do not indicate whether the
safety proﬁle is favourable or not, only the Level of Evidence
available.

Recommendation Development Process

Each core editorial group member and CANMAT board
member co-author was assigned to one or more of the guideline
questions. Recommendations were developed based on the
level of evidence available for efﬁcacy and clinical support
for the intervention, namely the balance between efﬁcacy,
safety, tolerability and the feasibility of applying the interven-
tion perinatally (Table 3). For example, a treatment with Level
1 evidence for efﬁcacy could be recommended as a second- or
third-line treatment option (or not recommended) due to
concern about its safety, side effect proﬁle or feasibility of its
use. In addition, as there are no RCTs of medications in preg-
nancy (and few in the postpartum), Level 3 and Level 4
perinatal-speciﬁc evidence on efﬁcacy, safety and tolerability
of medications was combined with efﬁcacy and tolerability evi-
dence from non-perinatal populations to inform the recommen-
dations. For example, a medication with Level 1 evidence for
efﬁcacy non-perinatally for which there is also high-quality
reassuring Level 3 evidence for safety in perinatal populations
could be considered a ﬁrst-line treatment even in the absence of
perinatal-speciﬁc efﬁcacy data. In contrast, a medication with

Note. For Level 1 and Level 2, RCTs are required (adequate sample size is at least n ≥ 30 per treatment arm). Recommendations from epidemiological data
primarily arise from observational studies, where the highest level of evidence is usually Level 3. Higher order recommendations (e.g., principles of care) reﬂect
higher level judgement of strength of evidence from various data sources and therefore are primarily Level 3 or 4 evidence. RCT = randomized controlled trial.

aClinical support reﬂects the authors’ expert opinion/consensus on the
relevance of the evidence on safety, efﬁcacy and feasibility of the intervention.
For pharmacological treatment recommendations, due to the paucity of
perinatal-speciﬁc randomized controlled trials, Level 3 or 4 evidence on
efﬁcacy and safety in perinatal-speciﬁc populations might be considered
sufﬁcient for a ﬁrst-line or second-line recommendation in the presence of
Level 1 or 2 evidence for efﬁcacy in non-perinatal populations.

Level 1 evidence for efﬁcacy in non-perinatal populations but
with high-quality Level 3 evidence that there are safety con-
cerns in perinatal populations could be downgraded to
second-, third-line or even “not recommended” depending on
the degree/severity of the safety concern.

Preliminary recommendations were presented to the entire
authorship group in a full-day meeting in March 2024 for
initial feedback (in-person, with video-conferencing options
for those unable to travel
to the meeting), followed by
ongoing discussion and consensus meetings within Question
groups, along with the drafting of text to accompany the rec-
ommendations. The 2 project co-leads (SV, BF) then reviewed
and revised each section. Draft recommendations and a full
draft of the guideline were completed in June 2024. The advi-
sory panels were then re-engaged to provide feedback on the
recommendations and their explanations as well as the tone,
language and completeness of the guideline. A ﬁnal draft of
the guideline was approved by the authorship group for sub-
mission for peer review on September 13, 2024.

Epidemiology and Impact

The prevalence of depression at any point in the perinatal period
ranges from 6.5 to 12.9%, with a lower rate when major depres-
sion is conﬁrmed by structured clinical interviews.14 There is a
particularly high prevalence of depression in the postpartum
period, estimated at up to 19% for clinically signiﬁcant depressive
symptoms, and 7% for a major depressive episode (MDE).14,15
The risk for postpartum depression (PPD) is usually highest
within the ﬁrst 6 months of childbirth. This is inconsistent with
the more narrow “peripartum onset” speciﬁer for depressive dis-
orders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders 5th Edition Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) that
is
limited to symptom onset in pregnancy and within the ﬁrst 4
weeks postpartum.15,16

Anxiety is even more common than depression in the perina-
tal period, with rates of clinically signiﬁcant anxiety symptoms
estimated at up to 20%.2,17 The prevalence of the related clinical
presentation of fear of childbirth may be as high as 14%.18

Pooled prevalence of OCD is about 2% perinatally, although
transient obsessions and/or compulsions may be more
common, and there have been reports of transient symptom
worsening perinatally possibly in as many as 70% of those
affected by the illness.19–21 PTSD has an estimated pooled prev-
alence of about 3% in pregnancy and about 4% after birth.22

The lifetime prevalence of BD is about 2–3% in non-
pregnant populations, and diagnostic interviews in pregnancy
and postpartum suggest the same.23 BD has the highest relapse
rate for any mental disorder in the postpartum, in the range of
30–50%; the relapse rate may be as high as 66% among those
who are medication-free during pregnancy.24 Most relapses
are non-psychotic MDEs but as many as 1 in 6 (17%) are epi-
sodes of psychosis, mania or MDEs severe enough to require
hospitalization. Postpartum psychosis occurs after approxi-
mately 1–2 in every 1000 births overall,25 but risk is increased
in those with a pre-existing diagnosis of BD, and those who
have previously experienced postpartum psychosis.26,27

While a comprehensive description of risk factors for each
speciﬁc PMAD is outside the scope of this guideline, Table 4
lists common risk factors and correlates.3,28–38 The strongest
risk factor for any PMAD is a past history of the given disorder,
and untreated or undertreated symptoms prior to or during preg-
nancy.39 Lack of social support and stressful life events are
major risk factors for perinatal depression and anxiety.3
Perinatal depression appears to be more commonly experienced
including adolescents, immigrants,40
by some populations,
those who live in lower and middle-income countries,41,42 are
racialized,43 Indigenous,44,45 have disabilities46,47 and are
gender and sexual minorities.48 Anxiety disorders also appear
to be more common in low and middle-income countries41and
underserved populations.17,41,49 PTSD is more common in
those who have experienced pregnancy complications, stillbirth
and adverse childhood experiences.22 Nulliparity and lower
socioeconomic status are associated with increased risk for
fear of childbirth.50,51

The effective treatment of PMADs is of high priority for the
short- and long-term health of the affected person, their child and
family. Untreated or inadequately treated perinatal depression is
linked to an increased risk of future depressive episodes, sub-
stance use, partner relationship problems and suicide.52–55
Depression in pregnancy is associated with perinatal and
newborn health complications (e.g., gestational hypertension,56
preterm birth,57,58 low birth weight58 and neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) admission in infants59). Depression in both
pregnancy and postpartum are associated with lower rates of
breastfeeding,60 less optimal mother-infant interactions61 and
higher rates of infant and child physical illness,62 hospitaliza-
tions,63 maltreatment64 and cognitive, emotional and behavioural
problems.65,66 The effects of untreated or undertreated anxiety
and related disorders on the health and well-being of childbear-
ing individuals and their offspring are similar in nature and mag-
nitude to those of depression.3,66–68 Fear of childbirth
speciﬁcally is associated with higher rates of labour interven-
tions and complications, such as emergency caesarean

Foundations of Clinical Management

Initial Diagnostic Assessment

Regardless of the manner in which a potential PMAD is iden-
tiﬁed (see Question 1), the ﬁrst step in clinical management is
a comprehensive diagnostic assessment. It is important that
this assessment is conducted in a supportive, non-judgmental
and inclusive environment. Accessible, culturally safe and
trauma-informed care are all essential to a comprehensive
assessment and management plan. Clinicians are encouraged
to educate themselves about how to safely care for diverse
populations, including those who are racialized, a gender or
sexual minority, or who have a disability and others. It is
important for providers to consider the systemic ways in

which some populations have been historically underserved,
mistreated, excluded and/or stigmatized (including in health
care encounters and systems) and how the experiences, out-
comes and needs of certain populations may differ as a result.
The initial diagnostic assessment includes all elements of a
general psychiatric interview, including the patient’s goals
and expectations with the assessment, their sociodemographic
characteristics, current and lifetime mental health and substance
use disorders and their severity (including hospitalizations and
suicidal behaviours), general medical history, current and past
treatment response to psychological, pharmacological and
other interventions (as well as what happened when prior inter-
ventions were discontinued), and developmental and family
history. It is important to evaluate past and current risk factors
for PMADs, family and social support, the roles and responsi-
bilities of the patient with respect to caregiving (including for
other children), and ﬁnancial or work obligations. It is also
important to inquire about health-related factors that can inﬂu-
ence mental health and may be targeted through lifestyle inter-
ventions, such as exercise routine, diet and sleep patterns.
Clinicians will want to assess for potential impact of the
co-parent’s mental health (see Question 10) and/or whether
there are concerns about intimate partner violence. Mental
health issues in relation to previous pregnancies and other
times of hormonal change (premenstrual disorders, mood wors-
ening with the use of hormonal contraceptives, for example) are
associated with elevated risk for subsequent PMADs.36 History
of pregnancy, labour and delivery and/or postpartum complica-
tions, including pregnancy loss, can also inform the diagnostic
and management plan.

Clinical Pearl—Trauma-Informed care
Questions about past trauma are important to explore with
sensitivity.73,74 Traumatic experiences can have long-lasting,
pervasive impact on one’s mental and physical health, but many
individuals do not spontaneously disclose their past traumatic
experiences due to fear, shame, feelings of blame and/or lack of
trust. It is not uncommon for patients who have previously
experienced trauma to present as guarded, sensitive and prone
to emotional dysregulation. In the perinatal period, triggers of
prior traumatic experiences can speciﬁcally include physical
examinations, labour pain, difﬁcult childbirth or other clinical
scenarios where the patient does not experience adequate
control, choice or autonomy. Trauma-informed care—different
than intervention focused on treatment of the sequelae of
trauma itself—refers to when healthcare clinicians and care
systems are able to acknowledge the broad impacts of trauma,
recognize clinical symptoms or other evidence of trauma in the
clinical setting and integrate this knowledge into how care is
delivered including by creating a safe environment, promoting
collaborative treatment relationships and decisions and taking
practical steps to reduce the likelihood that the treatment
environment will mirror common characteristics of past
traumatic experiences.73,74 Given the high prevalence of
trauma, trauma-informed care is important at every stage of
the assessment and treatment process for all persons with
PMADs.

436

It is important to explore how and when a patient’s symp-
toms may have started or changed in pregnancy and/or in the
postpartum, to identify potentially addressable factors that
may have led to the development or worsening of illness.
This may help identify whether there has been an increase
in stressful life events, whether medication discontinuation
may have precipitated relapse or whether there is a need
for medication adjustment due to the physiological changes
of pregnancy and/or the postpartum period. In the postpar-
tum, exploring infant/newborn health can similarly inform
diagnosis and treatment (i.e., preterm, difﬁcult labour/deliv-
ery, medication withdrawal, feeding, sleeping, irritability,
colic and sibling relationships).

The initial diagnostic assessment should also include a
safety risk assessment, including thoughts of self-harm or
harm to the infant/others (see Question 9). When possible
and appropriate to obtain, collateral information from family
members, friends and/or acquaintances can be helpful in clar-
ifying diagnosis and risk. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
and complete blood count (CBC) or ferritin measurement can
assist in ruling out common conditions that occur in pregnancy
and postpartum such as thyroid disease or iron deﬁciency/
anaemia, respectively. Other laboratory tests may be required
on a case-by-case basis (e.g., Vitamin D levels with suspicion
of Vitamin D deﬁciency). Additional testing and/or the use of
electroencephalography (EEG) or neuroimaging are generally
only indicated when there is clinical suspicion of epilepsy/
seizures, traumatic brain injury or other serious medical condi-
tions that can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., anti-N-
methyl-D-aspartate, anti-NMDA,
receptor encephalitis or
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome).

Diagnostic Considerations

Not all mood and anxiety symptoms experienced perinatally
necessarily represent a psychiatric disorder. The “baby
blues,” reported by 40% to 80% of individuals shortly after
childbirth, includes symptoms such as mild mood swings,
sadness, crying more easily, anxiety, and difﬁculties with
sleep and concentration.75 Symptoms associated with the
“baby blues” are neither persistent nor severe and usually
improve signiﬁcantly or disappear within a few weeks
without intervention. Although less well-studied than the
“baby blues,” the concept of “baby pinks” which appears
to include mild symptoms of mood lability, irritability,
feeling euphoric/elated, sleeplessness,
increased energy
and over-talkativeness, has also been reported.76 Like the
“baby blues,” symptoms of the “baby pinks” also appear
to start within the ﬁrst 2 weeks postpartum, are mild, do
not negatively impact daily functioning and improve
without
treatment. Longitudinal studies show that most
cases of “baby blues” and “baby pinks” spontaneously
remit and do not require medical intervention. However,
some studies suggest a higher risk of PPD at 6–8 weeks
postpartum in individuals who experience them.75,76

Therefore, CANMAT recommends monitoring those who
experience “baby blues/pinks” carefully until resolution of
). In cases of pregnancy or child
symptoms (Level 4
health complications, unexpected occurrences during
labour and delivery that are experienced as traumatic, difﬁ-
culty with breastfeeding or other major stressors, a DSM-5-
TR diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be more appropri-
ate than one of a PMAD, if criteria for another mood,
anxiety or related disorder are not met.

In the DSM-5-TR, PMADs do not have their own diagnos-
tic criteria, chapter or category.16 There is a speciﬁer of “peri-
partum onset” for MDD, BD I and BD II that is used when the
onset of these disorders occurs in pregnancy or within the ﬁrst
4 weeks postpartum. In practice, those with onset of mental
illness prior to pregnancy will also require treatment perina-
tally. Further, as mental illness can also arise after the ﬁrst 4
weeks postpartum, both clinicians and researchers usually
consider disorders to be “perinatal” when they present in indi-
viduals up to at least 1 year postpartum.77 Despite their high
prevalence, there are no peripartum onset speciﬁer for anxiety
disorders, OCD or PTSD at this time.

Although there are no speciﬁc DSM-5-TR symptom crite-
ria for perinatal populations, there are some perinatal-speciﬁc
aspects of the clinical presentations. In depression, highly
negative and persistent ruminations about one’s capacity as
a parent and guilt about actions having a negative impact
on the child are common. Anxiety—whether as part of a
depressive, anxiety or related disorder—often focuses on
worries related to the health of babies and the ability to
parent.78 The intrusive nature of excessive worrying perina-
tally in depression and anxiety disorders may sometimes be
difﬁcult to distinguish from that of OCD (“obsessive worry-
ing”), which is characterized by intrusive thoughts and/or
compulsive behaviour. In any of these conditions, intrusive
worries in the perinatal population can present as unwanted,
intrusive thoughts or images of harm coming to the infant,
often accompanied by reassurance seeking, checking behav-
iour and avoidance (e.g., avoiding letting others look after the
baby).19 Fear of childbirth (also referred to as tokophobia) is
an increasingly recognized clinical presentation of anxiety
that encompasses many different fears related to pregnancy
and childbirth, ranging from fear of pain, medical interven-
tions and injury, to fear of loss of control, body change
and staff misconduct,
to fear of maternal and/or infant
death.18,51 CB-PTSD, where PTSD symptoms focus on the
birth and reminders of the birth in the context of a traumatic
birthing experience, is now increasingly being described.79 It
is also increasingly being recognized that childbirth can be
experienced as traumatic and lead to poor mental well-being
even when there were no serious obstetrical or neonatal com-
plications per se.

Although this guideline is speciﬁcally focused on the
management of PMADs, it is critical for clinicians to con-
sider that mood and anxiety symptoms may be associated
with other psychiatric conditions, including personality

La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie

437

disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder), eating disor-
ders (e.g., anorexia, bulimia, binge eating) and/or alcohol
and substance use disorders. In fact, in some cases, these psy-
chiatric disorders other than PMADs may be the primary
source of mood and anxiety symptoms. Whether psychiatric
disorders other than PMADs are primary or comorbid with
PMADs,
they need to be fully assessed and managed.
Finally, in Canada, clinicians have the duty to report to child
protection services or the police (when urgent) in situations
where there are concerns about child abuse and/or neglect.
CANMAT recommends all clinicians to be aware of the
laws of their local authorities.

General Treatment Considerations

It is ideal for mental illness to be stabilized prior to conception.
In preconception planning, it is important to provide patients
with updated information to help them balance the potential
risks of their illness (or illness recurrence) with various treat-
ment options when making decisions about plans for their
treatment before, during and after pregnancy. In pregnancy
and postpartum, the main goals of treatment are to achieve
symptom remission, prevent recurrence or worsening, reduce
or eliminate symptoms of comorbid disorders,
including
medical, psychiatric and substance or alcohol use disorders,
and minimize any risks to the developing infant or child.
Healthcare providers are encouraged to provide support for
the management of psychosocial issues, which may include
connecting patients to social services early in treatment plan-
ning. This may include connecting the patient with resources
to assist with food insecurity, ﬁnancial and/or housing instabil-
ity, language classes for those who do not speak the local lan-
guage, and/or supporting patients experiencing intimate
partner violence. For individuals presenting with more than
one psychiatric disorder, it is important to prioritize which dis-
order(s) need(s) to be addressed ﬁrst. Factors to consider
include the type and severity of disorders, symptom proﬁle
(e.g., presence of psychotic symptoms), impact on maternal
distress and functioning, and safety concerns. Collaboration
between multidisciplinary team members is encouraged in
preparation for labour, delivery and the early postpartum
period, especially in complex cases.

Initial treatment selection depends on the nature and sever-
ity of the illness, previous response to treatment and patient
preference. Severity (mild, moderate or severe) can be assessed
based on the number of symptoms that a patient is presenting
with, the severity of those symptoms and the social and occu-
pational functional impact (Figure 1).16 For depression and
anxiety symptom severity speciﬁcally, scores on brief patient-
oriented outcome measures commonly and feasibly utilized in
clinical practice such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
Scale (EPDS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) may be used
to aid in the severity assessment.80 The cut-off scores on
these measures for the various severity levels in Figure 1 are

meant only to be used to guide the severity assessment, and
should be considered in the context of other aspects of the clin-
ical picture (e.g., history, duration of symptoms, other comor-
bidities) to aid in decision-making about treatment.

As shown in Figure 1, depression, anxiety and related
disorders of mild or moderate severity can often be success-
fully managed with non-pharmacological options alone,
including with lifestyle, psychosocial, psychological and com-
plementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions.
Medications and other somatic treatments may then be used
in addition when symptoms do not
respond to non-
pharmacological treatment alone. As also shown in Figure 1,
medications are typically needed to successfully manage
depression, anxiety and related disorders when symptoms
are of moderate-severity or severe, and in the treatment of
BD. They are also used to prevent relapse or recurrence of
symptoms when an individual was taking medication for
maintenance treatment prior to pregnancy. In these cases, non-
pharmacological interventions may also be implemented to
complement
(e.g., peer
support programs or psychological therapy may still be bene-
ﬁcial alongside a medication treatment). Other somatic
treatments, such as non-invasive neuromodulation or electro-
convulsive therapy (ECT) may be needed when medication
options have not led to adequate remission, or for ECT
when there is very severe illness and a rapid response to treat-
ment is required (e.g., acute psychosis or catatonia).

the pharmacological

treatment

When discussing treatment options, healthcare providers
should provide ample time for discussion, including possible
risks, side effects and expected beneﬁts. Patient preference
should also be taken into account. Health professionals
should also encourage patients to discuss the treatment
options with their partners/close support and/or to bring
their partners/close support to an appointment so that treat-
ment options can be discussed jointly, as appropriate.

Once treatment

is initiated, CANMAT recommends
regular monitoring. The routine use of standardized tools
measuring the severity of symptoms such as the EPDS,
PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 is highly encouraged to systematically
monitor response to treatment and potential symptom worsen-
ing or relapse. Monitoring should occur more frequently while
the patient remains symptomatic (e.g., every 1–3 weeks) and
the frequency can be reduced once the symptoms have fully
remitted (e.g., every 6–8 weeks) (Level 4

).

Question 1. What Are the Recommendations
for Identiﬁcation of PMADs?
The ﬁrst step in the pathway to effective diagnosis and treat-
ment is case identiﬁcation. Some women and pregnant or
birthing people of other genders may recognize and report
symptoms themselves, while others will not. Friends or
family may identify symptoms and express concerns.
Clinicians may also ﬁnd themselves uncertain about the
level of symptomatology that suggests a diagnosable disorder

type is typically needed, but interventions in higher rows may also be implemented to complement the effect of the main intervention.

Health).

to be present. As such, while case identiﬁcation can be made
through sensitive clinical inquiry about mental health, the use
of standardized clinical questionnaires to help identify cases
has been investigated.81

The EPDS is a well-validated tool for the detection of
perinatal depression that has been translated into 60 lan-
guages.82,83 While multiple cut-off scores have been sug-
gested in the literature, evidence from a large systematic
review suggests that a cut-off score of 11 or higher on the
EPDS maximizes the ability to accurately identify depression,
when compared to semi-structured diagnostic interviews in
).84,85
pregnant and postpartum populations (Level 3
While we recommend the EPDS preferentially, the PHQ-9,
one of the most widely used depression self-report tools in
primary care,86 has comparable test characteristics at a score
of ≥10, so can be used if more practical
to implement

).87 The PHQ-2 and Whooley Questionnaire
(Level 3
have more moderate speciﬁcity (Level 3
),88 but may be
useful when the longer questionnaires are not
feasible
despite the trade-off of generating more false-positive cases.
Data are still emerging on the validity of standardized
tools to identify cases of anxiety and related disorders in peri-
natal populations.89–93 For generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD), the GAD-7 scale (widely used in GAD screening
non-perinatally), there is one study in pregnancy that sug-
gests that a cut-off score of 7 may have better sensitivity
and internal consistency than the score of 10 that is usually
used for clinically meaningful symptomatology outside of
the perinatal period.94 There is limited data about optimal
scales and cut-off scores for the detection of other anxiety
disorders, OCD, or PTSD in the perinatal period, although
studies in this area are also emerging.95,96 Given the

La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie

439

importance of case identiﬁcation, if there is clinical suspi-
cion, scales validated outside of the perinatal period—or
those with some validation within the perinatal period—
can be used with caution (Level 4

).92

When a patient presents with symptoms of depression,
anxiety or related disorders, it is also important to determine
whether there is a current or past history of mania or hypoma-
nia because that may signiﬁcantly alter the proposed treat-
ment plan. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), a
widely used instrument in non-perinatal populations, has evi-
dence in the identiﬁcation of BD in perinatal populations
when a cut-off score of 7 or above is used and the supplemen-
).97–100 The MDQ is
tary questions are excluded (Level 3
excellent in ruling out the diagnosis of BD (>90% negative
predictive value). However, positive cases need to be fol-
lowed by a diagnostic assessment since only 50% of those
scoring positive in the MDQ have a diagnosis of BD. The
Highs, although less studied than the MDQ in non-perinatal
populations, is the only instrument developed speciﬁcally for
the detection of acute hypomania and mania symptoms in the
postpartum period. The Highs is a 7-item questionnaire,
where a score of 8 or higher can be used to detect BD, partic-
ularly when used at 1 and 6 weeks postpartum.101 The MDQ
would be best utilized for assessment of past and acute symp-
toms whereas the Highs is best utilized to measure the sever-
ity of acute symptoms.

When using a standardized questionnaire for case identiﬁ-
cation, typically a cut-off score above a certain number repre-
sents a high likelihood of diagnosis. However, diagnoses
cannot be made through questionnaires alone. When there is
a concern for PMADs due to clinical suspicion and/or score
on a questionnaire, the patient should receive further diagnos-
tic assessment and treatment. It is also possible for an individ-
ual with a score below the threshold to still require care. As
such, it is critical that when standardized clinical scales are
used for case detection, that there is also a mechanism or
pathway for proper diagnostic assessment and treatment.

One area of discussion has been whether standardized
clinical questionnaires to identify PMADs should be used
routinely with all perinatal patients. For perinatal depression,
there is evidence that the use of a standardized questionnaire
for case identiﬁcation can improve identiﬁcation rates, treat-
).102,103 Given
ment rates and clinical outcomes (Level 2

Preventive Services Task Force has positioned themselves
in favour of this strategy, as have organizations from other
countries.102,104 In contrast, the Canadian Task Force on
Preventive Health Care recommended against the routine
use of standardized questionnaires with concern that the evi-
dence in favour of the strategy was not strong enough to out-
weigh the potential economic costs and stress to patients of

depression,

identifying

in

false-positive cases.105 Although there is high acceptability
of the use of standardized questionnaires for case identiﬁca-
tion in perinatal populations,93,106 there was concern that use
of a cut-off score on a standardized questionnaire on its own
could lead to misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis,
increased
mental health stigma and unnecessary treatment.107

CANMAT believes that it is essential to ensure that cases of
depression are identiﬁed as quickly and early as possible to
promote timely and effective treatment, such that the evidence
to date –which includes the good validity and acceptability of
questionnaires in case identiﬁcation and the Level 2 evidence
for improvement of clinical outcomes—is sufﬁcient to support
the use of validated questionnaires to help in case identiﬁca-
tion. While standardized questionnaires may be helpful in
identifying cases of PMADs other than depression as indicated
previously, there is not yet evidence for how applying such
tools routinely would impact on clinical outcomes. Further
research on the feasibility and effectiveness of systematic or
routine use of questionnaires to detect other PMADs is needed.
While there is no empirical evidence on the optimal timing
for case identiﬁcation and the feasibility of integrating ques-
tionnaires into routine care may be challenging in some set-
tings, CANMAT recommends that clinicians providing
antenatal, postnatal and/or pediatric care implement case iden-
tiﬁcation of PMADs into their clinical practice throughout the
perinatal period (e.g., once per trimester pregnancy, at postpar-
tum obstetrical follow-up, in family practice and pediatric care
up to 12 months postpartum) (Level 4

).102,108,109

Considerations in Diverse Populations

While some well-validated tools have been translated into
many languages, some populations may not recognize or
experience mental health symptoms in a manner that is accu-
rately captured by case identiﬁcation tools standardized in a
different population.110,111 Further, it has been found that
local language versions of tools like the EPDS may been
less likely to identify true cases of PMADs compared to
the original English version.112 It may be beneﬁcial to use tai-
lored cut-off scores on questionnaires in speciﬁc populations,
as evidenced in a recent scoping review showing that lower
cut-off scores may be more appropriate in South and/or
East Asian populations.113 There is limited evidence for
optimal scales and cut-off scores in adoptive parents,82 and
for those who are Indigenous or racialized.113–115

Some racial and ethnic minority and migrant populations
may be less likely to disclose mental health concerns due to
the stigma surrounding mental illness and expectations of
motherhood within their family or culture.110,116–119 There
may also be a reluctance to disclose mental health challenges
perinatally among those with disabilities due to fears of mis-
treatment or child apprehension.120 For people with intellec-
tual and developmental disabilities, tools like the EPDS may
not be as useful given this population’s challenges interpret-
ing and recalling symptoms.121 There is also evidence that

440

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 70(6)

populations who are marginalized by racism and socioeco-
nomic disadvantage are less likely to be assessed for
PMADs.108 Further efforts to create culturally appropriate
and accessible case identiﬁcation tools and to examine and
address inequities in assessment are needed.

Question 2. What Is Recommended for the
Organization and Delivery of Healthcare
Services?

Barriers to Care
Initial identiﬁcation of PMADs may occur in antenatal or post-
partum care, including in midwifery, public health nursing,
primary care (e.g., family physicians, nurse practitioners), pedi-
atrics or obstetrical settings. Ideally, healthcare services will be
organized such that once PMADs are identiﬁed, there are clear
pathways to assessment and treatment. Therefore, it is impor-
tant to consider barriers to care and how to address them at
the individual, healthcare provider and health system level, to
improve treatment access and outcomes.

Multiple barriers to care for PMADs have been described.122
Key barriers include stigma, feelings of shame, guilt, embar-
rassment and lack of self-efﬁcacy (i.e., a lack of conﬁdence
that there is anything that is under a person’s control that
could help them to feel better). Sometimes patients and clini-
cians may lack knowledge about the symptoms of PMADs
and that there are effective treatment options, or have speciﬁc
perceptions about treatment that lead them not to want to
seek care (e.g., concern that a medication may be the only
option recommended when they prefer psychotherapy). Many
patients have reported feeling too overwhelmed to seek care
and some report fears of disclosing their mental health symp-
toms due to concerns about losing parental rights to their chil-
interventions are effective only if they are
dren. Further,
accessible. While some can be implemented within one’s
home, or with little to no cost, many interventions require
funding, qualiﬁed personnel and other resources (e.g., transpor-
tation, childcare). Practical barriers to care include inadequate
health insurance or ﬁnancial issues, lack of childcare, time,
transportation and/or internet connections for virtual services,
as well as problems with care availability (i.e., there is variable
access to specialized services in most jurisdictions with fewer
treatment options especially in rural and remote regions).

Some populations, including those who are adolescents, dis-
abled, gender-diverse, immigrants and refugees, Indigenous,
racialized and sexual minorities, disproportionally experience
barriers to care.48,123–126 Speciﬁcally, socioeconomic disad-
vantage and the structural impacts of colonization, racism,
homo/bi/transphobia, ableism, and migration and country,
community integration or settling experiences, impact access
to care, provider-patient interactions, and in turn can nega-
tively impact perinatal mental health outcomes.127 These
structural factors and their legacies, including (intergenera-
tional) trauma, must be considered and integrated into the

training of care providers to ensure that all childbearing
people receive safe, accessible and equitable perinatal mental
health care.128

There is evidence that some racial and ethnic minority
populations have lower rates of treatment
initiation and
engagement and higher dropout rates of psychological inter-
ventions despite very strong preferences for psychological
over pharmacological interventions.116,129 Some barriers to
care discussed above may partly explain race- and other
identity-based differences in treatment preference modality,
initiation and adherence. Culturally sensitive care and cul-
tural adaptations of psychosocial and psychological interven-
tions can reduce inequities in treatment adherence, as well as
improve clinical outcomes among racial and ethnic minority
groups.117,130 Clinicians are advised to provide all the infor-
mation necessary for patients to make an informed decision,
preferably in ways that are most accessible or applicable to
that person (e.g., recommendations around web-based or
social media resources, providing visual and printed materi-
als, in various languages, etc., as opposed to use of medical
or technical language). Clinicians are also advised to con-
sider patients’ speciﬁc life circumstances, notably barriers
to and/or availability of ﬁnancial, social and other resources
to support speciﬁc intervention initiation and adherence.

Models of Care. Strategies that have been suggested to
decrease barriers and facilitate the implementation of perina-
tal mental health policy and practice are summarized into:119
(a) Design of care: Patients should have a choice in the care
they receive; easy access; care should be delivered clearly,
openly and honestly; ﬂexible times of the appointments;
practical supports such as assistance with childcare, transport
and links with social work; access to interpreters if needed;
and options for both in-person and virtual care;
(b)
Characteristics of healthcare providers: Healthcare providers
should be open, non-judgmental, willing to listen, motivated,
sensitive to verbal cues, interested and well-trained in perina-
tal mental health issues, dedicated to act as patients’ advo-
cates, culturally sensitive, knowledgeable and conﬁdent,
good communication skills and feel positively about the
care they provide; (c) Organizational factors: There should
be clear workﬂow procedures; collaborative working; per-
sonnel dedicated to perinatal mental health; and supervision;
(d) Political factors: There should be free care or easy access
through insurance policies (in Canada, many psychological
services are not covered by universal healthcare insurance;
in other settings there can be variability in access to many dif-
ferent types of services based on insurance status); services
adequately funded with proper services and staff; clear and
easy pathways of referral; and (e) Societal factors: There
should be patient, family and public education to improve
health literacy and support, and decrease stigma.

Unfortunately, most healthcare jurisdictions have not imple-
mented systematic management pathways for PMADs. Instead,
health care providers such as family physicians, midwives,

nurses, obstetricians and pediatricians who identify possible
cases of PMADs often rely on ad hoc referrals to local thera-
pists or general mental health services, with referrals to more
specialized perinatal mental health services only in regions
where these are available. Similar to issues with mental health-
care in non-perinatal populations, it is thought that the lack of a
systematic approach to perinatal mental health care delivery
contributes to low treatment rates. Because of this, various
models of care have been developed and evaluated in an
effort to better organize and deliver care (Table 5).

triage and referral,

Collaborative care, also known as integrated care, is a
mental healthcare model that uses interdisciplinary contribu-
tions by 2 or more health professionals to systematize case
identiﬁcation, assessment,
initiation of
treatment appropriate to the level of patient symptoms and
risk, and ongoing/continuous follow-up symptom monitoring
and management for entire patient populations.131 These
models are typically based in primary or obstetrical care set-
tings, with a mental-health trained behavioural health coordi-
nator (e.g., RN) to assess,
triage and monitor care and
psychiatrists to advise primary care clinicians (i.e., family phy-
sicians and nurse practitioners) or obstetricians and oversee
treatment programs. In this model, patients with mild and
even moderate severity of symptoms can have their concerns
initially addressed via front-line providers. For example,
patients can be directly supported with social services, connec-
tions to peer support and other interventions in the primary
care or obstetrical setting. Then, psychiatric support can be
available when these initial interventions are insufﬁcient or
in more severe cases. Integrating mental healthcare into
general healthcare settings (e.g., primary care and obstetrical
or midwifery care) achieves greater access to treatment and
continuity of care, which can provide beneﬁts for patient
mental health and obstetric outcomes.132 Collaborative care
models are associated with high treatment satisfaction, and
have been shown to be effective for the treatment of depressive
and anxiety disorders in perinatal settings in some although not
).133–135 There is emerging evidence for
all trials (Level 2
perinatal psychiatric access programs, an approach that incor-
porates elements of collaborative care, but with less resource
intensity, where health care providers can reach out to a spe-
cialized centre for resource and referrals, telephone provider
consultation and direct patient consultation with expert perina-
tal psychiatrists.136

Stepped care models involve providing patients with
treatments of increasing intensity depending on the severity

of illness.137 Patients are typically advised to begin with the
least intensive treatment shown to be effective for their
symptom severity and then to ‘step up’ into more intensive
interventions depending on their treatment response. These
models are currently in use to deliver perinatal mental
healthcare in certain national health systems (e.g., in the
UK), but have not been extensively studied for PMADs
).138 In staged care models, patients are

questionnaires,
severity.139 Staged care models have not been rigorously
tested in perinatal populations. Some studies describe
program development and there are non-randomized studies
focusing on PPD and comorbid anxiety that show some
promise for this type of intervention (Level 4

).140–143

Stepped and staged care models differ from collaborative
care models in that they do not necessarily encompass the
population-based assessment and monitoring components.
However, in health care systems where more comprehensive
integrated care models have yet to be implemented, these
approaches may be helpful. For example, in some Canadian
jurisdictions, clinical care pathways have been developed to
support antenatal, postnatal and pediatric care providers in
assessing the severity of a patient’s PMAD symptoms and
directing the patient to a speciﬁc step in the pathway based
on this (e.g., peer support for mild symptoms, psychological
therapy for symptoms of moderate-severity or medication
for more severe symptoms).80,144

Studies of mental health care models for perinatal mental
health have largely focused on interventions for depressive
and anxiety disorders. Further research is needed beyond peri-
natal depression and anxiety, including in BD, PTSD, OCD
and other perinatal mental disorders.145,146 Further research is
also needed to determine the effectiveness of mental health
care models in under-served populations, such as disabled,
sexual minority, Black and Indigenous populations.147,148

Treatment Providers and Settings. Psychosocial interventions
may be delivered in the community by peers, nurses and
other community healthcare providers. Psychological inter-
ventions are usually delivered by trained mental health care
professionals. However, task-sharing—the “rational distribu-
tion of tasks to less specialized personnel”149—can be lever-
aged to improve access to screening, self-care options and
frontline psychological treatments.150,151 For example, brief
psychological treatments to prevent and treat PMADs can be
delivered by non (mental health) specialist providers.152–154
Medications are usually prescribed by primary care clinicians
(i.e., family physicians, nurse practitioners) and sometimes
obstetricians. Psychiatrist input and follow-up is most impor-
tant in complex or more severe cases, such as when there
are comorbid conditions, inadequate response to initial treat-
ments and in high-risk situations. Virtual delivery of care
such as by telephone or video-conferencing can improve
access to care by eliminating barriers to care, such as arranging

childcare, transportation and geographical barriers, among
others, with comparable effectiveness to in-person care for
perinatal depression and anxiety (Level 2

).155–165

For individuals with more severe illness, intensive psychi-
atric day programs (also called “day hospitals”) have been
developed, although these have only been evaluated in non-
).166,167 For severe postpar-
randomized studies (Level 4
tum mental illness, mother–baby units (MBUs, not currently
available in Canada) have been proposed as a means of provid-
ing specialized mental health treatment options for postpartum
people with severe forms of mental illness without mother–
infant separations. MBUs are meant to support the mother–
infant relationship, while stabilizing maternal mental health.
Evidence from non-randomized, uncontrolled studies shows
positive effects on maternal mental health, mother–infant rela-
).168,169 As there
tionships and child development (Level 4
would be signiﬁcant practical challenges to conducting ran-
domized trials to provide additional evidence comparing
MBUs to the standard of care, it may be important for jurisdic-
tions currently without MBUs to consider that they may be
particularly helpful in certain situations, especially for patients
who may require prolonged hospitalizations (and thus long
separations from their infants).

The range of different providers and settings in which peri-
natal mental health care can be accessed in Canada and other
countries can result in a treatment landscape that is difﬁcult
to navigate.170 Patient navigation aims to facilitate timely
access to mental healthcare by helping patients understand
what services may be helpful for them, and connect them to
the right service option (e.g., by identifying service options,
coordinating with services to assist with referrals, and
helping to remove access barriers).171 It has shown some
promise in terms of clinical outcomes (e.g., reduced symptoms
of depression and anxiety), patient satisfaction and service use
).171 Patient navigation’s effectiveness on its own
(Level 4
without the actual connection to services that would occur in a
collaborative, stepped or staged care model is not known.

Question 3. What Are the Recommendations
for Lifestyle Interventions?

CANMAT considers lifestyle interventions as those that serve
to intervene on health-related behaviours, including as this
relates to diet, exercise and/or sleep. Prior CANMAT guide-
lines have also included light therapy in this category of inter-
ventions. A summary of
the
prevention and treatment of PMADs is in Table 6.

related to perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms would
generalize to those who meet diagnostic criteria for depressive,
anxiety, anxiety-related or BDs is unknown. Regardless, exer-
cise recommendations should be tailored to individual circum-
stances (e.g., ﬁnances, childcare support, physical limitations,
other barriers), preferences, values and possible health risks
(e.g., eating disorders, injuries) and adapted for the context of
a person’s pregnancy and post-delivery recovery circumstances.
Sleep disruption is common in pregnancy (e.g., due to
general discomfort, need for
frequent urination and/or
medical conditions such as sleep apnea) and when caring
for an infant, and is linked to increased risk for and worsen-
ing symptoms of PMADs.181–184 Neither universal sleep edu-
cation interventions nor behavioural sleep interventions for

“fading,” or bedtime routines) appear to effectively prevent

help with child sleep and maternal sleep quality. Also,

recommended in the prevention and treatment of PMAD

aSleep protection interventions may range from minimizing the time a mother has to be awake at night (e.g., bottle-feeding by another adult with pumped
breastmilk or formula) to evidence-based interventions to treat insomnia when it is present. CBT for insomnia, CBT-I, is a highly effective treatment for
insomnia where there is speciﬁcally effectiveness demonstrated for improving sleep quality, insomnia severity, depression and anxiety symptoms in pregnancy
(Level 1

), and open-label evidence for its use for insomnia in postpartum depression speciﬁcally (Level 4

).

Question 4. What Are the Recommendations
for the Use of Psychosocial Interventions?
An individual’s perception of insufﬁcient support is a strong risk
factor for PMADs.193–195 Thus, CANMAT recommends opti-
mizing informal supports such as those provided through com-
munity or embedded social networks of family members and
). Psychosocial interventions are designed
friends (Level 4
speciﬁcally to enhance perceptions of support by providing
informational (i.e., psychoeducational), emotional and instru-
mental support.196,197 Psychosocial
interventions that have
been evaluated perinatally include home-visiting support, peer
support and psychoeducational programs (summarized in
Table 7). Most research is focused on perinatal depression and
anxiety. Given the paucity of empirical evidence in BD, PTSD
and OCD, clinicians may need to consider evidence from non-
perinatal populations in the management of these disorders.

There is strong evidence for peer support (i.e., support
by trained peers)
in reducing depressive symptoms in
affected individuals during pregnancy and postpartum

).194,198 Peer support is effective whether delivered
(Level 1
face-to-face, by telephone or online (virtually), in individual or
group sessions. Efﬁcacy has also been demonstrated in speciﬁc
perinatal sub-populations, such as adolescents and parents of
preterm infants.198,199 The optimal frequency for peer support
appears to be at least once per week, with a length of less
than 3 months being as effective as a length of 3–36 months.
Peer support can also prevent PPD in at-risk populations such
as those with risk factors for PPD or those with depressive
symptoms that are subsyndromal (i.e., not severe enough to
meet criteria for an MDE but have the potential to progress to
).200Peer support may
an MDE if not addressed) (Level 2
further be effective for perinatal anxiety symptoms, though
).201–203 While
additional research is warranted (Level 3
there are no perinatal studies of trained peer support in BD,
there is Level 2 evidence outside the perinatal period for adjunc-
tive peer support (i.e., in addition to medication) in the preven-
tion of symptom recurrence. Therefore, while empirical data in
the perinatal population is awaited, adjunctive peer support

Educating patients and families about pregnancy, parenting,
PMAD risks, symptoms and treatments is important and part of
best practices in healthcare. However, there is an overall lack of
support for speciﬁc psychoeducational programs, including
group-based prenatal care, that have been evaluated for the pre-
vention and treatment of perinatal depression, anxiety and

shown to reduce depressive symptoms in the postpartum

period (Level 2
programs are implemented, these should be based on speciﬁc
intervention models that have been evaluated and shown to
be effective.

Question 5. What Are the Recommendations
for the Use of Psychological Interventions?
Psychological treatment is recommended as a ﬁrst-line option
for treating moderate-severity presentations of depression,
anxiety, OCD and PTSD or in mild-severity illness when life-
style and psychosocial interventions alone are not fully effec-
tive, or are not accessible. Severe forms of these illnesses will
not generally respond adequately to psychological treatments
alone, and pharmacotherapy or other somatic interventions
(e.g., neuromodulation) may be required to attain remission.
While medications are foundational for the successful treatment
of BD, adjunctive psychological interventions (i.e., in addition
to medication) can be helpful in the treatment of depressive epi-
sodes, in relapse prevention and to improve quality of life.

Depression and Anxiety

Both CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are effec-
tive in the prevention of perinatal depression in those with
a prior history of depression, subsyndromal depressive symp-
toms or those with psychosocial risk factors for perinatal
depression such as low socioeconomic status, single parent-
hood and young maternal age (Level 1

).200,205

Psychological

MDEs in pregnancy and postpartum, with and without comor-

such as CBT,200,205,216,217,220–222
manualized therapies,
IPT,200,205,217,218 mindfulness-based therapies (e.g., mindful-

tive when speciﬁcally targeting perinatal anxiety symptoms
).216,219,221,222 This includes emerging evidence
(Level 2
for several forms of psychological treatment, primarily those
containing elements of CBT, in the speciﬁc treatment of fear
of childbirth symptoms (Level 2

).218

Psychological treatments for depression and anxiety are
typically delivered weekly, frequently ranging from 4–16
sessions, although there is also evidence for 1-day CBT
workshops in the reduction of postpartum depressive and

Psychological interventions can also be delivered through
self-help, where the patient works through a program of
therapy on their own—usually using cognitive behaviour
therapy techniques—via print workbooks or online web-
based modules or mobile applications. These self-help inter-
ventions are considered guided when they occur along with
online or telephone support from a trained coach to encour-
age completion, review progress and outcomes. Self-help
psychological interventions (workbook and internet-based)
reduce depressive symptoms, with beneﬁts mostly observed

is thought to be at least partially because the completion rates

(Level 4
based) interventions can also prevent prenatal depression
and anxiety in at-risk populations such as those with risk
factors for PMADs and/or subsyndromal levels of symptoms
(Level 3

for PPD, and Level 2

).238–243

OCD

Less is known about psychological treatments for PMADs
other than depression and anxiety. CBT with exposure and

response prevention is recommended for OCD given its
well established efﬁcacy in non-perinatal OCD,244 despite
the fact that the volume of evidence for CBT in perinatal
OCD is not extensive (Level 3

).245

PTSD

There has been interest in the secondary prevention of PTSD
after a traumatic childbirth. Psychological debrieﬁng inter-
the event where the postpartum
ventions shortly after
person is encouraged to process their emotional response to
the traumatic event are not effective in the prevention of
PTSD or the treatment of emergent symptoms (Level 1
negative).246 This is consistent with the evidence in non-
perinatal populations.247 However, the lack of evidence for
debrieﬁng should not deter clinicians from providing clariﬁ-
cation to patients around the events of a birth and answering
questions that patients may have. In RCTs of mothers of
preterm infants with elevated PTSD symptoms,
there is
some positive evidence for
interventions with trauma-
focused CBT components for the secondary prevention of
).246 RCTs of other interventions to
PTSD (Level 2
prevent PTSD after traumatic childbirth that were included
in systematic reviews are very heterogeneous and generally
of low quality, precluding the ability to make a speciﬁc rec-
ommendation about them.246

There are multiple psychological treatments that are effec-
tive for PTSD non-perinatally (e.g., cognitive processing
therapy, prolonged exposure therapy and written exposure
therapy).248,249 However, there is limited evidence about
which treatments would be most effective for a primary
target of perinatal PTSD or posttraumatic stress symptoms,
particularly for symptoms of PTSD related to events that
occurred in childbirth.146,211,250 A recent pilot study using
written exposure therapy for PTSD symptoms in pregnant
individuals with PTSD and substance use disorders reported
promising results (Level 4

).251

Bipolar Disorder

Although psychological interventions for BD non-perina-
tally have not been shown to control symptoms on their
own (i.e., in the absence of medication treatments) and
have rarely been studied in the perinatal population,
limited data on CBT, family-focused therapy and interper-
sonal and social rhythms therapy for BD in non-perinatal
patients suggests some depressive symptom reduction,
functional improvement and prevention of symptom recur-
rence when added as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy (Level
). These could be considered as adjunctive interven-
2
tions in pregnant and postpartum populations where feasible
(Level 4

).7

A summary of psychological interventions for the preven-
tion and treatment of PMADs are in Tables 8 and 9,

Question 6. What Are the
Recommendations for the Use of
Pharmacological Interventions?

PTSD when

disorders, OCD and

Medications are most often used in depressive disorders,
non-
anxiety
pharmacological therapies are ineffective, and as ﬁrst-line
treatment when the initial symptoms are moderate-to-severe
or severe. They may also be used as initial treatments in
patients with milder symptoms who are unable to access psy-
chological interventions, or who prefer medication over psy-
chotherapy. Medication is the mainstay of treatment in BD
and postpartum psychosis, regardless of symptom severity.
While most medications used for PMADs are not perinatal-
speciﬁc, brexanolone which is delivered via intravenous
infusion, and its oral counterpart zuranolone, are novel med-
ications that have recently been approved speciﬁcally for the
treatment of PPD in the U.S. Brexanolone and zuranolone are
neurosteroid derivatives of the progesterone metabolite allo-
pregnanolone, and modulate Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid A
(GABA-A) receptors, which are known to be involved in
the pathophysiology of depression.252,253

Decisions about medication use during pregnancy and lac-
tation will always involve balancing the beneﬁts to the
patient and foetus or developing infant (especially given the
negative impacts of untreated or undertreated illness) against
the potential risks of medication exposure in pregnancy or lac-
tation (safety and tolerability). Some individuals will be taking
medication prior to the pregnancy, so decisions centre around
risk for relapse. Others will be faced with decisions about
whether to initiate a medication when new symptoms arise.
It is critical that clinicians have up-to-date knowledge about
beneﬁts and risks so that they can provide patients and signiﬁ-
cant others with clear, balanced and unbiased information.
Decision-making can be optimized by: (a) advising patients
about all of their treatment options (including not being
treated), (b) helping them clarify their values and preferences
about these options and (c) ensuring ample time for decision-
making.254,255 Best practice supports describing estimates of
efﬁcacy and safety in absolute terms when such estimates are
possible to provide (e.g., 1 in 1000), and acknowledging
when there is uncertainty.256

Medication Safety in Pregnancy and Lactation

With some exceptions, most commonly used psychotropic med-
ications are considered fairly low risk in terms of their impact on
pregnancy outcomes, including for congenital malformations
(ﬁrst trimester exposure), and for fetal growth, pregnancy com-
plications, neonatal health and latent child developmental effects
(e.g., motor, language and socioemotional development). When
evaluating medication safety in pregnancy, it is sometimes difﬁ-
cult to separate the potential impacts of a medication from those
of other medications or exposures (including for example pre-
pregnancy exposures such as fertility treatments), the underlying

illness and other factors associated with the indication for the
medication (e.g., genetic risk, smoking, high body mass index
and others). Because RCTs of psychotropic medications have
not been conducted in pregnant people, the best available evi-
dence is usually from large observational (e.g., case-control,
cohort) studies. Unlike RCTs, observational designs can be
subject to bias (e.g., confounded by the illness itself or other
associated factors). Multiple methods have been used to
attempt to control for confounding variables (e.g., comparing
siblings born to the same parents where only one sibling was
exposed to medication in-utero, comparisons to unmedicated
pregnant people with the same underlying illness, etc.), so this
guideline uses data from these higher-quality observational
studies to inform recommendations. As observational studies
cannot fully control for confounders, some degree of uncertainty
about risk of medications prescribed in pregnancy will always
remain.

Similarly, most psychotropic medications appear to be
low-risk in lactation. In lactation, available safety evidence
derives mostly from case-series and small observational
studies, and there is often less information on safety available
than in pregnancy. However, the majority of psychotropic med-
ications have a relative infant dose (RID, the dose received via
breastmilk relative to the mother’s dose) of less than 10%,
which is generally considered to be of minimal risk.257 A
drug with an RID > 10% may still be appropriate to prescribe
if it does not appear to confer risks. Caution should be exercised
with preterm infants and those with renal, hepatic, neurological
or other signiﬁcant health conditions, particularly with agents
with a long half-life or active metabolites.258 There is no con-
vincing evidence that attempts to alter feed time or dump breast-
milk to reduce infant exposure will reduce risks to the infant.

Therapeutic Drug Monitoring

The dosing and monitoring protocols for most psychotropic
medications are generally similar to those of the non-perinatal
period. There are pregnancy-related physiological changes that
can impact the metabolism of some psychotropic medications,
reducing their blood levels.259 In most cases, clinicians should
monitor patients for possible symptom worsening and adjust
medication dosage as clinically appropriate should worsening
of symptoms occur. However, lamotrigine and lithium elimi-
nation both increase in pregnancy with reduction to pre-
pregnancy levels fairly quickly postpartum. As such, perinatal-
speciﬁc monitoring protocols are advised (see Antiepileptics
and Lithium below).

Antidepressants. Antidepressants are ﬁrst-line medications in
depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, OCD and PTSD and
are sometimes used in bipolar depression as an add-on medica-
tion. Most studies evaluating safety in pregnancy have focused
on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepres-
sants (TCAs) and other antidepressants as a whole or as a class

448

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 70(6)

(e.g., SSRIs), with fewer focusing on speciﬁc medications within
classes. This means that, with some exceptions, it is difﬁcult to
distinguish between safety within medication classes. Data (sum-
marized in Box 1) show that links between most antidepressants
and most adverse pregnancy outcomes are reduced signﬁcantly
when confounding by indication is well-managed.260,261
Some experts advise tapering antidepressants near delivery to
reduce the risk of poor neonatal adaptation syndrome (PNAS).
While this approach is supported by evidence from a recent non-
randomized case series, earlier evidence suggested that there was
no difference in risk for neonatal respiratory distress between
pregnancies where the antidepressant was and was not
discontinued 14 days prior to delivery after accounting for mater-
nal illness severity.262,263 While CANMAT acknowledges this is
a developing area, the beneﬁts of tapering to reduce the risk of
PNAS likely do not outweigh the risk of worsening maternal
illness severity; hence reducing or discontinuing antidepressants
near delivery is not recommended (Level 4

).

Box 1. Summary of evidence on the safety of
antidepressant use in pregnancy

Level 3 evidence

unless otherwise speciﬁed
Pregnancy complications: The risk of spontaneous abortion
(SA) is not thought to be increased with SSRIs after accounting for
maternal depression and other confounders, though there is less
certainty about risk with venlafaxine, duloxetine and
mirtazapine.261,264,265 Risks for gestational diabetes mellitus and
gestational hypertension do not appear to be meaningfully
increased in those taking SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, or monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) during pregnancy.261,265,266 For
postpartum haemorrhage (a concern that has been investigated due
to an increased risk for bleeding with serotonergic antidepressants
in non-pregnant populations), ﬁndings are mixed but the
studies that have adjusted for psychiatric disorder suggest that the
increase in blood loss with SSRIs and SNRIs is of small
magnitude (i.e., ∼300 mL of excess blood loss) with no evidence of
severe complications or mortality to the pregnant person or
infant.265,267

Congenital malformations: SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs as
classes do not appear to increase risk for major congenital
malformations.261,268 There may be an increased risk for
cardiovascular malformations speciﬁcally during
ﬁrst-trimester exposure with SSRIs, SNRIs and bupropion,
however this risk is thought to be very small in absolute terms
(if not nil after accounting for confounders); some studies
have suggested slightly greater cause for concern with
paroxetine than for others in these classes.269–272 TCAs do
not appear to be associated with meaningfully increased
risk.269 For the MAOI tranylcypromine there are only
case-series data, but severe facial dysmorphisms, cardiac
malformations and fetal death have been reported
(Level 4

).273

Fetal growth: While the risk of growth restriction

and shortened gestational age may be increased with
antidepressants generally, the magnitude of these reductions
is not likely to be clinically signiﬁcant (i.e., <100 grams and
<1 week gestational age in most cases).265,274–276

Neonatal complications: Persistent pulmonary hypertension
of the newborn is a rare but serious condition affecting 2/1000
infants. In foetuses exposed to SSRIs and SNRIs in the third
trimester, the absolute risk may be increased to ∼3/1000
overall. For SSRIs, the elevation in risk may be lower for
sertraline and escitalopram than for ﬂuoxetine, but this is not
deﬁnitive.277 Up to 30% of newborns exposed to SSRIs and
SNRIs in pregnancy will display transient symptoms of PNAS, a
constellation of symptoms that include jitteriness, respiratory
distress, irritability, sleep disturbance, tachycardia and feeding
problems.278 PNAS is self-limited in most cases, is rarely
associated with severe complications, and usually resolves within
2–3 days with supportive care. This risk is increased with all
SSRIs/SNRIs, but may be highest with paroxetine, venlafaxine
and ﬂuoxetine.261

Longer-term child health: There are no consistent
associations between fetal exposure to SSRIs and later
physical health (including asthma, cancer, epilepsy),
neurodevelopmental (cognitive or motor problems, autism or
attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder) or psychiatric
problems such as anxiety or depression in adolescence.279 It
is hypothesized that most observed associations with
neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders in children may
reﬂect that SSRIs are merely a “proxy exposure” for the
shared genetics that place both parent and child at increased
risk of these conditions (as well as the exposure to the
environmental risk of parental mental illnesses).

In general, antidepressants do not have signiﬁcant adverse
effects on infants exposed via lactation, nor do they
substantially impact breastmilk production.280 Fluoxetine
has a longer half-life than many SSRIs and so other medications
with shorter half-lives are preferred. There have also been case
reports of infant seizure associated with bupropion, although
these may have been due to other factors and not the medication
per se. The only medication not recommended in lactation is the
TCA doxepin, due to concern about infant sedation.281

Antiepileptics. Antiepileptic medications are used in the treat-
ment of BD and certain anxiety disorders. Carbamazepine,
lamotrigine and valproic acid are the only antiepileptics recom-
mended as monotherapies in the CANMAT BD guidelines, so
are reviewed here individually to the extent that it is possible
to separate out speciﬁc medications from class effects.
Valproic acid is associated with a substantially increased risk
for infant congenital malformations (mainly neural tube and
cardiac defects) after exposure in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy
and increased risk for child neurodevelopmental delay after
second and third trimester exposure (Box 2).282,283 As such, val-
proic acid is not recommended in pregnancy. In fact, due to its

without substantial risk to maternal psychiatric stability. In cases
where other medications have not been effective or tolerated (or
if the pregnancy is nearing term and the risk for destabilization
would be high with minimal reduction in risk from discontinu-
ing at that point), clinicians and patients should fully discuss the
risks and the potential beneﬁts of continuing to maintain this
medication. Although a systematic review of risks to the off-
spring associated with medication use in fathers and non-
birthing parents was outside the scope of our guideline, it is
important to mention recent literature investigating potential
congenital malformation and neurodevelopmental risks associ-
ated with the use of valproate in fathers. While the European
Medicines Agency’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment
Committee reported a study showing that paternal use of valpro-
ate exposure was associated with increased risk of neurodeve-
lopmental disorders but not congenital malformations in the
offspring,284 2 independent population-based studies that
adjusted for important confounders did not ﬁnd any association
between valproate use in fathers and congenital malformations
or neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring.285,286

Carbamazepine is also associated with an increased risk for
congenital malformations (likely in a dose-dependent manner
with greater risk as the dose increases). However, as the risk is
less than with valproic acid and there is minimal concern
about an association with adverse infant neurodevelopment
or obstetric outcomes, it can be used with more conﬁdence
after the ﬁrst trimester.282,283 Exposure to carbamazepine in
pregnancy may increase the risk of infant vitamin K deﬁ-
ciency, so vitamin K should be administered in late pregnancy
to reduce the risk for newborn bleeding.287 Carbamazepine
concentrations are not signiﬁcantly affected by pregnancy
so dose adjustments are not typically required.281

Lamotrigine is the antiepileptic with the most favourable
reproductive risk proﬁle in pregnancy and lactation.288
However, its elimination increases as early as 5 weeks gesta-
tion and by >200% during pregnancy in ∼80% of patients
so it can be difﬁcult to attain therapeutic concentrations in a
timely manner in pregnancy.289,290 For those already taking
lamotrigine, measurement of a pre-pregnancy lamotrigine con-
centration can help determine the baseline therapeutic concen-
tration. Having a target
therapeutic concentration can be
helpful in guiding treatment if symptoms worsen, and could
be used for proactive dose adjustments in an effort to reduce
risk for relapse.291 Lamotrigine levels return to pre-pregnancy
levels within the ﬁrst 2 weeks postpartum, so the dose can be
tapered to the original dose associated with symptom remis-
sion prior to pregnancy.289 This is particularly important if
the patient was taking a high dose (i.e., greater than 200 mg)
prior to pregnancy, to prevent adverse side effects or toxicity.
Folic acid supplementation of at least 0.4 mg/day is recom-
mended when antiepileptics are prescribed in pregnancy. The
evidence for whether a higher dose of folic acid supplementa-
tion (i.e., 4 to 5 mg) deﬁnitely reduces the risk of neural tube
and cardiac defects remains inconclusive.292 There has been
some concern raised about whether folic acid could reduce

the effectiveness of lamotrigine in non-perinatal populations
with BD, so patients using lamotrigine with folic acid supple-
mentation should be carefully monitored for potential clinical
symptom re-emergence.293

Box 2. Summary of evidence on the safety of
antiepileptic use in pregnancy (for antiepileptics
indicated in the treatment of psychiatric disorders)

All are Level 3 evidence

unless otherwise speciﬁed.

Pregnancy complications: Antiepileptics as a group are

associated with a slightly increased risk for postpartum
haemorrhage and induction of labour.294 Because these
complications are also associated with epilepsy (the illness
exposure primarily studied for antiepileptic exposure)
independent of pharmacotherapy, it is difﬁcult to estimate the
risk for the non-epileptic pregnant patient with a psychiatric
disorder. Analysis of data on antiepileptic exposure across
studies suggests that these medications do not appear to
increase the risk of gestational hypertension, bleeding in
pregnancy, or caesarean section (Level 4

).295

Congenital malformations: Risk for major congenital
malformation is elevated with valproic acid exposure. This
includes an increased risk of cardiac malformations (e.g., atrial
septal defects), hypospadias, neural tube defects (e.g., spina biﬁda,
craniosynostosis) and oral clefts.282,296,297 Risk of congenital
malformations with valproic acid may be up to 3-fold higher or
more than the general population. Carbamazepine is also
associated with a slightly elevated risk for congenital
malformations including neural tube defects, cardiac
malformations, urinary tract abnormalities and oral cleft/palate
defects, but to a much lesser degree (e.g., pooled OR
1.37).282,296,298 Risk for congenital malformations with lamotrigine
is not signiﬁcantly greater than that of the general population.282
Fetal growth: Antiepileptic medications in general have been

associated with small absolute increased risks for
small-for-gestational age and low birthweight, and with a small
reduction in birthweight (∼119 g), but overall not birth height or
head circumference.299 These risks may be increased with
polytherapy of antiepileptic agents.299 Reduced fetal head
growth may be associated with carbamazepine exposure.300
Neonatal complications: Antiepileptic exposure in
general may increase the risk of neonatal intensive care unit
admission and may be associated with increased risk for
preterm birth but data are mostly in populations with
epilepsy (which is associated with its own reproductive risks
that may not be applicable in psychiatric populations).294
When lamotrigine exposure has been studied in isolation, it
does not appear to be associated with neonatal
complications (Level 4

).301

Longer-term child health: Risk for global language deﬁcits
and for intellectual and developmental disorders are increased
up to 4–5 fold with valproic acid exposure and there appears to
be a dose–response relationship. There may be an elevated risk
for neurodevelopmental disorders with exposure to pregabalin
(discussed herein as it is a monotherapy recommended in the
treatment of GAD).283,302,303 Neither carbamazepine nor
lamotrigine have been consistently associated with
neurodevelopmental risks including intelligence, or mental and
behavioural disorders; data are limited for other
antiepileptics.283,302,304,305

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 70(6)

There is ample data suggesting that there are very few
adverse effects from lamotrigine exposure in lactation.306
Carbamazepine levels are detectable in breastfed infants
although only minor adverse effects have been reported.307
While few adverse effects of valproic acid in lactation are
reported, it is not recommended to start valproic acid in lacta-
tion due to the risk for a subsequent pregnancy unless there is a
reasonable clinical rationale, patient preference and use of a
method of contraception that ensures that an unplanned preg-
nancy would be highly unlikely (e.g., birth control implant,
).308 If a patient was taking
intrauterine device) (Level 4
valproic acid throughout the pregnancy, then it can be contin-
ued during lactation if the patient chooses to breastfeed.

Antipsychotics. Second-generation antipsychotics (e.g., olanza-
pine, quetiapine, risperidone) are a mainstay of medication treat-
ment in BD (acute mania, depression and postpartum psychosis)
and are also used in the treatment of MDD, some anxiety disor-
ders, OCD and PTSD, mostly as adjunctive agents. Older, ﬁrst-
generation antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol or loxapine) may be
used in mania, severe acute agitation or postpartum psychosis
(see Question 9). In general, antipsychotic dosing is similar
inside and outside of the perinatal period, although the increased
metabolism of pregnancy may lead to a need for dosage adjust-
ments if symptoms re-emerge.309

Antipsychotics have typically been studied more as a class
than individually with respect to their perinatal safety, with a
few exceptions. Most data pertain to ﬁrst-generation or older
second-generation antipsychotic medications (e.g., olanza-
pine, quetiapine, risperidone) (Box 3). There is very limited
information about long-acting injectable antipsychotic medi-
cations in the perinatal period, with the available evidence

Second-generation antipsychotics (particularly olanzapine
and to a lesser extent quetiapine) may be associated with
some increased risk for metabolic complications such as ges-
tational diabetes and large-for-gestational age infants.314,315
Antipsychotic exposure in pregnancy may also be associated
with transient delays in neurodevelopment in infancy, but
does not at this time appear to be associated with longer-term
child health or developmental problems.316

Box 3. Summary of evidence for the safety of
antipsychotic use in pregnancy

All are Level 3

evidence unless otherwise speciﬁed.

Pregnancy complications: Second-generation antipsychotics

with a high-risk for metabolic effects are associated with an
increased risk of gestational diabetes that appears to be most
signiﬁcant for olanzapine (RR ∼ 1.6) and for quetiapine (RR ∼
1.3) than for other second-generation antipsychotics.315 Risk for
SA does not appear to be elevated for those taking ﬁrst- or
second- generation antipsychotics.317

Congenital malformations: Neither ﬁrst- nor second-
generation antipsychotics appear to increase the risk for major
congenital malformations, although some data suggest the
possibility of a small increased risk for cardiac malformations
with risperidone (RR ∼ 1.3).312,318 Accumulating data for
ziprasidone and lurasidone suggest a favourable safety proﬁle
without increased risk but more data are needed for
lurasidone.309,312,319 Data for newer antipsychotics, such as
cariprazine and asenapine, are too sparse to draw clinical
conclusions.

Fetal growth: Second- but not ﬁrst-generation

antipsychotics are linked to large for gestational age (RR ∼
1.6),314 and ﬁndings are mixed for small for gestational age and
growth restriction with both types of agents.314,320

Neonatal complications: There does not appear to be an

elevated risk for preterm birth320 or stillbirth.317 Infants
exposed to ﬁrst- or second-generation antipsychotics
may experience symptoms in the time shortly after delivery
such as respiratory distress, fussiness and gastrointestinal
issues which may require neonatal intensive care admission,
although the magnitude of elevated risk for these outcomes (or
whether the risk for this is confounded by other factors) is
unclear.309

Longer-term child health: Antipsychotic exposure in-utero
has been relatively consistently associated with transient delays
in motor development in the ﬁrst few months of life that appear
to resolve in the ﬁrst 1–2 years (RR ∼ 1.36).316 Antipsychotics
have not been consistently associated with long-term adverse
effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes (including behavioural
disorders, autism spectrum disorder, attention deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder and intelligence quotient) or
psychomotor development.320

All lactation safety evidence on antipsychotics stems from
uncontrolled case series or observational studies (Level 4
). Olanzapine and quetiapine are the agents with the
most reported cases in lactation and appear to have a favour-
able risk proﬁle.321,322 Although fewer cases have been
reported, risperidone and aripiprazole also appear to have
low transfer into breast milk, although risperidone has been
linked to more reports of adverse neonatal reactions than
the aforementioned medications.323,324 There have been
several case reports of reduced breastmilk production with
aripiprazole, but data are limited. Minimal data on lactation
safety are available for ziprasidone, and even less for other
antipsychotic medications. Adverse
second-generation
effects in infants are more commonly reported for ﬁrst-
generation than for second-generation antipsychotics in lac-
tation, thus more caution is recommended when using ﬁrst-
generation antipsychotics in lactation.325,326

Lithium. Lithium is indicated in the treatment of BD and
as an adjunctive agent in the treatment of MDD. For a
signiﬁcant number of
individuals with a history of
severe bipolar I episodes, lithium may be particularly
effective and so reducing or stopping it in pregnancy
must be weighed against risk of severe relapse. That

La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie

being said, lithium use in the ﬁrst trimester is associated
with a small increased risk for malformations (including
the rare Ebstein’s anomaly).327 It has also been linked to
a small increased risk for some neonatal complications,
including preterm birth, infant hypoglycemia, abnormal
thyroid and kidney function lab values, and decreased
muscle tone; data suggesting lack of longer-term neuro-
developmental impact in children are reasonably reassur-
ing (Box 4).

evidence unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Pregnancy complications: Spontaneous abortion,

pre-eclampsia and postpartum haemorrhage do not appear to
be associated with lithium exposure.328–330

Congenital malformations: During the ﬁrst trimester, there
is an increased risk (Relative Risk, RR ∼ 1.7) for cardiovascular
malformations including Ebstein’s anomaly that appears to be
dose-dependent, but the absolute risk is low (i.e., an RR of 1.7
would increase the risk from 1–5 to 2–8 per 200,000 births).331
No associations with congenital malformations other than
cardiac malformations have been clearly identiﬁed.329 A recent
meta-analysis reported an increased risk for congenital
anomalies overall, but this did not separate out the risk of
cardiac malformations from the overall risk for
malformations.328

Fetal growth: Low birth weight has not been associated with

lithium exposure but some data suggest an increased risk for
large for gestational age at birth (RR ∼ 2.6).328–330

Neonatal complications: Data from well-controlled studies
do not support a risk for preterm birth.328,330 There may be a

such as
increased cardiac output and glomerular ﬁltration rate

cation adjustment.333,334 There are no standard guide-
lines for monitoring lithium levels in pregnancy. At
ﬁrst assessment or in early pregnancy, obtaining a base-
line level is advised. Clinicians can then monitor lithium

effects emerge and adjust as needed.24,333,335 Dose

as this condition signiﬁcantly increases the risk for
maternal/fetal toxicity. If holding lithium for an extended
period is required, an alternate mood stabilizer may need
to be considered for relapse prevention. Patients with
gestational hypertension, which also impairs kidney
function, should be closely monitored to prevent toxicity.
Because of anticipated maternal volume contraction post-
delivery, the pre-pregnancy dose (or 150 to 300 mg less
than the dose in pregnancy if
the medication was
started in pregnancy) can then be resumed immediately
post-birth. Monitor the lithium level 5–7 days later, and
adjust the dose as needed for symptom control and to
reach therapeutic concentration. There is some contro-
versy on whether to hold the lithium dose for 24–48 h
at the onset of labour to both prevent maternal toxicity
and to reduce lithium exposure levels through the umbil-
ical cord at delivery (Box 5).

Box 5. Lithium and holding the dose at the onset of
labour: reconciling conﬂicting evidence

Some experts advocate for holding the dose to reduce the
risks for maternal toxicity (due to maternal volume
contraction post-delivery) and adverse neonatal effects (due
to high levels of lithium exposure via the umbilical cord).336
Others have expressed concerns that holding the lithium
dose could increase the risk for postpartum maternal
relapse, with minimal beneﬁt of reduced exposure to the
infant.337 While maternal volume contraction does occur
post-delivery, it is unlikely that there would be immediate
maternal toxicity if a dose is not held. That being said, based
on the half-life of lithium in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid, holding
the dose for 24–48 h should also not signiﬁcantly increase
the risk of episode recurrence.338,339 Existing studies with
infants exposed to very high concentrations of lithium
(mean 1.68 mmol/L, range up to 2.6 mmol/L) showed an
increased risk for adverse effects in the neonate (Level 4

).336 In contrast, a cohort study of 29 neonates exposed
to lithium during birth did not show a signiﬁcant association
with adverse effects with a mean lithium level of 0.61 (SD =
).337 Therefore, in the absence of
0.31) mmol/L (Level 4
more deﬁnitive evidence, clinicians can consider holding the
lithium dose at the onset of labour or induction (or for 24 h
prior to a scheduled caesarean birth) when lithium
concentration is 0.7 mmol/L or higher as this may reduce
the amount of lithium in the umbilical cord without
substantively increasing the risk for maternal relapse. An
informed decision-making process should take place with
the patient, considering both their clinical severity and risk
for relapse, as well as the health of the pregnancy to date.
Holding the lithium dose may not be appropriate in patients
who are at very high risk for postpartum mania or
psychosis, or other high-risk clinical situations such as
suicide or infanticide (see Question 9).

There is also some debate around lithium use in lacta-
tion. Lithium is excreted by the kidney, so there is poten-
tial for immature infant renal function to lead to high
lithium levels with resultant adverse effects.

While some early data were concerning, it was unclear
whether infant adverse effects were due to exposure in
lactation, or from gestational exposure.340 More recent
data suggest
that adverse effects are limited to mild
cases of hypotonia that resolve spontaneously and to tran-
sient or reversible lab abnormalities (e.g., blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine, TSH).340 For those maintained on
lithium therapy, the decision about whether to breastfeed
(vs. formula feed or use donor milk) must be personalized
to the risk of relapse when considering discontinuation or
alternative treatment, the infant’s health and the patient’s
preference.341 CANMAT does not recommend breastmilk
exposure in premature infants, infants with kidney mal-
formations, or with illnesses that may cause dehydration
). Postnatal lithium exposure via lactation

feeding difﬁculties. Therefore, CANMAT also recom-
mends that infants be monitored for any change in behav-
iour and muscle tone and in the case of these or any other
clinical concerns, lithium levels, cardiac (e.g., via electro-
cardiogram),
thyroid and kidney function should be
assessed (Level 4

Sedative-Hypnotic Medications. Benzodiazepines are some-
times used to manage acute anxiety and sedative-
hypnotic medications (i.e., benzodiazepines and the hyp-
notic benzodiazepine receptor agonists such as zopiclone
or zolpidem) are also considered a treatment option in
more severe cases of insomnia. These are intended for
short-term use only due to concern about developing tol-
erance and dependency. Safety in pregnancy and lacta-
tion must be considered with respect
to their use.

Treatment Recommendations

recommendations,

To decide Line of Treatment
the
CANMAT guideline committee started with relevant non-
perinatal
treatment guidelines, where medications are
ordered by efﬁcacy and tolerability. We used the most
recently published CANMAT guidelines for MDD, OCD
and BD, the World Federation of Societies of Biological
Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for anxiety disorders and

the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S.
Department of Defense for PTSD since the most recent
Canadian guidelines for anxiety disorders and PTSD
were published in 2014.345–347 We ranked the medication
options for monotherapies from these guidelines only, as
there is minimal safety evidence for speciﬁc combinations
of medications in the perinatal period. Based on perinatal-
speciﬁc considerations, we adjusted medications up or
down in Lines of Treatment for the current guideline by
consensus recommendation (Box 6). In pregnancy, we
considered data on:
(a) congenital malformation risk
(usually a concern for ﬁrst trimester exposures only), preg-
nancy and obstetric complications, fetal growth, neonatal
complications and latent developmental effects and (b)
the safety of the medications in lactation since it is prefer-
able not
to have to change a medication in the early
postpartum period given that this is the highest-risk time
for a relapse. In the postpartum recommendations, we con-
sidered safety in lactation, and the possibility of a future
pregnancy, as many parents will be planning for another
child soon and unplanned pregnancies are relatively
common. We also considered other aspects of maternal tol-
erability that are important in the postpartum. For example,
if a medication causes substantial maternal sedation, it
may not be ideal due to night-time infant awakenings
and daytime caregiving needs unless there is additional
caregiver support.

Line of Treatment recommendations are for patients initiat-
ing a new medication or those who require a medication
switch because the current medication is ineffective, poorly
tolerated or contra-indicated perinatally. For patients on main-
tenance pharmacotherapy, risk for relapse if the medication
were to be discontinued or switched (and its potential implica-
tions) must be weighed against medication safety concerns.348
Generally, the more severe the illness (i.e., number of epi-
sodes, severity of symptoms), and the longer the time to treat-
ment response after initiation of medication in the past, the
greater the risk of discontinuing or switching medication.
Importantly (see Box 6), when symptoms are well-controlled,
it is not usually advisable for a medication to be changed to
another one based on its placement in the Line of Treatment

tables, unless it
serious issues about perinatal safety. For patients taking med-
ications where there is insufﬁcient evidence about safety in
pregnancy or lactation to be included as a ﬁrst-, second- or
third-line treatment, the clinician will need to consider treat-
ment history (i.e., were other medications previously ineffec-
tive for that patient?), and severity of illness (i.e., what
would be the potential risk for relapse with medication discon-
tinuation or switch and the potential consequences of such a
relapse?)
to help the patient make an informed choice
aligned with their values and preferences. For patients who
are not taking medication at the time of presentation, but
who have responded to a speciﬁc medication in the past, the
best agent may be the one they have responded to previously,

cally contraindicated.

• Options are classiﬁed into ﬁrst-line, second-line and third-line

treatment recommendations for each PMAD.

• Lines of treatment were created by initially considering the
placement of individual agents in non-perinatal treatment
guidelines, and then by adding, removing, or moving agents up
or down in lines of treatment based on evidence for their
safety and efﬁcacy in pregnancy and in lactation. For example,
if 2 medications were similarly effective and tolerated in
non-perinatal populations, but safety data in pregnancy and
lactation were more reassuring for one medication, that agent
would be placed in a higher line of treatment.

• Within lines of treatment, agents are listed alphabetically. A
justiﬁcation for placement column contains the rationale for
placing the medications within that line of treatment. Clinicians
and patients can use this information to help select which
agent(s) to try ﬁrst within each line of treatment. Such decisions
may be based on prior history or response/tolerability with
previous treatments and/or how patients value the potential
beneﬁts and risks associated with speciﬁc agents.

• Although CANMAT recommends that agents listed in a

higher line of treatment be tried ﬁrst, there may be speciﬁc
reasons for choosing an agent in a lower treatment line such
as patient preference, prior treatment response or
non-response, or other clinical features. Speciﬁcally:
•

In individuals on medication(s) whose symptoms are well-
controlled, the medication(s) should not usually be changed
to another one based on its placement in the rankings,
unless the current agent is listed as “not recommended.”
Switching medication may lead to clinical worsening.
If a medicine is taken in pregnancy, it is generally preferable
to continue it postpartum to reduce the risk for clinical
worsening. Signiﬁcantly less medication enters breastmilk
than passes through the placenta, so there would be few
beneﬁts of stopping or switching medications immediately
post-delivery. Changes do not usually need to be made for
lactation unless the patient is doing poorly clinically, or the
medication is causing signiﬁcant adverse effects in the
patient or infant.

Considerations of Monotherapy versus Combination Medication
Treatment. As the combined use of 2 or more agents during
pregnancy is associated with a slightly increased risk for
adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes compared with
monotherapy,349 monotherapy
preferred.
Clinicians are encouraged to consider a higher dosage of a
single medication (or augmenting with psychotherapy
when available) before prescribing multiple medications.
For those presenting on 2 or more agents, it is recommended
that clinicians take a careful history of the indication for each
medication and its effectiveness, to determine whether one or
more medications can be safely discontinued. Caution is rec-
ommended not to expose, or maintain exposure, to medica-
tions that are not clearly effective. However, lowering the
dose or minimizing the number medication exposures

response. In this guideline, given the minimal available
safety evidence about medication combinations, Lines of
Treatment are presented for monotherapies only. Because
combination treatment is often needed (especially in severe
depression, OCD, BD and/or postpartum psychosis), clini-
cians may need to use the available safety evidence for mono-
therapies or medication classes to inform the best approach
for a speciﬁc patient.

MDD. Pharmacotherapy in pregnancy is reserved for indi-
viduals who have a severe MDE, those at high risk for
relapse, those who are unable to access or have an inade-
quate response to psychotherapy, or those who prefer to
use medication. For those already taking maintenance
antidepressant medication,
there should be counselling
around the risk for relapse if medication were to be dis-
continued for pregnancy. Discontinuation of antidepres-
sants in pregnancy has been associated with an elevated
risk for relapse among those with a more severe depres-
sion history (i.e., multiple previous episodes, a greater
severity of depression), but population-level
studies
those with mild-to-moderate depression
suggest
severity may be not at signiﬁcantly increased risk.350
Patients should also be counselled on risk for antidepres-
sant discontinuation syndrome, which could be particu-

Pregnancy. Antidepressant medications are the mainstay
of pharmacotherapy treatment
for MDD in pregnancy
(Table 10). The ﬁrst-line medications—citalopram, escitalo-
pram and sertraline—are ﬁrst-line medications outside of the
perinatal period, generally well-tolerated and have the most
reassuring safety data in pregnancy. The second-line medica-
tions are all ﬁrst-line medications outside the perinatal
period, but are downgraded here as initial selections
because either there are some (albeit minimal) safety con-
cerns, there is less certainty about their safety, or tolerability
is not as good as that of the ﬁrst-line medications. Selection
from within second-line medications can be made by clini-
cians and patients based on what patients prefer, and how
they value the various risks, side effects and beneﬁts pre-
sented. Paroxetine is listed as a third-line agent in pregnancy
because of its links, albeit somewhat inconsistent, to a higher
risk for cardiac malformations. However, it is reasonable to
prescribe paroxetine if patients have had a good response
to it and prefer it over other available agents. In this case,
Level II ultrasonography in pregnancy is recommended to

macotherapy postpartum. It is expected that the efﬁcacy of
antidepressants would be similar in the postpartum as in non-

ment of MDD can be followed, also incorporating the
possibility of postpartum-depression speciﬁc pharmacothera-
pies. Brexanolone (IV) and zuranolone (PO) (not yet available
in Canada) are synthetic analogs of allopregnanolone that have
been shown in RCTs to be effective for treating PPD in those
who developed depression in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy or
in the ﬁrst 4 weeks postpartum speciﬁcally (Level 1
).252,253 The onset of symptom reduction appears to be
within hours for brexanolone and within days for zurano-
lone. However, common side effects of these medications
include headache, dizziness and drowsiness or sedation,
and brexanolone requires about 72 h of continuous moni-
toring in an inpatient setting for the intravenous infusion
due to the potential for excessive sedation and sudden
loss of consciousness. There is as yet an insufﬁcient
amount of safety data on these agents in lactation, so
until data in lactation are available, they can be considered

cians are advised to consider risk for patient relapse on an indi-
vidualized basis when making recommendations about whether
to start (or restart) antidepressants in euthymic patients with a
history of PPD in the postpartum period.

Anxiety Disorders. While 7 anxiety disorders exist
in the
DSM-5, there is currently no formally recognized, distinct
perinatal anxiety disorder. For individuals presenting in

pregnancy or in pre-pregnancy planning on maintenance
medication therapy,
the principles outlined for decision-
making in MDD (see above) can be applied for anxiety dis-
orders, as there are no data speciﬁcally on risk for relapse
with discontinuation of medication in pregnancy. The poten-
tial implications of relapse should be considered based on the
nature of the person’s anxiety disorder, and the risks of
impact of relapse or symptom recurrence on daily function.
There are no RCTs evaluating pharmacological treatments
for anxiety disorders perinatally. In this guideline, formal treat-
ment recommendations for initial medication selection are
made for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), the most
common anxiety disorder seen perinatally, although the princi-
ples can be applied for other anxiety disorders by consulting
treatment guidelines for the other anxiety disorders along
with the safety information in pregnancy and lactation

presented herein. In perinatal GAD, antidepressants are also
considered to be the main pharmacotherapeutic treatments,
although medications from other classes are recommended in
non-perinatal treatment guidelines. For GAD in pregnancy
(Table 12), valproic acid is not recommended due to its terato-
genicity (Box 3), nor is regular/daily benzodiazepine use (see
sedative and hypnotics above). While no agents used to treat
anxiety disorder in the postpartum period are absolutely contra-
indicated, there are inadequate data to recommend most newer
agents in lactation and it is not recommend to start valproic acid

Medication recommendations for OCD are in Tables 14
and 15 for pregnancy and lactation, respectively. No ﬁrst-
or second-line pharmacotherapy treatments in the most
recent CANMAT OCD guidelines fall into the not recom-
mended or insufﬁcient data category.356 Similar to anxiety
disorders, there are no speciﬁc data on relapse risk if mainte-
nance pharmacotherapy is discontinued, and the principles of
depression management apply here as well.

OCD. There are no RCTs evaluating pharmacological treat-
ments for OCD perinatally. The mainstays of medication
treatment for OCD are antidepressants that inhibit serotonin
reuptake (e.g., the SSRIs and the TCA clomipramine). In
non-perinatal samples, higher doses tend to produce greater

PTSD. There are no RCTs evaluating pharmacological treat-
ments for PTSD perinatally. As such, CANMAT recom-
mends that the use of pharmacological treatment for PTSD
perinatally follows the guidance from non-perinatal clinical
practice guidelines for PTSD. Non-perinatal guidelines

recommend psychological therapies as ﬁrst-line treatments
(i.e., before pharmacological therapies) unless these are not
available, severity of illness is so high that patients are not
able to engage in that type of therapy without stabilization
with medication, or medication is preferred.347 When phar-
macological treatments are used, recent U.S. clinical practice
guidelines (updated 2023) recommend only the antidepres-
sant medications sertraline, venlafaxine and paroxetine,
indicating that the evidence for other medications is either
of low quality or that evident beneﬁts do not outweigh
potential harms or tolerability issues.347 Fluoxetine was at
one time also in the list in a previous version of this guide-
line, and other guidelines.347 However a recent systematic
review has raised questions about its efﬁcacy.357 Based on
these recommendations, for pharmacological treatment of
PTSD in perinatal populations, sertraline is considered ﬁrst-
line in pregnancy, with venlafaxine as second-line and par-
oxetine as third-line due to its risk proﬁle (Table 16). In
the postpartum, sertraline remains the ﬁrst-line treatment
recommendation. If another pregnancy is not planned (and
birth control measures are in place), then paroxetine may
become second-line together with venlafaxine (Table 17).

Prazosin is a medication that has been inconsistently recom-
mended in clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of
nightmares speciﬁcally in PTSD. CANMAT does not rec-
ommend the use of prazosin perinatally as data during preg-
nancy are limited with some concerning fetal effects, and
there are very minimal data available on its safety in lacta-
tion (Level 4

).358

Bipolar Disorder. Although there are no RCTs for the pharma-
cotherapeutic treatment of BD perinatally, the mainstay of
acute and maintenance treatment for BD in pregnancy and
postpartum is medication, primarily certain antiepileptics, anti-
psychotics and lithium. The speciﬁc medications that are
advised may differ depending on the type of illness (i.e., BD
type I or type II), and phase of illness, namely acute depres-
sion, mania/mixed states and maintenance treatment. In the
postpartum, if not considering lactation, treatment recommen-
dations can be based on general CANMAT BD guidelines,
except for postpartum psychosis (see Question 9). Clinical
pearls for prescribing in perinatal bipolar disorder are in Box 7.

Box 7. Clinical pearls for prescribing in perinatal BD

Maternal medical concerns may impact medication choices. For
instance, quetiapine and olanzapine, due to concerns about
metabolic impacts, may be downgraded in those who have risk
factors for gestational diabetes (i.e., high body mass index, family
history of type 2 diabetes), given diabetes increases the risk of
pregnancy and neonatal complications. Similarly, lithium may be
downgraded or not recommended in those with renal problems.
For infants born preterm or with medical comorbidities, it is
important to try to avoid medications with risks for adverse
effects due to breastmilk exposure and those without data. If this
is not an option, formula feeding is a recommended alternative
to discontinuation of an effective agent. Discontinuation of
effective treatment signiﬁcantly increases the risk of episode
recurrence in BD, particularly postpartum.

show that maintaining pharmacological treatment in preg-
nancy signiﬁcantly decreases risk of symptom re-emergence

for medications that are likely to be associated with small ele-

be counselled about the various beneﬁts and risks of their
medications in the context of their clinical condition and

relapse risk, but it is CANMAT’s opinion that most patients
in remission who choose to stay on pharmacological treat-
ment should be supported in continuing existing medication
regimens in pregnancy. A notable exception to this recom-
mendation is valproic acid. Serious consideration should be
given to switching valproic acid to another medication
even if it has been an effective treatment given the elevated
risk for congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental
problems in offspring (see Box 2).

Bipolar disorder has the highest relapse rate for any
mental disorder in the postpartum period, at on average,
37%.24 Most relapses are non-psychotic depressive episodes,
but as many as 1 in 6 (17%) will be episodes of psychosis,
mania, or other severe presentations requiring psychiatric
hospitalization.24 Risk of an acute mood episode postpartum
is as high as 66% in those not taking vs. 23% in those taking
medication.24 As such, continuation of pregnancy medica-
tions into the postpartum is strongly recommended and initi-
ation of medication in the immediate postpartum is generally
recommended to prevent relapse in those who did not take
medication in pregnancy. The potential for adverse effects
on the infant due to medication exposure in lactation
(which will vary based on the medication) needs to be con-
sidered, as does the potential for maternal sleep deprivation.
Sleep interruption is expected with a newborn but can be
exacerbated when the patient is waking frequently at night

to feed their infant. For this reason, plans for infant feeding
must be tailored to the individual patient. Where possible,
limiting the amount of patient waking overnight by
pumping milk in advance or using formula or donor milk,
and having a partner, family member, doula or night nurse
do some or all of the nighttime infant feedings may optimize
longer durations of consolidated sleep (Level 4

).

be used but is downgraded to third-line in favour of the
above-mentioned options for which there are more data avail-
able. Valproic acid is not recommended perinatally due to
safety concerns. There are not enough safety data in preg-
nancy to reassuringly recommend other ﬁrst-line medications
(asenapine, cariprazine).

Olanzapine, although an excellent anti-mania agent, is
second-line outside the perinatal period due to concerns
about metabolic impacts. Its safety data are relatively reas-
suring in pregnancy, despite a possible increased risk for
gestational diabetes, but it can cause sedation, so remains
a second-line agent herein. If used in pregnancy, a switch
to a more metabolically friendly option should be consid-
ered to prevent
lactation. Haloperidol,
another second-line agent non-perinatally, also remains
second-line given its
reasonable reproductive safety
proﬁle, although as it does not have strong evidence for
relapse prevention, it would also likely need to be switched
to another medication after the acute phase. Carbamazepine
and ziprasidone are second-line agents outside the perinatal

relapse after

period, but are downgraded to third-line perinatally due to
the potential for malformations and vitamin K deﬁciency
with carbamazepine, and the limited amount of safety
data available for ziprasidone. Other non-perinatal third-
line medication options remain third-line perinatally,
except for tamoxifen which is not recommended due to

Monotherapies considered ﬁrst-line treatments for the tra-

criteria for depression and mania are met at the same time)
are asenapine and aripiprazole.361 As such, aripiprazole is
the recommended ﬁrst-line agent in pregnancy in this case.
As yet, there are no medications that meet evidence levels
to be ﬁrst-line recommendations for the DSM-5 deﬁnitions
of depression with mixed features or mania with mixed
features.361

In lactation, quetiapine remains ﬁrst-line for mania
despite its metabolic effects and potential for sedation, as
does aripiprazole although the volume of safety data is
less than for quetiapine and it may reduce breastmilk.

aAlso ﬁrst-line treatment for mixed states.

Data in lactation are also reasonably reassuring for risper-
idone so it can also be used as a ﬁrst-line option. There is
more potential for metabolic effects and sedation with olan-
zapine than the above-mentioned drugs, but its reasonable
safety proﬁle in lactation suggests that it can be considered
a second-line option for acute mania. Switching from olan-
zapine to a more metabolically friendly option for relapse
prevention in the longer-term would be advisable. Other
potential medications are ranked accordingly based on
what is known about their efﬁcacy outside the perinatal
safety in and impact on lactation
period, and their
(Table 19). As in pregnancy, aripiprazole is the ﬁrst-line
agent recommended for acute mixed states in lactation.

Bipolar I Depression. For acute BD I depression, quetia-
pine and lamotrigine are ﬁrst-line recommendations in preg-
nancy, although it may be sometimes challenging to reach
therapeutic levels with lamotrigine (and thus a therapeutic

effect) in pregnancy due to the signiﬁcant increase in metab-
olism (Table 20). Lithium, a ﬁrst-line agent non-perinatally, is
second-line in pregnancy due to its safety and use proﬁle. As
there are minimal safety data in pregnancy for lurasidone
(another ﬁrst-line agent non-perinatally) it is not included in
the treatment recommendations here. Neither of the 2 non-
perinatal second-line options (valproic acid and cariprazine)
are recommend herein due to safety concerns and insufﬁcient
safety data, respectively. While olanzapine is efﬁcacious, it is
considered a third-line option outside of the perinatal period
due to the potential for metabolic side effects. In pregnancy,
however, due to its relatively favourable reproductive safety
proﬁle, it is a reasonable second-line medication in pregnancy,
with a plan to change to a medication with a more favour-
able metabolic proﬁle after lactation. Carbamazepine is
considered a third-line option based on both its efﬁcacy
proﬁle and the higher risk for congenital malformations
than lamotrigine.

In the postpartum, lamotrigine is a ﬁrst-line medication given
that its metabolism normalizes and it has a favourable reproduc-
tive safety proﬁle in lactation (Table 21). Quetiapine follows as
a ﬁrst-line treatment, due to concern about maternal metabolic
effects. The remainder of the monotherapies follow the same
order as the recommendations in pregnancy,
for similar
reasons. There is some emergent safety data for lurasidone,
which has Level 2 evidence for efﬁcacy outside the perinatal
period, however, the lactation safety data are not yet clear
enough to support recommending this medication. Valproic
acid is not recommended due to concern about future pregnan-
cies in the reproductive-aged population, unless there is a rea-
sonable clinical rationale, patient preference and use of a
highly-effective method of contraception.

Bipolar II Depression. For acute BD II depression, rec-
ommendations based on non-perinatal efﬁcacy suggest que-
tiapine should be ﬁrst-line, and lamotrigine and lithium
second-line due to their more limited efﬁcacy. We also con-
sider lamotrigine as a reasonable ﬁrst-line agent in pregnancy
due to its favourable safety proﬁle (Table 22). Due to its
potential adverse effects, lithium remains second-line. In
the postpartum, as quetiapine is associated with sedation,
lamotrigine might be preferred for some patients. As such,
in lactation and in the postpartum generally, we recommend
either quetiapine or lamotrigine as ﬁrst-line options, with
lithium remaining second-line as it is in non-perinatal popu-
lations (Table 23).

Antidepressant monotherapy is sometimes carefully used
with close monitoring in the case of depression without
mixed features outside the perinatal period even though it
induced mania or
confers some risk for antidepressant

mixed states. Due to the elevated risk for postpartum psycho-
sis among those with BD (even BD II) this is not an ideal
strategy perinatally, especially in the ﬁrst 3 months postpar-
tum and especially as monotherapy without a mood stabiliz-
ing medication (see Question 9). That being said, sertraline,
given its relatively favourable reproductive safety proﬁle in
pregnancy and lactation, could be a second-line treatment
in pregnancy and in lactation, although it should likely be
used after
the potentially more effective second-line
options. Clinicians should provide education to patients
(and partners when possible) about the possibility of emer-
gent manic or mixed symptoms, and develop a plan, includ-
ing how and when to seek urgent assistance.

Third-line treatments are the other antidepressants with
some efﬁcacy data in BD II depression (ﬂuoxetine and ven-
lafaxine), but
that have a less favourable reproductive
safety proﬁle than sertraline (see antidepressants section
and tables for MDD recommendations above). The same pre-
cautions about risk for postpartum psychosis would apply as
were described above for sertraline. Of the third-line mono-
therapies in non-perinatal populations, ziprasidone has
some reassuring safety data in pregnancy and lactation so
is a possibility. Valproic acid is not recommended in either
pregnancy or postpartum due to safety concerns.

pregnancy remain limited, these are not recommended as
routine treatments for depression in pregnancy at this time.
No recommendations can be made at this time for the use
of rTMS or tDCS perinatally for anxiety, OCD, PTSD or BD.
ECT, which is typically delivered 2–3 times a week,
requires a general anaesthetic and is associated with
is
more adverse effects than less invasive treatments,
also included in this category. In non-perinatal popula-
tions, ECT is generally used in severe depression, mania,
psychosis and/or acute suicidality.7,11 Maintenance ECT
is vital in some cases of refractory depression, and ECT
may work particularly quickly in treating acute psychotic
depression and in treating mania, so its use is clinically
important in the perinatal period as well.

Studies on ECT safety in the perinatal period are
limited to case studies or series, often with no comparison
groups, and there are no RCTs.372,373 Reports of ECT use
in pregnancy are limited to severe depression, psychosis
(with and without medications). ECT
and mania
appears relatively safe even when administered during
the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy. Adverse effects reported
in pregnancy include fetal arrhythmia, fetal bradycardia,
premature birth, abdominal pain, uterine contractions,
vaginal bleeding, placental abruption, threatened abor-
tion and fetal death, but it is difﬁcult to quantify risk
attributable to ECT in these high-risk cases (Level 3

).370,372,373
Based on these considerations, ECT is an appropriate ﬁrst-
line intervention for acute depression with severe psychotic or
catatonic features, acute suicidality or deteriorating physical
condition in pregnancy. ECT is also recommended for
severe presentations of depression, mania, mixed states or
psychosis, when pharmacological treatments are not success-
ful. ECT in pregnancy should occur in close collaboration
with anaesthesia and obstetrical
services. While most
general anaesthetics and muscle relaxants used in ECT admin-
istration are considered compatible with pregnancy, several
strategies to optimize safety of the patient and foetus have
been recommended.374 These include administering anti-
nausea agents prior to the procedure, adding sodium citrate
(oral) to prevent aspiration, avoiding hyperventilation prior
to induction (as pregnancy is already a state of mild hyperven-
tilation), elevation of the right hip (especially after 20 weeks

gestation) to avoid aortal-caval compression of placental
blood ﬂow and fetal monitoring before, during and after pro-
cedure (including continuous fetal monitoring throughout the
procedure and for some time afterward once it is possible to
do so based on the number of weeks gestation). Intubation
may be required depending on the stage of pregnancy to
avoid the risk of aspiration.

Safety concerns with ECT are less in the postpartum rel-
ative to pregnancy. It can be used for severe cases as in
non-perinatal populations with consideration given to the
perinatal context (e.g., needs for assistance with child-
care).
is generally recommended that patients can

Question 8. What Is Recommended for the
Use of Complementary and Alternative
Treatments?

CAM treatments are increasingly being studied for depres-
sion and anxiety in perinatal populations.11 Research on
CAMs perinatally is mostly in populations with mild-severity
depressive episodes (PPD or MDE in pregnancy) or elevated
depressive or anxiety symptoms based on standardized
symptom scale cut-off scores. The methodological quality
of the available literature is typically low, precluding the
ability to make recommendations for any CAMs as ﬁrst-line
treatments for the perinatal context.376 Further, evidence on
the use and effectiveness of some CAMs, such as yoga, acu-
puncture (a key component of traditional Chinese medicine),
and consuming speciﬁc foods and supplements, has been cul-
turally- or country-speciﬁc, so may not necessarily apply
the settings in which evaluation occurred.
outside of
However, it is clinically reasonable to consider the use of
CAMs that have promising evidence for efﬁcacy and
minimal evidence for harm as adjunctive treatments and/or
in individuals who prefer the use of CAMs.

Yoga can prevent depressive symptoms in pregnancy, and
can reduce depressive symptoms in pregnancy and in PPD

vention and treatment of anxiety in pregnancy.172,178,237,377–391

dence in reducing depressive symptoms postpartum and in
PPD speciﬁcally (Level 2

nancy (in some studies as an adjunct to the standard of care)
is effective in decreasing depressive symptoms in mild-
severity MDE and in reducing anxiety symptoms (Level 2

against neural tube defects in pregnancy with folic acids, or
treatment of anaemia with iron supplements), CANMAT
does not recommend the use of folic acids, high ﬂavonoid

following:

(cid:129) Inquire about suicidal thoughts, intent and/or plan, includ-
ing access to means (e.g., medications for intentional
overdose, ﬁrearms, knives).

(cid:129) Inquire about the presence of a safety plan and other strat-

egies to mitigate risk.

(cid:129) Inquire about thoughts about harming the infant or others,
and distinguish intrusive, ego-dystonic thoughts about
harm from intent to harm.

(cid:129) Assess for psychotic symptoms, including delusions, hal-
lucinations and/or disorganized thoughts or behaviours.

(cid:129) Inquire about and observe for signs of inability of the
patient to take care of themselves and/or others, including
child neglect or abuse.
(cid:129) Pursue collateral history,

instance from family
members, to clarify the level of risk, and assess family/
social support capacity to care for the patient and the
infant as well as the availability and use of other supports.

In any high-risk situation, referral to expert mental health
providers is warranted. Emergency services may be required,
which can be accessed by calling 9-1-1 or 9-8-8 (mental
health crisis line) in Canada and the U.S. and/or sending a
patient to the emergency department if there is a concern
about imminent harm to the patient or others. Clinicians
should follow their local professional practice guidelines,

laws and policies with respect to involuntary hospitalizations
and when to report to child protection services.

Postpartum Psychosis
Postpartum psychosis occurs after about 1–2 in 1000 births
and is a very high-risk perinatal mental health condition
due to its association with risk of maternal suicide and infan-
ticide.413 “Postpartum psychosis” is a term that is generally
used to refer to a speciﬁc unique mix of mood and psychotic
symptoms that are strongly associated with BD.414,415
Symptoms typically start within the ﬁrst week after delivery,
and almost always in the ﬁrst 4 weeks postpartum, although
they can also begin later in the postpartum period.416 They
can include delusions, hallucinations,
irritability, mood
swings/emotional lability, catatonia, agitation and/or hyper-
activity. Disorientation, depersonalization and derealization
can occur, but are less common than the mood symptoms.416
There can be rapid ﬂuctuation in symptoms,
including
changes in the level of consciousness in a delirium-like pre-
sentation. This can make diagnosis complicated as there may
be ﬂuctuation in and out of psychotic states. In some cases,
patients may present signs of impaired attachment with
their offspring.

in several

When considering a diagnosis of postpartum psychosis, it
is important to consider that psychotic symptoms such as
delusions, hallucinations and disorganization of thoughts
and behaviours can occur
contexts. The
DSM-5-TR allows the use of a “peripartum onset speciﬁer”
to characterize episodes of psychosis across various diag-
noses (e.g., MDD with psychotic features, BD). Psychotic
symptoms can also be seen in the context of a primary psy-
chotic disorder such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective dis-
order, with acute intoxication, or more rarely due to a general
medical condition. There is a need to consider this differen-
tial diagnosis. Treatment recommendations will differ if a
better explanation for the presentation would be a major
depression with psychotic features, acute intoxication or a psy-
chotic episode due to a general medical condition, instead of a
postpartum psychosis. There should be a full physical and neu-
rological examination and basic laboratory testing including
urine toxicology, to rule out any organic cause. Additional lab-
oratory tests and/or the use of EEG or neuroimaging scans
may be indicated when there is clinical suspicion of epi-
lepsy/seizures,
serious
medical conditions, including those that can cause neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms (e.g., anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis or
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome).

Prevention. The strongest risk factors for postpartum psy-

ous history of postpartum psychosis.24,416–418 As such,
individuals with a personal (or familial) history of BD or
postpartum psychosis should be provided with psychoeduca-
tion about their risk during or even before pregnancy. Sleep
deprivation may precipitate psychotic symptoms in this

group, although a reduced need for sleep can also be an
early sign of psychotic mania.419 A treatment plan aimed at
the prevention of psychosis should be offered, including con-

Regardless, close monitoring is required in the early postpar-
tum to identify early emerging symptoms. A longer hospital
stay for monitoring and implementation of sleep protection
strategies may also be considered, especially if the patient
displays initial signs of mental distress and/or does not
have appropriate social supports.

Primiparity as well as pregnancy and delivery complica-
tions, including pre-eclampsia, have also been identiﬁed as
factors associated with postpartum psychosis, although
most primiparous people and those with obstetrical compli-
cations do not develop it, so no speciﬁc recommendations
are made in this regard.24,416–418

Management. Postpartum psychotic symptoms require
urgent assessment and almost always require immediate
treatment, in an in-patient treatment setting. It is essential
to assess risk to self, the newborn, other children in the
home and other family members. Given the acute risks asso-
ciated with postpartum psychosis, it is not uncommon that
breastfeeding will need to be paused or discontinued for
the beneﬁt of both the patient and the baby. Clinicians
need to provide psychoeducation and ongoing support for
patients, family and other members of the patient’s support
system. Individuals with possible psychosis and thoughts
of harming themselves and/or the baby should not be left
alone, especially with the baby, until a comprehensive risk

their support system including active ongoing involvement

should be formulated,
closely monitored, and maintained until the psychotic symp-
toms fully subside (Level 4

is completed (Level 4

).213

Postpartum psychosis treatment should be individualized to
address the primary disorder and possible contributing psychi-
atric comorbidities, and to prevent recurrence of psychosis.
For acute treatment, the initial recommendation is to start anti-
psychotic medication with or without an intermittent benzo-
diazepine (such as lorazepam) to manage insomnia and/or to

After the acute episode of postpartum psychosis is

Acute Agitation
Acute agitation—that is, ranging from self-reported symp-
toms to observable impatience, restlessness and aggression
—in PMADs would be expected to occur mainly in the
context of mania or psychosis, but can also occur in acute
interpersonal crises, or other etiologies that should be
managed accordingly (e.g., a medical condition, substance
intoxication or withdrawal).

There are no RCTs on the management of acute agita-
tion in PMADs. A sequential approach to management is
recommended from the least
restrictive
),421,422 as follows: The ﬁrst step for cooper-
(Level 4
ative persons is verbal de-escalation. The next step is
offering oral medication. In this case, a benzodiazepine
can be used, with lorazepam preferred over longer-acting
benzodiazepines. Monotherapy is preferred but if the agi-
tation is more severe, especially in the context of psychotic
symptoms, an antipsychotic can be combined with a ben-
zodiazepine. If an individual has already started on an anti-
psychotic, then the dose can be optimized. In some cases,
an antipsychotic can be prescribed on an “as needed”
basis. Olanzapine is supplied in a rapid dissolving form
as well as intramuscular. Quetiapine is sedating but has a
slower onset of action and is only available in oral form.
Ziprasidone has also been suggested as an alternative for
a quick response, but has less safety data perinatally.423
Typical antipsychotics are less favoured in general psychi-
atry but haloperidol (available in oral, intramuscular or
intravenous forms) has minimal perinatal risk so it can
be used; loxapine is also a reasonable option but less is
known about its safety perinatally than for haloperidol.424
If there is imminent risk of violence, physical restraint may
be necessary. In this case, special care must be taken with
positioning, especially in the second or third trimesters of
pregnancy, when using 4-point restraints, to avoid com-
pression of the vena cava. Physical restraints should be

used for the shortest amount of time possible, and with
fetal monitoring if available (Level 4

).421

Risk of Suicide

Suicidal thoughts are estimated to occur in as many as 8% of
pregnant people and birthing parents.425 Most people who
experience suicidal thoughts do not attempt suicide, and in
many cases, being pregnant or having a child is a protective
factor against suicide.426 However, although maternal mor-
tality is relatively rare, suicide is a leading cause of death
in the perinatal period according to data from several coun-
tries.427 The highest risk for suicide appears to be during
acute episodes of severe depression, mania/mixed states, psy-
chosis and/or substance or alcohol
intoxication. Inquiry
about suicidal
thoughts should be part of mental health
assessments and follow-up in all individuals with PMADs.
Inquiring about or monitoring suicidal thoughts does not
increase the risk for suicidal thoughts or actions. Some of
the most commonly used standardized clinical questionnaires
(e.g., EPDS, PHQ-9) contain an item focused on suicidal
thoughts, so these can be used to aid in inquiry.

In the absence of perinatal-speciﬁc evidence, it is recom-
mended that the assessment and management of suicide risk
).11
is similar to that in non-perinatal populations (Level 4
Assessment involves asking detailed questions about the
presence, frequency and persistence of suicidal thoughts,
whether there are speciﬁc plans for suicide,
intent, or
means to carry out a plan, and the potential for lethality.
individuals with speciﬁc plans,
For instance,
intent and
means, especially high-lethality means, would be considered
much higher risk than those without these characteristics.
Suicidal thoughts in the context of psychosis or acute intox-
ication would also be high-risk situations. It is important to
always ask speciﬁcally about whether there is intent to end
the life of their foetus or infant.

In the management of suicide risk, optimizing treat-
ment for the underlying PMAD is key. For individuals
at high or imminent risk for suicide, hospitalization is
required (involuntarily if needed). For those not hospital-

partners,
Prevention considerations include removing access to
lethal means (e.g., removal of sharp objects, oversight
of medications due to risk of misuse or overdose,
etc…). Clinicians can work with patients and their
support systems to identify warning signs and create a
list of coping strategies and resources to access if suicidal
thoughts arise (e.g., resources for 24/7 support, such as
crisis lines including 9-8-8 in the U.S. and Canada, and
the closest emergency services). Safety plans should be
revisited in every follow-up appointment and modiﬁed
as needed.

Thoughts of Infant-Related Harm

Thoughts of infant harm are common in the postpartum
period.428 In most cases, thoughts are intrusive and unwanted
and do not represent a safety concern. When care providers
receive a disclosure of thoughts of harming one’s infant,
the thoughts should be fully assessed before referral
to
child protection in case the latter is unnecessary. Recurrent
unwanted intrusive thoughts or
images of harming an
infant on purpose (intentionally) that cause distress to the
mother, with no actual intent or desire to harm the infant
(i.e., “ego-dystonic” thoughts) may be best conceptualized
as obsessional symptoms, with low risk of infant harm.428
These ego-dystonic thoughts are very distressing, and
many patients—especially those who are from population
groups that have a history of experiencing discrimination
in health care—may conceal
them from others due to
shame,
infant will be
that
fear
stigma and/or
removed from their care.429 When inquiring about thoughts
of infant harm, clinicians can provide education about their
occurrence and contextualize risk to reduce barriers to dis-
closure. For example, clinicians can explain that thoughts
about infant-related harm are common, but usually only
dangerous in the context of postpartum psychosis or
suicidality.

their

When the patient expresses intent to harm their infant,
does not appear distressed by thoughts of harming the
infant (i.e., “ego-syntonic” thoughts), or when the thoughts
occur in individuals with psychosis or those at high risk for
suicide, there is a greater risk of infant-related harm.430 For
example, patients suffering from postpartum psychosis
may believe that their infant is inhabited by an evil spirit
or alien and can only be saved from this terrible situation
if the parent kills the infant. A mother with severe depres-
sion and suicidal thoughts may believe their infant would
the
suffer if the mother were to die. In this instance,
patient may genuinely believe it
is better for them to
include their infant in the suicide plans. When any of
these situations are present, the affected mother or birthing
parent should not be left alone with the infant or other chil-
dren, and treatment should be sought emergently (Level 4
). Infant-related harm can also occur spontaneously or
impulsively out of extreme frustration, and clinicians
should always be attentive to signs of possible child
abuse and/or neglect.

Question 10. What Are the
Recommendations for Managing the Mental
Health of Fathers/Co-parents?

Most research on PMADs in the non-birthing parent focuses
on depression in fathers, where the prevalence of clinically
signiﬁcant perinatal depressive symptoms is between 8–
10%.431 Risk factors are similar to those of maternal

instability.55,432 Unemployment

depression, including a history of mental illness and psy-
chosocial stressors such as relationship distress and ﬁnan-
cial
is an independent
risk factor in this group, whereas in the maternal depression
literature this appears to be of less signiﬁcance.55,432 There
is a strong correlation between maternal and paternal
depression, and maternal depression is a strong risk factor
for paternal depression.55,432,433 Anxiety has also been
studied in fathers, with wide-ranging prevalence rates but
an overall estimate for clinically signiﬁcant anxiety symp-
toms of about 11% across the perinatal period.434 There is
some suggestion that rates may increase over the course
of the antenatal period, peaking in the early postpartum
before decreasing thereafter.432 Paternal depression, and
to a lesser extent paternal anxiety, is associated with a
small increased risk for emotional and behavioural prob-
lems in children including after accounting for maternal
mental health.435–437

Less is known about PMADs in non-birthing cisgender
sexual minority (e.g., lesbian, bisexual, queer) or gender
minority (e.g., transgender, non-binary) co-parents. There is
some evidence to suggest a higher prevalence of perinatal
depressive symptoms in these groups.48,438,439 These popula-
tions may encounter speciﬁc challenges during the transition
to parenthood, including navigating heteronormative health-
care systems, minority stress and invisibility.438–440 Little is
known about how factors such as race, ethnicity, culture
and language may impact
these
groups.439 Similarly, little is known about the prevalence of
PMADs other than depression and anxiety in fathers or
co-parents, although theoretically the risks of relapse could
be high at this time for other disorders (including BD),
given the stress of sleep deprivation and other factors in the
transition to parenthood.

the mental health of
Co-parents may be reluctant to disclose mental health con-
cerns due to a lack of knowledge about paternal/partner/
co-parent mental health, fear of being judged, stigma or
prioritizing the birthing parent’s experience as more
important.441 Standardized scales may be used to aid
detection of depression and anxiety. The EPDS, at
cut-off scores ranging from 7–10, has reasonable sensitiv-
ity/speciﬁcity (0.87/0.71 for a cut-off score of 7 to 0.71/
0.86 for a cut-off score of 10) for probable depression in
fathers, so can be used to aid case identiﬁcation (Level 3
), although how well this would generalize to other

co-parents is not known.442

In systematic reviews, no RCTs focused on the treat-
ment of depression in fathers or co-parents were identi-
ﬁed.443

non-clinical populations and were psychoeducational in
nature, focusing on paternal well-being indirectly (i.e.,

via the mother or the child or the couple’s relationship),
with equivocal results. Systematic reviews on perinatal
anxiety in fathers also evaluated mostly psychoeducational
interventions in non-clinical populations.444,445 In some
RCTs evaluating paternal anxiety,
intervention groups
levels of anxiety symptoms post-
had slightly lower
intervention than controls, but whether the interventions
prevented the development of diagnosable PMADs is not
known.444 Data on treatment for sexual and gender minor-
ity co-parents are limited but known barriers to uptake of
care include a lack of targeted mental health services and
supports (including peer support) speciﬁcally for—or sen-
sitive to—the unique experiences of sexual and gender
minority co-parents.438

Discussion and Summary

is our hope that

This CANMAT guideline aims to provide clinicians with
comprehensive and systematic guidance for the management
of PMADs. The development of
recommendations was
complex at times, largely due to the gaps in available literature
regarding the efﬁcacy and safety of various treatments in the
perinatal population overall and in speciﬁc subpopulations.
There are also a lack of head-to-head comparisons within
and across various treatment modalities (e.g., comparison of
therapy and medication, or between types of therapies and
this guideline
types of medications). It
serves to encourage more research in the area. There is a
need for better evidence in particular for conditions where
there is controversy, lower-certainty and for diagnoses where
there is a lack of perinatal-speciﬁc evidence such as OCD,
PTSD and BD, and to a lesser extent anxiety disorders.
Although there has been an attempt to improve the diagnostic
criteria of certain perinatal mental health conditions, such as
the “peripartum onset” speciﬁer of the DSM-5, we encourage
better acknowledgement of the unique perinatal aspects of
other conditions such as anxiety, OCD, psychosis and the lim-
itations inherent in restricting PPD onset to the ﬁrst 4 weeks
after childbirth. There is also a clear need for more research
in speciﬁc sub-populations, including gender-diverse, sexually
diverse and racialized people, and fathers and co-parents. This
dynamic literature requires constant update, and it is our intent
that this ﬁrst CANMAT PMAD guideline can form the basis
for future updates and guidance over time. We also hope
that the current work will serve as a model for the development
of clinical guidelines that can address other mental and beha-
vioural disorders that were outside the scope of this guideline
(e.g., autism, attention-deﬁcit-hyperactivity disorder, eating
disorders, personality disorders, substance and alcohol use dis-
orders and others).
