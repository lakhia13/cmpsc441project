Abstract

Objective: To explore the lived experience of women living with infertility in Ethiopia.

Method:  We  used  interpretative  phenomenologic  analysis  with  open- ended  semi- 

structured questions, focusing on what living with infertility looks like and what that 

means to the women. Participants included women who had experienced infertility 

and were following treatment at St. Paul's Hospital Center for Fertility & Reproductive 

Medicine in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We purposefully recruited 13 women living with 

infertility and used NVivo version 12 software for data analysis.

Results: The study generated six themes: (1) the reason for wanting a child, (2) the 

financial  sacrifice  of  accessing  treatment,  (3)  infertility  and  marriage,  (4)  estrange-

ment  and  ostracization  in  social  life,  (5)  psychological  despair  and  support,  and  (6) 

faith and resilience. Further analysis identified the superordinate themes: the mean-

ing  of  a  child;  lineage  and  continuity  of  life;  togetherness;  marital  discord;  reduced 

social participation; being left out of the world, psychological suffering; support and 

relationship with healthcare providers; helplessness, acceptance, and hope. A child in 

the Ethiopian context has significant meaning for women and the community. Being 

unable to accomplish motherhood brings numerous challenges.

Conclusion: The far- reaching consequences of infertility substantially affect women's 

psychological, financial, sociocultural, and spiritual lives. However, despite the difficult 

journey of infertility, women develop coping mechanisms and resilience. Professional 

psychosocial support is necessary to alleviate the consequences of infertility, yet ac-

cess  to  and  utilization  of  these  services  are  inadequate.  Infertility  needs  to  receive 

better attention in the Ethiopian healthcare system as it has significant implications 

for couples' lives.

This study was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a multi- ethnic 
capital city. Ethiopia had an estimated 120 million people in 2021.29 

Ethiopia's health service is structured into a three- tier system with 

primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care. Addis Ababa has 13

Infertility treatments are costly and often self- funded in Africa, 
where social security systems are lacking.14 In Ethiopia, the elderly

women  to  conceive.7,9  In  Ethiopian  society,  women  with  infertility 

face exclusion from child- centric cultural rituals and struggle to in-
tegrate  into  social  networks,19  leading  to  decreased  health- related 
quality of life.20 Depression is also common with feelings of hope-
lessness, pessimism, and worthlessness,11,21,22 and severe cases may

silience and coping mechanisms, turning negative consequences into 
positive  outcomes.23  Psychological  resilience—adapting  positively 
to adversity24—is linked to post- traumatic growth, achieved through 
social support and positive coping.25 However, access to and utiliza-
tion of these services are inadequate,26 particularly in contexts such 

as Ethiopia. Infertility in Ethiopian society is seen as a tragedy and a 
curse by many,11,27 intensifying the stigma and isolation. Therefore, 

diversifying  criteria,  the  purposeful  sampling  method  helps  to  ob-
tain maximum variation in responses.28 We used information power 
to determine the final number of participants,31 by considering the 

narrow study aim, dense sample specificity, and deep dialogue with 

participants.

We obtained ethical clearance from both Queen's University (HSREB 

[REH- 793- 21])  and  the  University  of  Gondar's  Institutional  Ethical 

Boards. A healthcare provider affiliated with the fertility center who 

had access to the women's medical records first approached poten-

tial participants. The healthcare provider only informed the women 

about  the  study  and  did  not  ask  for  consent  to  avoid  provider  co-

close interaction with transcripts is needed to understand the par-

Becoming a parent is part of your identity. To be a human, you need to 
be a parent first (p1)

I work hard and have money, but who will inherit it? You also want to 
replace yourself (p2)

The cost of the treatment makes us not go further with the treatment. 
Even with the government subsidy, it is hard to pay that much, and 
they need to make it affordable (p5)
To not lose your lineage, your family will give you what they have to 
support you. You will also try it [the treatment] even if you have to 
borrow from others (p2)
We told our families when we couldn't afford the cost. It is only 
because they supported us that we can afford this treatment. It is 
challenging, especially with this economic inflation (p11)

My husband believes it is our problem even though I have the problem. 
The infertility journey has strengthened us and shown us solidarity 
(p10)

If this treatment does not work, we will not continue to live together… I 
know the problem is with me now, so I will not force my husband to be 
with me (p8)

I only go to funerals [and avoid marriages and birth celebrations]. 
When my nephew sees me, his eyes fill with tears, and my family is 
very sad about my condition. Sometimes the words people use makes 
me feel like a hammer has hit me on the head; it's hurtful (p13)

I say that I am like any other woman. But sometimes, when I see a 
pregnant or breastfeeding woman, I tell myself I have all the features a 
woman should have, but why can't I be like them? I always argue with 
myself (p3)

I feel anxious when I think of being unable to give birth; it is tough to 
describe. The doctors couldn't find any issues in my husband or me, so 
I feel stressed about why it [the pregnancy] is not happening (p7)

The healthcare providers could have counseled my husband and me, 
but there is no such thing. They can counsel couples, taking the issue 
as their own and not blaming the other person, how to live together, 
and how to relieve their anxiety (p10)

Being childless hurts more in time [crying]. Previously, I used to think, 
‘Maybe one day I will have a child.’ But now, I will know my fate, so it is 
very tough (p2)

Telling people will not bring anything. Only God can give you a child 
and anything you need. I am only waiting for him (p4)

I used to stay home alone and hated my job [due to the daily challenges 
of infertility] for about two months. But I feel like myself again when I

In conclusion, the far- reaching consequences of infertility affect 

women's  daily  lives  and  have  public  health  implications.  Women's
