---

Signs and symptoms ofADHDin adults can be hard to spot. However, core symptoms start early in life — before age 12 — and continue into adulthood, creating major problems.

No single test can confirm the diagnosis. Making the diagnosis will likely include:

- Physical exam,to help rule out other possible causes for your symptoms

- Information gathering,such as asking you questions about any current medical issues, personal and family medical history, and the history of your symptoms

- ADHDrating scales or psychological teststo help collect and evaluate information about your symptoms


### Other conditions that resembleADHD


Some medical conditions or treatments may cause signs and symptoms similar to those ofADHD. Examples include:

- Mental health disorders,such as depression, anxiety, conduct disorders, learning and language deficits, or other psychiatric disorders

- Medical problems that can affect thinking or behavior,such as a developmental disorder, seizure disorder, thyroid problems, sleep disorders, brain injury or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)

- Drugs and medications,such as alcohol or other substance misuse and certain medications

Standard treatments forADHDin adults typically involve medication, education, skills training and psychological counseling. A combination of these is often the most effective treatment. These treatments can help manage many symptoms ofADHD, but they don't cure it. It may take some time to determine what works best for you.

Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of any medications.

- Stimulants,such as products that include methylphenidate or amphetamine, are typically the most commonly prescribed medications forADHD, but other medications may be prescribed. Stimulants appear to boost and balance levels of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters.

- Other medicationsused to treatADHDinclude the nonstimulant atomoxetine and certain antidepressants such as bupropion. Atomoxetine and antidepressants work slower than stimulants do, but these may be good options if you can't take stimulants because of health problems or if stimulants cause severe side effects.

The right medication and the right dose vary among individuals, so it may take time to find out what's right for you. Tell your doctor about any side effects.


### Psychological counseling


Counseling for adultADHDgenerally includes psychological counseling (psychotherapy), education about the disorder and learning skills to help you be successful.

Psychotherapy may help you:

- Improve your time management and organizational skills

- Learn how to reduce your impulsive behavior

- Develop better problem-solving skills

- Cope with past academic, work or social failures

- Improve your self-esteem

- Learn ways to improve relationships with your family, co-workers and friends

- Develop strategies for controlling your temper

Common types of psychotherapy forADHDinclude:

- Cognitive behavioral therapy.This structured type of counseling teaches specific skills to manage your behavior and change negative thinking patterns into positive ones. It can help you deal with life challenges, such as school, work or relationship problems, and help address other mental health conditions, such as depression or substance misuse.

- Marital counseling and family therapy.This type of therapy can help loved ones cope with the stress of living with someone who hasADHDand learn what they can do to help. Such counseling can improve communication and problem-solving skills.


### Working on relationships


If you're like many adults withADHD, you may be unpredictable and forget appointments, miss deadlines, and make impulsive or irrational decisions. These behaviors can strain the patience of the most forgiving co-worker, friend or partner.

Therapy that focuses on these issues and ways to better monitor your behavior can be very helpful. So can classes to improve communication and develop conflict resolution and problem-solving skills. Couples therapy and classes in which family members learn more aboutADHDmay significantly improve your relationships.

- Break down tasksinto smaller, more manageable steps. Consider using checklists.

- Use sticky padsto write notes to yourself. Put them on the fridge, on the bathroom mirror, in the car or in other places where you'll see the reminders.

- Keep an appointment bookor electronic calendar to track appointments and deadlines.

- Carry a notebook or electronic device with youso that you can note ideas or things you'll need to remember.

- Take time to set up systems to file and organize information,both on your electronic devices and for paper documents. Get in the habit of using these systems consistently.

- Follow a routinethat's consistent from day to day and keep items, such as your keys and your wallet, in the same place.

- Ask for helpfrom family members or other loved ones.


## Alternative medicine


There's little research to indicate that alternative medicine treatments can reduceADHDsymptoms. However, studies indicate that mindfulness meditation may help improve mood and attention in adults who haveADHD, as well as those who don't haveADHD.

Before using alternative interventions forADHD, talk with your doctor about risks and possible benefits.


## Coping and support


While treatment can make a big difference withADHD, taking other steps can help you understandADHDand learn to manage it. Some resources that may help you are listed below. Ask your health care team for more advice on resources.

- Support groups.Support groups allow you to meet other people withADHDso that you can share experiences, information and coping strategies. These groups are available in person in many communities and also online.

- Social support.Involve your spouse, close relatives and friends in yourADHDtreatment. You may feel reluctant to let people know you haveADHD, but letting others know what's going on can help them understand you better and improve your relationships.

- Co-workers, supervisors and teachers.ADHDcan make work and school a challenge. You may feel embarrassed telling your boss or professor that you haveADHD, but most likely he or she will be willing to make small accommodations to help you succeed. Ask for what you need to improve your performance, such as more in-depth explanations or more time on certain tasks.


## Preparing for your appointment


You're likely to start by first talking to your primary care provider. Depending on the results of the initial evaluation, he or she may refer you to a specialist, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist or other mental health professional.

- What kinds of tests do I need?

- What treatments are available and which do you recommend?

- What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?

- I have these other health problems. How can I best manage these conditions together?

- Should I see a specialist such as a psychiatrist or psychologist?

- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?

- What types of side effects can I expect from the medication?

- Are there any printed materials that I can have? What websites do you recommend?

Don't hesitate to ask questions anytime you don't understand something.


### What to expect from your doctor
