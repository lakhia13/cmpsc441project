Abstract: Many people at risk of suicide do not seek help before an attempt, and do not 
remain connected to health services following an attempt. E-health interventions are now 
being  considered  as  a  means  to  identify  at-risk  individuals,  offer  self-help  through  web 
interventions  or  to  deliver  proactive  interventions  in  response  to  individuals’  posts  on 
social  media.  In  this  article,  we  examine  research  studies  which  focus  on  these  three 
aspects of suicide and the internet: the use of online screening for suicide, the effectiveness 
of e-health interventions aimed to manage suicidal thoughts, and newer studies which aim 
to  proactively  intervene  when  individuals  at  risk  of  suicide  are  identified  by  their  social 
media  postings.  We  conclude  that  online  screening  may  have  a  role,  although  there  is  a 
need  for  additional  robust  controlled  research  to  establish  whether  suicide  screening  
can  effectively  reduce  suicide-related  outcomes,  and  in  what  settings  online  screening 
might  be  most  effective.  The  effectiveness  of  Internet  interventions  may  be  increased  if  
these  interventions  are  designed  to  specifically  target  suicidal  thoughts,  rather  than 
associated conditions such as depression. The evidence for the use of intervention practices 
using  social  media  is  possible,  although  validity,  feasibility  and  implementation  remains 
highly uncertain.

1. Introduction 

E-health interventions for suicide prevention can be classed into three categories. First, the Internet 
can be used to help individuals self-screen: to identify whether they might be at risk for suicide or a 
mental  health  problem.  Through  screening  and  feedback,  it  may  be  possible  to  increase  service  
use,  by  directing  at-risk  individuals  who  would  not  otherwise  seek  help  to  access  appropriate  
evidence-based  online  programs  or  to  access  traditional  mental  health  services  [1].  Second,  web 
applications, both guided and unguided, have been developed to provide psychological interventions to 
assist  in  reducing  suicidal  behaviour  and  lowering  suicidal  ideation.  Guided  interventions  involve  a 
therapist  or  a  researcher  assisting  the  user  through  the  program  either  through  email  or  over  the 
telephone,  whereas  unguided  are  self-help,  automated  programs  which  can  be  initiated  and  used 
directly by the public. The third type of intervention is one where a person is considered to be at risk of 
suicide  because  of  the  nature  of  their  social  media  use.  Here,  tweets,  status  updates,  comments  
or posts indicative of suicide ideation are used to classify those at risk. Such content can be identified 
in  real-time  by  other  users  or  by  computerised  language  processing  and  progress  in  this  area  
has accelerated. The aims of the present paper are to review the evidence around these three styles of 
intervention.  Three  separate  literature  reviews  were  conducted.  The  first  examined  the  evidence  for 
whether online screening for suicide might be effective in reducing suicidal ideation and behaviours. 
The  second  reviewed  web  interventions,  updating  two  recent  reviews  of  web  based  suicide  
prevention  [2,3]  and  distinguishing  two  approaches:  web  interventions  that  target  suicidal  behaviour 
and using depression therapies; and interventions that target suicidal behaviour using suicide-specific 
therapies. The final review examined the use of social media platforms for identifying those who may 
be at risk of suicide. 

2. Methods 

Comprehensive  literature  searches  for  all  three  reviews  were  conducted  in  March  2014  using  the 
Medline, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Library databases. Conference abstracts, non-peer reviewed papers, 
non-English language papers, and PhD theses were excluded from all three reviews. All articles were 
screened for eligibility by two independent researchers. The specifics of each search are outlined below. 

2.1. Identifying Screening Programs 

Search  terms  indicative  of  internet  technology  (computer  or  computer-based  or  cyber  or 
cyberspace or electronic or “electronic mail” or email or e-mail or internet or internet-based or net or 
online or virtual or web or web-based or web-based or “world wide web” or www or “social media” 
or  “social  network”  or  blog  or  forum),  screening  (screen*  or  assess*)  and  suicide  (suicid*)  were 
employed.  The  search  resulted  in  855  articles,  of  which  98  were  excluded  due  to  being  in  a  
non-English language or animal-based and a further 162 were excluded as duplicates. The remaining 
595 abstracts were screened for relevance, with 78 papers identified as potentially meeting the criterion 

 
 
 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 

8195 

of  reporting  on  the  screening  of  individuals  for  suicidal  ideation  or  behaviours  using  the  internet.  
Full-text copies of these papers were then obtained for further scrutiny and reference checks conducted 
to  identify  papers  that  may  have  been  missed  in  the  search.  After  examining  the  full  text  of  these 
articles, 47 did not meet the criteria of the screening review. Hierarchical reasons for exclusion were 
not being a peer-reviewed paper (11 papers), not using online data collection (20 papers), not including 
a measure of the respondent’s suicidality (eight papers), not reporting on suicidality outcomes (seven 
papers), or being a review paper (one paper). One additional relevant paper was identified in reference 
checking, resulting in 32 papers from 30 studies that reported on online assessment of suicidal ideation 
or behaviours. 

2.2. Identifying Web Programs 

In addition to the databases stated above, the Centre for Research Excellence of Suicide Prevention 
(CRESP)  Suicide  Prevention  Database  (http://cresp.edu.au/databases/sprct)  was  also  used  for  this 
review. Search terms indicative of suicide, self-harm and mobile or online applications were employed: 
“Self  harm  OR  self-harm  OR  deliberate  self-harm  OR  deliberate  self  poisoning  OR  self  cutting  OR  
self-inflicted wounds OR deliberate self cutting OR suicid* OR suicide gesture OR suicidal behavio* 
OR  suicidal  ideation  OR  suicide  attempt  OR  self-mutilation  OR  auto-mutilation  OR  auto  mutilation 
OR  self-injury  OR  self-injurious  behavio*  OR  self  destructive  behavio*  OR  self-poisoning  and 
overdose OR drug overdose” in Title, Abstract, Keywords and “trials OR randomised controlled trials 
OR  randomized  controlled  trials  OR  meta-analysis”  in  Title,  Abstract,  Keywords  and  “internet  OR 
mobile OR web OR email OR e-mail OR online” in Title, Abstract, Keywords. 

The search yielded a total of 198 abstracts which was reduced to 109 after the removal of duplicates. 
Of these, nine papers met inclusion criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in order to 
identify any internet or mobile-based interventions that included a measure of suicidal behaviour. The 
trials did not need to explicitly target those experiencing suicidal behaviours, but they were required to 
measure  participants’  level  of  suicidality  prior  to  program  commencement  and  following  program 
completion. Studies examining non-suicidal self-injury were not included. Due to the low numbers of 
trials,  studies  without  control  or  comparison  groups  were  included  in  addition  to  trials  including 
control groups. The control group could consist of a wait-list, treatment-as-usual, or another treatment. 
There was no restriction on participant age.  

Studies were excluded if they did not include an intervention, if suicidality was not measured as a 
primary or secondary outcome, and if the intervention was not internet or mobile based. One paper was 
excluded as the research design and sample was identical to another paper written by the same authors. 
Further,  the  study  led  by  Merry  [4]  employed  the  Kazdin  Hopelessness  Scale  in  place  of  a  suicidal 
behaviour  measure.  Considering  this  scale  is  widely  used  as  a  proxy  for  suicidal  ideation,  the  study 
was included.  

Two of the studies in the review are not  discussed further. These are: Marasinghe, et al. [5]; and 
Wagner, et al. [6]. The first was eliminated because it did not involve a web component. The second 
because  it  was  difficult  to  discern  the  type  of  therapy,  and  the  extent  to  which  the  intervention  was 
delivered online (it was not clear whether both groups received a paper and pencil manual).

2.3. Identifying Social Media Interventions 

Search terms indicative of suicide, self-harm and social media were employed: suicid* OR suicide 
gesture OR suicidal behavio* OR suicidal idea* OR suicide attempt OR self-mutilation OR self harm 
OR self-harm OR deliberate self-harm OR deliberate self poisoning OR self cutting OR self-inflicted 
wound  OR  deliberate  self  cutting  AND  social  media  OR  internet  OR  web  OR  online  OR  blog*  OR 
online social network* OR website OR twitter OR Myspace OR Facebook OR social networking site* 
OR  bebo  OR  tweet*  OR  status  update  OR  post*AND  screen*  OR  assess  OR  prevent*  OR  track*. 
Using Kaplan and Haenlein’s [7] classification of social media, the current review focused explicitly 
on  blogs/microblogs  (e.g.,  Twitter),  and  social  networking  sites  (e.g.,  Facebook,  Myspace,  Bebo). 
Content  communities  (e.g.,  YouTube),  virtual  worlds  (e.g.,  Second  life),  MMORGs  (e.g.,  World  
of  Warcraft)  and  collaborative  projects  (e.g.,  Pinterest)  were  excluded.  Articles  that  related  to  online 
discussion forums, online support groups or internet message boards were also excluded. The search 
yielded  1934  following  number  of  articles.  Of  these,  only  13  papers  met  inclusion  criteria.  
Papers published prior to 2000 (the onset of social media) were excluded alongside those that focused 
on  non-suicidal  self-injury,  murder-suicides  or  mental  illnesses  such  as  depression,  which  may 
increase the risk of suicide. A search for similar articles was conducted on all relevant papers; however, 
this  returned  zero  results.  Citation  lists  for  each  included  article  was  also  screened  for  other  related 
papers  which  yielded  an  additional  three  papers.  The  article  titled  “Mining  Twitter  for  Suicide 
Prevention” [8] is not discussed further as the publication source could not be identified. A total of 15 
papers were included. 

3. Results 

3.1. Online Screening for Suicide Ideation 

Of the 32 papers that met inclusion criteria, only six (19%) had direct relevance to online screening 
programs. The details of these papers are provided in Table 1. Of the remaining papers not detailed in 
the table, 23 (72%) focused on assessing risk factors or prevalence of suicidal ideation or behaviours 
using  cross-sectional  web  surveys,  while  one  paper  reported  on  the  cost-effectiveness  of  an  online 
suicide  prevention  trial,  one  paper  reported  on  the  psychometric  properties  of  an  online  behavioural 
health  measure  and  another  reported  on  a  cross-sectional  survey  assessing  reasons  why  people  seek 
help for suicide online. All of the six papers on screening were based on studies from the United States. 
Five of the papers focused on young people, including four on university students and/or staff. Sample 
sizes ranged from 374–13155 (M: 2916, Median: 1010) and 45% of all participants were female. Most 
studies  used  the  PHQ-9  [9]  to  assess  suicidal  ideation,  usually  in  association  with  a  lifetime  suicide 
attempt  item.  The  remainder  used  binary  prevalence  measures  (i.e.,  presence/absence  of  suicidal 
ideation, suicide plan, or suicide attempt). 

Three of the papers [10–12] reported on the use of an online screening program developed by the 
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in the university setting. Overall, these studies reported 
that  online  screening  was  effective  for  identifying  students  with  history  of  suicidal  ideation  or 
behaviours.  The  direct  referral  of  at-risk  students  to  in-person  services,  such  as  campus  counsellors, 
was  also  found  to  be  effective,  although  only  a  minority  (ranging  approximately  10%–20%)  of  

 
 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 

8197 

at-risk  students  agreed  to  service  referral  and  fewer  received  services.  Another  study  [13]  examined  
web-based  screening  among  adolescents  presenting  at  the  emergency  department  of  a  children’s 
hospital,  finding  that  65%  of  adolescents  agreed  to  screening,  resulting  in  a  70%  increase  in 
identification  of  psychiatric  problems  and  a  47%  increase  in  assessments  by  a  social  worker  or 
psychiatrist.  Lawrence,  et  al.  [14]  tested  the  feasibility  of  using  the  PHQ-9  within  a  web-based 
screener administered in outpatient clinics to screen for depression and suicidality among people with 
HIV. In this program, 14% reported some level of suicidal ideation and 3% were deemed high-risk and 
referred to services. Critically though, none of the identified studies included a control (non-screened) 
group  for  comparison,  so  they  were  unable  to  assess  whether  screening  and  referral  alone  was 
sufficient to increase help seeking or to improve mental health outcomes.

One additional study examined the acceptability and risk of online screening for suicidal ideation 
and  behaviours,  also  among  university  students  [15].  This  study  concluded  that  such  screening  was 
generally  acceptable,  with  few  individuals  (<3%)  reporting  negative  experiences  as  a  result  of  the 
screening.  Individuals  with  previous  suicidality  had  greater  discomfort  with  the  survey  but  such 
individuals also found it more thought-provoking than those without previous suicidality [15]. 

3.2. Web Applications for Suicide Prevention 

Outlined in Table 2, six studies examined suicide outcomes arising from the use of a web intervention 
which targeted depression. Of these, two studies used adolescent samples. A pre-post study (n = 83) of 
general practice adolescent patients with suicidal ideation (but  not frequent ideation or actual intent) 
found reductions in self-harm thoughts and depressive symptoms at 6 weeks and 12 weeks using the 

 
 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 

8198 

“PROJECT CATCH-IT” web program (CBT, IPT and parent workbook) [16]. A non-inferiority RCT 
(n  =  94)  of  psychiatric  outpatients  with  depression  compared  a  computerised  self-help  program 
“SPARX” (CBT) with TAU (face to face therapy) and found that SPARX was non-inferior on levels 
of hopelessness (a proxy measure of suicide ideation) [4]. Four studies targeted adults. Two Australian 
studies examined changes in suicide ideation using a pre-post design. In the first, 299 general practice 
patients with suicidal ideation undertook an internet intervention for depression (CBT, homework and 
clinician  contact)  and  the  researchers  found  a  reduction  in  suicidal  ideation  [17].  A  pre-post  study  
(n = 359) of depressed or suicidal general practice patients, evaluated the “Sadness Program” (internet 
based  CBT,  homework,  supplementary  resources)  and  found  reduction  in  suicidal  ideation  [18].  
A third study (n = 105)  of  depressed patients with suicidal thoughts employed a  RCT  methodology. 
The  researchers  compared  “Deprexis”  (online  CBT  for  depression)  with  wait  list  controls  and  found 
decreased scores on depression, dysfunctional attitudes and improved quality of life, but no difference 
on either suicidal thoughts and behaviour [19]. A second RCT (four arms) (n = 155) of depressed callers 
to  Lifeline  compared  web-based  CBT,  web-based  CBT  plus  telephone  call,  telephone  call  back  
line  and  TAU  found  no  differences  in  the  rate  at  which  suicidal  thoughts  dissipated  between  the  
four conditions [20]. 

Taken together these findings from both the adult and the adolescent studies show that suicide ideation 
drops  over  time  in  response  to  internet  interventions  (the  Deprexis  results  is  the  only  anomaly).  The  
two RCT trials [19,20] also demonstrate that depression websites have specific effects on depression 
symptoms above those of the control conditions. However, the studies were not able to establish that 
suicide ideation falls as a function of the depression CBT provided by the interventions. In other words, 
suicide ideation seems to drop in both  depression and control conditions. These findings do not rule 
out the possibility that websites which target specific characteristics of suicidal thoughts and behaviour 
such  as  rumination  disruption  or  mindfulness  may  be  more  effective  than  either  depression 
interventions or the “passage of time”. There is only one RCT that has been published which focuses 
on  a  specific  intervention  for  suicidal  thoughts.  This  study,  compared  an  online  self-help  program  
(6  modules  of  CBT  with  DBT,  PST,  MBCT  as  well  as  weekly  assignments  and  automated 
motivational emails) with a waitlist control group and found reductions in suicidal thoughts and levels 
of hopelessness in favour of the self-help program [21] and improved cost effectiveness [22]. 

3.3. Social Media for Suicide Prevention 

Table 3 outlines the relevant papers and associated findings. Of the 15 articles identified, six were 
classified  as  case  studies  examining  either  one  individual’s  social  media  use  (n  =  5),  or,  the  social 
media use of a single organisation (n = 1). In the single organisation case study, Boyce [23] described 
the social media use of a suicide prevention agency (“Samaritans”) in the United States (U.S.). This 
case study provided brief recommendations for the future but did not include any data in regards to the 
reach,  impact  or  effectiveness  of  such  social  media  use.  The  remaining  five  individual  case  studies 
focused  on  young  males  aged  between  13–29  years  living  in  either  China  or  the  U.S.,  or  location 
undisclosed. In 2011, Ruder and colleagues [24] presented commentary on a case involving a suicide 
note  posted  on  Facebook  by  a  28  year  old  male  who  died  by  suicide.  No  data  or  social  network 
analysis  was  conducted.  Lehavot,  Ben-Zeev  and  Neville  [25]  outlined  the  ethical  considerations 

 
 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 

8199 

involved  with  a  therapist  using  Facebook  as  a  monitoring  tool  for  postings  of  suicidal  imagery  in  a 
male patient. No data or social network analysis was conducted. Ahuja, et al. [26] briefly discussed the 
suicidal  postings  of  a  male  in  his  late  twenties  with  a  history  of  mental  illness  and  the  potential  for 
offline social network intervention. No data or social network analysis was conducted. Using sentiment 
analysis software, Fu, Cheng, Wong and Yip [27] examined the reactions and patterns of information 
diffusion to a self-harm post made by a male using the Chinese social networking site “Sina Weibo”. 
Li, Chau, and Wong [28] examined the relationship between blog posting intensity and language use to 
explore the suicidal processes of a 13 year old male. The specific blog site was not identified. 

Four  of  the  overall  papers,  including  one  brief  correspondence,  were  non-systematic  literature 
reviews discussing the use of social media for suicide prevention. Two of these reviews, published by 
Luxton and colleagues [29,30] described the social media platforms currently being used, or those with 
potential, for suicide prevention. The most recent review by Luxton, June and Fairall [29] found a total 
of  580  Twitter  groups  and  385  blog  profiles  on  blogger.com  designated  to  suicide  prevention,  one 
social  networking  site  designed  for  social  media  prevention  in  the  US  (lifeline-gallery.org),  and 
discussed  the  application  of  internal  functions  that  could  act  as  alert  systems  for  potential  suicide 
behavior. Luxton, et al. [29] also discussed the presence of suicide notes on social media, but did not 
refer  to  any  data  or  particular  studies.  The  third  review  [31]  outlined  the  potential  benefits  and 
complications of social networking sites as a therapeutic intervention for self-injury but did not include 
any data or references to a specific platform. The brief correspondence [32] presented policy initiatives 
and internal functions of social media that could be adopted for suicide prevention. 

Only five papers specifically examined the utilisation of social media for the tracking of suicide risk. 
These studies focused on either Twitter (n = 1), Myspace (n = 2), Facebook (n = 1) or other blog site (n 
= 1, Naver blog, Korea). The studies focusing on Myspace included self-reported adolescent samples 
with  ages  ranging  between  13–24  years.  Age  range  of  participants  in  the  other  papers  could  not  be 
determined.  To  our  knowledge,  the  first  study  published  in  this  area  was  an  exploration  of  public 
Myspace blogs of New Zealand youth using automated sentiment analysis [33]. Cash and colleagues [34] 
further explored the content of suicidal statements made on the public Myspace profiles of adolescents 
aged between 13–24 years old. Using Twitter, Jashinsky, et al. [35] identified a significant association 
between  suicide  risk  factors  within  Twitter  and  geographic  specific  suicide  rates  in  the  US.  Using 
automated  sentiment  analysis  software,  Won,  Myung,  Song,  Lee,  et  al.  [36]  examined  whether  two 
blog  sentiments  (suicide-related  and  dysphoria-related)  along  with  traditional  social,  economic  and 
meteorological variables significantly predicted suicide rates in Korea over a three year period (2008–
2010). The final study [37] was a thematic content analysis of the portrayal of suicide and self-harm 
within a Facebook group in April 2009. Computerised sentiment analysis was not used.

Responses were classified as caring (37%), negative (23%), 

shocked (20%) or unemotional reposts (20%). Significant clustering 

was identified in the repost network in which the speed of diffusion 

was faster when compared to the random network. 

The ratio of positive to negative emotion words was associated with 

greater posting trend. There was greater use of negative emotion 

over time. Progressive self-referencing appeared to be a predictive 

sign of suicide, although, the comparison did not show other clearly 

consistent patterns.

suicidality as well as preventative methods when individuals

Social media has the potential to be used for suicide prevention within 

a public health framework although more research is needed on the 

degree and extent of the influence of social media for such purposes. 

Suggested that social networking sites could help prevent suicides 

by deleting pro-suicide groups re and automatically delivering 

private messages to those at risk. 

Overall, 3.7% and 5% of active bloggers were potentially suicidal: 

35% were identified as positive hits. 638 users out of the 4273 

received a score of 1 or higher indicating that at least one match 

was found with the dictionary phrases. Using the exact phrases,  

612 bloggers received a score of 1 or higher. Although the ability 

to definitively identify bloggers with suicidal tendencies is limited, 

the study demonstrates that computerised data mining can be used 

to identify users at potential risk. 

Themes identified: normalization, nihilism, glorification, ‘us vs. 

them’, acceptance, reason, mockery. Facebook groups were found 

to encourage and promote positive perceptions of suicidal 

behavior.

4. Discussion 

To  date,  there  exists  no  controlled  study  testing  whether  online  suicide  screening  can  effectively 
increase levels of help seeking or reduce suicidal ideation or behaviours. Online screening for suicidal 
thoughts  and  behaviours  appears  to  be  acceptable  among  young  people  [15],  supporting  previous 
findings from a randomised controlled trial that screening for suicide risk using paper surveys does not 
increase  the  risk  of  suicidal  thoughts  or  behaviours  [38,39].  Although  there  is  some  evidence  that 
screening  is  a  feasible  way  to  increase  identification  of  suicidality  and  increase  service  referrals, 
research  of  online  screening  programs  has  not  rigorously  evaluated  whether  screening  programs  are 
effective compared to not screening. Furthermore, most of the programs reported in the literature have 
been conducted in selective populations, specifically, among university students in the United States. 
There  is  some  evidence  from  paper-and-pencil  assessments  that  suicide  screening  programs  can  be 
effective  in  specific  settings  with  the  availability  of  appropriate  referral  sources,  with  most  of  this 
research also conducted among young people (e.g., [40,41]). However, there is a need for additional 
robust controlled research to establish whether suicide screening can effectively reduce suicide-related 
outcomes, and in what settings screening might be effective [42–44]. None of the identified studies had 
a control condition, so they were unable to robustly assess whether online screening directly increased 
help seeking or led to improved mental health outcomes. This evidence gap appears to be especially 
conspicuous for online screening. 

With respect to online suicide prevention programs, there is some evidence to suggest that suicide 
interventions via the web may be effective, but only if they specifically target suicidal content, rather 
than  the  associated  symptoms  of  depression  through  CBT.  There  is  no  evidence  CBT  web-based 
programs  do  harm,  so  excluding  those  with  suicide  ideation  from  participation  does  not  seem 
warranted  for  online  programs  in  general.  Further  research  targeting  specific  suicidal  content  on  the 
web is warranted. 

Although limited, there is evidence to suggest that social media platforms can be used to identify 
individuals  or  geographical  areas  at  risk  of  suicide.  The  few  studies  conducted  in  this  area  have 
demonstrated  that  it  is  possible  to  use  computerised  sentiment  analysis  and  data  mining  to  identify 
users at risk of suicide; however, these studies have been conducted in publically available networks. 
Little is known about private online social networks such as those within Facebook. Furthermore, the 
prevalence and response rate of suicide notes posted on social media is yet to be clearly understood. 
The  repost  networks  within  social  media  may  be  a  potential  preventative  method  that  could  be 
activated quickly for effective intervention in emergency situations; although, current methodologies 
cannot fully disentangle whether suicidal postings always receive a response and if so, the nature of 
such responses. It is unknown if sharing thoughts and feelings this way is beneficial to an individual or 
whether  they  are  placed  at  further  risk.  While  evidence  suggests  that  social  media  may  be  a  viable  
tool  for  real-time  monitoring  of  suicide  risk  on  a  large  scale,  future  studies  are  needed  to  further 
validate this method, in addition to determining the underlying mechanisms for providing support via 
these channels.

5. Conclusions 

This  review  highlights  that  there  is  currently  limited  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  e-health 
interventions for suicide prevention. Whilst feasible, the reliability and preventative capacity of online 
screening  for  suicidality  is  yet  to  be  clearly  determined.  Research  in  this  area  is  incomplete. 
Furthermore, online therapeutic interventions do not appear to be effective unless content is targeted to 
suicidal  thoughts  and  behavior;  however,  addressing  risk  factors,  such  as  depression,  through  online 
CBT  does  not  appear  to  cause  harm.  Lastly,  social  media  shows  significant  potential  for  identifying 
those at risk of suicide in addition to mapping suicide contagion, although further validation research 
in this area is also needed.
