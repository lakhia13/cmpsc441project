The role of prediction in suicide prevention
Matthew Michael Large, BSc, MBBS, FRANZCP, DMedSci

Introduction

  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  has 

called on nations to make suicide prevention a “global 
imperative.”1  It  recommends  that  suicide  prevention 
should be achieved by the systematic consideration of 
“risk and protective factors and related interventions.”1 
Specifically,  the WHO  advocates  that  universal  strate-
gies  should  target  whole  populations,  selective  strate-
gies  should  target  higher-risk  groups,  and  indicated 
strategies should protect individuals at risk. This review 
explores  the  prediction  of  suicide  and  commensurate 
preventative measures, while defining prediction as any 
method that can identify groups or individuals at an in-
creased probability of suicide.

In  order  to  take  an  evidence-based  approach  to 
acting on the global imperative to reduce suicide, it is 
important to have a clear understanding of the risks of 
suicide  according  to  methods  of  prediction  and  what 
commensurate  preventative  measures  might  be.  This 
paper will examine plausible opportunities for preven-
tion afforded by suicide predictions based on interna-
tional suicide rates, demographic factors within nations, 
mental disorders, and the setting of mental health care, 
before considering more traditional notions of a suicide 
risk assessment (for examples see Table I). To this end, 

It is widely believed that suicide prevention involves the 
consideration of risk and protective factors and related 
interventions.  Preventative  interventions  can  be  classi-
fied as “universal” (targeting whole populations), “se-
lective” (targeting higher-risk groups), and “indicated” 
(protecting individuals). This review explores the range 
of preventative measures that might be used commen-
surately with different types of suicide prediction. The 
author  concludes  that  the  best  prospects  for  suicide 
prevention lie in universal prevention strategies. While 
risk  assessments  do  generate  some  information  about 
future  suicide,  suicide  risk  categorization  results  in  an 
unacceptably  high  false  positive  rate,  misses  many  fa-
talities, and therefore, is unable to usefully guide pre-
vention  strategies.  The  assessment  of  suicidal  patients 
should  focus  on  contemporaneous  factors  and  the 
needs of the patient, rather than probabilistic notions 
of suicide risk.

the strength of the suicide predictions is considered us-
ing the statistical metrics of sensitivity (the proportion 
of  all  suicide  cases  included  in  the  higher-risk  group), 
discrimination (effect size distinguishing the probabil-
ity of suicide in higher and lower suicide risk groups), 
and  the  positive  predictive  value  (the  probability  that 
patient in a higher-risk group will die by suicide). Only 
once these metrics have been established can the ques-
tion  be  asked–exactly  what  type  and  how  much  pre-
vention is suitable in light of a suicide prediction? For 
example a burdensome or inconvenient targeted inter-
vention, even if highly effective against suicide, can only 
be commensurate with a prediction that carries a high 
positive predictive value, such that only few people will 
suffer unwarranted consequences. Similarly, a selective 
intervention  that  advantages  a  higher-risk  group  can 
only be commensurate with a degree of discrimination 
between lower-risk and higher-risk groups if it does not 
unfairly disadvantage the lower-risk group that miss out 
on the intervention.

Prediction and prevention at a national level

Worldwide in 2015, about 788 000 people died by sui-
cide at a global rate of 10.7 per 100 000 person-years (or 
about 1 in 9 350 people per annum).2 That year, national 
suicide rates were lowest in the small Caribbean nations 
of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Grenada, each 

of which had suicide rates below 1 per 100 000 person 
years among populations of fewer than a quarter of a 
million. However, in 2015, suicide rates also varied re-
markably between populous nations, ranging from 1.4 
per 100 000 person years in Jamaica to 34.6 per 100 000 
person-years  in  Sri  Lanka  (Table  II).2  While  some  of 
this international variation might be a result of differ-
ences in the definition suicide or methods of data col-
lection, there is little doubt that there are large and real 
differences  in  national  suicide  rates.  Decades  of  work 
standardizing the reporting of suicide has not resulted 
in converging rates, and national suicide rates are nota-
bly stable on a year-to-year basis.3
  Hence,  suicide  rates  between  nations  can  vary  by 
more  than  an  order  of  magnitude.  This  suggests  that 
some  preventative  measures  might  be  justified  in  na-
tions  that  have  a  higher  suicide  rate,  but  not  in  lower 
suicide rate nations. For example, although two nations 
might have similar problems with agricultural pests, the 
overall  benefit  of  restricting  access  to  toxic  pesticides 
might clear in high suicide rate countries like Sri Lanka 
(where 1 in 2900 die by suicide each year) but might be 
less obvious in low suicide rate countries like Jamaica 
(where as few as 1 in 74 500 die by suicide each year). 
  The reasons for the marked heterogeneity in inter-
national  suicide  rates  are  not  fully  understood.  One 
important observation is that national suicide rates by 
particular  lethal  methods  (such  as  hanging,  poisoning,

gassing, shooting, jumping, and drowning) vary greatly 
between  nations4  but  tend  to  be  stable  within  nations 
on a year-to-year basis.3 This predictability of method-
specific  suicide  rates  underpins  most  universal  mea-
sures to prevent suicide. Well-known examples include

Kingdom  in  the  1960s,5  the  regulation  of  firearms  in

of  these  universal  measures  resulted  in  reductions  in

the  reduction  in  analgesic  pack  size,8  the  substitution 
of  barbiturates  with  benzodiazepines,9  the  placement 
of barriers at jumping hotspots,10 measures to decrease 
alcohol consumption,11 and changes to media reporting 
of  suicides.12  In  each  of  these  cases  (with  the  slightly 
contentious  exception  of  the  regulations  in  firearms) 
suicides rates have been reduced at little or no cost or 
inconvenience to the whole population. 

Some potential universal prevention strategies come 
at  a  greater  cost.  Examples  include,  better  access  to 
health care13 and measures to reduce unemployment.14 
Other universal, potentially important measures might 
be inexpensive but hard to achieve, for example reduc-
ing  suicide  by  reducing  the  stigma  associated  with  ac-
cessing mental health care.15 
  Despite the challenges faced by nations with a high 
suicide rate, universal measures hold the best hope for 
global suicide prevention. To illustrate, if global suicide 
rates  were  similar  to  those  of  Jamaica,  Indonesia,  or 
Pakistan, suicide would fall from its current place in the 
top 20 causes of death to about the hundredth cause of 
global death.16

Prediction and prevention according to 
demography

In  addition  to  heterogeneity  in  suicide  rates  between 
nations, major differences in suicide rates can be found 
according to demographic characteristics within nation-
al  populations.  Selective  prevention  strategies  based 
on the higher suicide risk of a demographic group are 
based on the assumption that any inconvenience caused 
by a prevention strategy can be borne by all members 
of the risk group and that its benefits should be denied 
those outside the group. While this may seem common 
sense, it can lead to perverse outcomes.
  Consider the example of the male sex. Being a man 
is  undoubtedly  the  most  prevalent  global  risk  factor 
for  suicide. Worldwide,  more  than  twice  as  many  men 
than women suicide, and in high-income countries rates 
of male suicide are often three times female rates.1 In 
many countries, the male sex can be considered to have 
a  sensitivity  for  suicide  of  about  70%  (because  70% 
of all suicide victims are male) and male sex discrimi-
nates  for  future  suicide  with  much  the  same  or  great-
er  effect  size  as  suicidal  thoughts  and  behaviors  (that 
typically  confer  an  increased  odds  over  those  without 
suicidal  thoughts  and  behaviors  of  about  two).17  Al-

 
2 0 t h   a n n i v e r s a r y   i s s u e

though the positive predictive value of suicide accord-
ing the higher-risk category of being male is very low, 
a  dramatic  fall  in  global  suicide  would  be  achieved  if 
men  could  somehow  be  coaxed  into  becoming  more 
like  women  with  respect  to  behaviors  that  are  associ-
ated with suicide. Hypothetically, reducing men’s access 
to high-lethality methods of suicide and reducing their 
alcohol consumption would be likely to reduce suicide 
significantly.18 While there may be excellent reasons to 
place  gender-based  restrictions  on  the  possession  of 
firearms  and  alcohol  consumption,  in  reality,  any  at-
tempt to do so would be judged to excessively burden 
the vast majority of men who like to drink or shoot and 
will never die by suicide. 

Similar arguments can be made about a wide range 
of  at-risk  societal  groups,  including  of  older  people,19 
sexual  minorities,20  indigenous  populations,21  and  the 
recently  unemployed.22  In  each  of  these  examples 
there is an association between group membership and 
suicide  but  a  low  absolute  suicide  risk,  meaning  that 
commensurate  preventative  interventions  have  to  be 
unobtrusive  and  benign.  Perhaps  the  most  important 
measures  to  reduce  suicide  among  particular  demo-
graphic groups would be to reduce the stigma of mental 
disorder  in  higher-risk  groups23  and  increase  their  ac-
cess to health care24 but again, it would be hard to argue 
that reduction in stigma and better access to health care 
are not broader societal goals and therefore should be 
universal, rather than selective, strategies. 

Prediction and prevention according to 
mental disorder

Almost all mental disorders are associated with an in-
crease  in  the  risk  of  suicide  and  mental  disorder  is  a 
plausible predictor of suicide. It has been estimated that 
as  many  as  90%  of  suicides  in  high-income  countries 
are by people with mental disorder, suggesting that psy-
chiatric diagnosis has a sensitivity for suicide of 90%.25 
Mental disorder is also quite a strong discriminator of 
suicide  risk.  One  meta-analysis  found  that  compared 
to the general population, those with major depression 
have  a  twenty-fold  risk  of  suicide,  while  there  is  a  fif-
teen-fold for bipolar disorder, eight-fold for schizophre-
nia and seven-fold for personality disorders.26 The posi-
tive predictive value associated with lifetime suicide in 
mental disorder is far from trivial, estimated to be over 
5% for schizophrenia,27 4% for those hospitalized with 

affective disorders, and over 2% for never hospitalized 
people with an affective disorder.28 
  The strength of the association between mental dis-
order and suicide suggests that the treatment of mental 
disorder might be an efficacious way of preventing sui-
cide. However, the view that suicide can be prevented 
simply by the treatment of mental disorder is both over-
ly simplistic and overly optimistic.  

Sadly,  the  evidence  for  the  suicide  preventing 
properties  of  psychological  therapies29  and  medical 
psychiatric  treatment30  is  less  strong  than  might  be 
generally believed. Recent meta-analyses of the mor-
tality in trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants 
have failed to demonstrate a protective effect against 
suicide.31,32  Similarly  there  is  little  evidence  for  the 
suicide-reducing  effects  of  antipsychotics33  or  elec-
troconvulsive  therapy.34  There  is  some  evidence  that 
clozapine  can  reduce  suicide  risk  in  schizophrenia35 
and  that  lithium  is  protective  against  suicide  in  ma-
jor mood disorders,36 but it is doubtful whether suicide 
prevention  afforded  by  these  treatments  alone  can 
justify their serious side effects. This is not to say that 
antidepressants,  antipsychotics,  and  mood  stabilizers 
should not be prescribed for suicidal patients—but the 
benefits of a medication and its effectiveness in suicide 
prevention  are  not  always  closely  related. The  symp-
toms  of  depression,  schizophrenia,  and  bipolar  disor-
ders  are  often  well-controlled  by  these  medications 
and their prescription is easily justified, irrespective of 
any perception of suicide risk. Moreover, some treat-
ments  for  mental  disorder  are  used  ethically  even  if 
they increase the risk of suicide. Benzodiazepines are 
an  evidence-based  treatment  for  alcohol  withdrawal 
and some anxiety states but are associated with an in-
creased suicide risk, likely because of their disinhibit-
ing effects and toxicity in overdose.37 

Prediction and prevention according to levels 
of psychiatric care

The higher levels of psychiatric care provided in emer-
gency  departments  and  by  psychiatric  hospitalization 
have recently emerged as important suicide risk factors 
that offer plausible opportunities suicide prevention.38,39 
In the modern era of psychiatric deinstitutionalization 
suicide  rates  among  currently  psychiatrically  hospital-
ized people are typically about 50 times community sui-
cide  rates,40  rising  to  an  astonishing  100-fold  risk  dur-

200

ing the 3 months after discharge.41 This suggests that a 
current or recent psychiatric admission is the strongest 
known  discriminator  for  suicide.  Viewed  through  the 
lens of a predictive test, about 20% of all suicides are 
previously  hospitalized  patients  (sensitivity)38  and  the 
long-term suicide risk of hospitalized patients (positive 
predictive value) has been reported to be 2.5% for men 
and 1.5% for women.42
  Current  and  former  inpatients  are  a  well-defined 
group who might benefit from selective suicide preven-
tative  measures. While  the  absolute  risk  of  suicide  as-
sociated with inpatient care might not justify prolonged 
hospitalization  or  other  restrictions  on  liberty,43  some 
less intrusive suicide preventative measures seem to be 
quite  effective.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  inpatient  sui-
cide rates have declined in response to a range of mea-
sures including the reduction in hanging points44 and by 
policies for regular observation in hospital.45 Moreover, 
reducing the stigma and trauma associated with psychi-
atric admissions might prevent some suicides.46, 47 

Prediction and prevention using higher-risk 
categories

Suicide risk assessment is widely recommended in clini-
cal practice48-51 and often has the explicit aim of creating 
suicide risk groups denoted by the terms high, medium- 
and  low-risk.52,53  While  there  is  no  agreement  about 
how  to  perform  a  suicide  risk  assessment,  inquiring 
about suicidal thought and behaviors is usually consid-
ered central to the task.54,55 Specialist mental health ser-
vices often insist on semi-structured risk assessment us-
ing lists of risk factors, and some researchers advocate 
for suicide risk questionnaires or scales.56 Each of these 
approaches meets this paper’s definition of  prediction 
as a method that can identify groups or individuals at 
increased risk of suicide.
  A 2017 review examined the predictive properties of 
suicide  risk  assessment  quantified  by  recent  meta-anal-
yses.57 The review located meta-analyses that found that 
no  risk  factor,58  or  combination  of  risk  factors,59  was  so 
strongly  associated  with  suicide  as  to  be  clinically  use-
ful. One meta-analysis found that the positive predictive 
value  of  suicidal  ideation  for  suicide  was  about  1%  per 
annum,60 while a second found that higher-risk categoriza-
tions based on multiple risk factors discriminated between 
higher-risk and lower-risk groups with pooled odds of 4.84 
and a sensitivity of 56%.59 Two meta-analyses calculated 

the  positive  predictive  value  among  “higher-risk”  pa-
tients to be 5% in the long-term.59, 61 
These  replicated,  robust,  and  ultimately  disappointing 
results  suggest  that  while  risk  assessments  do  provide 
some information about future suicide, this information 
is limited and a very limited set of selective suicide-pre-
venting  interventions  might  be  rationally  used  on  the 
basis of a higher-risk categorization. If as few as 5% of 
higher-risk people die by suicide in the long term, any 
commensurate  suicide  reducing  intervention  must  be 
both benign and cost-effective so as to be acceptable to 
the remaining 95%. Furthermore, if such a benign and 
cost-effective  long-term  or  long-lasting  intervention 
were  available,  there  would  be  very  strong  arguments 
that the same intervention should be offered to lower-
risk patients, among whom over 40% of suicides occur. 

Prediction and prevention of suicide by 
individual patients 

Suicide risk assessment aims to reduce the uncertainty 
about future suicide. So far I have assumed that this un-
certainty is statistical in nature and that it can be mea-
sured  using  metrics  of  sensitivity,  discrimination,  and 
positive predictive value. However, uncertainty is often 
regarded  as  having  two  components,  the  first  compo-
nent resulting from chance factors, is variously denoted 
as statistical, probabilistic, or aleatory uncertainty and 
the second component being epistemic, resulting from 
a lack of knowledge.62-64 Both types of uncertainty are 
at play in medical practice. For example, an intravenous 
drug user is at increased probability of contracting hu-
man  immunodeficiency  virus—but  on  presentation 
with an opportunistic infection, whether he or she has 
acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  is  not  a  matter 
of chance but of facts that can be resolved by increased 
knowledge, in this case by performing blood tests. 
  There is little doubt that aleatory factors play a ma-
jor role in suicide. The potential range of future events 
experienced  by  people  is  large  and  unknowable.  Fur-
ther,  the  degree  of  complexity  of  a  person’s  biology, 
psychology  and  social  setting  strongly  points  to  the 
role  of  non-linear  dynamics,  rendering  suicide  unpre-
dictable even if all the initial risk and protective factors 
could be known.65 However, here I would like to briefly 
consider whether increased knowledge of an individual 
person can meaningfully reduce uncertainty about sui-
cide to the point of indicating measures to prevent an 

201

2 0 t h   a n n i v e r s a r y   i s s u e

individual  suicide.  On  initial  consideration  this  seems 
unlikely because the law of large numbers dictates that 
uncertainty  in  a  single  trial  is  always  greater  than  the 
uncertainty  of  repeated  trials  and  because  of  the  em-
pirical evidence that statistical or actuarial approaches 
are generally better at forecasting human behavior than 
clinical judgment.66
  However,  in  some  circumstances  clinicians  might 
come to a high degree of certainty on epistemic grounds. 
Consider the example of a young, employed, non-men-
tally ill, and never psychiatrically admitted mother who 
was found to have written a suicide note before taking 
a deliberate and well-planed overdose of a highly lethal 
substance. The lack of many established suicide risk fac-
tors and the protective factor of children suggest a low-
er suicide risk, but epistemic knowledge of the details of 
the suicide attempt and of the circumstances described 
by  the  patient  might  lead  a  clinician  to  make  a  judg-
ment that the patient is suicidal. In practice this sort of 
epistemic judgments might not be rare.
  Two  questions  then  arise.  How  reliable  are  epis-
temic  assessment  of  future  suicide  and  what  might  be 
rationally  done  to  prevent  suicide  in  the  event  of  an 
epistemic judgment of imminent suicide?
  The answer to the first question is not known. What 
is  known  is  that  nomothetic  risk  factors  (risk  factors 
possessed by classes or cohorts of individuals), includ-
ing  the  presence  of  suicidal  thoughts  and  behaviors, 
alone  cannot  lead  to  certainty  about  suicide.  If  judg-
ments  about  suicide  are  to  reach  a  very  high  level  of 
certainty this can only be achieved with specific, proxi-
mal,  and  idiographic  factors  (those  that  are  unique 
to  the  individual)  and  not  with  what  are  traditionally 
considered  to  be  risk  or  protective  factors.  Moreover, 
this has to be a contemporaneous judgment (given the 
weakness of predictive algorithms) involving as little in 
the way of forecasting as possible. This is not to say that 
this form of certainty is not sometimes possible, but it 
does imply that clinicians should examine the evidence 
before  them  very  carefully,  and  that  they  should  give 
less  weight  to  traditional  risk  factors  when  making 
judgments about suicidality than is generally held.
  Assuming  that  a  clinician  has  formed  the  view 
that the patient is suicidal, what then is the appropri-
ate  preventative  step?  The  most  common  response 
is  that  the  patient  should  be  observed  and  protected 
until their distress has resolved. This observation and 
protection  often  involves  admission  of  the  patient  to 

a  psychiatric  hospital.  While  it  is  generally  assumed 
that hospitalization can prevent suicide, this has never 
been  demonstrated  empirically.  Moreover,  there  is  a 
minority view that the loss of autonomy, trauma, and 
stigma  associated  with  hospitalization  contributes  to 
suicides in the inpatient and setting47 and in the post-
discharge period.67

How the limits of suicide prediction 
impact on prevention

The limits of suicide prediction appear to be profound. 
The single strongest discriminator of suicide risk is sta-
tus  as  a  current  or  recent  psychiatric  hospital  patient, 
and this association is more than an order of magnitude 
stronger  than  the  degree  of  discrimination  made  pos-
sible by other forms of suicide risk assessment.  

In the future some improvement in risk assessment 
might  flow  from  the  identification  of  hereto-unknown 
risk factors68 or by new ways of combining established 
risk factors, such as with machine learning69 and other 
methods derived from nonlinear dynamics.65 However 
new methods of suicide risk assessment might only be 
useful if they have powers of statistical discrimination 
greatly exceeding existing methods. 
  There  may  also  be  a  role  of  real-time  monitoring 
using  new  wearable  technologies.  However,  even  if 
proximal  measures  obtained  by  real-time  monitoring 
do  have  a  much  stronger  discrimination  between  sui-
cide and non-suicide than conventional risk factors, the 
positive predictive power will not be increased and may 
even be lower because of the intrinsically low base rate 
of suicide over short time frames.
  Moreover,  the  limitations  of  prevention  also  im-
pact  on  the  usefulness  of  suicide  prediction. There  is 
simply  no  value  in  a  prediction  that  cannot  lead  to 
an effective preventative measure. While the positive 
predictive value can be assumed to be a relevant fac-
tor in judgments about ethics of exposing false positive 
cases  to  adverse  effects  of  suicide  preventing  inter-
ventions, the effectiveness of the interventions is also 
relevant.  Despite  the  widespread  adoption  of  suicide 
risk assessment there are no published randomized tri-
als demonstrating that risk assessment can guide any 
suicide-reducing interventions to the point of reducing 
the overall prevalence of suicide in the assessed group, 
and it remains to be seen if this evidence threshold can 
be achieved by any new suicide-predicting method.

Accepting the limits of suicide prediction

The best prospects for global suicide prevention do not 
involve traditional notions of suicide prediction or risk 
assessment. Reducing the suicide rate in countries with 
a high suicide rate or reducing the suicide rate of men 
to nearer that of women would achieve large reductions 
in global suicide rates. Attention to the care of hospital-
ized patients cannot be ignored because of the extraor-
dinary  suicide  rate  in  this  group,  but  this  can  only  be 
expected to have a modest effect on total suicide rates 
because  most  suicides  are  by  people  who  have  never 
been  in  a  psychiatric  hospital.  More  generally,  psychi-
atric treatment should be offered to all people in order 
to  alleviate  their  burden  of  symptoms  and  should  not 
be  rationed  or  justified  by  notions  of  who  is  likely  or 
unlikely  to  suicide. While  some  patients  will  generate 
more concern about suicide than others, knowledge of 
the limited sensitivity, modest power of discrimination, 
and the very low positive predictive value of suicide risk 
assessment  should  assist  clinicians  in  the  task  of  joint 
decision making with their suicidal patients. 
  Refraining  from  the  temptation  to  predict  suicide 
in clinical psychiatric practice might even assist suicide 
prevention.  Low  positive  predictive  values  mean  that 
most people who receive treatment because of a high-
er-risk categorization will never die by suicide and the 
limited sensitivity means that as almost half of the pa-
tients who do die by suicide might have been deprived 
of preventative measures after a lower-risk categoriza-

tion. Epistemic judgements about future suicide should 
be made very carefully and only after all the available 
evidence is gathered. Valid statistical risk factors might 
contribute  to  such  an  epistemic  call  about  suicidality, 
but this contribution should be modest.
  Rather  than  attempt  to  make  a  suicide  prediction, 
clinicians  should  focus  on  improving  the  interaction 
with  the  patient  so  as  to  foster  hope,  reduce  the  pa-
tient’s  distress  and  suffering,  and  maximize  the  thera-
peutic  alliance.  A  comprehensive  assessment  of  the 
patient’s current needs should follow. These needs will 
often  include  the  need  to  address  modifiable  factors 
that are associated with suicide, for example treatment 
of substance use, but most such needs should be met ir-
respective of the associations with future suicide. Needs 
assessments  are  not  probabilistic  and  should  lead  to 
treatments being offered to all patients irrespective of 
perceived suicide risk. 
  Finally,  psychiatrists  should  explicitly  acknowledge 
the  limits  of  prediction  of  suicide  to  our  patients  and 
their families and health care systems providers. Low-
ered faith in prediction and acceptance of the limits of 
prevention  might  have  the  benefit  of  reducing  unnec-
essarily restrictive interventions and might allow clini-
cians to focus on more achievable treatment goals and 
the patient’s path to recovery. o

El papel de la predicción en la prevención del 
suicidio

En general, se cree que la prevención del suicidio impli-
ca la consideración de los factores de riesgo y de protec-
ción, y las intervenciones relacionadas. Las intervencio-
nes preventivas se pueden clasificar como “universales” 
(dirigidas  a  toda  la  población),  “selectivas”  (dirigidas 
a grupos de mayor riesgo) e “indicadas” (protección a 
las personas). Esta revisión explora el rango de medidas 
preventivas que podrían usarse de manera acorde con 
los  diferentes  tipos  de  predicción  de  suicidio.  El  autor 
concluye  que  las  mejores  perspectivas  para  la  preven-
ción del suicidio se encuentran en las estrategias univer-
sales  de  prevención.  Si  bien  las  evaluaciones  de  riesgo 
sí aportan cierta información sobre futuros suicidios, la 
categorización  del  riesgo  de  suicidio  genera  una  fre-
cuencia, inaceptablemente alta, de falsos positivos; deja 
de lado muchas muertes y es, por lo tanto, inapropiada 
para guiar de manera útil las estrategias de prevención. 
La  evaluación  de  los  pacientes  con  tendencias  suicidas 
debería centrarse en los factores del momento y las ne-
cesidades del paciente, más que en las nociones proba-
bilísticas de riesgo de suicidio.   

Le rôle du pronostic dans la prévention du suicide

Il  est  largement  reconnu  que  la  prévention  du  suicide 
implique la prise en compte des facteurs de risque et de 
protection  et  des  interventions  qui  s’y  rapportent.  Les 
interventions de prévention peuvent être « universelles 
» (ciblant toutes les populations), « sélectives » (ciblant 
des groupes à haut risque) ou « indiquées » (protégeant 
les individus). Cet article explore l’éventail des mesures 
préventives qui pourraient être utilisées proportionnel-
lement aux différents types de pronostic de suicide. Pour 
l’auteur,  les  meilleures  perspectives  de  prévention  du 
suicide résident dans les stratégies universelles de pré-
vention.  Les  évaluations  du  risque  génèrent  certaines 
informations  sur  le  suicide  à  venir,  mais  la  catégorisa-
tion du risque suicidaire entraîne un taux inacceptable-
ment élevé de faux positifs, passe à côté de beaucoup 
de décès et est donc inappropriée pour guider les straté-
gies de prévention. L’évaluation des patients suicidaires 
devrait se concentrer sur des facteurs contemporains et 
les besoins des patients plus que sur des notions de pro-
babilité du risque suicidaire.
