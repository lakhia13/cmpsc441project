Abstract
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant public health concern for which existing therapies are
only marginally effective. Indisputably, the primary line of treatment for PTSD is psychotherapy, according
to current treatment guidelines. However, PTSD continues to be a chronic condition even after
psychotherapy, with high psychiatric and medical illness rates. There is a dire need to search for new
compounds and approaches for managing PTSD. The usage of psychedelic substances is a potential new
method. This article reviews the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy in treating PTSD and improving
patient outcomes. It will examine current research on the topic and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of
different therapies. The current evidence for the use of four different types of psychedelics (3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ketamine, classical psychedelics, and cannabis) in the treatment of
PTSD will be reviewed. It will also include an overview of the therapeutic justification, context of use, and
level of evidence available for each drug. Several questions are formulated that could be studied in future
research in order to gain a better understanding of the topic.

Introduction And Background
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex mental disorder that affects 7.7 million adults in the
United States annually, with one in 11 individuals being diagnosed with PTSD at some point in their lives.
More than twice as many women (10%) as men (4%) have PTSD, with sexual assault being the most common
traumatic incidence [1]. According to the DSM-5 criteria, PTSD is a mental health disorder that can develop
after exposure to a traumatic event, such as death, serious injury, or sexual violence [2]. PTSD is
characterized by recurring and distressing symptoms that last at least one month after the traumatic event.
Symptoms of PTSD include dissociative reactions, distressing dreams, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli,
perpetual psychological distress, adverse changes in cognition and mood, and variation in arousal and
reactivity [3]. 

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline and paroxetine are U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved first-line therapeutics for the treatment of PTSD [2]. It is estimated that 40-
60% of patients treated with these compounds do not experience any response [4]. Although trauma-focused
psychotherapies, such as prolonged exposure and cognitive behavioral therapy, are considered the most
effective treatments for PTSD, many people do not respond well to these treatments or continue to have
significant symptoms, and dropout rates are high [4]. Poor outcomes from treatment are often associated
with comorbid conditions such as childhood trauma, alcohol and substance abuse, depression, and
dissociation [2]. Therefore, it is essential to identify a beneficial treatment for those typically resistant to
treatment.

Psychedelic-assisted therapy involves a different approach to treating PTSD. It includes an evaluation by a
medical professional to ensure safety, a few sessions to prepare the patient and build rapport, and one to
three (six to eight hours) sessions where the patient is under the psychedelic influence [5]. Finally, there are
integration sessions where the experience is processed and explored [6]. The positive outcomes of these
intensive treatments are likely due to the intensity of the interventions themselves [5]. They also require a
lot of resources, so careful consideration must be given to how they can be integrated into the existing
healthcare systems in a way that is fair and accessible to everyone [6].

The exact mechanisms by which psychedelics produce changes in perception and cognition are not fully
understood. However, they may involve reduced activity in the brain's default mode network and increased
functional connectivity between different brain regions [5]. The neural networks (cingulate, insular,

prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus) that involve the monoamine neurotransmitters like
serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate are altered in PTSD due to trauma and potential genetic susceptibility.
The endocrine and autonomic nervous systems are subsequently impacted by these network alterations,
which results in the physiological and subjective symptoms of PTSD. The neural network and subjective
levels of this process are where psychedelic-assisted therapy has the most observable effects [7].

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in psychedelics as potential medicines representing a new
paradigm in drug development. Although there are still many unanswered questions about how these drugs
work and how effective they are, there has been a reawakening of interest in their potential therapeutic
benefits for conditions ranging from depression and substance abuse to PTSD [4].

This traditional review article will discuss the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies in the treatment of
PTSD and in improving patient outcomes. It will explore the current research on the subject and assess the
pros and cons of these therapies. For this review, we use a broad definition of psychedelic drugs, including
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), ketamine, and cannabis, whose pharmacological profiles
differ significantly from the serotonergic classical psychedelics (such as psilocybin and lysergic acid
diethylamide). However, they all have the ability to induce altered states of consciousness. 

In the sections that follow, we will give a general overview of the evidence that is currently available for four
different types of psychedelics (MDMA, ketamine, classical psychedelics, and cannabis), as well as
background information on the therapeutic justification for each drug, the context in which it is used, and
the level of evidence that is currently available for the treatment of PTSD.

Search strategy 

We comprehensively searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases for English-language
literature. Extensive research was conducted using keywords to validate the studies analyzing and assessing
the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies in managing PTSD. Keywords included lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD), MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin, PTSD, psychedelic-assisted therapy, hallucinogens,
cannabinoids, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and synaptic connectivity. All the articles were considered
without the restriction of time of publication or study type, i.e., traditional reviews, systematic reviews,
clinical trials, case-control studies, and cohort studies. Studies were not refined based on age and ethnicity,
and the search had no demographic limitations. Animal studies were excluded. As this is a traditional review
article, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were not
followed. Data was collected from inception up to October 2022.

MDMA

MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) was first created in 1912 as a part of the process of making
medicine that helps control bleeding. It was not widely known until the 1970s when its psychoactive effects
were discovered. It gained the attention of many psychotherapists, who started using it as a tool for
psychotherapy. It became widely known as a "party drug" in 1985, after which the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration placed it on schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act, making its therapeutic use illegal.
Despite its initial therapeutic use, no clinical trials were conducted until 2000 [8]. After this, it has been
studied as a potential treatment for PTSD [9], alcohol use disorder [10], and social anxiety in autistic adults
[11].

Several scientific papers have discussed the potential therapeutic benefits of using MDMA as part of
psychotherapy [12]. It has been demonstrated that MDMA increases prosocial behavior, affective contact
pleasure, and emotional empathy [13]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated to raise subjective judgments
of openness, trust, and interpersonal closeness [14]. From a neurobiological perspective, MDMA has been
shown to reduce activity in the amygdala, a region of the brain associated with fear and anxiety, while
increasing activity in the frontal cortex, a region involved in higher-level thinking and decision-making.
This may benefit people with PTSD, as they often have impaired frontal cortex activity [15].

Six women with chronic PTSD brought on by sexual assault participated in the first clinical trial examining
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treating PTSD, which took place in Spain from 2000 to 2002 [16]. Patients
underwent several 90-minute non-drug psychotherapy sessions before and after low doses of MDMA (50 or
75 mg). PTSD symptom reductions were seen in both MDMA groups. However, statistical analysis was not
possible due to the limited patient population. The most significant finding from this study was that giving
MDMA to this demographic appeared to be both physically and mentally safe [16].

The first randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD was
published in 2010 [9]. In a study of treatment-resistant patients, those who received two sessions of MDMA
(plus an optional booster of 62.5 mg) had better outcomes than those who received a placebo. According to
the study results, 83% of the patients given MDMA no longer met the criteria for PTSD, as opposed to only
25% of the patients in the placebo group [9]. The long-term follow-up results revealed that treatment effects
persisted for three years [17]. These findings were also confirmed in other studies where individuals
receiving MDMA also displayed increases in post-traumatic growth [18]. A pooled analysis of data from six
different RCTs involving 105 patients revealed that those who received MDMA experienced significantly
greater reductions in symptoms of PTSD than those in the control group. After two MDMA sessions, 54.2%
of patients no longer met the diagnosis of PTSD, compared with 22.6% in the control group [12]. According
to studies comparing the efficacy of paroxetine and sertraline with that of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy,
the latter has greater effect sizes and lower dropout rates. Based on these findings, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration granted MDMA the status of breakthrough therapy for the treatment of PTSD [19].

The side effects of MDMA that users most commonly reported include anxiety, a tight feeling in the jaw,
headache, and fatigue. When the first effects of MDMA become apparent, anxiety episodes can occur but are
readily managed with psychotherapy treatment [12]. MDMA's effects on heart rate and blood pressure
increase in severity as the dosage increases. Some forms of hypertension and severe cardiovascular
pathology are considered to be conditions that would make this medication inadvisable [20]. As induced by
MDMA, slight hyperthermia presents no problem when used in a medical setting [21]. Concerns about
MDMA's potential for abuse and neurotoxicity have been voiced by certain authors [22]. However, the usage
of MDMA under medical supervision has prevented neither of these from happening [12].

Table 1 provides a review of the clinical trials undertaken on the use of MDMA in the management of PTSD.

Ketamine

Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonist, was first synthesized in 1962. It
was approved as an anesthetic in 1970 and is often referred to as a "dissociative psychedelic" [23]. Based on
an aversion strategy, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy has been utilized to treat alcoholism and heroin
addiction since the 1990s [24]. Research on ketamine has grown in the last 20 years as a treatment option for
various psychiatric conditions [25]. Multiple clinical studies at the beginning of the early 2000s revealed
ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects [26]. Studies examining its antidepressant benefits [26] and its
implications on suicidal ideation [27] have increased exponentially since then. It is also a candidate for
focusing on emotional memories and is being researched more extensively for the treatment of PTSD [28].

Several neurobiological processes have been proposed for how ketamine might lessen the symptoms of
PTSD [29]. One theory suggests that PTSD is a "synaptic disconnection syndrome". Psychedelic drugs like
ketamine may work by rapidly increasing the brain's ability to form new connections between neurons. This
could explain why these drugs have therapeutic effects [30].

In 41 patients with chronic PTSD and related depressive symptoms, the only RCT on ketamine for the
treatment of PTSD compared a single IV infusion of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine with a single IV infusion of 0.045
mg/kg midazolam [31]. The severity of PTSD symptoms was significantly and quickly reduced by ketamine
infusion, and this effect persisted for seven days following the single infusion. These transient
improvements suggest a rapid neurobiological operating mechanism that is also seen when ketamine is used
to treat depression [31]. Research indicates that ketamine's therapeutic effects on PTSD can be strengthened
and prolonged with repeated infusions, similar to how it is used to treat depression [32]. In another study, 15
war veterans with comorbid PTSD and treatment-resistant depression received six intravenous ketamine
infusions (0.5 mg/kg) throughout 12 days. The median time to relapse was 41 days, and the remission rate
for PTSD was 80% [32].

So far, only one published study has tried using ketamine to treat PTSD using a similar strategy to drug-
assisted psychotherapy [33]. This study combined the administration of ketamine with mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy in order to treat patients with refractory PTSD. Patients received a single intravenous
injection of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or saline over 40 minutes. Before the treatment, patients were asked to
think about their traumatic experience in a controlled way by reflecting on a personalized story about what
happened. In addition to the infusion, they practiced mindfulness exercises for two cycles (ten minutes
each). Ketamine enhanced a state in which patients passively welcomed the unpleasant memories as they
came rather than reacting fearfully to them. Patients who received ketamine had a much longer-lasting
improvement (34 days) in PTSD symptoms than those who received a placebo (16 days) [33].

Drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, altered vision, altered perception, and dose-dependent dissociative
symptoms are among the most reported ketamine adverse effects [34]. In some cases, ketamine can cause
transient anxiety [35]. Clinical settings that are supportive can minimize such reactions  [35]. Ketamine has
sympathomimetic effects, which raise blood pressure and heart rate. As a result, severe cardiovascular
disease and various types of hypertension are considered contraindications [34]. While the early psychedelic
effects of ketamine are frequently seen as adverse side effects, some of these effects are thought to have
therapeutic benefits from a substance-assisted psychotherapy approach [33].

Classical psychedelics

Psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) are a few of the
substances that make up the class of drugs known as "classical psychedelics", and they all work primarily by
agonistic activity at the 5-HT2A receptor [4]. Psilocybin has been studied to treat depression, anxiety [36],
tobacco [37], and alcohol addiction [38]. Results of several recent studies point to the possibility that PTSD
treatment may benefit from the effects of classical psychedelics [4]. It has also been demonstrated that
classical psychedelics reduce the amygdala's responsiveness when processing emotions [39]. This can help
PTSD patients as they frequently exhibit increased amygdala activation [40]. They may also play a
therapeutic role in the management of PTSD by virtue of other acute effects, such as higher levels of
emotional empathy [41], increased insightfulness [42], improvements in acceptance [43], and emotive
transformational events, which has shown to be a key mediator in the long-term psychological change in
other mental disorders [44]. So far, no clinical trials have been conducted to examine the potential of
classical psychedelics for the treatment of PTSD [4].

Classical psychedelics can occasionally cause brief episodes of nausea, vomiting, and discomfort in the body
[36]. They also cause mentally challenging experiences, such as anxiety and confusion  [45]. Some patients
may exhibit emotional vulnerability in the days after the therapy, which emphasizes the significance of
receiving psychological assistance [43]. Classical psychedelics can cause an increase in heart rate and blood
pressure. Therefore, some forms of hypertension and severe cardiovascular pathology are contraindications.
When used under medical supervision, they are not harmful to the human body and do not result in
dependence or significant side effects (such as flashbacks) [45].

Cannabinoids 

For thousands of years, people in Asia and the Middle East have used cannabis for religious, therapeutic,
and other purposes [46]. It was first used medically in the West in the 19th century to treat rheumatism,
convulsions, and other conditions [47]. Since the discovery of the endogenous cannabinoid system in the
1990s, scientific research into the medical uses of cannabinoids has grown [46]. The endocannabinoid
system is being extensively researched as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PTSD [48]. In
the past 20 years, several nations have legalized medical cannabis. Recently, the World Health Organisation
(WHO) proposed that cannabis be rescheduled to allow for medical applications [49].

There are more than 100 distinct cannabinoids found in cannabis. However, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and
cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most researched [50]. In addition, research has also been done on several
synthetic cannabinoids, such as nabilone and dronabinol [51]. Cannabinoids interact with the
endocannabinoid system, which is responsible for emotional memories and mediating the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal response to stress [52]. Chronic stress has been shown to decrease the number of
cannabinoid type 1 receptors [53], which may contribute to symptoms of PTSD such as hyperarousal,
sleeping problems, and intrusive memories [46]. These results lend credence to the use of cannabis in the
management of PTSD.

In contrast to other psychedelic drugs, cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids are primarily utilized and
researched to temporarily relieve PTSD symptoms. They may also have value in substance-assisted
psychotherapy [4]. THC and CBD are two cannabinoids that have demonstrated the ability to promote fear
extinction [54] and to hinder the reconsolidation of fear memories  [55]. The efficacy of exposure therapy
might be improved by the tailored use of certain cannabinoids since fear extinction processes are crucial for
successful exposure therapy [48] and because PTSD patients have demonstrated poorer fear extinction
learning and recall than controls [56].

The use of cannabis to treat PTSD has been examined in several research studies. In one study, ten
outpatients already receiving stable medication for their PTSD symptoms were given 5 mg of THC
(sublingually) twice daily as an adjunctive treatment [57]. Overall symptom severity, sleep quality,
nightmare frequency, and hyperarousal symptoms all significantly improved. Because of the limited sample
size, lack of a control group, and interference from other drugs, these results should be viewed with caution
[57].

In a cross-over, placebo-controlled trial, nabilone was administered to ten people living with PTSD from the
Canadian military who had dreams connected to traumatic events [58]. Patients who took nabilone for seven
weeks demonstrated considerably more substantial improvements in their PTSD symptoms based on their
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) Recurring and Distressing Dream scores, Clinical Global

Impression of Change scores, and the General Well-Being Questionnaire scores compared to when they got a
placebo [58]. These results support the preliminary findings from previous nabilone studies in 47 PTSD
patients who participated in an open-label chart review study [59] and 104 male inmates who participated in
a retrospective study [60], both of which found that the drug had positive effects on a number of PTSD
symptoms, particularly nightmares and sleep issues. High-quality studies are needed to further investigate
the effects of cannabis on PTSD, according to a new meta-analysis [61].

Cannabinoids frequently cause adverse effects, including lethargy, disorientation, and dry mouth [62].
Vomiting and nausea may occasionally happen during heavy use. Cannabinoids can cause anxiety, mainly if
used in more significant amounts [63]. They may also increase the chance of developing psychotic illnesses
in those predisposed to them [64]. Regular cannabis usage for recreational purposes has also been linked to
cognitive deficiencies, particularly in adolescents [63]. The emergence of cannabis use disorder in
susceptible individuals is another possible risk factor [65]. This highlights the significance of appropriate
screening and treatment monitoring.

Limitations

Classical psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD have demonstrated encouraging outcomes for treating
several psychiatric conditions. However, the limitations of this study have shown that PTSD-specific clinical
trials are still scarce. There is a need for more extensive randomized controlled trials to assess the safety and
efficacy of cannabinoids, particularly whole-plant cannabis. There are many unanswered questions regarding
appropriate doses, ratios of cannabinoids, methods of administration, long-term risks, and side effects. In
most recent research, therapists observed each patient's internal process as it developed throughout their
medication sessions in a rather non-directive manner. It is still unclear if individuals who are experiencing
the effects of psychedelics might potentially benefit from more direct methods like extended exposure,
cognitive processing therapy, or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.

Conclusions
There is no doubt that exposure-based psychotherapy should be used as the first line of treatment for PTSD.
However, PTSD frequently persists as a chronic condition with high rates of psychological and medical
comorbidity. Novel therapies that might improve the effectiveness of PTSD treatments are thus urgently
needed. As this review highlights, psychedelic substances provide prospects for a revolutionary method of
treating PTSD. Each of the examined substances has a distinctive potential, from their use to quickly target
PTSD symptoms to their use as adjuncts to support psychotherapy. More research is needed to determine the
safety and efficacy of psychedelics and identify the patients for whom these treatments might be most
effective. Another crucial topic for investigation is contraindications concerning particular symptom
clusters and personality traits. From a therapeutic and neurobiological standpoint, there is also a need to
better comprehend the psychological states these psychedelic substances can induce. These new research
studies will enable us to assess how these alterations may improve the psychotherapeutic treatment of PTSD
and better comprehend the physiological mechanisms of action.
