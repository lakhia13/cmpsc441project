Mindfulness refers to a mental state of awareness of internal experience without
judgment. Studies have suggested that each mindfulness practice may involve
a unique mental state, but the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms
remain unknown. Here we examined how distinct mindfulness practices
after mindfulness-based intervention alter brain functionality. Speciﬁcally, we
investigated the functional alterations of
the salience network (SN) using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) among the two interoceptive
mindfulness practices—breathing and body scan—associated with interoceptive
awareness in ﬁxed attention and shifted attention, respectively. Long-distance
functional connectivity (FC) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) approaches were
applied to measure distant and local neural information processing across various
mental states. We hypothesized that mindful breathing and body scan would
yield a unique information processing pattern in terms of long-range and local
functional connectivity (FC). A total of 18 meditation-naïve participants were
enrolled in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program
alongside a waitlist control group (n = 14), with both groups undergoing multiple
fMRI sessions during breathing, body scan and resting state for comparison.
We demonstrated that two mindfulness practices affect both the long-distance
FCSN and the local ReHo, only apparent after the MBSR program. Three
functional distinctions between the mindfulness practices and the resting state
are noted: (1) distant SN connectivity to occipital regions increased during the
breathing practice (ﬁxed attention), whereas the SN increased connection with
the frontal/central gyri during the body scan (shifting attention); (2) local ReHo
increased only in the parietal lobe during the body scan (shifting attention); (3)
distant and local connections turned into a positive correlation only during the
mindfulness practices after the MBSR training, indicating a global enhancement
of the SN information processing during mindfulness practices. Though with

1. Introduction

Mindfulness refers to a mental state of awareness of internal
and external experiences without judgment (Kabat-Zinn, 1994).
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is the most widely
studied form of mindfulness-based intervention. MBSR was
designed to enhance a mindfulness practitioner’s abilities to
retain awareness in the present, interpret intra- and interpersonal
situations with clarity, and respond appropriately to adversity
(Santorelli et al., 2017). Numerous studies have reported the
beneﬁts of MBSR, such as reduced anxiety and depression,
enhanced emotional regulation, alleviation of sleep disturbances,
improved quality of life, and even postponed dementia onset
among mindfulness practitioners (Davidson et al., 2003; Goldin and
Gross, 2010; Larouche et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2019).

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), recent
meta-analysis disclosed that mindfulness trainings alter the brain
connectivity of multiple brain networks, associated with the
cognitive performances of attention control, pain relief and
emotion regulation (Sezer et al., 2022). These beneﬁcial outcomes
and brain-network changes after the mindfulness training may
originate from the “being mode” mindset (i.e., non-attachment,
non-striving, and an accepting attitude) and the persistent practice
of core techniques during the 8-week MBSR program, including
breathing, body scan, yoga, loving-kindness, sitting meditation,
and open monitoring (Kabat-Zinn, 1990, 2003). Although these
elementary mindfulness practices are not usually diﬀerentiated
from the entirety of MBSR package, studies have demonstrated
that mindfulness practices may involve a certain level of cognition
and underlying peripheral nervous system. For example, Lumma
et al. demonstrated that both the increase in heart rate and
the reduction in high-frequency heart rate variability (HRV)
reported after meditation training are more prominent after loving-
kindness than after breathing practice (Lumma et al., 2015). Kok
et al. compared the state changes recorded through self-assessed
psychological measures after presence (breathing and body scan),
loving-kindness, and observing-thoughts meditation, concluding
that each technique is characterized by its own distinct short-
term psychological ﬁngerprint (Kok and Singer, 2017). From the
viewpoint of brain functions, Brewer et al. demonstrated the
elevated connectivity between dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
(dACC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) only occurred in the
choiceless awareness, rather than concentration or loving-kindness
meditations, among long-term meditators (Brewer et al., 2011),
implying the distinction of goal-directed attention levels among
diﬀerent mindfulness practices. Moreover, Fujino et al. reported
reduced ventral-striatum connectivity during the open monitoring
meditation but increased connectivity in the same regions during

the focused attention meditation (Fujino et al., 2018), inferring
the reduced habitual behavior and enhanced memory function
during the open-monitoring meditation. At the current stage, the
neurophysiological speciﬁcity of distinctive mindfulness practices
remains largely unknown. Therefore, identifying the discrepancies
in the brain-network organizations yielded by distinct mindfulness
practices can provide further insights into how mindfulness-based
intervention shapes brain functionality and alters behaviors.

To achieve this goal, we determined to investigate the two
fundamental mindfulness practices—the mindful breathing and
the body scan. These two practices typically require the use
of interoceptive awareness with increased vagal tone (Gerritsen
and Band, 2018). By placing attention on bodily sensations,
these practices help to anchor the mind in the present moment,
thereby facilitating relaxation without entanglement in aﬀective
ruminations (Gibson, 2019). Although these two practices are
classiﬁed within the same broad category, each has its own
unique features. Breathing meditation entails ﬁxed attention on
the bodily sensations associated with breathing (e.g., the passage
of airﬂow through the nostrils, contraction of the abdomen),
whereas during the body scan practice, participants are instructed
to shift their attention toward certain body parts sequentially
(Malinowski, 2013; Gibson, 2019). In subjective reports, some
meditation participants prefer the body scan practice to breathing
because it is less monotonous and thus relaxing, whereas others
express a preference for breathing precisely because of its emphasis
on a single target for interoceptive awareness without the need
to constantly shift attention to other objects. The distinct features
and subjective evaluations of adaptive interoceptive attentional
styles observed between breathing mediation and body scan lead
to the speculation that these two mindfulness practices would
involve in distributed but dissociable neurocognitive mechanisms
(Tomasino and Fabbro, 2016; Gibson, 2019). In our previous work
with objective measures, we conducted electroencephalography
(EEG) recordings in both practices (breathing and body scan)
before and after the MBSR program, and the results indicated
reduced EEG Delta power during the breathing but not the body
scan (Ng et al., 2021), suggesting a higher vigilance level
in
the breathing practice among novice practitioners. Accordingly,
we speculate that even in individuals with similar levels of
strategies
attention and introspection, diﬀerent mindfulness
(breathing and body scan) can lead to distinctive brain-connectivity
patterns.

2016). To understand the neural circuitry underlying mindfulness,
the FC approach has been widely applied to topics ranging from
the mindfulness trait (Parkinson et al., 2019) and mindfulness
intervention (Doll et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2020) to clinical
pathologies (Zhao et al., 2019; Fam et al., 2020). For example, Kral
et al. demonstrated that FC between the PCC and the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) continually increased, even after the
8 weeks of MBSR program (Kral et al., 2019), which implies a
plausible neuroimaging indication of altered thought processes
in a wandering mind. However, most of the FC studies examined
temporal correlations among brain regions distant away from each
other, but the local information processing in brain (i.e., neural
communications within a 2–10 mm radius), in which interneurons
are clustered and exhibit a common resonance mode (Gray,
1999), has often been overlooked. To this viewpoint, we further
hypothesize that the two mindfulness practices, breathing and
body scan, may display diﬀerent information processing patterns
in terms of long-range and local connectivity. To account for the
FC in both distant and local spatial scales, this study adopted an
additional functional index of regional homogeneity (ReHo). ReHo
is a measurement of intraregional communication within a set of
nearest-neighbor voxels, reﬂecting local synchronizations or local
connectivity of brain spontaneous activities (Zang et al., 2004).
Previous studies found the positive correlation between ReHo and
glucose metabolism (Nugent et al., 2014; Aiello et al., 2015), and
investigators commonly used ReHo to evaluate brain functions in
clinical cases, such as depression or migraine (Iwabuchi et al., 2015;
Cui et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022). Recently, we analyzed the local and
distant connectivity (ReHo and FC, respectively) simultaneously
across diﬀerent sleep stages, and the observations of increased
ReHo and declined FC during the sleep stage 2 indicated the
altered brain functionality toward local processing, rather than
long-distance communications in wakefulness (Kung et al., 2021).
Therefore, we hypothesized that
the information processing
pattern, regarding both local and distant connectivity at the same
time, changes during mindfulness practices and/or after training.
To date, only four studies have utilized the ReHo index to evaluate
the brain functional changes in mindfulness programs (Kong et al.,
2015; Yang et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019). Two out
of the four studies based on mindfulness interventions indicated
the declined ReHo in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
and the increased ReHo in the right superior parietal
lobule
after the 8-week MBSR program (Xiao et al., 2019; Zhao et al.,
2019), demonstrating the possibility of changed local connectivity
after the mindfulness training. Additionally, Yang et al. reported
non-signiﬁcant ReHo changes after a 40-day mindfulness program
(Yang et al., 2016). Because of the inconsistency in the results of
these ReHo studies, it is unclear whether mindfulness practices
modulate the local connectivity, along with the distant connectivity
at the same time (the underlying information processing). To test
the brain-network reorganization in mindfulness, we postulated
three possible scenarios: (1) both FC and ReHo increase, indicating
an overall enhancement of
information processing irrelevant
of spatial scales; (2) FC increases, but ReHo remains the same,
implying an enhancement of long-distance communication alone
(between-network connectivity); and (3) FC increase, but ReHo
decreases, signifying a shift in resource allocation from local to
distant information processing. By examining FC at both the
local and distant levels, the diﬀerences in brain information

processing can be identiﬁed between the normal resting state and
the mindfulness practices.

We examined the distinct functional characteristics of diﬀerent
mindfulness practices, and the longitudinal training eﬀect (before
and after the MBSR program). Hence, a pre- and post-MBSR-
intervention design was implemented to investigate the brain
functionality post mindfulness training, and to account for the
possibility that meditation-naïve participants may be unable
to diﬀerentiate between breathing and body scan practices.
Regarding the network speciﬁcity of FC, studies have indicated that
interoceptive awareness (breathing and body scan) is associated
with the salience network (SN), especially on dACC and insula
(Singer et al., 2004; Sevinc et al., 2018; Gibson, 2019).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Participants

A total of 33 healthy Taiwanese adults, aged 28–68 years,
participated in this study. Candidates with prior meditation
experiences, or with a history of cardiovascular diseases, terminal
illness, or surgery involving metallic implants, were excluded from
the cohort. The cohort was randomly divided into an MBSR
group (MBSR; n = 18) and a waitlist control group (CTRL). One
CTRL group participant was unable to attend the second data
collection session and was thus excluded from the ﬁnal analysis
(n = 14). Prior to the experiment, written informed consents
was obtained from each participant, and the study protocol was
approved by the Joint Internal Review Board of Taipei Medical
University (N201905049).

2.2. Intervention: MBSR and CTRL

experiments twice. The ﬁrst data collection session was regarded as
the baseline (PRE), and the second data collection session was held
8 weeks later (POST). The MBSR group was enrolled in an 8-week
MBSR training program (Kabat-Zinn, 1994; Santorelli et al., 2017).
The MBSR course was taught by a licensed MBSR instructor. The
classes schedule consisted of eight 2.5-h weekly classes in addition
to a single day-long mindfulness workshop. These weekly classes
involved the development of several mindfulness-related skills,
dialogue, reﬂection on the home-based mindfulness practice, and
formal practice sessions. The participants were assigned daily
home-based mindfulness practices, which comprised both formal
and informal meditation activities. The formal activities included
body scan, mindful breathing, sitting meditation, mindful yoga,
walking meditation, mountain or lake meditation, and loving
kindness, required 45 min to complete each day. The participants
were required to complete a practice and information sheet.
The CTRL group was instructed to continue their usual
life
activities but not engaged in any mindfulness-related activities
(including religious activities) during the 8 weeks. After the
POST experiment, the CTRL group received an additional MBSR
program as compensation.

2.3. Experimental procedure

The participants completed three questionnaires: (1) the Five
Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) (Baer et al., 2006); (2)
the Diﬃculties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) (Gratz and
Roemer, 2004); (3) the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
(Buysse et al., 1989). An fMRI protocol was performed using a
3-T PRISMA scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at National
Taiwan University. Structural images were obtained using a high-
resolution magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo
(MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time [TR] = 2,000 ms; echo
time [TE] = 2.28 ms; ﬂip angle [FA] = 8◦; image dimensions:
192 × 256 × 256; voxel resolution: 1 × 1 × 1 mm3). Functional
images were obtained using a gradient-echo echo-planer imaging
(GE-EPI) sequence (TR: 2,000 ms; TE: 32 ms; FA: 77◦; image
dimensions: 64 × 64 × 33; voxel dimensions: 3.4 × 3.4 × 3.4 mm3).
The scanning session consisted of one T1-weighted anatomical
scan, followed by three functional scans. During the resting-state
(Resting) scan (5 min, 150 measurements), the participants were
instructed to lie still with their eyes closed, not to fall into sleep,
not dwell on one singular train of thoughts, and not to perform any
mindfulness practices. Then, another 5-min (150 measurements)
mindful breathing (Breath) was conducted, during which the
participants were asked to lay still with their eyes closed, and to
focus on the sensation of the breath passing through the nostrils
and the philtrum areas. Finally, a 5-min (150 measurements)
body scan practice (BodyScan), was performed, during which the
participants were instructed to lie still with eyes closed but to
this time focus on bodily sensations they were felt and remained
aware of these sensations without analysis or judgements to them.
The data of this study will be available on request from the
corresponding author.

2.4. fMRI analysis

Functional imaging data pre-processing was performed using
IClinfMRI (Hsu et al., 2018) in MATLAB R2014b (Mathworks Inc.,
Natick, MA) and analysis of functional neuroimaging (AFNI) (Cox,
1996). The procedure involved slice-timing correction, alignment
with the anatomical T1-weighted image, head motion correction
(censoring criteria: maximum displacement of > 3 mm or delta
displacement > 0.5 mm, and the maximum volume number
above the criteria was 21), de-spiking, linear detrending, nuisance
regression (the used regressors included motion parameters,
white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid), bandpass ﬁltering with
a range of 0.01–0.08 Hz, spatial smoothing (Gaussian kernel:
FWHM = 4 mm), and spatial normalization to the standard
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 template (voxel size:
2 mm3 × 2 mm3 × 2 mm3). The fMRI data of two participants
(both in MBSR:PRE) in the Breath session were neglected from
further analysis, one because of equipment malfunctioning on the
day of scanning, and the other because of excessive head motion.
Voxel-wise seed-based correlation analysis (seeding with 4-mm
radius) was employed to quantify the FC strengths of the SN. In
the SN, the seed locations were prescribed from the bilateral dorsal
anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, MNI: ± 6, 18, 28) (van der Werﬀ
et al., 2013), and the bilateral anterior insula (MNI: ± 38, 26, –5)

(Goveas et al., 2013). The voxel-wise correlation between the seeds
and the whole brain were calculated using Fisher’s Z transformation
to standardize them for further statistical analysis. Regarding the
local connectivity of ReHo, Kendall’s coeﬃcient of concordance
(KCC), a measurement of the correlation between each voxel and its
93 neighboring voxels (radius = 2.9 mm) over the time course, was
calculated with 3dReHo in AFNI (Taylor and Saad, 2013). Finally,
an MNI template was applied as the regional mask to generate a
standardized image of the entire brain for statistical analysis.

2.5. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
(version 5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
United States), and the signiﬁcance level was set as p < 0.05 with
multiple comparison of the false-discovery-rate (FDR) method.
Questionnaire scores (FFMQ, DERS and PSQI) were analyzed with
a 2-way mixed Analysis of Variance (group × time), followed by
post hoc tests with FDR correction. For the fMRI indices, POST–
PRE paired comparisons of FC and ReHo were performed based on
Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE: 5000 permutations)
(Smith and Nichols, 2009) for both MBSR and CTRL groups using
the FSL randomise (Winkler et al., 2014). From TFCE results, we
prescribed multiple regions of interest (ROIs) from the nearest Yeo
brain template (400 parcellations, noted as Yeo400) to extract FC
and ReHo values for ROI analysis (Yeo et al., 2011; Schaefer et al.,
2017). Subsequently, we performed the same 2-way mixed ANOVA
(group × time) and post hoc tests with FDR correction. To unveil
the time/training eﬀect in the MBSR group, an additional one-way
repeated-measure ANOVA (rm-ANOVA) with FDR correction was
also applied to the POST-PRE diﬀerences of connectivity indices
((cid:49)FC and (cid:49)ReHo) across the 3 conditions. At last, Pearson
correlation analysis was used for two evaluations: (1) [time eﬀect]
to calculate the correlation between the POST–PRE changes of
questionnaire scores ((cid:49)FFMQ and its ﬁve sub-scales, (cid:49)DERS, and
(cid:49)PSQI) and the those of functional indices ((cid:49)FC and (cid:49)ReHo); and
(2): [practice eﬀect] to estimate whether the correlations between
FC and ReHo (the hypothetical information processing) would
change across the three conditions (Resting, Breath and BodyScan),
before and after the training in the MBSR group.

3. Results

No signiﬁcant diﬀerences in age, sex, or educational level were
noted between the MBSR and CTRL groups (Table 1). Regarding
a potential MBSR training eﬀect, Table 2 presents that signiﬁcant
group × time interactions were found in FFMQ (F1,30 = 13.28,
p = 0.001) and DERS (F1,30 = 4.12, p = 0.05), but PSQI only
exhibited signiﬁcant time eﬀect (F1,30 = 4.88, p = 0.035) without
interaction. The post hoc tests exhibited that signiﬁcance POST-
PRE diﬀerences in the MBSR group, but not in the CTRL group.
In the MBSR group, all participants exhibited signiﬁcantly higher
FFMQ scores (t17 = 5.32, p < 0.001), in each of the ﬁve dimensions
(i.e., observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judgment,
and non-reaction) in the post-MBSR assessments (compared with
PRE). The MBSR group members exhibited signiﬁcant decreases in

DERS (t17 = 2.48, p = 0.047), indicating improvements in emotional
regulation. By contrast, in the CTRL group, no such changes in
questionnaire scores between the PRE and POST data collection
sessions were noted.

Figure 1 shows the SN-related FC maps exhibiting signiﬁcant
POST–PRE diﬀerences across the Breath and BodyScan conditions
(TFCE, FDR-corrected p < 0.05), and the signiﬁcant FC changes
were only observed in the MBSR group, not in the CTRL group.
During the Breath practice, the seed dACC yielded increased FC
in the bilateral occipital regions, including the bilateral fusiform,
lingual gyri, and the ROI ﬁndings were presented in Figure 2A
(Yeo400 2/3/4/202/203/204, group × time interaction: F1,30 = 0.08,
p = 0.776; rm-ANOVA across POST-PRE changes of (cid:49)FCRest,
(cid:49)FCBreath, (cid:49)FCBodyScan: F2,30 = 2.53, p = 0.096). During the
BodyScan practice, the left middle frontal gyrus (lMFG) exhibited
increased FC with the bilateral dACC (Figure 2B: Yeo400 181,
group × time interaction: F1,30 = 4.30, p = 0.012; rm-ANOVA:
F2,30 = 4.91, p = 0.014). With seeding at bilateral anterior
insula, the SN exhibited increased FC with the sensorimotor
network (SMN) during BodyScan after training (Figure 2C: Yeo400
33/34/35/230/231/232/233, group × time interaction: F1,30 = 3.21,
p = 0.08; rm-ANOVA: F2,30 = 3.41, p = 0.046). An increased FC of
the SN-related regions was noted during the mindfulness practices
(the third column of Figure 2), and such FC increase was not
apparent when participants were in the resting state. Regards with
ReHo, the right angular gyrus and superior parietal lobe (Yeo400
268/269/270) exhibited POST-PRE diﬀerence in the MBSR group
during the BodyScan (Figures 3A, B), but it did not show signiﬁcant
group × time interaction (Figure 3C, F1,30 = 2.14, p = 0.15, with
rm-ANOVA: F2,30 = 0.33, p = 0.72, Figure 3D). In general, the
results for both FC and ReHo suggest increased long-distance
connectivity and mostly unchanged local connectivity after the
MBSR training.

To demonstrate the time eﬀect, we estimate the association
between questionnaire score changes and connectivity changes
((cid:49)FC and (cid:49)ReHo). In the Breath condition, (cid:49)FCdACC−occipital
(Figure 2A) and (cid:49)ReHoangular (Figure 3B) both exhibited positive
correlation with (cid:49)Observe (r = 0.49, p = 0.005; and r = 0.50,
p = 0.005, respectively). In the BodyScan condition, (cid:49)FCInsula−SMN
(Figure 2C) exhibited positive correlation with (cid:49)Observe (r = 0.40,
p = 0.025), and (cid:49)ReHolMFG exhibited negative correlation with
(cid:49)DERS (r = –0.39, p = 0.028) and (cid:49)PSQI (r = –0.38, p = 0.032).
To demonstrate the practice eﬀect across the 3 conditions, Figure 4
illustrates scatter plots between FC and ReHo of the speciﬁc region
lMFG in the MBSR group, which highlights the relationships
between distant and local connectivity during the mindfulness
practices. Before the MBSR training (Figure 4A), FC and ReHo
only presented non-signiﬁcant correlations across the 3 conditions

but not in the resting state (r = –0.15, p = 0.56).

4. Discussion

Most studies employing mindfulness-based interventions have
focused on overall changes in participants’ subjective perceptions
and objective neurophysiology or immunology (Black and Slavich,
2017), and few have identiﬁed the brain functional diﬀerences
across diﬀerent mindfulness practices (Lumma et al., 2015; Kok
and Singer, 2017); However, each mindfulness practice yields
diﬀerential psychological characteristics and changes in brain
function. Therefore, this study investigated the diﬀerences among
resting, breathing and body scan states in terms of brain
connectivity. The results of both the questionnaires and brain FC
indices suggested that the practices of breathing and body scan
over the 8-week MBSR program allowed the participants to hone
their interoceptive awareness. In the questionnaire results, the
increased FFMQ scores indicated enhanced mindfulness level, and
the reduction in DERS and PSQI scores indicated improvements
in emotional regulation and sleep quality. The FC indices (both
FC and ReHo) eﬀectively reﬂected the eﬀects of the mindfulness
training as well. Speciﬁcally, the SN-FC linked to diﬀerent brain
regions between breathing and body scan, which was particularly
pronounced after the MBSR program (Figure 1). In the traditional
mindfulness training, the mindful breathing involves the single-
point ﬁxated attention to the exhalation/inhalation, either on the
nostrils or abdomen, without shifting the target. Body scan, in
contrast, involves the continuous attention shift on the physical
sensation, from one body part and to the next. Both of them
require the attention on the body sensations, but the distinction
between breathing and body scan might be from the attention
shift in the body scan, which might be the reason that the
more engagement between SN and the lMFG (part of DLPFC) in
the body scan, instead of the breathing. We also compared the
association between FC and ReHo and identiﬁed the underlying
information processing patterns of the resting state and the two
mindfulness practices. After the MBSR program, the elevated FC
and the sustained ReHo were observed during both breathing
and body scan compared to the resting state, indicating increased
distant connectivity along with maintenance of local connectivity.
This result supports the conjecture that a focus on mindfulness
task coincides with an increase in long-distance communications
(especially on between-network connectivity) without sacriﬁcing
the local communications (Figures 2, 3). After the MBSR training,
the stronger correlation between FC and ReHo at the body scan
compared with at the resting state (Figures 3, 4) indicates that
the body scan exercises the SN into an alternative information
processing pattern. To assess the time/training eﬀect, we found
that the altered FC or ReHo were signiﬁcantly associated with the
score changes of Observe, implying that the elevated connectivity,
in certain brain regions, contributed to the interoceptive perception
and emotion regulation. Although both mindfulness practices are
based on interoceptive awareness, the emphasis enhances both
long-distance and local information connectivity in the on speciﬁc

bodily sensations (breathing and body scan) yielded distinct spatial
patterns of the SN connectivity, contributing to diﬀerent facets
of mindfulness. As compared with the normal resting state,
both interoceptive mindfulness practices changed pattern of brain
communication (distant-local in Figure 4), but this diﬀerence was
only apparent after MBSR program. The functional speciﬁcity
of mindfulness practices oﬀers a novel viewpoint on the altered
information processing across mindfulness practices.

4.1. MBSR training effect

In standard MBSR programs, practitioners are taught the
breathing and body scan practices at the beginning of the formal
practice phase, indicating that these are fundamental techniques
for honing attention and interoceptive awareness. The body scan
practice involves attentional shifts to multiple body parts, whereas
the breathing practice encourages participants to focus on a single

bodily region. At the outset, when none of the participants had
prior knowledge of the two mindfulness techniques, their brain
function indices suggested no functional changes associated with
either technique relative to the resting condition. This was observed
in both the preprogram MBSR group (Figure 4) and the CTRL
group. However, after the 8-week program, signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the functional eﬀects of breathing and body scan in terms
of the SN connectivity were observed. SN exhibited enhanced
internetwork connectivity with the posterior brain during the

breathing practice and increased connectivity with the frontal
lobe during the body scan practice (Figure 1). By contrast, our
results did not reveal any change in SN connectivity during the
resting state, and it remained the same in the POST session

enhanced functional connectivity and increased interoceptive

engagements toward the interoceptive awareness, and the insula–
SMN connectivity might be attributable to the interaction between
interoceptive awareness and bodily sensations (Blatow et al., 2007;

group

similar durations

In this study, the two brain functional metrics, FC and ReHo,
were adopted to investigate underlying information processing
mechanisms from the perspective of distant and local neural
communications, respectively. After the MBSR program, although
an elevated FC was observed in SN, ReHo increased only in the
inferior parietal lobe during the body scan practice. Hence, long-
distance connectivity increased during the mindfulness practices,
while local connectivity remained the same. The results indicate
that the pattern of information processing in the brain shifted
toward one of the enhanced internetwork communications with
the preservation of local information communication during both
practices. Studies implementing meditation training programs
of
reported decreased ReHo during the
postintervention testing (Xiao et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019). Our
results suggest that the ReHo values remained largely unchanged
during the mindfulness practices. However, Figure 4 highlights
strong association between FC and ReHo (FC-ReHo correlation)
in the lMFG after training. Compared with the resting state, the
stronger positive FC-ReHo correlations during the breathing and
body scan practices indicates simultaneous increases in distant
and local connectivity during the mindfulness practices, with
levels varying by participant. Steiger’s Z test revealed stronger
FC-ReHo correlation in the dACC-lMFG connectivity during the
mindfulness practices compared with those recorded during resting
(p = 0.01 and 0.03 for BodyScan and Breathing, respectively). FC-
ReHo correlations were only discernible after the 8-week MBSR
program, and no signiﬁcant FC-ReHo correlation was observed
during the mindfulness practices (breathing and body scan) before
program attendance. Although the FC-ReHo correlation varied
by participant, these ﬁndings provide preliminary evidence that
mindfulness practices alter information processing associated with
SN connectivity in various brain regions. Future studies should
investigate the functional changes speciﬁc to other types of
mindfulness techniques and brain networks.

Previous literature mentioned that longitudinal mindfulness
training is related with the most prominent three networks—
SN, default-mode network (DMN), and executive control network
(ECN) (Sezer et al., 2022), but it was not reported for the practice-
speciﬁc FC changes after mindfulness training. In this work, we
targeted on the SN because the mindfulness practices—breathing
and body-scan—are related to the interoception (the function
of SN), instead of the mind-wandering (the function of DMN)

and goal-oriented execution (the function of ECN). Even though,
the other two networks were also evaluated in both mindfulness
practices and training. The DMN-FC presented signiﬁcant training
eﬀects on the FCPCC−superior temporal and FCinsula−PCC, but there
was a lack of signiﬁcance ﬁnding in the between-condition
comparisons (see Supplementary Figure 1 in Supplementary
material), but neither the training eﬀect nor the condition eﬀect
was found in the ECN-FC. The functional roles of DMN and ECN
in mindful breathing and body-scan await further investigations.

4.3. Limitations

This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was
small and may have had insuﬃcient statistical power because
of the two-group interventional design. Relatively, the CTRL
group exhibited no signiﬁcant longitudinal diﬀerences in both
behavioral and brain functional indices over the 8-week study
period, hence we did not present their imaging ﬁndings, so
as the between-group comparisons in the imaging data. The
between-group comparisons of the questionnaires were shown in
Supplementary Table 1, in which we found that the MBSR group
showed higher mindfulness scale and marginally lower diﬃculty
in emotion regulation compared to the CTRL group after MBSR
training. Studies with more sample size are warranted to verify
the practice speciﬁcity. Second, although the total home-based
practice times of all MBSR group were recorded (mean ± SEM:
43.3 ± 0.7 h), we did not identify a relationship between practice
time and the changes in FFMQ score (r = 0.18, p = 0.47) or
changes in the SN connectivity (|r| < 0.39, p > 0.11). This
might be attributable to the small sample size or considerable
between-individual diﬀerences. Third, we conducted the Resting,
Breath and BodyScan conditions in a ﬁxed order because most
of the mindfulness practitioners would start with the breathing
and then proceed to the body scan practice. In this study, the
practitioners were able to suﬃciently engage in the appropriate
mindfulness practice. However, without a counterbalanced design,
separating the eﬀects of the breathing practice from those of
the body scan practice was diﬃcult. Nevertheless, our ﬁndings
indicate spatial diﬀerences in the connectivity patterns of these
practices (Figure 1) after the MBSR training, which supports our
hypothesis that each mindfulness practice aﬀects brain functions
distinctively. Subsequent studies can improve the experimental
design by including a brief period of breathing at the start of all
mindfulness practices to address the practice interaction problem.
