It has been reported that up to 50% of patients receiving mental health services disengage 
from treatment, with adolescents and young adults being particularly at high risk. Even 
in the context of specialized services in youth mental health, such as early intervention 
programs for psychosis, disengagement rates remain high. There is a need for extensive 
and innovative efforts to address the issue of service disengagement in first-episode 
psychosis (FEP). A multi-dimensional understanding of the phenomenon of engagement 
can help to inform the development of strategies to address this important clinical issue. 
In our paper, we propose a conceptual framework for understanding service engagement, 
provide an overview of the issues pertaining to service engagement in FEP, and suggest 
future directions for research and practice.

L’engagement aux services dans le premier épisode de psychose : 
enjeux actuels et futures orientations
Des rapports indiquent que jusqu’à 50 % des patients qui reçoivent des services de santé 
mentale se désengagent de leur traitement, et que les adolescents et les jeunes adultes 
sont particulièrement à risque élevé. Même dans le contexte des services spécialisés 
en santé mentale des jeunes, comme les programmes d’intervention précoce pour la 
psychose, les taux de désengagement demeurent élevés. Il faut de vastes initiatives 
innovatrices pour aborder la question du désengagement des services au premier épisode 
de psychose (PEP). Une explication multidimensionnelle du phénomène de l’engagement 
peut contribuer à éclairer l’élaboration de stratégies en vue de résoudre cet enjeu clinique 
important. Notre article propose un cadre conceptuel pour comprendre l’engagement aux 
services, offrir un aperçu des questions relatives à l’engagement aux services dans le PEP, 
et suggérer des orientations futures pour la recherche et la pratique.

Service disengagement is a clinical challenge that continues 

to  afflict  the  mental  health  care  system.  It  has  been 
reported that up to 50% of patients receiving mental health 
services  disengage  from  treatment,  contributing  to  poor 
outcomes and escalating health care costs.1,2 Disengagement 
rates  in  mental  health  services  are  higher  than  those 
associated with other medical services.3 Currently, there are 
no universally accepted definitions for mental health service 
disengagement  and  engagement,  although  typically  they 
are  assessed  using  proxies,  such  as  attendance,  treatment 
drop  out,  therapeutic  alliance,  and  treatment  adherence.2–5 
However,  these  proxies  constitute  a  simplistic,  obverse 
approach  to  understanding  a  rather  complex  phenomenon, 
and do not necessarily provide insight on how to clinically 
and comprehensively address the challenge of engagement. 

It  is  important  to  understand  engagement  as  a  dynamic 
phenomenon that changes in relation to stages of treatment 
and patient needs, and, also, which takes into consideration 
developmental  factors.  In  our  paper,  we  propose  a 
conceptual  framework  for  understanding  engagement, 
provide  an  overview  of  the  issues  and  implications  of 
service  disengagement,  particularly 
in  young  people 
diagnosed  with  an  FEP,  and  suggest  future  directions  for 
research and practice to optimize engagement in FEP.

Understanding Engagement as a  
Multi-dimensional Construct
A  multi-dimensional  framework  can  help  to  highlight 
important  for  understanding 
diverse  factors 
engagement. A nuanced conceptualization could incorporate 

that  are

several  dimensions  related  to  engagement.  These  include 
engagement in relation to the continuum of care, for example, 
patients  may  minimally  engage  or  not  engage  at  the  onset 
of treatment, after a period of receiving treatment, and (or) 
during transfer of services; engagement in relation to types 
of  services  received,  for  example,  with  case  management 
services, medication interventions, or group therapies; pattern 
of  engagement,  for  example,  disengaging  from  services 
and  then  re-engaging  with  services  over  a  period  of  time; 
engagement in relation to duration, in other words, length of 
time participating in services before beginning to disengage; 
and patient and family perceptions of engagement. There is 
some evidence that the risk of disengagement is higher when 
patients  are  initiating  treatment  or  transferring  to  another 
service.5,6 This  last  dimension  highlights  the  importance  of 
striking  a  balance  between  engagement  efforts  of  service 
providers and perceived need and satisfaction of patients and 
families. For example, patients may attend appointments and 
participate in treatment, but may feel disempowered by, or 
dissatisfied  with,  the  services  they  receive,  which  can  be  a 
precursor to service disengagement.

Service Disengagement in First-Episode 
Psychosis
Adolescents and young adults are at high risk for disengaging 
from mental health services.1,2,7 This is of particular concern 
for  young  people  with  psychotic  disorders,  given  that  the 
peak onset for these disorders occurs during adolescence and 
young  adulthood,  and  given  that  the  outcome  trajectories 
are established relatively early, usually during the first 2 to 
5 years from illness onset.8 Specialized programs for FEP 
have  placed  a  specific  emphasis  on  service  engagement, 
with  the  ultimate  goal  of  achieving  symptom  remission, 
relapse  prevention,  and  social  recovery.9–14  Treatment  is 
delivered  by  a  multidisciplinary  team,  typically  using 
an  intensive  case  management  model,  and  includes 
medication (usually second-generation antipsychotics) and 
psychosocial  interventions  addressing  illness  education, 
lifestyle  management,  family  intervention  and  support, 
relapse prevention, and return to school and (or) work.9,11–13 
Emphasis is placed on interpersonal skills of clinicians in 
relation  to  working  with  young  people,  providing  needs-
based  treatment  in  youth-friendly  ways,11  and  providing 
care  within  low-stigma  environments,  wherein  hope  and 
personal potential are given primordial importance.9,13

While the benefits of SEI for FEP, compared with routine 
care, have been reported in numerous controlled and quasi-
experimental studies,14–23 engagement remains an ongoing 
issue  of  concern. A  recent  systematic  review  showed  that 
disengagement  rates  within  SEI  programs  for  FEP  varied 
from  20.5%  to  40%  across  studies,4  and  concluded  that

Clinical Implications

•  Service engagement is a complex and dynamic 

phenomenon that changes in relation to stages of 
treatment, patient needs, and developmental factors.

•  Adolescents and young adults, including those receiving 
specialized services for treatment of FEP, are at high 
risk for service disengagement.

•  There is a need for innovative efforts to address the 
issue of engagement in youth mental health service 
delivery. Peer support and new technologies may 
provide avenues for optimizing service engagement, but 
require further research on how these approaches can 
be integrated within models of care.

Limitations

•  This discussion is not based on a systematic review of 

the literature.

•  The general paucity of research in the field of service 
engagement, for example, from the perspectives of 
young patients, families, and service providers, limits a 
more detailed and nuanced analysis.

about  30%  of  people  disengage  from  treatment  despite 
ongoing  therapeutic  need.  The  issue  of  engagement  is 
present  across  the  continuum  of  care:  engaging  patients 
into  treatment,  sustaining  their  engagement  over  time, 
and  maintaining  engagement  during  the  transfer  from 
specialized SEI services to routine care.

Factors Influencing Disengagement Among 
Young People With First-Episode Psychosis 
Several  factors  influencing  disengagement  have  been 
reported  in  the  FEP  literature,  including  duration  of 
untreated  psychosis,  symptom  severity,  insight,  diagnoses 
of nonaffective psychosis, forensic history, substance use, 
and  the  presence  of  family  support,4,24,25  with  the  latter  2 
identified in a systematic review as being the most robust 
predictors.4 Some of these factors are consistent with those 
reported in the broader mental health literature on service 
engagement  (for  example,  forensic  history,  comorbid 
substance use, and limited insight).2

Ethnicity,  culture,  and  social  deprivation  have  been  given 
limited attention in relation to service engagement and yet 
may be of particular significance in many jurisdictions within 
Canada,  given  the  multi-ethnic  and  diverse  nature  of  the 
population in most urban settings. A review by Doyle et al4 
identified  only  2  studies  that  examined  ethnicity25,26  with 
inconsistent findings. However, within the broader mental 
health  literature,  ethnic  minority  background  and  social 
deprivation  (for  example,  homelessness)  are  commonly 
reported sociodemographic factors associated with service 
disengagement. Service engagement challenges may also be 
related to the mental health system, the level of integration 
between components of the system (primary, compared with 
specialized, care), patients’ willingness to accept treatment, 
the interpersonal skills of service providers,9 and the types 
of  interventions  delivered  in  relation  to  patients’  needs; 

www.LaRCP.cahowever, these types of service- and system-related factors 
have not been given much attention in the FEP literature.

Stakeholder Perspectives on Reasons for 
Disengagement 
While  the  FEP  literature  has  examined  characteristics 
of  patients  who  disengage  from  treatment,  less  research 
has  been  focused  on  the  reasons  for  disengagement2 
from  the  perspectives  of  patients,  their  families,  and 
service  providers.  For  example,  in  a  systematic  review 
on  disengagement  in  FEP,  none  of  the  studies  provided 
information  regarding  the  reasons  patients  dropped  out 
of  treatment.4 Within  the  broader  mental  health  literature, 
Smith  et  al27  conducted  qualitative  interviews  with  56 
participants diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective 
disorder,  or  bipolar  disorder  who  had  disengaged  from 
mental health care, and interviewed their service providers 
as well. Patients commonly expressed the following reasons 
for  disengagement:  services  not  being  relevant  for  their 
needs, lack of trust toward service providers, and believing 
they  were  not  ill.  Providers  highlighted  insight,  language 
and cultural barriers, and stigma as the main reasons. The 
differences  in  reasons  ascribed  by  these  2  groups  lend 
support  to  the  importance  of  examining  this  issue  from 
different perspectives.

Qualitative  investigations  with  young  people  diagnosed 
with  FEP  illustrate  that  they  have  a  multi-dimensional 
perspective of their recovery and well-being that includes 
illness-related,  social,  moral,  physical,  and  material 
or  financial  dimensions,  and  that  meaningful  activity 
engagement  is  also  core  to  this  process.28–31  However, 
service  providers  may  place  more  emphasis  on  symptom 
recovery  and  illness  education,  while  not  being  attuned 
to  addressing  other  aspects,  such  as  social,  physical,  and 
meaningful activity engagement.

Measuring Engagement in First-Episode 
Psychosis
Currently,  there  are  no  universally  accepted  definitions 
for  service  engagement  and  disengagement,  although 
typically 
they  are  assessed  using  proxies,  such  as 
attendance, therapeutic alliance, and treatment adherence.2,4 
Inconsistencies  in  how  these  concepts  are  operationally 
defined  and  measured  may  be  one  contributing  factor 
explaining  the  variation  of  disengagement  rates  seen 
across studies in the FEP literature.4 A common measure of 
service engagement used in the FEP literature is the Service 
Engagement  Scale.32  This  14-item  scale  was  developed 
based  on  a  review  of  the  literature  and  clinical  practice 
observations and then tested within the context of an FEP 
population. Service engagement is assessed by measuring 
provider  reports  of  client  availability,  collaboration,  help 
seeking,  and  adherence.  However,  the  extent  to  which 
young  people  with  FEP  would  agree  that  these  domains 
are salient for their engagement is unclear. This would be 
an  important  area  to  examine  through  the  pursuit  of  both

qualitative  and  quantitative  investigations;  however,  to 
date,  very  few  studies  have  focused  on  young  people’s 
experiences of early intervention services, even in general 
terms,33 let alone the factors considered to be most important 
for influencing their engagement with services across time.

Future Directions for Research and Practice
As a starting point to developing and implementing strategies 
to enhance engagement in FEP, future research could focus 
on  understanding  the  experiences  and  perspectives  of 
young  people,  families,  and  service  providers  in  relation 
to  service  engagement.  This  knowledge  can  help  inform 
the  development  of  an  operational  and  patient-oriented 
definition  of  service  engagement  that  can  then  be  used 
to  guide  future  studies.  Moreover,  qualitative  attention  is 
warranted  on  the  reasons  patients  have  for  engaging  and 
disengaging with services, factors each stakeholder group 
perceives as salient in relation to enhancing and hindering 
engagement,  and  the  extent  to  which  perspectives  on 
engagement  vary  among  patients,  families,  and  service 
providers.  Such  knowledge  can  be  used  to  examine  the 
extent  to  which  currently  available  measures  of  service 
engagement are patient- and family-oriented.

The  multi-dimensional  framework  we  described  above 
could inform the areas of inquiry for such an investigation, 
for  example,  consideration  of  patient  experiences  and 
perspectives of engagement in relation to different phases 
of  illness,  treatment,  and  in  relation  to  different  types  of 
services  they  receive.  Future  research  should  also  focus 
on  evaluating  the  effectiveness  and  cost-effectiveness  of 
strategies for enhancing service engagement. For example, 
examining whether peer support and leveraging information 
and  communication  technologies,  that  are  consistent  with 
the developmental culture of youth growing up in the 21st 
century, can help to enhance service engagement across the 
continuum of care for FEP.

Developing and Implementing Strategies 
to Enhance Engagement in First-Episode 
Psychosis 
Given  the  complex  and  dynamic  nature  of  engagement, 
a  multi-dimensional  approach  to  addressing  engagement 
is  warranted.  Engagement  strategies  can  be  targeted  to 
patients,  families,  service  providers,  and  the  system. 
Among patients and families, engagement strategies can be 
focused on early assessment of barriers to engagement and 
enhancing motivation for treatment (for example, perceived 
need for treatment, confidence in treatment, and perceived 
ability  to  participate  in  treatment).  Service  providers  can 
be  trained  on  how  to  assess  barriers  to  engagement  with 
patients  and  families  and  how  to  address  these  barriers 
using,  for  example,  brief  motivational 
interviewing 
techniques.34  Enhancing  service  providers’  capacities  in 
expressing caring, respectful, and nonjudgmental attitudes 
toward  patients  is  also  identified  as  a  strategy  in  the 
qualitative  literature  to  increase  engagement.27  Services

need to be flexible and clinicians may need to be flexible 
in how, when, and where services are delivered, and which 
components  of  services  are  delivered  over  time.  Service 
providers,  patients,  and  families  may  have  different  ideas 
on  which  issues  treatment  and  services  should  focus.  In 
this regard, engagement strategies would be to discuss and 
agree  on  common  goals  and  present  treatment  as  a  step 
toward achieving patients’ defined goals.

At  the  system  level,  engagement  strategies  can  target 
the  accessibility  of  services,  for  example,  in  relation  to 
transportation  assistance,  scheduling  flexibility,  location, 
and timing of service delivery.27 Services should be quick 
and easy to access, as opposed to the complex and traumatic 
pathways  many  young  patients  experience  in  the  process 
of  accessing  mental  health  services,  for  example,  through 
emergency  departments  and  judicial  systems.  Leveraging 
Internet, mobile technologies, and social media may provide 
an  avenue  to  address  service  accessibility.  However,  to 
date,  early  intervention  services  for  psychosis  have  been 
restricted to models of care that are delivered in person at 
a clinic or in the community. Given that more than 95% of 
adolescents and young adults use the Internet, increasingly 
through  mobile  devices,35 
technologies  offer 
opportunities  to  provide  services  through  a  nonintensive 
and arguably a more engaging format that is commensurate 
to  the  developmental  culture  of  young  people  growing 
up  in  the  21st  century.  Preliminary  surveys  with  patients 
with  FEP  indicate  that  they  are  enthusiastic  about  using 
Internet-based  interventions  as  part  of  the  mental  health 
services they receive.36 Research also suggests that people 
with psychotic disorders are receptive to using technology 
to connect with service providers as well as their peers.36–38 
This is further supported by studies showing that patients 
with  FEP  commonly  identify  peer  support  as  a  highly 
valued service.31,39,40

these 

Lindsey  et  al41  examined  40  randomized  controlled  trials 
for  strategies  targeting  the  engagement  of  families  in 
youth mental health services, which are also pertinent for 
this  discussion.  Among  22  strategies,  assessing  clients’ 
strengths and needs, making services convenient to access, 
providing  education  about  services,  providing  meaningful 
homework  tasks,  and  assessment  of  treatment  barriers 
showed the most promise in terms of impact, respectively. 
In  a  qualitative  study,27  patients  highlighted  that  having 
services that address needs from a holistic and instrumental 
perspective (for example, help to return to work and school) 
can  be  a  useful  strategy  for  engagement. Targeting  social 
and  vocational  outcomes  has  been  proposed  as  a  way 
to  better  meet  the  needs  of  young  people  in  international 
youth mental health reform initiatives.42 Indeed, it may be 
important for service providers to recognize and convey to 
patients and families that treatment is part and parcel of a 
broader process toward recovery that is ideally shaped and 
driven by patients’ personal and social goals. International 
reform  of  youth  mental  health  service  initiatives  have 
highlighted  other  key  features  to  better  meet  the  needs 
of  young  people,  including  youth  participation  in  service 

344   W   La Revue canadienne de psychiatrie, vol 60, no 8, août 2015

planning, implementation, evaluation, and research. Youth 
participation can help to inform the design of youth-friendly 
environments  and  services,  which,  in  turn,  can  facilitate 
engagement.41

Summary
Service engagement is a critical issue for SEI in psychiatry. 
The construct of engagement is complex, and we propose 
that  an  in-depth,  multi-dimensional  understanding  of 
engagement  be  considered.  We  have  highlighted  several 
elements of engagement that can be considered for research 
and  practice.  Service-,  system-,  and  cultural-level  factors 
warrant  further  attention,  and  future  research  should  also 
focus  on  understanding  the  issue  of  engagement  and 
disengagement from the perspectives of patients, families, 
and service providers. Developing knowledge on the issue 
of  engagement  from  the  perspectives  of  key  stakeholder 
groups can then help to assess the extent to which current 
practices and measures of service engagement are consistent 
with  stakeholder  perspectives.  Future  research  could  also 
focus  on  whether  peer  support  and  leveraging technology 
consistent  with  youth  developmental  culture  in  the  21st 
century can help to enhance service engagement across the 
continuum of care for FEP, and how these approaches can 
be integrated within new models of care.
