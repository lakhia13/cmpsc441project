Abstract 
Background:  Living with people diagnosed with a mental disorder is known to increase the risk of developing 
high levels of so–called “caregiver burden” in informal caregivers. In–depth analysis of this phenomenon and specific 
assessment tools for caregivers of patients diagnosed with Eating Disorders (EDs) are lacking. In this study, we aimed 
to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Caregiver Burden Inventory in EDs and employ this adapted tool in 
this category of caregivers.

Methods:  A cross–sectional study was conducted in the Eating Disorders outpatient unit of an Italian University 
hospital. Face and content validity were investigated by calculating standard Content Validity Indices (CVI-I and CVI-
S) after administering the Inventory to 6 expert nurses with at least 5 years of experience in mental health services 
assisting people diagnosed with Eating Disorders. Internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach’s α coefficient for 
the overall scale and subscales. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to explore latent constructs. The 
adapted CBI was then administered to 62 informal caregivers of ED patients.

Results:  The EFA yielded a 5–factor structure. The CVI-S was 97.2%; the Cronbach α coefficient was 0,90 (> 0.74 in 
each subscale). The median burden level in the experimental population was 40.0 [range 
range from 0 (no burden) to 96 (highest level of burden).

Conclusion:  The Caregiver Burden Inventory appears to be a valid and reliable instrument to assess caregiver burden 
in individuals diagnosed with Eating Disorders. Further research is needed to evaluate this tool’s efficiency in improv-
ing individually tailored interventions on families.

Plain English summary 
Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by the development of abnormal eating habits, dysregulation of body weight 
and/or body image distortion. The pervasiveness of EDs may significantly affect the life of patients’ caregivers in terms 
of emotional load, termed Caregiver Burden (CB). This may impact the quality of life of the entire family and promote 
conflicts which may in turn exacerbate ED behaviours. Among several international assessment tools to measure 
CB, the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) is perhaps the most widely employed. However, this tool has never been

specifically tested in caregivers of ED patients. Here we show that CBI can adequately quantify burden in this cat-
egory of caregivers. Systematic use of this instrument can support healthcare workers who aim to address the carer’s 
discomfort and promote a focused monitoring of subjects with increased risk, in order to adequately plan targeted 
intervention programs.

Introduction
Eating  Disorders  (EDs)  are  complex  mental  disor-
ders  defined  by  disturbed  eating  behaviours,  distorted 
beliefs,  and  extreme  concerns  about  food,  eating  and 
body  image,  shape  or  weight.  The  prevalence  of  these 
conditions is rising in many countries and recent stud-
ies  suggest  that  EDs  are  not  rare  in  the  general  popu-
lation  [1,  2].  Furthermore,  EDs  are  associated  with 
decreased  quality  of  life,  increased  risk  of  depression 
and  substance  abuse  [1].  The  frequency  and  severity 
of  clinical  manifestations,  and  associated  psychiatric 
and  somatic  comorbidities  [3,  4]  lead  to  high  levels  of 
disability  and  increased  mortality  rates  [5].  Treatment 
approaches  for  EDs  include  behavioural  interven-
tions,  psychological  and  pharmacological  management 
and  often  require  a  multidisciplinary  team  composed 
of  psychiatrists,  physicians,  psychologists,  nurses, 
dietitians,  and  social  workers.  In  this  context,  family 
involvement and informal caregiver support are known 
to have a fundamental role in building and maintaining 
patients’  therapeutic  alliance  and  medical  adherence 
[6,  7].  However,  prolonged  caregiving  activity,  albeit 
necessary to support patients as well as healthcare pro-
fessionals,  is  known  to  affect  the  caregiver’s  life  sub-
stantially [8, 9]. The combination of physical, emotional, 
and  social  pressures  can  lead  to  a  condition  of  intense 
distress  and  psychological  discomfort  called  Caregiver 
Burden  (CB),  which  can  severely  impact  the  quality  of 
life  of  the  entire  family  [10].  CB  may  fuel  a  disturbed 
relationship among family members, which may in turn 
exacerbate ED behaviours, as proposed by the recently 
revised  Cognitive-Interpersonal  Maintenance  Model 
of  Anorexia  Nervosa  (AN)  [11,  12].  According  to  this 
model,  emotional  reactions  with  elevated  anxiety  and 
depression,  psychological  distress  and  dysfunctional 
responses  to  the  illness,  can  cause  divisions  amongst 
family  members,  develop  divergent  forms  of  reactive 
expressed  emotion  and  act  as  maintaining  factors  for 
the patient’s ED.

Although  evidence  on  the  burden  of  ED  patients’ 
informal  caregivers  abounds,  specific  quantification 
instruments  are  lacking  [13].  Several  different  assess-
ment tools aiming to measure CB are available interna-
tionally,  among  which  the  Caregiver  Burden  Inventory 
(CBI)  [14]  is  perhaps  the  most  widely  employed.  Fur-
thermore, the CBI is a multidimensional questionnaire 

used  to  quantify  burden  in  different  aspects  of  a  car-
egiver’s  life,  exploring  five  different  dimensions:  time 
dependence, developmental, physical, social, and emo-
tional burden.

A large literature describes the use of the CBI to iden-
tify  burden  in  caregivers  of  people  affected  by  Alzhei-
mer’s disease and related dementias [15] or with cancer, 
but  this  tool  has  never  been  employed  in  the  assess-
ment of ED patients’ caregivers. Therefore, the aims of 
this study were to assess the psychometric properties of 
an adapted version of the CBI and to employ it for the 
identification  and  quantification  of  burden  in  this  cat-
egory of caregivers.

Methods
Participants

Six expert nurses (with at least 5 years of previous assis-
tance  to  people  diagnosed  with  Eating  Disorders)  who 
work in the Department of Mental Health and Addiction 
of the San Paolo University Hospital in Milan, Italy were 
recruited to evaluate the scale’s face and content validity.

A non-probabilistic sample of informal caregivers was 
then  recruited  among  ED  patients  who  consecutively 
accessed the Eating Disorders clinic of the San Paolo Uni-
versity Hospital from May 1st to July 31st, 2019. This unit 
serves a population of approximately 350,000 inhabitants 
in  the  South  of  Milan.  The  caregiver  could  be  any  rela-
tive, partner or friend, excluding professional caretakers. 
Inclusion  criteria  were  (i)  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  any 
ED  formulated  by  an  expert  clinician  (SB)  according  to 
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, 
5th edition [16] and (ii) at least one year of experience as 
caregiver  for  the  recruited  subject.  A  total  of  sixty–two 
caregivers  accepted  to  participate  (100%  response  rate). 
Forty–two  (67,7%)  were  married,  17  (27,4%)  separated 
and 3 (4,8%) unmarried. Forty (64,5%) carers had at least 
one  other  dependent  child  in  addition  to  the  one  diag-
nosed  with  an  ED.  Thirty–eight  (61,3%)  caregivers  were 
mothers,  23  (37,1%)  were  fathers  and  only  one  was  a 
sister.  The  median  duration  of  caregiving  was  4,5  years 
[range = 3  to  5].  Of  the  patients  diagnosed  with  an  ED 
(58  females  and  4  males),  40  (64,5%)  were  diagnosed 
with AN, 16 (25,8%) Bulimia Nervosa (BN), 4 (6,4%) with 
Unspecified  Feeding  and  Eating  Disorder  and  2  (3,2%) 
with Binge-Eating Disorder.

Questionnaire

In its original version, the Caregiver Burden Inventory is 
a  24-item,  self-administered  questionnaire  [14].  Each  of 
the 24 items allows a Likert-scale response ranging from 
0 (“not at all relevant”) to 4 (“very relevant”), with a total 
score  in  the  0–96  range.  Developed  as  a  diagnostic  tool 
for  professional  caregivers  of  confused  and/or  disori-
ented elderly people, the CBI yields five distinct sub-fac-
tors which address different aspects of caregiver burden: 
time  dependence,  developmental,  physical,  social,  and 
emotional  burden.  Briefly,  the  time-dependent  bur-
den  factor  describes  the  burden  due  to  restrictions  on 
the  caregiver’s  time;  the  developmental  burden  factor 
describes  the  caregiver’s  feelings  of  being  "off-time"  in 
their development with respect to their peers; the physi-
cal burden factor describes caregivers’ feelings of chronic 
fatigue and damage to physical health; the social burden 
factor  describes  caregivers’  feelings  of  role  conflict  (a 
caregiver  may  argue  with  a  spouse  or  with  other  family 
members over how to manage the care receiver’s needs); 
the  emotional  burden  factor  describes  caregivers’  nega-
tive feelings toward their care receivers, which may result 
from the patient’s unpredictable and often unfathomable 
behaviour.

The inventory showed good internal reliability, moder-
ate  intercorrelations  of  subscales,  and  high  factor  load-
ings,  making  it  a  practical  tool  for  the  assessment  of 
caregiver burden [14].

Procedures

Each  participating  nurse  received  a  document  with  the 
definition  of  informal  caregiver  burden,  information  on 
the study purpose and the CBI. Nurses’ responses to the 
CBI were used to calculate the Content Validity Index of 
each single item (CVI-I) and of the whole scale (CVI-S). 
At the end of the questionnaire, two additional questions 
allowed  the  participant  to  communicate  other  relevant 
aspects that were not in the questionnaire and to report 
an  overall  opinion  about  clarity  and  exhaustiveness  of 
the  scale.  Two  items  were  modified  according  to  these 
observations:  Item  4  “I  have  to  help  my  care  receiver 
with many basic functions (dressing, washing, use of toi-
let)” was changed to “I have to help my care receiver with 
many  basic  functions  (dressing,  washing,  use  of  toilet, 
meal  assistance)”;  item  5  “I  don’t  have  a  minute’s  break 
from  my  caregiving  chores”  was  changed  to  “I  can’t  get 
enough free time from my caring chores”.

The  adapted  tool  was  then  administered  to  the  sam-
ple  of  caregivers.  Each  recruited  caregiver  received  a 
file including study information, consent form, the CBI 
and  a  questionnaire  for  the  collection  of  socio-demo-
graphic data; all documents, independently filled out by 

each participant in a restricted area of the clinic, were 
then placed inside a sealed ballot box to guarantee full 
anonymity.

Statistical analysis

An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out to 
identify the factor structure of the inventory. CBI-I and 
CBI-S were used to calculate the content validity of the 
scale;  α  Cronbach  coefficient  was  calculated  to  evalu-
ate  the  internal  consistency.  Factors  were  extracted 
with the principal component method, chosen accord-
ing to Kaiser’s criteria (eigenvalue > 1) and rotated with 
the  Varimax  algorithm.  Factor  loading  was  assessed 
according to Stevens’ criterion.

Prior  to  the  analysis,  Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin  (KMO) 
test  and  Bartlett’s  test  of  Sphericity  were  employed 
to  test  the  variables’  sampling  adequacy.  The  KMO 
test  measures  sampling  adequacy  for  each  variable  in 
the  model  and  the  complete  model.  This  statistic  is  a 
measure  of  the  proportion  of  variance  that  might  be  a 
common variance among variables, ie. which might be 
caused  by  underlying  factors.  Bartlett’s  test  of  Sphe-
ricity  is  used  to  confirm  that  the  observed  correlation 
matrix  diverges  significantly  from  the  identity  matrix, 
ie. a matrix in which all of the values along the diagonal 
are 1 and all other values are 0, making it suitable for a 
data reduction technique such as EFA.

Factor  loadings  were  compared  to  Stevens’  cut–off, 
which  is  a  value  computed  from  the  sample  size,  indi-
cating  the  minimum  acceptable  factor  loading.  The 
median,  first  and  third  quartile  scores  and  ranges  of 
scores for each domain as well as the overall scale were 
verified. All analyses were conducted with SAS® 9 (SAS 
Inc., Cary, USA).

Results
Psychometric properties of the adapted CBI

The Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin test (0.74) and the Bartlett test 
correlation  matrix  (p < 0.01)  confirmed  adequacy  of 
the data and sample size to carry out a factor analysis. 
Orthogonal  factor  rotation  yielded  clear  separation  of 
the  five  factors  described  in  the  original  scale  version 
(Table  1).  All  factor  loadings  were  above  Stevens’  cut-
off and the model explained 63.9% of the total variance.
Cronbach’s  α  was  satisfactory  (0.90);  α  coefficients 
were  then  calculated  for  each  single  subscale  of  CBI 
with  values  ranging  from  0.74  and  0.91.  According  to 
the  correlation  table,  no  item  reversing  was  necessary 
compared  to  the  original  scale  version.  The  content 
validity  index  of  the  instrument  (CVI-S)  was  97.2% 
(CVI-I always ≥ 0.80).

Discussion
The  modified  CBI  demonstrated  good  psychometric 
properties  to  evaluate  Caregiver  Burden  in  patients 
diagnosed  with  an  ED.  The  CVI-S  score  obtained  by 
interviewing the expert nurses panel confirmed content 
validity  of  the  scale,  which  was  also  found  to  be  sim-
ple,  clear  and  understandable.  As  its  original  version, 
the  modified  CBI  provides  a  multidimensional  view  of 
burden  and  identifies  the  same  subdomains  through 
its  subscales  in  EDs.  Specifically,  the  Time-dependent 
Burden  factor  may  reflect  the  caregiver’s  time  con-
sumption  in  assisting  patients  across  meal  times  and 
vigilant  monitoring  of  eating  and  maladaptive  behav-
iour (elimination, physical overactivity) on the caregiv-
er’s time. The Developmental Burden factor may reflect 
caregivers’  feelings  of  slower  and  somewhat  faulty 
development  compared  to  their  peers.  Onset  of  EDs 
often  occurs  during  early  adolescence  and  may  have  a 
substantial  impact  over  the  life  course  of  a  caregiver. 
Although specific research on caregivers of ED patients 
is lacking, the Physical Burden factor reflects subjective 

Bertelli et al. Journal of Eating Disorders           (2022) 10:34 

Page 5 of 6

complaints  regarding  physical  health,  on  which  infor-
mal  caregiving  towards  dependent  friends  or  family 
members is known to have a detrimental influence. The 
Social  Burden  factor  may  reflect  the  conflicts  emerg-
ing  with  other  relatives  and  friends  over  the  best  way 
to address the receiver’s needs. Indeed, individuals with 
EDs often elicit contradictory feelings on the extent to 
which  support  and  limitations  to  maladaptive  behav-
iour should be enforced by the informal caregiver. The 
Emotional Burden factor describes caregivers’ negative 
feelings, which may result from the patient’s unpredict-
able and often unfathomable behaviour.

The  acceptable  values  of  Cronbach’s  α—for  the  scale 
and  for  each  domain—confirmed  the  internal  consist-
ency of the adapted CBI. Indeed, only one previous study 
on  the  Italian  version  of  the  original  CBI  had  identified 
four  factors  due  to  the  conflation  of  the  Developmental 
and Physical burden dimensions [15].

In  our  clinical  sample,  caregiver  burden  appeared  to 
primarily reflect a reduction of personal time and devel-
opment. Indeed, vigilant monitoring of eating and mala-
daptive  behaviour  (elimination,  physical  overactivity) 
and direct assistance across meal times may significantly 
impact  caregivers’  everyday  life.  Further  research  is 
needed to establish whether these aspects vary with the 
severity and stage of illness, and if they can be modulated 
with tailored interventions.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies used 
the  CBI  to  quantify  burden  in  caregivers  of  individuals 
with an ED. The eating disorders symptom impact scale 
(EDSIS), a 24-item self-report questionnaire is currently 
only available in English [17] and Spanish [18]. The Fam-
ily Problems Questionnaire [19] is a self-report measure 
with a a good level of reliability that has been employed 
to compare burden in families of AN and BN [20]. How-
ever,  lack  of  use  outside  of  Italy  limits  the  possibility  of 
comparing  findings  with  those  reported  from  interna-
tional groups.

Although  developed  for  caregivers  of  elderly  patients, 
the CBI has also extensively been used to assess caregiver 
burden  in  parents  of  children  with  metabolic  [21]  and 
neurodevelopmental [22, 23] disturbances, and in families 
of young people presenting with First Episode Psychosis 
[24]. Our study confirms the possibility of employing this 
tool  in  caregivers  of  relatively  young  patients  with  psy-
chiatric  disturbances,  perhaps  suggesting  the  possibil-
ity of future comparative studies across clinical samples. 
Indeed, CB is known to be similar in the families of indi-
viduals with ED and psychosis [25], although some find-
ings  suggest  the  impact  of  caregiving  for  patients  with 
EDs  may  be  even  higher  than  those  with  Schizophrenia 
and  Depression  [26].  Previous  research  on  CB  with  ED 
patients  employed  the  Depression  Anxiety  Stress  Scales 

(DASS) or questionnaires based on the related construct 
of  Expressed  Emotion  within  the  patient’s  family  [13]. 
However,  these  instruments  do  not  specifically  address 
the  construct  of  CB  and  are  likely  to  measure  related, 
albeit  different  characteristics  of  caregivers’  distress. 
Disentanglement  of  these  constructs  is  likely  to  clarify 
the  mechanisms  that  lead  caregiver  distress  to  maintain 
the  illness  [12].  Indeed,  novel  approaches  to  the  treat-
ment  of  EDs  centralize  psychoeducational  interventions 
on  caregivers  to  moderate  emotionally  driven  responses 
such  as  criticism,  overprotection,  accommodating  and/
or enabling behaviours that have been shown to maintain 
the illness [27]. Our findings suggest that nurses and cli-
nicians  should  pay  special  attention  to  caregiver  burden 
and the administration of the CBI alone could be a prac-
tical  choice  to  identify  contributing  factors.  However, 
future research is needed to identify a CBI cut-off score 
for further assessment and intervention.

Limitations

This  study  aimed  to  offer  a  preliminary  overview  of 
the  CB  phenomenon  in  a  specialized  outpatient  unit. 
However,  the  reduced  sample  size  should  certainly  be 
considered  the  main  limitation  and  a  larger,  possibly 
multicentric  study  is  necessary  to  confirm  our  findings. 
Nonetheless,  the  significant  levels  of  CB  detected  in  a 
median  4.5  years  of  caregiving  suggest  the  relevance  of 
the  phenomenon  and  the  need  to  address  it.  Another 
limitation  was  the  lack  of  a  standardized  interview  to 
exclude psychiatric diagnoses in caregivers. Future stud-
ies are needed to clarify the relationship between CB and 
the socio-demographic and psychological characteristics 
of  patients’  caregivers.  A  more  thorough  understanding 
of this connection is fundamental to the implementation 
of a preventive intervention path.

Conclusions
The  study  results  support  the  usefulness  of  CBI  for  the 
assessment  of  caregiver  burden  in  patients  diagnosed 
with  EDs.  The  systematic  use  of  this  instrument  can 
support  physicians  and  nurses  in  assessing  the  carer’s 
discomfort  and  a  focused  monitoring  of  subjects  with 
increased  risk,  to  adequately  plan  targeted  intervention 
programs.

Future  research  should  address  whether  early  identifi-
cation of burden and distress can be used to shape novel 
interventions  with  an  impact  on  the  psychopathological 
mechanisms underlying EDs.
