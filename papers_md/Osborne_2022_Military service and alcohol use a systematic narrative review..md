Background  Despite  research  highlighting  the  role  of  alcohol  in  military  life,  specifically  in  relation  to  mental 
health and certain combat experiences, there is no synthesised evidence looking at the relationship 
between military service and alcohol use.

Aims 

Methods 

Results 

To synthesize and examine evidence exploring the relationship between military service and alcohol 
use.

Six databases were examined across a 10-year period. Papers were included if they involved a mili-
tary population and focused on alcohol use. From 4046 papers identified, 29 papers were included 
in the review.

Military  characteristics  and  experience  were  linked  to  high  levels  of  alcohol  use  across  military 
populations. Societal and cultural factors also played a role in alcohol use in military populations. 
Predatory behaviour of alcohol establishments, pressures to conform, an acceptance of alcohol use, 
and the role of religious services and military affiliated social networks were all considered. Excessive 
drinking impacted physical and mental health. Those diagnosed with PTSD and associated symp-
toms appeared to have greater alcohol use.

Conclusions  This review identified certain characteristics and experiences of military service that are associated 
with higher levels of alcohol use. It is important to identify risk factors for alcohol misuse to develop 
appropriate policy, targeting prevention.

Key words  Alcohol drinking; military personnel; military health; review.

Introduction

Alcohol has played a prevalent, historic role in military 
life, where, internationally, it has been used as a means of 
mediating stress, both in theatre and in the aftermath of 
battle [1]. Used in social bonding and comradeship [1], 
drinking has become a common and accepted behaviour 
in military culture, surpassing alcohol use in the general 
population [2, 3]. Beliefs on acceptable drinking norms 
can  be  influenced  and  reinforced  when  exposed  to  the 
military social environment [4].

The Motivational Model of Alcohol Use indicates con-
sumption of alcohol may be used to cope, and to ‘regu-
late the quality of their emotional experience’ [5 p. 990]. 
These  reasons  for  alcohol  misuse  have  also  been  evi-
denced  in  serving  military  and  veteran  populations  [4]. 
However, regardless of the potential advantages of alcohol 

consumption  socially,  especially  in  enhancing  positive 
emotional experiences, problems develop when alcohol is 
misused. For military service members, exposed to highly 
stressful situations, behaviour around long-term alcohol 
use can be affected by the accepted social norms around 
higher levels of alcohol use for recreation and coping [4].
Research  has  suggested  that  alcohol  may  serve  as  a 
coping mechanism after traumatic events, where deploy-
ment has been associated with increased rates of alcohol 
use  or  problem  drinking  [6].  Drinking  to  excess  may 
have a negative impact on mental and physical health [7], 
functional impairment [8], troop readiness [9], suicidal 
ideation  [10]  and  the  perpetrator  in  military  sexual  as-
saults [11]. Furthermore, the UK Armed Forces have ex-
pressed concerns that ‘excessive drinking can undermine 
operational  effectiveness,  leave  soldiers  unfit  for  duty, 
and damage trust and respect within the team’ [12 p. 12].

Key learning points

What is already known about this subject
•  Historically alcohol has had an integral role in military life and has been seen as an acceptable behaviour in so-

cial bonding and comradeship.

•  Alcohol misuse in military populations has been associated with a negative impact on social, physical, and psy-

chological health.

•  Literature reviews to date have focussed on comorbidity of PTSD and alcohol misuse, wider mental health and 
Gulf and Iraq/Afghanistan war veterans, no systematic reviews of literature have considered the wider experi-
ences of alcohol use and military service.

What this study adds
•  Military-specific traits and experiences such as, service type, rank and deployment status are linked to higher 

levels of alcohol use in military populations across multiple countries.

•  There appears to be an over-reliance on self-report questionnaires for the assessment of alcohol use in a mili-
tary population focussing on symptom severity, with a paucity of research considering personal experiences and 
meanings ascribed to alcohol use.

•  The systematic narrative review has brought together a body of knowledge on alcohol use in a military popula-

tion and the synthesis of this literature provides an evidence base to help inform future policy.

What impact this may have on practice, policy or procedure
•  There are specific characteristics strongly associated with military service that impact alcohol use, it is important 
to identify these ‘risk factors’ to mitigate the impact on operational effectiveness and workplace cohesion by 
developing appropriate and targeted prevention policies.

•  Mental ill health and harmful levels of alcohol use in military personnel co-exist and more specifically, this cre-
ates internal stigma making this population particularly reticent to seek help for both alcohol and mental health 
problems and therefore harder to identify.

•  The systematic narrative review has highlighted a lack of consistency in the tools and measures used to assess 
alcohol use in a military population and suggests a need for a consensus of assessment measures in practice and 
wider research.

Alcohol  use  and  military  service  are  of  great  im-
portance  and  a  public  health  issue.  However,  there  are 
no  systematic  reviews  of  literature  that  focuses  on  the 
wider,  overall  experiences  of  alcohol  use  and  military 
service.  Existing  systematic  review  evidence  stresses 
the  important  role  of  alcohol  in  military  life,  particu-
larly focussing on the comorbidity of PTSD and alcohol 
misuse  [13],  Gulf  and  Iraq/Afghanistan  war  veterans 
[14], or as part of systematic reviews with a wider mental 
health  focus  [15]. Therefore,  this  study  employs  a  sys-
tematic narrative review that aims to explore the relation-
ship between military service and alcohol use.

Methods

To  appraise  evidence  from  multiple  sources  including 
qualitative  and  quantitative  research,  and  to  ensure  an 
inclusive  systematic  search  without  bias,  a  systematic 
narrative  review  strategy  was  employed  [16].  Suitable 
databases  were  searched,  identifying  published  peer-
reviewed evidence (Table 1).

Research papers on alcohol use with a military sample 
published prior to March 2021 were considered. Since the 
Global War on Terrorism began in 2001, there has been 

an  increase  in  combat  deployments  of  military  service 
personnel  from  many  nations  across  the  globe.  During 
this period, warfare has evolved, and the world has seen 
a more complex form of modern warfare, adapting and 
modernising to become more technologically advanced. 
This  has  also  resulted  in  a  change  in  the  nature  of  de-
ployments, impacting the role of military service in the 
lives  of  serving  personnel.  Deployments  are  dangerous 
and  stressful  for  military  personnel  and  combat  stress, 
specifically  experienced  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  has 
been associated with alcohol misuse [14]. Consequently, 
only papers published after 2001 have been considered 
in this review to ensure an accurate representation of the 
role military service has on alcohol misuse.

The exclusion criteria included papers that were un-
available  in  English,  focussed  on  treatments  or  inter-
ventions  for  alcohol  problems,  or  the  sample  included 
veterans.  Papers  on  substance  use  were  included,  only 
if they reported alcohol use. The PICO framework was 
used to develop the search terms (Table 2). Truncation 
and wildcard search strategies were utilised.

Veterans  and  ex-service  were  included  as  search 
terms  to  ensure  the  maximum  number  of  papers  were 
returned.  However,  only  papers  with  a  serving  military 
population  were  included  in  the  review. The  ex-service 

A. K. OSBORNE ET AL.: MILITARY SERVICE AND ALCOHOL USE 315

military population was excluded because of additional, 
non-military specific, factors that exist that may impact 
alcohol use such as their experience of transition out of 
the military. Following the search of the databases, 4046 
papers were returned (Figure 1).

A full-text search was carried out on 83 papers to de-
termine the suitability for inclusion in the review. To ap-
praise  the  quality  of  papers  included  in  the  review,  the 
Critical  Appraisal  Skill  Programme  [17]  tool  was  con-
sulted.  Fifty-four  papers  were  excluded  due  to  their 
focus on a veteran population or alcohol use not specific 
to  military  service.  No  further  papers  were  identified 
through  reference  and  citation  searches.  Consequently, 
29 papers were included in this review.

Thematic analysis was used to analyse the papers and 
generate themes. The six steps of Braun and Clarke [18] 
were  followed:  familiarization  with  the  data,  generation 
of initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, 
defining and naming themes, and producing the report.

Results

Twenty-nine  papers  were  included  in  this  review  (Table 
3). There were 22 studies represented across all 29 papers.

Related  Behaviours  study  [28,  35]  and  the  Prevalence, 
Incidence and Determinant of PTSD and Other Mental 
Disorders (PID-PTSD+3) study [40–42].

Seventeen  papers  had  samples  from  the  US  [6,  20, 
21, 23, 25, 26, 28, 31–38, 43, 44], six from the UK [2, 
8,  19,  27,  29,  39],  three  from  Germany  [40–42],  one 
from Norway [24], one from Nigeria [30] and one from 
Angola [22]. Six papers looked at alcohol in the military 
for male personnel only [19, 26, 27, 41–43], whereas 21 
papers  considered  male  and  female  personnel  [2,  6,  8, 
20,  23–25,  28–40,  44]. Two  papers  did  not  specify  the 
gender of their sample [21, 22].

Eleven  papers  considered  Active  Duty/Regular  per-
sonnel  [2,  6,  8,  19,  24,  28,  30,  35,  39]  including  two 
looking  at  special  operations  [23,  38]. Ten  papers  con-
sidered  National  Guard/Reserve  personnel  [21,  25,  26, 
31,  32,  34,  36,  37,  43]  and  four  papers  considered  all 
serving personnel [33, 40–42]. Five papers did not spe-
cify the enlistment type of the military personnel in their 
sample [20, 22, 27, 29, 44]

Of the 29 papers, 28 were quantitative [2, 8, 19–44] 

and one paper was qualitative [6].

Four themes were identified in the literature: Military 
Characteristics  and  Alcohol  Use,  Consequences  of 
Deployment  on  Alcohol  Use,  Implication  of  Mental 
Health  on  Alcohol  Use  and The  Role  of  Cultural  and 
Social Factors on Alcohol Use.

Fifteen papers considered military characteristics as-
sociated  with  alcohol  use  in  their  military  samples  [2, 
19, 20, 22–25, 27, 29, 30, 33–35, 40, 41]. Hooper et al. 
[29] surveyed 1382 military personnel and reported they 
had a higher number of units of alcohol consumed per 
week than the suggested ‘low risk’ drinking threshold. In 
comparison to the general population, Fear, Iversen [2] 
identified a greater percentage of hazardous drinkers in a 
military population than in the general population.

Only two papers considered the potential differences 
in alcohol consumption between men and women. Fear 
et  al.  [2]  suggested  a  gender  difference  in  hazardous 
drinking where there were a greater number of male haz-
ardous drinkers (67% military, 38% general population) 
than  female  hazardous  drinkers  (49%  military,  16%

general  population).  However  Fadum  et  al.  [24]  noted 
that high alcohol consumption did not differ much be-
tween  military  women  and  men.  Furthermore,  no  sig-
nificant difference in high alcohol consumption between 
military and civilian women was found [24].

Papers  in  this  review  also  considered  the  conse-
quences of heavy drinking whilst serving in the military. 
For personnel that had deployed on operational service, 
a  greater  volume  of  drinking  was  linked  to  difficulties 
at  home  during  and  post-operational  deployment  [19, 
41].  In  addition  to  demonstrating  a  high  incidence  of 
alcohol use in the military, the papers reported evidence 
of associations between alcohol use and factors such as 
age, service type, active deployment, combat exposure, 
mental health, and relationship status. In UK, US and 
German military populations, heavy drinking has been 
associated  with  holding  a  lower  rank,  being  younger, 
being single, being in the Naval service or Army, being 
deployed to Iraq, not having children, being a smoker, 
having a combat role and having a parent with a drink 

or  drug  problem  [2,  19,  23,  25,  35,  41].  Most  papers 
examined such risk factors in soldiers from US or UK 
military  populations,  potentially  providing  limited  ap-
plicability to military populations in developing nations 
[22]. Interestingly, in contrast to US and UK findings, 
Cheng et al. [22] identified older age rather than younger 
age as a significant risk factor for alcohol use in Angola.
Literature suggests that, in the UK, levels of drinking 
are higher in the Army than other branches of the mili-
tary  [2].  Different  subcultures  of  drinking  within  indi-
vidual branches have been attributed to these variations 
across  the  military,  especially  under  circumstances  that 
involve  personnel  taking  part  in  team  activities  where 
there  may  be  pressure  from  peers  to  drink  alcohol  to 
relax  and  debrief  [2]. These  situations  that  involve  so-
cialising and alcohol use are a common feature of Armed 
Forces  life  and  particularly  in  the  Royal  Navy.  In  this 
regard,  Henderson,  Langston  [27]  reported  significant 
degrees of harmful drinking among personnel serving in 
the Royal Navy in comparison to the civilian population.

In  addition  to  heavy  and  hazardous  drinking,  sub-
stantial levels of binge drinking have also been found in 
military populations across UK, US, German, Angolan 
and Nigerian military populations [2, 20, 22, 25, 30, 33, 
40]. Binge drinking in the UK, has been associated with 
being younger, being in the Army, being single and being 
a smoker [2]. Furthermore, there appears to be a differ-
ence in the prevalence of binge drinking between Active 
Duty/Regular  soldiers  and  National  Guard/Reserves. 
Larson, Adams [33] identified that there was a marked 
difference between those personnel in Active Duty who 
reported  frequent  binge  patterns  of  alcohol  use  than 
those in the National Guard/Reserves.

The  issue  of  problematic  alcohol  use  among  the 
Armed Forces population, related to active service, was 
considered  by  19  papers  [6,  19–21,  23,  29–31,  33,  34, 
36–44], including a focus on adverse combat experiences 
[19,  21,  29,  37,  38,  44],  pre-deployment  preparedness 
[36]  and  differences  between  Active  Duty/Regular  sol-
diers and the National Guard/Reserves [31, 33].

Rates  of  alcohol  use  have  been  perceived  as  the 
highest for those with combat specific jobs or those with 
a greater number and higher intensity deployments [6]. 

Furthermore, despite Special Operations Forces experi-
encing  greater  exposure  to  combat  deployments  than 
conventional  forces,  Dretsch  et  al.  [23]  determined 
that the prevalence of alcohol misuse in 16 284 Special 
Operations Forces soldiers was comparable or lower than 
reported by the wider military. This paper had the largest 
sample of the papers included in this review.

Research  has  indicated  that  heavy  alcohol  use  often 
occurs  during  pre-  and  post-  deployment  with  a  sig-
nificant  association  to  the  deployment  period  itself  [6, 
20, 30, 37, 43]. Most of the research primarily focuses 
on  personnel  with  military  service  during  the  Iraq War 
(2003–2011), with and without deployment experience. 
More recent papers have begun to consider the impact of 
the War in Afghanistan (2001–2014).

Adverse combat experiences during deployment have 
been  associated  with  heavy  drinking  in  military  per-
sonnel [19, 21, 38]. Hooper et al [29] discussed how the 
active involvement in theatre of war had strong links to 
problematic  drinking  habits  among  serving  personnel 
who feared for their own mortality and who ‘experienced 
hostility from civilians’. Wilk, Bliese [44] also found that 
soldiers who had higher rates of exposure to the threat 

A. K. OSBORNE ET AL.: MILITARY SERVICE AND ALCOHOL USE 319

of death or injury were significantly more likely to screen 
positive for alcohol misuse. Exposure to atrocities simi-
larly predicted misuse of alcohol with alcohol-related be-
havioural problems.

Although in Russell [37] all combat experiences were 
also positively correlated, only the combat experience of 
killing  was  significantly  related  to  post-deployment  al-
cohol use. Interestingly, alcohol use decreased amongst 
those  who  experienced  killing  during  combat. The  au-
thors’ explanation for this was based on the suggestion 
that  the  ‘killing  experience  may  activate  the  soldiers’ 
mortality  salience  and  trigger  a  self-preservation  focus 
that  manifests  itself  in  reduced  risky  alcohol  consump-
tion’ [37]. No other paper in the review considered this.
Alongside  the  available  evidence  that  suggests  that 
fighting the enemy in battle and witnessing the horrors 
of war predisposes serving personnel to the risk of prob-
lematic  alcohol  use,  Skipper  et  al.  [38]  suggested  that 
serving personnel who are part of ‘special forces’ are at 
an  even  higher  risk  of  providing  a  positive  alcohol  test 
result due to problematic drinking if they are involved in 
hostile warfare. In line with adverse combat experiences, 
Browne, et al. [19] also argued that personnel who de-
ployed with their parent unit, whose role in theatre was 
outside, above or below their training or experience and 
who  experienced  poor  in-theatre  unit  leadership  were 
more likely to be heavy drinkers.

Despite several papers in this review (n = 13) identifying 
a  significant  link  between  deployment  and  subsequent 
alcohol  use,  regardless  of  country,  Thandi  et  al.  [39] 
demonstrated  that  levels  of  drinking  were  not  related  to 
deployment status. Marshall et al. [34] also found no ef-
fect of deployment on alcohol use, although this was for 
those who reported pre-deployment depression or PTSD. 
Three German papers support the suggestion that deploy-
ment has no effect on alcohol use [40–42]. Interestingly, 
the correlates of increased average daily alcohol use across 
two time points in these papers, were limited social sup-
port,  greater  sleeping  difficulties  and  increased  nega-
tive  post-event  cognitions  following  deployment  [41]. 
Lower  PTSD  symptom  severity  pre-deployment  and 
less  childhood  emotional  neglect,  predicted  a  decrease 
in average daily alcohol consumption [41]. It is possible 
to  suggest  that  specific  deployment  experiences  impact 
alcohol  use  in  a  military  population  rather  than  deploy-
ment in general. However, these German papers were all 
from  the  same  Prevalence,  Incidence  and  Determinant 
of  PTSD  and  Other  Mental  Disorders  (PID-PTSD+3) 
study.  Additionally,  Orr  et  al.  [36]  identified  that  only 
pre-deployment  preparedness  was  associated  with  inci-
dent alcohol misuse when controlling for demographics, 
deployment  related  factors  (e.g.  exposure  to  warzone 
stressors), and the presence of psychopathology.

US research has identified further differences within a 
military population. Around 13–14% of National Guard/
Reserve  personnel  exhibited  high  levels  of  drinking  in 

association  with  deployment  [31,  33]. Whereas  Larson 
et al. [33] discovered that an increase in alcohol use as a 
result of deployment was actually greater in Active-Duty 
personnel  compared  to  the  National  Guard/Reserves. 
Regardless, alcohol use following deployment is thought 
to  be  uniquely  predicted  by  higher  levels  of  PTSD 
symptom  severity,  higher  levels  of  avoidance-specific 
PTSD  symptoms  and  lower  levels  of  positive  emotion-
ality [31]. It is worth noting that although there appears 
to be an indication of differences in alcohol use with en-
gagement  type  following  deployment,  more  research  is 
needed to further explore this.

Although  not  a  focus  of  this  review,  eight  papers 
focussing  on  alcohol  use  in  a  military  population  re-
ported  on  the  implication  of  mental  health  [8,  25,  28, 
31, 32, 34, 39, 40]. This included five papers looking at 
the role and impact of PTSD [25, 31, 32, 34, 39], one on 
wider mental health [40], one on suicide [28] and one on 
functional impairment [8].

Previous  research  has  suggested  military  personnel 
with  PTSD  may  use  alcohol  for  self-medication  as 
a  coping  mechanism  for  distress  related  to  psycho-
logical symptoms [31, 34]. Five papers indicated a sig-
nificant  association  between  PTSD  symptom  severity, 
heavy  drinking  behaviours  and  new-onset Alcohol  Use 
Disorder [25, 31, 32, 34, 39]. However, once the influ-
ence of personality variables were accounted for, Ferrier-
Auerbach et al. [25] found that mental ill health was not 
associated with any drinking variable.

Although  baseline  PTSD  symptoms  significantly 
 increased the risk of screening positive for new onset al-
cohol dependence, Kline et al. [32] identified no effect 
of  pre-deployment  alcohol  use  on  subsequent  PTSD 
 diagnoses  post-deployment.  Such  findings 
indicate  
that  it  is  possible  that  the  specific  psychological  conse-
quence of military deployment (e.g. PTSD) significantly 
impacts  military  personnel’s  alcohol  use  rather  than 
being in the military in general.

In support of the specific psychological impact of de-
ployment  on  military  personnel’s  alcohol  use,  further 
differences  have  been  identified  between  deployed  and 
non-deployed military personnel. Trautmann et al. [40] 
identified  among  recently  deployed  soldiers,  that  heavy 
drinking was related to a higher risk of anxiety, affective 
and  sleep  disorders.  Among  soldiers  never  deployed, 
heavy  drinking  was  linked  with  any  mental  disorders 
other  than  substance  use  disorder  and  was  further  as-
sociated with somatoform disorders. For those recently 
deployed,  associations  between  heavy  drinking  and  the 
presence  of  any  mental  disorder  as  well  as  anxiety  dis-
orders  were  significantly  greater  than  those  that  had 
never deployed.

Beyond PTSD, Herberman et al. [28] identified that 
US  soldiers  who  reported  high  levels  of  alcohol  use 
were more likely to have seriously considered and/or at-
tempted suicide. After adjusting for level of alcohol use, 

320  OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE

PTSD, and depression, drinking to avoid rejection/’fit in’ 
was associated with suicidality.

One  paper  considered  the  impact  of  alcohol  use  on 
functional  impairment.  Rona  et  al.  [8]  identified  that  a 
score  on  the  Alcohol  Use  Disorder  Identification Test 
(AUDIT)  denoting  potential  alcohol  dependence  was 
consistently  associated  with  functional  impairment, 
whereas binge drinking was not. Interestingly, despite a 
known impairment, participants with hazardous drinking 
perceived their functioning to be better than those with 
lower AUDIT scores. The implications of this perception 
should be explored further. Furthermore, half of the par-
ticipants  presenting  with  potential  alcohol  dependence 
also had psychological comorbidities.

Five  papers  identified  the  role  of  social  support  and 
communities  in  the  alcohol  consumption  of  military 
personnel  [6,  22,  26,  30,  39]. The  communities  within 
which  military  personnel  reside  can  have  a  prominent 
role in their alcohol use. Besse et al. [6] conducted inter-
views and focus groups with 29 US Active-Duty soldiers 
to  understand  the  context  of  alcohol  establishments  in 
communities near military installations in relation to al-
cohol  use.  Participants  identified  predatory  behaviour 
by  local  alcohol  establishments  to  encourage  excessive 
drinking, placing the profit as a higher priority over the 
safety  of  the  soldiers.  Free  or  reduced  admission  fees 
and drink specials were often specifically designed with 
soldiers  in  mind,  with  some  participants  reporting  that 
alcohol  establishments  gave  soldiers  ‘heavier  pours’  or 
mixed drinks with a higher proportion of alcohol. These 
findings indicate that there is a perception that military 
personnel drink more, thus increasing the availability of 
alcohol and subsequent use.

Unsurprisingly,  Besse  et  al.  [6]  also  ascertained  that 
drinking has been described as an accepted way to relax 
and  cope  with  stress  brought  on  by  the  daily  stressors 
of military life. Drinking alcohol was perceived to be an 
accepted part of military culture. Pressure to engage in 
heavy drinking often came from peers as an obligation to 
prove oneself to the group. This was particularly common 
among young military personnel or those new to a unit. 
Socialising appears to play a role in military personnel’s 
alcohol use. Besse et al. [6] conducted the only qualitative 
paper  in  this  review. The  findings  allow  further  insight 
into the reciprocal relationship between alcohol and mili-
tary personnel by using interviews and focus groups to 
explore the reasons behind the relationship. Qualitative 
methods are highly appropriate for this paper, where the 
purpose was to learn how military personnel experiences 
the community within which they reside.

Unexpectedly, Cheng et al. [22] indicated that social-
ising with family and friends two to four times, but not 
five or more times, per month increased the risk for prob-
lematic drinking in military personnel. More specifically, 
Thandi et al. [39] identified that entering into a new re-
lationship resulted in a decrease in alcohol use.

Only  two  papers  considered  the  role  of  religion  in 
alcohol  consumption  [22,  30].  Cheng  et  al.  [22]  ascer-
tained that attending religious services more than once a 
week appeared to protect against problematic drinking in 
Angolan soldiers. It is possible that the effect of religion 
on  alcohol  consumption  is  dependent  on  the  soldiers’ 
culture as another paper determined that religion had no 
role in drinking in Nigerian soldiers [30].

The  social  networks  of  military  members  appear  to 
be crucial in the likelihood of alcohol use. For Reserve 
and  National  Guard  soldiers,  one  paper  indicated  that 
drinking-related  social  network  characteristics  such  as 
drinking buddies were associated with increased alcohol 
problems  [26].  However,  for  those  deployed,  military-
affiliated social networks were a protective factor against 
alcohol problems [26].

Discussion

This  systematic  narrative  review  explored  the  relation-
ship between military service and alcohol use. From the 
29 papers examined in this review, it is evident that there 
are military-specific traits and experiences which impact 
alcohol use, namely military characteristics, such as ser-
vice  type  and  rank,  and  military  deployment.  Mental 
health, cultural and social factors also play a role in al-
cohol use in a military population.

Throughout this review, there are associations drawn 
between military characteristics and alcohol use such as 
service type, rank and deployment status [2, 19, 23, 25, 
35, 41], that have been associated with higher levels of al-
cohol consumption in military populations in a number 
of  countries  [2,  20,  22,  25,  30,  33,  40].  Additionally, 
studies  have  pointed  towards  a  difference  between  al-
cohol use in a military population and the civilian popu-
lation [2, 27]. Although, Fadum et al. [24] indicated no 
difference between military women and civilian women.
Most papers indicated that alcohol use was greatest in 
those with deployment experience, especially those with 
adverse combat experiences [6, 19, 21, 38]. This is un-
surprising,  at  least  in  a  UK  military  population,  where 
policy  allows  the  continuation  of  alcohol  use  during 
military  ‘decompression’,  where  those  returning  from 
combat receive a short duration of absence together with 
psychological support [45]. There was a suggestion that 
these findings were a result of using alcohol as a coping 
mechanism after traumatic events, however, further work 
is  needed  to  explore  this.  Specific  combat  experiences 
were  significantly  related  to  screening  positive  for  al-
cohol  misuse  for  elite  and  non-elite  military  personnel 
including  personal  threats,  fighting  and  atrocities  [38]. 
Interestingly, an increase in alcohol use following deploy-
ment  was  greater  for Active-Duty  personnel  compared 
to  the  National  Guard  and  Reserves  in  a  US  cohort 
[33]. It is important to note that not all research found 

A. K. OSBORNE ET AL.: MILITARY SERVICE AND ALCOHOL USE 321

a  significant  link  between  deployment  and  subsequent 
alcohol  use,  regardless  of  country,  a  few  papers  argued 
that deployment had no effect on alcohol use in military 
populations [34, 39–42].

Evidence in this review suggests that mental ill health 
and  harmful  levels  of  alcohol  use  in  military  personnel 
co-exist.  But,  more  importantly,  the  evidence  suggests 
that  internal  stigma  makes  this  population  particularly 
reticent to seek help for both alcohol and mental health 
problems.  Kiernan  et  al.  [46]  identified  that  many  vet-
erans only present for help when they can no longer cope 
with  the  situation,  they  find  themselves  in. This  study 
found  that  seeking  help  for  alcohol  misuse  issues  late, 
when  problems  have  escalated  significantly,  invariably 
led to a co-morbid presentation, a significant decline in 
mental  health  and  excessive  drinking,  usually  exacer-
bated by a collapse of the individuals social support net-
work. Once more, this strengthens existing evidence that 
excess  drinking  negatively  affects  physical,  social,  and 
mental health [7, 46]. Specifically, PTSD symptom se-
verity  was  significantly  associated  with  greater  alcohol 
use [25, 31, 32, 34, 39]. Heavy drinking was also related 
to a higher risk of anxiety, affective and sleep disorders, 
functional impairment, and suicide [8, 28, 40].

This review also suggests that culture and social fac-
tors  can  influence  alcohol  use  in  a  military  population. 
An  interdependent  relationship  was  identified  between 
military personnel and local alcohol establishments near 
military  installations  [6].  It  was  suggested  that  estab-
lishments tailor their business, often in a predatory way 
that  is  perceived  as  detrimental  to  military  personnel’s 
health, well-being, and career. The behaviour of alcohol 
establishments near military installations was felt to ex-
acerbate  this  alcohol  acceptance.  However,  only  one 
US  paper  considered  this,  more  international  research 
should be conducted to consider if this is a common ex-
perience in a military population. Interestingly, there was 
a  suggestion  that  attending  religious  services  [22]  and 
that  having  military  affiliated  social  networks  when  de-
ployed [26], protected against problematic drinking.

Drinking  alcohol  was  noted  as  an  accepted  way  to 
relax  and  cope  with  stress  in  the  military  with  some 
feeling pressure to conform to drinking [6]. This accept-
ance  of  alcohol  use  and  the  social  norms  surrounding 
its use can have life-long, post-military service implica-
tions, as military veterans who normalise or excuse their 
drinking,  delay  their  engagement  in  substance  misuse 
services  [46].  The  historic  social  and  cultural  norms 
within  the  military  [1],  and  even  the ‘romanticising’  of 
this culture [12] are now being recognised, and the UK’s 
Ministry of Defence is trying to combat and encourage a 
sensible approach to alcohol use with initiatives to iden-
tify individuals’ alcohol use during regular oral examin-
ations [47].

In  almost  all  studies  considered  for  this  review,  the 
Alcohol  Use  Disorder  Identification Test  (AUDIT)  or 

the  modified  brief  version, AUDIT-C  was  utilised. The 
AUDIT and AUDIT-C have been acknowledged as valid 
instruments  for  identifying  alcohol  misuse  or  depend-
ence among US and Australian military populations [48, 
49]. However, the validity of such tests in other military 
populations  does  not  appear  to  have  been  completed, 
despite  the  variability  in  populations.  Regardless  of  the 
validity of such instruments, research has relied heavily 
on self-report questionnaires for assessment in a Military 
population. This can result in ascertaining large volumes 
of  data;  however,  this  can  also  give  rise  to  participants 
answering in a more socially desirable way, rendering re-
sults inaccurate [50].

This  focus  on  quantitative  research  methods  has 
made it difficult to draw any conclusions as to what the 
resulting impact of military service on alcohol use may 
have on the ability of service personnel to carry out their 
jobs. To mitigate this, future research must also consider 
a qualitative approach, considering personal experiences 
and meanings ascribed to alcohol use, rather than only 
symptom severity, to draw any conclusions.

This review has synthesised findings from existing lit-
erature,  highlighting  potential  gaps  in  current  research. 
Despite being a comprehensive, international systematic 
narrative literature review, it is important to acknowledge 
there are limitations. First, only papers written in English 
were  considered  for  review  and  may  have  excluded  in-
clusion  of  international  findings.  Only  the  relationship 
between military service and alcohol use of serving per-
sonnel  was  considered,  with  papers  including  veterans 
in  their  sample  being  excluded  as  it  was  outside  of  the 
aims of this review. Finally, only peer-reviewed research 
was  included  in  this  review  and,  whilst  this  was  a  pur-
poseful decision, it is acknowledged that evidence from 
grey  literature  may  illuminate  further  understanding  of 
this issue.

This systematic narrative review aimed to critically 
evaluate  existing  literature  to  explore  the  relationship 
between military service and alcohol use. Findings in-
dicated  that  there  are  specific  characteristics  strongly 
associated  with  military  service  that  appear  to  have 
an  impact  on  alcohol  use.  The  subsequent  effects 
of  alcohol  use  in  a  military  occupational  context  re-
inforces  the  validity  of  exploring  the  casual  links  in 
more depth. Further research is needed to identify spe-
cific ‘risk  factors’  associated  with  serving  in  the  mili-
tary and problematic alcohol consumption. Exploring 
the attributable burden will be a crucial building block 
to  developing  appropriate  and  targeted  prevention 
policies.
