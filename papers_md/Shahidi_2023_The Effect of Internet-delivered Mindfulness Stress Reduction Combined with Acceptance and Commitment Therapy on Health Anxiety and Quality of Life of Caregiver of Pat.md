Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a widespread disease all over the world that has caused 
many psychological complications such as health anxiety (HA) and low quality of life (QOL). Mindfulness-
based approaches could improve these complications. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of 
Internet-delivered mindfulness stress reduction combined with acceptance and commitment therapy (IMSR-
ACT) on QOL and HA of caregivers of patients infected by COVID-19.
Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 72 people from Golpayegan city, Iran, who had a patient with COVID-
19 in their family were selected from March to June 2020. A caregiver with a score above 27 on the Health Anxiety 
inventory (HAI-18) was selected using simple random sampling. Participants were assigned in the intervention 
or control group by permuted block random allocation. The intervention group was trained by MSR and ACT 
techniques for 9 weeks accomplished via WhatsApp. All participants completed the QOLQuestionnaire-12 (SF-
12) items and HAI-18 before and after completing IMSR-ACT sessions. The data were analyzed through SPSS-
23 software, using Chi square, independent and paired t-test, and analysis of covariance, and P-value<0.05 was 
considered as significant. 
Results:  The  results  showed  that  the  intervention  group  compared  to  the  control  group  had  a  significant 
decrease  in  all  subscales  of  HAI  after  the  intervention  including  worry  about  consequences  (5.78±2.66  vs. 
7.37±1.34, P=0.004) and awareness of bodily sensation or changes (8.90±2.77 vs. 11.75±2.30, P=0.001), worry 
about health (10.94±2.38 vs. 13.09±1.92, P=0.001), and total score of HAI (25.62±4.93 vs. 32.25±3.93, P=0.001). 
Also, the intervention group compared to the control group had better QOL after the intervention in general 
health perceptions (3.03±0.96 vs. 2.43±0.95, P=0.01), mental health (7.12±2.25 vs. 6.34±1.85 and P=0.01) and 
mental component summary) 16.78±3.75 vs. 15.43±3.05, P=0.01), physical component summary (16.06±2.66 vs. 
15.19±2.25, P=0.01), and total score of SF-12 (32.84±5.39 vs. 30.62±4.34, P=0.004).
Conclusion: Internet-delivered MSR combined with ACT could improve the HA and QOL of caregivers with 
patients infected by COVID-19. Thus, it can used in other similar situations for now and future. Also, it seems 
to be a useful approach for caregivers of the other illnesses.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was first 
detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and 
its main symptoms included fever, dry cough, and 
shortness of breath.1 Almost all countries have 
been affected by the virus. USA, India, and France 
had the highest number of deaths due to Covid-19 
in the world; Iran is also ranked 18th in this list.2 
Traumatic events such as COVID-19 can change 
the lifestyle and affect the quality of life (QOL) 
adversely. It reduces people’s feeling of security, 
increases fear of death, and affects the mental 
health. Questions related to the pandemic with 
no definite answers; exposure to controversial 
information about the disease; decreased social 
relations; financial conditions, domestic violence, 
children studying at home; restriction about doing 
activities outside home; and recommendations 
about prohibitions such as home quarantine can 
adversely affect the individuals’ QOL and their 
mental health.3, 4 The studies have shown that 
individuals quarantined at home reported higher 
anxiety and lower QOL levels.5, 6

Symptoms  such  as  anxiety,  depression, 
fear, stress, sleep problems and post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  symptoms  were  seen  more 
frequently  during  the  COVID-19.7  Also, 
another  study  showed  that  psychological 
impact of this disease was mostly anxiety 
and depression experienced by both medical 
workers and the general public.8 Health anxiety 
(HA) is one of the outcomes of COVID-19 
pandemic.9 Bodily sensations are often cues 
for anxiety or emotional distress in persons 
with  problems  with  HA.10  A  study  among 
Iranians showed corona disease anxiety was 
higher in women. People who follow the news 
of COVID-19 a lot had more anxiety. People 
aged  21-40  and  those  who  have  a  family 
member or close friend with COVID-19 also 
had high levels of corona disease anxiety.11

The  many  effects  that  COVID-19  has 
on  the  psychological  state  and  QOL  of 
individuals indicate the need for psychological 
interventions. It has been demonstrated that 
these  interventions  can  reduce  emotional 
distress, promote positive health habits, and 

enhance the immune responses for patients 
with cancer as for infectious diseases (such 
as chronic hepatic B and HIV) can improve 
the anxiety control, QOL of patients, and pain 
management.12, 13

One of the best psychological interventions 
for  improvement  of  anxiety  and  QOL 
is  mindfulness-based  therapies  (MBT). 
Mindfulness  Stress  Reduction  (MSR)  and 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) 
are the most effective and usable therapies in 
MBT area. Many studies showed the effect 
of MSR and ACT on anxiety,14, 15 HA,16, 17 and 
symptoms  and  QOL  various  diseases  and 
their caregivers.18, 19

Although in COVID-19 pandemic using 
Internet-based therapies increased, before this 
period, there was evidence of the effectiveness 
of psychological treatments such as cognitive 
behavior therapy (CBT), Internet-delivered 
CBT  (ICBT),  ACT  and  Internet-delivered 
ACT (IACT) for HA.17, 20, 21

These  studies  were  administered  on 
patients,  and  there  are  a  few  studies  that 
examined psychological treatments for their 
caregivers.  On  the  other  hand,  the  studies 
on  caregivers  of  the  patients  with  various 
illnesses focused on chronic situations such 
as cancer, dementia, chronic and contagious 
situations.22, 23 Furthermore, some constructs 
related  to  illnesses  such  as  HA  have  been 
studied in the patients not their caregivers.

The  techniques  in  MSR  focused  on 
decreasing  anxiety  and  stress  (such  as 
body scan, mindful sitting) and increasing 
the  attention  to  the  present  moment  (such 
as  doing  daily  activity  with  attention  and 
pleasure).  These  therapeutic  components 
could improve the HA and QOL. On the other 
hand, some concepts such as acceptance of 
internal experiences such as anxiety and its 
related thoughts could be covered by ACT 
techniques as well as commitment to doing 
the behaviors related to improving the HA and 
QOL. Therefore, it seems that combination of 
mindfulness and ACT has more advantages 
for the people caring patients with COVID-19.
On  the  other  hand,  Internet-delivered 

111

Mindfulness for health anxiety of caregivers of patients with COVID-19IJCBNM April 2023; Vol 11, No 2treatment  has  several  advantages  such  as 
independence of geographical distance to the 
clinic, fewer or no scheduled appointments, 
less interference with patients’ daily life, and 
possibly less perceived stigma.24 In this regard, 
the  use  of  publicly  available  applications 
such as WhatsApp for MBT and ACT has 
increased.25 This application is one of the most 
popular messaging applications in the world; 
in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was used more 
than  the  platforms  in  Iran.  WhatsApp  has 
flexibility and useful features to text, call, and 
send video, audio, links, location, document, 
and pictures and to form learning groups. It 
means it is the most potential technology to 
support teaching goals.26

This  study  aimed  to  evaluate  the  effect 
of  Internet-delivered  MSR  combined  with 
ACT on HA and QOL in caregivers of people 
infected by COVID-19.

Methods

This  randomized  clinical  trial  was  done 
from March to June 2020. Participants were 
caregivers who had a patient with COVID-19 
in their family and were in home quarantine, 
followed  up  and  screened  for  COVID-19 
according to the protocols in the health center 
of Golpayegan city, Iran. Since the beginning 
of COVID-19, all people could register their 
initial symptoms in the system of the Ministry 
of Health; in the case of suspicious symptoms, 
the experts of the health centers would contact 
them. Also, all the patients who were identified 
through the Polymerase chain reaction test were 
registered in the list of the Ministry of Health, 
and the health centers followed up the condition 
of the patients and their caregivers by telephone. 
Two  experts  of  Golpayegan  Health  Center 
followed up patients with COVID-19, checked 
the  condition  of  their  caregivers,  completed 
the Health Anxiety inventory-18 (HAI-18) for 
them and the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the 
study. If the conditions were met, they entered 
the caregivers into a list. Then, the participants 
were selected by simple random sampling. The 
inclusion criteria included being a caregiver with 

112

a patient with COVID-19 (moderate intensity 
and without the need for hospitalization), having 
a score above 27 on HAI-18 and being informed, 
having no major psychiatric disorders (such as 
psychotic disorders, mood disorders, substance 
use disorders) based on a psychiatric clinical 
interview, not having severe and chronic medical 
conditions  (such  as  cancer,  cardiovascular 
diseases, cerebral vascular accident), and having 
a smart phone and ability to work with virtual 
networks such as WhatsApp. Exclusion criteria 
were not attending IMSR-ACT sessions and not 
doing homework, and infection with COVID-19 
with severe symptoms requiring hospitalization 
or quarantine or leading to a person’s inability 
to do IMSR-ACT practices.

Hence, HA was a primary outcome and 
QOL was a secondary outcome; sample size 
was calculated 32 people in each group based 
on a previous study27 for HA (considering 
α=0.05 and 1-β=0.8), S1=4.04, S2=2.96, and 
d=2.5. Given the possible drop out, 36 people 
in  each  group  were  assigned.  Calculation

After informed consent, the participants 
were  divided  randomly  into  two  groups 
(intervention and control) by random allocation 
software in such a way that they were assigned 
by permuted block random allocation, and 
each block included 4 participants. The control 
group received the necessary follow-up and 
education about COVID-19 and prevention 
and medical treatment methods by telephone. 
In the intervention group, in addition to the 
usual training, IMSR-ACT based on “Face 
COVID-19»  protocol  of  Hariss28  for  one 
session per week (a total of 9 sessions) was 
performed by a clinical psychologist trained 
for  ACT  and  MSR  (via  WhatsApp  social 
network). The content validity of the protocol 
was evaluated by 8 expert psychologists in 
ACT  and  mindfulness  field;  The  content 
validity  index  (CVI)  and  content  validity 
ratio (CVR) showed the suitable validity of 
the  protocol  (CVI=0.84  and  CVR=0.99). 

Shahidi S, Zargar F, Aghaee Khajelangi H, Tarrahi MJijcbnm.sums.ac.ir The contents of each session are displayed in 
Table 1. To maintain the confidentiality and 
non-disclosure of the participants’ personal 
information  to  each  other  due  to  disease 
stigma, we used the WhatsApp broadcasting 
option (that sends information individually 
and  privately  to  all  participants).  Because 
MBSR  and  ACT  included  homework  and 
worksheets  for  recording  each  training 
session,  the  intervention  group  instructor 
communicated with each participant during 
the  treatment  sessions  and  reviewed  the 
worksheets of the participants and answered 
their questions.

The participants completed the Short Form 
of QOL Questionnaire (SF-12) and HAI-18 
before  and  after  completing  the  IMSR-
ACT  sessions.  The  questionnaires  were 
completed  electronically  (by  sending  the 
link of each questionnaire to the participants’ 
WhatsApp  software)  and  followed  up  by 
phone. Therefore, the authors or trainer did 
not have any information about allocation of 
the questionnaires. Neither the assessor who 
evaluated the questionnaires nor the person 
who  analyzed  the  data  were  aware  of  the 
group membership of the participants.

SF-12  which  was  designed  in  1996  by 
Warr,  Kasinski  and  Keller  includes  eight 
subscales of physical function (PF, 2 items), 
physical role (PR, 2 items), physical pain (PP, 
1 item), general health (GH, 1 item), energy 
and fatigue (E&F, 1 item), social function 
(SF, 1 item), emotional role (ER, 2 items), 
and mental health (MH, 2 items). SF-12 has 

a  physical  component  summary  (PCS,  6 
items) - which is the sum scores of PF, PR, PP, 
and GH- and a mental component summary 
(MCS, 6 items)- which is the sum scores of 
E&F, SF, ER and MH.29 Some items of SF-12 
have two options, and some have multiple-
choice answers. The total score ranges from 
12  to  48,  and  the  higher  scores  indicate 
better QOL. War et al. (1996) were the first 
to examine the validity and reliability of this 
scale. The Cronbach’s alpha calculated for 
PCS and MCS was 0.89 and 0.76, respectively. 
The converge construct validity of PCS and 
MCS of SF-36 was reported by War et al. as 
0.91 and 0.91, respectively, using evaluation 
of  their  correlation  with  PCS  and  MCS 
subscales of short-form health survey 36 (SF-
36).29 Montazeri et al. (2009) examined the 
validity and reliability of the Persian version 
of this scale. They used the test-retest method 
to check the reliability. The reliability of PCS 
and  MCS  was  0.73  and  0.72,  respectively. 
They  reported  construct  validity  of  SF-12 
subscales using confirmatory factor analysis 
between 0.89 to 0.91.30 In the present study, 
the  reliability  (Cronbach’s  alpha)  of  PCS, 
MCS, and total SF-12 was obtained 0.88, 0.81, 
and 0.79, respectively. 

HAI-18  is  used  to  measure  HA.  It  was 
designed  by  Salkowskis  and  Warwick  in 
2002 and consists of 18 questions. The first 14 
questions consist of four options from which 
individuals select the one that best describes 
their  mental  state.  The  last  four  questions 
are intended to measure mental state in the

included worry about health (WAH), worry 
about consequences (WAC), and awareness 
of bodily sensation or changes (ABS). All 
questions are scored 0–3, with higher scores 
indicating greater HA. The total score ranges 
from  0  to  54.31  The  reliability  of  the  first 
version  of  HAI  using  test-retest  reliability 
was reported 0.90, and its reliability using 
Cronbach’s  alpha  coefficient  was  reported 
from 0.70 to 0.82 by Salkowskis and Warwick. 
They reported a construct validity of 0.63 for 
HAI using evaluation of its correlation with 
Illness Attitude Scale.31 The construct validity 
of the Persian version of HAI-18 was reported 
0.75 using evaluation of its correlation with 
Ahwaz hypochondriasis test, and its reliability 
was reported 0.75. Also, the Cronbach’s alpha 
for WAH, WAC, and ABS was reported 0.59, 
0.60, and 0.70, respectively.32 In the present 
study,  the  reliability  (Cronbach’s  alpha)  of 
WAH,  WAC,  ABS,  and  total  HAI-18  was 
obtained 0.79, 0.83, 0.78, and 0.79, respectively. 

Of  the  72  participants,  finally  the  data 
of  32  people  in  each  group  were  entered 
into the statistical analysis. Figure 1 shows 
CONSORT Flow Diagram of the study. All 
analyses were performed using SPSS software 
version  23,  and  a  P<0.05  was  considered 
statistically significant; Chi square and paired 
samples t- test, independent samples t-test, 
and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were 
used. Also, the normality of the distribution 
was confirmed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test and checking the kurtosis and skewness 
of the data distribution and P>0.05. 

This  research  followed  the  Helsinki 
declaration of ethical principles in medical 
research on humans.33 The study was approved 
by ethics committee of Isfahan University 
of Medical Sciences (ethical code: IR.MUI.
REC.1399.441). Ethical issues were considered 
including obtaining written informed consent, 
maintaining anonymity and confidentiality, 
and explaining the right to withdraw from 
the study at any time without affecting the

Results

In  the  present  study,  the  participants’  mean 
age was 41.82±12.75. 26 participants )40.60%) 
were male and 38 of them (59.40%) were female. 
Most of them (46; 71.90%) were married and 24 
(37.50%) of them had under diploma education; 
the others had diploma or university education. 
24 participants (37.50%) were housewives, 7 
(10.90%) of them were unemployed, and the 
others had a kind of job. The major source of 
information for registration in the system of 
health ministry in 45 people (70%) was news. 
The  sample’  demographic  characteristics 
including age, gender, marital status, education 
level, etc. by group are displayed s in Table 2. 

The results showed there were no significant 
differences in demographic variables between 
the  intervention  and  control  groups’  sex 
(P=0.30), educational level (P=0.38), marital 
status (P=0.11), occupational status (P=0.76), 
number of households (P=0.39), the history 
of  mental  illness  (P=0.25),  the  history  of 
quarantine  for  COVID-19  (P=0.96),  and 
source of information (P=0.53). Also, there 
were no significant differences in age variable 
between the two groups (P=0.95).

The  total  scores  of  HAI-18  and  its 
subscales are shown in Table 3. It showed that 
in the control group there were no significant 
differences in the subscale of HAI-18 and its 
total score at pre-test compared to post-test, for 
HAI-18 total (P=0.96), ABS (P=0.19), WAC 
(P=0.85), and WAH (P=0.41). On the other 
hand, the intervention group had a significant

for HAI-18 total (P=0.001), ABS (P=0.001), 
WAC (P=0.006), and WAH (P=0.001). Also, 
the intervention and control groups showed 
significant differences after the intervention

Discussion

The present study showed that the intervention 
group had lower WAH, ABS, WAC, and total 
HAI-18 compared to the control group in the 
post-test. Also, it revealed that the intervention 
group had a significant decrease in all subscales 
of HAI and its total after intervention. Thus, 

116

the intervention could reduce HA in caregivers 
of  patients  with  COVID-19.  Several  studies 
have highlighted this finding,16, 17, 21 using CBT 
or  mindfulness  approaches  for  HA;  two  of 
them used IACT or ICBT for HA similar to the 
present study.17, 21 On the other hand, this finding 
is not consistent to one study which showed 
acceptance or mindful- based treatments could 
not reduce worries.34 Lack of reduction of worry 
in this study is consistent with the foundation of 
acceptance-based therapies. In these treatments, 
the primary aim is not necessarily to reduce 
worry  or  the  other  internal  events,  but  they 
aimed to improve QOL in spite of the presence 
of the psychological symptoms. On the other 
hand,  the  above-mentioned  study  examined 
ACT on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), in 
which worries are not only limited to health and 
illness, but also include other areas of a person’s 
life such as work.

Another  feature  of  the  current  study 
was  the  shortness  of  the  intervention 
protocol. However, worry- that is a cognitive 
component  of  anxiety-  is  very  persistent. 
Hence, acceptance-based protocols suggested 
a  longer  period  of  treatment  compared  to 
classical  CBT  for  the  disorders  related  to 
worry.35  In  present  study,  we  had  only  a 
nine- session protocol, and it was effective. 
This  finding  suggests  that  the  controversy 
between the need for short-term and long-
term treatment in anxiety-related disorders

persists. Of course, this suggestion is given 
more in the case of disorders such as GAD, 
in which worry is pervasive and widespread. 
In terms of HA, especially at the beginning 
of COVID-19 pandemic, when the mode of 
transmission was not completely clear, the 
provision  of  information  by  the  treatment 
team of health centers in the present study 
played an important role in reducing HA.

On the other hand, the nature of worry 
is the high anticipation of the occurrence of 
danger and the inability of a person to deal 
with it. Therefore, COVID-19 could aggravate 
these two characteristics of people suffering 
from worry and HA. Therefore, a treatment 

(such  as  IMSR-ACT)  that  helps  people  to 
have a correct assessment of the possibility 
of getting sick and its consequences and to 
have a correct assessment of their ability to 
deal with that risk will lead to a reduction of 
worry and anxiety.

Another possible reason for the significant 
difference in HA in the intervention group 
compared to the control group could be the 
Internet-based nature of the treatment; in the 
same line, other studies showed the benefits 
of  Internet-delivered  treatments  for  those 
suffering from HA.17, 21 Since patients with 
HA have often been considered treatment-
resistant,  the  present  intervention  similar 

117

Mindfulness for health anxiety of caregivers of patients with COVID-19IJCBNM April 2023; Vol 11, No 2to the study that used IACT for HA17 was 
an effective, feasible, and easily accessible 
treatment. Although that study and another 
research reported the negative effects during 
psychological  treatment  such  as  CBT  or 
ACT treatment,17, 36 the present study did not 
reveal such obvious adverse effects. These 
studies have discussed that the patients during 
the treatment period experience symptoms 
including  hopelessness,  failure,  stigma, 
dependency,  and  anxiety  while  changing 
maladaptive behaviors. ACT and mindfulness 
therapy can facilitate the individuals’ learning 
to  face  each  experience  more  openly  and 
without  judgment.  They  use  a  series  of 
exercises designed to train the mind to stay 
focused  and  open  to  everyday  conditions 
including stressful conditions.37 During the 
period  of  high  prevalence  of  COVID-19, 
especially  at  the  beginning  of  the  period, 
reducing  health  care  and  bringing  it  to  a 
normal level could be in contradiction with 
the usual habits of patients suffering from 
HA. Although it seems this condition could 
keep HA high, similar to the other exposure 
techniques,  continued  exposure  leads  to  a 
decrease in anxiety38 and a decrease in HA 
in the present study. Furthermore, reducing 
excessive  healthy  behaviors  could  induce 
interoceptive  exposure  (IE)  with  bodily 
symptoms and sensations (BSS) that people 
with HA experienced. The goal of IE is to help 
the individual to accept the condition more 
and be less distressed by the uncomfortable 
BSS.10 Although in the present protocol, we 
did not have specific IE techniques, it seems 
general exposure, getting correct information 
and acceptance, and mindfulness practices 
could  expose  people  to  their  BSS  so  that 
they can cause accepting of them. Therefore, 
the  scores  of  ABS  decreased  the  in  the 
intervention group. This finding showed that 
the intervention group could have IE as well 
as in vivo exposure. On the other hand, in the 
present study the other adverse events such 
as  stigma  and  dependency  that  the  above 
studies reported had decreased. Dependency 
was minimized due to the lack of face-to-face 

118

contact with the therapist. Also, the possibility 
of stigma had reached the lowest possible level 
since the treatment provisions were provided 
through Internet and telephone based by a 
public health center, and people did not visit 
a specific center, which indicates the presence 
of their mental problems. 

Another possible reason for the reduction 
of HA in the intervention group may be the 
method and source of information. During 
the  COVID-19  pandemic,  especially  in  its 
early  period,  disease-related  information 
was  present  in  the  media  along  with  bias 
and  misinformation,  whereas  information 
about how to manage the pandemic was less 
often covered. This condition had aggravated 
people’s HA.39 It points out the importance 
of  early  intervention  and  the  provision  of 
scientific  information  and  the  follow-up 
of  psychological  and  medical  training  in 
infectious and emerging diseases to reduce 
the subsequent psychological problems. 

In this study, the intervention group had 
a significant improvement in GH, SF, E&F, 
MH, MCS, PCS subscales of SF-12, and its 
total  scores  at  post-test  compared  to  pre-
test. Also, the intervention group had more 
significant improvement in GH, MH, MCS, 
PCS, and total score of SF-12 compared to the 
control group. Thus, it is concluded that the 
intervention could improve QOL. This finding 
is consistent to those of other studies which 
showed mindfulness and ACT can decrease 
psychological  distress  and  increase  well-
being and QOL in individuals who experience 
physical and psychological disorders.18, 19, 40  
Those  studies  reported 
the  effect  of 
mindfulness and ACT approaches as usual or 
Internet-delivered based on improving QOL 
of the patients and their caregivers.

The strength of this study was focus on the 
caregivers of people infected with COVID-19. 
Also, the study was conducted as an Internet-
based treatment by common smart phones 
via a very popular platform (WhatsApp). The 
limitation of this study was no comparison 
with a gold standard treatment such as CBT. 
Another limitation of the study was the lack 

Shahidi S, Zargar F, Aghaee Khajelangi H, Tarrahi MJijcbnm.sums.ac.ir of  follow-up  due  to  limited  access  to  the 
participants after the end of the intervention 
sessions. 

Conclusion

This  study  showed  Internet-delivered  MSR 
combined with ACT can improve the QOL and 
HA of people caring the patients with COVID-
19. Therefore, it is suggested that this approach 
should be used for these people and the others 
in the similar possibly future situations. It is also 
suggested that future research should compare 
the intervention group with CBT with three- 
and six-month follow-up. Moreover, in order 
to check the effect of Internet-based treatment 
compared to face-to-face treatment, researcher 
is recommended that the intervention should be 
performed and compared in both Internet-based 
and face-to-face forms.
