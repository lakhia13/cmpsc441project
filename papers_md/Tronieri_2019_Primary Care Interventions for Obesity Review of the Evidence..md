Abstract

Purpose of review: This review describes the results of randomized controlled trials that have 
evaluated the efficacy of behavioral interventions for obesity in primary care settings.

Recent findings: Most studies have found that high-intensity behavioral counseling (providing 
12 or more sessions per year, as defined by the US Preventative Services Task Force), when 
delivered in-person, by phone, or electronically, produced clinically meaningful weight loss (4 to 7 
kg). Low- to moderate-intensity behavioral counseling and counseling that did not include 
behavioral strategies (e.g., motivational interviewing) produced modest losses of 1 to 2 kg. The 
addition of weight loss medication increased mean losses relative to behavioral treatment alone.

Summary: Consistent with national guidelines, the largest weight losses were achieved with 
high-intensity counseling, either alone or in combination with obesity pharmacotherapy. Primary 
care providers can support their patients by inviting them to discuss their weight concerns and 
referring interested individuals to appropriate interventions.

chronic disease (1). With this recognition, obesity became the most prevalent chronic disease 
in the United States, with 37.9% of adult men and 41.1% of women having a body mass 
index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher (2). Obesity is associated with increased risk for other 
chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes), disability, and mortality (3). Thus, better control of 
obesity has the potential to dramatically reduce the burden of chronic illnesses treated by 
primary care physicians (PCPs) and other healthcare providers.

The field of obesity also has shown an increasing consensus regarding appropriate treatment 
goals and techniques, and steps have been taken to improve access to evidence-based 
interventions. In 2003, and again in 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
recommended that clinicians screen all adults for obesity and offer or refer patients with 
BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (4,5). The 
Task Force gave this recommendation a grade of B, indicating that there is high certainty 
that the net benefit is moderate, or that there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is 
moderate to substantial. In 2018, the USPSTF again reaffirmed this recommendation and 
rating (3). Importantly, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandated that 
any service receiving an “A” or a “B” grade recommendation from the USPSTF be covered 
without patient co-pays (6). Following this, in 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) created a new benefit for the treatment of obesity, allowing for 21–22, 15-
minute counseling visits in the primary setting over 1 year (7).

During this same period, several professional societies published updated obesity treatment 
guidelines. These include the 2013 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College 
of Cardiology (ACC)/The Obesity Society (TOS) (8) guidelines covering the behavioral and 
surgical treatment of obesity and The Endocrine Society’s 2015 guidelines on the use of 
medications to treat obesity (including four medications approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration [FDA] since 2012) (9).

Despite these developments, the diagnosis and treatment of obesity in primary care may be 
in decline. The results of a national survey found that, relative to 2008–2009, height and 
weight were more likely to be measured in primary care visits occurring between 2012–2013 
(54% vs. 73% of visits, respectively) (10•). However, approximately 5% fewer patients with 
a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher received a diagnosis of obesity. Only 21% of patients with 
obesity were provided with weight-related counseling in 2012–2013, compared with 33% in 
2008–2009. With the majority of healthcare visits occurring in primary care (11), PCPs have 
a unique opportunity to facilitate access to effective obesity treatments. The persistence of 
suboptimal diagnosis and treatment of obesity is likely attributable to multiple patient and 
provider barriers, including a mismatch between the resources needed to implement the 
recommended intensive behavioral interventions and the current structure and capacity of 
primary care practices.

The present review first describes the potential benefit of primary care interventions for 
obesity, with a focus on intensive behavioral treatment delivered using different modalities 
(e.g., in-person visits, telephone calls, digital technology). We provide a narrative review that 
highlights seminal studies and representative research from the past five years in the context

of data from several recent systematic reviews. We then discuss recommendations for how 
PCPs can best support patients in their weight control efforts.

Behavioral Treatment of Obesity

The USPSTF’s 2018 review of 122 primary care-relevant randomized trials found that 
behavioral interventions produced mean weight losses that were 2.4 kg greater than control 
conditions at 12 to 18 months (12••). This analysis combined the results of programs 
comprised of varying intervention components, delivered using several different modalities, 
and with different visit frequencies. Recent obesity guidelines consistently recommend that 
patients with obesity be offered a high-intensity comprehensive behavioral treatment that 
includes a reduced calorie diet, increased physical activity, and behavioral strategies to 
facilitate adherence to diet and activity goals (3,8; Table 1). The results of previous 
systematic reviews suggest that interventions that contain these three components are 
superior to those that contain only one or two components and to those that employ 
alternative intervention strategies (13). Several systematic reviews also have concluded that 
intensity (i.e., frequency of visits), and not delivery modality, is most strongly associated 
with weight loss (8,13,14). The USPSTF’s 2012 review of primary care-relevant studies 
found that patients who participated in intensive behavioral interventions that offered 12 to 
26 in-person or telephone sessions in the first year achieved weight losses of 4 to 7 kg (6% 
of baseline weight), while those who participated in low- to moderate-intensity programs 
with fewer than 12 sessions per year achieved losses of 1.5 to 4 kg (2.8% of baseline weight) 
(14). We therefore focus our attention on describing studies that meet the 2012 USPSTF 
standard for high-intensity treatment (i.e., 12 or more sessions per year) before briefly 
summarizing alternative methods.

High-Intensity Behavioral Treatment

In-person interventions.—Most studies have shown that high-intensity behavioral 
treatments delivered in primary settings produce clinically significant weight loss. Two large 
trials conducted as part of a collaborative funding effort by the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute (NHLBI) reported weight losses of 4 to 5 kg at 2 years among participants 
who received intensive behavioral counseling. Appel and colleagues (16) recruited 
participants with one or more cardiovascular disease risk factor from primary care offices 
affiliated with an academic medical center. Participants were randomized to usual care, 
telephone-delivered counseling, or in-person counseling (group and individual sessions). 
Treatment in both counseling groups was delivered weekly for the first 3 months and one to 
two times per month thereafter by trained coaches external to the primary practices. Both 
counseling groups also had access to a web-based program that contained learning modules 
and self-monitoring tools. Weight losses at 2 years were 0.8, 4.6, and 5.1 kg, respectively 
(p<0.001 for both counseling groups versus usual care).

In the second 2-year trial, Wadden and colleagues (17) assigned individuals with at least two 
out of five criteria for the metabolic syndrome to: usual care; brief lifestyle counseling (25 
monthly 10–15 minute visits over 2 years with a trained medical assistant from the primary 
care practice); or “enhanced” brief lifestyle counseling (the same 25 counseling visits,

combined with the patients’ choice of either meal replacements, orlistat, or sibutramine). 
Weight losses at year 2 in the three groups were 1.7, 2.9, and 4.6 kg, respectively (p=0.22 for 
usual care vs brief counseling; p=0.003 for usual care vs enhanced counseling).

An additional study by Kumanyika et al. (18,19) compared a “basic” lifestyle intervention 
consisting of visits with a primary care clinician once every 4 months to a “basic plus” 
intervention that included the clinician visits plus monthly 10–15 minute individual sessions 
with a trained coach (typically a medical assistant) following a curriculum based on the 
Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Participants’ weight losses were 0.6 kg in the basic 
group and 1.6 kg in the basic plus group at 1 year (p=0.15, 28% attrition), and 1.2 kg and 1.3 
kg, respectively, at 2 years (p=0.87; 39% attrition). The authors noted that 69% of basic plus 
participants attended less than half of the provided coaching sessions, and that each 
additional coaching visit was associated with a 0.4 kg greater mean weight loss. Although 
these latter studies meet the 2012 USPSTF’s definition of high-intensity treatment (monthly 
or greater visits), the interventions would be considered to be of only moderate-intensity by 
other guidelines such as those of the AHA/ACC/TOS, which define high-intensity treatment 
as providing at least 14 sessions in 6 months (8).

Of note, none of these treatment programs followed the visit schedule now covered by the 
CMS benefit (weekly visits in month 1, every-other-week visits in month 2 to 6, and 
monthly visits through month 12 for patients who lose ≥3 kg at 6 months). A recent study 
employed primary care practitioners (a physician, nurse practitioners, and registered 
dietitians) to deliver a structured intensive behavioral treatment in 15-minute, individual 
sessions using the CMS schedule of 21 visits over 1 year (20•). Participants were randomly 
assigned to receive behavioral counseling, either alone, combined with the medication 
liraglutide 3.0 mg, or combined with both liraglutide and a 12-week meal replacement diet 
(“multi-component”). Weight losses at 1 year in the three groups were 6.6, 12.2, and 13.3 
kg, respectively (p=0.004 for counseling alone vs counseling plus liraglutide; p=0.001 
counseling alone vs multi-component). This study demonstrated that intensive behavioral 
treatment delivered in brief sessions following the CMS visit schedule can produce a 
clinically meaningful weight loss; 44% of patients treated by intensive behavioral treatment 
alone lost at least 5% of baseline weight at 1 year. However, we note that the study did not 
include a usual care group, was not conducted in a primary care setting, and did not 
principally include older adults who are typically covered by CMS. Thus, these findings 
await replication in a larger effectiveness trial.

Remotely-delivered, intensive coaching interventions.—In addition to the study by 
Appel and colleagues discussed above, several trials have used remotely-delivered intensive 
interventions to reduce the burden on PCPs and their patients. In a third study funded by the 
NHLBI initiative, Bennett and colleagues (21) randomized patients to usual care or to a 
multimodal intervention that included individual counseling calls provided by trained 
coaches (monthly in year 1 and every other month in year 2), 12 optional group meetings, 
and electronic tools for self-monitoring. At 2 years, intervention participants had lost a 
significantly greater 1.5 kg compared to the 0.5 kg lost by usual care participants. In a 
subsequent study (22), Bennett and colleagues again assigned patients to usual care or to an 
intervention that provided 12 monthly calls (without optional in-person groups). The

electronic intervention was enhanced, and participants were provided with a smart scale and 
access to a digital application (app) integrated with their electronic health record that 
prescribed behavior change goals, provided tools for self-monitoring, and generated 
personalized feedback. Clinicians also were asked to counsel intervention participants 
during routine visits using the app data. Intervention participants lost 4.0 kg at 1 year, 
compared to 0.1 kg in the usual care group. Engagement rates were high, with participants 
completing 93% of weekly self-monitoring records, 89% of coaching calls, and 2.8 self 
weigh-ins per week.

In a study by Weinstock and colleagues (23), primary care patients with metabolic syndrome 
were randomly assigned to receive the DPP curriculum delivered by trained primary care 
staff (typically nurse practitioners) in either individual or group telephone calls. The first five 
calls were delivered weekly, and monthly calls were then provided for the remainder of the 
study. At year 2, mean weight loss with group calls was 6.2 kg, compared with 2.2 kg in the 
individual call group (p<0.001). (Only 52.5% of participants, however, completed the 2-year 
assessment, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.) Weight loss in the two 
groups did not differ at 6 months (4.5 vs 4.3 kg) or 1 year (4.9 vs. 4.6 kg).

In a study by Ma et al. (24), primary care patients who had either pre-diabetes or metabolic 
syndrome were randomly assigned to: usual care; a 12 session, dietitian-delivered, weekly, 
in-person, group version of the DPP; or to the DPP curriculum, delivered via a self-directed 
DVD. Participants in both intervention groups were provided orientation and access to an 
online site for goal setting and self-monitoring, standardized every-other-week reminder 
messages, and the ability to contact a coach via the web portal. Participants in the in-person 
group also received at least monthly personalized feedback based on their monitoring 
records. At year 2, weight losses in the usual care, in-person, and self-directed groups were 
2.4, 5.4, and 4.5 kg, respectively (p=0.001 for in-person vs control; p=0.03 for self-directed 
vs control) (24,25).

Remotely-delivered intensive counseling also may enhance weight loss maintenance. In a 
trial by Tsai and colleagues (26), 106 individuals recruited from primary care offices were 
provided with 12 in-person visits during the first 6 months of treatment. Of these, 84 persons 
completed the first 6 months and were randomized to a standard maintenance group (written 
materials via email or mail) or an intensive maintenance group, involving one in-person and 
one individualized phone or e-mail contact per month. All participants were given access to 
a subsidized program of portion-controlled foods (Nutrisystem®) throughout the trial. Those 
in the intensive group lost 6.1 kg at month 18, compared to 2.2 kg in the standard 
maintenance arm (p<0.001).

Entirely digital interventions.—More recently, researchers have begun to investigate 
whether fully digitalized structured behavioral interventions, which require no or minimal 
provider-delivered coaching, can produce similar results to those achieved with in-person 
and telephone contacts. Comprehensive programs delivered via the web, text message, or 
smartphone app have been shown to produce losses of 2 to 5 kg in academic medical 
centers, with the largest losses typically achieved by programs that include individualized, 
electronic feedback from a counselor (27,28). Thomas, Leahey, and Wing (29•) investigated

the efficacy of an online program that provided 12 weekly interactive lessons, self-
monitoring tools, and fully automated weekly feedback (generated based on self-monitoring 
data via an algorithm) to participants who were referred to the program by their PCP. At 6 
months, intervention participants had lost 5.4 kg, compared to a 1.3 kg loss for control 
participants who received static online lessons about the benefits of weight loss (that did not 
include behavioral strategies; p<.001). The results of comprehensive digital programs are 
promising; however, it is important to note that most commercially available websites and 
apps include only a small fraction of the behavioral strategies featured in intensive lifestyle 
interventions (30), and most do not provide personalized feedback. A PCP’s referral and 
assistance with downloading a popular commercial weight loss app, MyFitnessPal, produced 
a mean loss of only 0.03 kg in primary care patients (compared with +0.3 kg for controls) 
(31). This finding highlights the need to integrate such apps with comprehensive behavioral 
programs.

Summary.—Taken together, the majority of the studies described above found that high-
intensity counseling, using different modalities, produced clinically meaningful weight loss. 
Some studies described above would be considered to be of moderate-intensity by other 
guidelines (i.e., 1 session per month (8)), and these interventions produced smaller mean 
losses (17,18). Only a limited number of trials have been able to deliver high-intensity 
weight loss counseling to patients recruited from primary care settings, and, in many cases, 
counseling was not delivered by primary care practitioners. This contrasts sharply with the 
CMS benefit for intensive counseling in primary care, which only provides coverage for on-
site, face-to-face visits delivered by a physician, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, 
or physician assistant, or for auxiliary personnel (e.g., dietitians) who are under direct 
supervision of the other providers (7). The small number of trials that have employed 
primacy care practitioners to deliver high-intensity treatment is likely a consequence of the 
logistical and financial barriers to delivering such treatment in the physical setting of the 
primary care office (e.g., limited space for frequent counseling visits) and the already 
pressed demands and high workload of a primary care medical practice. Several studies have 
used multimodal interventions that combined interventionist contact with electronic 
resources, meal replacements, or medication. Such interventions might be used to reduce 
provider burden. Advances in computer programming have enabled the development of 
remotely-delivered interventions that include fully-automated, personalized feedback. More 
studies are needed to determine whether comprehensive behavioral programs can be 
effectively delivered in this format.

Low- to Moderate-Intensity Counseling and Alternative Treatments

A number of studies have offered low- to moderate-intensity behavioral counseling (i.e., ≤ 1 
session/month). Although this format reduces provider burden, low- to moderate-intensity 
counseling, whether delivered by PCPs themselves or by other providers, produces only 
modest weight loss (approximately 1–2 kg greater than standard care). For example, 
Christian and colleagues conducted two randomized trials in primary care using PCPs to 
deliver counseling (32,33). Both studies employed low-intensity counseling, with visits 
conducted quarterly in one trial and twice per year in the second trial. In both trials, the 
intervention group also completed a computer-based assessment that produced personalized

recommendations for participants to discuss with their PCPs. The low-intensity intervention 
groups had small mean weight losses after 1 year (−0.1 kg intervention vs +0.6 kg control in 
the first study, p=0.23; and −1.5 kg intervention vs +0.2 kg control in the second study; 
p=0.002).

Alternative counseling methods, defined as interventions that used primarily motivational 
interviewing (MI) (34) or stages of change (35) without including specific behavioral targets 
for calorie intake or physical activity, also have been shown to produce only modest weight 
losses of 0.5 to 2 kg (13,36). In a systematic review of 24 randomized trials of MI in primary 
care, only nine studies (37.5%) revealed significantly improved weight loss with a MI-based 
intervention compared to a control group (36). The provision of low- or moderate-intensity 
counseling in a majority of these studies may have contributed to the modest mean weight 
losses that were observed (13,36).

Thus, for the majority of patients, lower intensity and alternative interventions are not likely 
to produce a clinically meaningful improvement in weight and health (although the 
likelihood of harm from such interventions is probably minimal). PCPs should counsel their 
patients that such interventions are unlikely to produce significant weight loss and 
recommend that they seek a structured behavioral intervention with frequent support.

Medical and Surgical Options for PCPs to Consider

Adding Medication to Behavioral Treatment

The AHA/ACC/TOS guidelines recommend the consideration of obesity medications for 
patients who have not achieved a loss of 5% or more of initial weight with behavioral 
treatment (8). In 2015, the Endocrine Society, together with TOS, published guidelines on 
medications to treat obesity that should be useful to interested PCPs (9). Five medications 
are currently approved by the FDA for chronic weight management. These medications vary 
in their efficacy, with phentermine-topiramate producing the largest placebo-subtracted 
mean weight losses at 1 year (8.8 kg), followed by liraglutide (5.3 kg), and naltrexone-
bupropion (5.0 kg) (37). Lorcaserin and orlistat are associated with smaller 1-year net 
weight losses of 3.2 and 2.6 kg, respectively (37).

Multiple trials have demonstrated that when medication is added to high-intensity 
counseling, it nearly doubles the weight loss achieved with medication alone (38–41). This 
consistent finding again highlights the benefit of high-intensity behavioral treatment for 
obesity. PCPs should explain to patients that weight management medications are likely to 
be most beneficial when used as a tool to facilitate adherence to behavior change goals 
undertaken with the support of a structured program.

Surgical Treatment of Obesity

Bariatric surgery is by far the most effective treatment for obesity, producing long-term (i.e., 
3–15 year) losses of 20–25% of initial body weight (42,43). Weight loss surgery is much 
safer now than when it was first developed, in part due to the use of laparoscopic procedures 
(44). PCPs should consider referring patients for evaluation for bariatric surgery if desired 
weight loss outcomes or improvements in health have not been achieved by high-intensity

behavioral treatment, alone or in combination with medication. All patients referred for 
bariatric surgery undergo a multidisciplinary medical and behavioral evaluation before they 
are approved for a procedure. Thus, the PCP does not have the burden of making a 
determination of a patient’s appropriateness for surgery before providing such a referral.

Key Messages for PCPs Concerning Obesity

The studies reviewed above have highlighted the consistent evidence supporting the efficacy 
of high-intensity behavioral treatments for improving weight and health in primary care 
patients. This evidence served as the foundation for the USPSTF and relevant professional 
societies’ recommendations that PCPs assess patients’ weight status and offer those with 
obesity intensive counseling or a referral for this treatment. However, as noted above, 
providing an intensive behavioral intervention may not be realistic in most primary care 
practices. Frequently cited barriers include lack of time, insufficient reimbursement, lack of 
training, lack of referral resources, and ongoing belief that obesity is not a medical issue 
(45). In light of these concerns, we offer below several key messages that PCPs can share 
with their patients, building on those discussed by Rutledge and colleagues (46).

Often, a PCP’s first challenge is to broach the topic of weight control with patients who have 
not asked for assistance. A PCP’s acknowledgement of a patient’s obesity may increase an 
individual’s desire to lose weight and likelihood of attempting weight loss (47,48). However, 
patients may be upset by practitioners’ comments about their weight if the topic is not 
introduced in a neutral manner (49). Practitioners can use open-ended questions to invite 
patients to discuss their concerns, for example: “We have not talked about your weight in a 
while. What are your thoughts about your weight at this time?” Another option is to 
summarize physical examination results to include a discussion of weight. A PCP might 
state, “Your weight today was 225 pounds, and your HbA1c was 5.9%, which puts you at 
risk for developing diabetes. I bet you could reduce your blood sugar by losing just 10 – 15 
pounds. Would you like to consider this?” These approaches show respect for the patient and 
invite the individual’s participation in treatment decision-making. It is also important to use 
preferred language (i.e. “weight”, rather than “obesity”) when discussing these issues with 
patients (50,51).

When discussing weight control, we believe the first message to emphasize is the value of 
patients’ engaging in high-intensity behavioral treatment. As described above, low- to 
moderate-intensity interventions do not benefit most patients. Thus, patients who state that 
they have already met with a dietitian for a one-time consultation likely still can benefit from 
more intensive support. PCPs who work in settings where high-intensity treatment is not 
offered can refer patients to weight control programs in the community. The 2013 
AHA/ACC/TOS guidelines indicate that commercial programs can be considered as an 
option for high-intensity treatment, as long as the programs have published peer-reviewed 
evidence of their safety and efficacy (8). Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, 
Medifast, Optifast, and Health Management Resources are among the structured commercial 
and meal replacement programs supported by a recent review (52,53). Self-directed meal 
plans such as Atkins and Slim-fast also have published evidence supporting their safety and 
efficacy (52,53). PCPs also may consider referring patients to low-cost programs, such as

Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) (54). This program has not been evaluated in a published 
randomized trial, but the authors believe that it is a reasonable option for providing high-
intensity behavioral treatment when participation in other programs is not feasible. For 
individuals who report significant psychological symptoms such as depression or binge 
eating, additional referrals to specialty treatment (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) or self-
help resources (e.g., [55]) also may be appropriate.

PCPs also can support their patients by underscoring the benefits of moderate weight loss. 
Several studies have shown that patients tend to have unrealistic weight loss goals of losing 
25% or more of their initial weight (56,57). Some PCPs may unwittingly endorse these 
expectations by suggesting that patients must achieve a BMI less than 25 kg/m2 to improve 
their health. For most patients with obesity, this goal is unrealistic, relative to the average 
losses achieved with behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical treatments. A 5–10% loss of 
initial body weight can produce significant improvement in co-morbid health conditions, 
including hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis of weight-
bearing joints (8,58). After achieving this initial goal, they can evaluate whether further 
weight loss is necessary to produce desired improvements in co-morbid conditions, reduce 
medication use, or improve functional status. Of note, in elderly patients with sarcopenic 
obesity, increases in physical activity appear to be as effective as weight loss for improving 
functional status (59).

A third message that PCPs can deliver is the challenge of maintaining lost weight. Most 
patients, even in high-intensity programs, will hit a “plateau” after losing 5–10% of initial 
body weight. After an initial weight reduction, metabolic adaptations occur (60,61), along 
with potential physiological and psychological effects such as increases in appetite (62). 
Thus, ongoing weight control efforts are necessary for the maintenance of lost weight. 
Patients who experience no noticeable weight loss benefit despite ongoing attempts to 
restrict calorie intake and engage in physical activity may abandon their efforts, thereby 
regaining weight. The PCP can help patients to understand the compensatory biological and 
psychological response that engenders weight regain and can emphasize the value of 
changes in diet and physical activity for long-term weight loss success.

A fourth way in which PCPs can support their patients is to discuss the risks and benefits of 
medications and bariatric surgery for weight loss. Patients may hold stereotypical views of 
these biological treatments as highly unsafe or as taking “the easy way out.” In the context 
of discussing the challenge of weight loss maintenance, PCPs can explain that medications 
and surgery can support long-term weight loss by reducing hunger and responsiveness to 
food cues (63,64). It should be noted that weight loss medications also are most effective if 
used chronically to maintain lost weight, much like anti-hypertensive medications are 
prescribed to maintain improvements in blood pressure. PCPs can help their patients 
understand the chronic nature of obesity and make it feel more acceptable to use these 
biological therapies.

Conclusions

Page 10

Recent advances in the field of obesity have included clarifying the status of obesity as a 
chronic disease and increasing consensus from national and professional guidelines 
regarding the potential benefit of intensive behavioral interventions. The studies reviewed 
above show that such treatment delivered in-person or by phone in primary care can produce 
clinically meaningful weight loss. However, this treatment format can be difficult to 
implement in a primary setting due to the time and resources required. If unable to provide 
intensive behavioral counseling, PCPs should discuss weight control with their patients and 
refer interested individuals to appropriate interventions available in their health care 
institution or in the greater community. They key goal is for patients to engage in a high-
intensity treatment, regardless of the delivery modality used, provided that the intervention 
offers personalized counseling and feedback from a trained interventionist (8). The 
development of comprehensive digital interventions that provide fully-automated 
individualized feedback may improve the dissemination of these effective interventions in 
the future.

PCPs also can serve a critical role by praising the patient’s weight control efforts, even when 
the patient reports frustration with not having achieved a larger weight loss goal, and re-
focusing the conversation on health status rather than the number on the scale. Above all, 
clinicians can help to support their patients by inviting them to discuss their weight concerns 
in the context of treating the medical co-morbidities of excess weight. PCPs will have the 
most success with managing obesity in their practices by employing a combination of 
sensitivity, behavioral techniques, and scientific knowledge when counseling their patients.

a 5 to 10% reduction in body weight.

Table 1.

Component

Weight Loss

Weight-loss Maintenance

Counseling

Diet

≥14* in-person or telephone counseling sessions (individual 
or group) with a trained interventionist during a 6-mo period; 
recommendations for similarly structured, comprehensive 
Web-based interventions, as well as evidence-based 
commercial programs

Low-calorie diet (typically 1200–1500 kcal per day for 
women and 1500–1800 kcal per day for men), with 
macronutrient composition based on patient’s preferences and 
health status

Monthly or more frequent in-person or telephone 
sessions for ≥1 yr with a trained interventionist

Reduced-calorie diet, consistent with reduced body 
weight, with macronutrient composition based on 
patient’s preferences and health status

Physical activity

≥150 min per week of aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking)

200–300 min per week of aerobic activity (e.g., brisk 
walking)

Behavior therapy

Daily monitoring of food intake and physical activity, 
facilitated by paper diaries or smartphone applications; 
weekly monitoring of weight; structured curriculum of 
behavioral change (e.g., DPP), including goal setting, 
problem solving, and stimulus control; regular feed-back and 
support from a trained interventionist

Occasional or frequent monitoring of food intake and 
physical activity, as needed; weekly-to-daily monitoring 
of weight; curriculum of behavioral change, including 
problem solving, cognitive restructuring, and relapse 
prevention; regular feedback from a trained 
interventionist

Data are from the AHA/ACC/TOS Guidelines (2013) for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults (8).

*

The 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force defined high-intensity behavioral treatment as including 12 or more sessions per year. DPP =
