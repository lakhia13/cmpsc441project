Abstract
Emerging research shows that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may improve mental health for caregivers. 
Parents of autistic children, adolescents, and adults (N = 54) were randomly assigned to either complete a brief group-
based ACT intervention or remain on the waitlist. Participants completed surveys immediately prior to randomization, 
and 3-, 7-, and 17-weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome was depression symptoms and secondary outcomes 
included stress, goal attainment, positive affect, ACT psychological processes, child mental health, and family functioning. 
Mixed effects linear models testing Group × Time interaction indicated the Treatment group (n = 27) demonstrated 
greater post-intervention improvements than the Waitlist group (n = 27) in parent depression (p = .03, d = −0.64) and 
family distress (p = .04, d = −0.57). Treatment group parents also reported greater short-term gains in positive affect 
(p =< .001, d = 0.77) and personal goal attainment (p = .007, d = 0.80), compared to the Waitlist group. Although there 
was no significant Group × Time interaction for other outcomes, stress (b = −2.58, p = .01), defusion (b = −3.78, p = .001), 
and  experiential  avoidance  (b =  −4.22,  p = .01)  showed  improvement  for  the  Treatment  group,  but  not  the  Waitlist 
group, at post-intervention. All Treatment group improvements were maintained at follow-up. Results suggest that a 
brief ACT group intervention is efficacious for improving some aspects of mental health for parents of autistic children.

Lay abstract 
Parents of autistic children commonly experience difficulties with their own mental health. This study looked at the 
effects of a brief group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy program, developed for parents of autistic children, 
youth, and adults. ACT focuses on increasing psychological flexibility, which is the ability to be mindful and accepting 
of  difficult  thoughts  and  experiences,  shown  to  be  important  for  mental  wellness.  Participants  included  54  parents 
of autistic people, ages 3–34. Parents were randomly divided into two groups: a Treatment group that received the 
intervention right away, and a Waitlist group that completed the program after the Treatment group completed the 
trial. All parents filled out questionnaires right before the program began, and at 3, 7, and 17 weeks after randomization. 
Compared to the group that was waiting to participate in the program, parents in the Treatment group reported greater 
improvements in depression and family distress, and these improvements were still present 4 months later. Parents in 
the Treatment group also reported short-term improvements in their positive feelings and personal goals, compared to 
those waiting. Results showed that ACT may help improve some aspects of mental health for parents of autistic children, 
but further research is recommended.

Autism 28(2)

Parents of autistic children1 commonly experience greater 
levels of stress, anxiety, and depression compared to par-
ents of children who do not have a disability, and their lev-
els  of  chronic  stress  have  been  shown  to  surpass  levels 
experienced  by  parents  of  children  with  other  develop-
mental disabilities (Bitsika & Sharpley, 2004; Estes et al., 
2009).  Given  the  high  stress  experienced  by  parents  of 
autistic children (Hayes & Watson, 2013), it follows that 
parents would experience their own challenges that require 
parent-focused support.

Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  (ACT)  has 
emerged  as  an  intervention  with  a  strong  evidence  base 
supporting  its  use  for  caregivers  (Han  et  al.,  2021).  The 
ACT  framework  focuses  on  helping  individuals  improve 
psychological flexibility, which involves increasing open-
ness  and  mindful  awareness  in  the  present  moment,  and 
acceptance  of  difficult  experiences  (Hayes  et  al.,  2006). 
The  overall  aim  of ACT  is  not  to  decrease  psychological 
distress, but to increase one’s effectiveness in pursuing val-
ues that are personally meaningful, even in the context of 
difficult  symptoms  or  circumstances  (Harris,  2006).  In 
addition to rewards and positive impacts of raising an autis-
tic child that many parents report (Kayfitz et al., 2010), par-
ents  of  autistic  children  also  describe  making  significant 
adjustments to their lives to support their child’s care, such 
as career changes, or devoting very limited time to social or 
personal  activities  (Meirsschaut  et  al.,  2010).  They  may 
have difficulty navigating inaccessible care systems, unsup-
portive social systems, or adjusting to a parenting experi-
ence  that  can  involve  a  high  level  of  daily  childcare 
demands  (Meirsschaut  et  al.,  2010).  As  a  result,  parents 
may experience difficult thoughts and feelings in response 
to  these  real  challenges  and  stressors. Acceptance,  there-
fore, may be a more appropriate framework than treatment 
modalities that focus on problem-solving. The use of psy-
chological acceptance has also been shown to be an impor-
tant protective factor in the well-being of parents of autistic 
children (Jones et al., 2014; Weiss et al., 2012). In addition, 
parents  of  autistic  children  report  that  they  employ  more 
avoidance  coping  (i.e.  cognitive  distancing/minimizing; 
escape behaviors) than parents of children without autism, 
which may be related to increased strain on the family sys-
tem  (Sivberg,  2002).  Avoidance  coping,  although  some-
times adaptive in the short term, is associated with increased 
stress  and  mental  health  problems  over  time  (Hastings 
et al., 2005). As such, these parents may benefit from inter-
ventions that help decrease the use of psychological avoid-
ance and promote psychological acceptance.

There is a growing literature demonstrating the effec-
tiveness of ACT among parents of autistic children. In the 
first  published  study  of ACT  for  parents  of  autistic  chil-
dren,  Blackledge  and  Hayes  (2006)  delivered  a  2-day 
workshop  to  20  parents.  Participants  demonstrated  post-
intervention  improvements  in  self-reported  depression, 
distress,  experiential  avoidance,  and  cognitive  fusion.  In 
another study, two 4 h ACT workshops were delivered to 

five mothers of children with intellectual and developmen-
tal  disabilities  who  displayed  high  levels  of  challenging 
behavior (Reid et al., 2016). Analysis of post-intervention 
interviews revealed that parents reported a better ability to 
cope with stress, increased emotional wellbeing for them-
selves and their child, and the ability to take a more mind-
ful perspective on their difficulties. In a multiple baseline 
repeated  measures  analysis  of  three  mothers  of  autistic 
children who participated in six 90-min sessions of ACT, 
parents increased in their use of values-guided behaviors 
(Gould et al., 2018) post-training and 6 months later.

In India, Poddar and colleagues (2015) delivered ACT 
individually  to  five  mothers  of  autistic  children  over  10 
sessions.  Improvements  in  parent  self-reports  of  depres-
sive and anxious symptoms, psychological flexibility, and 
quality  of  life  were  noted  post-intervention.  In  Iran,  an 
8-week  group ACT  intervention  provided  to  12  mothers 
was superior to 8 weeks of individual counseling for reduc-
ing self-reports of depression and experiential avoidance, 
although group assignment was not random (Joekar et al., 
2016).

In  a  study  with  a  slightly  larger  sample,  Lunsky  and 
colleagues (2018) delivered a brief ACT workshop to 29 
mothers of autistic children and young adults. In addition 
to having ACT expertise, facilitators were also parents of 
autistic  children.  Post-intervention,  improvements  were 
seen  in  parents’  self-reports  of  depression,  stress,  per-
ceived physical health, and social isolation, and improve-
ments  in  all  but  social  isolation  were  maintained  at 
follow-up.  A  second  study  of  this  cohort  reported  that 
mothers also indicated improvements in cognitive fusion, 
psychological  flexibility,  and  values-consistent  action, 
which were maintained at follow-up (Fung et al., 2018a).

One of the only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 
ACT for parents focused on parents of children with cere-
bral palsy, where researchers added a 4 h ACT training for 
parents who were already receiving a parenting interven-
tion,  compared  to  a  randomly  assigned  waitlist  control 
group  and  a  parent  training  only  group.  The  addition  of 
ACT training resulted in improved parent reports of child 
quality of life and reduced parental depression and stress, 
compared to the waitlist group (Whittingham et al., 2015). 
This study did not compare receiving only ACT to a con-
trol condition, making it difficult to determine the relative 
impact of ACT on the improvements observed. In the only 
RCT  to  date  testing  the  efficacy  of  ACT  for  parents  of 
autistic children (age 5–13), nine parents receiving Applied 
Behavior Analysis (ABA) participated in a 4 h ACT work-
shop,  compared  to  nine  parents  who  received ABA  only 
(Hahs et al., 2018). The ACT group demonstrated signifi-
cantly  greater  improvements  compared  to  the ABA-only 
group  in  self-reports  of  mindfulness,  experiential  avoid-
ance,  cognitive  fusion,  consistency  toward  personal  val-
ues, and depression, but no follow-up was employed.

ACT has yet to be evaluated in parents of autistic chil-
dren using both a randomized controlled design and a large 

Maughan et al.

enough  sample  to  increase  generalizability  to  the  larger 
population  of  parents  of  autistic  children.  Further,  while 
there is evidence that in families of autistic children, par-
ent-focused interventions can also serve to improve child 
behavior  and  mental  health  (Neece,  2014;  Singh  et  al., 
2006, 2014) and family adjustment (Tonge et al., 2006), no 
studies have examined child and family outcomes follow-
ing ACT interventions for parents. Finally, as ACT is meant 
to improve psychological flexibility and positive function-
ing while not necessarily decreasing symptoms, it is essen-
tial that evaluations of ACT include outcome measures that 
assess positive aspects of parent functioning as well, rather 
than focusing only on reduction of problems.

Aim

The current study tested the efficacy of a brief, manualized 
group-based ACT workshop developed for parents of chil-
dren,  adolescents,  and  adults2  with  neurodevelopmental 
disabilities,  including  autism.  A  randomized  controlled 
design  compared  a  Treatment  group  that  completed  the 
program immediately to a Waitlist control condition. The 
primary outcome was reduction in parent depression, and 
secondary outcomes included other aspects of parent men-
tal  health,  positive  functioning,  and  goal  attainment.  We 
also  investigated  the  extent  to  which  the  intervention 
impacted the mental health of children of participating par-
ents,  and  overall  family  functioning.  We  predicted  that 
parents who were offered the ACT program would report 
improvements in their mental health, positive functioning, 
goal attainment, and in their child’s mental health and fam-
ily’s functioning, relative to the waitlist condition.

Method

Participants

Participants included 54 parents of autistic children, ado-
lescents, and adults ages 3 to 34 years. To be included in 
the  study,  parents  had  to  provide  documentation  of  their 
child’s  autism  diagnosis  from  a  health  care  practitioner 
qualified to diagnose autism in Ontario, Canada (i.e. clini-
cal psychologist, pediatric/general practitioner physician, 
or psychiatrist). Additional inclusion criteria were the abil-
ity  to  speak  English  and  identify  therapy  goals,  and  no 
prior exposure to ACT.

Program description

The intervention was a three-session workshop, developed 
by Fung and colleagues (2018b) and described in detail by 
Lunsky and colleagues (2018). The first session involved a 
3 h  introduction  to  the  ACT  processes,  and  participants 
were  introduced  to  mindfulness  through  an  experiential 
guided  imagery  exercise.  The  second  full-day  session 
included  didactic, 
occurred 

the  following  day  and 

experiential, and mindfulness activities to demonstrate the 
concepts of ACT, and linked material to the experience of 
parenting an autistic person. Guided activities were inter-
spersed with paired sharing, group discussion, and videos. 
At the end of session 2, participants committed to engag-
ing  in  one  action  that  aligned  with  their  values.  A  3 h 
refresher session was conducted 1 month later.

Measures

Sample characteristics.  The parent-report Social Communi-
cation Questionnaire–Lifetime version (SCQ; Rutter et al., 
2003) was used to measure autism symptoms. The parent-
report  Scales  of  Independent  Behavior–Revised  Short 
Form  (SIB-R;  Bruininks  et  al.,  1996)  measured  adaptive 
functioning.  The  SIB-R  uses  a  standard  score  (M = 100, 
SD = 15, Range: 0–200).

Primary outcome

Depression.  Symptoms  of  depression  were  measured 
using  the  7-item  Depression  subscale  of  the  Depression 
Anxiety  Stress  Scale–21  (DASS-21;  Lovibond  &  Lovib-
ond, 1995). Item responses reference the past week and use 
a 4-point scale (0 = Never to 3 = Almost Always). Subscale 
scores can fall into the ranges of normal, mild, moderate, 
severe, or extremely severe. These severity labels charac-
terize the range of scores in the population; a mild score 
does not indicate mild level of disorder and is below the 
typical severity of those seeking help (Lovibond & Lovi-
bond, 1995). Therefore, a “moderate” score (7 or higher) 
was used to define depression of clinical concern. Internal 
consistency for Depression was good in the current sample 
(α = 0.89).

Secondary outcomes

Parent mental health and positive functioning.  The 7-item 
Stress  subscale  of  the  DASS-21  was  used  to  measure 
symptoms  of  stress.  Internal  consistency  was  α = 0.84  in 
the current sample.

Two  subscales  of  the  Parenting  Stress  Index–Fourth 
Edition  (PSI-4;  Abidin,  2012)  were  used.  The  6-item 
Isolation subscale measures perceived social isolation and 
the  5-item  Health  subscale  measures  perceived  physical 
health in relation to parenthood. Parents were asked to ref-
erence  the  past  week.  Items  were  rated  on  5-point  scale 
(1 = Strongly Agree  to  5 = Strongly  Disagree).  The  PSI-4 
has been previously used with parents of autistic children 
(Feinberg  et  al.,  2014;  Lunsky  et  al.,  2018;  Thullen  & 
Bonsall,  2017).  In  this  sample,  internal  consistency  was 
acceptable (Isolation α = 0.76, Health α = 0.70).

The  Positive  &  Negative  Affect  Schedule  (PANAS; 
Crawford  &  Henry,  2004)  is  a  20-item  measure  that 
assesses respondents’ experiences of different positive and 
negative  emotions  over  the  past  week.  Only  the  positive 
affect subscale was used, which has items that include 10 

370 

Autism 28(2)

positive  (i.e.  active,  determined)  mood  words,  and 
respondents  report  the  extent  to  which  they  experienced 
each  mood  over  the  last  week  (1 = Not  at  all  to 
5 = Extremely). The PANAS demonstrated excellent inter-
nal consistency in the current sample (α = .90 for Positive 
Affect)  and  in  previous  studies  with  parents  of  autistic 
children the Positive Affect subscale has been associated 
with other positive parental outcomes (e.g. optimism, psy-
chological well-being; Ekas et al., 2010).

To  assess  goal  attainment,  at  screening,  participants 
identified  three  goals  they  hoped  to  attain  through  com-
pleting the workshop. At baseline, goals were refined with 
the  assistance  of  a  clinically-trained  graduate  student  to 
they  were  Specific,  Measurable,  Attainable, 
ensure 
Relevant, and Timed, and Goal Attainment Scaling, a pro-
cedure  typically  used  in  rehabilitation  intervention,  was 
used  to  track  progress  (Bovend’Eerdt  et  al.,  2009).  For 
each  goal,  operationalized  definitions  were  created  to 
describe the participant’s target behaviors if their goal was 
achieved  (0),  slightly  exceeded  (+1),  greatly  exceeded 
(+2), not quite achieved (−1) or nowhere near (−2), to cre-
ate an individualized reference guide. At each assessment 
time  point,  participants  were  electronically  sent  their 
guide, which they referenced to select the number that rep-
resented their progress toward each goal.

For  the  analysis,  participants’  highest  goal  attainment 
score at each time point was used (i.e. the goal for which 
the  participant  indicated  the  highest  achievement  rating 
could  differ  between  time  points).  We  analyzed  partici-
pants’ highest achieved goal (and thus the goal they were 
prioritizing) rather than totaling achievement of all goals, 
as the three goals may not have been considered equally 
important  to  participants.  Focusing  on  one  priority  goal 
allowed for the examination of what meaningful change in 
one area could look like. Other research using goal attain-
ment  scaling  has  found  utility  in  selecting  the  highest-
ranking goal for analysis (Jennings et al., 2018; McGarrigle 
& Rockwood, 2020). To capture the effect of the program 
on whether goals were attained or not, the resulting values 
were dichotomized into 0 (not quite achieved or nowhere 
near  achieved)  and  1  (achieved  or  slightly  exceeded  or 
greatly exceeded). Past research on goal scaling has also 
analyzed reports in this manner (e.g. Chiarello et al., 2020; 
Jennings et al., 2018).

ACT process measures.  The Acceptance & Action Ques-
tionnaire-II (AAQ-II; Bond et al., 2011) was used to meas-
ure psychological flexibility and acceptance. The AAQ-II 
is  a  7-item  questionnaire  on  which  items  are  rated  on  a 
7-point  scale  to  provide  an  overall  score.  Higher  scores 
indicate greater levels of acceptance and less experiential 
avoidance. The AAQ-II showed excellent internal consist-
ency, α = .92. The AAQ and AAQ-II have been used previ-
ously in studies of parents of autistic children (Blackledge 
& Hayes, 2006; Hahs et al., 2018 respectively).

The Valued Living Questionnaire (VLQ; Wilson et al., 
2010) is a two-part questionnaire that measures the extent 
to which respondents are in contact with their chosen val-
ues  in  everyday  life.  First,  the  participant  indicates  the 
importance  they  place  on  10  life  areas  (e.g.  friendship, 
work,  spirituality),  on  a  10-point  scale  from  Not  at  all 
important to Very important. In the second part, they indi-
cate how consistent their actions currently are in each val-
ued  area  on  a  10-point  scale,  ranging  from  Completely 
inconsistent to Completely consistent. In this sample, the 
VLQ  demonstrated  acceptable 
internal  consistency 
(Importance  α = .69,  Consistency  α = .83,  Valued  Living 
Composite α = .76). The VLQ has been used in other stud-
ies with parents (Fung et al., 2018a).

The Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ; Gillanders 
et al., 2014) is a 7-item measure used to assess the degree 
to  which  respondents  report  currently  feeling  distressed 
by,  getting  caught  up  with,  or  struggling  to  let  go  of 
thoughts.  Statements  are  rated  on  a  7-point  Likert-type 
scale (1 = Never true to 7 = Always true). Internal consist-
ency was excellent in the current sample, α = .93. The CFQ 
has  been  used  in  studies  of  parents  of  autistic  children 
(Fung et al., 2018a; Hahs et al., 2018).

The  Bangor  Mindful  Parenting  Scale  (BMPS;  Jones 
et al., 2014) is a 15-item questionnaire that measures par-
ents’ degree of mindfulness in their parenting and interac-
tions  with  their  children.  Respondents  rate  items  on  a 
4-point  scale  (0 = Never  true  to  3 = Always  true).  It  has 
been used previously in studies of parents of children with 
autism and other disabilities (Lunsky et al., 2015). Internal 
consistency  for  the  total  score  was  α = .79  in  the  current 
sample.

Youth mental health and family functioning.  The Strengths 
&  Difficulties  Questionnaire  (SDQ;  Goodman,  2001) 
assesses mental health difficulties broadly in children and 
youth. In line with SDQ guidelines, when administered at 
baseline, parents were asked to reference the past 6 months, 
and at subsequent time points the reference period was the 
past  1 month.  The  measure  has  subscales  for  Emotional 
Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity-Inattention, 
Peer Problems, Prosocial Behavior, Impact, and Total Dif-
ficulties. Respondents provided item ratings on a 3-point 
scale (1 = Not true to 3 = Certainly true). Internal consisten-
cies were acceptable for most subscales of the SDQ in the 
current  sample,  ranging  from  α = .69  to  .72,  except  Peer 
Problems  (α = .46).  The  SDQ  is  often  used  in  studies  of 
autistic children (Allik et al., 2006; Chalfant et al., 2007).

The  Brief  Family  Distress  Scale  (BFDS;  Weiss  & 
Lunsky, 2011) was used to obtain a measure of the current 
level of crisis parents perceive in their family. Respondents 
indicate, on a scale from 1 to 10, which numbered state-
ment most accurately represents the state of their family’s 
current  distress.  Statements  range  from  1 = everything  is 
fine, my family and I are not in crisis at all, 5 = things are 

Maughan et al.

very  stressful,  but  we  are  getting  by  with  a  lot  of  effort, 
10 = we  are  currently  in  crisis,  and  it  could  not  get  any 
worse. The BFDS has been used in other studies of parents 
of  children  with  developmental  disabilities  (Hastings, 
2016; McKenzie et al., 2017).

The  General  Functioning  subscale  of  the  McMaster 
Family Assessment Device (FAD; Epstein et al., 1983) was 
used  as  a  measure  of  family  functioning  over  the  past  2 
weeks. Responses for each of the 12 items are provided on 
a  4-point  scale,  ranging  from  Strongly  agree  to  Strongly 
disagree.  This  tool  has  been  used  in  parents  of  children 
with disabilities (Brown et al., 2015) and had good internal 
consistency (α = .82) in the current sample.

Procedure

Recruitment.  The  study  was  approved  by  ethics  boards  at 
York  University,  the  Centre  for  Addiction  and  Mental 
Health,  and  Surrey  Place  in  Toronto,  Ontario.  This  study 
was  registered  prior  to  data  collection  with  the  ISRCTN 
registry  (97093664).  See  Supplemental  Table  1  for  the 
Consolidated  Standards  of  Reporting  Trials  (CONSORT) 
Checklist.  Participants  were  recruited  from  postings  on 
websites of child autism community agencies, autism ser-
vice  e-newsletters,  and  referrals  from  the  community 
between January-November 2019. Interested parents were 
invited to participate in a telephone screening interview to 
assess eligibility. For participants who met screening crite-
ria, study procedures were explained, and written informed 
consent  was  obtained.  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  77  partici-
pants were screened, with 7 excluded for not meeting inclu-
sion criteria, and 7 declining to participate. Power analyses 
using G*Power 3.1 indicated that a sample size of 55 would 
be  sufficient  to  detect  medium  effects.  No  participants 
reported experiencing harm from participation in the trial.

Randomization.  Following  the  baseline  appointment,  the 
first author randomized parents into either the Treatment 
or  Waitlist  group  using  online  randomization  software 
(Urbaniak & Plous, 2015). Participant randomization was 
stratified by gender, to ensure approximately equal num-
bers of males and females in each group. Sixty-three par-
ticipants  were  randomized.  If  partners  participated 
together,  one  was  randomly  excluded  from  the  analysis 
(n = 9), leaving 27 in each group. Parents in the Treatment 
group participated in their assigned ACT workshop within 
2 weeks. Waitlisted parents participated in the intervention 
after the follow-up time point.

Study  design.  Following  participant  screening,  baseline 
data were collected within 2 weeks prior to the commence-
ment  of  the  workshop.  Parents  completed  demographic 
and  evaluation  measures  online,  and  goals  were  defined 
during a phone appointment. Child social communication 
abilities  and  adaptive  functioning  were  assessed  at 

baseline; the SCQ was administered online, and the SIB-R 
was completed during the phone appointment in interview 
format.

All  outcome  measures  (DASS-21,  PANAS,  PSI-4, 
AAQ-II,  VLQ,  CFQ,  BMPS,  BFDS,  FAD,  SDQ,  goal 
attainment)  were  administered  online  at  7 weeks  post-
baseline (post-refresher/ Time 3) and 17 weeks post-base-
line  (follow-up/Time  4).  The  primary  outcome  measure 
(DASS-21  Depression),  as  well  as  four  additional  brief 
measures  (DASS-21  Stress,  PANAS,  BFDS,  goal  attain-
ment) were re-administered at the mid-point of treatment 
(3 weeks  post-randomization/Time  2).  These  measures 
were  selected  to  obtain  a  brief  snapshot  of  four  areas  of 
functioning (i.e. mental health, positive functioning, fam-
ily  distress,  and  behavior  change)  immediately  after  the 
first two intervention sessions/wait. Following Time 4 data 
collection,

Community involvement

Families of autistic individuals were involved in this study. 
Parents of autistic people designed the intervention (Fung 
et al., 2018b) and co-facilitated every workshop, working 
in  partnership  with  clinicians.  No  autistic  people  were 
involved in the research process.

Data analysis

Using  SPSS  version  27,  we  performed  a  series  of  linear 
mixed  effects  regression  analyses  at  each  post-treatment

come  measure  (DASS-21  Depression,  DASS-21  Stress, 
PANAS, PSI-4, AAQ-II, VLQ, CFQ, BMPS, BFDS, FAD, 
SDQ).  As  fixed  effects,  we  entered  Group  (Treatment/
Waitlist), Time (two levels: Baseline and Time 2 or 3), and 
Group × Time interaction into the model. The interaction 
directly  tested  whether  Treatment  and  Waitlist  groups 
showed a different pattern of change in outcome measures 
at the different study time points. As random effects, we 
included an intercept for subjects to account for repeated 
measurements.  Mixed  effects  models  accommodate  for 
missing values using the maximum likelihood method, and 
therefore,  this  analysis  included  all  randomized  partici-
pants (N = 54 [9 partners excluded]).

Cohen’s d effect sizes were calculated using the differ-
ence  in  change  scores  between  Treatment  and  Waitlist 
groups, divided by the pooled standard deviation at base-
line.  Effect  size  magnitudes  were  defined  as:  negligible 
(<0.20),  small  (0.20–0.49),  medium  (0.50–0.79),  and 
large (⩾0.80) (Cohen, 1992).

Differences between the Treatment and Waitlist groups 
in their goal attainment (i.e. goal achieved/not achieved) 
were  tested  using  Pearson  chi-square  analyses.  Missing 
goal  attainment  values  were  imputed  in  SPSS  using

multiple imputation, including all demographic variables, 
baseline scores, and variables in the analysis as predictors. 
Chi-square values from 10 imputed datasets were pooled 
in  R  using  the  micombine.chisquare  function  from  
miceadds (Enders, 2010). This function produces a com-
bined statistic, which is approximately F-distributed. Odds 
ratio was used as the effect size measure.

Two analyses included treatment completers only from 
the Treatment group (n = 18), who completed the full 3-day 
intervention with refresher, in addition to all Waitlist par-
ticipants (n = 27). First, for depression, the number of par-
ticipants  in  each  group  who  moved  from  the  clinical  to 
non-clinical range was calculated at Time 2 and Time 3. 
The  interaction  between  Group  and  improvement  to  the

non-clinical  range  was  tested  using  Pearson  chi-square 
analyses.  Second,  to  assess  whether  improvements  were 
maintained  at  4-month  follow-up  (only  possible  for  the 
Treatment group), linear mixed effects regression analyses 
were  performed  on  treatment  completers  (n = 18)  with 
Time (two levels: Time 3 and Time 4) as the fixed effect, 
and subjects’ intercept as a random effect.

Results

Baseline demographics

There were no significant differences in participant char-
acteristics at baseline (see Table 1). Participants were 83% 
female, two thirds had completed university, and approxi-
mately one third were currently taking psychotropic medi-
cation. All 54 participants completed the survey at Time 1. 
At Time 2, 48 participants completed the survey (88.9%), 
at Time 3, 45 participants (83.3%), and at Time 4, 46 par-
ticipants (85.2%).

Primary outcome

Depression.  At  Time  2  (mid-point),  following  the  main 
2-day workshop, parents in the Treatment group demon-
strated  significant  reductions  in  depression  scores  (b = 
−3.21,  p = .001),  whereas  these  improvements  were  not 
seen for the Waitlist group (b = 0.46, p = .51), with a large 
Time  ×  Condition  interaction  (see  Table  2).  At  Time  3 
(post-refresher),  the  Treatment  group  showed  sustained 
reductions in depression scores (b = −2.60, p = .03) and the 
Waitlist  continued  to  show  no  reduction  in  depression 
(b = 0.08 p = .88), with a medium Time × Condition effect.
In the Treatment group, 18 participants completed the 
refresher. 
full  3-day 
Improvements  observed  in  the  Treatment  group  were 
maintained  at  4-month  follow-up,  with  no  differences 
among treatment completers between Time 3 and Time 4 
depression  scores  (b =  −0.14;  p = .90;  see  Supplemental 
Table 3 for Time 4 analyses).

Improvement  from  clinical  to  non-clinical  range.  Out 
of  18  treatment  completers,  12  had  depression  scores  in 
the  moderate  or  higher  range  at  baseline.  Of  the  12,  10 
parents  entered  the  non-clinical  range  for  depression  by 
Time  2  (83%),  and  8  remained  non-clinical  by  Time  3 
(67%  improvement).  In  the  Waitlist  group,  none  of  the 
10 participants who were in the clinical range at baseline 
moved to the non-clinical range at Time 2, and 3 became 
non-clinical by Time 3 (30%). At Time 2, there was a sig-
nificant interaction between Group and moving to the non-
clinical range (χ2 (1) = 15.28, p =< .001), which attenuated 
by Time 3 (χ2 (1) = 2.93, p = .09). By Time 3, two Waitlist 
participants originally in the non-clinical range moved to a 
clinical score on the depression subscale, as did one Treat-
ment group participant.

Secondary outcomes

Parent  mental  health  and  positive  functioning.  Values  for 
between-group analyses for all secondary outcomes can be 
found in Supplemental Table 2. There was no significant 
Time × Condition effect for stress at Time 2 or Time 3. At 
Time 2, while the Treatment group did not have a signifi-
cant  reduction  in  stress  from  baseline,  there  was  a  trend 
toward  reduction  (b =  −1.67,  p = .07),  which  was  not 
observed in the Waitlist group (b = 0.22, p = .80). At Time 
3, significant improvements in stress from baseline were 
observed in the Treatment group (b = −2.58, p = .01), but 
not for the Waitlist group (b = −0.99, p = .17). At follow-
up,  maintenance  of  the  improvements  in  stress  between 
baseline and Time 3 was seen, with no significant changes 
from Time 3 to Time 4 for treatment completers (b = 0.67, 
p = .43).

At Time 2, there was a significant Time  × Condition 
interaction for positive affect, with a small effect size. The 
Treatment  group  showed  an  increase  in  positive  affect 
(b = 2.76,  p = .02),  whereas  the  Waitlist  group  had  lower 
positive affect at Time 2 (b = −2.95, p =< .001). At Time 3, 
there was no treatment effect observed for positive affect.
At Time 3, there was no significant Time × Condition 
interaction  for  parenting  stress-related  health,  but  there 
was  a  trend  toward  more  improvement  in  the  Treatment 
group (b = −0.89, p = .16) than the Waitlist group (b = 0.84, 
p = .20).  For  isolation,  there  was  no  Time  ×  Condition 
effect, nor any within-group change for either group.

Goal  attainment.  At  Time  2,  81.9%  of  the  Treatment 
group had met at least one of their goals, compared to 43.0% 
of the Waitlist group, and there was a significant association 
between  Group  and  goal  attainment,  F(1,  461.41) = 7.47, 
p = .007,  d = 0.80.  Based  on  the  odds  ratio,  the  odds  of 
achieving  or  exceeding  one’s  goal  was  5.99  times  higher 
if in the Treatment group than in the Waitlist group (95% 
confidence  interval:1.73,  20.70). This  association  was  not 
present  at  Time  3,  F(1,  394.16) = 1.45, p = .23,  d = 0.33  or 
at Time 4, F(1, 637.51) = 0.12, p = .73, d = 0.09. At Time 3, 
75.2% of the Treatment group was achieving or exceeding 
their goal, compared to 58.1% for the Waitlist group.

ACT  process  measures.  There  was  no  Time  ×  Condition 
effect for any ACT process measures. Looking at within-
group change for each group, improvements were observed 
in  the  Treatment  group  for  experiential  avoidance  (b = 
−4.22, p = .01) and cognitive fusion (b = −3.78, p = .001), 
whereas  none  were  observed  for  the  Waitlist  group  (b = 
−0.86,  p = .56  and  b =  −2.03,  p = .11  respectively).  There 
was no significant within-group change for valued living 
or mindful parenting at Time 3 for either group. At 4-month 
follow-up, maintenance of the Treatment group’s improve-
ments between baseline and Time 3 was seen for experien-
tial avoidance. While not significant, there was also a trend 
toward  further  improvement  (b =  −2.76;  p = .07).  There

to Time 4 for treatment completers (b = 0.05, p = .77). There 
was  no  within-group  change  or Time  ×  Condition  effect 
for general family functioning or youth mental health.

Discussion

The current study used an RCT design to test the efficacy 
of a brief, group-based ACT intervention for mothers and 
fathers  of  autistic  children,  adolescents,  and  adults. 
Overall, the intervention resulted in gains for parents, with 
the greatest treatment effects observed for parent depres-
sion  and  family  distress,  which  were  maintained  at  the 
4-month follow-up. Parents also reported short-term gains 
with respect to personal goal attainment, and small changes 
in positive affect. Although there was no significant Group 
× Time interaction for stress, cognitive fusion, and experi-
ential avoidance, all these outcomes showed improvement, 

with  small  effect  sizes,  for  the  Treatment  group  at  post-
intervention,  while  the  Waitlist  group  did  not  improve; 
these  within-group  changes  were  also  maintained  at  fol-
low-up.  Parents  did  not  report  any  significant  improve-
ments  with  respect  to  mindful  parenting,  valued  living, 
overall family functioning, or child mental health.

Parent mental health and positive functioning

The most consistent treatment effect was seen for parent 
depression. These findings align with previous studies of 
ACT for parents of autistic people (Blackledge & Hayes, 
2006;  Joekar  et  al.,  2016;  Lunsky  et  al.,  2018;  Poddar 
et  al.,  2015),  wherein  parent  self-reports  of  depression 
decreased  post-intervention.  In  our  study,  67%  of 
Treatment  condition  participants  with  clinical  levels  of 
depression were in the normal range at Time 3, compared 
to  only  30%  of  those  in  the  Waitlist  condition.  While 
Blackledge  and  Hayes  had  some  evidence  for  cognitive 
defusion as a mediator for depression improvements, and 
studies of ACT in other populations also show post-treat-
ment  defusion  mediating  changes  in  depression  (Zettle 
et al., 2011), our sample showed less change in defusion 
than found in prior research. Fung and colleagues (2018) 
did  report  that  post-ACT  intervention  improvements  in 
mental health for mothers of autistic children were medi-
ated  by 
in  values-consistent  action. 
Although our sample did not show change in their reports 
of  how  consistently  they  acted  in  accordance  with  their 
values,  they  did  in  action  toward  individually-set  goals, 
which could underlie the changes in depression observed. 
Additional  research  with  a  larger  cohort  of  participants 
would  help  to  better  elucidate  the  relationship  between

valued  living,  goals,  cognitive  fusion,  and  depression  in 
parents of autistic youth.

Conversely, no significant differences between groups 
for  stress  were  reported.  Parents  of  autistic  children  can 
experience chronic stressors, including high levels of men-
tal health problems in their autistic youth (e.g. Simonoff 
et al., 2008). Indeed, in the current study, the average child 
mental health problems score was in the “very high” range, 
including specific conduct problems ranging from “raised” 
to “high,” and the overall impact of these problems in the 
“very  high”  range.  These  family  characteristics  may 
require  targeted  interventions  before  pronounced  differ-
ences are seen in parents’ personal experience of stress.

Parents who participated in ACT had greater increases 
in positive affect compared to the Waitlist group at Time 2, 
though the effect was small and dissipated by Time 3. The 
link between positive affect and perceived social support 
in parents of children with disabilities has been repeatedly 
demonstrated (Findler et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2012), and 
it follows that positive affect would increase immediately 
after an intensive workshop designed to allow parents with 
similar  experiences  to  connect.  This  may  not  have  been 
maintained as time passed, without sustained social con-
nections or ongoing engagement with the material.

Goal attainment, similarly, showed a large group differ-
ence at Time 2, which was no longer apparent at Time 3. At 
Time 2, the Treatment group was six times more likely to 
report achieving or exceeding one of their goals, with 82% 
of the Treatment parents and only 43% of the Waitlist par-
ents indicating goal achievement. Recent research on goal 
attainment indicates that ongoing progress is most likely 
when  goals  are  set  just  slightly  out  of  reach,  balancing 
challenge  while  preventing  discouragement  (Chevance 
et al., 2021). Further, ACT encourages parents to shift their 
behavior to align with their most closely held values. Since 
many Treatment group participants had already achieved 
or  exceeded  their  highest-rated  goal  just  after  the  work-
shop weekend, they might have benefited from re-setting 
their goals higher after reaching them, or based on values 
they identified and prioritized in the workshop. Last, as the 
highest-rated  goal  may  have  differed  at  different  time 
points,  we  cannot  say  whether  attainment  of  a  particular 
goal  was  maintained  for  each  participant  at  subsequent 
measurement  times,  only  that  many  reported  attaining  at 
least one of their goals.

process-related  changes  take  several  months  to  become 
evident,  particularly  with  respect  to  behavior  change 
(González-Menéndez  et  al.,  2014;  Kohtala  et  al.,  2017). 
Further,  for  mindfulness-based  interventions,  there  is  a 
strong relation between degree of mindfulness practice at 
home  and  amount  of  improvement  in  mindfulness  and 
wellbeing (Carmody & Baer, 2009; Greenberg et al., 2018; 
Parsons et al., 2017). Published ACT manuals emphasize 
the importance of home practice (Hayes, 2005), and it is 
generally  established  that  practice  is  beneficial  to  maxi-
mize  effects  of  psychotherapy  in  general  (Hoet  et  al., 
2018). A weekly format with regular homework check-ins, 
or  individual  support,  might  support  more  practice  and 
therefore greater change in behavior.

Family functioning and child mental health

More  distal  outcomes  of  family  functioning  and  child 
mental health were also assessed. There were strong con-
sistent  treatment  effects  for  family  distress  (BFDS). 
Although the intervention is not intended to attenuate fam-
ily  crises,  participants  in ACT  are  encouraged  to  change 
their relationship to their internal and external experiences. 
The  BFDS  asks  parents  to  provide  a  broad  appraisal  of 
how  difficult  their  current  situation  is  and  post-interven-
tion, parents might have appraised their circumstances in a 
different light. It is also possible that reductions in distress 
occurred following experiences that were not sufficiently 
captured  in  our  process  measures.  For  instance,  partici-
pants engaged in positive, supportive, and relaxing activi-
ties, possibly providing a sense of greater ability to cope 
with  stressors  or  a  temporary  sense  of  relief,  translating 
into shifts in their experience of distress. Further, through 
engaging with fellow group members in similar situations, 
and sharing experiences of distress, it is possible that par-
ticipants  received  important  informal  social  support  that 
helped them to manage the stressors in their lives. Results 
do not support the hypothesis that a brief ACT workshop 
would result in changes in more general family function-
ing and child mental health. The factors affecting mental 
health problems are complex and multifaceted, with many 
unrelated  to  parenting  behavior  or  parent  mental  health, 
and require more direct management to result in improve-
ment (White et al., 2018).

Strengths and limitations

ACT psychological processes

In terms of the four ACT psychological processes, cogni-
tive  fusion  and  experiential  avoidance  showed  small 
improvements in the Treatment group only, though not to a 
degree  that  resulted  in  a  Group  × Time  interaction,  and 
there was no change in mindful parenting or valued living. 
As  shown  in  other  studies  of  ACT  interventions,  some 

This study had many strengths. This was one of only two 
RCTs testing the efficacy of ACT for improving well-being 
in parents of autistic children, allowing us to elucidate the 
treatment  effects  of  ACT  while  controlling  for  time  and 
repeated measurements. In addition, the inclusion of a fol-
low-up  assessment  ensures  that  longer-term  program 
effects  are  captured.  The  heterogeneity  of  the  sample,  in 

Maughan et al.

terms  of  including  fathers,  as  well  as  parents  of  autistic 
children  spanning  a  range  of  ages,  socio-communication 
functioning,  and  adaptive  skills,  is  also  a  strength,  and 
improves  generalizability  of  findings  to  more  parents  of 
autistic people.

There are also key limitations to our study. Participants 
were  recruited  mainly  through  autism  service  agencies, 
and many were already receiving supports and services for 
their child, which may limit generalization to families who 
do not have any support, or who are unwilling to poten-
tially  wait  4 months  to  receive  the  program.  Twenty-two 
Treatment  group  participants  completed  the  main  inter-
vention  weekend,  and  four  were  unable  to  attend  the 
refresher one month later, leaving only 18 full “treatment 
completers.”  In  addition,  all  outcomes  were  assessed 
through subjective parent report, which could potentially 
influence the validity of results or limit some effects of the 
intervention  being  captured.  Further,  the  high  average 
level  of  household  income  and  parent  education,  limited 
racial/ethnic diversity, and relatively low levels of parent 
mental health problems in this cohort limit the conclusions 
that can be drawn regarding the effect of ACT for parents 
with less education, with varying cultural backgrounds, or 
with greater need.

Conclusion

Given the higher levels of distress experienced by parents 
of  autistic  individuals  compared  to  parents  who  do  not 
have a child with a disability (Keenan et  al.,  2016), it  is 
crucial to identify brief, effective and accessible supports. 
This study aligns with the growing body of research that 
suggests  that  ACT  can  benefit  parents  across  multiple 
domains.  Important  next  steps  are  to  understand  more 
about parents’ experiences in the workshop to learn which 
aspects  of  the  intervention  are  most  useful.  This  might 
include a measure of social connection in the group. Future 
trials might also compare different modes of intervention 
delivery  (i.e.  weekly  vs  brief  intensive  format,  in-person 
vs  virtual  delivery)  as  well  as  the  effect  of  practice  or 
longer-term  support,  on  outcomes.  In  addition,  studies 
may  consider  implementing  assessments  of  children  and 
families  from  a  secondary  reporter,  such  as  a  teacher  or 
other  parent,  or  youth  self-report.  Finally,  it  would  be 
important to include a longer follow-up time point in addi-
tional RCTs of ACT.

Notes

1.  We recognize that there are many viewpoints with respect to 
selecting language to describe autism and other disabilities. 
We  use  identity-first  language  to  reflect  the  preference  of 
many autistic adults and their family members (Botha et al., 
2021; Kenny et al., 2016).

2.  The term children will subsequently be used to refer to par-
ticipating parents’ autistic children, regardless of the age of 
the child, adolescent, or adult.
