Abstract

Background:  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with cognitive impairments. It 
is unclear whether problems persist after PTSD symptoms remit.

Methods:  Data came from 12,270 trauma-exposed women in the Nurses’ Health Study II. 
Trauma and PTSD symptoms were assessed using validated scales to determine PTSD status as 
of 2008 (trauma/no PTSD, remitted PTSD, unresolved PTSD) and symptom severity (lifetime and 
past-month). Starting in 2014, cognitive function was assessed using the Cogstate Brief Battery 
every six or 12 months for up to 24 months. PTSD associations with baseline cognition and 
longitudinal cognitive changes were estimated by covariate-adjusted linear regression and linear 
mixed-effects models, respectively.

Results:  Compared to women with trauma/no PTSD, women with remitted PTSD symptoms had 
similar cognitive function at baseline, while women with unresolved PTSD symptoms had worse 
psychomotor speed/attention and learning/working memory. In women with unresolved PTSD 
symptoms, past-month PTSD symptom severity was inversely associated with baseline cognition. 
Over follow-up, both women with remitted and unresolved PTSD symptoms in 2008, especially 
those with high levels of symptoms, had a faster decline in learning/working memory than women 
with trauma/no PTSD. In women with remitted PTSD symptoms, higher lifetime PTSD symptom 
severity was associated with faster decline in learning/working memory. Results were robust to the 
adjustment for sociodemographic, biobehavioral, and health factors and were partially attenuated 
when adjusted for depression.

Conclusion:  Unresolved but not remitted PTSD was associated with worse cognitive function 
assessed six years later. Accelerated cognitive decline was observed among women with either 
unresolved or remitted PTSD symptoms.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental disorder that can occur in 
people who have experienced traumatic events such as sexual assault, natural disasters, or 
terrorist attacks. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is estimated to be 3.9% globally and 6.8% 
in the United States (U.S.), and it is approximately twice as common in women than men 
(Kessler et al., 2005; Koenen et al., 2017). Compared to men, women with PTSD tend to be 
exposed to traumatic events at a younger age, may experience more severe symptoms, and 
are more likely to have comorbid mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety disorders 
(Olff, 2017; Olff, Langeland, Draijer, & Gersons, 2007).

Accumulating evidence has linked PTSD with increased risk of developing various chronic 
diseases in both men and women, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (Dyball, Evans, 
Boos, Stevelink, & Fear, 2019; Kubzansky, Koenen, Spiro, Vokonas, & Sparrow, 2007; 
Sumner et al., 2015), type 2 diabetes (Roberts et al., 2015; Vancampfort et al., 2016), and 
dementia (Desmarais et al., 2020), as well as all-cause mortality (Boscarino, 2006; Roberts, 
Kubzansky, Chibnik, Rimm, & Koenen, 2020). There is also a growing body of literature 
linking PTSD with poor cognitive function and accelerated cognitive aging, including our 
previous research in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) (Clouston et al., 2019; Greenberg, 
Tanev, Marin, & Pitman, 2014; Lawn et al., 2022; Roberts et al., 2022; Rosen et al., 2022; 
Schuitevoerder et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2015; Sumner et al., 2017).

While some individuals experience chronic or recurrent PTSD symptoms, others’ symptoms 
may resolve over time, with or without treatment (Galatzer-Levy et al., 2013; Steinert, 
Hofmann, Leichsenring, & Kruse, 2015). A meta-analysis of 42 prospective studies on 
the natural course of PTSD found that, on average, nearly half (44%) of patients with 
PTSD experienced remission after three or more years from their initial assessment (Morina, 
Wicherts, Lobbrecht, & Priebe, 2014). However, the estimated remission rate largely varied

across studies, likely due to heterogeneity in study design, including the time between the 
traumatic event and the first assessment, follow-up length and frequency, PTSD assessment 
(interview-based or self-reported), the definition of remission, types of traumatic events, and 
whether the participants sought for or received treatment (Morina et al., 2014; Steinert et al., 
2015).

While PTSD is linked to many adverse health outcomes, much less is known about 
whether the elevated health risks persist after PTSD symptoms resolve. A few studies have 
investigated health trajectories after PTSD remission, with mixed results across outcomes. 
For example, in previous research, we found that women with remitted PTSD symptoms did 
not show significant differences in the risk of CVD compared to individuals with no trauma 
exposure, while elevated CVD risks were found in those with ongoing PTSD symptoms 
(N=49,859) (Gilsanz et al., 2017). That study also found a positive association between 
PTSD symptom duration and CVD incidence (Gilsanz et al., 2017). Studies in Veterans 
Health Affairs (VHA) patients (N=979–1,598) found that clinically meaningful reductions 
in PTSD symptoms were associated with a lower risk of incident type 2 diabetes (Scherrer 
et al., 2019) and hypertension (Scherrer, Salas, Friedman, et al., 2020). Small prospective 
psychotherapy studies in patients with PTSD (N=37–235) reported improvements in quality 
of life (Schnurr & Lunney, 2016), sleep quality (Rousseau et al., 2021), and blood pressure 
(Schubert et al., 2019) as PTSD symptoms reduced and/or remitted. However, some 
evidence suggests that individuals may still experience adverse health events after PTSD 
remission. For example, a study of 25 patients with PTSD treated with integrative trauma-
focused cognitive behavioral therapy found that hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis 
feedback sensitivity remained unchanged after PTSD symptom improvement (Schubert et 
al., 2019); another study in 1,034 traumatically injured patients found that patients with 
resolved PTSD symptoms had poorer quality of life in various domains compared to those 
who never developed PTSD (Bryant et al., 2016). In addition, VHA studies (N=1,079–
1,330) found that patients with a clinically meaningful reduction in PTSD symptoms within 
12 months of the initial assessment were no different from those with less or no symptom 
reduction with regard to subsequent risks of CVD, ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, 
and weight loss over a 2–7 year follow-up (Scherrer, Salas, Friedman, et al., 2020; Scherrer, 
Salas, Schneider, et al., 2020).

It remains unclear whether and to what extent cognitive deficits ameliorate with the 
remission of PTSD symptoms, with findings inconsistent across studies and cognitive 
measures (Ben-Zion et al., 2018; Clouston et al., 2016; Eren-Koçak, Kılıç, Aydın, & 
Hızlı, 2009; Fani et al., 2009; Haaland, Sadek, Keller, & Castillo, 2016; Nijdam, Martens, 
Reitsma, Gersons, & Olff, 2018; Vermetten, Vythilingam, Southwick, Charney, & Bremner, 
2003; Walter, Palmieri, & Gunstad, 2010). One study of 813 World Trade Center (WTC) 
responders found that current but not remitted PTSD was associated with cognitive 
impairment (Clouston et al., 2016). However, other studies have been limited by small 
samples (N<100) of relatively younger individuals and failure to control adequately 
for potential confounders, such as age and education. In addition, most studies were 
conducted in clinical settings and assessed cognitive change in relation to PTSD symptom 
improvement over the course of treatment, thus providing limited information on how

post-remission cognition compares to that of individuals who never had PTSD after trauma 
exposure.

The present study leverages the NHS II, a large prospective cohort of U.S. women, 
to examine how prior endorsement of PTSD symptoms, remitted or unresolved, are 
associated with cognitive function and changes over time measured six years after the PTSD 
assessment. We hypothesized that (a) unresolved PTSD symptoms would be associated with 
poorer cognitive function and worse changes in cognitive function over a 2-year follow-up 
compared to those who never had PTSD after trauma exposure, and (b) women whose PTSD 
symptoms remitted would have similar cognitive function and cognitive changes as women 
who did not have PTSD after trauma exposure.

Methods

Study participants

Data came from 116,429 U.S. female nurses enrolled in the NHS II in 1989, with biennial 
follow-up ongoing. Women responded to biennial questionnaires about lifestyle and health. 
In 2008, 60,804 women who returned a 2007 biennial questionnaire were invited to 
complete a supplemental questionnaire on trauma exposure and PTSD history; of these, 
54,224 (89%) responded. In 2014, 43,957 of these responders with known email addresses 
were invited to an initial (henceforth “baseline”) cognitive assessment. A total of 15,138 
women completed this assessment, with 14,994 passing data quality checks as previously 
described (Roberts et al., 2022). We excluded 2,724 women who reported no trauma 
exposure, a requirement for PTSD and subsequent remission, leaving 12,270 participants.

Following the baseline cognitive assessment, women were asked to complete additional 
cognitive assessments every six or 12 months for up to 24 months. Those who did not 
complete a cognitive assessment at one time point were not invited to the next session. 
Thus, women completed up to five assessments; over a median follow-up of 1.0 year, 7,937 
(64.7%) completed at least two assessments, with 625 (5.1%) completing all five. The 
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
Completion of assessments implied consent.

Trauma and PTSD assessment

In 2008, women reported lifetime exposure to 15 traumatic events and any other traumatic 
event not listed from a modified version of the Brief Trauma Questionnaire (Morgan et al., 
2001; Schnurr, Vielhauer, Weathers, & Findler, 1999). Trauma-exposed women were asked 
to indicate their worst event. Lifetime (ever) and past-month experience of seven PTSD 
symptoms with reference to their worst trauma was assessed using the Short Screening 
Scale for DSM-IV PTSD (Breslau, Peterson, Kessler, & Schultz, 1999). PTSD symptom 
severity (lifetime and past-month) was defined as the number of symptoms reported. See 
Supplementary Materials for more details.

We defined remission as reporting lifetime but no past-month PTSD symptoms; women 
who reported past-month symptoms were identified as having unresolved symptoms at the 
time of the assessment. Trauma-exposed women were classified into three groups indicating

PTSD status as of 2008: (a) no PTSD: trauma exposed but no PTSD symptoms at any 
point in their lifetime, (b) remitted PTSD: any lifetime symptoms, but no past-month PTSD 
symptoms, and (3) unresolved PTSD: any past-month PTSD symptoms. In addition, we 
utilized a cutoff score of four on the PTSD screener to create more granular categories that 
incorporate symptom severity. In a validation study of this screener, a score of ≥4 identified 
PTSD cases with sensitivity=85% and specificity=93% (Breslau et al., 1999). Based on this 
cutoff, we further classified trauma-exposed women into five groups: (a) trauma/no PTSD 
symptoms, (b) remitted mild (1–3) PTSD symptoms, (c) remitted moderate-severe (4–7) 
PTSD symptoms, (d) unresolved mild (1–3) PTSD symptoms, (e) unresolved moderate-
severe (4–7) PTSD symptoms.

Cognitive assessment

Covariates

The Cogstate Brief Battery was used to assess cognitive function beginning in 2014. 
Cogstate is a self-administered online tool comprised of four tasks measuring psychomotor 
speed, attention, visual learning, and working memory (Fredrickson et al., 2010; Koyama et 
al., 2015). This computerized instrument has good construct and criterion validity (Hammers 
et al., 2012; Maruff et al., 2009), test-retest reliability (Fredrickson et al., 2010; Lim, 
Jaeger, et al., 2013; Maruff et al., 2013), acceptability and efficiency in large community-
based studies of older individuals (Fredrickson et al., 2010; Koyama et al., 2015), and 
clinical utility in identifying cognitive impairments and dementia (Hammers et al., 2012; 
Lim et al., 2012; Maruff et al., 2013, 2009). Standardized z scores were calculated at all 
assessments using means and standard deviations at baseline for each task. Two composite 
scores were generated and analyzed as primary outcomes: psychomotor speed/attention 
composite and learning/working memory composite. For both composites, higher scores 
reflect better cognitive function. These two composites have been previously validated in our 
sample using confirmatory factor analysis (Sumner et al., 2017) and have been found to be 
sensitive measures of cognitive decline (Lim, Pietrzak, et al., 2013; Maruff et al., 2013). See 
Supplementary Materials for more details.

Analyses were adjusted for potential confounding factors for the association between PTSD 
status and cognition, including sociodemographic factors, biobehavioral factors, and health 
conditions. These included age at Cogstate baseline, self-identified race/ethnic identity 
(Non-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, other), parental education at participant’s 
birth (high school or less, some college, 4+ years of college), and participant’s highest 
education (associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, doctorate). Biobehavioral factors included 
body mass index (BMI, kg/m2, calculated from self-reported height and weight (Rimm 
et al., 1990)), cigarette smoking (nonsmoker, former smoker, current smoker of 1–14, 
15–24, or 25+ cigarettes/day), alcohol consumption (0, 1−<5, 5−<10, 10−20, 20+ grams/
day), diet quality measured using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (excluding alcohol 
consumption) (Chiuve et al., 2012), ascertained in 2007, and physical activity (<3, 3−<9, 
9−<18, 18−<27, 27+ metabolic equivalent hours/week), ascertained in 2005. Lifetime 
history of physician-diagnosed hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and myocardial 
infarction was ascertained based on women’s reports on biennial questionnaires from 1989–
2007. While the assessment of biobehavioral factors and health conditions predated the

PTSD assessment in 2008, some of these factors may be on the pathway between PTSD 
remission and cognition, as the exact timing of PTSD remission is not known. For example, 
good diet quality may positively impact the remission of PTSD symptoms, or it may be the 
result of PTSD remission. It was not possible to determine the sequence of PTSD remission 
and these health factors; thus, we cannot conclusively distinguish if they are serving as 
confounders or as mediators between the PTSD status in 2008 and cognition assessed six 
years later.

Past-week depressive symptoms and history of physician-diagnosed depression were 
analyzed in a secondary analysis, as they could be a cause or consequence of unresolved 
PTSD. Past-week depressive symptoms were assessed in 2008 using the 10-item Center 
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D-10) scale. The CES-D-10 has excellent 
psychometrics and performs similarly to the 20-item CES-D (Andresen, Malmgren, Carter, 
& Patrick, 1994). History of physician-diagnosed depression was ascertained from biennial 
questionnaires in 2003–2007.

Less than 5.0% of all covariates were missing, except for participant’s education (24.4%), 
which was assessed by a supplemental 2018 questionnaire in a subset of participants. We 
addressed missing values in all covariates using multiple imputation (MI) with a fully 
conditional specification method (Brand, 1999; van Buuren, 2007), generating 10 imputed 
datasets. See Supplementary Materials for more details.

Statistical analysis

For descriptive analyses, we summarized sociodemographic and health characteristics across 
PTSD groups using means and standard deviations and frequencies where appropriate. To 
comprehensively examine the relationship between PTSD status, symptom severity, and 
cognition, we modeled PTSD in three different ways in the association analysis. Firstly, we 
used the 3-level categorical variable to compare remitted and unresolved PTSD with those 
who had no PTSD ever (reference group). Secondly, we used a continuous score of lifetime 
and past-month PTSD symptoms to assess the linear relationship between symptom severity 
and cognition among women with remitted and unresolved PTSD symptoms, respectively. 
Thirdly, we utilized a 5-level categorical variable that combined both PTSD status and 
symptom severity, with trauma/no PTSD symptoms as the reference group.

To estimate the association between PTSD in 2008 and baseline cognition in 2014 
(henceforth “cross-sectional analysis,” with prospective measures of outcome), we used 
multivariate linear regression (PROC GLM in SAS v9.4). The beta coefficients for PTSD 
were reported, representing the estimated differences in baseline cognition compared to the 
reference group or per one unit increase in symptom severity. We also estimated cognitive 
differences associated with one year of aging by fitting linear regressions on cognitive 
composites with age as the predictor, adjusted for race/ethnicity (Roberts, Sumner, et al., 
2020; Sumner et al., 2017). To estimate the association between PTSD in 2008 and the 
rate of cognitive change during follow-up (henceforth “longitudinal analysis”), we used 
linear mixed-effects models (PROC MIXED in SAS v9.4), including time since baseline in 
years, PTSD, the interaction between time and PTSD, and covariates. Dependence between 
repeated measurements within study participants was accounted for via the inclusion of

random intercepts and random slopes for time. The beta coefficients for the time-PTSD 
interaction terms were reported, representing the estimated differences in the rate of 
cognitive change compared to the reference group or per one unit increase in symptom 
severity. These models were fit to each of the 10 imputed datasets, with results combined 
using Rubin’s rule (Rubin, 1987). Estimated associations with a p value less than 0.05 were 
considered statistically significant.

In both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we started with a crude model with no 
covariates. Next, we included covariates in increasingly adjusted models. In the first adjusted 
model, we accounted for possible sociodemographic confounders (e.g., parental education). 
In the second adjusted model, we examined the impact of biobehavioral factors (e.g., BMI, 
smoking) on a possible association of PTSD status with cognition. Finally, to assess the 
impact of co-morbidities on the association, the third model was additionally adjusted for 
health conditions (e.g., diabetes, stroke).

We conducted several secondary analyses. First, since PTSD and depression are highly co-
morbid (Rytwinski, Scur, Feeny, & Youngstrom, 2013), we further adjusted for depressive 
symptoms in 2008 and history of depression during 2003–2007 to examine if a PTSD-
cognition association was accounted for by depression. Next, to evaluate the potential impact 
of practice effects in the cognitive tasks in the longitudinal analysis, we further adjusted for 
prior practice (Vivot et al., 2016). Moreover, to evaluate whether results were affected by 
the imputation of missing values, particularly participant’s education, we explored several 
alternative imputation methods (e.g., single imputation, hot-deck imputation) and compared 
results. Finally, to examine potential bias due to selection into the Cogstate sample and 
loss to follow-up, we conducted inverse probability weighted (IPW) analyses. The 5-level 
categorical PTSD variable that incorporated both PTSD status and symptom severity was 
assessed in secondary analyses. See Supplementary Materials for more details.

Results

Participant characteristics and PTSD status

A total of 12,270 trauma-exposed women were included in this study. Most were non-
Hispanic White (95.9%), with age at baseline cognitive assessment ranging from 50 to 71 
years (mean=61). The prevalence of any PTSD symptoms was 67.3% (N=8,253); 2,997 
(24.4%) and 784 (6.4%) women had unresolved mild and moderate-severe symptoms at 
the time of PTSD assessment in 2008, respectively; 3,347 (27.3%) and 1,125 (9.2%) 
women reported remitted mild and moderate-severe symptoms, respectively. Participant 
characteristics by PTSD status are shown in Table 1. Compared to women whose PTSD 
symptoms had remitted as of 2008, those with unresolved PTSD symptoms had lower levels 
of parental education, had higher BMI, were more likely to be current smokers, and had 
higher levels of depressive symptoms. The distribution of trauma types and lifetime PTSD 
symptoms by PTSD status is shown in Table S1.

Cross-sectional analysis

Page 8

Compared to trauma/no PTSD symptoms, unresolved PTSD symptoms at the time of 2008 
assessment were associated with significantly lower scores in both cognitive composites 
assessed six years later. Specifically, in analyses without adjustment, women with any 
unresolved PTSD symptoms showed mean differences of −0.10 standard deviation (SD) 
(95% CI: −0.14, −0.06) in psychomotor speed/attention and −0.10 SD (95% CI: −0.13, 
−0.06) in learning/working memory, compared to women with no PTSD symptoms ever 
(Table S2). Among women with unresolved symptoms, one unit increase in past-month 
PTSD symptom severity was associated with −0.02 (95% CI: −0.04, 0.001) and −0.04 
SD (95% CI: −0.05, −0.02) mean differences in psychomotor speed/attention and learning/
working memory, respectively (Table 2). Using a cutoff of four, we found mean differences 
between women with unresolved mild (1–3) PTSD symptoms and women with trauma/no 
PTSD symptoms of −0.09 SD (95% CI: −0.13, −0.05) in psychomotor speed/attention and 
−0.07 SD (95% CI: −0.11, −0.04) in learning/working memory; while for women with 
unresolved moderate-severe (4–7) PTSD symptoms, these mean differences were −0.14 SD 
(95% CI: −0.21, −0.07) in psychomotor speed/attention and −0.18 SD (95% CI: −0.23, 
−0.12) in learning/working memory (Table 3, Figure S1). To help interpret these differences, 
we found that each additional year of age was associated with a −0.04 SD decrease in 
psychomotor speed/attention and a −0.03 SD decrease in learning/working memory; thus, 
unresolved mild and moderate-severe PTSD symptoms were associated with the equivalent 
of approximately 2 and 5 years of cognitive aging, respectively.

We observed no significant difference in baseline cognition between women with remitted 
PTSD symptoms as of 2008 compared to the women with no PTSD symptoms ever (Table 
S2, Table 3). Among women with remitted PTSD symptoms, increase in lifetime PTSD 
symptom severity was not associated with baseline cognition (Table 2). Above results on 
unresolved and remitted PTSD were unchanged after adjusting for sociodemographic and 
biobehavioral factors (Table 2, Table 3, Table S2) and health conditions (data not shown).

Longitudinal analysis

Compared to women with no PTSD symptoms, worse rates of changes in learning/working 
memory were observed in both women with unresolved PTSD (mean difference=-0.03 
SD/year, 95% CI: −0.06, −0.01) and remitted PTSD (mean difference=-0.02 SD/year, 
95% CI: −0.05, 0.0005) (Table S3). Specifically, unresolved mild (1–3) symptoms at the 
time of PTSD assessment had a marginally significant association with worse rates of 
changes in learning/working memory (mean difference=-0.03 SD/year, 95% CI: −0.05, 
0.0004) that further reached statistical significance when adjusted for sociodemographic 
and biobehavioral factors (Table 4). In addition, unresolved moderate-severe (4–7) PTSD 
symptoms were significantly associated with worse rates of changes in learning/working 
memory (mean difference=-0.05 SD/year, 95% CI: −0.09, −0.01), and the results remained 
unchanged with the adjustment of covariates (Table 4, Figure S1). Among women with 
unresolved PTSD symptoms, increase in past-month symptom severity was not linearly 
associated with the rate of change in learning/working memory (Table S4).

By contrast, we observed a significant linear association between increase in lifetime 
symptom severity and changes in learning/working memory among women with remitted 
PTSD symptoms (Table S4). Specifically, one unit increase in lifetime symptom severity 
was associated with a mean difference of −0.01 SD/year (95% CI: −0.02, −0.004) in the rate 
of change in learning/working memory. Using a cutoff of four, we observed significantly 
worse cognitive changes in learning/working memory for women with remitted moderate-
severe (4–7) PTSD symptoms (-0.06 SD/year, 95% CI: −0.10, −0.03) compared to women 
with no PTSD symptoms, but not with remitted mild (1–3) PTSD symptoms (-0.01 SD/year, 
95% CI: −0.03, 0.02) (Table 4, Figure S1). No significant association was observed between 
PTSD status or symptom severity and psychomotor speed/attention (Table 4, Table S3, 
Table S4). Results were unchanged after controlling for sociodemographic and biobehavioral 
factors (Table 4, Table S3, Table S4) and health conditions (data not shown).

Secondary analyses

Adjustment for depression—In the cross-sectional analysis, the estimated decrease 
in cognitive composite scores for women with unresolved PTSD symptoms, compared 
to those with no PTSD, remained statistically significant after adjusting for depression, 
but estimates were attenuated by 25.0% to 53.8%, depending on the model (Table S5). 
In the longitudinal analysis, including the main effects of depression did not change the 
results (Table S6). However, when further adjusted for time*depression interactions, the 
associations of unresolved PTSD symptoms with changes in learning/working memory 
attenuated by 22.5% to 29.5% and were no longer statistically significant. The association of 
remitted moderate-severe PTSD symptoms with the rate of change in cognition was similar 
to that in the unadjusted analyses (Table S6).

Adjustment for practice effects—Longitudinal results were consistent after adjusting 
for practice effects and were robust to the different parameterization of practice effects, 
including the categorical and the continuous number of prior tests, the square root of the 
number of prior tests, and the indicator for baseline versus post-baseline assessments (Table 
S7). Cognitive composite scores decreased over time in all PTSD groups after adjusting for 
the number of prior tests (categorical) (Figure 1); the estimated rate of decline in learning/
working memory was 0.07 SD/year among women with trauma/no PTSD, and nearly twice 
as fast among women with remitted or unresolved moderate-severe PTSD symptoms (0.13 
SD/year and 0.12 SD/year respectively).

Alternative imputation of participant education—Results were consistent across 
different imputation methods, including group-specific mode, hot-deck imputation, missing 
indicator, and single imputation (Table S8, Table S9). As single imputation results were 
similar to MI, we conducted the following IPW analyses in one of the imputed datasets.

Selection into Cogstate and IPW—Women in this study were similar to those in the 
original PTSD cohort (N=44,573) from which the cognitive samples were drawn in many 
characteristics, although the former had slightly better health behaviors and fewer diseases 
(Table S10). Accounting for the probability of selection from the original PTSD cohort 
into the Cogstate sample using IPW, overall results remained the same except for a mild

attenuation in the association between unresolved mild PTSD symptoms and the rate of 
change in learning/working memory in the longitudinal analysis (-0.02 SD/year, 95% CI: 
−0.05, 0.00, Table S11).

Loss to follow-up during Cogstate assessments and IPW—During the 
longitudinal assessment period, women who continued to the next assessment had higher 
cognition on average than those who did not respond to the next assessment, particularly 
between the first and the second assessments and in learning/working memory (Figure 
S2). PTSD status was not associated with the probability of dropout (Figure S3). Sample 
characteristics were similar across women who completed different numbers of cognitive 
assessments (Table S12). After accounting for loss to follow-up using IPW, the difference 
in the change of learning/working memory composite compared to women with trauma/no 
PTSD remained significant for women with remitted or unresolved moderate-severe PTSD 
symptoms; however, it was attenuated and no longer significant for women with unresolved 
mild PTSD symptoms (p=0.14, Table S13).

Discussion

In this cohort study, unresolved PTSD symptoms as of 2008 were associated with 
significantly poorer cognitive function at baseline in 2014 in psychomotor speed/attention 
and learning/working memory and faster cognitive decline during follow-up in learning/
working memory, compared to the reference group of women with trauma/no PTSD. In 
women whose PTSD remitted by 2008, while we found no significant difference in baseline 
cognition compared to women with trauma/no PTSD, increase in lifetime PTSD symptom 
severity was significantly associated with a faster decline in learning/working memory. The 
observed associations were independent of sociodemographic, biobehavioral, and health 
factors, and were robust to adjustment for practice effects, imputation of missing values, 
sample selection, and loss to follow-up. Co-morbid depression partially accounted for the 
associations between PTSD and cognition, potentially due to the overlapping symptoms 
between the two conditions. Our findings add to the literature on the cognitive sequelae of 
PTSD and provide a more granular evaluation of the dynamic association between PTSD 
and cognition.

Similar to findings from previous research in mixed-gender samples (Clouston et al., 
2016; Eren-Koçak et al., 2009), our cross-sectional analysis found that cognitive function 
did not differ in women with remitted PTSD compared to those who never had PTSD. 
These findings may be interpreted in two ways. First, PTSD is associated with adverse 
cognitive outcomes that can become alleviated as PTSD symptoms improve. The DSM-5 
criteria for PTSD include cognitive symptoms such as attention and memory problems 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013), and previous research has shown that these 
cognitive symptoms improve as individuals recover from PTSD (Ben-Zion et al., 2018; 
Nijdam et al., 2018). In addition, PTSD remission may be accompanied by behavioral and 
biological changes that contribute to improved cognition, such as improved quality of life 
(Schnurr & Lunney, 2016), sleep quality (Rousseau et al., 2021), blood pressure (Schubert 
et al. 2019), and hormone levels (Olff, de Vries, Güzelcan, Assies, & Gersons, 2007), as 
well as reduced DNA strand breakage (Morath et al. 2014). Some neuroimaging studies

of PTSD also found changes in functional activation and neurocircuitry mechanisms in 
response to psychotherapies (Cisler, Sigel, Kramer, et al., 2016; Cisler, Sigel, Steele, et al., 
2016; Helpman et al., 2016; Simmons, Norman, Spadoni, & Strigo, 2013), and specific 
changes in brain structural network among individuals with remitted PTSD that had been 
linked to improved cognitive processing (Sun et al., 2018).

Second, we cannot rule out the possibility that lower cognition preceded and predicted 
PTSD remission. Pre-trauma or pre-PTSD cognitive ability has been shown to be associated 
with PTSD onset and severity (Aupperle, Melrose, Stein, & Paulus, 2012; Scott et al., 2015), 
as well as PTSD trajectories (Samuelson et al., 2020) and treatment outcomes (Haaland et 
al., 2016; Nijdam, de Vries, Gersons, & Olff, 2015; van Rooij, Kennis, Vink, & Geuze, 
2016). However, in this study, cognitive function was only measured after PTSD assessment; 
thus, we could not determine whether cognitive function predicted PTSD remission. Future 
research with pre- and post-PTSD assessments of cognition will be necessary for a 
comprehensive characterization of the cognitive trajectory over the course of PTSD.

While women with remitted PTSD showed no difference in cognitive function assessed six 
years later from the reference group of women who never had PTSD, our longitudinal 
analysis indicated that women who had previously experienced high levels of PTSD 
symptoms were still prone to a more rapid decline in learning/working memory after 
symptom remission, at a rate comparable to that observed in women with unresolved 
symptoms of similar levels. These findings indicate that there may be lingering cognitive 
effects even after the remission of PTSD symptoms and suggest the potential need for 
continued support among women who have experienced high levels of PTSD symptoms 
in the past. PTSD is associated with dysregulated physiological and behavioral responses, 
including sleep problems (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2021), substance abuse 
(Brady, Back, & Coffey, 2004), and many other chronic illnesses. These adverse health 
outcomes are more severe among individuals with higher levels of PTSD or persistent 
PTSD (D’Andrea, Sharma, Zelechoski, & Spinazzola, 2011); thus, such individuals may 
experience more potent, longer-lasting effects. Indeed, one study found that remitted PTSD 
patients still experienced poorer physical, psychological, and social functioning than those 
who never developed PTSD (Bryant et al., 2016). Furthermore, there is also evidence 
from previous research suggesting that PTSD may leave biological traces that can persist 
following symptom remission. For example, a neuroimaging study in U.S. military veterans 
showed that not all brain network architecture changes associated with PTSD returned to 
the level of trauma-exposed controls after PTSD remission (Sun et al., 2018); another study 
found that HPA axis feedback sensitivity remained unchanged after PTSD symptoms abated 
(Schubert et al., 2019). Together with previous evidence, our findings imply that the adverse 
health consequences of PTSD may not fully resolve following PTSD remission, which may 
leave individuals with a greater likelihood of an impaired aging process. However, no other 
longitudinal studies have examined cognitive decline during aging in relation to remitted and 
unresolved PTSD. Therefore, additional studies are warranted to replicate our findings.

This study builds upon previous research indicating that lifetime PTSD is associated with 
poorer cognition and faster cognitive decline by providing a more detailed characterization 
of this relationship regarding the remission of PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, in this study,

PTSD was associated with greater impairment in learning/working memory compared to 
psychomotor speed/attention and accelerated decline in learning/working memory only. As 
age, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) also associate with greater 
impairments in learning/working memory compared to psychomotor speed/attention (Lim 
et al., 2012; Maruff et al., 2013), it is possible that cognitive domains that represent earlier 
or more severe deficits in the aging process are particularly susceptible to the effects of 
PTSD. Further research is needed to understand the biological basis of these PTSD-related 
cognitive differences and how they may predict the risk of AD.

Our study has several limitations. First, our definitions of remitted and unresolved PTSD 
were limited by the data available. PTSD can take various courses across individuals, 
including stable remitting, fluctuating, or chronic (Galatzer-Levy et al., 2013; Marmar et 
al., 2015; Steinert et al., 2015). However, information about PTSD symptom onset and 
fluctuations over time was unavailable. Thus, PTSD status measured at a single time point 
in 2008 may not accurately reflect the duration or chronicity of PTSD symptoms or PTSD 
status at the time of cognitive assessment. In addition, not all the symptoms that make 
up the diagnostic criteria of PTSD were assessed, and limited information on treatment-
seeking made it challenging to distinguish between natural remission versus remission from 
treatment. Future research that integrates more frequent and comprehensive assessment of 
PTSD symptoms will allow for a thorough investigation of the dynamic changes in symptom 
severity over time. Second, this sample consisted of individuals in the early years of aging, 
and the follow-up was relatively short, which may have limited our ability to detect modest 
associations between remitted PTSD and cognition. Thus, further research with longer 
follow-ups to older ages will be needed. Third, the presence of emotional symptoms, such 
as loss of interest and feeling jumpy, among women with unresolved symptoms at the time 
of the PTSD assessment could be a sign of early developing underlying neurodegenerative 
diseases; however, we could not directly assess this possibility due to the lack of data on 
neurodegenerative disease status. Fourth, observational studies are subject to confounding 
and selection bias. While our analysis was robust to a series of covariate adjustment and 
secondary analyses, unmeasured confounders or competing risks may partially account for 
the observed results. Fifth, while the traumatic experiences included in this study (such as 
sexual harassment and the death of a close family member or friend) are not specific to 
nurses, the NHS II cohort is predominantly white professionals; further research is needed to 
determine whether the findings generalize to more diverse populations.

Our study has many strengths. First, by leveraging data from a large, prospective cohort, we 
were able to analyze the largest sample to date, to the best of our knowledge, assessing the 
relationship of PTSD symptom remission with cognition. Second, we conducted both cross-
sectional and longitudinal analysis, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the dynamic 
changes in cognition in relation to PTSD status. Third, the study was comprised of women. 
While women have a higher risk of PTSD than men (Christiansen & Berke, 2020), recover 
slower from PTSD (Breslau, 2009), and experience higher rates of dementia (Snyder et al., 
2016), they have been underrepresented in PTSD-cognition research.

To summarize, we found that unresolved but not remitted PTSD was associated with 
worse cognitive function assessed six years later and that accelerated cognitive decline

was observed during follow-up among women with either unresolved or remitted high 
levels of PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest the value of integrating cognitive 
assessments and interventions into routine mental health care for PTSD patients and 
providing resources and support for managing cognitive decline in this population. The 
observed accelerated cognitive decline may imply poorer cognitive aging and highlights 
the importance of screening and prevention of dementia not only for women experiencing 
persistent PTSD symptoms but also for those who have previously experienced high 
levels of PTSD symptoms. Co-occurring depression partially explained the link between 
unresolved PTSD symptoms and cognition, emphasizing the importance of monitoring 
and managing depression in PTSD treatment. Future research is needed to illuminate the 
pathways underlying the association of PTSD with worse cognitive trajectories and to 
determine whether effective PTSD treatment can prevent cognitive decline and other long-
term adverse health outcomes associated with PTSD.

Fitted linear cognitive trajectories by PTSD status (5 levels) in 2008. Plots were based 
on results from models adjusted for age at baseline cognitive assessment, race/ethnicity, 
parental education, participant education, and categorical indicator of the number of prior 
cognitive tests. Fitted linear trajectories were calculated for White women ages 61 at 
baseline, with the highest education of Bachelor’s degree and parental education of high 
school. sx = symptoms.
