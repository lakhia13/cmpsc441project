Meta-analysis

Purpose: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a signiﬁcant global mental health concern, especially in
the military. This study aims to estimate the efﬁcacy of mindfulness meditation in the treatment of
military-related PTSD, by synthesizing evidences from randomized controlled trials.
Methods: Five electronic databases (Pubmed, EBSCO Medline, Embase, PsychINFO and Cochrane Library)
were searched for randomized controlled trials focusing on the treatment effect of mindfulness medi-
tation on military-related PTSD. The selection of eligible studies was based on identical inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Information about study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention de-
tails, PTSD outcomes, as well as potential adverse effects was extracted from the included studies. Risk of
bias of all the included studies was critically assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. R Statis-
tical software was performed for data analysis.
Results: A total of 1902 records were initially identiﬁed and screened. After duplicates removal and title
& abstract review, ﬁnally, 19 articles in English language with 1326 participants were included through
strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results revealed that mindfulness meditation had a signiﬁ-
cantly larger effect on alleviating military-related PTSD symptoms compared with control conditions,
such as treatment as usual, present-centered group therapy and PTSD health education (standardized
mean difference (SMD) ¼ (cid:2)0.33; 95% CI [(cid:2)0.45, (cid:2)0.21]; p < 0.0001). Mindfulness interventions with
different control conditions (active or non-active control, SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.33, 95% CI [(cid:2)0.46, (cid:2)0.19];
SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.49, 95% CI [(cid:2)0.88, (cid:2)0.10], respectively), formats of delivery (group-based or individual-based,
SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.30, 95% CI [(cid:2)0.42, (cid:2)0.17], SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.49, 95% CI [(cid:2)0.90, (cid:2)0.08], respectively) and intervention
durations (short-term or standard duration, SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.27, 95% CI [(cid:2)0.46, (cid:2)0.08], SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.40, 95% CI
[(cid:2)0.58, (cid:2)0.21], respectively) were equally effective in improving military-related PTSD symptoms.
Conclusion: Findings from this meta-analysis consolidate the efﬁcacy and feasibility of mindfulness
meditation in the treatment of military-related PTSD. Further evidence with higher quality and more
rigorous design is needed in the future.

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, chronic and
debilitating mental and behavioral disorder following one or more
traumatic events, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of
approximately 6.8% in general US population.1 The World Mental
Health Survey Consortium revealed that over 70% of general pop-
ulation experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime
around the world.2 It is well-known that both active military
personnel and veterans tend to experience various life-threatening
traumatic events and be under highly intense stress. As a result,
they are at a particularly high risk of developing PTSD, which could
be regarded as military-related PTSD.3 The prevalence of military-
related PTSD after deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan was re-
ported to be 13.2% in operational infantry units.4 The estimated
results from the National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study
showed that approximately 11% veterans continued to suffer from
PTSD symptoms 40 years after the Vietnam War.5 Moreover, a re-
view on the prevalence of PTSD in Operation Enduring Freedom/
Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans revealed that the PTSD preva-
lence was as high as 23%.6

As the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th
edition noted, PTSD is characterized by intrusive experience,
persistent avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood,
as well as marked alterations in arousal and reactivity related to the
traumatic events.7 In addition, it is universally acknowledged that
military-related PTSD is a complicated and heterogeneous health
concern accompanied by varying degrees of mental and physical
health issues, such as chronic pain, fatigue and depression,8e10
which bring about a heavy burden on individuals, families and
the army. It was revealed that the most common mental disorders
reported by military personnel deployed to combat zones were
PTSD and alcohol misuse.11 While alcohol misuse has been found to
have a considerably higher prevalence than that reported among
general population and might protract the course of PTSD.12
Furthermore, it is noted that the service members with mental
disorders, especially PTSD, may experience a strong sense of
stigma, speciﬁcally concerns about how their fellows and military
leadership will judge them, which keeps them from seeking pro-
fessional medical help.13 Given that military-related PTSD has a
detrimental impact on the combat effectiveness of the army,11 valid
measures should be employed to address this issue.

Currently, multifarious psychological and pharmacological in-
terventions have been applied for PTSD. The effect of psychother-
apies has been extensively evaluated, which can be broadly
grouped into “trauma-focused” and “non-trauma-focused”. The
most recent recommendations in the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs (VA)/Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline
for the Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder list individual
trauma-focused psychotherapies as the ﬁrst-line treatment.14 Ac-
cording to the guideline, prolonged exposure,15,16 cognitive pro-
cessing therapy,17 and eye movement desensitization and
reprocessing18 possess the strongest evidence derived from clinical
trials. With regard to non-trauma-focused psychotherapies, the
evidence-based treatment options include stress inoculation
training, present-centered therapy, and interpersonal psychother-
apy.19,20 The pharmacotherapies are also widely used in PTSD
treatment.21 Three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Sertra-
line, Paroxetine and Fluoxetine) and one serotonin norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor (Venlafaxine) are recommended as mono-
therapy for the management of PTSD with relatively sufﬁcient
evidence.22e24 Despite empirical support for the above therapies,
both psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies are restricted to
some limitations. Studies on trauma-focused psychotherapies for
PTSD have reported high rates of dropout and nonresponse, and

Chinese Journal of Traumatology 24 (2021) 221e230

many patients may suffer from residual symptoms after treat-
ment.3,25 The average rate of dropout from psychotherapies for
military-related PTSD among combat veterans was estimated to be
36%.26 Results from a meta-analysis showed that nearly 27% of
patients reduced the dose or withdrew from medication without
following prescription because they were concerned about unre-
markable curative effect or potential adverse effects, such as sexual
dysfunction, increased sweating, and sleep disorders.27 Therefore,
more effective and better tolerated PTSD treatment options are
desired.

There is growing evidence showing that complementary and
alternative medicine (CAM), especially mind-body therapies, is
expected to be effective and viable interventions for PTSD man-
agement under the military context.28e30 Reviews on CAM for PTSD
also provided support for the treatment effect of these in-
terventions on PTSD symptoms.31,32 Notably, it was put forward
that an acute increase in distress during the treatment period could
contribute to the high rate of dropout and nonresponse among
patients receiving trauma-focused psychotherapies,33 and CAM
might be effective in addressing this problem by regulating phys-
iological and psychological arousal.34

Of various CAM practices, meditation has been extensively
researched and reported to be the most widely accepted. Medita-
tion is a mind-body technique referring to a wide range of
emotional and attentional regulatory strategies that contributes to
happiness cultivation and emotion management.35 There are
diverse forms of meditation practices, such as mindfulness medi-
tation, mantra meditation, etc. Rooted in Eastern Buddhist, mind-
fulness has sprung up in Western as a popularizing healthy lifestyle
in recent years. Kabat-Zinn36 described mindfulness as an inten-
tionally focused attention on the moment-to-moment experience
in a state of non-judgmental awareness. Generally, mindfulness
refers to a state of consciousness sustaining one's attention on the
experience occurring in the present moment, and is often reached
by various meditation practices.37 Mindfulness meditation involves
a variety of meditation techniques with a focus on mindfulness.
One of the most popular and well-researched mindfulness medi-
tation programs is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), an
8-week group course that
to non-
judgmentally experience the present moment,38 which has been
well-documented to improve stress-related symptoms, such as
depression, anxiety and PTSD.39,40 Moreover, mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy,41 an integration of MBSR and cognitive-
behavior therapy, has also been applied to PTSD treatment.42
Regarding military-related PTSD, it has been proposed that the
high levels of guilt and shame among veterans can prevent them
from seeking medical care and result in early withdrawal from
treatment.43 Accordingly, taking mindfulness meditation as the
treatment of military-related PTSD may improve the acceptance
and tolerance in military PTSD patients and reduce possible nega-
tive mood, including guilt and shame.

teaches practitioners

Meta-analyses of the impact of meditation practice on PTSD
have shown signiﬁcant evidence of encouraging treatment
effects.44e46 For example, 18 studies were included in Hopwood
study,44 where mindfulness meditation was
and Schutte's
demonstrated to be effective in relieving PTSD symptoms
compared with control conditions, with a Hedges'g of (cid:2)0.44.
However, to our knowledge, systematic reviews or meta-analyses
speciﬁcally aiming at meditation training for PTSD among veter-
ans and active military personnel are limited in number. Therefore,
an emphasis was put on mindfulness meditation for the treatment
of military-related PTSD in this study, with a speciﬁc focus on
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to estimate the treatment ef-
fect of this kind of intervention on military-related PTSD symp-
toms. Besides, it was found that mindfulness meditation training

was brought to the military by Johnson et al. in 201147,48 and
received increasingly attention during the past decade. As a result,
relative studies published within the past decade were examined in
this study.

The primary purpose of this meta-analysis was to test the hy-
pothesis that mindfulness meditation would have advantages over
control conditions in alleviating the severity of military-related
PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, additional factors inﬂuencing the
treatment effect were investigated, including control condition
(active or non-active control), format of interventions delivered
(group-based or individual-based) and intervention duration
(short-term or standard duration).

author extracted and coded all the studies; then, the second author
checked the extracted information. Disagreements were resolved
by discussion between the two sides or arbitration from a third
author, and consensus was reached for all the included studies.

The following information was extracted from each eligible
study: study characteristics (author, publication year, study design,
control condition), participant characteristics (sample size, gender,
age),

Methods

Quality assessment

This review was carried on in accordance with the guidelines in
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analyses statement.49 And the protocol of the review was regis-
tered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Re-
views (registration number CRD42020188543).

Search strategy

Studies were identiﬁed through a comprehensive computerized
search of PubMed, EBSCO Medline, Embase, PsychINFO and
Cochrane Library between January 2010 and December 2019. Three
major ways of searching were used, including the medical subject
headings (MeSH) search, text word search and Boolean calculation
search. For example, the searching keywords in the Pubmed were:
[(PTSD OR posttraumatic stress disorder OR post-traumatic stress
disorder OR posttraumatic stress) OR (“Stress Disorders, Post-
Traumatic”) [MeSH]] AND (meditation OR mindful OR mindfulness
OR yoga). Also, additional studies were acquired by searching the
reference lists of relevant articles, especially reviews or meta-
analysis on meditation and PTSD.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were studies: (1)
speciﬁcally focusing on active military personnel or veterans with
military-related PTSD, (2) employing meditation-based therapies
as main interventions, (3) RCTs with any comparator as a control,
(4) use of a clinician or self-report PTSD measure, (5) sufﬁcient
reporting of statistics of PTSD symptom severity (mean and SD) to
calculate an effect size for meta-analysis, and (6) available in En-
glish language literature.

Articles were excluded on any of the following grounds: (1)
article type of commentaries, editorials, letters, reviews or case
reports, (2) meditation not as a primary intervention component,
(3) no random assignment, (4) no use of PTSD measure, (5) not
military-related PTSD, (6) unavailable of full-text articles, and (7)
no sufﬁcient statistical results even if emails were send to the
corresponding authors.

Data extraction and coding

After the duplicated records were removed by EndNote, two
authors
independently screened the remaining records by
reviewing the titles and abstracts, in order to minimize errors and
potential bias. Then, full-text articles were retrieved and assessed
for eligibility with identical
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Furthermore, the two authors performed data extraction consec-
utively based on a pre-designed data collection form. The ﬁrst

The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of
bias for all the included studies.50 We assessed each study on the
following domains:
random sequence generation, allocation
concealment (selection bias), blinding of outcome assessment
(detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective
reporting (reporting bias), and other sources of bias. However,
blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) was not
assessed in this study, since it was not likely to make the partici-
pants be blind to the therapy that they received in most behavioral
intervention researches. Every domain was judged as ‘low risk’,
‘unclear risk’, or ‘high risk’ of bias (Appendix 1).

Data analysis

Considering that PTSD outcomes were continuous data and the
included studies might report the same outcome with different
measures, standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to mea-
sure the effect size, together with 95% CI, so as to make comparisons
across studies and to combine results in a meta-analysis. A negative
value indicates lower severity of PTSD symptoms in the experi-
mental group compared with the control group, as well as a larger
effect of the intervention. According to Cohen's suggestion, the
value of the effect size SMD can be rated as follows: 0.2 represents a
small effect, 0.5 a medium effect, and 0.8 a large effect.51 A two-
tailed p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
The heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with Q sta-
tistical test. A signiﬁcant p value (usually p < 0.1) or a large Q sta-
tistic with k-1 degree of freedom (k ¼ the number of studies)
suggests there existing heterogeneity between studies. However,
this test has poor power when the number of included studies is
limited or the sample size is small. Therefore, I2 statistic was also
used, which quantiﬁes the effect of heterogeneity across studies
ranging from 0% to 100%. The threshold of 25%, 50%, 75% in I2 test
indicated a low, moderate and high degree of heterogeneity,
respectively.52 A ﬁxed-effect model is adaptive when there is no
speciﬁc statistical heterogeneity among studies in a meta-analysis.
Otherwise, a random-effects model is best when there is hetero-
geneity that cannot readily be explained. Given the studies
included in the current analysis were expected to be heterogenous,
a random-effects model was adopted. Subgroup analyses and
sensitivity analysis were also conducted to further detect the
sources of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were based on control
condition, delivery of
intervention and intervention duration.
Additionally, publication bias was detected and evaluated using
funnel plots and Egger's tests.53 All statistical computing was per-
formed in R software using the meta statistical package.54

assessed mantram repetition program, a program that taught par-
ticipants to train attention and regulate emotion through practicing
certain techniques65,66; one assessed transcendental meditation,
which turned one's attention to inward to experience the source of
thought56; one assessed compassion meditation, which helped
practitioners cultivate a sense of common humanity and engender
the heartfelt wish that the self and others free from miserable-
ness67; two assessed Sudarshan Kriya yoga, a breathing-based
meditation68,69; one assessed Kripalu yoga, which was consisted
of physical postures, breathing and meditation, with an emphasis
on moving meditation.70 One assessed mindfulness-based expo-
sure therapy, which incorporated mindfulness training and expo-
sure therapy.71 One assessed integrative exercises, a combination of
aerobic exercise, strength training and yoga on the ground of
mindfulness principles.72 Despite this, all
the interventions
employed meditation practice in the programs. We provided a
summary of the relevant meditation programs with brief de-
scriptions originally extracted from the included studies (Appendix
2).

Among the included studies, four were waitlist control condi-
tions without any treatment, which were considered as non-active
control; the remaining (k ¼ 15) employed an active control con-
dition, including treatment as usual, present-centered group ther-
apy and PTSD health education. Majority of the interventions
(k ¼ 16) were done in groups, while only three were delivered
through individual to individual. Most interventions were delivered
once a week, and the intervention duration ranged from ﬁve days to
12 weeks. In view of the manualized program–MBSR–is comprised
of 8-week courses, we categorized included RCTs whose interven-
tion duration was eight weeks or longer as standard duration
(k ¼ 12), and intervention duration shorter than eight weeks as
short-term duration (k ¼ 7). Of the 19 RCTs, most (k ¼ 12) used the
Clinician Administered PTSD Scale73 as the primary measure of
PTSD symptoms, followed by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Checklist (k ¼ 7),74 and the remaining one used PTSD Symptom
Scale Interview.75 Fourteen studies performed follow-up assess-
ment apart from post-intervention assessment, and the longest
follow-up time was one year.

Regarding the potential adverse events, seven of the 19 included
studies reported that no intervention-related adverse events
occurred during the study period, while more than half (k ¼ 10)
studies failed to mention about adverse events. Two studies re-
ported the presence of adverse events during the intervention. One
study employing Sudarshan Kriya yoga reported that transient mild
psychological ailment emerged with ﬂeeting images about the past
terrible memory among some participants while they were prac-
ticing yoga breathing.68 However, it was pointed out that such re-
action was expected for the reason that re-experiencing symptoms
were closely associated with PTSD. Besides, participants’ reactions
were alleviated by slow breath practices. Another study76 reported
that two patients respectively from the intervention group and the
control group were admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit due to
worsening PTSD symptoms. It was also stressed that no partici-
pants withdrew from the MBSR intervention due to worsening
PTSD symptoms or any troubles resulted from the intervention,
which meant that the admission for inpatient psychiatry treatment
was not directly caused by the MBSR intervention.

Effect of mindfulness meditation on military-related PTSD symptoms

To verify the hypothesis that mindfulness meditation has an
advantage of
improving military-related PTSD symptoms, an
overall effect size was calculated for all the included studies. Fig. 2 is
the forest plot for PTSD treatment effects, with effect sizes for each
study. No signiﬁcant heterogeneity was found among the studies (Q

Fig. 1. Flow diagram of study selection process.

Results

As illustrated in Fig. 1, a total of 1902 records were initially
identiﬁed and screened and ﬁnally 19 studies were included. Of the
19 studies, two used a multiple-arm design (more than one inter-
vention groups with a common control group).55,56 According to
the recommended method from the Cochrane handbook, data from
all relevant intervention groups of the study were merged into a
single group.57 Therefore, the ﬁnal analyses were on the basis of 19
RCTs with a total sample size of 1326 participants.

Study characteristics

Table 1 provides a summary of the characteristics of all the
included studies. The sample size from individual study varied
greatly from 15 to 191. Of the 1326 participants, the majority were
male (median ¼ 88%), and the mean age ranged from 28.6 to 58.5
years (median ¼ 49.9 years). Though this study primarily laid stress
on mindfulness meditation, the speciﬁc meditation programs
employed in the included studies varied. Among the 19 studies
examined, seven assessed MBSR, one of which was brief mindful-
ness training with four-week courses30,40,58e62; one assessed
mindfulness meditation, and participants mainly practiced body
scanning55; two assessed mind-body bridging, a novel mind-body
intervention, which aimed to help practitioners calm and relax,
and bring them into a state of balance and harmony63,64; two

a small to medium range (SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.33, 95% CI [(cid:2)0.45, (cid:2)0.21],
p < 0.0001), indicating that mindfulness meditation had a signiﬁ-
cantly therapeutic effect on ameliorating military-related PTSD
symptoms compared with control conditions across all the studies.

Subgroup analysis

Figs. 3e5 display the results of subgroup analyses. The effect size
for studies employing an active control was similar to the overall
effect size and remained statistically signiﬁcant (SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.33, 95%
[(cid:2)0.46, (cid:2)0.19]), with no signiﬁcant heterogeneity (Q (df
CI
14) ¼ 18.31, I2 ¼ 24%, p ¼ 0.19). The studies employing a non-active
control also had a signiﬁcant effect size (SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.49, 95% CI
[(cid:2)0.88, (cid:2)0.10]), with no signiﬁcant heterogeneity (Q (df 3) ¼ 0.94,

225

I2 ¼ 0%, p ¼ 0.81). Effects did not differ between active control and
non-active control (Q ¼ 0.59, p ¼ 0.44) (Fig. 3).

No matter delivered by group (SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.30, 95% CI
[(cid:2)0.42, (cid:2)0.17]) or by individual
(SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.49, 95% CI
[(cid:2)0.90, (cid:2)0.08]), the effect sizes were both signiﬁcant. No signiﬁcant
heterogeneity existed among the group-based studies (Q (df
15) ¼ 15.09, I2 ¼ 1%, p ¼ 0.44) or the individual-based studies (Q (df
2) ¼ 4.13, I2 ¼ 52%, p ¼ 0.13). Effects did not differ between group-
based studies and individual-based studies (Q ¼ 0.77, p ¼ 0.38)
(Fig. 4).

Both interventions with a standard duration (SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.40, 95%
CI [(cid:2)0.58, (cid:2)0.21]) and a short-term duration (SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.27, 95% CI
[(cid:2)0.46, (cid:2)0.08]) had signiﬁcant effect sizes. No signiﬁcant hetero-
geneity was found among the standard duration studies (Q (df
11) ¼ 16.81, I2 ¼ 35%, p ¼ 0.11) or the short-term duration studies (Q
(df 6) ¼ 2.76, I2 ¼ 0%, p ¼ 0.84). Effects did not differ between

Discussion

A total of 1326 participants were included in this meta-analysis,
focusing on military-related PTSD and mindfulness meditation. The

227

results manifested that mindfulness meditation signiﬁcantly alle-
viated the severity of military-related PTSD symptoms compared
with control conditions. The overall effect size was SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.33,
indicating that mindfulness meditation had a signiﬁcant effect on
ameliorating military-related PTSD symptoms in a small to medium
range. There was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity among the included
studies (Q (df 18) ¼ 20, I2 ¼ 10%, p ¼ 0.33), which further supported
the general effectiveness of mindfulness meditation on military-
related PTSD. Nevertheless, such results should be interpreted
with caution since varied meditation programs, sample size,
intervention conditions and other factors may affect the treatment
effect among included studies. Additionally, no obvious differences
were found between studies with different control conditions,
formats of intervention delivery, or intervention duration, sug-
gesting that interventions with active or non-active control,
delivered by group or individual and with short-term or standard
duration were equally effective in improving military-related PTSD
symptoms.

The present results were partly in consistent with previously
published meta-analyses on similar meditation programs. For
instance, Gallegos et al.78 found that meditation and yoga were
effective in the improvement of PTSD symptoms among adults
(SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.39, 95% CI [(cid:2)0.57, (cid:2)0.22], p < 0.001, k ¼ 19). In this
meta-analysis, interventions were grouped into three categories
based on how the meditative practices engaged one's attention:
mindfulness meditation, other meditation, and yoga movement.
The results suggested that no considerable differences existed
among intervention types. However, in another systematic re-
view46 that investigated the efﬁcacy of meditation interventions on
PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, quality of life, functional
status, and adverse events in adults diagnosed with PTSD, it was
revealed that meditation appeared to improve PTSD (SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.41;
[(cid:2)0.81, (cid:2)0.01]; k ¼ 8) and depression symptoms
95% CI
(SMD ¼ (cid:2)0.34; 95% CI [(cid:2)0.59, (cid:2)0.08]; k ¼ 8) signiﬁcantly. Never-
theless, there was no substantial statistical evidence to support the
treatment effect of meditation on anxiety or quality of life, and no
functional status or adverse events were reported in the included
studies. It is worth noting that, in most published studies, medi-
tation programs were compared with waitlist control, treatment as
usual, psychoeducation, present-centered group therapy, etc.
Nearly none of studies directly compare meditation with ﬁrst-line
trauma-focused psychotherapies. Just as among the current meta-
analysis, only one study employed prolonged exposure, the “gold
standard” treatment for PTSD, as one of the intervention condi-
tions. And the results of this study demonstrated that transcen-
dental meditation was non-inferior to prolonged exposure on
relieving PTSD symptoms.56 Research is needed to further deter-
mine the treatment conditions between non-trauma-focused CAM
practices and evidence-based trauma-focused psychotherapies or
pharmacotherapies in the improvement of PTSD symptoms.

There was no signiﬁcant difference between studies employing
active or non-active control in improving PTSD symptoms. How-
ever, the study employing compassion meditation, which was
adapted specially for veterans, had the largest effect size compared
with “veteran. calm”da “mind-body intervention” with a focus on
relaxation. This observation did not correspond with the previous
ﬁnding that studies comparing mindfulness meditation with
waitlist control conditions had the largest effect size and studies
comparing mindfulness meditation with an active PTSD treatment
(cognitive-behavior therapy) had the smallest effect size.44 It might
enlighten the development of
for
military-related PTSD. No matter delivered by group or by indi-
vidual, meditation practices had a signiﬁcant effect on PTSD
symptoms, which could be considered as a prominent advantage in
practical application, especially in the military context. In addition,

the specialized treatment

it was found that interventions with short-term duration and
standard duration were equally effective in improving PTSD
symptoms. However, it should be mentioned that the intervention
duration in this review merely referred to the total timespan in-
terventions lasted which might lead to this result, while the precise
intervention duration of each study was not calculated. A previous
study suggested that meditation with a longer duration was asso-
ciated with greater improvement in PTSD symptoms.44

In relation to adverse effects, in the studies included in this
meta-analysis, some reported no intervention-related adverse ef-
fects or the adverse effects were uncommon and mild, while many
did not involve the assessment of adverse effects. However, a recent
review on the prevalence of adverse events in meditation showed
that the total prevalence was 8.3%, and the most reported were
anxiety and depression.79 Moreover, it was demonstrated that
meditation training might aggravate the severity of PTSD symp-
toms under some circumstances,80 which should be taken into
serious consideration for both therapists and practitioners when
using meditation practices to improve PTSD or other mental
disorders.

instance,

Several limitations must be considered in light of the current
ﬁndings. First, the attrition rate was not estimated though ma-
jority of the studies reported completion rates. The existing of
diverse deﬁnitions of completion across studies was the main
some studies deﬁned completion as
cause. For
attending four or more sessions, while some deﬁned completion
as attending all sessions. Second, the severity of PTSD symptoms
was the only outcome estimated in the current study. To our
knowledge, veterans with PTSD tend to be comorbid with other
mental disorders (such as depression and sleep disorders) and
get impairments in social functioning (such as terrible relation-
ships with families and high possibility of unemployment).81,82 It
is demonstrated that mindfulness meditation is a promising
intervention that is applicable to a wide range of psychological
disorders, such as depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and sub-
stance abuse,83 which further provides evidence for potential
beneﬁts of the intervention. Third, existing studies suggested
that the increases in mindfulness were associated with reduction
in PTSD symptoms. However, the increase in mindfulness post
treatment were not estimated in this study for the reason that
there were only a part of studies addressing mindfulness. Finally,
some included studies were rated as high or unclear risk of bias,
which meant the evidence for the results of this meta-analysis
might be underpowered and caution must be taken when
interpreting the results.

Despite the limitations outlined above, the meta-analysis
succeeded in identifying that mindfulness meditation might be
an effective and feasible alternative to treat military-related
PTSD. The current meta-analysis
focused on the military
personnel, among which the prevalence of PTSD was higher than
general population. Additionally, one important ﬁnding of this
review was that a variety of existing studies on meditation pro-
grams for PTSD are of poor quality. Take the process of
randomization assignment for example, many studies reported
inadequately about the generation of random sequences. Future
RCTs with high quality and rigorous design are needed to further
determine the effectiveness and viability of meditation programs
in the treatment of PTSD.

In conclusion, ﬁndings from this meta-analysis consolidated the
efﬁcacy and feasibility of mindfulness meditation in the treatment
of military-related PTSD. Mindfulness meditation had a signiﬁcant
effect on alleviating PTSD symptoms compared with both active
and non-active control conditions. Importantly, it is noteworthy
that meditation practices do have several advantages in treating
PTSD among military personnel. For instance, most training

techniques are easy to master, and can be implemented in routine
practice. Moreover, there is no necessity of a licensed medical
worker to deliver relevant courses and an experienced therapist or
practitioner can guide the whole process, which may expand the
use of these interventions in army.

Despite encouraging attention has been paid to mindfulness
meditation, future research with higher quality and more rigorous
design as well as standardization of training programs84 is required
to provide evidence for the efﬁcacy of this kind of therapies on
PTSD and other mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and
sleep disorders. Furthermore, the combination of mindfulness
meditation with existing evidence-based therapies is needed to
develop more options for the management of various mental dis-
orders, which may contribute to individualized treatment for
different patients.
