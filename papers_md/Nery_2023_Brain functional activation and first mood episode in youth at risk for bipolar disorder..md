Abstract

Background:  In order to identify biomarkers of prodromal mood disorders, we examined 
functional brain activation in children and adolescent at familial risk for bipolar disorder.

Methods:  Offspring of parents with bipolar I disorder (at-risk youth; N=115, mean±SD age: 
13.6±2.7; 54% girls) and group-matched offspring of healthy parents (healthy controls; N=58, 
mean±SD age: 14.2±3.0; 53% girls) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while 
performing a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distracters. At baseline, 
at-risk youth had no history of mood episodes or psychotic disorders. Subjects were followed 
longitudinally until developing their first mood episode or being lost to follow-up. Standard 
event-related region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were performed to compare brain activation at 
baseline between groups and in survival analyses.

Results:  At baseline, at-risk youth exhibited reduced activation to emotional distracters in the 
right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) (p=0.04). Activation was not significantly altered 
in additional ROIs, including left VLPFC, bilateral amygdala, caudate, or putamen. In those 
at-risk youth who developed their first mood episode during follow-up (n=17), baseline increased 
activation in right VLPFC, right caudate, and right putamen activation predicted the development 
of a mood episode.

Limitations:  Sample size of converters, loss to follow-up, and number of statistical comparisons.

Conclusions:  We found preliminary evidence that a reduced activation in right VLPFC might 
be a marker of risk for or resilience to mood disorders in at-risk youth. Conversely, an increased 
activation in the right VLPFC, caudate, and putamen might indicate an increased risk for the later 
development of their first mood episode.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder is highly heritable, consequently, children of parents with bipolar disorder 
are more likely to develop bipolar disorder compared with the general population (hereafter, 
referred as at-risk youth) (Birmaher et al., 2009; DelBello and Geller, 2001). Moreover, 
for approximately two thirds of adults with bipolar disorder, initial symptoms emerged 
during adolescence (Birmaher et al., 2009; Duffy et al., 2014; Nurnberger et al., 2011). 
Longitudinal studies suggest that the first manifestations of bipolar disorder are typically 
symptoms of depression and anxiety, which appear during adolescence, followed by a 
first episode of mania, which commonly manifest in the young adulthood (Duffy et al., 
2014; Hafeman et al., 2016; Nurnberger et al., 2011). Besides depression and anxiety, 
other prodromal symptoms of bipolar disorder include subthreshold manic or hypomanic 
symptoms, and affective lability (Duffy et al., 2014; Faedda et al., 2015; Hafeman et al., 
2016; Van Meter et al., 2016). Therefore, the study of at-risk youth during adolescence 
provides an opportunity to understand the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the 
emergence of mood disorders in those at increased risk.

It has been hypothesized that bipolar disorder is characterized by dysfunction in affective 
regulation and attentional processes (Phillips and Swartz, 2014; Strakowski et al., 2012). 
Structural, neurochemical, and functional abnormalities within the anterior emotional 
control network, a neural network that includes the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), 
thalamus, amygdala, and striatum appear to underlie the dysfunctional affective and 
cognitive processes that occur in individuals with bipolar disorder (Phillips and Swartz, 
2014; Strakowski et al., 2012). Given that depressive symptoms, affective instability, and 
anxiety appear to be prodromal manifestations of mood disorders among those at familial 
risk, there is an urgent need to investigate whether there are neurobiological abnormalities in 
at-risk youth that could be associated with these early clinical manifestations and with the 
increased risk for developing mood disorders.

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies revealed abnormal 
functional activity within the anterior emotional control network in at-risk youth, suggesting 
that these abnormalities are possible markers of risk or resilience to mood disorders in those 
at familial risk (Schneider et al., 2012). For instance, in response to emotional tasks, at-risk 
youth exhibit increased right VLPFC (Ladouceur et al., 2013), and amygdala activation 
(Manelis et al., 2015; Olsavsky et al., 2012). In response to reward/loss task, they exhibit 
decreased activation of the pregenual cingulate, and an abnormal functional connectivity 
between the pregenual cingulate and the right VLPFC, (Singh et al., 2014b) between the

anterior cingulate and the right ventral striatum, and between the right orbitofrontal cortex 
and right pars orbitalis (a subregion of the VLPFC) (Acuff et al., 2019). Some resting state 
fMRI studies also demonstrated that at-risk youth exhibit increased functional connectivity 
between the right VLPFC and the ventral striatum, (Manelis et al., 2016), the right amygdala 
and the left hippocampus and left insula,(Lin et al., 2018), and in the left executive 
control network (Singh et al., 2014a) while others reported no differences in resting 
state networks (Sole-Padulles et al., 2016). Finally, using a continuous performance test 
with emotional distracters (CPT-END), which probes attentional processes and emotional 
regulation (Yamasaki et al., 2002), our group found that at-risk youth with and without 
depression have higher left VLPFC activation compared with healthy subjects (Welge et 
al., 2016). Although most of these studies converge to suggest that at-risk youth exhibit 
abnormal brain activation within the anterior emotional control network, they are all limited 
by their cross-sectional design. To our knowledge, no longitudinal study has evaluated 
whether baseline neurofunctional abnormalities are associated with subsequent development 
of mood episodes in youth at familial risk for developing bipolar disorder.

With these considerations in mind, we prospectively evaluated at-risk youth to determine 
whether functional abnormalities within the anterior emotional control network are 
associated with familial risk for bipolar disorder and with the development of a first 
mood episode. We hypothesized that early functional abnormalities in the developmental 
of the anterior emotional control network leads to an impaired emotional regulation and 
consequent increased risk for mood disorders among at-risk youth. We predicted that: 
1) at-risk youth would exhibit abnormal brain functional activation during a continuous 
performance task with emotional distracters in the VLPFC, amygdala, and striatum 
compared with offspring of healthy comparison subjects; 2) abnormal baseline activation 
to emotional stimuli in the VLPFC, amygdala, and striatum is a prodromal marker of a mood 
episode during follow-up in at-risk youth.

The original sample consisted of offspring of parents with bipolar disorder type I (“at-risk 
youth”, N=122) and offspring of healthy parents (“healthy controls”, N=62) from a large, 
longitudinal study of offspring of parents with bipolar disorder I. Seven at-risk youth and 
4 healthy controls did not receive fMRI or data quality was poor, and were excluded from 
this report, hence the final sample is comprised of 115 at-risk youth and 58 healthy controls. 
We recruited subjects from the local community through posted flyers and word of mouth. 
After study procedures were explained, subjects (if over 18 years old), or parents or legal 
guardians gave written informed consent and youth (if less than 18 years old) gave written 
assent to participate in the study. The University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board 
approved all procedures related to this study, and all the procedures were in accordance with 
the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.

At-risk youth were included if they were between 9 and 20 years old, had at least one 
biological parent with bipolar disorder type I, and had no DSM-IV major mood or psychotic 
disorder in themselves, including bipolar disorder types I, or II, cyclothymia, dysthymia, 
major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic disorder

not otherwise specified (NOS). Depressive disorder NOS and bipolar disorder NOS were 
allowed as they are possible prodromal manifestations of major depressive disorder and 
bipolar disorder in this at-risk population. Healthy controls were included if they were 
between 9 and 20 years old, had no personal history of any Axis I psychiatric disorder, and 
had no first or second degree relatives with any history of mood or psychotic disorders. 
Exclusion criteria for both groups were any history of alcohol or drug dependence, or any 
alcohol or drug abuse within the previous 3 months, any medical or neurological disorder 
that could influence results, IQ lower than 70, any contraindication to MRI scan (e.g., 
braces, metallic implants), living more than 100 miles from the University of Cincinnati or 
unable to attend follow-up visits, and any history of head trauma with loss of consciousness 
more than 10 minutes.

At baseline, psychiatric diagnoses were determined using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) (Kaufman et al., 1997), and 
the Mood Disorders section of the Washington University at St. Louis Kiddie-Schedule for 
Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U KSADS) (Geller et al., 2001) in offspring, 
and using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) (First 
et al., 2002) in parents. Diagnoses were validated in best estimate meetings attended by 
at least three board-certified psychiatrists or child psychiatrists or psychologists. We used 
the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 items (HAMD) to assess depressive symptoms 
(Hamilton, 1976) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) to assess manic symptoms 
(Young et al., 1978). Diagnostic and rating scale reliability were obtained by trained raters 
with established reliability (all diagnostic κ and ICC > 0.9). Pubertal status was assessed 
using the Duke Tanner Pubertal Self Rating Scale (Morris and Udry, 1980), and handedness 
was assessed using the Crovitz Handedness Questionnaire (Crovitz and Zener, 1962).

After baseline visit, subjects were followed every 1–4 months. During each follow up visit, 
the presence, severity, and duration of mood symptoms during each follow-up interval were 
assessed using the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE) interview (Leon et 
al., 2000), which includes week-by-week YMRS, HDRS, and CGI ratings. At-risk youth 
who exhibited HAMD or YMRS total scores >7 or a CGI-S score >2 were re-evaluated 
for the presence of a mood syndrome (manic, mixed, hypomanic or depressed) using the 
KSADS-PL (for patients <18 years of age) or the SCID (for patients >18 years of age). 
If the at-risk youth met DSM-IV criteria for a mood syndrome, they were categorized 
as “converters”. If they did not meet criteria, they were identified as “at increased risk” 
(by virtue of these mood symptoms) and followed more frequently (e.g., monthly) until 
symptoms diminished or progressed to meet episode criteria. Follow up was naturalistic, and 
in every follow up visit, exposure to any psychotropic medication was collected.

T1-weighted MRI scans were obtained using a 4-Tesla MRI Varian whole-body scanner 
(Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), located at the University of Cincinnati’s Center for Imaging 
Research. During each scan, subjects were recumbent in the bed of the scanner and a 
volume TEM (Transverse Electromagnetic) head coil was placed over their head. Earplugs 
and headphones were provided to block background noise, and precautions were taken 
to minimize subject motion during the MRI study. For anatomical localization, a high 
resolution T1-weighted 3-dimensional brain scan was obtained (Lee et al., 1995). Next,

subjects underwent a single fMRI scan with whole-brain images being acquired every 3 
seconds using a T2-weighted gradient-echo planar imaging pulse sequence, with repetition 
time 3,000 ms, echo time 29 ms, field of view 20.8 × 20.8 cm, matrix 64 × 64 pixels, slice 
thickness 5 mm, and flip angle 75°, while performing the fMRI task. Subjects with ADHD 
diagnosis and on use of stimulants at baseline were asked to hold their stimulant medication 
72 hours prior to the scan.

We used fMRI to examine regional brain activation while subjects performed a continuous 
performance task with emotional and neutral distracters (CPT-END), as previously described 
(Strakowski et al., 2011; Welge et al., 2016; Yamasaki et al., 2002). The CPT-END allows 
the evaluation of the ventral (emotional) and dorsal (cognitive) prefrontal networks – which 
are putatively dysfunctional in bipolar disorder. The CPT-END is a visual oddball paradigm 
in which subjects are presented simple, colored squares (which is the baseline cue), simple 
colored circles (called targets), emotionally neutral pictures (neutral cue), and emotionally 
unpleasant pictures (emotional cue) (Figure 1). Each visual cue required that the subject 
press a single button (Button 1) in response to square and pictures, or a second button 
(Button 2) in response to circles (targets). Seventy percent of the cues are baseline cues 
(squares) while 10% are target cues (circles), 10% are neutral cues, and 10% are emotional 
cues. Each session consisted of two runs, with 158 visual cues per run, presented at 3-second 
intervals for two seconds each. A fixation cross was presented for one second between cues.

We used the Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI; http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni) 
software to analyze the fMRI data. First, raw MR images were reconstructed and converted 
into AFNI format. Structural and echoplanar imaging (functional) images were coregistered 
based on scanner coordinates. Participant motion was determined in 6 directions of rotation 
and translation using the motion correction program in AFNI. AFNI corrected for small 
movement through realignment, and if excessive movement or warping was observed, 
the repetition time was removed from the analysis. We used a 6-parameter rigid body 
transformation to correct functional images for motion (Cox and Jesmanowicz, 1999). We 
inspected each volume for signal artifacts using a semiautomated algorithm in AFNI and the 
images were excluded from further analysis if uncorrectable head movement occurred (Page 
et al., 2010). If a subject’s scan required more than 20% of their volumes to be removed in 
this manner, the scan was rejected from further analyses.

We transformed the anatomic and functional maps into stereotactic Talairach space using the 
International Consortium for Brain Mapping 452 template (Laboratory of NeuroImaging, 
University of California, Los Angeles). We included motion correction parameters as 
regressors of no interest, and we removed low-frequency components of the signal. A 
Gaussian blur with a full width at half maximum of 7.2 mm was applied and converted to 
percentage of signal change. Percentage of signal change was the variable of interest entered 
into ROI statistical models. Then, we created individual voxel-wise, event-related activation 
maps according to standard AFNI procedures using 3dDeconvolve (Cox, 1996; Cox and 
Hyde, 1997). This results in event-related response functions for the unpleasant pictures, 
neutral pictures, and circles (the targets) with squares providing the baseline response 
against which hemodynamic responses were assessed.

We extracted event-related region-of-interest (ROI) measures to test our hypotheses. ROI 
values were extracted as a mean value within the ROI from contrast maps and excluded 
non-zero voxels. ROI masks were created for the anterior emotional control network using 
the automatic anatomic labeling atlas in AFNI (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). The ROIs 
included bilateral: VLPFC (Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45/47), amygdala, caudate, and 
putamen (Strakowski et al., 2012; Strawn et al., 2016; Welge et al., 2016). For each ROI, 
activation for the left and right hemisphere were determined separately. The primary variable 
of interest in this study was the percentage change in blood oxygen-level dependent signal 
activation to emotional minus squares stimuli. We chose this contrast because it provides the 
best discrimination of ventral areas participating in emotional regulation as opposed to pure 
attention regulation (Strakowski et al., 2011; Yamasaki et al., 2002).

Demographic and clinical characteristics comparisons were performed using t-test or 
Fisher’s exact tests for continuous data and chi-square test for categorical data. Assumptions 
of normality were tested with Kolgomorov-Smirnov tests for the key continuous variables 
(age, baseline depressive and manic symptoms, ROI activation values). Since there were no 
bimodal distribution and highly skewed data was observed only for baseline depressive and 
manic symptoms, we used non-parametric tests only for the later variables. We converted 
the ROI mean scores to standardized z scores for the statistical analyses. To test our first 
hypothesis, we used t-tests to compare brain activation in different ROIs between at-risk 
youth and healthy controls groups, and we provide Cohen’s d for an estimate of the effect 
sizes of differences between groups. Since both groups were well-balanced in terms of 
demographic characteristics, we did not adjust for any nuisance variable. We explored for 
correlations between baseline depressive and manic symptoms and baseline ROI activation 
with Spearman bivariate correlation analyses. To test our second hypothesis, we used Cox 
regression survival analysis to examine the association between baseline ROI activation and 
time to develop a mood episode. The subject groups were converters and non-converters, and 
predictors were ROI activation values. Given the possible interaction of brain development 
and baseline affective symptoms in risk for mood disorders, and associations between 
baseline depressive and manic symptoms, ROI activation values, and survival time, we 
estimated secondary post hoc Cox regressions adjusting for age, baseline depressive, and 
manic symptoms (Supplementary Material).

We did not correct our results for multiple comparisons. We considered the uncorrected 
result as the most desirable balance of error rates in the spirit of optimal decision theory, 
which considers the relative severity of false and negative rate along with the absolute 
risk of each error type (Berger, 1980; De Groot, 1970). We balanced the risk of false 
positives against the risk of failure to detect moderate yet clinically relevant associations. 
We calculated that for the available sample sizes, the power of a two-group t-test to detect 
differences of at least 0.50 standard deviations was 0.87 (β=0.13) when α=0.05, two-sided. 
Since in our estimation, false positives and false negatives are approximately equal in 
seriousness in this context, we found the ratio of β/α=0.13/0.05=2.6 to be appropriate.

All analyses were two-sided with a significance level of 0.05. Statistical analyses were 
performed using IBM SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) version 23.

At-risk youth and healthy controls did not differ in age, sex, race, IQ, or pubertal status 
(Table 1).

Baseline analysis

Task performance did not significantly differ between at-risk youth and healthy controls 
on percentage of correct responses for emotional (p=0.55) or square (p=0.25) stimuli. 
There were also no statistically significant group differences for reaction time during 
emotional (p=0.52), neutral (p=0.47), square (p=0.21), or circle (p=0.85) stimuli (Table S1, 
Supplementary Material).

At baseline, at-risk youth exhibited reduced activation to emotional stimuli in the right 
VLPFC (BA 45/47) compared with healthy controls (p=0.04). Activation associated with 
emotional distracters in the other ROIs did not significantly differ between groups (Table 2 
and Figure S1).

Baseline HAMD scores had a mild negative correlation with baseline activation in the right 
VLPFC (r=−0.2, p=0.05), and no significant correlation with any of the remaining ROIs (r 
values varying from 0.0 to −0.9, p values varying from 0.05 to 1.0). YMRS scores were not 
significantly correlated with baseline activation in any of the ROIs (r values varying from 
−0.01 to 0.16, p values ranging from 0.3 to 1.0).

Longitudinal analysis

Of those at-risk youth with available baseline fMRI, 17 developed a mood episode during 
follow-up (converters), including 12 with major depressive episodes, and 5 with manic or 
mixed episodes. The mean±S.D. time for developing a mood episode was 200±71 weeks 
(median: 197 weeks; mode: 80 weeks; range: 80–344 weeks). Seventy-one subjects did 
not develop a mood episode (non-converters) during their follow-up period, which was 
125±87.1 weeks (median: 105 weeks; mode: 132 weeks; range: 1–407 weeks). At-risk 
youth who did and who did not develop a mood episode during follow-up were similar in 
terms of demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample (Table 3). At-risk youth 
who developed a mood episode during follow-up exhibited higher baseline activation 
to emotional distracters across several ROIs, including bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal 
cortex (BA 44, and BA 45/47), right amygdala, bilateral caudate, and bilateral putamen) 
compared to at-risk youth who did not develop mood episodes, except in the left amygdala 
(Supplementary Material, Table S2 and Figure S2). Twenty-seven at-risk did not return after 
the baseline visit and were excluded from all longitudinal analysis.

Survival analysis showed that neither age nor sex were significantly associated with time 
to develop a mood episode (for age, hazard ratio (HR)=0.9, 95% C.I.=0.7–1.1, p=0.15; for 
sex, HR=0.6, 95% C.I.=0.2–1.8, p=0.36). Baseline depressive and manic symptoms were 
associated with increased risk to develop a mood episode during follow-up (HR=1.1, 95% 
C.I.=1.0–1.2, p=0.01, for depressive symptoms, and HR=1.1, 95% C.I.=1.1–1.2, p=0.006, 
for subthreshold manic symptoms).

Survival analyses showed that baseline activation to emotional distracters was associated 
with time to develop a mood episode during follow-up in the right VLPFC (BA 45/47) 
(HR)=1.6, 95% C.I.=1.04–2.6, p=0.03), in the right caudate (HR=1.9, 95% C.I.=1.1–3.1, 
p=0.02), and in the right putamen (HR=2.55, 95% C.I.=1.3–4.9, p=0.005). These results 
did not change when adjusted for age and baseline depressive symptoms but lost statistical 
significance when adjusting for baseline subthreshold manic symptoms (Supplementary 
Material). There were no other statistically significant associations between baseline 
activation to emotional distracters for other ROIs and development of a mood episode during 
follow-up (Table 4).

Given the high rate of ADHD among our sample of at-risk youth, and evidence showing 
that stimulant treatment increases right inferior frontal cortex and striatum activation during 
tasks of attention and working memory in adolescents with ADHD (Rubia et al., 2014), and 
a normalizing effect of stimulants on prefrontal and thalamic brain activation (Hart et al., 
2013; McCarthy et al., 2014), we performed post hoc survival analysis for right VLPFC, 
right caudate, and right putamen adjusting for prior stimulant exposure and ADHD. Results 
were essentially the same, with no overall changes in hazard risk or results of significance 
tests.

Discussion

In this prospective study, at-risk youth who never had a mood episode exhibited baseline 
decreased activation to emotional stimuli in the right VLPFC (BA 45/47) while performing 
a sustained attention task. We did not confirm our initial prediction, i.e., that at baseline, 
at-risk youth would exhibit increased activation of the anterior emotional control network 
areas compared with healthy controls. Only one previous fMRI study observed increased 
right VLPFC activation in response to emotional stimuli (Ladouceur et al., 2013), while 
another resting state fMRI study found increased functional connectivity between right 
VLPFC and right striatum (Manelis et al., 2016). In a smaller sample, our group did not 
find abnormal activation in at-risk youth compared to healthy subjects (Welge et al., 2016). 
Different from the abovementioned fMRI studies, the present study had a considerable 
larger sample, whose subjects were included prior to developing major depressive or bipolar 
disorder, which is a strength of this study. The finding of reduced activation in the right 
VLPFC (BA 45/47), but not in extended areas of the network, would not survive correction 
for multiple comparisons, therefore, should be seen as preliminary.

It is noteworthy that when separating the at-risk youth in groups according to development 
of a mood episode during follow-up, those who developed a mood episode exhibited higher 
baseline activation across many of the studied ROIs, including in their right VLPFC and 
right striatum. This is in contrast with those who did not develop a mood episode, who 
showed decreased activation. Survival analyses showed that baseline activation in the right 
VLPFC (BA 45/47) and right striatum was associated with a higher risk of developing 
a mood episode during follow-up. The increased activation in these areas might be a 
correlate of prodromal illness. An abnormal regional brain activation may reflect early 
neurofunctional changes that underlie the early behavioral changes associated with a full

syndromic mood episode. They may represent a neurofunctional risk marker, potentially 
related to incipient illness.

To our knowledge, there has not been any other published prospective imaging study 
examining regional brain activation as a predictor of the development of mood disorders 
among at-risk youth, hence, our ability to compare our findings with others is limited. 
Our baseline group comparison findings are in contrast with other fMRI studies in youth 
at-risk youth that found increased activation of the right VLPFC in response to an emotional 
memory task (Ladouceur et al., 2013), and increased amygdala activation to an emotional 
task (Manelis et al., 2015; Olsavsky et al., 2012). Other studies found abnormal functional 
connectivity between the right VLPFC and the pregenual cingulate and the right VLPFC to 
a reward/loss task (Singh et al., 2014b), or increased resting state functional connectivity 
between the right VLPFC and the ventral striatum (Manelis et al., 2016), and in the left 
executive control network (Singh et al., 2014a) compared with controls. Taken together, our 
findings suggest that the right prefrontal cortex-subcortical network is involved in the risk 
for bipolar disorder.

The lack of abnormal amygdala activation to emotional stimuli contrasts with previous 
studies in at-risk youth that found increased activation in response to other emotional 
paradigms (Ladouceur et al., 2013; Manelis et al., 2015; Olsavsky et al., 2012), but in 
accordance with our previous study of at-risk youth (Welge et al., 2016). Differences 
in attentional demands might partially explain these discrepancies, as our study used an 
attentional paradigm, and engagement of attentional networks might attenuate an amygdala 
activation (Pessoa et al., 2005). Our findings are in line with neurophysiological models 
of mood disorders, which postulate that there is a decreased prefrontal cortex “top-down” 
modulation in mood disorders (Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Phillips et al., 2008). According 
to this model, in bipolar disorder, prefrontal cortex areas, especially the VLPFC and the 
ventromedial PFC, might be unable to modulate a hyperactive amygdala/striatum when 
processing emotion or reward (Phillips and Swartz, 2014; Strakowski et al., 2012).

An important limitation of this study is the number of statistical comparisons. Although the 
available samples are relatively large for fMRI studies, we needed to balance the risk of false 
positives against the risk of failure to detect moderate yet clinically relevant associations. 
Although we found our ratio of false positive against false negative to be appropriate, it 
should be noted that, if we apply a more conservative Bonferroni correction (i.e., correcting 
our results for 35 comparisons), our results would be negative.

There are additional limitations to be considered. First, the number of converters limited 
the statistical power of tests including this subgroup. That being said, longitudinal studies 
spanning a follow-up period in a developmental critical period like this are notably difficult 
to perform, and to our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal fMRI study to report 
functional imaging correlates of risk to develop mood disorders in this at-risk population. 
Second, some subjects were lost to follow-up, hence our decision to use survival analysis, 
which considers censoring of these subjects. Third, the spatial resolution of some ROIs, 
especially the BA 45/47 might be low. Future studies with better spatial resolution should be

done to replicate these findings. Therefore, our results should be seen as preliminary and be 
replicated by future studies using different functional imaging approaches.

In conclusion, at-risk youth may have reduced right VLPFC activation to emotional stimuli 
compared with healthy controls, a finding that may represent a risk or resilience marker for 
development of mood disorders. Those subjects who eventually developed a mood episode 
during follow-up had higher activation in the right VLPFC and right striatum, which was 
also associated with higher hazard of developing a mood episode during follow-up. This 
might be a risk marker for the development of mood disorders in at-risk youth. These 
preliminary findings are broadly consistent with a hypothesis of a dysfunctional prefrontal 
cortex-subcortical modulation when processing attention and emotion and may help to 
clarify the neurophysiology of risk for developing bipolar disorder.

Offspring of parents with bipolar I disorder are at high risk for mood 
disorders.

We studied risk for mood disorders in bipolar offspring using brain imaging.

We used an attentional task with emotional stimuli to probe brain function.

Bipolar offspring had abnormal functional activation in right prefrontal 
cortex.

Right prefrontal cortex activation predicted a mood episode in bipolar 
offspring.

The most common medications prescribed were for ADHD (16 subjects were on stimulants, 2 subjects on bupropion). One subject had a brief 
exposure to low dose risperidone (4 days before study entry), one was on amitriptyline for chronic headache, and 4 reported prior use of fluoxetine, 
escitalopram, and aripiprazole, without information on duration of use. Abbreviations: SD (standard deviation), HAMD (Hamilton Depression 
Rating Scale), YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale), IQ (intelligence quotient), NOS (not otherwise specified)
