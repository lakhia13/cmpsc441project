Work stress is consistently linked with the deterioration of cognitive and mental health, 
limitations  in  everyday  workplace  performance,  and  an  increased  risk  of  developing 
diseases. A common thread binding these consequences appears to be stress-associated 
alterations in neuropsychological functions and affective domains, especially those reliant 
on hippocampal, prefrontal, and amygdala brain area. Although research broadly supports 
the claim that the practice of mindfulness meditation for the reduction of the consequences 
of stress and the promotion of health exert positive effects on workplaces, the precise 
neuropsychological benefits of Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in the context of 
organizations remain elusive. In this review, we will analyze the impairments imposed by 
stress on the brain areas and functions and the benefits of MBIs from a neuropsychological 
point of view. This is significant since there is a centrality of cognitive functions in core 
processes necessary for work achievements, such as emotion regulation, problem-solving, 
and learning. The promotion of wellbeing is a responsibility shared between workers and 
organizations. Developing healthy environments allows workers to exercise greater control 
over their work, face work challenges, work productively and develop their talent.

INTRODUCTION

The  economy  and  the  world  of  work  have  been  transformed  by  globalization  and  technological 
innovation.  In  recent  years,  the  need  to  adopt  new  types  of  jobs,  an  increase  in  demands, 
increased  pressure  of  work  quality  and  productivity,  and  increased  time  restrictions  have  been 
observed systematically (Spontón et al., 2019). Phenomena relating to work stress have increased 
rapidly  as  a  result,  which  represents  a  major  health  risk  factor  (Morera  et  al.,  2019).

It  is  therefore  imperative  to  develop  a  variety  of  strategies  to  protect  workers’  health  (Vella 
and  McIver,  2018).  Within  these  strategies,  initiatives  have  been  carried  out  for  years,  such 
as  the  promotion  of  greater  personal  control,  looking  after  democratic  participation  and  a 
sense  of  community  among  workers  through  unions  (Hagedorn  et  al.,  2016),  and  job  design 
by  the  employer  with  the  promotion  of  “salutogenic”  environments  (Jenny  et  al.,  2017).  In 
the  attempt  to  improve  these  work  environments,  mindfulness  appears  as  a  contemporary 
intervention  with  promising  results  in  different  settings  and  populations  (Ludwig  and  Kabat-
Zinn,  2008;  Bohlmeijer  et  al.,  2010).

Stress and Mindfulness

There  is  an  increasing  body  of  evidence  on  the  effectiveness 
of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in improving health, 
wellbeing, and job satisfaction and in reducing workplace stress 
(Kersemaekers  et  al.,  2018;  Rupprecht  et  al.,  2018,  2019). 
However,  it  is  very  important  for  organizations  to  contemplate 
a  neuropsychological  point  of  view  since  cognitive  symptoms 
constitute an important cause of everyday performance limitations 
in  the  workplace  and  may  be  pre-clinical  markers  of  the  onset 
of  ill-health  (Sareen  et  al.,  2006;  Delphin-Combe  et  al.,  2016; 
Fung  et  al.,  2018).  Integrated  models  are  therefore  necessary 
to  account  for  how  MBIs  modify  dysregulated  emotional  and 
neuropsychological responses to stress in organizations combining 
different benefits. This mini-review will analyze the impairments 
stress  imposes  on  brain  areas  and  functions  and  how  MBIs 
can  help  from  a  neuropsychological  standpoint.

Neuropsychology of Stress
When  faced  with  a  stressor,  a  person’s  organism  is  biologically 
wired  to  activate  a  protective  physiological  response  triggered 
by  the  HPA  axis  (interaction  between  the  pituitary  gland,  the 
hypothalamus,  and  the  adrenal  glands),  which  produces 
glucocorticoid  hormones,  particularly  cortisol  (McEwen  and 
Gianaros,  2011).  Glucocorticoids  (GC)  affect  the  organism  in 
multiple ways to increase its energy reserves and ensure adequate 
protection  from,  and  adaptation  to,  the  new  environmental 
demands  (Sapolsky,  2015;  Cameron  and  Schoenfeld,  2018). 
When such stressful situations become repetitive or long-lasting, 
the  organism’s  reaction  is  to  produce  these  chemicals  in  excess 
(McEwen and Wingfield, 2010), or to manage them inefficiently. 
This affects several regions of the cognitive and affective domains 
(Hermans  et  al.,  2014).  There  are  clearly  serious  effects  of 
stress  on  the  structure  of  neurons  in  the  prefrontal  cortex, 
the  hippocampus,  and  the  amygdala  (Figure  1).

Impact of Stress on the Prefrontal Brain
Experimental data support the notion that stress has a harmful 
effect  on  the  higher  order  cognitive  functions  that  depend  on 
the  prefrontal  cortex  (PFC),  mainly  working  memory  and 
cognitive flexibility processes (Arnsten, 2009; Mika et al., 2012; 
McEwen  and  Morrison,  2013).  This  area  of  the  brain  has  been 
found 
to  contain  moderate  or  high  concentrations  of 
glucocorticoid receptors (Kuipers et al., 2003; Kavushansky and 
Richter-Levin,  2006).  According  to  different  studies,  the  PFC 
is  the  region  of  the  brain  that  responds  to  stress  with  the 
highest  sensitivity;  quick  changes  have  been  observed  in  the 
functions  depending  on  it  (Brown  et  al.,  2005).  Moreover, 
research  on  burnout  patients  has  shown  that  impairments 
related  mainly  to  the  speed,  attention  and  executive  function 
of  cognitive  functions  persist  for  3 years  or  more  even  after 
the  stressor  disappears  (Jonsdottir  et  al.,  2017).

Data  of  this  sort  are  essential  for  organizations,  as  the  PFC 
is  the  brain  region  responsible  for  executing  complex  cognitive 
processes.  Working  memory  (WM)  for  example,  which  is 
dependent  on  the  PFC,  involves  the  ability  to  consider  a  very 
recent  event,  or  to  retrieve  particular  information  stored  in 
long-term  memory,  and  to  make  use  of  this  representational 

knowledge  in  the  present,  thus  regulating  behavior  (Arnsten, 
2009).  Thanks 
information  can 
to  WM,  goal-relevant 
be  maintained  and  manipulated  selectively  over  short  intervals 
(ranging  between  a  few  seconds  and  several  minutes),  with 
no  distraction  from  irrelevant  information.  WM  has  a  limited 
capacity  and  is  necessary  for  complex  thought  processes  and 
fluid behavior. It is crucial to reasoning, planning, and decision-
making  (Jha  et  al.,  2019).

The  PFC  is  also  involved  in  the  processes  that  regulate  our 
thoughts,  actions,  and  emotions  by  protecting  mental 
representations  from  being  interfered  by  external  or  internal 
distractions.  It  is  crucial  to  inhibiting  inappropriate  behaviors 
and promoting operations relevant to tasks at work and everyday 
life  activities.  The  operations  governed  by  the  PFC  enable 
behavior  to  be  flexibly  regulated  and  help  us  to  produce 
appropriate  responses  to  a  changing  environment  (Arnsten, 
2009).  One  example  of  this  is  the  ability  to  shift  attentional 
focus, to alter decision-making as it takes place, and to modify  
contingencies.

suffer  electro-physiological  alterations 

Impact of Stress on the Hippocampal 
Brain Area
When we are chronically exposed to high levels of glucocorticoids, 
we 
that  generate 
dysfunction,  atrophy,  and  death  of  neurons  in  areas  of  the 
brain  like  the  hippocampus  that  are  essential  to  learning  and 
memory  (McEwen  et  al.,  2016).  Studies  with  both  rodents  and 
primates  (Sandi,  2013)  have  shown  that  exposure  to  chronic 
stress  results  in  atrophy  of  the  dendritic  prolongations  of  the 
main  neurons  of  the  hippocampus,  reducing  the  interneuronal 
synaptic  connections  and,  hence,  neural  and  synaptic  plasticity 
(Kim  et  al.,  2015).

In  the  workplace,  impairment  of  these  functions  is  likely 
to  weaken  an  individual’s  ability  to  process  information  in 
new  situations,  for  instance,  and  to  make  decisions  on  how 
to  cope  with  incoming  stimuli  or  stressors  (Gianaros  et  al., 
2007;  Kim  et  al.,  2015).  It  also  weakens  memory  and  learning 
processes,  which  are  indispensable  for  achievements  in  the 
working  environment.

Stress and Amygdala
The  amygdala  enhances  the  secretion  of  glucocorticoid  in 
response to stress and suffers stress-induced changes in neuron 
cytoarchitecture  (Hölzel  et  al.,  2010).  Unlike  the  prefrontal 
cortex and the hippocampus, dendritic arborizations and spines 
of  neurons  in  the  amygdala  are  increased  by  stress.  It  has 
been  proposed  that  these  changes  are  the  mechanisms  that 
underlie  stress-associated  anxiety  disorder,  among  others.

One  of  the  amygdala’s  functions  in  processing  stressors  is 
to  rapidly  assign  emotional  significance  to  events  in  the 
environment  and  is  therefore  believed  to  be  involved  in 
coordinating  the  behavioral  changes  induced  by  stressors, 
especially  when  faced  with  adverse  environmental  conditions 
and  stressors  that  have  a  negative  effect  on  health  (Gianaros 
et  al.,  2007;  McEwen  and  Gianaros,  2010;  McEwen  and 
Wingfield,  2010).

THE  IMPACT  OF  MBIS:  A 
NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL  POINT  OF 
VIEW

Mindfulness  is  a  mental  practice  that  has  been  described  as 
a  “systematic  form  of  mental  training”  which  impacts  on 
multiple  affective  domains  and  cognitive  functions  (Gill  et  al., 
2020).  The  following  sections  will  be  devoted  to  describing 
the  main  findings  on  how  MBIs  influence  affective  domains 
and  cognitive  processes,  and  the  areas  in  the  brain  responsible 
for  these  functions  (Figure  2).

Influence of Mindfulness on Attention and 
Executive Functions
attention 
Reviews  generally 
improvement (Chiesa and Serretti, 2011; Tang et al., 2015). From 
a theoretical viewpoint, attention is generally regarded as a central 
aspect of mindfulness that has an impact on various characteristics 
as  a  neuropsychological  construct  (Hölzel  et  al.,  2011;  Vago  and 

associate  mindfulness  with 

Silbersweig, 2012). For instance, moment-to-moment application, 
and  sustainment  and  redirection  (in  the  event  of  distraction) 
of attention to a target object are typically involved in mindfulness 
meditation  (Tang  et  al.,  2016).  Trait-like  changes  in  attentional 
brain  networks  have  been  observed  to  result  from  consistent 
practice over time; these networks apparently constitute a neural 
mechanism through which the abilities developed during training 
transfer  into  everyday  life  (Hasenkamp  and  Barsalou,  2012; 
Hasenkamp  et  al.,  2012).

To  be  more  specific,  three  distinct  but  interrelated  networks 
are often attributed to attention (Posner, 2012): (i) alerting, defined 
as  preparing  for  an  impending  stimulus;  (ii)  orienting,  defined 
as  targeting  specific  sensory  input  selectively  based  on  modality 
or  location;  and  (iii)  executive  attention  (conflict  monitoring), 
defined  as  monitoring  task-relevant  stimuli  in  a  goal-directed 
manner  while  surrounded  by  competing  task-irrelevant  stimuli.
Short-term training studies have not shown significant effects 
on alerting (Jha et al., 2015) while intensive meditative experience 
and long-term mindfulness training do seem to improve alerting 
(MacLean  et  al.,  2010).  On  the  other  hand,  improvements  in

orienting have been reported after short- and long-term training 
studies (Jha et al., 2007; MacLean et al., 2010). Studies concerning 
the  relationship  between  mindfulness  and  executive  attention 
have  shown  that  there  was  a  relationship  between  higher  trait 
mindfulness  and  lower  interference  in  accuracy  and  reaction 
time,  in  keeping  with  enhanced  executive  attention  (Smart 
and Segalowitz, 2017; Lin et al., 2019). However, these findings 
are  as  yet  inconclusive  and  require  further  study  (MacCoon 
et  al.,  2014).

What  is  more,  there  is  increasing  evidence  that  attentional 
processes  play  a  critical  role  in  supporting  successful  working 
memory  (WM),  one  of  the  PFC’s  main  functions  (Gazzaley 
and  Nobre,  2012).  Encoding  requires  selective  attention  to 
focus.  Reflective  attentional  resources  must  “refresh”  memory 
traces  over  the  maintenance  interval  for  encoded  information 
to  be  successfully  maintained  (Shipstead  et  al.,  2012;  Camos 
et  al.,  2019).  Refreshing  involves  enhancing,  prolonging,  and 
strengthening  the  representations  of  task-relevant  data  being 
held  in  WM.  Memory  traces  may  become  unstable  without 
refreshing,  which  leads  to  WM  failures.  Maintaining  WM  also 

requires  attentional  disengagement  to  ensure  that  distracting 
or  obsolete  information  is  removed  from  capacity-limited  WM 
storage  as  it  is  no  longer  task-relevant  (Shipstead  et  al.,  2016; 
Lewis-Peacock  et  al.,  2018).

The  effects  of  meditation  in  brain  areas  related  to  attentional 
control and executive attention have also been found in a number 
of  neuroimaging  studies.  One  of  the  brain  regions  most  widely 
mentioned  in  relation  to  these  effects  is  the  anterior  cingulate 
cortex  (ACC).  This  region  contributes  to  executive  attentional 
functions  by  detecting  a  cognitive  conflict  and  alerting  the 
dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex  (DLPFC),  a  top-down-regulated 
system,  to  resolve  the  conflict  (Sridharan  et  al.,  2008).  Earlier 
studies  have  suggested  that  the  stages  of  meditation  practice—
early,  intermediate,  and  advanced—affect  the  change  in  brain 
activation levels and showed a quadratic relationship (Tang et al., 
2015).  A  different  amount  of  effort  is  required  at  each  stage  to 
exercise  self-regulation,  inducing  different  levels  of  activation  in 
the  brain.  The  participant  needs  to  exert  effortful  control  to 
stay  engaged  in  the  early  stage  of  meditation,  with  increased 
activation  in  lateral  PFC  and  the  ACC  (Tomasino  and  Fabbro, 

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 854204

González-Palau and Medrano Stress and Mindfulness2016).  Next,  somewhat  less  effort  is  required  in  the  intermediate 
stage to reduce mind-wandering, while little or no effort is needed 
in the advanced stage. Participants with higher levels of meditation 
expertise  therefore  show  less  activation  in  the  brain  areas  that 
had shown increased activation in the early stage (Kwak et al., 2020).
Moreover,  as  a  consequence  of  the  increase  in  the  dorsolateral 
prefrontal  cortex,  there  is  a  reorganization  of  the  networks  in 
which  it  is  involved,  among  which  the  frontolimbic  network, 
which  mediates  emotional  regulation,  stands  out.  One  of  the 
physiological  mechanisms  that  supports  the  hypothesis  that  the 
practice  of  mindfulness  improves  attention  function  is  based  on 
the  increase  in  α  oscillations,  a  neuronal  rhythm  in  which  cells 
emit  action  potentials  at  a  frequency  of  about  8–12  shots  per 
second  (Diez  and  Castellanos,  2022).  As  Jensen  and  Mazaheri 
(2010)  emphasize,  α  oscillations  do  not  represent  a  brain  state 
or a state of relaxation, but rather a specific inhibition that prevents 
internal interference and enhances top-down control mechanisms, 
which are key to the execution of a task requiring focused attention. 
The α oscillations therefore reflect the priority of the information, 
inhibiting  the  areas  with  irrelevant  tasks  at  that  moment.

For  organizations,  an  important  aspect  concerns  how  MBI 
exercises  can  train  workers’  attention  and  WM  processes. 
Cognitive training perspectives suggest that cognitive processes 
engaged by a particular activity can be strengthened by engaging 
repeatedly  in  the  activity  (Clare  et  al.,  2003;  Simons  et  al., 
2016).  In  line  with  this  research,  the  content  of  the  formal 
exercises  typical  of  MBI  programs  takes  on  greater  relevance. 
Among  these  exercises,  we  find  focused  attention  (FA),  open 
monitoring (OM), yoga movements, and body scanned exercises 
(Lutz  et  al.,  2015).  While  doing  them,  the  individual  wilfully 
decides  that  for  an  uninterrupted  period  of  time  they  will  fix 
their attention on the mindful exercise. In this way, the exercises 
require  the  individual  to  maintain  the  task  set  in  WM,  as  
the  specific  instructions  to  be  engaged  in  for  the  practice 
period  are  held  in  mind  (Lutz  et  al.,  2015).  The  different 
studies  conducted  to  investigate  this  hypothesis  have  yielded 
positive  results  (Black  et  al.,  2011;  Quach  et  al.,  2016;  Course- 
Choi  et  al.,  2017).

Although the impact of mindfulness on attention and executive 
functions (as described above) has been analyzed by numerous 
researchers,  there  is  as  yet  no  conclusive  evidence.  Lao  et  al. 
(2016), for example, focused on 18 controlled trials of Mindfulness 
Based Cognitive Therapy and Stress Reduction programs (MBCT 
and  MBSR)  and  were  unable  to  find  any  significant  evidence 
of  improvement  in  attention.  All  that  was  found  is  preliminary 
evidence of improvement in working memory, cognitive flexibility, 
and  meta-awareness.  Because  these  cognitive  functions  are 
important  in  workplaces  and  organizations,  MBIs  in  these 
cognitive  functions  needs  considerable  research  in  order  to 
analyze  the  benefits  for  different  work  settings.

Influence of Mindfulness on Memory and 
Learning Processes
Recent  work  with  mindfulness  indicates  that  its  practice  
can  positively  affect  verbal  learning  and  memory.  Increased 
attention may be a potential explanation for this improvements. 

Mindfulness  may  have  an  impact  on  autobiographical  memory 
by  training  individuals  to  be  attentive  to  particular  aspects  of 
their  experiences,  promoting  greater  accuracy  in  encoding  and 
retrieval, which improves specific memory (Heeren et al., 2009). 
Other  studies  have  proposed  that  improvements  in  verbal 
learning  and  memory  may  result  from  mindfulness  via  its 
effect  on  the  encoding  process  of  learning  rather  than  altering 
attention  (Lueke  and  Lueke,  2019).  For  example,  some  studies 
showed  that  mindfulness  can  help  to  reduce  mind-wandering 
(Killingsworth  and  Gilbert,  2010)  and  proactive  interference 
(Greenberg  et  al.,  2019).  Although  mindfulness  may  help  free 
up  cognitive  resources  required  for  peak  verbal  learning  and 
memory  performance  that  would  otherwise  be  engaged  in 
task-unrelated  thoughts,  the  evidence  and  findings,  though  as 
yet  preliminary,  are  promising  (Lao  et  al.,  2016).

Neuroimaging  studies  have  provided  researchers  with  more 
data  on  this  issue,  as  there  is  documented  evidence  of  the 
impact  of  mindfulness  training  on  the  structure  of  the 
hippocampus.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  studies  of 
8-week  mindfulness  training  programs  have  shown  increases 
in the density of hippocampal grey matter in healthy individuals 
(Hölzel  et  al.,  2011)  as  well  as  a  reduction  in  hippocampal 
atrophy  in  adults  with  mild  cognitive  impairment  (Wells  et  al., 
2013) after training. Cross-sectional studies support these results 
after mindfulness training, indicating greater hippocampal grey 
matter  among 
in  comparison  with 
non-meditators  (Luders  et  al.,  2013,  2015).

long-term  meditators 

The Impacts of Mindfulness on Perceived 
Stress and Emotional Regulation
It  has  been  shown  that  mindfulness  meditation  facilitates 
emotional regulation and attention self-regulation (Kabat-Zinn, 
2019).  Earlier  studies  (Arredondo  et  al.,  2017;  Heckenberg 
et  al.,  2018)  had  pointed  out  how  implementing  the  practice 
of  mindfulness  can  reduce  harmful  physiological  effects  on 
health  by  acting  on  the  conscious  evaluation  of  stimuli  and 
by  grading  the  reaction  to  them,  since  these  stimuli  would 
not  automatically  be  considered  a  threat.  Along  similar  lines, 
Feldman et al. (2007) found that there was a strong correlation 
between  personal  mindfulness  reports  and  self-reported  use 
of  adaptive  emotional  regulation  strategies.  MBIs  are  also 
effective  in  increasing  high  and  low  diurnal  cortisol  slopes, 
which  suggests  an 
improvement  in  HPA  axis  regulation 
(Heckenberg  et  al.,  2018).

Nevertheless, there is still debate as to the exact relationship 
between  mindfulness  and  emotional  regulation.  Some  authors 
claim that consciousness without judgment, typical of mindfulness 
practices, facilitates a healthy relationship with emotions (Hayes 
and  Feldman,  2004),  making  it  possible  for  people  to  fully 
experience  and  express  their  emotions  (Bridges  et  al.,  2004), 
helping  to  reduce  mechanisms  like  avoidance,  suppression  or 
over  identification  with  emotions,  which  produce  anxiety 
or  rumination.

These  data  are  supplemented  by  neuroimaging  studies.  Kral 
et  al.  (2018),  for  example,  evaluated  the  impact  of  training  in 
long-  and  short-term  mindfulness  meditation  on  how  the

adult population using functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
The authors conclude that affective responding can be improved 
by  meditation  training  through  heightened  amygdala–PFC 
connectivity  and  reduced  amygdala  reactivity,  as  this  has  a 
salutary  effect  on  the  ability  to  regulate  emotions  (Banks  et  al., 
2007;  Lee  et  al.,  2017).

The  impact  of  MBIs  on  emotional  regulation  is  crucial  for 
organizations  and,  according  to  the  literature,  mindfulness 
interventions  are  a  useful  resource  that  favor  improvements 
in  employee  health.  For  example,  previous  studies  claim  that 
mindfulness can raise awareness of early warning signs of stress 
prior  to  it  becoming  unmanageable  and  that  it  also  provides 
tools  to  offset  the  negative  effects  of  stress  on  wellbeing  and 
job performance (Christopher et al., 2018). Other authors have 
put  their  focus  on  the  resilience  building  qualities  that  
can  protect  workers  from  adverse  outcomes  and  help  them 
develop  in  a  complex  and  rapidly  changing  work  environment  
(Kinman  et  al.,  2020).

Other Key Brain Areas and Mechanism in 
MBI: Interoception and Insula
Another  essential  point  in  MBI  research  is  the  relationship 
between interoceptive awareness and mindfulness and the insula, 
its neurobiological brain area (Sharp et al., 2018; Gibson, 2019). 
Recent studies indicate that interoception is crucial to mindfulness 
and  that  some  of  its  benefits  are  better  described  as  resulting 
from  changes  in  neuroplasticity  in  the  insula  (Sharp  et  al., 
2018) and the neural circuits surrounding it, which can promote 
dispositional  conscious  attention  (Gibson,  2019).

Interoceptive  learning  is  believed  to  be  a  complex  process 
that  can  be  accomplished  using  MBI  (Gotink  et  al.,  2016). 
Most  meditation  traditions  are  known  to  incorporate  attention 
to  internal  body  sensations  as  part  of  the  practice,  especially 
in the early stages of the learning process. The body sensations 
most  commonly  focused  on  are  the  breath,  the  position  of 
the  joints  (proprioception),  the  degree  of  muscle  tension,  and 
heartbeat.  It  has  been  suggested  that  attending  to  interoceptive 
sensations can result in improved awareness of these sensations, 
and  that  practizing  meditation  leads  to  enhanced  awareness 
of  a  number  of  other  internal  events,  as  among  them  the 
ongoing experience of thoughts and emotions (Allen et al., 2012).

Mindfulness  has  grown  considerably  in  popularity,  but 
so  have  misconceptions  regarding  what  it  is  and  how  both 
the  mind  and  the  brain  are  affected.  As  Wielgosz  et  al. 
(2019)  points  out,  the  popularity  of  the  MBI  has  generated 
increasingly  ambitious  claims  about  its  clinical  benefits  that 
are not always supported by scientific data, generating inflated 
expectations  and  leading  to  this  type  of  intervention  being 
prematurely  deployed  in  contexts  where  it  has  not  been 
sufficiently  tested.

Moreover,  despite  the  fact  that  most  mindfulness  training 
derives  from  the  original  MBI  model  (Kabat-Zinn,  1994),  key 
variations, such as duration of practice (total engagement time) 
and  intensity  (hours  per  day),  are  often  overlooked.  This  leads 
to inappropriate comparisons and non-generalizable conclusions. 
For  this  reason,  and  for  MBIs  to  be  considered  credible  and 
evidence-based  interventions,  we  first  suggest  conceptualizing 
MBIs not as a particular technique, but as a family of practices 
in 
targeting  multiple  neurobehavioral 
psychopathology.  This  family  of  practices  should  be  linked  to 
clear  standards  (form  of  implementation,  required  training, 
fidelity, and cross-cultural adaptation) that guarantee the safety 
and  efficacy  of  the  intervention.  For  this,  it  is  important  to 
know  precisely  which  mechanisms  are  involved  in  MBI.

involved 

systems 

It 

is 

important 

to  communicate  new  findings 

from 
contemplative  neuroscience  about  the  brain  mechanisms  and 
mental  processes  of  mindfulness  practices  with  corresponding 
modesty  (Van  Dam  et  al.,  2018).  A  deeper  understanding  of 
what  the  effects  of  the  MBI  are,  the  mechanisms  involved, 
and  the  circumstances  in  which  it  can  be  applied  will  make 
it  possible  to  determine  more  clearly  the  implementation  rules 
that  will  guarantee  the  desired  effects.

It  is  necessary  for  future  studies  to  continue  to  examine 
the  psychological  and  neurocognitive  benefits  of  MBIs  in  the 
workplace. For example, from a neuropsychological perspective, 
how  is  it  that  mindfulness  impacts  on  different  functions  and 
not  just  the  trained  cognitive  function?  Although  a  greater 
understanding  of  the  mechanisms  involved  is  required,  we  can 
affirm  that  MBI  is  considered  to  be  an  efficient,  effective,  and 
low-cost  resource  for  the  reduction  of  work  stress,  making  it 
possible  to  model  employers’  and  employees’  performance 
(Jamieson  and  Tuckey,  2017)  and  thus  improve  their  main 
work  abilities,  cognitive  functions,  and  mental  health,  leading 
to significant benefits for organizations (Arredondo et al., 2017).

DISCUSSION

AUTHOR  CONTRIBUTIONS

The  purpose  of  this  mini-review  is  to  examine  what  cognitive 
abilities and psychological variables are enhanced with MBIs and 
their  association  with  those  impaired  by  chronic  stress,  focusing 
mainly  on  how  organizations  benefit  from  MBIs.  Unexpectedly, 
existing  studies  that  investigate  the  neuropsychological  impact 
of  MBIs  on  cognitive  functions  of  samples  taken  from  such 
work  environments  were 
those 
concerning  the  impact  stress  has  on  cognition  and  the  benefits 
of  MBIs  in  employers’  and  employees’  brain  functions  are 
undoubtedly  promising.
