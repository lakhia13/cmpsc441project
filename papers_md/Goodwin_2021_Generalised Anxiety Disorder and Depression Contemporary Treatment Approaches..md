Key Summary Points

Why carry out this review?

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and
major depressive disorder (MDD) form
part of a large group of prevalent
psychiatric disorders, and are frequently
comorbid.

These manuscripts describe presentations
from a virtual symposium titled ‘‘GAD and
Depression: Contemporary Treatment
Approaches’’ as part of the Industry
Science Exchange sessions that took place
as at the European College of
Neuropsychopharmacology 33rd
Congress in September 2020.

What was learned from the review?

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors are considered ﬁrst-line therapy
in patients with GAD, but agents with a
different mechanism of action may also be
considered in those who do not respond
to or tolerate these therapies.

Patients with MDD with symptoms of
GAD, also referred to as anxious
depression, should be managed with an
antidepressant that has anti-anxiety
effects.

Greater recognition of anxious depression
is needed as this condition is often
accompanied by increased suicidality and
the need for more robust treatment.

EDITORIAL

Anxiety and depression form a large group of
interrelated, overlapping psychiatric disorders
whose precise taxonomy and terminology can
at ﬁrst be confusing. In this supplement, we will
mainly discuss generalised anxiety disorder
(GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and
anxious depression. Figure 1 shows how GAD

and MDD ﬁt into the overall disease classiﬁca-
tions of anxiety and depressive disorders, as
deﬁned in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition; commonly
referred to as DSM-5) [1].

Current diagnostic criteria for GAD and
MDD are shown in Table 1. GAD and MDD are
prevalent, debilitating illnesses that frequently
coexist [2]. In severe cases, GAD may be asso-
ciated with disabling symptoms, social and
occupational impairment, an increased risk of
suicidality, and reportedly low rates of treat-
ment response [3, 4]. In patients with a major
depressive episode, coexisting symptoms of
anxiety (or ‘anxious depression’) increase the
severity of depression, worsen functional
impairment, reduce quality of life, and add to
the economic burden [5]. Although there are
now effective treatments
for GAD, many
patients do not respond, are unable to tolerate
them, or experience discontinuation symptoms
when treatment is stopped [6]. Additionally,
there are effective treatments
for anxious
depression, but these have been less thoroughly
researched [7].

At a population level, the burden of human
disease (or ‘health loss’) can be measured in
terms of disability adjusted life-years (DALYs).
The total number of DALYs for a given popula-
tion has two components: premature death,
which is quantiﬁed as the number of years of
life lost due to disease or injury; and morbidity,
which is quantiﬁed as the number of years lived
with disability (YLD) [8]. YLD is particularly
relevant to mental illnesses such as GAD and
MDD. Data from the Global Burden of Disease
Study 2019 show that the societal impact of
anxiety and depression is extremely high, in
both absolute and relative terms. Both disorders
are associated with very signiﬁcant global
health losses, predominantly due to high
numbers of associated YLDs (Table 2) [9, 10].
Importantly,
these losses are seen globally,
occurring in low- and middle-income countries,
as well as in wealthier nations [10]. Moreover,
both disorders are prominent contributors to
global DALYs among adults of working age [9], a
ﬁnding with
socioeconomic
considerable
implications. In the USA, MDD was the second-
largest contributor to YLDs in 2010, while

attributable to depression and anxiety remained
relatively stable between 1990 and 2019 [10];
this is despite considerable ongoing research,
the availability of numerous effective pharma-
cotherapies, and the growth and diversiﬁcation
of psychological treatment options.

psychiatry

Traditionally,

has
clinical
emphasised treatment rather than prevention
and focused on manifestations rather than
causes. Moving forward, should psychiatry shift
its focus to identifying at-risk individuals and
intervening earlier, with the objectives of pre-
venting illness or reducing its severity and
duration? Screening for at-risk individuals or
possible causes of GAD (e.g. excessive perceived
threat), as well as symptoms and signs of GAD
in patients with or without MDD, could form
part of such a strategy, given that GAD often

has earlier onset than MDD and may increase
vulnerability to developing MDD. Additionally,
there is growing interest and research into the
neurobiological mechanisms of GAD, which
may ultimately allow for the development of
targeted treatments. Evolutionary medicine
may also offer clues as to how we approach GAD
and MDD in the future, e.g. by viewing anxiety
and depression as adaptive responses to partic-
ular circumstances, which may at times be
excessive, analogous
to the current under-
standing of allergies based on adaptive immune
responses, which at times are disproportionate.
For now, we have effective pharmacothera-
pies both for GAD and for anxiety associated
with MDD. In both conditions, treatment has
the potential to decrease or relieve symptoms,
improve or restore functioning, and increase
health-related quality of life. From a public
health point of view, the cost-effectiveness of

generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder [1]

Generalised anxiety disorder

Major depressive disorder

All the features listed below must be present in order to make a

At least ﬁve of the following symptoms must be

diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder

present nearly every day during a 2-week period:

Excessive anxiety and worry about various events have occurred
more days than not for at least 6 months

The person ﬁnds it difﬁcult to control the worry

The anxiety and worry are associated with at least three of the
following six symptoms (only one symptom is required in
children):

Restlessness or a feeling of being keyed up or ‘on edge’

Core symptoms (C 1 required for diagnosis):

Depressed mood most of the day

Anhedonia or markedly decreased interest or
pleasure in almost all activities

Additional symptoms:

Clinically signiﬁcant weight loss or increase or
decrease in appetite

Being easily fatigued

Having difﬁculty concentrating

Irritability

Muscle tension

Sleep disturbance

Insomnia or hypersomnia

Psychomotor agitation or retardation

Fatigue or loss of energy

Feelings of worthlessness, or excessive or
inappropriate guilt

The anxiety, worry, or associated physical symptoms cause
clinically signiﬁcant distress or impairment in important areas of
functioning

Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or
indecisiveness

Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation

The disturbance is not due to the physiological effects of a
substance or medical condition

The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental
disorder

The symptoms cause clinically signiﬁcant distress or
impairment in functioning

Symptoms are not due to a medical/organic factor or
illness

treatments
for GAD and MDD is worth
emphasising. In this supplement, we review the
evidence base that supports treatments for GAD
in 2021—both pharmacological and non-phar-
macological—with a particular focus on recent

meta-analyses and emerging treatments. We
will also explore how our understanding of the
relationship between anxiety and depression
has evolved, and summarise current best prac-
tice in the management of anxious depression.
