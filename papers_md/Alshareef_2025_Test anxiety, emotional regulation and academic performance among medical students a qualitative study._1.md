ABSTRACT
Medical  school  can  be  a  difficult  and  emotionally  turbulent  experience  for  students.  Test 
anxiety  is  very  common  among  medical  students  and  may  impact  their  academic  perfor-
mance. However, there is a lack of qualitative studies on test anxiety and emotion regulation 
in relation to the academic performance of medical students. This study aims to examine the 
relationship  between  test  anxiety  and  academic  performance  among  medical  students, 
exploring  the  role  of  emotion  regulation  and  coping  strategies  in  managing  test  anxiety 
during examinations. The study involved 22 medical students from one Saudi medical school 
who participated in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were recorded and transcribed 
verbatim.  A  thematic  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  transcribed  data,  resulting  in  the 
identification  of  four  key  themes.  The  emerging  themes  are  test  anxiety,  academic  perfor-
mance,  emotion  regulation,  and  other  coping  strategies.  Students’  anxiety  can  vary  from 
a  source  of  motivation  to  a  severe  obstacle.  It  impacts  their  theoretical  understanding, 
practical  abilities,  and  the  evaluation  criteria  used  to  assess  academic  achievement. 
However,  some  students  use  both  adaptive  and  maladaptive  emotion  regulation  strategies. 
Promoting  emotion  regulation  and  various  coping  mechanisms  to  address  test  anxiety  in 
medical  students  is  essential  to  enhance  their  academic  performance  and  prepare  them  for 
future  healthcare  professions.

Introduction

Medical  students  often  face  intense  emotional  chal-
lenges due to their education’s high stakes and compe-
titive nature. The pressure to excel academically, retain 
vast  amounts  of  information,  and  perform  well  in 
exams  can  lead  to  significant  levels  of  test  anxiety. 
Test anxiety is a specific form of anxiety that occurs in 
evaluative  situations,  particularly  during  exams.  It 
involves  physiological  symptoms  such  as  increased 
heart rate and sweating, cognitive symptoms like nega-
tive thoughts and fear of failure, and behavioural symp-
toms such as avoidance [1,2]. Evidence shows that test 
anxiety affects more than 50% of medical students [3,4]. 
Test anxiety can lead to depression, poor management 
of  workload,  insufficient  study  preparation,  mood 
instability  and  lower  student  self-esteem  in  their  aca-
demic  ability  [5–7].  Moreover,  several  research  found 
that  test  anxiety  has  a  negative  relationship  with  aca-
demic performance [8–10].

Academic  performance  refers  to  the  measurable 
outcomes  of  a  student’s  learning  process,  including 
grades, exam scores, and overall academic standing. It 
is  a  crucial  indicator  of  a  student’s  success  and  pro-
ficiency  in  their  studies  [11].

Emotion regulation involves how individuals influ-
ence their emotions, how they experience and express 
these  emotions,  and  how  they  manage  them  in  var-
ious situations. Effective emotion regulation strategies 
can  mitigate  the  adverse  effects  of  negative  emotions 
and  enhance  coping  mechanisms [12].

Coping  mechanisms  are  the  strategies  and  beha-
viours that individuals use to manage stress and emo-
tional challenges. These can include problem-focused 
coping, which involves tackling the problem directly, 
and  emotion-focused  coping,  which  involves  mana-
ging  the  emotional  response  to  the  problem [13].

Despite  extensive  research  on  test  anxiety  and  its 
effects  on  academic  performance,  there  is  a  scarcity  of 
qualitative  studies  investigating  how  medical  students 
experience  and  manage  these  emotions  during  exam 
periods  and  their  influence  on  academic  outcomes. 
Much of the existing research originates from Western, 
individualistic  contexts,  where  practical  solutions  often 
focus on external techniques, such as relaxation exercises 
or animal therapy [14]. These approaches may not align 
with  the  cultural  norms  and  expectations  in  Saudi 
Arabia. This gap is particularly pronounced in collectivist 
cultures,  such  as  in  Saudi  Arabia,  where  familial  and 
community  expectations  significantly  shape  students’

experiences  of  anxiety.  In  these  contexts,  cultural  pres-
sures  to  uphold  family  honour  and  meet  societal  stan-
dards  exacerbate  stress,  especially  in  demanding  fields 
like  medicine  [15].  Collectivist  values  may  also  discou-
rage  seeking  external  psychological  help  due  to  stigma 
and potential repercussions for family reputation, leading 
students to adopt internal coping mechanisms and cul-
turally  specific  strategies  [15].  This  study  aims  to  delve 
into the experiences of medical students with test anxiety 
in a collectivist setting, examining their emotional man-
agement techniques during exams and the implications 
for their academic performance and coping strategies.

Materials  and  methods

Research  design

This  study  adopts  a  phenomenological  research 
approach,  which  aims  to  explore  and  understand  the 
lived experiences of individuals [16]. Phenomenology is 
well-suited  for  investigating  how  medical  students 
experience test anxiety, manage their emotions during 
examinations,  and  navigate  coping  mechanisms  [16]. 
This approach aligns with the study’s qualitative nature, 
emphasising  capturing  the  essence  of  participants’ 
experiences.  By  focusing  on  students’  narratives,  this 
study  seeks  to  uncover  the  meaning  they  ascribe  to 
their  experiences,  providing  deeper  insights  into  the 
interplay  between  test  anxiety,  emotion  regulation, 
and academic performance.

Participants  and  context

Twenty-two  medical  students  from  a  Saudi  medical 
school  were  invited  to  participate  in  the  study.  The 
medical  school  6-year  program  starts  with 
the 
foundation year, the second and third years are precli-
nical, and the fourth are clinical years. Participants were 
included  in  the  study  if  they  met  all  the  following 
criteria:  they  were  current  medical  students  of  any 
academic  year  and  gender,  and  they  were  willing  to 
participate in a semi-structured interview. Participants 
were  selected  through  purposive  sampling  to  ensure 
a diverse representation of gender, academic year, and 
academic  performance.  All  students  who  were  invited 
to  participate  were  given  the  opportunity  to  consent, 
and only those who agreed to take part were included in 
the study. Data saturation determined the study’s sam-
ple  size  because  interviewing  more  people  would  not 
reveal  new  themes  or  codes  during  data  analysis. 
Table  1  illustrates  the  demographic  characteristics  of 
interviewed medical students.

The first researcher, Nora Alshareef, is a PhD can-
didate  at  Lancaster  University,  holding  a  Bachelor’s 
degree  in  Medicine  and  a  Master’s  in  Medical 
Education.  This  research  was  part  of  her  PhD  study, 
In  addition  to  her  doctoral  work,  she  worked  as 
a  lecturer  at  the  medical  school  where  the  study 
participants were enrolled. However, she did not per-
sonally  know the  participants  before  the  study.

who  were  involved  in  obtaining  ethical  approval, 
contributing  to  data  analysis,  and  reviewing  the 
results  and  discussion  sections.

Data  collection  instruments

Data  were  collected  in  the  second  semester  of  the 
2023/2024  academic  year  using  semi-structured 
interviews  guided  by  an  interview  protocol  devel-
oped  by  the  researchers  based  on  a  review  of  rele-
vant  literature  on  test  anxiety,  emotion  regulation, 
and  coping  mechanisms.  The  protocol  included 
open-ended  questions  designed  to  elicit  detailed 
responses about the student’s medical school experi-
ences  with  test  anxiety,  the  effect  of  test  anxiety  on 
their academic performance, and the use of emotion 
regulation  strategies  and  coping  mechanisms.  The 
sequence  of  questions  was  flexible,  adjusting  in 
response  to  the  participants’  answers  (the  interview 
questions  are shown in  appendix 1). This adaptabil-
ity  ensured  that  the  conversations  unfolded  natu-
rally,  facilitating  a  deeper  investigation  into  the 
aspects  of  test  anxiety  deemed  most  critical  by  the 
students.

Procedure

Participants  were  contacted  via  email  and  invited  to 
participate in the study. Interviews were scheduled at 
convenient  times  for  the  participants  and  conducted 
in  a  quiet,  private  setting  within  the  university  cam-
pus. The interviews lasted between 41 and 90 minutes 
and  were  audio-recorded  with  the  participant’s  con-
sent. All participants provided written informed con-
sent  before  the  interview.

Data  analysis

Interviews  were  transcribed  verbatim  and  analysed 
using  hybrid  thematic  analysis  [17]  (inductive  and 
deductive  approach).  The  deductive  approach  prede-
termines  the  themes  based  on  the  research  question 
and  the  literature,  while  the  inductive  approach 
allows  new  themes  to  emerge.  Consistent  with  the 
recommendations  by  Braun  and  Clarke  (2006),  we 
adhered  to  a  structured  six-step  process,  providing 
a  systematic  approach  to  coding  and  theme  develop-
ment and ensuring that the analysis remains rigorous 
and transparent. Each step is clearly defined, allowing 
for a thorough and unbiased examination of the data. 
First, the researchers became familiar with the data by 
thoroughly reading it to generate initial thoughts and 
ideas. Next, initial codes were generated by categoris-
ing the data to align with the research objectives. The 
third step involved searching for themes by grouping 
similar  codes.  These  themes  were  then  reviewed  to

ensure  they  were  distinct  and  non-redundant.  Each 
theme was subsequently defined and given a reflective 
name.  Table  2  illustrates  the  identfied  themes,  sub-
themes and codes. Finally, the analysis culminated in 
producing a report that detailed the results and linked 
them  to  the  research  objectives.  It  is  important  to 
note  that  these  steps  were  applied  in  a  flexible,  non- 
linear manner, allowing the researchers to move back 
and forth between stages as required by the analytical 
needs  of  the  study.  The  researchers  independently 
coded  the  transcripts  and  then  met  to  discuss  and 
refine the themes. Four major themes were identified: 
test  anxiety,  the  impact  of  anxiety  on  academic  per-
formance,  emotion  regulation  strategies,  and  other 
coping mechanisms.

Finding  rigour

We used the Guba and Lincoln criteria [18] to ensure the 
study  methodology’s  rigour.  First,  member-checking 
involved  summing  participants’  interview  ideas  and 
returning  their  transcripts,  which  could  improve  the 
credibility  of  the  data  analysis  transcriptions.  The  tran-
scripts were returned to the participants for feedback, but 
they  did  not  respond.  Second,  the  study’s  environment 
and participants were described to improve the transfer-
ability of our findings to readers’ circumstances. Finally, 
we detailed our data collection and analysis openly and 
accurately  to  enable  future  replication  and  review  of 
research conclusions.

Ethical  considerations

The  Saudi  Medical  School’s  Institutional  Review 
Board  (reference  no.  641–21)  approved  the  study. 
All participants provided written and verbal informed 
consent  and  were  assured  of  the  confidentiality  of 
their  responses.  To  protect  participants’  identities, 
pseudonyms  were  used  in  the  transcripts.

The  results

Test  anxiety

Most  medical  students  suffer  greatly  from  test  anxi-
ety,  which  can  cause  a  range  of  mental  and  physical 
symptoms  that  affect  not  just  their  academic  perfor-
mance  but  also  their  general  well-being.  Test  anxiety 
affects students  before, during,  and  after  exams.

Anxiety  before  exams

Before  exams,  medical  students  often  experience 
heightened  levels  of  anxiety,  which  manifest  in  both 
emotional  and  physical  symptoms.  This  period  of 
anxiety  can  begin  weeks  in  advance,  significantly 
affecting  their  ability  to  prepare  and  perform.  This

Example
If  I  have  an  exam  on  Thursday,  I  will  feel  worried  and  anxious  starting  Sunday
I  start  feeling  the  stress  weeks  before  the  exams.  My  shoulders  and  chest  get  so 

tight  that  it  is  hard  to  focus  on  studying.

Before  exam  day,  when  I  cannot  sleep,  I  start  to  feel  stressed.
During  the  exam,  I  feel  nausea  and  pain.

I  feel  mentally  burned  out  after  exams;  even  simple  tasks  seem  overwhelming
I  replay  the  questions  in  my  head,  dwelling  on  what  I  could  have  answered 

incorrectly.

Anxiety  is  the  reason  I  failed  the  exam.

I  remember  feeling  worried  when  I  drew  blood  from  a  patient  for  the  first  time; 

I  was  afraid  to  hurt  the  patient.

I  was  so  nervous  going  into  the  anatomy  exam  that  I  forgot  everything.  It  was 

my  second  year,  and  I  could  not  solve  it.  In  the  end,  my  test  score  was  below 
60,  and  I  had  to  retake  the  subject  in  the  summer.

All  I  think  about  is  increasing  my  GPA;  it  makes  me  anxious.
I  feel  nervous  when  I  take  a  clinical  history  from  the  patients.

Whenever  I  start  thinking  negatively,  I  remind  myself  about  my  dream  to  be 

a  good  doctor.

I choose not to share my burdens with my mom; she is already carrying enough of 

her  own.

I also attempted to study in six different ways until I figured out the most effective 

way  to  study,  and  that  relieved  my  test  anxiety.

Every  Saturday,  I  spend  an  hour  planning  my  week.  It  keeps  me  on  track  with  my 

studies  and  exams  and  manages  my  stress.

I  go  to  my  mum.  She  sits  with  me  and  tries  to  calm  me.  She  is  always  saying  to 

me,  ‘Everything  will  be  OK’.

After  discussing  my  fears  with  my  professor,  she  pointed  me  towards  additional 

resources  and  study  groups  that  helped  with  my  exam  worries.

Going  to  the  gym  regularly  helps  me  manage  my  test  anxiety.  Physical  exercise 
keeps  me  fit  and  clears  my  mind;  it  helps  me  to  focus  and  stay  calm  during 
exams.

black, and I started seeing darkness; I could not see my 
screen.  At  that  time,  I  was  thinking  whether  to  leave 
medicine or not. (M4) 

Emotional  reaction
Emotional  reactions  to  upcoming  exams  are  common 
among  medical students.  These emotions  often include 
intense feelings of anxiety, fear and dread. The following 
quotes from students illustrate these emotional responses: 
Some  students  experience  test  anxiety  just  a  few  days 
before the exam, while others start to feel anxious weeks 
in advance. Many students fear that they will forget every-
thing they have studied once they face the exam.

Every  time  an  exam  comes  up,  I  get  really  scared. 
I  am  afraid  that  no  matter  how  hard  I  study,  I  will 
the  test  comes 
not  remember  anything  when 
around.  (M8) 

I  started  feeling  worried  and  anxious  the  week 

before  the  exam.  (F9) 

Weeks before the exam, anxiety begins to mount. 
It  is  persistent  and  disruptive,  making  it  difficult  to 
unwind  or  concentrate.  (M6) 

M5,  a  sixth-year  medical  student,  vividly  remem-
bers his experience of test anxiety before an anatomy 
exam  in  his second  year  of  medicine:

I remember sitting and studying anatomy at the begin-
ning of the second year of medicine. I was studying in 
a dark room. I remember my vision starting to fade to 

M4 has experienced test anxiety since his second year 
of medical school, highlighting the significant impact of 
exam-related anxiety on students’ mental health, which 
can  persist  for  years.  This  high  level  of  test  anxiety  has 
disturbed  his  study  preparation  and  prompted  him  to 
consider dropping out of medical school. Moreover, sev-
eral students have complained about the difficulty of the 
third year, citing the busy and dense curriculum. Some 
students experience such intense emotional reactions to 
test  anxiety  during  this  period  that  it  may  result  in  the 
diagnosis of mental health conditions, such as depression. 
One  student  in  her  third  year  of  medical  school  was 
diagnosed  with  both  depression  and  anxiety;  she  attri-
butes her condition to the quantity of non-stop exams:

Honestly,  the  third  year  was  just  like  a  marathon. 
The third year is busy. . .I was diagnosed with depres-
sion.  I  took  SSRI  medication.  (F4) 

A  senior  male  student  expressed  concerns  about 
his  experience  during  the  preclinical  years  of  his 
studies.  He  has  also  been  diagnosed with  depression.

From the second year, there is never enough time for 
studying,  leading  to  constant  studying.  In  my  third 
medical  year,  I  was  diagnosed  with  depression  and 
anxiety.  (M3) 

The  results  emphasise  the  significant  influence  of 
test anxiety on medical students, particularly impact-
ing  their  mental  well-being  during  the  second  and 
third years.  The presence of  emotional reactions  cre-
ates  a  challenging  situation  for  students.  Therefore, 
there  is  a  need  to  implement  appropriate  techniques 
to  handle  test  anxiety  and  promote  students’  overall 
well-being.

Physical  symptoms
Several  students  reported  experiencing  physical 
changes  in  the  days  leading  up  to  the  exam,  such  as 
abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea and frequent 
visits  to  the  bathroom.

Before  exams,  I  feel  sick,  I  feel  pain  in  my  stomach, 
and  I  cannot  eat  anything.  (F3) 

As  the  exams  approach,  I  notice  my  headaches 
becoming  more  frequent,  and  there’s  this  constant 
knot in my  stomach that just doesn’t go away, mak-
ing  it  tough to  keep  my  focus  on  studying.  (F10) 

These quotes illustrate the debilitating nature of test 
anxiety and its effect on physical health. Before exam-
inations,  some  medical  students  experience  various 
physical  symptoms.  These  symptoms  frequently  begin 
weeks beforehand, dramatically affecting their capacity 
to  study  for  exams  adequately.  Students  often  experi-
ence anxiety about forgetting the information they have 
learnt, which is accompanied by physical symptoms of 
stress,  such  as  muscle  tension  in  the  shoulders  and 
chest. Additional physical symptoms may include gas-
trointestinal manifestations, such as abdominal discom-
fort,  nausea  and  loss  of  appetite.  These  physical 
symptoms  exacerbate  discomfort and  hinder  students’ 
ability to concentrate and excel in their tests.

Sleep  disturbance
Many  students  reported  changes  in  their  sleep  pat-
terns.  Medical  students  frequently  experience  exam 
anxiety, which has a substantial impact on their sleep 
habits  and  can  negatively  affect  both  their  perfor-
mance and general well-being. The students’ descrip-
tions  of  their  inability  to  sleep,  particularly  during 
exam  times,  show  how  anxiety  can  interfere  with 
regular  physiological  processes.  F3  highlights  a  high 
degree  of  anxiety  that  prevents  them  from  sleeping, 
mentioning  that  they  stayed  up  until  eight  in  pre-
paration  for  the  exam.  Similarly,  F5  finds it  impossi-
ble  to  sleep  on  exam  day  due  to  the  overwhelming 
stress.  F2  also  confirms  that  sleep  disturbances  are 
often  the  first  and  most  noticeable  symptoms  of 
anxiety,  indicating  that  even  attempts  to  rest  can  be 
ineffective  under  significant  academic  pressure.

I  cannot  even  sleep. . .  until  eight  the  next  morning. 
I  go  to the  exam  after  staying  up  all  night.  (F3)

Another student stated that her sleeplessness led to 

further  anxiety,  which  created  a  negative  cycle.

Before  exam  day, when  I  cannot sleep, I  start to feel 
stressed.  (F5) 

The  initial  sign  of  stress  for  me  was  my  inability  to 
sleep. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t seem to 
fall  asleep.  (F2) 

These  incidents  highlight  the  effect  of  test  anxiety 

on  the  sleeping  patterns  of  medical  students.

Anxiety  during  exams

Medical students’ body symptoms, frequently occurring 
during  exams,  negatively  impact  exam  performance. 
Both  physical  and  psychological  symptoms  may  be 
present.

Physical  and  psychological  symptoms
In  the  previous  section,  ‘Anxiety  Before  Exams’,  stu-
dents  mentioned  several  physical  symptoms  that  can 
occur  before  exams  –  days,  weeks  or  immediately. 
This  section  focuses  on  the  exam-related  physical 
symptoms  that  many  medical  students  commonly 
experience  during  the  examination  period.  These 
symptoms  include  headaches,  nausea,  vomiting  and 
abdominal pain, all of which are commonly linked to 
exam-related  anxiety.  For  instance,  F1  has  expressed 
experiencing  physical  symptoms,  such  as  frequent 
visits to  the  toilet,  which are  typical  signs  of  anxiety:

During  the  exam,  I  feel  nausea  and  pain.  (F3) 

One  student  reported  experiencing  panic  attacks 
during  tests.  The  student  provided  detailed  accounts 
of  their  experiences,  and  the  following  quotes  high-
light the  difficulties  they  faced:

I  try  to  catch  my  breath  by  taking  deep  breaths,  but  it 
feels like no air is coming in. Then, I get this hyperventi-
lation; I breathe too much, and my entire body goes into 
a mode where I get tingles all over my chest, hands, and 
legs. At the beginning of every exam, it happens. I am just 
three minutes in, and I am struggling to breathe. I was on 
the verge of passing out, but thankfully, I did not. They 
had to take me to the clinic. I could not move my hands; 
they  were  locked  up.  I  focused  on  breathing,  calmed 
down, and everything was fine. But yeah, that panic hit 
me. (M6) 

Another student described the effect of test anxiety 

on  her  physical  state  during  an  exam:

I  feel  so  anxious  during  tests  that  my  hands  start 
shaking. It is embarrassing and makes answering the 
exam  questions  harder  than  they  should be.  (F11) 

The  physical  manifestations  of  anxiety  that  occur 
during  exams  can  significantly  affect  students’  aca-
demic  performance.

Post-exam  anxiety

After  exams,  many  students  struggle  with  anxiety, 
especially  in  terms  of  mental  exhaustion  and  worry-
ing  about  exam  outcomes.

Mental  exhaustion
Mental  exhaustion  is  a  common  side  effect  of  exam 
preparation  and  management,  and  it  may  continue 
long after the test has concluded. F3 and M7, fifth-year 
medical students, reported feeling exhausted due to their 
exam experiences, and F4 suffered from constant exhaus-
tion of thinking about their future exam performance:

After  my  finals,  I  find  it  hard  to  concentrate  on 
anything.  My  brain  needs  to  reboot  after  being  on 
overdrive  for  weeks.  (F3) 

I feel mentally burned out after exams; even sim-

ple  tasks  seem  overwhelming.  (M7) 

I’m  constantly  exhausted,  even  when  I’m  not 
studying.  The  anxiety  about  how  I’ll  perform  never 
goes  away,  and  it  just drains  me.  (F4) 

A  fifth-year  student  reflects  on  the  exam  anxiety 

she  experienced  during  her  second  year:

I  still  feel  and  remember  the  overwhelming  anxiety 
I  felt  during  my  second-year  exams  as  if  it  had 
happened  yesterday. (F1) 

The quotation emphasises the impact of persistent 
test  anxiety  on  students  after  exams.  The  cognitive 
toll of  test preparation and performance significantly 
affects  students’  productivity  and  mental  well-being 
after  the  test.  These  quotations  highlight  the  pro-
longed  nature  of  exam  anxiety  experienced  by  med-
ical  students.  Therefore,  it  is  crucial  to  evaluate  the 
long-lasting  anxiety  that  extends  well  beyond  the 
completion of the examinations. Several medical stu-
dents  have  reported  experiencing  exhaustion  and 
anxiety  regarding  their  performance  and  outcomes 
during  such  an  intense  period.  The  persistent  symp-
toms  that  follow  an  exam  highlight  the  significant 
and  lasting  impact  of  anxiety  associated  with  exams. 
This  suggests  that  the  effects  are  not  limited  to  the 
examination  period  but  can  continue  to  negatively 
affect  students’  well-being  long  after  the  exams.

Post-exam  rumination

Students frequently experience anxiety after exams as 
they  await  their  results,  knowing  that  their  future 
academic  and  professional  decisions  are  at  stake. 
Several  students  have  expressed  concerns  about 
their  exam  results  following  the  tests:

The  waiting  period  following  the  exam  is  the  worst 
part  –  not  the  exam  itself.  My  mind  goes  through 
every  scenario  that  could  happen.  (F6) 

I  replay  the  questions  in  my  head,  dwelling  on 

what  I  could have  answered  incorrectly.  (M2) 

The uncertainty of not knowing how I did on the 
exam  just  adds  to  my  anxiety.  Even  after  the  exam, 
I  can’t  relax  –  I  keep  stressing  and  over  think-
ing.  (M4) 

These reflections show the psychological burden of 
uncertainty  regarding  exam  outcomes,  which  can 
intensify  feelings  of  anxiety  and  stress,  often  extend-
ing  well  into  the  post-exam  period.  This  perspective 
on their challenges underscores the need for targeted 
interventions to effectively manage test anxiety. Some 
students undergo a prolonged period of anxiety after 
their exams, with the most intense worry occurring as 
they  anticipate  their  results.  These  periods  are  filled 
with  ambiguity  regarding  the  potential  outcomes  of 
their  academic  and  career  endeavours.  According  to 
student  experiences,  the  waiting  period  serves  as  the 
main  source  of  stress  rather  than  the  examination 
itself. This demonstrates the significant psychological 
toll  that  uncertainty  about  exam  results  can  impose 
on  students,  both  during  the  waiting  period  and  in 
terms of heightened anxiety, as well as the long-term 
effects  on  well-being  and  academic  achievement. 
There  is  a  pressing  need  for  solutions  that  may 
involve  implementing  emotion  regulation  strategies 
or  self-compassion  training  to  reduce  anxiety.

Academic  performance

This  theme  will  explore  how  anxiety  affects  perfor-
mance  across  several  dimensions.  The  students 
reflected on the effect of exam anxiety on their exam-
inations,  practical  skills,  test  scores,  GPA,  patient 
interactions  and  learning  experiences  in  clinical  set-
tings.  They  highlighted  that  clinical  practice  often 
induces  anxiety due  to  the  significant  responsibilities 
and  steep  learning  curves  involved.

Impact  of  anxiety  on  performance

Effect  of  anxiety
Several  students  reported  that  during  exams,  despite 
being  well-prepared,  anxiety  could  lead  them  to  for-
get  even the  most basic  knowledge.

During  oral  exams. . .  I  would  even  forget  my  name, 
and  I  forget  how  to  use  some  of  the  equipment 
I  have  used  so  frequently  –  my  mind  turns 
blank.  (F4) 

I did not even know what ‘zygote’ mean, which is 

basic  knowledge.  (F1) 

F1  offers  an  in-depth  account  of  how  anxiety 
negatively  impacted  her  performance  during  an 
embryology  exam  in  her  second  year.  Despite  her 
extensive  preparation,  anxiety  hindered  her  ability 
to  recall  essential  concepts  and  resulted  in  physical 
symptoms,  ultimately  contributing  to  her  failure  on 
the  exam.

I  took  an  exam  in  embryology  in  year  two  and  was 
ready  for  it.  I  felt  like  I  was  not  a  medical  student 
when I read the exam paper; I forgot my English and 
did  not  know  what  was  written,  as  if  I  had  never 
studied embryology. I was also dizzy and lightheaded 
when  I  started  the  exam.  Zygotes  are  basic  knowl-
edge that I was not even aware of. What I studied in 
this  module  has  slipped  my  mind.  Like  I  am  in 
elementary  school. . .  Anxiety  is  the  reason  I  failed 
the  exam.  (F1) 

These  statements  highlight  the  significant  influ-
ence  of  anxiety  on  cognitive  function  and  exam  per-
formance.  Physiological  symptoms  of  nervousness, 
such  as  vertigo  and  faintness,  exacerbate  the  issue, 
hindering  the  ability  to  effectively  apply  knowledge 
and  skills.  The  experience  of  F1  underscores  the 
importance  of  implementing  efficient  techniques  to 
manage  anxiety,  implying  that  if  these  concerns  are 
not  addressed,  students  may  persistently  perform 
below 
their  potential,  even  when  adequately 
prepared.

Anxiety  with  practical  skills
Many  students  shared  their  apprehension  about 
applying their practical knowledge. A typical example 
of the anxiety experienced by new medical students is 
the  process  of  taking  blood  samples from  patients  or 
performing  standard  medical  procedures.  This  anxi-
ety  emphasises  the  emotional  aspect  of  the  medical 
profession,  as  it  involves not  merely  technical  execu-
tion  but  also  the  safety  and  well-being  of  patients.

My  hands  trembled  the  first  time  I  had  to  suture 
a  wound.  Applying what  you have  studied  in  a  real- 
world setting might be intimidating when you realise 
the  patient’s  health is  in  your  hands.  (M6) 

I  recall  the  anxiety  I  felt  during  my  first  time 
administering  an  injection  to  a  patient;  I  was  so 
concerned  about causing  them  pain.  (F5) 

The  pressure  of  doing  my  first  IV  insertion  was 
intense;  I  knew  the  technique  well  in  my  mind,  but 
applying 
it  was  a  completely  different  experi-
ence.  (M8) 

These medical students described how anxiety and 
fear  impact  their  performance  in  clinical  settings. 
Their  fear  stems  from  their  concern  for  patients’ 
health  and  safety.

I  was  so  nervous  going  into  the  anatomy  exam  that 
I  forgot  everything.  It  was  my  second  year,  and 
I  could  not  solve  it.  In  the  end,  my  test  score  was 
below  60,  and  I  had  to  retake  the  subject  in  the 
summer.  (F2) 

Anatomy,  of  course.  I  hate  Anatomy  . . .  30  stu-

dents  out  of  60  failed  Anatomy.  (F4) 

As exams approach, my anxiety goes up, and it is 
harder  for  me  to  focus.  Even  though  I  studied  a  lot, 
I  still  scored lower  because  of  the  stress.  (M4) 

F6  further  explained  why  many  students  fail  the 

anatomy exam,  stating,

I honestly struggled with the vast amount of memor-
ising required for anatomy lectures. I could not keep 
up;  there  was  not  enough  time.  I  felt  pressured, 
especially  before  exams.  The  neuro  lectures  on 
Anatomy  were  very  dense.  The  information  was 
understandable  and  memorable,  but  it  required 
more  time  than  I  had,  so  I  failed  it.  (F6) 

Further  inquiry  is  necessary  to  determine  the 
underlying  causes  of  the  50%  failure  rate  among  the 
third-year  medical  student  cohort  in  the  anatomy 
exam.  Identifying  the  root  causes  of  this  high  failure 
rate  is  crucial  for  developing  effective  interventions 
and  enhancing  student  outcomes.  The  following  sec-
tion  examines  the  intricate  relationship  between  test 
anxiety  and  academic  achievement  among  medical 
students.

Generally,  test  anxiety  is  believed  to  negatively 
impact  performance.  However,  several  students 
reported that it functioned more as a stimulant, com-
pelling them to adopt more rigorous study habits and 
achieve  greater  exam  grades.  One  student  shared 
their  experience  of  feeling  anxious  before  the  exam 
but  ultimately  performing  well.  They  described 
experiencing  nervousness,  palpitations  and  chest 
pain  prior  to  entering  the  exam  room.  Despite  these 
symptoms,  they  managed  to  calm  themselves  and 
ultimately  achieved  a  score  of  80  in  the  subject.

Before  entering  the  exam  venue,  I  felt  very  nervous, 
with palpitations and chest pain with each heartbeat. 
I tried to calm myself . . . but thank God, it went well; 
I  scored  80  in  the  subject.  (M3) 

My  pre-exam  nervousness  motivates  me  to  study 
harder.  It  serves  as  a  kind  of  wake-up  call for  me to 
get  better  organised  and 
improve  my  exam 
score.  (M8) 

Educational  outcome  concerns

Concerning  exam  outcome
Many  students  expressed  concern  about  their  test 
scores  and  pass/fail  outcomes,  often  fixating  on 
their  exam  performance.  Several  medical  students 
shared 
their  experiences  with  anatomy  written 
exams during their second and third years of medical 
school. Moreover, they noted that half of their cohort 
failed  the  exam  in  the  third  year.

Some students do not think there is a link between 
anxiety  and  test  scores.  For  example,  F12,  a  second- 
year medical student, believes that her performance is 
unaffected  by  test  anxiety.

Once  I  sit  for  the  exam,  I  do  not  think  that  exam 
anxiety  has  an  impact on  how  well  I  perform.  (F12) 

Other  students  believe that  there is no direct rela-
tionship  between  anxiety  levels  and  test  scores.  F12, 
this

8

perspective.  She  states  that  she  detaches  from  the 
usual physiological and psychological responses asso-
ciated with test anxiety once she is actively engaged in 
the examination process. Her statement suggests that 
F12  May  possess  unconscious  coping  mechanisms 
that  enable  her  to  compartmentalise  or  at  least  tem-
porarily set aside her anxiety during an examination.
In  summary,  there  is  a  notable  difference  in  how 
students  perceive  anxiety.  For  some,  anxiety  can  be 
crippling.  Specifically,  a  student  may  perform  well 
under  conditions  that  closely  resemble  those  in 
which  they  prepared.  For  instance,  some  students 
perform  better  only  if  the  amount  of  anxiety  they 
experience  while  studying  aligns  closely  with  the 
anxiety  they  experienced  during  the  test.  This  align-
ment allows them to optimise their recall and overall 
performance.

Concerning  GPA
Most  students  discuss  the  importance  of  scores  and 
GPA  in  medical  school.  Any  changes  in  GPA  attrib-
uted  to  test  anxiety  can  affect  their  perception  of 
academic  performance,  their  results  over  the  seme-
sters  and  their  long-term  academic  implications. 
Several  students  attribute  a  drop  in  their  GPA  to 
episodes  of  anxiety.  F4,  who  entered  medical  school 
with  a  GPA  of  5.0,  is  currently  a  fifth-year  student 
with  a  3.5  GPA.  She  stated:

All I think about is increasing my GPA; it makes me 
anxious.  (F4) 

M2  is  a  third-year  student  whose  GPA  has 
dropped  from  5.0  to  3.8.  This  decline  has  led  him  to 
worry about his upcoming exams and to question his 
study  skills.

After seeing my GPA drop last semester, I started to 
doubt my abilities. It is hard not to feel like a failure 
when  you  know  you  could  do  better.  (M2) 

Some  students  fear  that  their  GPAs  will  affect 
their  eligibility  for  future  residency  programmes, 
such  as  F7. 

I  am  worried  that  my  GPA  will  not  be  competi-
tive  enough  for  the  residency  programmes  I  aim 
for.  (F7) 

It  is  expected  that  GPA  will  be  a  major  source  of 
stress  for  medical  students  because  of  its  significant 
influence  on  future  career  opportunities,  residency 
placements and speciality choices. The high academic 
standards  required  to  achieve  a  competitive  GPA 
create  continuous  pressure,  which  subsequently 
leads  to  worry,  self-doubt  and  chronic  anxiety,  ulti-
mately  affecting  both  mental  health  and  academic 
performance. The emphasis on GPA tends to sideline 
important  aspects  of  medical  training,  such  as  prac-
tical  skills  and  patient  interaction.  Hence,  medical- 
educational  institutions  should  provide  proper  sup-
port  systems,  including  counselling  services  and 

anxiety  management  workshops,  to  foster  students’ 
personal  and  professional  growth  as  well  as  their 
overall  health.

Clinical  competency

Patient  interaction

Students  highlight  that  complex  procedures  even-
tually  become  routine  through  repeated  exposure  to 
clinical  evaluations  with  patients.  This  evolution  is 
crucial  for  professional  development,  transforming 
students  into  skilled  practitioners.  One  medical  stu-
dent,  in  her  fourth  year  and  first  year  of  clinical 
practice,  expressed  feeling  anxious  when  dealing 
with  patients.

I feel nervous when I take a clinical history from the 
patients.  (F8) 

However,  senior  students  acknowledged  that  pro-
viding  patient  care  requires  ongoing  learning,  which 
comes  with  practice.

As  I  get  more  experience,  things  that  once  seemed 
unattainable  seem  normal.  It  is  evidence  of  how 
medical  education  imparts  knowledge.  (F12) 

With each patient interaction, I am more adept at 
managing  the  clinical  tasks  and  the  human  health 
involved,  which  are  just  as  critical.  (M8) 

Other  students  expressed  that  interacting  with 
patients  is  the  most  rewarding  aspect  of  studying 
medicine:

Dealing  with  patients  is  the  most  enjoyable  part  of 
my  medicine  . . .  building  relationships  with  patients 
and  seeing  their  journey  from  illness  to  health  con-
tinually  reinforces  my  passion  for medicine.  (M4) 

These  quotations 

illuminate  medical  students’ 
typical  worries  when  applying  their  knowledge  in 
practical  situations  and  the  steady  confidence  that 
develops  through  consistent  practice.  Each  quotation 
highlights medical education’s dynamic and demand-
ing  character  while  emphasising  the  value  of  perse-
verance in overcoming initial anxieties and acquiring 
complex abilities.

Emotion  Regulation

This  theme  presents  the  emotion  regulation  medical 
students  use,  including  cognitive  reappraisal  and 
emotion  suppression.

Emotion  regulation  strategies

Cognitive  reappraisal
This strategy involves identifying and challenging nega-
tive  thought  patterns  to  alter  unwanted  behaviour  pat-
terns  and  relieve  anxiety.  Students  may  use  these 

strategies to tackle irrational fears related to exams and to 
reframe their thoughts towards more positive outcomes. 
Cognitive  reappraisal  refers  to  the  process  of  re- 
evaluating and reframing one’s thoughts and perceptions 
to  effectively  regulate  and  manage  emotions.  In  this 
emotion  control  method,  individuals  alter  their  emo-
tional reactions by modifying their cognitive interpreta-
tion of a potentially emotion-inducing scenario, resulting 
in more advantageous emotional outcomes.

Whenever  I  predict  the  worst  outcomes  for  my  per-
formance,  I  change  those  thoughts  and  shift  my 
focus  towards  better  scenarios.  (F9) 

Instead  of  dwelling  on  the  negatives,  I  remind 
myself  of  the  positives;  it  makes  a  big  differ-
ence.  (F12) 

Whenever  I  start  thinking  negatively,  I  remind 

myself  about  my  dream  to  be  a good  doctor.  (M4) 

Conversely,  a  sixth-year  male  medical  student 
attempted  cognitive  therapy,  which  is  based  on  the 
concept  of  cognitive  reappraisal,  to  address  his  anxi-
ety  but  did  not  notice  any  benefits.

I  tried  cognitive  therapy  with  a  professional,  but 
I  did  not see  changes  in  my  anxiety.  (M3) 

The  quotes  above  show  how  students  actively 
engage in reframing their negative thoughts. By shift-
ing  their  focus  from  potentially  adverse  outcomes 
(like  failing  an  exam)  to  more  positive  or  realistic 
expectations,  they  can  reduce  anxiety  and  foster 
a  more constructive  mindset.

Emotion  suppression

Emotion  suppression  refers  to  the  act  of  restraining  or 
controlling  the  outward  display  of  emotions.  Unlike 
reappraisal, which involves changing the way one thinks 
about  a  situation,  suppression  is  a  response-focused 
method  that  solely  affects  the  outward  display  of  emo-
tions  without  altering  the  emotional  experience  itself. 
This can entail concealing overt manifestations of nega-
tive  emotions  in  the  social  environment  to  uphold  cul-
tural  conventions  or  individual  preferences.  While 
suppression  may  serve  a  purpose  in  the  short  term,  it 
ultimately  has  detrimental  effects  on  individuals.  It  can 
lead to physiological distress and a decline in the quality 
of  relationships,  as  there  is  often  a  disconnect  between 
internal feelings and outward emotions.

Three  medical  students  (M3,  M5  and  M9)  high-
light  a  common  reason  for  using  emotion  suppres-
sion:  the  belief  that  sharing  their  stress  will  either 
overburden  their  loved ones  or  be  misinterpreted.

I choose not to share my burdens with my mom; she 
is  already carrying  enough  of  her  own.  (M3). 

I  often  keep  my  struggles  to  myself  because 
explaining  the  pressures  of  medical  school  to  my 
family  feels  like  speaking  a  different  language  – 
they  just  do  not  get  it. (M9).

I do not like to talk about my stress; I do not want 

to  radiate  negative  energy.  (F6) 

On the other hand, several students indicated that 
discussing  their  emotional  struggles  and  test  anxiety 
with  others  helps  them  cope with  exams.

Sharing  my  fears  about  exams  with  my  study  group 
made  me  realise  we  all  had  similar  anxieties.  We 
started  to  support  each  other  more  actively.  (F12) 

Whenever  I  feel  overwhelmed,  I  call  my  sister  to 
express  my  feelings  about  studying  medicine.  She 
went through medical school and understood exactly 
what  I  was  dealing  with.  (M1) 

I found  it beneficial to talk about my  test anxiety 

with  my  friends  and  get  reassurance.  (F7) 

These quotes demonstrate the use of emotion sup-
pression and the reasons for using it and highlight the 
importance of expressing negative emotions and their 
positive  effects  on  managing  anxiety  and  stress 
related to exams. Sharing experiences with peers pro-
vides  mutual  support,  while  family  members  offer 
comfort  and  understanding.

Other  coping  mechanisms

This  theme  presents  other  coping  strategies  medical 
students use to reduce exam stress besides emotional 
regulation.  It  emerged  inductively  from  the  thematic 
analysis.

Study  habits

Study  routines
Medical  students  exhibit  an  array  of  study  strategies 
to successfully navigate the rigours of medical school 
and  enhance  their  academic  performance.  These 
techniques  not  only  facilitate  information  retention 
but are also vital for preserving mental health amidst 
the  complex  demands  of  medical  education.  Each 
student  adopts  a  personalised  approach  that  best 
learning  style  and  emotional 
suits  their  unique 
needs,  as  demonstrated  by  the  diversity  of  their 
strategies.

By  dividing  my  study  time  into  30-minute  segments 
separated  by  a  5-minute  break,  I  can  enhance  stress 
management.  (M1) 

Similarly,  M3  describes  their  strategy  of  experi-
menting with six distinct study methods to determine 
the  most  effective  approach.

I  also  attempted  to  study  in  six  different  ways  until 
I  figured  out  the  most  effective  way  to  study,  and 
that  relieved  my  test  anxiety.  (M3) 

I also attempted to study in six different ways until 
I figured out the most effective way to study, and that

N.  ALSHAREEF  ET  AL.

In  contrast,  F3  prioritises  studying  early  in  the 
semester to prevent anxiety as the examination period 
approaches.

I  make  an  effort  to  begin  studying  in  advance  to 
avoid  feeling  regretful  and  anxious  and  to  reassure 
myself  that  I  am  doing  my  best.  (F3) 

My  grades  and  feelings  significantly  improved  in 
the second term compared to the first because I had

These  methods  illustrate  the  significance  of  struc-
tured  study  regimens  for  coping  with  the  intense 
pressures  of  medical  school  and  improving  test

Time  management
Effective  time  management  is  crucial  for  medical 
students,  who  often  need  to  balance  coursework, 
clinical  rotations  and  personal  commitments.  By 
developing  strong  organisational  skills,  students  can 
reduce  anxiety  and  gain  a  greater  sense  of  control 
over  their  workload  and  deadlines.

I  started  allocating  specific  times  for  studying  and 
breaks. . .  it  helps me  to  relieve  anxiety.  (F2) 

Other  students  assert  that  organising  their  study 
schedules  in  advance  facilitated  effective  time  man-
agement  and  reduced  their  anxiety.

Every  Saturday,  I  spend  an  hour  planning  my  week. 
It keeps me on track with my studies and exams and 
manages  my  stress.  (F3) 

Others  improve  their  academic  performance  and 
test  anxiety  by  establishing  academic 

manage 
objectives.

I  establish  daily  objectives  that  are  practical  and 
attainable. This helps me manage my emotions better 
by  preventing  the  feeling of  being overwhelmed  and 
keeping  me motivated.  (M1) 

The students’ quotations above underscore several 
efficacious  time management  tactics  that  prove  espe-
cially advantageous in the demanding medical school 
environment.  Each quotation offers insight into stra-
tegies for alleviating test anxiety and increasing moti-
vation  for  learning.

and  anxieties  with  a  friend,  can  effectively  mitigate 
feelings  of  isolation.  Participating  in  dialogues  with 
senior  peers  or  classmates  to  obtain  reassurance  and 
a more balanced viewpoint on examinations serves as 
an  effective  coping strategy.

Discussing  homework  with  my  peers  not  only  helps 
with  studying  but  also  eases  the  feeling  of  being 
overwhelmed.  (F2) 

My peers have  been my  friends since  school, and 
they  are  my  biggest  source  of  support.  Having  such 
a  group  helps  me  manage  my  emotions  better,  as 
I  can  share  my  stress  and  challenges  with  them, 
which  eases  anxiety and  keeps  me  grounded.  (M2) 

The significance of family, as emphasised by F1, is 
similarly  critical.  The  emotional  solace  offered  by 
family  members,  particularly  a  mother’s  reassurance, 
is  significantly  calming.

I go to my mum. She sits with me and tries to calm me. 
She is always saying to me, ‘Everything will be OK’. (F1) 

As  highlighted  by  F1,  the  role  of  family  is  equally 
vital.  The  emotional  comfort  provided  by  family 
members,  such  as  a  mother’s  reassurance,  can  have 
a  profoundly  calming  effect.  These  support  systems 
foster  a  nurturing  environment  that  alleviates  the 
psychological  burdens  associated  with  rigorous  aca-
demic  demands.

Seeking  professional  help
Some students may find the university’s psychological 
and  counselling  services  helpful.  Instructors  fre-
quently  offer  academic  support,  point  students 
towards  resources  that  improve  their  educational 
experiences  and  help alleviate  exam-related  anxiety.

Sometimes  I  go  to  my  subject  professor  and  talk  to 
her  about the exam. She gives me useful advice, and 
that  helps  me  to  deal  with  difficult  subjects  and 
relieve  my  anxiety.  (F11) 

After  discussing  my  fears  with  my  professor,  she 
pointed  me  towards  additional  resources  and  study 
groups  that  helped  with my  exam  worries.  (M5) 

The  counselling  services  were  beneficial  to  many 
students. Counsellors are skilled at working with stu-
dents  to  create  individualised  time  and  anxiety  man-
agement plans,  which can  make academic  difficulties 
feel  more  manageable.

Social  and  professional  support

Social  support
Some students depend on the emotional assistance of 
their  peers,  family  and  friends.  Engaging  in  study 
groups,  where

students 

My schedule was getting to me, so I went to see our 
campus  counsellor.  She  assisted  me  in  creating 
a  strategy  that  helped  me  keep  things  under  control 
and  manage  my  exam  anxiety.  (M4) 

According  to  these  students,  subject  professors 
and academic counsellors are crucial in relieving stu-
dents’ anxiety  and  concerns.

Physical  well-being

Physical  exercise
Physical  activity  is  also  commonly  advised  as  a  de- 
stressor.  Many  medical  students  have  reported  using 
various  forms  of  exercise  to  alleviate  stress,  improve 
their  mood  by  boosting  endorphin  levels  and  main-
tain  their  physical  fitness.

I walk a lot, and I put on headphones. . . It helped me 
to  think  about  the  subject  and  to  calm  me  before 
exams.  (F11) 

I  play  football  now,  and  I  participate  in  tourna-
ments,  padel,  and  tennis,  but  yes,  I  really  like  these 
things, and as soon as I find a slot to do it, I do it to 
relieve  my  stress.  (M4) 

Going to the  gym regularly helps me manage my 
test anxiety. Physical exercise keeps me fit and clears 
my  mind;  it  helps me to  focus and  stay  calm  during 
exams.  (F4) 

Other  students  mentioned  that  they  use  breathing 
exercises to relieve their anxiety during examinations.

When  I  enter  the  OSCE  stations,  if  I  feel  myself 
getting  tense,  I  will  lose  everything.  To  calm  myself, 
I  take  a  deep  breath  and  enter the  station.  (M1) 

One student stated that although she finds comfort 
in  powerlifting  and  exercise,  she  frequently  experi-
ences  feelings  of  regret  and  encounters  allegations 
from  her  peers  regarding  her  inadequate  allocation 
of  time to  her  academic  pursuits.

Even  though  I  enjoy  weightlifting  and  working  out, 
I feel guilty because other students say I do not study 
enough.  (F8) 

The  statements  made  by  medical  students  exem-
plify  the  substantial  impact  of  physical  activity  on 
managing  the  tension  and  anxiety  associated  with 
their  academic  pursuits.  Engaging  in  physical  activ-
ities,  such  as  walking  and  participating  in  team 
sports, offers individuals a valuable means to alleviate 
stress and enhance cognitive function. It is crucial for 
students to prioritise their health despite the arduous 
requirements  of  medical  school.  However,  balancing 
academic  obligations  with  self-care  via  exercise  can 
lead  to  feelings  of  guilt,  especially  when  peers  per-
ceive  such endeavours  as  diversions  from  studying.

Discussion

This  study  aims  to  explore  how  medical  students 
experience  test  anxiety  and  manage  their  emotions 
during  exams  and  investigate  these  implications  for 
their  academic  performance.  To  our  knowledge,  this 
is the first qualitative study to explore the role of test 
anxiety on the academic performance of medical stu-
dents  and  their  emotion  regulation  strategies.  Test 
anxiety  is  a  common  problem  among  medical  stu-
dents; students experience test anxiety before, during

and  after  the  exam  period.  They  result  in  a  range  of 
mental and physical symptoms and sleep disturbance 
that  negatively  impact  their  academic  performance 
and general health. The level of anxiety that students 
experience  can  vary  from  being  a  source  of  motiva-
tion  to  being  a  severe  obstacle.  Consistent  with  pre-
vious  research  [18],  the  dual  nature  of  anxiety  can 
serve  as  both  a  motivator  and  a  severe  impediment, 
depending  on  its  management  and  intensity.  The 
findings underscore the profound impact of test anxi-
ety  on  medical  students,  affecting  both  their  mental 
and  physical  health.  The  combination  of  emotional 
and  physical  symptoms  creates  a  challenging  envir-
onment for students, emphasising the need for effec-
tive  strategies  to  manage  test  anxiety  and  support 
students’  well-being.

Test anxiety complexly influences medical students’ 
academic performance, impacting their knowledge and 
practical  abilities.  Anxiety  levels  considerably  impact 
the  evaluation  criteria  for  assessing  academic  achieve-
ment, such as test scores and GPA. The GPA of medical 
students is important throughout their academic career. 
Dread  of  failing  and  evaluations  may  increase  anxiety 
and feelings of inadequacy [19]. Several students men-
tioned that their GPA significantly dropped throughout 
the academic years, demonstrating a link between anxi-
ety  and  overall  performance.  Martin  and  Naziruddin 
(2020) also find that worry is linked to lower grades in 
medical school, where residency applications are com-
petitive and GPA matters [20]. Concern that one’s GPA 
may  not  meet  residency  programme  standards  may 
increase  this  anxiety.  In  addition,  anxiety  impedes  the 
acquisition of clinical competence, which is crucial for 
providing appropriate patient care. The literature sup-
ports  these  findings  by  indicating  that  high  levels  of 
anxiety may interfere with the processing and recall of 
academic  perfor-
lowering 
knowledge, 
mance [21].

thereby 

In  clinical  settings,  the  findings  show  that  anxiety 
not  only  hinders  knowledge  application  but  also 
impedes  the  acquisition  of  practical  skills.  Medical 
students  frequently  suffer  from  increased  anxiety, 
which limits their ability to conduct standard medical 
procedures effectively [22]. For example, one student 
recounted  their  experience  of  performing  their  first 
suture  with  trembling  hands.  Bacon  and  Taylor  [4] 
asserted  that  students’  performance  is  substantially 
impacted  by  anxiety,  specifically  when  engaging  in 
such  as  physical 
demanding 
examinations.

cognitive 

tasks, 

Emotion  regulation is essential for medical students, 
as it substantially influences their academic success and 
mental  well-being.  Students  in  this  study  frequently 
employ  cognitive  reappraisal  to  reframe  a  stressful  cir-
cumstance in a more optimistic perspective to decrease 
anxiety and sustain concentration, which is a very effec-
tive  emotion  regulation  strategy  [23].  Those  students 

12

perceive  anxiety  as  a  catalyst  rather  than  an  obstacle, 
which can assist students in directing their apprehensive 
energy  towards  effective  study  sessions.  On  the  other 
hand,  several  medical  students  prefer  to  suppress  their 
emotions so they do not harm loved ones through their 
suffering. This is a maladaptive emotion regulation strat-
egy  and,  in  the  long  term,  can  lead  to  psychological 
distress  [24].  Learning  how  to  regulate  emotions  may 
assist students in making correct decisions and handling 
difficult  situations,  which  consequently  helps  them  to 
succeed. Therefore, it is potentially beneficial for students 
to use emotional regulation to minimise their test anxiety.
The  findings  also  explored  how  medical  students 
cope  with  their  struggles  in  medical  education  by 
adopting  several  effective  strategies.  One  strategy  is 
managing  their  study  routine  effectively  by  using 
segmented  study  time  with  30-minute  breaks,  which 
is  efficient.  According  to  Cirillo  2006,  Focus  and 
productivity  are  improved  by  this  technique  [25]. 
Students also try different study methods, which sup-
ports  Karpicke’s  [26]  findings  that  active  retrieval 
activities  like  self-testing  boost  long-term  retention 
and  understanding.  Time  management  specialists 
recommend  early  and  consistent  study  to  prevent 
last-minute  stress  [26].  These  methods  highlight  the 
significance  of  planned  and  personalised  study  sche-
dules 
for  medical  school’s  stringent  standards. 
Medical  students  need  time  management  to  reduce 
anxiety  and  boost  performance.  Participants  men-
tioned  that  weekly  planning  is  based  on  research 
showing  that planning and  goal-setting improve aca-
demic  achievement  and  reduce  procrastination  [27]. 
Therefore, time management is crucial to reduce test 
anxiety.

Peer  and  family  support  is  well  acknowledged  in 
academic  stress  literature.  Two  participants  said  dis-
cussing assignments with peers helps them study and 
feel supported. According to the literature, peer rela-
tionships  improve  academic  performance  and  emo-
tional  well-being  [28].  They  also  mentioned  the 
importance of the mother’s comfort in relieving anxi-
ety, consistent with Cutrona et al. (1994) findings that 
family  support  reduces  stress  and  improves  mental 
health  [29]. These findings  underline  the  importance 
of  social  support  systems  in  decreasing  medical  edu-
cation’s psychological obstacles. Research participants 
also  recommend  counselling  and  academic  support 
for  academic  stress  management.  Academic  mentor-
ship  and  advising  improve  students’  performance 
[30].  They  addressed  the  benefits  of  talking  to  their 
professors  and  campus  counsellors.  The  participants 
recommended  contacting  teachers  and  counsellors 
for  practical  advice  on  handling  tough  courses, 
exam anxiety, and additional resources. The literature 
confirmed  that  campus  counselling  services  effec-
tively  address  academic  stress  and  anxiety  [31]. 
Some students stated that having professional mental 

health  care  helped  them  manage  their  anxiety. 
However,  the  mixed  comments  on  these  services 
show  the  need  for  tailored  help.

Exercise is an effective coping tool for many medical 
students.  The  literature  highly  recommends  physical 
activity  for  stress  relief.  Several  students  said  frequent 
exercise helps their mental health. Research found that 
endorphins  from  regular  exercise  reduce  stress  and 
improve  mood  [32].  Students’  use  of  deep  breathing 
exercises  to  reduce  exam  anxiety  is  consistent  with 
relaxation techniques’ effectiveness in reducing  anxiety 
and  improving  focus  [33].  Physical  health  is  crucial  to 
coping with test stress and maintaining mental wellness 
[34].  One  student  felt  guilty  about  exercising  a  few 
hours  a  week,  and  her  peers  exacerbated  this.  They 
considered  it  a  waste  of  time  that  could  be  better 
spent  studying.  Therefore,  physical  exercise  must  be 
promoted  to  reduce  stress  and  promote  a  healthy 
mind  and  body.  This  study  is  particularly  significant 
in  the  Saudi  Arabian  context  due  to  its  focus  on  the 
experiences  of  medical  students  within  a  collectivist 
culture.  The  findings  of  this  study  underscore  the 
importance of culturally sensitive approaches to addres-
sing test anxiety. For instance, the reliance on peer and 
family support, as observed in  the participants’ experi-
ences,  aligns  with  the  broader  collectivist  values  of  the 
region.  This  highlights  the  need  for  practical  solutions 
that  integrate  these  cultural  dynamics,  such  as  struc-
tured  peer  mentorship  programs  or  family-inclusive 
support  initiatives,  to  reduce  test  anxiety  and  enhance 
academic  performance.  By  addressing  these  local  cul-
tural  and  academic  pressures,  the  study  provides  valu-
able  insights  for  educators,  policymakers,  and  mental 
health  practitioners  to  design  effective  and  culturally 
appropriate solutions for Saudi medical students.

Conclusion

Medical  students  experience  test  anxiety  before,  dur-
ing,  and  after  exams  leads  to  various  mental  and 
physical  symptoms,  as  well  as  sleep  disturbances, 
which  negatively  affect  both  academic  performance 
and  overall  health.  This  study’s  findings  emphasise 
the need for comprehensive strategies to manage test 
anxiety  effectively  and  support  medical  students’ 
mental  well-being.  By  implementing  targeted  inter-
ventions  and  fostering  a  supportive  educational 
environment,  medical  schools  can  enhance  academic 
and  clinical  outcomes,  ultimately  preparing  students 
for  successful  careers in  healthcare.

Given the complexity of test anxiety and its impacts 
revealed in this study, future research should focus on 
longitudinal studies to track the effectiveness of specific 
interventions  over  time.  Comparative  studies  across 
different educational environments could also provide 
insights  into  cultural  and  institutional  factors  that 
influence  anxiety  levels  and  coping  strategies  among 

medical  students.  Recognising  the  potential  impact  of 
targeted anxiety-reduction strategies on academic per-
formance,  we  suggest  this  as  a  critical  area  for  future 
research,  with  further  investigation  into  the  most  effi-
cacious  strategies  potentially  providing  valuable  gui-
dance  for  educational  programs  aimed  at  supporting 
student well-being and academic success.

Limitations  of  the  study

these 

These  study  results  may  have  limitations.  The  study 
included opinions from only one medical school. While 
the  authors  provided  the  maximum  sample  size  and 
detailed  participant  characteristics,  results  from  other 
student  populations  may  differ. 
institutions  or 
Therefore, 
findings  cannot  be  generalised. 
Another  limitation  is  the  lack  of  available  literature  on 
the role of test anxiety, emotion regulation, and academic 
performance among medical students, making it difficult 
to  compare  these  results  with  those  of  other  studies. 
Another limitation is the difference between participants’ 
current GPA and their original GPA, which was not in 
the  inclusion  criteria  in  this  study.  It  is  possible  that 
a lower GPA could have indirectly influenced participa-
tion, while those with a higher GPA may have been less 
likely to take part. This potential selection bias limits the 
generalisability of the findings.
