Post-traumatic stress disorder: 
the neurobiological impact of 
psychological trauma

Overview of psychological trauma, 
post-traumatic stress disorder, 
and biological markers

P

sychological trauma can result from witnessing
an event that is perceived to be life-threatening or to
pose the potential of serious bodily injury to self or oth-
ers. Such experiences, which are often accompanied by
intense fear, horror, and helplessness, can lead to the
development of, and are required for the diagnosis of,
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 It was originally
thought that PTSD represented a normative response,
at the extreme end of a response continuum, the sever-
ity of which related primarily to trauma/stressor inten-
sity. However, it has become clear over time that the
response of an individual to trauma depends not only on
stressor characteristics, but also on factors specific to the
individual.2 For the vast majority of the population, the
psychological trauma brought about by the experience
of profound threat is limited to an acute, transient dis-
turbance. Though transient, such reactions can be quite
unpleasant and are typically characterized by phenom-
ena that can be grouped for the most part into three pri-
mary domains: (i) reminders of the exposure (including

The classic fight-or-flight response to perceived threat
is a reflexive nervous phenomenon that has obvious
survival advantages in evolutionary terms. However,
the systems that organize the constellation of reflex-
ive survival behaviors following exposure to perceived
threat can under some circumstances become dysreg-
ulated in the process. Chronic dysregulation of these
systems can lead to functional impairment in certain
individuals who become “psychologically traumatized”
and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
A body of data accumulated over several decades has
demonstrated neurobiological abnormalities in PTSD
patients. Some of these findings offer insight into the
pathophysiology of PTSD as well as the biological vul-
nerability  of  certain  populations  to  develop  PTSD.
Several pathological features found in PTSD patients
overlap with features found in patients with traumatic
brain injury, paralleling the shared signs and symptoms
of these clinical syndromes.

flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, nightmares); (ii) activa-
tion (including hyperarousal, insomnia, agitation, irri-
tability, impulsivity and anger); and (iii) deactivation
(including numbing, avoidance, withdrawal, confusion,
derealization, dissociation, and depression). As these
reactions are self-limiting by definition, in general they
provoke minimal functional impairment over time. On
the other hand, for a significant minority of the popu-
lation, the psychological trauma brought about by the
experience of profound threat leads to a longer-term
syndrome that has been defined, validated, and termed
PTSD in the clinical literature. PTSD is often accompa-
nied by devastating functional impairment. 
PTSD  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  signs  and
symptoms in the three primary domains described above
for a period extending beyond 1 month (such periods can
in some cases occur long after the original, precipitating
traumatic exposure). The signs and symptoms of PTSD,
therefore, appear to reflect a persistent, abnormal adap-
tation of neurobiological systems to the stress of wit-
nessed trauma. The neurobiological systems that regulate
stress responses include certain endocrine and neuro-
transmitter  pathways  as  well  as  a  network  of  brain
regions known to regulate fear behavior at both con-
scious and unconscious levels. Not surprisingly, much
research has consequently focused on exploring these
systems in more detail as well as attempting to elucidate
the  pathological  changes  that  occur  in  patients  who
develop PTSD. More specifically, there have been and
continue to be ongoing efforts to link neurobiological
changes identified in patients who suffer from PTSD to
the specific clinical features that constitute PTSD, includ-
ing altered learning/extinction, heightened arousal, and
intermittent dissociative behavior as examples relevant
to each of the three primary domains. Efforts to identify
neurobiological markers for PTSD originally presumed
that abnormalities were acquired “downstream” from an
exposure, as a consequence of traumatic experience. It

could  be,  however,  that  certain  abnormalities  in  the
patient  with  PTSD  simply  represent  pre-existing  or
“upstream” pathology that is functionally dormant until
released by trauma exposure and detected thereafter
upon investigation. Along these lines, recent interest has
focused on factors that seem to modulate outcome vari-
ation in neurobiological systems following trauma expo-
sure including genetic susceptibility factors, female gen-
der, prior trauma, early developmental stage at the time
of  traumatic  exposure,  and  physical  injury  (including
traumatic brain injury—TBI) at the time of psychologi-
cal trauma; these parameters likely contribute to vulner-
ability for, versus resilience against, developing PTSD. 
Although the biological, psychological, and social ram-
ifications of PTSD have been under scientific scrutiny
for some time now, and treatment has improved dra-
matically, much remains unknown about this condition
and controversy persists in both the neuroscientific as
well as the clinical/treatment literature. In this text, we
review  the  neurobiological  impact  of  psychological
trauma from the perspective that genetic, developmen-
tal, and experiential factors predispose certain individ-
uals to the development of PTSD. More specifically, we
review the current database as pertains to biological
markers of PTSD and the possibility that some biologi-
cal markers may not be acquired but, rather, may in fact
predate trauma until functionally “unmasked” by stress.
Where  relevant,  we  also  make  note  of  similarities
between  PTSD  and TBI,  which  extend  beyond  well-
known  signs  and  symptoms  (such  as  irritability  and
social withdrawal) to include abnormalities in the same
neurobiological systems. Lastly, the article includes a
short section on basic considerations for future direction.
Ideas put forth in this communication are done so in the
interest of developing a consistent model for conceptual
purposes. It is recognized at the outset that numerous
inconsistencies can be found in the literature that high-
light the multifactorial and complex nature of this field.

The biology of PTSD

There are a number of factors that must be considered
in contemplating the interplay between adverse envi-
ronmental stimulation, stress responses/reactions, and
pathology. In this section, basic findings are reviewed
from endocrinology, neurochemistry, and brain circuitry
research  conducted  on  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of
PTSD (Table I).

Endocrine factors

Core endocrine features of PTSD include abnormal reg-
ulation of cortisol and thyroid hormones, though there
is some disagreement about these findings in the litera-
ture. Of note, endocrine dysregulation is also found in
patients diagnosed with TBI as a result of damage to the
pituitary stalk.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the
central coordinator of the mammalian neuroendocrine
stress response systems, and as such, it has been a major
focus of scrutiny in patients with PTSD (Figure 1). In
short, the HPA axis is made up of endocrine hypothala-
mic components, including the anterior pituitary, as well
as an effector organ, the adrenal glands. Upon exposure
to stress, neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular

nucleus (PVN) secrete corticotropin-releasing hormone
(CRH) from nerve terminals in the median eminence
into the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal circulation,
which stimulates the production and release of adreno-
corticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. ACTH
in turn stimulates the release of glucocorticoids from the
adrenal cortex. Glucocorticoids modulate metabolism as
well as immune and brain function, thereby orchestrat-
ing physiological and organismal behavior to manage
stressors. At the same time, several brain pathways mod-
ulate HPA axis activity. In particular, the hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibit, whereas the amyg-
dala and aminergic brain stem neurons stimulate, CRH
neurons in the PVN. In addition, glucocorticoids exert
negative feedback control of the HPA axis by regulating
hippocampal and PVN neurons. Sustained glucocorticoid
exposure has adverse effects on hippocampal neurons,
including reduction in dendritic branching, loss of den-
dritic spines, and impairment of neurogenesis.3-5

Although stressors as a general rule activate the HPA
axis, studies in combat veterans with PTSD demonstrate
decreases in cortisol concentrations, as detected in urine
or blood, compared with healthy controls and other com-

parator groups. This surprising finding, though replicated
in  PTSD  patients  from  other  populations  including
Holocaust survivors, refugees, and abused persons, is not
consistent across all studies.6 It has been suggested that

Figure 1. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is the body’s major response system for stress. The hypothalamus secretes CRH, which binds to recep-
tors on pituitary cells, which produce/release ACTH, which is transported to the adrenal gland where adrenal hormones such as cortisol are
produced/released.  The release of cortisol activates sympathetic nervous pathways and generates negative feedback to both the hypothala-
mus and the anterior pituitary. This negative feedback system appears to be compromised in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. CRH,

inconsistent findings may result from differences in the
severity and timing of psychological trauma, the patterns
of signs/symptoms, comorbid conditions, personality, and
genetic makeup.7 Studies using low-dose dexamethasone
suppression testing suggest that hypocortisolism in PTSD
occurs due to increased negative feedback sensitivity of
the HPA axis. Sensitized negative feedback inhibition is
supported by findings of increased glucocorticoid recep-
tor binding and function in patients with PTSD.6 Further,
sustained increases of CRH concentrations have been
measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with
PTSD. As such, blunted ACTH responses to CRH stim-
ulation implicate a role for the downregulation of pitu-
itary CRH receptors in patients with PTSD.6 In addition,
reduced volume of the hippocampus, the major brain
region inhibiting the HPA axis, is a cardinal feature of
PTSD.8 Taken as a whole, these neuroendocrine findings
in PTSD reflect dysregulation of the HPA axis to stres-
sors.6
In the context of the above discussion, prospective stud-
ies suggest that low cortisol levels at the time of expo-
sure to psychological trauma may predict the develop-
ment of PTSD.9,10 Therefore, hypocortisolism might be a
risk factor for maladaptive stress responses and predis-
pose to future PTSD. This hypothesis is supported in
principle by the finding that exogenously administered
hydrocortisone shortly after exposure to psychological
trauma can prevent PTSD.11,12 In addition, it has been
shown  that  simulation  of  a  normal  circadian  cortisol
rhythm using exogenously introduced hydrocortisone is
effective in the treatment of PTSD.13 In sum, it may be
that decreased availability of cortisol, as a result of or in
combination with abnormal regulation of the HPA axis,
may promote abnormal stress reactivity and perhaps
fear processing in general. That said, it should be noted
that glucocorticoids interfere with the retrieval of trau-
matic memories, an effect that may independently pre-
vent or reduce symptoms of PTSD.14

The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis 

The  hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  (HPT)  axis  is
involved in regulating metabolic versus anabolic states
and other homeostatic functions, which it does by con-
trolling the blood level of thyroid hormones. A possible
role for the HPT axis in stress-related syndromes has
been suspected for some time because it is known that
trauma can trigger thyroid abnormalities. To date, how-

ever, there has not been a significant research effort tar-
geting the relationship between the HPT axis and PTSD.
Studies  have  been  conducted,  however,  on  Vietnam
Veterans with PTSD who were found to have elevated
baseline levels of both tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thy-
roxine (T4). Of note, the level of T3 in these subjects was
disproportionately elevated relative to T4, implicating
an increase in the peripheral deiodinization process.15,16
These findings were replicated for the most part in a
study of WWII Veterans with more longstanding PTSD
diagnoses. In these individuals, isolated T3 levels were
elevated  whereas  T4  levels  were  normal.17 Taken
together, these studies suggest that over time the impact
of trauma on T4 levels may abate. The authors suggest
that elevated T3 may relate to subjective anxiety in these
individuals with PTSD. 

Neurochemical factors

Core neurochemical features of PTSD include abnormal
regulation of catecholamine, serotonin, amino acid, pep-
tide,  and  opioid  neurotransmitters,  each  of  which  is
found in brain circuits that regulate/integrate stress and
fear responses. Of note, catecholamine and serotonin (as
well  as  acetylcholine)  dysregulation  is  also  found  in
patients diagnosed with TBI, presumably as a result of
diffuse axonal injury.

The catecholamines

The catecholamine family of neurotransmitters, includ-
ing dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE), derive
from the amino acid tyrosine. Increased urinary excre-
tion  of  DA  and  its  metabolite  has  been  reported  in
patients with PTSD. Further, mesolimbic DA has been
implicated in fear conditioning. There is evidence in
humans that exposure to stressors induces mesolimbic
DA release, which in turn could modulate HPA axis
responses. Whether or not DA metabolism is altered in
PTSD remains unclear, though genetic variations in the
DA system have been implicated in moderating risk for
PTSD (see below). NE, on the other hand, is one of the
principal  mediators  of  autonomic  stress  responses
through both central and peripheral mechanisms. The
majority of CNS NE is derived from neurons of the
locus  ceruleus  (LC)  that  project  to  various  brain
regions involved in the stress response, including the
prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothala-

S t a t e   o f   t h e   a r t

mus, periaqueductal grey, and thalamus. In addition,
there is evidence for a feed-forward circuit connecting
the amygdala and hypothalamus with the LC, in which
CRH and NE interact to increase fear conditioning and
encoding of emotional memories, enhance arousal and
vigilance,  and  integrate  endocrine  and  autonomic
responses to stress. Like other stress pathways, this cas-
cade is inhibited by glucocorticoids,18 which serve as a
“brake” for the system. In the periphery, stress-induced
sympathetic nervous system activation results in the
release  of  NE  and  epinephrine  from  the  adrenal
medulla,  increased  release  of  NE  from  sympathetic
nerve endings, and changes in blood flow to a variety
of organs as needed for fight-or-flight behavior. The NE
effects  are  mediated  via  postsynaptic  α1,  β1,  and  β2
receptors, whereas another NE-activated receptor, the
α2 receptor,  serves  as  a  presynaptic  autoreceptor
inhibiting NE release. Because of its multiple roles in
regulating arousal and autonomic stress responses, as
well as promoting the encoding of emotional memories,
NE has been a central focus of many studies investi-
gating the pathophysiology of PTSD.
A cardinal feature of patients with PTSD is sustained
hyperactivity of the autonomic sympathetic branch of
the autonomic nervous system, as evidenced by eleva-
tions in heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, and
other  psychophysiological  measures.  Accordingly,
increased urinary excretion of catecholamines, and their
metabolites, has been documented in combat veterans,
abused women, and children with PTSD. In addition,
patients with PTSD exhibit increased heart rate, blood
pressure,  and  NE  responses  to  traumatic  reminders.
Decreased platelet α2 receptor binding further suggests
NE hyperactivity in PTSD.19,20 Administration of the α2
receptor  antagonist  yohimbine,  which  increases  NE
release,  induces  flashbacks  and  increased  autonomic
responses  in  patients  with  PTSD.21 Serial  sampling
revealed sustained increases in CSF NE concentrations
and increased CSF NE responses to psychological stres-
sors in PTSD.22,23 Taken together, there is an abundance
of evidence that NE accounts for certain classic aspects
of  PTSD  symptomatology,  including  hyperarousal,
heightened startle, and increased encoding of fear mem-
ories.20 
Interestingly,  prospective  studies  have  shown  that
increased heart rate and peripheral epinephrine excre-
tion at the time of exposure to trauma predict subse-
quent development of PTSD.10 Further, administration

of the centrally acting β-adrenergic receptor antagonist
propranolol  shortly  after  exposure  to  psychological
trauma has been reported to reduce PTSD symptom
severity and reactivity to trauma cues.24 Although pro-
pranolol administration in this study did not prevent the
development of PTSD, it may have blocked traumatic
memory consolidation,25 and therefore may reduce the
severity and/or chronicity of PTSD. It is important to
note, however, that this finding contradicts those from
an earlier study.26 Various antiadrenergic agents have
been tested for their therapeutic efficacy in the treat-
ment of PTSD in open-label trials; there is a paucity of
controlled trials.20

Serotonin

Serotonin (5HT), is a monoamine neurotransmitter syn-
thesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Neurons con-
taining 5HT originate in the dorsal and median raphé
nuclei in the brain stem and project to multiple forebrain
regions, including the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and prefrontal
cortex. 5HT has roles in regulating sleep, appetite, sex-
ual  behavior,  aggression/impulsivity,  motor  function,
analgesia, and neuroendocrine funtion. Not surprisingly,
given its connectivity and broad homeostatic role, 5HT
has been implicated in the modulation of affective and
stress responses, as well as a role in PTSD. Although the
mechanisms are not entirely clear, the effects of 5HT on
affective and stress responses vary according to stressor
intensity, brain region, and receptor type. It is believed
that 5HT neurons of the dorsal raphé mediate anxio-
genic effects via 5HT2 receptors through projections to
the amygdala and hippocampus. In contrast, 5HT neu-
rons from the median raphé are thought to mediate anx-
iolytic effects, facilitate extinction and suppress encod-
ing of learned associations via 5HT1A receptors. Chronic
exposure to stressors induces upregulation of 5HT2 and
downregulation of 5HT1A receptors in animal models.
Further,  5HT1A knockouts  exhibit  increased  stress
responses. 
The 5HT system interacts with the CRH and NE sys-
tems in coordinating affective and stress responses.19,27
Indirect  evidence  suggests  a  role  for  5HT  in  PTSD-
related behaviors including impulsivity, hostility, aggres-
sion, depression, and suicidality. In addition, 5HT pre-
sumably mediates the therapeutic effects of the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A recent small

and controversial study suggests that the street drug 
3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (also known as
MDMA or “ecstasy”), which alters central serotonin
transmission, has therapeutic potential in the treatment
of PTSD.28 Other evidence for altered 5HT neurotrans-
mission in PTSD includes decreased serum concentra-
tions of 5HT, decreased density of platelet 5HT uptake
sites, and altered responsiveness to CNS serotonergic
challenge in patients diagnosed with PTSD.19,27 However,
no  differences  in  CNS  5HT1A receptor  binding  were
detected in patients with PTSD compared with controls
using PET imaging.28 Taken together, altered 5HT trans-
mission may contribute to symptoms of PTSD including
hypervigilance, increased startle, impulsivity, and intru-
sive memories, though the exact roles and mechanisms
remain uncertain. 

Amino acids

γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory
neurotransmitter  in  the  brain.  GABA  has  profound
anxiolytic effects and dampens behavioral and physio-
logical responses to stressors, in part by inhibiting the
CRH/NE circuits involved in mediating fear and stress
responses. GABA’s effects are mediated by GABAA
receptors, which are colocalized with benzodiazepine
receptors  that  potentiate  the  inhibitory  effects  of
GABA on postsynaptic elements. Uncontrollable stress
leads  to  alterations  of  the  GABAA/benzodiazepine
receptor complex such that patients with PTSD exhibit
decreased  peripheral  benzodiazepine  binding  sites.29
Further,  SPECT  and  PET  imaging  studies  have
revealed decreased binding of radiolabeled benzodi-
azepine receptor ligands in the cortex, hippocampus,
and thalamus of patients with PTSD, suggesting that
decreased density or receptor affinity may play a role in
PTSD.30,31 However,  treatment  with  benzodiazepines
after exposure to psychological trauma does not pre-
vent PTSD.32,33 Further, a recent study suggests that trau-
matic exposure at times of intoxication actually facili-
tates  the  development  of  PTSD.34 Although  perhaps
counterintuitive, the authors suggest that the contextual
misperceptions which commonly accompany alcohol
intoxication may serve to make stressful experiences
more  difficult  to  incorporate  intellectually,  thereby
exacerbating fear. Taken together, while there are mul-
tiple studies strongly implicating the GABA/benzodi-
azepine receptor system in anxiety disorders, studies in

PTSD are relatively sparse and conclusive statements
would be premature.19
Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in
the brain. Exposure to stressors and the release of, or
administration of, glucocorticoids activates glutamate
release in the brain. Among a number of receptor sub-
types,  glutamate  binds  to  N-methyl  D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors that are localized throughout the
brain. The NMDA receptor system has been implicated
in synaptic plasticity, as well as learning and memory,
thereby contributing in all likelihood to consolidation of
trauma memories in PTSD. The NMDA receptor system
is also believed to play a central role in the derealization
phenomena and dissocation associated with illicit and
medical uses of the anesthetic ketamine. In addition to
its role in learning and memory, overexposure of neu-
rons to glutamate is known to be excitotoxic, and may
contribute  to  the  loss  of  neurons  and/or  neuronal
integrity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of
patients with PTSD. Of additional note, elevated gluco-
corticoids increase the expression and/or sensitivity of
NMDA receptors, which may render the brain generally
more vulnerable to excitoxic insults at times of stress. 

Peptides

CRH neurons in the hypothalamic PVN integrate infor-
mation relevant to stress and thereby serve as a major
component  of  the  HPA  axis.  CRH  neurons  are  also
found  in  widespread  circuitry  throughout  the  brain,
including the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, central
nucleus of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria ter-
minalis, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, periaqueduc-
tal gray, and locus coeruleus (LC) as well as both dorsal
and  median  raphé.  Direct  injection  of  CRH  into  the
brain of laboratory animals produces physiological stress
responses and anxiety-like behavior, including neopho-
bia (fear of new things or experiences), enhanced star-
tle, and facilitated fear conditioning. Anxiety-like behav-
iors have been specifically linked with increased activity
of amygdalar CRH-containing neurons that project to
the LC. Of note, glucocorticoids inhibit CRH-induced
activation  of  LC  noradrenergic  neurons,  providing  a
potential mechanism by which low cortisol may facilitate
sustained central stress and fear responses. 
The effects of CRH are mediated primarily through two
CRH receptor subtypes, CRH1 and CRH2. In animal
experiments, both exogenous administration of a CRH1

receptor antagonist, and experimental knockout of the
CRH1 receptor, produce attenuated stress responses and
reduced anxiety. A recent experiment demonstrated that
CRH1 receptor blockade impacted not only gastroin-
testinal measures of chronic stress, but also prevented
stress-induced hair loss in rodents.35 Thus, CRH1 recep-
tor  stimulation  may  be  involved  in  facilitating  stress
responses  and  anxiety.  By  contrast,  CRH2 knockout
mice demonstrate stress sensitization and increased anx-
iety, suggesting a role for CRH2 receptor activation in
reducing stress reactivity.3 Given the central effects of
CRH, as described in animal models, increased CNS
CRH activity may promote certain of the cardinal fea-
tures  of  PTSD,  such  as  conditioned  fear  responses,
increased startle reactivity, sensitization to stressor expo-
sure, and hyperarousal. These results suggest that CRH1
receptor antagonists and/or CRH2 agonists might have
important  therapeutic  potential  in  the  treatment  of
PTSD.
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) may well be protective against
the development of PTSD in that it has anxiolytic and
stress-buffering  properties.  NPY  has  been  shown  to
inhibit  CRH/NE  circuits  involved  in  stress  and  fear
responses and to reduce the release of NE from sympa-
thetic neurons. As such, a lack of NPY may promote
maladaptive  stress  responses  and  contribute  to  the
development of PTSD. Indeed, patients with PTSD have
been reported to exhibit decreased plasma NPY con-
centrations and blunted NPY responses to yohimbine
challenge, compared with controls. Together, these find-
ings suggest that decreased NPY activity may contribute
to noradrenergic hyperactivity in PTSD.36 Moreover, it
has been suggested that NPY may be involved in pro-
moting recovery from, or perhaps resilience to PTSD,
given that combat veterans without PTSD have been
shown to exhibit elevated NPY levels compared with
veterans with PTSD.6
Endogenous opioid peptides including the endorphins
and enkephalins act upon the same CNS receptors acti-
vated by exogenous opioid molecules such as morphine
or heroin. Endogenous opioids exert inhibitory influ-
ences on the HPA axis. Naloxone, an opioid receptor
antagonist, increases HPA axis activation as evidenced
by exaggerated HPA axis response to naloxone. PTSD
patients exhibit increased CSF β-endorphin levels, sug-
gesting increased activation of the endogenous opioid
system.  Alterations  in  endogenous  opioids  may  be
involved in certain PTSD symptoms such as numbing,

stress-induced analgesia, and dissociation. Of additional
interest, the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, nal-
trexone, appears to be effective in treating symptoms of
dissociation and flashbacks in traumatized persons.19,37
Further,  the  administration  of  morphine  has  been
reported  to  prevent  PTSD.38 Of  note,  an  experiment
investigating the hypothesis that PTSD may play an eti-
ologic role in fostering opioid addiction in an opioid-
dependent group of subjects rendered negative results.39

Brain circuitry

Characteristic changes in brain structure and function
have been identified in patients with PTSD using brain-
imaging methods.40-42 Brain regions that are altered in
patients with PTSD include the hippocampus and amyg-
dala as well as cortical regions including the anterior cin-
gulate,  insula,  and  orbitofrontal  region.  These  areas
interconnect  to  form  a  neural  circuit  that  mediates,
among other functions, adaptation to stress and fear con-
ditioning. Changes in these circuits have been proposed
to  have  a  direct  link  to  the  development  of  PTSD.40
Recent work raises the question as to which CNS ele-
ments  are  involved  in  circuit  changes  resulting  from
stress, and suggests a critical role for myelin.43 Similar to
PTSD, brain areas most impacted by TBI include infe-
rior  frontal  and  temporal  lobes,  and  it  is  likely  that
myelinated circuits are subject to damage broadly as a
result of shear forces.

Hippocampus

A hallmark feature of PTSD is reduced hippocampal
volume. The hippocampus is implicated in the control of
stress responses, declarative memory, and contextual
aspects of fear conditioning. Not surprisingly, the hip-
pocampus is one of the most plastic regions in the brain.
As mentioned above, prolonged exposure to stress and
high levels of glucocorticoids in laboratory animals dam-
ages the hippocampus, leading to reduction in dendritic
branching, loss of dendritic spines, and impairment of
neurogenesis.4 Initial  magnetic  resonance  imaging
(MRI) studies demonstrated smaller hippocampal vol-
umes in Vietnam Veterans with PTSD and patients with
abuse-related PTSD compared with controls.44-47 Small
hippocampal volumes were associated with the severity
of trauma and memory impairments in these studies.
These findings were generally replicated in most but not

all subsequent work. Studies using proton magnetic res-
onance spectroscopy further observed reduced levels of
N-acetyl  aspartate  (NAA),  a  marker  of  neuronal
integrity,  in  the  hippocampus  of  adult  patients  with
PTSD.40 Of note, NAA reductions were correlated with
cortisol levels.48 Interestingly, reduced hippocampal vol-
ume has been observed in depressed women with a his-
tory  of  early  life  trauma49 but  not  in  children  with
PTSD.50
Hippocampal volume reduction in PTSD may reflect the
accumulated  toxic  effects  of  repeated  exposure  to
increased glucocorticoid levels or increased glucocorti-
coid sensitivity, though recent evidence also suggests that
decreased hippocampal volumes might be a pre-existing
vulnerability factor for developing PTSD.24 Indeed, hip-
pocampal deficits may promote activation of and failure
to terminate stress responses, and may also contribute to
impaired extinction of conditioned fear as well as deficits
in discriminating between safe and unsafe environmen-
tal contexts. Studies using functional neuroimaging have
further shown that PTSD patients have deficits in hip-
pocampal activation during a verbal declarative mem-
ory task.51 Both hippocampal atrophy and functional
deficits reverse to a considerable extent after treatment
with SSRIs,52 which have been demonstrated to increase
neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis in some preclin-
ical studies,5 but not others.53

Amygdala

The amygdala is a limbic structure involved in emotional
processing  and  is  critical  for  the  acquisition  of  fear
responses. The functional role of the amygdala in medi-
ating both stress responses and emotional learning impli-
cate its role in the pathophysiology of PTSD. Although
there is no clear evidence for structural alterations of the
amygdala  in  PTSD,  functional  imaging  studies  have
revealed hyper-responsiveness in PTSD during the pre-
sentation  of  stressful  scripts,  cues,  and/or  trauma
reminders.41 PTSD patients further show increased amyg-
dala responses to general emotional stimuli that are not
trauma-associated, such as emotional faces.41 The amyg-
dala also seems to be sensitized to the presentation of
subliminally threatening cues in patients with PTSD,54-56
and  increased  activation  of  the  amygdala  has  been
reported in PTSD patients during fear acquisition in a
conditioning experiment.57 Given that increased amyg-
dala reactivity has been linked to genetic traits which

moderate risk for PTSD,58,59 increased amygdala reactiv-
ity may represent a biological risk factor for developing
PTSD. 

Cortex

The medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) comprises the ante-
rior cingulate cortex (ACC), subcallosal cortex, and the
medial frontal gyrus. The medial PFC exerts inhibitory
control over stress responses and emotional reactivity in
part by its connections with the amygdala. It further
mediates extinction of conditioned fear through active
inhibition  of  acquired  fear  responses.41 Patients  with
PTSD exhibit decreased volumes of the frontal cortex,60
including reduced ACC volumes.61,62 This reduction in
ACC volume has been correlated with PTSD symptom
severity in some studies. In addition, an abnormal shape
of the ACC,63 as well as a decrease of NAA levels in the
ACC,64 has been reported for PTSD patients. A recent
twin study suggests that, unlike the hippocampus, vol-
ume loss in the ACC is secondary to the development of
PTSD rather than a pre-existing risk factor.65 Functional
imaging studies have found decreased activation of the
medial PFC in PTSD patients in response to stimuli,
such as trauma scripts,66,67 combat pictures and sounds,68
trauma-unrelated negative narratives,69 fearful faces,70
emotional stroop,71 and others, though there are also dis-
cordant findings.41 Reduced activation of the medial PFC
was associated with PTSD symptom severity in several
studies and successful SSRI treatment has been shown
to restore medial prefrontal cortical activation patterns.41
Of note, in the abovementioned conditioning experi-
ment,57 extinction of conditioned fear was associated
with decreased activation of the ACC, providing a bio-
logical correlate for imprinted traumatic memories in
PTSD. Not surprisingly, given the connectivity between
the amygdala and medial PFC, interactions in activation
patterns between these regions have been reported in
PTSD, though the direction of the relationship is incon-
sistent across studies.41

The origin of neurobiological 
abnormalities in PTSD

A number of studies have investigated the fundamental
question as to whether the neurobiological changes iden-
tified in patients with PTSD represent markers of neural
risk to develop PTSD upon exposure to extreme stress

2 7 1

PAGES_ 12_AG_1004_BA.qxd:DCNS#50  30/08/11  16:04  Page 272

S t a t e   o f   t h e   a r t

as opposed to abnormalities acquired through traumatic
exposure or, most likely, a combination of both. As an
example, low cortisol levels at the time of a trauma pre-
dict subsequent development of PTSD. Thus, low levels
of cortisol might be a pre-existing risk factor that engen-
ders the development of PTSD; low levels of cortisol
could disinhibit CRH/NE circuits and thereby promote
unopposed autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to
stress, as well as augmented fear conditioning and trau-
matic memory consolidation. Similarly, the reduced size
of the hippocampus in PTSD has remained an unre-
solved question for many years. There has been consid-
erable debate as to whether this brain region shrinks as
a result of trauma exposure, or whether the hippocam-
pus of PTSD patients might be smaller prior to trauma
exposure. Studies in twins discordant for trauma expo-
sure have provided a means to address this question,
though without complete resolution. Gilbertson and col-
leagues72 studied 40 pairs of identical twins, including
Vietnam Veterans who were exposed to combat trauma
and their twins who did not serve in Vietnam, and mea-
sured hippocampal volumes in all subjects. As expected,
among Vietnam Veterans, the hippocampus was smaller
in those diagnosed with PTSD as compared with those
without  a  diagnosis.  However,  this  brain  region  was
abnormally smaller in non-PTSD twins as well, despite
the absence of trauma exposure and diagnosis. These
findings suggest that a smaller hippocampus could be a
pre-existing, potentially genetic, neurodevelopmental,
and almost surely multifactorial vulnerability factor that
predisposes to the development of PTSD (and perhaps
other stress-spectrum disorders). Recent results from the
same study group indicate, as above, that gray matter
loss in the ACC seems on the contrary to be an acquired
feature.65 Studies  are  needed  to  identify  the  timing
and/or etiology of other hallmark neurobiological fea-
tures of PTSD. 

Risk and resilience for developing PTSD

Individuals exposed to an event that either threatens
serious injury/death, or is perceived as such, respond in
different ways. Most will experience minimal (seconds)
to brief (hours) to short-term (days/weeks) abnormali-
ties while a smaller number will suffer from significant
psychopathology over longer-term (months) and chronic
(lifetime) time frames. In short, not all individuals who
face potentially catastrophic trauma go on to develop

PTSD. Why some individuals will develop PTSD fol-
lowing trauma, whereas others do not, is of paramount
importance. Because the majority of trauma survivors
do not go on to develop PTSD, it is crucial going forward
to understand vulnerability and resiliency factors. In this
section, the role of genetic factors, gender differences,
and early developmental stress experiences in moderat-
ing risk for developing PTSD in response to psycholog-
ical  trauma  are  discussed  as  is  the  increased  risk  for
developing PTSD in the context of co-occurring physi-
cal traumas (including TBI).

Genetic risk factors for PTSD

Studies on the genetics of PTSD have been hampered
by a variety of factors, such as genetic heterogeneity
(similar phenotypes develop from different genotypes)
and incomplete phenotypic penetrance (a person with
genetic risk for PTSD, who is not exposed to trauma, will
not develop PTSD). Despite these confounds, there is
accumulating  evidence  that  risk  for  PTSD  is  heavily
influenced by genetic factors. Evidence from family and
twin studies has long suggested a heritable contribution
to the development of PTSD. In addition, there is evi-
dence for heritable contributions to some of the neuro-
biological endophenotypes of PTSD as discussed above,
such as decreased hippocampal volume72 or exaggerated
amygdala reactivity.58 Although it is beyond the scope of
this review to comprehensively discuss the genetics of
PTSD, it should be noted that there is an emerging lit-
erature on genetic variations in those neurobiological
systems  that  drive  responses  to  trauma  and,  conse-
quently, risk versus resilience to develop PTSD.73
One study has linked a polymorphism in the DA trans-
porter gene to PTSD risk. In this study, PTSD patients
were found to have an excess of the SLC6A39 repeat
allele. This finding suggests that genetically determined
features  of  DA  transmission  may  contribute  to  the
development of PTSD among trauma survivors.74 Several
studies have suggested polymorphisms in the D2 recep-
tor as possible elements of PTSD risk, though results
have not been consistent.73 In addition, there is evidence
linking a low expression variant of the serotonin trans-
porter to stress responsiveness and risk for developing
depression in relation to life stress, particularly in the
presence of low social support.59 This finding is intrigu-
ing  as  the  same  polymorphism  is  associated  with
increased amygdala reactivity58 as well as the trait of

2 7 2

neuroticism,75 which is another risk factor for PTSD. It
must be noted, however, that these findings of genetic
risk  with  regard  to  the  serotonin  transporter  have
recently been questioned.76
Particularly exciting are findings that a genetic variation
of  the  glucocorticoid  receptor  cochaperone  protein,
FKBP5, moderates risk of developing PTSD in relation
to childhood abuse.77 This study tested interactions of
childhood abuse, adulthood trauma, and genetic poly-
morphisms in the FKBP5 gene in 900 nonpsychiatric,
general  internal  medicine  clinic  patients.  Childhood
abuse  and  adulthood  trauma  each  predicted  PTSD
symptoms  and  FKBP5 polymorphisms  significantly
interacted with childhood abuse to predict adult PTSD
symptoms. The FKBP5 genotype was further linked to
enhanced glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity, as reflected
by dexamethasone hypersuppression, a hallmark feature
of PTSD.77 Most recently, Ressler and colleagues have
demonstrated that a female-specific elevation of pitu-
itary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) cor-
related not only with fear physiology and the diagnosis
of PTSD78 but also a specific single nucleotide repeat on
an  estrogen  response  element  in  the  same  subjects.
These findings and this type of work may shed new light
not only on the well-known differences in PTSD risk
between men and women that are discussed in the next
section, but on our mechanistic understanding of PTSD
in general.

Gender differences and risk for PTSD

Women more frequently suffer from PTSD than men for
reasons that are not entirely clear. Women and men are,
in general, subjected to different types of trauma, though
the differences in PTSD frequency (reportedly 2:1) are
unlikely to be explained solely on the basis of exposure
type and/or severity alone. In addition to those findings
by Ressler described above, a number of gender-related
differences in the neurobiological response to trauma
have been documented.79 Rodent studies suggest that
females generally exhibit greater magnitude and dura-
tion of HPA axis responses to stress than males,80 though
findings in humans are not entirely consistent.81 Sex dif-
ferences in neuroendocrine stress responses have been
attributed to direct effects of circulating estrogen on
CRH neurons.82 Sex steroids also interact with other
neurotransmitter systems involved in the stress response,
such as the serotonin system.83 Progesterone has been

implicated  in  modulating  these  systems  as  well.84
However, gender differences in HPA responses to stress
have also been observed independent of acute gonadal
steroid effects.85
Factors that might determine gender differences in the
stress response include genomic differences (as above)
and/or developmentally programmed effects of gonadal
steroids.81,85,86 Of  note,  a  very  recent  study  of  female
Veterans demonstrated that pregnancy raises the risk of
PTSD above that for nonpregnant females.87 In addition,
sex steroids play a role in structural plasticity across the
lifespan of several brain regions, including areas involved
in stress responsiveness such as the hippocampus and
amygdala.86 Functional imaging studies have identified
gender differences in the brain’s response to fear stim-
uli.88 Over time our understanding of this constellation
of processes may eventually converge to allow for a bet-
ter description of the basis for gender differences and,
specifically, how the consequences of trauma translate
into differential risk for PTSD. 

Early developmental factors and PTSD

Previous  experience  moderates  risk  for  developing
PTSD in response to trauma, particularly when exposure
to stress occurs early in life. Thus, childhood adversity is
associated  with  increased  risk  to  develop  PTSD  in
response  to  combat  exposure  in Vietnam Veterans.51
There is a burgeoning literature documenting that early
adverse experience, including prenatal stress and stress
throughout childhood, has profound and long-lasting
effects on the development of neurobiological systems,
thereby “programming” subsequent stress reactivity and
vulnerability to develop PTSD.89-91 As an example, chil-
dren with a history of date violence have recently been
shown at risk of developing future PTSD.92 Further, a
study of child survivors from the Hurricane Katrina dis-
aster indicates significantly increased risk of PTSD.93
Along these lines, nonhuman primates exposed to a vari-
able foraging demand condition, which causes unpre-
dictable maternal care in the infant, leads to an adult
phenotype with sensitization to fear cues, CRH hyper-
activity and low cortisol levels, a pattern of the classic
features found in PTSD.94 Consistent with these findings,
adult women with childhood trauma histories exhibit
sensitization of both neuroendocrine, and autonomic
stress responses.95 Studies are needed that identify par-
ticular sensitive periods for the effects of early stress,

determine parameters for their reversal, and scrutinize
the interactions of dispositional factors (genes, gender)
with developmental features in determining neurobio-
logical vulnerability to PTSD.

The influence of physical trauma (and TBI) on the
development of PTSD 

It has been known for some time that physical injury con-
comitant with psychological trauma increases risk for the
development of PTSD. In studies of Vietnam Veterans,96,97
and more recently in a study of Iraq and Afghanistan
Veterans,98 it was found that physical injury increased the
risk  of  PTSD  at  least  twofold.  Similarly,  a  literature
review of patients with documented TBI and program
evaluation data from surveys of US Marines following
blast exposures in Iraq99 demonstrate that TBI presents
an increased risk for the development of PTSD. Though
differentiating the risk of developing PTSD in patients
with TBI is complicated by the subjective and objective
abnormalities common to both clinical entities, it is strik-
ing that each shares common endocrine, neurochemical,
and  circuit  abnormalities  (see  above,  The  biology  of
PTSD). As such, it would follow that the existence of
both diagnoses in an individual patient might be additive
if not multiplicative from a clinical standpoint. For exam-
ple, in the context of TBI (with frontal lobe damage and
behavioral  disinhibition)  it  would  be  reasonable  to
expect a very high violence risk profile for a patient suf-
fering from the irritability and anger characteristic of
comorbid PTSD. Of additional note, the helplessness that
accompanies  certain  physical  injuries  (perhaps  most
notably TBI) is certain to compound issues of limited
self-efficacy (and the overall lost sense of agency) that
characterize PTSD. The psychological challenges of TBI
may thereby introduce an additional chronic risk for the
victimization that fosters PTSD in those patients with a
tendency to become increasingly dependent over time.

A basic model of PTSD neurobiology

The biological perturbations observed in patients suffer-
ing from PTSD are numerous, and likely reflect an endur-
ing dysregulation of multiple stress-mediating systems that
occurs as a result of a psychological “shock.” These patho-
physiological perturbations presumably occur in patients
with genetic, epigenetic, and experiential predispositions
when exposed to certain extreme conditions. Presumably

these changes signify an indelible sensory imprint of a mal-
adaptively processed experience that co-opts an imbal-
anced  degree  of  emotional  importance  and  thereafter
releases (or restrains) behavioral reactions that focus on
defending against future trauma via activation (or deac-
tivation) in a losing effort to secure homeostasis. 
Considering neurobiological findings in PTSD patients
with this overview in mind, a relative lack of baseline
cortisol at the time of a psychological trauma may facil-
itate overactivation of the central CRH-NE cascade,
resulting in enhanced and prolonged stress responses.6,95
This  increased  stress  responsiveness  may  be  further
accentuated by inadequate regulatory effects of GABA,
serotonin, and NPY. Additionally, altered norpinephrine
and stress hormone activity may be critically involved in
processes of learning and extinction, both of which are
abnormal  in  PTSD;  for  example,  norepinephrine
enhances the encoding of fear memories and glucoco-
corticoids block the retrieval of emotional memories.
The constellation of elevated noradrenergic activity and
relative  hypocortisolism  may  lead  to  the  enhanced
encoding of traumatic memories and the lack of inhibi-
tion of memory retrieval both of which presumably trig-
ger re-experiencing phenomena in PTSD.12
Further, an abnormally functioning hippocampus may
account for some of the cognitive symptoms of PTSD,
such as declarative memory deficits. In addition, because
the hippocampus is critical for context conditioning, an
impaired hippocampus may facilitate generalization of
learned fear in contexts unrelated to a previous trau-
matic exposure and impair the ability to discriminate
between safe and unsafe stimuli. In combination with
exaggerated amygdalar responses seen in patients with
PTSD, a limited capacity for discerning threat due to
hippocampal and amygdalar dysfunction may promote
paranoia, hypervigilance, behavioral activation, exag-
gerated stress responses, and further acquisition of fear
associations. Disrupted prefrontal cortical function may
then  serve  to  facilitate  PTSD  pathology  further  as  a
result of deficient suppression of stress responses, fear
associations, and extinction. 

Future directions

In this article, we have selected findings from a broad
range of the PTSD literature to consider the impact of
psychological  trauma  on  neurobiological  systems. As
described, some neurobiological findings in patients with

PTSD are controversial and need to be further examined.
In  addition,  there  are  a  number  of  understudied  yet
important topics in the field such as factors that impact
resiliency and vulnerability. For example, stress-protec-
tive neurobiological factors such as activity in oxytocin
and NPY-containing circuits could, in principle, be manip-
ulated to promote resilience. In addition, there is a gen-
eral need to explore further the molecular biology of
PTSD; identifying interactions between dispositional fac-
tors (genetic and epigenetic) and trauma exposure is crit-
ical to understand PTSD risk, gauge illness course, and
predict treatment response. The effects of trauma on neu-
rotrophic factors (in the hippocampus), neural plasticity
(CNS-wide), circuit remodeling (myelination patterns)

illness duration. Though difficult, such studies will neces-
sitate accessing, assaying and following populations at
risk for exposure to trauma before any exposure occurs

reflejas de supervivencia que siguen a la exposición
a la amenaza percibida en algunas circunstancias
pueden constituirse en procesos mal regulados. La
mala regulación crónica de estos sistemas puede lle-
var a un deterioro funcional en ciertos individuos
quienes pueden convertirse en “traumatizados psi-
cológicamente” y presentar un trastorno por estrés
postraumático (TEPT). Una gran cantidad de infor-
mación acumulada en varias décadas ha demostrado
alteraciones neurobiológicas en los pacientes con
TEPT. Algunos de estos hallazgos permiten aden-
trarse en la fisiopatología así como en la vulnerabili-
dad biológica de ciertas poblaciones que van a desa-
rrollar un TEPT. Algunas características patológicas
encontradas en pacientes con TEPT se sobreponen
con características de pacientes con daño cerebral
traumático, estableciendo un paralelo de signos y
síntomas compartidos entre estos síndromes clínicos.

La  réponse  classique  de  lutte  ou  de  fuite  à  une
menace perçue est un phénomène nerveux réflexe
dont les avantages pour la survie sont évidents en
termes d’évolution. Cependant, les systèmes orga-
nisés en constellation  de comportements réflexes
de survie après exposition à une menace perçue
peuvent se déréguler dans certaines circonstances.
Une dysrégulation chronique de ces systèmes peut
entraîner un déficit fonctionnel chez certains sujets
qui deviennent « psychologiquement traumatisés »
et souffrent de l’état de stress post-traumatique
(ESPT). Des données recueillies pendant des dizai-
nes d’années montrent des anomalies neurobiolo-
giques chez les patients souffrant d’ESPT, ce qui per-
met de mieux comprendre la physiopathologie de
l’ESPT ainsi que la vulnérabilité biologique de cer-
taines populations à développer un ESPT. Certaines
caractéristiques pathologiques de l’ESPT se super-
posent à celles trouvées chez des patients atteints
de lésion cérébrale traumatique, en parallèle avec
les signes et les symptômes partagés par ces deux
syndromes.
