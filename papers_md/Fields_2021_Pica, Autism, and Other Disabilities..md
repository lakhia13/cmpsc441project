Abstract

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:  Pica, the repeated ingestion of nonfood items, can be 
life-threatening. Although case reports describe pica in children with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) or intellectual disability (ID), there has been little systematic study of pica prevalence. We 
assessed pica in children 30 to 68 months of age (median = 55.4 months) with and without ASD.

METHODS:  Our sample from the Study to Explore Early Development, a multisite case-control 
study, included children with ASD (n = 1426), children with other developmental disabilities 
(DDs) (n = 1735), and general population-based controls (POPs) (n = 1578). We subdivided 
the ASD group according to whether children had ID and the DD group according to whether 
they had ID and/or some ASD characteristics. Standardized developmental assessments and/or 
questionnaires were used to define final study groups, subgroups, and pica. We examined pica 
prevalence in each group and compared ASD and DD groups and subgroups to the POP group 
using prevalence ratios adjusted for sociodemographic factors.

RESULTS:  Compared with the prevalence of pica among POPs (3.5%), pica was higher in 
children with ASD (23.2%) and DD (8.4%), and in the following subgroups: ASD with ID 
(28.1%), ASD without ID (14.0%), DD with ID (9.7%), DD with ASD characteristics (12.0%),

and DD with both ID and ASD characteristics (26.3%); however, pica prevalence was not elevated 
in children with DD with neither ID nor ASD characteristics (3.2%). Between-group differences 
remained after adjustment (adjusted prevalence ratio range 1.9–8.0, all P <.05).

CONCLUSIONS:  Pica may be common in young children with ASD, ASD characteristics, and 
ID. These findings inform the specialized health care needs of these children.

Pica, the repeated ingestion of nonfood items lacking nutritional value,1,2 can result 
in gastrointestinal parasites, lead toxicity, nutritional deficiencies, choking, poisoning, 
sepsis, and intestinal obstruction or perforation.3–6 These complications are associated with 
substantial morbidity and have led to fatalities in some patients.2,7,8

Pica is considered a self-injurious behavior, defined as self-inflicted, harmful behavior that 
occurs without apparent intent of willful self-harm.5,7,9–11 Individuals with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual disability (ID) have higher rates of self-injurious behavior 
(all types) than the general population,12,13 and pica specifically has been implicated as a 
problem for these populations.

However, studies of pica in individuals with ASD and other developmental disabilities 
(DDs) are limited. Available information is primarily from published case series and 
reports.2,3,14–21 In few studies has pica prevalence in individuals with ASD been 
systematically assessed. In their prospective population-based cohort study, Emond et al22 
reported that children who were eventually diagnosed with ASD were more likely to have 
increased pica behavior at 38 and 54 months (12.3% and 12.5%, respectively) than controls 
(2.3% and 0.7%). Neumeyer et al23 assessed children with ASD who were treated at 15 
Autism Treatment Network sites; they reported pica prevalence was 3.0% in children <6 
years old and 2.4% in children >6 years old. In a literature review conducted by Matson et 
al,1 pica prevalence estimates in children or adults with ASD and/or ID ranged from 4% to 
26%; the highest estimates were found in populations that were institutionalized because of 
their disabilities. Because most studies in this review were limited to severe cases of pica 
resulting in intervention. the total prevalence of pica is likely higher than reported in these 
studies.

Previous studies were limited by small sample sizes, nonstandardized classification of 
ASD or DD, nonrepresentative (clinical) samples, and the lack of a general population 
comparison group. There is a need for more comprehensive epidemiological assessments of 
pica prevalence in children with ASD and other DDs, such that health care providers and 
parents are aware of the potential risks and can implement appropriate prevention measures 
and, if needed, initiate behavioral treatments early.

We evaluated pica in preschool-aged children with and without ASD using data from the 
Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a large multisite case-control study. SEED 
included a diverse sample of children with ASD and other DDs, a general population-based 
control (POP) group, and a collection of detailed information about children’s development 
to systematically classify case status and case subtypes.

METHODS

Study Design

Page 3

The SEED methodology has been previously described.24 Briefly, SEED data were collected 
in 2 phases (2007–2012 and 2013–2016) from 6 US study sites (located in CA, CO, 
GA, MD, NC, and PA). At each site, children with ASD and other DDs were recruited 
from multiple special education and clinical sources that provide services to children with 
disabilities. Children recruited from each source were those with select special education or 
International Classification of Disease codes indicative of ASD or other DDs often seen as 
precursors or cooccurring diagnoses in children eventually diagnosed with ASD. POP group 
children were recruited on the basis of randomly selected birth records; they were sampled 
from the same birth years and study sites but were not otherwise matched to the case groups. 
This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention and each site.

Participants and Study Group Classification

Children eligible for SEED enrollment were those who lived in the respective site’s study 
area both at birth and at enrollment and lived with a caregiver since at least 6 months of age 
who could provide legal consent and communicate in English (all sites) or Spanish (2 sites). 
The child was required to live with the biological mother in the second phase of SEED data 
collection but not the first; nonetheless, the respondent for 98% of children in the first phase 
was the biological mother. Therefore, in this report, we refer to the respondent as the mother. 
Children were 30 to 68 months of age (median = 55.4 months) at the time of their SEED 
developmental assessment.

This analysis included children from all 3 study groups (ASD, DD, and POP) who 
were not missing data on pica. Although children were initially identified as eligible 
for 1 of the 3 study groups, final study classification was determined by standardized 
research developmental assessment results.25 After enrollment, mothers of all children 
were administered the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)26 to screen for ASD 
symptoms in their child. Children with scores ≥11 were considered potential ASD cases 
regardless of their initial classification. Additionally, children who had a previous ASD 
diagnosis or special education classification were considered potential ASD cases regardless 
of their SCQ scores. All children were administered an in-person general developmental 
assessment, the Mullen Scales of Early Learning.27 Children in the potential ASD group 
were additionally administered the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,28 and their 
caregivers were administered the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised.29 Children who met 
the study criteria for ASD on the basis of their Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and 
Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised assessments were classified as ASD cases25; children 
who had been classified as potential ASD cases on the basis of symptoms or past diagnoses 
but did not meet the study ASD case criteria were classified as DD with ASD characteristics. 
Children selected for the DD group who had an SCQ score <11 and no previous ASD 
educational classification or diagnosis were classified as DD without ASD characteristics. A 
small number of children recruited to the POP group screened positive on the SCQ and met 
study criteria for ASD; they received a final ASD study classification.

Pica Data

We further divided children with ASD, DD with ASD characteristics, and DD without ASD 
characteristics according to whether they had cooccurring ID. ID was defined as a Mullen 
Scales of Early Learning developmental score (which is considered comparable to IQ) 
<70.27 Thus, we examined 6 subgroups of children: (1) ASD with ID, (2) ASD without ID, 
(3) DD with ID and ASD characteristics, (4) DD with ID but without ASD characteristics, 
(S) DD with ASD characteristics but without ID, and (6) DD with neither ID nor ASD 
characteristics.

Mothers completed structured telephone interviews and self-administered forms. Data 
collected included sociodemographic characteristics and child health conditions and 
behaviors. The Child Behavior Checklist,30 a standardized self-administered form, asked 
respondents to indicate whether their child had exhibited problem behaviors within the 
previous 2 months. Response options for each item were “not true,” “somewhat or 
sometimes true,” and “very true or often true.” Pica was ascertained via the item, “child 
eats or drinks things that are not food-not including sweets.” If this item was answered 
affirmatively, the respondent was asked to describe the consumed substance. We considered 
a child to have pica if the mother responded, “somewhat or sometimes true” or “very true 
or often true.” We reviewed free text responses on item(s) the child had eaten to assess the 
accuracy of responses to the pica question. Although free text data were collected in both 
phases of SEED, only data from the second phase of SEED had been processed and made 
available for this assessment; nonetheless, we have no reason to believe responses differed 
between the 2 study phases. Our review indicated the Child Behavior Checklist pica question 
was accurately capturing pica; >95% of respondents specified their child was consuming 1 
or more nonfood items, only 2% incorrectly specified a food item, and a few responses were 
too vague to classify. Examples of nonfood items reported are presented in Supplemental 
Table 3.

Data Analysis

We compared distributions of sociodemographic factors according to whether the child had 
pica and by main study group (ASD versus POP and DD versus POP) using χ2 tests. We 
assessed the prevalence of children who engaged in pica by main study group and for each 
of the aforementioned subgroups. We calculated unadjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 
adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals, in which the prevalence of 
pica for each ASD and DD case group and subgroup was compared with the prevalence for 
the POP group. aPRs were calculated by using modified Poisson regression31; in addition to 
ASD or DD cases status, models included child sex, child and maternal age at enrollment, 
maternal race or ethnicity, maternal education, and household income.

We conducted supplemental analyses to examine (1) whether associations observed in 
our main analysis varied within various demographic strata (same factors as included in 
adjustment models) and (2) whether associations were similar using a more restrictive pica 
definition (by which only “very true or often true” counted as pica). For stratified analyses, 
we calculated stratum-specific PRs and used the Mantel-Haenszel method32 to estimate 
pooled aPRs.

RESULTS

Overall, 4739 children were included in this analysis: 1426 with ASD, 1735 with other DDs, 
and 1578 POPs (Fig 1)

In all 3 study groups, most mothers were >35 years of age, were non-Hispanic white 
(NHW), had a bachelor’s degree or higher, and had a household income >$50 000 (Table 1). 
Nonetheless, we observed study group differences; mothers of children with ASD and DD 
were significantly less likely to be NHW, have a bachelor’s degree, or have a high household 
income than mothers of POP group children. There were markedly more males in the 
ASD and DD groups than the POP group. Mothers of children with pica were significantly 
younger and less likely to be NHW, have a bachelor’s degree, or have a high household 
income than mothers of children without pica. Children with pica were more likely to be 
male. More than 70% of children in all study and pica groups were 48 to 68 months of age 
with slight differences observed between study groups.

Pica was reported in 23.2%, 8.4%, and 3.5% of children in the ASD, DD, and POP groups, 
respectively (Fig 2, Table 2). Within the ASD group, pica was reported in 28.1% of children 
with ID and 14.0% of children without ID. Within the DD group, pica was reported in 
26.3% of children with both ID and some ASD characteristics, 12.0% of children with ASD 
characteristics but without ID, 9.7% of children with ID but without ASD characteristics, 
and 3.2% of children with neither ID nor ASD characteristics.

Unadjusted PRs indicated associations between pica and all ASD groups and subgroups 
and between pica and DD overall and 3 of the 4 DD subgroups. There was no association 
between pica and DD with neither ID nor ASD characteristics (Table 2). Despite some 
variability due to small sample sizes, the findings from stratified analyses were generally 
comparable to the unadjusted analyses (Supplemental Tables 4 and 5).

Multivariable aPRs were also similar to the unadjusted PRs (Table 2). Pica remained 
strongly associated with ASD overall, ASD with ID, ASD without ID, and DD with both 
ID and some ASD characteristics (aPRs 4.4–8.0]. Pica was moderately associated with 
DD overall, DD with ASD characteristics without ID, and DD with ID but not ASD 
characteristics (aPRs 1.9–2.5). Pica was not associated with DD with neither ID nor ASD 
characteristics.

The differences between ASD and DD case groups and subgroups and the POP group were 
even more pronounced when we used a more restrictive pica classification, (ie limited to a 
maternal response of “very true or often true” to the pica question) (Supplemental Table 6).

DISCUSSION

Our findings suggest that pica is more common in preschool-aged children with ASD, 
whether or not ID was present, and with other types of DD in which the child had some 
ASD characteristics, ID, or both. In comparison with the POP group, pica was strongly 
associated with ASD and with other DDs characterized by both ASD symptoms and ID and 
moderately associated with DD with ASD characteristics only or ID only. Notably, pica was

not elevated in children with DDs that did not include ASD characteristics or ID. Thus, our 
findings suggest that not all children with DDs are at increased risk for pica. Using a more 
conservative definition of pica did not change the relative findings.

Our pica prevalence estimate in children with ASD is higher than the prevalence reported by 
Emond et al22 in their cohort study of children with ASD (12.3% and 12.5%), and markedly 
higher than the prevalence reported by Neumeyer et al23 in their study of children in an 
autism treatment network (3.0% and 2.4%). Likewise, although our estimates fall within the 
range of estimates from studies presented by Matson et al1 in their review of pica in children 
or adults with ASD and/or ID (4% to 26%) it is notably higher than several estimates from 
that review. Our findings expand on these reports in several ways. Whereas many previous 
studies were limited by nonstandardized classification of ASD or ID, we collected objective 
developmental data as part of the SEED protocol to systematically classify ASD and ID. 
Most past studies examined a limited subset of pica, such as pica that came to medical 
attention and/or required treatment; in contrast, with SEED we examined pica behavior 
ascertained from a standardized developmental questionnaire30 regardless of whether the 
child had developed adverse consequences from their pica. Another strength of this study 
in comparison with others is the inclusion of a general population comparison group, which 
was actively recruited from the same study areas as the ASD and DD case groups. Finally, 
SEED’S large sample size and detailed developmental data collection allowed us to obtain 
stable estimates of pica among children in various disability subgroups and thus hone in 
more clearly than past studies on types of disability that were and were not associated with 
pica.

Nonetheless, we were not able to explore associations between pica and specific DDs. The 
SEED DD group, identified from diagnostic and special education codes, is heterogeneous, 
including children with many different (and sometimes multiple] disabilities. We were 
unable to assess specific non-ASD DD diagnoses separately because of sample size 
limitations and complexities in categorizing the various diagnostic and education disability 
codes into meaningful subgroups. However, our subdivisions of the DD group according 
to the presence of ASD characteristics objectively measured on a standardized instrument 
and on whether the child’s developmental test scores were in the ID range allowed us to 
evaluate important subgroups of children with disability defined by rigorous standardized 
assessments.

Given the young age of the participants in this study sample, it is possible that pica 
prevalence in this study will not reflect pica prevalence at older ages. Nonetheless, in 
stratified analyses, we assessed whether the associations varied within the narrow range of 
ages included in our study and found that all associations observed in the main analysis were 
observed among the oldest stratum of children, those 48 to 68 months of age. Although we 
cannot assess whether affected children will continue to manifest pica as they age, our data 
nonetheless indicate it is a serious health concern in preschool-aged children. Notably, all 
children in this study were much older than 18 months, the age at which ingestion of foreign 
objects is deemed inappropriate.33

Although we were unable to examine underlying reasons for the high pica prevalence 
we observed in children with ASD, ASD characteristics, and ID, Mayes and Zickgraf34 
found that pica in children with autism was one component of a larger pattern of atypical 
eating behaviors, such as limited food preferences and hypersensitivity to food textures. 
Furthermore, sensory processing difficulties are commonly reported in children with ASD 
and may result in both atypical eating and pica behavior.35 Additionally, some children 
with ASD and/or ID may not understand the difference between edible and inedible 
objects.33,35 Treatments for pica that have empirical support include applied behavior 
analysis1 and functional analysis, which helps identify triggers for pica and determine if 
pica is secondary to sensory-seeking behavior, automatic reinforcement, or social factors 
such as seeking attention from caregivers.7,33 Parent prevention measures include closely 
monitoring children, keeping items out of reach, using childproof locks, finding activities 
that occupy children’s attention, and informing other caregivers of concerns.33

Despite our study’s strengths, we also note several limitations. SEED developmental data 
are cross-sectional, limiting causal inference. Although we defined pica on the basis of a 
standardized developmental assessment questionnaire,30 pica was a single behavioral item 
on this instrument; while our internal assessment of available text responses about nonfood 
items was reassuring about the validity of the pica responses, we lacked data on clinical 
diagnoses and sequelae of pica and the typical quantity of nonfood items ingested. We 
also lacked data on some established biological risk factors for pica such as nutritional 
deficiencies and lead toxicity. It is possible that ascertainment of pica varied for cases and 
controls because caregivers might more closely monitor children with ASD and ID than 
children without these conditions. However, the impact of differential monitoring on pica 
prevalence estimates could have been in either direction; if children with ASD or ID were 
more closely monitored, caretakers had not only increased opportunity to observe pica, 
but also increased opportunity to prevent pica. Moreover, the difference between the level 
of observation for case and control children was likely not large, given that all children 
were young and thus likely to have been monitored fairly closely. Because SEED sought 
to enroll a diverse population of children recruited from a wide range of education and 
clinical sources, numerous families targeted for potential recruitment could not be located or 
contacted; however, a previous study in one SEED site indicated that a large proportion of 
these families were likely no longer eligible for SEED because they moved out of the study 
area; additionally, that study documented that although maternal age and education were 
associated with differential participation between ASD cases and POP controls, several other 
demographic and health factors were not associated with participation, and findings from 
most SEED analyses were likely robust36 We adjusted for both maternal age and education 
in this analysis. This study takes place in 6 different population-based US sites; however, 
results may not be generalizable throughout the United States.

CONCLUSIONS

We found that preschool-aged children with ASD, ASD characteristics, and ID more 
commonly engage in pica and therefore could benefit from close monitoring, strategies 
to restrict access to dangerous items and possibly behavioral therapy.1,5,7,37 These findings 
can help promote awareness about pica among pediatricians and the disability community.

Given the current paucity of research, more studies of the prevalence, correlates, and clinical 
outcomes of pica in children with ASD and other DDs are needed.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT:

Previous pica prevalence estimates in children or adults with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) and/or intellectual disability are reported to range from 2% to 26%. However, 
there are few epidemiological studies on pica prevalence in individuals with ASD and 
other developmental disabilities.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS:

Results from a large case-control study suggest that pica is common in preschool-aged 
children with ASD, ASD characteristics, and/or intellectual disability. Pediatricians and 
parents should be aware of the potential for pica among this population of children.

FIGURE 1. 
The flowchart reveals the way in which the sample of children was divided into different 
groups and subgroups. The main study groups are ASD, DD, and POP. The ASD and DD 
groups were subdivided into children with and without ID. The DD group was further 
subdivided into children with and without ASD characteristics. a Seventeen children with 
ASD were missing data on IQ. b Nine children with DD were missing data on IQ.
