Neural Changes in Borderline
Personality Disorder After Dialectical
Behavior Therapy–A Review

The biological component of the biosocial theory of emotion regulation stipulates that
borderline personality disorder (BPD) arises from biological vulnerabilities to heightened
emotional reactivity. Comprehensive reviews have consistently implicated abnormalities
in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus in the neurobiology of BPD.
While Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is the leading evidence-based psychotherapy
for the treatment of BPD, there remains a paucity of literature examining changes in the
neurobiology of BPD following DBT treatment. Nine studies were identiﬁed that examined
neurobiological changes in BPD after the completion of DBT. Results indicated that
there was signiﬁcant deactivation of amygdala activity as well as the anterior cingulate
cortex in patients with BPD after DBT treatment. As well, several studies found after DBT
treatment, BPD patients had a decreased activity in the inferior frontal gyrus in response
to arousing stimuli and increased activity in response to inhibitory control. Future research
on the neurobiological change after DBT treatment can help clarify biological mechanisms
of change in BPD.

INTRODUCTION

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a debilitating mental illness characterized by emotion
dysregulation, poor impulse control, identity disturbances, recurrent suicidal or self-harming
behaviors, and unstable interpersonal relationships (1, 2). The etiological origins of BPD have
been conceptualized within the biosocial theory of emotion dysregulation, which theorizes that
BPD arises from a combination of both (a) biological vulnerabilities to heightened emotional
responsivity as well as (b) a social environment that involves the invalidation of emotional
expression and the reinforcement of emotional arousal (3). This review article will primarily focus
on the biological components of BPD.

Comprehensive reviews have consistently demonstrated the multifaceted neurobiology of BPD
in adults (2, 4, 5) as well as adolescents (6), along with the neurobiology of non-suicidal self-injury,
a prominent and pervasive symptom among individuals with BPD (7). For example, abnormalities
in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have been consistently implicated in the
neurobiology of both BPD as well as individuals who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (2, 5–
7). More speciﬁcally, a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on emotion processing showed left
amygdala hyperactivity and reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) among individuals with
BPD (8, 9). Moreover, abnormalities in the hippocampus have been linked with BPD in adults (2, 5).

Neural Changes After DBT

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is the leading evidence-
based psychotherapy for BPD that emphasizes the role of
emotion regulation and targets the acquisition of skills and
techniques to encourage control over maladaptive behavioral
patterns (10–15). However, despite the plethora of research
on the neurobiology of BPD, there have only been a handful
of studies examining changes in neurobiology following DBT
treatment of BPD. The purpose of this article will be to review the
literature on how DBT can inﬂuence the neurobiology of BPD.

METHODS

A review of the current literature was carried out by searching
for articles in Pubmed/Medline, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar,
along with articles obtained from the references of other articles.
The reference sections of the review articles mentioned above
[i.e., (2, 4–7)] were also examined to determine if there were any
other studies that examined the neural substrates of BPD after
treatment. Keywords used for this review included “dialectical,”
“borderline,” “brain,” and “neural.”

RESULTS

A total of nine studies were identiﬁed for the review. Seven
studies used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
two used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Within
the nine studies, four of the fMRI studies (8, 16–18) and two
of the fNIRS studies (19, 20) were obtained from the same
data collection. No studies using positron emission tomography
(PET), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalogram
(EEG), or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were
identiﬁed. Table 1 describes the characteristics of each study.

fMRI Findings
Several studies focused on neural changes observed using fMRI
resulting from 12-week DBT treatment programs for individuals
with BPD. Schnell and Herpertz (21) examined whether the
increased regulation of aﬀective arousal after a 12-week in-
patient treatment program would translate into changes in
the speciﬁc brain regions involved in aﬀect regulation. Five
longitudinal fMRI scans were completed, wherein participants
viewed a set of images designed to induce emotional arousal.
Patients with BPD who received DBT treatment displayed a
signiﬁcant reduction in activation in the right caudal anterior
and posterior cingulate cortices, the right middle temporal gyrus,
and the left anterior insula in response to the arousing stimuli,
while control patients displayed no signiﬁcant reduction among
the same brain regions. Moreover, the subgroup of therapy
responders (i.e., four of the six patients with BPD) were the only
patients who also exhibited decreased activity in response to the
arousing stimuli in the right inferior and medial frontal gyrus,
the left amygdala, and the bilateral hippocampus. One strength of
this study was the relatively large number of repetitive scans used
to counter the criticism of typical pre-post designs–one round
of neuroimaging before treatment and the other afterward–
which may reﬂect general symptom improvement rather than the
speciﬁc eﬀects of psychotherapy (23).

Another study compared patients with BPD with gender-
matched healthy controls (HC) with no Axis I or II disorders
or family history of an Axis I disorder using a 12-month
DBT program (11). During both the pre- and post-treatment
fMRI scans, all participants viewed an intermixed series of
unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant pictures. Results indicated
that while the BPD group exhibited an overall decrease in
amygdala activation post-treatment,
the HC group showed
overall amygdala activation that was similar at baseline and 12
months. Furthermore, compared with healthy controls, patients
with BPD showed a pattern of greater decrease from pre- to
post-treatment in amygdala activity for all three pictures types,
but particularly in the left hemisphere and during the repeated
emotional picture conditions (unpleasant and pleasant). Finally,
among the patients with BPD, reduction in amygdala activity to
repeated unpleasant pictures (i.e., improved amygdala activation)
following DBT was associated with improved emotion regulation.
One of the strengths of this particular study was that all BPD
participants were unmedicated, so this study was able to remove
the potential
inﬂuence of medication on positive treatment
outcomes or speciﬁc brain changes (11).

Four separate studies were part of a larger clinical trial on
alterations in neural correlates of emotion regulation in BPD
after DBT (8, 16–18). The ﬁrst study examined the impact of
a 12-week DBT program in women with BPD compared to
women with BPD in the treatment-as-usual (TAU) and female
healthy controls with no current or past psychiatric diagnoses
(17). During the pre- and post-treatment fMRI scans, the women
with BPD in the 12-week DBT program were asked to view
either a negative or a neutral picture and asked to either (a)
reappraise their emotion by imagining that the situation was not
real or that they were a detached observer (reappraisal condition)
or (b) view the pictures attentively without trying to alter their
aﬀective reaction (maintain condition). Results indicated that the
BPD patients in the DBT group experienced a stronger activity
decline in the anterior insula and dorsal ACC post-treatment
compared to healthy controls, while there was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
and the dlPFC between groups. Furthermore, in DBT patients,
the decline of anterior insula activity during reappraisal (but not
passive viewing) of negative pictures was signiﬁcantly correlated
with a reduction in BPD symptom severity. Moreover, BPD
patients experienced increased anterior cingulate connectivity
to medial and superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus,
and inferior parietal cortices after DBT. Finally, DBT responders
demonstrated diminished activity post-treatment in the right
amygdala, subgenual, perigenual and dorsal ACCs, the medial
and left OFCs, and right dlPFC during reappraisal compared
to DBT non-responders. DBT responders also showed increased
connectivity from the dlPFC to the OFC, superior temporal
gyrus, posterior insula, cingulate gyrus, and thalamus over time
compared to DBT non-responders (17).

The second study compared female patients with BPD
undergoing 12 weeks of DBT with female patients with BPD
who were not enrolled in DBT and female healthy controls
(HC) with no current or lifetime psychiatric disorder and no
psychotropic medication (18). Participants were instructed to

either (a) passively view (i.e., passivity condition) or (b) memorize
letters (i.e., memorization condition) before being confronted
with negative or neutral pictures in a distraction task during the
pre- and post-treatment fMRI scans. After the presentation of
the pictures, participants had to indicate as fast as possible when
they (a) saw the letter “o” or (b) whether the letter presented
was in the memorized string of letters. The memorization-
negative condition was used as a way to measure distraction
as an eﬀective emotion regulation strategy in reducing negative
aﬀect, particularly when stimuli are highly arousing (24). Results
indicated that patients with BPD who received DBT showed
decreased activation in the right inferior parietal
lobe and
supramarginal gyrus during distraction from negative rather than
neutral stimuli when compared to both controls. This decrease
in activity was also signiﬁcantly correlated with improvement in
borderline symptom severity. Finally, DBT responders exhibited
decreased right perigenual anterior cingulate activity when
viewing negative (rather than neutral) pictures. The authors
suggested that the results emphasize that speciﬁc neural changes
are associated with distraction from negative stimuli after the
completion of DBT among BPT patients (18).

The third study (8) examined 12-week DBT treatment among
female patients with BPD with aﬀective instability and NSSI
during the last month compared to female patients with BPD
assigned to treatment as usual (BPD + TAU) and female healthy
controls (HC) with no lifetime psychiatric disorders. All patients
participated in two fMRI sessions 12 weeks apart (pre- and
post-treatment for the BPD + DBT group), viewing negative or
neutral picture stimuli coupled with either a baseline temperature
thermal stimulation (32◦C), or a painful temperature stimulus
based on each individual subject’s pain threshold, as a means
investigating whether DBT altered pain-mediated aﬀect
of
regulation at the neural level. Results indicated that amygdala
deactivation in response to negative pictures combined with
painful temperature was observed only in the BPD + DBT group
at baseline and was no longer present post-treatment, while the
BPD + TAU and the HC groups experienced no signiﬁcant
change in amygdala activation in response to negative pictures
and painful temperature. These results suggest that the emotion
regulation skills taught within the DBT skills group might have

enabled patients to regulate amygdala activity more eﬃciently,
reducing at a neural level the role of pain in coping with negative
aﬀect (8).

The fourth study compared female patients with BPD
undergoing 12 weeks of DBT with female patients with BPD
who were receiving TAU (16). Participants completed two
separate fMRI scans at baseline and at 12-week follow-up. Results
indicated that patients with BPD receiving DBT showed an
increase of gray matter volume in the dorsal and rostral ACC,
inferior frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus together with
an increase in gray matter volume in the angular gyrus and
supramarginal gyrus compared to patients with BPD receiving
TAU. DBT treatment response was also signiﬁcantly correlated
with increase of gray matter volume in the angular gyrus. The
authors concluded that DBT may signiﬁcantly alter brain regions
that are explicitly involved in cognitive regulation of emotional
information and mentalizing (16).

In addition to examining the impact of a full DBT program
on various brain structures, research has also been conducted
on the speciﬁc modules of DBT. One study compared the
neural correlates of BPD patients in a 10-week DBT mindfulness
(DBT-M) group with BPD patients in a DBT interpersonal
eﬀectiveness (DBT-IE) group (22). DBT is primarily composed
of four diﬀerent modules, including mindfulness, interpersonal
eﬀectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance (3).
During both pre- and post-fMRI sessions, participants performed
a sequential-letter version of the n-back task whereby participants
had to indicate when the current letter matches the one from n
steps earlier in the sequence.

Results indicated a signiﬁcant increased activation of the
left anterior insula extending to the frontal inferior operculum
after the intervention across both DBT-M and DBT-IE groups
(22). Furthermore, BPD patients in the DBT-M group showed
higher deactivation in a cluster at the medial occipital location
extending bilaterally from the calcarine to the cuneus and
superior occipital gyri while performing the n-back task
compared to the DBT-IE group. However, there was no post-
treatment diﬀerence in default mode network activation or
deactivation across both groups, a brain region associated with
various cognitive processes such as introspection, envisioning

the future, and self-reﬂective thought (25). There was also no
signiﬁcant correlation between BPD symptoms or mindfulness
outcomes and activation/deactivation of the cluster at the medial
occipital
location extending bilaterally from the calcarine to
the cuneus and superior occipital gyri (22). These particular
ﬁndings highlight how speciﬁc components of DBT, including
mindfulness and interpersonal eﬀectiveness, may be uniquely
associated with post-treatment changes in speciﬁc brain regions.

Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
(fNIRS) Findings
While the majority of DBT research has been conducted using
fMRI technology, two studies implemented a functional Near-
Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (19, 20). The ﬁrst study examined
29 self-harming patients with BPD who completed ∼6-months
of a standard 1-year outpatient DBT program (19). Out of the 29
initial patients, 18 of them remained in treatment at the 6-month
follow-up. During both pre- and post-treatment fNIRS scans,
participants completed a go/no go task of response inhibition
that required participants to press a button with their right
index ﬁnger to “go” stimuli (i.e., a green circle) and withhold a
response to “no-go” stimuli (i.e., a red circle). Results of this study
indicated that after 6 months of DBT, BPD patients demonstrated
less activation bilaterally in regions encompassing the middle and
inferior frontal gyri as well as more activation in the right medial
PFC during inhibitory control. As well, these activation patterns
were associated with improvements in BPD symptoms (19).

After the 6 months of DBT, diﬀerences in activation during
inhibitory control were also observed based on changes in
impulsivity, and interpersonal domains
aﬀective, cognitive,
(19). More speciﬁcally, BPD patients with less improvement
in aﬀective symptoms had an increased activation in the
right medial PFC during inhibitory control. In contrast, BPD
patients with more improvement in aﬀective symptoms had
higher activation in the lateral PFC at the 6-month follow-
up during inhibitory control. As well, both BPD patients with
less improvement as well as more improvement in cognitive
symptoms showed more activation within the lateral PFC during
inhibitory control. BPD patients with more improvement in
cognitive symptoms also demonstrated more activation within
the right PFC during inhibitory control. Moreover, while BPD
patients with less improvement in impulsivity demonstrated
higher activation in the left and right medial PFC during
inhibitory control, BPD patients with more improvement in
impulsivity demonstrated higher activation in the left and lower
activation of the right medial PFC during the same task. Finally,
while BPD patients with less improvement in the interpersonal
domain showed higher activation within the right medial PFC,
BPD patients with more improvement in the interpersonal
domain demonstrated higher activation in the right PFC (19). A
follow-up analysis using the same sample found that reductions
in self-harm over the treatment period were associated with
increases in activity in right dlPFC even after accounting
for improvements in depression, mania, and BPD symptom
severity (20).

DISCUSSION

The main ﬁndings of this review suggest neurobiological changes
in brain function after the completion of DBT treatment among
patients with BPD. Firstly, two studies found a signiﬁcant
deactivation of amygdala activity after the completion of
DBT treatment particularly among DBT treatment responders
(11, 21). These ﬁndings are particularly important, given the
involvement of the amygdala in the perception and processing
of emotion (11, 26) and the hyperactivity of the amygdala
among patients with BPD as well as individuals who engage in
non-suicidal self-injury (2, 5–7). Interestingly, one study found
a signiﬁcant deactivation of amygdala activity in response to
negative pictures and painful temperature at baseline, but not
at post-treatment (8). This ﬁnding may suggest that the use of
non-suicidal self-injury in response to emotional arousal can
reduce amygdala activity among patients with BPD prior to
treatment (8).

Secondly, two studies found signiﬁcant decreases in activation
in the ACC after DBT treatment among patients with BPD
(17, 21), while two other studies found a signiﬁcantly reduced
activity in the ACC speciﬁcally among DBT responders (17, 18).
One study also found a signiﬁcant increase in gray matter volume
in the ACC (16), while another study found a positive alteration
in functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the
dorsal ACC when negative pictures were combined with painful
stimuli (8). These ﬁndings are particularly relevant, given that
the dorsal ACC is believed to play an important role in attention
and executive function, while the rostral ACC is implicated in the
assessment and regulation of emotional information, especially in
situations that require cognitive control in the presence of high
emotional input (16, 27, 28). Moreover, these results are in line
with the ﬁnding of abnormalities in the ACC among both patients
with BPD as well as individuals who engage in non-suicidal self-
injury (2, 5–7). As neurobiological research on DBT for BPD
is in its infancy, future research replicating these single-study
neurobiological ﬁndings is clearly warranted to further implicate
changes in speciﬁc brain regions after DBT treatment.

With regards to the anterior insula, while two studies
found reduced activation in the anterior insula after DBT
treatment among patients with BPD (17, 21), one study found
a signiﬁcant increase in activation in the anterior insula (22).
One study also found that reduced activity in the anterior insula
was signiﬁcantly correlated with BPD symptom improvement
(17). However, another study found no signiﬁcant relationship
between activation and deactivation of the left anterior insula and
medial occipital lobe with BPD symptoms (22). Future research
clarifying the association between activation/deactivation of the
anterior insula and DBT treatment outcomes are warranted,
given the role of the anterior insula in interoceptive awareness
and conscious evaluation of bodily states (29–31).

Three separate studies examined the impact of DBT treatment
on the inferior frontal gyrus (16, 19, 21). These studies found that
after DBT treatment, patients with BPD experienced an increase
in gray matter in the inferior frontal gyrus (16), decreased activity
in response to arousing stimuli (21), and increased activity in
response to inhibitory control (19). These ﬁndings suggest that

both the structure and function of the inferior frontal gyrus may
be signiﬁcantly altered after DBT treatment among patients with
BPD (16, 19, 21).

it
In addition to speciﬁc brain structure and function,
is worth noting here that DBT may lead to alterations in
neurotrophin methylation (32). One study found that after a 4-
week intensive DBT program, BDNF methylation signiﬁcantly
increased across all BPD patients (32). The authors noted that
DBT non-responders accounted for the majority of this increase,
whereas DBT responders actually showed a decrease in BDNF
methylation over time (32). The patients with the best response
achieved the level of BDNF methylation found in healthy
control patients (32). Thus, it appears that BDNF methylation
may be associated with DBT treatment response among BPD
patients (32).

Neural Correlates of Other
Treatments/Populations
In addition to the impact of DBT on neural changes among
patients with BPD, there have been several other studies that
have examined neural changes across various types of treatments
and clinical populations. The ﬁnding that DBT treatment directly
impacts changes in the posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus,
and other frontal areas that are similar to previously described
changes in neuroimaging following psychotherapy across a
variety of mental disorders, including interpersonal therapy for
major depression (33) as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy for
major depression (34), speciﬁc phobia (35), and social phobia
(21, 36).

Furthermore,

there have been several studies that have
speciﬁcally examined the neural impact of other types treatments
among individuals with BPD. One study among patients with
BPD with aﬀective instability found that BPD patients showed
decreased activity in the left orbitofrontal cortex and increased
activation of the bilateral insula compared to healthy controls
when attempting to downregulate their negative emotional
responses using cognitive reappraisal after viewing negative
pictures (37). Another study found that after using a distancing
in which the subject had to increase the sense
technique,
of objective distance, BPD patients showed decreased brain
responses in the dorsal ACC and inferior parietal lobe, and
less deactivation in the amygdala compared to healthy control
patients (38, 39). However, one study found no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the activation of the ACC among trauma-exposed
women with BPD compared with healthy controls after using
a cognitive reappraisal technique to down-regulate negative
emotions after reading negative scripts designed to increase
negative emotions (39).

Several studies have focused on the treatment strategy
known as neurofeedback, which involves instructing participants
to down-regulate their emotional
response after viewing
neurofeedback pertaining to activation of a speciﬁc brain
region (40, 41). One study that
involved BPD patients
receiving a 4-day training on how to monitor amygdala blood
oxygenation level neurofeedback among BPD patients found that
although amygdala neurofeedback was associated with decreased

right amygdala activation after viewing aversive pictures, this
decreased activation did not persist when participants were
instructed to apply down-regulation without receiving any
feedback (40). A more recent study found that 4 days of
amygdala neurofeedback training was associated with both
amygdala deactivation as well as a decrease in BPD symptoms
and a decrease in emotion-modulated startle to negative pictures
among BPD patients (41). Future research on the positive impact
of brief amygdala neurofeedback on the neural functioning of
individuals with BPD may oﬀer a unique alternative to prolonged
DBT treatment (40, 41).

Finally, there have been a handful of studies examining the
neural impact of psychodynamic therapy among individuals with
BPD (42, 43). One study of BPD patients found increased dorsal
prefrontal (i.e., dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal,
and frontopolar cortices) activation, and relative decreased
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampal activation
following psychodynamic treatment (42). This study also found
that improvement in constraint correlated positively with relative
increased left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation (42).
As well, improvement in aﬀective lability correlated positively
with left posterior-medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventral striatum
activation, and negatively with right amygdala/parahippocampal
activation (42). Two other studies with small sample sizes
of BPD patients (i.e., n = 2) found stronger frontal region
activation (43) as well as increases in frontal serotonergic
transmission compared to non-treated BPD patients (44). Similar
to amygdala neurofeedback, future research on the positive
impact of psychodynamic therapy on the neural functioning of
individuals with BPD may oﬀer a unique alternative to DBT
treatment (42–44).

Biomarkers Predicting DBT Treatment
Success
In addition to neural changes after DBT treatment among
BPD patients, there has also been several
lines of evidence
on speciﬁc neural correlates prior to the commencement of
DBT that may be associated with improved outcome following
treatment (19, 20, 45). One study found that, compared to
BPD patients who either dropped out or did not
initiate
DBT, BPD patients who completed the 6-months of DBT
showed less pre-treatment activation during inhibitory control
in a region within the left PFC encompassing the inferior
and middle frontal gyri, and the superior frontal gyrus,
along with less activation in right middle frontal gyrus (19).
In contrast, BPD patients who did not complete treatment
showed greater pre-treatment activation across a large area
encompassing the medial PFC, consisting of superior and
middle frontal gyri bilaterally, along with the right inferior
frontal gyrus (19). Additionally, a sub-region within the left
middle frontal gyrus demonstrated lower activation during
response inhibition among patients with BPD who did not
complete treatment (19). A follow-up study using the same
sample found that BDP patients that reduced their frequency
of self-harm the most over treatment displayed lower levels

of neural activation in the bilateral dlPFC prior to beginning
treatment (20).

A second study found that amygdala and parahippocampus
activation during a cognitive reappraisal task after viewing
negative pictures, severity measures of BPD psychopathology,
and gray matter volume of the amygdala provided best predictive
power for identifying DBT treatment non-responders (45). Prior
to starting DBT, this study found that treatment non-completers
demonstrated greater activation than treatment-completers in
the medial PFC and right inferior frontal gyrus (20). One other
study found that the presence of the 12-repeat allele on the VNTR
polymorphism of SERT was associated with higher adherence to
DBT treatment among BPD patients (46).

improvements in constraint were predicted by pre-treatment

pre-treatment left posterior-medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventral

12-weeks of DBT treatment found that while there were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in DNA methylation of APBA3 and MCF2
diﬀerences between patients with BPD and healthy controls,
there was a signiﬁcant correlation between the methylation status
of APBA3 and MCF2 and therapy outcome. More speciﬁcally,
before DBT treatment, both genes were signiﬁcantly higher
methylated in BPD patients who responded to DBT compared to
patients with BPD that did not respond to DBT (47).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

It is clear that there is much to learn about both the unique
impact of DBT as well as other forms of treatment on individuals
with BPD, along with learning more about how baseline genetics
and neural patterns of brain functioning may be helpful in
predicting treatment success in BPD (2, 19). However, research
on the neurobiological changes of DBT as well as biomarker
research on DBT treatment success is still in its infancy. Given
that the majority of studies use a single pre-post design when
administering neuroimaging,
future research using multiple
scans throughout the course of treatment can help conﬁrm
the speciﬁc eﬀects of psychotherapy on the brain over-and-
above general symptom improvement over time (23). As well,
DBT dismantling studies can further elucidate if there are
signiﬁcant neurobiological changes based on each individual
DBT module (e.g., mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress
tolerance,
interpersonal eﬀectiveness) (22). Moreover, future
research can help optimize DBT treatments by incorporating
neuroimaging biomarkers that could hold promise as therapeutic
targets used to track and predict treatment-related improvement
among individuals with BPD (2, 19).
