Abstract 

Chemotherapy treatment-related side effects are common and increase the risk of suboptimal outcomes. Exercise interventions dur-
ing cancer treatment improve self-reported physical functioning, fatigue, anxiety, and depression, but it is unclear whether these 
interventions  improve  important  clinical  outcomes,  such  as  chemotherapy  relative  dose  intensity.  The  National  Cancer  Institute 
funded the Exercise and Nutrition to Improve Cancer Treatment-Related Outcomes (ENICTO) Consortium to address this knowledge 
gap. This article describes the mechanisms hypothesized to underpin intervention effects on clinically relevant treatment outcomes, 
briefly outlines each project’s distinct research aims, summarizes the scope and organizational structure of ENICTO, and provides an 
overview of the integrated common data elements used to pursue research questions collectively. In addition, the article includes a 
description of consortium-wide activities and broader research community opportunities for collaborative research. Findings from 
the  ENICTO  Consortium  have  the  potential  to  accelerate  a  paradigm  shift  in  oncology  care  such  that  patients  with  cancer  could 
receive exercise and nutrition programming as the standard of care in tandem with chemotherapy to improve relative dose intensity 
for a curative outcome.

Despite  advances 
in  chemotherapy,  treatment-related  side 
effects  are  common  and  increase  the  risk  of  suboptimal  out-
comes  because  patients  may  be  unable  to  complete  guideline- 
concordant therapy. Cancer treatment-related outcomes include 
chemotherapy  dose  reductions  and  delays,  related  health-care 
utilization, and chemotherapy dose-limiting toxicities that occur 
in  close  proximity  to  cancer  treatment  for  curative  or  life- 
extending  intent  (1).  Lack  of  exercise,  low  physiologic  reserves, 
poor  diet,  malnutrition,  and  changes  in  body  composition  may 
increase  the  risk  of  adverse  treatment-related  outcomes  (2-8). 
Exercise  and  nutrition  interventions  are  known  to  improve  fit-
ness  and  body  composition  and  can  be  delivered  concurrently 
with  cancer  therapies  (4,6,9,10).  The  effects  of  specific  exercise 
and  nutrition  therapy  on  chemotherapy-related  outcomes  are 
not well characterized. Most exercise and nutrition intervention 
research to date has focused on primary cancer prevention or on 
improving  long-term  outcomes  after  the  completion  of  cancer 
treatment rather than the period shortly before or during chemo-
therapy, and few studies have targeted a treatment-related out-
come as a primary endpoint (11,12).

Evidence is needed to understand the optimal type, frequency, 
intensity, duration, and overall volume (ie, dose) of exercise nec-
essary  to  improve  cancer  treatment-related  outcomes.  Medical 
nutrition interventions aimed at treating or preventing malnutri-
tion  during  treatment,  alone  or  combined  with  exercise,  have 
been associated with improved maintenance of lean body mass, 
fewer  adverse  events,  and  decreased  length  of  hospital  stay  in 
select cancer populations (13). Heterogeneity in the interventions 
and  other  methodological  challenges,  however,  have  precluded 
translation  into  clinical  practice  guidelines.  Given  the  limited 
body of specific evidence to guide exercise oncology and oncology 
nutrition practice, current national health promotion recommen-
dations advise people living with and beyond cancer generally to 
consume  a  healthy  diet  and  maintain  or  pursue  recommended 
levels  of  physical  activity  (4,14,15);  they  also  highlight  the  need 
for further research to determine intervention effects on cancer 
treatment-related outcomes.

The  Exercise  and  Nutrition  Interventions  to  Improve  Cancer 
Treatment-Related  Outcomes  (ENICTO)  Consortium  was  estab-
lished  by  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  to  determine 
whether  specific  exercise  prescriptions  and  medical  nutrition 
interventions before or during chemotherapy affect the receipt of 
the planned prescribed dose of cancer treatment and related fac-
tors.  Five  projects  (4  trials  and  1  coordinating  center)  were 
selected,  by  peer  review,  for  funding  as  part  of  the  ENICTO 
Consortium  (https://www.enicto.bcs.gwu.edu).  ENICTO  requires 
that  each  trial  address  independent  aims,  while  ENICTO’s 

consortium structure provides an opportunity for methodological 
and  data  harmonization  and  coordination  to  pursue  research 
questions collectively that would not be possible individually by 
harnessing the harmonized dataset that will arise from the 4 tri-
als. This commentary describes the mechanisms hypothesized to 
underpin  intervention  effects  on  clinically  relevant  treatment 
outcomes,  briefly  outlines  the  distinct  research  aims  of  each 
project,  summarizes  the  scope  and  organizational  structure  of 
ENICTO,  and  provides  an  overview  of  the  integrated  common 
data elements that can be used to pursue research questions col-
lectively.

Targeted mechanisms

Exercise  and  nutrition  may  drive  cancer-related  treatment  out-
comes through several potential mechanisms. Each ENICTO trial 
prespecified several hypothesized mechanisms by which exercise 
and nutrition interventions are hypothesized to improve relative 
dose  intensity,  the  primary  outcome  across  all  4  ENICTO  trials 
(Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1, available online).

For example, the primary hypothesized mechanisms through 
which  the  aerobic  exercise  program  prescribed  in  the  Adaptive 
Randomization  of  Aerobic  Exercise  during  Chemotherapy  in 
Colon  Cancer  (ACTION)  trial  is  anticipated  to  improve  relative 
dose  intensity  are  exercise-induced  reductions  in  fat  mass  and 
preservation of lean mass, which will, in turn, improve the phar-
macokinetic properties of chemotherapy. The Tele-exercise dur-
ing  chemotherapy  Trial  (TNT)  hypothesizes  that  chemotherapy 
may also impair hematological function by direct suppression of 
hematopoiesis and by increasing reactive oxygen species (16,17), 
which  in  turn  induce  apoptosis  in  circulating  neutrophils  (18) 
and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (19). Such changes 
ultimately reduce neutrophil counts and suppress the generation 
of  mature  blood  cells  (eg,  neutrophils,  erythrocytes).  In  related 
clinical work, exercise training reduces systemic reactive oxygen 
species  (20)  and  promotes  rapid  hemoglobin  and  neutrophil 
recovery  after  every  chemotherapy  cycle  in  people  living  with 
and beyond cancer (21,22).

The Trial of Exercise And Lifestyle (TEAL) presumes that che-
motherapy  causes  a  decrease  in  muscle  mass  and  that  aerobic 
and  resistance  exercise  and  medical  nutrition  therapy  may 
improve these outcomes as well as patient-reported chemotoxic-
ities improving relative dose integrity.

TeleHealth  Resistance  exercise  Intervention  to  preserve  dose 
intensity and Vitality in Elder Breast Cancer Patients (THRIVE-65) 
hypothesizes  that  maintenance  of  muscle  mass  through  resist-
ance training and protein supplementation will lead to improved

ing neuropathy (23), gastrointestinal (GI) distress (24), and fatigue 
(25). Severe symptom burden among older patients (≥ 65 years of 
age)  could  lead  to  alterations  in  medical  management.  Patients 
may  further  decrease  physical  activity  because  of  symptoms 
while undergoing chemotherapy (26). Findings from randomized 
controlled  trials,  however,  suggest  that  exercise  and  nutrition 
may  improve  these  common  chemotherapy-related  signs  and 
symptoms,  thus  preventing  the  need  for  symptom-related  che-
motherapy dose reductions (14,27).

Scope and organization

The  organizational  structure  of  ENICTO  was  designed  to  main-
tain centralized leadership while facilitating input from and col-
laboration among the multidisciplinary individual project teams, 
working  groups,  and  the  2  standing  committees  (Publications 
and Presentations, Project Managers) (Figure 1).

The  Coordinating  Center  supports  the  scientific  goals  of  the 
ENICTO Consortium through curation, harmonization, and anal-
ysis of common data elements across consortium sites and coor-
dinating  the  consortium’s  administrative  functions  as  well  as 
internal  and  external  communication.  The  ENICTO  Steering 
Committee  serves  as  the  initiative’s  principal  governing  board. 
ENICTO working groups were charged with identifying common 
data  elements  and  standardizing  data-collection  procedures 
across  consortium  projects  and  identifying  potential  future 
cross-consortium research questions.

Overview of projects

All  4  ENICTO  projects  are  randomized  controlled  trials  that 
include  exercise  interventions  during  cancer  treatment.  Two  of 
the  projects  also  include  nutrition  interventions.  All  4  have  a 
common primary endpoint, but the cancer sites and patient pop-
ulations vary. In the sections that follow and in Supplementary 
Table 1 (available online), we briefly describe the projects.

Colon  cancer  is  the  third-most  common  malignancy  world-
wide  (28),  and  postoperative  chemotherapy  has  been  proven  to 
improve overall survival by reducing disease recurrence (29). The 
ACTION  trial  uses  a  bayesian,  multistage,  response-adaptive, 
dose-ranging design to characterize the effects of aerobic training 
on  chemotherapy  relative  dose  intensity  in  patients  receiving 
chemotherapy for stage II and III colon cancer following surgical 
resection.  The  study  will  enroll  219  adults  (men  and  women) 
from  3  regions  of  the  United  States  that  are  socioeconomically, 
racially,  and  geographically  diverse  (Baton  Rouge,  Louisiana; 
Boston, Massachusetts; and Oakland, California). The first 80 par-
ticipants  will  be  randomly  assigned  to  1  of  5  groups  equally: 
moderate-intensity  aerobic  training  at  75 min/wk,  150 min/wk, 
225 min/wk,  or  300 min/wk  or  an  attention  control  condition  of 
static  stretching  for  the  duration  of  chemotherapy  (3  or  6 
months)  using  bayesian  covariate-adaptive  randomization.  This 
phase will be followed by bayesian covariate-adjusted response- 
adaptive random assignment, in which subsequent participants 
will be assigned to a specific treatment group in a ratio propor-
tional  to  the  posterior  probability  that  the  specific  treatment 
group improves relative dose intensity compared with the control 
groups  (30).  The  exercise  prescription  will  be  chemotherapy 
periodized, with a smaller volume of aerobic training prescribed 
on  the  weeks  that  chemotherapy  is  administered  to  accommo-
date  variations  in  patient-reported  symptoms  and  a  larger  vol-
ume  of  exercise  prescribed  on  the  weeks  that  chemotherapy  is 
not  administered  (31).  The  ACTION  trial  uses  an  innovative 
design  to  rigorously  and  efficiently  identify  an  aerobic  training 
prescription  that  is  patient  centered  and  proven  to  have  a  high 
probability  of  improving  chemotherapy  relative  dose  intensity. 
The  ACTION  trial  will  consider  4  specific  aims:  1)  Assess  the 
effects of aerobic training on chemotherapy relative dose inten-
sity; 2) assess the effects of aerobic training on GI and peripheral 
neuropathy  symptoms  assessed  using  the  Patient-Reported 
Outcomes  version  of  the  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) (32); 3) assess the effects of aerobic 
training on body composition, measured using dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry;  and  4)  assess  the  effects  of  aerobic  training  on

immune  function,  measured  using  neutrophil  counts,  pheno-
types  (eg,  segmented  immature  or  banded  mature),  and  func-
tions (eg, effector functions, chemotaxis, oxidative burst).

The TNT is a 3-arm randomized trial that will recruit a total of 
216  inactive  (≤90  minutes  of  moderate-intensity  exercise  per 
week) patients with GI cancers scheduled to initiate neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.  Poor  chemotherapy  tolerance  is  common  in 
patients  with  GI  cancers,  and  chemotherapy  is  associated  with 
increased  risk  of  recurrence  and  death  (33-35).  Participants  will 
be stratified by cancer type and randomly allocated (1:1:1 ratio) 
to receive 90 min/wk, 150 min/wk, or 300 min/wk of structured, 
remotely  supervised  aerobic  training  for  the  length  of  chemo-
therapy. The primary goal will be to evaluate the dose response 
of  aerobic  training  on  chemotherapy  tolerance  and  related  out-
comes.  All  study  assessments  and  aerobic  training  will  be  per-
formed  remotely  in  the  patient’s  home  with  remote  real-time 
monitoring. Briefly, following e-consent, each patient will receive 
a  “study  kit”  containing  an  iPad  device,  several  Bluetooth- 
enabled  health  biodevices  (eg,  scale,  smartwatch),  and  a  tread-
mill.  These  biodevices  will  permit  passive  measurement  of 
longitudinal  physiological  responses  to  aerobic  training  using 
high sampling frequency. TNT will address 3 aims: 1) Determine 
the dose response of aerobic training on treatment tolerance; 2) 
evaluate  aerobic  training  dose  response  on  hematological  func-
tion  by  evaluating  systemic  reactive  oxygen  species,  hemato-
poietic stem and progenitor cell enumeration and differentiation, 
and  neutrophil  apoptosis;  3)  explore  aerobic  training  dose 
response on tumor clinical outcomes by comparing pathological 
complete response and disease-free survival rates.

The TEAL study is a multisite (Yale University and University 
of Miami), 2-arm, randomized trial of an approximately 18-week, 
remotely  delivered  lifestyle  intervention  of  medical  nutrition 
therapy and exercise (resistance training and aerobic training) vs 
usual  care.  TEAL  will  recruit  a  racially  and  ethnically  diverse 
sample of 200 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer (stages I-IV) 
and initiating curative-intent chemotherapy, either neoadjuvant 
or  adjuvant  to  surgery. Women  are  recruited  before  the  second 

chemotherapy cycle and randomly assigned 1:1 to either the life-
style  intervention  or  usual  care.  The  TEAL  study  is  offered  in 
both English and Spanish, and women in the intervention meet 
weekly via My Wellness Research with a registered dietitian and 
an exercise physiologist (separately) for the duration of their che-
motherapy.  My  Wellness  Research  is  a  research  management 
and 
communications  platform  developed  at  Sylvester 
Comprehensive  Cancer  Center  and  University  of  Miami  Health 
Systems. It facilitates bidirectional communication (videoconfer-
encing, SMS text messaging, email, and telephone), remote data 
collection  (eg,  wearable  devices),  and  patient-reported  data  col-
lection (eg, daily food and exercise journals), with all data stored 
within  its  information  technology  infrastructure,  meeting  the 
highest standards for data security. During the weekly nutrition 
counseling session, the registered dietitian and/or board-certified 
specialist  in  oncology  nutrition  discusses  with  the  participant 
whether  they  are  experiencing  any  nutrition  impact  symptoms 
from  chemotherapy  and  approaches  to  improve  diet  quality. 
During the weekly exercise counseling call, the certified exercise 
trainer  leads  1  of  the  twice-weekly  resistance  bands  sessions 
with the participant by Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, San 
Jose,  CA)  and  also  counsels  on  increasing  aerobic  exercise  and 
reviews  Fitbit  (FitBit  Inc,  San  Francisco,  CA)  data.  Both  weekly 
calls also include a discussion of the prior week’s nutrition and 
exercise  logging.  Exercise  intensity  is  monitored  by  the  Borg 
Rating of Perceived Exertion.

TEAL is designed to address 4 specific aims: 1) Assess the effect 
of the physical activity and nutrition intervention on relative dose 
intensity;  2)  assess  the  effect  of  the  intervention  on  patient- 
reported  chemotoxicities;  3)  assess  the  effect  of  the  intervention 
on  body  composition,  determined  using  computed  tomography 
(CT) scans and urinary D3-creatine dilution methods; and 4) assess 
the  effects  of  the  physical  activity  and  nutrition  intervention  on 
lifestyle behaviors, body composition, chemotoxicities, and health- 
care utilization, assessed 12 months from diagnosis.

tion on relative dose intensity and chemotoxicities in 270 women 
65  years  of  age  and  older  receiving  chemotherapy  for  stage  I 
through III breast cancer. The intervention will last the length of 
chemotherapy  (typically  12-24 weeks,  regimen  dependent).  All 
participants will be provided with a computer tablet and a fitness 
watch.  Women  in  the  treatment  group  will  receive  telehealth 
delivered  1  on  1  resistance  training  coaching  twice  weekly  over 
Zoom and will be asked to accumulate 90 minutes of moderate- 
intensity  aerobic  training  weekly  (intensity  monitored  by  Borg 
Rating  of  Perceived  Exertion).  Women  in  the  supportive  care 
comparison  arm  will  receive  nonexercise  supportive  care  on  a 
tablet.  Older  women  experience  worse  breast  cancer–specific 
outcomes  than  younger  women,  likely  because  of  undertreat-
ment  of  their  cancers  and  increased  treatment-related  toxicity 
(36-39).  The  Cancer  and  Aging  Research  Group—Breast  Cancer 
chemotoxicity score (40) will be used at baseline to balance ran-
domization  according 
chemotoxicities. 
Participants  will  be  recruited  before  the  second  chemotherapy 
cycle  for  baseline  assessments,  then  they  will  be  randomly 
assigned  to  the  THRIVE-65  intervention  or  the  supportive  care 
comparison arm. The unique study measures to be conducted in 
THRIVE-65  at  baseline  and  at  the  end  of  chemotherapy  are  the 
geriatric assessment (subjective and objective measures of func-
tional  status,  cognition,  review  of  comorbidities,  medication 
review,  nutritional  and  psychological  status).  THRIVE-65  will 
address 3 specific aims: 1) Assess the effects of the intervention 
on relative dose intensity, 2) assess the effects of the intervention 
on chemotoxicities, and 3) evaluate intervention implementation 
requirements as well as collection of facilitators and barriers to 
implementation  from  key  stakeholders  in  anticipation  of  a  suc-
cessful trial and the long-term goals for broad implementation of 
the intervention.

Integrated common data elements

All ENICTO U01 projects must share all common data elements, 
data generated in pilot and collaborative projects, and all study 
resources  with  the  Coordinating  Center.  At  the  end  of  the 
Consortium  funding  period,  a  deidentified  dataset  will be  made 
available  to  the  broader  research  community  through  1  of  the 
controlled-access data repositories that the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) maintains (41,42).

Six  working  groups  promote  standardized  integration  of 
enhanced phenotyping and serial assessments across the 4 proj-
ects (Figure 2). In the sections that follow, we describe these com-
mon data elements.

Relative dose intensity
Chemotherapy relative dose intensity is the primary endpoint in 
all 4 ENICTO intervention trials. It is a single quantitative meas-
ure  that  integrates  dose  reductions,  dose  delays,  and  early  dis-
continuation,  all  of  which  are  typically  the  result  of  treatment- 
related toxicities. Many studies have demonstrated that chemo-
therapy  relative  dose  intensities  higher  than  70%,  80%,  or  85% 
have been associated with improved disease-free and overall sur-
vival (43-47). In ENICTO, relative dose intensity will be calculated 
in  2  ways,  each  an  adaptation  of  the  calculations  proposed  by 
Weycker  et  al.  (48).  The  first  method  will  consider  all  drugs  in 
any regimen received throughout the entire chemotherapy treat-
ment period. This method will serve as the primary outcome for 
all 4 trials. The second method will consider only drugs that are 
part  of  the  first  chemotherapy  regimen  the  treating  oncologist

prescribes  (Box  1).  Typically,  the  delivered  dose  intensity  and 
standard dose intensity are calculated from the first cycle of che-
motherapy  administered  or  intended.  In  the  ENICTO  projects, 
however, patients are eligible to be enrolled after the first chemo-
therapy visit, and intervention effects  on relative dose  intensity 
can  occur  only  after  the  intervention  is  initiated.  Thus,  in  the 
ENICTO  trials,  only  cycles  of  chemotherapy  administered  after 
random  assignment  will  be  considered  in  the  delivered  dose 
intensity calculation. For example, if the participant is randomly 
assigned  after  the  first  chemotherapy  cycle  has  been  delivered, 
the dose for the second chemotherapy cycle will be used as the 
threshold  for  establishing  100%  of  relative  dose  intensity.  In 
other words, the standard dose intensity calculation also will use 
the dose of therapy administered during the first cycle after ran-
dom  assignment  as  the  planned  dose.  The  planned  number  of 
cycles  will  be  the  number  of  cycles  remaining  after  random 
assignment.

The  relative  dose  intensity  formula  will  be  applied  to  each 
chemotherapy  drug  or  administration  method  that  is  adminis-
tered as part of the overall chemotherapy regimen. Relative dose 
intensity values will then be summed and divided by the number 
of chemotherapy drugs administered to derive the total relative 
dose intensity score for the overall chemotherapy regimen.

Secondary  treatment-related  outcomes  include  dose  delays 
(defined  as  any  delay  or  a  specific  toxicity-related  delay  of  any 
individual drug >5 days), dose reductions (defined as any reduc-
tion in the formula used to order chemotherapy (mg/m2, mg/kg, 
area under the curve) of at least 5% after the first cycle of chemo-
therapy administered after study randomization), and early stop-
page (defined as the termination of at least 1 drug in a regimen 
before the intended number of cycles).

The  use  of  relative  dose  intensity  as  an  endpoint  in  the 
ENICTO  Consortium enhances the  rigor  because  regardless of a 
patient’s  adherence  to  the  intervention  or  follow-up  status  and 
barring  withdrawal  of  consent,  relative  dose  intensity  informa-
tion  will  be  complete,  given  that  it  will  be  obtained  from  elec-
tronic health records for all study participants.

The  actual  primary  outcome  varies  according  to  the  sample 
size calculations for each individual trial. ACTION and TEAL are 
powered to evaluate relative dose intensity as a continuous vari-
able. THRIVE-65 will analyze the proportion of participants who 
reach a threshold of 85%, based on published evidence that this 
threshold  predicts  future  recurrence  and  mortality  (46,47,49). 
TNT  will  analyze  the  proportion  of  participants  who  reach  a 
threshold of 90%, based on evidence that this relative dose inten-
sity  was  associated  with  a  reduced  risk  of  recurrence  (50). 
Continuous  relative  dose  intensity  will  be  the  common  relative 
dose intensity outcome across the 4 trials.

All  ENICTO  trials  will  collect  standardized  symptom  data, 
including information about the type, grade, and the relationship 
of  symptoms  to  treatment  and  to  the  study  intervention.  The 
common instrument used across all trials is the PRO-CTCAE (32). 
In addition to collecting these data at day 1 of each cycle, most 
trials are collecting PRO-CTCAE data on day 8 of each cycle, given 
evidence that symptom profile changes over the course of a che-
motherapy cycle (51). TNT will also use a dedicated clinical trial 
nurse to adjudicate and grade toxicities according to CTCAE, ver-
sion  5.0  (52).  A  common  core  of  symptoms  is  included  in  the 
checklist,  and  each  trial  will  supplement  this  core  list  with 
disease-specific  symptom  questions.  Data  on  unplanned  clinic 
visits,  emergency  department  visits,  and  hospitalizations  will 
also  be  collected.  Electronic  health  records  will  be  reviewed  at 
the start of each chemotherapy infusion cycle to record elements

tion, liver function, and general laboratory tests.

Body composition
The ENICTO trials assess body composition in 3 ways, with vary-
ing  overlap  across  trials.  Three  trials  are  using  CT  scans 
(ACTION, TEAL, TNT), 1 is using dual-energy x-ray absorptiome-
try (ACTION), and 2 are using the urinary biomarker D3-creatine 
dilution method (TEAL, THRIVE-65) (53). Standard operating pro-
cedures  were  developed  for  each  modality.  In  addition  to  these 
methods,  all  trials  will  capture  anthropometric  data  (including 
waist to hip ratio and abdominal circumference) before and after 
cancer  treatment  using  a  research-quality,  repeated-use  tape 
measure  and  body  mass  index  based  on  measured  weight  and 
height.

Three  ENICTO  trials  (ACTION,  TEAL,  TNT)  will  segment  pre-
treatment  diagnostic  CT  scans  to  determine  the  cross-sectional 
area  (ie,  quantity)  and  radiodensity  (ie,  quality)  of  skeletal 
muscle, visceral adipose tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue. 
TEAL and TNT will also interpret CT scans at other time points 
during follow-up, including after cancer treatment. A single-slice 
CT  scan  at  the  L3  vertebra  (54-56)  will  be  segmented  using  a 
semiautomated,  commercially  available  software  set  with  pre-
specified Hounsfield units for each tissue type.

Exercise and activity monitoring
A  key  eligibility  criterion  across  all  ENICTO  trials  is  physical 
activity  levels  below  the  intervention  volume.  Accordingly,  3  of 
the 4 trials employ validated, structured questionnaires to assess 
baseline physical activity levels (57-59), whereas 1 trial uses self- 
report of less than 60 min/wk. At baseline and follow-up, 3 of the

(ActiGraph,  Pensacola,  FL)  for  1-week  periods  to  measure 
minutes  of  light-,  moderate-,  and  vigorous-intensity  physical 
activity,  with  cut  points  based  on  population-specific  values 
(60,61).  Finally,  all  sites  are  using  wrist-based  devices  (Fitbit, 
Withings Scan Watch [Withings, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France) to 
monitor  all  activity  (structured  and  volitional)  throughout  the 
intervention. Data from these devices will be harmonized across 
sites using Monitor Independent Movement Summary units (62).

An  essential  methodological  consideration  when  designing 
exercise  trials  is  the  fundamental  components  of  the  exercise 
prescription (ie, frequency, intensity, time, type, and progression) 
for aerobic training or resistance training. Accordingly, all trials 
have defined exercise prescriptions using these principles, with 2 
of the trials using aerobic training alone and the other 2 using a 
combination  of  aerobic  and  resistance  training  (Supplementary 
Table 2, available online). Monitoring of exercise adherence has 
typically  focused  on  the  proportion  of  those  individuals  lost  to 
follow-up  (ie,  the  ratio  of  participants  completing  follow-up 
assessments  to  the  total  number  enrolled)  and  attendance  (ie, 
the ratio of attended to planned chemotherapy treatments), and 
(9). 
few  trials  have  rigorously  monitored  exercise  safety 
Therefore,  data  on  the  actual  tolerability  and  safety  of  exercise 
training  during  chemotherapy  to  date  are  limited.  Accordingly, 
all  trials  will  evaluate  exercise  adherence,  as  previously 
described (63,64), and will report the frequency and type of seri-
ous (eg, life-threatening, requiring hospitalization, causing nota-
ble  incapacity)  and  nonserious  (eg,  knee  or  back  pain)  adverse 
events  during  all  exercise  training  sessions.  Each  site  also  will 
use  the  Borg  Rating  of  Perceived  Exertion  scale  (65)  and  the 
Exercise  Feeling  Scale  (66)  at  each  exercise  session  to  monitor 
patient-reported exercise experience.

Harmonization of exercise-related biomarkers is important to 
determine  the  effects  of  exercise  training  on  physiological  end-
points. All trials will collect preintervention and postintervention 
data  on  cardiorespiratory  fitness,  using  either  a  submaximal 
exercise test or  a 6-minute walk  test (67), and strength, using a 
hand grip-strength test.

Diet and malnutrition
All projects will collect 24-hour dietary recalls from participants 
on 2 randomly assigned nonconsecutive days at baseline and the 
end  of  the  intervention  period.  This  is  accomplished  with 
interviewer-assisted  multipass  dietary  recalls  conducted  by  the 
University of Arizona Behavioral Measurement and Interventions 
Shared  Resource  (68)  (TEAL  and  THRIVE-65)  or  interviewer- 
assisted  completion  of  the  NCI’s  Automated  Self-Administered 
Dietary  Assessment  Tool  (69)  dietary  recall  (ACTION  and  TNT). 
Dietary supplement use will also be assessed. Overall diet quality 
using  dietary  pattern  scores  such  as  the  Healthy  Eating  Index- 
2020  (70)  and  the  World  Cancer  Research  Fund  and  American 
Institute for Cancer Research Adherence Score (71,72) will be cal-
culated. TEAL participants will be asked to complete the Arizona 
Food Frequency Questionnaire (73) at baseline to collect data on 
usual  dietary  intake  before  treatment,  which  also  uses  the  US 
Department  of  Agriculture  Food  and  Nutrient  Database  for 
Dietary Studies (74).

In  addition,  TEAL  and  THRIVE-65  participants  will  monitor 
adherence to study-specified dietary goals during the trial, in the 
intervention arms. TEAL participants will complete an app-based 
food log to report aspects of their dietary intake during the inter-
vention (dietary fiber, fruit and vegetable intake, protein, added 

K. H. Schmitz et al. 

|  15  

sugars, and processed and red meat). THRIVE-65 participants will 
complete daily high-protein food checklists.

Malnutrition  status  will  be  determined  either  directly  using 
the  Patient-Generated Subjective  Global  Assessment (75)  (TEAL) 
or indirectly using changes in daily weight measurements (TNT) 
and  responses  from  the  PRO-CTCAE  (76)  measurement  system 
(ACTION,  TEAL,  THRIVE-65,  and  TNT).  PRO-CTCAE  data  will  be 
used to determine the prevalence of nutrition impact symptoms 
(77) during each chemotherapy cycle.

Patient-reported outcomes
A  major  goal  of  the  PRO  instrument  selection  process  was  to 
ensure harmonization across several ENICTO domains of interest 
(eg, pain, disease-specific symptom burden, health-related qual-
ity of life [HRQOL]) and determine the optimal timing of adminis-
tration  for  key  measures  such  as  the  PRO-CTCAE  (32),  which 
captures  symptomatic  treatment  toxicity  by  self-report.  The 
process for selecting common PRO data elements also considered 
1) alignment with the NCI requests for application (eg, symptom 
toxicities, health behaviors), 2) evidence of well-validated instru-
ments  for  use  across  multiple  cancer  populations  and  ethnic 
groups, 3) relevance to the participants in each project, 4) study 
hypotheses (eg, impact of physical activity on symptom burden), 
and 5) expert input and discussion through workgroup meetings 
investigators.

Instrument selection was prioritized based on the validity of the 
measure and expected participant burden.

the  project  principal 

The  PRO  data  elements  include  multiple  constructs  across  2 
broad  domains:  HRQOL  and  physical  function.  Within  the 
HRQOL  domain,  measures  were  selected  to  assess  general 
HRQOL, depression, anxiety, emotional well-being, social activity 
and function, and social support. General HRQOL, including emo-
tional well-being, is  a common  data element across  all projects 
captured  with  the  36-Item  Short  Form  Health  Survey  (78),  a 
widely  used  and  well-validated  measure  that  assesses  multiple 
HRQOL domains. Another common data element assessed across 
all ENICTO projects is anxiety, which is captured by the PROMIS 
Anxiety  Short-Form  questionnaire  (79).  Regarding  the  physical 
function  domain,  all  projects  assess  overall  physical  function 
and  cancer-specific  symptom  burden  using  the  36-Item  Short 
Form  Health  Survey  or  the  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer 
Therapy cancer-specific subscales (78,80).

Implementation science

Members from all projects, the Coordinating Center, and the NCI 
have adapted the process described by Jolles Perez et al. (81) and 
reviewed  grant  proposals,  protocols,  and  manuals  of  procedure 
to  develop  a  function  and  form  matrix  outlining  each  inter-
vention’s core functions (basic purpose of the intervention), sub-
functions  (required  processes),  and  forms  (activities  related  to 
intervention  implementation).  Adaptations  will  be  documented 
systematically across all projects. Elements of the interventions 
required for implementation will be updated as adaptations are 
made  during  the  projects.  The  working  group  has  collectively 
reviewed validated program satisfaction questionnaires, adapted 
relevant  questions  for  the  ENICTO  initiative,  and  developed  a 
program  satisfaction  and  intervention  acceptability  instrument 
for  patient  assessment.  Future  work  for  this  working  group 
includes  operationalization  of  the  dimensions  of  the  Reach, 
Implementation,  and  Maintenance 
Effectiveness,  Adoption, 
framework (82,83) and identification of which data are available 
to measure these outcomes in each ENICTO research project.

Current status and future directions

All 4 of the ENICTO Consortium projects were opened to recruit-
ment  in  2023.  The  consortium  funding  mechanisms  (U01/U24) 
include set-aside funds for new cross-consortium data collection 
to  address  novel  and  emerging  areas  in  the  field  and  to  pursue 
questions with collective data that are not feasible for individual 
projects,  given  a  harmonized  dataset  that  will  include  relative 
dose  intensity,  symptom  data,  body  composition,  exercise  rela-
tive dose intensity, diet, and patient-reported outcomes.

Although  the  ENICTO  Consortium  was  funded  and  began 
before  the  January  2023  changes  to  the  NIH  Data  Management 
and Sharing Policy (84), ENICTO requires extensive data and pro-
tocol sharing, and the Coordinating Center staff have developed 
a  joint  consortium-wide  agreement  (incorporating  data  user 
agreements,  material  sharing  agreements,  and  confidentiality 
agreements)  that  has  been approved  by the  individual  U01  per-
formance sites.

The  Coordinating  Center  has  developed  and  maintains  an 
external (ENICTO.org) and an internal study website. In addition, 
the  ENICTO  Consortium  has  launched  the  Exercise  Oncology/ 
Oncology  Nutrition  Network  (https://enicto.bsc.gwu.edu/web/ 
enicto/eon-network)  to  engage  the  broader  community  of 
researchers  and  clinicians  in  the  work  of  the  consortium  and 
facilitate networking and collaboration between the 2 fields.

Summary

The  4  ENICTO  projects  will  inform  clinical  practice  guidelines 
recognizing exercise and medical nutrition therapy as critical for 
delivering  high-quality,  evidence-based  cancer  care.  Findings 
from the ENICTO Consortium have the potential to accelerate a 
paradigm  shift  in  oncology  care  such  that  patients  with  cancer 
could receive exercise and nutrition programming as the stand-
ard  of  care  in  tandem  with  chemotherapy  to  improve  relative 
dose intensity for a curative outcome.

Data availability

In accordance with the NIH Public Access Policy, we will provide 
all manuscripts, including this article, to PubMed Central. At the 
end  of  the  funding  period,  a  deidentified  dataset  will  be  made 
available  to  the  broader  research  community  through  1  of  the 
controlled-access  data  repositories  the  NIH  maintains,  such  as 
the  database  of  Genotypes  and  Phenotypes.  No  new  data  were 
generated or analyzed for this manuscript.
