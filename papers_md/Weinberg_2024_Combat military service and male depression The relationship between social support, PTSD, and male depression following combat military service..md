Abstract
Background: Soldiers in military service are at risk of exposure to traumatic and stressful experiences, which can lead 
to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of depression. In the context of veterans’ PTSD 
and depression, social support has been shown to be a very significant resource. However, while general depression has 
been examined among veterans and although combat soldiers are often men, male depression has been rarely examined. 
Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the relationships between social support, PTSD symptoms, and male 
depression among veterans.
Methods: Five hundred and ninety-five male combat veterans completed a demographic questionnaire and measures of 
social support, PTSD, and male depression, including the specific symptoms of anger, substance use, social withdrawal, 
and restricted emotions.
Results:  Structural-equation-model  analyses  showed  that  social  support  was  negatively  associated  with  both  PTSD 
symptoms and depression symptoms. Specifically, social support showed lower trends of associations with substance 
use and anger; whereas there were higher associations with social withdrawal and restricted emotions. PTSD showed 
the strongest association with anger. Thus, we can see that social support is a key resource for coping with PTSD and 
different symptoms of male depression.
Conclusion: Greater attention to social support, PTSD, and aspects of male depression could assist the development of 
intervention and therapeutic programs and also help to prevent the misdiagnosis of depression among military veterans.

Soldiers in military service are at risk of exposure to trau-
matic  and  stressful  experiences,  such  as  injury,  coming 
under fire, and witnessing the suffering or death of fellow 
service  members  and  civilians  (Brownlow  et  al.,  2018; 
Doody et al., 2022; Vinokur et al., 2011). It has long been 
demonstrated that such exposure can lead to emotional dis-
tress  and  mental-health  problems  (Hoge  et  al.,  2006; 
Reijnen  et  al.,  2015;  Stevelink  et  al.,  2018).  Within  this 
context, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depres-
sion symptoms have been shown to be the most significant 
consequences  of  such  exposure  (Nichter  et  al.,  2019; 
Vaughan et al., 2014; Williamson et al., 2018).

PTSD is characterized by a wide array of symptoms fol-
lowing a traumatic event. These symptoms include intru-
sive trauma-related memories, avoidance of trauma-related 
cues,  negative  cognitions  and  mood,  and  alterations  in 

arousal (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022). A 
handful  of  studies  have  demonstrated  the  prevalence  and 
severe  impact  of  PTSD  symptoms  on  veterans  following 
their  military  service  (Asnaani  et  al.,  2014;  Fulton  et  al., 
2015; Pacella et al., 2013; Sherman et al., 2016). Depression 
has been shown to be another major  emotional  state  that

affects  veterans  following  their  military  service  (Fortney 
et al., 2016; Trivedi et al., 2015). According to the DSM-
5-TR (APA, 2022), depression can include sadness, feel-
ings  of  emptiness,  fatigue,  or  irritable  mood,  along  with 
sleeping  problems  and  suicidal  ideation,  which  together 
with specific cognitive and somatic symptoms lead to sig-
nificantly impaired functioning (Maina et al., 2016). Taken 
together,  emerging  evidence  suggests  that  the  co-occur-
rence of PTSD symptoms and depression symptoms may 
impose an even greater burden on mental health and well-
being than either condition alone (Flory & Yehuda, 2022).
Within  the  context  of  depression,  gender  differences 
have been demonstrated over the years, such as more com-
mon diagnoses and a higher risk of suicide attempts among 
women and higher rates of suicide completion among men 
(APA,  2013;  Sedlinska  et  al.,  2021).  These  differences 
suggest that depression symptoms might manifest differ-
ently  among  men  and  women,  as  some  of  the  typical 
symptoms (such as sadness and the seeking of help) chal-
lenge culturally accepted masculine codes of behavior and 
so  are  less  commonly  exhibited  by  men  (Mahalik  et  al., 
2021;  Moynihan,  1998).  On  the  other  hand,  men  might 
exhibit  other  emotional  symptoms  following  depression 
that do align with masculine gender norms, such as exter-
nalizing  behaviors,  anxiety,  anger,  irritability  and  antiso-
cial  behavior,  emotional  suppression,  substance  misuse, 
and  risk-seeking  (Lynch  &  Kilmartin,  2013;  Sedlinska 
et al., 2021; Sigurdsson et al., 2015). Notably, women have 
been  shown  to  report  higher  levels  of  depression  symp-
toms substantially more often than men, including in stud-
ies  of  specific  populations  such  as  medical  students 
(Dabbagh et al., 2023; Dutta et al., 2023), individuals with 
diabetes (Anderson et al., 2001), gastroenterology patients 
(Alosaimi et al., 2014), and university students during the 
early part of the COVID-19 pandemic (Debowska et al., 
2022). This concept might be even more significant in the 
case  of  male  combat  veterans,  who  were  trained  during 
their military service to respond aggressively under stress-
ful conditions and who may experience emotional distress 
following traumatic experiences they endured during their 
military  service.  However,  while  general  depression  has 
been examined among veterans and although combat sol-
diers are often men, male depression has been rarely exam-
ined. This study aimed to fill this gap.

In the context of veterans’ PTSD and depression, social 
support has been found to be a very significant resource. 
Extensive trauma research has shown that social support is 
a significant coping resource (Besser et al., 2014; Brewin 
et al., 2000; Ozer et al., 2003; Weinberg, 2018), especially 
among veterans. Among that population, it has been shown 
to  be  a  paramount  resource  for  coping  with  PTSD  and 
depression  symptoms  (Cox  et  al.,  2017;  Painter  et  al., 
2016; Pietrzak et al., 2010). Nevertheless, research studies 
have often focused on general depression symptoms and 
paid less attention to the relationships between social sup-
port and specific manifestations of male depression.

To  bridge  this  gap  in  our  knowledge  regarding  social 
support,  PTSD  symptoms,  and  male  depression  among 
veterans and in accordance with the theoretical framework 
that views PTSD as the dominant disorder following trau-
matic events, which drives the development of comorbid 
depression (Ginzburg et al., 2010; Stander et al., 2014), the 
present  study  examined  the  relationship  between  social 
support, PTSD symptoms, and male depression.

Two hypotheses were examined:

1.  Social support will be associated with lower levels 
of  PTSD  symptoms  and  lower  levels  of  male 
depression.

2.  PTSD  symptoms  will  be  associated  with  higher 

levels of male depression symptoms.

Within this concept we hypothesized that the subscales of 
the male depression symptoms will demonstrate different 
associations  and  trends  with  social  support  and  PTSD 
symptoms. Namely, masculine depressive symptoms will 
show stronger associations and trends.

Method

Participants

The  sample  consisted  of  595  male  combat  veterans. The 
participants  ranged  in  age  from  24  to  47 years,  with  an 
average  age  of  31.97 years  (SD = 5.20)  and  their  average 
number of years of education was 12.58 (SD = 2.06). Three 
hundred and fourteen participants (52.8%) reported a high 
financial status, 111 (18.7%) reported an average financial 
status,  and  170  (28.6%)  reported  a  low  financial  status. 
Among the participants, 198 (33.7%) were married or in a 
close intimate relationship and 389 (66.3%) were single or 
divorced.  Nearly  all  of  the  participants  (92.6%)  were 
exposed  to  a  life-threatening  event  during  their  military 
service  and  70  (11.8%)  participants  were  injured  during 
their service.

Measures

Demographic and general questionnaire.  This questionnaire 
covered  demographic  variables  such  as  age,  education, 
financial situation, and personal status, as well as general 
information regarding military service, such as service in a 
combat unit, exposure to traumatic life-threatening events 
during service, and injury during the course of one’s mili-
tary service.

PTSD  symptoms.  PTSD  symptoms  were  evaluated  using 
the  Posttraumatic  Stress  Disorder  Checklist  (PCL-5; 
Weathers  et  al.,  2013).  This  is  a  20-item  questionnaire, 
corresponding to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD accord-
ing to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). The severity of each item 
is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at 

Weinberg et al. 

803

all) to 4 (extremely). Higher scores reflect higher levels of 
PTSD symptoms. The Cronbach’s alpha internal-consist-
ency coefficient for this scale was .96.

Male depression.  Male depression was examined using the 
Men’s Depression Inventory (Fields, 2010). This question-
naire  includes  29  items  that  examine  male  depression 
symptoms. The scale relates to four types of male depres-
sion  symptoms:  (1)  anger,  aggression,  and  hostility;  (2) 
substance  use;  (3)  social  withdrawal;  and  (4)  restricted 
emotions. Higher scores reflect higher levels of symptoms. 
For each item, respondents are asked to rate the extent to 
which they agree with the statements based on how they 
have felt over the past 2 weeks. The severity of each item 
is rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly 
disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). In the current study, due to 
a  technical  error,  two  items  (Items  12  and  13)  were  not 
included.  Therefore,  the  total  scale  included  27  items. 
Despite  this  error,  the  Cronbach’s  alpha  internal-consist-
ency coefficient for the total scale was .90. The Cronbach’s 
alpha  internal-consistency  coefficients  for  the  different 
symptoms were as follows: .90 for anger, aggression and 
hostility; .85 for substance use; .65 for social withdrawal; 
and .85 for restricted emotions.

Social  support.  Social  support  was  examined  using  the 
Multidimensional  Scale  of  Perceived  Social  Support 
(Zimet  et  al.,  1988).  This  questionnaire  relates  to  three 
sources of social support (i.e. family, friends, and signifi-
cant other), with items that are each rated on a 7-point Lik-
ert  scale  ranging  from  1  (major  disagreement  with  the 
item) to 7 (major agreement with the item). Higher scores 
reflect higher levels of perceived social support. The Cron-
bach’s alpha internal-consistency coefficient for this scale 
was .95.

Procedure

Following the approval of the University’s ethics commit-
tee (blinded for review), an initial request to take part in 
the  study  was  distributed  by  the  B’Shvil  Hamachar 
Organization.  This  organization  conducts  nature-assisted 
group  interventions  for  Israeli  combat  military  veterans 
and is the largest organization in the country that conducts 
such interventions. Those who took part in a program run 
by the organization were asked to participate in the study 
and  fill  out  the  study  questionnaires.  Participation  in  the 
study  was  voluntary  and  it  was  clearly  stated  that  those 
who chose not to participate would not be harmed in any 
way and that choosing not to participate would not affect 
anyone’s ability to take part in the organization’s activities. 
This  was  also  highlighted  in  the  informed-consent  form, 
which also stated that participation in the study was volun-
tary  and  that  participants  could  end  their  participation  at 
any  stage.  Keeping  participants’  safety  in  mind,  the 

questionnaires were anonymous. Assistance was limited to 
clarifying instructions. No compensation was offered for 
participation  in  this  study.  Data  were  collected  between 
February 2021 and December 2022.

Data analysis

In the first stage of the data analysis, we used IBM SPSS 
Statistics 27 to examine the means of the research varia-
bles and their standard deviations, as well as correlations 
between those variables. In the second stage of our analy-
sis,  we  conducted  structural-equation  modeling  using 
AMOS (version 27), to examine how social support, PTSD 
symptoms,  and  male  depression  are  associated  with  one 
another. First, we ran a general model referring to the total 
scale  of  male  depression  as  a  general  concept. Then,  we 
ran an additional structural-equation model to examine the 
relationships  between  social  support,  PTSD  symptoms, 
and the four different depression symptoms: anger, aggres-
sion, and hostility; substance use; social withdrawal; and 
restricted emotions. In both models, we controlled for age, 
education, financial status, and injury.

Results

In  the  first  stage  of  the  data  analysis,  we  examined  the 
means of the research variables and their standard devia-
tions,  as  well  as  correlations  between  those  variables 
(Table 1). As shown in Table 1, negative correlations were 
found  between  social  support  and  PTSD  symptoms 
(r = −.34; p < .01) and between social support and the total 
score for male depression (r = −.51; p < .01). In addition, a 
positive correlation was found between PTSD symptoms 
and the total score for male depression (r = −.66; p < .01). 
When  we  examined  the  relationship  between  social  sup-
port and PTSD in light of the different symptoms of male 
depression, we found negative correlations between social 
support and all four of the examined symptoms. Negative 
correlations were found between social support and anger, 
aggression, and hostility (r = −.33; p < .01); social support 
and  substance  use  (r = −.26;  p < .01);  social  support  and 
social  withdrawal  (r = −.57;  p < .01);  and  social  support 
and restricted emotions (r = −.38; p < .01). Reversed trends 
were found for the relationships between PTSD symptoms 
and  the  different  symptoms  of  male  depression.  That  is, 
positive correlations were found between PTSD and anger, 
aggression, and hostility (r = .66; p < .01); PTSD and sub-
stance use (r = .39; p < .01); PTSD and social withdrawal 
(r = .52;  p < .01);  and  PTSD  and  restricted  emotions 
(r = .44; p < .01).

We then used structural-equation modeling to examine 
how social support, PTSD symptoms, and male depression 
were associated with one another. First, we ran a general 
model referring to the total scale of male depression as a 
general  concept  (Figure  1).  Following  that,  as  we  were

interested in understanding the relationships between the 
study variables and the different symptoms of male depres-
sion,  we  ran  an  additional  structural-equation  model 
(Figure 2) to examine the relationships between social sup-
port, PTSD symptoms, and the four different symptoms of 
male  depression:  anger,  aggression,  and  hostility;  sub-
stance use; social withdrawal; and restricted emotions. In 
both  models  age,  education,  financial  status  and  injury 
were controlled as confounding variables but are not pre-
sented for the sake of simplicity and readability.

The  first  model  (Figure  1)  fit 

the  data  well: 
χ2(13) = 11.121; 
p = .601;  χ2/df = 0.86;  NFI = 0.981; 
CFI = 1.000;  and  RMSEA = 0.996.  The  second  model 
(Figure 2) also fit the data well: χ2(23) = 21.633; p = .542; 
χ2/df = 0.94; NFI = 0.984; CFI = 1.000; and RMSEA = 0.000.
As  shown  in  Figure  1,  social  support  was  negatively 
associated with both PTSD symptoms (β = −.32, p < .001) 
and male depression symptoms (β = −.33, p < .001). PTSD 
symptoms  were  positively  associated  with  male  depres-
sion  (β = .55,  p < .001).  The  study  model  significantly 
explained  15%  of  the  variance  in  PTSD  symptoms  and 
52% of the variance in male depression.

Regarding  the  second  model  and  the  different  symp-
toms of male depression, as shown in Figure 2, social sup-
port was negatively associated with anger, aggression, and 
hostility  (β = −.13,  p < .001);  substance  use  (β = −.14, 
p < .001);  social  withdrawal  (β = −.44,  p < .001);  and 
restricted  emotions  (β = −.27,  p < .001).  PTSD  was  posi-
tively  associated  with  anger,  aggression,  and  hostility 
(β = .61, p < .001); substance use (β = .34, p < .001); social 

withdrawal  (β = .37,  p < .001);  and  restricted  emotions 
(β = .35, p < .001). The study model significantly explained 
46%  of  the  variance  in  aggression  and  hostility;  17%  of 
substance  use;  44%  of  social  withdrawal;  and  25%  of 
restricted emotions.

Discussion

The main goal of this study was to examine the relation-
ships between social support, PTSD symptoms, and male 
depression  among  combat  veterans.  In  accordance  with 
our  research  hypothesis,  social  support  was  found  to  be 
associated with lower levels of PTSD symptoms and male 
depression.  This  finding  further  emphasizes  the  impor-
tance of social support and its significant relationship with 
PTSD  symptoms  and  depression  following  exposure  to 
trauma (Cox et al., 2017; Ozer et al., 2003; Painter et al., 
2016; Weinberg, 2018) among combat veterans. Moreover, 
among veterans, depression has often been examined as a 
general  variable  (Cox  et  al.,  2017;  Painter  et  al.,  2016; 
Pietrzak  et  al.,  2010),  with  less  attention  paid  to  unique 
male  gender  characteristics  of  this  condition.  Thus,  the 
relationship  demonstrated  between  social  support  and 
male depression in the present study illuminates the poten-
tial importance of social support in the context of specific 
levels and manifestations of male depression.

Our examination of the second study model (Figure 2) 
revealed  an  interesting  relationship  and  trend  between 
social support and the different symptoms of male depres-
sion. We observed lower relationships between social sup-
port  and  substance  use  and  between  social  support  and 
anger,  aggression,  and  hostility,  and  higher  relationships 
between social support and social withdrawal and between 
social  support  and  restricted  emotions. According  to  our 
findings,  different  symptoms  of  male  depression  might 
interact  differently  with  social  support.  These  findings 
suggest that male depression reflects additional manifesta-
tions  of  posttraumatic  distress,  which  are  aligned  with 
masculine  gender  norms  (Lynch  &  Kilmartin,  2013; 
Sedlinska et al., 2021; Sigurdsson et al., 2015). Accordingly, 
anger, substance use, antisocial, and externalizing behav-
iors are more congruent with masculine norms than sad-
ness or seeking for help. Therefore, it is possible that while

social  support  is  more  available  in  response  to  classical 
‘vulnerability’ or ‘crying out’ for help expressions such as 
social  withdrawal,  avoidance,  emotional  regulation,  and 
restricted emotions are less acceptable. These dimensions 
of vulnerability might be more compatible with the exter-
nal social surroundings’ feelings of empathy and a desire 
to help trauma survivors. On the other hand, masculine or 
potentially  ‘abusive’  symptoms,  such  as  aggression  and 
harmful  behavior,  substance  use  and  anger,  aggression, 
and hostility might cause individuals in the veterans’ social 
surroundings to feel less comfortable and more cautious in 
their  interactions  with  them.  This,  in  turn,  would  be 
reflected in a lower trend between social support and mas-
culine depression symptoms.

This concept could also be observed in the context of 
our second study hypothesis, which examined the relation-
ship between PTSD symptoms and male depression. In the 
realm of trauma and depression, research has demonstrated 
a  high  comorbidity  between  PTSD  and  depression,  a 
comorbidity that may impose a great mental-health burden 
(Flory  &  Yehuda,  2022).  The  significant  relationships 
between PTSD and symptoms of male depression demon-
strated in the present study further emphasize the impor-
tance of understanding the comorbidity of PTSD and male 
depression. In the examination of the associations between 
PTSD  and  the  different  symptoms  of  depression,  the 
strongest association was found between PTSD symptoms 
and  anger,  aggression,  and  hostility.  This  finding  might 
suggest that, among male veterans, PTSD is especially and 
prominently associated with masculine depressive symp-
toms,  such  as  aggressive  behavior.  Awareness  of  this 

concept  should  be  integrated  into  the  diagnostic  process 
and  therapeutic  interventions,  to  provide  more  sensitive 
and  focused  interventions  to  address  veterans’  emotional 
distress.  Nevertheless,  one  should  bear  in  mind  that  the 
present  study  was  conducted  among  male  veterans.  It  is 
possible  that  the  different  dimensions  of  depression  are 
related and inclined to combat military service in general 
for both men and women regardless of gender rather than 
only for men. Thus, given the novelty of this study, further 
investigation is suggested among combat men and women 
veterans.

Taken together, these findings have important implica-
tions. When providing emotional assistance to combat vet-
erans  following  their  military  service,  it  is  important  to 
address  social  support  as  a  key  resource  for  coping  with 
PTSD and male depression symptoms. Therapists should 
harness and utilize social support with sensitivity relating 
to  the  different  symptoms  of  male  depression.  The  rela-
tionship between social support and depression symptoms 
such as social withdrawal and restricted emotions should 
be  preserved  and  strengthened.  While  the  relationship 
between  social  support  and  the  depression  symptoms  of 
substance use and anger, aggression, and hostility dimen-
sions,  which  showed  lower  trends  should  be  encouraged 
and  empowered  for  stronger  social  support.  Within  this 
context, therapists as well as policymakers should consider 
the  strong  relationship  between  PTSD  symptoms  and 
depression  symptoms  of  anger,  aggression,  and  hostility. 
Such attention could assist the tailoring of intervention and 
therapeutic programs and also help to prevent the misdiag-
nosis of depression among military veterans.

Several  limitations  of  this  work  should  be  noted. The 
relationships between the study variables were supported 
by a theoretical framework that views PTSD as the domi-
nant disorder that drives depression (Ginzburg et al., 2010; 
Stander et al., 2014). However, the cross-sectional nature 
of  this  study  precludes  any  conclusions  regarding  causal 
relationships.  In  addition,  all  participants  were  recruited 
through  the  B’Shvil  Hamachar  Organization.  Although 
this organization offers its programs to all military combat 
veterans, caution is required when generalizing these find-
ings. Another limitation related to the research sample is 
the inclusion of only male veterans. It is possible that the 
different symptoms of depression examined here are asso-
ciated with combat military service, in general, for people 
of all genders rather than only for men. Therefore, we sug-
gest that this study be replicated among female veterans as 
well, to allow for the examination of similarities and dif-
ferences between men and women. Nevertheless, despite 
these limitations, this study makes an important theoretical 
and practical contribution to our understanding of the rela-
tionships  between  social  support,  PTSD  symptoms,  and
