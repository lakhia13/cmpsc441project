Abstract

Objective: Identifying individuals at risk for cognitive decline, Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI), and dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a critical
need. Functional decline is associated with risk and can be efﬁciently assessed
by participants and study partners (SPs). We tested the hypothesis that SP-re-
ported functional decline is an independent predictor of dementia risk and cog-
nitive decline. Methods:
In 1048 older adults in the Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we measured associations between Everyday
Cognition Scale scores (ECog, self- and SP-reported versions) and (1) baseline
and longitudinal change in neuropsychological test (NPT scores) across multi-
ple cognitive domains; (2) diagnostic conversion to MCI or dementia. Models
included Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score and ApoE e4 genotype
(APOE) as predictors. Model ﬁts were compared with and without predictors
of interest included. Results: SP-reported ECog was the strongest predictor of
cognitive decline across multiple domains, as well as diagnostic conversion.
Self-reported ECog was associated with baseline NPT scores in some cognitive
domains, and diagnostic conversion to MCI in participants with biomarker evi-
dence for AD (elevated brain b-amyloid, Ab). Models including SP-reported
ECog were signiﬁcantly stronger at predicting outcomes. Conclusions: SP-re-
ported functional decline is an independent indicator of cognitive decline and
dementia risk, even when accounting for cognitive screening, genetic risk,
demographics, and self-report decline. The results provide a rationale for
greater utilization of SP-reported functional decline to identify those at risk for
dementia due to AD and other causes.

Introduction

Identiﬁcation of individuals at risk for cognitive decline,
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia, includ-
ing dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is a critical
need. In older adults, functional decline is associated with
AD pathology,1–3,and predicts future decline and disease
progression.4 Furthermore, preservation of everyday func-
tioning is important to patients and their families.5 Sub-
jective functional decline can be measured by asking the
individual him/herself or a study partner (SP) about
recent changes in activities of daily living.

A number of validated instruments that measure subjec-
tive decline are used in AD clinical trials and research stud-
ies.6–11 SP report of decline is associated with magnitude of
cognitive impairment determined from neuropsychological
test (NPT) assessment,12,13 and with diagnosis of MCI and
dementia due to AD.10,13–16 SP report of impairment is
associated moderately with abnormal
levels of AD
biomarkers, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
b-amyloid (Ab) burden, and regional brain volume1,17–19;
although some studies fail to ﬁnd such a relationship.20
Thus, there is accumulating evidence that the SP report of
functional and cognitive abilities can provide important
information for early identiﬁcation of preclinical AD and
for predicting objective cognitive status. The same relation-
ship is not observed as consistently for self-reported subjec-
tive cognitive and functional decline, where factors such as
depressed mood21–23 and lack of awareness associated with
dementia13,24,25 limit its usefulness.

Although previous studies have examined the associa-
tion between SP-reported cognitive and functional infor-
mation and various outcomes related to cognitive decline
and progression along the dementia disease continuum,
the additional predictive power of SP-report compared to
other predictors has not been established. Understanding
this is important because it will indicate whether the SP
report, in the absence of additional clinical measures, can
help identify those at risk for or with disease. Such ﬁnd-
ings would support the approach of several initiatives to
identify people at risk remotely, such as through reg-
istries,26 including remotely collected, SP-reported Every-

scale (SP-ECog).27 Determining

to facilitate screening and recruitment for AD clinical tri-
als, screening of older adults at risk for AD dementia and
other dementias in various healthcare settings, and identi-
ﬁcation of individuals who are good candidates to receive
future novel treatments. We investigated this issue using
SP report of functional decline in the Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Novel aspects of our
approach include (1) use of the ECog, which measures
SP- and self-reported subjective decline in instrumental
activities of daily living that map to multiple cognitive
domains; (2) inclusion of cognitive screening tool (Mini
Mental Status Exam, MMSE) and genetic risk (APOE) in
our multivariable models; and (3) analysis of the associa-
tion between baseline SP report of subjective decline and
future decline in NPT scores across multiple domains.
We tested the a priori hypotheses that: SP-ECog is signiﬁ-
cantly associated with baseline and longitudinal change in
NPT scores, and diagnostic conversion from cognitively
unimpaired (CU) to MCI or MCI to dementia. (2) SP-
ECog is signiﬁcantly associated with outcomes, even when
accounting for self-reported ECog (Self-ECog), MMSE,
APOE, and participant demographics; (3) Models without
SP-ECog are signiﬁcantly less powerful than those with
SP-ECog at predicting outcomes; (4) SP-ECog is associ-
ated with cognitive decline and diagnostic conversion in
Ab+ participants. Analyses of associations in Ab+ partici-
pants allow us to address the extent to which SP-report
subjective decline, measured by ECog, can speciﬁcally
is
identify cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia that
likely due to AD.

Methods

Participants

Data used in the preparation of this manuscript were
obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private part-
nership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner,
MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether
serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET, other bio-
logical markers, and clinical and NPT assessment can be
combined to measure the progression of MCI and early
AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.

All ADNI data were downloaded from www.loni.usc.edu/
ADNI between September–November 2018. We included
all participants with Ab PET imaging results, and comple-
tion of ECog (Table 1). Further details regarding ADNI
inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found at http://ad

ues of cortical regions to retention value of whole cerebel-
lum. Ab was dichotomized as positive or negative
(SuVR> 1.11 or less than < 1.11, respectively) using pre-
viously established thresholds to identify the presence of
Ab pathology.28,29

Everyday cognition scale

Clinical diagnosis

The ECog includes 39 questions, asked of both the partic-
ipant and the SP, that measure changes in functional
activities compared to 10 years ago using a ﬁve point
severity scale. Functional activities map to four cognitive
domains.7 Participants and SPs completed the ECog as
part of their ADNI protocol: at baseline, month 6, and
ongoing annual visits (new ADNI2 participants), or initial
ADNI2 visit and ongoing annual visits (ADNI1 and
ADNIGO follow-up participants). For analyses using lon-
gitudinal ECog, 844 participants with at least two self-
and SP-ECog scores were included.

APOE

APOE e4 genotype was determined by blood test at ADNI
screening visit. APOE was dichotomized as positive (at
least one APOE e4 allele) or negative (absence of any
APOE e4 alleles).

Statistical analysis

The objectives of the statistical analysis were to assess and
compare magnitudes of the associations of age, education,
MMSE, SP-ECog, Self-ECog, gender, and APOE with
change in repeated NPTs, and, diagnostic conversion.
Variables were compared between diagnostic groups using
Mann–Whitney test
for continuous variables and chi-
square tests for categorical variables.

Associations with NPTs

We ﬁt separate linear mixed effects models to each NPT
score, stratiﬁed by diagnostic group. Each model included
random intercepts and time effects, main effect terms for
Self-ECog, SP-ECog, age, education, MMSE, gender and
APOE status, and interactions of each predictor with
time. The time by predictor interaction terms were used
to assess the magnitude of the association of each predic-
tor with change in NPT score. Trails A and B scores were
log transformed and estimates back transformed to per-
centage effect. We also performed similar analyses in a
cohort limited to Ab+ participants. We accounted for
multiple comparisons (multiple NPTs) using false discov-
ery rate analysis.

Associations with diagnostic conversion

Weibull survival regression models were used to accom-
modate interval censored observations.38 We did not
observe the exact dates of conversion, only that the con-
version happened between two study visits. To assess the
associations of longitudinal changes in ECog with conver-
sion, we obtained participant-speciﬁc changes in each
ECog variable by ﬁtting linear mixed effects models with
random intercepts and slopes and time as the single pre-
dictor with each ECog variable as an outcome.

Likelihood ratio tests

For the Weibull survival models described above, three
variations of each model were run (1) including all vari-
ables: Age, education, MMSE, SP-ECog, Self-ECog, gender,
APOE; (2) excluding SP-ECog; (3) excluding Self-ECog,
APOE, and MMSE. The relative predictive strength of the
various models was assessed using Likelihood Ratio (LR)
tests. All analyses were completed using SAS Version 9.4.

Associations between subjective decline and
neuropsychological test scores

Overall results

We measured associations between ECog and NPT scores
(baseline and longitudinal change in scores) in CU and
MCI participants. In both CU and MCI, higher (worse)
SP-ECog scores were associated with greater decline in
ADAS13, LogMem, and AVLT. In MCI, higher SP-ECog
scores were also associated with greater decline in Boston
Naming and Trails B. (Fig. 1A). We also found associa-
tions between ECog (self- and SP-reported) and baseline
NPT test scores, summarized in Figure 1B. Besides ECog,
additional variables were signiﬁcantly associated with
decline in some NPTs (Table 2).

Associations between subjective decline and NPT
scores in Ab+ participants

In order to determine whether ECog predicts cognitive
decline in those at high risk for developing dementia due to
AD, we examined associations between ECog and NPT
scores in Ab+ participants. In CU Ab+ participants, higher
SP-ECog scores were associated with greater decline in
dLogMem,
iAVLT, dAVLT, and Trails B. Conversely,
higher Self-ECog scores were associated with lower levels of
decline in Trails B (Fig. 1A). In MCI Ab+ participants,
higher SP-ECog scores were associated with greater decline
in ADAS13, ADAS dMem,
iLogMem, and dLogMem.
Higher Self-ECog scores were associated with lower levels
of decline in iAVLT. We also found associations between
ECog (self- and SP-reported) and baseline NPT test scores
in Ab+ participants, summarized in Figure 1B.

Associations between subjective decline and
diagnostic conversion

Overall results

SP-ECog was
signiﬁcantly associated with conversion
from CU to MCI, and MCI to dementia (Table 3). In
both cases, SP-ECog was the strongest predictor of con-
version based on magnitude of Hazard Ratios. In con-
trast, Self-ECog was signiﬁcantly associated with CU to

MCI conversion, but not MCI to dementia conversion.
Removing SP-ECog from the model resulted in a signiﬁ-
cant decrease in the predictive value of the model predict-
ing CU to MCI conversion (LR = 27, P < 0.001) and of
to dementia conversion
the model predicting MCI
(LR = 108, P < 0.001). Removing Self-ECog, MMSE, and
APOE from the model, but retaining SP-ECog in the
model, resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the model pre-
dictive power for predicting CU to MCI conversion
(LR = LR = 14.8, P = 0.002), and MCI to dementia con-
version (LR = 239, P < 0.001).

Associations between subjective decline and
conversion in Ab+ participants

In Ab+ participants, Self-ECog but not SP-ECog was signif-
icantly associated with CU to MCI conversion (Table 3).
Removing SP-ECog from the model did not result in a sig-
niﬁcant decrease in the predictive value of the model
(LR = 3.0, P = 0.082). Removing Self-ECog, MMSE, and
APOE from the model, but retaining SP-ECog in the
model, resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the model pre-
dictive power (LR = 11.9, P = 0.008). In Ab+ participants,
SP-ECog was signiﬁcantly associated with MCI to dementia
conversion (Table 3). A model excluding SP-ECog was sig-
niﬁcantly less powerful at predicting conversion to demen-
tia than the full model (LR = 27, P < 0.001). A model
excluding Self-ECog, MMSE, and APOE; but including SP-
ECog, was not signiﬁcantly different than the full model
(LR = 3.9, P = 0.27).

Longitudinal ECog

Models including longitudinal change in Self-ECog and
SP-ECog instead of baseline measures yielded similar
results for all outcomes measured. The one exception was
for the analysis of CU to MCI conversion. In this case,
removing longitudinal Self-ECog, MMSE, and APOE
from the model, but retaining longitudinal SP-ECog in
the model, resulted in no signiﬁcant decrease in the
model predictive power (LR = 4.2, P = 0.24).

of our study were identiﬁcation of associations between
subjective decline and decline in NPT scores across multi-

approach. In CU, participants themselves more accurately
identiﬁed their current memory and verbal ﬂuency abili-
ties compared to their SPs (Fig. 1B), but SPs were better
than participants in identifying low baseline attention and
executive function (Trails A and B), as well as predicting
decline in overall cognition and memory (Fig. 1A). These
results are novel and surprising, and do not support our
a priori hypothesis that in CU participants, who are not
likely to lack insight about their own functioning level,

with baseline cognition and cognitive decline across mul-
tiple domains; as well as diagnostic conversion to MCI or
to dementia. The associations remain signiﬁcant in multi-
variable models accounting for self-reported functional
decline (Self-ECog), cognitive screening test (MMSE),
genetic risk (APOE), and participant demographics. These
results demonstrate that SP-reported functional decline
adds predictive power over and above more objective
measures. (2) Conversely, self-reported ECog is not signif-
icantly associated with cognitive decline across most
domains, or with conversion from MCI to Dementia.
Therefore, SP-reported decline is superior to self-report
for identifying cognitive decline and dementia risk. (3)
Associations between ECog and dementia risk-related out-
comes vary by Ab status. This includes domain-speciﬁc
associations between ECog and cognitive decline in Ab+
participants, as well as greater predictive value of Self-
ECog to identifying diagnostic conversion from CU to
MCI in the Ab+ subgroup. Taken together, these novel
results provide a rationale for greater utilization of func-
tional decline to identify those at risk for or with AD,
and for development of improved methods to efﬁciently
capture SP- and self-reported data.

Associations with NPTs

Previous studies found associations between subjective
decline and baseline cognition,13 or between cognitive com-
plaints and NPT decline in CU and MCI.20,39 Novel aspects

participant self-report and SP-report would be equally
predictive of cognitive status and decline. Our ﬁndings
contrast those of,40 which found that self-reported subjec-
tive cognitive concerns predict future cognitive decline in
the Preclinical Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite (PACC).
The differences may stem from differences in instruments
used (ECog vs. Subjective Cognitive Complaints; individ-
ual NPTs vs. PACC) and in the study population.

In MCI, SP-ECog scores were signiﬁcantly associated
with most baseline and longitudinal scores. Thus, in MCI
SP-report outperforms self-report in identifying cognitive
status across multiple cognitive domains, including mem-
ory. Surprisingly, there were no signiﬁcant associations
between participants’ self report of decline and actual
decline in any NPTs for CU or MCI. (Fig. 1A). Our ﬁnd-
ings argue for greater reliance on SPs to recognize early
changes in everyday functioning that map to future cog-
nitive decline. Such information can be used to identify
CU individuals at risk for cognitive decline for clinical tri-
als and in various healthcare settings.

To determine the extent to which subjective decline, mea-
sured by ECog, speciﬁcally identiﬁes cognitive decline associ-
ated with increased risk for AD, we measured the
associations between ECog and NPT scores in Ab+ partici-
pants. There were three major ﬁndings from these analyses.
First, associations between SP-ECog and cognitive decline in
Ab+ CU closely matched the associations found in the entire
MCI group. This can be explained by the fact that Ab+ CU
have worse prognoses in terms of cognitive decline, and
therefore more closely resemble MCI participants.

Second, in Ab+ participants, for some NPTs, partici-
pants who self-reported greater decline had signiﬁcantly
less objective decline in NPT scores over time. In MCI,
this inverse relationship between self-reported decline and
actual decline in MCI is likely due to loss of insight about
one’s own level of functioning. However, the inverse rela-
tionship between self-report decline and actual decline in
Ab+ CU is surprising, and its cause requires further
exploration. Ab+ CU older adults are unlikely to have
impairments affecting their insight about recent changes
in their functional abilities. Their failure to report changes
that reﬂect actual changes in cognition may therefore be
due to other factors, such as anxiety or denial about
recent changes in function.

Third,

in Ab+ MCI, signiﬁcant associations between
SP-reported ECog and decline in NPT scores were
restricted to ADAS13 and a few memory tests. This con-
trasts with ﬁndings in the overall MCI cohort, in which
SP-ECog is also signiﬁcantly associated with decline in
executive function (Trails) and lexical retrieval (Boston
Naming). This ﬁnding may reﬂect the fact that the Ab+
MCI groups are more amnestic than the overall MCI
cohort. This idea is described in more detail below.

A major goal of this work was to assess the predictive
power of SP-ECog in relation to other variables. We
found that in MCI, advanced age was signiﬁcantly associ-
ated with greater decline in multiple NPTs, and females
had signiﬁcantly greater decline in some NPTs (Table 2).
Conversely, MMSE, APOE, and education had limited
predictive power, as shown by the lack of signiﬁcant asso-
ciations between these variables and longitudinal change
in NPTs in our multivariable models. Therefore, in pre-
dicting future cognitive decline, subjective decline eclipses
the contribution of genetic risk and cognitive screening
instrument in identifying older adults at risk. These ﬁnd-
the use of SP-reported
ings, argue compellingly for
decline to identify older adults at risk for cognitive
decline, including CU individuals.

Associations with diagnostic conversion

Previous reports demonstrate that SP report of memory
problems could distinguish CU from dementia due to AD
and predict future diagnosis of AD dementia.41,42 Few
studies have explored the relationship between ECog and
diagnostic conversion.14 In addition to the use of the
ECog, the novelty of our multivariable approach was to
identify the relative predictive power of subjective decline
compared to other variables. We found that SP-ECog was
the strongest predictor of diagnostic conversion from CU
to MCI or from MCI to dementia, compared to other
variables. Furthermore,
removing SP-ECog from the
models resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the predictive
power of both models.

In order to determine the ability of SP-ECog and other
predictors to speciﬁcally identify risk of conversion to
MCI or dementia likely due to AD, we performed the
same analyses in only Ab+ participants. In the Ab+ sub-
group, only Self-ECog signiﬁcantly predicted conversion
to MCI, whereas, SP-ECog was signiﬁcantly associated
with conversion from MCI to dementia. Therefore, self
report of subjective decline has a unique ability to predict
conversion in Ab+ CU. No variables other than ECog
were signiﬁcantly associated with CU to MCI conversion.
The results argue for greater utilization of both self-re-
ported and SP-reported subjective decline to identify
older adults at risk for MCI likely due to AD.

What is the underlying cause of different results when
we consider only Ab+ individuals? A simple interpretation
is that, since Ab+ participants decline more than Ab- par-
the association between predictors and out-
ticipants,
in Ab+ participants. As described

is
above, this could explain why SP-ECog is more strongly
associated with cognitive decline in Ab+ CU. But why,
then, is SP-ECog more strongly associated with diagnostic
conversion to MCI in the overall cohort versus the Ab+

subgroup? SP-ECog may be detecting changes that lead to
decline in cognition and conversion to MCI that is not
due to AD, but is instead due to other causes. A related
idea is that the ability of study partners to detect func-
tional decline is somewhat cognitive domain speciﬁc.
Although all ADNI MCI participants meet criteria for
amnestic MCI, Ab- participants are likely to be less
amnestic than those who are Ab+. SPs may be better able
to predict conversion from CU to MCI in Ab- partici-
pants because SPs can detect decline in domains other
than memory, such as language, and attention. Some
recent evidence supports the idea of domain speciﬁcity in
subjective decline.43,44 Further studies exploring the rela-
tionship between SP-reported subjective decline across
different domains and AD related outcomes,
including
biomarkers other than Ab, are necessary to address these
issues.

Possibility for remote collection

These results are especially important
in the light of
recent evidence for feasibility and validity of remotely col-
lected ECog.26,27 Since remote assessments can be admin-
istered efﬁciently to a large number of individuals using
few resources, they could be used for longitudinal moni-
toring in clinical trials. Furthermore, use of SP-reported
decline provides the opportunity to identify decline in
older adults reluctant to seek care themselves, has low
inﬂuence from cultural or educational backgrounds, and
can be applied widely in the community without requir-
ing any formal clinical setting.41,45 A crucial next step is
to validate remote assessments against traditional in-clinic
assessments; such studies are ongoing using an online
remote assessments of participants and
platform for
SPs.27

Limitations

We limited our subjective measure to ECog. In future
studies, it will be important to include additional subjec-
tive measures, such as cognitive complaints, memory con-
cerns, and behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
These may confer additional predictive power compared
to subjective decline.46,47 Clinical diagnosis of CU and
MCI in ADNI relies on Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)
scores, which are derived in part from SP- and self report
of functional impairment. This could confound the asso-
ciation between ECog and diagnostic conversion. We did
not explore the ability of ECog to predict other important
biomarkers and risk factors, such as Tau and functional
connectivity, which have been found to be signiﬁcantly
associated with self-reported subjective cognitive decline,
concerns, and complaints.48,49 Finally,
lack of diversity

and the speciﬁc inclusion/exclusion criteria in ADNI
somewhat limit generalizability of our results.

Conclusions

SP-ECog signiﬁcantly predicts cognitive decline across
multiple domains, and diagnostic conversion to MCI or
independent
to dementia. SP-ECog confers additional,
predictive power over and above Self-ECog, cognitive
screening (MMSE), APOE, and demographics. Analyses
limited to Ab+ older adults conﬁrm the predictive power
of subjective decline in those at risk for AD, and suggest
some cognitive-domain speciﬁcity associated with subjec-
tive decline. These ﬁndings have important implications
for using self- and SP-reported measures to identify those
at risk for cognitive decline, MCI, dementia, and demen-
tia due to AD in clinical research and healthcare settings.
