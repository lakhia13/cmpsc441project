Abstract

Objectives: This exploratory analysis examined the putative antidepressant effect of Matricaria chamomilla
L. (chamomile) extract in subjects with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with or without comorbid de-
pression. It was hypothesized that chamomile extract would demonstrate similar anxiolytic activity in both
subgroups, but superior antidepressant activity in GAD subjects with comorbid depression.

Design: As part of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of chamomile extract for relapse
prevention of GAD, 179 subjects received initial therapy with open-label chamomile extract 1500 mg daily for
8 weeks. Linear mixed-effect models were used to identify clinically meaningful changes in anxiety and
depression symptoms between diagnostic subgroups.

Settings/Location: The study took place at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA.
Subjects: Subjects were ‡18 years old with a primary DSM IV-TR diagnosis of GAD. They were sub-
categorized into two diagnostic groups: GAD without comorbid depression (n = 100) and GAD with comorbid
depression (n = 79).

Interventions: Open-label chamomile extract 1500 mg was given daily for 8 weeks.
Outcome measures: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), Hamilton rating scale for anxiety, Beck anxiety
inventory, Hamilton rating scale for depression (HRSD), the six-item core HRSD (items 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 13),
and the Beck depression inventory (BDI).

Results: The authors observed similar anxiolytic effects over time in both diagnostic subgroups. However,
there was a greater reduction in HRSD core symptom scores ( p < 0.023), and a trend level reduction in HRSD
total scores ( p = 0.14) and in BPI total scores ( p = 0.060) in subjects with comorbid depression.

Conclusions: M. chamomilla L. may produce clinically meaningful antidepressant effects in addition to its
anxiolytic activity in subjects with GAD and comorbid depression. Future controlled trials in subjects with
primary major depressive disorder are needed to validate this preliminary observation.

Introduction

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) frequently oc-

curs with symptoms of comorbid depression.1–4 Al-
though conventional antidepressant drug therapies have
simpliﬁed the treatment of comorbid anxiety and depression,

a large segment of the population goes untreated5 or declines
conventional antidepressant therapy for ﬁnancial, cultural, or
personal reasons. Many of these individuals seek alternative
medicine remedies for their symptoms.6 The identiﬁcation of
inexpensive and effective alternative therapies for anxiety
and depression is, therefore, of public health relevance.7,8

Matricaria chamomilla L. (chamomile) has been used
since antiquity as a traditional botanical remedy for anxiety
symptoms.9 A recent
randomized double-blind placebo-
controlled trial of pharmaceutical grade chamomile oral ex-
in subjects with GAD10 demonstrated signiﬁcantly
tract
greater reduction in mean anxiety symptom outcome ratings
for chamomile versus placebo ( p = 0.047). Based upon these
clinical observations, and ﬁndings from in vitro and in vivo
animal studies,11–22 a post hoc exploratory analysis examining
the putative antidepressant effect of chamomile oral extract in
subjects with comorbid GAD and depression was performed.23
In that analysis, 57 subjects received either chamomile extract
or placebo therapy: 19 subjects had comorbid GAD and de-
pression, 16 had GAD and a history of depression, and 22 had
GAD and no current or history of depression. A signiﬁcantly
greater reduction in mean total depression rating scores
( p < 0.05) and in core depression symptom scores ( p < 0.05)
was observed for chamomile versus placebo in all subjects,
and a trend level decline in core depression symptom scores for
chamomile versus placebo in subjects with current comorbid
GAD and depression ( p = 0.062).23

Given the prior observation of a possible antidepressant
action for chamomile,23 in the current exploratory analysis it
was hypothesized that chamomile would produce a similar
anxiolytic effect in GAD subjects with and without co-
morbid depression, but a greater reduction in depression
symptoms in subjects with GAD and comorbid depression.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

Data for this exploratory analysis were derived from the
open-label phase of a randomized double-blind placebo-
controlled peer-reviewed trial of chamomile oral extract
therapy for relapse prevention of GAD (ClinicalTrials.gov
identiﬁer: NCT01072344). The full study protocol and pri-
mary study outcomes have been published previously.24–26
In brief, subjects were ‡18 years old with a primary DSM-IV-
TR diagnosis of GAD, ascertained using the structured clinical
interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID-I/P).27
Baseline GAD severity was at least moderate with a GAD-7
rating28,29 ‡10 and a clinical global impression severity
(CGI/S)30 score ‡4 (i.e., moderately ill). Exclusion criteria
were known sensitivity to chamomile, plants of the Aster-
aceae family, mugwort, or birch pollen; primary DSM-IV-
TR diagnosis of a mood disorder (comorbid depression
symptoms were not a study exclusion if they did not constitute
the primary study diagnosis); panic disorder, phobic disorder,
obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder,
acute stress disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder; psy-
chosis; dementia; substance abuse or dependence within the
preceding 3 months; unstable medical condition; pregnant or
breastfeeding; renal and/or hepatic insufﬁciency; malignancy;
or concurrent use of antidepressants, anxiolytics (e.g., benzo-
diazepines, buspirone, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors), mood
stabilizers, and/or other integrative therapies (e.g., hypericum,
valerian root, ginseng, and chamomile tea).

Procedures

The study design included an initial 8-week open-label
phase of chamomile extract therapy with response deﬁned as

a ‡50% reduction in baseline GAD-7 score plus a ﬁnal
CGI/S score of 1 (i.e., normal), 2 (i.e., borderline), or 3 (i.e.,
mild symptoms). Nonresponse was deﬁned as a <50% re-
duction in total GAD-7 score or a CGI/S score ‡4 (i.e.,
moderate) at study week 8. Responders at week 8 continued
open-label consolidation chamomile therapy for an addi-
tional 4 weeks. For this open-label phase of the study, the
primary protocol-designated continuous outcome measure
was change in GAD-7 scores. Subjects who continued to re-
spond to open-label chamomile therapy were then enrolled
into a randomized-double-blind comparison of chamomile
versus placebo for relapse prevention of GAD. For the current
exploratory analysis, the data from all subjects who received
open-label chamomile extract for up to 8 weeks were analyzed.
Subjects were recruited from media and print advertise-
ments approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of
the University of Pennsylvania and from subjects referred
from the family medicine outpatient clinic at Penn Medicine
in the University of Pennsylvania Health System. All study-
related procedures were performed at the Depression Re-
search Unit of the Perelman School of Medicine, University
of Pennsylvania. Subjects provided informed consent
in
accordance with the ethical standards of the University of
Pennsylvania’s IRB. The study was conducted using the
Principles of Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, with
oversight by the local ofﬁce of human research and by an
independent Data & Safety Monitoring Board.

Before the baseline study visit, all subjects underwent a
detailed evaluation that included a medical and psychiatric
history, physical examination, and laboratory tests (including
complete blood count, electrolytes, hepatic, renal and thyroid
panel, pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential,
urinalysis, and urine drug screen for drugs of abuse).

Treatment

Clinical management was conducted in a structured manner.31
Fixed-ﬂexible dosing with chamomile oral extract 500 mg cap-
sules totaling 1500 mg daily was administered. The total daily
dose was based upon prior efﬁcacy and tolerability observa-
tions.10 The ﬁxed-ﬂexible dosing strategy afforded subjects the
opportunity to reduce the daily dose of chamomile to a minimum
of 500 mg (if warranted). Study drug accountability and capsule
counts were ascertained at weeks 2, 4, and 8 of study visits.

Study drug

Each capsule contained 500 mg of pharmaceutical grade
dry extract of M. chamomilla L. ﬂowers (equivalent to 2.0 g
of German chamomile ﬂowers). This corresponded to 6 mg of
ﬂavonoids, with total apigenin-7-glycosides (calculated as
apigenin-7-glycoside; Api-7Glc). The extraction solvents
were ethanol 70%, v/v, and water (for the second extraction).
German chamomile dry extract SHC-1 (DER 4:1, batch no.
50,053 (Swedish Herbal Institute AB, Vallberga, Sweden)
was standardized to a content of 1.2% Api-7Glc and 0.2%–
0.6% tetra coumaroyl spermine . The content of Api-7Glc in
the herbal substance and herbal preparation was analyzed
according to the European Pharmacopoeia 8.8 monograph
04/2016:0404 and the United States Pharmacopeia-30.

Api-7Glc was present in the botanical product in both
free and esteriﬁed forms. For the measurement of total
apigenin-7-glucosides, the herb and extracts were separately

subjected to alkaline hydrolysis, in which various acetylated
derivatives of Api-7Glc were converted to Api-7Glc. The
hydrolysates were then subjected to high-performance liquid
chromatography using a Waters Empower system.

The content of the genuine Matricaria ﬂower extract
(DERnative–6.2:1) in the SHC-1 comprised 65% of the
product, whereas the other 35% of the product comprised
maltodextrin as a carrier. Samples of the herbal substance
and herbal preparations were retained at the manufacturer’s
quality control laboratory. A certiﬁcate of analysis of purity
and suitability for human use was provided to the study
investigators and was submitted to the United States Food
and Drug Administration for approval of a new drug ap-
plication (IND 107,206) on December 17, 2009.

Chamomile capsules were prepared and packaged by the
University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Service
under Good Manufacturing Practice Guidelines, in a high-
efﬁciency particulate air (HEPA)-ﬁltered ISO-8 production
facility. A dose of 500 mg of dry extract SHC-1 was ﬁlled
into a gelatin capsule shell without any additional ﬁller.

Outcome measures

Protocol-designated and post hoc outcome measures in-
cluded in this analysis were the 7-item generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD-7) rating,28,29 Hamilton rating scale for anxiety
(HRSA),32 Beck anxiety inventory (BAI),33 17-item Hamilton
rating scale for depression (HRSD),34 the six-item core HRSD
(comprising HRSD items #1 (depressed mood), #2 (guilt), #3
(suicide ideation), #7 (work and interest), #8 (retardation), and
#13 (somatic symptoms general)),23,35 and the Beck depression
inventory (BDI).36 GAD subjects underwent a post hoc cate-
gorization into two groups: (1) GAD without comorbid de-
pression and (2) GAD with comorbid depression.

Sample size justiﬁcation

The sample size for the open-label phase of the study by
the estimated sample size required to detect a chamomile
versus placebo difference during the relapse-prevention
phase of the trial was determined. A screen failure rate of
10% and a nonresponse rate of 40% in the open-label study
phase were estimated. Thus, a total of 180 subjects received
open-label chamomile extract (of which 179 subjects had at
least one repeat outcome measurements performed). This
sample size permitted us to test the primary (i.e., relapse
prevention) hypothesis with 80% power to detect a differ-
ence between treatment conditions at the 0.05 level. It was
noted that the current exploratory analysis was not speciﬁ-
cally powered to detect statistically signiﬁcant differences in
depression rating outcomes between GAD subgroups.

Statistical procedures

Statistical analysis followed intent-to-treat principals. The
objective of this exploratory analysis was a two-group
comparison of the mean change in outcomes (i.e., GAD-7,
HRSA, BAI, core HRSD, 17-item HRSD, and BDI ratings)
between GAD subjects without comorbid depression and
GAD subjects with comorbid depression taking chamomile
extract for 8 weeks.

A chi-square test was used to compare categorical baseline
variables and two-sample t-test
to compare continuous
baseline variables between the diagnostic subgroups. Differ-
ences in outcomes over time from baseline to week 8 were
examined using a linear mixed-effect model. The ﬁxed ef-
fects in the linear mixed-effect model for each outcome were
comorbid depression status, time, comorbid depression sta-
tus · time interaction, and baseline outcome. Subject-speciﬁc

random intercepts to account for the correlation between re-
peated measures of each outcome were used. Given the ex-
ploratory nature of the study, preplanned hypotheses, and the
fact that the study was not speciﬁcally powered to identify
statistically signiﬁcant differences between the diagnostic
groups, the authors chose not to apply Bonferroni corrections
for multiple outcome analyses.

Analyses were conducted using STATA (version 12.0;
STATA Corporation, College Station, TX) and SAS (ver-
sion 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were
two sided. The statistical signiﬁcance level was set at 0.05.

Results

Study enrollment occurred between March 2010 and June
2015, with 394 subjects evaluated and 179 subjects enrolled:
the mean (standard deviation) age was 45.7 (15.3) years and
119 (66%) were female. Demographic and clinical variables
of the subject sample are displayed in Table 1.

Subjects were subcategorized into two diagnostic groups:
(1) GAD without comorbid depression (n = 100) and (2)
GAD with comorbid depression (n = 79). At baseline, there
were no clinically meaningful differences between diag-
nostic subgroups for most sociodemographic characteristics.
However, the mean age of ﬁrst GAD onset was signiﬁcantly
older for GAD subjects with comorbid depression (mean
25.1 years) versus subjects without comorbid depression
(mean 18.6 years) ( p = 0.0045). In addition, subjects with
comorbid depression had a signiﬁcantly higher mean total

HRSA score ( p = 0.012), higher mean GAD-7 score
( p = 0.029), higher mean total HRSD score ( p < 0.001),
higher mean core HRSD scores ( p < 0.001), and higher
mean BDI score ( p < 0.001) (Table 1).

There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in change
over time in any of the anxiety symptom outcome measures
between diagnostic subgroups during 8 weeks of chamomile
therapy. In contrast, GAD subjects with comorbid depres-
sion demonstrated signiﬁcant reductions over time for the
core HRSD score versus GAD subjects without comorbid
depression ( p = 0.023) (Table 2). Similarly, GAD subjects
with comorbid depression demonstrated a greater trend level
reduction over time in total HRSD ( p = 0.14) and BDI
scores ( p = 0.060) (Table 2).

Discussion

In a prior study of the putative antidepressant effects of
chamomile extract in GAD subjects with or without co-
morbid depression, a greater, although trend level, reduction
of total HRSD scores was observed while taking chamomile
(vs. placebo) in GAD subjects with comorbid depression
( p = 0.062).23 These preliminary observations suggested that
chamomile extract may exert an antidepressant effect dis-
tinct from its anxiolytic activity. The authors, therefore,
undertook the current exploratory analysis to examine the
putative antidepressant effect of chamomile extract on a
new, and substantially larger, sample of GAD subjects with
or without comorbid depression. The authors hypothesized

that chamomile extract would demonstrate a similar anxio-
lytic effect over time for both GAD subgroups, but would
show a greater antidepressant effect over time in GAD
subjects with comorbid depression. Although the current
exploratory analysis was not speciﬁcally powered to detect
statistically signiﬁcant differences between diagnostic sub-
groups for changes over time in depressive symptom scores,
the authors did expect to ﬁnd clinically meaningful changes
between depressed versus nondepressed GAD subjects.

Although chamomile’s mode of antidepressant action in
humans is unknown, it may be independent of its anxiolytic
activity. For example, several constituents of dried chamo-
mile extract possess neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1r) antago-
nist activity.37 NK1r antagonists appear to block production
of substance P resulting in a potent anti-inﬂammatory and
putative antidepressant action in humans,38–40 and this
mechanism of action may contribute to chamomile’s anti-
depressant activity.

constituents may

affect
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity
that modulates GAD and depressive symptoms. For exam-
ple, lower cortisol awakening levels have been observed in
GAD subjects, as has lower HPA axis activity during
chronic stress with subsequent enhanced cortisol activation
in depression.41,42 In addition, other studies suggest that
chamomile may exert an antidepressant effect by modulat-
ing HPA axis activity.20,21 For example, Yamada et al.20
found that chamomile oil vapor reduced restriction stress-
induced increases in adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) levels in
ovariectomized rats. Moreover, plasma ACTH levels further
decreased when diazepam was administered with chamo-
mile oil vapor. In contrast, the ACTH decrease was blocked
when ﬂumazenil was given with chamomile oil vapor. In a
bovine behavioral study, Reis et al.21 examined the effects
of chamomile on ‘‘handling stress’’ in Nellore calves fed
dietary M. chamomilla CH12 (n = 30) or no chamomile
(n = 30) for 30 days. The calves were stressed on days 31,
38, 45, and 60. Cortisol levels were signiﬁcantly lower after
stress immobilization in chamomile-fed calves on day 45,
suggesting that chamomile may exert both an anxiolytic and
antidepressant effect through modulation of the HPA axis.
Other evidence suggests that chamomile’s ﬂavonoid con-
stituents may exert antidepressant activity through modula-
tion of central neurotransmitter activity.13–16,20 For example,
Lorenzo et al.11 found that apigenin increased noradrenalin
(NA) activity in an isolated rat atria model, and inhibited
monoamine oxidase activity in rat atria homogenates. Morita
et al.12 found that apigenin stimulated the uptake of L-[14C]-
tyrosine, a dopamine (DA) precursor, into cultured adrenal
chromafﬁn cells, whereas ﬂavone produced an increase in
[14C]-catecholamine production without
altering [14C]-
tyrosine turnover. Nakazawa et al.13 found an antidepressant-
like activity of apigenin on NA and DA turnover in the
amygdala and hypothalamus in mice exposed to the forced
swim test (FST), whereas Anjaneyulu et al.14 found that
quercetin reduced the immobility of mice during the FST in a
dose-dependent manner comparable with ﬂuoxetine and
imipramine. Yi et al.15 found that apigenin reduced immo-
bility during the FST in mice; reversed FST-induced reduc-
tion in sucrose intake in rats;
lowered stress-induced
alterations in serotonin (5-HT), DA, and their metabolites;
and reversed FST-induced increases in HPA axis activity.

Finally, several recent studies of chamomile therapy in
depressed humans and animals with depression-like symp-
toms have lent additional support to the possibility that
chamomile may produce antidepressant effects.43–45

Several caveats should be considered in the interpretation of
the current ﬁndings. For example, the study was not powered to
detect statistically signiﬁcant differences in any of the de-
pression outcome ratings between diagnostic subgroups.
Moreover, the post hoc categorization of subjects into separate
diagnostic subgroups necessarily produced smaller sample si-
zes and may have altered the authors’ ability to detect small to
moderate differences in HRSD and BDI ratings between
groups. Diagnostic subcategorization also produced some un-
balance in baseline clinical and demographic variable distri-
butions that could have inﬂuenced the current ﬁndings.
Furthermore, given the exploratory nature of the analysis, the
authors did not correct for multiple outcome comparisons.
Thus, it is possible that the statistically signiﬁcant and clinically
meaningful reductions in HRSD and BDI scores observed in
GAD subjects with comorbid depression represent type 1 er-
rors. Furthermore, given the a priori presence of higher de-
pression scores at baseline for the subgroup of GAD subjects
with comorbid depression, it is possible that the current ob-
servation of antidepressant activity could represent a placebo
effect. It is also possible that the apparent effects of chamomile
extract on depression symptoms were not due to antidepressant
action per se, but rather the result of chamomile’s primary
anxiolytic activity. In this regard, the antidepressant outcomes
may have been different if the primary disorder of the study was
major depressive disorder. Similarly, it is possible that the
antidepressant outcome may have been different if a greater
chamomile dose or treatment duration had been selected, or if a
different chamomile species or chamomile extract standardi-
zation had been employed.

Furthermore, the authors acknowledge that the absence of
an active or placebo control group and/or differences in
some baseline variables between diagnostic subgroups may
have limited their ability to evaluate the contribution of a
‘‘placebo effect’’ on outcome. Moreover, possible uncer-
tainty of the validity of the HRSD core symptom scale,
which was the only outcome measure demonstrating a sig-
niﬁcant difference between subgroups in this study, could
possibly raise questions about the putative antidepressant
action of chamomile. In this regard, however, the authors
note that the BDI measure in this study also showed a
meaningful, although trend-level, signiﬁcance of p < 0.06.

Finally, it is acknowledged that the current analyses were
exploratory and only suggest the possibility of an antide-
pressant activity for chamomile. Future prospective trials
will need to be conducted in subjects with primary major
depressive disorder to validate the presence of antidepres-
sant activity of chamomile.

Conclusions

In addition to its primary anxiolytic activity in subjects with
GAD, M. chamomilla L. oral extract may also demonstrate a
substantial reduction of depressive symptoms in subjects with
comorbid GAD plus depression. Thus, it is possible that
M. chamomilla L. may also possess primary antidepressant
activity. Future controlled clinical trials of subjects with pri-
mary depression are needed to validate this observation.
