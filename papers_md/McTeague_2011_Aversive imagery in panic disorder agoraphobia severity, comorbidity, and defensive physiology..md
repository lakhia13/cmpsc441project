comorbidity and defensive physiology

Abstract

Background—Panic is characterized as a disorder of interoceptive physiological hyperarousal,
secondary to persistent anticipation of panic attacks. The novel aim of the present research was to
investigate whether severity of agoraphobia within panic disorder covaries with the intensity of
physiological reactions to imagery of panic attacks and other aversive scenarios.

Methods—A community sample of principal panic disorder (n=112; 41 without agoraphobia, 71
with agoraphobia) and control (n=76) participants imagined threatening and neutral events while
acoustic startle probes were presented and the eye-blink response (orbicularis oculi) recorded.
Changes in heart rate, skin conductance level, and facial expressivity were also measured.

Results—Overall panic disorder patients exceeded controls in startle reflex and heart rate during
imagery of standard panic attack scenarios, concordant with more extreme ratings of aversion and
emotional arousal. Accounting for the presence of agoraphobia revealed that both panic disorder
with and without situational apprehension showed the pronounced heart rate increases during
standard panic attack imagery observed for the sample as a whole. In contrast, startle potentiation
to aversive imagery was more robust in those without versus with agoraphobia. Reflex diminution
was most dramatic in those with the most pervasive agoraphobia, coincident with the most
extreme levels of comorbid broad negative affectivity, disorder chronicity, and functional
impairment.

Conclusions—Principal panic disorder may represent initial, heightened interoceptive
fearfulness and concomitant defensive hyperactivity, which through progressive generalization of
anticipatory anxiety, ultimately transitions to a disorder of pervasive agoraphobic apprehension
and avoidance, broad dysphoria and compromised mobilization for defensive action.

Introduction

Page 2

Panic disorder is characterized by unexpected panic attacks and concern about their
recurrence and/or injurious consequences (1), further specified by the presence or absence of
agoraphobia—apprehension and/or avoidance of situations in which panic attacks are
presumed likely. Although findings are mixed (2), panic disorder with agoraphobia is
typically associated with more profound pathology (3), indexed in elevated apprehension
about panic recurrence (4) and consequences (5), generalized symptomatology (e.g., non-
specific anxiety) (6), comorbidity (7–9), socio-occupational impairment (9–10) and poorer
treatment outcome (11). Although reduced to a dichotomous distinction in the current
nosology (DSM-IV), agoraphobia severity was previously qualified (none, mild, moderate,
severe; DSM-III-R) (12) and contemporary investigations indicated a spectrum of increasing
distress, least in panic disorder without agoraphobia and most marked in patients with severe
situational avoidance (13). The current investigation of panic disorder examines whether the
presence/absence as well as finer gradations of agoraphobia reflect differences in defensive
reflex physiology during narrative imagery.

Script-driven emotional imagery is a valuable tool in studies of anxiety disorders, permitting
presentation of both standard and idiographic threat challenges, paralleling methods of
imaginal exposure therapy (14–15). Physiological arousal during aversive imagery parallels
anticipatory reactions to threatening events (16), similarly mobilizing the autonomic nervous
system (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance), communicating threat through facial musculature
(e.g., corrugator “frown” muscle), and prompting somatic reflexive action (e.g., startle
potentiation) (17–18). Animals confronting survival threat show similar reactions, mediated
by the brain’s defense circuit (centered on the amygdala) (19–20) and neuroimaging studies
suggest a comparable circuit (21–23) underlies human fear.

Whereas imagery has been a productive methodology for characterizing the physiology of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (24–25), a parallel database on panic disorder has yet
to accumulate. In one of the first studies reported (26), panic patients relative to controls
showed elevations in blood pressure during idiographic aversive imagery, whereas other
autonomic measures did not differ. In a subsequent study (27), sympathetic increases were
modest in nocturnal, compared to diurnal, panickers during both standard aversive and
neutral imagery, whereas facial expressivity and heart rate patterns were equivalent.
Notably, in both studies—consistent with the vast majority of psychophysiological
investigations (26–33)—patient groups were combined samples of panic disorder with and
without agoraphobia. Although this grouping could be a constraint of sample size or an
effort to accord with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (34–35),
pathologically significant differences in emotional reflex patterns could be obscured.

In a series of imagery investigations, Lang and colleagues (17,36–44) explored evoked
defensive arousal differences across anxiety disorders: specific and social phobia patients
demonstrated the greatest autonomic and startle responses. Paradoxically, patients with more
pervasive and diffuse anxiety symptomatology—generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), PTSD
secondary to repeated traumatization—showed less robust reflex potentiation (despite
reports of intense fear). Importantly, panic disorder with agoraphobia was located at the
latter extreme. Furthermore, reflex blunting was consistently more pronounced across and
within diagnoses, coincident with increased clinician-rated severity, poorer prognosis,
greater comorbidity (depression and anxiety), elevated questionnaire-based indices of
negative affectivity, and lengthier disorder chronicity, suggesting that defensive engagement
during imagery might be compromised by prolonged hyperarousal, apprehension, and
accompanying dysphoria (43–44).

In the current study, a similar distress-related reflex pattern was expected within panic
disorder. Similar to phobic disorders (36–43) panic patients without agoraphobia were
expected to endorse the least symptomatic distress and show the most robust physiological
reactivity (i.e., potentiated startle and enhanced autonomic and facial muscle action) during
aversive imagery of panic attacks. Patients without agoraphobia and controls were expected
to react similarly during threatening imagery for which defensive mobilization is normal and
adaptive (e.g., facing an attacking animal). In contrast, severe agoraphobia was expected to
show higher comorbidity, broader negative affectivity, longer disorder duration, and
concomitantly, attenuated mobilization for defensive action.

Diagnostic groups were established using the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for
DSM-IV (ADIS-IV; 45), a semi-structured interview for assessing current anxiety, mood,
substance use, and somatoform disorders and for screening psychosis and major physical
disease. For multiple Axis I disorders, diagnostic primacy was determined by clinician-rated
severity (ranging from 0, No features present, to 5, Diagnosis present; severe) reflecting
both distress and interference. Controls denied current or lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric
illness. Inter-rater reliability (via videotape) was calculated for 25% of patients, yielding
100% agreement for principal diagnosis among three masters- or doctoral-level clinicians.

The ADIS-IV enables assessment of agoraphobia extent by querying apprehension and
avoidance of 22 standard situations (0, No avoidance/apprehension, to 8, Very Severe
avoidance/apprehension), specifically due to fears of panic induction and consequent
difficulty escaping and/or securing assistance from others. In the current study, presence of
agoraphobia was defined as moderate to very severe apprehension and/or avoidance of at
least two types of situations (i.e., transportation, shopping or recreational facilities, crowds,
open spaces, being alone, enclosed spaces, work).1 Patients with agoraphobia were further
classified by a median split on the sum of their situational apprehension and avoidance
ratings from the ADIS-IV, yielding 34 with moderate and 37 patients with severe
agoraphobia.2

Procedure

The University of Florida Institutional Review Board (IRB-01) approved the study.
Participants provided informed consent, completed questionnaires and interview in the
morning; psychophysiological assessment and clinical debriefing followed in the afternoon.

Experimental Stimuli—Twenty-four narrative imagery texts were used (46). Analyses
focused on two idiographic, “personal” threat narratives representing each patient’s primary

1Similar to preceding studies (2–3), agoraphobia without a history of panic disorder was rarely diagnosed (N=1) in this sample and
hence precluded analysis.
2Although discussion continues concerning the diagnostic utility of agoraphobic avoidance versus distress (2–4), the 22 ratings of
situational apprehension and avoidance were very highly correlated in the current sample, r=0.92, p<.001, and did not warrant
separate analysis. Furthermore, convergent evidence that the defined groups reflected progressive increases in severity was observed
in the agoraphobia subscale scores of the Fear Survey Schedule (Table 2). Relative to the control sample: PD, z=1.18; PDA moderate,
z=3.54; PDA severe, z=4.54.

clinical fear (i.e., panic attacks); or for controls their “worst fear” experiences (Table S1 in
the Supplement). Standard scenes included: two panic attack (crowded checkout line,
driving alone), four survival threat (physical attack by animal/human), two neutral (watching
documentary, reading magazine) events. Filler scripts were low arousal or engaging pleasant
scenes to impede an overall unpleasant arousal context. Scripts were ~20 words designed to
quickly reveal affect and reflect active participation. A woman recorded the scenes using
minimal prosody for presentation over earphones (Telephonics TDH-49, Telephonics
Corporation, Huntington, New York).

Imagery Assessment—Seated in a quiet, dimly lit room, with electrodes placed,
participants were instructed to listen to the auditory scripts with eyes closed, vividly
imagining the events described, as if actively involved. Throughout the recording session,
soft tones cued participants to relax, breathe slowly, and silently repeat the word “one” to
stabilize between-trial physiological activity (47). Imagery scripts were interspersed every
36 seconds in the tone series, with content pseudorandomized so that no more than 2 stimuli
of the same hedonic valence (pleasant, neutral, unpleasant), or content category (e.g.,
survival threat) were presented consecutively. The script series was repeated in a
counterbalanced order.

Trials consisted of a 1-second baseline, a 6-second auditory script, and 12 seconds of
imagery. Startle probes (50-ms 95 dB(A) white noise, instantaneous rise-time) were
presented at 4–5.5 or 10–11.5 seconds post-script onset, or both, and on 25% of inter-trial
intervals, at 22–23.5 seconds post-imagery offset.

Following imagery assessment (approximately 45 minutes) participants rated each scene for
experienced pleasure and emotional arousal (48).

Experimental Control and Data Collection

A computer running VPM software (49) controlled stimulus presentation and data
acquisition. Bioamplifiers recorded electromyograph (EMG) potentials at left orbicularis
occuli and corrugator supercilii, skin conductance level (SCL) and electrocardiogram (EKG)
as reported previously (36).

Data Reduction and Analysis

Univariate ANOVAs and Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) tests for planned
comparisons determined group differences in demographic and questionnaire data.

Using VPM software EMG, SCL [ log[SCL+1]], and EKG r-r intervals [converted to beats-
per-minute] were reduced into half-second bins. Responses were determined by subtracting
amplitude during the 1 second prior to script presentation from averages during the 12-
second imagery period.

Startle blinks from orbicularis oculi EMG represented the magnitude difference between
onset and peak muscle potential (50), standardized within subject in relation to the mean and
standard deviation of inter-trial probe responses (36).

Using SPSS (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois), omnibus repeated measures ANOVAs were
conducted separately for each physiological measure, with diagnostic status as a between-
subjects factor and imagery content as a within-subjects factor. Consistent with the majority
of preceding physiological investigations of panic disorder (26–33), analyses were initially
performed with control versus patient (irrespective of agoraphobia status) as a between-
subjects factor. To consider diagnostic distinctions delineated in the DSM-IV and DSM-III-
R respectively, subsequent analyses considered presence or absence as well as severity of

agoraphobia. Startle and autonomic reactivity during imagery have been shown to strongly
covary with rated emotional arousal (43–44), thus contents were entered according to the
mean linear increase in arousal reported by the patients (i.e., neutral, panic attack, survival
threat, idiographic/personal threat). Significant overall group effects were followed up with
between-group tests by contents to specify which imagery scenarios evoked different
sensitivities in patients and controls, facilitating comparisons to preceding studies that
utilized different prompts (26–27,37–38). Within-group comparisons explicated interactions.
Analyses were repeated for presence/absence of agoraphobia (i.e., control, PD, PDA) and
subtypes (i.e., PD; PDA-moderate; PDA-severe). Wilks’ lambda addressed sphericity issues
(51).

Results

Panic Disorder and Control Groups

Affective Judgments—Across groups rated displeasure reliably increased from neutral,
to panic attack, survival threat and personal threat at the extreme, F(3,179)=336.95 p<.001
(Figure 1). Furthermore, controls rated personal and survival threat scenes as equally
aversive, all ns; whereas patients rated personal threat as more aversive than all other
contents, all ps<.001; Content × Diagnosis interaction, F(3,179)=14.06, p<.001; Diagnosis
F(1,181)=19.41, p<.001. Patients rated panic attack and personal threat scenes more
unpleasant than controls, ps<.001.

Controls rated personal threat scenes most emotionally arousing followed by survival threat,
panic attack and neutral scenes. Patients were similar except panic attack was as intense as
survival threat, Content F(3,180)=344.57, p<.001; Content × Diagnosis F(3,180)=10.80, p<.
001; Diagnosis F(1,182)=28.43, p<.001. For all aversive scenes, patients endorsed higher
arousal than controls, ps<.01.

Baseline Physiology—No group differences emerged for blink magnitude to intertrial
startle probes or for baseline SCL or corrugator activity, Fs=0.02–0.63. Consistent with
preceding studies (30,50–51) heart rate was higher for panic disorder patients (M=74.85,
SD=11.34) than controls (M=65.31, SD=9.95)3, Diagnosis F(1,182)=34.51, p<.001.

Startle Reflex Potentiation—Blink magnitude (Figure 2 top panel) was larger during all
unpleasant compared to neutral imagery, Content F(3,165)=14.66, p<.001 (all unpleasant
versus neutral comparisons, ps<.001), similarly across groups, Content × Diagnosis
F(6,328)=1.04, ns. Panic patients tended to exceed controls, Diagnosis F(1,167)=2.63, p=.
05†, attributable to greater patient reactivity, specifically during standard panic attack
imagery, F(1,167)=3.97, p<.05.

Autonomic and Facial Responses—Heart rate accelerated during panic attack,
survival and personal threat relative to neutral imagery, Content F(3,180)=14.76, p<.001,
individual ps<.001. Contents varied similarly between groups, Content × Diagnosis
F(3,180)=2.30, ns, Diagnosis, F(1,182)=0.85, ns, except controls showed a significant linear
increase from neutral, with personal threat most extreme, followed by survival threat;
conversely patients showed the second largest increase to imagery of panic attacks—an
acceleration that far surpassed responding during survival threat imagery (ps<.05), Content
× Diagnosis (Cubic Contrast), F(1,182)=5.68, p<.05. A posthoc univariate test revealed a
pattern similar to startle responses—patients’ heart rate accelerated more than controls,

3Similar to preceding studies (42–43), analyses for heart rate change were calculated on residuals secondary to removing the trial-
specific baseline (1-second average prior to script onset) effects via linear regression.

specifically during standard panic attack imagery, F(1,182)=5.64, p<.05. Whereas
acceleration patterns for controls closely paralleled rated arousal, patients showed the
strongest increases to scenarios depicting uncontrollable panic attacks, foremost to
idiographic narratives (Figure 2 bottom panel).

In contrast to the heart rate sensitivities to clinically-relevant imagery in panic disorder, SCL
changes did not differ between groups, Content F(3,180)=21.74, p<.001, Content ×
Diagnosis F(3,180)=1.15, ns; Diagnosis F(1,182)=0.42, ns. Overall, panic attack, survival
and personal threat increased SCL relative to neutral imagery, Fs=7.80–67.10, ps<.01.
Facial expressivity was also similar between groups. Unpleasant imagery augmented
corrugator tension relative to neutral imagining, ps<.001, Content F(3,182)=11.57, p<.001,
Content × Diagnosis F(3,182)=0.61, ns; Diagnosis, F(1,184)=2.82, ns. For both SCL and
corrugator, the largest increases were evident during personal threat followed by survival
threat, panic attack, and a relative reduction below baseline during neutral imagery.

Panic Disorder with and without Agoraphobia: Defensive Reactivity

Affective Judgments—As listed in Table 1, PD and PDA showed similar patterns in
rated displeasure, with a few exceptions, Content F(3,178)=322.61, p<.001; Content ×
Diagnosis interaction, F(6,356)=7.37, p<.001; Diagnosis, F(2,180)=10.27, p<.001. Both
patient groups rated panic attack and personal threat scenes more unpleasant than controls,
ps<.01; PDA endorsed more displeasure than PD specifically to standard panic attack
narratives, p<.05†.

Ratings for arousal mirrored those for displeasure, Content F(3,179)=328.57, p<.001;
Content × Diagnosis F(6,358)=5.89, p<.001; Diagnosis F(2,181)=17.78, p<.001. Both PD
and PDA endorsed more intense arousal than controls for panic attack and personal threat
scenes, ps<.01, with PDA exceeding PD, again, specifically for panic attack narratives.

Baseline Physiology—Both PD and PDA exceeded controls in heart rate (Table S2 in
the Supplement).

Startle Reflex Potentiation—Affective modulation varied between groups (Figure 3),
Content × Diagnosis F(6,328)=2.34, p<.05; Content × Diagnosis Linear Trend
F(2,166)=3.32, p<.05; Content F(3,164)=18.12, p<.001; Diagnosis, F(2,166)=2.04, ns.
Whereas control and PD groups showed similar reflex patterns with the highest magnitudes
for survival and personal threat imagery, PDA showed a somewhat diminished overall
response with less clear differentiation among contents. To compare with preceding studies
(36), startle response differences between neutral and unpleasant imagery (i.e., fear
potentiation) were analyzed and suggested overall defensive hyper-responsivity in the PD
relative to PDA group, p<.05, Diagnosis, F(2,166)=3.35, p<.05.

Autonomic and Facial Responses—Heart rate change varied similarly between the
three groups, Content F(3,179)=17.24, p<.001; Content × Diagnosis F(6,358)=1.45, ns,
Diagnosis, F(2,181)=0.42, ns, except that for both PD and PDA, the second largest response
was elicited during panic attack imagery—larger even than to survival threat imagery (ps<.
05), Content × Diagnosis (Cubic Contrast), F(1,181)=12.52, p<.05 (Table 1).

Parallel to the two group analyses, SCL, Content F(3,179)=21.85, p<.001, Content ×
Diagnosis F(6,358)=0.97, ns; Diagnosis F(2,181)=1.19, ns, and corrugator changes, Content
F(3,181)=9.08, p<.001, Content × Diagnosis F(6,362)=1.28, ns; Diagnosis, F(2,183)=1.41,
ns, suggested consonant, reliable sympathetic and facial motor reactivity across groups.

Agoraphobia Severity & Defensive Reactivity

Accounting for agoraphobia severity (i.e., PD; PDA-moderate; PDA-severe) revealed a
more pronounced profile of group differences in startle reactivity (Figure 4); Content ×
Diagnosis Linear Trend F(3,98)=3.38, p<.05. Patient subgroups demonstrated reliable linear
contrasts across contents, Fs=5.06–11.11, ps<.05, except for PDA-severe F(1,30)=0.46, ns.
Startle response differences between neutral and unpleasant imagery (i.e., fear potentiation)
further indicated that the obtunded reactivity observed for PDA overall, in fact, was
attributable to patients with the most pervasive agoraphobia, Diagnosis, F(2,98)=3.51,
p<0.05, who showed reliably less startle potentiation than PD, p<.05. PDA-moderate
response was intermediate.

For affective judgments, SCL, heart rate, and facial action, overall response magnitude and
content modulation showed little variation as a function of agoraphobia severity.
Furthermore, baseline physiology was commensurate across patients.

Agoraphobia Severity & Comorbid Negative Affectivity

A consistent pattern of elevated broad negative affectivity and functional impairment was
observed in the PDA-severe compared to PD (Table 2). Questionnaire measures revealed
that, in addition to agoraphobia severity (FSS Agoraphobia), non-specific trait anxiety
(STAI), cognitive/somatic symptoms of depression (BDI) as well as anhedonia (MASQ
Anhedonia), and functional interference (IIRS)4 reliably increased from controls, to PD,
PDA-moderate and PDA-severe at the extreme.5 PDA-severe also surpassed PD in total
number of Axis I disorders and frequency of comorbid anxiety, but not mood disorders. To
further specify the pattern of comorbidity across the panic spectrum (62), subgroups were
compared in terms of presence or absence of single episode versus recurrent major
depression, which reflected greater prevalence of only the latter in PDA-severe. Next,
comorbid anxiety disorders were defined as predominantly circumscribed fear (i.e., specific
phobia, performance phobia) versus broad distress/anxious-misery (i.e., GAD, PTSD)
drawing on the findings of epidemiological (63–68) as well as psychophysiological (42–44)
studies. Similar to the presence of more intractable depression, the frequency of distress
disorders (but not circumscribed fear disorders) was greatest in PDA-severe. This overall
pattern of broad dysphoria in the severe agoraphobia group (indexed both dimensionally and
categorically) was consistent with clinician-conferred ratings of poorer treatment prognosis.

In terms of panic-related symptoms that might contribute to the pattern of broad negative
affectivity and vice versa, reports of dispositional interoceptive sensitivity (i.e., ASI, MASQ
Anxious Arousal) suggested equivalently heightened awareness of physiological cues
irrespective of agoraphobia. Patients also reported commensurate frequency in the last
month of full-blown panic attacks and prevalence of nocturnal panic attacks but recalled
more severe physiological and cognitive symptoms amidst a prototypical panic attack,
consistent with more extreme clinician-conferred ratings of panic disorder severity.

PDA-severe patients recalled disorder-level dysfunction that endured more than twice as
long as PD patients, with the PDA-moderate group again intermediate. The majority of PDA
patients (76%) recalled near simultaneous onset of panic disorder and agoraphobia (within 1

4Similar to other studies that endeavored to utilize the IIRS for assessing functional interference in lifestyle domains associated with
mental as opposed to physical health conditions (60–61), the IIRS was worded: “How much do your mental health problems (e.g.,
anxiety, depression) and/or their treatment interfere with your?…”
5For ease of comparison with the extant literature, the BDI and STAI scores were presented in conjunction with the MASQ Anxious
Arousal and Anhedonia subscales. The other 3 MASQ subscales (Mixed Anxiety/Depression Symptoms, General Anxiety, General
Depression) showed the same pattern across groups as the BDI and STAI and, not surprisingly, all five measures were highly
intercorrelated, rs=0.73–0.89, ps<.001.

year), whereas the remainder developed situational apprehension and avoidance within three
years (M=2.47, SD=1.84)6. Consistent with protracted functional interference (13), the
PDA-severe group reported the lowest educational attainment (Table 2).7

Self-reported ability to generate vivid mental imagery was equivalent across participants.
Furthermore, medication and substance use patterns exerted no reliable influence on
physiological patterns.8

Discussion

Consistent with the primacy of panic-related fears in their diagnostic profile, the total cohort
of panic disorder patients showed hyperarousal during imagery of panic attacks.
Specifically, patients demonstrated greater heart rate acceleration and startle potentiation
than controls during imagery of standard panic attack scenarios, concordant with more
extreme ratings of aversion and emotional arousal. Both patient and control groups rated
their personal, “worst” threatening scenes most arousing and evinced their largest
physiological increases during imagining. Notably, patients and controls showed similar
magnitude reflex responses during standard survival and idiographic threat imagery,
suggesting that the exaggerated reactivity to standard panic contents likely does not reflect
broader sensitization of fear circuitry, consistent with limited functional neuroimaging data
on this syndrome (74–75). Furthermore, patients and controls showed equivalent affective
modulation of facial expressivity and sympathetic activation.

Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia showed similarly palpable heart rate increases
during panic attack imagery. In fact, regardless of agoraphobia severity (i.e., none,
moderate, severe), panic patients showed exaggerated heart rate and subjective distress
during standard panic imagery, coupled with normative sympathetic and facial motor
activation across contents. Conversely, startle potentiation during aversive imagery was
generally more pronounced in PD than PDA—a pattern even more dramatic when PD was
compared to the severe agoraphobia subgroup (the moderate group was intermediate).
Seemingly paradoxically, the panic disorder group with severe agoraphobia failed to show
reflex responses greater than those to neutral during aversive imagery of any content.
Essentially, the most distressed patients were characterized by physiological system
discordance—simultaneous heightened, normative, and even dampened responses in
different domains—suggesting not only magnitude changes but also disruption of output
coordination in extreme manifestations of apprehension and avoidance.

Concomitant with blunted defensive startle reflexes, panic patients with severe agoraphobia
also endorsed the most intense prototypical panic attacks and received the highest clinician

6Consistent with preceding studies (69) none of the PDA patients recalled agoraphobia symptoms that preceded the development of
recurrent panic attacks.
7The PD group was younger than the PDA-moderate group, whereas the groups with the most pronounced differences in
physiological and symptom profiles—PD and PDA-severe—did not differ in age.
8Seventy-seven of the 112 patients indicated current use of medication for alleviating mental health symptoms. Most commonly, these
medications were selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; PD 42.5%; PDA-moderate 44.1%; PDA-severe 32.4%, X2 (2) =
1.23, ns) and/or benzodiazepines (PD 50.05%; PDA-moderate 56.3%; PDA-severe 48.6%, X2 (2) = 0.44, ns), utilized equally across
patient subgroups. The effects of these and less frequently endorsed compounds (e.g., beta blockers, 2.7%, tricyclics 1.9%,
norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors 1%) were assessed by comparing resting and imagery reactivity among the medicated
and non-medicated patients. Considering either general psychotropic usage or more specific classes of drugs, no reliable effects
emerged, consistent with prior psychophysiological studies of anxiety and depression (70–72). Reported usage of both prescription
and over-the-counter medications for promoting physical health, as well as recreational substance use were also collected but low
frequencies of endorsement precluded statistical analysis. As previously demonstrated (73), panic disorder patients were more likely
than controls (6.6%) to be current smokers, but no differences were revealed between patient subtypes (PD 23.1%; PDA-moderate
15.6%; PDA-severe 24.3%; X2 (2) = 0.89, ns). Further, no physiological effects were observed comparing resting and imagery
reactivity of smokers and non-smokers.

ratings of disorder severity and poor treatment prognosis. Importantly, group differences
were most robust for disorder non-specific features—that is, functional interference and
broad negative affectivity (i.e., trait anxiety, cognitive and somatic depressive symptoms,
anhedonia). Notably, negative affectivity has been implicated in the vulnerability and
perpetuation of pathological panic and agoraphobia (76). In fact, relative to non-clinical
community samples (54–56), the severe agoraphobia patients endorsed symptom levels on
the BDI and STAI beyond the 99th percentile. Axis I comorbidity mirrored dimensional
measures; however, analyses refined by disorder focus revealed that severe agoraphobia
patients exceeded the other groups not in circumscribed fearfulness or transient, single
episode major depression, but rather in intractable and chronic broad anxious distress and
major depression. Complementing this profile of diffuse, protracted dysfunction, panic
disorder with severe agoraphobia recalled a history of distress more than twice as long as the
PD group.

Interestingly, whereas non-specific distress and interference reliably increased with
agoraphobia severity, trait indices putatively specific to panic did not. Measures of
interoceptive hypersensitivity were similarly elevated across patient groups, corresponding
to their consistent heart rate acceleration during clinically-relevant imagery. In contrast,
differences in startle potentiation clearly discriminated between patients with focused
distress and those with high comorbidity and long disorder duration. These data recall
Melzig et al. (28) who observed that although heart rate patterns were similar, non-depressed
panic patients showed robust startle potentiation during threat of shock whereas panic
patients with comorbid depression failed to do so. Similar response system discordance was
observed by McTeague et al. (43) in depressed, generalized social phobia patients during
aversive imagery. Given that the startle effectors are somatic, reduced potentiation may
reflect psychomotor retardation and behavioral inhibition associated with comorbid negative
affectivity, while augmented autonomic outputs from the defense system persist.

In the current sample, diminished startle reactivity was only evident in patients who endured
the longest-standing disorder and the highest comorbid negative affectivity, whereas less
chronic and broadly symptomatic patients demonstrated robust fear potentiation. Following
contemporary learning theories of panic disorder (32,76), propensity for interoceptive and
exteroceptive fear conditioning may initially result in heightened, overgeneralization of
defensive responding. Grillon and colleagues have demonstrated that panic disorder in the
absence of significant comorbid broad distress is characterized by fear-conditioned
overgeneralization indexed by both subjective report and startle potentiation (29–32).
Notably, in these samples the comorbidity rates and symptom measures (e.g., mean BDI
range 6.9–11.3) were markedly lower than the comorbidly depressed panic patients in the
Melzig et al. (28) sample and even the no agoraphobia group in the current study, suggesting
that these hyper-reactive samples are predominantly a purer panic disorder.

Longitudinal examination is warranted to rule out the possibility that these are stable, time-
invariant defensive profiles throughout the trajectory of panic disorder. However, the current
findings encourage the speculation that in some patients focused panic disorder may evolve,
as fear becomes progressively generalized and resistant to extinction (34), to agoraphobia
and finally chronic stress and a comorbid constellation of negative affectivity, in which
defensive action (startle) may be impaired. Animal research varying stressor duration (77–
81) has provided insights that chronic anxiety and depression may relate to such somatic
hyporeactivity. For example, rats exposed to brief and/or less threatening stress demonstrate
hypervigilance and hyperarousal, whereas rats exposed to longer duration stress develop
more generalized anxiety and depressive-like symptoms, including passivity and reduced
movement and communication behaviors (79–81).

Epidemiological phenotypic and genotypic studies of anxiety and mood disorder
comorbidity (63–68) have emphasized a single, core internalizing dimension comprised of
two classes of disorders, fear and anxious-misery/distress. While in some investigations (63–
65) panic disorder as well as agoraphobia appear most akin to the circumscribed fearfulness
of specific phobias, in others (66–68) these disorders resemble the diffuse apprehension of
GAD, PTSD and depression. Importantly in these epidemiological studies, the finer
distinction of panic disorder with and without agoraphobia is often not considered. The
current data, based on structured interview by clinicians, suggest that while chronic panic
with agoraphobia may be more similar to distress disorders, the absence of agoraphobia may
reflect a shorter duration, more focal fearfulness.

Finally, in the current research strong defensive startle reactivity characterized principal
panic disorder, but was progressively diminished with agoraphobia, overall morbidity, and
disorder duration. This pattern was previously observed in imagery investigations of social
phobia (43) and PTSD (44), highlighting a fundamental dimension of anxiety spectrum
pathology. Although these samples were phenotypically dissimilar in foremost clinical
complaint (i.e., interpersonal apprehension, trauma-cue sensitivity, interoceptive
hyperawareness) and associated principal disorder, symptom profiles suggesting more
circumscribed fear showed startle potentiation specific to fear-relevant imagery, whereas at
profound levels of broad negative affectivity and comorbidity, startle responses diminished
to all aversive imagery contents. Taken together, startle potentiation during fear imagery is a
meaningful endophentotype—a biomarker of internalizing symptomatology (82–83).

The psychophysiological and phenotypic profiles obtained here suggest that principal panic
proneness may, at one extreme, prompt enhanced defensive startle reactivity in the absence
of significant agoraphobia. However, once one has developed broad conditioned avoidance
secondary to anxious anticipation of panic, the consequent stress of chronic hyperarousal
and accompanying dysphoria may function over time to attenuate or even impair active
defensive responding. As found in our previous studies of social phobia and PTSD, when an
anxiety disorder transitions to a state of prolonged stress and broad comorbid negative
affectivity, its biomarker is blunted fear-startle potentiation—implicating a compromised
underlying fear-defense brain circuitry.
