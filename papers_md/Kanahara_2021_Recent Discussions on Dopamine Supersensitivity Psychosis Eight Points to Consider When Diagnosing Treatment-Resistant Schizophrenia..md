Abstract: Dopamine supersensitivity psychosis is a clinical concept characterized by an unstable
psychotic state and tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia patients at the chronic stage. This state is
thought to be induced by compensatory upregulation of dopamine D2 receptors, which is provoked
by long-term and/or high-dose medications. Recent clinical data suggest that patients who respond-
ed well to medication but later exhibit dopamine supersensitivity develop tolerance to antipsy-
chotics’  effects  and  eventually  transit  to  treatment-resistant  schizophrenia,  indicating  that  do-
pamine  supersensitivity  could  be  an  etiology  contributing  to  treatment-resistant  schizophrenia.
However, clinicians and researchers consider dopamine supersensitivity psychosis a minor pheno-
menon during the clinical course and do not make much of it. This opinion is often based on numer-
ous clinical data indicating that dopamine supersensitivity psychosis is a relatively rare event. This
review examines the data dealing with dopamine supersensitivity with the five themes of frequen-
cy, severity, withdrawal studies, switching to aripiprazole, and tardive dyskinesia. These effects of
these themes on discussions of the clinical meaning of dopamine supersensitivity psychosis are
then reviewed. The present review will help clinicians speculate about the background of severe
psychopathology in a given patient; to make diagnoses of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and do-
pamine supersensitivity psychosis; and plan antipsychotic medication regimens with the goal of
achieving better long-term prognosis.

Keywords: Antipsychotic, dopamine, dopamine partial agonist, tardive dyskinesia, receptor, relapse, withdrawal.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Antipsychotic Medication and Treatment-Resistant
Schizophrenia

The  diagnosis  of  Treatment-Resistant  Schizophrenia
(TRS) is usually made when the affected individual’s posi-
tive symptoms do not respond sufficiently to standard phar-
macotherapy  with  at  least  two  classes  of  antipsychotic
agents [1, 2]. Several diagnosis criteria of TRS have been
proposed, but all of these criteria commonly focus particular-
ly on positive symptoms; symptoms domains other than posi-
tive symptoms are sometimes more severe in patients with
TRS compared to patients with non-TRS [3, 4]. The etiology
of TRS has not been fully understood, but it is considered
that multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to
the development of TRS. These relevant factors are general-
ly quite complex in a given subject, and no specific clinical
factors other than positive symptoms have been identified to

explain well the complete clinical picture of refractory pa-
tients [5].

Antipsychotics could be a factor relating to the refractori-
ness of schizophrenia. This topic has been discussed since
an earlier era of antipsychotics [6]. To date, several meta-a-
nalyses  of  volumetric  studies  using  Magnetic  Resonance
Imaging (MRI) indicated that antipsychotics’ impacts on pa-
tients’ brain volume, but the effects are subtle and limited to
certain  parts  of  the  brain  [7,  8].  However,  this  evidence
might not indicate that the effects of antipsychotics on the
brain are only slight; rather, they may only reflect the diffi-
culty in reaching a firm conclusion on this issue. It is a fact
that patients with schizophrenia show more rapid progres-
sion of brain volume reduction relative to subjects without
psychiatric disorders, but it is difficult to separate the effect
of antipsychotic(s) and the effects of aging and disease pro-
gression on brain volume [9]. The issue of whether antipsy-
chotics  have  negative  impacts  on  the  brain  structure  and
function of patients with schizophrenia has not reached a de-
cisive conclusion.

To date, the class(es) and dosage thresholds of antipsy-
chotics  leading  to  poor  long-term  clinical  courses  in  schi-
zophrenia have not been established, although atypical an-

tipsychotics might be more advantageous compared to typi-
cal antipsychotics in terms of some symptom domains such
as negative symptoms and cognitive impairments, and less
adverse events such as extrapyramidal symptoms [10-12].

1.2. Concept of Dopamine Supersensitivity Psychosis

Dopamine Supersensitivity Psychosis (DSP) is the cen-
tral issue of this topic, i.e., the question of whether an an-
tipsychotic  itself  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  long-term
prognoses of patients with schizophrenia. DSP is a clinical
concept  characterized  by  an  unstable  psychotic  state  ob-
served in patients exposed to long-term and high-dose an-
tipsychotic  agents.  DSP  was  first  proposed  by  Chouinard
and  his  colleagues  [13,  14]  and  has  sometimes  been  ad-
dressed from an iatrogenic aspect [15]. The research diagnos-
tic criteria proposed by Chouinard [16] defined this state as
a rapid exacerbation of psychosis following the tapering-off,
withdrawal, or switching of one or more antipsychotics (i.e.,
rebound  psychosis:  an  exacerbated  episode  of  psychotic
symptoms occurring within 6 weeks for an oral antipsychot-
ic (or within 3 months for a long-acting injectable) follow-
ing  tapering-off,  discontinuation  or  switching  of  antipsy-
chotic) and a gradual transition to a state of tolerance to the
effects of antipsychotic(s) (i.e., a clinically meaningful re-
sponse to antipsychotic medication before, but afterward lit-
tle  response  regardless  of  the  same  dosage  or  even  higher
dosage). Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a representative neuro-
logical sign of the Dopamine Supersensitivity (DS) of Do-
pamine D2 Receptors (DRD2s) in the striatal region and is
often classified as part of the DSP state. Chouinard initially
named this ‘neuroleptic-induced supersensitivity psychosis’
[13, 14]. Afterwards, numerous studies, most of them in ani-
mals, demonstrated that compensatory upregulation and the
supersensitivity of DRD2s that developed due to a blockade
by antipsychotic(s) played a primary role in the above-de-
scribed phenomena [17-23], and based on these accumulated
findings, they Iyo et al. renamed this concept ‘DSP’ [24].

Since the publication by Chouinard and Jones [14], sever-
al researchers proposed the concept of DSP [16, 25-28], and
only two teams defined the research diagnosis criteria [16,
26,  27].  Although  these  criteria  and  concept  of  DSP  were
not  completely  identical,  they  commonly  considered  that
DSP  appeared  in  schizophrenia  patients  under  long-term
treatment with antipsychotics, and that rebound psychosis,
developed  tolerance  to  antipsychotics’  effects  and  TD  are
the core elements of DSP. To date, however, detailed points
(e.g., the numbers of symptoms and the contents of previous
medications-dose and duration of previous medication trial-
which  are  required  to  meet  the  criteria)  have  not  been
defined.

Although  direct  evidence  showing  the  upregulation  of
DRD2s following the use of antipsychotics has been report-
ed in few studies of human subjects [29], numerous animal
model studies demonstrated this phenomenon [17-23]. The
upregulation of DRD2s could be promoted by a higher dose
of and longer-term exposure to an antipsychotic (Again, the
high-dose and long-term which can cause a DS state have

not  yet  been  strictly  defined  in  a  clinical  study.  However,
there has been some evidence that chlorpromazine-equiva-
lent [CP-eq.] 600 mg or greater for dose and at least several
years for treatment duration are sufficient to provoke DS or
DSP. Please see section 2. The receptor profile of each an-
tipsychotic with tight binding with DRD2s could also influ-
ence the development of their upregulation, although agents
with  a  relatively  loose  binding  profile  such  as  olanzapine
can also result in DRD2 upregulation [20]. In addition, the
withdrawal  of  an  administered  antipsychotic  leads  to  be-
havioral supersensitivity (which has been observed after ad-
ministration of psychostimulant drugs such as methamphe-
tamine and quinpirole), and this abnormality is further pro-
moted at roughly a week after the withdrawal of the antipsy-
chotic, which is similar to the rebound psychosis that is of-
ten observed in patients with schizophrenia [20]. In animal
studies, this phenomenon was observed in the case of contin-
uous administration of an antipsychotic agent (i.e., without
withdrawal) [20, 30-32].

1.3. One of Recent Articles on Dopamine Supersensitivi-
ty Psychosis

However,  there  are  recent  reviews  on  TRS  discussing
that DSP is not likely to be important as the etiology of the
disease [33, 34]. Even articles discussing the merit-demerit
balance of the long-term use of antipsychotics note that DSP
has been one of the leading problems with a potential nega-
tive impact on the clinical course of patients with schizophre-
nia, but the articles’ authors raised some cautions regarding
DSP [35, 36]. These four review articles dealt with the DSP
theory,  but  they  concluded  that  the  DSP  theory  was  not
based on reliable evidence. This point of view seemed to be
derived mainly from two ideas: (1) the accumulation of clini-
cal  findings  suggesting  that  DSP  is  a  minor  (not  major)
problem in schizophrenia patients, and (2) the lack of direct
evidence showing the increase in DRD2s in the brains of pa-
tients with schizophrenia. These are major and clear limita-
tions  of  applying  the  DSP  theory  to  all  TRS  patients,  but
there are some misunderstandings concerning DSP.

DSP presents with a wide variety of symptomatic forms
in schizophrenia patients, but relatively simple diagnostic cri-
teria converge for the definition of DSP. Importantly, DSP
may be disregarded by clinicians when its presenting symp-
toms are subtle, and it can be confusing to classify a patien-
t’s symptoms as DSP (which is induced by medication) or as
the disease itself when the symptoms are severe and unsta-
ble. Moreover, DSP often presents with a latent state; this
state is called ‘covert DSP’ [14, 26], but it might be more ap-
propriate to call it a latent (or covert) DS state instead of a
form of psychosis. We suspect that clinical studies trying to
capture DSP phenomena need study design that fully cap-
tures multiple forms of DSP in the broader clinical situation.

Abundant  findings  on  the  upregulation  of  DRD2s  and
the accompanying behavioral abnormalities in animal model
studies may imply that more patients who are treated with
an antipsychotic developed DS than clinicians have thought,
even though these patients did not show a prominent episode

of DSP in their past treatment course. However, most of the
discussions about TRS and most of the guidelines regarding
treatment for schizophrenia have disregarded or not serious-
ly regarded DSP and similar relevant phenomena from the
perspective of etiology, symptomatology, or psychopharma-
cology. We suspect that this trend of viewing DSP as a mi-
nor phenomenon in clinical practice was based on the con-
cept of DSP that has prevailed with some confusion among
clinicians and researchers: that is, the view that DSP is a mi-
nor subtype among schizophrenia patients and/or TRS pa-
tients, or that DSP is an unestablished concept since there ha
is no evidence of DSP in the brains of patients.

The present review will discuss several issues related to
DSP that may help clear up the confusion. Molecular-level
changes  and  abnormalities  in  the  brain  which  might  be
caused by antipsychotic treatment, including the question of
whether DRD2s truly are increased in the brains of patients
with  schizophrenia  under  treatment  with  antipsychotic(s),
are not discussed herein. This is because gaining an unders-
tanding of DSP theory is useful when treating schizophrenia
patients without DSP as well as patients with DSP [37-41].
A more concise understanding of the phenomena underlying
DSP is clearly important, and unknown mechanisms other
than the upregulation of DRD2s may be involved in these
phenomena.  These  other  mechanisms  might  be  related  to
presynaptic dopamine dysregulation, and/or to the dysregula-
tion  of  a  second-messenger  signal  cascade  following  do-
pamine-DRD2 binding in post-synaptic neurons and that of
other neurotransmitters such as 5-HT, glutamine, and GA-
BA [42-44].

However, the findings from the latest basic neuroscience
research in the relevant areas are still far away from being
applied in clinical practice. We propose that there is signifi-
cant merit to the DSP theory because it encourages a recon-
sideration  of  the  theoretical  background  of  patients’  unre-
sponsiveness  to  antipsychotic  treatment,  perhaps  enabling
optimal changes in treatment strategies and overcoming the
serious psychotic symptoms in the patients. To present these
merits, we review the five topics that should be addressed in
discussions of the issues concerning DSP and TRS (frequen-
cy, diagnosis, withdrawal study, action of aripiprazole, and
TD will be discussed one by one). These topics can be re-
viewed  because  substantial  data  from  multiple  studies  of
each topic have been collected, but those studies did not seri-
ously consider (or disregard) DSP and DS in their study de-
sign or discussion of findings or both, or some of the topics
were discussed separately without considering the connec-
tions among them. This can result in an underestimation of
the significant position of DSP.

To this end, the PubMed database was searched for rele-
vant  English  literature  up  to  May  2020.  We  used  search
terms such as “dopamine supersensitivity (psychosis)”, “re-
bound  (psychosis)”,  “withdrawal  (psychosis)”,  “relapse”,
“(tardive)  dyskinesia”,  “extrapyramidal  symptoms”  “treat-
ment-resistant (schizophrenia)”, “antipsychotic”, “long-term
treatment”,  “adverse event”,  “side effect”,  “dopamine  D2
 “long-acting  in-
receptor”,

 “haloperidol”,

 “clozapine”,

jectable”, “aripiprazole”, and “brexpiprazole”. We then read
the  manuscripts  yielded  by  the  PubMed  search  and  ex-
amined how they deal with topics relevant to DSP. We are
very interested in how the researchers in this field deal with
and discuss DSP, rather than in a systematic meta-analysis,
and thus our search methods did not cover all the relevant lit-
erature.

2.  THE  FREQUENCY  OF  DSP  AMONG  PATIENTS
WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA

The contention that patients with DSP are a minor sub-
type in schizophrenia or TRS may be based on the findings
from  several  studies  that  reported  a  not  very  high  rate  of
DSP in the studied cohort. Accumulating evidence showed
that  approx.  30%  of  patients  with  schizophrenia  develop
TRS throughout treatment [1, 45]. More recent long-term (>
5 year) follow-up studies suggested that patients who devel-
op TRS after exhibiting DS induced by treatment with an-
tipsychotic(s)  at  the  initial  stage  could  be  a  minor  group
among  the  entire  population  of  TRS  patients.  Lally  et  al.
[46] conducted a 5-year longitudinal study of 246 patients
with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP), and they reported that
at the final assessment point, 81 of the patients (33.7%) even-
tually  fulfilled  the  TRS  criteria.  In  addition,  56  of  the  pa-
tients who developed TRS (70%) did not achieve a state of
remission  at  all,  and  they  met  the  TRS  criteria  at  various
time points during the 5-year observation period. Similarly,
Demjaha  et  al.  [47]  followed  a  total  of  323  patients  with
FEP for 10 years, and they observed that 74 patients (23%)
met  the  TRS  criteria  at  varying  timepoints  during  the  10-
year observation, and 62 (84%) of the TRS patients did not
experience  symptomatic  remission  at  all.  The  two  studies
strongly suggest that a majority of TRS patients might have
been  vulnerable  to  TRS  from  their  early  stage  of  disease
(this  type  of  TRS  is  called  ‘early-onset  TRS’  in  both
studies). Based on these findings, some researchers conclud-
ed that patients with DSP or late-onset TRS are simply a mi-
nor subtype of TRS patients [33]. These two studies provid-
ed a quite important classification of TRS into early-onset
and late-onset TRS, but this classification might be insuffi-
cient when taking DSP more into consideration. This is be-
cause there may be some early-onset TRS patients who are
given  high-dose  treatment  and  subsequently  develop  TRS
(that is, patients having the pathologies of both early-onset
and late-onset TRS. Please see section 3.).

However, the development of DSP needs a much longer
period of treatment with antipsychotic(s), since typical DSP
signs or symptoms are generally observed in patients at the
chronic stage of the disease Point 2, Table 1. In animal mod-
els (usually rodents), the administration of haloperidol for
only 14 days generally establishes the DS state, but in hu-
man  subjects,  it  is  not  yet  known  how  long  antipsychotic
treatment is necessary for the development. Chouinard et al.
examined 224 patients (average age > 40 years old; average
dose of antipsychotic(s) > 700 mg of chlorpromazine-equiva-
lent [CP-eq.] dose), and 97 patients were classified as hav-
ing DSP, revealing a relatively high ratio (43%) [48]. How-
ever, in the same study, 174 patients (77.7%) who were

Table 1. Crucial points that should not be neglected when Dopamine Supersensitivity Psychosis (DSP) is considered.

Diagnosis of DSP in Clinical Practice.
Point 1. DSP observed in clinical practice presents broader psychopathologies than the phenomena discussed at the receptor level (that is, development of do-
pamine supersensitivity).
Point 2. A diagnosis of DSP generally requires that a patient has had both high-dose and long-term antipsychotic treatment.

The sign of DSP can present covertly or overlap with original TRS symptoms.
Point 3. Among patients with DSP, there are those who meet the criteria for TRS due to severe DSP, and those who meet the criteria for TRS due to DSP and
originally TRS that had existed from the beginning of schizophrenia.
Point 4. There are patients who develop latent DSP (covert DSP). (But it is generally possible to identify the clinical signs of dopamine supersensitivity in pa-
tients).

Tardive dyskinesia
Point 5. Tardive dyskinesia is a strong sign of the development of dopamine supersensitivity. This phenomena can exist covertly during on antipsychotic treat-
ment and can fluctuate or be masked under rebound psychosis.

Cautions to interpret opinions depending on previous findings since clinical practice and clinical studies are different in terms of patients’ background
and treatment condition.
Point 6. The frequency of DSP varies greatly depending on the background of the patients and past/present treatments in addition to the methodology of the
study.
Point 7. Rebound psychosis is generally included in relapse, but the reverse is not true. The withdrawal study prospectively observing relapse following the in-
tentional withdrawal of antipsychotics might not count true rebound psychosis. This can overlook rebound psychosis or include true relapse irrelevant to the
withdrawal.
Point 8. Worsening psychosis following switching to aripiprazole is the best indicator of dopamine supersensitivity. This phenomena can be influenced great-
ly by the background of patients and the switching method.

classified as not having DSP had been treated with a lower
CP-eq. dosage of antipsychotics (average 472 mg). We re-
ported that 72% of 147 TRS patients with approx. 20-year
treatment  histories  had  experienced  at  least  one  DSP  epi-
sode,  and  they  had  been  treated  with  high-dose  antipsy-
chotics, i.e., CP-eq. 770 mg [49]. We observed in another
study that a majority of non-TRS patients (79.4%) had not
had any previous DSP episode, and this group had been treat-
ed  with  relatively  low  antipsychotic(s)  of  CP-eq.  doses  at
452 mg [50]. The data from these two research groups indi-
cate that DSP appeared at a relatively high frequency among
patients at the chronic stage of the disease and that DSP was
linked  to  high-dose  antipsychotic  treatment  in  addition  to
long-term treatment. The medication states in these studies
[49, 50] were very similar in terms of antipsychotic dosage
and  treatment  duration,  which  were  apparently  higher  and
longer than those in the Lally et al. [46] and Demjaha et al.
studies [47].

Even though researchers directly checked DSP episodes,
some earlier studies might disregard them due to relatively
short-term observation. For example, a study reported that
only 12 patients among a total of 265 experienced a rebound
psychotic episode [51]. That study’s patients were followed
for  only  3  years,  and  DSP  episodes  before  and  after  this
short period might have been missed. In addition, the study
did  not  show  the  data  of  the  medical  states  (antipsychotic
treatment and duration of illness) of the patients judged as
the no DSP-type group, and it was thus unclear what type of
patients and what levels of severity of schizophrenia were in-
cluded Point 6, Table 1. On the other hand, in a study by Fal-
lon and his colleagues [27], 39% of the relapses of 41 pa-
tients met the criteria for DSP, based on the careful observa-
tion of stress vulnerability and TD.

When a given patient maintains the same drug regimen
with a good adherence level, DS that has developed could be
masked  since  rebound  psychosis  scarcely  occurs  (covert
DSP) [15] Point 4, Table 1. Accordingly, the estimations of
the rate of DSP could be greatly affected by the observation
methodology  (e.g.,  a  retrospective  or  prospective  design,
and  the  duration  subjected  to  study),  the  treatment  setting
(outpatients, inpatients or both), and the definition of the key
concepts for the diagnosis (relapse, DSP or TRS).

The rate of DSP could also differ among regions. It has
been pointed out that, particularly in Asian nations, antipsy-
chotic  polypharmacy  has  been  administered  to  many  pa-
tients [52, 53]. In Japan, clozapine became available to clini-
cal  practices  in  2009;  polytherapy  with  typical  antipsy-
chotics  was  common  before  2000,  and  polytherapy  with
both typical and atypical antipsychotics has been common
since then. The pharmaceutical and medical scenarios in spe-
cific countries and regions could lead to results at high or
low rate of DSP.

It may also be necessary to examine this issue from the
viewpoint of sex, i.e., the difference between male and fe-
male  patients.  Epidemiological  data  suggest  that  male  pa-
tients tend to experience the onset of schizophrenia earlier
and  go  on  to  experience  a  slightly  worse  prognosis  com-
pared to female patients [54]. It has been speculated that th-
ese differences are related to favorable effects of female hor-
mones or the higher transition rate from autistic spectrum di-
sorder to schizophrenia in male patients [55]. To date, how-
ever, there have been no data examining the relationship be-
tween sex and DS/DSP.

3.  DIFFICULTY  IN  DISTINGUISHING  BETWEEN
TOLERANCE  TO  THE  EFFECTS  OF  ANTIPSY-
CHOTICS AND THE NEUROPROGRESSIVE PATH-
WAY TO TRS

3.1.  Grade  of  Rebound  Psychosis  Depending  on  Devel-
oped Dopamine Supersensitivity

Since it is difficult to treat severe rebound psychosis ap-
propriately, it is difficult to judge whether it should be recog-
nized as DSP or as part of the process of developing TRS or
both. There has been little discussion on the potential rela-
tionship between emergence of rebound psychosis and TRS
[56, 57].

As  a  result  of  the  blockade  of  DRD2s  by  high-dose
and/or long-term antipsychotic treatment, primarily a com-
pensatory increase in the density of DRD2s (i.e., up-regula-
tion) and/or acquired supersensitivity of the receptors are in-
volved in rebound psychosis [24]. In DRD2-supersensitive
brains,  if  antipsychotic(s)  are  withdrawn  from  the  DRD2s
for various clinical reasons such as treatment withdrawal, ta-
pering-off, or switching an ongoing antipsychotic regimen,
endogenous dopamine binds with available DRD2s and stim-
ulates them, leading to worsened psychosis. In addition, re-
bound psychosis appears at varying intensities, which might
depend on the patients and clinical situations Point 1, Table
1. This form of rebound psychosis could be classified into
the following three forms based on the intensity.

The mildest form of rebound psychosis appears at somat-
ic and/or physiological levels such as nausea, anxiety, insom-
nia, restlessness, and hyperarousal. These symptoms general-
ly appear temporary, and it may thus be incorrect to consider
this from rebound “psychosis”. The phenomena in this form
are interpreted as the signs of a process of physiological ad-
justment  from  the  long-term  situation  with  the  complete
blockade of DRD2s to the new situation with less blockade.
This process is similar to the cases of benzodiazepine and an-
tidepressant withdrawal [58, 59].

The next form of rebound psychosis has a more severe
etiology  and  presents  with  exacerbations  of  delusions  and
hallucinations.  These  positive  symptoms  are  usually  the
same as the patient’s original psychotic symptoms. In most
cases, the rebound psychosis starts to appear within a rela-
tively short period (generally a few days to a couple of week-
s) immediately following the discontinuation, dosing-down,
or switching of ongoing antipsychotic(s). This form of re-
bound psychosis usually recovers quickly with the reinstate-
ment of the prior medication [16, 58, 60].

The most severe form of rebound psychosis shows resis-
tant symptoms against a further increase in antipsychotic(s)
and presents with irreversible psychotic symptoms. Certain
novel psychotic symptoms are sometimes accompanied by
the patient’s original symptoms. This state implies tolerance
to the effects of antipsychotics and might be interpreted as
the ‘final’ form of DSP. This severe form of DSP is strongly
linked to the development of TRS [16]. The state is similar
to treatment failure or to the development of tolerance to an-

tipsychotics observed in animal studies [20, 61-63]. Howev-
er, it is uncertain whether this tolerance to antipsychotics in
schizophrenia patients is completely identical to treatment
failure in animal models Point 1, Table 1. It is difficult to ex-
plain this severe form of rebound psychosis simply from the
viewpoints of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
the withdrawn antipsychotic(s), since quite high-dose treat-
ments providing a quite high occupancy rate of DRD2s are
not effective at all against the exacerbated psychosis. It may
thus be inappropriate to interpret this form as a type of re-
bound psychosis.

3.2.  Severe  Rebound  Psychosis,  The  Treatment-Resis-
tance Process, or Both?

The severe form of rebound psychosis can be recognized
as a process shifting to TRS, irrelevant to medication. This
final form of rebound psychosis is one of the most serious si-
tuations in the clinical course of schizophrenia, but it has not
been examined extensively in clinical research. This is also
related to the fact that relapse episodes often appear at a rela-
tively early stage; second and third acute psychotic episodes
(i.e.,  the  first  and  second  relapses)  tend  to  occur  within  a
few  years  after  the  introduction  of  treatment  for  FEP
[64-67].  Instability  of  the  psychopathology  at  this  stage
could be interpreted as a continuation of the patient’s FEP or
a further progression of the disease itself (i.e., the process of
becoming refractory to TRS). During treatment at an early
stage, some patients might have a concurrent DSP episode
in  addition  to  the  underlying  etiological  process  of  TRS
Point 3, Table 1. This complex nature of the clinical state at
an early stage of the disease leads to the further difficulty of
determining whether a given worsening of symptoms at the
early stage meets the criteria of DSP or not.

Taken the accumulated clinical findings together, it is ap-
parent that rebound psychosis takes varying forms depend-
ing on its severity Point 2, Table 1. It is reasonable to specu-
late  that  in  chronic-stage  patients,  when  a  relapse  appears
with  severe  psychopathology  following  a  relatively  stable
clinical course, the relapse episode includes the pathology of
DSP, regardless of the presence or absence of TRS. Howev-
er, milder forms of rebound psychosis without evident psy-
chotic symptoms may be disregarded by clinicians, and the
severe form can be confused with true TRS pathology irrele-
vant to the patient’s medication Point 3, Table 1. This point
presents a serious and unresolved issue concerning the rela-
tionship between DSP and TRS. In DSP, while some cases
have  the  potential  iatrogenic  aspect  of  unnecessary  high-
dose treatment which might be avoidable, others are treated
with a high dose of antipsychotics within the standard dose
range (i.e., CP-eq. dose <600-800 mg) as clinically accept-
able as standard pharmacotherapy. Particularly in the latter
type of patients, DSP might be interpreted as ‘getting stuck
in the TRS etiology’, in which is not possible to separate the
element of DSP from the original pathology of schizophre-
nia. A method or concept of differentiating them-that is, the
point at which DSP started or the weight that DSP carries in
the entire pathology-does not yet exist.

4. STUDIES OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC WITHDRAWAL

Careful attention should be paid to several clinical trials
examining the rates of rebound psychosis following the in-
tentional  withdrawal  of  ongoing  antipsychotic  regimens.
This  problem  is  related  to  the  difficulty  in  determining
whether the relevant rebound symptoms following medica-
tion withdrawal is a temporary phenomenon that occurs only
during  the  metabolizing  process  of  the  antipsychotic  or
whether it is a trigger that revokes a true psychotic relapse
[60, 68] Point 7, Table 1.

Similar studies designing the withdrawal of an ongoing
antipsychotic regimen reported varying rates of rebound psy-
chosis or relapse after the withdrawal [69-71]. These incon-
sistent findings are related to the lack of clarity in the defini-
tion of the primary outcome (i.e., worsening psychosis) in al-
most all of these studies. Each study did not mention which
type of worsening episode (i.e., redound psychosis only or
both  rebound  psychosis  and  true  relapse)  was  being  ex-
amined. In addition, most of the studies used terms such as
“withdrawal”, “rebound”, and “relapse”, with no description
of the specific intention as to why the study selected the ter-
m(s).  The  studies  used  these  terms,  but  almost  all  of  the
studies seemed to include all types of worsening psychotic
episodes after antipsychotic withdrawal, leading to some dif-
ficulty in understanding the authors’ hypothesis on the rela-
tionship between the withdrawal of an antipsychotic agent
and  changes  in  the  symptoms  or  clinical  course.  Another
problem of these withdrawal studies is also attributable to
the  ambiguity  in  capturing  the  patients’  worsening  symp-
toms. The significant parts of the studies depended only on
clinical records such as emergency hospital visits or rehospi-
talization information, perhaps implying only retrospective
chart reviews.

When  considering  a  study  that  attempted  to  observe
symptom worsening following the withdrawal of a specific
class or form of antipsychotics, readers should be very care-
ful to identify which types of worsening of the psychosis the
study observed, i.e., only rebound psychosis as DSP or both
rebound psychosis and natural relapse (which might be irrel-
evant to the withdrawal); otherwise, the interpretation of the
study’s data could be incorrect. For instance, when a study
has tried to estimate the rate of rebound psychosis after the
withdrawal of a specific agent but did not include patients
who had developed DS, it is not surprising that the rate of re-
bound psychosis is low. In such cases, it should not be con-
cluded that the agent caused less rebound psychosis.

Although the earlier studies examining the rate of the oc-
currence  of  symptom  worsening  had  designs  capturing  all
types of worsening psychosis following the withdrawal of
medication, it seems that their findings suggested a high rate
of rebound psychosis that was induced by the discontinua-
tion of an ongoing antipsychotic. A meta-analysis including
4,365 patients from a total of 66 studies of the discontinua-
tion of antipsychotic(s) indicated that 58.2% of the patients
whose  medication  was  withdrawn  experienced  worsening
symptoms, whereas only 15.6% of the patients maintaining
their medication did [72]. The studies included in that meta-
analysis may not have differentiated rebound psychosis (in-

duced by the withdrawal of medication) and relapse (which
can  occur  irrelevant  to  the  withdrawal).  However,  quite  a
few  of  the  studies  in  the  meta-analysis  reported  that  over
~50% of the patients in the withdrawal group experienced
symptom worsening, and these episodes occurred immediate-
ly  after  the  discontinuation  of  the  medication  [72].  More-
over, some of these studies observed that the doses of ongo-
ing antipsychotics prior to the withdrawals as a predictive
factor of the appearance of worsening symptoms [73]. Al-
though  the  meta-analysis  itself  did  not  establish  the  drug
dosages prior to the start of withdrawals as a predictor of the
consequent rebound psychosis, some of the studies included
in the meta-analysis reported relatively high rates of symp-
toms  worsening,  reflecting  the  characteristics  of  rebound
psychosis  that  could  be  recognized  as  due  to  the  with-
drawals,  rather  than  a  natural  relapse.

A recent meta-analysis that obtained more data than that
provided by Gilbert et al. [72] reported again that patients
 with  antipsychotics  was  maintained
whose  treatment
showed a lower relapse rate than those whose treatment with
antipsychotics was withdrawn [74]. However, the analysis
demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the
relapse rate among withdrawal groups between those with
rapid discontinuation and those with gradual discontinuation
and that the duration of the withdrawal procedure (i.e., the
speed of withdrawal) did not affect the subsequent relapse
rate, suggesting that the incidence of rebound psychosis was
not very high in the entire relapse population of the included
studies. A similar conclusion was reported from another me-
ta-analysis [75]. Thus, these previous studies, including me-
ta-analyses of withdrawal studies, yielded inconsistent find-
ings, providing no definite conclusion on whether the with-
drawal of antipsychotic(s) provokes a high rate of rebound
psychosis, although withdrawals that included all types of
symptom worsening were related to high relapse rats. These
inconsistent results among studies may be attributable to a
variety of factors such as the study design (i.e., prospective
vs. retrospective), the antipsychotic(s) withdrawal procedure
(i.e., abrupt discontinuation vs. gradual discontinuation), the
definition of relapse, and the follow-up duration or treatment
in the maintenance group [76].

In summary, a study of the intentional withdrawal of a
given  antipsychotic  may  accurately  capture  the  rate  of  re-
bound  psychosis,  particularly  when  conducted  with  a
prospective study design. In contrast, studies designed with
the inclusion of both rebound psychosis and other patterns
of symptom worsening cannot identify the occurrence rate
of only rebound psychosis: the interpretation of such data re-
quires caution. The more important factor to interpret the re-
sults is the patients’ backgrounds i.e., whether or not the pa-
tients  have  DS-rather  than  the  class  of  antipsychotics
studied. It is not surprising that the reported rates of symp-
tom  worsening  after  withdrawals  have  been  low  even  for
agents that have a profile that is likely to cause rebound psy-
chosis  (such  as  a  short-half  life  and  loose  binding  with
DRD2s) when many patients without DS were included in
the studies. When we discuss the rate of rebound psychosis
or relapse, based on data from these intentional withdrawal

2220   Current Neuropharmacology, 2021, Vol. 19, No. 12

studies, it is not possible to do so without considering the pa-
tients’ backgrounds (especially those that include developed
DS).

5. THE EFFECT OF ARIPIPRAZOLE ON DSP

Aripiprazole, a dopamine partial agonist, exhibits non-in-
feriority to other atypical antipsychotics (except for cloza-
pine)  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  schizophrenia.
Aripiprazole also presents fewer risks of several types of ad-
verse  events  such  as  extrapyramidal  symptoms,  metabolic
syndrome,  and  hyperprolactinemia  [77].  However,  ever
since aripiprazole became  available for clinical use, many
case reports and several studies reported that when aripipra-
zole was switched from another antipsychotic(s) or was add-
ed to other ongoing antipsychotic(s) in a given patient, the
patient experienced a worsening of psychotic symptoms [78,
79].

In an animal model, it was demonstrated that DS estab-
lished by haloperidol could be ameliorated by the administra-
tion of aripiprazole [21], although a study using young rats
reported that aripiprazole caused DS [80]. However, reversal
phenomena are thought to occur in humans. That is, in pa-
tients with established DS, the DRD2 partial agonist mech-
anism of the agent stimulates supersensitive DRD2s, result-
ing in symptoms worsening [24] Point 8, Table 1. This theo-
ry is related to the unique characteristics of aripiprazole as
dopamine  partial  agonist:  i.e.,  its  agonistic  or  antagonistic
function that is changeable depending on dopamine tone or
available receptor reserve [81, 82]. That is, presynaptic do-
paminergic  neurons,  not  limited  to  post-synaptic  DRD2s,
might also commit to this phenomenon (worsening symptom
after addition of aripiprazole) [83].

The review articles which did not consider DSP impor-
tant  in  the  etiology  of  TRS  did  not  make  any  comments
about  worsening  psychosis  due  to  aripiprazole.  However,
this phenomenon is often observed in clinical practice [33,
34, 36]. Unfortunately, only one study examined the possibil-
ity that DS may be involved in the worsening of psychosis
by the addition of or switching to aripiprazole [84]; that ret-
rospective study of 264 patients whose antipsychotic medica-
tion was switched to aripiprazole revealed that 56 of 70 pa-
tients who were judged as having DS consequently showed
a failure of the switch to aripiprazole, and 16 of the 56 pa-
tients exhibited a worsening of positive symptoms. On the
other hand, the 194 patients who were judged as not having
DS exhibited a very high continuous rate of success after the
switch to aripiprazole, and since the worsening of positive
symptoms was observed in only 16 patients, there was a sig-
nificantly low rate of aripiprazole treatment drop-out com-
pared to the patients with DS [84].

Several studies identified the following as being related
to failure in switching to aripiprazole: treatment with high-
dose medication [85-87], treatment over a long-term period
[88], or both [89]. In contrast, patients with low-dose medi-
cation  and  even  those  with  TD  have  been  successfully
switched to aripiprazole [90]. These differences in the suc-
cess or failure of switching to aripiprazole may be derived

from the degree of severity of DSP and the method of switch-
ing to aripiprazole. There are a few studies denying the possi-
bility  of  symptom  worsening  by  a  switch  to  aripiprazole
compared to switching to other antipsychotic(s) [91-94].

More  importantly,  the  success/failure  of  switching  to
aripiprazole  could  be  greatly  affected  by  the  switching
methodology [95]. A rapid switch to aripiprazole, in particu-
lar,  was  related  to  higher  rates  of  relapse  and  of  dropping
out of the study relative to add-on switching or cross-titra-
tion, as confirmed by several studies [85, 96-98], with the ex-
ception of one study [99]. The clear differentiation in symp-
tom  worsening  between  rapid  and  gradual  switching  to
aripiprazole well reflect one of the diagnosis criteria of DSP,
showing  that  rebound  psychosis  occurs  when  medications
are  rapidly  withdrawn,  but  not  when  gradually  withdrawn
[16].

These findings from a series of studies of switching to
aripiprazole indicated that a failure of switching to aripipra-
zole and maintaining aripiprazole after the switch could be
involved in the established DS, since these worsening situa-
tions  implied  rebound  psychosis  Point  8,  Table  1.  To  the
best of our knowledge, there is no reported evidence that the
effects of DS on switching to oral aripiprazole could also be
true of other dopamine partial agonists such as once-month-
ly injectable aripiprazole and brexpiprazole. However, symp-
tom exacerbation following a switch to aripiprazole was re-
ported to result in a typical case of rebound psychosis, and
this potential outcome is emphasized in the new diagnosis
criteria of DSP that are used when determining whether pa-
tients have DSP [26].

6. TARDIVE DYSKINESIA IN DSP

TD is the most representative neurological sign suggest-
ing DS [24]. TD has been included in the research criteria of
DSP [16, 26, 27]. However, several matters should be con-
sidered when TD is discussed in relation to TRS.

A small portion of patients with TD could be classified
as having the intolerant type of TRS due to his/her TD itself,
but  this  is  relatively  rare.  This  type  of  patients  sometimes
have both TD and tardive dystonia, and the latter contributes
more seriously to the reduction of patients’ daily function-
ing.  It  has  been  reported  that  both  of  these  tardive  syn-
dromes  can  appear  concomitantly  in  patients  with  each  of
the tardive syndromes at a relatively high rate [100].

Serious issues have been raised in the recent literature:
whether DS underlies TD and whether the existence of TD
as a sign of DS truly contributes to the development of TRS.
This viewpoint i.e., TD reflects DS was a premise of both
the  basic  and  clinical  research  in  earlier  years  [101,  102],
but recent findings that neurotransmitter systems other than
that  of  dopamine  could  be  involved  in  the  etiology  of  TD
seem to cast some doubt on the classical viewpoint [103].
Particularly, the role of vesicular transporters within presy-
naptic neurons are quite important findings, and VMAT 2 in-
hibitors with a relevant mechanical action are being applied
to the actual treatment strategy [104-106]. In addition, sever-

Dopamine Supersensitivity and Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia

Current Neuropharmacology, 2021, Vol. 19, No. 12   2221

al lines of evidence provided the basis of the oxidative stress
theory as the mechanism of TD [107].

However, TD can arise due to treatment with typical an-
tipsychotic(s)  at  a  higher  rate  compared  to  treatment  with
typical antipsychotic(s) [15, 108]. The development of TD is
related to higher-dose and longer-term treatment [109], and
is temporarily effective with the addition of an antipsychot-
ic;  however,  dyskinesia  could  be  subsequently  worsened
[110]. TD Clozapine is highly effective for TD, possibly due
to which has a loose binding profile with DRD2s with cloza-
pine [111]. All of the above reports provide evidence that
the blockade of DRD2s by antipsychotic(s) is directly relat-
ed to the later occurrence of TD Point 5, Table 1. Thus, the
involvement  of  other  neurotransmitter  systems  or  mech-
anisms other than DS does not preclude the classical view-
point that the DS of DRD2s underlies TD.

Another  question  is  related  to  a  few  studies  reporting
that TD was not accompanied by rebound psychosis, suggest-
ing that the former could be irrelevant to DS and TRS [112].
On the other hand, some studies contradict this; that is, TD
appeared concomitantly with rebound psychosis at a relative-
ly  high  rate  [15,  113,  114].  This  controversy  can  be  ex-
plained in light of the following two characteristics of TD:
(1)  whether  or  not  the  study  subjects  had  developed  DS,
which is a point similar to our previous discussion of with-
drawal studies, and (2) whether TD has been established but
covertly masked for a long time period [115]. That is, patien-
t's backgrounds concerning medication (i.e., established DS
or not in study’s cohort) or study’s design concerning when
TD is judged (i.e., during on-medication or following medi-
cation withdrawal) can influence the study’s result.

However, it remains unclear whether TD itself without
rebound psychosis can lead to the development of TRS. Our
previous  investigations  defining  TD  as  DSP  demonstrated
that few subjects were classified as having DSP due to with
TD and without rebound psychosis [38, 49]. Our findings in-
dicated that the rate of TD was not so much higher in the
TRS  patients,  regardless  of  high-dose  treatment.  If  this  is
true, it is possible that in discussions of the contributing role
of DS in the pathway to TRS, the role of TD is not equal to
that of rebound psychosis, which is partly in line with the
viewpoint  that  TD  does  not  play  a  significant  role  in  the
pathology of DSP [33].

To  date,  there  are  few  data  regarding  the  concurrent
emergence of TD with rebound psychosis, which may have
led  to  an  underestimation  of  the  significance  of  TD  when
DSP are counted. An issue that remains to be addressed is
the diagnostic value of TD when studying and discussing its
role in the development of TRS.

CONCLUSION

The  present  review  categorized  both  data  dealing  with
DSP and data concerning the discussion about DSP based on
five topics. Regarding the frequency of DSP, the follow-up
or observation durations could greatly affect the frequency.
Episodes  of  tolerance  to  antipsychotic  effects  can  be  con-

fused or overlapped with the inherent procession to TRS, im-
plying the difficulty of accurately judge the potential back-
ground of the development of TRS. Almost all withdrawal
studies analyzed all types of symptom worsening together
(including rebound psychosis), which has led to unclear dis-
cussions about drug withdrawal and relapse. The worsening
of a patient’s condition after switching to aripiprazole has
been suggested to be due to DSP itself, but most studies’ dis-
cussions  disregard  this  valuable  and  unfavorable  pheno-
menon. TD is one of the most typical signs of DS, but the
significance of TD can vary, depending on the context relat-
ing to TRS, DSP, or other extrapyramidal symptoms.

The current controversy surrounding the phenomenon of
DSP  may  cause  physicians  to  minimize  or  overlook  DSP
when treating their patients with schizophrenia and seems re-
lated to a general trend of holding schizophrenia patients re-
sponsible for their own disease recurrence. In addition, the
ambiguity surrounding DSP as a clinical entity could make
it  difficult  for  physicians  to  balance  their  short-term  and
long-term goals for pharmacotherapy in their patients with
schizophrenia.

Mechanisms  other  than  those  involving  post-synaptic
DRD2s may be involved in the etiology of DSP, and this eti-
ology may be further overlapped with the etiology of schi-
zophrenia itself. This complexity has led to difficulty in dis-
cussing them separately (i.e., the disease itself and antipsy-
chotic-induced DSP). TD research might help clarify mech-
anisms  other  than  post-synaptic  DRD2s  that  might  be  in-
volved. In addition, the new evidence described herein does
not devalue the significance of clinical DSP in consideration
of the disease process and the limitations of antipsychotics’
effects.
