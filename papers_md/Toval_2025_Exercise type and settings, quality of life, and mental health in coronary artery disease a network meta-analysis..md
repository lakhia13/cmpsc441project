Abstract

Background and 
Aims

Individuals with coronary artery disease have poorer mental health, health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), and cognition 
compared with (age-matched) controls. Exercise training may attenuate these effects. The aim is to systematically review 
and meta-analyse the effects of different exercise types and settings on brain structure/function, cognition, HR-QoL, mental 
health (e.g. depression, anxiety), and sleep in patients with coronary artery disease.

A systematic search was conducted and a network meta-analysis compared (i) exercise types, high-intensity interval training 
(HIIT), HIIT + resistance (HIIT + R), moderate-intensity training (MIT), MIT + R and stretching-toning-balance training, and 
(ii) exercise settings, in-person and home-based.

Results
A total of 42 randomized controlled trials with a parallel group design were identified, of which 36 were included in the 
meta-analysis. Few studies included cognition (n = 2), sleep (n = 2), and none brain structure/function (n = 0). Most studies 
examined HR-QoL (n = 30), depression (n = 15), and anxiety (n = 9), in which outcomes were meta-analysed. HIIT + R, 
HIIT, and MIT were associated with improved HR-QoL vs. no exercise (i.e. usual care) [standardized mean difference, 
SMD: 1.53 (95% confidence interval 0.83; 2.24), 0.44 (0.15; 0.73), and 0.44 (0.20; 0.67), respectively]. In-person exercise 
was  associated  with  larger  and  significant  improvements  [HR-QoL  SMD:  0.51  (0.28;  0.74),  depressive  SMD:  −0.55 
(−1.03; −0.07), and anxiety symptoms SMD: −1.16 (−2.05; −0.26)] compared with no exercise, whereas home-based 
programmes were not significantly associated with improvements in these outcomes. Findings were robust in secondary 
(i.e. intervention duration and volume) and sensitivity analyses excluding high risk of bias studies.

these outcomes.

Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most prevalent type of cardiovas-

cular  disease  (CVD)  and  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  mortality, 

morbidity, and economic burden worldwide.1–4 Recently, several stud-
ies have revealed that the incidence of cognitive impairment in patients 
with CAD is markedly higher compared with age-matched healthy con-
trols.5–9 Likewise, the prevalence of depression and anxiety in cardiac 

Which exercise type and setting is most effective in improving brain-related outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)?• In this network meta-analysis, most studied outcomes were health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), depression, and anxiety, while brain    structure/function, cognition, and sleep were investigated in very few studies.• No differences were observed between types of exercise.• In-person exercise, but not home-based, was associated with improved HR-QoL, depression, and anxiety.Prescribing exercise, especially through in-person programs, is associated with improvements in HR-QoL, less depressive symptoms and reduced anxiety in patients with CAD, while previously used home-based exercise interventions need to be optimized to obtain brain-related benefits.Key QuestionKey FindingTake Home Message3534 patients with coronary arterydisease participating in 36 exercise-basedrandomized controlled trialsAdvanced network meta-analyticmethods were used to comparethe effectiveness of different typesand settings of exercise on health-relatedquality of life, depression and anxietyIn-personHome0.51 [0.28; 0.74]0.22 [-0.01; 0.45]88-2-1012Which exercise type and setting is the most effective in improving health-related quality of life,depression and anxiety in patients with coronary artery disease?Health-related quality of life total scoreSettingSMD [95% CI]ComparisonsIn-personHome0.45 [0.21; 0.69]0.16 [-0.07; 0.40]67-2-1012Mental component scoreIn-personHome-1.16 [-2.05; -0.26]-0.12 [-1.36; 1.12]63-2-101267-2-1012In-personHome0.32 [0.03; 0.61]0.21 [-0.07; 0.48]Physical component scoreIn-personHome-0.55 [-1.03; -0.07]-0.15 [-0.82; 0.52]84-2-1012AnxietyDepression2188

patients is four times higher (15%–20%) than in the general population 
(5%), resulting not only in an increased morbidity and mortality but also 
in a decreased health-related quality of life (HR-QoL).10–14

Brain health is a broad concept referring to the optimal functioning of 
behavioural and biological brain measures and the subjective experi-
ences arising from brain function. This means that brain health includes 
outcomes  related  to  neurobiological  markers  (e.g.  structural  brain 
morphology, brain function) and its behavioural manifestations, such 
as cognitive function, HR-QoL, mental health disorders (e.g. depres-
sion, anxiety), and sleep.15,16 Thus, it is necessary to identify effective 
and sustainable initiatives, which can attenuate the accelerated brain 
health deterioration in the CAD patient population.5–14

Mounting evidence supports that exercise training has important sys-
temic and multi-organ health benefits in patients with CAD15,17–23 and is 
recommended in clinical guidelines of the American Heart Association24
and  the  European  Society  of  Cardiology.25 Importantly,  literature 
showed that exercise might also mitigate cognitive and mental health im-
pairments observed in this population. However, the effect of different 
types and settings of exercise on distinct domains of brain health remains 
unclear. The ambiguity is partly due to the diversity (e.g. type, duration) 
and settings (e.g. in-person, home-based) of exercise interventions, het-
erogeneity in the instruments to assess different brain-related outcomes, 
and  the  predominant  use  of  multi-component  interventions.19,26–28
Advances in meta-analytic methods, such as network meta-analysis tech-
niques, allow for better synthesis of existing evidence, including direct and 
indirect comparisons among different types and settings of exercise.

Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis exam-
ines  the  impact  of  different  exercise  types  and  settings  on  a  broad 
set of brain-related outcomes. More specifically, the study aims to (i) 
systematically identify and synthesize current literature examining the 
effects  of  physical  exercise  on  brain-related  outcomes  in  individuals 
with CAD and (ii) quantify and compare the effect of different types 
and settings of exercise on the most studied outcomes in CAD patients 
using a network meta-analysis.

Methods

Protocol and registration
This  systematic  review  and  network  meta-analysis  has  been  designed 
and  reported  in  accordance  with  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020 statement),29 the ex-
tended  PRISMA  statement  for  Network  Meta-Analyses,30 the  Cochrane 
Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions,31 and  the  National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2021) guidelines.32 The protocol 
was previously registered in the international database of systematic reviews 
PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023402569, in March 2023).

Search strategy and information sources
Selection of eligible studies and search strategy was structured following the 
PICOS  (Population/Patient,  Intervention,  Comparison/Control,  Outcome 
and Study design) framework strategy.31 Detailed description of the search 
strategy can be found in Supplementary data online, File S1. The systematic 
search has been conducted in different electronic databases, from inception 
to 12 June 2023, including Web of Science, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, 
EMBASE,  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials,  SPORTDiscus,  and 
PsycINFO. In addition, we also included the Google Scholar search engine. 
Due to the limitation of characters allowed in Google Scholar, the search 
strategy was adapted, and the first 200 results sorted by relevance were ex-
tracted as previously recommended.33 The search strategy was developed 
among  several  researchers  (A.T.,  E.A.B.,  J.B.G.-M.,  F.B.O.,  P.S.-U.,  and 

I.E.-C.) and optimized for different search engines using the Polyglot Search 
Translator tool from SR-Accelerator website (https://sr-accelerator.com/).34

Eligibility criteria
Studies were included if they (i) assessed effects of physical activity or ex-
ercise programmes on brain structure/function, cognition, HR-QoL, men-
tal health, and sleep in patients with CAD aged 18 years or older, (ii) were 
intervention studies involving any type of physical exercise, and (iii) in-
cluded at least two conditions/intervention groups (i.e. exercise vs. con-
trol or exercise vs. exercise), since we were interested in comparisons. 
Studies  were  excluded  when  (i)  they  had  a  quasi-experimental  design 
without comparison group/condition, (ii) they were animal studies, (iii) 
they included patients with other CVDs, unless the study population con-
tained >85% of patients with CAD, (iv) they consisted of grey literature 
(e.g.  letters  to  the  editor,  congress  abstracts,  unpublished  studies),  (v) 
they were not published in English, Spanish, Dutch, or Portuguese, and 
(vi) study arms were excluded when they combined exercise with other 
therapies (e.g. pharmacologic treatment, diet, psychological, or education-
al therapy) unless the intervention groups only differed on the exercise 
component.

Study selection process
The study identification, screening, and inclusion of eligible studies were car-
ried out by three reviewers (A.T., E.A.B., and J.B.G.-M.) independently and 
followed the PRISMA flow chart (Figure 1). After a comprehensive search 
of  multiple  databases,  duplicate  publications  were  removed.  Next,  the 
titles and abstracts were screened, and then the full texts were screened 
against inclusion/exclusion criteria. When necessary, an additional reviewer 
(F.B.O.) resolved discrepancies between reviewers prior to reaching a con-
sensus. Covidence software was used to manage records throughout the 
study  selection/screening  process.35 For  the  quantitative  synthesis  (net-
work meta-analysis), we only included the studies assessing HR-QoL, de-
pression,  and/or  anxiety  due  to  the  low  number  of  studies  assessing 
other brain-related outcomes.

Data extraction and processing
Data from included records were extracted by two researchers independ-
ently (A.T. and E.A.B.) using a standardized, pre-specified, and piloted form. 
Based on the PICOS strategy, we extracted information on the population 
and study characteristics, intervention, comparison, and outcomes. More 
details  are  provided  in  Supplementary  data  online,  File  S2 (extended 
methods).

Categories of different types of exercise
Many studies have shown the differential physiological adaptations derived 
from different types of exercise, such as aerobic training, resistance training, 
and the combination of aerobic and resistance training.36,37 Furthermore, 
studies suggested differential effects on physiological outcomes as response 
to  high-intensity  interval  training  (HIIT)  and  moderate-intensity  training 
(MIT)38,39 justifying that HIIT and MIT could be considered as two different 
types  of  exercise.40 We  categorized  the  studies  into  five  exercise  types 
based on available literature and the designs of the network plots: HIIT, 
MIT, HIIT with resistance training (HIIT + R), MIT with resistance training 
(MIT + R), and stretching-toning-balance training (STBT; Table 1). The fol-
lowing  information  on  the  exercise  interventions  was  extracted  from 
each study: exercise type, setting (i.e. in-person or home-based), duration 
of  the  intervention,  frequency  (sessions/week),  duration  of  the  sessions, 
and exercise intensity (i.e. moderate or high). Due to the large heterogen-
eity of reporting exercise intensity (e.g. % of maximum heart rate, % of max-
imum  oxygen  uptake,  rate  of  perceived  exertion)  and  the  number  of 
repetitions during resistance exercise, we decided not to extract or analyse 
this information.

Data processing
Change-from-baseline values (to post-intervention) were used as main out-
come. We calculated missing standard deviations (SDs) based on the stand-
ard error, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), or inter-quartile range.31 As most 
studies  did  not  report  change-from-baseline  values,  we  estimated  the 
change-from-baseline with corresponding SDs using the pre- and post- 
intervention values with an imputed correlation of 0.66.31 This imputed 
correlation was based on the weighted average correlation from some 
of  the  included  studies  reporting  change-from-baseline  values  for  the 
study  outcomes  (n = 7).  For  the  sensitivity  analyses,  we  used  a  more 
conservative  correlation  of  0.50.32 When  the  change-from-baseline 
and the pre- and post-intervention values were not reported, we con-
tacted  the  study  authors  to  request  this  information  (n = 4).41–44 For 
studies including only a visual presentation (n = 1),45 we used a graphical 
software  programme  (WebPlotDigitizer,  version  4.6,  https://automeris. 
io/WebPlotDigitizer)46,47 and  averaged  the  results  of  both  reviewers 
(A.T. and E.A.B.). More detailed information about the data processing 
and calculating the overall and mental component score (MCS) and phys-
ical component score (PCS) of HR-QoL are described in the extended 
methods (see Supplementary data online, File S2).

Risk of bias
Risk of bias was assessed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the 
Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2) for randomized trials.48 Two reviewers 

(A.T. and E.A.B.) individually assessed the risk of bias, and disagreements 
were solved between the two reviewers or by consulting the third reviewer 
(F.B.O.) if necessary. To evaluate the certainty of the evidence, we used the 
Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis.49,50

Statistical analyses
Our network meta-analysis compared the effect of different (i) exercise 
types, i.e. HIIT, HIIT + R, MIT, MIT + R, and STBT, and (ii) exercise settings 
i.e. in-person and home-based, on the most studied outcomes (i.e. HR-QoL, 
depression, and anxiety). Of the 37 studies focused on these outcomes, all 
but one were RCTs. Therefore, we excluded the single non-RCT51 from 
the  analyses  to  obtain  more  robust  and  homogeneous  estimates  based 
only on the best study design, i.e. RCTs. We created network geometry 
graphs  to  examine  the  shape  of  the  network  of  HR-QoL,  PCS,  MCS, 
depression,  and  anxiety.  We  excluded  outcomes  from  the  network 
meta-analysis when a star-shaped network occurred (i.e. one intervention 
is compared with all others but direct comparisons between these others 
are absent). Next, we conducted a random-effects network meta-analysis 
of  which  specific  details  are  provided  in  the  extended  methods  (see 
Supplementary data online, File S2). The results were presented using league 
tables and forest plots of the network estimates using no exercise as refer-
ence category. The main network meta-analysis assumptions (i.e. transitivity 
and consistency) were checked (see Supplementary data online, File S2). 
We  assessed  statistical  heterogeneity  in  each  pairwise  and  network 
meta-analysis  comparison  using  t²  and  I²  statistics.  The  I2  statistic  was 

2190

Table 1  Characteristics of the exercise types included 
in the network meta-analysis

MIT

Aerobic moderate continuous training refers to exercise 

interventions that increase heart rate and energy 
expenditure with a constant but moderate intensity. It 
includes activities such as walking, jogging and cycling, 
outdoor or indoor

HIIT

Aerobic high-intensity interval training refers to exercise 
interventions that consist of short and repeated bouts 
performed at high intensity (i.e. close to maximal 
intensities), interspersed by periods of lower intensity 
exercise or rest for recovery

MIT + R Aerobic moderate continuous training combined with 

resistance training. Resistance exercise refers to exercise 
interventions that aim to increase muscular strength and 
power, including exercises performed with dumbbells, 
Thera-bands, or pneumatic machines

HIIT + R Aerobic high-intensity interval training combined with 

resistance training. Resistance exercise refers to exercise 
interventions that aim to increase muscular strength and 
power, including exercises performed with dumbbells, 
Thera-bands, or pneumatic machines

STBT

Stretching-toning-balance training. Refers to physical 
exercises that include Tai-Chi, yoga, qigong, among 
others, excluding interventions focused on or combined 
with mind exercises

interpreted as not important (0%–30%), moderate (30%–50%), substantial 
(50%–75%), or considerable (75%–100%), and the corresponding P-values 
were also considered. Ranking probabilities for different exercise interven-
tions were estimated using P-scores. P-scores were measured on a scale 
from 0 (worst) to 1 (best). Finally, we created funnel plots to explore po-
tential presence of publication bias. We did not perform statistical testing 
for publication bias, because there were <10 studies available per direct 
comparison.52

Based on the results of the main analysis (i.e. no clear differences between 
exercise intensity such as HIIT vs. MIT), we examined the effect of in-person 
vs. home-based exercise vs. no exercise by creating a new network. Since 
the difference between HIIT and MIT was absent but the difference be-
tween exercise settings (i.e. in-person vs. home-based) was clearly present, 
we decide to create the following groups for the additional analyses on dur-
ation and total volume: in-person exercise >12 weeks, in-person exercise 
≤12 weeks, home-based exercise >12 weeks, and home-based exercise 
≤12 weeks and in-person exercise >24 h (total volume is hours trained 
during the intervention), in-person exercise ≤24 h, home-based exercise 
>24 h, and home-based exercise ≤24 h. Study characteristics of Table 2
were used to create cut-off values for duration (i.e. 12 weeks) and total vol-
ume (i.e. 24 h). Sensitivity analyses were performed using a conservative 
correlation (0.5) and excluding studies with a high risk of bias. The analyses 
were performed with R (version 4.2.3) using the packages ‘netleague’ and 
‘netmeta’. Statistical significance (two sided) was set at P < .05.

Results

Synthesis of studies found in the 
systematic search
Our systematic search identified 2380 studies, of which 145 underwent 
full-text review. Additionally, four studies were identified from manual 

citation searching. A total of 42 studies28,41–45,51,53–87 were included in 
the  qualitative  synthesis  and  36  studies28,42,43,45,53–76,78–84 were  in-
cluded in the quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) as summarized in 
Figure 1. From the 42 studies included in the qualitative synthesis, the 
most assessed outcome was HR-QoL (36 studies, 86%; n = 3476 sub-
jects), followed by depression (17 studies, 40%; n = 2032) and anxiety 
(9 studies, 21%; n = 946). Two studies evaluated cognitive function, two 
studies examined sleep, and none of the studies evaluated neurobio-
logical markers, such as structure and function using neuroimaging tech-
niques or any other methods.

Characteristics of studies included in the 
network meta-analysis
The 36 studies included in the meta-analysis were RCTs with parallel 
group  design  using  the  outcomes  HR-QoL  (n = 30),  depression 
(n = 15),  and  anxiety  (n = 9).  Overall,  3534  participants  with  CAD 
were  randomly  assigned  to  exercise  (n = 2707)  or  no  exercise 
(n = 827). In all studies, the ‘no exercise’-intervention arm consisted 
of usual care. The mean age was 62 (SD 9.3) years, and the mean per-
centage  of  women  was  23%.  Most  interventions  were  performed 
when patients were eligible for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) or within 
2–6 months after the cardiovascular event (23 studies, 64% of the total 
included).  The  most  common  exercise  was  MIT  (26  studies,  72%, 
n = 1479), followed by HIIT (15 studies, 42%, n = 621), MIT + R (7 stud-
ies, 19%, n = 473), STBT (2 studies, 6%, n = 89), and HIIT + R (1 study, 
3%,  n = 45).  In-person  exercise  was  performed  in  28  studies  (78%, 
n =2065), while home-based interventions were performed in 14 stud-
ies (39%, n = 642; Table 2).

We found no clear evidence of violations of the transitivity assump-
tion in the studies characteristics (Table 2) suggesting that the included 
participants  had  similar  characteristics  (i.e.  effect  modifiers)  across 
comparisons. In  terms  of risk  of bias,  most  studies  were rated  with 
some concerns (18 studies; 50% of the included studies), followed by 
a  low  risk  (10  studies,  28%)  and  a  high  risk  (8  studies,  22%,  see 
Supplementary data online, Figures S1 and S2).

Structure of network
Figure 2 shows the networks of eligible comparisons for HR-QoL, 
depression,  and  anxiety  of  the  main  analyses  regarding  exercise 
types.  The  network  graphs  of  HR-QoL  were  well  connected, 
but for depression and anxiety, we found a star network that pre-
vented  us  from  running  analyses  including  indirect  comparisons. 
Supplementary  data  online,  Figure  S3 presents  the  networks  for 
the  analyses  regarding  exercise  setting  (i.e.  in-person  vs.  home- 
based vs. no exercise), in which all networks were well connected. 
For  the  secondary  analyses  focused  on  intervention  duration  and 
total exercise volume, the network plots were well connected for 
all  HR-QoL  outcomes,  but  not  for  the  depression  and  anxiety 
(i.e. star shaped).

Different types of exercise and 
health-related quality of life
Based  on  the  network  meta-analysis,  in-person  HIIT + R  was  asso-
ciated with the largest, statistically significant improvement for the to-
tal score of HR-QoL [standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.53, 95% 
CI 0.83; 2.24, Figure 3 and Table 3] compared with no exercise, fol-
lowed by in-person HIIT (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.15; 0.73) and in-person 
MIT (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.20; 0.67). However, in-person HIIT + R was

solely  based  on  one  study,  whereas  in-person  HIIT  and  MIT  were 
based  on  multiple  comparisons.  No  differences  were  found  in 
HR-QoL  changes  between  HIIT  and  MIT,  either  in-person  (SMD 
0.00,  95%  CI  −0.20;  0.21)  or  home-based  (SMD  −0.09,  95%  CI 
−0.50; 0.32, Table 3).

In-person HIIT (SMD 0.41; 95% CI 0.05–0.77) and in-person MIT 
(SMD 0.36; 95% CI 0.05; 0.67) were significantly associated with im-
provements  in  the  PCS  compared  with  no  exercise  (Figure  3 and 
Table 3). In-person STBT (SMD 1.19; 95% CI 0.58; 1.79), in-person 
MIT (SMD 0.37; 95% CI 0.11; 0.64), and in-person HIIT (SMD 0.37; 
95% CI 0.07; 0.67) were significantly associated with improvements 
in the MCS (Figure 3 and Table 3). In-person STBT was solely based 
on  one  comparison  (that  was  rated  as  high  risk  of  bias,  see 
Supplementary data online, Figure S2), whereas in-person HIIT and 
MIT were based on multiple comparisons and are therefore more ro-
bust estimates. No differences were found between HIIT and MIT in 
the improvement of the PCS and MCS, either in-person and home- 
based (Table 3).

All pairwise comparisons for the different HR-QoL outcomes are 
shown in Supplementary data online, Figures S4–S6. We found no global 
inconsistency using the random-effects model for the overall score of 
HR-QoL,  PCS,  and  MCS,  but  local  inconsistency  was  presented  for 
some  comparisons  (see  Supplementary  data  online,  Figures  S7–S9). 
The funnel plots included both positive and negative mean differences 
(see Supplementary data online, Figure S10).

Different types of exercise and depressive 
and anxiety symptoms
Only pairwise comparisons (i.e. conventional meta-analysis and not net-
work meta-analysis) were performed for depression and anxiety due to 
star-shaped  networks  (see  Supplementary  data  online,  Figures  S11
and S12). No statistically significant improvements for depression and 
anxiety were found for different types of exercise.

In-person vs. home-based exercise
In-person  exercise  was  associated  with  significant  improvements 
of  HR-QoL,  depression,  and  anxiety  compared  with  no  exercise 
(Figure  4,  Table 4,  and Structured  Graphical Abstract).  A  smaller  and 
non-significant effect of home exercise on all outcomes was found. 
All pairwise  comparisons are  shown  in Supplementary  data  online, 
Figures S13–S17. There was no evidence for global or local inconsist-
ency (see Supplementary data online, Figures S18–S22).

Additional analyses
Secondary analyses examining the effect of the intervention duration 
and total exercise volume of the intervention on HR-QoL showed 
similar effect estimates between longer vs. shorter intervention dur-
ation and between larger vs. smaller total training volumes, in which 
all were in favour of in-person exercise. Except for the PCS when 
comparing in-person exercise >12 weeks, in-person >24 h, and in- 
person  ≤24 h  with  no  exercise,  no  significant  effects  were  found 
(see Supplementary data online, Tables S3 and S4). Sensitivity ana-
lyses  using  a  conservative  correlation  (0.5)  and  excluding  studies 
with a high risk of bias resulted in similar effect estimates compared 
with our main analyses (see Supplementary data online, Tables S1
and S2).

Figure 2 Network of eligible comparisons for different brain-related outcomes. The width of the lines is proportional to the number of trials com-
paring each pair of treatments. The size of the nodes is proportional to the number of participants. The outcomes were assessed as follows: (i) overall 
score of health-related quality of life in n = 30, (ii) PCS of health-related quality of life in n = 25, (iii) MCS of health-related quality of life in n = 25, (iv) 
depression in n = 15, and (v) anxiety in n = 9 studies. HIIT, high-intensity interval training; HIIT + R, high-intensity interval training plus resistance training; 
MIT,  moderate-intensity  training;  MIT + R,  moderate-intensity  training  plus  resistance  training;  STBT,  stretching-toning-balance  training;  nEX,  no 
exercise

Discussion
This  systematic  review  and  network  meta-analysis  showed  that 
most  research  assessing  the  effects  of  exercise  on  brain-related 
outcomes  in  CAD  patients  focused  on  HR-QoL,  depression  and 
anxiety, while there was a lack of studies assessing other dimensions 
of brain-related outcomes, such as brain structure/function, cogni-
tion  or  sleep.  The  network  meta-analysis  revealed  that  in-person 
exercise  training  was  associated  with  improved  HR-QoL  and  re-
duced depressive and anxiety symptoms, while the same type of ex-
ercise  delivered  at  home  had  markedly  and  consistently  smaller 
effect  estimates  for  improving  these  outcomes.  Furthermore, 
HIIT seems to be equally effective as MIT in improving these out-
comes.  Likewise,  the intervention  duration or  volume of  exercise 
training did not impact the outcomes. Overall, these findings sug-
gest that exercise training, especially in-person programmes, could 
improve the HR-QoL, attenuate depressive symptoms, and reduce 
anxiety in patients with CAD. These findings were robust and per-
sisted in our secondary and sensitivity analyses (i.e. excluding stud-
ies with high risk of bias).

Effects of exercise on HR-QoL
HR-QoL is reduced in patients with CAD, especially after diagnosing 
CAD.88,89 The present meta-analysis indicates that in-person exer-
cise  training  is  associated  with  improved  HR-QoL  outcomes  (i.e. 
overall, PCS, and MCS), independent of the type of exercise. This 

beneficial impact of exercise on HR-QoL is consistent with previous 
meta-analyses including other diseased populations, such as patients 
with heart failure,90 stroke,91 cancer,92 or Parkinson disease.93

We found that HIIT had a similar effect estimate as MIT for improv-
ing HR-QoL. This aligns with results of previous meta-analyses,94,95
except for  one  previous  study  in  which  HIIT  exhibited  greater  im-
provement in PCS compared with MIT.95 Several types of exercise 
had only one comparison (e.g. HIIT + R and STBT), and no strong con-
clusions  can  be  therefore  drawn  for  these  intervention  types. 
Particularly  interesting  is  the  lack  of  studies  evaluating  the  effects 
of resistance exercise alone, which might impact brain-related out-
comes of CAD patients,96,97 and therefore needs more research in 
the future. Recent studies are developing exercise programmes com-
bining both aerobic and resistance training, which aligns with the re-
commendations of the World Health Organization.36 Our network 
meta-analysis suggested that HIIT + R could be effective in improving 
HR-QoL and that MIT + R showed a tendency towards positive ef-
fects, although these were not statistically significant. One advantage 
of our network meta-analysis approach is the incorporation of indir-
ect  comparisons,  enabling  for  the  inclusion  of  more  studies. 
However, these results should be interpreted with some caution as 
there is a large heterogeneity in the findings. This heterogeneity could 
be attributed to differences in the studies, such as characteristics of 
the exercise intervention (e.g. intensity continuum, diversity on the 
exercises included, such as different types of activities or equipment, 
outdoor or indoor) or CAD patient population (e.g. severity of dis-
ease, time after diagnosis, baseline mental status or medication use),

Figure 3 Health-related quality of life estimates for total, physical, and mental component scores for different types of exercise compared with no 
exercise (usual care) using the network meta-analysis. The comparisons are the number of studies included in the analyses. The proportion represents 
the amount of direct evidence that was used to determine the effect estimates. P-scores were scaled from 0 (worst) to 1 (best). SMD, standardized 
mean difference; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; HIIT, high-intensity interval training; HIIT + R, high-intensity interval training plus resistance training; 
MIT, moderate-intensity training; MIT + R, moderate-intensity training plus resistance training; STBT, stretching-toning-balance training; PCS, physical 
component score; MCS, mental component score

which have been pointed to exert distinct impacts on the HR-QoL of 
patients with CAD.88 Our network meta-analysis is an important step 
in comparing different types of exercise, but future studies are needed 
to unravel the moderating effects of different factors (i.e. characteris-
tics  of  exercise  interventions  and  patient  population)  to  move  to-
wards  a  more  ‘personalized  medicine’  approach  to  exercise 
prescription in CAD patients.

A major contribution of our study to the existing literature is the dif-
ferential effect sizes of in-person vs. home-based exercise. These differ-
ences  could  be  attributed  to  several  factors,  such  as  differences 
in  adherence,  better  monitoring  and  live  feedback-to-patients  of 
face-to-face sessions, and/or social interaction. However, these factors 
are  poorly  and  heterogeneously  reported  in  the  included  studies. 
Interestingly,  our  results  are  contradictory  to  a  previous  systematic 

review98 in CVD patients. In this review, the authors concluded that 
both home- and centre-based CR provided similar improvements in 
HR-QoL. Potential explanations for the conflicting outcomes may re-
late to differences in the target population (all CVDs vs. only CAD in 
our study), interventions (CR vs. exercise in our study), number of in-
cluded studies (17 vs. 30 in our study), and methodological approach 
(they did not run any meta-analysis per se on this outcome but used 
vote counting vs. network meta-analysis in our study). In addition, the 
authors decided that pooling data were too complex due to large var-
iations  in  HR-QoL  instruments.  Nevertheless,  we  included  standar-
dized  changes-from-baseline  and  ranked  instruments  to  pool  data 
and perform the network  meta-analysis. Our network meta-analysis 
further allowed multiple comparisons using both direct and indirect ef-
fects,  which  resulted  in  a  clear  differential  effect  between  exercise

Figure 4 Health-related quality of life estimates for total, physical, and mental component scores for different settings of exercise training compared 
with no exercise using the network meta-analysis. The comparisons are the number of studies included in the analysis. The proportion refers to the 
amount of direct evidence that was used to determine the effect estimates. P-scores were scaled from 0 (worst) to 1 (best). For quality of life, positive 
differences indicate an improvement, whereas for depression and anxiety, negative differences indicate a reduction in symptoms. SMD, standardized

provide even bigger benefits in patients with more depressive and anx-
iety symptoms.

Effects of exercise on depressive and 
anxiety symptoms
In-person exercise interventions were associated with a positive effect 
on reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms among CAD patients, 
while home-based interventions did not yield significant improvements 
in both outcomes. Interestingly, the examination of various exercise 
types, yielded no statistically significant effects, and the same happened 
when classifying interventions based on their duration and total volume. 
Consistent  with  previous  literature,  our  work  holds  the  promise  in 
ameliorating anxiety and depression symptoms in CAD patients with 
exercise.99–101 Most previous studies addressing depressive and anxiety 
symptoms  on  CAD  have  focused  on  multi-component  CR  pro-
grammes, and therefore, interpreting and comparing these findings be-
comes  challenging  since  not  all  changes  can  be  solely  attributed  to 
exercise.98,100 Furthermore, baseline levels of anxiety and depression 
may  also  impact  the  effects  of  exercise100 in  which  exercise  might 

Clinical implications
To enhance participation in CR programmes, home-based exercise 
interventions  are  becoming  increasingly  popular,  and  a  previous 
systematic  review  had  suggested  that  they  can  be  equally 
effective  as  in-person  exercise-based  programmes.98 However,  in 
the  present  updated  and  comprehensive  systematic  review,  using 
data  harmonization  and  advanced  network  meta-analysis  techni-
ques,  we  observed  a  clear  differential  effect,  suggesting  that  in- 
person  programmes  are  markedly 
improving 
HR-QoL, depression, and anxiety in CAD patients. These  findings 
have  important  clinical  implications.  While  home-based  interven-
tions may be a promising (and probably necessary) strategy to en-
courage  participation 
in  exercise  programmes,  the  present 
network  meta-analysis  suggests  that  the  current  literature  raises 
concerns regarding its effectiveness in improving HR-QoL, depres-
sion,  and  anxiety  and  therefore  opens  venues  for  discussion  on

which features of home-based programmes could be optimized to

Strengths and limitations
The main strengths of our study are that we analysed the effects of dif-
ferent types, settings, duration, and volume (and indirectly intensity) of 
exercise on several brain-related dimensions and that we used a net-
work meta-analysis approach enabling for both direct and indirect effect 
estimates.  Furthermore,  the  search  and  selection  process  has  been 
rigorously  carried  out,  according  to  the  most  up-to-date  guidelines 
and including many electronic databases to guarantee adequate and ef-
ficient  coverage.  Our  network  meta-analysis  is  based  only  on  RCTs, 
which is the best study design available to investigate cause-effects.

Our study also has some limitations that must be addressed. First, the 
selection process has been restricted to studies examining the isolated 
effects of exercise, and we excluded grey literature, which might have 
impacted  our  results.  Second,  nearly  half  of  the  studies  were  rated 
with some concerns for the risk of bias and another 22% as high risk 
of bias. However, the sensitivity analyses excluding studies with a high 
risk  of bias  revealed  similar effect  estimates.  To  increase  the  quality 
of evidence, studies need to improve their reporting about the random-
ization  process,  study  deviations,  and  (pre-)  selected  outcomes.102
Third, several types of exercise had only one comparison (e.g. HIIT +  
R  and  STBT),  and  no  major  conclusions  can  therefore  be  drawn 

about  the  effectiveness  of  these  types  of  exercise.  Future  network 
meta-analyses including  more studies  should confirm  our results  for 
different types of exercise. Furthermore, some potential local inconsist-
encies were found, which could not be explained by the study charac-
teristics. However, additional comparisons improving both direct and 
indirect evidence and under-reported factors, such as adherence, com-
pliance and intensity, are important to improve the current study and 
need further investigation. Finally, we had significant heterogeneity in 
the analyses, which might be explained by variability in several key fac-
tors such as differences in characteristics of the patients and exercise 
interventions,  as  these  factors  could  lead  to  different  physiological 
adaptations. Furthermore, the included studies used a wide variety of 
instruments to assess brain-related outcomes. The use of different in-
struments  forced  us  to  include  standardized  changes-from-baseline, 
which could also introduce heterogeneity. Nevertheless, we standar-
dized the change-from-baseline using pooled pre-SDs of studies using 
the same instruments.

Conclusions
Our systematic review has identified that most of the current research 
on  exercise  brain-related  outcomes  in  CAD  patients  is  focused  on 
HR-QoL, depression, and anxiety and highlights the need of studies as-
sessing  other  dimensions  of  brain,  such  as  brain  structure/function,

cognition, and sleep. Second, our network meta-analysis provided ro-
bust evidence supporting that in-person exercise interventions were as-
sociated with improved HR-QoL (including both the PCS and MCS) as 
well as reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms and should therefore 
be encouraged by health care providers. Furthermore, our study sup-
ports that the effectiveness of exercise reduces considerably when de-
livered by home-based interventions. Third, HIIT seems to be equally 
effective as MIT in improving these outcomes, suggesting that intensity 
might not impact these outcomes, yet needs further study. Future re-
search should thoroughly investigate whether specific types or novel ap-
proaches in home-based interventions  could prove more  effective in 
enhancing brain-related outcomes than those utilized until the moment.
