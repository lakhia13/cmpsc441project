ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND Social isolation and loneliness have emerged as important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases,
particularly during the coronavirus disease pandemic. However, it is unclear whether social isolation and loneliness had

independent and joint associations with incident heart failure (HF).

OBJECTIVES This study sought to examine the association of social isolation, loneliness, and their combination with
incident HF.

METHODS The UK Biobank study is a population-based cohort study. Social isolation and loneliness were assessed using
self-reported questionnaires. HF cases were identiﬁed by linking hospital records and death registries. The weighted
polygenic risk score associated with HF was calculated.

RESULTS Among the 464,773 participants (mean age: 56.5 (cid:1) 8.1 years, 45.3% male), 12,898 incident HF cases were
documented during a median follow-up of 12.3 years. Social isolation (most vs least: adjusted HR: 1.17; 95% CI:1.11-1.23)
and loneliness (yes vs no: adjusted HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.11-1.27) were signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of
incident HF. The association between an elevated risk of HF and social isolation was modiﬁed by loneliness
(Pinteraction ¼ 0.034). A gradient of association between social isolation and the risk of incident HF was found only among
individuals without loneliness (Ptrend < 0.001), but not among those with loneliness (Ptrend ¼ 0.829). These associations
were independent of the genetic risk of HF.

CONCLUSIONS Social isolation and loneliness were independently associated with a higher likelihood of incident
HF regardless of genetic risk. The association between social isolation and incident HF was potentially modiﬁed by
loneliness status. (J Am Coll Cardiol HF 2023;11:334–344) © 2023 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Social Disconnection and Incident Heart Failure

H eart failure (HF) has emerged as a global

pandemic affecting >60 million individuals
worldwide.1 Social isolation and loneliness
have been recently recognized as important psycho-

of

social determinants
cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.2,3
“Social isolation” refers to being objectively alone or
having infrequent social connections, whereas “lone-
liness” is deﬁned as a painful feeling caused by a
discrepancy between one’s desire for connections
and the actual degree of connections.4,5 Despite
compelling evidence linking social isolation and lone-

complete multiple touchscreen computer-

based questionnaires, record physical mea-

surements, and provide biological samples.

social
However, whether loneliness also contributes to the

development of HF is uncertain. Moreover, social

isolation and loneliness are 2 weakly correlated but
independent aspects of social disconnection,9 sug-
gesting that simply increasing objective social contact

may not mitigate the health risk from loneliness and

vice versa. The joint effects of social isolation and

loneliness on the risk of HF have not yet been stud-

ied. Additionally, because the development of HF is

determined by both environmental stimuli and ge-
netic risk,10 it is unclear whether such associations
are modiﬁed by genetic risk for HF.

To address these knowledge gaps, the present

study aimed to investigate the independent and joint

effects of social isolation and loneliness on incident
HF in a population-based cohort study of >400,000
adults enrolled in the UK Biobank. In addition, we

examined the potential modulatory effects of genetic

risk on these associations.

METHODS

SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS. The social
isolation index was constructed from 3 questions that

are similar to those of the validated Berkman-Syme
social network index:13
1) contact with family/
friends/groups: “How often do you visit friends or
family or have them visit you?;” 2) contact with
following
family/friends/groups:

“Which of

the

(sports club or gym, pub or social club, religious

group, adult education class, other group activity) do
you engage in once a week or more often?;” and
3) living alone: “Including yourself, how many people
are living together in your household?” One point was
assigned to each question, resulting in a total social

isolation score ranging from 0 to 3. Social isolation
was further classiﬁed into 3 levels according to the
total score: a score of 0 indicated least isolation;

1 indicated moderate isolation; and 2 and 3 indicated
most isolation.14 Loneliness was assessed with the
following 2 questions that were derived from the

revised University of California, Los Angeles loneli-
ness scale:15 1) “Do you often feel
lonely?;” and
2) “How often are you able to conﬁde in someone
close to you?” Individuals were deﬁned as being
lonely if they had a total score of 2.14 Detailed infor-
mation for scoring methods of social isolation and

loneliness

RESULTS

The characteristics of the study sample were compa-

rable to those of the overall sample in the UK Biobank

(Supplemental Table 3). The study sample for the

main analysis comprised 464,773 participants (mean
age: 56.5 (cid:1) 8.1 years, 45.3% male), of whom 187,817
(40.4%) were moderately isolated, 66,545 (14.3%)

were most isolated, and 22,208 (4.8%) had feelings of

fraction: 4.66%). The associations of social isolation

and loneliness with incident HF displayed a dose-

curves (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3). There were

dose-gradient associations between the continuous

Social isolation and loneliness interacted with the
subsequent risk of HF (Pinteraction ¼ 0.034) (Table 3).
When stratiﬁed by loneliness status, there was a
gradient association between social isolation and the

risk of incident HF among individuals without lone-
liness (Ptrend < 0.001), but not among those with
loneliness (Ptrend ¼ 0.829) (Table 3). When stratiﬁed
by social isolation level, the association of loneliness
with incident HF remained signiﬁcant only among
the least and moderately isolated groups (both
Ptrend < 0.001), but not among the most isolated

Our ﬁndings help complement the broad spectrum
of published reports on associations of social re-

lationships with CVD risk. A previous cohort study

uncovered a potential

link between social discon-

nection and incident HF but it only considered social
isolation.6 Several recent studies showed that both
aspects of social disconnection,20,24,25 social isolation
only,7 or loneliness only8,26 were associated with the
risk of incident CVD. These inconsistent ﬁndings
were possibly caused by the variations in social
network measurements,3 age group,7 sample size,
and deﬁnition of the CVD across these studies. Our

events7 or lack of direct comparisons of social isola-

addition, we are the ﬁrst to reveal that associations of

with a prior gene-interaction study.17

individuals who are hostile or have stressful social
relationships29 and bridges the link between social
isolation and depression.27 Another possible expla-
nation was that loneliness might be more closely

correlated with the CVD precursors of HF. This was
supported by our ﬁnding that nonfatal CVDs more
substantially mediated the association of loneliness

with incident HF. Conversely,

psychological therapies targeting negative coping,
social skills training, and supported socialization.29
For example, a recent trial showed that a layperson-

delivered, empathy-oriented telephone call program
within 4 weeks signiﬁcantly reduced loneliness during
the COVID-19 pandemic.34 Alternatively, community-
level strategies29 and social and political policies5 are
also warranted to help incorporate interventions tar-

geting social disconnection across diverse ethical and

cultural settings. Finally, to help prevent HF, it is also

important to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent

subsequent mediators or moderators linking social

disconnection to incident HF.
STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. The strengths of
this study include its large sample size, long-term

follow-up, prospective study design, careful control

of covariates, and comprehensive sensitivity ana-

lyses. However, this study had several limitations.

First, the UK Biobank only assessed in-person contact

as an indicator of social isolation. It lacks assessments

of virtual connections or other aspects of social re-

lationships. Second, the simple questions used to

assess social isolation and loneliness in the UK Bio-

bank have not been validated. However, these ques-
tions were adapted from validated scales13,15 and
widely adopted in previous studies.14,20 Third, using
hospital admission and death linkage methods to

ascertain HF cases may exclude individuals with mild

HF events. Therefore, the incidence of HF may have

been underestimated in this study. Fourth,

and regarded HF as an outcome despite the long

follow-up period of approximately 12 years, which

may limit the generalizability of this study and result

in a lower observed incidence of HF. The number of

HF events in our study was still far larger than that in
previous studies,6,7 suggesting sufﬁcient statistical
power. Fifth, similar to other large-scale epidemio-
logic studies,6,35 the present study failed to subclas-
sify etiologic types and severity of HF because of a

lack of ejection fraction information in the UK Bio-
bank. In addition, a signiﬁcant concern of this study
was reverse causation. However, the results remained

robust in the sensitivity analyses, suggesting that the

PERSPECTIVES

CONCLUSIONS

The present study suggests that social isolation and

loneliness could be associated with an increased risk

of subsequent HF, regardless of the genetic risk pro-
ﬁles. Moreover, loneliness may modify the associa-
tion between social isolation and HF incidence. Given

regular

social distancing during the COVID-19

pandemic,

these ﬁndings

suggest

that

the in-

terventions across individual, communal, and socie-

tal levels to strengthen subjective and objective social

connections could potentially hold promise for the

maintenance of cardiovascular health.

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Social isolation
and loneliness are 2 important modiﬁable risk factors of incident
HF, regardless of the genetic risk of HF. The association between
social isolation and incident HF is potentially modiﬁed by feelings
of loneliness.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future research should
develop effective and systemic interventions to reduce social

isolation and loneliness and validate whether the improvement

of social connection help reduce HF risk in later life, particularly

considering the increasing incidence of social disconnection

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
