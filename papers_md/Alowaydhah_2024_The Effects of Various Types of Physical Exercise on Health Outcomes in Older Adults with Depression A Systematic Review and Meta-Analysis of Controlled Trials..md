Background and Purpose. The number of older adults and the occurrence of concomitant health issues continue to grow. One of the
most prevalent mental health issues in this population is depression. Physical exercise (PE) is widely acknowledged as a method to
alleviate the associated health burdens of aging, including depression; however, there is no collated evidence regarding the eﬀectiveness
of speciﬁc types of exercise on a range of health outcomes. To address this, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate exercise
beneﬁts for this speciﬁc subgroup. Methods. An electronic search of ﬁve databases was used to retrieve controlled studies investigating
health-related outcomes associated with any type of PE, in adults over 65 years with depression. Where possible, data were analyzed
in meta-analyses or else reported narratively. Results and Discussion. Fifteen studies were included in the review. All 15 studies had
data available for meta-analysis, yet heterogeneity in exercise types and outcome measures limited synthesis. When data for all types
of exercise were pooled together, signiﬁcant improvements were found in depression (SMD = 0 52; CI = 0 07, 0 97; p = 0 02),
physical health and function (SMD = 0 44, CI = 0 14, 0 74; p = 0 004), anxiety (SMD = 0 23; CI = 0 04, 0 42; p = 0 02), and self-
eﬃcacy (SMD = 0 97; CI = 0 32, 1 61; p = 0 003). When data were pooled according to exercise type, positive eﬀects were
demonstrated for aerobic exercise on depression (SMD = 0 49; CI = −0 16, 0 8; p = 0 003),
tai chi/qigong on depression
(SMD = 0 89; CI = −0 14, 1 63; p = 0 02), and self-eﬃcacy (SMD = 6 70; CI = −0 90, 12 50; p = 0 02) and multicomponent exercise
demonstrated positive eﬀects on physical function (SMD = 0 49; CI = 0 12, 0 87; p = 0 009) and the physical health component of
quality of life (SMD = 0 88; CI = 0 10, 1 65; p = 0 03). No health-related beneﬁts were revealed from the combined ﬁndings of the two
studies investigating strengthening exercises. Conclusion. Lack of consistency regarding exercise types, dosage, and outcomes presents
challenges in the evidence. In general, exercise is beneﬁcial across a range of health-related variables. Multicomponent, aerobic, and tai
chi forms of exercise appear most likely to reap beneﬁts in depressed older adults; however, the type of beneﬁt is determined by the
type of exercise and should be considered when recommending a regime. This trial is registered with CRD42020173465.

1. Introduction

The number of older adults aged 65 years represents more
than a third of the world population [1], with the global pop-
ulation growth in this age group increasing from 727 million

in 2020 to 1.5 billion by 2050 [2]. This results in increased
pressure on health and social services with older adult
healthcare usage per capita estimated to be 3 to 5 times
higher than that of young adults [3]. Statistics from Western
countries indicate that up to 50% of the overall health budget

2

Depression and Anxiety

is spent on providing care to older adults [4], with predic-
tions for signiﬁcant increases in residential care spending
[5]. Therefore, strategies to maintain the independence and
health of this group are crucial to combat the escalating costs
that are borne by the individual and society.

The number of chronic diseases rises concurrently with
age [6], with depression being the most prevalent mental
disease aﬀecting over 350 million older adults globally [7,
8]. The World Health Organization states that depression
is the primary contributor to mortality and poor quality of
life in older adults [8] and is correlated with various condi-
tions such as cardiovascular disease [9], diabetes [10], and
acute coronary syndrome [11]. Depression is a mood disor-
der that ranges from typical, ﬂeeting periods of sadness
experienced in everyday life to a clinical syndrome charac-
terized by prolonged and intense symptoms that signiﬁ-
cantly deviate from normality [12].

Physical exercise (PE) has been demonstrated to have
especially
impacts on psychological domains
positive
depression in older adults [13, 14]. The National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends incorporat-
ing group exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, into the
treatment of depression. They suggest engaging in organized
and supervised moderate-intensity exercise routines, more
than one session per week, for 10 weeks [15]. Similarly, the
Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists
have included regular exercise in their Clinical Practice
Guidelines for mood disorders. They add that although the
optimal amount and type of exercise are yet to be deter-
mined, regular aerobic and resistance exercises are likely
optimal [16]. For older adults in general, the Physical Activ-
ity Guideline for Americans suggests at least 150 minutes of
moderately intense exercise or a minimum of 75 minutes of
vigorous exercise per week. For those with chronic condi-
tions, they should be as physically active as their abilities
and conditions allow [17].

In older adults with depression, research has shown that
PE may have beneﬁts in ameliorating not just the mood disor-
der, but other health indicators as well [18]. Five previous
reviews have been conducted investigating the eﬀect of physi-
cal exercise in older adults with depression. One previous sys-
tematic review investigated the eﬀect of diﬀerent types of
exercise programs on depression and concluded that mind-
body exercise had the greatest impact on reducing depressive
symptoms. This review is limited in that it restricted its scope
to only three types of exercise and excluded multicomponent
exercise programs. The authors justify that this was to avoid
any potential synergistic eﬀect on depressive symptoms,
within a single intervention group [19]. However, the majority
of community and clinically run programs for older adults
oﬀer multicomponent exercise; therefore, inclusion of this
type of program is warranted. A further three reviews mea-
sured the eﬀect of exercise on one outcome in isolation,
depression, limiting the ability to draw holistic conclusions
about the value of exercise in this population [20–22]. The
ﬁnal review was limited in that it restricted both exercise types
and outcomes of interest to a narrow focus [23].

These limitations produce a lack of coherence in the lit-
erature. This systematic review is aimed at collating and syn-

thesizing evidence regarding the prescription of exercise in
older adults with depression to determine the eﬀectiveness
of speciﬁc types of exercise on a spectrum of health out-
comes. The objective was twofold: initially, to ascertain the
advantages of engaging in PE concerning speciﬁc health
indices such as (1) physical health and functioning, (2) cog-
nitive function, and (3) mental health and overall wellbeing
among older adults with depression and, secondly, to iden-
tify the speciﬁc forms of exercise that oﬀer the greatest ben-
eﬁts to this particular demographic.

2. Method

This review is one component of a broader review aimed at
developing exercise recommendations for older adults, and
the protocol for this systematic review was registered with
the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
on 28 April 2020 (CRD42020173465). The overarching
review encompasses speciﬁc subgroups of individuals who
have common medical conditions in older populations, such
as cognitive impairment, orthopedic conditions, and neuro-
logical diseases. The ﬁndings related to these subgroups will
be presented in separate reports. This review focuses on
older adults who were recruited into exercise studies with
the fundamental criteria of being depressed. This review
adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Report-
ing Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) statement [24].

2.1. Information Sources. The search strategy was developed
using key terms related to “exercise” and “geriatric”. Med-
line, Cochrane, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus databases
were comprehensively searched. The study did not use a
strict methodological ﬁlter to be inclusive, but it set a time
limit for studies published after 1989 to match current exer-
cise practices. Research during the COVID pandemic was
not included because programs were often modiﬁed, making
them inconsistent for meta-analysis in terms of recruitment,
implementation, adherence, and outcomes. The search strat-
egy used for MEDLINE is provided as an example in supple-
mentary material (available here).

2.2. Eligibility Criteria. The inclusion criteria for selected
articles were (a) articles written in English and limited to
human adults (≥65 years) on average, (b) study design lim-
ited to randomized controlled studies, and (c) physical exer-
cise intervention compared with control. Exclusion criteria
included (a) those published before 1990; (b) those pub-
lished in languages other than English; (c) those focusing
on cardiac, respiratory, and postsurgery populations; and
(d) those with study designs such as protocols, systematic
reviews,
conference
commentaries,
abstracts, case studies, and case series.

editorials,

reports,

The PICO format, consisting of four stages (population,
intervention, comparison, and outcome), was used for this
analysis. The following section provides detailed explana-
tions of each aspect.

2.3. Population. The study primarily concentrated on indi-
viduals of either gender who were aged 65 or above. These

Depression and Anxiety

3

individuals were classiﬁed as depressed older adults, based
on the original authors’ deﬁnitions. In cases where the study
population included individuals of various age groups, stud-
ies were included if the average age of the population was
greater than 65 years. Studies that focused on populations
with cardiac or respiratory diseases, recent fractures, or indi-
viduals who were in the postsurgery phase were excluded
from the review since these subgroups require speciﬁc exer-
cise considerations.

2.4. Intervention. We included studies examining any form
of physical exercise intervention as described by the deﬁni-
tion of a planned, organized, and repeated physical activity
that seeks to enhance or sustain one or more physical ﬁtness
components [25]. Both individual exercise and group set-
tings were considered in this analysis. However, studies that
involved speciﬁc programs targeted at cardiac/respiratory
interventions or fall prevention were excluded from the
review.

2.5. Comparison. Only studies that included a control condi-
tion were included in the analysis. The control condition
could consist of usual care (such as occupational therapy
or no care), diﬀerent types of interventions (such as cogni-
tive behavioral therapy), or wait-list control. Studies that
compared diﬀerent types of exercise interventions without
a nonexercise control condition and compared exercise
intervention with depressed medication were excluded from
the review.

2.6. Outcome Measures. Studies focusing on health-related
outcomes were considered for inclusion. This encompassed
quality of life measured by validated tools such as Older Peo-
ple Quality of Life Questionnaire (OPQoL-brief) [26], cogni-
tive function such as the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) [27], depression (e.g., Geriatric Depression Scale
(GDS) [28], mood such as Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) [29], and pain intensity such as Visual Analog
Scale) [30], and functional outcomes such as activity daily
living (ADL). Studies which did not include any one of these
outcomes were excluded. In assessing the quality of life, we
included subscores of physical health and mental health in
the instances where studies did not report the composite
total for analysis. If a study incorporated multiple assess-
ments of a similar outcome, such as both the Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depres-
sion Scale (HADS) to evaluate mood, we used the data from
the tool reported to be the primary outcome measure. In the
case that this was not stated, the data from the tool that
appeared more frequently across the included studies was
used in the analysis. To control for potential bias, sensitivity
analyses were conducted.

2.7. Selection Process. Following the removal of duplicate
studies, two reviewers (SA, IW) independently evaluated
the titles and abstracts and subsequently the full texts, to
determine
eligibility. Any disagreements between the
reviewers were resolved through discussion with a third
reviewer (JM). The screening process was facilitated by

Covidence (a systematic review software, Veritas Health
Innovation, Melbourne, Australia).

2.8. Data Collection Process. Data were extracted to a spread-
sheet, and all relevant details including study title, authors,
publication year, published country, sample size, sex distri-
bution, study design, participants, intervention, comparison,
and outcomes and their signiﬁcance were recorded. Data
extraction was done by one author (SA) and cross-checked
by a third author. The methodological quality of individual
studies was determined using the PEDro scale. This scale is
widely accepted as a reliable [31] and valid [32] tool for eval-
uating the methodological quality of clinical trials, particu-
larly in the context of physiotherapy and rehabilitation
research.

2.9. Synthesis Methods. A descriptive analysis was conducted
on the extracted data, and the ﬁndings were presented in
tables and graphs to address the research question. When-
ever possible, comparable study data in terms of participant
characteristics, intervention, and outcome measures were
pooled, and meta-analyses were performed using RevMan
software. The appropriate model (ﬁxed or random eﬀect)
was selected based on the level of heterogeneity, which was
assessed using the I2 statistic whereby higher scores repre-
sent higher levels of heterogeneity [33]. If the I2 value
exceeded 30%, a random-eﬀects model was applied to
account for the intertrial heterogeneity. In the instance
where diﬀerent tools were used to measure the same out-
come, the standard mean diﬀerence was calculated. This
review followed the standard interpretation of eﬀect sizes
as small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8) [33]. In the
instances where more than one tool was used to assess the
outcome, we conducted sensitivity analyses by substituting
data from one measurement tool for the others reported in
the study to test the strength of the ﬁndings.

3. Results

3.1. Study Selection. The online search identiﬁed 35824 rele-
vant citations, of which 8836 were duplicates. After their
removal, 26988 articles were screened based on title and
abstract. Altogether, 2147 studies were included in the full-
text screen, of which 1849 articles were excluded. This left
298 articles related to exercise in older adults; in total, 15
studies were relevant for the subgroup of older adults with
depression reported in the review. Please see Figure 1 for
the ﬂow of the review process.

3.2. Quality of the Included Studies. The 15 studies that met
all the inclusion criteria demonstrated a range of methodo-
logical quality, from low to high (range 3-8), with an average
PEDro score of 5.6 out of 10. Most studies (86.6%) used ran-
domization, but only 26.6% reported concealed allocation.
Among the quality assessment criteria, blinding received
the poorest scores. No studies reported participant blinding
or blinding of the therapists. For a detailed overview of the
quality assessment scores, please refer to Table 1.

3.3. Study Characteristics. Fifteen studies involving 2100
older adults with depression were included in the review.
The average age of participants was 76.7 years. Participants
were recruited from a range of sources. Nine of these studies
sourced participants from community settings [34–42],
three from residential care facilities [43–45], and three from
medical facilities [46–48].

The studies were conducted throughout the world with
the highest frequency in Asia [36, 37, 40, 42, 44, 48]; four
in the United States [34, 35, 39, 41]; and one study each in
the UK [45], Italy [46], Australia [47], New Zealand [38],
and Turkey [43].

The majority of studies provided multicomponent exer-
cise interventions which included strength, ﬂexibility/
stretching, balance, coordination, and aerobic exercises
[34–38, 40, 43, 45]. Strengthening exercises were applied in
two studies [41, 47]. Similarly, qigong exercise was reported
in two studies [44, 48]. Aerobic exercise [42, 46] and tai chi

[39] were each investigated in single studies. The duration of
the treatment and the total dose of exercise varied greatly
between studies. The interventions lasted a minimum of 10
weeks [39, 43, 47], to a maximum of 52 weeks [45]. Individ-
ual session duration ranged from 30 minutes [44] to 120
minutes [39]. Table 2 provides a full description of the
included studies; Table 3 describes the results of each study
type and their outcomes.

3.4. Eﬀect of Exercise (of Any Type) on Older Adults with
Depression. All 15 studies investigated the eﬀects of exercise
on depression. When the data were pooled from 1554 partic-
ipants, signiﬁcant improvements were observed in physical
health and function (SMD = 0 44; CI = 0 14, 0 74; p = 0 004).
Similarly, positive eﬀects of exercise were demonstrated in
the outcomes of depression (SMD = 0 52; CI = 0 07, 0 97;
p = 0 02), anxiety (SMD = 0 23; CI = 0 04, 0 42; p = 0 02),
and self-eﬃcacy (SMD = 0 97; CI = 0 32, 1 61; p = 0 003).

No signiﬁcant beneﬁts were found for cognitive function
(SMD = 0 12; CI = −0 04, 0 28; p = 0 13) or for quality of
life (SMD = 0 82; CI = −0 33, 1 96; p = 0 16). Please refer
to Figure 2.

43, 45]. Pooled data from 1149 participants from diﬀerent
depression tools, such as HADS, GDS, and BDI, revealed no
positive eﬀect of multicomponent exercise on mental health
(SMD = 0 43; CI = −0 30, 1 17; p = 0 25). See Figure 3(c).

3.4.1. Eﬀect of Multicomponent Exercise. Programs incorpo-
rating diﬀerent components of exercise training were the
most common form of exercise program that was investi-
gated. This constituted 8 of the totals of 15 included studies.

(1) Physical Health and Function. Physical health was investi-
gated in 7 studies, and improvement was reported in 5 of these
studies [34–37, 40]. Data was available for meta-analysis for 6
studies using 6MWT, SPPS, and 2MWT [35–38, 40, 45] with
a total of 830 participants. A signiﬁcant beneﬁt of exercise for
physical health was demonstrated (SMD = 0 49; CI = 0 12,
0 87; p = 0 009). See Figure 3(a). In this meta-analysis, four
studies used additional measures to assess physical health. Four
of the studies included in the meta-analysis used additional
tools to assess physical health [35, 37, 38, 40]. When sensitivity
analyses were conducted by substituting these outcomes, the
signiﬁcance of the ﬁnding remained (p < 0 05).

(2) Cognitive Function. Two [40, 45] studies investigated the
eﬀects of multicomponent exercise on cognitive function
using word list memory (delay) and MMSE. When the data
were pooled from these studies of 516 participants, no signif-
icant eﬀect was found (SMD = 0 13; CI = −0 04, 0 30; p =
0 14). See Figure 3(b).

(4) Quality of Life. Six of the included studies investigated
the eﬀect of multicomponent exercise on quality of life,
and 3 of these reported beneﬁts [35, 36, 43]. Data were avail-
able for meta-analysis from 2 studies [36, 45] with 405 par-
ticipants
(SMD = 0 40;
CI = −0 58, 1 37; p = 0 43). See Figure 3(d).

to show no signiﬁcant beneﬁt

In some studies, quality of life was measured with the 36-
Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), and component scores for
physical and mental health were reported. A signiﬁcant beneﬁt
of multicomponent exercises on the physical health compo-
nent of quality of life was demonstrated when data were
pooled for 393 participants [35, 36, 38, 40, 43] (SMD = 0 88;
CI = 0 10, 1 65; p = 0 03). See Figure 3(e). Conversely, no pos-
itive beneﬁt was demonstrated in the mental health compo-
nent (SMD = 0 90; CI = −0 26, 2 07; p = 0 13). See Figure 3(f).

(5) Anxiety. One study explored the eﬀect of multicompo-
nent exercise on anxiety. The authors report that both the
exercise and control groups had reduced anxiety at the con-
clusion of the study, but no signiﬁcant between-group diﬀer-
ences were evident in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS)
(intervention mean change = 2 90, control
mean change = 0 73, and p = 0 28) [34].

(3) Mental Health and Wellbeing. Eight studies investigated
the eﬀect of multicomponent exercise on depression, and data
were available from all studies for meta-analysis [34–38, 40,

3.4.2. Eﬀect of Aerobic Exercise. Two studies investigated the
eﬀects of aerobic type exercise on health-related outcomes in
older adults with depression.

Figure 2: Eﬀect of physical exercise (of any type) on older adults with depression.

(f) Self-eﬃcacy

(1) Physical Health and Function. One study [42] investi-
gated the eﬀect of 3 months of Japanese drumming exercise,
once a week for 40 minutes on physical function to reveal a
positive eﬀect on the shuttle stamina test by walking (mean
change for intervention from baseline = 18 6; control group
= −3 6, p = 0 002) and hand grip strength (mean change
for intervention = −0 5; control group = −5 0, p = 0 001).

(2) Cognitive Function. This same study [42] assessed the
eﬀects of aerobic exercise on cognition by using the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE). No signiﬁcant beneﬁt
of exercise, compared to usual activity, was revealed (median
n change for intervention from baseline = 1 5 and control
= 1, p = 0 332).

(3) Mental Health and Wellbeing. Both studies with a com-
bined total of 161 participants [42, 46] assessed the merits
of aerobic exercise on depression. Meta-analysis revealed a
signiﬁcant beneﬁt compared to control (SMD = 0 49; CI =
−0 16, 0 81; p = 0 003). See Figure 4.

(4) Anxiety. One study evaluated the eﬀect of aerobic exer-
cise on anxiety. No signiﬁcant eﬀect on this outcome was
reported as measured on the Hamilton Depression Rating
Scale (HAM-D)
for the
intervention group = 0 99; control = 0 75, p = 0 06) [46].

3.4.3. Eﬀect of Strengthening Exercise. Two studies investi-
gated the eﬀect of strengthening exercise on health-related
outcomes in older adults with depression.

(1) Physical Health and Function. One study assessed the
eﬀects of strengthening exercises on physical health by using
the Human Activity Proﬁle (HAP MAS). No signiﬁcant ben-
eﬁt was observed (mean change for the intervention group
from baseline = 2 57; control = 1 7, p = 0 07) [47].

(2) Mental Health and Wellbeing. Two studies assessed the
eﬀect of strength training on depression using the Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS) and Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI) tools [41, 47]. When the data for 56 participants were

3.4.4. Eﬀect of Tai Chi/Qigong Exercises. Three studies
assessed the eﬀect of tai chi or qigong exercise on depressed
older adults.

(1) Physical Health and Function. Of the three studies that
evaluated the eﬀects of tai chi/qigong exercises [39, 44, 48],
only one assessed the outcome of physical health and func-
tioning (hand grip strength) [48]. A statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerence was reported between the exercise and control
groups (the mean diﬀerence of right-hand strength for the
intervention group from baseline and postintervention =
1 7 with an average increase and for control = 1 5 with an
average decrease, p = 0 03). The data was not compatible
with the meta-analysis.

(2) Cognitive Function. A single study assessed the eﬀect of
10 weeks of tai chi for 120 minutes once a week to reveal a
nonpositive beneﬁt on cognitive function (MMSE) (mean
the intervention group from baseline = 0;
change for
control = 0 3, p = 0 24) [39].

(3) Mental Health and Wellbeing. Data for 188 participants
were pooled together, to demonstrate the positive beneﬁt

of tai chi and qigong exercise in improving mental health
(SMD = 0 89; CI = −0 14, 1 63; p = 0 02) [39, 44, 48]. See
Figure 6(a).

(4) Quality of Life. Two studies assessed the beneﬁt of tai chi/
qigong exercise on quality of
life. One study reported
improvement as measured by the 36-Item Short Form
Health Survey (SF-36) for physical function (mean change
for intervention group from baseline = 3 7; control = 0 3, p
= 0 02), emotional function (mean change for the interven-
tion group from baseline = 35 8; control = 13 6, p = 0 003)
[39], and another one found enhancement in the Personal
Wellbeing Index (PWI) (mean diﬀerence for intervention
group from baseline = 11 43; control = 5 47, p = 0 0001)
[44]. The data was not compatible with the meta-analysis.

(5) Self-Eﬃcacy. The data of 119 participants were pooled
from 2 studies [44, 48] to reveal a signiﬁcant beneﬁt of exer-
cise on self-eﬃcacy (SMD = 6 70; CI = 0 90, 12 50; p = 0 02).
See Figure 6(b).

4. Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis represents the pri-
mary attempt to comprehensively synthesize and analyze the
existing evidence on a range of exercise types for older adults
with depression and identify which types of exercise could
be prescribed to achieve speciﬁc health outcomes. This
review endorses the recommendations of the National Insti-
tute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines in support
of exercise for this population [15]. It further extends our
knowledge on this topic by providing valuable insights into
the speciﬁc types of exercise that yield the most signiﬁcant
advantages in relation to speciﬁc health-related outcomes.

Depression and Anxiety

17

Four distinct categories of exercise have been studied
in this population, which include aerobic, tai chi/qigong,
multicomponent, and strengthening exercise programs. It
seems that each type of exercise program oﬀers distinct
health beneﬁts. Evidence indicates that tai chi/qigong exer-
cise oﬀers the most notable advantages in enhancing mul-
tiple health outcomes that
include physical health and
function, mental health and wellbeing, self-eﬃcacy, cogni-
tive function, and quality of life. Multicomponent exercise
is of limited beneﬁt to depression or cognitive function,
but favorable for physical health and the physical health
component of quality-of-life measures. Similarly, aerobic
exercise can improve mental health wellbeing, and physical
function, but not cognitive function, nor anxiety. Strength-
ening exercises do not appear to be eﬀective for older
adults with depression in any of
the reported health
outcomes.

However, caution must be applied when drawing deﬁni-
tive conclusions about the speciﬁc eﬀects of exercise pro-
grams due to the small number of studies available for
some types of exercise and the heterogeneity of the interven-
tions and the outcome tools used to measure eﬀectiveness.
This may contribute to the inconsistency of our ﬁndings in
relation to a previous review [49]. Bridle et al. reviewed the
eﬀect of exercise on depressed older adults and found that
multicomponent exercise can reduce depression but that
there was insuﬃcient evidence for tai chi and qigong exercise
[49]. However, our study supports the positive eﬀect of tai
chi and qigong exercises. The diﬀerence is that Bridle et al.
include a small number of studies in their systematic review,
but we include more studies, making our study stronger with
a large number of evidence. Our ﬁnding conﬁrms those of
Park et al. who report the positive beneﬁt of tai chi and
qigong exercises on depression [18].

Previous reviews have focused on limited exercise types
[19, 23] or limited outcomes [20–23], which restrict their
ﬁndings. To overcome this narrow focus, we facilitated com-
parisons across all forms of exercise and health-related out-
comes in depressed older populations. To minimize bias and
speciﬁcally
facilitate
between-group comparisons, we
included controlled trials; however, the quality of some of
these studies was poor; the review was hindered by the
incongruity of the available evidence; and meta-analysis
was limited due to unusable data. Thus, caution must be
taken in interpreting these ﬁndings as they are prone to type
I and type II errors. In the future, researchers must adopt
standardized approaches regarding exercise type, dosage,
and outcome measurement to facilitate the comparison of
ﬁndings across studies. Additionally,
to
acknowledge that our study sample predominantly consisted
of females, which may be representative of the older popula-
tion and may limit the generalizability to male populations.
Moreover, our review has a time constraint as we only
looked at studies up to 2020. This is because the delivery
of exercise changed to reduce personal contact during and
after COVID, and this might mean that we did not include
some relevant studies. Lastly, this review may have over-
looked relevant studies published in languages other than
English due to the restriction of our search criteria.

it is important

The lack of comprehensive and methodologically rigor-
ous research on the eﬀects of physical exercise in older adults
is a signiﬁcant limitation that hinders both the clinical appli-
cation of exercise interventions and the development of
evidence-based policies.

5. Conclusion

This review demonstrates that exercise in older depressed
adults has positive eﬀects on a range of health-related out-
comes, which appear to be speciﬁc to the type of exercise
performed. We encourage clinicians to carefully consider
the desired health beneﬁts to ensure that the most appropri-
ate exercise is prescribed.
